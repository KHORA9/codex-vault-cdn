The increasing frequency of such inquiries, and the wide range\r\nof topics covered, have created the impression that an untechnical\r\naccount of the rise and progress of biology would be of interest to\r\na considerable audience. As might be surmised, the references most\r\ncommonly asked for are those relating to different phases of the\r\nEvolution Theory; but the fact is usually overlooked by the inquirers\r\nthat some knowledge of other features of biological research is\r\nessential even to an intelligent comprehension of that theory.\r\n\r\nIn this sketch I have attempted to bring under one view the broad\r\nfeatures of biological progress, and to increase the human interest by\r\nwriting the story around the lives of the great Leaders. The practical\r\nexecution of the task resolved itself largely into the question of\r\nwhat to omit. The number of detailed researches upon which progress in\r\nbiology rests made rigid selection necessary, and the difficulties of\r\nseparating the essential from the less important, and of distinguishing\r\nbetween men of temporary notoriety and those of enduring fame, have\r\ngiven rise to no small perplexities.\r\n\r\nThe aim has been kept in mind to give a picture sufficiently\r\ndiagrammatic not to confuse the general reader, and it is hoped that\r\nthe omissions which have seemed necessary will, in a measure, be\r\ncompensated for by the clearness of the picture. References to selected\r\nbooks and articles have been given at the close of the volume, that\r\nwill enable readers who wish fuller information to go to the best\r\nsources.\r\n\r\nThe book is divided into two sections. In the first are considered\r\nthe sources of the ideas--except those of organic evolution--that\r\ndominate biology, and the steps by which they have been molded into\r\na unified science. The Doctrine of Organic Evolution, on account of\r\nits importance, is reserved for special consideration in the second\r\nsection. This is, of course, merely a division of convenience, since\r\nafter its acceptance the doctrine of evolution has entered into all\r\nphases of biological progress.\r\n\r\nThe portraits with which the text is illustrated embrace those of\r\nnearly all the founders of biology. Some of the rarer ones are\r\nunfamiliar even to biologists, and have been discovered only after long\r\nsearch in the libraries of Europe and America.\r\n\r\nAn orderly account of the rise of biology can hardly fail to be of\r\nservice to the class of inquirers mentioned in the opening paragraph.\r\nIt is hoped that this sketch will also meet some of the needs of the\r\nincreasing body of students who are doing practical work in biological\r\nlaboratories. It is important that such students, in addition to the\r\nusual classroom instruction, should get a perspective view of the way\r\nin which biological science has come into its present form.\r\n\r\nThe chief purpose of the book will have been met if I have succeeded\r\nin indicating the sources of biological ideas and the main currents\r\nalong which they have advanced, and if I have succeeded, furthermore,\r\nin making readers acquainted with those men of noble purpose whose work\r\nhas created the epochs of biological history, and in showing that there\r\nhas been continuity of development in biological thought.\r\n\r\nOf biologists who may examine this work with a critical purpose, I beg\r\nthat they will think of it merely as an outline sketch which does not\r\npretend to give a complete history of biological thought. The story has\r\nbeen developed almost entirely from the side of animal life; not that\r\nthe botanical side has been underestimated, but that the story can be\r\ntold from either side, and my first-hand acquaintance with botanical\r\ninvestigation is not sufficient to justify an attempt to estimate its\r\nparticular achievements.\r\n\r\nThe writer is keenly aware of the many imperfections in the book. It is\r\ninevitable that biologists with interests in special fields will miss\r\nfamiliar names and the mention of special pieces of notable work, but I\r\nam drawn to think that such omissions will be viewed leniently, by the\r\nconsideration that those best able to judge the shortcomings of this\r\nsketch will also best understand the difficulties involved.\r\n\r\nThe author wishes to acknowledge his indebtedness to several\r\npublishing houses and to individuals for permission to copy cuts and\r\nfor assistance in obtaining portraits. He takes this opportunity to\r\nexpress his best thanks for these courtesies. The parties referred to\r\nare the director of the American Museum of Natural History; D. Appleton\r\n& Co.; P.

It was then that the\r\nresults of the earlier efforts of mankind to interpret the mysteries\r\nof nature began to be fruitful; observers of organic nature began\r\nto see more deeply into the province of life, and, above all, began\r\nto see how to direct their future studies. It was in that century\r\nthat the use of the microscope made known the similarity in cellular\r\nconstruction of all organized beings; that the substance, protoplasm,\r\nbegan to be recognized as the physical basis of life and the seat of\r\nall vital activities; then, most contagious diseases were traced to\r\nmicroscopic organisms, and as a consequence, medicine and surgery were\r\nreformed; then the belief in the spontaneous origin of life under\r\npresent conditions was given up; and it was in that century that the\r\ndoctrine of organic evolution gained general acceptance. These and\r\nother advances less generally known created an atmosphere in which\r\nbiology--the great life-science--grew rapidly.\r\n\r\nIn the same period also the remains of ancient life, long since\r\nextinct, and for countless ages embedded in the rocks, were brought to\r\nlight, and their investigation assisted materially in understanding the\r\nliving forms and in tracing their genealogy.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these advances, animal organization began to have a\r\ndifferent meaning to the more discerning naturalists, those whose\r\ndiscoveries began to influence the trend of thought, and finally, the\r\nidea which had been so often previously expressed became a settled\r\nconviction, that all the higher forms of life are derived from simpler\r\nones by a gradual process of modification.\r\n\r\nBesides great progress in biology, the nineteenth century was\r\nremarkable for similar advances in physics and chemistry. Although\r\nthese subjects purport to deal with inorganic or lifeless nature, they\r\ntouch biology in an intimate way. The vital processes which take place\r\nin all animals and plants have been shown to be physico-chemical,\r\nand, as a consequence, one must go to both physics and chemistry in\r\norder to understand them. The study of organic chemistry in late\r\nyears has greatly influenced biology; not only have living products\r\nbeen analyzed, but some of them have already been constructed in the\r\nchemical laboratory. The formation of living matter through chemical\r\nmeans is still far from the thought of most chemists, but very complex\r\norganic compounds, which were formerly known only as the result of the\r\naction of life, have been produced, and the possibilities of further\r\nadvances in that direction are very alluring. It thus appears that\r\nthe discoveries in various fields have worked together for a better\r\ncomprehension of nature.\r\n\r\nThe Domain of Biology.--The history of the transformation of opinion in\r\nreference to living organisms is an interesting part of the story of\r\nintellectual development. The central subject that embraces it all is\r\nbiology. This is one of the fundamental sciences, since it embraces all\r\nquestions relating to life in its different phases and manifestations.\r\nEverything pertaining to the structure, the development, and the\r\nevolution of living organisms, as well as to their physiology,\r\nbelongs to biology. It is now of commanding importance in the world\r\nof science, and it is coming more and more to be recognized that it\r\noccupies a field of compelling interest not only for medical men and\r\nscholars, but for all intelligent people. The discoveries and conquests\r\nof biology have wrought such a revolution in thought that they should\r\nbe known to all persons of liberal culture. In addition to making\r\nacquaintance with the discoveries, one ought to learn something about\r\nthe history of biology; for it is essential to know how it took its\r\nrise, in order to understand its present position and the nature of its\r\ninfluence upon expanding ideas regarding the world in which we live.\r\n\r\nIn its modern sense, biology did not arise until about 1860, when the\r\nnature of protoplasm was first clearly pointed out by Max Schultze,\r\nbut the currents that united to form it had long been flowing, and\r\nwe can never understand the subject without going back to its iatric\r\ncondition, when what is now biology was in the germ and united with\r\nmedicine. Its separation from medicine, and its rise as an independent\r\nsubject, was owing to the steady growth of that zest for exploration\r\ninto unknown fields which began with the new birth of science in the\r\nsixteenth century, and has continued in fuller measure to the present.\r\nIt was the outcome of applying observation and experiment to the\r\nwinning of new truths.\r\n\r\nDifficulties.--But biology is so comprehensive a field, and involves\r\nso many details, that it is fair to inquire: can its progress be made\r\nclear to the reader who is unacquainted with it as a laboratory study?\r\nThe matter will be simplified by two general observations--first,\r\nthat the growth of biology is owing to concurrent progress in three\r\nfields of research, concerned, respectively, with the structure or\r\narchitecture of living beings, their development, and their physiology.\r\nWe recognize also a parallel advance in the systematic classification\r\nof animals and plants, and we note, furthermore, that the idea of\r\nevolution permeates the whole. It will be necessary to consider the\r\nadvances in these fields separately, and to indicate the union of the\r\nresults into the main channel of progress. Secondly, in attempting\r\nto trace the growth of ideas in this department of learning one\r\nsees that there has been a continuity of development. The growth of\r\nthese notions has not been that of a chaotic assemblage of ideas,\r\nbut a well-connected story in which the new is built upon the old in\r\norderly succession. The old ideas have not been completely superseded\r\nby the new, but they have been molded into new forms to keep pace\r\nwith the advance of investigation. In its early phases, the growth\r\nof biology was slow and discursive, but from the time of Linnæus to\r\nDarwin, although the details were greatly multiplied, there has been a\r\nrelatively simple and orderly progress.\r\n\r\nFacts and Ideas.--There are many books about biology, with directions\r\nfor laboratory observation and experiment, and also many of the leading\r\nfacts of the science have been given to the public, but an account\r\nof the growth of the ideas, which are interpretations of the facts,\r\nhas been rarely attempted. From the books referred to, it is almost\r\nimpossible to get an idea of biology as a unit; this even the students\r\nin our universities acquire only through a coherent presentation of the\r\nsubject in the classroom, on the basis of their work in the laboratory.\r\nThe critical training in the laboratory is most important, but, after\r\nall, it is only a part, although an essential part, of a knowledge of\r\nbiology. In general, too little attention is paid to interpretations\r\nand the drill is confined to a few facts. Now, the facts are related to\r\nthe ideas of the science as statistics to history--meaningless without\r\ninterpretation. In the rise of biology the facts have accumulated\r\nconstantly, through observation and experiment, but the general truths\r\nhave emerged slowly and periodically, whenever there has been granted\r\nto some mind an insight into the meaning of the facts. The detached\r\nfacts are sometimes tedious, the interpretations always interesting.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the knowledge of organic nature is a long story, full\r\nof human interest. Nature has been always the same, but the capacity\r\nof man as its interpreter has varied. He has had to pass through\r\nother forms of intellectual activity, and gradually to conquer other\r\nphases of natural phenomena, before entering upon that most difficult\r\ntask of investigating the manifestations of life. It will be readily\r\nunderstood, therefore, that biology was delayed in its development\r\nuntil after considerable progress had been made in other sciences.\r\n\r\nIt is an old saying that \"Truth is the daughter of Time,\" and no\r\nbetter illustration of it can be given than the long upward struggle\r\nto establish even the elemental truths of nature. It took centuries to\r\narrive at the conception of the uniformity of nature, and to reach any\r\nof those generalizations which are vaguely spoken of as the laws of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThe Men of Science.--In the progress of science there is an army of\r\nobservers and experimenters each contributing his share, but the rank\r\nand file supply mainly isolated facts, while the ideas take birth in\r\nthe minds of a few gifted leaders, either endowed with unusual insight,\r\nor so favored by circumstances that they reach general conclusions of\r\nimportance. These advance-guards of intellectual conquest we designate\r\nas founders. What were they like in appearance? Under what conditions\r\ndid they work, and what was their chief aim? These are interesting\r\nquestions which will receive attention as our narrative proceeds.\r\n\r\nA study of the lives of the founders shows that the scientific mood is\r\npre-eminently one of sincerity. The men who have added to the growth\r\nof science were animated by an unselfish devotion to truth, and their\r\nlasting influence has been in large measure a reflection of their\r\nindividual characters. Only those have produced permanent results\r\nwho have interrogated nature in the spirit of devotion to truth and\r\nwaited patiently for her replies. The work founded on selfish motives\r\nand vanity has sooner or later fallen by the wayside. We can recognize\r\nnow that the work of scientific investigation, subjected to so much\r\nhostile criticism as it appeared from time to time, was undertaken in\r\na reverent spirit, and was not iconoclastic, but remodelling in its\r\ninfluence. Some of the glories of our race are exhibited in the lives\r\nof the pioneers in scientific progress, in their struggles to establish\r\nsome great truth and to maintain intellectual integrity.\r\n\r\nThe names of some of the men of biology, such as Harvey, Linnæus,\r\nCuvier, Darwin, Huxley, and Pasteur, are widely known because their\r\nwork came before the people, but others equally deserving of fame on\r\naccount of their contributions to scientific progress will require an\r\nintroduction to most of our readers.\r\n\r\nIn recounting the story of the rise of biology, we shall have occasion\r\nto make the acquaintance of this goodly company. Before beginning the\r\nnarrative in detail, however, we shall look summarily at some general\r\nfeatures of scientific progress and at the epochs of biology.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Conditions under which Science Developed\r\n\r\nIn a brief sketch of biology there is relatively little in the ancient\r\nworld that requires notice except the work of Aristotle and Galen; but\r\nwith the advent of Vesalius, in 1543, our interest begins to freshen,\r\nand, thereafter, through lean times and fat times there is always\r\nsomething to command our attention.\r\n\r\nThe early conditions must be dealt with in order to appreciate what\r\nfollowed. We are to recollect that in the ancient world there was no\r\nscience of biology as such; nevertheless, the germ of it was contained\r\nin the medicine and the natural history of those times.\r\n\r\nThere is one matter upon which we should be clear: in the time of\r\nAristotle nature was studied by observation and experiment. This is\r\nthe foundation of all scientific advancement. Had conditions remained\r\nunchanged, there is reason to believe that science would have developed\r\nsteadily on the basis of the Greek foundation, but circumstances, to\r\nbe spoken of later, arose which led not only to the complete arrest of\r\ninquiry, but also, the mind of man being turned away from nature, to\r\nthe decay of science.\r\n\r\nAristotle the Founder of Natural History.--The Greeks represented\r\nthe fullest measure of culture in the ancient world, and, naturally,\r\nwe find among them the best-developed science. All the knowledge of\r\nnatural phenomena centered in Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), and for twenty\r\ncenturies he represented the highest level which that kind of knowledge\r\nhad attained.\r\n\r\nIt is uncertain how long it took the ancient observers to lift science\r\nto the level which it had at the beginning of Aristotle's period, but\r\nit is obvious that he must have had a long line of predecessors, who\r\nhad accumulated facts of observation and had molded them into a system\r\nbefore he perfected and developed that system. We are reminded that all\r\nthings are relative when we find Aristotle referring to the ancients;\r\nand well he might, for we have indubitable evidence that much of the\r\nscientific work of antiquity has been lost. One of the most striking\r\ndiscoveries pointing in that direction is the now famous papyrus which\r\nwas found by Georg Ebers in Egypt about 1860. The recent translation\r\nof this ancient document shows that it was a treatise on medicine,\r\ndating from the fifteenth century B.C. At this time the science of\r\nmedicine had attained an astonishingly high grade of development among\r\nthat people. And since it is safe to assume that the formulation of a\r\nsystem of medicine in the early days of mankind required centuries of\r\nobservation and practice, it becomes apparent that the manuscript in\r\nquestion was no vague, first attempt at reducing medicine to a system.\r\nIt is built upon much scientific knowledge, and must have been preceded\r\nby writings both on medicine and on its allied sciences.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary that we should attempt to picture the crude\r\nbeginnings of the observation of animated nature and the dawning of\r\nideas relative to animals and plants; it is suitable to our purpose to\r\ncommence with Aristotle, and to designate him, in a relative sense, as\r\nthe founder of natural history.\r\n\r\nThat he was altogether dissatisfied with the state of knowledge in his\r\ntime and that he had high ideals of the dignity of science is evidenced\r\nin his writings. Although he refers to the views of the ancients, he\r\nregarded himself in a sense as a pioneer. \"I found no basis prepared,\"\r\nhe says, \"no models to copy.... Mine is the first step, and therefore\r\na small one, though worked out with much thought and hard labor. It\r\nmust be looked at as a first step and judged with indulgence.\" (From\r\nOsborn's _From the Greeks to Darwin_.)\r\n\r\nThere is general agreement that Aristotle was a man of vast intellect\r\nand that he was one of the greatest philosophers of the ancient world.\r\nHe has had his detractors as well as his partisan adherents. Perhaps\r\nthe just estimate of his attainments and his position in the history\r\nof science is between the enthusiastic appreciation of Cuvier and the\r\ncritical estimate of Lewes.\r\n\r\nThis great man was born in Stagira in the year 384 B.C., and lived\r\nuntil 322 B.C. He is to be remembered as the most distinguished pupil\r\nof Plato, and as the instructor of Alexander the Great. Like other\r\nscholars of his time, he covered a wide range of subjects; we have\r\nmention, indeed, of about three hundred works of his composition, many\r\nof which are lost. He wrote on philosophy, metaphysics, psychology,\r\npolitics, rhetoric, etc., but it was in the domain of natural history\r\nthat he attained absolute pre-eminence.\r\n\r\nHis Position in the Development of Science.--It is manifestly unjust\r\nto measure Aristotle by present standards; we must keep always in mind\r\nthat he was a pioneer, and that he lived in an early day of science,\r\nwhen errors and crudities were to be expected. His greatest claim to\r\neminence in the history of science is that he conceived the things of\r\nimportance and that he adopted the right method in trying to advance\r\nthe knowledge of the natural universe. In his program of studies he\r\nsays: \"First we must understand the phenomena of animals; then assign\r\ntheir causes; and, finally, speak of their generation.\" His position\r\nin natural history is frequently misunderstood. One of the most recent\r\nwriters on the history of science, Henry Smith Williams, pictures\r\nhim entirely as a great classifier, and as the founder of systematic\r\nzoölogy. While it is true that he was the founder of systematic\r\nzoölogy, as such he did not do his greatest service to natural history,\r\nnor does the disposition to classify represent his dominant activity.\r\nIn all his work classification is made incidental and subservient to\r\nmore important considerations. His observations upon structure and\r\ndevelopment, and his anticipation of the idea of organic evolution, are\r\nthe ones upon which his great fame rests. He is not to be remembered as\r\na man of the type of Linnæus; rather is he the forerunner of those men\r\nwho looked deeper than Linnæus into the structure and development of\r\nanimal life--the morphologists.\r\n\r\nParticular mention of his classification of animals will be found\r\nin the chapter on Linnæus, while in what follows in this chapter\r\nattention will be confined to his observation of their structure and\r\ndevelopment and to the general influence of his work.\r\n\r\nHis great strength was in a philosophical treatment of the structure\r\nand development of animals. Professor Osborn in his interesting book,\r\n_From the Greeks to Darwin_, shows that Aristotle had thought out the\r\nessential features of evolution as a process in nature. He believed in\r\na complete gradation from the lowest organisms to the highest, and that\r\nman is the highest point of one long and continuous ascent.\r\n\r\nHis Extensive Knowledge of Animals.--He made extensive studies of\r\nlife histories. He knew that drone bees develop without previous\r\nfertilization of the eggs (by parthenogenesis); that in the squid\r\nthe yolk sac of the embryo is carried in front of the mouth; that\r\nsome sharks develop within the egg-tube of the mother, and in some\r\nspecies have a rudimentary blood-connection resembling the placenta of\r\nmammals. He had followed day by day the changes in the chick within\r\nthe hen's egg, and observed the development of many other animals.\r\nIn embryology also, he anticipated Harvey in appreciating the true\r\nnature of development as a process of gradual building, and not as the\r\nmere expansion of a previously formed germ. This doctrine, which is\r\nknown under the name of epigenesis, was, as we shall see later, hotly\r\ncontested in the eighteenth century, and has a modified application at\r\nthe present time.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the structure of animals he had described the tissues,\r\nand in a rude way analyzed the organs into their component parts. It is\r\nknown, furthermore, that he prepared plates of anatomical figures, but,\r\nunfortunately, these have been lost.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the contributions of ancient writers to science, it must\r\nbe remembered that we have but fragments of their works to examine. It\r\nis, moreover, doubtful whether the scientific writings ascribed to\r\nAristotle were all from his hand. The work is so uneven that Huxley has\r\nsuggested that, since the ancient philosophers taught _viva voce_, what\r\nwe have of his zoölogical writings may possibly be the notes of some of\r\nhis students. While this is not known to be the case, that hypothesis\r\nenables us to understand the intimate mixture of profound observation\r\nwith trivial matter and obvious errors that occur in the writings\r\nascribed to him.\r\n\r\nHertwig says: \"It is a matter for great regret that there have been\r\npreserved only parts of his three most important zoölogical works,\r\n'_Historia animalium_,' '_De partibus_,' and '_De generatione_,' works\r\nin which zoölogy is founded as a universal science, since anatomy and\r\nembryology, physiology and classification, find equal consideration.\"\r\n\r\nSome Errors.--Dissections were little practised in his day, and it must\r\nbe admitted that his observations embrace many errors. He supposed\r\nthe brain to be bloodless, the arteries to carry air, etc., but he\r\nhas been cleared by Huxley of the mistake so often attributed to him\r\nof supposing the heart of mammals to have only three chambers. It is\r\naltogether probable that he is credited with a larger number of errors\r\nthan is justified by the facts.\r\n\r\nHe must have had unusual gifts in the exposition of these technical\r\nsubjects; indeed, he made his researches appear so important to his\r\nroyal patron, Alexander, that he was aided in the preparation of\r\nhis great Natural History by a grant of 800 talents (equivalent to\r\n$200,000) and by numerous assistants and collectors. Thus in ancient\r\ntimes was anticipated the question that is being agitated to-day--that\r\nof the support and the endowment of research.\r\n\r\nPersonal Appearance.--Some idea of his looks may be gained from Fig.\r\n1. This is a copy of a bas-relief found in the collection of Fulvius\r\nUrsinus (d. 1600), and was originally published by J. Faber. Its\r\nauthenticity as a portrait is attested (1811) by Visconti, who says\r\nthat it has a perfect resemblance to the head of a small bust upon the\r\nbase of which the name of Aristotle is engraved. Portrait busts and\r\nstatues of Aristotle were common in ancient times. The picture of him\r\nmost familiar to general readers is the copy of the head and shoulders\r\nof an ancient statue representing him with a draping over the left\r\nshoulder. This is an attractive portrait, showing a face of strong\r\nintellectuality. Its authenticity, however, is not as well established\r\nas that of the picture shown here. Other pictures, believed to be those\r\nof Aristotle, represent him later in life with receding hair, and one\r\nexists in which his baldness is very extensive. He was described as\r\nshort in stature, with spindling legs and small, penetrating eyes, and\r\nto have been, in his younger days, vain and showy in his dress.\r\n\r\nHe was early left an orphan with a considerable fortune; and there\r\nare stories of early excesses after coming into his property. These\r\ncharges, however, lack trustworthy support, and are usually regarded\r\nas due mainly to that undermining gossip which follows one holding\r\nprominent place and enviable recognition. His habits seem to have\r\nbeen those of a diligent student with a zest in his work; he was an\r\nomnivorous reader, and Plato called him the mind of his school. His\r\nlarge private library and his manner of living bespeak the conserving\r\nof his property, rather than its waste in selfish indulgences.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Aristotle, 384-322 B.C.]\r\n\r\nHis Influence.--The influence of Aristotle was in the right direction.\r\nHe made a direct appeal to nature for his facts, and founded his\r\nNatural History only on observation of the structure, physiology, and\r\ndevelopment of animals. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of his\r\nsuccessors.\r\n\r\nGalen, who is mentioned above in connection with Aristotle, was a\r\nmedical writer and the greatest anatomist of antiquity. On account\r\nof the relation of his work to the growth of anatomy, however, the\r\nconsideration of it is reserved for the chapter on Vesalius.\r\n\r\nSoon after the period of Aristotle the center of scientific\r\ninvestigation was transferred to Alexandria, where Ptolemy had erected\r\na great museum and founded a large public library. Here mathematics and\r\ngeography flourished, but natural history was little cultivated.\r\n\r\nIn order to find the next famous naturalist of antiquity, it is\r\nnecessary to look to Rome. Rome, although great in political power,\r\nnever became a true culture center, characterized by originality. All\r\nthat remains of their thought shows us that the Roman people were not\r\ncreative. In the capital of the empire, the center of its life, there\r\narose no great scientific investigator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Pliny, 23-79 A.D.]\r\n\r\nPliny.--The situation is represented by Pliny the Elder (23-79\r\nA.D.), Roman general and littérateur (Fig. 2). His works on natural\r\nhistory, filling thirty-seven volumes, have been preserved with\r\ngreater completeness than those of other ancient writers. Their\r\noverwhelming bulk seems to have produced an impression upon those who,\r\nin the nineteenth century, heralded him as the greatest naturalist\r\nof antiquity. But an examination of his writings shows that he did\r\nnothing to deepen or broaden the knowledge of nature, and his Natural\r\nHistory marks a distinct retrograde movement. He was, at best, merely\r\na compiler--\"a collector of anecdotes\"--who, forsaking observation,\r\nindiscriminately mixed fable, fact, and fancy taken from the writings\r\nof others. He emphasized the feature of classification which Aristotle\r\nhad held in proper subordination, and he replaced the classification\r\nof Aristotle, founded on plan of organization, by a highly artificial\r\none, founded on the incidental circumstance of the abodes of\r\nanimals--either in air, water, or on the earth.\r\n\r\nThe Arrest of Inquiry and its Effects.--Thus, natural history,\r\ntransferred from a Greek to a Roman center, was already on the decline\r\nin the time of Pliny; but it was destined to sink still lower. It\r\nis an old, oft-repeated story how, with the overthrow of ancient\r\ncivilization, the torch of learning was nearly extinguished. Not only\r\nwas there a complete political revolution; there was also a complete\r\nchange in the mental interests of mankind. The situation is so complex\r\nthat it is difficult to state it with clearness. So far as science is\r\nconcerned, its extinction was due to a turning away from the external\r\nworld, and a complete arrest of inquiry into the phenomena of nature.\r\nThis was an important part of that somber change which came over all\r\nmental life.\r\n\r\nOne of the causes that played a considerable part in the cessation of\r\nscientific investigation was the rise of the Christian church and the\r\ndominance of the priesthood in all intellectual as well as in spiritual\r\nlife. The world-shunning spirit, so scrupulously cultivated by the\r\nearly Christians, prompted a spirit which was hostile to observation.\r\nThe behest to shun the world was acted upon too literally. The eyes\r\nwere closed to nature and the mind was directed toward spiritual\r\nmatters, which truly seemed of higher importance. Presently, the\r\nobservation of nature came to be looked upon as proceeding from a\r\nprying and impious curiosity.\r\n\r\nBooks were now scarcer than during the classical period; the schools\r\nof philosophy were reduced, and the dissemination of learning\r\nceased. The priests who had access to the books assumed direction of\r\nintellectual life. But they were largely employed with the analysis\r\nof the supernatural, without the wholesome check of observation and\r\nexperiment; mystical explanations were invented for natural phenomena,\r\nwhile metaphysical speculation became the dominant form of mental\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nAuthority Declared the Source of Knowledge.--In this atmosphere\r\ncontroversies over trivial points were engendered, and the ancient\r\nwritings were quoted as sustaining one side or the other. All this led\r\nto the referring of questions as to their truth or error to authority\r\nas the source of knowledge, and resulted in a complete eclipse of\r\nreason. Amusing illustrations of the situation are abundant; as when,\r\nin the Middle Ages, the question of the number of teeth in the horse\r\nwas debated with great heat in many contentious writings. Apparently\r\nnone of the contestants thought of the simple expedient of counting\r\nthem, but tried only to sustain their position by reference to\r\nauthority. Again, one who noticed spots on the sun became convinced of\r\nthe error of his eyes because Aristotle had somewhere written \"The face\r\nof the sun is immaculate.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a barren period not only for science, but also for\r\necclesiastical advance. Notwithstanding the fact that for more than\r\na thousand years the only new works were written by professional\r\ntheologians, there was no substantial advance in their field, and we\r\ncannot escape the reflection that the reciprocal action of free inquiry\r\nis essential to the growth of theology as of other departments of\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\nIn the period from the downfall of Rome to the revival of learning, one\r\neminent theologian, St. Augustine, stands in relief for the openness\r\nof his mind to new truth and for his expressions upon the relation of\r\nrevelation in the Scriptures to the observation of nature. His position\r\nwill be more clearly indicated in the chapter dealing with the rise of\r\nevolutionary thought.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it has been the disposition of historians to paint the\r\nMiddle Ages in too dark colors in order to provide a background on\r\nwhich fitly to portray the subsequent awakening. It was a remolding\r\nperiod through which it was necessary to pass after the overthrow\r\nof ancient civilization and the mixture of the less advanced people\r\nof the North with those of the South. The opportunities for advance\r\nwere greatly circumscribed; the scarcity of books and the lack\r\nof facilities for travel prevented any general dissemination of\r\nlearning, while the irresponsible method of the time, of appealing\r\nto authority on all questions, threw a barrier across the stream of\r\nprogress. Intellectuality was not, however, entirely crushed during\r\nthe prevalence of these conditions. The medieval philosophers were\r\nmasters of the metaphysical method of argument, and their mentality was\r\nby no means dull. While some branches of learning might make a little\r\nadvance, the study of nature suffered the most, for the knowledge\r\nof natural phenomena necessitates a mind turned outward in direct\r\nobservation of the phenomena of the natural and physical universe.\r\n\r\nRenewal of Observation.--It was an epoch of great importance,\r\ntherefore, when men began again to observe, and to attempt, even in\r\nan unskilful way, hampered by intellectual inheritance and habit, to\r\nunravel the mysteries of nature and to trace the relation between\r\ncauses and effects in the universe. This new movement was a revolt of\r\nthe intellect against existing conditions. In it were locked up all the\r\nbenefits that have accrued from the development of modern science. Just\r\nas the decline had been due to many causes, so also the general revival\r\nwas complex. The invention of printing, the voyages of mariners, the\r\nrise of universities, and the circulation of ideas consequent upon\r\nthe Crusades, all helped to disseminate the intellectual ferment.\r\nThese generic influences aided in molding the environment, but, just\r\nas the pause in science had been due to the turning away from nature\r\nand to new mental interests, so the revival was a return to nature and\r\nto the method of science. The pioneers had to be men of determined\r\nindependence; they labored against self-interest as well as opposition\r\nfrom the church and the priesthood, and they withstood the terrors of\r\nthe Inquisition and the loss of recognition and support.\r\n\r\nIn this uncongenial atmosphere men like Galileo, Descartes, and\r\nVesalius established the new movement and overthrew the reign of\r\nauthority. With the coming of Vesalius the new era of biological\r\nprogress was opened, but its growth was a slow one; a growth of which\r\nwe are now to be concerned in tracing the main features.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Epochs in Biological History\r\n\r\nIt will be helpful to outline the great epochs of biological progress\r\nbefore taking them up for fuller consideration. The foundation of\r\nprogress was the renewal of observation in which, as already stated,\r\nall modern science was locked up.\r\n\r\nIt was an epoch in biological history when Vesalius overthrew the\r\nauthority of Galen, and studied at first hand the organization of the\r\nhuman body.\r\n\r\nIt was an epoch when William Harvey, by adding experiment to\r\nobservation, demonstrated the circulation of the blood and created a\r\nnew physiology. The two coördinate branches of biology were thus early\r\noutlined.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the microscope, mainly through the labors of\r\nGrew, Hooke, Malpighi, and Leeuwenhoek, opened a new world to the\r\ninvestigator, and the work of these men marks an epoch in the progress\r\nof independent inquiry.\r\n\r\nLinnæus, by introducing short descriptions and uniform names for\r\nanimals and plants, greatly advanced the subject of natural history.\r\n\r\nCuvier, by founding the school of comparative anatomy, so furthered the\r\nknowledge of the organization of animals that he created an epoch.\r\n\r\nBichat, his great contemporary, created another by laying the\r\nfoundation of our knowledge of the structure of animal tissues.\r\n\r\nVon Baer, by his studies of the development of animal life, supplied\r\nwhat was lacking in the work of Cuvier and Bichat and originated modern\r\nembryology.\r\n\r\nHaller, in the eighteenth, and Johannes Müller in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, so added to the ground work of Harvey that physiology was made\r\nan independent subject and was established on modern lines.\r\n\r\nWith Buffon, Erasmus Darwin,, and Lamarck began an epoch in\r\nevolutionary thought which had its culminating point in the work of\r\nCharles Darwin.\r\n\r\nAfter Cuvier and Bichat came the establishing of the cell-theory, which\r\ncreated an epoch and influenced all further progress.\r\n\r\nFinally, through the discovery of protoplasm and the recognition that\r\nit is the seat of all vital activity, arrived the epoch which brought\r\nus to the threshold of the biology of the present day.\r\n\r\nStep by step naturalists have been led from the obvious and superficial\r\nfacts about living organisms to the deep-lying basis of all vital\r\nmanifestations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nVESALIUS AND THE OVERTHROW OF AUTHORITY IN SCIENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nVesalius, although an anatomist, is to be recognized in a broad\r\nsense as one of the founders of biology. When one is attempting to\r\ninvestigate animal and plant life, not only must he become acquainted\r\nwith the external appearance of living organisms, but also must\r\nacquire early a knowledge of their structure, without which other\r\nfacts relating to their lives can not be disclosed. Anatomy, which\r\nis the science of the structure of organized beings, is therefore so\r\nfundamental that we find ourselves involved in tracing the history of\r\nits rise as one part of the story of biology. But it is not enough\r\nto know how animals and plants are constructed; we must also know\r\nsomething about the purpose of the structures and of the life that\r\ncourses through them, and, accordingly, after considering the rise of\r\nanatomy, we must take a similar view of its counterpart, physiology.\r\n\r\nThe great importance of Vesalius in the history of science lies in\r\nthe fact that he overthrew adherence to authority as the method of\r\nascertaining truth, and substituted therefor observation and reason.\r\nSeveral of his forerunners had tried to accomplish the same end, but\r\nthey had failed. He was indebted to them as every man is indebted\r\nto his forebears, but at the same time we can not fail to see that\r\nVesalius was worthy of the victory. He was more resolute and forceful\r\nthan any of his predecessors. He was one of those rare spirits who see\r\nnew truth with clearness, and have the bravery to force their thoughts\r\non an unsympathetic public.\r\n\r\nThe Beginning of Anatomy.--In order to appreciate his service it is\r\nnecessary to give a brief account of his predecessors, and of the\r\ncondition of anatomy in his time. Remembering that anatomy embraces\r\na knowledge of the architecture of all animals and plants, we can,\r\nnevertheless, see why in early times its should have had more narrow\r\nboundaries. The medical men were the first to take an interest in the\r\nstructure of the human body, because a knowledge of it is necessary for\r\nmedicine and surgery. It thus happens that the earliest observations in\r\nanatomy were directed toward making known the structure of the human\r\nbody and that of animals somewhat closely related to man in point of\r\nstructure. Anatomical studies, therefore, began with the more complex\r\nanimals instead of the simpler ones, and, later, when comparative\r\nanatomy began to be studied, this led to many misunderstandings; since\r\nthe structure of man became the type to which all others were referred,\r\nwhile, on account of his derivation, his structure presents the\r\ngreatest modification of the vertebrate type.\r\n\r\nIt was so difficult in the early days to get an opportunity to study\r\nthe human body that the pioneer anatomists were obliged to gain their\r\nknowledge by dissections of animals, as the dog, and occasionally the\r\nmonkey. In this way Aristotle and his forerunners learned much about\r\nanatomy. About 300 B.C., the dissection of the human body was legalized\r\nin the Alexandrian school, the bodies of condemned criminals being\r\ndevoted to that purpose. But this did not become general even for\r\nmedical practitioners, and anatomy continued to be studied mainly from\r\nbrute animals.\r\n\r\nGalen.--The anatomist of antiquity who outshines all others was Galen\r\n(Claudius Galenus, 130-200 A.D.), who lived some time in Pergamos, and\r\nfor five years in Rome, during the second century of the Christian\r\nera. He was a man of much talent, both as an observer and as a writer.\r\nHis descriptions were clear and forceful, and for twelve centuries\r\nhis works exerted the greatest influence of those of all scientific\r\nwriters. In his writings was gathered all the anatomical knowledge of\r\nhis predecessors, to which he had added observations of his own. He was\r\na man of originality, but not having the human body for dissection, he\r\nerred in expounding its structure \"on the faith of observations made\r\non lower animals.\" He used the right method in arriving at his facts.\r\nHuxley says: \"No one can read Galen's works without being impressed\r\nwith the marvelous extent and diversity of his knowledge, and by his\r\nclear grasp of those experimental methods by which alone physiology can\r\nbe advanced.\"\r\n\r\nAnatomy in the Middle Ages.--But now we shall see how the arrest\r\nof inquiry already spoken of operated in the field of anatomy. The\r\ncondition of anatomy in the Middle Ages was the condition of all\r\nscience in the same period. From its practical importance anatomy had\r\nto be taught to medical men, while physics and chemistry, biology\r\nand comparative anatomy remained in an undeveloped state. The way in\r\nwhich this science was taught is a feature which characterizes the\r\nintellectual life of the Middle Ages. Instead of having anatomy taught\r\nby observations, the writings of Galen were expounded from the desk,\r\nfrequently without demonstrations of any kind. Thus his work came to\r\nbe set up as the one unfailing authority on anatomical knowledge.\r\nThis was in accord with the dominant ecclesiastical influence of the\r\ntime. Reference to authority was the method of the theologians, and\r\nby analogy it became the method of all learning. As the Scriptures\r\nwere accepted as the unfailing guide to spiritual truth, so Galen\r\nand other ancient writers were made the guides to scientific truth\r\nand thought. The baneful effects of this in stifling inquiry and in\r\nreducing knowledge to parrot-like repetition of ancient formulas are\r\nso obvious that they need not be especially dwelt upon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Galen, 131-200.\r\n\r\nFrom _Acta Medicorum Berolinensium_, 1715.]\r\n\r\nPredecessors of Vesalius.--Italy gave birth to the first anatomists who\r\nled a revolt against this slavery to authority in scientific matters.\r\nOf the eminent anatomists who preceded Vesalius it will be necessary to\r\nmention only three. Mundinus, or Mondino, professor at the University\r\nof Bologna, who, in the early part of the fourteenth century, dissected\r\nthree bodies, published in 1315 a work founded upon human dissection.\r\nHe was a man of originality whose work created a sensation in the\r\nmedical world, but did not supersede Galen's. His influence, although\r\nexerted in the right direction, was not successful in establishing\r\nobservation as the method of teaching anatomy. His book, however, was\r\nsometimes used as an introduction to Galen's writings or in conjunction\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nThe next man who requires notice is Berengarius of Carpi, who was\r\na professor in the University of Bologna in the early part of the\r\nsixteenth century. He is said to have dissected not less than one\r\nhundred human bodies; and although his opportunities for practical\r\nstudy were greater than those of Mondino, his attempts to place the\r\nscience of anatomy upon a higher level were also unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nWe pass now from Italy to France, where Sylvius (1478-1555), one of\r\nthe teachers of Vesalius, made his mark. His name is preserved to-day\r\nin the _fissure of Sylvius_ in the brain, but he was not an original\r\ninvestigator, and he succeeded only in \"making a reputation to which\r\nhis researches do not entitle him.\" He was a selfish, avaricious man\r\nwhose adoption of anatomy was not due to scientific interest, but to\r\na love of gain. At the age of fifty he forsook the teaching of the\r\nclassics for the money to be made by teaching anatomy. He was a blind\r\nadmirer of Galen, and read his works to medical students without\r\ndissections, except that from time to time dogs were brought into the\r\namphitheater and their structure exposed by unskilled barbers.\r\n\r\nVesalius.--Vesalius now came upon the scene; and through his efforts,\r\nbefore he was thirty years of age, the idol of authority had been\r\nshattered, and, mainly through his persistence, the method of so\r\ngreat moment to future ages had been established. He was well fitted\r\nto do battle against tradition--strong in body, in mind, and in\r\npurpose, gifted and forceful; and, furthermore, his work was marked by\r\nconcentration and by the high moral quality of fidelity to truth.\r\n\r\nVesalius was born in Brussels on the last day of the year 1514, of\r\nan ancestry of physicians and learned men, from whom he inherited\r\nhis leaning toward scientific pursuits. Early in life he exhibited\r\na passion for anatomy; he dissected birds, rabbits, dogs, and other\r\nanimals. Although having a strong bent in this direction, he was not a\r\nman of single talent. He was schooled in all the learning of his time,\r\nand his earliest publication was a translation from the Greek of the\r\nninth book of _Rhazes_. After his early training at Brussels and at the\r\nUniversity of Louvain, in 1533, at the age of 18, he went to Paris to\r\nstudy medicine, where, in anatomy, he came under Sylvius and Günther.\r\n\r\nHis Force and Independence.--His impetuous nature was shown in the\r\namphitheatre of Sylvius, where, at the third lecture, he pushed\r\naside the clumsy surgeon barbers, and himself exposed the parts as\r\nthey should be. He could not be satisfied with the exposition of the\r\nprinted page; he must see with his own eyes, must grasp through his own\r\nexperience the facts of anatomical structure. This demand of his nature\r\nshows not only how impatient he was with sham, but also how much more\r\nhe was in touch with reality than were the men of his time.\r\n\r\nAfter three years at the French capital, owing to wars in Belgium,\r\nhe went back to Louvain without obtaining his medical degree. After a\r\nshort experience as surgeon on the field of battle, he went to Padua,\r\nwhither he was attracted by reports of the opportunities for practical\r\ndissection that he so much desired to undertake. There his talents were\r\nrecognized, and just after receiving his degree of Doctor of Medicine\r\nin 1537, he was given a post in surgery, with the care of anatomy, in\r\nthe university.\r\n\r\nHis Reform of the Teaching of Anatomy.--The sympathetic and graphic\r\ndescription of this period of his career by Sir Michael Foster is so\r\ngood that I can not refrain from quoting it: \"He at once began to teach\r\nanatomy in his own new way. Not to unskilled, ignorant barbers would\r\nhe entrust the task of laying bare before the students the secrets of\r\nthe human frame; his own hand, and his own hand alone, was cunning\r\nenough to track out the pattern of the structures which day by day\r\nwere becoming more clear to him. Following venerated customs, he began\r\nhis academic labors by 'reading' Galen, as others had done before him,\r\nusing his dissections to illustrate what Galen had said. But, time\r\nafter time, the body on the table said something different from that\r\nwhich Galen had written.\r\n\r\n\"He tried to do what others had done before him--he tried to believe\r\nGalen rather than his own eyes, but his eyes were too strong for him;\r\nand in the end he cast Galen and his writings to the winds, and taught\r\nonly what he himself had seen and what he could make his students see,\r\ntoo. Thus he brought into anatomy the new spirit of the time, and the\r\nmen of the time, the young men of the time, answered the new voice.\r\nStudents flocked to his lectures; his hearers amounted, it is said, to\r\nsome five hundred, and an enlightened senate recognized his worth by\r\nrepeatedly raising his emoluments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Vesalius, 1514-1564.]\r\n\r\n\"Five years he thus spent in untiring labors at Padua. Five years\r\nhe wrought, not weaving a web of fancied thought, but patiently\r\ndisentangling the pattern of the texture of the human body, trusting to\r\nthe words of no master, admitting nothing but that which he himself had\r\nseen; and at the end of the five years, in 1542, while he was as yet\r\nnot twenty-eight years of age, he was able to write the dedication to\r\nCharles V of a folio work entitled the 'Structure of the Human Body,'\r\nadorned with many plates and woodcuts which appeared at Basel in the\r\nfollowing year, 1543.\"\r\n\r\nHis Physiognomy.--This classic with the Latin title, _De Humani\r\nCorporis Fabrica_, requires some special notice; but first let us\r\nhave a portrait of Vesalius, the master. Fig. 4 shows a reproduction\r\nof the portrait with which his work is provided. He is represented in\r\nacademic costume, probably that which he wore at lectures, in the act\r\nof demonstrating the muscles of the arm. The picture is reduced, and in\r\nthe reduction loses something of the force of the original. We see a\r\nstrong, independent, self-willed countenance; what his features lack in\r\nrefinement they make up in force; not an artistic or poetic face, but\r\nthe face of the man of action with scholarly training.\r\n\r\nHis Great Book.--The book of Vesalius laid the foundation of modern\r\nbiological science. It is more than a landmark in the progress\r\nof science--it created an epoch. It is not only interesting\r\nhistorically, but on account of the highly artistic plates with\r\nwhich it is illustrated it is interesting to examine by one not an\r\nanatomist. For executing the plates Vesalius secured the service\r\nof a fellow-countryman, John Stephen de Calcar, who was one of the\r\nmost gifted pupils of Titian. The drawings are of such high artistic\r\nquality that for a long time they were ascribed to Titian. The artist\r\nhas attempted to soften the necessarily prosaic nature of anatomical\r\nillustrations by introducing an artistic background of landscape of\r\nvaried features, with bridges, roads, streams, buildings, etc. The\r\nemployment of a background even in portrait-painting was not uncommon\r\nin the same century, as in Leonardo da Vinci's well-known Mona Lisa,\r\nwith its suggestive perspective of water, rocks, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Anatomical Sketch from Vesalius's _Fabrica_.\r\n\r\n(Photographed and reduced from the facsimile edition of 1728.)]\r\n\r\nFig. 5 will give an idea on a small scale of one of the plates\r\nillustrating the work of Vesalius. The plates in the original are of\r\nfolio size, and represent a colossal figure in the foreground, with a\r\nbackground showing between the limbs and at the sides of the figure.\r\nThere is considerable variety as regards the background, no two plates\r\nbeing alike.\r\n\r\nAlso, in delineating the skeleton, the artist has given to it an\r\nartistic pose, as is shown in Fig. 6, but nevertheless the bones\r\nare well drawn. No plates of equal merit had appeared before these;\r\nin fact, they are the earliest generally known drawings in anatomy,\r\nalthough woodcuts representing anatomical figures were published as\r\nearly as 1491 by John Ketham. Ketham's figures showed only externals\r\nand preparations for opening the body, but rude woodcuts representing\r\ninternal anatomy and the human skeleton had been published notably by\r\nMagnus Hundt, 1501; Phrysen, 1518; and Berengarius, 1521 and 1523.\r\nLeonardo da Vinci and other artists had also executed anatomical\r\ndrawings before the time of Vesalius.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the publication of the complete work, Vesalius, in 1538,\r\nhad published six tables of anatomy, and, in 1555, he brought out a\r\nnew edition of the _Fabrica_, with slight additions, especially in\r\nreference to physiology, which will be adverted to in the chapter on\r\nHarvey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--The Skeleton, from Vesalius's _Fabrica_.]\r\n\r\nIn the original edition of 1543 the illustrations are not collected in\r\nthe form of plates, but are distributed through the text, the larger\r\nones making full-page (folio) illustrations. In this edition also\r\nthe chapters are introduced with an initial letter showing curious\r\nanatomical figures in miniature, some of which are shown in Fig. 7.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Initial letters from Vesalius's _Fabrica_ of\r\n1543.]\r\n\r\nThe _Fabrica_ of Vesalius was a piece of careful, honest work, the\r\nmoral influence of which must not be overlooked. At any moment in\r\nthe world's history, work marked by sincerity exercises a wholesome\r\ninfluence, but at this particular stage of intellectual development\r\nsuch work was an innovation, and its significance for progress was\r\nwider and deeper than it might have been under different circumstances.\r\n\r\nOpposition to Vesalius.--The beneficent results of his efforts were to\r\nunfold afterward, since, at the time, his utterances were vigorously\r\nopposed from all sides. Not only did the ecclesiastics contend that he\r\nwas disseminating false and harmful doctrine, but the medical men from\r\nwhom he might have expected sympathy and support violently opposed his\r\nteachings.\r\n\r\nMany amusing arguments were brought forward to discredit Vesalius, and\r\nto uphold the authority of Galen. Vesalius showed that in the human\r\nbody the lower jaw is a single bone--that it is not divided as it is\r\nin the dog and other lower mammals, and, as Galen had taught, also\r\nin the human subjects. He showed that the sternum, or breast bone,\r\nhas three parts instead of eight; he showed that the thigh bones are\r\nstraight and not curved, as they are in the dog. Sylvius, his old\r\nteacher, was one of his bitterest opponents; he declared that the human\r\nbody had undergone changes in structure since the time of Galen, and,\r\nwith the object of defending the ancient anatomist, \"he asserted that\r\nthe straight thigh bones, which, as every one saw, were not curved in\r\naccordance with the teaching of Galen, were the result of the narrow\r\ntrousers of his contemporaries, and that they must have been curved in\r\ntheir natural condition, when uninterfered with by art!\"\r\n\r\nThe theologians also found other points for contention. It was a\r\nwidely accepted dogma that man should have one less rib on one side,\r\nbecause from the Scriptural account Eve was formed from one of Adam's\r\nribs. This, of course, Vesalius did not find to be the case. It was\r\nalso generally believed at this time that there was in the body an\r\nindestructible resurrection-bone which formed the nucleus of the\r\nresurrection-body. Vesalius said that he would leave the question of\r\nthe existence of such a bone to be decided by the theologians, as it\r\ndid not appear to him to be an anatomical question.\r\n\r\nThe Court Physician.--The hand of the church was heavy upon him, and\r\nthe hatred shown in attacks from various quarters threw Vesalius into\r\na state of despondency and anger. In this frame of mind he destroyed\r\nmanuscripts upon which he had expended much labor. His disappointment\r\nin the reception of his work probably had much to do in deciding\r\nhim to relinquish his professorship and accept the post of court\r\nphysician to Charles V of the United Kingdoms of Spain and Belgium.\r\nAfter the death of Charles, he remained with Philip II, who succeeded\r\nto the throne. Here he waxed rich and famous, but he was always under\r\nsuspicion by the clerical powers, who from time to time found means\r\nof discrediting him. The circumstances of his leaving Spain are not\r\ndefinitely known. One account has it that he made a _post-mortem_\r\nexamination of a body which showed signs of life during the operation,\r\nand that he was required to undertake a pilgrimage to the Holy Land\r\nto clear his soul of sacrilege. Whether or not this was the reason\r\nis uncertain, but after nineteen years at the Spanish Court he left,\r\nin 1563, and journeyed to Jerusalem. On his return from Palestine he\r\nsuffered shipwreck and died from the effects of exposure on Zanti, one\r\nof the Ionian Islands. It is also said that while on this pilgrimage he\r\nhad been offered the position of professor of anatomy as successor to\r\nFallopius, who had died in 1563, and that, had he lived, he would have\r\ncome back honorably to his old post.\r\n\r\nEustachius and Fallopius.--The work of two of his contemporaries,\r\nEustachius and Fallopius, requires notice. Cuvier says in his _Histoire\r\ndes Sciences Naturelles_ that those three men were the founders of\r\nmodern anatomy. Vesalius was a greater man than either of the other\r\ntwo, and his influence was more far-reaching. He reformed the entire\r\nfield of anatomy, while the names of Eustachius and Fallopius are\r\nconnected especially with a smaller part of the field. Eustachius\r\ndescribed the Eustachian tube of the ear and gave especial attention to\r\nsense organs; Fallopius made special investigations upon the viscera,\r\nand described the Fallopian tube.\r\n\r\nFallopius was a suave, polite man, who became professor of anatomy at\r\nPadua; he opposed Vesalius, but his attacks were couched in respectful\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nEustachius, the professor of anatomy at Rome, was of a different\r\ntype, a harsh, violent man, who assailed Vesalius with virulence.\r\nHe corrected some mistakes of Vesalius, and prepared new plates on\r\nanatomy, which, however, were not published until 1754, and therefore\r\ndid not exert the influence upon anatomical studies that those of\r\nVesalius did.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Fallopius, 1523-1563.]\r\n\r\nThe Especial Service of Vesalius.--It should be remembered that both\r\nthese men had the advantage of the sketches made under the direction\r\nof Vesalius. Pioneers and path-breakers are under special limitations\r\nof being in a new territory, and make more errors than they would in\r\nfollowing another's survey of the same territory; it takes much less\r\ncreative force to correct the errors of a first survey than to make the\r\noriginal discoveries. Everything considered, Vesalius is deserving of\r\nthe position assigned to him. He was great in a larger sense, and it\r\nwas his researches in particular which re-established scientific method\r\nand made further progress possible. His errors were corrected, not by\r\nan appeal to authority, but by the method which he founded. His great\r\nclaim to renown is, not that his work outshone all other work (that of\r\nGalen in particular) in accuracy and brilliancy, but that he overthrew\r\ndependence on authority and re-established the scientific method of\r\nascertaining truth. It was the method of Aristotle and Galen given anew\r\nto the world.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of progress was now released from bondage, but we have still\r\na long way to go under its guidance to reach the gateway of modern\r\nbiology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HARVEY AND EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATION\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the splendid observations of Vesalius, revealing in a new light\r\nthe construction of the human body, Harvey took the next general step\r\nby introducing experiment to determine the use or purpose of the\r\nstructures that Vesalius had so clearly exposed. Thus the work of\r\nHarvey was complemental to that of Vesalius, and we may safely say\r\nthat, taken together, the work of these two men laid the foundations of\r\nthe modern method of investigating nature. The results they obtained,\r\nand the influence of their method, are of especial interest to us in\r\nthe present connection, inasmuch as they stand at the beginning of\r\nbiological science after the Renaissance. Although the observations of\r\nboth were applied mainly to the human body, they served to open the\r\nentire field of structural studies and of experimental observations on\r\nliving organisms.\r\n\r\nMany of the experiments of Harvey, notably those relating to the\r\nmovements of the heart, were, of course, conducted upon the lower\r\nanimals, as the frog, the dog, etc. His experiments on the living\r\nhuman body consisted mainly in applying ligatures to the arms and the\r\nlegs. Nevertheless, the results of all his experiments related to the\r\nphenomena of the circulation in the human body, and were primarily for\r\nthe use of medical men.\r\n\r\nIn what sense the observations of the two men were complemental will be\r\nbetter understood when we remember that there are two aspects in which\r\nliving organisms should always be considered in biological studies;\r\nfirst, the structure, and, then, the use that the structures subserve.\r\nOne view is essential to the other, and no investigation of animals and\r\nplants is complete in which the two ideas are not involved. Just as a\r\nknowledge of the construction of a machine is necessary to understand\r\nits action, so the anatomical analysis of an organ must precede a\r\nknowledge of its office. The term \"physiological anatomy of an organ,\"\r\nso commonly used in text-books on physiology, illustrates the point.\r\nWe can not appreciate the work of such an organ as the liver without\r\na knowledge of the arrangement of its working units. The work of the\r\nanatomist concerns the statics of the body, that of the physiologist\r\nthe dynamics; properly combined, they give a complete picture of the\r\nliving organism.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered that the observations of Vesalius were not\r\nconfined exclusively to structure; he made some experiments and some\r\ncomments on the use of parts of the body, but his work was mainly\r\nstructural, while that which distinguishes Harvey's research is\r\ninductions founded on experimental observation of the action of living\r\ntissues.\r\n\r\nThe service of Vesalius and Harvey in opening the path to biological\r\nadvance is very conspicuous, but they were not the only pioneers;\r\ntheir work was a part of the general revival of science in which\r\nGalileo, Descartes, and others had their part. While the birth of the\r\nexperimental method was not due to the exertions of Harvey alone,\r\nnevertheless it should stand to his credit that he established that\r\nmethod in biological lines. Aristotle and Galen both had employed\r\nexperiments in their researches, and Harvey's step was in the nature of\r\na revival of the method of the old Greeks.\r\n\r\nHarvey's Education.--Harvey was fitted both by native talent and by his\r\ntraining for the part which he played in the intellectual awakening.\r\nHe was born at Folkestone, on the south coast of England, in 1578, the\r\nson of a prosperous yeoman. The Harvey family was well esteemed, and\r\nthe father of William was at one time the mayor of Folkestone. Young\r\nHarvey, after five years in the King's school at Canterbury, went to\r\nCambridge, and in 1593, at the age of sixteen, entered Caius College.\r\nHe had already shown a fondness for observations upon the organization\r\nof animals, but it is unlikely that he was able to cultivate this at\r\nthe university. There his studies consisted mainly of Latin and Greek,\r\nwith some training in debate and elementary instruction in the science\r\nof physics.\r\n\r\nAt Padua.--In 1597, at the age of nineteen, he was graduated with the\r\nArts degree, and the following year he turned his steps toward Italy\r\nin search of the best medical instruction that could be found at that\r\ntime in all the world. He selected the great university of Padua as\r\nhis place of sojourn, being attracted thither by the fame of some of\r\nits medical teachers. He was particularly fortunate in receiving his\r\ninstruction in anatomy and physiology from Fabricius, one of the most\r\nlearned and highly honored teachers in Italy. The fame of this master\r\nof medicine, who, from his birthplace, is usually given the full name\r\nof Fabricius _ab Aquapendente_, had spread to the intellectual centers\r\nof the world, where his work as anatomist and surgeon was especially\r\nrecognized. A fast friendship sprang up between the young medical\r\nstudent and this ripe anatomist, the influence of which must have been\r\nvery great in shaping the future work of Harvey.\r\n\r\nFabricius was already sixty-one years of age, and when Harvey came to\r\nPadua was perfecting his knowledge upon the valves of the veins. The\r\nyoung student was taken fully into his confidence, and here was laid\r\nthat first familiarity with the circulatory system, the knowledge of\r\nwhich Harvey was destined so much to advance and amplify. But it was\r\nthe stimulus of his master's friendship, rather than what he taught\r\nabout the circulation, that was of assistance to Harvey. For the views\r\nof Fabricius in reference to the circulation were those of Galen;\r\nand his conception of the use of the valves of the veins was entirely\r\nwrong. A portrait of this great teacher of Harvey is shown in Fig. 9.\r\n\r\nAt Padua young Harvey attracted notice as a student of originality and\r\nforce, and seems to have been a favorite with the student body as well\r\nas with his teachers. His position in the university may be inferred\r\nfrom the fact that he belonged to one of the aristocratic-student\r\norganizations, and, further, that he was designated a \"councilor\" for\r\nEngland. The practice of having student councilors was then in vogue in\r\nPadua; the students comprising the council met for deliberations, and\r\nvery largely managed the university by their votes upon instructors and\r\nuniversity measures.\r\n\r\nIt is a favorable comment upon the professional education of his time\r\nthat, after graduating at the University of Cambridge, he studied four\r\nor more years (Willis says five years) in scientific and medical lines\r\nto reach the degree of Doctor of Physic.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Padua, in 1602, he returned to England and took the\r\nexaminations for the degree of M.D. from Cambridge, inasmuch as the\r\nmedical degree from an English university advanced his prospects of\r\nreceiving a position at home. He opened practice, was married in 1604,\r\nand the same year began to give public lectures on anatomy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Fabricius, 1537-1619, Harvey's Teacher.]\r\n\r\nHis Personal Qualities.--Harvey had marked individuality, and seems to\r\nhave produced a powerful impression upon those with whom he came in\r\ncontact as one possessing unusual intellectual powers and independence\r\nof character. He inspired confidence in people, and it is significant\r\nthat, in reference to the circulation of the blood, he won to his way\r\nof thinking his associates in the medical profession. This is important\r\ntestimony as to his personal force, since his ideas were opposed to the\r\nbelief of the time, and since also away from home they were vigorously\r\nassailed.\r\n\r\nAlthough described as choleric and hasty, he had also winning\r\nqualities, so that he retained warm friendships throughout his life,\r\nand was at all times held in high respect. It must be said also that in\r\nhis replies to his critics, he showed great moderation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--William Harvey, 1578-1667.]\r\n\r\nThe contemplative face of Harvey is shown in Fig. 10. This is taken\r\nfrom his picture in the National Portrait Gallery in London, and\r\nis usually regarded as the second-best portrait of Harvey, since\r\nthe one painted by Jansen, now in possession of the Royal College\r\nof Physicians, is believed to be the best one extant. The picture\r\nreproduced here shows a countenance of composed intellectual strength,\r\nwith a suggestion, in the forehead and outline of the face, of some of\r\nthe portraits of Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nAn idea of his personal appearance may be had from the description of\r\nAubrey, who says: \"Harvey was not tall, but of the lowest stature;\r\nround faced, with a complexion like the wainscot; his eyes small,\r\nround, very black, and full of spirit; his hair black as a raven,\r\nbut quite white twenty years before he died; rapid in his utterance,\r\ncholeric, given to gesture,\" etc.\r\n\r\nHe was less impetuous than Vesalius, who had published his work at\r\ntwenty-eight; Harvey had demonstrated his ideas of the circulation in\r\npublic anatomies and lectures for twelve years before publishing them,\r\nand when his great classic on the Movement of the Heart and Blood\r\nfirst appeared in 1628, he was already fifty years of age. This is a\r\ngood example for young investigators of to-day who, in order to secure\r\npriority of announcement, so frequently rush into print with imperfect\r\nobservations as preliminary communications.\r\n\r\nHarvey's Writings.--Harvey's publications were all great; in\r\nembryology, as in physiology, he produced a memorable treatise. But his\r\npublications do not fully represent his activity as an investigator;\r\nit is known that through the fortunes of war, while connected with\r\nthe sovereign Charles I as court physician, he lost manuscripts and\r\ndrawings upon the comparative anatomy and development of insects\r\nand other animals. His position in embryology will be dealt with in\r\nthe chapter on the Development of Animals, and he will come up for\r\nconsideration again in the chapter on the Rise of Physiology. Here we\r\nare concerned chiefly with his general influence on the development of\r\nbiology.\r\n\r\nHis Great Classic on Movement of the Heart and Blood.--Since his book\r\non the circulation of the blood is regarded as one of the greatest\r\nmonuments along the highroad of biology, it is time to make mention of\r\nit in particular. Although relatively small, it has a long title out\r\nof proportion to its size: _Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et\r\nSanguinis in Animalibus_, which maybe freely translated, \"An Anatomical\r\nDisquisition on the Movement of the Heart and Blood in Animals.\" The\r\nbook is usually spoken of under the shorter title, _De Motu Cordis et\r\nSanguinis_. The full title seems somewhat repellent, but the contents\r\nof the book will prove to be interesting to general readers. It is a\r\nclear, logical demonstration of the subject, proceeding with directness\r\nfrom one point to another until the culminating force of the argument\r\ngrows complete and convincing.\r\n\r\nThe book in its first edition was a quarto volume of seventy-eight\r\npages, published in Frankfort in 1628. An interesting facsimile reprint\r\nof this work, translated into English, was privately reproduced in\r\n1894 by Dr. Moreton and published in Canterbury. As stated above, it\r\nis known that Harvey had presented and demonstrated his views in his\r\nlectures since 1616. In his book he showed for the first time ever in\r\nprint, that all the blood in the body moves in a circuit, and that the\r\nbeating of the heart supplies the propelling force. Both ideas were\r\nnew, and in order to appreciate in what sense they were original with\r\nHarvey, we must inquire into the views of his forerunners.\r\n\r\nQuestion as to Harvey's Originality.--The question of how near some\r\nof his predecessors came to anticipating his demonstration of the\r\ncirculation has been much debated. It has been often maintained that\r\nServetus and Realdus Columbus held the conception of the circulation\r\nfor which Harvey has become so celebrated. Of the various accounts\r\nof the views of Harvey's predecessors, those of Willis, Huxley, and\r\nMichael Foster are among the most judicial; that of Foster, indeed,\r\ninasmuch as it contains ample quotations from the original sources,\r\nis the most nearly complete and satisfactory. The discussion is too\r\nlong to enter into fully here, but a brief outline is necessary to\r\nunderstand what he accomplished, and to put his discovery in the proper\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nTo say that he first discovered--or, more properly, demonstrated--the\r\ncirculation of the blood carries the impression that he knew of the\r\nexistence of capillaries connecting the arteries and the veins, and\r\nhad ocular proof of the circulation through these connecting vessels.\r\nBut he did not actually see the blood moving from veins to arteries,\r\nand he knew not of the capillaries. He understood clearly from his\r\nobservations and experiments that all the blood passes from veins to\r\narteries and moves in \"a kind of circle\"; still, he thought that it\r\nfilters through the tissues in getting from one kind of vessel to the\r\nother. It was reserved for Malpighi, in 1661, and Leeuwenhoek, in 1669,\r\nto see, with the aid of lenses, the movement of the blood through the\r\ncapillaries in the transparent parts of animal tissues. (See under\r\nLeeuwenhoek, p. 84.)\r\n\r\nThe demonstration by Harvey of the movement of the blood in a circuit\r\nwas a matter of cogent reasoning, based on experiments with ligatures,\r\non the exposure of the heart in animals and the analysis of its\r\nmovements. It has been commonly maintained (as by Whewell) that\r\nhe deduced the circulation from observations of the valves in the\r\nveins, but this is not at all the case. The central point of Harvey's\r\nreasoning is that the quantity of blood which leaves the left cavity\r\nof the heart in a given space of time makes necessary its return to\r\nthe heart, since in a half-hour (or less) the heart, by successive\r\npulsations, throws into the great artery more than the total quantity\r\nof blood in the body. Huxley points out that this is the first time\r\nthat quantitative determinations were introduced into physiology.\r\n\r\nViews of His Predecessors on the Movement of the Blood.--Galen's view\r\nof the movement of the blood was not completely replaced until the\r\nestablishment of Harvey's view. The Greek anatomist thought that there\r\nwas an ebb and flow of blood within both veins and arteries throughout\r\nthe system. The left side of the heart was supposed to contain blood\r\nvitalized by a mixture of animal spirits within the lungs. The veins\r\nwere thought to contain crude blood. He supposed, further, that there\r\nwas a communication between the right and the left side of the heart\r\nthrough very minute pores in the septum, and that some blood from the\r\nright side passed through the pores into the left side and there became\r\ncharged with animal spirits. It should also be pointed out that Galen\r\nbelieved in the transference of some blood through the lungs from the\r\nright to the left side of the heart, and in this foreshadowed the views\r\nwhich were later developed by Servetus and Realdus Columbus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--Scheme of the Portal Circulation According to\r\nVesalius, 1543.]\r\n\r\nVesalius, in the first edition of his work (1543) expressed doubts\r\nupon the existence of pores in the partition-wall of the heart through\r\nwhich blood could pass; and in the second edition (1555) of the\r\n_Fabrica_ he became more skeptical. In taking this position he attacked\r\na fundamental part of the belief of Galen. The careful structural\r\nstudies of Vesalius must have led him very near to an understanding\r\nof the connection between arteries and veins. Fig. 11 shows one of\r\nhis sketches of the arrangement of arteries and veins. He saw that\r\nthe minute terminals of arteries and veins came very close together\r\nin the tissues of the body, but he did not grasp the meaning of the\r\nobservation, because his physiology was still that of Galen; Vesalius\r\ncontinued to believe that the arteries contained blood mixed with\r\nspirits, and the veins crude blood, and his idea of the movement\r\nwas that of an ebb and flow. In reference to the anatomy of the\r\nblood-vessels, he goes so far as to say of the portal vein and the\r\nvena cava in the liver that \"the extreme ramifications of these veins\r\ninosculate with each other, and in many places appear to unite and be\r\ncontinuous.\" All who followed him had the advantage of his drawings\r\nshowing the parallel arrangement of arteries and veins, and their close\r\napproach to each other in their minute terminal twigs, but no one\r\nbefore Harvey fully grasped the idea of the movement of the blood in a\r\ncomplete circuit.\r\n\r\nServetus, in his work on the Restoration of Christianity (_Restitutio\r\nChristianismi_, 1553), the work for which Calvin accomplished his\r\nburning at the stake, expressed more clearly than Galen had done the\r\nidea of a circuit of blood through the lungs. According to his view,\r\nsome of the blood took this course, while he still admits that a part\r\nmay exude through the wall of the ventricle from the right to the\r\nleft side. This, however, was embodied in a theological treatise, and\r\nhad little direct influence in bringing about an altered view of the\r\ncirculation. Nevertheless, there is some reason to think that it may\r\nhave been the original source of the ideas of the anatomist Columbus,\r\nas the studies into the character of that observer by Michael Foster\r\nseem to indicate.\r\n\r\nRealdus Columbus, professor of anatomy at Rome, expressed a conception\r\nalmost identical with that of Servetus, and as this was in an important\r\nwork on anatomy, published in 1559, and well known to the medical men\r\nof the period, it lay in the direct line of anatomical thought and\r\nhad greater influence. Foster suggests that the devious methods of\r\nColumbus, and his unblushing theft of intellectual property from other\r\nsources, give ground for the suspicion that he had appropriated this\r\nidea from Servetus without acknowledgment. Although Calvin supposed\r\nthat the complete edition of a thousand copies of the work of Servetus\r\nhad been burned with its author in 1553, a few copies escaped, and\r\npossibly one of these had been examined by Columbus. This assumption\r\nis strengthened by the circumstance that Columbus gives no record of\r\nobservations, but almost exactly repeats the words of Servetus.\r\n\r\nCæsalpinus, the botanist and medical man, expressed in 1571 and 1593\r\nsimilar ideas of the movement of the blood (probably as a matter\r\nof argument, since there is no record of either observations or\r\nexperiments by him). He also laid hold of a still more important\r\nconception, viz., that some of the blood passes from the left side of\r\nthe heart through the arteries of the body, and returns to the right\r\nside of the heart by the veins. But a fair consideration of the claims\r\nof these men as forerunners of Harvey requires quotations from their\r\nworks and a critical examination of the evidence thus adduced. This has\r\nbeen excellently done by Michael Foster in his _Lectures on the History\r\nof Physiology_. Further considerations of this aspect of the question\r\nwould lie beyond the purposes of this book.\r\n\r\nAt most, before Harvey, the circuit through the lungs had been vaguely\r\ndefined by Galen, Servetus, Columbus, and Cæsalpinus, and the latter\r\nhad supposed some blood to pass from the heart by the arteries and\r\nto return to it by the veins; but no one had arrived at an idea of a\r\ncomplete circulation of all the blood through the system, and no one\r\nhad grasped the consequences involved in such a conception. Harvey's\r\nidea of the movement of the heart (_De Motu Cordis_) was new; his\r\nnotion of the circulation (_et Sanguinis_) was new; and his method of\r\ndemonstrating these was new.\r\n\r\nHarvey's Argument.--The gist of Harvey's arguments is indicated in the\r\nfollowing propositions quoted with slight modifications from Hall's\r\n_Physiology_: (I) The heart passively dilates and actively contracts;\r\n(II) the auricles contract before the ventricles do; (III) the\r\ncontraction of the auricles forces the blood into the ventricles; (IV)\r\nthe arteries have no \"pulsific power,\" _i.e._, they dilate passively,\r\nsince the pulsation of the arteries is nothing else than the impulse of\r\nthe blood within them; (V) the heart is the organ of propulsion of the\r\nblood; (VI) in passing from the right ventricle to the left auricle the\r\nblood transudes through the parenchyma of the lungs; (VII) the quantity\r\nand rate of passage of the blood peripherally from the heart makes\r\nit a physical necessity that most of the blood return to the heart;\r\n(VIII) the blood does return to the heart by way of the veins. It will\r\nbe noticed that the proposition VII is the important one; in it is\r\ninvolved the idea of applying measurement to a physiological process.\r\n\r\nHarvey's Influence.--Harvey was a versatile student. He was a\r\ncomparative anatomist as well as a physiologist and embryologist; he\r\nhad investigated the anatomy of about sixty animals and the embryology\r\nof insects as well as of vertebrates, and his general influence in\r\npromoting biological work was extensive.\r\n\r\nHis work on the movement of the blood was more than a record of a\r\nseries of careful investigations; it was a landmark in progress. When\r\nwe reflect on the part played in the body by the blood, we readily see\r\nthat a correct idea of how it carries nourishment to the tissues, and\r\nhow it brings away from them the products of disintegrated protoplasm\r\nis of prime importance in physiology. It is the point from which spring\r\nall other ideas of the action of tissues, and until this was known the\r\nfine analysis of vital processes could not be made. The true idea of\r\nrespiration, of the secretion by glands, the chemical changes in the\r\ntissues, in fact, of all the general activities of the body, hinge\r\nupon this conception. It was these consequences of his demonstration,\r\nrather than the fact that the blood moves in a circuit, which made it\r\nso important. This discovery created modern physiology, and as that\r\nbranch of inquiry is one of the parts of general biology, the bearing\r\nof Harvey's discovery upon biological thought can be readily surmised.\r\n\r\nThose who wish to examine Harvey's views at first hand, without the\r\nburden of translating them from the Latin, will find an edition of his\r\ncomplete works translated into English by Willis, and published by the\r\nRay Society, of London.\r\n\r\nAs is always the case with new truths, there was hostility to\r\naccepting his views. In England this hostility was slight on account\r\nof his great personal influence, but on the Continent there was many a\r\nsharp criticism passed upon his work. His views were so illuminating\r\nthat they were certain of triumph, and even in his lifetime were\r\ngenerally accepted. Thus the new conception of vital activities,\r\ntogether with his method of inquiry, became permanent parts of\r\nbiological science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE INTRODUCTION OF THE MICROSCOPE AND THE PROGRESS OF INDEPENDENT\r\nOBSERVATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the microscope greatly increased the ocular\r\npowers of observers, and, in the seventeenth century, led to many new\r\ndepartures. By its use the observations were carried from the plane\r\nof gross anatomy to that of minute structure; the anatomy of small\r\nforms of life, like insects, began to be studied, and also the smaller\r\nmicroscopic animalcula were for the first time made known.\r\n\r\nPutting aside the disputed questions as to the time of the invention\r\nand the identity of the inventor of the microscope--whether to Fontana,\r\nGalileo, or the Jenssens belongs the credit--we know that it was\r\nimproved by the Hollander Drebbel in the early years of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, but was not seriously applied to anatomical studies till after\r\nthe middle of that century.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pioneer Microscopists\r\n\r\nThe names especially associated with early microscopic observations are\r\nthose of Hooke and Grew in England, Malpighi in Italy, and Swammerdam\r\nand Leeuwenhoek, both in Holland. Their microscopes were imperfect, and\r\nwere of two kinds: simple lenses, and lenses in combination, forming\r\nwhat we now know as the compound microscope. Some forms of these early\r\nmicroscopes will be described and illustrated later. Although thus\r\nearly introduced, microscopic observation did not produce its great\r\nresults until the nineteenth century, just after magnifying-lenses had\r\nbeen greatly improved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Hooke's Microscope, 1665.\r\n\r\nFrom Carpenter's _The Microscope and Its Revelations_. Permission of P.\r\nBlakiston's Sons & Co.]\r\n\r\nRobert Hooke (1635-1703), of London, published in 1665 a book of\r\nobservations with the microscope entitled _Micrographia_, which was\r\nembellished with eighty-three plates of figures. Hooke was a man of\r\nfine mental endowment, who had received a good scientific training at\r\nthe University of Cambridge, but who lacked fixedness of purpose in\r\nthe employment of his talents. He did good work in mathematics, made\r\nmany models for experimenting with flying machines, and claimed to have\r\ndiscovered gravitation before Newton, and also the use of a spring\r\nfor regulating watches before Huygens, etc. He gave his attention to\r\nmicroscopic study for a time and then dropped it; yet, although we can\r\nnot accord to him a prominent place in the history of biology, he must\r\nreceive mention as a pioneer worker with the microscope. His book gave\r\na powerful stimulus to microscopy in England, and, partly through its\r\ninfluence, labor in this field was carried on more systematically by\r\nhis fellow-countryman Nehemiah Grew.\r\n\r\nThe form of the microscope used by Hooke is known through a picture and\r\na description which he gives of it in his _Micrographia_. Fig. 12 is a\r\ncopy of the illustration. His was a compound microscope consisting of a\r\ncombination of lenses attached to a tube, one set near the eye of the\r\nobserver and the other near the object to be examined. When we come to\r\ndescribe the microscopes of Leeuwenhoek, with which so much good work\r\nwas accomplished, we shall see that they stand in marked contrast, on\r\naccount of their simplicity, to the somewhat elaborate instrument of\r\nHooke.\r\n\r\nGrew (1628-1711) devoted long and continuous labor to microscopic\r\nobservation, and, although he was less versatile and brilliant than\r\nHooke, his patient investigations give him just claim to a higher\r\nplace in the history of natural science. Grew applied the microscope\r\nespecially to the structure of plants, and his books entitled _Idea of\r\na Philosophical History of Plants_ (1673) and _Anatomy of Vegetables_\r\n(1682) helped to lay the foundations of vegetable histology. When\r\nwe come to consider the work of Malpighi, we shall see that he also\r\nproduced a work upon the microscopic structure of plants which,\r\nalthough not more exact and painstaking than Grew's, showed deeper\r\ncomprehension. He is the co-founder with Grew of the science of the\r\nmicroscopic anatomy of plants.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to dwell long upon the work of either Hooke or\r\nGrew, since that of Malpighi, Swammerdam, and Leeuwenhoek was more\r\nfar-reaching in its influence. The publications of these three men\r\nwere so important, both in reference to microscopic study and to the\r\nprogress of independent investigation, that it will be necessary\r\nto deal with them in more detail. In the work of these men we come\r\nupon the first fruits of the application of the methods introduced\r\nby Vesalius and Harvey. Of this triumvirate, one--Malpighi--was an\r\nItalian, and the other two were Hollanders. Their great service to\r\nintellectual progress consisted chiefly in this--that, following upon\r\nthe foundations of Vesalius and Harvey, \"they broke away from the\r\nthraldom of mere book-learning, and relying alone upon their own eyes\r\nand their own judgment, won for man that which had been quite lost--the\r\nblessings of independent and unbiased observation.\"\r\n\r\nIt is natural that, working when they did, and independently as they\r\ndid, their work overlapped in many ways. Malpighi is noteworthy for\r\nmany discoveries in anatomical science, for his monograph on the\r\nanatomy of the silkworm, for observations of the minute structure\r\nof plants, and of the development of the chick in the hen's egg.\r\nSwammerdam did excellent and accurate work upon the anatomy and\r\nmetamorphosis of insects, and the internal structure of mollusks,\r\nfrogs, and other animals. Leeuwenhoek is distinguished for much general\r\nmicroscopic work; he discovered various microscopic animalcula; he\r\nestablished, by direct observation, the fact of a connection between\r\narteries and veins, and examined microscopically minerals, plants,\r\nand animals. To him, more than to the others, the general title of\r\n\"microscopist\" might be applied.\r\n\r\nSince these men are so important in the growth of biology, let us, by\r\ntaking them individually, look a little more closely into their lives\r\nand labors.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarcello Malpighi, 1628-1694\r\n\r\nPersonal Qualities.--There are several portraits of Malpighi extant.\r\nThese, together with the account of his personal appearance given by\r\nAtti, one of his biographers, enable us to tell what manner of man\r\nhe was. The portrait shown in Fig. 13 is a copy of the one painted\r\nby Tabor and presented by Malpighi to the Royal Society of London,\r\nin whose rooms it may still be seen. This shows him in the full\r\nattractiveness of his early manhood, with the earnest, intellectual\r\nlook of a man of high ideals and scholarly tastes, sweet-tempered,\r\nand endowed with the insight that belongs to a sympathetic nature.\r\nSome of his portraits taken later are less attractive, and the lines\r\nand wrinkles that show in his face give evidence of imperfect health.\r\nAccording to Atti, he was of medium stature, with a brown skin, a\r\ndelicate complexion, a serious countenance, and a melancholy look.\r\n\r\nAccounts of his life show that he was modest, quiet, and of a pacific\r\ndisposition, notwithstanding the fact that he lived in an atmosphere of\r\nacrimonious criticism, of jealousy and controversy. A family dispute in\r\nreference to the boundary-lines between his father's property and the\r\nadjoining land of the Sbaraglia family gave rise to a feud, in which\r\nrepresentatives of the latter family followed him all his life with\r\nefforts to injure both his scientific reputation and his good name.\r\nUnder all this he suffered acutely, and his removal from Bologna to\r\nMessina was partly to escape the harshness of his critics. Some of his\r\nbest qualities showed under these persecutions; he was dignified under\r\nabuse and considerate in his reply. In reference to the attacks upon\r\nhis scientific standing, there were published after his death replies\r\nto his critics that were written while he was smarting under their\r\ninjustice and severity, but these replies are free from bitterness and\r\nare written in a spirit of great moderation. The following picture,\r\ntaken from Ray's correspondence, shows the fine control of his spirit.\r\nUnder the date of April, 1684, Dr. Tancred Robinson writes: \"Just as I\r\nleft Bononia I had a lamentable spectacle of Malpighi's house all in\r\nflames, occasioned by the negligence of his old wife. All his pictures,\r\nfurniture, books, and manuscripts were burnt. I saw him in the very\r\nheat of the calamity, and methought I never beheld so much Christian\r\npatience and philosophy in any man before; for he comforted his wife\r\nand condoled nothing but the loss of his papers.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Malpighi, 1628-1694.]\r\n\r\nEducation.--Malpighi was born at Crevalcuore, near Bologna, in 1628.\r\nHis parents were landed peasants, or farmers, enjoying an independence\r\nin financial matters. As their resources permitted it, they designed\r\nto give Marcellus, their eldest child, the advantage of masters and\r\nschools. He began a life of study; and, before long, he showed a taste\r\nfor belles-lettres and for philosophy, which he studied under Natali.\r\n\r\nThrough the death of both parents, in 1649, Malpighi found himself\r\norphaned at the age of twenty-one, and as he was the eldest of eight\r\nchildren, the management of domestic affairs devolved upon him. He\r\nhad as yet made no choice of a profession; but, through the advice of\r\nNatali, he resolved, in 1651, to study medicine. This advice followed,\r\nin 1653, at the age of twenty-five, he received from the University of\r\nBologna the degree of Doctor of Medicine.\r\n\r\nUniversity Positions.--In the course of a few years he married the\r\nsister of Massari, one of his teachers in anatomy, and became a\r\ncandidate for a chair in the University of Bologna. This he did not\r\nimmediately receive, but, about 1656, he was appointed to a post in\r\nthe university, and began his career as a teacher and investigator. He\r\nmust have shown aptitude for this work, for he was soon called to the\r\nUniversity of Pisa, where, fortunately for his development, he became\r\nassociated with Borelli, who, as an older man, assisted him in many\r\nways. They united in some work, and together they discovered the spiral\r\ncharacter of the heart muscles. But the climate of Pisa did not agree\r\nwith him, and after three years he returned, in 1659, to teach in the\r\nUniversity of Bologna, and applied himself assiduously to anatomy.\r\n\r\nHere his fame was in the ascendant, notwithstanding the machinations of\r\nhis enemies and detractors, led by Sbaraglia. He was soon (1662) called\r\nto Messina to follow the famous Castelli. After a residence there of\r\nfour years he again returned to Bologna, and as he was now thirty-eight\r\nyears of age, he thought it time to retire to his villa near the city\r\nin order to devote himself more fully to anatomical studies, but he\r\ncontinued his lectures in the university, and also his practice of\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nHonors at Home and Abroad.--Malpighi's talents were appreciated even\r\nat home. The University of Bologna honored him in 1686 with a Latin\r\n_eulogium_; the city erected a monument to his memory; and after\r\nhis death, in the city of Rome, his body was brought to Bologna\r\nand interred with great pomp and ceremony. At the three hundredth\r\nanniversary of his death, in 1894, a festival was held in Bologna, his\r\nmonument was unveiled, and a book of addresses by eminent anatomists\r\nwas published in his honor.\r\n\r\nDuring his lifetime he received recognition also from abroad, but that\r\nis less remarkable. In 1668 he was elected an honorary member of the\r\nRoyal Society of London. He was very sensible of this honor; he kept in\r\ncommunication with the society; he presented them with his portrait,\r\nand deposited in their archives the original drawings illustrating the\r\nanatomy of the silkworm and the development of the chick.\r\n\r\nIn 1691 he was taken to Rome by the newly elected pope, Innocent XII,\r\nas his personal physician, but under these new conditions he was not\r\ndestined to live many years. He died there, in 1694, of apoplexy. His\r\nwife, of whom it appears that he was very fond, had died a short time\r\npreviously. Among his posthumous works is a sort of personal psychology\r\nwritten down to the year 1691, in which he shows the growth of his\r\nmind, and the way in which he came to take up the different subjects of\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nIn reference to his discoveries and the position he occupies in the\r\nhistory of natural science, it should be observed that he was an\r\n\"original as well as a very profound observer.\" While the ideas of\r\nanatomy were still vague, \"he applied himself with ardor and sagacity\r\nto the study of the fine structure of the different parts of the body,\"\r\nand he extended his investigations to the structure of plants and of\r\ndifferent animals, and also to their development. Entering, as he did,\r\na new and unexplored territory, naturally he made many discoveries, but\r\nno man of mean talents could have done his work.\r\n\r\nActivity in Research.--During forty years of his life he was always\r\nbusy with research. Many of his discoveries had practical bearing on\r\nthe advance of anatomy and physiology as related to medicine. In 1661\r\nhe demonstrated the structure of the lungs. Previously these organs\r\nhad been regarded as a sort of homogeneous parenchyma. He showed the\r\npresence of air-cells, and had a tolerably correct idea of how the air\r\nand the blood are brought together in the lungs, the two never actually\r\nin contact, but always separated by a membrane. These discoveries were\r\nfirst made on the frog, and applied by analogy to the interpretation of\r\nthe lungs of the human body. He was a comparative anatomist, and the\r\nfirst to insist on analogies of structure between organs throughout\r\nthe animal kingdom, and to make extensive practical use of the idea\r\nthat discoveries on simpler animals can be utilized in interpreting the\r\nsimilar structures in the higher ones.\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting to note that in connection with this work he\r\nactually observed the passage of blood through the capillaries of the\r\ntransparent lungs of the frog, and also in the mesentery. Although this\r\nantedates the similar observations of Leeuwenhoek (1669), nevertheless\r\nthe work of Leeuwenhoek was much more complete, and he is usually\r\nrecognized in physiology as the discoverer of the capillary connection\r\nbetween arteries and veins. At this same period Malpighi also observed\r\nthe blood corpuscles.\r\n\r\nSoon after he demonstrated the mucous layer, or pigmentary layer of\r\nthe skin, intermediate between the true and the scarf skin. He had\r\nseparated this layer by boiling and maceration, and described it\r\nas a reticulated membrane. Even its existence was for a long time\r\ncontroverted, but it remains in modern anatomy under the title of the\r\nMalpighian layer.\r\n\r\nHis observation of glands was extensive, and while it must be confessed\r\nthat many of his conclusions in reference to glandular structure were\r\nerroneous, he left his name connected with the Malpighian corpuscles\r\nof the kidney and of the spleen. He was also the first to indicate the\r\nnature of the papillæ on the tongue. The foregoing is a respectable\r\nlist of discoveries, but much more stands to his credit. Those which\r\nfollow have a bearing on comparative anatomy, zoölogy, and botany.\r\n\r\nMonograph on the Structure and Metamorphosis of the\r\nSilkworm.--Malpighi's work on the structure of the silkworm takes rank\r\namong the most famous monographs on the anatomy of a single animal.\r\nMuch skill was required to give to the world this picture of minute\r\nstructure. The marvels of organic architecture were being made known in\r\nthe human body and the higher animals, but \"no insect--hardly, indeed,\r\nany animal--had then been carefully described, and all the methods of\r\nthe work had to be discovered.\" He labored with such enthusiasm in\r\nthis new territory as to throw himself into a fever and to set up an\r\ninflammation in the eyes. \"Nevertheless,\" says Malpighi, \"in performing\r\nthese researches so many marvels of nature were spread before my eyes\r\nthat I experienced an internal pleasure that my pen could not describe.\"\r\n\r\nHe showed that the method of breathing was neither by lungs nor by\r\ngills, but through a system of air-tubes, communicating with the\r\nexterior through buttonhole shaped openings, and, internally, by an\r\ninfinitude of branches reaching to the minutest parts of the body.\r\nMalpighi showed an instinct for comparison; instead of confining his\r\nresearches to the species in hand, he extended his observations to\r\nother insects, and has given sketches of the breathing-tubes, held open\r\nby their spiral thread, taken from several species.\r\n\r\nThe nervous system he found to be a central white cord with swellings\r\nin each ring of the body, from which nerves are given off to all\r\norgans and tissues. The cord, which is, of course, the central nervous\r\nsystem, he found located mainly on the ventral surface of the body, but\r\nextending by a sort of collar of nervous matter around the oesophagus,\r\nand on the dorsal surface appearing as a more complex mass, or brain,\r\nfrom which nerves are given off to the eyes and other sense organs of\r\nthe head. As illustrations from this monograph we have, in Fig. 14,\r\nreduced sketches of the drawings of the nervous system and the food\r\ncanal in the adult silkworm. The sketch at the right hand illustrates\r\nthe central nerve cord with its ganglionic enlargement in each segment,\r\nthe segments being indicated by the rows of spiracles at the sides. The\r\noriginal drawing is on a much larger scale, and reducing it takes away\r\nsome of its coarseness. All of his drawings lack the finish and detail\r\nof Swammerdam's work.\r\n\r\nHe showed also the food canal and the tubules connected with the\r\nintestine, which retain his name in the insect anatomy of to-day,\r\nunder the designation of Malpighian tubes. The silk-forming apparatus\r\nwas also figured and described. These structures are represented, as\r\nMalpighi drew them, on the left of Fig. 14.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--From Malpighi's _Anatomy of the Silkworm_,\r\n1669.]\r\n\r\nThis monograph, which was originally published in 1669 by the Royal\r\nSociety of London, bears the Latin title, _Dissertatio Epistolica de\r\nBombyce_. It has been several times republished, the best edition being\r\nthat in French, which dates from Montpellier, in 1878, and which is\r\nprefaced by an account of the life and labors of Malpighi.\r\n\r\nAnatomy of Plants.--Malpighi's anatomy of plants constitutes one of his\r\nbest, as well as one of his most extensive works. In the folio edition\r\nof his works, 1675-79, the _Anatome Plantarum_ occupies not less than\r\n152 pages and is illustrated by ninety-three plates of figures. It\r\ncomprises an exposition of the structure of bark, stem, roots, seeds,\r\nthe process of germination, and includes a treatise on galls, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nIn this work the microscopic structure of plants is amply illustrated,\r\nand he anticipated to a certain degree the ideas on the cellular\r\nstructure of plants. Burnett says: \"His observations appear to have\r\nbeen very accurate, and not only did he maintain the cellular structure\r\nof plants, but also declared that it was composed of separate cells,\r\nwhich he designated 'utricles.'\" Thus did he foreshadow the cell\r\ntheory of plants as developed by Schleiden in the nineteenth century.\r\nWhen it came to interpretations, he made several errors. Applying his\r\noften-asserted principle of analogies, he concluded that the vessels\r\nof plants are organs of respiration and of circulation, from a certain\r\nresemblance that they bear to the breathing-tubes of insects. But his\r\nobservations on structure are good, and if he had accomplished nothing\r\nmore than this work on plants he would have a place in the history of\r\nbotany.\r\n\r\nWork in Embryology.--Difficult as was his task in insect anatomy\r\nand plant histology, a more difficult one remains to be mentioned,\r\n_viz._, his observations of the development of animals. He had pushed\r\nhis researches into the finer structure of organisms, and now he\r\nattempted to answer this question: How does one of these organisms\r\nbegin its life, and by what series of steps is its body built up? He\r\nturned to the chick, as the most available form in which to get an\r\ninsight into this process, but he could not extend his observations\r\nsuccessfully into periods earlier than about the twenty-four-hour stage\r\nof development. Two memoirs were written on this subject, both in 1672,\r\nwhich were published by the Royal Society of England under the titles\r\n_De Formatione Pulli in Ovo_ and _De Ovo Incubato_. Of all Malpighi's\r\nwork, this has received the least attention from reviewers, but it is,\r\nfor his time, a very remarkable achievement. No one can look over the\r\nten folio plates without being impressed with the extent and accuracy\r\nof his observations. His sketches are of interest, not only to students\r\nof embryology, but also to educated people, to see how far observations\r\nregarding the development of animals had progressed in 1672. Further\r\nconsideration of his position in embryology will be found in the\r\nchapter on the rise of that subject.\r\n\r\nLittle is known regarding the form of microscope employed by Malpighi.\r\nDoubtless, much of his work was done with a simple lens, since he\r\nspeaks of examining the dried lungs with a microscope of a single lens\r\nagainst the horizontal sun; but he is also known to have observed with\r\nan instrument consisting of two lenses.\r\n\r\nMalpighi was a naturalist, but of a new type; he began to look below\r\nthe surface, and essayed a deeper level of analysis in observing and\r\ndescribing the internal and minute structure of animals and plants, and\r\nwhen he took the further step of investigating their development he was\r\nanticipating the work of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nJan Swammerdam (1637-1680)\r\n\r\nSwammerdam was a different type of man--nervous, incisive, very\r\nintense, stubborn, and self-willed. Much of his character shows in the\r\nportrait by Rembrandt represented in Fig. 15. Although its authenticity\r\nhas been questioned, it is the only known portrait of Swammerdam.\r\n\r\nEarly Interest in Natural History.--He was born in 1637, nine years\r\nafter Malpighi. His father, an apothecary of Amsterdam, had a taste for\r\ncollecting, which was shared by many of his fellow-townsmen. The Dutch\r\npeople of this time sent their ships into all parts of the world, and\r\nthis vast commerce, together with their extensive colonial possessions,\r\nfostered the formation of private museums. The elder Swammerdam had\r\nthe finest and most celebrated collection in all Amsterdam. This was\r\nstored, not only with treasures, showing the civilization of remote\r\ncountries, but also with specimens of natural history, for which he had\r\na decided liking. Thus \"from the earliest dawn of his understanding the\r\nyoung Swammerdam was surrounded by zoölogical specimens, and from the\r\njoint influence, doubtless, of hereditary taste and early association,\r\nhe became passionately devoted to the study of natural history.\"\r\n\r\nStudies Medicine.--His father intended him for the church, but he had\r\nno taste for theology, though he became a fanatic in religious matters\r\ntoward the close of his life; at this period, however, he could brook\r\nno restraint in word or action. He consented to study medicine, but for\r\nsome reason he was twenty-six years old before entering the University\r\nof Leyden. This delay was very likely owing to his precarious health,\r\nbut, in the mean time, he had not been idle; he had devoted himself\r\nto observation and study with great ardor, and had already become an\r\nexpert in minute dissection. When he went to the University of Leyden,\r\ntherefore, he at once took high rank in anatomy. Anything demanding\r\nfine manipulation and dexterity was directly in his line. He continued\r\nhis studies in Paris, and about 1667 took his degree of Doctor of\r\nMedicine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Swammerdam, 1637-1680.]\r\n\r\nDuring this period of medical study he made some rather important\r\nobservations in human anatomy, and introduced the method of injection\r\nthat was afterward claimed by Ruysch. In 1664 he discovered the\r\nvalves of lymphatic vessels by the use of slender glass tubes,\r\nand, three years later, first used a waxy material for injecting\r\nblood-vessels.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted, in passing, that Swammerdam was the first to\r\nobserve and describe the blood corpuscles. As early as 1658 he\r\ndescribed them in the blood of the frog, but not till fifty-seven years\r\nafter his death were his observations published by Boerhaave, and,\r\ntherefore, he does not get the credit of this discovery. Publication\r\nalone, not first observation, establishes priority, but there is\r\nconclusive evidence that he observed the blood corpuscles before either\r\nMalpighi or Leeuwenhoek had published his findings.\r\n\r\nLove of Minute Anatomy.--After graduating in medicine he did not\r\npractice, but followed his strong inclination to devote himself to\r\nminute anatomy. This led to differences with his father, who insisted\r\non his going into practice, but the self-willed stubbornness and\r\nfirmness of the son now showed themselves. It was to gratify no love of\r\nease that Swammerdam thus held out against his father, but to be able\r\nto follow an irresistible leading toward minute anatomy. At last his\r\nfather planned to stop supplies, in order to force him into the desired\r\nchannel, but Swammerdam made efforts, without success, to sell his own\r\npersonal collection and preserve his independence. His father died,\r\nleaving him sufficient property to live on, and brought the controversy\r\nto a close soon after the son had consented to yield to his wishes.\r\n\r\nBoerhaave, his fellow-countryman, gathered Swammerdam's complete\r\nwritings after his death and published them in 1737 under the title\r\n_Biblia Naturæ_. With them is included a life of Swammerdam, in which\r\na graphic account is given of his phenomenal industry, his intense\r\napplication, his methods and instruments. Most of the following\r\npassages are selected from that work.\r\n\r\nIntensity as a Worker.--He was a very intemperate worker, and in\r\nfinishing his treatise on bees (1673) he broke himself down.\r\n\r\n\"It was an undertaking too great for the strongest constitution to\r\nbe continually employed by day in making observations and almost\r\nas constantly engaged by night in recording them by drawings and\r\nsuitable explanations. This being summer work, his daily labors began\r\nat six in the morning, when the sun afforded him light enough to\r\nenable him to survey such minute objects; and from that time till\r\ntwelve he continued without interruption, all the while exposed in\r\nthe open air to the scorching heat of the sun, bareheaded, for fear\r\nof interrupting the light, and his head in a manner dissolving into\r\nsweat under the irresistible ardors of that powerful luminary. And if\r\nhe desisted at noon, it was only because the strength of his eyes was\r\ntoo much weakened by the extraordinary efflux of light and the use of\r\nmicroscopes to continue any longer upon such small objects.\r\n\r\n\"This fatigue our author submitted to for a whole month together,\r\nwithout any interruption, merely to examine, describe, and represent\r\nthe intestines of bees, besides many months more bestowed upon\r\nthe other parts; during which time he spent whole days in making\r\nobservations, as long as there was sufficient light to make any, and\r\nwhole nights in registering his observations, till at last he brought\r\nhis treatise on bees to the wished-for perfection.\"\r\n\r\nMethod of Work.--\"For dissecting very minute objects, he had a brass\r\ntable made on purpose by that ingenious artist, Samuel Musschenbroek.\r\nTo this table were fastened two brass arms, movable at pleasure to\r\nany part of it, and the upper portion of these arms was likewise so\r\ncontrived as to be susceptible of a very slow vertical motion, by which\r\nmeans the operator could readily alter their height as he saw most\r\nconvenient to his purpose. The office of one of these arms was to hold\r\nthe little corpuscles, and that of the other to apply the microscope.\r\nHis microscopes were of various sizes and curvatures, his microscopical\r\nglasses being of various diameters and focuses, and, from the least\r\nto the greatest, the best that could be procured, in regard to the\r\nexactness of the workmanship and the transparency of the substance.\r\n\r\n\"But the constructing of very fine scissors, and giving them an extreme\r\nsharpness, seems to have been his chief secret. These he made use of to\r\ncut very minute objects, because they dissected them equably, whereas\r\nknives and lancets, let them be ever so fine and sharp, are apt to\r\ndisorder delicate substances. His knives, lancets, and styles were so\r\nfine that he could not see to sharpen them without the assistance of\r\nthe microscope; but with them he could dissect the intestines of bees\r\nwith the same accuracy and distinctness that others do those of large\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n\"He was particularly dexterous in the management of small tubes of\r\nglass no thicker than a bristle, drawn to a very fine point at one end,\r\nbut thicker at the other.\"\r\n\r\nThese were used for inflating hollow structures, and also for making\r\nfine injections. He dissolved the fat of insects in turpentine and\r\ncarried on dissections under water.\r\n\r\nAn unbiased examination of his work will show that it is of a higher\r\nquality than Malpighi's in regard to critical observation and richness\r\nof detail. He also worked with minuter objects and displayed a greater\r\nskill.\r\n\r\nThe Religious Devotee.--The last part of his life was dimmed by\r\nfanaticism. He read the works of Antoinette Bourignon and fell under\r\nher influence; he began to subdue his warm and stubborn temper, and to\r\ngive himself up to religious contemplation. She taught him to regard\r\nscientific research as worldly, and, following her advice, he gave\r\nup his passionate fondness for studying the works of the Creator, to\r\ndevote himself to the love and adoration of that same Being. Always\r\nextreme and intense in everything he undertook, he likewise overdid\r\nthis, and yielded himself to a sort of fanatical worship until the end\r\nof his life, in 1680. Had he possessed a more vigorous constitution he\r\nwould have been greater as a man. He lived, in all, but forty-three\r\nyears; the last six or seven years were unproductive because of his\r\nmental distractions, and before that, much of his time had been lost\r\nthrough sickness.\r\n\r\nThe Biblia Naturæ.--It is time to ask, What, with all his talents and\r\nprodigious application, did he leave to science? This is best answered\r\nby an examination of the _Biblia Naturæ_, under which title all his\r\nwork was collected. His treatise on Bees and Mayflies and a few other\r\narticles were published during his lifetime, but a large part of his\r\nobservations remained entirely unknown until they were published in\r\nthis book fifty-seven years after his death. In the folio edition it\r\nembraces 410 pages of text and fifty-three plates, replete with figures\r\nof original observations. It \"contains about a dozen life-histories\r\nof insects worked out in more or less detail. Of these, the mayfly\r\nis the most famous; that on the honey-bee the most elaborate.\" The\r\ngreater amount of his work was in structural entomology. It is known\r\nthat he had a collection of about three thousand different species of\r\ninsects, which for that period was a very large one. There is, however,\r\na considerable amount of work on other animals; the fine anatomy of\r\nthe snail, the structure of the clam, the squid; observations on the\r\nstructure and development of the frog; observations on the contraction\r\nof the muscles, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered that Swammerdam was extremely exact in all that\r\nhe did. His descriptions are models of accuracy and completeness.\r\n\r\nFig. 16 shows reduced sketches of his illustrations of the structure of\r\nthe snail. The upper sketch shows the central nervous system and the\r\nnerve trunks connected therewith, and the lower figure shows the shell\r\nand the principal muscles. This is an exceptionally good piece of\r\nanatomization for that time, and is a fair sample of the fidelity with\r\nwhich he worked out details in the structure of small animals. Besides\r\nshowing this, these figures also serve the purpose of pointing out that\r\nSwammerdam's fine anatomical work was by no means confined to insects.\r\nHis determinations on the structure of the young frog were equally\r\nnoteworthy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--From Swammerdam's _Biblia Naturæ_.]\r\n\r\nBut we should have at least one illustration of his handling of insect\r\nanatomy to compare more directly with that of Malpighi, already\r\ngiven. Fig. 17 is a reduced sketch of the anatomy of the larva of an\r\nephemerus, showing, besides other structures, the central nervous\r\nsystem in its natural position. When compared with the drawings of\r\nMalpighi, we see there is a more masterly hand at the task, and a more\r\ncritical spirit back of the hand. The nervous system is very well done,\r\nand the greater detail in other features shows a disposition to go into\r\nthe subject more deeply than Malpighi.\r\n\r\nBesides working on the structure and life-histories of animals,\r\nSwammerdam showed, experimentally, the irritability of nerves and the\r\nresponse of muscles after their removal from the body. He not only\r\nillustrates this quite fully, but seems to have had a pretty good\r\nappreciation of the nature of the problem of the physiologist. He says:\r\n\r\n\"It is evident from the foregoing observations that a great number of\r\nthings concur in the contraction of the muscles, and that one should\r\nbe thoroughly acquainted with that wonderful machine, our body, and\r\nthe elements with which we are surrounded, to describe exactly one\r\nsingle muscle and explain its action. On this occasion it would be\r\nnecessary for us to consider the atmosphere, the nature of our food,\r\nthe blood, the brain, marrow, and nerves, that most subtle matter which\r\ninstantaneously flows to the fibers, and many other things, before we\r\ncould expect to attain a sight of the perfect and certain truth.\"\r\n\r\nIn reference to the formation of animals within the egg, Swammerdam\r\nwas, as Malpighi, a believer in the pre-formation theory. The basis for\r\nhis position on this question will be set forth in the chapter on the\r\nRise of Embryology.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--Anatomy of an Insect: Dissected and Drawn by\r\nSwammerdam.]\r\n\r\nThere was another question in his time upon which philosophers and\r\nscientific men were divided, which was in reference to the origin of\r\nliving organisms: Does lifeless matter, sometimes, when submitted to\r\nheat and moisture, spring into life? Did the rats of Egypt come, as\r\nthe ancients believed, from the mud of the Nile, and do frogs and\r\ntoads have a similar origin? Do insects spring from the dew on plants?\r\netc., etc. The famous Redi performed his noteworthy experiments when\r\nSwammerdam was twenty-eight years old, but opinion was divided upon\r\nthe question as to the possible spontaneous origin of life, especially\r\namong the smaller animals. Upon this question Swammerdam took a\r\npositive stand; he ranged himself on the side of the more scientific\r\nnaturalists against the spontaneous formation of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nAntony van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723)\r\n\r\nIn Leeuwenhoek we find a composed and better-balanced man. Blessed\r\nwith a vigorous constitution, he lived ninety-one years, and worked to\r\nthe end of his life. He was born in 1632, four years after Malpighi,\r\nand five before Swammerdam; they were, then, strictly speaking,\r\ncontemporaries. He stands in contrast with the other men in being\r\nself-taught; he did not have the advantage of a university training,\r\nand apparently never had a master in scientific study. This lack of\r\nsystematic training shows in the desultory character of his extensive\r\nobservations. Impelled by the same gift of genius that drove his\r\nconfrères to study nature with such unexampled activity, he too\r\nfollowed the path of an independent and enthusiastic investigator.\r\n\r\nThe portrait (Fig. 18) which forms a frontispiece to his _Arcana\r\nNaturæ_ represents him at the age of sixty-three, and shows the\r\npleasing countenance of a firm man in vigorous health. Richardson\r\nsays: \"In the face peering through the big wig there is the quiet\r\nforce of Cromwell and the delicate disdain of Spinoza.\" \"It is a mixed\r\nracial type, Semitic and Teutonic, a Jewish-Saxon; obstinate and yet\r\nimaginative; its very obstinacy a virtue, saving it from flying too far\r\nwild by its imagination.\"\r\n\r\nRecent Additions to His Biography.--There was a singular scarcity\r\nof facts in reference to Leeuwenhoek's life until 1885, when Dr.\r\nRichardson published in _The Asclepiad_[1] the results of researches\r\nmade by Mr. A. Wynter Blyth in Leeuwenhoek's native town of Delft. I am\r\nindebted to that article for much that follows.\r\n\r\nHis _Arcana Naturæ_ and other scientific letters contained a complete\r\nrecord of his scientific activity, but \"about his parentage, his\r\neducation, and his manner of making a living there was nothing but\r\nconjecture to go upon.\" The few scraps of personal history were\r\ncontained in the Encyclopædia articles by Carpenter and others, and\r\nthese were wrong in sustaining the hypothesis that Leeuwenhoek was an\r\noptician or manufacturer of lenses for the market. Although he ground\r\nlenses for his own use, there was no need on his part of increasing\r\nhis financial resources by their sale. He held under the court a minor\r\noffice designated 'Chamberlain of the Sheriff.' The duties of the\r\noffice were those of a beadle, and were set forth in his commission,\r\na document still extant. The requirements were light, as was also the\r\nsalary, which amounted to about £26 a year. He held this post for\r\nthirty-nine years, and the stipend was thereafter continued to him to\r\nthe end of his life.\r\n\r\nVan Leeuwenhoek was derived from a good Delft family. His grandfather\r\nand his great-grandfather were Delft brewers, and his grandmother a\r\nbrewer's daughter. The family were doubtless wealthy. His schooling\r\nseems to have been brought to a close at the age of sixteen, when he\r\nwas \"removed to a clothing business in Amsterdam, where he filled the\r\noffice of bookkeeper and cashier.\" After a few years he returned to\r\nDelft, and at the age of twenty-two he married, and gave himself up\r\nlargely to studies in natural history. Six years after his marriage he\r\nobtained the appointment mentioned above. He was twice married, but\r\nleft only one child, a daughter by his first wife. In the old church\r\nat Delft is a monument erected by this daughter to the memory of her\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--Leeuwenhoek, 1632-1723.]\r\n\r\nHe led an easy, prosperous, but withal a busy life. The microscope had\r\nrecently been invented, and for observation with that new instrument\r\nLeeuwenhoek showed an avidity amounting to a passion.\r\n\r\n\"That he was in comfortable, if not affluent, circumstances is clear\r\nfrom the character of his writings; that he was not troubled by any\r\nvery anxious and responsible duties is certain from the continuity of\r\nhis scientific work; that he could secure the services of persons of\r\ninfluence is discernible from the circumstances that, in 1673, De Graaf\r\nsent his first paper to the Royal Society of London; that in 1680 the\r\nsame society admitted him as fellow; that the directors of the East\r\nIndia Company sent him specimens of natural history, and that, in 1698,\r\nPeter the Great paid him a call to inspect his microscopes and their\r\nrevelations.\"\r\n\r\nLeeuwenhoek seems to have been fascinated by the marvels of the\r\nmicroscopic world, but the extent and quality of his work lifted him\r\nabove the level of the dilettante. He was not, like Malpighi and\r\nSwammerdam, a skilled dissector, but turned his microscope in all\r\ndirections; to the mineral as well as to the vegetable and animal\r\nkingdoms. Just when he began to use the microscope is not known; his\r\nfirst publication in reference to microscopic objects did not appear\r\ntill 1673, when he was forty-one years old.\r\n\r\nHis Microscopes.--He gave good descriptions and drawings of his\r\ninstruments, and those still in existence have been described by\r\nCarpenter and others, and in consequence we have a very good idea of\r\nhis working equipment. During his lifetime he sent as a present to the\r\nRoyal Society of London twenty-six microscopes, each provided with an\r\nobject to examine. Unfortunately, these were removed from the rooms of\r\nthe society and lost during the eighteenth century. His lenses were of\r\nfine quality and were ground by himself. They were nearly all simple\r\nlenses, of small size but considerable curvature, and needed to be\r\nbrought close to the object examined. He had different microscopes for\r\ndifferent purposes, giving a range of magnifying powers from 40 to 270\r\ndiameters and possibly higher. The number of his lenses is surprising;\r\nhe possessed not less than 247 complete microscopes, two of which were\r\nprovided with double lenses, and one with a triplet. In addition to\r\nthe above, he had 172 lenses set between plates of metal, which give\r\na total of 419 lenses used by him in his observations. Three were of\r\nquartz, or rock crystal; the rest were of glass. More than one-half the\r\nlenses were mounted in silver; three were in gold.\r\n\r\nIt is to be understood that all his microscopes were of simple\r\nconstruction; no tubes, no mirror; simple pieces of metal to hold the\r\nmagnifying-glass and the objects to be examined, with screws to adjust\r\nthe position and the focus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--Leeuwenhoek's Microscope.\r\n\r\nNatural size. From Photographs by Professor Nierstrasz, of Utrecht.]\r\n\r\nThe three aspects of one of Leeuwenhoek's microscopes shown in\r\nFig. 19 will give a very good idea of how they were constructed.\r\nThese pictures represent the actual size of the instrument. The\r\nphotographs were made by Professor Nierstrasz from the specimen in\r\npossession of the University of Utrecht. The instrument consists of\r\na double copper plate in which the circular lens is inserted, and an\r\nobject-holder--represented in the right-hand lower figure as thrown\r\nto one side. By a vertical screw the object could be elevated or\r\ndepressed, and by a transverse screw it could be brought nearer or\r\nremoved farther from the lens, and thus be brought into focus.\r\n\r\nFig. 20_a_ shows the way in which the microscope was arranged to\r\nexamine the circulation of blood in the transparent tail of a small\r\nfish. The fish was placed in water in a slender glass tube, and the\r\nlatter was held in a metallic frame, to which a plate (marked _D_) was\r\njoined, carrying the magnifying glass. The latter is indicated in the\r\ncircle above the letter _D_, near the tail-fin of the fish. The eye\r\nwas applied close to this circular magnifying-glass, which was brought\r\ninto position and adjusted by means of screws. In some instances,\r\nhe had a concave reflector with a hole in the center, in which his\r\nmagnifying-glass was inserted; in this form of instrument the objects\r\nwere illumined by reflected, and not by transmitted light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20_a._--Leeuwenhoek's Mechanism for Examining the\r\nCirculation of the Blood.]\r\n\r\nHis Scientific Letters.--His microscopic observations were described\r\nand sent to learned societies in the form of letters. \"All or nearly\r\nall that he did in a literary way was after the manner of an epistle,\"\r\nand his written communications were so numerous as to justify\r\nthe cognomen, \"The man of many letters.\" \"The French Academy of\r\nSciences, of which he was elected a corresponding member in 1697, got\r\ntwenty-seven; but the lion's share fell to the young Royal Society\r\nof London, which in fifty years--1673-1723--received 375 letters and\r\npapers.\" \"The works themselves, except that they lie in the domain\r\nof natural history, are disconnected and appear in no order of\r\nsystematized study. The philosopher was led by what transpired at any\r\nmoment to lead him.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20_b_.--The Capillary Circulation. (After\r\nLeeuwenhoek.)]\r\n\r\nThe Capillary Circulation.--In 1686 he observed the minute circulation\r\nof the blood, and demonstrated the capillary connection between\r\narteries and veins, thus forging the final link in the chain of\r\nobservation showing the relation between these blood-vessels. This was\r\nperhaps his most important observation for its bearing on physiology.\r\nIt must be remembered that Harvey had not actually seen the circulation\r\nof the blood, which he announced in 1628. He assumed on entirely\r\nsufficient grounds the existence of a complete circulation, but there\r\nwas wanting in his scheme the direct ocular proof of the passage of\r\nblood from arteries to veins. This was supplied by Leeuwenhoek. Fig.\r\n20_b_ shows one of his sketches of the capillary circulation. In his\r\nefforts to see the circulation he tried various animals; the comb of\r\nthe young cock, the ears of white rabbits, the membraneous wing of\r\nthe bat were progressively examined. The next advance came when he\r\ndirected his microscope to the tail of the tadpole. Upon examining this\r\nhe exclaims:\r\n\r\n\"A sight presented itself more delightful than any mine eyes had ever\r\nbeheld; for here I discovered more than fifty circulations of the blood\r\nin different places, while the animal lay quiet in the water, and I\r\ncould bring it before my microscope to my wish. For I saw not only\r\nthat in many places the blood was conveyed through exceedingly minute\r\nvessels, from the middle of the tail toward the edges, but that each of\r\nthe vessels had a curve or turning, and carried the blood back toward\r\nthe middle of the tail, in order to be again conveyed to the heart.\r\nHereby it plainly appeared to me that the blood-vessels which I now saw\r\nin the animal, and which bear the names of arteries and veins are, in\r\nfact, one and the same; that is to say, that they are properly termed\r\narteries so long as they convey the blood to the furtherest extremities\r\nof its vessels, and veins when they bring it back to the heart. And\r\nthus it appears that an artery and a vein are one and the same vessel\r\nprolonged or extended.\"\r\n\r\nThis description shows that he fully appreciated the course of the\r\nminute vascular circulation and the nature of the communication between\r\narteries and veins. He afterward extended his observations to the web\r\nof the frog's foot, the tail of young fishes and eels.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this it should be remembered that Malpighi, in\r\n1661, observed the flow of blood in the lungs and in the mesentery of\r\nthe frog, but he made little of the discovery. Leeuwenhoek did more\r\nwith his, and gave the first clear idea of the capillary circulation.\r\nLeeuwenhoek was anticipated also by Malpighi in reference to the\r\nmicroscopic structure of the blood. (See also under Swammerdam.)\r\nTo Malpighi the corpuscles appeared to be globules of fat, while\r\nLeeuwenhoek noted that the blood disks of birds, frogs, and fishes were\r\noval in outline, and those of mammals circular. He reserved the term\r\n'globule' for those of the human body, erroneously believing them to be\r\nspheroidal.\r\n\r\nOther Discoveries.--Among his other discoveries bearing on physiology\r\nand medicine may be mentioned: the branched character of heart muscles,\r\nthe stripe in voluntary muscles, the structure of the crystalline\r\nlens, the description of spermatozoa after they had been pointed out\r\nto him in 1674 by Hamen, a medical student in Leyden, etc. Richardson\r\ndignified him with the title 'the founder of histology,' but this, in\r\nview of the work of his great contemporary, Malpighi, seems to me an\r\noverestimate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--Plant Cells. (From Leeuwenhoek's _Arcana\r\nNaturæ_.)]\r\n\r\nTurning his microscope in all directions, he examined water and found\r\nit peopled with minute animalcules, those simple forms of animal life\r\npropelled through the water by innumerable hair-like cilia extending\r\nfrom the body like banks of oars from a galley, except that in many\r\ncases they extend from all surfaces. He saw not only the animalcules,\r\nbut also the cilia that move their bodies.\r\n\r\nHe also discovered the Rotifers, those favorites of the amateur\r\nmicroscopists, made so familiar to the general public in works like\r\nGosse's _Evenings at the Microscope_. He observed that when water\r\ncontaining these animalcules evaporated they were reduced to fine dust,\r\nbut became alive again, after great lapses of time, by the introduction\r\nof water.\r\n\r\nHe made many observations on the microscopic structure of plants. Fig.\r\n21 gives a fair sample of the extent to which he observed the cellular\r\nconstruction of vegetables and anticipated the cell theory. While\r\nMalpighi's research in that field was more extensive, these sketches\r\nfrom Leeuwenhoek represent very well the character of the work of the\r\nperiod on the minute structures of plants.\r\n\r\nHis Theoretical Views.--It remains to say that on the two biological\r\nquestions of the day he took a decisive stand. He was a believer in\r\npre-formation or pre-delineation of the embryo in an extreme degree,\r\nseeing in fancy the complete outline of both maternal and paternal\r\nindividuals in the spermatozoa, and going so far as to make sketches of\r\nthe same. But on the question of the spontaneous origin of life he took\r\nthe side that has been supported with such triumphant demonstration in\r\nthis century; namely, the side opposing the theory of the occurrence of\r\nspontaneous generation under present conditions of life.\r\n\r\nComparison of the Three Men.--We see in these three gifted\r\ncontemporaries different personal characteristics. Leeuwenhoek, the\r\ncomposed and strong, attaining an age of ninety-one; Malpighi, always\r\nin feeble health, but directing his energies with rare capacity,\r\nreaching the age of sixty-seven; while the great intensity of\r\nSwammerdam stopped his scientific career at thirty-six and burned out\r\nhis life at the age of forty-three.\r\n\r\nThey were all original and accurate observers, but there is variation\r\nin the kind and quality of their intellectual product. The two\r\nuniversity-trained men showed capacity for coherent observation; they\r\nwere both better able to direct their efforts toward some definite end;\r\nLeeuwenhoek, with the advantages of vigorous health and long working\r\nperiod, lacked the systematic training of the schools, and all his life\r\nwrought in discursive fashion; he left no coherent piece of work of\r\nany extent like Malpighi's _Anatome Plantarum_ or Swammerdam's _Anatomy\r\nand Metamorphosis of Insects_.\r\n\r\nSwammerdam was the most critical observer of the three, if we may\r\njudge by his labors in the same field as Malpighi's on the silkworm.\r\nHis descriptions are models of accuracy and completeness, and his\r\nanatomical work shows a higher grade of finish and completeness than\r\nMalpighi's. Malpighi, it seems to me, did more in the sum total than\r\neither of the others to advance the sciences of anatomy and physiology,\r\nand through them the interests of mankind. Leeuwenhoek had larger\r\nopportunity; he devoted himself to microscopic observations, but\r\nhe wandered over the whole field. While his observations lose all\r\nmonographic character, nevertheless they were important in opening new\r\nfields and advancing the sciences of anatomy, physiology, botany, and\r\nzoölogy.\r\n\r\nThe combined force of their labors marks an epoch characterized by the\r\nacceptance of the scientific method and the establishment of a new\r\ngrade of intellectual life. Through their efforts and that of their\r\ncontemporaries of lesser note the new intellectual movement was now\r\nwell under way.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Leeuwenhoek and the Rise of Histology._ The Asclepiad,\r\nVol. II, 1885.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE PROGRESS OF MINUTE ANATOMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe work of Malpighi, Swammerdam, and Leeuwenhoek stimulated\r\ninvestigations into the structure of minute animals, and researches\r\nin that field became a feature of the advance in the next century.\r\nConsiderable progress was made in the province of minute anatomy before\r\ncomparative anatomy grew into an independent subject.\r\n\r\nThe attractiveness of observations upon the life-histories and the\r\nstructure of insects, as shown particularly in the publications of\r\nMalpighi and Swammerdam, made those animals the favorite objects\r\nof study. The observers were not long in recognizing that some of\r\nthe greatest beauties of organic architecture are displayed in the\r\ninternal structure of insects. The delicate tracery of the organs,\r\ntheir minuteness and perfection are well calculated to awaken surprise.\r\nWell might those early anatomists be moved to enthusiasm over their\r\nresearches. Every excursion into this domain gave only beautiful\r\npictures of a mechanism of exquisite delicacy, and their wonder grew\r\ninto amazement. Here began a new train of ideas, in the unexpected\r\nrevelation that within the small compass of the body of an insect was\r\nembraced such a complex set of organs; a complete nervous system, fine\r\nbreathing-tubes, organs of circulation, of digestion, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nLyonet.--The first piece of structural work after Swammerdam's to which\r\nwe must give attention is that of Lyonet, who produced in the middle\r\nof the eighteenth century one of the most noteworthy monographs in\r\nthe field of minute anatomy. This was a work like that of Malpighi,\r\nupon the anatomy of a single form, but it was carried out in much\r\ngreater detail. The 137 figures on the 18 plates are models of close\r\nobservation and fine execution of drawings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Lyonet, 1707-1789.]\r\n\r\nLyonet (also written Lyonnet) was a Hollander, born in The Hague\r\nin 1707. He was a man of varied talents, a painter, a sculptor,\r\nan engraver, and a very gifted linguist. It is said that he was\r\nskilled in at least eight languages; and at one time he was the\r\ncipher secretary and confidential translator for the United Provinces\r\nof Holland. He was educated as a lawyer, but, from interest in the\r\nsubject, devoted most of his time to engraving objects of natural\r\nhistory. Among his earliest published drawings were the figures for\r\nLesser's _Theology of Insects_ (1742) and for Trembley's famous\r\ntreatise on _Hydra_ (1744).\r\n\r\nHis Great Monograph.--Finally Lyonet decided to branch out for himself,\r\nand produce a monograph on insect anatomy. After some preliminary work\r\non the sheep-tick, he settled upon the caterpillar of the goat moth,\r\nwhich lives upon the willow-tree. His work, first published in 1750,\r\nbore the title _Traité Anatomique de la Chenille qui ronge le bois de\r\nSaule_. In exploring the anatomy of the form chosen, he displayed not\r\nonly patience, but great skill as a dissector, while his superiority\r\nas a draughtsman was continually shown in his sketches. He engraved\r\nhis own figures on copper. The drawings are very remarkable for the\r\namount of detail that they show. He dissected this form with the same\r\nthoroughness with which medical men have dissected the human body.\r\nThe superficial muscles were carefully drawn and were then cut away\r\nin order to expose the next underlying layer which, in turn, was\r\nsketched and then removed. The amount of detail involved in this work\r\nmay be in part realized from the circumstance that he distinguished\r\n4,041 separate muscles. His sketches show these muscles accurately\r\ndrawn, and the principal ones are lettered. When he came to expose the\r\nnerves, he followed the minute branches to individual small muscles\r\nand sketched them, not in a diagrammatic way, but as accurate drawings\r\nfrom the natural object. The breathing-tubes were followed in the same\r\nmanner, and the other organs of the body were all dissected and drawn\r\nwith remarkable thoroughness. Lyonet was not trained in anatomy like\r\nMalpighi and Swammerdam, but being a man of unusual patience and manual\r\ndexterity, he accomplished notable results. His great quarto volume is,\r\nhowever, merely a description of the figures, and lacks the insight\r\nof a trained anatomist. His skill as a dissector is far ahead of his\r\nknowledge of anatomy, and he becomes lost in the details of his subject.\r\n\r\nExtraordinary Quality of the Drawings.--A few figures will serve to\r\nillustrate the character of his work, but the reduced reproductions\r\nwhich follow can not do justice to the copper plates of the original.\r\nFig. 23 gives a view of the external appearance of the caterpillar\r\nwhich was dissected. When the skin was removed from the outside the\r\nmuscles came into view, as shown in Fig. 24. This is a view from the\r\nventral side of the animal. On the left side the more superficial\r\nmuscles show, and on the right the next deeper layer.\r\n\r\nFig. 25 shows his dissection of the nerves. In this figure the muscles\r\nare indicated in outline, and the distribution of nerves to particular\r\nmuscles is shown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--Larva of the Willow Moth. (From Lyonet's\r\nMonograph, 1750.)]\r\n\r\nLyonet's dissection of the head is an extraordinary feat. The entire\r\nhead is not more than a quarter of an inch in diameter, but in a series\r\nof seven dissections he shows all of the internal organs in the head.\r\nFig. 26 shows two sketches exhibiting the nervous ganglia, the air\r\ntubes, and muscles of the head in their natural position.\r\n\r\nFig. 27 shows the nervous system of the head, including the extremely\r\nfine nervous masses which are designated the sympathetic nervous system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.\r\n\r\n Fig. 24.--Muscles of the Larva of the Willow Moth. (From Lyonet's\r\n Monograph.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.\r\n\r\n Fig. 25.--Central Nervous System and Nerves of the Same.]\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary character of the drawings in Lyonet's monograph\r\ncreated a sensation. The existence of such complicated structures\r\nwithin the body of an insect was discredited, and, furthermore, some\r\nof his critics declared that even if such a fine organization existed,\r\nit would be beyond human possibilities to expose the details as shown\r\nin his sketches. Accordingly, Lyonet was accused of drawing on his\r\nimagination. In order to silence his critics he published in the\r\nsecond edition of his work, in 1752, drawings of his instruments and a\r\ndescription of his methods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.--Dissection of the Head of the Larva of the\r\nWillow Moth.]\r\n\r\nLyonet intended to work out the anatomy of the chrysalis and the adult\r\nform of the same animal. In pursuance of this plan, he made many\r\ndissections and drawings, but, at the age of sixty, on account of the\r\ncondition of his eyes, he was obliged to stop all close work, and his\r\nproject remained unfinished. The sketches which he had accumulated were\r\npublished later, but they fall far short of those illustrating the\r\n_Traité Anatomique_. Lyonet died in 1789, at the age of eighty-one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.--The Brain and Head Nerves of the Same Animal.]\r\n\r\nRoesel, Réaumur, and De Geer on Insect Life.--We must also take note\r\nof the fact that, running parallel with this work on the anatomy of\r\ninsects, observations and publications had gone forward on form,\r\nhabits, and metamorphosis of insects, that did more to advance the\r\nknowledge of insect life than Lyonet's researches. Roesel, in Germany,\r\nRéaumur, in France, and De Geer, in Sweden, were all distinguished\r\nobservers in this line. Their works are voluminous and are well\r\nillustrated. Those of Réaumur and De Geer took the current French title\r\nof _Mémoires pour servir à l'Histoire des Insectes_. The plates with\r\nwhich the collected publications of each of the three men are provided\r\nshow many sketches of external form and details of external anatomy,\r\nbut very few illustrations of internal anatomy occur. The sketches of\r\nRoesel in particular are worthy of examination at the present time.\r\nSome of his masterly figures in color are fine examples of the art\r\nof painting in miniature. The name of Roesel (Fig. 28) is connected\r\nalso with the earliest observations of protoplasm and with a notable\r\npublication on the Batrachians.\r\n\r\nRéaumur (Fig. 29), who was distinguished for kindly and amiable\r\npersonal qualities, was also an important man in his influence upon\r\nthe progress of science. He was both physician and naturalist; he\r\nmade experiments upon the physiology of digestion, which aided in the\r\nunderstanding of that process; he invented the thermometer which bears\r\nhis name, and did other services for the advancement of science.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.--Roesel von Rosenhof, 1705-1759.]\r\n\r\nStraus-Dürckheim's Monograph on Insect Anatomy.--Insect anatomy\r\ncontinued to attract a number of observers, but we must go forward\r\ninto the nineteenth century before we find the subject taking a new\r\ndirection and merging into its modern phase. The remarkable monograph\r\nof Straus-Dürckheim represents the next step in the development of\r\ninsect anatomy toward the position that it occupies to-day. His aim\r\nis clearly indicated in the opening sentence of his preface: \"Having\r\nbeen for a long time occupied with the study of articulated animals, I\r\npropose to publish a general work upon the comparative anatomy of that\r\nbranch of the animal kingdom.\" He was working under the influence of\r\nCuvier, who, some years earlier, had founded the science of comparative\r\nanatomy and whom he recognized as his great exemplar. His work is\r\ndedicated to Cuvier, and is accompanied by a letter to that great\r\nanatomist expressing his thanks for encouragement and assistance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 29.--Réaumur, 1683-1757.]\r\n\r\nStraus-Dürckheim (1790-1865) intended that the general considerations\r\nshould be the chief feature of his monograph, but they failed in this\r\nparticular because, with the further developments in anatomy, including\r\nembryology and the cell-theory, his general discussions regarding the\r\narticulated animals became obsolete. The chief value of his work now\r\nlies in what he considered its secondary feature, _viz._, that of\r\nthe detailed anatomy of the cockchafer, one of the common beetles of\r\nEurope. Owing to changed conditions, therefore, it takes rank with\r\nthe work of Malpighi and Lyonet, as a monograph on a single form.\r\nOriginally he had intended to publish a series of monographs on the\r\nstructure of insects typical of the different families, but that upon\r\nthe cockchafer was the only one completed.\r\n\r\nComparison with the Sketches of Lyonet.--The quality of this work\r\nupon the anatomy of the cockchafer was excellent, and in 1824 it was\r\naccepted and crowned by the Royal Institute of France. The finely\r\nlithographed plates were prepared at the expense of the Institute, and\r\nthe book was published in 1828 with the following cumbersome title:\r\n_Considérations Générales sur l'Anatomie comparée des Animaux Articulés\r\nauxquelles on a joint l'Anatomie Descriptive du Melolontha Vulgaris\r\n(Hanneton) donnée comme example de l'Organisation des Coléoptères_.\r\nThe 109 sketches with which the plates are adorned are very beautiful,\r\nbut one who compares his drawings, figure by figure, with those of\r\nLyonet can not fail to see that those of the latter are more detailed\r\nand represent a more careful dissection. One illustration from\r\nStraus-Dürckheim will suffice to bring the achievements of the two men\r\ninto comparison.\r\n\r\nFig. 30 shows his sketch of the anatomy of the central nervous system.\r\nHe undertakes to show only the main branches of the nerves going to\r\nthe different segments of the body, while Lyonet brings to view the\r\ndistribution of the minute terminals to particular muscles. Comparison\r\nof other figures--notably that of the dissection of the head--will\r\nbring out the same point, _viz._, that Lyonet was more detailed than\r\nStraus-Dürckheim in his explorations of the anatomy of insects, and\r\nfully as accurate in drawing what he had seen.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the work of Straus-Dürckheim is conceived in a different\r\nspirit, and is the first serious attempt to make insect anatomy broadly\r\ncomparative.\r\n\r\nComment.--Such researches as those of Swammerdam, Lyonet, and\r\nStraus-Dürckheim represent a phase in the progress of the study of\r\nnature. Perhaps their chief value lies in the fact that they embody\r\nthe idea of critical observation. As examples of faithful, accurate\r\nobservations the researches helped to bring about that close study\r\nwhich is our only means of getting at basal facts. These men were all\r\nenlisted in the crusade against superficial observation. This had to\r\nhave its beginning, and when we witness it in its early stages, before\r\nthe researches have become illuminated by great ideas, the prodigious\r\neffort involved in the detailed researches may seem to be poorly\r\nexpended labor. Nevertheless, though the writings of these pioneers\r\nhave become obsolete, their work was of importance in helping to lift\r\nobservations upon nature to a higher level.\r\n\r\nDufour.--Léon Dufour extended the work of Straus-Dürckheim by\r\npublishing, between 1831 and 1834, researches upon the anatomy and\r\nphysiology of different families of insects. His aim was to found\r\na general science of insect anatomy. That he was unsuccessful in\r\naccomplishing this was owing partly to the absence of embryology and\r\nhistology from his method of study.\r\n\r\nNewport.--The thing most needed now was not greater devotion to details\r\nand a willingness to work, but a broadening of the horizon of ideas.\r\nThis arrived in the Englishman Newport, who was remarkable not only for\r\nhis skill as a dissector, but for his recognition of the importance\r\nof embryology in elucidating the problems of structure. His article\r\n\"Insecta\" in Todd's _Cyclopædia of Anatomy and Physiology_, in 1841,\r\nand his papers in the _Philosophical Transactions_ of the Royal Society\r\ncontain this new kind of research. Von Baer had founded embryology\r\nby his great work on the development of animals in 1828, before the\r\ninvestigations of Dufour, but it was reserved for Newport to recognize\r\nits great importance and to apply it to insect anatomy. He saw clearly\r\nthat, in order to comprehend his problems, the anatomist must take into\r\naccount the process of building the body, as well as the completed\r\narchitecture of the adult. The introduction of this important idea made\r\nhis achievement a distinct advance beyond that of his predecessors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.--Nervous System of the Cockchafer. (From\r\nStraus-Dürckheim's Monograph, 1828.)]\r\n\r\nLeydig.--Just as Newport was publishing his conclusions the cell-theory\r\nwas established (in 1838-39); and this was destined to furnish the\r\nbasis for a new advance. The influence of the doctrine that all tissues\r\nare composed of similar vital units, called cells, was far-reaching.\r\nInvestigators began to apply the idea in all directions, and there\r\nresulted a new department of anatomy, called histology. The subject\r\nof insect histology was an unworked field, but manifestly one of\r\nimportance. Franz Leydig (for portrait see p. 175) entered the new\r\nterritory with enthusiasm, and through his extensive investigations\r\nall structural studies upon insects assumed a new aspect. In 1864\r\nappeared his _Vom Bau des Thierchen Körpers_, which, together with\r\nhis special articles, created a new kind of insect anatomy based upon\r\nthe microscopic study of tissues. The application of this method of\r\ninvestigation is easy to see; just as it is impossible to understand\r\nthe working of a machine without a knowledge of its construction, so a\r\nknowledge of the working units of an organ is necessary to comprehend\r\nits action. For illustration, it is perfectly evident that we can not\r\nunderstand what is taking place in an organ for receiving sensory\r\nimpressions without first understanding its mechanism and the nature\r\nof the connections between it and the central part of the nervous\r\nsystem. The sensory organ is on the surface in order more readily to\r\nreceive impressions from the outside world. The sensory cells are\r\nalso modifications of surface cells, and, as a preliminary step to\r\nunderstanding their particular office, we must know the line along\r\nwhich they have become modified to fit them to receive stimulation.\r\n\r\nThen, if we attempt to follow in the imagination the way by which the\r\nsurface stimulations reach the central nervous system and affect it,\r\nwe must investigate all the connections. It thus appears that we must\r\nknow the intimate structure of an organ in order to understand its\r\nphysiology. Leydig supplied this kind of information for many organs of\r\ninsects. In his investigations we see the foundation of that delicate\r\nwork upon the microscopic structure of insects which is still going\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nSummary.--In this brief sketch we have seen that the study of insect\r\nanatomy, beginning with that of Malpighi and Swammerdam, was lifted to\r\na plane of greater exactitude by Lyonet and Straus-Dürckheim. It was\r\nfurther broadened by the researches of Dufour, and began to take on its\r\nmodern aspects, first, through the labors of Newport, who introduced\r\nembryology as a feature of investigation, and, finally, through\r\nLeydig's step in introducing histology. In the combination of the work\r\nof these two observers, the subject for the first time reached its\r\nproper position.\r\n\r\nThe studies of minute structure in the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies were by no means confined to insects; investigations were\r\nmade upon a number of other forms. Trembley, in the time of Lyonet,\r\nproduced his noteworthy memoirs upon the small fresh-water hydra\r\n(_Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire des polypes d'eau douce_, 1744);\r\nthe illustrations for which, as already stated, were prepared by\r\nLyonet. The structure of snails and other mollusks, of tadpoles,\r\nfrogs, and other batrachia, was also investigated. We have seen that\r\nSwammerdam, in the seventeenth century, had begun observations upon\r\nthe anatomy of tadpoles, frogs, and snails, and also upon the minute\r\ncrustacea commonly called water-fleas, which are just large enough\r\nto be distinguished by the unaided eye. We should remember also that\r\nin the same period the microscopic structure of plants began to be\r\ninvestigated, notably by Grew, Malpighi, and Leeuwenhoek (see Chapter\r\nIV).\r\n\r\nIn addition to those essays into minute anatomy, in which scalpel\r\nand scissors were employed, an endeavor of more subtle difficulty\r\nmade its appeal; there were forms of animal life of still smaller\r\nsize and simpler organization that began to engage the attention\r\nof microscopists. A brief account of the discovery and subsequent\r\nobservation of these microscopic animalcula will now occupy our\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Discovery of the Simplest Animals and the Progress of Observations\r\nupon Them\r\n\r\nThese single-celled animals, since 1845 called protozoa, have become\r\nof unusual interest to biologists, because in them the processes of\r\nlife are reduced to their simplest expression. The vital activities\r\ntaking place in the bodies of higher animals are too complicated and\r\ntoo intricately mixed to admit of clear analysis, and, long ago,\r\nphysiologists learned that the quest for explanations of living\r\nactivities lay along the line of investigating them in their most\r\nrudimentary expression. The practical recognition of this is seen in\r\nour recent text-books upon human physiology, which commonly begin with\r\ndiscussions of the life of these simplest organisms. That greatest\r\nof all text-books on general physiology, written by Max Verworn, is\r\ndevoted largely to experimental studies upon these simple organisms as\r\ncontaining the key to the similar activities (carried on in a higher\r\ndegree) in higher animals. This group of animals is so important as\r\na field of experimental observation that a brief account of their\r\ndiscovery and the progress of knowledge in reference to them will be in\r\nplace in this chapter.\r\n\r\nDiscovery of the Protozoa.--Leeuwenhoek left so little unnoticed in the\r\nmicroscopic world that we are prepared to find that he made the first\r\nrecorded observations upon these animalcula. His earliest observations\r\nwere communicated by letter to the Royal Society of London, and were\r\npublished in their _Transactions_ in 1677. It is very interesting to\r\nread his descriptions expressed in the archaic language of the time.\r\nThe following quotation from a Dutch letter turned into English will\r\nsuffice to give the flavor of his writing:\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1675 I discovered living creatures in rainwater which had\r\nstood but four days in a new earthen pot, glazed blew within. This\r\ninvited me to view the water with great attention, especially those\r\nlittle animals appearing to me ten thousand times less than those\r\nrepresented by Mons. Swammerdam, and by him called water-fleas or\r\nwater-lice, which may be perceived in the water with the naked eye.\r\nThe first sorte by me discovered in the said water, I divers times\r\nobserved to consist of five, six, seven or eight clear globules,\r\nwithout being able to discover any film that held them together or\r\ncontained them. When these _animalcula_, or living atoms, did move\r\nthey put forth two little horns, continually moving themselves; the\r\nplace between these two horns was flat, though the rest of the body was\r\nroundish, sharpening a little towards the end, where they had a tayle,\r\nnear four times the length of the whole body, of the thickness (by my\r\nmicroscope) of a spider's web; at the end of which appeared a globule,\r\nof the bigness of one of those which made up the body; which tayle I\r\ncould not perceive even in very clear water to be mov'd by them. These\r\nlittle creatures, if they chanced to light upon the least filament or\r\nstring, or other such particle, of which there are many in the water,\r\nespecially after it has stood some days, they stook entangled therein,\r\nextending their body in a long round, and striving to dis-entangle\r\ntheir tayle; whereby it came to pass, that their whole body lept\r\nback towards the globule of the tayle, which then rolled together\r\nserpent-like, and after the manner of copper or iron wire, that having\r\nbeen wound around a stick, and unwound again, retains those windings\r\nand turnings,\" etc.[2]\r\n\r\nAny one who has examined under the microscope the well-known\r\nbell-animalcule will recognize in this first description of it, the\r\nstalk, and its form after contraction under the designation of a 'tayle\r\nwhich retains those windings and turnings.'\r\n\r\nThere are many other descriptions, but the one given is typical of\r\nthe others. He found the little animals in water, in infusions of\r\npepper, and other vegetable substances, and on that account they came\r\nsoon to be designated infusoria. His observations were not at first\r\naccompanied by sketches, but in 1711 he sent some drawings with further\r\ndescriptions.\r\n\r\nO. Fr. Müller.--These animalcula became favorite objects of microscopic\r\nstudy. Descriptions began to accumulate and drawings to be made\r\nuntil it became evident that there were many different kinds. It\r\nwas, however, more than one hundred years after their discovery by\r\nLeeuwenhoek that the first standard work devoted exclusively to these\r\nanimalcula was published. This treatise by O. Fr. Müller was published\r\nin 1786 under the title of _Animalcula Infusoria_. The circumstance\r\nthat this volume of quarto size had 367 pages of description with 50\r\nplates of sketches will give some indication of the number of protozoa\r\nknown at that time.\r\n\r\nEhrenberg.--Observations in this domain kept accumulating, but the next\r\npublication necessary to mention is that of Ehrenberg (1795-1876). This\r\nscientific traveler and eminent observer was the author of several\r\nworks. He was one of the early observers of nerve fibres and of\r\nmany other structures of the animal frame. His book of the protozoa\r\nis a beautifully illustrated monograph consisting of 532 pages of\r\nletterpress and 69 plates of folio size. It was published in 1836\r\nunder the German title of _Die Infusionsthierchen als Vollkommene\r\nOrganismen_, or \"The Infusoria as Perfect Organisms.\" The animalcula\r\nwhich he so faithfully represented in his sketches have the habit,\r\nwhen feeding, of taking into the body collections of food-particles,\r\naggregated into spherical globules or food vacuoles. These are\r\ndistinctly separated, and slowly circulate around the single-celled\r\nbody while they are undergoing digestion. In a fully fed animal these\r\nfood-vacuoles occupy different positions, and are enclosed in globular\r\nspaces in the protoplasm, an adjustment that gave Ehrenberg the notion\r\nthat the animals possessed many stomachs. Accordingly he gave to them\r\nthe name \"Polygastrica,\" and assigned to them a much higher grade of\r\norganization than they really possess. These conclusions, based on\r\nthe general arrangement of food globules, seem very curious to us\r\nto-day. His publication was almost simultaneous with the announcement\r\nof the cell-theory (1838-39), the acceptance of which was destined to\r\noverthrow his conception of the protozoa, and to make it clear that\r\ntissues and organs can belong only to multicellular organisms.\r\n\r\nEhrenberg (Fig. 31) was a man of great scientific attainments, and\r\nnotwithstanding the grotesqueness of some of his conclusions, was held\r\nin high esteem as a scientific investigator. His observations were\r\naccurate, and the beautiful figures with which his work on the protozoa\r\nis embellished were executed with such fidelity regarding fine points\r\nof microscopic detail that they are of value to-day.\r\n\r\nDujardin, whom we shall soon come to know as the discoverer of\r\nprotoplasm, successfully combated the conclusions of Ehrenberg\r\nregarding the organization of the protozoa. For a time the great\r\nGerman scientist tried to maintain his point, that the infusoria have\r\nmany stomachs, but this was completely swept away, and finally the\r\ncontention of Von Siebold was adopted to the effect that these animals\r\nare each composed of a single cell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.--Ehrenberg, 1795-1876.]\r\n\r\nIn 1845 Stein is engrossed in proposing names for the suborders of\r\ninfusoria based upon the distribution of cilia upon their bodies. This\r\nsimple method of classification, as well as the names introduced by\r\nStein, is still in use.\r\n\r\nFrom Stein to Bütschli, one of the present authorities on the group,\r\nthere were many workers, but with the studies of Bütschli on protozoa\r\nwe enter the modern epoch.\r\n\r\nThe importance of these animals in affording a field for\r\nexperimentation on the simplest expressions of life has already\r\nbeen indicated. Many interesting problems have arisen in connection\r\nwith recent studies of them. The group embraces the very simplest\r\nmanifestations of animal life, and the experiments upon the different\r\nforms light the way for studies of the vital activities of the higher\r\nanimals. Some of the protozoa are disease-producing; as the microbe\r\nof malaria, of the sleeping sickness, etc., while, as is well known,\r\nmost diseases that have been traced to specific germs are caused by\r\nplants--the bacteria. Many experiments of Maupas, Caulkins and others\r\nhave a bearing upon the discussions regarding the immortality of the\r\nprotozoa, an idea which was at one time a feature of Weissmann's theory\r\nof heredity. Binet and others have discussed the evidences of psychic\r\nlife in these micro-organisms, and the daily activity of a protozoan\r\nbecame the field for observation and record in an American laboratory\r\nof psychology. The extensive studies of Jennings on the nature of their\r\nresponses to stimulations form a basis for some of the discussions on\r\nanimal behavior.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Kent's Manual of the Infusoria, Vol. I, p. 3. Quotation\r\nfrom the _Philosophical Transactions_ for the year 1677.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nLINNÆUS AND SCIENTIFIC NATURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nWe turn now from the purely anatomical side to consider the parallel\r\ndevelopment of the classification of animals and of plants. Descriptive\r\nnatural history reached a very low level in the early Christian\r\ncenturies, and remained there throughout the Middle Ages. The return to\r\nthe writings of Aristotle was the first influence tending to lift it\r\nto the position from which it had fallen. After the decline of ancient\r\ncivilization there was a period in which the writers of classical\r\nantiquity were not read. Not only were the writings of the ancient\r\nphilosophers neglected, but so also were those of the literary men as\r\nwell, the poets, the story-tellers, and the historians. As related\r\nin Chapter I, there were no observations of animated nature, and the\r\ngrowing tendency of the educated classes to envelop themselves in\r\nmetaphysical speculations was a feature of intellectual life.\r\n\r\nThe Physiologus or Sacred Natural History.--During this period of crude\r\nfancy, with a fog of mysticism obscuring all phenomena of nature,\r\nthere existed a peculiar kind of natural history that was produced\r\nunder theological influence. The manuscripts in which this sacred\r\nnatural history was embodied exist in various forms and in about a\r\ndozen languages of Eastern and Western Europe. The writings are known\r\nunder the general title of the Physiologus, or the Bestiarius. This\r\nserved for nearly a thousand years as the principal source of thought\r\nregarding natural history. It contains accounts of animals mentioned\r\nin the Bible and others of a purely mythical character. These are\r\nmade to be symbolical of religious beliefs, and are often accompanied\r\nby quotations of texts and by moral reflections. The phoenix rising\r\nfrom its ashes typifies the resurrection of Christ. In reference to\r\nyoung lions, the _Physiologus_ says: \"The lioness giveth birth to cubs\r\nwhich remain three days without life. Then cometh the lion, breatheth\r\nupon them, and bringeth them to life.... Thus it is that Jesus Christ\r\nduring three days was deprived of life, but God the Father raised\r\nhim gloriously.\" (Quoted from White, p. 35.) Besides forty or fifty\r\ncommon animals, the unicorn and the dragon of the Scriptures, and the\r\nfabled basilisk and phoenix of secular writings are described, and\r\nmorals are drawn from the stories about them. Some of the accounts of\r\nanimals, as the lion, the panther, the serpent, the weasel, etc., etc.,\r\nare so curious that, if space permitted, it would be interesting to\r\nquote them; but that would keep us too long from following the rise of\r\nscientific natural history from this basis.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the religious character of the contemplations of nature\r\nwas emphasized and the prevalence of theological influence in natural\r\nhistory is shown in various titles, as Lesser's _Theology of Insects_,\r\nSwammerdam's _Biblia Naturæ_, Spallanzani's _Tracts_, etc.\r\n\r\nThe zoölogy of the _Physiologus_ was of a much lower grade than any we\r\nknow about among the ancients, and it is a curious fact that progress\r\nwas made by returning to the natural history of fifteen centuries in\r\nthe past. The translation of Aristotle's writings upon animals, and\r\nthe disposition to read them, mark this advance. When, in the Middle\r\nAges, the boundaries of interest began to be extended, it came like\r\nan entirely new discovery, to find in the writings of the ancients a\r\nstorehouse of philosophic thought and a higher grade of learning than\r\nthat of the period. The translation and recopying of the writers of\r\nclassical antiquity was, therefore, an important step in the revival\r\nof learning. These writings were so much above the thought of the time\r\nthat the belief was naturally created that the ancients had digested\r\nall learning, and they were pointed to as unfailing authorities in\r\nmatters of science.\r\n\r\nThe Return to the Science of the Ancients.--The return to Aristotle\r\nwas wholesome, and under its influence men turned their attention once\r\nmore to real animals. Comments upon Aristotle began to be made, and in\r\ncourse of time independent treatises upon animals began to appear. One\r\nof the first to modify Aristotle to any purpose was Edward Wotton, the\r\nEnglish physician, who published in 1552 a book on the distinguishing\r\ncharacteristics of animals (_De Differentiis Animalium_). This was a\r\ncomplete treatise on the zoölogy of the period, including an account of\r\nthe different races of mankind. It was beautifully printed in Paris,\r\nand was dedicated to Edward VI. Although embracing ten books, it was\r\nby no means so ponderous as were some of the treatises that followed\r\nit. The work was based upon Aristotle, but the author introduced new\r\nmatter, and also added the group of zoöphytes, or plant-like animals of\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nGesner.--The next to reach a distinctly higher plane was Conrad Gesner\r\n(1516-1565), the Swiss, who was a contemporary of Vesalius. He was\r\na practising physician who, in 1553, was made professor of natural\r\nhistory in Zurich. A man of extraordinary talent and learning, he\r\nturned out an astonishing quantity of work. Besides accomplishing much\r\nin scientific lines, he translated from Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew, and\r\npublished in twenty volumes a universal catalogue of all works known\r\nin Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, either printed or in manuscript form. In\r\nthe domain of natural history he began to look critically at animals\r\nwith a view to describing them, and to collect with zealous care new\r\nobservations upon their habits. His great work on natural history\r\n(_Historia Animalium_) began to appear in 1551, when he was thirty-five\r\nyears of age, and four of the five volumes were published by 1556.\r\nThe fifth volume was not published until 1587, twenty-two years after\r\nhis death. The complete work consists of about \"4,500 folio pages,\"\r\nprofusely illustrated with good figures. The edition which the writer\r\nhas before him--that of 1585-1604--embraces 3,200 pages of text and 953\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nBrooks says: \"One of Gesner's greatest services to natural science is\r\nthe introduction of good illustrations, which he gives his reader by\r\nhundreds.\" He was so exacting about the quality of his illustrations\r\nthat his critical supervision of the work of artists and engravers had\r\nits influence upon contemporary art. Some of the best woodcuts of the\r\nperiod are found in his work. His friend Albrecht Dürer supplied one of\r\nthe originals--the drawing of the rhinoceros--and it is interesting to\r\nnote that it is by no means the best, a circumstance which indicates\r\nhow effectively Gesner held his engraver and draughtsman up to fine\r\nwork. He was also careful to mold his writing into graceful form, and\r\nthis, combined with the illustrations, \"made science attractive without\r\nsacrificing its dignity, and thus became a great educational influence.\"\r\n\r\nIn preparing his work he sifted the writings of about two hundred\r\nand fifty authors, and while his book is largely a compilation, it\r\nis enriched with many observations of his own. His descriptions are\r\nverbose, but discriminating in separating facts and observations\r\nfrom fables and speculations. He could not entirely escape from old\r\ntraditions. There are retained in his book pictures of the sea-serpent,\r\nthe mermaids, and a few other fanciful and grotesque sketches, but\r\nfor the most part the drawings are made from the natural objects. The\r\ndescriptions are in several parts of his work alphabetically arranged,\r\nfor convenience of reference, and thus animals that were closely\r\nrelated are often widely separated.\r\n\r\nGesner (Fig. 32) sacrificed his life to professional zeal during the\r\nprevalence of the plague in Zurich in 1564. Having greatly overworked\r\nin the care of the sick, he was seized with the disease, and died at\r\nthe age of forty-nine.\r\n\r\nConsidered from the standpoint of descriptions and illustrations,\r\nGesner's _Historia Animalium_ remained for a long time the best work in\r\nzoölogy. He was the best zoölogist between Aristotle and John Ray, the\r\nimmediate predecessor of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.--Gesner 1516-1565.]\r\n\r\nJonston and Aldrovandi.--At about the same period as Gesner's work\r\nthere appeared two other voluminous publications, which are well\r\nknown--those of Jonston, the Scot (_Historia Animalium_, 1549-1553),\r\nand Aldrovandi, the Italian (_Opera_, 1599-1606). The former consisted\r\nof four folio volumes, and the latter of thirteen, of ponderous size,\r\nto which was added a fourteenth on plants. Jonston's works were\r\ntranslated, and were better known in England than those of Gesner and\r\nAldrovandi. The wood-engravings in Aldrovandi's volume are coarser than\r\nthose of Gesner, and are by no means so lifelike. In the Institute at\r\nBologna are preserved twenty volumes of figures of animals in color,\r\nwhich were the originals from which the engravings were made. These are\r\nsaid to be much superior to the reproductions. The encyclopædic nature\r\nof the writings of Gesner, Aldrovandi, and Jonston has given rise to\r\nthe convenient and expressive title of the encyclopædists.\r\n\r\nRay.--John Ray, the forerunner of Linnæus, built upon the foundations\r\nof Gesner and others, and raised the natural-history edifice a tier\r\nhigher. He greatly reduced the bulk of publications on natural history,\r\nsifting from Gesner and Aldrovandi their irrelevancies, and thereby\r\ngiving a more modern tone to scientific writings. He was the son of\r\na blacksmith, and was born in southern England in 1628. The original\r\nform of the family name was Wray. He was graduated at the University\r\nof Cambridge, and became a fellow of Trinity College. Here he formed a\r\nfriendship with Francis Willughby, a young man of wealth whose tastes\r\nfor natural history were like his own. This association proved a happy\r\none for both parties. Ray had taken orders in the Church of England,\r\nand held his university position as a cleric; but, from conscientious\r\nscruples, he resigned his fellowship in 1662. Thereafter he received\r\nfinancial assistance from Willughby, and the two men traveled\r\nextensively in Great Britain and on the Continent, with the view of\r\ninvestigating the natural history of the places that they visited. On\r\nthese excursions Willughby gave particular attention to animals and\r\nRay to plants. Of Ray's several publications in botany, his _Historia\r\nPlantarum_ in three volumes (1686-1704) is the most extensive. In\r\nanother work, as early as 1682, he had proposed a new classification\r\nof plants, which in the next century was adopted by Jussieu, and which\r\ngives Ray a place in the history of botany.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.--John Ray, 1628-1705.]\r\n\r\nWillughby died in 1662, at the age of thirty-eight, leaving an annuity\r\nto Ray, and charging him with the education of his two sons, and the\r\nediting of his manuscripts. Ray performed these duties as a faithful\r\nfriend and in a generous spirit. He edited and published Willughby's\r\nbook on birds (1678) and fishes (1686) with important additions of his\r\nown, for which he sought no credit.\r\n\r\nAfter completing his tasks as the literary executor of Willughby,\r\nhe returned in 1678 to his birthplace and continued his studies in\r\nnatural history. In 1691 he published \"The Wisdom of God manifested in\r\nthe Works of the Creation,\" which was often reprinted, and became the\r\nforerunner of the works on natural theology like Paley's, etc. This was\r\nan amplification of ideas he had embodied in a sermon thirty-one years\r\nearlier, and which at that time attracted much notice. He now devoted\r\nhimself largely to the study of animals, and in 1693 published a work\r\non the quadrupeds and serpents, a work which gave him high rank in the\r\nhistory of the classification of animals. He died in 1705, but he had\r\naccomplished much good work, and was not forgotten. In 1844 there was\r\nfounded, in London, in his memory, the Ray Society for the publication\r\nof rare books on botany and zoölogy.\r\n\r\nRay's Idea of Species.--One of the features of Ray's work, in the\r\nlight of subsequent development, is of special interest, and that is\r\nhis limiting of species. He was the first to introduce into natural\r\nhistory an exact conception of species. Before his time the word had\r\nbeen used in an indefinite sense to embrace groups of greater or less\r\nextent, but Ray applied it to individuals derived from similar parents,\r\nthus making the term species stand for a particular kind of animal or\r\nplant. He noted some variations among species, and did not assign to\r\nthem that unvarying and constant character ascribed to them by Linnæus\r\nand his followers. Ray also made use of anatomy as the foundation\r\nfor zoölogical classification, and introduced great precision and\r\nclearness into his definitions of groups of animals and plants. In the\r\nparticulars indicated above he represents a great advance beyond any of\r\nhis precursors, and marks the parting of the ways between mediæval and\r\nmodern natural history.\r\n\r\nIn Germany Klein (1685-1759) elaborated a system of classification\r\nembracing the entire animal kingdom. His studies were numerous, and\r\nhis system would have been of much wider influence in molding natural\r\nhistory had it not been overshadowed by that of Linnæus.\r\n\r\nLinnæus or Linné.--The service of Linnæus to natural history was\r\nunique. The large number of specimens of animals and plants, ever\r\nincreasing through the collections of travelers and naturalists, were\r\nin a confused state, and there was great ambiguity arising from the\r\nlack of a methodical way of arranging and naming them. They were known\r\nby verbose descriptions and local names. No scheme had as yet been\r\ndevised for securing uniformity in applying names to them. The same\r\nanimal and plant had different names in the different sections of a\r\ncountry, and often different plants and animals had the same name.\r\nIn different countries, also, their names were greatly diversified.\r\nWhat was especially needed was some great organizing mind to catalogue\r\nthe animals and plants in a systematic way, and to give to natural\r\nscience a common language. Linnæus possessed this methodizing mind and\r\nsupplied the need. While he did little to deepen the knowledge of the\r\norganization of animal and plant life, he did much to extend the number\r\nof known forms; he simplified the problem of cataloguing them, and he\r\ninvented a simple method of naming them which was adopted throughout\r\nthe world. By a happy stroke he gave to biology a new language that\r\nremains in use to-day. The tremendous influence of this may be realized\r\nwhen we remember that naturalists everywhere use identical names for\r\nthe same animals and plants. The residents of Japan, of Italy, of\r\nSpain, of all the world, in fact, as was just said, employ the same\r\nLatin names in classifying organic forms.\r\n\r\nHe also inspired many students with a love for natural history and gave\r\nan impulse to the advance of that science which was long felt. We can\r\nnot gainsay that a higher class of service has been rendered by those\r\nof philosophic mind devoted to the pursuit of comparative anatomy,\r\nbut the step of Linnæus was a necessary one, and aided greatly in the\r\nprogress of natural history. Without this step the discoveries and\r\nobservations of others would not have been so readily understood, and\r\nhad it not been for his organizing force all natural science would\r\nhave been held back for want of a common language. A close scrutiny of\r\nthe practice among naturalists in the time of Linnæus shows that he\r\ndid not actually invent the binomial nomenclature, but by adopting the\r\nsuggestions of others he elaborated the system of classification and\r\nbrought the new language into common use.\r\n\r\nPersonal History.--Leaving for the present the system of Linnæus, we\r\nshall give attention to the personal history of the man. The great\r\nSwedish naturalist was born in Rashult in 1707. His father was the\r\npastor of the village, and intended his eldest son, Carl, for the same\r\nhigh calling. The original family name was Ignomarsen, but it had been\r\nchanged to Lindelius, from a tall linden-tree growing in that part of\r\nthe country. In 1761 a patent of nobility was granted by the crown to\r\nLinnæus, and thereafter he was styled Carl von Linné.\r\n\r\nHis father's resources were very limited, but he managed to send his\r\nson to school, though it must be confessed that young Linnæus showed\r\nlittle liking for the ordinary branches of instruction. His time\r\nwas spent in collecting natural-history specimens, and his mind was\r\nengaged in thinking about them. The reports of his low scholarship\r\nand the statement of one of his teachers that he showed no aptitude\r\nfor learning were so disappointing to his father that, in 1726, he\r\nprepared to apprentice Carl to a shoemaker, but was prevented from\r\ndoing so through the encouragement of a doctor who, being able to\r\nappreciate the quality of mind possessed by the young Linnæus, advised\r\nallowing him to study medicine instead of preparing for theology.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, with a sum amounting to about $40, all his father could\r\nspare, he set off for the University of Lund, to pursue the study of\r\nmedicine. He soon transferred to the University of Upsala, where the\r\nadvantages were greater. His poverty placed him under the greatest\r\nstraits for the necessities of life, and he enjoyed no luxuries. While\r\nin the university he mended his shoes, and the shoes which were given\r\nto him by some of his companions, with paper and birch-bark, to keep\r\nhis feet from the damp earth. But his means did not permit of his\r\ntaking his degree at Upsala, and it was not until eight years later, in\r\n1735, that he received his degree in Holland.\r\n\r\nAt Upsala he was relieved from his extreme poverty by obtaining an\r\nassistant's position, and so great was his knowledge of plants that he\r\nwas delegated to read the lectures of the aged professor of botany,\r\nRudbeck.\r\n\r\nIn 1732 he was chosen by the Royal Society of Upsala to visit Lapland\r\nas a collector and observer, and left the university without his\r\ndegree. On returning to Upsala, his lack of funds made itself again\r\npainfully felt, and he undertook to support himself by giving public\r\nlectures on botany, chemistry, and mineralogy. He secured hearers, but\r\nthe continuance of his lectures was prevented by one of his rivals\r\non the ground that Linnæus had no degree, and was therefore legally\r\ndisqualified from taking pay for instruction. Presently he became\r\ntutor and traveling companion of a wealthy baron, the governor of the\r\nprovince of Dalecarlia, but this employment was temporary.\r\n\r\nHelped by His Fiancée.--His friends advised him to secure his medical\r\ndegree and settle as a practitioner. Although he lacked the necessary\r\nfunds, one circumstance contributed to bring about this end: he had\r\nformed an attachment for the daughter of a wealthy physician, named\r\nMoré or Moræus, and on applying for her hand in marriage, her father\r\nmade it a condition of his consent that Linnæus should take his\r\nmedical degree and establish himself in the practice of medicine. The\r\nyoung lady, who was thrifty as well as handsome, offered her savings,\r\namounting to one hundred dollars (Swedish), to her lover. He succeeded\r\nin adding to this sum by his own exertions, and with thirty-six\r\nSwedish ducats set off for Holland to qualify for his degree. He had\r\npractically met the requirements for the medical degree by his previous\r\nstudies, and after a month's residence at the University of Hardewyk,\r\nhis thesis was accepted and he was granted the degree in June, 1735, in\r\nthe twenty-eighth year of his age.\r\n\r\nInstead of returning at once to Sweden, he went to Leyden, and made the\r\nacquaintance of several well-known scientific men. He continued his\r\nbotanical studies with great energy, and now began to reap the benefits\r\nof his earlier devotion to natural history. His heart-breaking and\r\nharassing struggles were now over.\r\n\r\nThe Systema Naturæ.--He had in his possession the manuscript of his\r\n_Systema Naturæ_, and with the encouragement of his new friends\r\nit was published in the same year. The first edition (1735) of\r\nthat notable work, which was afterward to bring him so much fame,\r\nconsisted of twelve printed folio pages. It was merely an outline of\r\nthe arrangements of plants, animals, and minerals in a methodical\r\ncatalogue. This work passed through twelve editions during his\r\nlifetime, the last one appearing in 1768. After the first edition,\r\nthe books were printed in octavo form, and in the later editions were\r\ngreatly enlarged. A copy of the first edition was sent to Boerhaave,\r\nthe most distinguished professor in the University of Leyden, and\r\nsecured for Linnæus an interview with that distinguished physician,\r\nwho treated him with consideration and encouraged him in his work.\r\nBoerhaave was already old, and had not long to live; and when Linnæus\r\nwas about to leave Holland in 1738, he admitted him to his sick-chamber\r\nand bade him a most affectionate adieu, and encouraged him to further\r\nwork by most kindly and appreciative expressions.\r\n\r\nThrough the influence of Boerhaave, Linnæus became the medical\r\nattendant of Cliffort, the burgomaster at Amsterdam, who had a large\r\nbotanic garden. Cliffort, being desirous of extending his collections,\r\nsent Linnæus to England, where he met Sir Hans Sloane and other eminent\r\nscientific men of Great Britain. After a short period he returned\r\nto Holland, and in 1737 brought out the _Genera Plantarum_, a very\r\noriginal work, containing an analysis of all the genera of plants. He\r\nhad previously published, besides the _Systema Naturæ_, his _Fundamenta\r\nBotanica_, 1735, and _Bibliotheca Botanica_, 1736, and these works\r\nserved to spread his fame as a botanist throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nHis Wide Recognition.--An illustration of his wide recognition is\r\nafforded by an anecdote of his first visit to Paris in 1738. \"On his\r\narrival he went first to the Garden of Plants, where Bernard de Jussieu\r\nwas describing some exotics in Latin. He entered without opportunity to\r\nintroduce himself. There was one plant which the demonstrator had not\r\nyet determined, and which seemed to puzzle him. The Swede looked on in\r\nsilence, but observing the hesitation of the learned professor, cried\r\nout '_Hæc planta faciem Americanam habet_.' 'It has the appearance\r\nof an American plant.' Jussieu, surprised, turned about quickly and\r\nexclaimed 'You are Linnæus.' 'I am, sir,' was the reply. The lecture\r\nwas stopped, and Bernard gave the learned stranger an affectionate\r\nwelcome.\"\r\n\r\nReturn to Sweden.--After an absence of three and one-half years,\r\nLinnæus returned to his native country in 1738, and soon after was\r\nmarried to the young woman who had assisted him and had waited for him\r\nso loyally. He settled in Stockholm and began the practice of medicine.\r\nIn the period of his absence he had accomplished much: visited\r\nHolland, England, and France, formed the acquaintance of many eminent\r\nnaturalists, obtained his medical degree, published numerous works on\r\nbotany, and extended his fame over all Europe. In Stockholm, however,\r\nhe was for a time neglected, and he would have left his native country\r\nin disgust had it not been for the dissuasion of his wife.\r\n\r\nProfessor in Upsala.--In 1741 he was elected professor of anatomy in\r\nthe University of Upsala, but by a happy stroke was able to exchange\r\nthat position for the professorship of botany, materia medica, and\r\nnatural history that had fallen to his former rival, Rosen. Linnæus\r\nwas now in his proper element; he had opportunity to lecture on those\r\nsubjects to which he had been devotedly attached all his life, and he\r\nentered upon the work with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nHe attracted numerous students by the power of his personal qualities\r\nand the excellence of his lectures. He became the most popular\r\nprofessor in the University of Upsala, and, owing to his drawing power,\r\nthe attendance at the university was greatly increased. In 1749 he\r\nhad 140 students devoted to studies in natural history. The number of\r\nstudents at the university had been about 500; \"whilst he occupied\r\nthe chair of botany there it rose to 1,500.\" A part of this increase\r\nwas due to other causes, but Linnæus was the greatest single drawing\r\nforce in the university. He was an eloquent as well as an enthusiastic\r\nlecturer, and he aroused great interest among his students, and he gave\r\nan astonishing impulse to the study of natural history in general, and\r\nto botany in particular. Thus Linnæus, after having passed through\r\ngreat privations in his earlier years, found himself, at the age of\r\nthirty-four, established in a position which brought him recognition,\r\nhonor, and large emolument.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.--Linnæus at Sixty, 1707-1778.]\r\n\r\nIn May, 1907, the University of Upsala celebrated the two hundredth\r\nanniversary of his birth with appropriate ceremonies. Delegations of\r\nscientific men from all over the world were in attendance to do honor\r\nto the memory of the great founder of biological nomenclature.\r\n\r\nPersonal Appearance.--The portrait of Linnæus at the age of sixty is\r\nshown in Fig. 34. He was described as of \"medium height, with large\r\nlimbs, brown, piercing eyes, and acute vision.\" His hair in early youth\r\nwas nearly white, and changed in his manhood to brown, and became gray\r\nwith the advance of age. Although quick-tempered, he was naturally of\r\na kindly disposition, and secured the affection of his students, with\r\nwhom he associated and worked in the most informal way. His love of\r\napprobation was very marked, and he was so much praised that his desire\r\nfor fame became his dominant passion. The criticism to which his work\r\nwas subjected from time to time accordingly threw him into fits of\r\ndespondency and rage.\r\n\r\nHis Influence upon Natural History.--However much we may admire the\r\nindustry and force of Linnæus, we must admit that he gave to natural\r\nhistory a one-sided development, in which the more essential parts\r\nof the science received scant recognition. His students, like their\r\nmaster, were mainly collectors and classifiers. \"In their zeal for\r\nnaming and classifying, the higher goal of investigation, knowledge of\r\nthe nature of animals and plants, was lost sight of and the interest in\r\nanatomy, physiology, and embryology lagged.\"\r\n\r\nR. Hertwig says of him: \"For while he in his _Systema Naturæ_ treated\r\nof an extraordinarily larger number of animals than any earlier\r\nnaturalist, he brought about no deepening of our knowledge. The\r\nmanner in which he divided the animal kingdom, in comparison with the\r\nAristotelian system, is to be called rather a retrogression than an\r\nadvance. Linnæus divided the animal kingdom into six classes--Mammalia,\r\nAves, Amphibia, Pisces, Insecta, Vermes. The first four classes\r\ncorrespond to Aristotle's four groups of animals with blood. In the\r\ndivision of the invertebrated animals into Insecta and Vermes Linnæus\r\nstands undoubtedly behind Aristotle, who attempted, and in part indeed\r\nsuccessfully, to set up a larger number of groups.\r\n\r\n\"But in his successors even more than in Linnæus himself we see the\r\ndamage wrought by the purely systematic method of consideration. The\r\ndiagnoses of Linnæus were for the most part models, which, _mutatis\r\nmutandis_, could be employed for new species with little trouble.\r\nThere was needed only some exchanging of adjectives to express the\r\ndifferences. With the hundreds of thousands of different species of\r\nanimals, there was no lack of material, and so the arena was opened\r\nfor that spiritless zoölogy of species-making, which in the first\r\nhalf of the nineteenth century brought zoölogy into such discredit.\r\nZoölogy would have been in danger of growing into a Tower of Babel\r\nof species-description if a counterpoise had not been created in the\r\nstrengthening of the physiologico-anatomical method of consideration.\"\r\n\r\nHis Especial Service.--Nevertheless, the work of Linnæus made a lasting\r\nimpression upon natural history, and we shall do well to get clearly\r\nin mind the nature of his particular service. In the first place, he\r\nbrought into use the method of naming animals and plants which is\r\nemployed to-day. In his _Systema Naturæ_ and in other publications he\r\nemployed a means of naming every natural production in two words, and\r\nit is therefore called the binomial nomenclature. An illustration will\r\nmake this clearer. Those animals which had close resemblance, like the\r\nlion, tiger, leopard, the lynx, and the cat, he united under the common\r\ngeneric name of _Felis_, and gave to each a particular trivial name,\r\nor specific name. Thus the name of the lion became _Felis leo_, of the\r\ntiger _Felis tigris_, of the leopard _Felis pardus_, of the cat Felis\r\ncatus; and to these the modern zoölogists have added, making the Canada\r\nlynx _Felis Canadensis_, the domestic cat _Felis domesticata_, etc. In\r\na similar way, the dog-like animals were united into a genus designated\r\n_Canis_, and the particular kinds or species became _Canis lupus_,\r\nthe wolf, _Canis vulpes_, the fox, _Canis familiaris_, the common dog.\r\nThis simple method took the place of the varying names applied to the\r\nsame animal in different countries and local names in the same country.\r\nIt recognized at once their generic likeness and their specific\r\nindividuality.\r\n\r\nAll animals, plants, and minerals were named according to this method.\r\nThus there were introduced into nomenclature two groups, the genus and\r\nthe species. The name of the genus was a noun, and that of the species\r\nan adjective agreeing with it. In the choice of these names Linnæus\r\nsought to express some distinguishing feature that would be suggestive\r\nof the particular animal, plant, or mineral. The trivial, or specific,\r\nnames were first employed by Linnæus in 1749, and were introduced into\r\nhis _Species Plantarum_ in 1753, and into the tenth edition of his\r\n_Systema Naturæ_ in 1758.\r\n\r\nWe recognize Linnæus as the founder of nomenclature in natural history,\r\nand by the common consent of naturalists the date 1758 has come to be\r\naccepted as the starting-point for determining the generic and specific\r\nnames of animals. The much vexed question of priority of names for\r\nanimals is settled by going back to the tenth edition of his _Systema\r\nNaturæ_, while the botanists have adopted his _Species Plantarum_,\r\n1753, as their base-line for names. As to his larger divisions of\r\nanimals and plants, he recognized classes and orders. Then came genera\r\nand species. Linnæus did not use the term family in his formulæ; this\r\nconvenient designation was first used and introduced in 1780 by Batch.\r\n\r\nThe _Systema Naturæ_ is not a treatise on the organization of\r\nanimals and plants; it is rather a catalogue of the productions of\r\nnature methodically arranged. His aim in fact was not to give full\r\ndescriptions, but to make a methodical arrangement.\r\n\r\nTo do justice, however, to the discernment of Linnæus, it should\r\nbe added that he was fully aware of the artificial nature of his\r\nclassification. As Kerner has said: \"It is not the fault of this\r\naccomplished and renowned naturalist if a greater importance were\r\nattached to his system than he himself ever intended. Linnæus never\r\nregarded his twenty-four classes as real and natural divisions of the\r\nvegetable kingdom, and specifically says so; it was constructed for\r\nconvenience of reference and identification of species. A real natural\r\nsystem, founded on the true affinities of plants as indicated by the\r\nstructural characters, he regarded as the highest aim of botanical\r\nendeavor. He never completed a natural system, leaving only a fragment\r\n(published in 1738).\"\r\n\r\nTerseness of Descriptions.--His descriptions were marked by extreme\r\nbrevity, but by great clearness. This is a second feature of his work.\r\nIn giving the diagnosis of a form he was very terse. He did not employ\r\nfully formed sentences containing a verb, but words concisely put\r\ntogether so as to bring out the chief things he wished to emphasize. As\r\nan illustration of this, we may take his characterization of the forest\r\nrose, \"_Rosa sylvestris vulgaris, flore odorata incarnato_.\" The common\r\nrose of the forest with a flesh-colored, sweet-smelling flower. In thus\r\nfixing the attention upon essential points he got rid of verbiage, a\r\nstep that was of very great importance.\r\n\r\nHis Idea of Species.--A third feature of his work was that of\r\nemphasizing the idea of species. In this he built upon the work of\r\nRay. We have already seen that Ray was the first to define species\r\nand to bring the conception into natural history. Ray had spoken of\r\nthe variability of species, but Linnæus, in his earlier publications,\r\ndeclared that they were constant and invariable. His conception of\r\na species was that of individuals born from similar parents. It was\r\nassumed that at the original stocking of the earth, one pair of each\r\nkind of animals was created, and that existing species were the direct\r\ndescendants without change of form or habit from the original pair.\r\nAs to their number, he said: \"_Species tot sunt, quot formæ ab initio\r\ncreatæ sunt_\"--there are just so many species as there were forms\r\ncreated in the beginning; and his oft-quoted remark, \"_Nulla species\r\nnova_,\" indicates in terse language his position as to the formation\r\nof new species. Linnæus took up this idea as expressing the current\r\nthought, without analysis of what was involved in it. He readily might\r\nhave seen that if there were but a single pair of each kind, some of\r\nthem must have been sacrificed to the hunger of the carnivorous kinds:\r\nbut, better than making any theories, he might have looked for evidence\r\nin nature as to the fixity of species.\r\n\r\nWhile Linnæus first pronounced upon the fixity of species, it is\r\ninteresting to note that his extended observations upon nature led him\r\nto see that variation among animals and plants is common and extensive,\r\nand accordingly in the later editions of his _Systema Naturæ_ we find\r\nhim receding from the position that species are fixed and constant.\r\nNevertheless, it was owing to his influence, more than to that of any\r\nother writer of the period, that the dogma of fixity of species was\r\nestablished. His great contemporary Buffon looked upon species as\r\nnot having a fixed reality in nature, but as being figments of the\r\nimagination; and we shall see in a later section of this book how the\r\nidea of Linnæus in reference to the fixity of species gave way to\r\naccumulating evidence on the matter.\r\n\r\nSummary.--The chief services of Linnæus to natural science consisted\r\nof these three things: bringing into current use the binomial\r\nnomenclature, the introduction of terse formulæ for description, and\r\nfixing attention upon species. The first two were necessary steps;\r\nthey introduced clearness and order into the management of the immense\r\nnumber of details, and they made it possible for the observations\r\nand discoveries of others to be understood and to take their place in\r\nthe great system of which he was the originator. The effect of the\r\nlast step was to direct the attention of naturalists to species, and\r\nthereby to pave the way for the coming consideration of their origin, a\r\nconsideration which became such a burning question in the last half of\r\nthe nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nReform of the Linnæan System\r\n\r\nNecessity of Reform.--As indicated above, the classification\r\nestablished by Linnæus had grave defects; it was not founded on a\r\nknowledge of the comparative structure of animals and plants, but in\r\nmany instances upon superficial features that were not distinctive\r\nin determining their position and relationships. His system was\r\nessentially an artificial one, a convenient key for finding the names\r\nof animals and plants, but doing violence to the natural arrangement of\r\nthose organisms. An illustration of this is seen in his classification\r\nof plants into classes, mainly on the basis of the number of stamens\r\nin the flower, and into orders according to the number of pistils.\r\nMoreover, the true object of investigation was obscured by the Linnæan\r\nsystem. The chief aim of biological study being to extend our knowledge\r\nof the structure, development, and physiology of animals and plants\r\nas a means of understanding more about their life, the arrangement of\r\nanimals and plants into groups should be the outcome of such studies\r\nrather than an end in itself.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to follow different methods to bring natural history\r\nback into the line of true progress. The first modification of\r\nimportance to the Linnæan system was that of Cuvier, who proposed\r\na grouping of animals based upon a knowledge of their comparative\r\nanatomy. He declared that animals exhibit four types of organization,\r\nand his types were substituted for the primary groups of Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe Scale of Being.--In order to understand the bearing of Cuvier's\r\nconclusions we must take note of certain views regarding the animal\r\nkingdom that were generally accepted at the time of his writing.\r\nBetween Linnæus and Cuvier there had emerged the idea that all animals,\r\nfrom the lowest to the highest, form a graduated series. This grouping\r\nof animals into a linear arrangement was called exposing the Scale of\r\nBeing, or the Scale of Nature (_Scala Naturæ_). Buffon, Lamarck, and\r\nBonnet were among the chief exponents of this idea.\r\n\r\nThat Lamarck's connection with it was temporary has been generally\r\noverlooked. It is the usual statement in the histories of natural\r\nscience, as in the _Encyclopædia Britannica_, in the History of Carus,\r\nand in Thomson's _Science of Life_, that the idea of the scale of\r\nnature found its fullest expression in Lamarck. Thomson says: \"His\r\nclassification (1801-1812) represents the climax of the attempt to\r\narrange the groups of animals in linear order from lower to higher, in\r\nwhat was called a _scala naturæ_\" (p. 14). Even so careful a writer as\r\nRichard Hertwig has expressed the matter in a similar form. Now, while\r\nLamarck at first adopted a linear classification, it is only a partial\r\nreading of his works that will support the conclusion that he held to\r\nit. In his _Système des Animaux sans Vertèbres_, published in 1801, he\r\narranged animals in this way; but to do credit to his discernment, it\r\nshould be observed that he was the first to employ a genealogical tree\r\nand to break up the serial arrangement of animal forms. In 1809, in the\r\nsecond volume of his _Philosophie Zoologique_, as Packard has pointed\r\nout, he arranged animals according to their relationships, in the form\r\nof a trunk with divergent branches. This was no vague suggestion on\r\nhis part, but an actual pictorial representation of the relationship\r\nbetween different groups of animals, as conceived by him. Although a\r\ncrude attempt, it is interesting as being the first of its kind. This\r\nis so directly opposed to the idea of scale of being that we make note\r\nof the fact that Lamarck forsook that view at least twenty years before\r\nthe close of his life and substituted for it that of the genealogical\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nLamarck's Position in Science.--Lamarck is coming into full recognition\r\nfor his part in founding the evolution theory, but he is not generally,\r\nas yet, given due credit for his work in zoölogy. He was the most\r\nphilosophical thinker engaged with zoölogy at the close of the\r\neighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century. He was greater\r\nthan Cuvier in his reach of intellect and in his discernment of the\r\ntrue relationships among living organisms. We are to recollect that\r\nhe forsook the dogma of fixity of species, to which Cuvier held, and\r\nfounded the first comprehensive theory of organic evolution. To-day we\r\ncan recognize the superiority of his mental grasp over that of Cuvier,\r\nbut, owing to the personal magnetism of the latter and to his position,\r\nthe ideas of Lamarck, which Cuvier combated, received but little\r\nattention when they were promulgated. We shall have occasion in a later\r\nchapter to speak more fully of Lamarck's contribution to the progress\r\nof biological thought.\r\n\r\nCuvier's Four Branches.--We now return to the type-theory of Cuvier.\r\nBy extended studies in comparative anatomy, he came to the conclusion\r\nthat animals are constructed upon four distinct plans or types: the\r\nvertebrate type; the molluscan type; the articulated type, embracing\r\nanimals with joints or segments; and the radiated type, the latter with\r\na radial arrangement of parts, like the starfish; etc. These types\r\nare distinct, but their representatives, instead of forming a linear\r\nseries, overlap so that the lowest forms of one of the higher groups\r\nare simpler in organization than the higher forms of a lower group.\r\nThis was very illuminating, and, being founded upon an analysis of\r\nstructure, was important. It was directly at variance with the idea of\r\nscale of being, and overthrew that doctrine.\r\n\r\nCuvier first expressed these views in a pamphlet published in 1795,\r\nand later in a better-known paper read before the French Academy in\r\n1812, but for the full development of his type-theory we look to his\r\ngreat volume on the animal kingdom published in 1816. The central idea\r\nof his arrangement is contained in the secondary title of his book,\r\n\"The Animal Kingdom Arranged According to its Organization\" (_Le Règne\r\nAnimal Distribué d'après son Organisation_, 1816). The expression\r\n\"arranged according to its organization\" embraces the feature in which\r\nthis analysis of animals differs from all previous attempts.\r\n\r\nCorrelation of Parts.--An important idea, first clearly expressed\r\nby Cuvier, was that of correlation of parts. The view that the\r\ndifferent parts of an animal are so correlated that a change in one,\r\nbrought about through changes in use, involves a change in another.\r\nFor illustration, the cleft hoof is always associated with certain\r\nforms of teeth and with the stomach of a ruminant. The sharp claws\r\nof flesh-eating animals are associated with sharp, cutting teeth for\r\ntearing the flesh of the victims, and with an alimentary tube adapted\r\nto the digestion of a fleshy diet. Further account of Cuvier is\r\nreserved for the chapter on the Rise of Comparative Anatomy, of which\r\nhe was the founder.\r\n\r\nVon Baer.--The next notable advance affecting natural history came\r\nthrough the work of Von Baer, who, in 1828, founded the science of\r\ndevelopment of animal forms. He arrived at substantially the same\r\nconclusions as Cuvier. Thus the system founded upon comparative anatomy\r\nby Cuvier came to have the support of Von Baer's studies in embryology.\r\n\r\nThe contributions of these men proved to be a turning-point in natural\r\nhistory, and subsequent progress in systematic botany and zoölogy\r\nresulted from the application of the methods of Cuvier and Von Baer,\r\nrather than from following that of Linnæus. His nomenclature remained\r\na permanent contribution of value, but the knowledge of the nature\r\nof living forms has been advanced chiefly by studies in comparative\r\nanatomy and embryology, and, also, in the application of experiments.\r\n\r\nThe most significant advances in reference to the classification of\r\nanimals was to come as a result of the acceptance of the doctrine\r\nof organic evolution, subsequent to 1859. Then the relationships\r\nbetween animals were made to depend upon community of descent, and a\r\ndistinction was drawn between superficial or apparent relationships\r\nand those deep-seated characteristics that depend upon close genetic\r\naffinities.\r\n\r\nAlterations by Von Siebold and Leuckart.--But, in the mean time,\r\nnaturalists were not long in discovering that the primary divisions\r\nestablished by Cuvier were not well balanced, and, indeed, that they\r\nwere not natural divisions of the animal kingdom. The group Radiata was\r\nthe least sharply defined, since Cuvier had included in it not only\r\nthose animals which exhibit a radial arrangement of parts, but also\r\nunicellular organisms that were asymmetrical, and some of the worms\r\nthat showed bilateral symmetry. Accordingly, Karl Th. von Siebold, in\r\n1845, separated these animals and redistributed them. For the simplest\r\nunicellular animals he adopted the name Protozoa, which they still\r\nretain, and the truly radiated forms, as starfish, sea-urchins, hydroid\r\npolyps, coral animals, etc., were united in the group Zoöphyta. Von\r\nSiebold also changed Cuvier's branch, Articulata, separating those\r\nforms as crustacea, insects, spiders, and myriopods, which have jointed\r\nappendages, into a natural group called Arthropoda, and uniting the\r\nsegmented worms with those worms that Cuvier has included in the\r\nradiate group, into another branch called Vermes. This separation\r\nof the four original branches of Cuvier was a movement in the right\r\ndirection, and was destined to be carried still farther.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.--Karl Th. von Siebold, 1804-1885.]\r\n\r\nVon Siebold (Fig. 35) was an important man in the progress of zoölogy,\r\nespecially in reference to the comparative anatomy of the invertebrates.\r\n\r\nLeuckart (Fig. 36), whose fame as a lecturer and teacher attracted\r\nmany young men to the University of Leipsic, is another conspicuous\r\npersonality in zoölogical progress.\r\n\r\nThis distinguished zoölogist, following the lead of Von Siebold, made\r\nfurther modifications. He split Von Siebold's group of Zoöphytes into\r\ntwo distinct kinds of radiated animals; the star-fishes, sea-urchins,\r\nsea-cucumbers, etc., having a spiny skin, he designated Echinoderma;\r\nthe jelly-fishes, polyps, coral animals, etc., not possessing a true\r\nbody cavity, were also united into a natural group, for which he\r\nproposed the name Coelenterata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.--Rudolph Leuckart, 1823-1898.]\r\n\r\nFrom all these changes there resulted the seven primary\r\ndivisions--branches, subkingdoms, or phyla--which, with small\r\nmodifications, are still in use. These are Protozoa, Coelenterata,\r\nEchinoderma, Vermes, Arthropoda, Mollusca, Vertebrata. These seven\r\nphyla are not entirely satisfactory, and there is being carried on\r\na redistribution of forms, as in the case of the brachiopods, the\r\nsponges, the tunicates, etc. While all this makes toward progress, the\r\nchanges are of more narrow compass than those alterations due to Von\r\nSiebold and Leuckart.\r\n\r\nSummary.--In reviewing the rise of scientific natural history, we\r\nobserve a steady development from the time of the _Physiologus_, first\r\nthrough a return to Aristotle, and through gradual additions to his\r\nobservations, notably by Gesner, and then the striking improvements\r\ndue to Ray and Linnæus. We may speak of the latter two as the founders\r\nof systematic botany and zoölogy. But the system left by Linnæus was\r\nartificial, and the greatest obvious need was to convert it into a\r\nnatural system founded upon a knowledge of the structure and the\r\ndevelopment of living organisms. This was begun by Cuvier and Von Baer,\r\nand was continued especially by Von Siebold and Leuckart. To this has\r\nbeen added the study of habits, breeding, and adaptations of organisms,\r\na study which has given to natural history much greater importance than\r\nif it stood merely for the systematic classification of animals and\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nTabular View of Classifications.--A table showing the primary groups of\r\nLinnæus, Cuvier, Von Siebold, and Leuckart will be helpful in picturing\r\nto the mind the modifications made in the classification of animals.\r\nSuch a table is given on the following page.\r\n\r\nL. Agassiz, in his famous essay on Classification, reviews in the most\r\nscholarly way the various systems of classification. One peculiar\r\nfeature of Agassiz's philosophy was his adherence to the dogma of\r\nthe fixity of species. The same year that his essay referred to was\r\npublished (1859) appeared Darwin's _Origin of Species_. Agassiz,\r\nhowever, was never able to accept the idea, of the transformations of\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n   Linnæus          Cuvier               Von Siebold        Leuckart\r\n\r\n  Mammalia          Vertebrata           Vertebrata         Vertebrata\r\n                    (Embracing five      (Embracing five    (Five classes.)\r\n  Aves              classes: Mammalia,   classes.)\r\n                    Aves, Reptilia,\r\n  Amphibia          Batrachia, Pisces.)\r\n\r\n  Pisces\r\n\r\n  Insecta           Mollusca             Mollusca           Mollusca\r\n  (Including\r\n  Crustacea,                             {Arthropoda\r\n  etc.)             Articulata           {Vermes            Arthropoda\r\n\r\n  Vermes                                                    Vermes\r\n                                         {Zoöphyta          {Echinoderma\r\n (Including         Radiata                                 {Coelenterata\r\n  Mollusca\r\n  and all                                {Protozoa          Protozoa\r\n lower forms.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps in Biological Progress from Linnæus to Darwin\r\n\r\nThe period from Linnæus to Darwin is one full of important advances\r\nfor biology in general. We have considered in this chapter only those\r\nfeatures that related to changes in the system of classification, but\r\nin the mean time the morphological and the physiological sides of\r\nbiology were being advanced not only by an accumulation of facts, but\r\nby their better analysis. It is an interesting fact that, although\r\nduring this period the details of the subject were greatly multiplied,\r\nprogress was relatively straightforward and by a series of steps that\r\ncan be clearly indicated.\r\n\r\nIt will be of advantage before the subject is taken up in its parts to\r\ngive a brief forecast in which the steps of progress can be represented\r\nin outline without the confusion arising from the consideration of\r\ndetails. Geddes, in 1898, pointed out the steps in progress, and the\r\naccount that follows is based upon his lucid analysis.\r\n\r\nThe Organism.--In the time of Linnæus the attention of naturalists\r\nwas mainly given to the organism as a whole. Plants and animals were\r\nconsidered from the standpoint of the organism--the external features\r\nwere largely dealt with, the habitat, the color, and the general\r\nappearance--features which characterize the organism as a whole.\r\nLinnæus and Jussieu represent this phase of the work, and Buffon the\r\nhigher type of it. Modern studies in this line are like addition to the\r\n_Systema Naturæ_.\r\n\r\nOrgans.--The first distinct advance came in investigating animals and\r\nplants according to their structure. Instead of the complete organism,\r\nthe organs of which it is composed became the chief subject of\r\nanalysis. The organism was dissected, the organs were examined broadly,\r\nand those of one kind of animal and plant compared with another. This\r\nkind of comparative study centered in Cuvier, who, in the early part of\r\nthe nineteenth century, founded the science of comparative anatomy of\r\nanimals, and in Hofmeister, who examined the structure of plants on a\r\nbasis of broad comparison.\r\n\r\nTissues.--Bichat, the famous contemporary of Cuvier, essayed a deeper\r\nlevel of analysis in directing attention to the tissues that are\r\ncombined to make up the organs. He distinguished twenty-one kinds of\r\ntissues by combinations of which the organs are composed. This step\r\nlaid the foundation for the science of histology, or minute anatomy.\r\nBichat called it general anatomy (_Anatomie Générale_, 1801).\r\n\r\nCells.--Before long it was shown that tissues are not the real units of\r\nstructure, but that they are composed of microscopic elements called\r\ncells. This level of analysis was not reached until magnifying-lenses\r\nwere greatly improved--it was a product of a closer scrutiny of nature\r\nwith improved instruments. The foundation of the work, especially for\r\nplants, had been laid by Leeuwenhoek, Malpighi, and Grew. But when the\r\nbroad generalization, that all the tissues of animals and plants are\r\ncomposed of cells, was given to the world by Schleiden and Schwann, in\r\n1838-39, the entire organization of living forms took on a new aspect.\r\nThis was progress in understanding the morphology of animals and plants.\r\n\r\nProtoplasm.--With improved microscopes and attention directed to cells,\r\nit was not long before the discovery was made that the cells as units\r\nof structure contain protoplasm. That this substance is similar in\r\nplants and animals and is the seat of all vital activity was determined\r\nchiefly by the researches of Max Schultze, published in 1861. Thus\r\nstep by step, from 1758, the date of the tenth edition of the _Systema\r\nNaturæ_, to 1861, there was a progress on the morphological side,\r\npassing from the organism as a whole to organs, to tissues, to cells,\r\nand finally to protoplasm, the study of which in all its phases is the\r\nchief pursuit of biologists.\r\n\r\nThe physiological side had a parallel development. In the period of\r\nLinnæus, the physiology of the organism was investigated by Haller and\r\nhis school; following him the physiology of organs and tissues was\r\nadvanced by J. Müller, Bichat, and others. Later, Virchow investigated\r\nthe physiology of cells, and Claude Bernard the chemical activities of\r\nprotoplasm.\r\n\r\nThis set forth in outline will be amplified in the following chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nCUVIER AND THE RISE OF COMPARATIVE ANATOMY\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter observers like Linnæus and his followers had attained a knowledge\r\nof the externals, it was natural that men should turn their attention\r\nto the organization or internal structure of living beings, and\r\nwhen the latter kind of investigation became broadly comparative,\r\nit blossomed into comparative anatomy. The materials out of which\r\nthe science of comparative anatomy was constructed had been long\r\naccumulating before the advent of Cuvier, but the mass of details had\r\nnot been organized into a compact science.\r\n\r\nAs indicated in previous chapters, there had been an increasing number\r\nof studies upon the structure of organisms, both plant and animal,\r\nand there had resulted some noteworthy monographs. All this work,\r\nhowever, was mainly descriptive, and not comparative. Now and then, the\r\ncomparing tendency had been shown in isolated writings such as those of\r\nHarvey, Malpighi, and others. As early as 1555, Belon had compared the\r\nskeleton of the bird with that of the human body \"in the same posture\r\nand as nearly as possible bone for bone\"; but this was merely a faint\r\nforeshadowing of what was to be done later in comparing the systems of\r\nthe more important organs.\r\n\r\nWe must keep in mind that the study of anatomy embraces not merely the\r\nbony framework of animals, but also the muscles, the nervous system,\r\nthe sense organs, and all the other structures of both animals and\r\nplants. In the rise of comparative anatomy there gradually emerged\r\nnaturalists who compared the structure of the higher animals with that\r\nof the simpler ones. These comparisons brought out so many resemblances\r\nand so many remarkable facts that anatomy, which seems at first a dry\r\nsubject, became endued with great interest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.--Severinus, 1580-1656.]\r\n\r\nSeverinus.--The first book expressly devoted to comparative anatomy\r\nwas that of Severinus (1580-1656), designated _Zootomia Democritæ_.\r\nThe title was derived from the Roman naturalist Democritæus, and the\r\ndate of its publication, 1645, places the treatise earlier than the\r\nworks of Malpighi, Leeuwenhoek, and Swammerdam. The book is illustrated\r\nby numerous coarse woodcuts, showing the internal organs of fishes,\r\nbirds, and some mammals. There are also a few illustrations of stages\r\nin the development of these animals. The comparisons were superficial\r\nand incidental; nevertheless, as the first attempt, after the revival\r\nof anatomy, to make the subject comparative, it has some especial\r\ninterest. Severinus (Fig. 37) should be recognized as beginning the\r\nline of comparative anatomists which led up to Cuvier.\r\n\r\nForerunners of Cuvier.--Anatomical studies began to take on broad\r\nfeatures with the work of Camper, John Hunter, and Vicq d'Azyr. These\r\nthree men paved the way for Cuvier, but it must be said of the two\r\nformer that their comparisons were limited and unsystematic.\r\n\r\nCamper, whose portrait is shown in Fig. 38, was born in Leyden, in\r\n1722. He was a versatile man, having a taste for drawing, painting,\r\nand sculpture, as well as for scientific studies. He received his\r\nscientific training under Boerhaave and other eminent men in Leyden,\r\nand became a professor and, later, rector in the University of\r\nGroningen. Possessing an ample fortune, and also having married a\r\nrich wife, he was in position to follow his own tastes. He travelled\r\nextensively and gathered a large collection of skeletons. He showed\r\nconsiderable talent as an anatomist, and he made several discoveries,\r\nwhich, however, he did not develop, but left to others. Perhaps the\r\npossession of riches was one of his limitations; at any rate, he lacked\r\nfixity of purpose.\r\n\r\nAmong his discoveries may be mentioned the semicircular canals in the\r\near of fishes, the fact that the bones of flying birds are permeated\r\nby air, the determination of some fossil bones, with the suggestion\r\nthat they belonged to extinct forms. The latter point is of interest,\r\nas antedating the conclusions of Cuvier regarding the nature of fossil\r\nbones. Camper also made observations upon the facial angle as an\r\nindex of intelligence in the different races of mankind, and in lower\r\nanimals. He studied the anatomy of the elephant, the whale, the orang,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.--Camper, 1722-1789.]\r\n\r\nJohn Hunter (1728-1793), the gifted Scotchman whose museum in London\r\nhas been so justly celebrated, was a man of extraordinary originality,\r\nwho read few books but went directly to nature for his facts; and,\r\nalthough he made errors from which he would have been saved by a wider\r\nacquaintance with the writings of naturalists, his neglect of reading\r\nleft his mind unprejudiced by the views of others. He was a wild,\r\nunruly spirit, who would not be forced into the conventional mold as\r\nregards either education or manners. His older brother, William, a\r\nman of more elegance and refinement, who well understood the value\r\nof polish in reference to worldly success, tried to improve John by\r\narranging for him to go to the University of Oxford, but John rebelled\r\nand would not have the classical education of the university, nor would\r\nhe take on the refinements of taste and manner of which his brother was\r\na good example. \"Why,\" the doughty John is reported to have said, \"they\r\nwanted to make me study Greek! They tried to make an old woman of me!\"\r\nHowever much lack of appreciation this attitude indicated, it shows\r\nalso the Philistine independence of his spirit. This independence of\r\nmind is one of his striking characteristics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.--John Hunter, 1728-1793.]\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to dwell upon the unfortunate controversy that\r\narose between these two illustrious brothers regarding scientific\r\ndiscoveries claimed by each. The position of both is secure in the\r\nhistorical development of medicine and surgery. Although the work of\r\nJohn Hunter was largely medical and surgical, he also made extensive\r\nstudies on the comparative anatomy of animals, and has a place as one\r\nof the most conspicuous predecessors of Cuvier. He was very energetic\r\nboth in making discoveries and in adding to his great museum.\r\n\r\nThe original collections made by Hunter are still open to inspection\r\nin the rooms of the Royal College of Surgeons, London. It was his\r\nobject to preserve specimens to illustrate the phenomena of life in all\r\norganisms, whether in health or disease, and the extent of his museum\r\nmay be divined from the circumstance that he expended upon it about\r\nthree hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars. Although he described\r\nand compared many types of animals, it was as much in bringing this\r\ncollection together and leaving it to posterity that he advanced\r\ncomparative anatomy as in what he wrote. After his death the House of\r\nCommons purchased his museum for fifteen thousand pounds, and placed\r\nit under the care of the corporation of Surgeons. Hunter's portrait is\r\nshown in Fig. 39.\r\n\r\nVicq d'Azyr (Fig. 40), more than any other man, holds the chief rank\r\nas a comparative anatomist before the advent of Cuvier into the same\r\nfield. He was born in 1748, the son of a physician, and went to Paris\r\nat the age of seventeen to study medicine, remaining in the metropolis\r\nto the time of his death in 1794. He was celebrated as a physician,\r\nbecame permanent secretary of the newly founded Academy of Medicine,\r\nconsulting physician to the queen, and occupied other positions of\r\ntrust and responsibility. He married the niece of Daubenton, and,\r\nlargely through his influence, was advanced to social place and\r\nrecognition. On the death of Buffon, in 1788, he took the seat of that\r\ndistinguished naturalist as a member of the French Academy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.--Vicq d'Azyr, 1748-1794.]\r\n\r\nHe made extensive studies upon the organization particularly of\r\nbirds and quadrupeds, making comparisons between their structure,\r\nand bringing out new points that were superior to anything yet\r\npublished. His comparisons of the limbs of man and animals, showing\r\na correspondence between the flexor and extensor muscles of the legs\r\nand arms, were made with great exactness, and they served to mark the\r\nbeginning of a new kind of precise comparison. These were not merely\r\nfanciful comparisons, but exact ones--part for part; and his general\r\nconsiderations based upon these comparisons were of a brilliant\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nAs Huxley has said, \"he may be considered as the founder of the modern\r\nscience of anatomy.\" His work on the structure of the brain was the\r\nmost exact which had appeared up to that time, and in his studies on\r\nthe brain he entered into broad comparisons as he had done in the study\r\nof the other parts of the animal organization.\r\n\r\nHe died at the age of forty-six, without being able to complete a\r\nlarge work on human anatomy, illustrated with colored figures. This\r\nwork had been announced and entered upon, but only that part relating\r\nto the brain had appeared at the time of his death. Besides drawings\r\nof the exterior of the brain, he made sections; but he was not able\r\nto determine with any particular degree of accuracy the course of\r\nfiber tracks in the brain. This was left for other workers. He added\r\nmany new facts to those of his predecessors, and by introducing exact\r\ncomparisons in anatomy he opened the field for Cuvier.\r\n\r\nCuvier.--When Cuvier, near the close of the eighteenth century,\r\ncommitted himself definitely to the progress of natural science, he\r\nfound vast accumulations of separate monographs to build upon, but he\r\nundertook to dissect representatives of all the groups of animals, and\r\nto found his comparative anatomy on personal observations. The work of\r\nVicq d'Azyr marked the highest level of attainment, and afforded a good\r\nmodel of what comparisons should be; but Cuvier had even larger ideas\r\nin reference to the scope of comparative anatomy than had his great\r\npredecessor.\r\n\r\nThe particular feature of Cuvier's service was that in his\r\ninvestigations he covered the whole field of animal organization\r\nfrom the lowest to the highest, and uniting his results with what\r\nhad already been accomplished, he established comparative anatomy on\r\nbroad lines as an independent branch of natural science. Almost at the\r\noutset he conceived the idea of making a comprehensive study of the\r\nstructure of the animal kingdom. It was fortunate that he began his\r\ninvestigations with thorough work upon the invertebrated animals; for\r\nfrom this view-point there was gradually unfolded to his great mind\r\nthe plan of organization of the entire series of animals. Not only is\r\na knowledge of the structure of the simplest animals an essential in\r\nunderstanding that of the more modified ones, but the more delicate\r\nwork required in dissecting them gives invaluable training for\r\nanatomizing those of more complex construction. The value attached\r\nto this part of his training by Cuvier is illustrated by the advice\r\nthat he gave to a young medical student who brought to his attention\r\na supposed discovery in anatomy. \"Are you an entomologist?\" inquired\r\nCuvier. \"No,\" said the young man. \"Then,\" replied Cuvier, \"go first and\r\nanatomize an insect, and return to me; and if you still believe that\r\nyour observations are discoveries I will then believe you.\"\r\n\r\nBirth and Early Education.--Cuvier was born in 1769, at Montbéliard, a\r\nvillage at that time belonging to Württemberg, but now a part of the\r\nFrench Jura. His father was a retired military officer of the Swiss\r\narmy, and the family, being Protestants, had moved to Montbéliard\r\nfor freedom from religious persecution. Cuvier was christened\r\nLéopold-Christian-Frédéric-Dagobert Cuvier, but early in youth took the\r\nname of Georges at the wish of his mother, who had lost an infant son\r\nby that name.\r\n\r\nHe gave an early promise of intellectual leadership, and his mother,\r\nalthough not well educated, took the greatest pains in seeing that he\r\nformed habits of industry and continuous work, hearing him recite his\r\nlessons in Latin and other branches, although she did not possess a\r\nknowledge of Latin. He early showed a leaning toward natural history;\r\nhaving access to the works of Gesner and Buffon, he profited by reading\r\nthese two writers. So great was his interest that he colored the\r\nplates in Buffon's _Natural History_ from descriptions in the text.\r\n\r\nIt was at first contemplated by his family that he should prepare for\r\ntheology, but failing, through the unfairness of one of his teachers,\r\nto get an appointment to the theological seminary, his education was\r\ncontinued in other directions. He was befriended by the sister of\r\nthe Duke of Württemberg, who sent him as a pensioner to the famous\r\nCarolinian academy at Stuttgart. There he showed great application,\r\nand with the wonderful memory with which he was endowed, he took high\r\nrank as a student. Here he met Kielmeyer, a young instructor only four\r\nyears older than himself, who shared his taste for natural history\r\nand, besides this, introduced him to anatomy. In after-years Cuvier\r\nacknowledged the assistance of Kielmeyer in determining his future work\r\nand in teaching him to dissect.\r\n\r\nLife at the Seashore.--In 1788 the resources of his family, which had\r\nalways been slender, became further reduced by the inability of the\r\ngovernment to pay his father's retiring stipend. As the way did not\r\nopen for employment in other directions, young Cuvier took the post\r\nof instructor of the only son in the family of Count d'Héricy, and\r\nwent with the family to the sea-coast in Normandy, near Caen. For\r\nsix years (1788-1794) he lived in this noble family, with much time\r\nat his disposal. For Cuvier this period, from the age of nineteen to\r\ntwenty-five, was one of constant research and reflection.\r\n\r\nWhile Paris was disrupted by the reign of terror, Cuvier, who, although\r\nof French descent, regarded himself as a German, was quietly carrying\r\non his researches into the structure of the life at the seaside.\r\nThese years of diligent study and freedom from distractions fixed his\r\ndestiny. Here at the sea-coast, without the assistance of books and the\r\nstimulus of intercourse with other naturalists, he was drawn directly\r\nto nature, and through his great industry he became an independent\r\nobserver. Here he laid the foundation of his extensive knowledge\r\nof comparative anatomy, and from this quiet spot he sent forth his\r\nearliest scientific writings, which served to carry his name to Paris,\r\nthe great center of scientific research in France.\r\n\r\nGoes to Paris.--His removal from these provincial surroundings was\r\nmainly owing to the warm support of Tessier, who was spending the time\r\nof the reign of terror in retirement in an adjacent village, under\r\nan assumed name. He and Cuvier met in a scientific society, where\r\nthe identity of Tessier was discovered by Cuvier on account of his\r\nease of speech and his great familiarity with the topics discussed.\r\nA friendship sprung up between them, and Tessier addressed some of\r\nhis scientific friends in Paris in the interest of Cuvier. By this\r\npowerful introduction, and also through the intervention of Geoffroy\r\nSaint-Hilaire, he came to Paris in 1795 and was welcomed into the group\r\nof working naturalists at the Jardin des Plantes, little dreaming at\r\nthe time that he should be the leader of the group of men gathered\r\naround this scientific institution. He was modest, and so uncertain of\r\nhis future that for a year he held to his post of instructor, bringing\r\nhis young charge with him to Paris.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the doubt which he entertained regarding his abilities,\r\nhis career proved successful from the beginning. In Paris he entered\r\nupon a brilliant career, which was a succession of triumphs. His\r\nunmistakable talent, combined with industry and unusual opportunities,\r\nbrought him rapidly to the front. The large amount of material already\r\ncollected, and the stimulating companionship of other scientific\r\nworkers, afforded an environment in which he grew rapidly. He responded\r\nto the stimulus, and developed not only into a great naturalist, but\r\nexpanded into a finished gentleman of the world. Circumstances shaped\r\nthemselves so that he was called to occupy prominent offices under\r\nthe government, and he came ultimately to be the head of the group of\r\nscientific men into which he had been welcomed as a young man from the\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.--Cuvier as a Young Man, 1769-1832.]\r\n\r\nHis Physiognomy.--It is very interesting to note in his portraits the\r\nchange in his physiognomy accompanying his transformation from a young\r\nman of provincial appearance into an elegant personage. Fig. 41 shows\r\nhis portrait in the early days when he was less mindful of his personal\r\nappearance. It is the face of an eager, strong, young man, still\r\nretaining traces of his provincial life. His long, light-colored hair\r\nis unkempt, but does not hide the magnificent proportions of his head.\r\nFig. 42 shows the growing refinement of features which came with his\r\nadvancement, and the aristocratic look of supremacy which set upon his\r\ncountenance after his wide recognition passing by a gradation of steps\r\nfrom the position of head of the educational system, to that of baron\r\nand peer of France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.--Cuvier at the Zenith of His Power.]\r\n\r\nCuvier was a man of commanding power and colossal attainments; he was a\r\nfavorite of Napoleon Bonaparte, who elevated him to office and made him\r\ndirector of the higher educational institutions of the Empire. But to\r\nwhatever place of prominence he attained in the government, he never\r\nlost his love for natural science. With him this was an absorbing\r\npassion, and it may be said that he ranks higher as a zoölogist than as\r\na legislator.\r\n\r\nComprehensiveness of Mind.--Soon after his arrival in Paris he began\r\nto lecture upon comparative anatomy and to continue work in a most\r\ncomprehensive way upon the subjects which he had cultivated at Caen.\r\nHe saw everything on a large scale. This led to his making extensive\r\nstudies of whatever problems engaged his mind, and his studies were\r\ncombined in such a manner as to give a broad view of the subject.\r\n\r\nIndeed, comprehensiveness of mind seems to have been the characteristic\r\nwhich most impressed those who were acquainted with him. Flourens says\r\nof him: \"_Ce qui caractérise partout M. Cuvier, c'est l'esprit vaste._\"\r\nHis broad and comprehensive mind enabled him to map out on great lines\r\nthe subject of comparative anatomy. His breadth was at times his\r\nundoing, for it must be confessed that when the details of the subject\r\nare considered, he was often inaccurate. This was possibly owing to the\r\nconditions under which he worked; having his mind diverted into many\r\nother channels, never neglecting his state duties, it is reasonable to\r\nsuppose that he lacked the necessary time to prove his observations in\r\nanatomy, and we may in this way account for some of his inaccuracies.\r\n\r\nBesides being at fault in some of his comparative anatomy, he adhered\r\nto a number of ideas that served to retard the progress of science.\r\nHe was opposed to the ideas of his contemporary Lamarck, on the\r\nevolution of animals. He is remembered as the author of the dogma\r\nof catastrophism in geology. He adhered to the old notion of the\r\npre-formation of the embryo, and also to the theory of the spontaneous\r\norigin of life.\r\n\r\nFounds Comparative Anatomy.--Regardless of this qualification, he was a\r\ngreat and distinguished student, and founded comparative anatomy. From\r\n1801 to 1805 appeared his _Leçons d' Anatomie Comparée_, a systematic\r\ntreatise on the comparative anatomy of animals, embracing both the\r\ninvertebrates and the vertebrates. In 1812 was published his great\r\nwork on the fossil bones about Paris, an achievement which founded the\r\nscience of vertebrate palæontology. His extensive examination of the\r\nstructure of fishes also added to his already great reputation. His\r\nbook on the animal kingdom (_Le Règne Animal distribué d'après son\r\nOrganisation_, 1816), in which he expounded his type-theory, has been\r\nconsidered in a previous chapter.\r\n\r\nHe was also deeply interested in the historical development of science,\r\nand his volumes on the rise of the natural sciences give us almost the\r\nbest historical estimate of the progress of science that we have at the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nHis Domestic Life.--Mrs. Lee, in a chatty account of Cuvier, shows one\r\nof his methods of work. He had the faculty of making others assist\r\nhim in various ways. Not only members of his family, but also guests\r\nin his household were pressed into service. They were invited to\r\nexamine different editions of works and to indicate the differences\r\nin the plates and in the text. This practice resulted in saving much\r\ntime for Cuvier, since in the preparation of his historical lectures\r\nhe undertook to examine all the original sources of the history with\r\nwhich he was engaged. In his lectures he summarized facts relating to\r\ndifferent editions of books, etc.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lee also gives a picture of his family life, which was, to all\r\naccounts, very beautiful. He was devoted to his wife and children, and\r\nin the midst of exacting cares he found time to bind his family in love\r\nand devotion. Cuvier was called upon to suffer poignant grief in the\r\nloss of his children, and his direct family was not continued. He was\r\nespecially broken by the death of his daughter who had grown to young\r\nwomanhood and was about to be married.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of a sincere admirer, Mrs. Lee writes of his\r\ngenerosity and nobility of temperament, declaring that his career\r\ndemonstrated that his mind was great and free from both envy and\r\nsmallness.\r\n\r\nSome Shortcomings.--Nevertheless, there are certain things in the\r\nlife of Cuvier that we wish might not have been. His break with his\r\nold friends Lamarck and Saint-Hilaire seems to show a domination of\r\nqualities that were not generous and kindly; those observations of\r\nLamarck showing a much profounder insight than any of which he himself\r\nwas the author were laughed to scorn. His famous controversy with\r\nSaint-Hilaire marks a historical moment that will be dealt with in the\r\nchapter on Evolution.\r\n\r\nGeorge Bancroft, the American historian, met him during a visit\r\nto Paris in 1827. He speaks of his magnificent eyes and his fine\r\nappearance, but on the whole Cuvier seems to have impressed Bancroft as\r\na disagreeable man.\r\n\r\nSome of his shortcomings that served to retard the progress of\r\nscience have been mentioned. Still, with all his faults, he dominated\r\nzoölogical science at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and so\r\npowerful was his influence and so undisputed was his authority among\r\nthe French people that the rising young men in natural science sided\r\nwith Cuvier even when he was wrong. It is a noteworthy fact that\r\nFrance, under the influence of the traditions of Cuvier, was the last\r\ncountry slowly and reluctantly to harbor as true the ideas regarding\r\nthe evolution of animal life.\r\n\r\n\r\nCuvier's Successors\r\n\r\nWhile Cuvier's theoretical conclusions exercised a retarding influence\r\nupon the progress of biology, his practical studies more than\r\ncompensated for this. It has been pointed out how his type-theory led\r\nto the reform of the Linnæan system, but, besides this, the stimulus\r\nwhich his investigations gave to studies in comparative anatomy was\r\neven of more beneficent influence. As time passed the importance of\r\ncomparative anatomy as one division of biological science impressed\r\nitself more and more upon naturalists. A large number of investigators\r\nin France, England, and Germany entered the field and took up the work\r\nwhere Cuvier had left it. The more notable of these successors of\r\nCuvier should come under consideration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.--H. Milne-Edwards, 1800-1885.]\r\n\r\nHis intellectual heirs in France were Milne-Edwards and Lacaze-Duthiers.\r\n\r\nMilne-Edwards.--H. Milne-Edwards (1800-1885) was a man of great\r\nindustry and fine attainments; prominent alike in comparative anatomy,\r\ncomparative physiology, and general zoölogy, professor for many years\r\nat the Sorbonne in Paris. In 1827 he introduced into biology the\r\nfruitful idea of the division of physiological labor. He completed and\r\npublished excellent researches upon the structure and development of\r\nmany animals, notably crustacea, corals, etc. His work on comparative\r\nanatomy took the form of explanations of the activities of animals,\r\nor comparative physiology. His comprehensive treatise _Leçons sur la\r\nPhysiologie et l'Anatomie Comparée_, in fourteen volumes, 1857-1881,\r\nis a mine of information regarding comparative anatomy as well as the\r\nphysiology of organisms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.--Lacaze-Duthiers, 1821-1901.]\r\n\r\nLacaze-Duthiers.--Henri de Lacaze-Duthiers (1821-1901), the man\r\nof comprehensive mind, stimulating as an instructor of young men,\r\ninspiring other workers, and producing a large amount of original\r\nresearch on his own account, director of the Seaside Stations at\r\nRoscoff and Banyuls, the founder of a noteworthy periodical of\r\nexperimental zoölogy--this great man, whose portrait is shown in Fig.\r\n44, was one of the leading comparative anatomists in France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.--Lorenzo Oken, 1779-1851.]\r\n\r\nR. Owen.--In England Richard Owen (1804-1892) carried on the influence\r\nof Cuvier. At the age of twenty-seven he went to Paris and renewed\r\nacquaintance with the great Cuvier, whom he had met the previous year\r\nin England. He spent some time at the Jardin des Plantes examining\r\nthe extensive collections in the museum. Although the idea was\r\nrepudiated by Owen and some of his friends, it is not unlikely that\r\nthe collections of fossil animals and the researches upon them which\r\nengaged Cuvier at that time had great influence upon the subsequent\r\nstudies of Owen. Although he never studied under Cuvier, in a sense\r\nhe may be regarded as his disciple. Owen introduced into anatomy the\r\nimportant conceptions of analogy and homology, the former being a\r\nlikeness based upon the use to which organs are put, as the wing of a\r\nbutterfly and the wing of a bat; while homology is a true relationship\r\nfounded on likeness in structure and development, as the wing of a\r\nbat and the foreleg of a dog. Analogy is a superficial, and often a\r\ndeceiving relationship; homology is a true genetic relationship. It\r\nis obvious that this distinction is of great importance in comparing\r\nthe different parts of animals. He made a large number of independent\r\ndiscoveries, and published a monumental work on the comparative\r\nanatomy of vertebrates (1866-68). In much of his thought he was\r\nsingular, and many of his general conclusions have not stood the\r\ntest of time. He undertook to establish the idea of an archtype in\r\nvertebrate anatomy. He clung to the vertebral theory of the skull long\r\nafter Huxley had shown such a theory to be untenable. The idea that the\r\nskull is made up of modified vertebrae was propounded by Goethe and\r\nOken. In the hands of Oken it became one of the anatomical conclusions\r\nof the school of _Naturphilosophie_. This school of transcendental\r\nphilosophy was founded by Schelling, and Oken (Fig. 45) was one\r\nof its typical representatives. The vertebral theory of the skull\r\nwas, therefore, not original with Owen, but he adopted it, greatly\r\nelaborated it, and clung to it blindly long after the foundations upon\r\nwhich it rested were removed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.--Richard Owen, 1804-1892.]\r\n\r\nRichard Owen (Fig. 46) was succeeded by Huxley (1825-1895), whose\r\nexactness of observation and rare judgment as to the main facts of\r\ncomparative anatomy mark him as one of the leaders in this field of\r\nresearch. The influence of Huxley as a popular exponent of science is\r\ndealt with in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nMeckel.--Just as Cuvier stands at the beginning of the school of\r\ncomparative anatomy in France, so does J. Fr. Meckel in Germany.\r\nMeckel (1781-1833) was a man of rare talent, descended from a family\r\nof distinguished anatomists. From 1804 to 1806 he studied in Paris\r\nunder Cuvier, and when he came to leave the French capital to become\r\nprofessor of anatomy at Halle, he carried into Germany the teachings\r\nand methods of his master. He was a strong force in the university,\r\nattracting students to his department by his excellent lectures and his\r\nability to arouse enthusiasm. Some of these students were stimulated to\r\nundertake researches in anatomy, and there came from his laboratory a\r\nnumber of investigations that were published in a periodical which he\r\nfounded. Meckel himself produced many scientific papers and works on\r\ncomparative anatomy, which assisted materially in the advancement of\r\nthat science. His portrait, which is rare, is shown in Fig. 47.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.--J. Fr. Meckel, 1781-1833.]\r\n\r\nRathke.--Martin Henry Rathke (1793-1860) greatly advanced the science\r\nof comparative anatomy by insisting upon the importance of elucidating\r\nanatomy with researches in development. This is such an important\r\nconsideration that his influence upon the progress of comparative\r\nanatomy can not be overlooked. After being a professor in Dorpat, he\r\ncame, in 1835, to occupy the position of professor of anatomy and\r\nzoölogy at Königsberg, which had been vacated by Von Baer on the\r\nremoval of the latter to St. Petersburg. His writings are composed with\r\ngreat intelligence, and his facts are carefully coördinated. Rathke\r\nbelonged to the good old school of German writers whose researches were\r\nprofound and extensive, and whose expression was clear, being based\r\nupon matured thought. His papers on the aortic arches and the Wolffian\r\nbody are those most commonly referred to at the present time.\r\n\r\nMüller.--Johannes Müller (1801-1858), that phenomenal man, besides\r\nsecuring recognition as the greatest physiologist of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, also gave attention to comparative anatomy, and earned the\r\ntitle of the greatest morphologist of his time. His researches were\r\nso accurate, so complete, so discerning, that his influence upon\r\nthe development of comparative anatomy was profound. Although he is\r\naccorded, in history, the double distinction of being a great anatomist\r\nand a great physiologist, his teaching tended to physiology; and most\r\nof his distinguished students were physiologists of the broadest type,\r\nuniting comparative anatomy with their researches upon functional\r\nactivities. (For Müller's portrait see p. 187.)\r\n\r\nGegenbaur.--In Karl Gegenbaur (1826-1903) scientific anatomy reached\r\nits highest expression. His work was characterized by broad and\r\nmasterly analysis of the facts of structure, to which were added the\r\nideas derived from the study of the development of organs. He was\r\nendowed with an intensely keen insight, an insight which enabled him\r\nto separate from the vast mass of facts the important and essential\r\nfeatures, so that they yielded results of great interest and of lasting\r\nimportance. This gifted anatomist attracted many young men from the\r\nUnited States and from other countries to pursue under his direction\r\nthe study of comparative anatomy. He died in Heidelberg in 1903, where\r\nhe had been for many years professor of anatomy in the university.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.--Karl Gegenbaur, 1826-1903.]\r\n\r\nIn the group of living German anatomists the names of Fürbringer,\r\nWaldeyer, and Wiedersheim can not go unmentioned.\r\n\r\nE.D. Cope.--In America the greatest comparative anatomist was E.D. Cope\r\n(1840-1897), a man of the highest order of attainment, who dealt with\r\nthe comparative anatomy not only of living forms, but of fossil life,\r\nand made contributions of a permanent character to this great science;\r\na man whose title to distinction in the field of comparative anatomy\r\nwill become clearer to later students with the passage of time. For\r\nCope's portrait see p. 336.\r\n\r\nOf the successors of Cuvier, we would designate Meckel, Owen,\r\nGegenbaur, and Cope as the greatest.\r\n\r\nComparative anatomy is a very rich subject, and when elucidated by\r\nembryology, is one of the firm foundations of biology. If we regard\r\nanatomy as a science of statics, we recognize that it should be\r\nunited with physiology, which represents the dynamical side of life.\r\nComparative anatomy and comparative physiology should go hand in\r\nhand in the attempt to interpret living forms. Advances in these\r\ntwo subjects embrace nearly all our knowledge of living organisms.\r\nIt is a cause for congratulation that comparative anatomy has now\r\nbecome experimental, and that gratifying progress is being made along\r\nthe line of research designated as experimental morphology. Already\r\nvaluable results have been attained in this field, and the outlook of\r\nexperimental morphology is most promising.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nBICHAT AND THE BIRTH OF HISTOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must recognize Bichat as one of the foremost men in biological\r\nhistory, although his name is not well known to the general public,\r\nnor constantly referred to by biologists as that of one of the chief\r\nluminaries of their science. In him was combined extraordinary talent\r\nwith powers of intense and prolonged application; a combination which\r\nhas always produced notable results in the world. He died at the age\r\nof thirty-one, but, within a productive period of not more than seven\r\nyears, he made observations and published work that created an epoch\r\nand made a lasting impression on biological history.\r\n\r\nHis researches supplemented those of Cuvier, and carried the analysis\r\nof animal organization to a deeper level. Cuvier laid the foundations\r\nof comparative anatomy by dissecting and arranging in a comprehensive\r\nsystem the organs of animals, but Bichat went a step further and made a\r\nprofound study of the tissues that unite to make up the organs. As we\r\nhave already noted in a previous chapter, this was a step in reaching\r\nthe conception of the real organization of living beings.\r\n\r\nBuckle's Estimate of Bichat.--It is interesting to note the impression\r\nmade by Bichat upon one of the greatest students of the history of\r\ncivilization. Buckle says of him: \"Great, however, as is the name of\r\nCuvier, a greater still remains behind. I allude, of course, to Bichat,\r\nwhose reputation is steadily advancing as our knowledge advances; who,\r\nif we compare the shortness of his life with the reach and depth of\r\nhis views, must be pronounced the most profound thinker and consummate\r\nobserver by whom the organization of the animal frame has yet been\r\nstudied.\r\n\r\n\"We may except Aristotle, but between Aristotle and Bichat I find no\r\nmiddle man.\"\r\n\r\nWhether or not we agree fully with this panegyric of Buckle, we must,\r\nI think, place Bichat among the most illustrious men of biological\r\nhistory, as Vesalius, J. Müller, Von Baer, and Balfour.\r\n\r\nMarie François Xavier Bichat was born in 1771 at Thoirette, department\r\nof the Ain. His father, who was a physician, directed the early\r\neducation of his son and had the satisfaction of seeing him take kindly\r\nto intellectual pursuits. The young student was distinguished in Latin\r\nand mathematics, and showed early a fondness for natural history.\r\nHaving elected to follow the calling of his father, he went to Lyons to\r\nstudy medicine, and came under the instruction of Petit in surgery.\r\n\r\nBichat in Paris.--It was, on the whole, a fortunate circumstance\r\nfor Bichat that the turbulent events of the French Revolution drove\r\nhim from Lyons to Paris, where he could have the best training, the\r\ngreatest stimulus for his growth, and at the same time the widest field\r\nfor the exercise of his talents. We find him in Paris in 1793, studying\r\nunder the great surgeon Desault.\r\n\r\nHe attracted attention to himself in the class of this distinguished\r\nteacher and operator by an extemporaneous report on one of the\r\nlectures. It was the custom in Desault's classes to have the lectures\r\nof the professor reported upon before an assistant by some student\r\nespecially appointed for the purpose. On one occasion the student who\r\nhad been appointed to prepare and deliver the review was absent, and\r\nBichat, who was gifted with a powerful memory, volunteered without\r\nprevious notice to take his place. The lecture was a long and difficult\r\none on the fractures of the clavicle, but Bichat's abstract was so\r\nclear, forceful, and complete that its delivery in well-chosen language\r\nproduced a great sensation both upon the instructor and the students.\r\nThis notable performance served to bring him directly to the attention\r\nof Desault, who invited him to become his assistant and to live in\r\nhis family. The association of Bichat with the great surgeon was most\r\nhappy. Desault treated him as a son, and when he suddenly died in 1795,\r\nthe care of preparing his works for the printer was left to Bichat.\r\n\r\nThe fidelity with which Bichat executed this trust was characteristic\r\nof his noble nature. He laid aside his own personal interests, and his\r\nresearches in which he was already immersed, and by almost superhuman\r\nlabor completed the fourth volume of Desault's _Journal of Surgery_ and\r\nat the same time collected and published his scattered papers. To these\r\nhe added observations of his own, making alterations to bring the work\r\nup to the highest plane. Thus he paid the debt of gratitude which he\r\nfelt he owed to Desault for his friendship and assistance.\r\n\r\nIn 1797 he was appointed professor of anatomy, at the age of\r\ntwenty-six, and from then to the end of his life, in 1801, he continued\r\nin his career of remarkable industry.\r\n\r\nThe portrait of this very attractive man is shown in Fig. 49. His face\r\nshows strong intellectuality. He is described as of \"middling stature,\r\nwith an agreeable face lighted by piercing and expressive eyes.\" He was\r\nmuch beloved by his students and associates, being \"in all relations of\r\nlife most amiable, a stranger to envy or other hateful passions, modest\r\nin demeanor and lively in his manners, which were open and free.\"\r\n\r\nHis Phenomenal Industry.--His industry was phenomenal; besides doing\r\nthe work of a professor, he attended to a considerable practice, and\r\nduring a single winter he is said to have examined with care six\r\nhundred bodies in the pursuance of his researches upon pathological\r\nanatomy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.--Bichat, 1771-1801.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1800, when he was thirty years old, began to appear the\r\nresults of his matured researches. We speak of these as being matured,\r\nnot on account of his age or the great number of years he had labored\r\nupon them, but from the intensity and completeness with which he had\r\npursued his investigations, thus giving to his work a lasting quality.\r\n\r\nFirst came his treatise on the membranes (_Traité des Membranes_);\r\nfollowed quickly by his Physiological Researches into the Phenomena of\r\nLife and Death (_Recherches Physiologiques sur la Vie et la Mort_);\r\nthen appeared his General Anatomy (_Anatomie Générale_) in 1801, and\r\nhis treatise upon Descriptive Anatomy, upon which he was working at the\r\ntime of his death.\r\n\r\nHis death occurred in 1801, and was due partly to an accident. He\r\nslipped upon the stairs of the dissecting-room, and his fall was\r\nfollowed by gastric derangement, from which he died.\r\n\r\nResults of His Work.--The new science of the anatomy of the tissues\r\nwhich he founded is now known as histology, and the general anatomy,\r\nas he called it, has now become the study of minute anatomy of the\r\ntissues. Bichat studied the membranes or tissues very profoundly, but\r\nhe did not employ the microscope and make sketches of their cellular\r\nconstruction. The result of his work was to set the world studying the\r\nminute structure of the tissues, a consequence of which led to the\r\nmodern study of histology. Since this science was constructed directly\r\nupon his foundation, it is proper to recognize him as the founder of\r\nhistology.\r\n\r\nCarpenter says of him: \"Altogether Bichat left an impress upon the\r\nscience of life, the depth of which can scarcely be overrated; and this\r\nnot so much by the facts which he collected and generalized, as by\r\nthe method of inquiry which he developed, and by the systematic form\r\nwhich he gave to the study of general anatomy in its relations both to\r\nphysiology and pathology.\"\r\n\r\nBichat's More Notable Successors.--His influence extended far, and\r\nafter the establishment of the cell-theory took on a new phase.\r\nMicroscopic study of the tissues has now become a separate division\r\nof the science of anatomy, and engages the attention of a very large\r\nnumber of workers. While the men who built upon Bichat's foundation are\r\nnumerous, we shall select for especial mention only a few of the more\r\nnotable, as Schwann, Koelliker, Schultze, Virchow, Leydig, and Ramon y\r\nCajal, whose researches stand in the direct line of development of the\r\nideas promulgated by Bichat.\r\n\r\nSchwann.--Schwann's cell-theory was the result of close attention\r\nto the microscopic structure of the tissues of animals. It was an\r\nextension of the knowledge of the tissues which Bichat distinguished\r\nand so thoroughly investigated from other points of view. The\r\ncell-theory, which took rise in 1839, was itself epoch-making, and the\r\nscience of general anatomy was influenced by it as deeply as was the\r\nscience of embryology. The leading founder of this theory was Theodor\r\nSchwann, whose portrait is shown on page 245, where there is also a\r\nmore extended account of his labors in connection with the cell-theory.\r\nHad not the life of Bichat been cut off in his early manhood, he might\r\nwell have lived to see this great discovery added to his own.\r\n\r\nKoelliker.--Albrecht von Koelliker (1817-1905) was one of the greatest\r\nhistologists of the nineteenth century. He is a striking figure in\r\nthe development of biology in a general way, distinguished as an\r\nembryologist, as a histologist, and in other connections. During his\r\nlong life, from 1817 to 1905, he made an astounding number of additions\r\nto our knowledge of microscopic anatomy. In the early years of his\r\nscientific activity, \"he helped in establishing the cell-theory, he\r\ntraced the origin of tissues from the segmenting ovum through the\r\ndeveloping embryo, he demonstrated the continuity between nerve-fibers\r\nand nerve-cells of vertebrates (1845), ... and much more.\" He is\r\nmentioned further, in connection with the rise of embryology, in\r\nChapter X.\r\n\r\nThe strong features of this veteran of research are shown in the\r\nportrait, Fig. 50, which represents him at the age of seventy.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 he was called to the University of Würzburg, where he remained\r\nto the time of his death. From 1850 to 1900, scarcely a year passed\r\nwithout some important contribution from Von Koelliker extending the\r\nknowledge of histology. His famous text-book on the structure of the\r\ntissues (_Handbuch der Gewebelehre_) passed through six editions from\r\n1852 to 1893, the final edition of it being worked over and brought\r\nup to date by this extraordinary man after he had passed the age of\r\nseventy-five. By workers in biology this will be recognized as a\r\ncolossal task. In the second volume of the last edition of this work,\r\nwhich appeared in 1893, he went completely over the ground of the vast\r\naccumulation of information regarding the nervous system which an army\r\nof gifted and energetic workers had produced. This was all thoroughly\r\ndigested, and his histological work brought down to date.\r\n\r\nSchultze.--The fine observations of Max Schultze (1825-1874) may also\r\nbe grouped with those of the histologists. We shall have occasion to\r\nspeak of him more particularly in the chapter on Protoplasm. He did\r\nmemorable service for general biology in establishing the protoplasm\r\ndoctrine, but many of his scientific memoirs are in the line of normal\r\nhistology; as, those on the structure of the olfactory membrane, on the\r\nretina of the eye, the muscle elements, the nerves, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.--Von Koelliker, 1817-1905.]\r\n\r\nNormal Histology and Pathology.--But histology has two phases: the\r\ninvestigation of the tissues in health, which is called normal\r\nhistology; and the study of the tissues in disease and under abnormal\r\nconditions of development, which is designated pathological histology.\r\nThe latter division, on account of its importance to the medical man,\r\nhas been extensively cultivated, and the development of pathological\r\nstudy has greatly extended the knowledge of the tissues and has had its\r\ninfluence upon the progress of normal histology. Goodsir, in England,\r\nand Henle, in Germany, entered the field of pathological histology,\r\nboth doing work of historical importance. They were soon followed by\r\nVirchow, whose eminence as a man and a scientist has made his name\r\nfamiliar to people in general.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.--Rudolph Virchow, 1821-1903.]\r\n\r\nVirchow.--Rudolph Virchow (1821-1903), for many years a professor in\r\nthe University of Berlin, was a notable man in biological science and\r\nalso as a member of the German parliament. He assisted in molding the\r\ncell-theory into better form, and in 1858 published a work on _Cellular\r\nPathology_, which applied the cell-theory to diseased tissues. It is to\r\nbe remembered that Bichat was a medical man, intensely interested in\r\npathological, or diseased, tissues, and we see in Virchow the one who\r\nespecially extended Bichat's work on the side of abnormal histology.\r\nVirchow's name is associated also with the beginning of the idea of\r\ngerminal continuity, which is the basis of biological ideas regarding\r\nheredity (see, further, Chapter XV).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.--Franz Leydig, 1821-1908 (April).\r\n\r\nCourtesy of Dr. Wm. M. Wheeler.]\r\n\r\nLeydig.--Franz Leydig (Fig. 52) was early in the field as a histologist\r\nwith his handbook (_Lehrbuch der Histologie des Menschen und der\r\nThiere_) published in 1857. He applied histology especially to the\r\ntissues of insects in 1864 and subsequent years, an account of which\r\nhas already been given in Chapter V.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.--S. Ramon y Cajal, 1850-]\r\n\r\nCajal as Histologist.--Ramon y Cajal, professor in the University of\r\nMadrid, is a histologist whose work in a special field of research is\r\nof world-wide renown. His investigations into the microscopic texture\r\nof the nervous system and sense-organs have in large part cleared\r\nup the questions of the complicated relations between the nervous\r\nelements. In company with other European investigators he visited the\r\nUnited States in 1899 on the invitation of Clark University, where his\r\nlectures were a feature of the celebration of the tenth anniversary of\r\nthat university. Besides receiving many honors in previous years, in\r\n1906 he was awarded, in conjunction with the Italian histologist Golgi,\r\none of the Nobel prizes in recognition of his notable investigations.\r\nGolgi invented the staining methods that Ramon y Cajal has applied so\r\nextensively and so successfully to the histology of the nervous system.\r\n\r\nThese men in particular may be remembered as the investigators who\r\nexpanded the work of Bichat on the tissues: Schwann, for disclosing the\r\nmicroscopic elements of animal tissues and founding the cell-theory;\r\nKoelliker, as the typical histologist after the analysis of tissues\r\ninto their elementary parts; Virchow, as extending the cell-idea\r\nto abnormal histology; Leydig, for applying histology to the lower\r\nanimals; and Ramon y Cajal, for investigations into the histology of\r\nthe nervous system.\r\n\r\nText-Books of Histology.--Besides the works mentioned, the text-books\r\nof Frey, Stricker, Ranvier, Klein, Schäfer, and others represent a\r\nperiod in the general introduction of histology to students between\r\n1859 and 1885. But these excellent text-books have been largely\r\nsuperseded by the more recent ones of Stöhr, Boem-Davidoff, Piersol,\r\nSzymonowicz, and others. The number of living investigators in\r\nhistology is enormous; and their work in the subject of cell-structure\r\nand in the department of embryology now overlaps.\r\n\r\nIn pathological histology may be observed an illustration of the\r\napplication of biological studies to medicine. While no attempt is\r\nmade to give an account of these practical applications, they are of\r\ntoo great importance to go unmentioned. Histological methods are in\r\nconstant use in clinical diagnosis, as in blood counts, the study\r\nof inflammations, of the action of phagocytes, and of all manner of\r\nabnormal growths.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to trace the beginning of a definite foundation for the\r\nwork on the structure of tissues, we go back to Bichat rather than to\r\nLeeuwenhoek, as Richardson has proposed. Bichat was the first to give a\r\nscientific basis for histology founded on extensive observations, since\r\nall earlier observers gave only separated accounts of the structure of\r\nparticular tissues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF PHYSIOLOGY\r\n\r\nHarvey Haller Johannes Müller\r\n\r\nPhysiology had a parallel development with anatomy, but for convenience\r\nit will be considered separately. Anatomy shows us that animals and\r\nplants are wonderfully constructed, but after we understand their\r\narchitecture and even their minute structure, the questions remain,\r\nWhat are all the organs and tissues for? and what takes place within\r\nthe parts that are actually alive? Physiology attempts to answer\r\nquestions of this nature. It stands, therefore, in contrast with\r\nanatomy, and is supplementary to it. The activities of living organisms\r\nare varied, and depend on life for their manifestations. These\r\nmanifestations may be called vital activities. Physiology embraces a\r\nstudy of them all.\r\n\r\nPhysiology of the Ancients.--This subject began to attract the\r\nattention of ancient medical men who wished to fathom the activities\r\nof the body in order to heal its diseases, but it is such a difficult\r\nthing to begin to comprehend the activities of life that even the\r\nsimpler relationships were imperfectly understood, and they resorted to\r\nmythical explanations. They spoke of spirits and humors in the body as\r\ncauses of various changes; the arteries were supposed to carry air, the\r\nveins only blood; and nothing was known of the circulation. There arose\r\namong these early medical men the idea that the body was dominated by a\r\nsubtle spirit. This went under the name _pneuma_, and the pneuma-theory\r\nheld sway until the period of the Revival of Learning.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient physiologists the great Roman physician Galen is the\r\nmost noteworthy figure. As he was the greatest anatomist, so he was\r\nalso the greatest physiologist of ancient times. All physiological\r\nknowledge of the time centered in his writings, and these were the\r\nstandards of physiology for many centuries, as they were also for\r\nanatomy. In the early days anatomy, physiology, and medicine were all\r\nunited into a poorly digested mass of facts and fancies. This state\r\nof affairs lasted until the sixteenth century, and then the awakening\r\ncame, through the efforts of gifted men, endued with the spirit of\r\nindependent investigation. The advances made depended upon the work\r\nor leadership of these men, and there are certain periods of especial\r\nimportance for the advance of physiology that must be pointed out.\r\n\r\nPeriod of Harvey.--The first of these epochs to be especially noted\r\nhere is the period of Harvey (1578-1657). In his time the old idea of\r\nspirits and humors was giving way, but there was still much vagueness\r\nregarding the activities of the body. He helped to illuminate the\r\nsubject by showing a connection between arteries and veins, and by\r\ndemonstrating the circulation of the blood. As we have seen in an\r\nearlier chapter, Harvey did not observe the blood passing through the\r\ncapillaries from arteries to veins, but his reasoning was unassailable\r\nthat such a connection must exist, and that the blood made a complete\r\ncirculation. He gave his conclusions in his medical lectures as early\r\nas 1619, but did not publish his views until 1628. It was reserved\r\nfor Malpighi, in 1661, actually to see the circulation through the\r\ncapillaries under the microscope, and for Leeuwenhoek, in 1669 and\r\nlater years, to extend these observations.\r\n\r\nIt was during Harvey's life that the microscope was brought into\r\nuse and was of such great assistance in advancing knowledge. Harvey\r\nhimself, however, made little use of this instrument. It was during\r\nhis life also that the knowledge of development was greatly promoted,\r\nfirst through his own efforts, and later through those of Malpighi.\r\n\r\nHarvey is to be recognized, then, as the father of modern physiology.\r\nIndeed, before his time physiology as such can hardly be spoken of\r\nas having come into existence. He introduced experimental work into\r\nphysiology, and thus laid the foundation of modern investigation. It\r\nwas the method of Harvey that made definite progress in this line\r\npossible, and accordingly we honor him as one of the greatest as well\r\nas the earliest of physiologists.\r\n\r\nPeriod of Haller.--From Harvey's time we pass to the period of\r\nHaller (1708-1777), at the beginning of which physiology was still\r\nwrapped up with medicine and anatomy. The great work of Haller was\r\nto create an independent science of physiology. He made it a subject\r\nto be studied for its own sake, and not merely as an adjunct to\r\nmedicine. Haller was a man of vast and varied learning, and to him\r\nwas applied by unsympathetic critics the title of \"that abyss of\r\nlearning.\" His portrait, as shown in Fig. 54, gives the impression of\r\na somewhat pompous and overbearing personality. He was egotistical,\r\nself-complacent, and possessed of great self-esteem. The assurance\r\nin the inerrancy of his own conclusions was a marked characteristic\r\nof Haller's mind. While he was a good observer, his own work showing\r\nconscientious care in observation, he was not a good interpreter, and\r\nwe are to recollect that he vigorously opposed the idea of development\r\nset forth by Wolff, and we must also recognize that his researches\r\nformed the chief starting-point of an erroneous conception of vitality.\r\n\r\nAs Verworn points out, Haller's own experiments upon the phenomena of\r\nirritability were exact, but they were misinterpreted by his followers,\r\nand through the molding influence of others the attempted explanation\r\nof their meaning grew into the conception of a special vital force\r\nbelonging to living organisms only. In its most complete form, this\r\nidea provided for a distinct dualism between living and lifeless\r\nmatter, making all vital actions dependent upon the operation of a\r\nmystical supernatural agency. This assumption removed vital phenomena\r\nfrom the domain of clear scientific analysis, and for a long time\r\nexercised a retarding influence upon the progress of physiology.\r\n\r\nHis chief service of permanent value was that he brought into one work\r\nall the facts and the chief theories of physiology carefully arranged\r\nand digested. This, as has been said, made physiology an independent\r\nbranch of science, to be pursued for itself and not merely as an\r\nadjunct to the study of medicine. The work referred to is his Elements\r\nof Physiology (_Elementa Physiologiæ Corporis Humani_, 1758), one\r\nof the noteworthy books marking a distinct epoch in the progress of\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.--Albrecht Haller, 1708-1777.]\r\n\r\nTo the period of Haller also belongs the discovery of oxygen, in 1774,\r\nby Priestley, a discovery which was destined to have profound influence\r\nupon the subsequent development of physiology, so that even now\r\nphysiology consists largely in tracing the way in which oxygen enters\r\nthe body, the manner in which it is distributed to the tissues, and the\r\nvarious phases of vital activity that it brings about within the living\r\ntissues.\r\n\r\nCharles Bell.--The period of Haller may be considered as extending\r\nbeyond his lifetime and as terminating when the influence of Müller\r\nbegan to be felt. Another discovery coming in the closing years of\r\nHaller's period marks a capital advance in physiology. I refer to the\r\ndiscovery of Charles Bell (1774-1842) showing that the nerve fibers of\r\nthe anterior roots of the spinal cord belong to the motor type, while\r\nthose of the posterior roots belong to the sensory type.\r\n\r\nThis great truth was arrived at theoretically, rather than as the\r\nresult of experimental demonstration. It was first expounded by Bell\r\nin 1811 in a small essay entitled _Idea of a New Anatomy of the\r\nBrain_, which was printed for private distribution. It was expanded\r\nin his papers, beginning in 1821, and published in the Philosophical\r\nTransactions of the Royal Society of London, and finally embodied in\r\nhis work on the nervous system, published in 1830. At this latter date\r\nJohannes Müller had reached the age of twenty-nine, and had already\r\nentered upon his career as the leading physiologist of Germany. What\r\nBell had divined he demonstrated by experiments.\r\n\r\nCharles Bell (Fig. 55) was a surgeon of eminence; in private life he\r\nwas distinguished by \"unpretending amenity, and simplicity of manners\r\nand deportment.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.--Charles Bell, 1774-1842.]\r\n\r\nPeriod of Johannes Müller.--The period that marks the beginning of\r\nmodern physiology came next, and was due to the genius and force of\r\nJohannes Müller (1801-1858). Verworn says of him: \"He is one of those\r\nmonumental figures that the history of every science brings forth but\r\nonce. They change the whole aspect of the field in which they work,\r\nand all later growth is influenced by their labors.\" Johannes Müller\r\nwas a man of very unusual talent and attainments, the possessor of\r\na master mind. Some have said, and not without reason, that there\r\nwas something supernatural about Müller, for his whole appearance\r\nbore the stamp of the uncommon. His portrait, with its massive head\r\nabove the broad shoulders, is shown in Fig. 56. In his lectures his\r\nmanner and his gestures reminded one of a Catholic priest. Early in\r\nhis life, before the disposition to devote himself to science became\r\nso overwhelming, he thought of entering the priesthood, and there\r\nclung to him all his life some marks of the holy profession. In his\r\nhighly intellectual face we find \"a trace of severity in his mouth and\r\ncompressed lips, with the expression of most earnest thought on his\r\nbrow and eyes, and with the remembrance of a finished work in every\r\nwrinkle of his countenance.\"\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary man exercised a profound influence upon those who\r\ncame into contact with him. He excited almost unbounded enthusiasm and\r\ngreat veneration among his students. They were allowed to work close by\r\nhis side, and so magnetic was his personality that he stimulated them\r\npowerfully and succeeded in transmitting to them some of his own mental\r\nqualities. As professor of physiology in Berlin, Müller trained many\r\ngifted young men, among whom were Ludwig (1816-1895), Du Bois-Reymond\r\n(1818-1896), and Helmholtz (1821-1894), who became distinguished\r\nscholars and professors in German universities. Helmholtz, speaking of\r\nMüller's influence on students, paid this tribute to the grandeur of\r\nhis teacher: \"Whoever comes into contact with men of the first rank has\r\nan altered scale of values in life. Such intellectual contact is the\r\nmost interesting event that life can offer.\"\r\n\r\nThe particular service of Johannes Müller to science was to make\r\nphysiology broadly comparative. So comprehensive was his grasp upon\r\nthe subject that he gained for himself the title of the greatest\r\nphysiologist of modern times. He brought together in his great work on\r\nthe physiology of man not only all that had been previously made known,\r\ncarefully sifted and digested, but a great mass of new information,\r\nwhich was the result of his own investigations and of those of his\r\nstudents. So rigorous were his scientific standards that he did not\r\nadmit into this treatise anything which had been untested either by\r\nhimself or by some of his assistants or students. Verworn says of this\r\nmonumental work, which appeared in 1833, under the title _Handbuch der\r\nPhysiologie des Menschen_: \"This work stands to-day unsurpassed in the\r\ngenuinely philosophical manner in which the material, swollen to vast\r\nproportions by innumerable special researches, was for the first time\r\nsifted and elaborated into a unitary picture of the mechanism within\r\nthe living organism. In this respect the _Handbuch_ is to-day not only\r\nunsurpassed, but unequalled.\"\r\n\r\nMüller was the most accurate of observers; indeed, he is the most\r\nconspicuous example in the nineteenth century of a man who accomplished\r\na prodigious amount of work all of which was of the highest quality. In\r\nphysiology he stood on broader lines than had ever been used before.\r\nHe employed every means at his command--experimenting, the observation\r\nof simple animals, the microscope, the discoveries in physics, in\r\nchemistry, and in psychology.\r\n\r\nHe also introduced into physiology the principles of psychology, and\r\nit is from the period of Johannes Müller that we are to associate\r\nrecognition of the close connection between the operations of the\r\nmind and the physiology of the brain that has come to occupy such a\r\nconspicuous position at the present time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.--Johannes Müller, 1801-1858.]\r\n\r\nMüller died in 1858, having reached the age of fifty-seven, but his\r\ninfluence was prolonged through the teachings of his students.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysiology after Müller\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.--Ludwig, 1816-1895.]\r\n\r\nLudwig.--Among the men who handed on the torch of Müller there has\r\nalready been mentioned Ludwig (Fig. 57). For many years he lectured in\r\nthe University of Leipsic, attracting to that university high-minded,\r\neager, and gifted young men, who received from this great luminary of\r\nphysiology by expression what he himself had derived from contact with\r\nMüller. There are to-day distributed through the universities a number\r\nof young physiologists who stand only one generation removed from\r\nJohannes Müller, and who still labor in the spirit that was introduced\r\ninto this department of study by that great master.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.--Du Bois-Reymond, 1818-1896.]\r\n\r\nDu Bois-Reymond.--Du Bois-Reymond (Fig. 58), another of his\r\ndistinguished pupils, came to occupy the chair which Müller himself\r\nhad filled in the University of Berlin, and during the period of his\r\nvigor was in physiology one of the lights of the world. It is no\r\nuncommon thing to find recently published physiologies dedicated either\r\nto the memory of Johannes Müller, as in the case of that remarkable\r\n_General Physiology_ by Verworn; or to Ludwig, or to Du Bois-Reymond,\r\nwho were in part his intellectual product. From this disposition among\r\nphysiologists to do homage to Müller, we are able to estimate somewhat\r\nmore closely the tremendous reach of his influence.\r\n\r\nBernard.--When Müller was twelve years old there was born in\r\nSaint-Julien, department of the Rhône, Claude Bernard, who attained\r\nan eminence as a physiologist, of which the French nation are justly\r\nproud. Although he was little thought of as a student, nevertheless\r\nafter he came under the influence of Magendie, at the age of\r\ntwenty-six, he developed rapidly and showed his true metal. He\r\nexhibited great manual dexterity in performing experiments, and also a\r\nluminous quality of mind in interpreting his observations. One of his\r\ngreatest achievements in physiology was the discovery of the formation\r\nwithin the liver of glycogen, a substance chemically related to sugar.\r\nLater he discovered the system of vaso-motor nerves that control and\r\nregulate the caliber of the blood-vessels. Both of these discoveries\r\nassisted materially in understanding the wonderful changes that are\r\ngoing on within the human body. But besides his technical researches,\r\nany special consideration of which lies quite beyond the purpose of\r\nthis book, he published in 1878-1879 a work upon the phenomena of\r\nlife in animals and vegetables, a work that had general influence\r\nin extending the knowledge of vital activities. I refer to his now\r\nclassic _Leçons sur les Phénomènes de la vie communs aux animaux et aux\r\nvégétaux_.\r\n\r\nThe thoughtful face of Bernard is shown in his portrait, Fig. 59. He\r\nwas one of those retiring, silent men whose natures are difficult to\r\nfathom, and who are so frequently misunderstood. A domestic infelicity,\r\nthat led to the separation of himself from his family, added to his\r\nisolation and loneliness. When touched by the social spirit he charmed\r\npeople by his personality. He was admired by the Emperor Napoleon\r\nThird, through whose influence Bernard acquired two fine laboratories.\r\nIn 1868 he was elected to the French Academy, and became thereby one of\r\nthe \"Forty Immortals.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.--Claude Bernard, 1813-1878.]\r\n\r\nFoster describes him thus: \"Tall in stature, with a fine presence,\r\nwith a noble head, the eyes full at once of thought and kindness, he\r\ndrew the look of observers upon him wherever he appeared. As he walked\r\nin the streets passers-by might be heard to say 'I wonder who that is;\r\nhe must be some distinguished man.'\"\r\n\r\nTwo Directions of Growth.--Physiology, established on the broad\r\nfoundations of Müller, developed along two independent pathways, the\r\nphysical and the chemical. We find a group of physiologists, among whom\r\nWeber, Ludwig, Du Bois-Reymond, and Helmholtz were noteworthy leaders,\r\ndevoted to the investigations of physiological facts through the\r\napplication of measurements and records made by machinery. With these\r\nmen came into use the time-markers, the myographs, and the ingenious\r\nmethods of recording blood-pressure, changes in respiration, the\r\nresponses of muscle and nerve to various forms of stimulation, the rate\r\nof transmission of nerve-currents, etc.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of vital activities by means of measurements and\r\ninstrumental records has come to represent one especial phase of\r\nmodern physiology. As might have been predicted, the discoveries and\r\nextensions of knowledge resulting from this kind of experimentation\r\nhave been remarkable, since it is obvious that permanent records made\r\nby mechanical devices will rule out many errors; and, moreover, they\r\nafford an opportunity to study at leisure phenomena that occupy a very\r\nbrief time.\r\n\r\nThe other marked line of physiological investigation has been in the\r\ndomain of chemistry, where Wöhler, Liebig, Kühne, and others have,\r\nthrough the study of the chemical changes occurring in its body,\r\nobserved the various activities that take place within the organism.\r\nThey have reduced all tissues and all parts of the body to chemical\r\nanalysis, studied the chemical changes in digestion, in respiration,\r\netc. The more recent observers have also made a particular feature of\r\nthe study of the chemical changes going on within the living matter.\r\n\r\nThe union of these two chief tendencies into the physico-chemical\r\naspects of physiology has established the modern way of looking upon\r\nvital activities. These vital activities are now regarded as being, in\r\ntheir ultimate analysis, due to physical and chemical changes taking\r\nplace within the living substratum. All along, this physico-chemical\r\nidea has been in contest with that of a duality between the body and\r\nthe life that is manifested in it. The vitalists, then, have had\r\nmany controversies with those who make their interpretations along\r\nphysico-chemical lines. We will recollect that vitalism in the hands of\r\nthe immediate successors of Haller became not only highly speculative,\r\nbut highly mystical, tending to obscure any close analysis of vital\r\nactivity and throwing explanations all back into the domain of\r\nmysticism. Johannes Müller was also a vitalist, but his vitalism was\r\nof a more acceptable form. He thought of changes in the body as being\r\ndue to vitality--to a living force; but he did not deny the possibility\r\nof the transformation of this vital energy into other forms of energy;\r\nand upon the basis of Müller's work there has been built up the\r\nmodern conception that there is found in the human body a particular\r\ntransformation-form of energy, not a mystical vital force that presides\r\nover all manifestations of life.\r\n\r\nThe advances in physiology, beginning with those of William Harvey,\r\nhave had immense influence not only upon medicine, but upon all\r\nbiology. We find now the successful and happy union between physiology\r\nand morphology in the work which is being so assiduously carried on\r\nto-day under the title of experimental morphology.\r\n\r\nThe great names in physiology since Müller are numerous, and perhaps it\r\nis invidious to mention particular ones; but, inasmuch as Ludwig and Du\r\nBois-Reymond have been spoken of, we may associate with them the names\r\nof Sir Michael Foster and Burdon-Sanderson, in England; and of Brücke\r\n(one of Müller's disciples) and Verworn, in Germany, as modern leaders\r\nwhose investigations have promoted advance, and whose clear exposition\r\nof the facts and the theories of physiology have added much to the\r\ndignity of the science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nVON BAER AND THE RISE OF EMBRYOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nAnatomy investigates the arrangement of organic tissues; embryology, or\r\nthe science of development, shows how they are produced and arranged.\r\nThere is no more fascinating division of biological study. As Minot\r\nsays: \"Indeed, the stories which embryology has to tell are the most\r\nromantic known to us, and the wildest imaginative creations of Scott\r\nor Dumas are less startling than the innumerable and almost incredible\r\nshifts of rôle and change of character which embryology has to\r\nentertain us with in her histories.\"\r\n\r\nEmbryology is one of the most important biological sciences in\r\nfurnishing clues to the past history of animals. Every organism\r\nabove the very lowest, no matter how complex, begins its existence\r\nas a single microscopic cell, and between that simple state and the\r\nfully formed condition every gradation of structure is exhibited.\r\nEvery time an animal is developed these constructive changes are\r\nrepeated in orderly sequence, and one who studies the series of steps\r\nin development is led to recognize that the process of building an\r\nanimal's body is one of the most wonderful in all nature.\r\n\r\nRudimentary Organs.--But, strangely enough, the course of development\r\nin any higher organism is not straightforward, but devious. Instead of\r\norgans being produced in the most direct manner, unexpected by-paths\r\nare followed, as when all higher animals acquire gill-clefts and many\r\nother rudimentary organs not adapted to their condition of life.\r\nMost of the rudimentary organs are transitory, and bear testimony, as\r\nhereditary survivals, to the line of ancestry. They are clues by means\r\nof which phases in the evolution of animal life may be deciphered.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind the continually shifting changes through which animals\r\npass in their embryonic development, one begins to see why the adult\r\nstructures of animals are so difficult to understand. They are not\r\nonly complex; they are also greatly modified. The adult condition of\r\nany organ or tissue is the last step in a series of gradually acquired\r\nmodifications, and is, therefore, the farthest departure from that\r\nwhich is ancestral and archetypal. But in the process of formation\r\nall the simpler conditions are exhibited. If, therefore, we wish to\r\nunderstand an organ or an animal, we must follow its development, and\r\nsee it in simpler conditions, before the great modifications have been\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nThe tracing of the stages whereby cells merge into tissues, tissues\r\ninto organs, and determining how the organs by combinations build\r\nup the body, is embryology. On account of the extended applications\r\nof this subject in biology, and the light which it throws on all\r\nstructural studies, we shall be justified in giving its history at\r\nsomewhat greater length than that adopted in treating of other topics.\r\n\r\nFive Historical Periods.--The story of the rise of this interesting\r\ndepartment of biology can, for convenience, be divided into five\r\nperiods, each marked by an advance in general knowledge. These are: (1)\r\nthe period of Harvey and Malpighi; (2) the period of Wolff; (3) the\r\nperiod of Von Baer; (4) the period from Von Baer to Balfour; and (5)\r\nthe period of Balfour, with an indication of present tendencies. Among\r\nall the leaders Von Baer stands as a monumental figure at the parting\r\nof the ways between the new and the old--the sane thinker, the great\r\nobserver.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Period of Harvey and Malpighi\r\n\r\nIn General.--The usual account of the rise of embryology is derived\r\nfrom German writers. But there is reason to depart from their\r\ntraditions, in which Wolff is heralded as its founder, and the one\r\ncentral figure prior to Pander and Von Baer.\r\n\r\nThe embryological work of Wolff's great predecessors, Harvey and\r\nMalpighi, has been passed over too lightly. Although these men have\r\nreceived ample recognition in closely related fields of investigation,\r\ntheir insight into those mysterious events that culminate in the\r\nformation of a new animal has been rarely appreciated. Now and then a\r\nfew writers, as Brooks and Whitman, have pointed out the great worth\r\nof Harvey's work in embryology, but fewer have spoken for Malpighi in\r\nthis connection. Koelliker, it is true, in his address at the unveiling\r\nof the statue of Malpighi, in his native town of Crevalcuore, in 1894,\r\ngives him well-merited recognition as the founder of embryology, and\r\nthe late Sir Michael Foster has written in a similar vein in his\r\ndelightful _Lectures on the History of Physiology_.\r\n\r\nHowever great was Harvey's work in embryology, I venture to say that\r\nMalpighi's was greater when considered as a piece of observation.\r\nHarvey's work is more philosophical; he discusses the nature of\r\ndevelopment, and shows unusual powers as an accurate reasoner. But that\r\npart of his treatise devoted to observation is far less extensive and\r\nexact than Malpighi's, and throughout his lengthy discussions he has\r\nthe flavor of the ancients.\r\n\r\nMalpighi's work, on the contrary, flavors more of the moderns. In terse\r\ndescriptions, and with many sketches, he shows the changes in the hen's\r\negg from the close of the first day of development onward.\r\n\r\nIt is a noteworthy fact that, at the period in which he lived,\r\nMalpighi could so successfully curb the tendency to indulge in wordy\r\ndisquisitions, and that he was satisfied to observe carefully, and tell\r\nhis story in a simple way. This quality of mind is rare. As Emerson has\r\nsaid: \"I am impressed with the fact that the greatest thing a human\r\nsoul ever does in this world is to see something, and tell what it saw\r\nin a plain way. Hundreds of people can talk for one who can think, but\r\nthousands can think for one who can see. To see clearly is poetry,\r\nphilosophy, and religion all in one.\" But \"to see\" here means, of\r\ncourse, to interpret as well as to observe.\r\n\r\nAlthough there were observers in the field of embryology before Harvey,\r\nlittle of substantial value had been produced. The earliest attempts\r\nwere vague and uncritical, embracing only fragmentary views of the\r\nmore obvious features of body-formation. Nor, indeed, should we look\r\nfor much advance in the field of embryology even in Harvey's time. The\r\nreason for this will become obvious when we remember that the renewal\r\nof independent observation had just been brought about in the preceding\r\ncentury by Vesalius, and that Harvey himself was one of the pioneers in\r\nthe intellectual awakening. Studies on the development of the body are\r\nspecialized, involving observations on minute structures and recondite\r\nprocesses, and must, therefore, wait upon considerable advances in\r\nanatomy and physiology. Accordingly, the science of embryology was of\r\nlate development.\r\n\r\nHarvey.--Harvey's was the first attempt to make a critical analysis\r\nof the process of development, and that he did not attain more was\r\nnot owing to limitations of his powers of discernment, but to the\r\nnecessity of building on the general level of the science of his time,\r\nand, further, to his lack of instruments of observation and technique.\r\nNevertheless, Harvey may be considered as having made the first\r\nindependent advance in embryology.\r\n\r\nBy clearly teaching, on the basis of his own observations, the gradual\r\nformation of the body by aggregation of its parts, he anticipated\r\nWolff. This doctrine came to be known under the title of \"epigenesis,\"\r\nbut Harvey's epigenesis[3] was not, as Wolff's was, directed against\r\na theory of pre-delineation of the parts of the embryo, but against\r\nthe ideas of the medical men of the time regarding the metamorphosis\r\nof germinal elements. It lacked, therefore, the dramatic setting which\r\nsurrounded the work of Wolff in the next century. Had the doctrine of\r\npre-formation been current in Harvey's time, we are quite justified in\r\nassuming that he would have assailed it as vigorously as did Wolff.\r\n\r\nHis Treatise on Generation.--Harvey's embryological work was published\r\nin 1651 under the title _Exercitationes de Generatione Animalium_. It\r\nembraces not only observations on the development of the chick, but\r\nalso on the deer and some other mammals. As he was the court physician\r\nof Charles I, that sovereign had many deer killed in the park, at\r\nintervals, in order to give Harvey the opportunity to study their\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nAs fruits of his observation on the chick, he showed the position in\r\nwhich the embryo arises within the egg, _viz._, in the white opaque\r\nspot or cicatricula; and he also corrected Aristotle, Fabricius, and\r\nhis other predecessors in many particulars.\r\n\r\nHarvey's greatest predecessor in this field, Fabricius, was also his\r\nteacher. When, in search of the best training in medicine, Harvey took\r\nhis way from England to Italy, as already recounted, he came under\r\nthe instruction of Fabricius in Padua. In 1600, Fabricius published\r\nsketches showing the development of animals; and, again, in 1625,\r\nsix years after his death, appeared his illustrated treatise on the\r\ndevelopment of the chick. Except the figures of Coiter (1573), those\r\nof Fabricius were the earliest published illustrations of the kind.\r\nAltogether his figures show developmental stages of the cow, sheep,\r\npig, galeus, serpent, rat, and chick.\r\n\r\nHarvey's own treatise was not illustrated. With that singular\r\nindependence of mind for which he was conspicuous, the vision of the\r\npupil was not hampered by the authority of his teacher, and, trusting\r\nonly to his own sure observation and reason, he described the stages of\r\ndevelopment as he saw them in the egg, and placed his own construction\r\non the facts.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest activities to arrest his attention in the chick was\r\na pulsating point, the heart, and, from this observation, he supposed\r\nthat the heart and the blood were the first formations. He says: \"But\r\nas soon as the egg, under the influence of the gentle warmth of the\r\nincubating hen, or of warmth derived from another source, begins to\r\npullulate, this spot forthwith dilates, and expands like the pupil of\r\nthe eye; and from thence, as the grand center of the egg, the latent\r\nplastic force breaks forth and germinates. This first commencement of\r\nthe chick, however, so far as I am aware, has not yet been observed by\r\nany one.\"\r\n\r\nIt is to be understood, however, that the descriptive part of his\r\ntreatise is relatively brief (about 40 pages out of 350 in Willis's\r\ntranslation), and that the bulk of the 106 \"exercises\" into which his\r\nwork is divided is devoted to comments on the older writers and to\r\ndiscussions of the nature of the process of development.\r\n\r\nThe aphorism, \"_omne vivum ex ovo_,\" though not invented by Harvey,\r\nwas brought into general use through his writings. As used in his day,\r\nhowever, it did not have its full modern significance. With Harvey it\r\nmeant simply that the embryos of all animals, the viviparous as well as\r\nthe oviparous, originate in eggs, and it was directed against certain\r\ncontrary medical theories of the time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.--Frontispiece to Harvey's _Generatione\r\nAnimalium_ (1651).]\r\n\r\nThe first edition of his _Generatione Animalium_, London, 1651, is\r\nprovided with an allegorical frontispiece embodying this idea. As shown\r\nin Fig. 60, it represents Jove on a pedestal, uncovering a round box,\r\nor ovum, bearing the inscription \"_ex ovo omnia_,\" and from the box\r\nissue all forms of living creatures, including also man.\r\n\r\nMalpighi.--The observer in embryology who looms into prominence\r\nbetween Harvey and Wolff is Malpighi. He supplied what was greatly\r\nneeded at the time--an illustrated account of the actual stages in the\r\ndevelopment of the chick from the end of the first day to hatching,\r\nshorn of verbose references and speculations.\r\n\r\nHis observations on development are in two separate memoirs, both sent\r\nto the Royal Society in 1672, and published by the Society in Latin,\r\nunder the titles _De Formatione Pulli in Ovo_ and _De Ovo Incubato_.\r\nThe two taken together are illustrated by twelve plates containing\r\neighty-six figures, and the twenty-two quarto pages of text are nearly\r\nall devoted to descriptions, a marked contrast to the 350 pages of\r\nHarvey unprovided with illustrations.\r\n\r\nHis pictures, although not correct in all particulars, represent what\r\nhe was able to see, and are very remarkable for the age in which they\r\nwere made, and considering the instruments of observation at his\r\ncommand. They show successive stages from the time the embryo is first\r\noutlined, and, taken in their entirety, they cover a wide range of\r\nstages.\r\n\r\nHis observations on the development of the heart, comprising twenty\r\nfigures, are the most complete. He clearly illustrates the aortic\r\narches, those transitory structures of such great interest as showing a\r\nphase in ancestral history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61.--Selected Sketches from Malpighi's Works.\r\nShowing Stages in the Development of the Chick (1672).]\r\n\r\nHe was also the first to show by pictures the formation of the\r\nhead-fold and the neural groove, as well as the brain-vesicles and\r\neye-pockets. His delineation of heart, brain, and eye-vesicles are far\r\nahead of those illustrating Wolff's _Theoria Generationis_, made nearly\r\na hundred years later.\r\n\r\nFig. 61 shows a few selected sketches from the various plates of his\r\nembryological treatises, to compare with those of Wolff. (See Fig. 63.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62.--Marcello Malpighi, 1628-1694.]\r\n\r\nThe original drawings for _De Ovo Incubato_, still in possession of the\r\nRoyal Society, are made in pencil and red chalk, and an examination\r\nof them shows that they far surpass the reproductions in finish and\r\naccuracy.\r\n\r\nWhile Harvey taught the gradual formation of parts, Malpighi, from his\r\nown observations, supposed the rudiments of the embryo to pre-exist\r\nwithin the egg. He thought that, possibly, the blood-vessels were in\r\nthe form of tubes, closely wrapped together, which by becoming filled\r\nwith blood were distended. Nevertheless, in the treatises mentioned\r\nabove he is very temperate in his expressions on the whole matter, and\r\nevidently believed in the new formation of many parts.\r\n\r\nThe portrait of Malpighi shown in Fig. 62 is taken from his life by\r\nAtti. From descriptions of his personal appearance (see page 58) one\r\nwould think that this is probably a better likeness than the strikingly\r\nhandsome portrait painted by Tabor, and presented by Malpighi to the\r\nRoyal Society of London. For a reproduction of the latter see page 59.\r\n\r\nMalpighi's Rank.--On the whole, Malpighi should rank above Harvey as an\r\nembryologist, on account of his discoveries and fuller representation,\r\nby drawings and descriptions, of the process of development. As Sir\r\nMichael Foster has said: \"The first adequate description of the long\r\nseries of changes by which, as they melt the one into the other,\r\nlike dissolving views, the little white opaque spot in the egg is\r\ntransformed into the feathered, living, active bird, was given by\r\nMalpighi. And where he left it, so for the most part the matter\r\nremained until even the present century. For this reason we may speak\r\nof him as the founder of embryology.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Period of Wolff\r\n\r\nBetween Harvey and Wolff, embryology had become dominated by the theory\r\nthat the embryo exists already pre-formed within the egg, and, as a\r\nresult of the rise of this new doctrine, the publications of Wolff had\r\na different setting from that of any of his predecessors. It is only\r\nfair to say that to this circumstance is owing, in large part, the\r\nprominence of his name in connection with the theory of epigenesis.\r\nAs we have already seen, Harvey, more than a century before the\r\npublications of Wolff, had clearly taught that development is a process\r\nof gradual becoming. Nevertheless, Wolff's work, as opposed to the new\r\ntheory, was very important.\r\n\r\nWhile the facts fail to support the contention that he was the founder\r\nof epigenesis, it is to be remembered that he has claims in other\r\ndirections to rank as the foremost student of embryology prior to Von\r\nBaer.\r\n\r\nAs a preliminary to discussing Wolff's position, we should bring under\r\nconsideration the doctrine of pre-formation and encasement.\r\n\r\nRise of the Theory of Pre-delineation.--The idea of pre-formation in\r\nits first form is easily set forth. Just as when we examine a seed we\r\nfind within an embryo plantlet, so it was supposed that the various\r\nforms of animal life existed in miniature within the egg. The process\r\nof development was supposed to consist of the expansion or unfolding\r\nof this pre-formed embryo. The process was commonly illustrated by\r\nreference to flower-buds. \"Just as already in a small bud all the\r\nparts of the flower, such as stamens and colored petals, are enveloped\r\nby the green and still undeveloped sepals; just as the parts grow in\r\nconcealment and then suddenly expand into a blossom, so also in the\r\ndevelopment of animals, it was thought that the already present, small\r\nbut transparent parts grow, gradually expand, and become discernible.\"\r\n(Hertwig.) From the feature of unfolding this was called in the\r\neighteenth century the theory of _evolution_, giving to that term quite\r\na different meaning from that attached to it at the present time.\r\n\r\nThis theory, strange as it may seem to us now, was founded on a\r\nbasis of actual observation--not entirely on speculation. Although\r\nit was a product of the seventeenth century, from several printed\r\naccounts one is likely to gather the impression that it arose in the\r\neighteenth century, and that Bonnet, Haller, and Leibnitz were among\r\nits founders. This implication is in part fostered by the circumstance\r\nthat Swammerdam's _Biblia Naturæ_, which contains the germ of the\r\ntheory, was not published until 1737--more than half a century\r\nafter his death--although the observations for it were completed\r\nbefore Malpighi's first paper on embryology was published in 1672.\r\nWhile it is well to bear in mind that date of publication, rather\r\nthan date of observation, is accepted as establishing the period of\r\nemergence of ideas, there were other men, as Malpighi and Leeuwenhoek,\r\ncontemporaries of Swammerdam, who published in the seventeenth century\r\nthe basis for this theory.\r\n\r\nMalpighi supposed (1672) the rudiment of the embryo to pre-exist within\r\nthe hen's egg, because he observed evidences of organization in the\r\nunincubated egg. This was in the heat of the Italian summer (in July\r\nand August, as he himself records), and Dareste suggests that the\r\ndevelopmental changes had gone forward to a considerable degree before\r\nMalpighi opened the eggs. Be this as it may, the imperfection of his\r\ninstruments and technique would have made it very difficult to see\r\nanything definitely in stages under twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nIn reference to his observations, he says that in the unincubated egg\r\nhe saw a small embryo enclosed in a sac which he subjected to the rays\r\nof the sun. \"Frequently I opened the sac with the point of a needle,\r\nso that the animals contained within might be brought to the light,\r\nnevertheless to no purpose; for the individuals were so jelly-like and\r\nso very small that they were lacerated by a light stroke. Therefore,\r\nit is right to confess that the beginnings of the chick pre-exist in\r\nthe egg, and have reached a higher development in no other way than\r\nin the eggs of plants.\" (\"Quare _pulli stamina_ in ovo _præexistere_,\r\naltiorémque originem nacta esse fateri convenit, haud dispari ritu, ac\r\nin Plantarum ovis.\")\r\n\r\nSwammerdam (1637-1680) supplied a somewhat better basis. He observed\r\nthat the parts of the butterfly, and other insects as well, are\r\ndiscernible in the chrysalis stage. Also, on observing caterpillars\r\njust before going into the pupa condition, he saw in outline the organs\r\nof the future stage, and very naturally concluded that development\r\nconsists of an expansion of already formed parts.\r\n\r\nA new feature was introduced through the discovery, by Leeuwenhoek,\r\nabout 1677,[4] of the fertilizing filaments of eggs. Soon after,\r\ncontroversies began to arise as to whether the embryo pre-existed in\r\nthe sperm or in the egg. By Leeuwenhoek, Hartsoeker, and others the egg\r\nwas looked upon as simply a _nidus_ within which the sperm developed,\r\nand they asserted that the future animal existed in miniature in\r\nthe sperm. These controversies gave rise to the schools of the\r\nanimalculists, who believed the sperm to be the animal germ, and of the\r\novulists, who contended for the ovum in that rôle.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to follow the metaphysical speculations which led\r\nto another aspect of the doctrine of pre-formation. There were those,\r\nnotably Swammerdam, Leibnitz, and Bonnet, who did not hesitate to\r\nfollow the idea to the logical consequence that, if the animal germ\r\nexists pre-formed, one generation after another must be encased within\r\nit. This gave rise to the fanciful idea of encasement or _emboîtement_,\r\nwhich was so greatly elaborated by Bonnet and, by Leibnitz, applied to\r\nthe development of the soul. Even Swammerdam (who, by the way, though\r\na masterly observer, was always a poor generalizer) conceived of the\r\ngerms of all forthcoming generations as having been located in the\r\ncommon mother Eve, all closely encased one within the other, like the\r\nboxes of a Japanese juggler. The end of the human race was conceived\r\nof by him as a necessity, when the last germ of this wonderful series\r\nhad been unfolded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63.--Plate from Wolff's _Theoria Generationis_\r\n(1759), Showing Stages in the Development of the Chick.]\r\n\r\nHis successors, in efforts to compute the number of homunculi which\r\nmust have been condensed in the ovary of Eve, arrived at the amazing\r\nresult of two hundred millions.\r\n\r\nWork of Wolff.--Friedrich Kaspar Wolff, as a young man of twenty-six\r\nyears, set himself against this grotesque doctrine of pre-formation\r\nand encasement in his _Theoria Generationis_, published in 1759. This\r\nconsists of three parts: one devoted to the development of plants, one\r\nto the development of animals, and one to theoretical considerations.\r\nHe contended that the organs of animals make their appearance\r\ngradually, and that he could actually follow their successive stages of\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nThe figures in it illustrating the development of the chick, some\r\nof which are shown in Fig. 63, are not, on the whole, so good as\r\nMalpighi's. Wolff gives, in all, seventeen figures, while Malpighi\r\npublished eighty-six, and his twenty figures on the development of the\r\nheart are more detailed than any of Wolff's. When the figures represent\r\nsimilar stages of development, a comparison of the two men's work is\r\nfavorable to Malpighi. The latter shows much better, in corresponding\r\nstages, the series of cerebral vesicles and their relation to the optic\r\nvesicles. Moreover, in the wider range of his work, he shows many\r\nthings--such as the formation of the neural groove, etc.--not included\r\nin Wolff's observations. Wolff, on the other hand, figures for the\r\nfirst time the primitive kidneys, or \"Wolffian bodies,\" of which he was\r\nthe discoverer.\r\n\r\nAlthough Wolff was able to show that development consists of a gradual\r\nformation of parts, his theory of development was entirely mystical and\r\nunsatisfactory. The fruitful idea of germinal continuity had not yet\r\nemerged, and the thought that the egg has inherited an organization\r\nfrom the past was yet to be expressed. Wolff was, therefore, in\r\nthe same quandary as his predecessors when he undertook to explain\r\ndevelopment. Since he assumed a total lack of organization in the\r\nbeginning, he was obliged to make development \"miraculous\" through\r\nthe action on the egg of a hyperphysical agent. From a total lack of\r\norganization, he conceived of its being lifted to the highly organized\r\nproduct through the action of a \"_vis essentialis corporis_.\"\r\n\r\nHe returned to the problem of development later, and, in 1768-1769,\r\npublished his best work in this field on the development of the\r\nintestine.[5] This is a very original and strong piece of observational\r\nwork. While his investigations for the _Theoria Generationis_ did not\r\nreach the level of Malpighi's, those of the paper of 1768 surpassed\r\nthem and held the position of the best piece of embryological work up\r\nto that of Pander and Von Baer. This work was so highly appreciated by\r\nVon Baer that he said: \"It is the greatest masterpiece of scientific\r\nobservation which we possess.\" In it he clearly demonstrated that the\r\ndevelopment of the intestine and its appendages is a true process\r\nof becoming. Still later, in 1789, he published further theoretical\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nOpposition to Wolff's Views.--But all Wolff's work was launched into an\r\nuncongenial atmosphere. The great physiologist Haller could not accept\r\nthe idea of epigenesis, but opposed it energetically, and so great\r\nwas his authority that the views of Wolff gained no currency. This\r\nretarded progress in the science of animal development for more than a\r\nhalf-century.\r\n\r\nBonnet was also a prolific writer in opposition to the ideas of Wolff,\r\nand we should perhaps have a portrait of him (Fig. 64) as one of\r\nthe philosophical naturalists of the time. His prominent connection\r\nwith the theory of pre-delineation in its less grotesque form, his\r\ndiscovery of the development of the eggs of plant-lice without previous\r\nfertilization, his researches on regeneration of parts in polyps\r\nand worms, and other observations place him among the conspicuous\r\nnaturalists of the period. His system of philosophy, which has been\r\ncarefully analyzed by Whitman, is designated by that writer as a system\r\nof negations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64.--Charles Bonnet, 1720-1793.]\r\n\r\nIn 1821, J. Fr. Meckel, recognizing the great value of Wolff's\r\nresearches on the development of the intestines, rescued the work from\r\nneglect and obscurity by publishing a German translation of the same,\r\nand bringing it to the attention of scholars. From that time onward\r\nWolff's labor was fruitful.\r\n\r\nHis _De Formatione Intestinorum_ rather than his _Theoria Generationis_\r\nembodies his greatest contribution to embryology. Not only is it a\r\nmore fitting model of observation, but in it he foreshadows the idea\r\nof germ-layers in the embryo, which, under Pander and Von Baer, became\r\nthe fundamental conception in structural embryology. Throughout his\r\nresearches both early and late, he likens the embryonic rudiments,\r\nwhich precede the formation of organs, to leaflets. In his work of\r\n1768 he described in detail how the leaf-like layers give rise to the\r\nsystems of organs; showing that the nervous system arises first from a\r\nleaf-like layer, and is followed, successively, by a flesh layer, the\r\nvascular system, and lastly, by the intestinal canal--all arising from\r\noriginal leaf-like layers.\r\n\r\nIn these important generalizations, although they are verbally\r\nincorrect, he reached the truth as nearly as it was possible at the\r\ntime, and laid the foundation of the germ-layer theory.\r\n\r\nWolff was a man of great power as an observer, and although his\r\ninfluence was for a long time retarded, he should be recognized as the\r\nforemost investigator in embryology before Von Baer.\r\n\r\nFew Biographical Facts.--The little known of his life is gained through\r\nhis correspondence and a letter by his amanuensis. Through personal\r\nneglect, and hostility to his work, he could not secure a foothold\r\nin the universities of Germany, and, in 1764, on the invitation\r\nof Catherine of Russia, he went to the Academy of Sciences at St.\r\nPetersburg, where he spent the last thirty years of his life.\r\n\r\nIt has been impossible to discover a portrait of Wolff, although I have\r\nsought one in various ways for several years. The secretary of the\r\nAcademy of Sciences at St. Petersburg writes that no portrait of Wolff\r\nexists there, and that the Academy will gratefully receive information\r\nfrom any source regarding the existence of a portrait of the great\r\nacademician.\r\n\r\nHis sincere and generous spirit is shown in his correspondence with\r\nHaller, his great opponent. \"And as to the matter of contention between\r\nus, I think thus: For me, no more than for you, glorious man, is truth\r\nof the very greatest concern. Whether it chance that organic bodies\r\nemerge from an invisible into a visible condition, or form themselves\r\nout of the air, there is no reason why I should wish the one were truer\r\nthan the other, or wish the one and not the other. And this is your\r\nview also, glorious man. We are investigating for truth only; we seek\r\nthat which is true. Why then should I contend with you?\" (Quoted from\r\nWheeler.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Period of Von Baer\r\n\r\nWhat Johannes Müller was for physiology, von Baer was for embryology;\r\nall subsequent growth was influenced by his investigations.\r\n\r\nThe greatest classic in embryology is his _Development of Animals_\r\n(_Entwicklungsgeschichte der Tiere--Beobachtung und Reflexion_), the\r\nfirst part of which was published in 1828, and the work on the second\r\npart completed in 1834, although it was not published till 1837. This\r\nsecond part was never finished according to the plan of Von Baer, but\r\nwas issued by his publisher, after vainly waiting for the finished\r\nmanuscript. The final portion, which Von Baer had withheld, in order to\r\nperfect in some particulars, was published in 1888, after his death,\r\nbut in the form in which he left it in 1834.\r\n\r\nThe observations for the first part began in 1819, after he had\r\nreceived a copy of Pander's researches, and covered a period of seven\r\nyears of close devotion to the subject; and the observations for the\r\nlast part were carried on at intervals for several years.\r\n\r\nIt is significant of the character of his _Reflexionen_ that, although\r\npublished before the announcement of the cell-theory, and before the\r\nacceptance of the doctrine of organic evolution, they have exerted a\r\nmolding influence upon embryology to the present time. The position of\r\nvon Baer in embryology is owing as much to his sagacity in speculation\r\nas to his powers as an observer. \"Never again have observation and\r\nthought been so successfully combined in embryological work\" (Minot).\r\n\r\nVon Baer was born in 1792, and lived on to 1876, but his enduring fame\r\nin embryology rests on work completed more than forty years before\r\nthe end of his useful life. After his removal from Königsberg to St.\r\nPetersburg, in 1834, he very largely devoted himself to anthropology in\r\nits widest sense, and thereby extended his scientific reputation into\r\nother fields.\r\n\r\nIf space permitted, it would be interesting to give the biography[6]\r\nof this extraordinary man, but here it will be necessary to content\r\nourselves with an examination of his portraits and a brief account of\r\nhis work.\r\n\r\nPortraits.--Several portraits of von Baer showing him at different\r\nperiods of his life have been published. A very attractive one, taken\r\nin his early manhood, appeared in _Harper's Magazine_ for 1898. The\r\nexpression of the face is poetical, and the picture is interesting\r\nto compare with the more matured, sage-like countenance forming\r\nthe frontispiece of Stieda's _Life of Von Baer_ (see Fig. 65).\r\nThis, perhaps the best of all his portraits, shows him in the full\r\ndevelopment of his powers. An examination of it impresses one with\r\nconfidence in his balanced judgment and the thoroughness and profundity\r\nof his mental operations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65.--Karl Ernst von Baer, 1792-1876.]\r\n\r\nThe portrait of Von Baer at about seventy years of age, reproduced in\r\nFig. 66, is, however, destined to be the one by which he is commonly\r\nknown to embryologists, since it forms the frontispiece of the\r\ngreat cooperative _Handbook of Embryology_ just published under the\r\neditorship of Oskar Hertwig.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66.--Von Baer at about Seventy Years of Age.]\r\n\r\nVon Baer's Especial Service.--Apart from special discoveries, Von Baer\r\ngreatly enriched embryology in three directions: In the first place, he\r\nset a higher standard for all work in embryology, and thereby lifted\r\nthe entire science to a higher level. Activity in a great field of this\r\nkind is, with the rank and file of workers, so largely imitative that\r\nthis feature of his influence should not be overlooked. In the second\r\nplace, he established the germ-layer theory, and, in the third, he made\r\nembryology comparative.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the germ-layer theory, it should be recalled that\r\nWolff had distinctly foreshadowed the idea by showing that the\r\nmaterial out of which the embryo is constructed is, in an early stage\r\nof development, arranged in the form of leaf-like layers. He showed\r\nspecifically that the alimentary canal is produced by one of these\r\nsheet-like expansions folding and rolling together.\r\n\r\nPander, by observations on the chick (1817), had extended the knowledge\r\nof these layers and elaborated the conception of Wolff. He recognized\r\nthe presence of three primary layers--an outer, a middle, and an\r\ninner--out of which the tissues of the body are formed.\r\n\r\nThe Germ-Layers.--But it remained for Von Baer,[7] by extending his\r\nobservations into all the principal groups of animals, to raise this\r\nconception to the rank of a general law of development. He was able to\r\nshow that in all animals except the very lowest there arise in the\r\ncourse of development leaf-like layers, which become converted into the\r\n\"fundamental organs\" of the body.\r\n\r\nNow, these elementary layers are not definitive tissues of the body,\r\nbut are embryonic, and therefore may appropriately be designated\r\n\"germ-layers.\" The conception that these germ-layers are essentially\r\nsimilar in origin and fate in all animals was a fuller and later\r\ndevelopment of the germ-layer theory, a conception which dominated\r\nembryological study until a recent date.\r\n\r\nVon Baer recognized four such layers; the outer and inner ones being\r\nformed first, and subsequently budding off a middle layer composed of\r\ntwo sheets. A little later (1845) Remak recognized the double middle\r\nlayer of Von Baer as a unit, and thus arrived at the fundamental\r\nconception of three layers--the ecto-, endo-, and mesoderm--which\r\nhas so long held sway. For a long time after Von Baer the aim of\r\nembryologists was to trace the history of these germ-layers, and so in\r\na wider and much qualified sense it is to-day.\r\n\r\nIt will ever stand to his credit, as a great achievement, that Von\r\nBaer was able to make a very complicated feature of development clear\r\nand relatively simple. Given a leaf-like rudiment, with the layers\r\nheld out by the yolk, as is the case in the hen's egg, it was no easy\r\nmatter to conceive how they are transformed into the nervous system,\r\nthe body-wall, the alimentary canal, and other parts, but Von Baer saw\r\ndeeply and clearly that the fundamental anatomical features of the body\r\nare assumed by the leaf-like rudiments being rolled into tubes.\r\n\r\nFig. 67 shows four sketches taken from the plates illustrating von\r\nBaer's work. At _A_ is shown a stage in the formation of the embryonic\r\nenvelope, or amnion, which surrounds the embryos of all animals above\r\nthe class of amphibia. _B_, another figure of an ideal section, shows\r\nthat, long before the day of microtomes, Von Baer made use of sections\r\nto represent the relationships of his four germ-layers. At _C_ and\r\n_D_ is represented diagrammatically the way in which these layers are\r\nrolled into tubes. He showed that the central nervous system arose in\r\nthe form of a tube, from the outer layer; the body-wall in the form of\r\na tube, composed of skin and muscle layers; and the alimentary tube\r\nfrom mucous and vascular layers.\r\n\r\nThe generalization that embryos in development tend to recapitulate\r\ntheir ancestral history is frequently attributed to Von Baer, but the\r\nqualified way in which he suggests something of the sort will not\r\njustify one in attaching this conclusion to his work.\r\n\r\nVon Baer was the first to make embryology truly comparative, and to\r\npoint out its great value in anatomy and zoölogy. By embryological\r\nstudies he recognized four types of organization--as Cuvier had done\r\nfrom the standpoint of comparative anatomy. But, since these types of\r\norganization have been greatly changed and subdivided, the importance\r\nof the distinction has faded away. As a distinct break, however, with\r\nthe old idea of a linear scale of being it was of moment.\r\n\r\nAmong his especially noteworthy discoveries may be mentioned that\r\nof the egg of mammals (1827), and the notochord as occurring in all\r\nvertebrate animals. His discovery of the mammalian egg had been\r\npreceded by Purkinje's observations upon the germinative spot in the\r\nbird's egg (1825).\r\n\r\nVon Baer's Rank.--Von Baer has come to be dignified with the title of\r\nthe \"father of modern embryology.\" No man could have done more in his\r\nperiod, and it is owing to his superb intellect, and to his talents\r\nas an observer, that he accomplished what he did. As Minot says: \"He\r\nworked out, almost as fully as was possible at this time, the genesis\r\nof all the principal organs from the germ-layers, instinctively getting\r\nat the truth as only a great genius could have done.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67.--Sketches from Von Baer's Embryological\r\nTreatise (1828).]\r\n\r\nAfter his masterly work, the science of embryology could never return\r\nto its former level; he had given it a new direction, and through his\r\ninfluence a period of great activity was introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Period from Von Baer to Balfour\r\n\r\nIn the period between Von Baer and Balfour there were great general\r\nadvances in the knowledge of organic structure that brought the whole\r\nprocess of development into a new light.\r\n\r\nAmong the most important advances are to be enumerated the announcement\r\nof the cell-theory, the discovery of protoplasm, the beginning of\r\nthe recognition of germinal continuity, and the establishment of the\r\ndoctrine of organic evolution.\r\n\r\nThe Cell-Theory.--The generalization that the tissues of all animals\r\nand plants are structurally composed of similar units, called cells,\r\nwas given to the world through the combined labors of Schleiden and\r\nSchwann. The history of this doctrine, together with an account of its\r\nbeing remodeled into the protoplasm doctrine, is given in Chapter XII.\r\n\r\nThe broad-reaching effects of the cell-theory may be easily imagined,\r\nsince it united all animals on the broad place of likeness in\r\nmicroscopic structure. Now for the first time the tissues of the body\r\nwere analyzed into their units; now for the first time was comprehended\r\nthe nature of the germ-layers of Von Baer.\r\n\r\nAmong the first questions to emerge in the light of the new researches\r\nwere concerning the origin of cells in the organs, the tissues, and\r\nthe germ-layers. The road to the investigation of these questions was\r\nalready opened, and it was followed, step by step, until the egg and\r\nthe sperm came to be recognized as modified cells. This position was\r\nreached, for the egg, about 1861, when Gegenbaur showed that the eggs\r\nof all vertebrate animals, regardless of size and condition, are in\r\nreality single cells. The sperm was put in the same category about 1865.\r\n\r\nThe rest was relatively easy: the egg, a single cell, by successive\r\ndivisions produces many cells, and the arrangement of these into\r\nprimary embryonic layers brings us to the starting-point of Wolff and\r\nVon Baer. The cells, continuing to multiply by division, not only\r\nincrease in number, but also undergo changes through division of\r\nphysiological labor, whereby certain groups are set apart to perform a\r\nparticular part of the work of the body. In this way arise the various\r\ntissues of the body, which are, in reality, similar cells performing a\r\nsimilar function. Finally, from combinations of tissues, the organs are\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nBut the egg, before entering on the process of development, must be\r\nstimulated by the union of the sperm with the nucleus of the egg, and\r\nthus the starting-point of every animal and plant, above the lowest\r\ngroup, proves to be a single cell with protoplasm derived from two\r\nparents. While questions regarding the origin of cells in the body were\r\nbeing answered, the foundation for the embryological study of heredity\r\nwas also laid.\r\n\r\nAdvances were now more rapid and more sure; flashes of morphological\r\ninsight began to illuminate the way, and the facts of isolated\r\nobservations began to fit into a harmonized whole.\r\n\r\nApart from the general advances of this period, mentioned in other\r\nconnections, the work of a few individuals requires notice.\r\n\r\nRathke and Remak were engaged with the broader aspects of embryology,\r\nas well as with special investigations. From Rathke's researches came\r\ngreat advances in the knowledge of the development of insects and\r\nother invertebrates, and Remak is notable for similar work with the\r\nvertebrates. As already mentioned, he was the first to recognize the\r\nmiddle layer as a unit, through which the three germ-layers of later\r\nembryologists emerged into the literature of the subject.\r\n\r\nKoelliker, 1817-1905, the veteran embryologist, for so many years a\r\nprofessor in the University of Würzburg, carried on investigations on\r\nthe segmentation of the egg. Besides work on the invertebrates, later\r\nhe followed with care the development of the chick and the rabbit; he\r\nencompassed the whole field of embryology, and published, in 1861 and\r\nagain in 1876, a general treatise on vertebrate embryology, of high\r\nmerit. The portrait of this distinguished man is shown in Chapter VIII,\r\nwhere also his services as a histologist are recorded.\r\n\r\nHuxley took a great step toward unifying the idea of germ-layers\r\nthroughout the animal kingdom, when he maintained, in 1849, that\r\nthe two cell-layers in animals like the hydra and oceanic hydrozoa\r\ncorrespond to the ectoderm and endoderm of higher animals.\r\n\r\nKowalevsky (Fig. 68) made interesting discoveries of a general\r\nbearing. In 1866 he showed the practical identity, in the early stages\r\nof development, between one of the lowest vertebrates (amphioxus)\r\nand a tunicate. The latter up to that time had been considered an\r\ninvertebrate, and the effect of Kowalevsky's observations was to\r\nbreak down the sharply limited line supposed to exist between the\r\ninvertebrates and the vertebrates. This was of great influence in\r\nsubsequent work. Kowalevsky also founded the generalization that all\r\nanimals in development pass through a gastrula stage--a doctrine\r\nassociated, since 1874, with the name of Haeckel under the title of the\r\ngastræa theory.\r\n\r\nBeginning of the Doctrine of Germinal Continuity.--The conception\r\nthat there is unbroken continuity of germinal substance between all\r\nliving organisms, and that the egg and the sperm are endowed with\r\nan inherited organization of great complexity, has become the basis\r\nfor all current theories of heredity and development. So much is\r\ninvolved in this conception that, in the present decade, it has been\r\ndesignated (Whitman) \"the central fact of modern biology.\" The first\r\nclear expression of it is found in Virchow's _Cellular Pathology_,\r\npublished in 1858. It was not, however, until the period of Balfour,\r\nand through the work of Fol, Van Beneden (chromosomes, 1883), Boveri,\r\nHertwig, and others, that the great importance of this conception began\r\nto be appreciated, and came to be woven into the fundamental ideas of\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68.--A. Kowalevsky, 1840-1901.]\r\n\r\nInfluence of the Doctrine of Organic Evolution.--This doctrine,\r\nalthough founded in its modern sense by Lamarck in the early part of\r\nthe nineteenth century, lay dormant until Darwin, in 1859, brought a\r\nnew feature into its discussion by emphasizing the factor of natural\r\nselection. The general acceptance of the doctrine, which followed after\r\nfierce opposition, had, of course, a profound influence on embryology.\r\nThe latter science is so intimately concerned with the genealogy of\r\nanimals and plants, that the newly accepted doctrine, as affording an\r\nexplanation of this genealogy, was the thing most needed.\r\n\r\nThe development of organisms was now seen in the light of ancestral\r\nhistory, rudimentary organs began to have meaning as hereditary\r\nsurvivals, and the whole process of development assumed a different\r\naspect. This doctrine supplied a new impulse to the interpretation\r\nof nature at large, and of the embryological record in particular.\r\nThe meaning of the embryological record was so greatly emphasized in\r\nthe period of Balfour that it will be commented upon under the next\r\ndivision of our subject.\r\n\r\nThe period between Von Baer and Balfour proved to be one of great\r\nimportance on account of the general advances in knowledge of all\r\norganic nature. Observations were moving toward a better and more\r\nconsistent conception of the structure of animals and plants. A new\r\ncomparative anatomy, more profound and richer in meaning than Cuvier's,\r\nwas arising. The edifice on the foundation of Von Baer's work was now\r\nemerging into recognizable outlines.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Period of Balfour, with an Indication of Present Tendencies\r\n\r\nBalfour's Masterly Work.--The workers of this period inherited all\r\nthe accumulations of previous efforts, and the time was ripe for\r\na new step. Observations on the development of different animals,\r\nvertebrates and invertebrates, had accumulated in great number, but\r\nthey were scattered through technical periodicals, transactions of\r\nlearned societies, monographs, etc., and there was no compact science\r\nof embryology with definite outlines. Balfour reviewed all this mass\r\nof information, digested it, and molded it into an organized whole.\r\nThe results were published in the form of two volumes with the title\r\nof _Comparative Embryology_. This book of \"almost priceless value\" was\r\ngiven to the world in 1880-1881. It was a colossal undertaking, but\r\nBalfour was a phenomenal worker. Before his untimely death at the age\r\nof thirty-one, he had been able to complete this work and to produce,\r\nbesides, a large number of technical researches. The period of Balfour\r\nis taken arbitrarily in this volume as beginning about 1874, when he\r\npublished, with Michael Foster, _The Elements of Embryology_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69.--Francis M. Balfour, 1851-1882.]\r\n\r\nHis University Career.--Balfour (Fig. 69) was born in 1851. During\r\nhis days of preparation for the university he was a good student,\r\nbut did not exhibit in any marked way the powers for which later he\r\nbecame distinguished. At Cambridge, his distinguished teacher, the\r\nlate Sir Michael Foster, recognized his great talents, and encouraged\r\nhim to begin work in embryology. His labors in this field once begun,\r\nhe threw himself into it with great intensity. He rose rapidly to\r\na professorship in Cambridge, and so great was his enthusiasm and\r\nearnestness as a lecturer that in seven years \"voluntary attendance\r\non his classes advanced from ten to ninety.\" He was also a stimulator\r\nof research, and at the time of his death there were twenty students\r\nengaged in his laboratory on problems of development.\r\n\r\nHe was distinguished for personal attractiveness, and those who met him\r\nwere impressed with his great sincerity, as well as his personal charm.\r\nHe was welcomed as an addition to the select group of distinguished\r\nscientific men of England, and a great career was predicted for him.\r\nHuxley, when he felt the call, at a great personal sacrifice, to lay\r\naside the more rigorous pursuits of scientific research, and to devote\r\nhimself to molding science into the lives of the people, said of\r\nBalfour: \"He is the only man who can carry out my work.\"\r\n\r\nHis Tragic Fate.--But that was not destined to be. The story of his\r\ntragic end need be only referred to. After completing the prodigious\r\nlabor on the _Comparative Embryology_ he went to Switzerland for\r\nrecuperation, and met his death, with that of his guide, by slipping\r\nfrom an Alpine height into a chasm. His death occurred in July, 1882.\r\n\r\nThe memorial edition of his works fills four quarto volumes, but the\r\n\"Comparative Embryology\" is Balfour's monument, and will give him\r\nenduring fame. It is not only a digest of the work of others, but\r\ncontains also general considerations of a far-seeing quality. He saw\r\ndevelopmental processes in the light of the hypothesis of organic\r\nevolution. His speculations were sufficiently reserved, and nearly\r\nalways luminous. It is significant of the character of this work to\r\nsay that the speculations contained in the papers of the rank and file\r\nof embryological workers for more than two decades, and often fondly\r\nbelieved to be novel, were for the most part anticipated by Balfour,\r\nand were also better expressed, with better qualifications.\r\n\r\nThe reading of ancestral history in the stages of development is such\r\na characteristic feature of the embryological work of Balfour's period\r\nthat some observations concerning it will now be in place.\r\n\r\nInterpretation of the Embryological Record.--Perhaps the most\r\nimpressive feature of animal development is the series of similar\r\nchanges through which all pass in the embryo. The higher animals,\r\nespecially, exhibit all stages of organization from the unicellular\r\nfertilized ovum to the fully formed animal so far removed from it.\r\nThe intermediate changes constitute a long record, the possibility of\r\ninterpreting which has been a stimulus to its careful examination.\r\n\r\nMeckel, in 1821, and later Von Baer, indicated the close similarity\r\nbetween embryonic stages of widely different animals; Von Baer, indeed,\r\nconfessed that he was unable to distinguish positively between a\r\nreptile, a bird, and a mammalian embryo in certain early stages of\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this similarity, which is a constant feature of the\r\nembryological record, there is another one that may be equally\r\nsignificant; _viz._, in the course of embryonic history, sets of\r\nrudimentary organs arise and disappear. Rudimentary teeth make\r\ntheir appearance in the embryo of the whalebone whale, but they are\r\ntransitory and soon disappear without having been of service to the\r\nanimal. In the embryos of all higher vertebrates, as is well known,\r\ngill-clefts and gill-arches with an appropriate circulation, make their\r\nappearance, but disappear long before birth. These indications, and\r\nsimilar ones, must have some meaning.\r\n\r\nNow whatever qualities an animal exhibits after birth are attributed\r\nto heredity. May it not be that all the intermediate stages are also\r\ninheritances, and, therefore, represent phases in ancestral history? If\r\nthey be, indeed, clues to ancestral conditions, may we not, by patching\r\ntogether our observations, be able to interpret the record, just as\r\nthe history of ancient peoples has been made out from fragments in the\r\nshape of coins, vases, implements, hieroglyphics, inscriptions, etc.?\r\n\r\nThe Recapitulation Theory.--The results of reflection in this direction\r\nled to the foundation of the _recapitulation theory_, according to\r\nwhich animals are supposed, in their individual development, to\r\nrecapitulate to a considerable degree phases of their ancestral\r\nhistory. This is one of the widest generalizations of embryology.\r\nIt was suggested in the writings of Von Baer and Louis Agassiz, but\r\nreceived its first clear and complete expression in 1863, in the\r\nwritings of Fritz Müller.\r\n\r\nAlthough the course of events in development is a record, it is, at\r\nbest, only a fragmentary and imperfect one. Many stages have been\r\ndropped out, others are unduly prolonged or abbreviated, or appear out\r\nof chronological order, and, besides this, some of the structures have\r\narisen from adaptation of a particular organism to its conditions of\r\ndevelopment, and are, therefore, not ancestral at all, but, as it were,\r\nrecent additions to the text. The interpretation becomes a difficult\r\ntask, which requires much balance of judgment and profound analysis.\r\n\r\nThe recapitulation theory was a dominant note in all Balfour's\r\nspeculations, and in that of his contemporary and fellow-student\r\nMarshall. It has received its most sweeping application in the works of\r\nErnst Haeckel.\r\n\r\nWidely spread throughout recent literature is to be noted a reaction\r\nagainst the too wide and unreserved application of this doctrine.\r\nThis is naturally to be expected, since it is the common tendency\r\nin all fields of scholarship to demand a more critical estimate of\r\nresults, and to undergo a reaction from the earlier crude and sweeping\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70.--Oskar Hertwig in 1890.]\r\n\r\nNearly all problems in anatomy and structural zoölogy are approached\r\nfrom the embryological side, and, as a consequence, the work of\r\nthe great army of anatomists and zoölogists has been in a measure\r\nembryological. Many of them have produced beautiful and important\r\nresearches, but the work is too extended to admit of review in this\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nOskar Hertwig, of Berlin (Fig. 70), is one of the representative\r\nembryologists of Europe, while, in this country, lights of the first\r\nmagnitude are Brooks, Minot, Whitman, E.B. Wilson, and others.\r\n\r\nAlthough no attempt is made to review the researches of the recent\r\nperiod, we cannot pass entirely without mention the discovery of\r\nchromosomes, and of their reduction in the ripening of the egg\r\nand in the formation of sperm. This has thrown a flood of light\r\non the phenomena of fertilization, and has led to the recognition\r\nof chromosomes as probably the bearers of heredity. The nature of\r\nfertilization, investigated by Fol, O. Hertwig, and others, formed the\r\nstarting-point for a series of brilliant discoveries.\r\n\r\nThe embryological investigations of the late Wilhelm His (Fig. 71)\r\nare also deserving of especial notice. His luminous researches on the\r\ndevelopment of the nervous system, the origin of nerve fibers, and his\r\nanalysis of the development of the human embryo are all very important.\r\n\r\nRecent Tendencies. Experimental Embryology.--Soon after the publication\r\nof Balfour's great work on \"Comparative Embryology,\" a new tendency\r\nin research began to appear which led onward to the establishment of\r\nexperimental embryology. All previous work in this field had been\r\nconcerned with the structure, or architecture, of organisms, but now\r\nthe physiological side began to receive attention. Whitman has stated\r\nwith great aptness the interdependence of these two lines of work,\r\nas follows: \"Morphology raises the question, How came the organic\r\nmechanism into existence? Has it had a history, reaching its present\r\nstage of perfection through a long series of gradations, the first\r\nterm of which was a relatively simple stage? The embryological history\r\nis traced out, and the palæontological records are searched, until\r\nthe evidence from both sources establishes the fact that the organ\r\nor organism under study is but the summation of modifications and\r\nelaborations of a relatively simple primordial. This point settled,\r\nphysiology is called upon to complete the story. Have the functions\r\nremained the same through the series? or have they undergone a series\r\nof modifications, differentiations, and improvements more or less\r\nparallel with the morphological series?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71.--Wilhelm His, 1831-1904. At Sixty-four Years.]\r\n\r\nSince physiology is an experimental science, all questions of this\r\nnature must be investigated with the help of experiments. Organisms\r\nundergoing development have been subjected to changed conditions, and\r\ntheir responses to various forms of stimuli have been noted. In the\r\nrise of experimental embryology we have one of the most promising\r\nof the recent departures from the older aspects of the subject. The\r\nresults already attained in this attractive and suggestive field\r\nmake too long a story to justify its telling in this volume. Roux,\r\nHerbst, Loeb, Morgan, E.B. Wilson, and many others have contributed\r\nto the growth of this new division of embryology. Good reasons have\r\nbeen adduced for believing that qualitative changes take place in\r\nthe protoplasm as development proceeds. And a curb has been put upon\r\nthat \"great fault of embryology, the tendency to explain any and\r\nevery operation of development as merely the result of inheritance.\"\r\nIt has been demonstrated that surrounding conditions have much to do\r\nwith individual development, and that the course of events may depend\r\nlargely upon stimuli coming from without, and not exclusively on an\r\ninherited tendency.\r\n\r\nCell-Lineage.--Investigations on the structural side have reached a\r\nhigh grade of perfection in studies on cell-lineage. The theoretical\r\nconclusions in the germ-layer theory are based upon the assumption\r\nof identity in origin of the different layers. But the lack of\r\nagreement among observers, especially in reference to the origin\r\nof the mesoderm, made it necessary to study more closely the early\r\ndevelopmental stages before the establishment of the germ-layers. It\r\nis a great triumph of exact observation that, although continually\r\nchanging, the consecutive history of the individual cells has been\r\nfollowed from the beginning of segmentation to the time when the\r\ngerm-layers are established. Some of the beautifully illustrated\r\nmemoirs in this field are highly artistic.\r\n\r\nBlochman (1882) was a pioneer in observations of this kind, and,\r\nfollowing him, a number of American investigators have pursued studies\r\non cell-lineage with great success. The researches of Whitman, Wilson,\r\nConklin, Kofoid, Lillie, Mead, and Castle have given us the history of\r\nthe origin of the germ-layers, cell by cell, in a variety of animal\r\nforms. These studies have shown that there is a lack of uniformity in\r\nthe origin of at least the middle layer, and therefore there can be no\r\nstrict homology of its derivatives. This makes it apparent that the\r\nearlier generalizations of the germ-layer theory were too sweeping,\r\nand, as a result, the theory is retained in a much modified form.\r\n\r\nTheoretical Discussions.--Certain theoretical discussions, based on\r\nembryological studies, have been rife in recent years. And it is to\r\nbe recognized without question that discussions regarding heredity,\r\nregeneration, the nature of the developmental process, the question of\r\ninherited organization within the egg, of germinal continuity, etc.,\r\nhave done much to advance the subject of embryology.\r\n\r\nEmbryology is one of the three great departments of biology which,\r\ntaken in combination, supply us with a knowledge of living forms along\r\nlines of structure, function, and development. The embryological\r\nmethod of study is of increasing importance to comparative anatomy\r\nand physiology. Formerly it was entirely structural, but it is now\r\nbecoming also experimental, and it will therefore be of more service\r\nto physiology. While it has a strictly technical side, the science\r\nof embryology must always remain of interest to intelligent people\r\nas embracing one of the most wonderful processes in nature--the\r\ndevelopment of a complex organism from the single-celled condition,\r\nwith a panoramic representation of all the intermediate stages.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: As Whitman has pointed out, Aristotle taught epigenesis as\r\nclearly as Harvey, and is, therefore, to be regarded as the founder of\r\nthat conception.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The discovery is also attributed to Hamm, a medical\r\nstudent, and to Hartsoeker, who claimed priority in the discovery.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _De Formatione Intestinorum, Nova Commentar, Ac. Sci.\r\nPetrop._, St. Petersburg, XII., 1768; XIII., 1769.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Besides biographical sketches by Stieda, Waldeyer,\r\nand others, we have a very entertaining autobiography of Von Baer,\r\npublished in 1864, for private circulation, but afterward (1866)\r\nreprinted and placed on sale.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: It is of more than passing interest to remember that\r\nPander and Von Baer were associated as friends and fellow-students,\r\nunder Döllinger at Würzburg. It was partly through the influence\r\nof Von Baer that Pander came to study with Döllinger, and took up\r\ninvestigations on development. His ample private means made it possible\r\nfor him to bear the expenses connected with the investigation, and to\r\nsecure the services of a fine artist for making the illustrations. The\r\nresult was a magnificently illustrated treatise. His unillustrated\r\nthesis in Latin (1817) is more commonly known, but the illustrated\r\ntreatise in German is rarer. Von Baer did not take up his researches\r\nseriously until Pander's were published. It is significant of their\r\ncontinued harmonious relations that Von Baer's work is dedicated \"An\r\nmeinen Jugendfreund, Dr. Christian Pander.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE CELL THEORY--SCHLEIDEN, SCHWANN, SCHULTZE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recognition, in 1838, of the fact that all the various tissues\r\nof animals and plants are constructed on a similar plan was an\r\nimportant step in the rise of biology. It was progress along the line\r\nof microscopical observation. One can readily understand that the\r\nstructural analysis of organisms could not be completed until their\r\nelementary parts had been discovered. When these units of structure\r\nwere discovered they were called cells--from a misconception of their\r\nnature--and, although the misconception has long since been corrected,\r\nthey still retain this historical but misleading name.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine that all tissues of animals and plants are composed of\r\naggregations of these units, and the derivatives from the same, is\r\nknown as the cell-theory. It is a generalization which unites all\r\nanimals and plants on the broad plane of similitude of structure, and,\r\nwhen we consider it in the light of its consequences, it stands out as\r\none of the great scientific achievements of the nineteenth century.\r\nThere is little danger of overestimating the importance of this\r\ndoctrine as tending to unify the knowledge of living organisms.\r\n\r\nVague Foreshadowings of the Cell-Theory.--In attempting to trace\r\nthe growth of this idea, as based on actual observations, we first\r\nencounter vague foreshadowings of it in the seventeenth and the\r\neighteenth centuries. The cells were seen and sketched by many early\r\nobservers, but were not understood.\r\n\r\nAs long ago as 1665 Robert Hooke, the great English microscopist,\r\nobserved the cellular construction of cork, and described it as made\r\nup of \"little boxes or cells distinguished from one another.\" He made\r\nsketches of the appearance of this plant tissue; and, inasmuch as the\r\ndrawings of Hooke are the earliest ones made of cells, they possess\r\nespecial interest and consequently are reproduced here. Fig. 72, taken\r\nfrom the _Micrographia_, shows this earliest drawing of Hooke. He made\r\nthin sections with a sharp penknife; \"and upon examination they were\r\nfound to be all cellular or porous in the manner of a honeycomb, but\r\nnot so regular.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72.--The Earliest Known Picture of Cells from\r\nHooke's _Micrographia_ (1665). From the edition of 1780.]\r\n\r\nWe must not completely overlook the fact that Aristotle (384-322\r\nB.C.) and Galen (130-200 A.D.), those profound thinkers on anatomical\r\nstructure, had reached the theoretical position \"that animals and\r\nplants, complex as they may appear, are yet composed of comparatively\r\nfew elementary parts, frequently repeated\"; but we are not especially\r\nconcerned with the remote history of the idea, so much as with the\r\nprincipal steps in its development after the beginning of microscopical\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73.--Sketch from Malpighi's Treatise on the Anatomy\r\nof Plants (1670).]\r\n\r\nPictures of Cells in the Seventeenth Century.--The sketches\r\nillustrating the microscopic observations of Malpighi, Leeuwenhoek,\r\nand Grew show so many pictures of the cellular construction of plants\r\nthat one who views them for the first time is struck with surprise, and\r\nmight readily exclaim: \"Here in the seventeenth century we have the\r\nfoundation of the cell-theory.\" But these drawings were merely faithful\r\nrepresentations of the appearance of the fabric of plants; the cells\r\nwere not thought of as uniform elements of organic architecture, and\r\nno theory resulted. It is true that Malpighi understood that the cells\r\nwere separable \"utricles,\" and that plant tissue was the result of\r\ntheir union, but this was only an initial step in the direction of the\r\ncell-theory, which, as we shall see later, was founded on the supposed\r\nidentity in development of cells in animals and plants. Fig. 73 shows\r\na sketch, made by Malpighi about 1670, illustrating the microscopic\r\nstructure of a plant. This is similar to the many drawings of Grew and\r\nLeeuwenhoek illustrating the structure of plant tissues.\r\n\r\nWolff.--Nearly a century after the work of Malpighi, we find Wolff,\r\nin 1759, proposing a theory regarding the organization of animals and\r\nplants based upon observations of their mode of development. He was one\r\nof the most acute scientific observers of the period, and it is to be\r\nnoted that his conclusions regarding structure were all founded upon\r\nwhat he was able to see; while he gives some theoretical conclusions of\r\na purely speculative nature, Wolff was careful to keep these separate\r\nfrom his observations. The purpose of his investigations was to show\r\nthat there was no pre-formation in the embryo; but in getting at\r\nthe basis of this question, he worked out the identity of structure\r\nof plants and animals as shown by their development. In his famous\r\npublication on the Theory of Development (_Theoria Generationis_) he\r\nused both plants and animals.\r\n\r\nHuxley epitomizes Wolff's views on the development of elementary\r\nparts as follows: \"Every organ, he says, is composed at first of a\r\nlittle mass of clear, viscous, nutritive fluid, which possesses no\r\norganization of any kind, but is at most composed of globules. In this\r\nsemifluid mass cavities (_Bläschen_, _Zellen_) are now developed;\r\nthese, if they remain round or polygonal, become the subsequent cells;\r\nif they elongate, the vessels; and the process is identically the\r\nsame, whether it is examined in the vegetating point of a plant, or in\r\nthe young budding organs of an animal.\"\r\n\r\nWolff was contending against the doctrine of pre-formation in the\r\nembryo (see further under the chapter on Embryology), but on account\r\nof his acute analysis he should be regarded, perhaps, as the chief\r\nforerunner of the founders of the cell-theory. He contended for the\r\nsame method of development that was afterward emphasized by Schleiden\r\nand Schwann. Through the opposition of the illustrious physiologist\r\nHaller his work remained unappreciated, and was finally forgotten,\r\nuntil it was revived again in 1812.\r\n\r\nWe can not show that Wolff's researches had any direct influence\r\nin leading Schleiden and Schwann to their announcement of the\r\ncell-theory. Nevertheless, it stands, intellectually, in the direct\r\nline of development of that idea, while the views of Haller upon the\r\nconstruction of organized beings are a side-issue. Haller declared\r\nthat \"the solid parts of animals and vegetables have this fabric in\r\ncommon, that their elements are either fibers or unorganized concrete.\"\r\nThis formed the basis of the fiber-theory, which, on account of the\r\ngreat authority of Haller in physiology, occupied in the accumulating\r\nwritings of anatomists a greater place than the views of Wolff.\r\n\r\nBichat, although he is recognized as the founder of histology, made\r\nno original observations on the microscopic units of the tissues. He\r\ndescribed very minutely the membranes in the bodies of animals, but did\r\nnot employ the microscope in his investigations.\r\n\r\nOken.--In the work of the dreamer Oken (1779-1851), the great\r\nrepresentative of the German school of \"_Naturphilosophie_,\" we find,\r\nabout 1808, a very noteworthy statement to the effect that \"animals and\r\nplants are throughout nothing else than manifoldly divided or repeated\r\nvesicles, as I shall prove anatomically at the proper time.\" This is\r\napparently a concise statement of the cell-idea prior to Schleiden and\r\nSchwann; but we know that it was not founded on observation. Oken, as\r\nwas his wont, gave rein to his imagination, and, on his part, the idea\r\nwas entirely theoretical, and amounted to nothing more than a lucky\r\nguess.\r\n\r\nHaller's fiber-theory gave place in the last part of the eighteenth\r\ncentury to the theory that animals and plants are composed of globules\r\nand formless material, and this globular theory was in force up to the\r\ntime of the great generalization of Schleiden and Schwann. It was well\r\nexpounded by Milne-Edwards in 1823, and now we can recognize that at\r\nleast some of the globules which he described were the nucleated cells\r\nof later writers.\r\n\r\nThe Announcement of the Cell-Theory.--We are now approaching the time\r\nwhen the cell-theory was to be launched. During the first third of\r\nthe nineteenth century there had accumulated a great mass of separate\r\nobservations on the microscopic structure of both animals and plants.\r\nFor several years botanists, in particular, had been observing and\r\nwriting about cells, and interest in these structures was increasing.\r\n\"We must clearly recognize the fact that for some time prior to 1838\r\nthe cell had come to be quite universally recognized as a constantly\r\nrecurring element in vegetable and animal tissues, though little\r\nimportance was attached to it as an element of organization, nor had\r\nits character been clearly determined\" (Tyson).\r\n\r\nThen, in 1838, came the \"master-stroke in generalization\" due to the\r\ncombined labors of two friends, Schleiden and Schwann. But, although\r\nthese two men are recognized as co-founders, they do not share honors\r\nequally; the work of Schwann was much more comprehensive, and it was he\r\nwho first used the term cell-theory, and entered upon the theoretical\r\nconsiderations which placed the theory before the scientific world.\r\n\r\nSchleiden was educated as a lawyer, and began the practice of that\r\nprofession, but his taste for natural science was so pronounced that\r\nwhen he was twenty-seven years old he deserted law, and went back to\r\nthe university to study medicine. After graduating in medicine, he\r\ndevoted himself mainly to botany. He saw clearly that the greatest\r\nthing needed for the advancement of scientific botany was a study of\r\nplant organization from the standpoint of development. Accordingly\r\nhe entered upon this work, and, in 1837, arrived at a new view\r\nregarding the origin of plant cells. It must be confessed that this\r\nnew view was founded on erroneous observations and conclusions, but\r\nit was revolutionary, and served to provoke discussion and to awaken\r\nobservation. This was a characteristic feature of Schleiden's influence\r\nupon botany. His work acted as a ferment in bringing about new activity.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the nucleus in plant cells by Robert Brown in 1831\r\nwas an important preliminary step to the work of Schleiden, since the\r\nlatter seized upon the nucleus as the starting-point of new cells. He\r\nchanged the name of the nucleus to cytoblast, and supposed that the new\r\ncell started as a small clear bubble on one side of the nucleus, and\r\nby continued expansion grew into the cell, the nucleus, or cytoblast,\r\nbecoming encased in the cell-wall. All this was shown by Nägeli and\r\nother botanists to be wrong; yet, curiously enough, it was through the\r\nhelp of these false observations that Schwann arrived at his general\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nSchleiden was acquainted with Schwann, and in October, 1838, while the\r\ntwo were dining together, he told Schwann about his observations and\r\ntheories. He mentioned in particular the nucleus and its relationship\r\nto the other parts of the cell. Schwann was immediately struck with the\r\nsimilarity between the observations of Schleiden and certain of his\r\nown upon _animal_ tissues. Together they went to his laboratory and\r\nexamined the sections of the dorsal cord, the particular structure upon\r\nwhich Schwann had been working. Schleiden at once recognized the nuclei\r\nin this structure as being similar to those which he had observed in\r\nplants, and thus aided Schwann to come to the conclusion that the\r\nelements in animal tissues were practically identical with those in\r\nplant tissues.\r\n\r\nSchwann.--The personalities of the co-founders of the cell-theory are\r\ninteresting. Schwann was a man of gentle, pacific disposition, who\r\navoided all controversies aroused by his many scientific discoveries.\r\nIn his portrait (Fig. 74) we see a man whose striking qualities are\r\ngood-will and benignity. His friend Henle gives this description of\r\nhim: \"He was a man of stature below the medium, with a beardless face,\r\nan almost infantile and always smiling expression, smooth, dark-brown\r\nhair, wearing a fur-trimmed dressing-gown, living in a poorly lighted\r\nroom on the second floor of a restaurant which was not even of the\r\nsecond class. He would pass whole days there without going out, with\r\na few rare books around him, and numerous glass vessels, retorts,\r\nvials, and tubes, simple apparatus which he made himself. Or I go in\r\nimagination to the dark and fusty halls of the Anatomical Institute\r\nwhere we used to work till nightfall by the side of our excellent\r\nchief, Johann Müller. We took our dinner in the evening, after the\r\nEnglish fashion, so that we might enjoy more of the advantages of\r\ndaylight.\"\r\n\r\nSchwann drew part of his stimulus from his great master, Johannes\r\nMüller. He was associated with him as a student, first in the\r\nUniversity of Würzburg, where Müller, with rare discernment for\r\nrecognizing genius, selected Schwann for especial favors and for close\r\npersonal friendship. The influence of his long association with Müller,\r\nthe greatest of all trainers of anatomists and physiologists of the\r\nnineteenth century, must have been very uplifting. A few years later,\r\nSchwann found himself at the University of Berlin, where Müller had\r\nbeen called, and he became an assistant in the master's laboratory.\r\nThere he gained the powerful stimulus of constant association with a\r\ngreat personality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74.--Theodor Schwann, 1810-1882.]\r\n\r\nIn 1839, just after the publication of his work on the cell-theory,\r\nSchwann was called to a professorship in the University of Louvain, and\r\nafter remaining there nine years, was transferred to the University of\r\nLiège. He was highly respected in the university, and led a useful\r\nlife, although after going to Belgium he published only one work--that\r\non the uses of the bile. He was recognized as an adept experimenter and\r\ndemonstrator, and \"clearness, order, and method\" are designated as the\r\ncharacteristic qualities of his teaching.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75.--M. Schleiden, 1804-1881.]\r\n\r\nHis announcement of the cell-theory was his most important work. Apart\r\nfrom that his best-known contributions to science are: experiments upon\r\nspontaneous generation, his discovery of the \"sheath of Schwann,\" in\r\nnerve fibers, and his theory of fermentation as produced by microbes.\r\n\r\nSchleiden.--Schleiden (Fig. 75) was quite different in temperament\r\nfrom Schwann. He did not have the fine self-control of Schwann, but\r\nwas quick to take up the gauntlet and enter upon controversies. In his\r\ncaustic replies to his critics, he indulged in sharp personalities,\r\nand one is at times inclined to suspect that his early experience as a\r\nlawyer had something to do with his method of handling opposition. With\r\nall this he had correct ideas of the object of scientific study and of\r\nthe methods to be used in its pursuit. He insisted upon observation\r\nand experiment, and upon the necessity of studying the development of\r\nplants in order to understand their anatomy and physiology. He speaks\r\nscornfully of the botany of mere species-making as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Most people of the world, even the most enlightened, are still in the\r\nhabit of regarding the botanist as a dealer in barbarous Latin names,\r\nas a man who gathers flowers, names them, dries them, and wraps them in\r\npaper, and all of whose wisdom consists in determining and classifying\r\nthis hay which he has collected with such great pains.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough he insisted on correct methods, his ardent nature led him to\r\nchampion conclusions of his own before they were thoroughly tested.\r\nHis great influence in the development of scientific botany lay in\r\nhis earnestness, his application of new methods, and his fearlessness\r\nin drawing conclusions, which, although frequently wrong, formed the\r\nstarting-point of new researches.\r\n\r\nLet us now examine the original publications upon which the cell-theory\r\nwas founded.\r\n\r\nSchleiden's Contribution.--Schleiden's paper was particularly directed\r\nto the question, How does the cell originate? and was published\r\nin Müller's _Archiv_, in 1838, under the German title of _Ueber\r\nPhytogenesis_. As stated above, the cell had been recognized for some\r\nyears, but the question of its origin had not been investigated.\r\nSchleiden says: \"I may omit all historical introduction, for, so far\r\nas I am acquainted, no direct observations exist at present upon the\r\ndevelopment of the cells of plants.\"\r\n\r\nHe then goes on to define his view of the nucleus (cytoblast) and\r\nof the development of the cell around it, saying: \"As soon as the\r\ncytoblasts have attained their full size, a delicate transparent\r\nvesicle arises upon their surface. This is the young cell.\" As to\r\nthe position of the nucleus in the fully developed cell, he is very\r\nexplicit: \"It is evident,\" he says, \"from the foregoing that the\r\ncytoblast can never lie free in the interior of the cell, but is always\r\nenclosed in the cell-wall,\" etc.\r\n\r\nSchleiden fastened these errors upon the cell-theory, since Schwann\r\nrelied upon his observations. On another point of prime importance\r\nSchleiden was wrong: he regarded all new cell-formation as the\r\nformation of \"cells within cells,\" as distinguished from cell-division,\r\nas we now know it to take place.\r\n\r\nSchleiden made no attempt to elaborate his views into a comprehensive\r\ncell-theory, and therefore his connection as a co-founder of this great\r\ngeneralization is chiefly in paving the way and giving the suggestion\r\nto Schwann, which enabled the latter to establish the theory.\r\nSchleiden's paper occupies some thirty-two pages, and is illustrated by\r\ntwo plates. He was thirty-four years old when this paper was published,\r\nand directly afterward was called to the post of adjunct professor of\r\nbotany in the University of Jena, a position which with promotion to\r\nthe full professorship he occupied for twenty-three years.\r\n\r\nSchwann's Treatise.--In 1838, Schwann also announced his cell-theory\r\nin a concise form in a German scientific periodical, and, later, to\r\nthe Paris Academy of Sciences; but it was not till 1839 that the fully\r\nillustrated account was published. This treatise with the cumbersome\r\ntitle, \"Microscopical Researches into the Accordance in the Structure\r\nand Growth of Animals and Plants\" (_Mikroscopische Untersuchungen über\r\ndie Uebereinstimmung in der Structur und dem Wachsthum der Thiere und\r\nPflanzen_) takes rank as one of the great classics in biology. It fills\r\n215 octavo pages, and is illustrated with four plates.\r\n\r\n\"The purpose of his researches was to prove the identity of structure,\r\nas shown by their development, between animals and plants.\" This is\r\ndone by direct comparisons of the elementary parts in the two kingdoms\r\nof organic nature.\r\n\r\nHis writing in the \"Microscopical Researches\" is clear and\r\nphilosophical, and is divided into three sections, in the first two of\r\nwhich he confines himself strictly to descriptions of observations, and\r\nin the third part of which he enters upon a philosophical discussion\r\nof the significance of the observations. He comes to the conclusion\r\nthat \"the elementary parts of all tissues are formed of cells in an\r\nanalogous, though very diversified manner, so that it may be asserted\r\nthat there is one universal principle of development for the elementary\r\nparts of organisms, however different, and that this principle is the\r\nformation of cells.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in this treatise also that he made use of the term cell-theory,\r\nas follows: \"The development of the proposition that there exists\r\none general principle for the formation of all organic productions,\r\nand that this principle is the formation of cells, as well as\r\nthe conclusions which may be drawn from this proposition, may be\r\ncomprised under the term _cell-theory_, using it in its more extended\r\nsignification, while, in a more limited sense, by the theory of cells\r\nwe understand whatever may be inferred from this proposition with\r\nrespect to the powers from which these phenomena result.\"\r\n\r\nOne comes from the reading of these two contributions to science with\r\nthe feeling that it is really Schwann's cell-theory, and that Schleiden\r\nhelped by lighting the way that his fellow-worker so successfully trod.\r\n\r\nModification of the Cell-Theory.--The form in which the cell-theory was\r\ngiven to the world by Schleiden and Schwann was very imperfect, and,\r\nas already pointed out, it contained fundamental errors. The founders\r\nof the theory attached too much importance to the cell-wall, and they\r\ndescribed the cell as a hollow cavity bounded by walls that were formed\r\naround a nucleus. They were wrong as to the mode of the development of\r\nthe cell, and as to its nature. Nevertheless, the great truth that all\r\nparts of animals and plants are built of similar units or structures\r\nwas well substantiated. This remained a permanent part of the theory,\r\nbut all ideas regarding the nature of the units were profoundly altered.\r\n\r\nIn order to perceive the line along which the chief modifications were\r\nmade we must take account of another scientific advance of about the\r\nsame period. This was the discovery of protoplasm, an achievement which\r\ntakes rank with the advances of greatest importance in biology, and has\r\nproved to be one of the great events of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe Discovery of Protoplasm and its Effect on the Cell-Theory.--In\r\n1835, before the announcement of the cell-theory, living matter\r\nhad been observed by Dujardin. In lower animal forms he noticed a\r\nsemifluid, jelly-like substance, which he designated sarcode, and which\r\nhe described as being endowed with all the qualities of life. The\r\nsame semifluid substance had previously caught the attention of some\r\nobservers, but no one had as yet announced it as the actual living part\r\nof organisms. Schleiden had seen it and called it gum. Dujardin was\r\nfar from appreciating the full importance of his discovery, and for a\r\nlong time his description of sarcode remained separate; but in 1846\r\nHugo von Mohl, a botanist, observed a similar jelly-like substance in\r\nplants, which he called plant _schleim_, and to which he attached the\r\nname protoplasma.\r\n\r\nThe scientific world was now in the position of recognizing living\r\nsubstance, which had been announced as sarcode in lower animals, and\r\nas protoplasm in plants; but there was as yet no clear indication that\r\nthese two substances were practically identical. Gradually there came\r\nstealing into the minds of observers the suspicion that the sarcode of\r\nthe zoölogists and the protoplasm of the botanists were one and the\r\nsame thing. This proposition was definitely maintained by Cohn in 1850,\r\nthough with him it was mainly theoretical, since his observations were\r\nnot sufficiently extensive and accurate to support such a conclusion.\r\n\r\nEleven years later, however, as the result of extended researches, Max\r\nSchultze promulgated, in 1861, the protoplasm doctrine, to the effect\r\nthat the units of organization consist of little masses of protoplasm\r\nsurrounding a nucleus, and that this protoplasm, or living substance,\r\nis practically identical in both plants and animals.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this conclusion upon the cell-theory was revolutionary.\r\nDuring the time protoplasm was being observed the cell had likewise\r\ncome under close scrutiny, and naturalists had now an extensive\r\ncollection of facts upon which to found a theory. It has been shown\r\nthat many animal cells have no cell-wall, and the final conclusion was\r\ninevitable that the essential part of a cell is the semifluid living\r\nsubstance that resides within the cavity when a cell-wall is present.\r\nMoreover, when the cell-wall is absent, the protoplasm is the \"cell.\"\r\nThe position of the nucleus was also determined to be within the living\r\nsubstance, and not, as Schleiden had maintained, within the cell-wall.\r\nThe definition of Max Schultze, that a cell is a globule of protoplasm\r\nsurrounding a nucleus, marks a new era in the cell-theory, in which\r\nthe original generalization became consolidated with the protoplasm\r\ndoctrine.\r\n\r\nFurther Modifications of the Cell-Theory.--The reformed cell-theory\r\nwas, however, destined to undergo further modification, and to become\r\ngreatly extended in its application. At first the cell was regarded\r\nmerely as an element of structure; then, as a supplement to this\r\nrestricted view, came the recognition that it is also a unit of\r\nphysiology, _viz._, that all physiological activities take place within\r\nthe cell. Matters did not come to a rest, however, with the recognition\r\nof these two fundamental aspects of the cell. The importance of the\r\ncell in development also took firmer hold upon the minds of anatomists\r\nafter it was made clear that both the egg and its fertilizing agents\r\nare modified cells of the parent's body. It was necessary to comprehend\r\nthis fact in order to get a clear idea of the origin of cells within\r\nthe body of a multicellular organism, and of the relation between the\r\nprimordial element and the fully developed tissues. Finally, when\r\nobservers found within the nucleus the bearers of hereditary qualities,\r\nthey began to realize that a careful study of the behavior of the cell\r\nelements during development is necessary for the investigation of\r\nhereditary transmissions.\r\n\r\nA statement of the cell-theory at the present time, then, must include\r\nthese four conceptions: the cell as a unit of structure, the cell as a\r\nunit of physiological activity, the cell as embracing all hereditary\r\nqualities within its substance, and the cell in the historical\r\ndevelopment of the organism.\r\n\r\nSome of these relations may now be more fully illustrated.\r\n\r\nOrigin of Tissues.--The egg in which all organisms above the very\r\nlowest begin, is a single cell having, under the microscope, the\r\nappearance shown in Fig. 76. After fertilization, this divides\r\nrepeatedly, and many cohering cells result. The cells are at first\r\nsimilar, but as they increase in number, and as development proceeds,\r\nthey grow different, and certain groups are set apart to perform\r\nparticular duties. The division of physiological labor which arises\r\nat this time marks the beginning of separate tissues. It has been\r\ndemonstrated over and over that all tissues are composed of cells and\r\ncell-products, though in some instances they are much modified. The\r\nliving cells can be seen even in bone and cartilage, in which they\r\nare separated by a lifeless matrix, the latter being the product of\r\ncellular activity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76.--The Egg and Early Stages in its Development.\r\n(After Gegenbaur.)]\r\n\r\nFig. 77 shows a stage in the development of one of the mollusks just as\r\nthe differentiation of cells has commenced.\r\n\r\nThe Nucleus.--To the earlier observers the protoplasm appeared to be\r\na structureless, jelly-like mass containing granules and vacuoles;\r\nbut closer acquaintance with it has shown that it is in reality very\r\ncomplex in structure as well as in chemical composition. It is by no\r\nmeans homogeneous; adjacent parts are different in properties and\r\naptitudes. The nucleus, which is more readily seen than other cell\r\nelements, was shown to be of great importance in cell-life--to be\r\na structure which takes the lead in cell division, and in general\r\ndominates the rest of the protoplasm.\r\n\r\nChromosomes.--After dyes came into use for staining the protoplasm\r\n(1868), it became evident that certain parts of it stain deeply, while\r\nother parts stain faintly or not at all. This led to the recognition of\r\nprotoplasm as made up of a densely staining portion called _chromatin_,\r\nand a faintly staining portion designated _achromatin_. This means\r\nof making different parts of protoplasm visible under the microscope\r\nled to important results, as when, in 1883, it was discovered that\r\nthe nucleus contains a definite number of small (usually rod-shaped)\r\nbodies, which become evident during nuclear division, and play a\r\nwonderful part in that process. These bodies take the stain more deeply\r\nthan other components of the nucleus, and are designated _chromosomes_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77.--An Early Stage in the Development of the Egg\r\nof a Rock-Limpet. (After Conklin.)]\r\n\r\nAttention having been directed to these little bodies, continued\r\nobservations showed that, although they vary in number--commonly from\r\ntwo to twenty-four--in different parts of animals and plants, they are,\r\nnevertheless, of the same number in all the cells of any particular\r\nplant or animal. As a conclusion to this kind of observation, it needs\r\nto be said that the chromosomes are regarded as the actual bearers of\r\nhereditary qualities. The chromosomes do not show in resting-stages of\r\nthe nucleus; their substance is present, but is not aggregated into the\r\nform of chromosomes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78.--Highly Magnified Tissue Cells from the Skin\r\nof a Salamander in an Active State of Growth. Dividing cells with\r\nchromosomes are shown at _a_, _b_, and _c_,. (After Wilson.)]\r\n\r\nFig. 78 shows tissue cells, some of which are in the dividing and\r\nothers in the resting-stage. The nuclei in process of division exhibit\r\nthe rod-like chromosomes, as shown at _a_, _b_, and _c_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79.--Diagram of the Chief Steps in Cell-division.\r\n(After Parker as altered from Fleming.)]\r\n\r\nCentrosome.--The discovery (1876) of a minute spot of deeply staining\r\nprotoplasm, usually just outside the nuclear membrane, is another\r\nillustration of the complex structure of the cell. Although the\r\ncentrosome, as this spot is called, has been heralded as a dynamic\r\nagent, there is not complete agreement as to its purpose, but its\r\npresence makes it necessary to include it in the definition of a cell.\r\n\r\nThe Cell in Heredity.--The problems of inheritance, in so far as they\r\ncan be elucidated by structural studies, have come to be recognized as\r\nproblems of cellular life. But we cannot understand what is implied by\r\nthis conclusion without referring to the behavior of the chromosomes\r\nduring cell-division. This is a very complex process, and varies\r\nsomewhat in different tissues. We can, however, with the help of Fig.\r\n79, describe what takes place in a typical case. The nucleus does not\r\ndivide directly, but the chromosomes congregate around the equator of\r\na spindle (_D_) formed from the achromatin; they then undergo division\r\nlengthwise, and migrate to the poles (_E_, _F_, _G_), after which a\r\npartition wall is formed dividing the cell. This manner of division\r\nof the chromosomes secures an equable partition of the protoplasm. In\r\nthe case of fertilized eggs, one-half of the chromosomes are derived\r\nfrom the sperm and one-half from the egg. Each cell thus contains\r\nhereditary substance derived from both maternal and paternal nuclei.\r\nThis is briefly the basis for regarding inheritance as a phenomenon of\r\ncell-life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80.--Diagram of a Cell. (Modified after Wilson.)]\r\n\r\nA diagram of the cell as now understood (Fig. 80) will be helpful in\r\nshowing how much the conception of the cell has changed since the time\r\nof Schleiden and Schwann.\r\n\r\nDefinition.--The definition of Verworn, made in 1895, may be combined\r\nwith this diagram: A cell is \"a body consisting essentially of\r\nprotoplasm in its general form, including the unmodified cytoplasm,\r\nand the specialized nucleus and centrosome; while as unessential\r\naccompaniments may be enumerated: (1) the cell membrane, (2) starch\r\ngrains, (3) pigment granules, (4) oil globules, and (5) chlorophyll\r\ngranules.\" No definition can include all variations, but the one quoted\r\nis excellent in directing attention to the essentials--to protoplasm in\r\nits general form, and the modified protoplasmic parts as distinguished\r\nfrom the unessential accompaniments, as cell membrane and cell contents.\r\n\r\nThe definition of Verworn was reached by a series of steps representing\r\nthe historical advance of knowledge regarding the cell. Schleiden and\r\nSchwann looked upon the cell as a hollow chamber having a cell-wall\r\nwhich had been formed around the nucleus; it was a great step when\r\nSchultze defined the cell in terms of living substance as \"a globule\r\nof protoplasm surrounding a nucleus,\" and it is a still deeper level\r\nof analysis which gives us a discriminating definition like that of\r\nVerworn.\r\n\r\nWhen we are brought to realize that, in large part, the questions that\r\nengage the mind of the biologist have their basis in the study of\r\ncells, we are ready to appreciate the force of the statement that the\r\nestablishment of the cell-theory was one of the great events of the\r\nnineteenth century, and, further, that it stands second to no theory,\r\nwith the single exception of that of organic evolution, in advancing\r\nbiological science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nPROTOPLASM, THE PHYSICAL BASIS OF LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recognition of the rôle that protoplasm plays in the living world\r\nwas so far-reaching in its results that we take up for separate\r\nconsideration the history of its discovery. Although it is not yet\r\nfifty years since Max Schultze established the protoplasm doctrine, it\r\nhas already had the greatest influence upon the progress of biology. To\r\nthe consideration of protoplasm in the previous chapter should be added\r\nan account of the conditions of its discovery, and of the personality\r\nand views of the men whose privilege it was to bring the protoplasm\r\nidea to its logical conclusion. Before doing so, however, we shall look\r\nat the nature of protoplasm itself.\r\n\r\nProtoplasm.--This substance, which is the seat of all vital activity,\r\nwas designated by Huxley \"the physical basis of life,\" a graphic\r\nexpression which brings before the mind the central fact that life is\r\nmanifested in a material substratum by which it is conditioned. All\r\nthat biologists have been able to discover regarding life has been\r\nderived from the observation of that material substratum. It is not\r\ndifficult, with the help of a microscope, to get a view of protoplasmic\r\nactivity, and that which was so laboriously made known about 1860 is\r\nnow shown annually to students beginning biology.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as all living organisms contain protoplasm, one has a wide\r\nrange of choice in selecting the plant or the animal upon which to make\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nWe may, for illustration, take one of the simplest of animal organisms,\r\nthe amoeba, and place it under the high powers of the microscope.\r\nThis little animal consists almost entirely of a lump of living jelly.\r\nWithin the living substance of which its body is composed all the vital\r\nactivities characteristic of higher animals are going on, but they are\r\nmanifested in simpler form. These manifestations differ only in degree\r\nof development, not in kind, from those we see in bodies of higher\r\norganisms.\r\n\r\nWe can watch the movements in this amoeba, determine at first hand\r\nits inherent qualities, and then draw up a sort of catalogue of its\r\nvital properties. We notice an almost continual flux of the viscid\r\nsubstance, by means of which it is able to alter its form and to\r\nchange its position. This quality is called that of contractility. In\r\nits essential nature it is like the protoplasmic movement that takes\r\nplace in a contracting muscle. We find also that the substance of the\r\namoeba responds to stimulations--such as touching it with a bristle, or\r\nheating it, or sending through it a light electric shock. This response\r\nis quite independent of the contractility, and by physiologists is\r\ndesignated the property of being irritable.\r\n\r\nBy further observations one may determine that the substance of\r\nthe amoeba is receptive and assimilative, that it is respiratory,\r\ntaking in oxygen and giving off carbonic dioxide, and that it is also\r\nsecretory. If the amoeba be watched long enough, it may be seen to\r\nundergo division, thus producing another individual of its kind. We\r\nsay, therefore, that it exhibits the power of reproduction. All these\r\nproperties manifested in close association in the amoeba are exhibited\r\nin the bodies of higher organisms in a greater degree of perfection,\r\nand also in separation, particular organs often being set apart for the\r\nperformance of one of these particular functions. We should, however,\r\nbear in mind that in the simple protoplasm of the amoeba is found the\r\ngerm of all the activities of the higher animals.\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient now to turn our attention to the microscopic\r\nexamination of a plant that is sufficiently transparent to enable us to\r\nlook within its living parts and observe the behavior of protoplasm.\r\nThe first thing that strikes one is the continual activity of the\r\nliving substance within the boundaries of a particular cell. This\r\nmovement sometimes takes the form of rotation around the walls of the\r\ncell (Fig. 81 _A_). In other instances the protoplasm marks out for\r\nitself new paths, giving a more complicated motion, called circulation\r\n(Fig. 81 _B_). These movements are the result of chemical changes\r\ntaking place within the protoplasm, and they are usually to be observed\r\nin any plant or animal organism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81.--(_A_) Rotation of Protoplasm in the Cells of\r\nNitella. (_B_) Highly Magnified Cell of a Tradescantia Plant, Showing\r\nCirculation of Protoplasm. (After Sedgwick and Wilson.)]\r\n\r\nUnder the most favorable conditions these movements, as seen under\r\nthe microscope, make a perfect torrent of unceasing activity, and\r\nintroduce us to one of the wonderful sights of which students of\r\nbiology have so many. Huxley (with slight verbal alterations) says:\r\n\"The spectacle afforded by the wonderful energies imprisoned within\r\nthe compass of the microscopic cell of a plant, which we commonly\r\nregard as a merely passive organism, is not easily forgotten by one\r\nwho has watched its movement hour by hour without pause or sign of\r\nweakening. The possible complexity of many other organisms seemingly\r\nas simple as the protoplasm of the plant just mentioned dawns upon\r\none, and the comparison of such activity to that of higher animals\r\nloses much of its startling character. Currents similar to these have\r\nbeen observed in a great multitude of very different plants, and it is\r\nquite uniformly believed that they occur in more or less perfection in\r\nall young vegetable cells. If such be the case, the wonderful noonday\r\nsilence of a tropical forest is due, after all, only to the dullness\r\nof our hearing, and could our ears catch the murmur of these tiny\r\nmaelstroms as they whirl in the innumerable myriads of living cells\r\nthat constitute each tree, we should be stunned as with the roar of a\r\ngreat city.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Essential Steps in Recognizing the Likeness of Protoplasm in Plants\r\nand Animals\r\n\r\nDujardin.--This substance, of so much interest and importance to\r\nbiologists, was first clearly described and distinguished from other\r\nviscid substance, as albumen, by Félix Dujardin in 1835. Both the\r\nsubstance and the movements therein had been seen and recorded by\r\nothers: by Rösel von Rosenhof in 1755 in the proteus animalcule; again\r\nin 1772 by Corti in chara; by Mayen in 1827 in Vallisnieria; and in\r\n1831 by Robert Brown in Tradescantia. One of these records was for\r\nthe animal kingdom, and three were for plants. The observations of\r\nDujardin, however, were on a different plane from those of the earlier\r\nnaturalists, and he is usually credited with being the discoverer of\r\nprotoplasm. His researches, moreover, were closely connected with the\r\ndevelopment of the ideas regarding the rôle played in nature by this\r\nliving substance.\r\n\r\nDujardin was a quiet modest man, whose attainments and service to the\r\nprogress of biology have usually been under-rated. He was born in 1801\r\nat Tours, and died in 1860 at Rennes. Being descended from a race of\r\nwatchmakers, he received in his youth a training in that craft which\r\ncultivated his natural manual dexterity, and, later, this assisted\r\nhim in his manipulations of the microscope. He had a fondness for\r\nsketching, and produced some miniatures and other works of art that\r\nshowed great merit. His use of colors was very effective, and in 1818\r\nhe went to Paris for the purpose of perfecting himself in painting,\r\nand with the intention of becoming an artist. The small financial\r\nreturns, however, \"led him to accept work as an engineer directing the\r\nconstruction of hydraulic work in Sédan.\" He had already shown a love\r\nfor natural science, and this led him from engineering into work as a\r\nlibrarian and then as a teacher. He made field observations in geology\r\nand botany, and commenced publication in those departments of science.\r\n\r\nAbout 1834 he began to devote his chief efforts to microscopic work,\r\ntoward which he had a strong inclination, and from that time on he\r\nbecame a zoölogist, with a steadily growing recognition for high-class\r\nobservation. Besides his technical scientific papers, he wrote in a\r\npopular vein to increase his income. Among his writings of this type\r\nmay be mentioned as occupying high rank his charmingly written \"Rambles\r\nof a Naturalist\" (_Promenades d'un Naturaliste_, 1838).\r\n\r\nBy 1840 he had established such a good record as a scientific\r\ninvestigator that he was called to the newly founded University of\r\nRennes as dean of the faculty. He found himself in an atmosphere of\r\njealous criticism, largely on account of his being elevated to the\r\nstation of dean, and after two years of discomfort he resigned the\r\ndeanship, but retained his position as a professor in the university.\r\nHe secured a residence in a retired spot near a church, and lived there\r\nsimply. In his leisure moments he talked frequently with the priests,\r\nand became a devout Catholic.\r\n\r\nHis contributions to science cover a wide range of subjects. In his\r\nmicroscopic work he discovered the rhizopods in 1834, and the study\r\nof their structure gave him the key to that of the other protozoa.\r\nIn 1835 he visited the Mediterranean, where he studied the oceanic\r\nforaminifera, and demonstrated that they should be grouped with the\r\nprotozoa, and not, as had been maintained up to that time, with the\r\nmollusca. It was during the prosecution of these researches that he\r\nmade the observations upon sarcode that are of particular interest to\r\nus.\r\n\r\nHis natural history of the infusoria (1841) makes a volume of 700\r\npages, full of original observations and sketches. He also invented\r\na means of illumination for the microscope, and wrote a manual of\r\nmicroscopic observation. Among the ninety-six publications of Dujardin\r\nlisted by Professor Joubin there are seven general works, twenty\r\nrelating to the protozoa, twenty-four to geology, three to botany,\r\nfour to physics, twenty-five to arthropods, eight to worms, etc., etc.\r\nBut as Joubin says: \"The great modesty of Dujardin allowed him to see\r\npublished by others, without credit to himself, numerous facts and\r\nobservations which he had established.\" This failure to assert his\r\nclaims accounts in part for the inadequate recognition that his work\r\nhas received.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82.--Félix Dujardin, 1801-1860.]\r\n\r\nNo portrait of Dujardin was obtainable prior to 1898. Somewhat earlier\r\nProfessor Joubin, who succeeded other occupants of the chair which\r\nDujardin held in the University of Rennes, found in the possession\r\nof his descendants a portrait, which he was permitted to copy. The\r\nearliest reproduction of this picture to reach this country came to the\r\nwriter through the courtesy of Professor Joubin, and a copy of it is\r\nrepresented in Fig. 82. His picture bespeaks his personality. The quiet\r\nrefinement and sincerity of his face are evident. Professor Joubin\r\npublished, in 1901 (_Archives de Parasitologie_), a biographical sketch\r\nof Dujardin, with several illustrations, including this portrait and\r\nanother one which is very interesting, showing him in academic costume.\r\nThanks to the spread of information of the kind contained in that\r\narticle, Dujardin is coming into wider recognition, and will occupy the\r\nhistorical position to which his researches entitle him.\r\n\r\nIt was while studying the protozoa that he began to take particular\r\nnotice of the substance of which their bodies are composed; and in\r\n1835 he described it as a living jelly endowed with all the qualities\r\nof life. He had seen the same jelly-like substance exuding from the\r\ninjured parts of worms, and recognized it as the same material that\r\nmakes the body of protozoa. He observed it very carefully in the\r\nciliated infusoria--in Paramoecium, in Vorticella, and other forms,\r\nbut he was not satisfied with mere microscopic observation of its\r\nstructure. He tested its solubility, he subjected it to the action\r\nof alcohol, nitric acid, potash, and other chemical substances, and\r\nthereby distinguished it from albumen, mucus, gelatin, etc.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as this substance manifestly was soft, Dujardin proposed\r\nfor it the name of sarcode, from the Greek, meaning _soft_. Thus we\r\nsee that the substance protoplasm was for the first time brought\r\nvery definitely to the attention of naturalists through the study\r\nof animal forms. For some time it occupied a position of isolation,\r\nbut ultimately became recognized as being identical with a similar\r\nsubstance that occurs in plants. At the time of Dujardin's discovery,\r\nsarcode was supposed to be peculiar to lower animals; it was not known\r\nthat the same substance made the living part of all animals, and it\r\nwas owing mainly to this circumstance that the full recognition of its\r\nimportance in nature was delayed.\r\n\r\nThe fact remains that the first careful studies upon sarcode were due\r\nto Dujardin, and, therefore, we must include him among the founders of\r\nmodern biology.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83.-Purkinje, 1787-1869.]\r\n\r\nPurkinje.--The observations of the Bohemian investigator Purkinje\r\n(1787-1869) form a link in the chain of events leading up to the\r\nrecognition of protoplasm. Although Purkinje is especially remembered\r\nfor other scientific contributions, he was the first to make use\r\nof the name protoplasm for living matter, by applying it to the\r\nformative substance within the eggs of animals and within the cells\r\nof the embryo. His portrait is not frequently seen, and, therefore,\r\nis included here (Fig. 83), to give a more complete series of\r\npictures of the men who were directly connected with the development\r\nof the protoplasm idea. Purkinje was successively a professor in\r\nthe universities of Breslau and Prague. His anatomical laboratory\r\nat Breslau is notable as being one of the earliest (1825) open to\r\nstudents. He went to Prague in 1850 as professor of physiology.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84.--Carl Nägeli, 1817-1891.]\r\n\r\nVon Mohl.--In 1846, eleven years after the discovery of Dujardin, the\r\neminent botanist Hugo von Mohl (1805-1872) designated a particular part\r\nof the living contents of the vegetable cell by the term protoplasma.\r\nThe viscid, jelly-like substance in plants had in the mean time\r\ncome to be known under the expressive term of plant \"_schleim_.\" He\r\ndistinguished the firmer mucilaginous and granular constituent, found\r\njust under the cell membrane, from the watery cell-sap that occupies\r\nthe interior of the cell. It was to the former part that he gave the\r\nname protoplasma. Previous to this, the botanist Nägeli had studied\r\nthis living substance, and perceived that it was nitrogenous matter.\r\nThis was a distinct step in advance of the vague and indefinite idea of\r\nSchleiden, who had in reality noticed protoplasm in 1838, but thought\r\nof it merely as gum. The highly accomplished investigator Nägeli (Fig.\r\n84) made a great place for himself in botanical investigation, and his\r\nname is connected with several fundamental ideas of biology. To Von\r\nMohl, however, belongs the credit of having brought the word protoplasm\r\ninto general use. He stands in the direct line of development, while\r\nPurkinje, who first employed the word protoplasm, stands somewhat\r\naside, but his name, nevertheless, should be connected with the\r\nestablishment of the protoplasm doctrine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 85.--Hugo von Mohl, 1805-1872.]\r\n\r\nVon Mohl (Fig. 85) was an important man in botany. Early in life he\r\nshowed a great love for natural science, and as in his day medical\r\ninstruction afforded the best opportunities for a man with scientific\r\ntastes, he entered upon that course of study in Tübingen at the age of\r\neighteen. He took his degree of doctor of medicine in 1823, and spent\r\nseveral years in Munich. He became professor of physiology in Bern in\r\n1832, and three years later was transferred to Tübingen as professor of\r\nbotany. Here he remained to the end of his life, refusing invitations\r\nto institutions elsewhere. He never married, and, without the cares\r\nand joys of a family, led a solitary and uneventful life, devoted to\r\nbotanical investigation.\r\n\r\nCohn.--After Von Mohl's studies on \"plant schleim\" there was a general\r\nmovement toward the conclusion that the sarcode of the zoölogists and\r\nthe protoplasm of the botanists were one and the same substance. This\r\nnotion was in the minds of more than one worker, but it is perhaps to\r\nFerdinand Cohn (1828-1898) that the credit should be given for bringing\r\nthe question to a head. After a study of the remarkable movements of\r\nthe active spores of one of the simplest plants (protococcus), he said\r\nthat vegetable protoplasm and animal sarcode, \"if not identical, must\r\nbe, at any rate, in the highest degree analogous substances\" (Geddes).\r\n\r\nCohn (Fig. 86) was for nearly forty years professor of botany in the\r\nUniversity of Breslau, and during his long life as an investigator\r\ngreatly advanced the knowledge of bacteria. His statement referred\r\nto above was made when he was twenty-two years of age, and ran too\r\nfar ahead of the evidence then accumulated; it merely anticipated\r\nthe coming period of the acceptance of the conclusion in its full\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86.--Ferdinand Cohn, 1828-1898.]\r\n\r\nDe Bary.--We find, then, in the middle years of the nineteenth century\r\nthe idea launched that sarcode and protoplasm are identical, but it\r\nwas not yet definitely established that the sarcode of lower animals\r\nis the same as the living substance of the higher ones, and there was,\r\ntherefore, lacking an essential factor to the conclusion that there\r\nis only one general form of living matter in all organisms. It took\r\nanother ten years of investigation to reach this end.\r\n\r\nThe most important contributions from the botanical side during this\r\nperiod were the splendid researches of De Bary (Fig. 87) on the\r\nmyxomycetes, published in 1859. Here the resemblance between sarcode\r\nand protoplasm was brought out with great clearness. The myxomycetes\r\nare, in one condition, masses of vegetable protoplasm, the movements\r\nand other characteristics of which were shown to resemble strongly\r\nthose of the protozoa. De Bary's great fame as a botanist has made his\r\nname widely known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87.--Heinrich A. de Bary, 1831-1888.]\r\n\r\nIn 1858 Virchow also, by his extensive studies in the pathology of\r\nliving cells, added one more link to the chain that was soon to be\r\nrecognized as encircling the new domain of modern biology.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88.--Max Schultze, 1825-1874.]\r\n\r\nSchultze.--As the culmination of a long period of work, Max\r\nSchultze, in 1861, placed the conception of the identity between\r\nanimal sarcode and vegetable protoplasm upon an unassailable basis,\r\nand therefore he has received the title of \"the father of modern\r\nbiology.\" He showed that sarcode, which was supposed to be confined\r\nto the lower invertebrates, is also present in the tissues of higher\r\nanimals, and there exhibits the same properties. The qualities of\r\ncontractility and irritability were especially indicated. It was on\r\nphysiological likeness, rather than on structural grounds, that he\r\nformed his sweeping conclusions. He showed also that sarcode agreed\r\nin physiological properties with protoplasm in plants, and that the\r\ntwo living substances were practically identical. His paper of 1861\r\nconsiders the living substance in muscles (_Ueber Muskelkörperchen und\r\ndas was man eine Zelle zu nennen habe_), but in this he had been partly\r\nanticipated by Ecker who, in 1849, compared the \"formed contractile\r\nsubstance\" of muscles with the \"unformed contractile substance\" of the\r\nlower types of animal life (Geddes).\r\n\r\nThe clear-cut, intellectual face of Schultze (Fig. 88) is that of an\r\nadmirable man with a combination of the artistic and the scientific\r\ntemperaments. He was greatly interested in music from his youth up, and\r\nby the side of his microscope was his well-beloved violin. He was some\r\ntime professor in the University of Halle, and in 1859 went to Bonn\r\nas professor of anatomy and director of the Anatomical Institute. His\r\nservice to histology has already been spoken of (Chapter VIII).\r\n\r\nThis astute observer will have an enduring fame in biological science,\r\nnot only for the part he played in the development of the protoplasm\r\nidea, but also on account of other extensive labors. In 1866 he\r\nfounded the leading periodical in microscopic anatomy, the _Archiv\r\nfür Mikroscopische Anatomie_. This periodical was continued after the\r\nuntimely death of Schultze in 1874, and to-day is one of the leading\r\nbiological periodicals.\r\n\r\nIt is easy, looking backward, to observe that the period between\r\n1840 and 1860 was a very important one for modern biology. Many new\r\nideas were coming into existence, but through this period we can\r\ntrace distinctly, step by step, the gradual approach to the idea that\r\nprotoplasm, the living substance of organism, is practically the same\r\nin plants and in animals. Let us picture to ourselves the consequences\r\nof the acceptance of this idea. Now for the first time physiologists\r\nbegan to have their attention directed to the actually living\r\nsubstance; now for the first time they saw clearly that all future\r\nprogress was to be made by studying this living substance--the seat of\r\nvital activity. This was the beginning of modern biology.\r\n\r\nProtoplasm is the particular object of study for the biologist. To\r\nobserve its properties, to determine how it behaves under different\r\nconditions, how it responds to stimuli and natural agencies, to\r\ndiscover the relation of the internal changes to the outside agencies:\r\nthese, which constitute the fundamental ideas of biology, were for the\r\nfirst time brought directly to the attention of the naturalist, about\r\nthe year 1860--that epoch-making time when appeared Darwin's _Origin of\r\nSpecies_ and Spencer's _First Principles_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE WORK OF PASTEUR, KOCH, AND OTHERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of bacteria, those minutest forms of life, has exerted\r\na profound influence upon the development of general biology. There\r\nare many questions relating to bacteria that are strictly medical, but\r\nother phases of their life and activities are broadly biological, and\r\nsome of those broader aspects will next be brought under consideration.\r\n\r\nThe bacteria were first described by Leeuwenhoek in 1687, twelve\r\nyears after his discovery of the microscopic animalcula now called\r\nprotozoa. They are so infinitesimal in size that under his microscope\r\nthey appeared as mere specks, and, naturally, observation of these\r\nminute organisms was suspended until nearly the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century, after the improvement of microscope lenses. It is\r\ncharacteristic of the little knowledge of bacteria in Linnæus's period\r\nthat he grouped them into an order, with other microscopic forms, under\r\nthe name _chaos_.\r\n\r\nAt first sight, the bacteria appear too minute to figure\r\nlargely in human affairs, but a great department of natural\r\nscience--bacteriology--has been opened by the study of their\r\nactivities, and it must be admitted that the development of the science\r\nof bacteriology has been of great practical importance. The knowledge\r\nderived from experimental studies of the bacteria has been the chief\r\nsource of light in an obscure domain which profoundly affects the\r\nwell-being of mankind. To the advance of such knowledge we owe the\r\ngerm-theory of disease and the ability of medical men to cope with\r\ncontagious diseases. The three greatest names connected with the rise\r\nof bacteriology are those of Pasteur, Koch, and Lister, the results of\r\nwhose labors will be considered later.\r\n\r\nAmong the general topics which have been clustered around the study of\r\nbacteria we take up, first, the question of the spontaneous origin of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spontaneous Origin of Life\r\n\r\nIt will be readily understood that the question of the spontaneous\r\ngeneration of life is a fundamental one for the biologist. Does life\r\nalways arise from previously existing life, or under certain conditions\r\nis it developed spontaneously? Is there, in the inorganic world, a\r\nhappy concourse of atoms that become chained together through the\r\naction of the sun's rays and other natural forces, so that a molecule\r\nof living matter is constructed in nature's laboratory without contact\r\nor close association with living substance? This is a question of\r\n_biogenesis_--life from previous life--or of _abiogenesis_--life\r\nwithout preëxisting life or from inorganic matter alone.\r\n\r\nIt is a question with a long history. Its earliest phases do not\r\ninvolve any consideration of microscopic forms, since they were\r\nunknown, but its middle and its modern aspect are concerned especially\r\nwith bacteria and other microscopic organisms. The historical\r\ndevelopment of the problem may be conveniently considered under three\r\ndivisions: I. The period from Aristotle, 325 B.C., to the experiments\r\nof Redi, in 1668; II. From the experiments of Redi to those of Schulze\r\nand Schwann in 1836 and 1837; III. The modern phase, extending from\r\nPouchet's observations in 1859 to the present.\r\n\r\nI. From Aristotle to Redi.--During the first period, the notion of\r\nspontaneous generation was universally accepted, and the whole question\r\nof spontaneous origin of life was in a crude and grotesque condition.\r\nIt was thought that frogs and toads and other animals arose from the\r\nmud of ponds and streams through the vivifying action of the sun's\r\nrays. Rats were supposed to come from the river Nile, the dew was\r\nsupposed to give origin to insects, etc.\r\n\r\nThe scientific writers of this period had little openness of mind,\r\nand they indulged in scornful and sarcastic comments at the expense\r\nof those who doubted the occurrence of spontaneous generation. In the\r\nseventeenth century Alexander Ross, commenting on Sir Thomas Brown's\r\ndoubt as to whether mice may be bred by putrefaction, flays his\r\nantagonist in the following words: \"So may we doubt whether in cheese\r\nand timber worms are generated, or if beetles and wasps in cow-dung,\r\nor if butterflies, locusts, shell-fish, snails, eels, and such life be\r\nprocreated of putrefied matter, which is to receive the form of that\r\ncreature to which it is by formative power disposed. To question this\r\nis to question reason, sense, and experience. If he doubts this, let\r\nhim go to Egypt, and there he will find the fields swarming with mice\r\nbegot of the mud of Nylus, to the great calamity of the inhabitants.\"\r\n\r\nII. From Redi to Schwann.--The second period embraces the experimental\r\ntests of Redi (1668), Spallanzani (1775), and Schwann (1837)--notable\r\nachievements that resulted in a verdict for the adherents to the\r\ndoctrine of biogenesis. Here the question might have rested had it not\r\nbeen opened upon theoretical ground by Pouchet in 1859.\r\n\r\nThe First Experiments.--The belief in spontaneous generation, which\r\nwas so firmly implanted in the minds of naturalists, was subjected\r\nto an experimental test in 1668 by the Italian Redi. It is a curious\r\ncircumstance, but one that throws great light upon the condition\r\nof intellectual development of the period, that no one previous\r\nto Redi had attempted to test the truth or falsity of the theory\r\nof spontaneous generation. To approach this question from the\r\nexperimental side was to do a great service to science.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Redi were simple and homely. He exposed meat in\r\njars, some of which were left uncovered, some covered with parchment,\r\nand others with fine wire gauze. The meat in all these vessels became\r\nspoiled, and flies, being attracted by the smell of decaying meat,\r\nlaid eggs in that which was exposed, and there came from it a large\r\ncrop of maggots. The meat which was covered by parchment also decayed\r\nin a similar manner, without the appearance of maggots within it; and\r\nin those vessels covered by wire netting the flies laid their eggs\r\nupon the wire netting. There they hatched, and the maggots, instead\r\nof appearing in the meat, appeared on the surface of the wire gauze.\r\nFrom this Redi concluded that maggots arise in decaying meat from the\r\nhatching of the eggs of insects, but inasmuch as these animals had\r\nbeen supposed to arise spontaneously within the decaying meat, the\r\nexperiment took the ground from under that hypothesis.\r\n\r\nHe made other observations on the generation of insects, but with acute\r\nscientific analysis never allowed his conclusions to run ahead of his\r\nobservations. He suggested, however, the probability that all cases\r\nof the supposed production of life from dead matter were due to the\r\nintroduction of living germs from without. The good work begun by Redi\r\nwas confirmed and extended by Swammerdam (1637-1681) and Vallisnieri\r\n(1661-1730), until the notion of the spontaneous origin of any forms\r\nof life visible to the unaided eye was banished from the minds of\r\nscientific men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89.--Francesco Redi, 1626-1697.]\r\n\r\nRedi (Fig. 89) was an Italian physician living in Arentino,\r\ndistinguished alike for his attainments in literature and for his\r\nachievements in natural science. He was medical adviser to two of\r\nthe grand dukes of Tuscany, and a member of the Academy of Crusca.\r\nPoetry as well as other literary compositions shared his time with\r\nscientific occupations. His collected works, literary, scientific, and\r\nmedical, were published in nine octavo volumes in Milan, 1809-1811.\r\nThis collection includes his life and letters, and embraces one\r\nvolume of sonnets. The book that has been referred to as containing\r\nhis experiments was entitled _Esperienze Intorno Alla Generazione\r\nDegl'Insetti_, and first saw the light in quarto form in Florence\r\nin 1668. It went through five editions in twenty years. Some of the\r\nvolumes were translated into Latin, and were published in miniature,\r\nmaking books not more than four inches high. Huxley says: \"The extreme\r\nsimplicity of his experiments, and the clearness of his arguments,\r\ngained for his views and for their consequences almost universal\r\nacceptance.\"\r\n\r\nNew Form of the Question.--The question of the spontaneous generation\r\nof life was soon to take on a new aspect. Seven years after the\r\nexperiments of Redi, Leeuwenhoek made known a new world of microscopic\r\norganisms--the infusoria--and, as we have seen, he discovered, in\r\n1687, those still minuter forms, the bacteria. Strictly speaking, the\r\nbacteria, on account of their extreme minuteness, were lost sight of,\r\nbut spontaneous generation was evoked to account for the birth of all\r\nmicroscopic organisms, and the question circled mainly around the\r\ninfusorial animalcula. While the belief in the spontaneous generation\r\nof life among forms visible to the unaided eye had been surrendered,\r\nnevertheless doubts were entertained as to the origin of microscopic\r\norganisms, and it was now asserted that here were found the beginnings\r\nof life--the place where inorganic material was changed through natural\r\nagencies into organized beings microscopic in size.\r\n\r\nMore than seventy years elapsed before the matter was again subjected\r\nto experimental tests. Then Needham, using the method of Redi, began\r\nto experiment on the production of microscopic animalcula. In many\r\nof his experiments he was associated with Buffon, the great French\r\nnaturalist, who had a theory of organic molecules that he wished to\r\nsustain. Needham (1713-1784), a priest of the Catholic faith, was an\r\nEnglishman living on the Continent; he was for many years director of\r\nthe Academy of Maria Theresa at Brussels. He engaged in scientific\r\ninvestigations in connection with his work of teaching. The results of\r\nNeedham's first experiments were published in 1748. These experiments\r\nwere conducted by extracting the juices of meat by boiling; by then\r\nenclosing the juices in vials, the latter being carefully corked and\r\nsealed with mastic; by subjecting the sealed bottles, finally, to heat,\r\nand setting them away to cool. In due course of time, the fluids thus\r\ntreated became infected with microscopic life, and, inasmuch as Needham\r\nbelieved that he had killed all living germs by repeated heating,\r\nhe concluded that the living forms had been produced by spontaneous\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nSpallanzani.--The epoch-making researches of Spallanzani, a\r\nfellow-countryman of Redi, were needed to point out the error in\r\nNeedham's conclusions. Spallanzani (Fig. 90) was one of the most\r\neminent men of his time. He was educated for the church, and,\r\ntherefore, he is usually known under the title of Abbé Spallanzani.\r\nHe did not, however, actively engage in his churchly offices, but,\r\nfollowing an innate love of natural science and of investigation,\r\ndevoted himself to experiments and researches and to teaching. He\r\nwas first a professor at Bologna, and afterward at the University of\r\nPavia. He made many additions to knowledge of the development and the\r\nphysiology of organisms, and he was the first to make use of glass\r\nflasks in the experimental study of the question of the spontaneous\r\ngeneration of life.\r\n\r\nSpallanzani thought that the experiments of Needham had not been\r\nconducted with sufficient care and precision; accordingly, he made use\r\nof glass flasks with slender necks which could be hermetically sealed\r\nafter the nutrient fluids had been introduced. The vials which Needham\r\nused as containers were simply corked and sealed with mastic, and it\r\nwas by no means certain that the entrance of air after heating had been\r\nprevented; moreover, no record was made by Needham of the temperature\r\nand the time of heating to which his bottles and fluids had been\r\nsubjected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90.--Lazzaro Spallanzani, 1729-1799.]\r\n\r\nSpallanzani took nutrient fluids, such as the juices of vegetables\r\nand meats which had been extracted by boiling, placed them in clear\r\nflasks, the necks of which were hermetically sealed in flame, and\r\nafterward immersed them in boiling water for three-quarters of an\r\nhour, in order to destroy all germs that might be contained in them.\r\nThe organic infusions of Spallanzani remained free from change. It\r\nwas then, as now, a well-known fact that organic fluids, when exposed\r\nto air, quickly decompose and acquire a bad smell; they soon become\r\nturbid, and in a little time a scum is formed upon their surface. The\r\nfluids in the flasks of Spallanzani remained of the same appearance and\r\nconsistency as when they were first introduced into the vessel, and the\r\nobvious conclusion was drawn that microscopic life is not spontaneously\r\nformed within nutrient fluids.\r\n\r\n\"But Needham was not satisfied with these results, and with a show of\r\nreason maintained that such a prolonged boiling would destroy not only\r\ngerms, but the germinative, or, as he called it, the 'vegetative force'\r\nof the infusion itself. Spallanzani easily disposed of this objection\r\nby showing that when the infusions were again exposed to the air, no\r\nmatter how severe or prolonged the boiling to which they had been\r\nsubjected, the infusoria reappeared. His experiments were made in great\r\nnumbers, with different infusions, and were conducted with the utmost\r\ncare and precision\" (Dunster). It must be confessed, however, that\r\nthe success of his experiments was owing largely to the purity of the\r\nair in which he worked, the more resistant atmospheric germs were not\r\npresent: as Wyman showed, long afterward, that germs may retain their\r\nvitality after being subjected for several hours to the temperature of\r\nboiling water.\r\n\r\nSchulze and Schwann.--The results of Spallanzani's experiments were\r\npublished in 1775, and were generally regarded by the naturalists\r\nof that period as answering in the negative the question of the\r\nspontaneous generation of life. Doubts began to arise as to the\r\nconclusive nature of Spallanzani's experiments, on account of the\r\ndiscovery of the part which oxygen plays in reference to life. The\r\ndiscovery of oxygen, one of the greatest scientific events of the\r\neighteenth century, was made by Priestley in 1774. It was soon shown\r\nthat oxygen is necessary to all forms of life, and the question was\r\nraised: Had not the boiling of the closed flasks changed the oxygen\r\nso that through the heating process it had lost its life-giving\r\nproperties? This doubt grew until a reëxamination of the question of\r\nspontaneous generation became necessary under conditions in which the\r\nnutrient fluids were made accessible to the outside air.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 Franz Schulze, and, in the following year, Theodor Schwann,\r\ndevised experiments to test the question on this new basis. Schwann is\r\nknown to us as the founder of the cell-theory, but we must not confuse\r\nSchulze with Max Schultze, who established the protoplasm doctrine. In\r\nthe experiments of Schulze, a flask was arranged containing nutrient\r\nfluids, with a large cork perforated and closely fitted with bent glass\r\ntubes connected on one side with a series of bulbs in which were placed\r\nsulphuric acid and other chemical substances. An aspirator was attached\r\nto the other end of this system, and air from the outside was sucked\r\ninto the flask, passing on its way through the bulbs containing the\r\nchemical substances. The purpose of this was to remove the floating\r\ngerms that exist in the air, while the air itself was shown, through\r\nother experiments by Schwann, to remain unchanged.\r\n\r\nTyndall says in reference to these experiments: \"Here again the success\r\nof Schulze was due to his working in comparatively pure air, but even\r\nin such air his experiment is a risky one. Germs will pass unwetted\r\nand unscathed through sulphuric acid unless the most special care is\r\ntaken to detain them. I have repeatedly failed, by repeating Schulze's\r\nexperiments, to obtain his results. Others have failed likewise. The\r\nair passes in bubbles through the bulbs, and to render the method\r\nsecure, the passage of the air must be so slow as to cause the whole of\r\nits floating matter, even to the very core of each bubble, to touch the\r\nsurrounding fluid. But if this precaution be observed _water will be\r\nfound quite as effectual as sulphuric acid_.\"\r\n\r\nSchwann's apparatus was similar in construction, except that the bent\r\ntube on one side was surrounded by a jacket of metal and was subjected\r\nto a very high temperature while the air was being drawn through it,\r\nthe effect being to kill any floating germs that might exist in the\r\nair. Great care was taken by both experimenters to have their flasks\r\nand fluids thoroughly sterilized, and the results of their experiments\r\nwere to show that the nutrient fluids remained uncontaminated.\r\n\r\nThese experiments proved that there is something in the atmosphere\r\nwhich, unless it be removed or rendered inactive, produces life within\r\nnutrient fluids, but whether this something is solid, fluid, or gaseous\r\ndid not appear from the experiments. It remained for Helmholtz to\r\nshow, as he did in 1843, that this something will not pass through a\r\nmoist animal membrane, and is therefore a solid. The results so far\r\nreached satisfied the minds of scientific men, and the question of the\r\nspontaneous origin of life was regarded as having been finally set at\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nIII. The Third Period. Pouchet.--We come now to consider the third\r\nhistorical phase of this question. Although it had apparently been\r\nset at rest, the question was unexpectedly opened again in 1859\r\nby the Frenchman Pouchet, the director of the Natural History\r\nMuseum of Rouen. The frame of mind which Pouchet brought to his\r\nexperimental investigations was fatal to unbiased conclusions: \"When,\r\n_by meditation_,\" he says, in the opening paragraph of his book on\r\n_Heterogenesis_, \"it was evident to me that spontaneous generation\r\nwas one of the means employed by nature for the production of living\r\nbeings, I applied myself to discover by what means one could place\r\nthese phenomena in evidence.\" Although he experimented, his case was\r\nprejudiced by metaphysical considerations. He repeated the experiments\r\nof previous observers with opposite results, and therefore he declared\r\nhis belief in the falsity of the conclusions of Spallanzani, Schulze,\r\nand Schwann.\r\n\r\nHe planned and executed one experiment which he supposed was\r\nconclusive. In introducing it he said: \"The opponents of spontaneous\r\ngeneration assert that the germs of microscopic organisms exist\r\nin the air, which transports them to a distance. What, then, will\r\nthese opponents say if I succeed in introducing the generation of\r\nliving organisms, while substituting artificial air for that of the\r\natmosphere?\"\r\n\r\nHe filled a flask with boiling water and sealed it with great care.\r\nThis he inverted over a bath of mercury, thrusting the neck of the\r\nbottle into the mercury. When the water was cooled, he opened the\r\nneck of the bottle, still under the mercury, and connected it with\r\na chemical retort containing the constituents for the liberation of\r\noxygen. By heating the retort, oxygen was driven off from the chemical\r\nsalts contained in it, and being a gas, the oxygen passed through\r\nthe connecting tube and bubbled up through the water of the bottle,\r\naccumulating at the upper surface, and by pressure forcing water out\r\nof the bottle. After the bottle was about half filled with oxygen\r\nimprisoned above the water, Pouchet took a pinch of hay that had been\r\nheated to a high temperature in an oven, and with a pair of sterilized\r\nforceps pushed it underneath the mercury and into the mouth of the\r\nbottle, where the hay floated into the water and distributed itself.\r\n\r\nHe thus produced a hay infusion in contact with pure oxygen, and after\r\na few days this hay infusion was seen to be cloudy and turbid. It was,\r\nin fact, swarming with micro-organisms. Pouchet pointed with triumphant\r\nspirit to the apparently rigorous way in which his experiment had been\r\ncarried on: \"Where,\" said he, \"does this life come from? It can not\r\ncome from the water which had been boiled, destroying all living germs\r\nthat may have existed in it. It can not come from the oxygen which was\r\nproduced at the temperature of incandescence. It can not have been\r\ncarried in the hay, which had been heated for a long period before\r\nbeing introduced into the water.\" He declared that this life was,\r\ntherefore, of spontaneous origin.\r\n\r\nThe controversy now revived, and waxed warm under the insistence of\r\nPouchet and his adherents. Finally the Academy of Sciences, in the hope\r\nof bringing it to a conclusion, appointed a committee to decide upon\r\nconflicting claims.\r\n\r\nPasteur.--Pasteur had entered into the investigation of the subject\r\nabout 1860, and, with wonderful skill and acumen, was removing all\r\npossible grounds for the conclusions of Pouchet and his followers. In\r\n1864, before a brilliant audience at the Sorbonne, he repeated the\r\nexperiment outlined above and showed the source of error. In a darkened\r\nroom he directed a bright beam of light upon the apparatus, and his\r\nauditors could see in the intense illumination that the surface of the\r\nmercury was covered with dust particles. Pasteur then showed that when\r\na body was plunged beneath the mercury, some of these surface granules\r\nwere carried with it. In this striking manner Pasteur demonstrated\r\nthat particles from the outside had been introduced into the bottle of\r\nwater by Pouchet. This, however, is probably not the only source of\r\nthe organisms which were developed in Pouchet's infusions. It is now\r\nknown that a hay infusion is very difficult to sterilize by heat, and\r\nit is altogether likely that the infusions used by Pouchet were not\r\ncompletely sterilized.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of the question requires more critical methods than\r\nwas at first supposed, and more factors enter into its solution than\r\nwere realized by Spallanzani and Schwann.\r\n\r\nPasteur demonstrated that the floating particles of the air contained\r\nliving germs, by catching them in the meshes of gun cotton, and then\r\ndissolving the cotton with ether and examining the residue. He also\r\nshowed that sterilized organic fluids could be protected by a plug of\r\ncotton sufficiently porous to admit of exchange of air, but matted\r\nclosely enough to entangle the floating particles. He showed also that\r\nmany of the minute organisms do not require free oxygen for their life\r\nprocesses, but are able to take the oxygen by chemical decomposition\r\nwhich they themselves produce from the nutrient fluids.\r\n\r\nJeffries Wyman, of Harvard College, demonstrated that some germs are\r\nso resistant to heat that they retain their vitality after several\r\nhours of boiling. This fact probably accounts for the difference in\r\nthe results that have been obtained by experimenters. The germs in a\r\nresting-stage are surrounded by a thick protective coat of cellulose,\r\nwhich becomes softened and broken when they germinate. On this account\r\nmore recent experimenters have adopted a method of discontinuous\r\nheating of the nutrient fluid that is being tested. The fluids are\r\nboiled at intervals, so that the unusually resistant germs are killed\r\nafter the coating has been rendered soft, and when they are about to\r\ngerminate.\r\n\r\nAfter the brilliant researches of Pasteur, the question of spontaneous\r\ngermination was once again regarded as having been answered in the\r\nnegative; and so it is regarded to-day by the scientific world.\r\nNevertheless, attempts have been made from time to time, as by Bastian,\r\nof England, in 1872, to revive it on the old lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 91.--Apparatus of Tyndall for Experimenting on\r\nSpontaneous Generation.]\r\n\r\nTyndall.--John Tyndall (1820-1893), the distinguished physicist,\r\nof London, published, in 1876, the results of his experiments on\r\nthis question, which, for clearness and ingenuity, have never been\r\nsurpassed. For some time he had been experimenting in the domain of\r\nphysics with what he called optically pure air. It was necessary for\r\nhim to have air from which the floating particles had been sifted,\r\nand it occurred to him that he might expose nutrient fluids to this\r\noptically pure air, and thus very nicely test the question of the\r\nspontaneous origin of life within them.\r\n\r\nHe devised a box, or chamber, as shown in Fig. 91, having in front a\r\nlarge glass window, two small glass windows on the ends, and in the\r\nback a little air-tight trap-door. Through the bottom of this box\r\nhe had fitted ordinary test tubes of the chemist, with an air-tight\r\nsurrounding, and on the top he had inserted some coiled glass tubes,\r\nwhich were open at both ends and allowed the passage of air in and out\r\nof the box through the tortuous passage. In the middle of the top of\r\nthe box was a round piece of rubber. When he perforated this with a\r\npinhole the elasticity of the rubber would close the hole again, but\r\nit would also admit of the passage through it of a small glass tube,\r\nsuch as is called by chemists a \"thistle tube.\" The interior of this\r\nbox was painted with a sticky substance like glycerin, in order to\r\nretain the floating particles of the air when they had once settled\r\nupon its sides and bottom. The apparatus having been prepared in this\r\nway, was allowed to stand, and the floating particles settled by their\r\nown weight upon the bottom and sides of the box, so that day by day the\r\nnumber of floating particles became reduced, and finally all of them\r\ncame to rest.\r\n\r\nThe air now differed from the outside air in having been purified\r\nof all of its floating particles. In order to test the complete\r\ndisappearance of all particles. Tyndall threw a beam of light into the\r\nair chamber. He kept his eye in the darkness for some time in order\r\nto increase its sensitiveness; then, looking from the front through\r\nthe glass into the box, he was able to see any particles that might be\r\nfloating there. The floating particles would be brightly illuminated by\r\nthe condensed light that he directed into the chamber, and would become\r\nvisible. When there was complete darkness within the chamber, the\r\ncourse of the beam of light was apparent in the room as it came up to\r\nthe box and as it left the box, being seen on account of the reflection\r\nfrom the floating particles in the air, but it could not be seen at\r\nall within the box. When this condition was reached, Tyndall had what\r\nhe called optically pure air, and he was now ready to introduce the\r\nnutrient fluids into his test tubes. Through a thistle tube, thrust\r\ninto the rubber diaphragm above, he was able to bring the mouth of\r\nthe tube successively over the different test tubes, and, by pouring\r\ndifferent kinds of fluids from above, he was able to introduce these\r\ninto different test tubes. These fluids consisted of mutton broth, of\r\nturnip-broth, and other decoctions of animal and vegetable matter. It\r\nis to be noted that the test tubes were not corked and consequently\r\nthat the fluids contained within them were freely exposed to the\r\noptically pure air within the chamber.\r\n\r\nThe box was now lifted, and the ends of the tubes extending below it\r\nwere thrust into a bath of boiling oil. This set the fluids into a\r\nstate of boiling, the purpose being to kill any germs of life that\r\nmight be accidentally introduced into them in the course of their\r\nconveyance to the test tubes. These fluids, exposed freely to the\r\noptically pure air within this chamber, then remained indefinitely free\r\nfrom micro-organisms, thus demonstrating that putrescible fluids may\r\nbe freely exposed to air from which the floating particles have been\r\nremoved, and not show a trace either of spoiling or of organic life\r\nwithin them.\r\n\r\nIt might be objected that the continued boiling of the fluids had\r\nproduced chemical changes inimical to life, or in some way destroyed\r\ntheir life-supporting properties; but after they had remained for\r\nmonths in a perfectly clear state, Tyndall opened the little door in\r\nthe back of the box and closed it at once, thereby admitting some of\r\nthe floating particles from the outside air. Within a few days' time\r\nthe fluids which previously had remained uncontaminated were spoiling\r\nand teeming with living organisms.\r\n\r\nThese experiments showed that under the conditions of the experiments\r\nno spontaneous origin of life takes place. But while we must regard\r\nthe hypothesis of spontaneous generation as thus having been disproved\r\non an experimental basis, it is still adhered to from the theoretical\r\nstandpoint by many naturalists; and there are also many who think that\r\nlife arises spontaneously at the present time in ultra-microscopic\r\nparticles. Weismann's hypothetical \"biophors,\" too minute for\r\nmicroscopic observation, are supposed to arise by spontaneous\r\ngeneration. This phase of the question, however, not being amenable to\r\nscientific tests, is theoretical, and therefore, so far as the evidence\r\ngoes, we may safely say that the spontaneous origin of life under\r\npresent conditions is unknown.\r\n\r\nPractical Applications.--There are, of course, numerous practical\r\napplications of the discovery that the spoiling of putrescible fluids\r\nis due to floating germs that have been introduced from the air. One\r\nillustration is the canning of meats and fruits, where the object\r\nis, by heating, to destroy all living germs that are distributed\r\nthrough the substance, and then, by canning, to keep them out. When\r\nthis is entirely successful, the preserved vegetables and meats go\r\nuncontaminated. One of the most important and practical applications\r\ncame in the recognition (1867) by the English surgeon Lister that\r\nwounds during surgical operations are poisoned by floating particles\r\nin the air or by germs clinging to instruments or the skin of the\r\noperator, and that to render all appliances sterile and, by antiseptic\r\ndressings, completely to prevent the entrance of these bacteria into\r\nsurgical wounds, insures their being clean and healthy. This led to\r\nantiseptic surgery, with which the name of Lister is indissolubly\r\nconnected.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Germ-Theory of Disease\r\n\r\nThe germ-theory of disease is another question of general bearing, and\r\nit will be dealt with briefly here.\r\n\r\nAfter the discovery of bacteria by Leeuwenhoek, in 1687, some medical\r\nmen of the time suggested the theory that contagious diseases were due\r\nto microscopic forms of life that passed from the sick to the well.\r\nThis doctrine of _contagium vivum_, when first promulgated, took no\r\nfirm root, and gradually disappeared. It was not revived until about\r\n1840. If we attempt briefly to sketch the rise of the germ-theory of\r\ndisease, we come, then, first to the year 1837, when the Italian Bassi\r\ninvestigated the disease of silkworms, and showed that the transmission\r\nof that disease was the result of the passing of minute glittering\r\nparticles from the sick to the healthy. Upon the basis of Bassi's\r\nobservation, the distinguished anatomist Henle, in 1840, expounded the\r\ntheory that all contagious diseases are due to microscopic germs.\r\n\r\nThe matter, however, did not receive experimental proof until 1877,\r\nwhen Pasteur and Robert Koch showed the direct connection between\r\ncertain microscopic filaments and the disease of splenic fever, which\r\nattacks sheep and other cattle. Koch was able to get some of these\r\nminute filaments under the microscope, and to trace upon a warm stage\r\nthe different steps in their germination. He saw the spores bud and\r\nproduce filamentous forms. He was able to cultivate these upon a\r\nnutrient substance, gelatin, and in this way to obtain a pure culture\r\nof the organism, which is designated under the term anthrax. He\r\ninoculated mice with the pure culture of anthrax germs, and produced\r\nsplenic fever in the inoculated forms. He was able to do this through\r\nseveral generations of mice. In the same year Pasteur showed a similar\r\nconnection between splenic fever and the anthrax.\r\n\r\nThis demonstration of the actual connection between anthrax and splenic\r\nfever formed the first secure foundation of the germ-theory of disease,\r\nand this department of investigation became an important one in general\r\nbiology. The pioneer workers who reached the highest position in the\r\ndevelopment of this knowledge are Pasteur, Koch, and Lister.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92.--Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) and his\r\nGranddaughter.]\r\n\r\nVeneration of Pasteur.--Pasteur is one of the most conspicuous figures\r\nof the nineteenth century. The veneration in which he is held by the\r\nFrench people is shown in the result of a popular vote, taken in 1907,\r\nby which he was placed at the head of all their notable men. One\r\nof the most widely circulated of the French journals--the _Petit\r\nParisien_--appealed to its readers all over the country to vote upon\r\nthe relative prominence of great Frenchmen of the last century. Pasteur\r\nwas the winner of this interesting contest, having received 1,338,425\r\nvotes of the fifteen millions cast, and ranking above Victor Hugo,\r\nwho stood second in popular estimation, by more than one hundred\r\nthousand votes. This enviable recognition was won, not by spectacular\r\nachievements in arms or in politics, but by indefatigable industry in\r\nthe quiet pursuit of those scientific researches that have resulted in\r\nso much good to the human race.\r\n\r\nPersonal Qualities.--He should be known also from the side of his human\r\nqualities. He was devotedly attached to his family, enjoying the close\r\nsympathy and assistance of his wife and his daughter in his scientific\r\nstruggles, a circumstance that aided much in ameliorating the severity\r\nof his labors. His labors, indeed, overstrained his powers, so that\r\nhe was smitten by paralysis in 1868, at the age of forty-six, but\r\nwith splendid courage he overcame this handicap, and continued his\r\nunremitting work until his death in 1895.\r\n\r\nThe portrait of Pasteur with his granddaughter (Fig. 92) gives a touch\r\nof personal interest to the investigator and the contestant upon the\r\nfield of science. His strong face shows dignity of purpose and the grim\r\ndetermination which led to colossal attainments; at the same time it is\r\nmellowed by gentle affection, and contrasts finely with the trusting\r\nexpression of the younger face.\r\n\r\nPasteur was born of humble parents in Dôle in the Jura, on December\r\nthe 27th, 1822. His father was a tanner, but withal, a man of fine\r\ncharacter and stern experience, as is \"shown by the fact that he had\r\nfought in the legions of the First Empire and been decorated on the\r\nfield of battle by Napoleon.\" The filial devotion of Pasteur and his\r\njustifiable pride in his father's military service are shown in the\r\ndedication of his book, _Studies on Fermentation_, published in 1876:\r\n\r\n \"To the memory of my Father,\r\n\r\n Formerly a soldier under the First Empire, and Knight of the Legion of\r\n Honor.\r\n\r\n The longer I live, the better do I understand the kindness of thy\r\n heart and the superiority of thy judgment.\r\n\r\n The efforts which I have devoted to these studies and to those which\r\n have preceded them are the fruits of thy example and of thy counsel.\r\n\r\n Desiring to honor these precious recollections, I dedicate this book\r\n to thy memory.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Pasteur was an infant of two years his parents removed to the\r\ntown of Arbois, and here he spent his youth and received his early\r\neducation. After a period of indifference to study, during which he\r\nemployed his time chiefly in fishing and sketching, he settled down to\r\nwork, and, thereafter, showed boundless energy and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nPasteur, whom we are to consider as a biologist, won his first\r\nscientific recognition at the age of twenty-five, in chemistry and\r\nmolecular physics. He showed that crystals of certain tartrates,\r\nidentical in chemical composition, acted differently upon polarized\r\nlight transmitted through them. He concluded that the differences\r\nin optical properties depended upon a different arrangement of the\r\nmolecules; and these studies opened the fascinating field of molecular\r\nphysics and physical chemistry.\r\n\r\nPasteur might have remained in this field of investigation, but his\r\ndestiny was different. As Tyndall remarked, \"In the investigation of\r\nmicroscopic organisms--the 'infinitely little,' as Pasteur loved to\r\ncall them--and their doings in this, our world, Pasteur found his true\r\nvocation. In this broad field it has been his good fortune to alight\r\nupon a crowd of connected problems of the highest public and scientific\r\ninterest, ripe for solution, and requiring for their successful\r\ntreatment the precise culture and capacities which he has brought to\r\nbear upon them.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1857 Pasteur went to Paris as director of scientific studies in the\r\nÉcole Normale, having previously been a professor in Strasburg and in\r\nLille. From this time on his energies became more and more absorbed\r\nin problems of a biological nature. It was a momentous year (1857) in\r\nthe annals of bacteriology when Pasteur brought convincing proof that\r\nfermentation (then considered chemical in its nature) was due to the\r\ngrowth of organic life. Again in 1860 he demonstrated that both lactic\r\n(the souring of milk) and alcoholic fermentation are due to the growth\r\nof microscopic organisms, and by these researches he developed the\r\nprovince of biology that has expanded into the science of bacteriology.\r\n\r\nAfter Pasteur entered the path of investigation of microbes his\r\nprogress was by ascending steps; each new problem the solution of which\r\nhe undertook seemed of greater importance than the one just conquered.\r\nHe was led from the discovery of microbe action to the application\r\nof his knowledge to the production of antitoxins. In all this he did\r\nnot follow his own inclinations so much as his sense of a call to\r\nservice. In fact, he always retained a regret that he was not permitted\r\nto perfect his researches on crystallography. At the age of seventy\r\nhe said of himself: \"If I have a regret, it is that I did not follow\r\nthat route, less rude it seems to me, and which would have led, I am\r\nconvinced, to wonderful discoveries. A sudden turn threw me into the\r\nstudy of fermentation, fermentations set me at diseases, but I am still\r\ninconsolable to think that I have never had the time to go back to my\r\nold subject\" (Tarbell).\r\n\r\nAlthough the results of his combined researches form a succession\r\nof triumphs, every point of his doctrines was the subject of fierce\r\ncontroversy; no investigations ever met with more determined\r\nopposition, no investigator ever fought more strenuously for the\r\nestablishment of each new truth.\r\n\r\nHe went from the study of the diseases of wines (1865) to the\r\ninvestigation (1865-1868) of the silkworm plague which had well-nigh\r\ncrushed the silk industry of his country. The result was the saving of\r\nmillions of francs annually to the people of France.\r\n\r\nHis Supreme Service.--He then entered upon his chief services\r\nto humanity--the application of his discoveries to the cure and\r\nprevention of diseases. By making a succession of pure cultures of a\r\ndisease-producing virus, he was able to attenuate it to any desired\r\ndegree, and thereby to create a vaccinating form of the virus capable\r\nof causing a mild affection of the disease. The injection of this\r\nattenuated virus secured immunity from future attacks. The efficacy\r\nof this form of inoculation was first proved for the disease of fowl\r\ncholera, and then came the clear demonstration (1881) that the vaccine\r\nwas effective against the splenic fever of cattle. Crowning this series\r\nof discoveries came the use of inoculation (1885) to prevent the\r\ndevelopment of hydrophobia in one bitten by a mad dog.\r\n\r\nThe Pasteur Institute.--The time had now come for the establishment\r\nof an institute, not alone for the treatment of hydrophobia, but\r\nalso for the scientific study of means to control other diseases, as\r\ndiphtheria, typhoid, tuberculosis, etc. A movement was set on foot for\r\na popular subscription to meet this need. The response to this call\r\non the part of the common people was gratifying. \"The extraordinary\r\nenthusiasm which accompanied the foundation of this great institution\r\nhas certainly not been equaled in our time. Considerable sums of money\r\nwere subscribed in foreign countries, while contributions poured in\r\nfrom every part of France. Even the inhabitants of obscure little\r\ntowns and villages organized fêtes, and clubbed together to send their\r\nsmall gifts\" (Franckland). The total sum subscribed on the date of the\r\nopening ceremony amounted to 3,586,680 francs.\r\n\r\nThe institute was formally opened on November 14th, 1888, with\r\nimpressive ceremonies presided over by the President of the Republic\r\nof France. The establishment of this institute was an event of\r\ngreat scientific importance. Here, within the first decade of its\r\nexistence, were successfully treated more than twenty thousand cases\r\nof hydrophobia. Here has been discovered by Roux the antitoxin\r\nfor diphtheria, and here have been established the principles of\r\ninoculation against the bubonic plague, against lockjaw, against\r\ntuberculosis and other maladies, and of the recent microbe inoculations\r\nof Wright of London. More than thirty \"Pasteur institutes,\" with aims\r\nsimilar to the parent institution, have been established in different\r\nparts of the civilized world.\r\n\r\nPasteur died in 1895, greatly honored by the whole world. On Saturday,\r\nOctober 5th of that year, a national funeral was conducted in the\r\nChurch of Notre-Dame, which was attended by the representatives of the\r\nstate and of numerous scientific bodies and learned societies.\r\n\r\nKoch.--Robert Koch (Fig. 93) was born in 1843, and is still living,\r\nengaged actively in work in the University of Berlin. His studies\r\nhave been mainly those of a medical man, and have been crowned with\r\nremarkable success. In 1881 he discovered the germ of tuberculosis, in\r\n1883 the germ that produces Asiatic cholera, and since that time his\r\nname has been connected with a number of remarkable discoveries that\r\nare of continuous practical application in the science of medicine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 93.--Robert Koch, Born 1843.]\r\n\r\nKoch, with the rigorous scientific spirit for which he is noteworthy,\r\nestablished four necessary links in the chain of evidence to show that\r\na particular organism is connected with a particular disease. These\r\nfour postulates of Koch are: First, that a microscopic organism of a\r\nparticular type should be found in great abundance in the blood and\r\nthe tissue of the sick animal; second, that a pure culture should be\r\nmade of the suspected organism; third, that this pure culture, when\r\nintroduced into the body of another animal, should produce the disease;\r\nand, fourth, that in the blood and tissues of that animal there should\r\nbe found quantities of the particular organism that is suspected of\r\nproducing the disease. In the case of some diseases this entire chain\r\nof evidence has been established; but in others, such as cholera and\r\ntyphoid fever, the last steps have not been completed, for the reason\r\nthat the animals experimented upon, namely, guinea-pigs, rabbits, and\r\nmice, are not susceptible to these diseases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94.--Sir Joseph Lister, Born 1827.]\r\n\r\nLister.--The other member of the great triumvirate of bacteriology is\r\nSir Joseph Lister (Fig. 94); born in 1827, he has been successively\r\nprofessor of surgery in the universities of Glasgow (1860) and of\r\nEdinburgh (1869), and in King's College, London (1877). His practical\r\napplication of the germ-theory introduced aseptic methods into surgery\r\nand completely revolutionized that field. This was in 1867. In an\r\naddress given that year before the British Medical Association in\r\nDublin, he said: \"When it had been shown by the researches of Pasteur\r\nthat the septic property of the atmosphere depended, not on oxygen\r\nor any gaseous constituent, but on minute organisms suspended in it,\r\nwhich owed their energy to their vitality, it occurred to me that\r\ndecomposition in the injured part might be avoided without excluding\r\nthe air, by applying as a dressing some material capable of destroying\r\nthe life of the floating particles.\" At first he used carbolic acid\r\nfor this purpose. \"The wards of which he had charge in the Glasgow\r\nInfirmary were especially affected by gangrene, but in a short time\r\nbecame the healthiest in the world; while other wards separated by a\r\npassageway retained their infection.\" The method of Lister has been\r\nuniversally adopted, and at the same time has been greatly extended and\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nThe question of immunity, _i.e._, the reason why after having had\r\ncertain contagious diseases one is rendered immune, is of very great\r\ninterest, but is of medical bearing, and therefore is not dealt with\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nBacteria and Nitrates.--One further illustration of the connection\r\nbetween bacteria and practical affairs may be mentioned. It is well\r\nknown that animals are dependent upon plants, and that plants in the\r\nmanufacture of protoplasm make use of certain nitrites and nitrates\r\nwhich they obtain from the soil. Now, the source of these nitrites\r\nand nitrates is very interesting. In animals the final products of\r\nbroken-down protoplasm are carbon dioxide, water, and a nitrogenous\r\nsubstance called urea. These products are called excretory products.\r\nThe animal machine is unable to utilize the energy which exists in the\r\nform of potential energy in these substances, and they are removed from\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nThe history of nitrogenous substance is the one which at present\r\ninterests us the most. Entering the soil, it is there acted upon by\r\nbacteria residing in the soil, these bacteria possessing the power of\r\nmaking use of the lowest residuum of energy left in the nitrogenous\r\nsubstance. They cause the nitrogen and the hydrogen to unite with\r\noxygen in such a way that there are produced nitrous and nitric\r\nacids, and from these two acids, through chemical action, result the\r\nnitrites and the nitrates. These substances are then utilized by the\r\nplant in the manufacture of protoplasm, and the plant is fed upon by\r\nanimal organisms, so that a direct relationship is established between\r\nthese lower forms of life and the higher plant and animal series; a\r\nrelationship that is not only interesting, but that helps to throw an\r\nimportant side-light upon the general nature of vital activities, their\r\nkind and their reach. In addition to the soil bacteria mentioned above,\r\nthere are others that form association with the rootlets of certain\r\nplants and possess the power of fixing free nitrogen from the air.\r\n\r\nThe nitrifying bacteria, are, of course, of great importance to the\r\nfarmer and the agriculturist.\r\n\r\nIt is not our purpose, however, to trace the different phases of the\r\nsubject of bacteriology to their conclusions, but rather to give a\r\npicture of the historical development of this subject as related to the\r\nbroader one of general biology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nHEREDITY AND GERMINAL CONTINUITY--MENDEL, GALTON, WEISMANN\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of common observation that in the living world like\r\ntends to produce like. The offspring of plants, as well as of animals,\r\nresembles the parent, and among all organisms endowed with mind, the\r\nmental as well as the physical qualities are inherited. This is a\r\nsimple statement of the fact of heredity, but the scientific study of\r\ninheritance involves deep-seated biological questions that emerged late\r\nin the nineteenth century, and the subject is still in its infancy.\r\n\r\nIn investigating this question, we need first, if possible, to locate\r\nthe bearers of hereditary qualities within the physical substance that\r\nconnects one generation with the next; then, to study their behavior\r\nduring the transmission of life in order to account for the inheritance\r\nof both maternal and paternal qualities; and, lastly, to determine\r\nwhether or not transiently acquired characteristics are inherited.\r\n\r\nHereditary Qualities in the Germinal Elements.--When we take into\r\nconsideration the fact established for all animals and plants (setting\r\naside cases of budding and the division of unicellular organisms),\r\nthat the only substance that passes from one generation to another is\r\nthe egg and the sperm in animals, and their representatives in plants,\r\nwe see that the first question is narrowed to these bodies. If all\r\nhereditary qualities are carried in the egg and the sperm--as it seems\r\nthey must be--then it follows that these germinal elements, although\r\nmicroscopic in size, have a very complex organization. The discovery\r\nof this organization must depend upon microscopic examination.\r\nKnowledge regarding the physical basis of heredity has been greatly\r\nadvanced by critical studies of cells under the microscope and by the\r\napplication of experimental methods, while other phases of the problems\r\nof inheritance have been elucidated by the analysis of statistics\r\nregarding hereditary transmissions. The whole question, however,\r\nis so recent that a clear formulation of the direction of the main\r\ncurrents of progress will be more helpful than any attempt to estimate\r\ncritically the underlying principles.\r\n\r\nEarly Theories.--There were speculations regarding the nature of\r\ninheritance in ancient and mediæval times. To mention any of them\r\nprior to the eighteenth century would serve no useful purpose, since\r\nthey were vague and did not form the foundation upon which the\r\nmodern theories were built. The controversies over pre-formation and\r\nepigenesis (see Chapter X) of the eighteenth century embodied some\r\nideas that have been revived. The recent conclusion that there is in\r\nthe germinal elements an inherited organization of great complexity\r\nwhich conditions inheritance seems, at first, to be a return to the\r\ndoctrine of pre-formation, but closer examination shows that there is\r\nmerely a general resemblance between the ideas expressed by Haller,\r\nBonnet, and philosophers of their time and those current at the present\r\ntime. Inherited organization, as now understood, is founded on the idea\r\nof germinal continuity and is vastly different from the old theory of\r\npre-formation. The meaning of epigenesis, as expressed by Wolff, has\r\nalso been modified to include the conception of pre-localization of\r\nhereditary qualities within particular parts of the egg. It has come\r\nnow to mean that development is a process of differentiation of certain\r\nqualities already laid down in the germinal elements.\r\n\r\nDarwin's Theory of Pangenesis.--In attempting to account for heredity,\r\nDarwin saw clearly the necessity of providing some means of getting all\r\nhereditary qualities combined within the egg and the sperm. Accordingly\r\nhe originated his provisional theory of pangenesis. Keeping in mind the\r\nfact that all organisms begin their lives in the condition of single\r\ncells, the idea of inheritance through these microscopic particles\r\nbecomes difficult to understand. How is it possible to conceive of all\r\nthe hereditary qualities being contained within the microscopic germ of\r\nthe future being? Darwin supposed that very minute particles, which he\r\ncalled gemmules, were set free from all the cells in the body, those of\r\nthe muscular system, of the nervous system, of the bony tissues, and\r\nof all other tissues contributing their part. These liberated gemmules\r\nwere supposed to be carried by the circulation and ultimately to be\r\naggregated within the germinal elements (ovum and sperm). Thus the\r\ngerminal elements would be a composite of substances derived from all\r\norgans and all tissues.\r\n\r\nWith this conception of the blending of the parental qualities\r\nwithin the germinal elements we can conceive how inheritance would\r\nbe possible and how there might be included in the egg and the sperm\r\na representative in material substance of all the qualities of the\r\nparents. Since development begins in a fertilized ovum, this complex\r\nwould contain minute particles derived from every part of the bodies of\r\nboth parents, which by growth would give rise to new tissues, all of\r\nthem containing representatives of the tissues of the parent form.\r\n\r\nTheory of Pangenesis Replaced by that of Germinal Continuity.--This\r\ntheory of Darwin served as the basis for other theories founded\r\nupon the conception of the existence of pangens; and although the\r\nmodifications of Spencer, Brooks, and others were important, it is not\r\nnecessary to indicate them in detail in order to understand what is to\r\nfollow. The various theories founded upon the idea of pangens were\r\ndestined to be replaced by others founded on the conception of germinal\r\ncontinuity--the central idea in nineteenth-century biology.\r\n\r\nThe four chief steps which have led to the advancement of the knowledge\r\nof heredity, as suggested by Thomson, are as follows: \"(a) The\r\nexposition of the doctrine of germinal continuity, (b) More precise\r\ninvestigation of the material basis of inheritance, (c) Suspicions\r\nregarding the inheritance of acquired characteristics, (d) Application\r\nof statistical methods which have led to the formulation of the law of\r\nancestral heredity.\" We shall take these up in order.\r\n\r\nExposition of the Doctrine of Germinal Continuity.--From parent to\r\noffspring there passes some hereditary substance; although small in\r\namount, it is the only living thread that connects one generation with\r\nanother. It thus appears that there enters into the building of the\r\nbody of a new organism some of the actual substance of both parents,\r\nand that this transmitted substance must be the bearer of hereditary\r\nqualities. Does it also contain some characteristics inherited from\r\ngrandparents and previous generations? If so, how far back in the\r\nhistory of the race does unbroken continuity extend?\r\n\r\nBriefly stated, genetic continuity means that the ovum and its\r\nfertilizing agent are derived by continuous cell-lineage from the\r\nfertilized ovum of previous generations, extending back to the\r\nbeginning of life. The first clear exposition of this theory occurs\r\nin the classical work of Virchow on _Cellular Pathology_, published\r\nin 1858. Virchow (1821-1902), the distinguished professor of the\r\nUniversity of Berlin, has already been spoken of in connection with\r\nthe development of histology. He took the step of overthrowing the\r\ntheory of free cell-formation, and replacing it by the doctrine of\r\ncell-succession. According to the theory of Schleiden and Schwann,\r\ncells arose from a blastema by a condensation of matter around\r\na nucleus, and the medical men prior to 1858 believed in free\r\ncell-formation within a matrix of secreted or excreted substance. This\r\ndoctrine was held with tenacity especially for pathological growths.\r\nVirchow demonstrated, however, that there is a continuity of living\r\nsubstance in all growths--that cells, both in health and in disease,\r\narise only by the growth and division of previously existing living\r\ncells; and to express this truth he coined the formula \"_omnis cellula\r\ne cellula_.\" Manifestly it was necessary to establish this law of\r\ncell-succession before any idea of germinal continuity could prevail.\r\nVirchow's work in this connection is of undying value.\r\n\r\nWhen applied to inheritance the idea of the continuity of living\r\nsubstance leads to making a distinction between germ-cells and\r\nbody-cells. This had been done before the observations of Virchow\r\nmade their separation of great theoretical value. Richard Owen, in\r\n1849, pointed out certain differences between the body-cells and the\r\ngerminal elements, but he did not follow up the distinction which he\r\nmade. Haeckel's _General Morphology_, published in 1866, forecasts the\r\nidea also, and in 1878 Jaeger made use of the phrase \"continuity of the\r\ngerm protoplasm.\" Other suggestions and modifications led to the clear\r\nexpression by Nussbaum, about 1875, that the germinal substance was\r\ncontinued by unbroken generations from the past, and is the particular\r\nsubstance in which all hereditary qualities are included. But the\r\nconception finds its fullest expression in the work of Weismann.\r\n\r\nWeismann's explanation of heredity is at first sight relatively simple.\r\nIn reply to the question, \"Why is the offspring like the parent?\" he\r\nsays, \"Because it is composed of some of the same stuff.\" In other\r\nwords, there has been unbroken germinal continuity between generations.\r\nHis idea of germinal continuity, _i.e._, unbroken continuity, through\r\nall time, of the germinal substance, is a conception of very great\r\nextent, and now underlies all discussion of heredity.\r\n\r\nIn order to comprehend it, we must first distinguish between the\r\ngerm-cells and the body-cells. Weismann regards the body, composed of\r\nits many cells, as a derivative that becomes simply a vehicle for the\r\ngerm-cells. Owen's distinction between germ-cells and body-cells, made\r\nin 1849, was not of much importance, but in the theory of Weismann it\r\nis of vital significance. The germ-cells are the particular ones which\r\ncarry forward from generation to generation the life of the individual.\r\nThe body-cells are not inherited directly, but in the transmission of\r\nlife the germ-cells pass to the succeeding generation, and they in\r\nturn have been inherited from the previous generation, and, therefore,\r\nwe have the phenomenon of an unbroken connection with all previous\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nWhen the full significance of this conception comes to us, we see\r\nwhy the germ-cells have an inherited organization of remarkable\r\ncomplexity. This germinal substance embodies all the past history of\r\nthe living, impressionable protoplasm, which has had an unbroken series\r\nof generations. During all time it has been subjected to the molding\r\ninfluence of external circumstances to which it has responded, so that\r\nthe summation of its experiences becomes in some way embedded within\r\nits material substance. Thus we have the germinal elements possessing\r\nan inherited organization made up of all the previous experiences of\r\nthe protoplasm, some of which naturally are much more dominant than the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that this idea was not first expressed by Weismann; it\r\nwas a modification of the views of Nussbaum and Hertwig. While it\r\nwas not his individually, his conclusions were apparently reached\r\nindependently. This idea was in the intellectual atmosphere of the\r\ntimes. Several investigators reached their conclusions independently,\r\nalthough there is great similarity between them. Although the credit\r\nfor the first formulation of the law of germinal continuity does not\r\nbelong to Weismann, that of the greatest elaboration of it does. This\r\ndoctrine of germinal continuity is now so firmly embedded in biological\r\nideas of inheritance and the evolution of animal life that we may say\r\nit has become the corner-stone of modern biology.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion reached--that the hereditary substance is the\r\ngerm-plasm--is merely preliminary; the question remains, Is the\r\ngerm-plasm homogeneous and endowed equally in all parts with a mixture\r\nof hereditary qualities? This leads to the second step.\r\n\r\nThe More Precise Investigation of the Material Basis of\r\nInheritance.--The application of the microscope to critical studies of\r\nthe structure of the germ-plasm has brought important results which\r\nmerge with the development of the idea of germinal continuity. Can we\r\nby actual observation determine the particular part of the protoplasmic\r\nsubstance that carries the hereditary qualities? The earliest answer\r\nto this question was that the protoplasm, being the living substance,\r\nwas the bearer of heredity. But close analysis of the behavior of\r\nthe nucleus during development led, about 1875, to the idea that the\r\nhereditary qualities are located within the nucleus of the cell.\r\n\r\nThis idea, promulgated by Fol, Koelliker, and Oskar Hertwig, narrowed\r\nthe attention of students of heredity from the general protoplasmic\r\ncontents of the cell to the nucleus. Later investigations show that\r\nthis restriction was, in a measure, right. The nucleus takes an active\r\npart during cell-division, and it was very natural to reach the\r\nconclusion that it is the particular bearer of hereditary substance.\r\nBut, in 1883, Van Beneden and Boveri made the discovery that within\r\nthe nucleus are certain distinct little rod-like bodies which make\r\ntheir appearance during cell-division. These little bodies, inasmuch\r\nas they stain very deeply with the dyes used in microscopic research,\r\nare called chromosomes. And continued investigation brought out the\r\nastounding fact that, although the number of chromosomes vary in\r\ndifferent animals (commonly from two to twenty-four), they are of the\r\nsame number in all the cells of any particular animal or plant. These\r\nchromosomes are regarded as the bearers of heredity, and their behavior\r\nduring fertilization and development has been followed with great care.\r\n\r\nBrilliant studies of the formation of the egg have shown that the\r\negg nucleus, in the process of becoming mature, surrenders one-half\r\nits number of chromosomes; it approaches the surface of the egg and\r\nundergoes division, squeezing out one-half of its substance in the\r\nform of a polar globule; and this process is once repeated.[8] The\r\nformation of polar globules is accompanied by a noteworthy process of\r\nreduction in the number of chromosomes, so that when the egg nucleus\r\nhas reached its mature condition it contains only one-half the number\r\nof chromosomes characteristic of the species, and will not ordinarily\r\nundergo development without fertilization.\r\n\r\nThe precise steps in the formation of the sperm have also been studied,\r\nand it has been determined that a parallel series of changes occur. The\r\nsperm, when it is fully formed, contains also one-half the number of\r\nchromosomes characteristic of the species. Now, egg and sperm are the\r\ntwo germinal elements which unite in development. Fertilization takes\r\nplace by the union of sperm and egg, and inasmuch as the nuclei of\r\neach of these structures contain one-half of the number of chromosomes\r\ncharacteristic of the species, their union in fertilization results in\r\nthe restoration of the original number of chromosomes. The fertilized\r\novum is the starting-point of a new organism, and from the method of\r\nits fertilization it appears that the parental qualities are passed\r\nalong to the cells of every tissue.\r\n\r\nThe complex mechanism exhibited in the nucleus during segmentation\r\nis very wonderful. The fertilized ovum begins to divide, the nucleus\r\npassing through a series of complicated changes whereby its chromosomes\r\nundergo a lengthwise division--a division that secures an equable\r\npartition of the substance of which they are composed. With each\r\nsuccessive division, this complicated process is repeated, and the\r\nmany cells, arising from continued segmentation of the original cell,\r\ncontain nuclei in which are embedded descendants of the chromosomes in\r\nunbroken succession. Moreover, since these chromosomes are bi-parental,\r\nwe can readily understand that every cell in the body carries both\r\nmaternal and paternal qualities.\r\n\r\nThe careful analysis of the various changes within the nuclei of the\r\negg proves to be the key to some of the central questions of heredity.\r\nWe see the force of the point which was made in a previous chapter,\r\nthat inheritance is in the long run a cellular study, and we see in a\r\nnew light the importance of the doctrine of germinal continuity. This\r\nconception, in fact, elucidates the general problem of inheritance in a\r\nway in which it has never been elucidated by any other means.\r\n\r\nFor some time the attention of investigators was concentrated\r\nupon the nucleus and the chromosomes, but it is now necessary to\r\nadmit that the basis of some structures is discoverable within the\r\ncytoplasm that surrounds the nucleus. Experimental observations\r\n(Conklin, Lillie, Wilson) have shown the existence of particular areas\r\nwithin the apparently simple substance of the egg, areas which are\r\ndefinitely related to the development of particular parts of the\r\nembryo. The removal of any one of these pre-localized areas prevents\r\nthe development of the part with which it is genetically related.\r\nResearches of this kind, necessitating great ingenuity in method and\r\ngreat talents in the observers, are widening the field of observation\r\nupon the phenomena of heredity.\r\n\r\nThe Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics.--The belief in the\r\ninheritance of acquired characteristics was generally accepted up to\r\nthe middle of the nineteenth century, but the reaction against it\r\nstarted by Galton and others has assumed great proportions. Discussions\r\nin this line have been carried on extensively, and frequently in the\r\nspirit of great partizanship. These discussions cluster very much about\r\nthe name and the work of Weismann, the man who has consistently stood\r\nagainst the idea of acquired characteristics. More in reference to this\r\nphase of the question is given in the chapter dealing with Weismann's\r\ntheory of evolution (see p. 398). Wherever the truth may lie, the\r\ndiscussions regarding the inheritance of acquired characteristics\r\nprovoked by Weismann's theoretical considerations, have resulted\r\nin stimulating experiment and research, and have, therefore, been\r\nbeneficial to the advance of science.\r\n\r\nThe Application of Statistical Methods and Experiments to the Ideas\r\nof Heredity. Mendel.--This feature of investigating questions of\r\nheredity is of growing importance. The first to complete experiments\r\nand to investigate heredity to any purpose was the Austrian monk Mendel\r\n(1822-1884) (Fig. 95), the abbot of a monastery at Brünn. In his garden\r\nhe made many experiments upon the inheritance, particularly in peas,\r\nof color and of form; and through these experiments he demonstrated a\r\nlaw of inheritance which bids fair to be one of the great biological\r\ndiscoveries of the nineteenth century. He published his papers in 1866\r\nand 1867, but since the minds of naturalists at that time were very\r\nmuch occupied with the questions of organic evolution, raised through\r\nthe publications of Darwin, the ideas of Mendel attracted very little\r\nattention. The principles that he established were re-discovered in\r\n1900 by De Vries and other botanists, and thus naturalists were led to\r\nlook up the work of Mendel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95.--Gregor Mendel, 1822-1884.\r\n\r\nPermission of Professor Bateson.]\r\n\r\nThe great discovery of Mendel may be called that of the purity of\r\nthe germ-cells. By cross-fertilization of pure breeds of peas of\r\ndifferent colors and shapes he obtained hybrids. The hybrid embodied\r\nthe characteristics of the crossed peas; one of the characteristics\r\nappearing, and the other being held in abeyance--present within the\r\norganization of the pea, but not visible. When peas of different\r\ncolor were cross-fertilized, one color would be stronger apparently\r\nthan the other, and would stand out in the hybrids. This was called\r\nthe dominant color. The other, which was held in abeyance, was called\r\nrecessive; for, though unseen, it was still present within the young\r\nseeds. That the recessive color was not blotted out was clearly shown\r\nby raising a crop from the hybrid, a condition under which they would\r\nproduce seeds like those of the two original forms, and in equal\r\nnumber; and thereafter the descendants of these peas would breed true.\r\nThis so-called purity of the germ-cells, then, may be expressed in this\r\nway: \"The hybrid, whatever its own character, produces ripe germ-cells,\r\nwhich produce only the pure character of one parent or of the other\"\r\n(Castle).\r\n\r\nAlthough Mendel's discovery was for a long time overlooked, happily\r\nthe facts were re-discovered, and at the present time extensive\r\nexperiments are being made with animals to test this law: experiments\r\nin the inheritance of poultry, the inheritance of fur in guinea-pigs,\r\nof erectness in the ears of rabbits, etc., etc. In this country the\r\nexperiments of Castle, Davenport, and others with animals tend to\r\nsupport Mendel's conclusion and lift it to the position of a law.\r\n\r\nRank of Mendel's Discovery.--The discovery by Mendel of alternative\r\ninheritance will rank as one of the greatest discoveries in the study\r\nof heredity. The fact that in cross-breeding the parental qualities are\r\nnot blended, but that they retain their individuality in the offspring,\r\nhas many possible practical applications both in horticulture and\r\nin the breeding of animals. The germ-cells of the hybrids have the\r\ndominant and the recessive characters about equally divided; this will\r\nappear in the progeny of the second generation, and the races, when\r\nonce separated, may be made to breed true.\r\n\r\nMendel's name was not recognized as a prominent one in the annals of\r\nbiological history until the re-discovery of his law in 1900; but now\r\nhe is accorded high rank. It may be remarked in passing that the three\r\nleading names in the development of the theories of heredity are those\r\nof Mendel, Galton, and Weismann.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96.--Francis Galton, Born 1822.]\r\n\r\nGalton.--The application of statistical methods is well illustrated in\r\nthe theories of Francis Galton (Fig. 96). This distinguished English\r\nstatistician was born in 1822, and is still living. He is the grandson\r\nof Dr. Erasmus Darwin and the cousin of Charles. After publishing books\r\non his travels in Africa, he began the experimental study of heredity\r\nand, in 1871, he read before the Royal Society of London a paper on\r\nPangenesis, in which he departed from that theory as developed by\r\nDarwin. The observations upon which he based his conclusions were made\r\nupon the transfusion of blood in rabbits and their after-breeding. He\r\nstudied the inheritance of stature, and other characteristics, in human\r\nfamilies, and the inheritance of spots on the coat of certain hounds,\r\nand was led to formulate a law of ancestral inheritance which received\r\nits clearest expression in his book, _Natural Inheritance_, published\r\nin 1889.\r\n\r\nHe undertook to determine the proportion of heritage that is, on the\r\naverage, contributed by each parent, grandparent, etc., and arrived at\r\nthe following conclusions: \"The parents together contribute one-half\r\nthe total heritage, the four grandparents together one-fourth, the\r\neight great-grandparents one-sixteenth, and all the remainder of the\r\nancestry one-sixteenth.\"\r\n\r\nCarl Pearson has investigated this law of ancestral inheritance. He\r\nsubstantiates the law in its principle, but modifies slightly the\r\nmathematical expression of it.\r\n\r\nThis field of research, which involves measurements and mathematics\r\nand the handling of large bodies of statistics, has been considerably\r\ncultivated, so that there is in existence in England a journal devoted\r\nexclusively to biometrics, which is edited by Carl Pearson, and is\r\nentitled _Biometrika_.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject of heredity is undergoing a thorough revision.\r\nWhat seems to be most needed at the present time is more exact\r\nexperimentation, carried through several generations, together with\r\nmore searching investigations into the microscopical constitution\r\nof egg and sperm, and close analysis of just what takes place\r\nduring fertilization and the early stages of the development of the\r\nindividual. Experiments are being conducted on an extended scale in\r\nendowed institutions. There is notably in this country, established\r\nunder the Carnegie Institution, a station for experimental evolution,\r\nat Cold Spring Harbor, New York, of which C.B. Davenport is director.\r\nOther experimental stations in England and on the Continent have been\r\nestablished, and we are to expect as the result of coördinated and\r\ncontinuous experimental work many substantial contributions to the\r\nknowledge of inheritance.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: There are a few exceptions to this rule, as in the eggs of\r\nplant-lice, etc., in which a single polar globule is produced.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENCE OF FOSSIL LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt gradually dawned on the minds of men that the crust of the earth is\r\nlike a gigantic mausoleum, containing within it the remains of numerous\r\nand varied forms of life that formerly existed upon the surface of the\r\nearth. The evidence is clear that untold generations of living forms,\r\nnow preserved as fossils, inhabited the earth, disported themselves,\r\nand passed away long before the advent of man. The knowledge of this\r\nfossil life, on account of its great diversity, is an essential part\r\nof biology, and all the more so from the circumstance that many forms\r\nof life, remains of which are exhibited in the rocks, have long since\r\nbecome extinct. No history of biology would be complete without an\r\naccount of the rise and progress of that department of biology which\r\ndeals with fossil life.\r\n\r\nIt has been determined by collecting and systematically studying the\r\nremains of this ancient life that they bear testimony to a long,\r\nunbroken history in which the forms of both animals and plants have\r\nbeen greatly altered. The more ancient remains are simple in structure,\r\nand form with the later ones, a series that exhibits a gradually\r\nincreasing complexity of structure. The study of the fossil series has\r\nbrought about a very great extension of our knowledge regarding the age\r\nof the world and of the conditions under which life was evolved.\r\n\r\nStrange Views Regarding Fossils.--But this state of our knowledge\r\nwas a long time coming, and in the development of the subject we\r\ncan recognize several distinct epochs, \"well-marked by prominent\r\nfeatures, but like all stages of intellectual growth, without definite\r\nboundaries.\" Fossils were known to the ancients, and by some of the\r\nforemost philosophers of Greece were understood to be the remains of\r\nanimals and plants. After the revival of learning, however, lively\r\ncontroversies arose as to their nature and their meaning.\r\n\r\nSome of the fantastic ideas that were entertained regarding the nature\r\nof fossil remains may be indicated. The fossils were declared by many\r\nto be freaks of nature; others maintained that they were the results\r\nof spontaneous generation, and were produced by the plastic forces of\r\nnature within the rocks in which they were found embedded. Another\r\nopinion expressed was that they were generated by fermentations. As the\r\nhistory of intellectual development shows, the mind has ever seemed\r\nbenumbed in the face of phenomena that are completely misconceived;\r\nmystical explanations have accordingly been devised to account for\r\nthem. Some of the pious persons of that period declared that fossils\r\nhad been made and distributed by the Creator in pursuance of a plan\r\nbeyond our comprehension. Another droll opinion expressed was that\r\nthe Creator in His wisdom had introduced fossil forms into the rocks\r\nin order that they should be a source of confusion to the race of\r\ngeologists that was later to arise.\r\n\r\nAnd still another fantastic conception suggested that the fossils\r\nwere the original molds used by the Creator in forming different\r\nvarieties of animals and plants, some of which had been used and others\r\ndiscarded. It was supposed that in preparing for the creation of life\r\nHe experimented and discarded some of His earliest attempts; and that\r\nfossils represented these discarded molds and also, perhaps, some that\r\nhad been used in fashioning the created forms.\r\n\r\nWhen large bones, as of fossil elephants, began to be exhumed, they\r\nbecame for the most part the objects of stupid wonder. The passage in\r\nthe Scriptures was pointed out, that \"there were giants in those days,\"\r\nand the bones were taken to be evidences of the former existence of\r\ngiants. The opinions expressed regarding the fossil bones were varied\r\nand fantastic, \"some saying that they were rained from Heaven, others\r\nsaying that they were the gigantic limbs of the ancient patriarchs,\r\nmen who were believed to be tall because they were known to be old.\"\r\nFollowing out this idea, \"Henrion in 1718 published a work in which\r\nhe assigned to Adam a height of 123 feet 9 inches, Noah being 20 feet\r\nshorter, and so on.\"\r\n\r\nDetermination of the Nature of Fossils.--In due course it came to\r\nbe recognized that fossils were the remains of forms that had been\r\nalive during earlier periods of time; but in reaching this position\r\nthere was continual controversy. Objections were especially vigorous\r\nfrom theological quarters, since such a conclusion was deemed to be\r\ncontradictory to the Scriptures. The true nature of fossils had been\r\nclearly perceived by Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) and certain others\r\nin the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe work, however, that approached more nearly to scientific\r\ndemonstration was that of Steno (1638-1686), a Dane who migrated to\r\nItaly and became the court physician to the dukes of Tuscany. He was a\r\nversatile man who had laid fast hold upon the new learning of his day.\r\nEminent as anatomist, physiologist, and physician, with his ever active\r\nmind he undertook to encompass all learning. It is interesting that\r\nSteno--or Stensen--after being passionately devoted to science, became\r\nequally devoted to religion and theology, and, forsaking all scientific\r\npursuits, took orders and returned to his native country with the title\r\nof bishop. Here he worked in the service of humanity and religion to\r\nthe end of his life.\r\n\r\nIn reference to his work in geology, his conclusions regarding fossils\r\n(1669) were based on the dissection of the head of a shark, by which\r\nmeans he showed an almost exact correspondence between certain glossy\r\nfossils and the teeth of living sharks. He applied his reasoning, that\r\nlike effects imply like causes, to all manner of fossils, and clearly\r\nestablished the point that they should be regarded as the remains of\r\nanimals and plants. The method of investigation practiced by Steno was\r\nthat \"which has consciously or unconsciously guided the researches of\r\npalæontologists ever since.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough his conclusions were well supported, they did not completely\r\noverthrow the opposing views, and become a fixed basis in geology.\r\nWhen, at the close of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth, fossil remains were being exhumed in great quantities in\r\nthe Paris basin, Cuvier, the great French naturalist, reëstablished the\r\ndoctrine that fossils are the remains of ancient life. An account of\r\nthis will be given presently, and in the mean time we shall go on with\r\nthe consideration of a question raised by the conclusions of Steno.\r\n\r\nFossil Deposits Ascribed to the Flood.--After it began to be\r\nreluctantly conceded that fossils might possibly be the remains of\r\nformer generations of animals and plants, there followed a period\r\ncharacterized by the general belief that these entombed forms had been\r\ndeposited at the time of the Mosaic deluge. This was the prevailing\r\nview in the eighteenth century. As observation increased and the extent\r\nand variety of fossil life became known, as well as the positions in\r\nwhich fossils were found, it became more difficult to hold this view\r\nwith any appearance of reason. Large forms were found on the tops of\r\nmountains, and also lighter forms were found near the bottom. Miles\r\nupon miles of superimposed rocks were discovered, all of them bearing\r\nquantities of animal forms, and the interpretation that these had been\r\nkilled and distributed by a deluge became very strained. But to the\r\nreasoners who gave free play to their fancies the facts of observation\r\nafforded little difficulty. Some declared that the entire surface of\r\nthe earth had been reduced to the condition of a pasty mass, and that\r\nthe animals drowned by the Deluge had been deposited within this pasty\r\nmass which, on the receding of the waters, hardened into rocks.\r\n\r\nThe belief that fossil deposits were due to the Deluge sensibly\r\ndeclined, however, near the close of the eighteenth century, but was\r\nstill warmly debated in the early part of the nineteenth century.\r\nFossil bones of large tropical animals having been discovered\r\nabout 1821, embedded in the stalagmite-covered floor of a cavern\r\nin Yorkshire, England, some of the ingenious supporters of the\r\nflood-theory maintained that caves were produced by gases proceeding\r\nfrom the bodies of decaying animals of large size; that they were like\r\nlarge bubbles in the crust of the earth, and, furthermore, that bones\r\nfound in caverns were either those from the decayed carcasses or others\r\nthat had been deposited during the occurrence of the Flood.\r\n\r\nEven the utterances of Cuvier, in his theory of catastrophism to which\r\nwe shall presently return, gave countenance to the conclusion that the\r\nDeluge was of universal extent. As late as 1823, William Buckland,\r\nreader in geology in Oxford, and later canon (1825) of Christ Church,\r\nand dean (1845) of Westminster, published his _Reliquiæ Diluvianæ_,\r\nor _Observations on the Organic Remains Attesting the Action of a\r\nUniversal Deluge_.\r\n\r\nThe theory that the Mosaic deluge had any part in the deposit of\r\norganic fossils was finally surrendered through the advance of\r\nknowledge, owing mainly to the labors of Lyell and his followers.\r\n\r\nThe Comparison of Fossil and Living Animals.--The very great interest\r\nconnected with the reëstablishment of the conclusion of Steno, that\r\nfossils were once alive, leads us to speak more at length of the\r\ndiscoveries upon which Cuvier passed his opinion. In the gypsum rocks\r\nabout Paris the workmen had been turning up to the light bones of\r\nenormous size. While the workmen could recognize that they were bones\r\nof some monsters, they were entirely at loss to imagine to what kind\r\nof animals they had belonged, but the opinion was frequently expressed\r\nthat they were the bones of human giants.\r\n\r\nCuvier, with his extensive preparation in comparative anatomy, was the\r\nbest fitted man perhaps in all the world to pass judgment upon these\r\nparticular bones. He went to the quarries and, after observing the\r\nremains, he saw very clearly that they were different from the bones of\r\nany animals now existing. His great knowledge of comparative anatomy\r\nwas founded on a comprehensive study of the bony system as well as the\r\nother structures of all classes of living animals. He was familiar with\r\nthe anatomy of elephants, and when he examined the large bones brought\r\nto light in the quarries of Montmartre, he saw that he was confronted\r\nwith the bones of elephant-like animals, but animals differing in their\r\nanatomy from those at present living on the earth.\r\n\r\nThe great feature of Cuvier's investigations was that he instituted\r\ncomparisons on a broad scale between fossil remains and living animals.\r\nIt was not merely that he followed the method of investigation employed\r\nby Steno; he went much further and reached a new conclusion of great\r\nimportance. Not only was the nature of fossil remains determined, but\r\nby comparing their structure with that of living animals the astounding\r\ninference was drawn that the fossil remains examined belonged to\r\nforms that were truly extinct. This discovery marks an epoch in the\r\ndevelopment of the knowledge of extinct animals.\r\n\r\nCuvier the Founder of Vertebrate Palæontology.--The interesting\r\ndiscovery that the fossil relics in the Eocene rocks about Paris\r\nembraced extinct species was announced to the Institute by Cuvier in\r\nJanuary, 1796; and thereafter he continued for a quarter of a century\r\nto devote much attention to the systematic study of collections made\r\nin that district. These observations were, however, shared with other\r\nlabors upon comparative anatomy and zoölogy, which indicates the\r\nprodigious industry for which he was notable. In 1812-1813 he published\r\na monumental work, profusely illustrated, under the title _Ossemens\r\nFossiles_. This standard publication entitles him to recognition as the\r\nfounder of vertebrate palæontology.\r\n\r\nIn examining the records of fossil life, Cuvier and others saw that\r\nthe evidence indicated a succession of animal populations that had\r\nbecome extinct, and also that myriads of new forms of life appeared in\r\nthe rocks of succeeding ages. Here Cuvier, who believed that species\r\nwere fixed and unalterable, was confronted with a puzzling problem. In\r\nattempting to account for the extinction of life, and what seemed to\r\nhim the creation of new forms, he could see no way out consistent with\r\nhis theoretical views except to assume that the earth had periodically\r\nbeen the scene of great catastrophes, of which the Mosaic deluge was\r\nthe most recent, but possibly not the last. He supposed that these\r\ncataclysms of nature resulted in the extinction of all life, and\r\nthat after each catastrophe the salubrious condition of the earth\r\nwas restored, and that it was re-peopled by a new creation of living\r\nbeings. This conception, known as the theory of catastrophism, was\r\nan obstacle to the progress of science. It is to be regretted that\r\nCuvier was not able to accept the views of his illustrious contemporary\r\nLamarck, who believed that the variations in fossil life, as well as\r\nthose of living forms, were owing to gradual transformations.\r\n\r\nLamarck Founds Invertebrate Palæontology.--The credit of founding\r\nthe science of palæontology does not belong exclusively to Cuvier.\r\nAssociated with his name as co-founders are those of Lamarck and\r\nWilliam Smith. Lamarck, that quiet, forceful thinker who for so many\r\nyears worked by the side of Cuvier, founded the science of invertebrate\r\npalæontology. The large bones with which Cuvier worked were more easy\r\nto be recognized as unique or as belonging to extinct animals than\r\nthe shells which occurred in abundance in the rocks about Paris. The\r\nlatter were more difficult to place in their true position because\r\nthe number of forms of life in the sea is very extended and very\r\ndiverse. Just as Cuvier was a complete master of knowledge regarding\r\nvertebrate organization, so Lamarck was equally a master of that vast\r\ndomain of animal forms which are of a lower grade of organization--the\r\ninvertebrates. From his study of the collections of shells and other\r\ninvertebrate forms from the rocks, Lamarck created invertebrate\r\npalæontology and this, coupled with the work of Cuvier, formed the\r\nfoundations of the entire field.\r\n\r\nLamarck's study of the extinct invertebrates led him to conclusions\r\nwidely at variance with those of Cuvier. Instead of thinking of a\r\nseries of catastrophes, he saw that not all of the forms of life\r\nbelonging to one geological period became extinct, but that some of\r\nthem were continued into the succeeding period. He saw, therefore, that\r\nthe succession of life in the rocks bore testimony to a long series\r\nof gradual changes upon the earth's surface, and did not in any way\r\nindicate the occurrence of catastrophes. The changes, according to the\r\nviews of Lamarck, were all knit together into a continuous process, and\r\nhis conception of the origin of life upon the earth grew and expanded\r\nuntil it culminated in the elaboration of the first consistent theory\r\nof evolution.\r\n\r\nThese two men, Lamarck and Cuvier, form a contrast as to the favors\r\ndistributed by fortune: Cuvier, picturesque, highly honored, the\r\nfavorite of princes, advanced to the highest places of recognition\r\nin the government, acclaimed as the Jove of natural science; Lamarck,\r\nhard-working, harassed by poverty, insufficiently recognized, and,\r\nalthough more gifted than his confrère, overlooked by the scientific\r\nmen of the time. The judgment of the relative position of these two\r\nmen in natural science is now being reversed, and on the basis of\r\nintellectual supremacy Lamarck is coming into general recognition\r\nas the better man of the two. In the chapters dealing with organic\r\nevolution some events in the life of this remarkable man will be given.\r\n\r\nThe Arrangement of Fossils in Strata.--The other name associated with\r\nLamarck and Cuvier is that of William Smith, the English surveyor.\r\nBoth Lamarck and Cuvier were men of extended scientific training, but\r\nWilliam Smith had a moderate education as a surveyor. While the two\r\nformer were able to express scientific opinions upon the nature of the\r\nfossil forms discovered, William Smith went at his task as an observer\r\nwith a clear and unprejudiced mind, an observer who walked about over\r\nthe fields, noticing the conditions of rocks and of fossil forms\r\nembedded therein. He noted that the organic remains were distributed\r\nin strata, and that particular forms of fossil life characterized\r\nparticular strata and occupied the same relative position to one\r\nanother. He found, for illustration, that certain particular forms\r\nwould be found underlying certain other forms in one mass of rocks\r\nin a certain part of the country. Wherever he traveled, and whatever\r\nrocks he examined, he found these forms occupying the same relative\r\npositions, and thus he came to the conclusion that the living forms\r\nwithin the rocks constitute a stratified series, having definite and\r\nunvarying arrangement with reference to one another.\r\n\r\nIn short, the work of these three men--Cuvier, Lamarck, and William\r\nSmith--placed the new science of palæontology upon a secure basis at\r\nthe beginning of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nSummary.--The chief steps up to this time in the growth of the\r\nscience of fossil life may now be set forth in categories, though we\r\nmust remember that the advances proceeded concurrently and were much\r\nintermingled, so that, whatever arrangement we may adopt, it does not\r\nrepresent a strict chronological order of events:\r\n\r\nI. The determination of the nature of fossils. Owing to the labors of\r\nDa Vinci, Steno, and Cuvier, the truth was established that fossils are\r\nthe remains of former generations of animals and plants.\r\n\r\nII. The comparison of organic fossils with living forms that was\r\ninstituted on a broad scale by Cuvier resulted in the conclusion that\r\nsome of the fossils belong to extinct races. The belief of Cuvier that\r\nentire populations became extinct simultaneously, led him to the theory\r\nof catastrophism. The observations of Lamarck, that, while some species\r\ndisappear, others are continued and pass through transmutations, were\r\ncontrary to that theory.\r\n\r\nIII. The recognition that the stratified rocks in which fossils are\r\ndistributed are sedimentary deposits of gradual formation. This\r\nobservation and the following took the ground from under the theory\r\nthat fossils had been deposited during the Mosaic deluge.\r\n\r\nIV. The discovery by William Smith that the arrangement of fossils\r\nwithin rocks is always the same, and the relative age of rocks may be\r\ndetermined by an examination of their fossil contents.\r\n\r\nUpon the basis of the foregoing, we come to the next advance, _viz._:\r\n\r\nV. The application of this knowledge to the determination of the\r\nhistory of the earth.\r\n\r\nFossil Remains as an Index to the Past History of the Earth.--The most\r\nadvanced and enlightened position that had been taken in reference to\r\nthe fossil series during the first third of the nineteenth century was\r\nthat taken by Lamarck, he being the first to read in the series the\r\nhistory of life upon the globe, weaving it into a connected story, and\r\nestablishing thereon a doctrine of organic evolution. It was not until\r\nafter 1859, however, that the truth of this conclusion was generally\r\nadmitted, and when it was accepted it was not through the earlier\r\npublications of Lamarck, but through the arguments of later observers,\r\nfounded primarily upon the hypothesis set forth by Darwin. There were\r\nseveral gradations of scientific opinion in the period, short as it\r\nwas, between the time of Cuvier and of Darwin; and this intermediate\r\nperiod was one of contention and warfare between the theologians and\r\nthe geologists. Cuvier had championed the theory of a succession of\r\ncatastrophes, and since this hypothesis did not come into such marked\r\nconflict with the prevailing theological opinion as did the views of\r\nLamarck, the theologians were ready to accept the notion of Cuvier, and\r\nto point with considerable satisfaction to his unique position as an\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nLyell.--In 1830 there was published an epoch-making work in geology\r\nby Charles Lyell (Fig. 97), afterward Sir Charles, one of the\r\nmost brilliant geologists of all the world. This British leader\r\nof scientific thought showed the prevalence of a uniform law of\r\ndevelopment in reference to the earth's surface. He pointed out the\r\nfact that had been maintained by Hutton, that changes in the past were\r\nto be interpreted in the light of what is occurring in the present. By\r\nmaking a careful study of the work performed by the waters in cutting\r\ndown the continents and in transferring the eroded material to other\r\nplaces, and distributing it in the form of deltas; by observing also\r\nthe action of frost and wind and wave; by noting, furthermore, the\r\nconditions under which animals die and are subsequently covered up in\r\nthe matrix of detritus--by all this he showed evidences of a series of\r\nslow, continuous changes that have occurred in the past and have molded\r\nthe earth's crust into its present condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97.--Charles Lyell, 1797-1875.]\r\n\r\nHe showed, further, that organic fossils are no exception to this law\r\nof uniform change. He pointed to the evidences that ages of time had\r\nbeen required for the formation of the rocks bearing fossils; and that\r\nthe regular succession of animal forms indicates a continual process of\r\ndevelopment of animal life; and that the disappearance of some forms,\r\nthat is, their becoming extinct, was not owing to sudden changes, but\r\nto gradual changes. When this view was accepted, it overthrew the\r\ntheory of catastrophism and replaced it by one designated uniformatism,\r\nbased on the prevalence of uniform natural laws.\r\n\r\nThis new conception, with all of its logical inferences, was scouted\r\nby those of theological bias, but it won its way in the scientific\r\nworld and became an important feature in preparing for the reception of\r\nDarwin's great book upon the descent of animal life.\r\n\r\nWe step forward now to the year 1859, to consider the effect upon\r\nthe science of palæontology of the publication of Darwin's _Origin\r\nof Species_. Its influence was tremendous. The geological theories\r\nthat had provoked so much controversy were concerned not merely with\r\nthe disappearance of organic forms, but also with the introduction\r\nof new species. The _Origin of Species_ made it clear that the only\r\nrational point of view in reference to fossil life was that it had been\r\ngradually developed, that it gave us a picture of the conditions of\r\nlife upon the globe in past ages, that the succession of forms within\r\nthe rocks represented in outline the successive steps in the formation\r\nof different kinds of animals and plants.\r\n\r\nOwen.--Both before and after Darwin's hypothesis was given to science,\r\nnotable anatomists, a few of whom must be mentioned, gave attention to\r\nfossil remains. Richard Owen (1804-1892) had his interest in fossil\r\nlife stimulated by a visit to Cuvier in 1831, and for more than forty\r\nyears thereafter he published studies on the structure of fossil\r\nanimals. His studies on the fossil remains of Australia and New Zealand\r\nbrought to light some interesting forms. The extinct giant bird of New\r\nZealand (Fig. 98) was a spectacular demonstration of the enormous size\r\nto which birds had attained during the Eocene period. Owen's monograph\r\n(1879) on the oldest known bird--the archæopteryx--described an\r\ninteresting form uniting both bird-like and reptilian characteristics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98.--Professor Owen and the Extinct Fossil Bird\r\n(Dinornis) of New Zealand.\r\n\r\nPermission of D. Appleton & Co.]\r\n\r\nAgassiz.--Louis Agassiz (1807-1873) (Fig. 99) also came into close\r\npersonal contact with Cuvier, and produced his first great work partly\r\nunder the stimulus of the latter. When Agassiz visited Paris, Cuvier\r\nplaced his collections at Agassiz's disposal, together with numerous\r\ndrawings of fossil fishes. The profusely illustrated monograph of\r\nAgassiz on the fossil fishes (1833-1844) began to appear in 1833, the\r\nyear after Cuvier's death, and was carried on eleven years before it\r\nwas completed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 99.--Louis Agassiz, 1807-1873.]\r\n\r\nAgassiz, with his extensive knowledge of the developmental stages\r\nof animals, came to see a marked parallelism between the stages in\r\ndevelopment of the embryo and the successive forms in the geological\r\nseries. This remarkable parallelism between the fossil forms of life\r\nand the stages in the development of higher forms of recent animals\r\nis very interesting and very significant, and helps materially in\r\nelucidating the idea that the fossil series represent roughly the\r\nsuccessive stages through which animal forms have passed in their\r\nupward course of development from the simplest to the highest, through\r\nlong ages of time. Curiously enough, however, Agassiz failed to grasp\r\nthe meaning of the principle that he had worked out. After illustrating\r\nso nicely the process of organic evolution, he remained to the end of\r\nhis life an opponent of that theory.\r\n\r\nHuxley.--Thomas Henry Huxley (1825-1895) was led to study fossil life\r\non an extended scale, and he shed light in this province as in others\r\nupon which he touched. With critical analysis and impartial mind he\r\napplied the principles of evolution to the study of fossil remains.\r\nHis first conclusion was that the evidence of evolution derived from\r\npalæontology was negative, but with the advances in discovery he grew\r\ngradually to recognize that palæontologists, in bringing to light\r\ncomplete evolutionary series, had supplied some of the strongest\r\nsupporting evidence of organic evolution. By many geologists fossils\r\nhave been used as time-markers for the determination of the age of\r\nvarious deposits; but, with Huxley, the study of them was always\r\nbiological. It is to the latter point of view that palæontology owes\r\nits great importance and its great development. The statement of\r\nHuxley, that the only difference between a fossil and a recent animal\r\nis that one has been dead longer than the other, represents the spirit\r\nin which the study is being carried forward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 100.--E.D. Cope, 1840-1897.]\r\n\r\nWith the establishment of the doctrine of organic evolution\r\npalæontology entered upon its modern phase of growth; upon this basis\r\nthere is being reared a worthy structure through the efforts of the\r\nrecent votaries to the science. It is neither essential nor desirable\r\nthat the present history of the subject should be followed here in\r\ndetail. The collections of material upon which palæontologists are\r\nworking have been enormously increased, and there is perhaps no place\r\nwhere activity has been greater than in the United States. The rocks\r\nof the Western States and Territories embrace a very rich collection\r\nof fossil forms, and, through the generosity of several wealthy men,\r\nexploring parties have been provided for and immense collections have\r\nbeen brought back to be preserved in the museums, especially of New\r\nHaven, Conn., and in the American Museum of Natural History in New York\r\nCity.\r\n\r\nLeidy, Cope, and Marsh.--Among the early explorers of the fossils of\r\nthe West must be named Joseph Leidy, E.D. Cope (Fig. 100), and O.C.\r\nMarsh. These gentlemen all had access to rich material, and all of\r\nthem made notable contributions to the science of palæontology. The\r\nwork of Cope (1840-1897) is very noteworthy. He was a comparative\r\nanatomist equal to Cuvier in the extent of his knowledge, and of larger\r\nphilosophical views. His extended publications under the direction of\r\nthe United States Government have very greatly extended the knowledge\r\nof fossil vertebrate life in America.\r\n\r\nO.C. Marsh (Fig. 101) is noteworthy for similar explorations; his\r\ndiscovery of toothed birds in the Western rocks and his collection\r\nof fossil horses, until recently the most complete one in existence,\r\nare all very well known. Throughout his long life he contributed from\r\nhis own private fortune, and intellectually through his indefatigable\r\nlabors, to the progress of palæontology.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 101.--O.C. Marsh, 1831-1899.]\r\n\r\nZittel.--The name most widely known in palæontology is that of the\r\nlate Karl von Zittel (1839-1904), who devoted all his working life\r\nto the advancement of the science of fossils. In his great work,\r\n_Handbuch der Palaeontologie_ (1876-1893), he brought under one view\r\nthe entire range of fossils from the protozoa up to the mammals. Osborn\r\nsays: \"It is probably not an exaggeration to say that he did more for\r\nthe promotion and diffusion of palæontology than any other single\r\nman who lived during the nineteenth century. While not gifted with\r\ngenius, he possessed extraordinary judgment, critical capacity, and\r\nuntiring industry.\" His portrait (Fig. 102) shows a face \"full of keen\r\nintelligence and enthusiasm.\"\r\n\r\nZittel's influence was exerted not only through his writings, but also\r\nthrough his lectures and the stimulus imparted to the large number of\r\nyoung men who were attracted to Munich to study under his direction.\r\nThese disciples are now distributed in various universities in Europe\r\nand the United States, and are there carrying forward the work begun\r\nby Zittel. The great collection of fossils which he left at Munich\r\ncontains illustrations of the whole story of the evolution of life\r\nthrough geological ages.\r\n\r\nRecent Developments.--The greatest advance now being made in the\r\nstudy of fossil vertebrate life consists in establishing the lineage\r\nof families, orders, and classes. Investigators have been especially\r\nfortunate in working out the direct line of descent of a number of\r\nliving mammals. Fossils have been collected which supply a panoramic\r\nview of the line of descent of horses, of camels, of rhinoceroses, and\r\nof other animals. The most fruitful worker in this field at the present\r\ntime is perhaps Henry F. Osborn, of the American Museum of Natural\r\nHistory, New York City. His profound and important investigations\r\nin the ancestry of animal life are now nearing the time of their\r\npublication in elaborated form.\r\n\r\nPalæontology, by treating fossil life and recent life in the same\r\ncategory, has come to be one of the important lines of investigation\r\nin biology. It is, of course, especially rich in giving us a knowledge\r\nof the hard parts of animals, but by ingenious methods we can arrive\r\nat an idea of some of the soft parts that have completely disappeared.\r\nMolds of the interior of the cranium can be made, and thus one may form\r\na notion of the relative size and development of the brain in different\r\nvertebrated animals. This method of making molds and studying them has\r\nshown that one characteristic of the geological time of the tertiary\r\nperiod was a marked development in regard to the brain size of the\r\ndifferent animals. There was apparently, just prior to the quaternary\r\nepoch, a need on the part of animals to have an increased brain-growth;\r\nand one can not doubt that this feature which is demonstrated by fossil\r\nlife had a great influence in the development of higher animal forms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 102.--Karl von Zittel, 1839-1904.]\r\n\r\nThe methods of collecting fossils in the field have been greatly\r\ndeveloped. By means of spreading mucilage and tissue paper over\r\ndelicate bones that crumble on exposure to the air, and of wrapping\r\nfossils in plaster casts for transportation, it has been made possible\r\nto uncover and preserve many structures which with a rougher method of\r\nhandling would have been lost to science.\r\n\r\nFossil Man.--One extremely interesting section of palæontology deals\r\nwith the fossil remains of the supposed ancestors of the present human\r\nrace. Geological evidence establishes the great antiquity of man, but\r\nup to the present time little systematic exploration has been carried\r\non with a view to discover all possible traces of fossil man. From\r\ntime to time since 1840 there have been discovered in caverns and\r\nriver-gravels bones which, taken together, constitute an interesting\r\nseries. The parts of the skull are of especial importance in this kind\r\nof study, and there now exists in different collections a series\r\ncontaining the Neanderthal skull, the skulls of Spy and Engis, and\r\nthe Java skull described in 1894 by Dubois. There have also been\r\nfound recently (November, 1906) in deposits near Lincoln, Neb., some\r\nfossil human remains that occupy an intermediate position between the\r\nNeanderthal skull and the skulls of the lower representatives of living\r\nraces of mankind. We shall have occasion to revert to this question in\r\nconsidering the evidences of organic evolution. (See page 364.)\r\n\r\nThe name palæontology was brought into use about 1830. The science\r\naffords, in some particulars, the most interesting field for biological\r\nresearch, and the feature of the reconstruction of ancient life and the\r\ndetermination of the lineage of living forms has taken a strong hold\r\non the popular imagination. According to Osborn, the most important\r\npalæontological event of recent times was the discovery, in 1900, of\r\nfossil beds of mammals in the Fayûm lake-province of Egypt, about\r\nforty-seven miles south of Cairo. Here are embedded fossil forms, some\r\nof which have been already described in a volume by Charles W. Andrews,\r\nwhich Osborn says \"marks a turning-point in the history of mammalia of\r\nthe world.\" It is now established that \"Africa was a very important\r\ncenter in the evolution of mammalian life.\" It is expected that the\r\nlineage of several orders of mammalia will be cleared up through the\r\nfurther study of fossils from this district.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nTHE DOCTRINE OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nWHAT EVOLUTION IS: THE EVIDENCE UPON WHICH IT RESTS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preceding pages have been devoted mainly to an account of the\r\nshaping of ideas in reference to the architecture, the physiology, and\r\nthe development of animal life.\r\n\r\nWe come now to consider a central theme into which all these ideas\r\nhave been merged in a unified system; _viz._, the process by which the\r\ndiverse forms of animals and plants have been produced.\r\n\r\nCrude speculations regarding the derivation of living forms are\r\nvery ancient, and we may say that the doctrine of organic evolution\r\nwas foreshadowed in Greek thought. The serious discussion of the\r\nquestion, however, was reserved for the nineteenth century. The\r\nearlier naturalists accepted animated nature as they found it, and\r\nfor a long time were engaged in becoming acquainted merely, with the\r\ndifferent kinds of animals and plants, in working out their anatomy and\r\ndevelopment; but after some progress had been made in this direction\r\nthere came swinging into their horizon deeper questions, such as that\r\nof the derivation of living forms. The idea that the higher forms of\r\nlife are derived from simpler ones by a process of gradual evolution\r\nreceived general acceptance, as we have said before, only in the last\r\npart of the nineteenth century, after the work of Charles Darwin;\r\nbut we shall presently see how the theory of organic development was\r\nthought out in completeness by Lamarck in the last years of the\r\neighteenth century, and was further molded by others before Darwin\r\ntouched it.\r\n\r\nVagueness Regarding Evolution.--Although \"evolution\" is to-day a word\r\nin constant use, there is still great vagueness in the minds of most\r\npeople as to what it stands for; and, what is more, there is very\r\nlittle general information disseminated regarding the evidence by which\r\nit is supported, and regarding the present status of the doctrine in\r\nthe scientific world.\r\n\r\nIn its broad sense, evolution has come to mean the development of all\r\nnature from the past. We may, if we wish, think of the long train of\r\nevents in the formation of the world, and in supplying it with life\r\nas a story inscribed upon a scroll that is being gradually unrolled.\r\nEverything which has come to pass is on that part so far exposed, and\r\neverything in the future is still covered, but will appear in due\r\ncourse of time; thus the designation of evolution as \"the unrolling of\r\nthe scroll of the universe\" becomes picturesquely suggestive. In its\r\nwide meaning, it includes the formation of the stars, solar systems,\r\nthe elements of the inorganic world, as well as all living nature--this\r\nis general evolution; but the word as commonly employed is limited to\r\norganic evolution, or the formation of life upon our planet. It will be\r\nused hereafter in this restricted sense.\r\n\r\nThe vagueness regarding the theory of organic evolution arises chiefly\r\nfrom not understanding the points at issue. One of the commonest\r\nmistakes is to confuse Darwinism with organic evolution. It is known,\r\nfor illustration, that controversies are current among scientific\r\nworkers regarding Darwinism and certain phases of evolution, and\r\nfrom this circumstance it is assumed that the doctrine of organic\r\nevolution as a whole is losing ground. The discussions of De Vries and\r\nothers--all believers in organic evolution--at the Scientific Congress\r\nin St. Louis in 1904, led to the statement in the public press that the\r\nscientific world was haggling over the evolution-theory, and that it\r\nwas beginning to surrender it. Such statements are misleading and tend\r\nto perpetuate the confusion regarding its present status. Furthermore,\r\nthe matter as set forth in writings like the grotesque little book, _At\r\nthe Deathbed of Darwinism_ tends to becloud rather than to clear the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe theory of organic evolution relates to the history of animal and\r\nplant life, while Darwin's theory of natural selection is only one of\r\nthe various attempts to point out the causes for that history's being\r\nwhat it is. An attack upon Darwinism is not, in itself, an attack\r\nupon the general theory, but upon the adequacy of his explanation of\r\nthe way in which nature has brought about the diversity of animal and\r\nplant life. Natural selection is the particular factor which Darwin\r\nhas emphasized, and the discussion of the part played by other factors\r\ntends only to extend the knowledge of the evolutionary process, without\r\ndetracting from it as a general theory.\r\n\r\nWhile the controversies among scientific men relate for the most part\r\nto the influences that have been operative in bringing about organic\r\nevolution, nevertheless there are a few in the scientific camp who\r\nrepudiate the doctrine. Fleischmann, of Erlangen, is perhaps the most\r\nconspicuous of those who are directing criticism against the general\r\ndoctrine, maintaining that it is untenable. Working biologists will be\r\nthe first to admit that it is not demonstrated by indubitable evidence,\r\nbut the weight of evidence is so compelling that scientific men as a\r\nbody regard the doctrine of organic evolution as merely expressing\r\na fact of nature, and we can not in truth speak of any considerable\r\nopposition to it. Since Fleischmann speaks as an anatomist, his\r\nsuppression of anatomical facts with which he is acquainted and his\r\nform of special pleading have impressed the biological world as lacking\r\nin sincerity.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place, however, to deal with the technical aspects\r\nof the discussion of the factors of organic evolution; it is rather\r\nour purpose here to give a descriptive account of the theory and its\r\nvarious explanations. First we should aim to arrive at a clear idea\r\nof what the doctrine of evolution is, and the basis upon which it\r\nrests; then of the factors which have been emphasized in attempted\r\nexplanations of it; and, finally, of the rise of evolutionary thought,\r\nespecially in the nineteenth century. The bringing forward of these\r\npoints will be the aim of the following pages.\r\n\r\nNature of the Question.--It is essential at the outset to perceive\r\nthe nature of the question involved in the theories of organic\r\nevolution. It is not a metaphysical question, capable of solution\r\nby reflection and reasoning with symbols; the data for it must rest\r\nupon observation of what has taken place in the past in so far as\r\nthe records are accessible. It is not a theological question, as so\r\nmany have been disposed to argue, depending upon theological methods\r\nof interpretation. It is not a question of creation through divine\r\nagencies, or of non-creation, but a question of method of creation.\r\n\r\nEvolution as used in biology is merely a history of the steps by which\r\nanimals and plants came to be what they are. It is, therefore, a\r\nhistorical question, and must be investigated by historical methods.\r\nFragments of the story of creation are found in the strata of the\r\nearth's crust and in the stages of embryonic development. These clues\r\nmust be brought together; and the reconstruction of the story is mainly\r\na matter of getting at the records. Drummond says that evolution is\r\n\"the story of creation as told by those who know it best.\"\r\n\r\nThe Historical Method.--The historical method as applied to searching\r\nout the early history of mankind finds a parallel in the investigations\r\ninto the question of organic evolution. In the buried cities of\r\nPalestine explorers have uncovered traces of ancient races and have in\r\na measure reconstructed their history from fragments, such as coins,\r\nvarious objects of art and of household use, together with inscriptions\r\non tombs and columns and on those curious little bricks which were used\r\nfor public records and correspondence. One city having been uncovered,\r\nit is found by lifting the floors of temples and other buildings, and\r\nthe pavement of public squares, that this city, although very ancient,\r\nis built upon the ruins of a more ancient one, which in turn covers\r\nthe ruins of one still older. In this way, as many as seven successive\r\ncities have been found, built one on top of the other, and new and\r\nunexpected facts regarding ancient civilization have been brought to\r\nlight. We must admit that this gives us an imperfect history, with many\r\ngaps; but it is one that commands our confidence, as being based on\r\nfacts of observation, and not on speculation.\r\n\r\nIn like manner the knowledge of the past history of animal life is the\r\nresult of explorations by trained scholars into the records of the\r\npast. We have remains of ancient life in the rocks, and also traces\r\nof past conditions in the developing stages of animals. These are all\r\nmore ancient than the inscriptions left by the hand of man upon his\r\ntombs, his temples, and his columns, but nevertheless full of meaning\r\nif we can only understand them. This historical method of investigation\r\napplied to the organic world has brought new and unexpected views\r\nregarding the antiquity of life.\r\n\r\nThe Diversity of Living Forms.--Sooner or later the question of the\r\nderivation of the animals and plants is bound to come to the mind of\r\nthe observer of nature. There exist at present more than a million\r\ndifferent kinds of animals. The waters, the earth, the air teem with\r\nlife. The fishes of the sea are almost innumerable, and in a single\r\norder of the insect-world, the beetles, more than 50,000 species\r\nare known and described. In addition to living animals, there is\r\nentombed in the rocks a great multitude of fossil forms which lived\r\ncenturies ago, and many of which have become entirely extinct. How\r\nshall this great diversity of life be accounted for? Has the great\r\nvariety of forms existed unchanged from the days of their creation to\r\nthe present? Or have they, perchance, undergone modifications so that\r\none original form, or at least a few original types, may have through\r\ntransformations merged into different kinds? This is not merely an\r\nidle question, insoluble from the very nature of the case; for the\r\npresent races of animals have a lineage reaching far into the past,\r\nand the question of fixity of form as against alteration of type is a\r\nhistorical question, to be answered by getting evidence as to their\r\nline of descent.\r\n\r\nAre Species Fixed in Nature?--The aspect of the matter which presses\r\nfirst upon our attention is this: Are the species (or different kinds\r\nof animals and plants) fixed, and, within narrow limits, permanent, as\r\nLinnæus supposed? Have they preserved their identity through all time,\r\nor have they undergone changes? This is the heart of the question of\r\norganic evolution. If observation shows species to be constant at the\r\npresent time, and also to have been continuous so far as we can trace\r\ntheir parentage, we must conclude that they have not been formed by\r\nevolution; but if we find evidence of their transmutation into other\r\nspecies, then there has been evolution.\r\n\r\nIt is well established that there are wide ranges of variation among\r\nanimals and plants, both in a wild state and under domestication.\r\nGreat changes in flowers and vegetables are brought about through\r\ncultivation, while breeders produce different kinds of pigeons, fowls,\r\nand stock. We know, therefore, that living beings may change through\r\nmodification of the circumstances and conditions that affect their\r\nlives. But general observations extending over a few decades are not\r\nsufficient. We must, if possible, bring the history of past ages to\r\nbear upon the matter, and determine whether or not there had been, with\r\nthe lapse of time, any considerable alteration in living forms.\r\n\r\nEvolutionary Series.--Fortunately, there are preserved in the rocks the\r\npetrified remains of animals, showing their history for many thousands\r\nof years, and we may use them to test the question. It is plain that\r\nrocks of a lower level were deposited before those that cover them,\r\nand we may safely assume that the fossils have been preserved in their\r\nproper chronological order. Now, we have in Slavonia some fresh-water\r\nlakes that have been drying up from the tertiary period. Throughout the\r\nages, these waters were inhabited by snails, and naturally the more\r\nancient ones were the parents of the later broods. As the animals died\r\ntheir shells sank to the bottom and were covered by mud and débris,\r\nand held there like currants in a pudding. In the course of ages, by\r\nsuccessive accumulations, these layers thickened and were changed into\r\nrock, and by this means shells have been preserved in their proper\r\norder of birth and life, the most ancient at the bottom and the newest\r\nat the top. We can sink a shaft or dig a trench, and collect the shells\r\nand arrange them in proper order.\r\n\r\nAlthough the shells in the upper strata are descended from those\r\nnear the bottom, they are very different in appearance. No one would\r\nhesitate to name them different species; in fact, when collections\r\nwere first made, naturalists classified these shells into six or eight\r\ndifferent species. If, however, a collection embracing shells from all\r\nlevels is arranged in a long row in proper order, a different light\r\nis thrown on the matter; while those at the ends are unlike, yet if\r\nwe begin at one end and pass to the other we observe that the shells\r\nall grade into one another by such slight changes that there is no\r\nline showing where one kind leaves off and another begins. Thus their\r\nhistory for thousands of years bears testimony to the fact that the\r\nspecies have not remained constant, but have changed into other species.\r\n\r\nFig. 103 will give an idea of the varieties and gradations. It\r\nrepresents shells of a genus, Paludina, which is still abundant in most\r\nof the fresh waters of our globe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 103.--Transmutations of Paludina. (After Neumayer.)]\r\n\r\nA similar series of shells has been brought to light in Württemberg\r\nin which the variations pass through wider limits, so that not only\r\ndifferent species may be observed, but different genera connected by\r\nalmost insensible gradations. These transformations are found in a\r\nlittle flattened pond-shell similar to the planorbis, which is so\r\ncommon at the present time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 104.--Planorbis Shells from Steinheim. (After\r\nHyatt.)]\r\n\r\nFig. 104 shows some of these transformations, the finer gradations\r\nbeing omitted. The shells from these two sources bear directly upon the\r\nquestion of whether or not species have held rigidly to their original\r\nform.\r\n\r\nAfter this kind of revelation in reference to lower animals, we turn\r\nwith awakened interest to the fossil bones of the higher animals.\r\n\r\nEvolution of the Horse.--When we take into account the way in which\r\nfossils have been produced we see clearly that it is the hard parts,\r\nsuch as the shells and the bones, that will be preserved, while the\r\nsoft parts of animals will disappear. Is it not possible that we may\r\nfind the fossil bones of higher animals arranged in chronological order\r\nand in sufficient number to supplement the testimony of the shells?\r\nThere has been preserved in the rocks of our Western States a very\r\ncomplete history of the evolution of the horse family, written, as it\r\nwere, on tablets of stone, and extending over a period of more than\r\ntwo million years, as the geologists estimate time. Geologists can, of\r\ncourse, measure the thickness of rocks and form some estimate of the\r\nrate at which they were deposited by observing the character of the\r\nmaterial and comparing the formation with similar water deposits of\r\nthe present time. Near the surface, in the deposits of the quarternary\r\nperiod, are found remains of the immediate ancestors of the horse,\r\nwhich are recognized as belonging to the same genus, Equus, but to a\r\ndifferent species; thence, back to the lowest beds of the tertiary\r\nperiod we come upon the successive ancestral forms, embracing several\r\ndistinct genera and exhibiting an interesting series of transformations.\r\n\r\nIf in this way we go into the past a half-million years, we find the\r\nancestors of the horse reduced in size and with three toes each on the\r\nfore and hind feet. The living horse now has only a single toe on each\r\nfoot, but it has small splint-like bones that represent the rudiments\r\nof two more. If we go back a million years, we find three toes and the\r\nrudiments of a fourth; and going back two million years, we find four\r\nfully developed toes, and bones in the feet to support them. It is\r\nbelieved that in still older rocks a five-toed form will be discovered,\r\nwhich was the parent of the four-toed form.\r\n\r\nIn the collections at Yale College there are preserved upward of thirty\r\nsteps or stages in the history of the horse family, showing that it\r\narose by evolution or gradual change from a four-or five-toed ancestor\r\nof about the size of a fox, and that it passed through many changes,\r\nbesides increase in size, in the two million years in which we can get\r\nfacts as to its history.\r\n\r\nRemarkable as is this feature of the Marsh collection at New Haven, it\r\nis now surpassed by that in the Museum of Natural History in New York\r\nCity. Here, through the munificent gifts of the late W.C. Whitney,\r\nthere has been accumulated the most complete and extensive collection\r\nof fossil horses in the world. This embraced, in 1904, some portions\r\nof 710 fossil horses, 146 having been derived from explorations under\r\nthe Whitney fund. The extraordinary character of the collection is\r\nshown from the fact that it contains five complete skeletons of fossil\r\nhorses--more than existed at that time in all other museums of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe specimens in this remarkable collection show phases in the parallel\r\ndevelopment of three or four distinct races of horse-like animals, and\r\nthis opens a fine problem in comparative anatomy; _viz._, to separate\r\nthose in the direct line of ancestry of our modern horse from all the\r\nothers. This has been accomplished by Osborn, and through his critical\r\nanalysis we have become aware of the fact that the races of fossil\r\nhorses had not been distinguished in any earlier studies. As a result\r\nof these studies, a new ancestry of the horse, differing in details\r\nfrom that given by Huxley and Marsh, is forthcoming.\r\n\r\nFig. 105 shows the bones of the foreleg of the modern horse, and Fig.\r\n106 some of the modifications through which it has passed. Fig. 107\r\nshows a reconstruction of the ancestor of the horse made by Charles R.\r\nKnight, the animal painter, under the direction of Professor Osborn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 105.--Bones of the Foreleg of a Horse.]\r\n\r\nWhile the limbs were undergoing the changes indicated, other parts of\r\nthe organism were also being transformed and adapted to the changing\r\nconditions of its life. The evolution of the grinding teeth of the\r\nhorse is fully exhibited in the fossil remains. All the facts bear\r\ntestimony that the horse was not originally created as known to-day,\r\nbut that his ancestors existed in different forms, and in evolution\r\nhave transcended several genera and a considerable number of species.\r\nThe highly specialized limb of the horse adapted for speed was the\r\nproduct of a long series of changes, of which the record is fairly\r\nwell preserved. Moreover, the records show that the atavus of the horse\r\nbegan in North America, and that by migration the primitive horses\r\nspread from this continent to Europe, Asia, and Africa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 106.--Bones of the Foreleg and Molar Teeth of\r\nFossil Ancestors of the Horse. European Forms. (After Kayser.)]\r\n\r\nSo far we have treated the question of fixity of species as a\r\nhistorical one, and have gone searching for clues of past conditions\r\njust as an archæologist explores the past in buried cities. The facts\r\nwe have encountered, taken in connection with a multitude of others\r\npointing in the same direction, begin to answer the initial question,\r\nWere the immense numbers of living forms created just as we find them,\r\nor were they evolved by a process of transformation?\r\n\r\nThe geological record of other families of mammals has also been made\r\nout, but none so completely as that of the horse family. The records\r\nshow that the camels were native in North America, and that they spread\r\nby migration from the land of their birth to Asia and Africa, probably\r\ncrossing by means of land-connections which have long since become\r\nsubmerged.\r\n\r\nThe geological record, considered as a whole, shows that the earlier\r\nformed animals were representatives of the lower groups, and that when\r\nvertebrate animals were formed, for a very long time only fishes were\r\nliving, then amphibians, reptiles, birds, and finally, after immense\r\nreaches of time, mammals began to appear.\r\n\r\nConnecting Forms.--Interesting connecting forms between large groups\r\nsometimes are found, or, if not connecting forms, generalized ones\r\nembracing the structural characteristics of two separate groups. Such\r\na form is the archæopteryx (Fig. 108), a primitive bird with reptilian\r\nanatomy, with teeth in its jaws, and a long, lizard-like tail covered\r\nwith feathers, which seems to show connection between birds and\r\nreptiles. The wing also shows the supernumerary fingers, which have\r\nbeen suppressed in modern birds. Another suggestive type of this kind\r\nis the flying reptile or pterodactyl, of which a considerable number\r\nhave been discovered. Illustrations indicating that animals have had a\r\ncommon line of descent might be greatly multiplied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 107.--Reconstruction of the Ancestor of the Horse\r\nby Charles R. Knight, under the direction of Professor Osborn. Permission\r\nAmerican Museum Natural History.]\r\n\r\nThe Embryological Record and its Connection with Evolution.--The most\r\ninteresting, as well as the most comprehensive clues bearing on the\r\nevolution of animal life are found in the various stages through which\r\nanimals pass on their way from the egg to the fully formed animal.\r\nAll animals above the protozoa begin their lives as single cells,\r\nand between that rudimentary condition and the adult stage every\r\ngradation of structure is exhibited. As animals develop they become\r\nsuccessively more and more complex, and in their shifting history many\r\nrudimentary organs arise and disappear. For illustration, in the young\r\nchick, developing within the hen's egg, there appear, after three or\r\nfour days of incubation, gill-slits, or openings into the throat, like\r\nthe gill-openings of lower fishes. These organs belong primarily to\r\nwater life, and are not of direct use to the chick. The heart and the\r\nblood-vessels at this stage are also of the fish-like type, but this\r\ncondition does not last long; the gill-slits, or gill-clefts, fade away\r\nwithin a few days, and the arteries of the head and the neck undergo\r\ngreat changes long before the chick is hatched. Similar gill-clefts\r\nand similar arrangements of blood-vessels appear also very early in\r\nthe development of the young rabbit, and in the development of all\r\nhigher life. Except for the theory of descent, such things would remain\r\na lasting enigma. The universal presence of gill-clefts is not to be\r\nlooked on as a haphazard occurrence. They must have some meaning, and\r\nthe best suggestion so far offered is that they are survivals inherited\r\nfrom remote ancestors. The higher animals have sprung from simpler\r\nones, and the gill-slits, along with other rudimentary organs, have\r\nbeen retained in their history. It is not necessary to assume that they\r\nare inherited from adult ancestors; they are, more likely, embryonic\r\nstructures still retained in the developmental history of higher\r\nanimals. Such traces are like inscriptions on ancient columns--they\r\nare clues to former conditions, and, occurring in the animal series,\r\nthey weigh heavily on the side of evolution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 108.--Fossil Remains of a Primitive Bird\r\n(Archeopteryx). From the specimen in the Berlin Museum. (After Kayser.)]\r\n\r\nAn idea of the appearance of gill-clefts may be obtained from Fig. 109\r\nshowing the gill-clefts in a shark and those in the embryo of a chick\r\nand a rabbit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 109.--The Gill-clefts of a Shark (upper fig.)\r\nCompared with Those of the Embryonic Chick (to the left) and Rabbit.]\r\n\r\nOf a similar nature are the rudimentary teeth in the jaws of the embryo\r\nof the whalebone whale (Fig. 110). The adults have no teeth, these\r\nappearing only as transitory rudiments in the embryo. It is to be\r\nassumed that the teeth are inheritances, and that the toothless baleen\r\nwhale is derived from toothed ancestors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 110.--The Jaws of an Embryonic Whale, Showing\r\nRudimentary Teeth.]\r\n\r\nIf we now turn to comparative anatomy, to classification, and to the\r\ngeographical distribution of animals, we find that it is necessary to\r\nassume the doctrine of descent in order to explain the observed facts;\r\nthe evidence for evolution, indeed, becomes cumulative. But it is not\r\nnecessary, nor will space permit, to give extended illustrations from\r\nthese various departments of biological researches.\r\n\r\nThe Human Body.--Although the broad doctrine of evolution rests largely\r\nupon the observation of animals and plants, there is naturally unusual\r\ninterest as to its teaching in reference to the development of the\r\nhuman body. That the human body belongs to the animal series has long\r\nbeen admitted, and that it has arisen through a long series of changes\r\nis shown from a study of its structure and development. It retains\r\nmarks of the scaffolding in its building. The human body has the same\r\ndevious course of embryonic development as that of other mammals.\r\nIn the course of its formation gill-clefts make their appearance;\r\nthe circulation is successively that of a single-, a double-, and a\r\nfour-chambered heart, with blood-vessels for the gill-clefts. Time and\r\nenergy are consumed in building up rudimentary structures which are\r\nevanescent and whose presence can be best explained on the assumption\r\nthat they are, as in other animals, hereditary survivals.\r\n\r\nWiedersheim has pointed out more than one hundred and eighty\r\nrudimentary or vestigial structures belonging to the human body,\r\nwhich indicate an evolutionary relationship with lower vertebrates.\r\nIt would require a considerable treatise to present the discoveries\r\nin reference to man's organization, as Wiedersheim has done in his\r\n_Structure of Man_. As passing illustrations of the nature of some of\r\nthese suggestive things bearing on the question of man's origin may be\r\nmentioned: the strange grasping power of the newly born human infant,\r\nretained for a short time, and enabling the babe to sustain its weight;\r\nthe presence of a tail and rudimentary tail muscles; of rudimentary ear\r\nmuscles; of gill-clefts, etc.\r\n\r\nAntiquity of Man.--The geological history of man is imperfectly known,\r\nalthough sporadic explorations have already accumulated an interesting\r\nseries, especially as regards the shape and capacity of skulls. The\r\nremains of early quarternary man have been unearthed in various parts\r\nof Europe, and the probable existence of man in the tertiary period is\r\ngenerally admitted. As Osborn says, \"Virtually three links have been\r\nfound in the chain of human ancestry.\" The most primitive pre-human\r\nspecies is represented by portions of the skull and of the leg bones\r\nfound in Java by the Dutch surgeon Dubois in the year 1890. These\r\nremains were found in tertiary deposits, and were baptized under the\r\nname of _Pithecanthropus erectus_. The structural position of this\r\nfossil is between the chimpanzee, the highest of anthropoid apes, and\r\nthe \"Neanderthal man.\" With characteristic scientific caution Osborn\r\nsays that the _Pithecanthropus_ \"belongs in the line of none of the\r\nexisting anthropoid apes, and falls very near, but not directly, in the\r\nline of human ancestry.\"\r\n\r\nThe second link is supplied by the famous Neanderthal skull found in\r\nthe valley of the Neander, near Düsseldorf, in 1856. The discovery\r\nof this skull, with its receding forehead and prominent ridges above\r\nthe orbits of the eyes, and its small cranial capacity, created a\r\nsensation, for it was soon seen that it was intermediate between the\r\nskulls of the lowest human races and those of the anthropoid apes.\r\nVirchow declared that if the skull was pre-human its structural\r\ncharacteristics were abnormal. This conclusion, however, was rendered\r\nuntenable by the discovery in 1886 of similar skulls and the skeletons\r\nof two persons, in a cave near Spy in Belgium. The \"Spy man\" and the\r\n\"Neanderthal man\" belong to the same type and are estimated to have\r\nbeen living in the middle of the palæolithic age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 111.--Profile Reconstructions of the Skulls of\r\nLiving and Fossil Men: 1. Brachycephalic European; 2. The more ancient\r\nof the Nebraska skulls; 3. The Neanderthal man; 4. One of the Spy\r\nskulls; 5. Skull of the Java man. (Altered from Schwalbe and Osborn.)]\r\n\r\nThe third link is in the early Neolithic man of Engis.\r\n\r\nAnd now to this interesting series of gradations has been added\r\nanother by the discovery in 1906 of a supposed primitive race of men\r\nin Nebraska. The two skulls unearthed in Douglass County in that State\r\nindicate a cranial capacity falling below that of the \"Australian\r\nnegro, the lowest existing type of mankind known at present.\"\r\n\r\nFig. 111 shows in outline profile reconstructions of the skulls of some\r\nof the fossil types as compared with the short-headed type of Europe.\r\n\r\nPalæontological discoveries are thus coming to support the evidences of\r\nman's evolution derived from embryology and archæology. While we must\r\nadmit that the geological evidences are at present fragmentary, there\r\nis, nevertheless, reasonable ground for the expectation that they will\r\nbe extended by more systematic explorations of caverns and deposits of\r\nthe quarternary and late tertiary periods.\r\n\r\nMental Evolution.--Already the horizon is being widened, and new\r\nproblems in human evolution have been opened. The evidences in\r\nreference to the evolution of the human body are so compelling as to be\r\nalready generally accepted, and we have now the question of evolution\r\nof mentality to deal with. The progressive intelligence of animals is\r\nshown to depend upon the structure of the brain and the nervous system,\r\nand there exists such a finely graded series in this respect that there\r\nis strong evidence of the derivation of human faculties from brute\r\nfaculties.\r\n\r\nSweep of the Doctrine of Evolution.--The great sweep of the doctrine\r\nof evolution makes it \"one of the greatest acquisitions of human\r\nknowledge.\" There has been no point of intellectual vantage reached\r\nwhich is more inspiring. It is so comprehensive that it enters into\r\nall realms of thought. Weismann expresses the opinion that \"the theory\r\nof descent is the most progressive step that has been taken in the\r\ndevelopment of human knowledge,\" and says that this position \"is\r\njustified, it seems to me, even by this fact alone: that the evolution\r\nidea is not merely a new light on the special region of biological\r\nsciences, zoölogy and botany, but is of quite general importance. The\r\nconception of an evolution of life upon the earth reaches far beyond\r\nthe bounds of any single science, and influences our whole realm of\r\nthought. It means nothing less than the elimination of the miraculous\r\nfrom our knowledge of nature, and the placing of the phenomena of life\r\non the same plane as the other natural processes, that is, as having\r\nbeen brought about by the same forces and being subject to the same\r\nlaws.\"\r\n\r\nOne feature of the doctrine is very interesting; it has enabled\r\nanatomists to predict that traces of certain structures not present\r\nin the adult will be found in the embryonic condition of higher\r\nanimals, and by the verification of these predictions, it receives a\r\nhigh degree of plausibility. The presence of an _os centrale_ in the\r\nhuman wrist was predicted, and afterward found, as also the presence\r\nof a rudimentary thirteenth rib in early stages of the human body. The\r\npredictions, of course, are chiefly technical, but they are based on\r\nthe idea of common descent and adaptation.\r\n\r\nIt took a long time even for scientific men to arrive at a belief in\r\nthe continuity of nature, and having arrived there, it is not easy to\r\nsurrender it. There is no reason to think that the continuity is broken\r\nin the case of man's development. Naturalists have now come to accept\r\nas a mere statement of a fact of nature that the vast variety of forms\r\nof life upon our globe has been produced by a process of evolution. If\r\nthis position be admitted, the next question would be, What are the\r\nfactors which have been operative to bring this about? This brings us\r\nnaturally to discuss the theories of evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHEORIES OF EVOLUTION: LAMARCK, DARWIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe impression so generally entertained that the doctrine of organic\r\nevolution is a vague hypothesis, requiring for its support great\r\nstretches of the imagination, gives way to an examination of the facts,\r\nand we come to recognize that it is a well-founded theory, resting\r\nupon great accumulations of evidence. If the matter could rest here,\r\nit would be relatively simple; but it is necessary to examine into\r\nthe causes of the evolutionary process. While scientific observation\r\nhas shown that species are not fixed, but undergo transformations of\r\nconsiderable extent, there still remains to be accounted for the way in\r\nwhich these changes have been produced.\r\n\r\nOne may assume that the changes in animal life are the result of\r\nthe interaction of protoplasm and certain natural agencies in its\r\nsurroundings, but it is evidently a very difficult matter to designate\r\nthe particular agencies or factors of evolution that have operated to\r\nbring about changes in species. The attempts to indicate these factors\r\ngive rise to different theories of evolution, and it is just here that\r\nthe controversies concerning the subject come in. We must remember,\r\nhowever, that to-day the controversies about evolution are not as\r\nto whether it was or was not the method of creation, but as to the\r\nfactors by which the evolution of different forms was accomplished.\r\nSays Packard: \"We are all evolutionists, though we may differ as to the\r\nnature of the efficient causes.\"\r\n\r\nOf the various theories which had been advanced to account for\r\nevolution, up to the announcement of the mutation-theory of De Vries\r\nin 1900, three in particular had commanded the greatest amount of\r\nattention and been the field for varied and extensive discussion.\r\nThese are the theories of Lamarck, Darwin, and Weismann. They are\r\ncomprehensive theories, dealing with the process as a whole. Most of\r\nthe others are concerned with details, and emphasize certain phases of\r\nthe process.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the factors that have played a part in molding the forms\r\nthat have appeared in the procession of life upon our globe have\r\nbeen numerous, and, in addition to those that have been indicated,\r\nOsborn very aptly suggests that there may be undiscovered factors of\r\nevolution. Within a few years De Vries has brought into prominence\r\nthe idea of sudden transformations leading to new species, and has\r\naccounted for organic evolution on that basis. Further consideration of\r\nthis theory, however, will be postponed, while in the present chapter\r\nwe shall endeavor to bring out the salient features of the theories of\r\nLamarck and Darwin, without going into much detail regarding them.\r\n\r\n\r\nLamarck\r\n\r\nLamarck was the first to give a theory of evolution that has retained\r\na place in the intellectual world up to the present time, and he may\r\njustly be regarded as the founder of that doctrine in the modern sense.\r\nThe earlier theories were more restricted in their reach than that of\r\nLamarck. Erasmus Darwin, his greatest predecessor in this field of\r\nthought, announced a comprehensive theory, which, while suggestive and\r\nforceful in originality, was diffuse, and is now only of historical\r\nimportance. The more prominent writers on evolution in the period\r\nprior to Lamarck will be dealt with in the chapter on the Rise of\r\nEvolutionary Thought.\r\n\r\nLamarck was born in 1744, and led a quiet, monotonous life, almost\r\npathetic on account of his struggles with poverty, and the lack of\r\nencouragement and proper recognition by his contemporaries. His life\r\nwas rendered more bearable, however, even after he was overtaken by\r\ncomplete blindness, by the intellectual atmosphere that he created for\r\nhimself, and by the superb confidence and affection of his devoted\r\ndaughter Cornélie, who sustained him and made the truthful prediction\r\nthat he would be recognized by posterity (\"_La postérité vous\r\nhonorera_\").\r\n\r\nHis Family.--He came of a military family possessing some claims to\r\ndistinction. The older name of the family had been de Monet, but in\r\nthe branch to which Lamarck belonged the name had been changed to\r\nde Lamarque, and in the days of the first Republic was signed plain\r\nLamarck by the subject of this sketch. Jean Baptiste Lamarck was the\r\neleventh and last child of his parents. The other male members of\r\nthe family having been provided with military occupations, Jean was\r\nselected by his father, although against the lad's own wish, for the\r\nclerical profession, and accordingly was placed in the college of the\r\nJesuits at Amiens. He did not, however, develop a taste for theological\r\nstudies, and after the death of his father in 1760 \"nothing could\r\ninduce the incipient abbé, then seventeen years of age, longer to wear\r\nhis bands.\"\r\n\r\nHis ancestry asserted itself, and he forsook the college to follow\r\nthe French army that was then campaigning in Germany. Mounted on a\r\nbroken-down horse which he had succeeded in buying with his scanty\r\nmeans, he arrived on the scene of action, a veritable raw recruit,\r\nappearing before Colonel Lastic, to whom he had brought a letter of\r\nrecommendation.\r\n\r\nMilitary Experience.--The Colonel would have liked to be rid of him,\r\nbut owing to Lamarck's persistence, assigned him to a company; and,\r\nbeing mounted, Lamarck took rank as a sergeant. During his first\r\nengagement his company was exposed to the direct fire of the enemy,\r\nand the officers one after another were shot until Lamarck by order\r\nof succession was in command of the fourteen remaining grenadiers.\r\nAlthough the French army retreated, Lamarck refused to move with his\r\nsquad until he received directions from headquarters to retire. In\r\nthis his first battle he showed the courage and the independence that\r\ncharacterized him in later years.\r\n\r\nAdopts Natural Science.--An injury to the glands of the neck, resulting\r\nfrom being lifted by the head in sport by one of his comrades,\r\nunfitted him for military life, and he went to Paris and began the\r\nstudy of medicine, supporting himself in the mean time by working\r\nas a bank clerk. It was in his medical course of four years' severe\r\nstudy that Lamarck received the exact training that was needed to\r\nconvert his enthusiastic love for science into the working powers of\r\nan investigator. He became especially interested in botany, and, after\r\na chance interview with Rousseau, he determined to follow the ruling\r\npassion of his nature and devote himself to natural science. After\r\nabout nine years' work he published, in 1778, his _Flora of France_,\r\nand in due course was appointed to a post in botany in the Academy of\r\nSciences. He did not hold this position long, but left it to travel\r\nwith the sons of Buffon as their instructor. This agreeable occupation\r\nextended over two years, and he then returned to Paris, and soon after\r\nwas made keeper of the herbarium in the Royal Garden, a subordinate\r\nposition entirely beneath his merits. Lamarck held this poorly paid\r\nposition for several years, and was finally relieved by being appointed\r\na professor in the newly established _Jardin des Plantes_.\r\n\r\nHe took an active part in the reorganization of the Royal Garden\r\n(_Jardin du Roi_) into the _Jardin des Plantes_. When, during the\r\nFrench Revolution, everything that was suggestive of royalty became\r\nobnoxious to the people, it was Lamarck who suggested in 1790 that the\r\nname of the King's Garden be changed to that of the Botanical Garden\r\n(_Jardin des Plantes_). The Royal Garden and the Cabinet of Natural\r\nHistory were combined, and in 1793 the name Jardin des Plantes proposed\r\nby Lamarck was adopted for the institution.\r\n\r\nIt was through the endorsements of Lamarck and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire\r\nthat Cuvier was brought into this great scientific institution; Cuvier,\r\nwho was later to be advanced above him in the Jardin and in public\r\nfavor, and who was to break friendship with Lamarck and become the\r\nopponent of his views, and who also was to engage in a memorable debate\r\nwith his other supporter, Saint-Hilaire.\r\n\r\nThe portrait of Lamarck shown in Fig. 112 is one not generally known.\r\nIts date is undetermined, but since it was published in Thornton's\r\n_British Plants_ in 1805, we know that it was painted before the\r\npublication of Lamarck's _Philosophie Zoologique_, and before the full\r\nforce of the coldness and heartless neglect of the world had been\r\nexperienced. In his features we read supremacy of the intellect, and\r\nthe unflinching moral courage for which he was notable. Lamarck has a\r\nmore hopeful expression in this portrait than in those of his later\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 112.--Lamarck, 1774-1829.\r\n\r\nFrom Thornton's _British Plants_, 1805.]\r\n\r\nLamarck Changes from Botany to Zoölogy.--Until 1794, when he was fifty\r\nyears of age, Lamarck was devoted to botany, but on being urged, after\r\nthe reorganization of the _Jardin du Roi_, to take charge of the\r\ndepartment of invertebrates, he finally consented and changed from the\r\nstudy of plants to that of animals. This change had profound influence\r\nin shaping his ideas. He found the invertebrates in great confusion,\r\nand set about to bring order out of chaos, an undertaking in which, to\r\nhis credit be it acknowledged, he succeeded. The fruit of his labors,\r\nthe Natural History of Invertebrated Animals (_Historie naturelle des\r\nAnimaux sans Vertèbres_, 1815-1822), became a work of great importance.\r\nHe took hold of this work, it should be remembered, as an expert\r\nobserver, trained to rigid analysis by his previous critical studies\r\nin botany. In the progress of the work he was impressed with the\r\ndifferences in animals and the difficulty of separating one species\r\nfrom another. He had occasion to observe the variations produced in\r\nanimals through the influence of climate, temperature, moisture,\r\nelevation above the sea-level, etc.\r\n\r\nHe observed also the effects of use and disuse upon the development of\r\norgans: the exercise of an organ leading to its greater development,\r\nand the disuse to its degeneration. Numerous illustrations are cited\r\nby Lamarck which serve to make his meaning clear. The long legs of\r\nwading birds are produced and extended by stretching to keep above the\r\nwater; the long neck and bill of storks are produced by their habit of\r\nlife; the long neck of the giraffe is due to reaching for foliage on\r\ntrees; the web-footed birds, by spreading the toes when they strike the\r\nwater, have stimulated the development of a membrane between the toes,\r\netc. In the reverse direction, the loss of the power of flight in the\r\n\"wingless\" bird of New Zealand is due to disuse of the wings; while the\r\nloss of sight in the mole and in blind cave animals has arisen from\r\nlack of use of eyes.\r\n\r\nThe changes produced in animal organization in this way were believed\r\nto be continued by direct inheritance and improved in succeeding\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nHe believed also in a perfecting principle, tending to improve\r\nanimals--a sort of conscious endeavor on the part of the animal playing\r\na part in its better development. Finally, he came to believe that the\r\nagencies indicated above were the factors of the evolution of life.\r\n\r\nHis Theory of Evolution.--All that Lamarck had written before he\r\nchanged from botany to zoölogy (1794) indicates his belief in the\r\nfixity of species, which was the prevailing notion among naturalists\r\nof the period. Then, in 1800, we find him apparently all at once\r\nexpressing a contrary opinion, and an opinion to which he held\r\nunwaveringly to the close of his life. It would be of great interest to\r\ndetermine when Lamarck changed his views, and upon what this radical\r\nreversal of opinion was based; but we have no sure record to depend\r\nupon. Since his theory is developed chiefly upon considerations of\r\nanimal life, it is reasonable to assume that his evolutionary ideas\r\ntook form in his mind after he began the serious study of animals.\r\nDoubtless, his mind having been prepared and his insight sharpened by\r\nhis earlier studies, his observations in a new field supplied the data\r\nwhich led him directly to the conviction that species are unstable.\r\nAs Packard, one of his recent biographers, points out, the first\r\nexpression of his new views of which we have any record occurred in the\r\nspring of 1800, on the occasion of his opening lecture to his course on\r\nthe invertebrates. This avowal of belief in the extensive alteration\r\nof species was published in 1801 as the preface to his _Système des\r\nAnimaux sans Vertèbres_. Here also he foreshadowed his theory of\r\nevolution, saying that nature, having formed the simplest organisms,\r\n\"then with the aid of much time and favorable circumstances ... formed\r\nall the others.\" It has been generally believed that Lamarck's first\r\npublic expression of his views on evolution was published in 1802\r\nin his _Recherches sur l'Organisation des Corps Vivans_, but the\r\nresearches of Packard and others have established the earlier date.\r\n\r\nLamarck continued for several years to modify and amplify the\r\nexpression of his views. It is not necessary, however, to follow the\r\nmolding of his ideas on evolution as expressed in the opening lectures\r\nto his course in the years 1800, 1802, 1803, and 1806, since we find\r\nthem fully elaborated in his _Philosophie Zoologique_, published in\r\n1809, and this may be accepted as the standard source for the study of\r\nhis theory. In this work he states two propositions under the name of\r\nlaws, which have been translated by Packard as follows:\r\n\r\n\"_First Law_: In every animal which has not exceeded the term of its\r\ndevelopment, the more frequent and sustained use of any organ gradually\r\nstrengthens this organ, develops and enlarges it, and gives it a\r\nstrength proportioned to the length of time of such use; while the\r\nconstant lack of use of such an organ imperceptibly weakens it, causing\r\nit to become reduced, progressively diminishes its faculties, and ends\r\nin its disappearance.\r\n\r\n\"_Second Law_: Everything which nature has caused individuals to\r\nacquire or lose by the influence of the circumstances to which their\r\nrace may be for a long time exposed, and consequently by the influence\r\nof the predominant use of such an organ, or by that of the constant\r\nlack of use of such part, it preserves by heredity and passes on to the\r\nnew individuals which descend from it, provided that the changes thus\r\nacquired are common to both sexes, or to those which have given origin\r\nto these new individuals.\r\n\r\n\"These are the two fundamental truths which can be misunderstood only\r\nby those who have never observed or followed nature in its operations,\"\r\netc. The first law embodies the principle of use and disuse, the second\r\nlaw that of heredity.\r\n\r\nIn 1815 his theory received some extensions of minor importance. The\r\nonly points to which attention need be called are that he gives four\r\nlaws instead of two, and that a new feature occurs in the second law in\r\nthe statement that the production of a new organ is the result of a new\r\nneed (_besoin_) which continues to make itself felt.\r\n\r\nSimplified Statement of Lamarck's Views.--For practical exposition the\r\ntheory maybe simplified into two sets of facts: First, those to be\r\nclassed under variation; and, second, those under heredity. Variations\r\nof organs, according to Lamarck, arise in animals mainly through\r\nuse and disuse, and new organs have their origin in a physiological\r\nneed. A new need felt by the animal expresses itself on the organism,\r\nstimulating growth and adaptations in a particular direction. This part\r\nof Lamarck's theory has been subjected to much ridicule. The sense in\r\nwhich he employs the word _besoin_ has been much misunderstood; when,\r\nhowever, we take into account that he uses it, not merely as expressing\r\na wish or desire on the part of the animal, but as the reflex\r\naction arising from new conditions, his statement loses its alleged\r\ngrotesqueness and seems to be founded on sound physiology.\r\n\r\nInheritance.--Lamarck's view of heredity was uncritical; according\r\nto his conception, inheritance was a simple, direct transmission of\r\nthose superficial changes that arise in organs within the lifetime\r\nof an individual owing to use and disuse. It is on this question of\r\nthe direct inheritance of variations acquired in the lifetime of an\r\nindividual that his theory has been the most assailed. The belief in\r\nthe inheritance of acquired characteristics has been so undermined by\r\nexperimental evidence that at the present time we can not point to a\r\nsingle unchallenged instance of such inheritance. But, while Lamarck's\r\ntheory has shown weakness on that side, his ideas regarding the\r\nproduction of variations have been revived and extended.\r\n\r\nVariation.--The more commendable part of his theory is the attempt to\r\naccount for variation. Darwin assumed variation, but Lamarck attempted\r\nto account for it, and in this feature many discerning students\r\nmaintain that the theory of Lamarck is more philosophical in its\r\nfoundation than that of Darwin.\r\n\r\nIn any theory of evolution we must deal with the variation of organisms\r\nand heredity, and thus we observe that the two factors discussed by\r\nLamarck are basal. Although it must be admitted that even to-day we\r\nknow little about either variation or heredity, they remain basal\r\nfactors in any theory of evolution.\r\n\r\nTime and Favorable Conditions.--Lamarck supposed a very long time was\r\nnecessary to bring about the changes which have taken place in animals.\r\nThe central thought of time and favorable conditions occurs again and\r\nagain in his writings. The following quotation is interesting as coming\r\nfrom the first announcement of his views in 1800:\r\n\r\n\"It appears, as I have already said, that _time_ and _favorable\r\nconditions_ are the two principal means which nature has employed in\r\ngiving existence to all her productions. We know that for her time has\r\nno limit, and that consequently she has it always at her disposal.\r\n\r\n\"As to the circumstances of which she has had need and of which she\r\nmakes use every day in order to cause her productions to vary, we can\r\nsay that in a manner they are inexhaustible.\r\n\r\n\"The essential ones arising from the influence and from all the\r\nenvironing media, from the diversity of local causes, of habits,\r\nof movements, of action, finally of means of living, of preserving\r\ntheir lives, of defending themselves, of multiplying themselves, etc.\r\nMoreover, as the result of these different influences, the faculties,\r\ndeveloped and strengthened by use, become diversified by the new habits\r\nmaintained for long ages, and by slow degrees the structure, the\r\nconsistence--in a word, the nature, the condition of the parts and of\r\nthe organs consequently participating in all these influences, became\r\npreserved and were propagated by heredity (génération).\" (Packard's\r\ntranslation.)\r\n\r\nSalient Points.--The salient points in Lamarck's theory may be\r\ncompacted into a single sentence: It is a theory of the evolution of\r\nanimal life, depending upon variations brought about mainly through use\r\nand disuse of parts, and also by responses to external stimuli, and the\r\ndirect inheritance of the same. His theory is comprehensive, so much\r\nso that he includes mankind in his general conclusions.\r\n\r\nLamarck supposed that an animal having become adapted to its\r\nsurroundings would remain relatively stable as to its structure. To\r\nthe objection raised by Cuvier that animals from Egypt had not changed\r\nsince the days when they were preserved as mummies, he replied that the\r\nclimate of Egypt had remained constant for centuries, and therefore no\r\nchange in its fauna was to be expected.\r\n\r\nSpecies.--Since the question of the fixity of species is the central\r\none in theories of evolution, it will be worth while to quote Lamarck's\r\ndefinition of species: \"All those who have had much to do with the\r\nstudy of natural history know that naturalists at the present day\r\nare extremely embarrassed in defining what they mean by the word\r\nspecies.... We call _species_ every collection of individuals which\r\nare alike or almost so, and we remark that the regeneration of these\r\nindividuals conserves the species and propagates it in continuing\r\nsuccessively to reproduce similar individuals.\" He then goes on with\r\na long discussion to show that large collections of animals exhibit a\r\ngreat variation in species, and that they have no absolute stability,\r\nbut \"enjoy only a relative stability.\"\r\n\r\nHerbert Spencer adopted and elaborated the theory of Lamarck. He\r\nfreed it from some of its chief crudities, such as the idea of an\r\ninnate tendency toward perfection. In many controversies Mr. Spencer\r\ndefended the idea of the transmission of acquired characters. The\r\nideas of Lamarck have, therefore, been transmitted to us largely in\r\nthe Spencerian mold and in the characteristic language of that great\r\nphilosopher. There has been but little tendency to go to Lamarck's\r\noriginal writings. Packard, whose biography of Lamarck appeared\r\nin 1901, has made a thorough analysis of his, writings and had\r\nincidentally corrected several erroneous conception.\r\n\r\nNeo-Lamarckism.--The ideas of Lamarck regarding the beginning of\r\nvariations have been revived and accorded much respect under the\r\ndesignation of Neo-Lamarckism. The revival of Lamarckism is especially\r\nowing to the palæontological investigations of Cope and Hyatt. The work\r\nof E.D. Cope in particular led him to attach importance to the effect\r\nof mechanical and other external causes in producing variation, and\r\nhe points out many instances of use-inheritance. Neo-Lamarckism has a\r\nconsiderable following; it is a revival of the fundamental ideas of\r\nLamarck.\r\n\r\n\r\nDarwin's Theory\r\n\r\nWhile Lamarck's theory rests upon two sets of facts, Darwin's is\r\nfounded on three: _viz._, the facts of variation, of inheritance, and\r\nof natural selection. The central feature of his theory is the idea\r\nof natural selection. No one else save Wallace had seized upon this\r\nfeature when Darwin made it the center of his system. On account of the\r\npart taken by Wallace simultaneously with Darwin in announcing natural\r\nselection as the chief factor of evolution, it is appropriate to\r\ndesignate this contribution as the Darwin-Wallace principle of natural\r\nselection. The interesting connection between the original conclusions\r\nof Darwin and Wallace is set forth in Chapter XIX.\r\n\r\nVariation.--It will be noticed that two of the causes assigned by\r\nDarwin are the same as those designated by Lamarck, but their treatment\r\nis quite different. Darwin (Fig. 113) assumed variation among animals\r\nand plants without attempting to account for it, while Lamarck\r\nundertook to state the particular influences which produce variation,\r\nand although we must admit that Lamarck was not entirely successful\r\nin this attempt, the fact that he undertook the task places his\r\ncontribution at the outset on a very high plane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 113.--Charles Darwin, 1809-1882.]\r\n\r\nThe existence of variation as established by observation is\r\nunquestioned. No two living organisms are exactly alike at the time of\r\ntheir birth, and even if they are brought up together under identical\r\nsurroundings they vary. The variation of plants and animals under\r\ndomestication is so conspicuous and well known that this kind of\r\nvariation was the first to attract attention. It was asserted that\r\nthese variations were perpetuated because the forms had been protected\r\nby man, and it was doubted that animals varied to any considerable\r\nextent in a state of nature. Extended collections and observations in\r\nfield and forest have, however, set this question at rest.\r\n\r\nIf crows or robins or other birds are collected on an extensive scale,\r\nthe variability of the same species will be evident. Many examples\r\nshow that the so-called species differ greatly in widely separated\r\ngeographical areas, but collections from the intermediate territory\r\ndemonstrate that the variations are connected by a series of fine\r\ngradations. If, for illustration, one should pass across the United\r\nStates from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast, collecting one species\r\nof bird, the entire collection would exhibit wide variations, but the\r\nextremes would be connected by intermediate forms.\r\n\r\nThe amount of variation in a state of nature is much greater than was\r\nat first supposed, because extensive collections were lacking, but\r\nthe existence of wide variation is now established on the basis of\r\nobservation. This fact of variation among animals and plants in the\r\nstate of nature is unchallenged, and affords a good point to start from\r\nin considering Darwinism.\r\n\r\nInheritance.--The idea that these variations are inherited is the\r\nsecond point. But what particular variations will be preserved and\r\nfostered by inheritance, and on what principle they will be selected,\r\nis another question--and a notable one. Darwin's reply was that\r\nthose variations which are of advantage to the individual will be\r\nthe particular ones selected by nature for inheritance. While Darwin\r\nimplies the inheritance of acquired characteristics, his theory of\r\nheredity was widely different from that of Lamarck. Darwin's theory of\r\nheredity, designated the provisional theory of pangenesis, has been\r\nalready considered (see Chapter XIV).\r\n\r\nNatural Selection.--Since natural selection is the main feature of\r\nDarwin's doctrine, we must devote more time to it. Darwin frequently\r\ncomplained that very few of his critics took the trouble to find out\r\nwhat he meant by the term natural selection. A few illustrations will\r\nmake his meaning clear. Let us first think of artificial selection as\r\nit is applied by breeders of cattle, fanciers of pigeons and of other\r\nfowls, etc. It is well known that by selecting particular variations in\r\nanimals and plants, even when the variations are slight, the breeder\r\nor the horticulturalist will be able in a short time to produce new\r\nraces of organic forms. This artificial selection on the part of man\r\nhas given rise to the various breeds of dogs, the 150 different kinds\r\nof pigeons, etc., all of which breed true. The critical question is,\r\nHave these all an individual ancestral form in nature? Observation\r\nshows that many different kinds--as pigeons--may be traced back to a\r\nsingle ancestral form, and thus the doctrine of the fixity of species\r\nis overthrown.\r\n\r\nNow, since it is demonstrated by observation that variations occur, if\r\nthere be a selective principle at work in nature, effects similar to\r\nthose caused by artificial selection will be produced. The selection by\r\nnature of the forms fittest to survive is what Darwin meant by natural\r\nselection. We can never understand the application, however, unless\r\nwe take into account the fact that while animals tend to multiply in\r\ngeometrical progression, as a matter of fact the number of any one\r\nkind remains practically constant. Although the face of nature seems\r\nundisturbed, there is nevertheless a struggle for existence among all\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThis is easily illustrated when we take into account the breeding\r\nof fishes. The trout, for illustration, lays from 60,000 to 100,000\r\neggs. If the majority of these arrived at maturity and gave rise to\r\nprogeny, the next generation would represent a prodigious number, and\r\nthe numbers in the succeeding generations would increase so rapidly\r\nthat soon there would not be room in the fresh waters of the earth to\r\ncontain their descendants. What becomes of the immense number of fishes\r\nthat die? They fall a prey to others, or they are not able to get food\r\nin competition with other more hardy relatives, so that it is not a\r\nmatter of chance that determines which ones shall survive; those which\r\nare the strongest, the better fitted to their surroundings, are the\r\nones which will be perpetuated.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of this struggle for existence in nature, and the\r\nconsequent survival of the fittest, shows us more clearly what is meant\r\nby natural selection. Instead of man making the selection of those\r\nparticular forms that are to survive, it is accomplished in the course\r\nof nature. This is natural selection.\r\n\r\nVarious Aspects of Natural Selection.--Further illustrations are needed\r\nto give some idea of the various phases of natural selection. Speed\r\nin such animals as antelopes may be the particular thing which leads\r\nto their protection. It stands to reason that those with the greatest\r\nspeed would escape more readily from their enemies, and would be the\r\nparticular ones to survive, while the weaker and slower ones would fall\r\nvictims to their prey. In all kinds of strain due to scarcity of food,\r\ninclemency of weather, and other untoward circumstances, the forms\r\nwhich are the strongest, physiologically speaking, will have the best\r\nchance to weather the strain and to survive. As another illustration,\r\nDarwin pointed out that natural selection had produced a long-legged\r\nrace of prairie wolves, while the timber wolves, which have less\r\noccasion for running, are short-legged.\r\n\r\nWe can also see the operation of natural selection in the production of\r\nthe sharp eyes of birds of prey. Let us consider the way in which the\r\neyes of the hawk have been perfected by evolution. Natural selection\r\ncompels the eye to come up to a certain standard. Those hawks that are\r\nborn with weak or defective vision cannot cope with the conditions\r\nunder which they get their food. The sharp-eyed forms would be the\r\nfirst to discern their prey, and the most sure in seizing upon it.\r\nTherefore, those with defective vision or with vision that falls below\r\nthe standard will be at a very great disadvantage. The sharp-eyed\r\nforms will be preserved by a selective process. Nature selects, we may\r\nsay, the keener-eyed birds of prey for survival, and it is easy to see\r\nthat this process of natural selection would establish and maintain a\r\nstandard of vision.\r\n\r\nBut natural selection tends merely to adapt animals to their\r\nsurroundings, and does not always operate in the direction of\r\nincreasing the efficiency of the organ. We take another illustration to\r\nshow how Darwin explains the origin of races of short-winged beetles on\r\ncertain oceanic islands. Madeira and other islands, as Kerguelen island\r\nof the Indian Ocean, are among the most windy places in the world.\r\nThe strong-winged beetles, being accustomed to disport themselves in\r\nthe air, would be carried out to sea by the sudden and violent gales\r\nwhich sweep over those islands, while the weaker-winged forms would\r\nbe left to perpetuate their kind. Thus, generation after generation,\r\nthe strong-winged beetles would be eliminated by a process of natural\r\nselection, and there would be left a race of short-winged beetles\r\nderived from long-winged ancestors. In this case the organs are\r\nreduced in their development, rather than increased; but manifestly\r\nthe short-winged race of beetles is better adapted to live under the\r\nparticular conditions that surround their life in these islands.\r\n\r\nWhile this is not a case of increase in the particular organ, it\r\nillustrates a progressive series of steps whereby the organism becomes\r\nbetter adapted to its surroundings. A similar instance is found in\r\nthe suppression of certain sets of organs in internal parasites. For\r\nillustration, the tapeworm loses particular organs of digestion for\r\nwhich it does not have continued use; but the reproductive organs, upon\r\nwhich the continuance of its life depends, are greatly increased. Such\r\ncases as the formation of short-winged beetles show us that the action\r\nof natural selection is not always to preserve what we should call\r\nthe best, but simply to preserve the fittest. Development, therefore,\r\nunder the guidance of natural selection is not always progressive.\r\nSelection by nature does not mean the formation and preservation of the\r\nideally perfect, but merely the survival of those best fitted to their\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nColor.--The various ways in which natural selection acts are\r\nexceedingly diversified. The colors of animals may be a factor in\r\ntheir preservation, as the stripes on the zebra tending to make it\r\ninconspicuous in its surroundings. The stripes upon the sides of\r\ntigers simulate the shadows cast by the jungle grass in which the\r\nanimals live, and serves to conceal them from their prey as well as\r\nfrom enemies. Those animals that assume a white color in winter become\r\nthereby less conspicuous, and they are protected by their coloration.\r\n\r\nAs further illustrating color as a factor in the preservation of\r\nanimals, we may cite a story originally told by Professor E.S. Morse.\r\nWhen he was collecting shells on the white sand of the Japanese coast,\r\nhe noticed numerous white tiger-beetles, which could scarcely be seen\r\nagainst the white background. They could be detected chiefly by their\r\nshadows when the sun was shining. As he walked along the coast he\r\ncame to a wide band of lava which had flowed from a crater across the\r\nintervening country and plunged into the sea, leaving a broad dark\r\nband some miles in breadth across the white sandy beach. As he passed\r\nfrom the white sand to the dark lava, his attention was attracted to a\r\ntiger-beetle almost identical with the white one except as to color.\r\nInstead of being white, it was black. He found this broad, black band\r\nof lava inhabited by the black tiger beetle, and found very few, if\r\nany, of the white kind. This is a striking illustration of what has\r\noccurred in nature. These two beetles are of the same species, and in\r\nexamining the conditions under which they grow, it is discovered that\r\nout of the eggs laid by the original white forms, there now and then\r\nappears one of a dusky or black color. Consider how conspicuous this\r\ndark object would be against the white background of sand. It would be\r\nan easy mark for the birds of prey that fly about, and therefore on the\r\nwhite surface the black beetles would be destroyed, while the white\r\nones would be left. But on the black background of lava the conditions\r\nare reversed. There the white forms would be the conspicuous ones; as\r\nthey wandered upon the black surface, they would be picked up by birds\r\nof prey and the black ones would be left. Thus we see another instance\r\nof the operation of natural selection.\r\n\r\nMimicry.--We have, likewise, in nature a great number of cases that are\r\ndesignated mimicry. For illustration, certain caterpillars assume a\r\nstiff position, resembling a twig from a branch. We have also leaf-like\r\nbutterflies. The Kallima of India is a conspicuous illustration of a\r\nbutterfly having the upper surface of its wings bright-colored, and the\r\nlower surface dull. When it settles upon a twig the wings are closed\r\nand the under-sides have a mark across them resembling the mid-rib of\r\na leaf, so that the whole butterfly in the resting position becomes\r\ninconspicuous, being protected by mimicry.\r\n\r\nOne can readily see how natural selection would be evoked in order\r\nto explain this condition of affairs. Those forms that varied in the\r\ndirection of looking like a leaf would be the most perfectly protected,\r\nand this feature being fostered by natural selection, would, in the\r\ncourse of time, produce a race of butterflies the resemblance of whose\r\nfolded wings to a leaf would serve as a protection from enemies.\r\n\r\nIt may not be out of place to remind the reader that the illustrations\r\ncited are introduced merely to elucidate Darwin's theory and the writer\r\nis not committed to accepting them as explanations of the phenomena\r\ninvolved. He is not unmindful of the force of the criticisms against\r\nthe adequacy of natural selection to explain the evolution of all kinds\r\nof organic structures.\r\n\r\nMany other instances of the action of color might be added, such as the\r\nwearing of warning colors, those colors which belong to butterflies,\r\ngrubs, and other animals that have a noxious taste. These warning\r\ncolors have taught birds to leave alone the forms possessing those\r\ncolors. Sometimes forms which do not possess a disagreeable taste\r\nsecure protection by mimicking the colors of the noxious varieties.\r\n\r\nSexual Selection.--There is an entirely different set of cases which\r\nat first sight would seem difficult to explain on the principle of\r\nselection. How, for instance, could we explain the feathers in the\r\ntails of the birds of paradise, or that peculiar arrangement of\r\nfeathers in the tail of the lyre-bird, or the gorgeous display of\r\ntail-feathers of the male peacock? Here Mr. Darwin seized upon a\r\nselective principle arising from the influence of mating. The male\r\nbirds in becoming suitors for a particular female have been accustomed\r\nto display their tail-feathers; the one with the most attractive\r\ndisplay excites the pairing instinct in the highest degree, and becomes\r\nthe selected suitor. In this way, through the operation of a form of\r\nselection which Darwin designates sexual selection, possibly such\r\ncurious adaptations as the peacock's tail may be accounted for.\r\n\r\nIt should be pointed out that this part of the theory is almost wholly\r\ndiscredited by biologists. Experimental evidence is against it.\r\nNevertheless in a descriptive account of Darwin's theory it may be\r\nallowed to stand without critical comment.\r\n\r\nInadequacy of Natural Selection.--In nature, under the struggle for\r\nexistence, the fittest will be preserved; and natural selection will\r\noperate toward the elaboration or the suppression of certain organs\r\nor certain characteristics when the elaboration or the suppression\r\nis of advantage to the animal form. Much has been said of late as to\r\nthe inadequacy of natural selection. Herbert Spencer and Huxley, both\r\naccepting natural selection as one of the factors, doubted its complete\r\nadequacy.\r\n\r\nOne point is often overlooked, and should be brought out with\r\nclearness; _viz._, that Darwin himself was the first to point out\r\nclearly the inadequacy of natural selection as a universal law for the\r\nproduction of the great variety of animals and plants. In the second\r\nedition of the _Origin of Species_ he says: \"But, as my conclusions\r\nhave lately been much misrepresented, and it has been stated that I\r\nattribute the modification of species exclusively to natural selection,\r\nI may be permitted to remark that in the first edition of this work and\r\nsubsequently I placed in a most conspicuous position,--namely, at the\r\nclose of the introduction--the following words: 'I am convinced that\r\nnatural selection has been the main, but not the exclusive means of\r\nmodification.' This has been of no avail. Great is the power of steady\r\nmisrepresentation. But the history of science shows that fortunately\r\nthis power does not long endure.\"\r\n\r\nThe reaction against the all-sufficiency of natural selection,\r\ntherefore, is something which was anticipated by Darwin, and the\r\nquotation made above will be a novelty to many of our readers who\r\nsupposed that they understood Darwin's position.\r\n\r\nConfusion between Lamarck's and Darwin's Theories.--Besides the failure\r\nto understand what Darwin has written, there is great confusion,\r\nboth in pictures and in writings, in reference to the theories of\r\nDarwin and Lamarck. Poulton illustrated a state of confusion in one\r\nof his lectures on the theory of organic evolution, and the following\r\ninstances are quoted from memory.\r\n\r\nWe are most of us familiar with such pictures as the following: A\r\nman standing and waving his arms; in the next picture these arms and\r\nhands become enlarged, and in the successive pictures they undergo\r\ntransformations into wings, and the transference is made into a flying\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nSuch pictures are designated \"The origin of flight after Darwin.\" The\r\ninteresting circumstance is this, that the illustration does not apply\r\nto Darwin's idea of natural selection at all, but is pure Lamarckism.\r\nLamarck contended for the production of new organs through the\r\ninfluence of use and disuse, and this particular illustration refers to\r\nthat, and not to natural selection at all.\r\n\r\nAmong the examples of ridicule to which Darwin's ideas have been\r\nexposed, we cite one verse from the song of Lord Neaves. His lordship\r\nwrote a song with a large number of verses hitting off in jocular vein\r\nmany of the claims and foibles of his time. In attempting to make fun\r\nof Darwin's idea he misses completely the idea of natural selection,\r\nbut hits upon the principle enunciated by Lamarck, instead. He says:\r\n\r\n \"A deer with a neck which was longer by half\r\n Than the rest of his family's--try not to laugh--\r\n By stretching and stretching became a giraffe,\r\n Which nobody can deny.\"\r\n\r\nThe clever young woman, Miss Kendall, however, in her _Song of the\r\nIchthyosaurus_, showed clearness in grasping Darwin's idea when she\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n \"Ere man was developed, our brother,\r\n We swam, we ducked, and we dived,\r\n And we dined, as a rule, on each other.\r\n What matter? The toughest survived.\"\r\n\r\nThis hits the idea of natural selection. The other two illustrations\r\nmiss it, but strike the principle which was enunciated by Lamarck. This\r\nconfusion between Lamarckism and Darwinism is very wide-spread.\r\n\r\nDarwin's book on the _Origin of Species_, published in 1859, was\r\nepoch-making. If a group of scholars were asked to designate the\r\ngreatest book of the nineteenth century--that is, the book which\r\ncreated the greatest intellectual stir--it is likely that a large\r\nproportion of them would reply that it is Darwin's _Origin of Species_.\r\nIts influence was so great in the different domains of thought that\r\nwe may observe a natural cleavage between the thought in reference to\r\nnature between 1859 and all preceding time. His other less widely known\r\nbooks on _Animals and Plants Under Domestication_, the _Descent of\r\nMan_, etc., etc., are also important contributions to the discussion\r\nof his theory. A brief account of Darwin, the man, will be found in\r\nChapter XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHEORIES OF EVOLUTION CONTINUED: WEISMANN, DE VRIES\r\n\r\n\r\nWeismann's views have passed through various stages of remodeling since\r\nhis first public championship of the Theory of Descent on assuming,\r\nin 1867, the position of professor of zoölogy in the University of\r\nFreiburg. Some time after that date he originated his now famous theory\r\nof heredity, which has been retouched, from time to time, as the result\r\nof aggressive criticism from others, and the expansion of his own\r\nmental horizon. As he said in 1904, regarding his lectures on evolution\r\nwhich have been delivered almost regularly every year since 1880, they\r\n\"were gradually modified in accordance with the state of my knowledge\r\nat the time, so that they have been, I may say, a mirror of my own\r\nintellectual evolution.\"\r\n\r\nPassing over his book, _The Germ Plasm_, published in English in 1893,\r\nwe may fairly take his last book, _The Evolution Theory_, 1904, as the\r\nbest exposition of his conclusions. The theoretical views of Weismann\r\nhave been the field of so much strenuous controversy that it will\r\nbe well perhaps to take note of the spirit in which they have been\r\npresented. In the preface of his book just mentioned, he says: \"I make\r\nthis attempt to sum up and present as a harmonious whole the theories\r\nwhich for forty years I have been gradually building up on the basis\r\nof the legacy of the great workers of the past, and on the results of\r\nmy own investigations and those of my fellow-workers, not because\r\nI regard the picture as incomplete or incapable of improvement, but\r\nbecause I believe its essential features to be correct, and because\r\nan eye-trouble which has hindered my work for many years makes it\r\nuncertain whether I shall have much more time and strength granted to\r\nme for its further elaboration.\"\r\n\r\nThe germ-plasm theory is primarily a theory of heredity, and only when\r\nconnected with other considerations does it become the full-fledged\r\ntheory of evolution known as Weismannism. The theory as a whole\r\ninvolves so many intricate details that it is difficult to make a clear\r\nstatement of it for general readers. If in considering the theories of\r\nLamarck and Darwin it was found advantageous to confine attention to\r\nsalient points and to omit details, it is all the more essential to do\r\nso in the discussion of Weismann's theory.\r\n\r\nIn his prefatory note to the English edition of _The Evolution Theory_\r\nThomson, the translator, summarizes Weismann's especial contributions\r\nas: \"(1) the illumination of the evolution process with a wealth of\r\nfresh illustrations; (2) the vindication of the 'germ-plasm' concept\r\nas a valuable working hypothesis; (3) the final abandonment of any\r\nassumption of transmissible acquired characters; (4) a further analysis\r\nof the nature and origin of variations; and (5), above all, an\r\nextension of the selection principle of Darwin and Wallace, which finds\r\nits logical outcome in the suggestive theory of germinal selection.\"\r\n\r\nContinuity of the Germ-Plasm.--Weismann's theory is designated that\r\nof continuity of the germ-plasm, and in considering it we must first\r\ngive attention to his conception of the germ-plasm. As is well known,\r\nanimals and plants spring from germinal elements of microscopic size;\r\nthese are, in plants, the spores, the seeds, and their fertilizing\r\nagents; and, in animals, the eggs and the sperms. Now, since all\r\nanimals, even the highest developed, begin in a fertilized egg, that\r\nstructure, minute as it is, must contain all hereditary qualities,\r\nsince it is the only material substance that passes from one generation\r\nto another. This hereditary substance is the germ-plasm. It is the\r\nliving, vital substance of organisms that takes part in the development\r\nof new generations.\r\n\r\nNaturalists are agreed on this point, that the more complex animals\r\nand plants have been derived from the simpler ones; and, this being\r\naccepted, the attention should be fixed on the nature of the connection\r\nbetween generations during their long line of descent. In the\r\nreproduction of single-celled organisms, the substance of the entire\r\nbody is divided during the transmission of life, and the problem both\r\nof heredity and origin is relatively simple. It is clear that in these\r\nsingle-celled creatures there is unbroken continuity of body-substance\r\nfrom generation to generation. But in the higher animals only a minute\r\nportion of the organism is passed along.\r\n\r\nWeismann points out that the many-celled body was gradually produced by\r\nevolution; and that in the transmission of life by the higher animals\r\nthe continuity is not between body-cells and their like, but only\r\nbetween germinal elements around which in due course new body-cells are\r\ndeveloped. Thus he regards the body-cells as constituting a sort of\r\nvehicle within which the germ-cells are carried. The germinal elements\r\nrepresent the primordial substance around which the body has been\r\ndeveloped, and since in all the long process of evolution the germinal\r\nelements have been the only form of connection between different\r\ngenerations, they have an unbroken continuity.\r\n\r\nThis conception of the continuity of the germ-plasm is the foundation\r\nof Weismann's doctrine. As indicated before, the general way in which\r\nhe accounts for heredity is that the offspring is like the parent\r\nbecause it is composed of some of the same stuff. The rise of the idea\r\nof germinal continuity has been indicated in Chapter XIV, where it was\r\npointed out that Weismann was not the originator of the idea, but he is\r\nnevertheless the one who has developed it the most extensively.\r\n\r\nComplexity of the Germ-Plasm.--The germ-plasm has been molded for\r\nso many centuries by external circumstances that it has acquired an\r\norganization of great complexity. This appears from the following\r\nconsiderations: Protoplasm is impressionable; in fact, its most\r\ncharacteristic feature is that it responds to stimulation and\r\nmodifies itself accordingly. These subtle changes occurring within\r\nthe protoplasm affect its organization, and in the long run it is the\r\nsummation of experiences that determines what the protoplasm shall be\r\nand how it will behave in development. Two masses of protoplasm differ\r\nin capabilities and potentialities according to the experiences through\r\nwhich they have passed, and no two will be absolutely identical. All\r\nthe time the body was being evolved the protoplasm of the germinal\r\nelements was being molded and changed, and these elements therefore\r\npossess an inherited organization of great complexity.\r\n\r\nWhen the body is built anew from the germinal elements, the derived\r\nqualities come into play, and the whole process is a succession of\r\nresponses to stimulation. This is in a sense, on the part of the\r\nprotoplasm, a repeating of its historical experience. In building the\r\norganism it does not go over the ground for the first time, but repeats\r\nthe activities which it took centuries to acquire.\r\n\r\nThe evident complexity of the germ-plasm made it necessary for\r\nWeismann, in attempting to explain inheritance in detail, to assume the\r\nexistence of distinct vital units within the protoplasm of the germinal\r\nelements. He has invented names for these particular units as biophors,\r\nthe elementary vital units, and their combination into determinants,\r\nthe latter being united into ids, idants, etc. The way in which he\r\nassumes the interactions of these units gives to his theory a highly\r\nspeculative character. The conception of the complex organization of\r\nthe germ-plasm which Weismann reached on theoretical grounds is now\r\nbeing established on the basis of observation (see Chapter XIV, p. 313).\r\n\r\nThe Origin of Variations.--The way in which Weismann accounts for\r\nthe origin of variation among higher animals is both ingenious and\r\ninteresting. In all higher organisms the sexes are separate, and the\r\nreproduction of their kind is a sexual process. The germinal elements\r\ninvolved are seeds and pollen, eggs and sperms. In animals the egg\r\nbears all the hereditary qualities from the maternal side, and the\r\nsperm those from the paternal side. The intimate mixture of these in\r\nfertilization gives great possibilities of variations arising from the\r\ndifferent combinations and permutations of the vital units within the\r\ngerm-plasm.\r\n\r\nThis union of two germ-plasms Weismann calls amphimixis, and for a long\r\ntime he maintained that the purpose of sexual reproduction in nature is\r\nto give origin to variations. Later he extended his idea to include a\r\nselection, mainly on the basis of nutrition, among the vital elements\r\ncomposing the germ-plasm. This is germinal selection, which aids in the\r\nproduction of variations.\r\n\r\nIn _The Evolution Theory_, volume II, page 196, he says: \"Now that I\r\nunderstand these processes more clearly, my opinion is that the roots\r\nof all heritable variation lie in the germ-plasm; and, furthermore,\r\nthat the determinants are continually oscillating hither and thither\r\nin response to very minute nutritive changes and are readily compelled\r\nto _variation in a definite direction_, which may ultimately lead to\r\nconsiderable variations in the structure of the species, if they are\r\nfavored by personal selection, or at least if they are not suppressed\r\nby it as prejudicial.\"\r\n\r\nBut while sexual reproduction may be evoked to explain the origin of\r\nvariation in higher animals, Weismann thought it was not applicable to\r\nthe lower ones, and he found himself driven to assume that variation in\r\nsingle-celled organisms is owing to the direct influence of environment\r\nupon them, and thus he had an awkward assumption of variations arising\r\nin a different manner in the higher and in the simplest organisms. If I\r\ncorrectly understand his present position, the conception of variation\r\nas due to the direct influence of environment is being surrendered in\r\nfavor of the action of germinal selection among the simplest organisms.\r\n\r\nExtension of the Principle of Natural Selection.--These variations,\r\nonce started, will be fostered by natural selection provided they are\r\nof advantage to the organism in its struggle for existence. It should\r\nbe pointed out that Weismann is a consistent Darwinian; he not only\r\nadopts the principle of natural selection, but he extends the field\r\nof its operation from externals to the internal parts of the germinal\r\nelements.\r\n\r\n\"Roux and others have elaborated the idea of a struggle of the parts\r\nwithin the organism, and of a corresponding intra-selection; ... but\r\nWeismann, after his manner, has carried the selection-idea a step\r\nfarther, and has pictured the struggle among the determining elements\r\nof the germ-cell's organization. It is at least conceivable that the\r\nstronger 'determinants,' _i.e._, the particles embodying the rudiments\r\nof certain qualities, will make more of the food-supply than those\r\nwhich are weaker, and that a selective process will ensue\" (Thomson).\r\nThis is the conception of germinal selection.\r\n\r\nHe has also extended the application of the general doctrine of natural\r\nselection by supplying a great number of new illustrations.\r\n\r\nThe whole theory of Weismann is so well constructed that it is very\r\nalluring. Each successive position is worked out with such detail and\r\napt illustration that if one follows him step by step without dissent\r\non some fundamental principle, his conclusion seems justified. As a\r\nsystem it has been elaborated until it makes a coherent appeal to the\r\nintellect.\r\n\r\nInheritance of Acquired Characters.--Another fundamental point\r\nin Weismann's theory is the denial that acquired characters are\r\ntransmitted from parent to offspring. Probably the best single\r\ndiscussion of this subject is contained in his book on _The Evolution\r\nTheory_, 1904, to which readers are referred.\r\n\r\nA few illustrations will be in place. Acquired characters are\r\nany acquisitions made by the body-cells during the lifetime of\r\nan individual. They may be obvious, as skill in piano-playing,\r\nbicycle-riding, etc.; or they may be very recondite, as turns of the\r\nintellect, acquired beliefs, etc. Acquired bodily characters may\r\nbe forcibly impressed upon the organism, as the facial mutilations\r\npracticed by certain savage tribes, the docking of the tails of horses,\r\nof dogs, etc. The question is, Are any acquired characters, physical or\r\nmental, transmitted by inheritance?\r\n\r\nManifestly, it will be difficult to determine on a scientific basis\r\nwhether or not such qualities are inheritable. One would naturally\r\nthink first of applying the test of experiment to supposed cases of\r\nsuch inheritances, and this is the best ground to proceed on.\r\n\r\nIt has been maintained on the basis of the classical experiments of\r\nBrown-Séquard on guinea-pigs that induced epilepsy is transmitted\r\nto offspring; and, also, on the basis of general observations, that\r\ncertain bodily mutilations are inherited. Weismann's analysis of the\r\nwhole situation is very incisive. He experimented by cutting off the\r\ntails of both parents of breeding mice. The experiments were carried\r\nthrough twenty-two generations, both parents being deprived of\r\ntheir tails, without yielding any evidence that the mutilations were\r\ninheritable.\r\n\r\nTo take one other case that is less superficial, it is generally\r\nbelieved that the thirst for alcoholic liquors has been transmitted to\r\nthe children of drunkards, and while Weismann admits the possibility\r\nof this, he maintains that it is owing to the germinal elements being\r\nexposed to the influence of the alcohol circulating in the blood of\r\nthe parent or parents; and if this be the case it would not be the\r\ninheritance of an acquired character, but the response of the organism\r\nto a drug producing directly a variation in the germ-plasm.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the well-defined opposition of Weismann, the\r\ninheritance of acquired characters is still a mooted question. Herbert\r\nSpencer argued in favor of it, and during his lifetime had many a\r\npointed controversy with Weismann. Eimer stands unalterably against\r\nWeismann's position, and the Neo-Lamarckians stand for the direct\r\ninheritance of useful variations in bodily structure. The question is\r\nstill undetermined and is open to experimental observation. In its\r\npresent state there are competent observers maintaining both sides,\r\nbut it must be confessed that there is not a single case in which the\r\nsupposed inheritance of an acquired character has stood the test of\r\ncritical examination.\r\n\r\nThe basis of Weismann's argument is not difficult to understand.\r\nAcquired characters affect the body-cells, and according to his view\r\nthe latter are simply a vehicle for the germinal elements, which\r\nare the only things concerned in the transmission of hereditary\r\nqualities. Inheritance, therefore, must come through alterations in the\r\ngerm-plasm, and not directly through changes in the body-cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 114.--August Weismann, Born 1834.\r\n\r\nPermission of Charles Scribner's Sons.]\r\n\r\nWeismann, the Man.--The man who for more than forty years has been\r\nelaborating this theory (Fig. 114) is still living and actively at\r\nwork in the University of Freiburg. August Weismann was born at\r\nFrankfort-on-the-Main in 1834. He was graduated at Göttingen in 1856,\r\nand for a short time thereafter engaged in the practice of medicine.\r\nThis line of activity did not, however, satisfy his nature, and he\r\nturned to the pursuit of microscopic investigations in embryology and\r\nmorphology, being encouraged in this work by Leuckart, whose name we\r\nhave already met in this history. In 1863 he settled in Freiburg as\r\n_privat-docent_, and has remained connected with the university ever\r\nsince. From 1867 onward he has occupied the chair of zoölogy in that\r\ninstitution. He has made his department famous, especially by his\r\nlectures on the theory of descent.\r\n\r\nHe is a forceful and interesting lecturer. One of his hearers in 1896\r\nwrote: \"His lecture-room is always full, and his popularity among his\r\nstudents fully equals his fame among scientists.\"\r\n\r\nIt is quite generally known that Weismann since he reached the age\r\nof thirty has been afflicted with an eye-trouble, but the inference\r\nsometimes made by those unacquainted with his work as an investigator,\r\nthat he has been obliged to forego practical work in the field in which\r\nhe has speculated, is wrong. At intervals his eyes have strengthened\r\nso that he has been able to apply himself to microscopic observations,\r\nand he has a distinguished record as an observer. In embryology his\r\nstudies on the development of the diptera, and of the eggs of daphnid\r\ncrustacea, are well known, as are also his observations on variations\r\nin butterflies and other arthropods.\r\n\r\nHe is an accomplished musician, and during the period of his enforced\r\ninactivity in scientific work he found much solace in playing \"a good\r\ndeal of music.\" \"His continuous eye trouble must have been a terrible\r\nobstacle, but may have been the prime cause of turning him to the\r\ntheories with which his name is connected.\"\r\n\r\nIn a short autobiography published in _The Lamp_ in 1903, although\r\nwritten several years earlier, he gives a glimpse of his family life.\r\n\"During the ten years (1864-1874) of my enforced inactivity and rest\r\noccurred my marriage with Fräulein Marie Gruber, who became the mother\r\nof my children and was my true companion for twenty years, until\r\nher death. Of her now I think only with love and gratitude. She was\r\nthe one who, more than any one else, helped me through the gloom of\r\nthis period. She read much to me at this time, for she read aloud\r\nexcellently, and she not only took an interest in my theoretical and\r\nexperimental work, but she also gave practical assistance in it.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1893 he published _The Germ-Plasm, A Theory of Heredity_, a treatise\r\nwhich elicited much discussion. From that time on he has been actively\r\nengaged in replying to his critics and in perfecting his system of\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nThe Mutation-Theory of De Vries.--Hugo de Vries (Fig. 115), director\r\nof the Botanical Garden in Amsterdam, has experimented widely with the\r\ngrowth of plants, especially the evening primrose, and has shown that\r\ndifferent species appear to rise suddenly. The sudden variations that\r\nbreed true, and thus give rise to new forms, he calls mutations, and\r\nthis indicates the source of the name applied to his theory.\r\n\r\nIn his _Die Mutationstheorie_, published in 1901, he argues for the\r\nrecognition of mutations as the universal source of the origin of\r\nspecies. Although he evokes natural selection for the perpetuation\r\nand improvement of variations, and points out that his theory is\r\nnot antagonistic to that of natural selection, it is nevertheless\r\ndirectly at variance with Darwin's fundamental conception--that slight\r\nindividual variations \"are probably the sole differences which are\r\neffective in the production of new species\" and that \"as natural\r\nselection acts solely by accumulating slight, successive, favorable\r\nvariations, it can produce no great or sudden modifications.\" The\r\nfoundation of De Vries's theory is that \"species have not arisen\r\nthrough gradual selection, continued for hundreds or thousands of\r\nyears, but by jumps through sudden, through small transformations.\"\r\n(Whitman's translation.)\r\n\r\nThe work of De Vries is a most important contribution to the study of\r\nthe origin of species, and is indicative of the fact that many factors\r\nmust be taken into consideration when one attempts to analyze the\r\nprocess of organic evolution. One great value of his work is that it\r\nis based on experiments, and that it has given a great stimulus to\r\nexperimental studies. Experiment was likewise a dominant feature in\r\nDarwin's work, but that seems to have been almost overlooked in the\r\ndiscussions aroused by his conclusions; De Vries, by building upon\r\nexperimental evidence, has led naturalists to realize that the method\r\nof evolution is not a subject for argumentative discussion, but for\r\nexperimental investigation. This is most commendable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 115.--Hugo de Vries.]\r\n\r\nDe Vries's theory tends also to widen the field of exploration.\r\nDavenport, Tower, and others have made it clear that species may\r\narise by slow accumulations of trivial variations, and that, while\r\nthe formation of species by mutation may be admitted, there is still\r\nabundant evidence of evolution without mutation.\r\n\r\nReconciliation of Different Theories.--All this is leading to a clearer\r\nappreciation of the points involved in the discussion of the theories\r\nof evolution; the tendency is not for the breach between the different\r\ntheories to be widened, but for evolutionists to realize more fully\r\nthe great complexity of the process they are trying to explain, and\r\nto see that no single factor can carry the burden of an explanation.\r\nMutation is not a substitute for natural selection, but a coöperating\r\nfactor; and neither mutation nor natural selection is a substitute for\r\nthe doctrine of the continuity of the germ-plasm. Thus we may look\r\nforward to a reconciliation between apparently conflicting views, when\r\nnaturalists by sifting shall have determined the truth embodied in\r\nthe various theories. One conviction that is looming into prominence\r\nis that this will be promoted by less argument and more experimental\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nThat the solution of the underlying question in evolution will still\r\nrequire a long time is evident; as Whitman said in his address before\r\nthe Congress of Arts and Science in St. Louis in 1904: \"The problem of\r\nproblems in biology to-day, the problem which promises to sweep through\r\nthe present century as it has the past one, with cumulative interest\r\nand correspondingly important results, is the one which became the\r\nlife-work of Charles Darwin, and which can not be better or more simply\r\nexpressed than in the title of his epoch-making book, _The Origin of\r\nSpecies_.\"\r\n\r\nSummary.--The number of points involved in the four theories considered\r\nabove is likely to be rather confusing, and we may now bring them into\r\nclose juxtaposition. The salient features of these theories are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Lamarck's Theory of Evolution.\r\n\r\n 1. Variation is explained on the principle of use and disuse.\r\n\r\n 2. Heredity: The variations are inherited directly and improved in\r\n succeeding generations.\r\n\r\n A long time and favorable conditions are required for the production\r\n of new species.\r\n\r\nII. Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection.\r\n\r\n 1. Variations assumed.\r\n\r\n 2. Heredity: Those slight variations which are of use to the organism\r\n will be perpetuated by inheritance.\r\n\r\n 3. Natural selection is the distinguishing feature of the theory.\r\n Through the struggle for existence nature selects those best fitted to\r\n survive. The selection of trivial variations that are of advantage to\r\n the organism, and their gradual improvement, leads to the production\r\n of new species.\r\n\r\nIII. Weismann's Theory of Continuity of the Germ-plasm.\r\n\r\n 1. The germ-plasm has had unbroken continuity from the beginning\r\n of life. Owing to its impressionable nature, it has an inherited\r\n organization of great complexity.\r\n\r\n 2. Heredity is accounted for on the principle that the offspring is\r\n composed of some of the same stuff as its parents. The body-cells are\r\n not inherited, _i.e._,\r\n\r\n 3. There is no inheritance of acquired characters.\r\n\r\n 4. Variations arise from the union of the germinal elements, giving\r\n rise to varied combinations and permutations of the qualities of the\r\n germ-plasm. The purpose of amphimixis is to give rise to variations.\r\n The direct influence of environment has produced variations in\r\n unicellular organisms.\r\n\r\n 5. Weismann adopts and extends the principle of natural selection.\r\n Germinal selection is exhibited in the germ-plasm.\r\n\r\nIV. De Vries's Theory of Mutations.\r\n\r\n 1. The formation of species is due not to gradual changes, but to\r\n sudden mutations.\r\n\r\n 2. Natural selection presides over and improves variations arising\r\n from mutation.\r\n\r\nAmong the other theories of evolution that of Eimer is the most\r\nnotable. He maintains that variations in organisms take place not\r\nfortuitously or accidentally, but follow a perfectly determinate\r\ndirection. This definitely directed evolution is called orthogenesis.\r\nHe insists that there is continuous inheritance of acquired characters,\r\nand he is radically opposed to the belief that natural selection plays\r\nan important part in evolution. The title of his pamphlet published\r\nin 1898, _On Orthogenesis and the Impotence of Natural Selection in\r\nSpecies-Formation_, gives an indication of his position in reference to\r\nnatural selection. A consideration of Eimer's argument would be beyond\r\nthe purpose of this book.\r\n\r\nThe cause for the general confusion in the popular mind regarding\r\nany distinction between organic evolution and Darwinism is not far\r\nto seek. As has been shown, Lamarck launched the doctrine of organic\r\nevolution, but his views did not even get a public hearing. Then, after\r\na period of temporary disappearance, the doctrine of evolution emerged\r\nagain in 1859. And this time the discussion of the general theory\r\ncentered around Darwin's hypothesis of natural selection. It is quite\r\nnatural, therefore, that people should think that Darwinism and organic\r\nevolution are synonymous terms. The distinction between the general\r\ntheory and any particular explanation of it has, I trust, been made\r\nsufficiently clear in the preceding pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF EVOLUTIONARY THOUGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nA current of evolutionary thought can be traced through the literature\r\ndealing with organic nature from ancient times. It began as a small\r\nrill among the Greek philosophers and dwindles to a mere thread in the\r\nMiddle Ages, sometimes almost disappearing, but is never completely\r\nbroken off. Near the close of the eighteenth century it suddenly\r\nexpands, and becomes a broad and prevailing influence in the nineteenth\r\ncentury. Osborn, in his book, _From the Greeks to Darwin_, traces\r\nthe continuity of evolutionary thought from the time of the Greek\r\nphilosophers to Darwin. The ancient phase, although interesting, was\r\nvague and general, and may be dismissed without much consideration.\r\nAfter the Renaissance naturalists were occupied with other aspects\r\nof nature-study. They were at first attempting to get a knowledge of\r\nanimals and plants as a whole, and later of their structure, their\r\ndevelopments, and their physiology, before questions of their origin\r\nwere brought under consideration.\r\n\r\nOpinion before Lamarck.--The period just prior to Lamarck is\r\nof particular interest. Since Lamarck was the first to give a\r\ncomprehensive and consistent theory of evolution, it will be\r\ninteresting to determine what was the state of opinion just prior to\r\nthe appearance of his writings. Studies of nature were in such shape\r\nat that time that the question of the origin of species arose, and\r\nthereafter it would not recede. This was owing mainly to the fact that\r\nRay and Linnæus by defining a species had fixed the attention of\r\nnaturalists upon the distinguishing features of the particular kinds of\r\nanimals and plants. Are species realities in nature? The consideration\r\nof this apparently simple question soon led to divergent views, and\r\nthen to warm controversies that extended over several decades of time.\r\n\r\nThe view first adopted without much thought and as a matter of course\r\nwas that species are fixed and constant; _i.e._, that the existing\r\nforms of animals and plants are the descendants of entirely similar\r\nparents that were originally created in pairs. This idea of the fixity\r\nof species was elevated to the position of a dogma in science as well\r\nas in theology. The opposing view, that species are changeable, arose\r\nin the minds of a few independent observers and thinkers, and, as has\r\nalready been pointed out, the discussion of this question resulted\r\nultimately in a complete change of view regarding nature and man's\r\nrelation to it. When the conception of evolution came upon the scene,\r\nit was violently combated. It came into conflict with the theory\r\ndesignated special creation.\r\n\r\nViews of Certain Fathers of the Church.--And now it is essential that\r\nwe should be clear as to the sources of this dogma of special creation.\r\nIt is perhaps natural to assume that there was a conflict existing\r\nbetween natural science and the views of the theologians from the\r\nearliest times; that is, between the scientific method and the method\r\nof the theologians, the latter being based on authority, and the former\r\nupon observation and experiment. Although there is a conflict between\r\nthese two methods, there nevertheless was a long period in which many\r\nof the leading theological thinkers were in harmony with the men of\r\nscience with reference to their general conclusions regarding creation.\r\nSome of the early Fathers of the Church exhibited a broader and more\r\nscientific spirit than their successors.\r\n\r\nSt. Augustine (353-430), in the fifth century, was the first of the\r\ngreat theologians to discuss specifically the question of creation.\r\nHis position is an enlightened one. He says: \"It very often happens\r\nthat there is some question as to the earth or the sky, or the other\r\nelements of this world ... respecting which one who is not a Christian\r\nhas knowledge derived from most certain reasoning or observation\" (that\r\nis, a scientific man); \"and it is very disgraceful and mischievous and\r\nof all things to be carefully avoided, that a Christian speaking of\r\nsuch matters as being according to the Christian Scriptures, should\r\nbe heard by an unbeliever talking such nonsense that the unbeliever,\r\nperceiving him to be as wide from the mark as east from west, can\r\nhardly restrain himself from laughing.\" (Quoted from Osborn.)\r\n\r\nAugustine's view of the method of creation was that of derivative\r\ncreation or creation _causaliter_. His was a naturalistic\r\ninterpretation of the Mosaic record, and a theory of gradual creation.\r\nHe held that in the beginning the earth and the waters of the earth\r\nwere endowed with power to produce plants and animals, and that it\r\nwas not necessary to assume that all creation was formed at once. He\r\ncautions his readers against looking to the Scriptures for scientific\r\ntruths. He said in reference to the creation that the days spoken of\r\nin the first chapter of Genesis could not be solar days of twenty-four\r\nhours each, but that they must stand for longer periods of time.\r\n\r\nThis view of St. Augustine is interesting as being less narrow\r\nand dogmatic than the position assumed by many theologians of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe next theologian to take up the question of creation was St.\r\nThomas Aquinas (1225-1274) in the thirteenth century. He quotes St.\r\nAugustine's view with approval, but does not contribute anything of\r\nhis own. One should not hastily conclude, however, because these\r\nviews were held by leaders of theological thought, that they were\r\nuniversally accepted. \"The truth is that all classes of theologians\r\ndeparted from the original philosophical and scientific standards of\r\nsome of the Fathers of the Church, and that special creation became the\r\nuniversal teaching from the middle of the sixteenth to the middle of\r\nthe nineteenth centuries.\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctrine of Special Creation.--About the seventeenth century a\r\nchange came about which was largely owing to the writings and influence\r\nof a Spanish theologian named Suarez (1548-1617). Although Suarez is\r\nnot the sole founder of this conception, it is certain, as Huxley\r\nhas shown, that he engaged himself with the questions raised by the\r\nBiblical account of creation; and, furthermore, that he opposed the\r\nviews that had been expressed by Augustine. In his tract upon the work\r\nof the six days (_Tractatus de opere sex dierum_) he takes exception\r\nto the views expressed by St. Augustine; he insisted that in the\r\nScriptural account of creation a day of twenty-four hours was meant,\r\nand in all other cases he insists upon a literal interpretation of the\r\nScriptures. Thus he introduced into theological thought the doctrine\r\nwhich goes under the name of special creation. The interesting feature\r\nin all this is that from the time of St. Augustine, in the fifth\r\ncentury, to the time when the ideas of Suarez began to prevail, in the\r\nseventeenth, there had been a harmonious relation between some of the\r\nleading theologians and scientific men in their outlook upon creation.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of Augustine and other theologians was largely owing to the\r\ninfluence of Aristotle. \"We know,\" says Osborn, \"that Greek philosophy\r\ntinctured early Christian theology; what is not so generally realized\r\nis that the Aristotelian notion of the development of life led to the\r\ntrue interpretation of the Mosaic account of the creation.\r\n\r\n\"There was in fact a long Greek period in the history of the\r\nevolutionary idea extending among the Fathers of the Church and later\r\namong some of the schoolmen, in their commentaries upon creation,\r\nwhich accord very closely with the modern theistic conception of\r\nevolution. If the orthodoxy of Augustine had remained the teaching of\r\nthe Church, the final establishment of evolution would have come far\r\nearlier than it did, certainly during the eighteenth century instead of\r\nthe nineteenth century, and the bitter controversy over this truth of\r\nnature would never have arisen.\"\r\n\r\nThe conception of special creation brought into especial prominence\r\nupon the Continent by Suarez was taken up by John Milton in his great\r\nepic _Paradise Lost_, in which he gave a picture of creation that\r\nmolded into specific form the opinion of the English-speaking clergy\r\nand of the masses who read his book. When the doctrine of organic\r\nevolution was announced, it came into conflict with this particular\r\nidea; and, as Huxley has very pointedly remarked, the new theory of\r\norganic evolution found itself in conflict with the Miltonic, rather\r\nthan the Mosaic cosmology. All this represents an interesting phase in\r\nintellectual development.\r\n\r\nForerunners of Lamarck.--We now take up the immediate predecessors of\r\nLamarck. Those to be mentioned are Buffon, Erasmus Darwin, and Goethe.\r\n\r\nBuffon (1707-1788) (Fig. 116), although of a more philosophical mind\r\nthan many of his contemporaries, was not a true investigator. That is,\r\nhe left no technical papers or contributions to science. From 1739\r\nto the time of his death he was the superintendent of the _Jardin du\r\nRoi_. He was a man of elegance, with an assured position in society.\r\nHe was a delightful writer, a circumstance that enabled him to make\r\nnatural history popular. It is said that the advance sheets of Buffon's\r\n_Histoire Naturelle_ were to be found on the tables of the boudoirs\r\nof ladies of fashion. In that work he suggested the idea that the\r\ndifferent forms of life were gradually produced, but his timidity and\r\nhis prudence led him to be obscure in what he said.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 116.--Buffon, 1707-1788.]\r\n\r\nPackard, who has studied his writings with care, says that he was an\r\nevolutionist through all periods of his life, not, as is commonly\r\nmaintained, believing first in the fixity of species, later in their\r\nchangeability, and lastly returning to his earlier position. \"The\r\nimpression left on the mind after reading Buffon is that even if he\r\nthrew out these suggestions and then retracted them, from fear of\r\nannoyance or even persecution from the bigots of his time, he did not\r\nhimself always take them seriously, but rather jotted them down as\r\npassing thoughts. Certainly he did not present them in the formal,\r\nforcible, and scientific way that Erasmus Darwin did. The result is\r\nthat the tentative views of Buffon, which have to be with much research\r\nextracted from the forty-four volumes of his works, would now be\r\nregarded as in a degree superficial and valueless. But they appeared\r\nthirty-four years before Lamarck's theory, and though not epoch-making,\r\nthey are such as will render the name of Buffon memorable for all\r\ntime.\" (Packard.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 117.--Erasmus Darwin, 1731-1802.]\r\n\r\nErasmus Darwin (Fig. 117) was the greatest of Lamarck's predecessors.\r\nIn 1794 he published the _Zoönomia_. In this work he stated ten\r\nprinciples; among them he vaguely suggested the transmission of\r\nacquired characteristics, the law of sexual selection--or the law\r\nof battle, as he called it--protective coloration, etc. His work\r\nreceived some notice from scholars. Paley's _Natural Theology_, for\r\nillustration, was written against it, although Paley is careful not to\r\nmention Darwin or his work. The success of Paley's book is probably one\r\nof the chief causes for the neglect into which the views of Buffon and\r\nErasmus Darwin fell.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as Darwin's conclusions were published before Lamarck's\r\nbook, it would be interesting to determine whether or not Lamarck was\r\ninfluenced by him. The careful consideration of this matter leads to\r\nthe conclusion that Lamarck drew his inspiration directly from nature,\r\nand that points of similarity between his views and those of Erasmus\r\nDarwin are to be looked upon as an example of parallelism in thought.\r\nIt is altogether likely that Lamarck was wholly unacquainted with\r\nDarwin's work, which had been published in England.\r\n\r\nGoethe's connection with the rise of evolutionary thought is in\r\na measure incidental. In 1790 he published his _Metamorphosis of\r\nPlants_, showing that flowers are modified leaves. This doctrine of\r\nmetamorphosis of parts he presently applied to the animal kingdom, and\r\nbrought forward his famous, but erroneous, vertebrate theory of the\r\nskull. As he meditated on the extent of modifications there arose in\r\nhis mind the conviction that all plants and animals have been evolved\r\nfrom the modification of a few parental types. Accordingly he should be\r\naccorded a place in the history of evolutionary thought.\r\n\r\nOpposition to Lamarck's Views.--Lamarck's doctrine, which was published\r\nin definite form in 1809, has been already outlined. We may well\r\ninquire, Why did not his views take hold? In the first place, they were\r\nnot accepted by Cuvier. Cuvier's opposition was strong and vigorous,\r\nand succeeded in causing the theory of Lamarck to be completely\r\nneglected by the French people. Again, we must recognize that the\r\ntime was not ripe for the acceptance of such truths; and, finally,\r\nthat there was no great principle enunciated by Lamarck which could be\r\nreadily understood as there was in Darwin's book on the doctrine of\r\nnatural selection.\r\n\r\nThe temporary disappearance of the doctrine of organic evolution which\r\noccurred after Lamarck expounded his theory was also owing to the\r\nreaction against the speculations of the school of _Natur-Philosophie_.\r\nThe extravagant speculation of Oken and the other representatives of\r\nthis school completely disgusted men who were engaged in research by\r\nobservation and experiment. The reaction against that school was so\r\nstrong that it was difficult to get a hearing for any theoretical\r\nspeculation; but Cuvier's influence must be looked upon as the chief\r\none in causing disregard for Lamarck's writings.\r\n\r\nThe work of Cuvier has been already considered in connection both with\r\ncomparative anatomy and zoölogy, but a few points must still be held\r\nunder consideration. Cuvier brought forward the idea of catastrophism\r\nin order to explain the disappearance of the groups of fossil animals.\r\nHe believed in the doctrine of spontaneous generation. He held to the\r\ndoctrine of pre-delineation, so that it must be admitted that whenever\r\nhe forsook observation for speculation he was singularly unhappy, and\r\nit is undeniable that his position of hostility in reference to the\r\nspeculation of Lamarck retarded the progress of science for nearly half\r\na century.\r\n\r\nCuvier and Saint-Hilaire.--In 1830 there occurred a memorable\r\ncontroversy between Cuvier and Saint-Hilaire. The latter (Fig. 118) was\r\nin early life closely associated with Lamarck, and shared his views\r\nin reference to the origin of animals and plants; though in certain\r\npoints Saint-Hilaire was more a follower of Buffon than of Lamarck.\r\nStrangely enough, Saint-Hilaire was regarded as the stronger man of\r\nthe two. He was more in the public eye, but was not a man of such deep\r\nintellectuality as Lamarck. His scientific reputation rests mainly upon\r\nhis _Philosophie Anatomique_. The controversy between him and Cuvier\r\nwas on the subject of unity of type; but it involved the question of\r\nthe fixity or mutability of species, and therefore it involved the\r\nfoundation of the question of organic evolution.\r\n\r\nFig. 118.--Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1772-1844.\r\n\r\nThis debate stirred all intellectual Europe. Cuvier won as being\r\nthe better debater and the better manager of his case. He pointed\r\ntriumphantly to the four branches of the animal kingdom which he\r\nhad established, maintaining that these four branches represented\r\nfour distinct types of organization; and, furthermore, that fixity\r\nof species and fixity of type were necessary for the existence of a\r\nscientific natural history. We can see now that his contention was\r\nwrong, but at the time he won the debate. The young men of the period,\r\nthat is, the rising biologists of France, were nearly all adherents of\r\nCuvier, so that the effect of the debate was, as previously stated,\r\nto retard the progress of science. This noteworthy debate occurred in\r\nFebruary, 1830. The wide and lively interest with which the debate was\r\nfollowed may be inferred from the excitement manifested by Goethe. Of\r\nthe great poet-naturalist, who was then in his eighty-first year, the\r\nfollowing incident is told by Soret:\r\n\r\n\"Monday, Aug. 2d, 1830.--The news of the outbreak of the revolution of\r\nJuly arrived in Weimar to-day, and has caused general excitement. In\r\nthe course of the afternoon I went to Goethe. 'Well,' he exclaimed as I\r\nentered, 'what do you think of this great event? The volcano has burst\r\nforth, all is in flames, and there are no more negotiations behind\r\nclosed doors.' 'A dreadful affair,' I answered; 'but what else could\r\nbe expected under the circumstances, and with such a ministry, except\r\nthat it would end in the expulsion of the present royal family?' 'We do\r\nnot seem to understand each other, my dear friend,' replied Goethe. 'I\r\nam not speaking of those people at all; I am interested in something\r\nvery different. I mean the dispute between Cuvier and Geoffroy de\r\nSaint-Hilaire, which has broken out in the Academy, and which is of\r\nsuch great importance to science.' This remark of Goethe came upon me\r\nso unexpectedly that I did not know what to say, and my thoughts for\r\nsome minutes seemed to have come to a complete standstill. 'The affair\r\nis of the utmost importance,' he continued, 'and you can not form any\r\nidea of what I felt on receiving the news of the meeting on the 19th.\r\nIn Geoffroy de Saint-Hilaire we have now a mighty ally for a long time\r\nto come. But I see also how great the sympathy of the French scientific\r\nworld must be in this affair, for, in spite of the terrible political\r\nexcitement, the meeting on the 19th was attended by a full house.\r\nThe best of it is, however, that the synthetic treatment of nature,\r\nintroduced into France by Geoffroy, can now no longer be stopped. This\r\nmatter has now become public through the discussions in the Academy,\r\ncarried on in the presence of a large audience; it can no longer be\r\nreferred to secret committees, or be settled or suppressed behind\r\nclosed doors.'\"\r\n\r\nInfluence of Lyell's Principles of Geology.--But just as Cuvier was\r\ntriumphing over Saint-Hilaire a work was being published in England\r\nwhich was destined to overthrow the position of Cuvier and to bring\r\nagain a sufficient foundation for the basis of mutability of species.\r\nI refer to Lyell's _Principles of Geology_, the influence of which has\r\nalready been spoken of in Chapter XV. Lyell laid down the principle\r\nthat we are to interpret occurrences in the past in the terms of what\r\nis occurring in the present. He demonstrated that observations upon the\r\npresent show that the surface of the earth is undergoing gradually slow\r\nchanges through the action of various agents, and he pointed out that\r\nwe must view the occurrences in the past in the light of occurrences in\r\nthe present. Once this was applied to animal forms it became evident\r\nthat the observations upon animals and plants in the present must be\r\napplied to the life of the fossil series.\r\n\r\nThese ideas, then, paved the way for the conception of changes in\r\nnature as being one continuous series.\r\n\r\nH. Spencer.--In 1852 came the publication of Herbert Spencer in the\r\n_Leader_, in which he came very near anticipating the doctrine of\r\nnatural selection. He advanced the developmental hypothesis, saying\r\nthat even if its supporters could \"merely show that the production\r\nof species by the process of modification is conceivable, they would\r\nbe in a better position than their opponents. But they can do much\r\nmore than this; they can show that the process of modification has\r\naffected and is affecting great changes in all organisms subject to\r\nmodifying influences.... They can show that any existing species,\r\nanimal or vegetable, when placed under conditions different from\r\nits previous ones, immediately begins to undergo certain changes of\r\nstructure fitting it for the new conditions. They can show that in\r\nsuccessive generations these changes continue, until ultimately the new\r\nconditions become the natural ones. They can show that in cultivated\r\nplants and domesticated animals, and in the several races of men, these\r\nchanges have uniformly taken place. They can show that the degrees of\r\ndifference so produced are often, as in dogs, greater than those on\r\nwhich distinctions of species are in other cases founded. They can\r\nshow that it is a matter of dispute whether some of these modified\r\nforms _are_ varieties or modified species. And thus they can show that\r\nthroughout all organic nature there is at work a modifying influence\r\nof the kind they assign as the cause of these specific differences;\r\nan influence which, though slow in its action, does in time, if the\r\ncircumstances demand it, produce marked changes; an influence which,\r\nto all appearance, would produce in the millions of years, and under\r\nthe great varieties of conditions which geological records imply, any\r\namount of change.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible,\" says Marshall, \"to depict better than this the\r\ncondition prior to Darwin. In this essay there is full recognition of\r\nthe fact of transition, and of its being due to natural influences or\r\ncauses, acting now and at all times. Yet it remained comparatively\r\nunnoticed, because Spencer, like his contemporaries and predecessors,\r\nwhile advocating evolution, was unable to state explicitly what these\r\ncauses were.\"\r\n\r\nDarwin and Wallace.--In 1858 we come to the crowning event in the\r\nrise of evolutionary thought, when Alfred Russel Wallace sent a\r\ncommunication to Mr. Darwin, begging him to look it over and give him\r\nhis opinion of it. Darwin, who had been working upon his theory for\r\nmore than twenty years, patiently gathering facts and testing the same\r\nby experiment, was greatly surprised to find that Mr. Wallace had\r\nindependently hit upon the same principle of explaining the formation\r\nof species. In his generosity, he was at first disposed to withdraw\r\nfrom the field and publish the essay of Wallace without saying anything\r\nabout his own work. He decided, however, to abide by the decision of\r\ntwo of his friends, to whom he had submitted the matter, and the result\r\nwas that the paper of Wallace, accompanied by earlier communications of\r\nDarwin, were laid before the Linnæan Society of London. This was such\r\nan important event in the history of science that its consideration is\r\nextended by quoting the following letter:\r\n\r\n \"London, June 30th, 1858.\r\n\r\n \"My Dear Sir: The accompanying papers, which we have the honor of\r\n communicating to the Linnæan Society, and which all relate to the same\r\n subject; _viz_., the laws which affect the production of varieties,\r\n races, and species, contain the results of the investigations of two\r\n indefatigable naturalists, Mr. Charles Darwin and Mr. Alfred Wallace.\r\n\r\n \"These gentlemen having, independently and unknown to one another,\r\n conceived the same very ingenious theory to account for the appearance\r\n and perpetuation of varieties and of specific forms on our planet,\r\n may both fairly claim the merit of being original thinkers in this\r\n important line of inquiry; but neither of them having published his\r\n views, though Mr. Darwin has for many years past been repeatedly\r\n urged by us to do so, and both authors having now unreservedly\r\n placed their papers in our hands, we think it would best promote the\r\n interests of science that a selection from them should be laid before\r\n the Linnæan Society.\r\n\r\n \"Taken in the order of their dates, they consist of:\r\n\r\n \"1. Extracts from a MS. work on species, by Mr. Darwin, which was\r\n sketched in 1839 and copied in 1844, when the copy was read by Dr.\r\n Hooker, and its contents afterward communicated to Sir Charles Lyell.\r\n The first part is devoted to _The Variation of Organic Beings under\r\n Domestication and in their Natural State_; and the second chapter of\r\n that part, from which we propose to read to the Society the extracts\r\n referred to, is headed _On the Variation of Organic Beings in a State\r\n of Nature; on the Natural Means of Selection; on the Comparison of\r\n Domestic Races and True Species_.\r\n\r\n \"2. An abstract of a private letter addressed to Professor Asa Gray,\r\n of Boston, U.S., in October, 1857, by Mr. Darwin, in which he repeats\r\n his views, and which shows that these remained unaltered from 1839 to\r\n 1857.\r\n\r\n \"3. An essay by Mr. Wallace, entitled _On the Tendency of Varieties\r\n to Depart Indefinitely from the Original Type_. This was written\r\n at Ternate in February, 1858, for the perusal of his friend and\r\n correspondent, Mr. Darwin, and sent to him with the expressed wish\r\n that it should be forwarded to Sir Charles Lyell, if Mr. Darwin\r\n thought it sufficiently novel and interesting. So highly did Mr.\r\n Darwin appreciate the value of the views therein set forth that he\r\n proposed, in a letter to Sir Charles Lyell, to obtain Mr. Wallace's\r\n consent to allow the essay to be published as soon as possible. Of\r\n this step we highly approved, provided Mr. Darwin did not withhold\r\n from the public, as he was strongly inclined to do (in favor of Mr.\r\n Wallace), the memoir which he had himself written on the same subject,\r\n and which, as before stated, one of us had perused in 1844, and the\r\n contents of which we had both of us been privy to for many years.\r\n\r\n \"On representing this to Mr. Darwin, he gave us permission to make\r\n what use we thought proper of his memoir, etc.; and in adopting our\r\n present course, of presenting it to the Linnæan Society, we have\r\n explained to him that we are not solely considering the relative\r\n claims to priority of himself and his friend, but the interests of\r\n science generally; for we feel it to be desirable that views founded\r\n on a wide deduction from facts, and matured by years of reflecting,\r\n should constitute at once a goal from which others may start; and\r\n that, while the scientific world is waiting for the appearance of Mr.\r\n Darwin's complete work, some of the leading results of his labours,\r\n as well as those of his able correspondent, should together be laid\r\n before the public.\r\n\r\n \"We have the honour to be yours very obediently,\r\n\r\n Charles Lyell,\r\n\r\n Jos. D. Hooker.\"\r\n\r\nPersonality of Darwin.--The personality of Darwin is extremely\r\ninteresting. Of his numerous portraits, the one shown in Fig. 119 is\r\nless commonly known than those showing him with a beard and a much\r\nfurrowed forehead. This portrait represents him in middle life, about\r\nthe time of the publication of his _Origin of Species_. It shows a\r\nrather typical British face, of marked individuality. Steadiness,\r\nsincerity, and urbanity are all depicted here. His bluish-gray\r\neyes were overshadowed by a projecting ridge and very prominent,\r\nbushy eyebrows that make his portrait, once seen, easily recognized\r\nthereafter. In the full-length portraits representing him seated, every\r\nline in his body shows the quiet, philosophical temper for which he\r\nwas notable. An intimate account of his life is contained in the _Life\r\nand Letters of Charles Darwin_ (1887) and in _More Letters of Darwin_\r\n(1903), both of which are illustrated by portraits and other pictures.\r\nThe books about Darwin and his work are numerous, but the reader\r\nis referred in particular to the two mentioned as giving the best\r\nconception of the great naturalist and of his personal characteristics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 119.--Charles Darwin, 1809-1882.]\r\n\r\nHe is described as being about six feet high, but with a stoop of the\r\nshoulders which diminished his apparent height; \"of active habits,\r\nbut with no natural grace or neatness of movement.\" \"In manner he was\r\nbright, animated, and cheerful; a delightfully considerate host, a man\r\nof never-failing courtesy, leading him to reply at length to letters\r\nfrom anybody, and sometimes of a most foolish kind.\"\r\n\r\nHis Home Life.--\"Darwin was a man greatly loved and respected by\r\nall who knew him. There was a peculiar charm about his manner, a\r\nconstant deference to others, and a faculty for seeing the best side of\r\neverything and everybody.\"\r\n\r\nHe was most affectionate and considerate at home. The picture of\r\nDarwin's life with his children gives a glimpse of the tenderness and\r\ndeep affection of his nature, and the reverent regard with which he\r\nwas held in the family circle is very touching. One of his daughters\r\nwrites: \"My first remembrances of my father are of the delights of his\r\nplaying with us. He was passionately attached to his own children,\r\nalthough he was not an indiscriminate child-lover. To all of us he\r\nwas the most delightful playfellow, and the most perfect sympathizer.\r\nIndeed, it is impossible adequately to describe how delightful a\r\nrelation his was to his family, whether as children or in their later\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\"It is a proof of the terms on which we were, and also of how much he\r\nwas valued as a playfellow, that one of his sons, when about four years\r\nold, tried to bribe him with a sixpence to come and play in working\r\nhours. We all knew the sacredness of working time, but that any one\r\nshould resist sixpence seemed an impossibility.\"\r\n\r\nMethod of Work.--Darwin's life, as might be inferred from the enduring\r\nquality of his researches, shows an unswerving purpose. His theory was\r\nnot the result of a sudden flash of insight, nor was it struck out\r\nin the heat of inspiration, but was the product of almost unexampled\r\nindustry and conscientious endeavor in the face of unfavorable\r\ncircumstances. Although strikingly original and independent as a\r\nthinker, he was slow to arrive at conclusions, examining with the\r\nmost minute and scrupulous care the ground for every conclusion. \"One\r\nquality of mind that seemed to be of especial advantage in leading him\r\nto make discoveries was the habit of never letting exceptions pass\r\nunnoticed.\" He enjoyed experimenting much more than work which only\r\nentailed reasoning. Of course, he was a great reader, but for books as\r\nbooks he had no respect, often cutting large ones in two in order to\r\nmake them easier to hold while in use.\r\n\r\nDarwin's Early Life.--Charles Darwin was born in 1809 at Shrewsbury,\r\nEngland, of distinguished ancestry, his grandfather being the famous\r\nDr. Erasmus Darwin, the founder, as we have seen, of a theory of\r\nevolution. In his youth he gave no indication of future greatness.\r\nHe was sent to Edinburgh to study medicine, but left there after two\r\nsessions, at the suggestion of his father, to study for the Church.\r\nHe then went to the University of Cambridge, where he remained three\r\nyears, listening to \"incredibly dull lectures.\" After taking his\r\nbaccalaureate degree, came the event which proved, as Darwin says, \"the\r\nturning-point of my life.\" This was his appointment as naturalist on\r\nthe surveying expedition about to be entered upon by the ship _Beagle_.\r\nIn Cambridge he had manifested an interest in scientific study, and had\r\nbeen encouraged by Professor Henslow, to whom he was also indebted for\r\nthe recommendation to the post on the _Beagle_. An amusing circumstance\r\nconnected with his appointment is that he was nearly rejected by\r\nCaptain Fitz-Roy, who doubted \"whether a man with such a shaped nose\r\ncould possess sufficient energy and determination for the voyage.\"\r\n\r\nVoyage of the Beagle.--The voyage of the _Beagle_ extended over five\r\nyears (1831-1836), mainly along the west coast of South America. It was\r\non this voyage that Darwin acquired the habit of constant industry.\r\nHe had also opportunity to take long trips on shore, engaged in\r\nobservation and in making extensive collections. He observed nature\r\nin the field under exceptional circumstances. As he traveled he noted\r\nfossil forms in rocks as well as the living forms in field and forest.\r\nHe observed the correspondence in type between certain extinct forms\r\nand recent animals in South America. He noticed in the Galapagos\r\nIslands a fauna similar in general characteristics to that of the\r\nmainland, five or six hundred miles distant, and yet totally different\r\nas to species. Moreover, certain species were found to be confined to\r\nparticular islands. These observations awakened in his mind, a mind\r\nnaturally given to inquiring into the causes of things, questions that\r\nled to the formulation of his theory. It was not, however, until 1837\r\nthat he commenced his first note-book for containing his observations\r\nupon the transmutations of animals. He started as a firm believer\r\nin the fixity of species, and spent several years collecting and\r\nconsidering data before he changed his views.\r\n\r\nAt Downs.--On his return to England, after spending some time in\r\nLondon, he purchased a country-place at Downs, and, as his inheritance\r\nmade it possible, he devoted himself entirely to his researches.\r\n\r\nBut, as is well known, he found in his illness a great obstacle to\r\nsteady work. He had been a vigorous youth and young man, fond of\r\noutdoor sports, as fishing, shooting, and the like. After returning\r\nfrom his long voyage, he was affected by a form of constant illness,\r\ninvolving a giddiness in the head, and \"for nearly forty years he never\r\nknew one day of the health of an ordinary man, and thus his life was\r\none long struggle against the weariness and strain of sickness.\" Gould\r\nin his _Biographical Clinics_ attributes his illness to eye-strain.\r\n\r\n\"Under such conditions absolute regularity of routine was essential,\r\nand the day's work was carefully planned out. At his best, he had three\r\nperiods of work: from 8.00 to 9.30; from 10.30 to 12.15; and from 4.30\r\nto 6.00, each period being under two hours' duration.\"\r\n\r\nThe patient thoroughness of his experimental work and of his\r\nobservation is shown by the fact that he did not publish his book on\r\nthe _Origin of Species_ until he had worked on his theory twenty-two\r\nyears. The circumstances that led to his publishing it when he did have\r\nalready been indicated.\r\n\r\nParallelism in the Thought of Darwin and Wallace.--No one can read the\r\nletters of Darwin and Wallace explaining how they arrived at their idea\r\nof natural selection without marveling at the remarkable parallelism\r\nin the thought of the two. It is a noteworthy circumstance that the\r\nidea of natural selection came to both by the reading of the same book,\r\n_Malthus on Population_.\r\n\r\nDarwin's statement of how he arrived at the conception of natural\r\nselection is as follows: \"In October, 1838, that is, fifteen months\r\nafter I had begun my systematic inquiry, I happened to read for\r\namusement _Malthus on Population_, and being well prepared to\r\nappreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from\r\nlong-continued observations of the habits of animals and plants, it at\r\nonce struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations\r\nwould tend to be preserved and unfavourable ones to be destroyed.\r\n_The result of this would be the formation of new species._ Here then\r\nI had at last got a theory by which to work, but I was so anxious to\r\navoid prejudice that I determined not for some time to write even\r\nthe briefest sketch of it. In June, 1842, I first allowed myself the\r\nsatisfaction of writing a very brief abstract of my theory in pencil,\r\nin thirty-five pages, and this was enlarged during the summer of 1844\r\ninto one of 230 pages.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 120.--Alfred Russel Wallace, Born 1823.]\r\n\r\nAnd Wallace gives this account: \"In February, 1858, I was suffering\r\nfrom a rather severe attack of intermittent fever at Ternate, in the\r\nMoluccas; and one day, while lying on my bed during the cold fit,\r\nwrapped in blankets, though the thermometer was at 88° Fahr., the\r\nproblem again presented itself to me, and something led me to think\r\nof the 'positive checks' described by Malthus in his _Essay on\r\nPopulation_, a work I had read several years before, and which had\r\nmade a deep and permanent impression on my mind. These checks--war,\r\ndisease, famine, and the like--must, it occurred to me, act on animals\r\nas well as man. Then I thought of the enormously rapid multiplication\r\nof animals, causing these checks to be much more effective in them\r\nthan in the case of man; and while pondering vaguely on this fact,\r\nthere suddenly flashed upon me the _idea_ of the survival of the\r\nfittest--that the individuals removed by these checks must be on the\r\nwhole inferior to those that survived. In the two hours that elapsed\r\nbefore my ague fit was over, I had thought out almost the whole of the\r\ntheory; and the same evening I sketched the draught of my paper, and in\r\nthe two succeeding evenings wrote it out in full, and sent it by the\r\nnext post to Mr. Darwin.\"\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that the announcement of the Darwin-Wallace theory\r\nof natural selection was made in 1858, and in the following year was\r\npublished the book, the famous _Origin of Species_, upon which Darwin\r\nhad been working when he received Mr. Wallace's essay. Darwin spoke of\r\nthis work as an outline, a sort of introduction to other works that\r\nwere in the course of preparation. His subsequent works upon _Animals\r\nand Plants under Domestication_, _The Descent of Man_, etc., etc.,\r\nexpanded his theory, but none of them effected so much stir in the\r\nintellectual world as the _Origin of Species_.\r\n\r\nThis skeleton outline should be filled out by reading _Darwin's\r\nLife and Letters_, by his son, and the complete papers of Darwin\r\nand Wallace, as originally published in the _Journal of the Linnæan\r\nSociety_. The original papers are reproduced in the _Popular Science\r\nMonthly_ for November, 1901.\r\n\r\nWallace was born in 1823, and is still living. He shares with Darwin\r\nthe credit of propounding the theory of natural selection, and he is\r\nnotable also for the publication of important books, as the _Malay\r\nArchipelago_, _The Geographical Distribution of Animals_, _The\r\nWonderful Century_, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Spread of the Doctrine of Organic Evolution. Huxley.--Darwin was\r\nof a quiet habit, not aggressive in the defense of his views. His\r\ntheory provoked so much opposition that it needed some defenders of\r\nthe pugnacious type. In England such a man was found in Thomas Henry\r\nHuxley (1825-1895). He was one of the greatest popular exponents of\r\nscience of the nineteenth century; a man of most thorough and exact\r\nscholarship, with a keen, analytical mind that went directly to the\r\ncenter of questions under consideration, and powers as a writer that\r\ngave him a wide circle of readers. He was magnificently sincere in his\r\nfight for the prevalence of intellectual honesty. Doubtless he will be\r\nlonger remembered for this service than for anything else.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 121.--Thomas Henry Huxley, 1825-1895.]\r\n\r\nHe defended the doctrine of evolution, not only against oratorical\r\nattacks like that of Bishop Wilberforce, but against well-considered\r\narguments and more worthy opponents. He advanced the standing of the\r\ntheory in a less direct way by urging the pursuit of scientific studies\r\nby high-school and university students, and by bringing science closer\r\nto the people. He was a pioneer in the laboratory teaching of biology,\r\nand his _Manual_ has been, ever since its publication in 1874, the\r\ninspiration and the model for writers of directions for practical work\r\nin that field.\r\n\r\nIt is not so generally known that he was also a great investigator,\r\nproducing a large amount of purely technical researches. After his\r\ndeath a memorial edition of his scientific memoirs was published in\r\nfour large quarto volumes. The extent of his scientific output when\r\nthus assembled was a surprise to many of his co-workers in the field\r\nof science. His other writings of a more general character have\r\nbeen collected in fourteen quarto volumes. Some of the essays in\r\nthis collection are models of clear and vigorous English style. Mr.\r\nHuxley did an astonishing amount of scientific work, especially in\r\nmorphology and palæontology. Those who have been privileged to look\r\nover his manuscripts and unpublished drawings in his old room at South\r\nKensington could not fail to have been impressed, not only with the\r\nextent, but also with the accuracy of his work. Taking Johannes Müller\r\nas his exemplar, he investigated animal organisms with a completeness\r\nand an exactness that have rarely been equaled.\r\n\r\nAn intimate account of his life will be found in _The Life and Letters\r\nof Thomas Henry Huxley_, by his son.\r\n\r\nHaeckel.--Ernst Haeckel, of Jena, born in 1834 (Fig. 122), was one of\r\nthe earliest in Germany to take up the defense of Darwin's hypothesis.\r\nAs early as 1866 he applied the doctrine of evolution to all organisms\r\nin his _Generelle Morphologie_. This work, which has been long out\r\nof print, represents his best contribution to evolutionary thought.\r\nHe has written widely for general readers, and although his writings\r\nare popularly believed to represent the best scientific thought on\r\nthe matter, those written for the general public are not regarded by\r\nmost biologists as strictly representative. As a thinker he is more\r\ncareless than Huxley, and as a result less critical and exact as a\r\nwriter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 122.--Ernst Haeckel, Born 1834.]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the germs of evolutionary thought existed\r\nin Greek philosophy, and that they were retained in a state of low\r\nvitality among the mediæval thinkers who reflected upon the problem of\r\ncreation. It was not, however, until the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury that, under the nurture of Lamarck, they grew into what we may\r\nspeak of as the modern theory of evolution. After various vicissitudes\r\nthis doctrine was made fertile by Darwin, who supplied it with a new\r\nprinciple, that of natural selection.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of this long growth are now being gathered. After Darwin\r\nthe problem of biology became not merely to describe phenomena, but to\r\nexplain them. This is the outcome of the rise and progress of biology:\r\nfirst, crude and uncritical observations of the forms of animated\r\nnature; then descriptive analysis of their structure and development;\r\nand, finally, experimental studies, the effort to explain vital\r\nphenomena, an effort in which biologists are at present engaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nRETROSPECT AND PROSPECT. RECENT TENDENCIES IN BIOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen one views the progress of biology in retrospect, the broad\r\ntruth stands out that there has been a continuity of development in\r\nbiological thought and interpretation. The new proceeds out of the\r\nold, but is genetically related to it. A good illustration of this\r\nis seen in the modified sense in which the theories of epigenesis\r\nand pre-formation have been retained in the biological philosophy of\r\nthe nineteenth century. The same kind of question that divided the\r\nphilosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries has remained\r\nto vex those of the nineteenth; and, although both processes have\r\nassumed a different aspect in the light of germinal continuity, the\r\ntheorists of the last part of the nineteenth century were divided in\r\ntheir outlook upon biological processes into those of the epigenetic\r\nschool and those who are persuaded of a pre-organization in the\r\ngerminal elements of organisms. Leading biological questions were\r\nwarmly discussed from these different points of view.\r\n\r\nIn its general character the progress of natural science has been,\r\nand still is, a crusade against superstition; and it may be remarked\r\nin passing that \"the nature of superstition consists in a gross\r\nmisunderstanding of the causes of natural phenomena.\" The struggle\r\nhas been more marked in biology than in other departments of science\r\nbecause biology involves the consideration of living organisms and\r\nundertakes to establish the same basis for thinking about the\r\norganization of the human body as about the rest of the animal series.\r\n\r\nThe first triumph of the scientific method was the overthrow of\r\nauthority as a means of ascertaining truth and substituting therefor\r\nthe method of observation and experiment. This carries us back to\r\nthe days of Vesalius and Harvey, before the framework of biology was\r\nreared. But the scientific method, once established, led on gradually\r\nto a belief in the constancy of nature and in the prevalence of\r\nuniversal laws in the production of all phenomena. In its progress\r\nbiology has exhibited three phases which more or less overlap: The\r\nfirst was the descriptive phase, in which the obvious features\r\nof animals and plants were merely described; the descriptive was\r\nsupplemented by the comparative method; this in due course by the\r\nexperimental method, or the study of the processes that take place in\r\norganisms. Thus, description, comparison, and experiment represent the\r\ngreat phases of biological development.\r\n\r\nThe Notable Books of Biology and their Authors.--The progress of\r\nbiology has been owing to the efforts of men of very human qualities,\r\nyet each with some special distinguishing feature of eminence. Certain\r\nof their publications are the mile-stones of the way. It may be worth\r\nwhile, therefore, in a brief recapitulation to name the books of widest\r\ngeneral influence in the progress of biology. Only those publications\r\nwill be mentioned that have formed the starting-point of some new\r\nmovement, or have laid the foundation of some new theory.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the revival of learning, the books of Vesalius, _De\r\nCorporis Humani Fabrica_ (1543), and Harvey, _De Motu Cordis et\r\nSanguinis_ (1628), laid the foundations of scientific method in biology.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer researches of Malpighi on the minute anatomy of plants\r\nand animals, and on the development of the chick, best represent\r\nthe progress of investigation between Harvey and Linnæus. The three\r\ncontributions referred to are those on the _Anatomy of Plants_\r\n(_Anatome Plantarum_, 1675-1679); on the _Anatomy of the Silkworm_ (_De\r\nBombyce_, 1669); and on the _Development of the Chick_ (_De Formatione\r\nPulli in Ovo_ and _De Ovo Incubato_, both 1672).\r\n\r\nWe then pass to the _Systema Naturæ_ (twelve editions, 1735-1768) of\r\nLinnæus, a work that had such wide influence in stimulating activity in\r\nsystematic botany and zoölogy.\r\n\r\nWolff's _Theoria Generationis_, 1759, and his _De Formatione\r\nIntestinorum_, 1764, especially the latter, were pieces of observation\r\nmarking the highest level of investigation of development prior to that\r\nof Pander and Von Baer.\r\n\r\nCuvier, in _Le Règne Animal_, 1816, applied the principles of\r\ncomparative anatomy to the entire animal kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe publication in 1800 of Bichat's _Traité des Membranes_ created a\r\nnew department of anatomy, called histology.\r\n\r\nLamarck's book, _La Philosophie Zoologique_, 1809, must have a place\r\namong the great works in biology. Its influence was delayed for more\r\nthan fifty years after its publication.\r\n\r\nThe monumental work of Von Baer on _Development_ (_Ueber\r\nEntwicklungsgeschichte der Thiere_), 1828, is an almost ideal\r\ncombination of observation and conclusion in embryology.\r\n\r\nThe _Microscopische Untersuchungen_, 1839, of Schwann marks the\r\nfoundation of the cell-theory.\r\n\r\nThe _Handbook_ of Johannes Müller (_Handbuch der Physiologie des\r\nMenschen_), 1846, remains unsurpassed as to its plan and its execution.\r\n\r\nMax Schultze in his treatise _Ueber Muskelkörperchen und das was man\r\neine Zelle zu nennen habe_, 1861, established one of the most important\r\nconceptions with which biology has been enriched, viz., the protoplasm\r\ndoctrine.\r\n\r\nDarwin's _Origin of Species_, 1859, is, from our present outlook, the\r\ngreatest classic in biology.\r\n\r\nPasteur's _Studies on Fermentation_, 1876, is typical of the quality\r\nof his work, though his later investigations on inoculations for the\r\nprevention of hydrophobia and other maladies are of greater importance\r\nto mankind.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat puzzling to select a man to represent the study of\r\nfossil life, one is tempted to name E.D. Cope, whose researches were\r\nconceived on the highest plane. Zittel, however, covered the entire\r\nfield of fossil life, and his _Handbook of Palæontology_ is designated\r\nas a mile-post in the development of that science.\r\n\r\nBefore the Renaissance the works of Aristotle and Galen should be\r\nincluded.\r\n\r\nFrom the view-point suggested, the more notable figures in the\r\ndevelopment of biology are: Aristotle, Galen, Vesalius, Harvey,\r\nMalpighi, Linnæus, Wolff, Cuvier, Bichat, Lamarck, Von Baer, J. Müller,\r\nSchwann, Schultze, Darwin, Pasteur, and Cope.\r\n\r\nSuch a list is, as a matter of course, arbitrary, and can serve no\r\nuseful purpose except that of bringing into combination in a single\r\ngroup the names of the most illustrious founders of biological science.\r\nThe individuals mentioned are not all of the same relative rank,\r\nand the list should be extended rather than contracted. Schwann,\r\nwhen the entire output of the two is considered, would rank lower\r\nas a scientific man than Koelliker, who is not mentioned, but the\r\nformer must stand in the list on account of his connection with the\r\ncell-theory. Virchow, the presumptive founder of pathology, is omitted,\r\nas are also investigators like Koch, whose line of activity has been\r\nchiefly medical.\r\n\r\nRecent Tendencies in Biology. Higher Standards.--In attempting to\r\nindicate some of the more evident influences that dominate biological\r\ninvestigation at the present time, nothing more than an enumeration\r\nof tendencies with a running commentary is possible. One notes first a\r\nwholesome influence in the establishment of higher standards, both of\r\nresearch and of scientific publication. Investigations as a whole have\r\nbecome more intensive and more critical. Much of the work that would\r\nhave passed muster for publication two decades ago is now regarded by\r\nthe editors of the best biological periodicals as too general and too\r\nsuperficial. The requisites for the recognition of creditable work\r\nbeing higher, tends to elevate the whole level of biological science.\r\n\r\nImprovement in Tools and Methods.--This has come about partly through\r\nimprovement in the tools and in the methods of the investigators. It\r\ncan hardly be said, however, that thinking and discernment have been\r\nadvanced at the same rate as the mechanical helps to research. In\r\nbecoming more intensive, the investigation of biological problems has\r\nlost something in comprehensiveness. That which some of the earlier\r\ninvestigators lacked in technique was compensated for in the breadth of\r\ntheir preliminary training and in their splendid appreciation of the\r\nrelations of the facts at their disposal.\r\n\r\nThe great improvement in the mechanical adjustments and in the optical\r\npowers of microscopes has made it possible to see more regarding the\r\nphysical structure and the activities of organisms than ever before.\r\nMicrotomes of the best workmanship have placed in the hands of\r\nhistologists the means of making serial sections of remarkable thinness\r\nand regularity.\r\n\r\nThe great development of micro-chemical technique also has had the\r\nwidest influence in promoting exact researches in biology. Special\r\nstaining methods, as those of Golgi and Bethe, by means of which\r\nthe wonderful fabric of the nervous system has been revealed, are\r\nillustrations.\r\n\r\nThe separation by maceration and smear preparation of entire\r\nhistological elements so that they may be viewed as solids has come\r\nto supplement the study of sections. Reconstruction, by carving wax\r\nplates of known thickness into the form of magnified sections drawn\r\nupon their surfaces to a scale, and then fitting the plates together,\r\nhas been very helpful in picturing complicated anatomical relations.\r\nThis method has made it possible to produce permanent wax models of\r\nminute structures magnified to any desired degree. Minute dissections,\r\nalthough not yet sufficiently practiced, are nevertheless better than\r\nthe wax models for making accurate drawings of minute structures as\r\nseen in relief.\r\n\r\nThe injection of the blood-vessels of extremely small embryos has\r\nmade it possible to study advantageously the circulatory system. The\r\nsoftening of bones by acid after the tissues are already embedded in\r\ncelloidin has offered a means of investigating the structure of the\r\ninternal ear by sections, and is widely applicable to other tissues.\r\n\r\nWith the advantage of the new appliances and the new methods, the\r\nold problems of anatomy are being worked over on a higher level of\r\nrequirement. Still, it is doubtful whether even the old problems will\r\nbe solved in more than a relative way. It is characteristic of the\r\nprogress of research that as one proceeds the horizon broadens and\r\nnew questions spring up in the pathway of the investigator. He does\r\nnot solve the problems he sets out to solve, but opens a lot of new\r\nones. This is one of the features of scientific research that make its\r\nvotaries characteristically optimistic.\r\n\r\nExperimental Work.--Among the recent influences tending to advance\r\nbiology, none is more important than the application of experiments to\r\nbiological studies. The experimental method is in reality applicable\r\nto diverse fields of biological research, and its extensive use at\r\npresent indicates a movement in the right direction; that is, a growing\r\ninterest in the study of processes. One of the earliest problems of\r\nthe biologist is to investigate the architecture of living beings;\r\nthen there arise questions as to the processes that occur within\r\nthe organism, and the study of processes involves the employment of\r\nexperiments. In the pursuit of physiology experiments have been in\r\nuse since the time of Harvey, but even in that science, where they\r\nare indispensable, experiments did not become comparative until the\r\nnineteenth century. It now appears that various forms of experiment\r\ngive also a better insight into the structure of organisms, and the\r\npractice of applying experiments to structural studies has given rise\r\nto the new department of experimental morphology.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of indicating some of the directions in which biology\r\nhas been furthered by the experimental method of investigation,\r\nwe designate the fields of heredity and evolution, changes in the\r\nenvironment of organisms, studies on fertilization and on animal\r\nbehavior.\r\n\r\nThe recognition that both heredity and the process of evolution can\r\nbe subjected to experimental tests was a revelation. Darwin and\r\nthe early evolutionists thought the evolutionary changes too slow\r\nto be appreciated, but now we know that many of the changes can be\r\ninvestigated by experiment. Numerous experiments on heredity in\r\npoultry (Davenport), in rats, in rabbits, and in guinea-pigs (Castle)\r\nhave been carried out--experiments that test the laws of ancestral\r\ninheritance and throw great light upon the questions introduced by the\r\ninvestigations of Mendel and De Vries. The investigations of De Vries\r\non the evolution of plant-life occupy a notable position among the\r\nexperimental studies.\r\n\r\nA large number of experiments on the effects produced by changes in\r\nthe external conditions of life have been made. To this class of\r\ninvestigations belong studies on the regulation of form and function in\r\norganisms (Loeb, Child), the effects produced by altering mechanical\r\nconditions of growth, by changing the chemical environment, etc.\r\nThere is some internal mechanism in living matter that is influenced\r\nby changes in external conditions, and the study of the regulation\r\nof the internal processes that produce form and structure have\r\ngiven rise to a variety of interesting problems. The regeneration\r\nof lost parts and regeneration after intentionally-imposed injury\r\nhas received much attention (Morgan). Marine animals are especially\r\namenable to manipulations of this nature, as well as to alterations in\r\ntheir surroundings, on account of the ease in altering the chemical\r\nenvironment in which they live. The latter may be accomplished by\r\ndissolving harmless chemical salts in the sea-water, and observing the\r\nchanges produced by the alterations of the surrounding conditions. By\r\nthis means Herbst and others have produced very interesting results.\r\n\r\nIn the field of artificial fertilization, free swimming larvæ have\r\nbeen raised from eggs artificially fertilized by changes in osmotic\r\npressure, and also by treating them with both organic and inorganic\r\nacids; and these studies have greatly altered opinion regarding the\r\nnature of fertilization, and of certain other phenomena of development.\r\n\r\nAnimal Behavior.--The study of animal behavior (Jennings) is a very\r\ncharacteristic activity of the present, in which certain psychological\r\nprocesses are investigated. These investigations have given rise to\r\na distinct line of research participated in by psychologists and\r\nbiologists. The study of the way in which animals will react toward\r\nlight of different colors, to variations in the intensity of light,\r\nto alterations in temperature, and to various other forms of stimuli\r\nare yielding very important results, that enable investigators to look\r\nbeneath the surface and to make important deductions regarding the\r\nnature of psychological processes.\r\n\r\nA line closely allied to experimentation is the application of\r\nstatistics to biological processes, such as those of growth, stature,\r\nthe law of ancestral inheritance, the statistical study of variations\r\nin spines, markings on shells, etc., etc., (Galton, Pearson, Davenport).\r\n\r\nOther branches of biology that have been greatly developed by the\r\nexperimental method are those of bacteriology and physiological\r\nchemistry. The advances in the latter have greatly widened the horizon\r\nof our view regarding the nature of vital activities, and they compose\r\none of the leading features of current biological investigation.\r\n\r\nSome Tendencies in Anatomical Studies. Cell-Lineage.--While\r\nexperimental work occupies the center of the stage, at the same time\r\ngreat improvements in morphological studies are evident. It will be\r\nonly possible, however, to indicate in a general way the direction\r\nin which investigations are moving. We note, first, as in a previous\r\nparagraph, that the improvement in morphology is generic as well as\r\nspecific. Anatomical analysis is being carried to its limits in a\r\nnumber of directions. The investigations that are connected with the\r\nstudy of cells afford a conspicuous illustration of this fact. Studies\r\nin cell-lineage have led to an exact determination of cell-succession\r\nin the development of certain animals, and such studies are still in\r\nprogress. Great progress also has been made in the study of physical\r\nstructure of living matter. The tracing of cell-lineage is a feat\r\nof remarkably accurate and patient work. But, however much this may\r\ncommand our admiration, it has been surpassed (as related in Chapter\r\nXI) by investigations regarding the organization of the egg and the\r\nanalysis of chromosomes. Boveri, Conklin, Wilson, and others have shown\r\nthat there are recognizable areas within the protoplasm of the egg\r\nthat have a definite historical relationship to certain structures in\r\nprocess of development. This is the basis upon which rests the doctrine\r\nof pre-localization of tissue-forming substances within the protoplasm\r\nof the egg.\r\n\r\nAnatomy of the Nervous System.--In another direction the progress\r\nof anatomical studies is very evident, that is, investigations of\r\nthe nervous system and the sense-organs. The wonderfully complicated\r\nrelations of nerve elements have been worked out by Ramon y Cajal. The\r\nstudies of Hodge and others upon optical changes occurring within the\r\ncells of the nervous system owing to their functional activity have\r\nopened a great field for investigation. The studies of Strong, Herrick,\r\nand others upon the distribution of nerve-components in the nerves\r\nof the head and the investigations of Harrison on the growth and the\r\nregeneration of nerve-fibers give illustrations of current tendencies\r\nin biological investigation. The analysis of the central nervous system\r\ninto segmental divisions on the basis of functional activity (Johnston)\r\nis still another illustration.\r\n\r\nThe Application of Biological Facts to the Benefit of Mankind.--The\r\npractical application of biology to the benefit of mankind is a\r\nstriking feature of present-day tendencies. The activity set on foot by\r\nthe researches of Pasteur, Koch, and others has created a department of\r\ntechnical biology of the greatest importance to the human race.\r\n\r\nUnder the general heading should be included the demonstration of\r\nthe connection between insects and the propagation of yellow fever,\r\nmalaria, and other disorders; and as an illustration of activity in\r\n1907, we think of the commission recently appointed to investigate the\r\nterrible scourge of the sleeping-sickness which has been prevalent in\r\nAfrica. Here also we would group studies of a pathological character on\r\nblood-immunity, toxin and antitoxin, also studies on the inoculation\r\nfor the prevention of various diseases that affect animals and mankind.\r\nVery much benefit has already accrued from the practical application of\r\nbiological researches of this nature, which, in reality, are still in\r\ntheir infancy.\r\n\r\nWe find the application of biological facts to agriculture in the form\r\nof soil-inoculation, in the tracing of the sources of nitrates in the\r\nsoil, and studies of the insects injurious to vegetation; their further\r\napplication to practical forestry, and in sanitary sciences. This kind\r\nof research is also applied to the study of food-supply for fishes, as\r\nin the case of Plankton studies.\r\n\r\nThe Establishment and Maintenance of Biological Laboratories.--The\r\nestablishment of seaside biological observatories and various other\r\nstations for research have had a great influence on the development\r\nof biology. The most famous biological station is that founded at\r\nNaples (Fig. 123) in 1872 by Anton Dohrn, and it is a gratification\r\nto biologists to know that he still remains its director. This\r\ninternational station for research has stimulated, and is at present\r\nstimulating, the growth of biology by providing the best conditions for\r\ncarrying on researches and by the distribution of material which has\r\nbeen put up at the sea-coast by the most skilled preservators. There\r\nare many stations modeled after that at Naples. The Marine Biological\r\nLaboratory at Woods Holl, Mass., is of especial prominence, and the\r\nrecently reorganized Wistar Institute of Anatomy at Philadelphia is\r\nmaking a feature of the promotion of anatomical researches, especially\r\nthose connected with the anatomy of the nervous system.\r\n\r\nLaboratories similar to those at the seaside have been established\r\non several fresh-water lakes. The studies carried on in those places\r\nof the complete biology of lakes, taking into account the entire\r\nsurroundings of organisms, are very interesting and important.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 123.--The Biological Station at Naples.]\r\n\r\nUnder this general head should be mentioned stations under the control\r\nof the Carnegie Institution, the various scientific surveys under the\r\nGovernment, and the United States Fish Commission, which carries on\r\ninvestigations in the biology of fishes as well as observations that\r\naffect their use as articles of diet. The combined output of the\r\nvarious laboratories and stations of this nature is very considerable,\r\nand their influence upon the progress of biology is properly included\r\nunder the head of present tendencies.\r\n\r\nThe organization of laboratories in our great universities and their\r\nproduct exercise a wide influence on the progress of biology, that\r\nscience having within twenty-five years come to occupy a position of\r\ngreat importance among the subjects of general education.\r\n\r\nEstablishment and Maintenance of Technical Periodicals.--It is\r\nmanifestly very important to provide means for the publication of\r\nresults and, as needed, to have technical periodicals established\r\nand properly maintained. Their maintenance can not be effected on\r\na purely commercial basis, and the result is that some of our best\r\nperiodicals require financial assistance in order to exist at all. The\r\nsubsidizing and support of these periodicals aid materially in the\r\nbiological advance. A typical technical periodical is Schultze's famous\r\n_Archiv für Mikroscopische Anatomie_, founded in 1864 by Schultze and\r\ncontinued to the present time. Into its pages go the highest grade of\r\ninvestigations, and its continued existence has a salutary influence\r\nupon the progress of biology. The list of technical periodicals would\r\nbe too long to name, but among others the _Morphologisches Jahrbuch_\r\nof Gegenbaur, and Koelliker's _Zeitschrift für Wissenschaftliche\r\nZoologie_ have had wide influence. In England the _Quarterly Journal\r\nof Microscopical Science_ is devoted to morphological investigations,\r\nwhile physiology is provided for in other journals, as it is also in\r\nGermany and other countries. In the United States the _Journal of\r\nMorphology_, edited by C.O. Whitman, passed through seventeen volumes\r\nand was maintained on the highest plane of scholarship. The fine\r\nexecution of the plates and the high grade of typographical work made\r\nthis journal conspicuous. It represents in every way an enterprise\r\nof which Americans can be justly proud. The _American Journal of\r\nAnatomy_ is now filling the field left unoccupied by the cessation of\r\nthe _Journal of Morphology_.[9] In the department of experimental work\r\nmany journals have sprung up, as _Biometrica_, edited by Carl Pearson,\r\nRoux's _Archiv für Entwicklungsmechanik_, the _Journal of Experimental\r\nZoology_ recently established in the United States, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nExploration of the Fossil Records.--Explorations of the fossil records\r\nhave been recently carried out on a scale never before attempted,\r\ninvolving the expenditure of large sums, but bringing results of\r\ngreat importance. The American Museum of Natural History, in New York\r\nCity, has carried on an extensive survey, which has enriched it with\r\nwonderful collections of fossil animals. Besides explorations of the\r\nfossil-bearing rocks of the Western States and Territories, operations\r\nin another locality of great importance are conducted in the Fayûm\r\ndistrict of Egypt. The result of the studies of these fossil animals is\r\nto make us acquainted not only with the forms of ancient life, but with\r\nthe actual line of ancestry of many living animals. The advances in\r\nthis direction are most interesting and most important. This extensive\r\ninvestigation of the fossil records is one of the present tendencies in\r\nbiology.\r\n\r\nConclusion.--In brief, the chief tendencies in current biological\r\nresearches are mainly included under the following headings:\r\nExperimental studies in heredity, evolution, and animal behavior; more\r\nexact anatomical investigations, especially in cytology and neurology,\r\nthe promotion and dissemination of knowledge through biological\r\nperiodicals; the provision of better facilities in specially equipped\r\nlaboratories, in the application of results to the benefit of mankind,\r\nand in the investigation of the fossil records.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of thought engendered by the progress of biology is\r\nbeneficial in every way. While its progress has dealt the death-blow\r\nto many superstitions and changed materially views regarding the\r\nuniverse, it is gratifying to think that it has not been iconoclastic\r\nin its influence, but that it has substituted something better for that\r\nwhich was taken away. It has given a broader and more wholesome basis\r\nfor religion and theories of ethics; it has taught greater respect\r\nfor truth and morality. However beneficial this progress has been in\r\nthe past, who can doubt that the mission of biology to the twentieth\r\ncentury will be more important than to the past, and that there will be\r\nembraced in its progress greater benefits than any we have yet known?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: It is a source of gratification to biologists that--thanks\r\nto the Wistar Institute of Anatomy--the publication of the _Journal of\r\nMorphology_ is to be continued.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING LIST\r\n\r\nThe books and articles relating to the history of biology are numerous.\r\nThose designated below embrace some of the more readily accessible\r\nones.

Since the four succeeding chapters deal with the Evolution\r\nTheory, it maybe worth while to make a few general comments on the\r\nliterature pertaining to Organic Evolution. The number of books and\r\narticles is very extensive, and I have undertaken to sift from the\r\ngreat number a limited list of the more meritorious. Owing to the\r\nprevalent vagueness regarding evolution theories, one is likely to read\r\nonly about Darwin and Darwinism. This should be avoided by reading as a\r\nminimum some good reference on Lamarck, Weismann, and De Vries, as well\r\nas on Darwin. It is well enough to begin with Darwin's Theory, but it\r\nis not best to take his Origin of Species as the first book. To do this\r\nis to place oneself fifty years in the past. The evidences of Organic\r\nEvolution have greatly multiplied since 1859, and a better conception\r\nof Darwin's Theory can be obtained by reading first Romanes's Darwin\r\nand After Darwin, vol. I. This to be followed by Wallace's Darwinism,\r\nand, thereafter, the Origin of Species may be taken up. These will\r\ngive a good conception of Darwin's Theory, and they should be followed\r\nby reading in the order named: Packard's Lamarck; Weismann's The\r\nEvolution Theory; and De Vries's The Origin of Species and Varieties by\r\nMutation. Simultaneously one may read with great profit Osborn's From\r\nthe Greeks to Darwin.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nGeneral: Romanes, Darwin and After Darwin, 1892, vol. I, chaps.

Kellogg, of Leland Stanford University Author of\r\n\"American Insects,\" etc. 395 pp. and index. 8vo. $2.00 net; by mail,\r\n$2.15.\r\n\r\nA simple and concise discussion for the educated layman of present-day\r\nscientific criticism of the Darwinian selection theories, together with\r\nconcise accounts of the other more important proposed auxiliary and\r\nalternative theories of species-forming. With special notes and exact\r\nreferences to original sources and to the author's own observations and\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\n \"Its value cannot be overestimated. A book the student must have at\r\n hand at all times, and it takes the place of a whole library. No other\r\n writer has attempted to gather together the scattered literature\r\n of this vast subject, and none has subjected this literature to\r\n such uniformly trenchant and uniformly kindly criticism. Pledged to\r\n no theory of his own, and an investigator of the first rank, and\r\n master of a clear and forceful literary style, Professor Kellogg is\r\n especially well fitted to do justice to the many phases of present-day\r\n Darwinism.\"--David Starr Jordan in _The Dial_.\r\n\r\n \"May be unhesitatingly recommended to the student of biology as\r\n well as to the non-professional or even non-biological reader of\r\n intelligence ... gives a full, concise, fair and very readable\r\n exposition of the present status of evolution.\"--_The Independent._\r\n\r\n \"Can write in English as brightly and as clearly as the old-time\r\n Frenchmen ... a book that the ordinary reader can read with thorough\r\n enjoyment and understanding and that the specialist can turn to with\r\n profit as well ... in his text he explains the controversy so that\r\n the plain man may understand it, while in the notes he adduces the\r\n evidence that the specialist requires. The whole matter is thoroughly\r\n digested and put in an absolutely intelligible manner ... a brilliant\r\n book that deserves general attention.\"--_New York Sun._\r\n\r\n \"The balance-sheet of Darwinism is struck in this work ... the attack\r\n and the defense of Darwinism, well summarized ... the value of this\r\n book lies in its summing up of the Darwinian doctrines as they have\r\n been modified or verified down to date.\"--_Literary Digest._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the reader will send his name and address, the publishers will send,\r\nfrom time to time, information regarding their new books.\r\n\r\n HENRY HOLT AND COMPANY\r\n PUBLISHERS NEW YORK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerican Science Series\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two principal objects of the series are to supply authoritative\r\nbooks whose principles are, so far as practicable, illustrated by\r\nAmerican facts, and also to supply the lack that the advance of science\r\nperennially creates, of text-books which at least do not contradict the\r\nlatest generalizations.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysics.\r\n\r\n By A.L.

It is the intention that in its own way,\r\nthe new series shall stand on a par with its famous predecessor.\r\n\r\nThe primary object of the new series is to answer questions which the\r\ncontemplation of Nature is constantly arousing in the mind of the\r\nunscientific intelligent person. But a collateral object will be to\r\ngive some intelligent notion of the \"causes of things.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the coöperation of foreign scholars will not be declined, the\r\nbooks will be under the guarantee of American experts, and generally\r\nfrom the American point of view; and where material crowds space,\r\npreference will be given to American facts over others of not more than\r\nequal interest.\r\n\r\nThe series will be in six divisions:\r\n\r\n\r\nI. NATURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nThis division will consist of two sections.\r\n\r\nSection A. A large popular Natural History in several volumes, with the\r\ntopics treated in due proportion, by authors of unquestioned authority.\r\n8vo. 7-1/2 × 10-1/4 in.\r\n\r\nThe books so far publisht in this section are:\r\n\r\n FISHES, by David Starr Jordan, President of the Leland Stanford Junior\r\n University. $6.00 net; carriage extra.\r\n\r\n AMERICAN INSECTS, by Vernon L.
