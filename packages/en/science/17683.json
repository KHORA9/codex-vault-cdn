Prof. Sanborn has prosecuted his work with that patience\r\nand faithfulness characteristic of him, and the result is of a most\r\ninteresting and useful nature.\r\n\r\nThe Professor begins by saying that many works on physics, directly or\r\nby implication, assert that the soil, by a well-known physical law,\r\ngains moisture from the air by night. One author says \"Cultivated soils,\r\non the contrary (being loose and porous), very freely radiate by night\r\nthe heat which they absorb by day; in consequence of which they are much\r\ncooled down and plentifully condense the vapor of air into dew.\" Not all\r\nscientific works, however, make this incautious application of the fact\r\nthat dew results from the condensation of moisture of the air in contact\r\nwith cooler bodies. Farmers have quite universally accepted the view\r\nquoted, and believe that soils gain moisture by night from the air. This\r\ngain is considered of very great importance in periods of droughts, and\r\nis used in arguments favoring certain methods of tillage.\r\n\r\nProfessor Stockbridge, in 1879, at the Massachusetts Agricultural\r\nCollege, carried on very valuable and full experiments in test of this\r\ngeneral belief, and arrived at results contradictory of this belief. He\r\nfound, in a multitude of tests, that in every instance, save one, for\r\nthe months from May to November, that the surface soil from one to five\r\ninches deep, was warmer than the air instead of cooler, as the law\r\nrequires for condensation of moisture from the air. That exception was\r\nin the center of a dense forest, under peculiar atmospheric conditions.\r\nAfter noting these facts, ingenious methods were employed to test more\r\ndirectly the proposition that soil gains moisture from the air by night,\r\nwith the result that he announced that soils lose moisture by night.\r\nProfessor Stockbridge's efforts met with some criticism, and his\r\nconclusions did not receive the wide acceptance that his view of the\r\nquestion justifies. In reasoning from observation, Professor Stockbridge\r\nnoted that the bottom of a heap of hay, during harvesting, would be wet\r\nin the morning, the under side of a board wet in the morning, and so of\r\nthe other objects named. In the progress of tillage experiments related\r\nin his Bulletins Nos. 3 and 5, Prof. Sanborn's attention was again\r\ncalled to this question, resulting in the prosecution of direct tests of\r\nthe soil moisture itself. When completed it is thought that there will\r\nthen no longer be occasion to reason from assumed premises regarding the\r\nmatter. The trials were begun late, and under disadvantages; and are to\r\nbe understood as preliminary to more complete tests during 1884. The\r\nexperiments were all conducted upon a soil bare of vegetation.\r\n\r\nProf. Sanborn concludes from his experiments thus far that the surface\r\ngains moisture from soil beneath it by capillary action, but gathers\r\nnothing from the air. This is made strongly probable, if not shown;\r\nfirst, because the soil is warmer by night than the air. (He relies upon\r\nother facts than his own for this assertion.) 2nd. Because he found more\r\nmoisture in the soil when covered over night than when left bare. 3d.\r\nBecause when hoed, thereby disturbing capillary action, he found less\r\nmoisture than when unhoed, in surface soil. Finally, he concludes the\r\nposition proven, for, when he shut off the upward flow of water to the\r\nsurface of the soil, he found not only less moisture above the cut off\r\nor in the surface soil than where no disturbance of capillary action\r\nhad been made, but actually less moisture in the surface soil than the\r\nnight before. Strongly corroborating this conclusion is the fact that\r\nall of the tests conspire to show that the gain of moisture in the\r\nsurface of the soil by night is traceable to one source, and only one\r\nsource.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMERICAN ASH.--See Page 25.]\r\n\r\nThe facts of this bulletin accord with the previous ones in showing that\r\nmulching and frequent shallow tillage economize the moisture of the soil\r\nand add new proof of this to those already given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIALTY IN FARMING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis subject in my estimation should begin to attract attention,\r\nespecially among the large land owners and farmers of the West. If we\r\nstudy the whole catalogue of money-making enterprises and money-making\r\nmen, we find that the greatest success has been attained where there has\r\nbeen the greatest concentration on a special line of work. True, it is,\r\nthat specialists are subject to unexpected changes of the times, and if\r\nthrown out of their employment are not well prepared for other work, and\r\nyet their chances for success as compared with the \"general idea\" man\r\nare as ten to one.\r\n\r\nFor an example look at science. How has it advanced? Is it not by the\r\ninvaluable aid of men who have given their whole lives to the solution\r\nof some special problem? It could not be otherwise. If every scientist\r\nhad attempted to master the majority of scientific truths before he was\r\ncontented to concentrate his time on some special branch of science,\r\nscience would have progressed little or none at all. Linnaeus opened the\r\nway in botany, and the world profited by his blunders. But to be\r\nbrief--it seems to me that the most successful farmer in the future is\r\nto be the man who can so arrange his work that he is led into the\r\ndeepest research on some one branch of farming. He must be a specialist.\r\nHe must thoroughly master the raising of fine stock for breeding\r\npurposes, for practical profit and the shambles. Attend stock\r\nassociations, and hear witnesses testify on every hand to the\r\ndifficulties connected with properly rearing calves for breeding\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe honest breeder, though full of ideas, acknowledges he knows but very\r\nlittle on breeding. His time in farm life, for twenty years or more has\r\nbeen devoted to too many things. Is not the expert swine-grower the\r\nsuccessful man? Books are something, but practical experience is\r\nsomething more. It matters little however practical the author of a work\r\non agricultural science may be, unless the man who reads has some\r\npractical experience, his application of the author's truths will be a\r\ntotal failure.\r\n\r\nWe insist, therefore, that the successful farmer must be a specialist.\r\nHe must devote his time to special more than to general farm work. You\r\nask me to outline in detail the idea thus advanced. You somewhat\r\nquestion its practicability. To attempt it might lead to endless\r\ndiscussion, but let us reduce to example. Farmer A. raises cattle, hogs,\r\nand sheep for breeding purposes, devotes some attention to fine horses,\r\nand keeps thirty-six cows for dairy purposes. Farmer B. devotes his\r\nentire attention to dairying and has invested in dairy cows as much\r\nmoney as A. has in all his stock. Is it not evident that though each\r\nfarmer began life the same year, the latter man will make the most\r\nmoney, providing the section he is in demands dairy work? It seems to me\r\nso. And if we further place limit on the dairyman's work, we should say\r\nhe can not afford, with fifty or seventy-five cows, to give as much\r\nattention to the manufacture of cheese and butter as that work\r\nnecessarily demands. Even though he employs a specialist in creamery\r\nwork, he himself must be a specialist to some extent. We say to\r\ninvesting farmers do not put $500 into horses, $500 into fine cattle,\r\nand $500 into swine, but concentrate on one class of stock, and give\r\nthat your time.\r\n\r\n    J.N.

CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nA respectable looking, middle-aged gentleman called upon me not long\r\nsince and told me he was a resident of an interior city of some eight or\r\nten thousand inhabitants, and at a recent public meeting had been\r\nappointed chairman of a committee on the improvement of a small park,\r\nwhich it was thought might be made an attractive ornamental feature of\r\nthe town.\r\n\r\nOn further inquiry I learned that the proposed park was simply a public\r\nsquare with a street on each of its four sides, on which fronted the\r\nprincipal public buildings, stores, etc. It was a dead level, with no\r\nnatural features of any kind to suggest the manner of its arrangement,\r\nbut they thought it might be made to add to the beauty of the town, and\r\nhe had called to ask my advice in regard to it.\r\n\r\nAs the arrangement of such areas had occupied my thoughts a good deal in\r\na general way, it occurred to me that this was a good opportunity to\r\nventilate some opinions I had formed in regard to prevalent errors in\r\ntheir management, and accordingly I addressed him substantially as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"It is very rare that the people of any town show a just appreciation of\r\nthe value of such an area for ornamental use. Such a piece of ground as\r\nyou describe in the very business center of a town must of course\r\npossess great pecuniary value, and the fact that it has been voluntarily\r\ngiven up and devoted for all time to purposes of recreation and ornament\r\nwould lead us to expect that they would at least exercise the same\r\nshrewdness in securing their money's worth, that they do in their\r\nprivate transactions. They have given this valuable tract for the object\r\nof ornamenting the town by relieving the artificial character of the\r\nbuildings and streets by the refreshing verdure of trees and grass and\r\nshrubbery, and that it may afford a place for rest and recreation for\r\ntired wayfarers and laborers, and nurses with their children, and a\r\npleasant resort for rest and refreshment when the labors of the day are\r\nat an end.\r\n\r\n\"Its arrangement, therefore, should be such as to set forth these\r\nobjects so obviously that no one could look upon the scene without\r\nperceiving it. The trees should be so arranged in groups and in such\r\nvarieties as would afford picturesque effects when seen from the\r\nprincipal points of approach. The paths and open areas should be so\r\narranged as to prevent the possibility of saving time by a short cut\r\nacross, and so provided with seats under the shade of the trees as to\r\ninvite to repose, instead of this, in nine cases out of ten, the trees\r\n(if any are planted) are simply set in rows at equal distances, without\r\nthe faintest attempt at picturesque effect, and the paths are carried\r\ndiagonally across from corner to corner for the express purpose of\r\naffording an opportunity for a short-cut to every one who is hastening\r\nto or from his business. The consequence is that at certain hours the\r\npaths are filled by a hurrying throng whose presence would alone suffice\r\nto banish the effect of repose which should be the ruling spirit of the\r\nplace, while at all other times it is comparatively deserted.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps these ideas might not be satisfactory to your people, and I\r\nhave therefore set them forth somewhat at length in order that you may\r\nunderstand what I conceive should be the ruling principle of\r\narrangement.\"\r\n\r\nI perceived that my visitor was somewhat disturbed and it was not till\r\nhe had told me, in a kind of half apologetic way, that he did not know\r\n\"but what I was pretty nigh right,\" that he finally informed me that the\r\nsquare in question was already divided in the manner I described, by\r\ndiagonal paths, and moreover that the paths were lined on each side by\r\nrows of well-grown trees.\r\n\r\nI could not help inquiring what further laying out it required, and it\r\nthen came out that there had been no thought of a re-arrangement of the\r\ncomponent elements of the park in order to give it an expression of\r\ngrace or beauty, but they had thought I might be able to make it\r\nattractive by the introduction of rustic arbors and gateways, or perhaps\r\na fountain or \"something of that sort to give it a stylish look.\"\r\n\r\nI gave him an advertising pamphlet containing designs and prices of\r\ngarden ornaments, and told him they could select and order whatever they\r\nliked from the manufacturers,--but declined to give any advice which\r\nshould connect my name with the work.\r\n\r\nI have told this story as the readiest means of setting forth my ideas\r\nof the capabilities of such public areas, and also as an illustration of\r\nprevailing errors in regard to landscape gardening, which most people\r\nseem to think consists solely of extraneous, artificial decoration, by\r\nmeans of which any piece of ground can be made beautiful, however stiff\r\nand formal may be the arrangement of the trees, shrubbery, and lawns\r\nwhich give expression to its character as truly as the features of a\r\nhuman face.\r\n\r\nSuch squares as I have described are the most common and simple forms of\r\npublic parks, and they might and should in all cases constitute not only\r\na chief ornament of the town, but a most attractive place of resort for\r\nrest and refreshment. Nothing beyond the materials which nature\r\nfurnishes is needed for the purpose, but it is essential that these\r\nshould be gracefully dispersed, and that they should exhibit a\r\nluxuriant, healthy growth.\r\n\r\nAbove all we should avoid the introduction of artificial decorations\r\nwhich are intended to \"look pretty.\" If arbors or rests are needed, let\r\nthem be placed at the points where they are obviously required, and be\r\nmade of graceful patterns; but do not put elaborate structures of rustic\r\nwork where no one will ever use them, and where in a few years they will\r\nbe only dilapidated monuments of a futile effort at display.\r\n\r\nThe Village Improvement Societies which are everywhere springing up\r\nshould devote their earliest efforts to the tasteful arrangement and\r\ncare of these public ornamental areas, which should form the nucleus and\r\npattern of the graceful expression which should pervade the streets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFARM NAMES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the call of THE PRAIRIE FARMER for \"something new\" I have been\r\nafraid to follow any of the old beaten paths so long traveled by\r\nagricultural writers; and have been on the lookout for the \"something\r\nnew.\" Something that does not appear in our agricultural papers, yet of\r\ninterest to the fraternity. It matters little how trifling the subject\r\nmay be, if it begets an interest in farm or country life; anything that\r\nwill make our homes more attractive, more beautiful, and leave a lasting\r\nimpression on the minds of the boys and girls that now cluster around\r\nthe farmers' hearths throughout this vast country of ours.\r\n\r\nThere is a beautiful little song entitled, \"What is Home Without a\r\nMother?\" which could be supplemented with another of equal interest, to\r\nwit: \"What is Home Without a Name?\" I answer, a dreary waste of field\r\nand fence, there being nothing in the mind of the absent one to remind\r\nhim of his distant home but a lone farm-house, a barn, long lines of\r\nfences, and perhaps a few stunted apple trees; and when he thinks of it,\r\nhis whole mind reverts to the hot harvest field, the sweat, the toil,\r\nand the tiresomeness of working those big fields! Nothing attractive, no\r\npleasant memory. Nothing to draw the mind of the youth to the roof that\r\nsheltered his childhood. No wonder boys and girls yearn for a change.\r\n\r\nThen what are we to do to change this for the better. I say give your\r\ncountry homes a name, no matter how homely or isolated that home may be.\r\nGive each one a name, and let those names be appropriate and musical,\r\nshort, sweet, and easily remembered and pronounced, and then, when you\r\ngo to visit a neighbor, either on business or pleasure, instead of\r\nsaying, I am going to Jones', or to Brown's, or Smith's, let it be, I am\r\ngoing over to \"The Cedars,\" or, to \"Hickory Grove,\" or, to \"Holly Hill.\"\r\nHow much pleasanter it would sound. There would be no mistake about your\r\ndestination, there being perhaps half a dozen Jones, Browns, or Smiths\r\nwithin five miles of your home, but only one \"Hickory Hill.\" Then, when\r\nyoung folks make up their surprise parties during the long, cold, winter\r\nevenings, in place of notifying each other that they are going to\r\nsurprise the James', the Jones', or the Jackson's, it would be, we are\r\ngoing to surprise \"Pleasant Valley\" \"Viewfield\" or \"Walnut Hill.\" Every\r\nmember of the surprise party would know the place intended, and the\r\nsquads and companies of sleighs with their closely packed loads of\r\nlaughing girls, and well filled baskets of good things would begin to\r\nmarshal on the several roads that lead towards the trysting place; and\r\nwhen the merry-makers reach the well trimmed walnut grove from which the\r\nfarm takes its name, and march up to the dwelling, instead of shouting:\r\nMrs. Brown, we greet you, or Uncle Brown, etc., it would be: \"Walnut\r\nHill\" we greet you, which would include all the Browns, old and young.\r\n\r\nOne of the brightest spots in my memory is the remembrance of \"Rose\r\nValley\" my childhood's happy home. Every pleasant occurrence of my\r\nboyhood clusters around that never-to-be forgotten name. It has acted\r\nlike a guide, a land mark for me through my life; and my great aim in\r\nlife has been to make my own home just like dear \"Rose Valley.\" To begin\r\nthe work, I have set my own house in order; and the following names\r\ngiven to the farms under my care will practically illustrate my plan.\r\n\r\n-----------------+-------------------------+-----------------------------\r\n  FORMER OWNERS. |       FARM NAMES.       | PRESENT TENANTS.\r\n-----------------+-------------------------+-----------------------------\r\nThompson Place   | Hickory Ridge           | A.

Every one of those farms can be identified by some\r\nlocal peculiarity, prominent and visible. For instance, Davis place is\r\nsituated close to a large pond covered with white lilies. Standing on\r\nthe doorsteps of the Manning place you can view a ten-mile stretch of\r\nthe Mississippi river, while Mr. Relley's place is situated on the banks\r\nof that great stream. Such names can be multiplied to an indefinite\r\nextent, and duplicated in each county.\r\n\r\nIf such names were generally in use, it would greatly assist postmasters\r\nin their difficult task of knowing which Smith or Brown was intended.\r\n\r\nNow brother farmers, I have moved the adoption of appropriate names for\r\nevery farm in the land; who will second the motion? Give your wives and\r\ndaughters a chance to name the homestead, and my word for it, it will be\r\nboth musical and appropriate. Let us give our children something\r\npleasant to think of after they have left the dear old home. To afix the\r\nname, paint it on a large board and nail it over your front gate.\r\n\r\n    ALEX ROSS,\r\n    CAPE GIRARDEAU, MO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIOGENES IN HIS TUB.\r\n\r\n\r\nAllow me, Messrs. Editors, to give you notes of what I see, and hear,\r\nand learn, and cogitate, and endeavor to inculcate, from my snug little\r\nhome in my Tub--will you not?\r\n\r\nWell--having your assent, I begin by wishing you all--editors,\r\ncorrespondents, typos, and \"devils\"--a Happy New Year, and your\r\nexcellent paper unlimited success in 1884, and a long life thereafter.\r\nNext, permit me to advert to the contents of some\r\n\r\nRECENT NUMBERS.\r\n\r\nFirst, to the pro and con of pasturing corn-stalks. That is a subject,\r\nlike many others, on which much can be said on both sides. Mr. Stahl (in\r\nNo. 50) quotes Prof. Sanborn as saying that a ton of corn fodder,\r\n\"rightly cured and saved,\" is worth two-thirds of a ton of good timothy\r\nhay. That may be true; but to be rightly cured and saved it must be\r\nprotected from the rains and snows as the hay is; otherwise it will be\r\nas worthless as the corn left standing in the field. Most people who\r\nhave cut their corn and left it standing in the shock during the fall\r\nrains, know by experience that large portions of it are rendered\r\nuseless. And if we deduct the waste of corn by wet, and by rats and\r\nmice, and the waste of fodder, added to the cost of cutting, it would\r\nseem that a \"Subscriber\" (in No. 52) has at least a strong side of the\r\nargument. But these men are both right, in a degree. In the East in\r\ncases where the crop is not large, or in the West, and where the\r\nproducer has large barns or sheds in which to store his fodder, it had\r\ndoubtless best be cut and utilized in that way. But where no such\r\nfacilities exist and the crop is large, as usual in the West, I can\r\nconceive of no better way to utilize the product than to feed it where\r\nit grew.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO RAISE WHEAT.\r\n\r\nProf. Hamilton (see No. 52) has hit the nail squarely on the head in his\r\nessay. I doubt if there has been a more valuable article on\r\nwheat-growing in the public prints, for many a day. It gives a new view\r\nof the question, and in my opinion illustrates, at least in part, why it\r\nwas that in the early days of wheat-growing throughout the prairie\r\nStates, the crops were so much better than now. Wheat was then sown for\r\nthe most part on newly broken prairie sod, and its character was such\r\nthat the grain could not be deeply covered, nor could the ground be\r\nheaved so much as in later sowings, when it has been mellowed by deeper\r\nculture. Prof. Hamilton's essay ought to be read by every wheat-grower\r\nin the country. Other valuable articles in No. 52 are those of J.H., on\r\nCorn, Prof. Hall's lecture on Schools, and many others--not omitting\r\nwhat the two talented ladies say about hens and bees.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTS AND BARONS IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\nSome alarm has been manifested in certain quarters, and Congress been\r\ninquired of, concerning the fact that divers European noblemen have been\r\npurchasing large bodies of lands in our public domain. There are no\r\nlaws, I believe, to prevent foreign noblemen from acquiring lands in\r\nlarge or small quantities in our Territories; but it is clearly contrary\r\nto public policy to permit these, or our own capitalists or syndicates\r\nto do this thing. The public lands should be held for actual settlers,\r\nand for them alone; and it is to be hoped that Congress will so amend\r\nthe laws as to prevent English or European lords, or American lords,\r\nfrom acquiring large bodies of land. The Government has been\r\ngenerous--too generous--to the railroads in the gift of lands; and that\r\npolicy ought now to cease, and the roads required to fulfil their side\r\nof the contract to the letter.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONOPOLY--AGRARIANISM.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the above, it will do to say, that as monopolies\r\nincrease and gain strength, agrarianism also is extending. Legislation\r\nshould be so shaped as to check the one, and give no cause for the\r\nother. Good government and strict regard for the rights and interests of\r\nthe masses, are the surest means of checking agrarian and nihilistic\r\ntendencies. Had the French monarchy and governing classes been just, the\r\nrevolution would have been impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CONCLUDE.\r\n\r\nIt does seem to me that your magnificent offer of your Standard Time or\r\nCommercial Map--worth $2 itself--in connection with THE PRAIRIE FARMER,\r\nall for $2, ought to bring you hosts of subscribers, and that it does is\r\nthe hope of\r\n\r\n    DIOGENES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIELD AND FURROW.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best temperature to preserve apples, potatoes, turnips, or any other\r\nroots or fruits stored in the cellar, is just above the freezing point.\r\n\r\nStiff, hard clays intended for tillage in the spring ought, by all\r\nmeans, to be broken up in the fall. A light, sandy soil should, on the\r\ncontrary, be suffered to remain unbroken.\r\n\r\nA wholesale drug house in Indianapolis, tells the editor of the Drainage\r\nJournal that tile drainage has reduced the sale of quinine and other\r\nfever and ague medicines nearly sixty per cent.\r\n\r\nThe American Cultivator says that if barley has not germinated the fact\r\nof its having been slightly stained by wet is no actual detriment\r\nwhatsoever; the grain is not really injured and ought to bring to the\r\nfarmer just as much as the bright samples of equal plumpness.\r\n\r\nDr. E. Lewis Sturtevant, reporting in Bulletin LXXII. of the State\r\nExperiment Station his hybridizing tests during the past season with 135\r\ndifferent kinds of corn, incidentally mentions that \"the red ears have a\r\nconstancy of color which is truly remarkable; where sweet corn appears\r\nupon red pop and red dent ears the sweet corn partakes of the red\r\ncolor.\"\r\n\r\nAn esteemed exchange suggests, if farmers would go to the barn on a wet\r\nday and spend their time in making an eaves-trough for the barn or\r\nstable, and thereby carry away the drip which would otherwise fall on\r\nthe manure pile, causing a waste of the elements of plant food contained\r\ntherein, they will make more money that day than they could any fine day\r\nin the field.\r\n\r\nAmerican Cultivator: In winter, while the ground is covered with snow\r\nand the soil is frozen deeply, it is sometimes curious to note the\r\neffect of openings leading down to deep underdrains. The snow will be\r\nmelted away by the warm air coming up from the unfrozen earth. Even in\r\nan uncovered drain three feet deep, a little straw or loose earth will\r\ngenerally protect the bottom from severe freezing.\r\n\r\nCincinnati Gazette: There are so many excellencies about the cow pea,\r\nand it is good for so many uses, that we advise our Ohio, Indiana, and\r\nKentucky farmers to be sure and cultivate it this year. Next spring,\r\nwhen all danger of frost is over, sow, plant, or drill more or less of\r\nthese valuable peas, and, in the language of the elder Weller, \"you'll\r\nbe glad on it arterwards,\" and so will your live stock.\r\n\r\nNew England Homestead: Nearly level culture, hand-hoeing and slightly\r\nhilling but once, and keeping the cultivator running, was recommended at\r\nthe Waterbury meeting as the best culture for potatoes. It was said that\r\nthe second hilling induced a second growth of roots higher up on the\r\nplant which produced small tubers. If this is not done the additional\r\ngrowth will make large potatoes.\r\n\r\nCincinnati Gazette: During sundry recent visits to Tennessee, we noticed\r\nthat a considerable share of the immigrants arriving were from Michigan.\r\nThey are mostly of the second generation from the settlers from the East\r\nin that State--men in the prime of life, who are seeking cheap lands in\r\na genial climate, where the pastoral, dairy, and fruit-raising pursuits\r\nto which they are accustomed may be pursued with perfect success.\r\nMichigan farmers are usually intelligent, practical workers, who\r\nunderstand their profession and like it. They, and such as they,\r\nappreciate the advantages they will enter upon in their new homes at the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nNew England Farmer: Prof. Goessmann, as Director of the State Experiment\r\nStation, has been analyzing a sample of rye hay, sent to the Station by\r\nSecretary Russell of the State Board of Agriculture. The sample was not\r\ncut till in full bloom, but Prof. Goessmann finds it compares well in\r\nnutritive value with a medium good quality of meadow hay. This agrees\r\nwith our own estimate of well cured rye hay, judged by its effect in\r\npractical feeding to stock. Animals usually have to learn to eat it\r\nheartily, as they do many other kinds of coarse fodder which are\r\ninferior to the best hay. Rye should be cut before it comes in full\r\nbloom, to obtain the greatest feeding value from the fodder. It is then\r\nliked better, and a larger per cent will be digested.\r\n\r\nRepublican, Manhattan, Kan.: In traveling through a considerable portion\r\nof the country this week, we noticed that the wheat looked exceedingly\r\npromising. The contrast between the green fields and the dry grass and\r\nnaked trees was cheering to behold. Cattle are in good condition; most\r\nof the farmers are provided with sheds or shelter of some sort to\r\nprotect the animals, but we saw some small bunches of young cattle\r\nstanding in unprotected enclosures shivering from the north wind; it is\r\ncruel to take them through the winter without so much as a wind break to\r\nturn off the scorching blasts. Surely every farmer can afford to build a\r\nwind break, at least a pile of brush and old hay, around the stock\r\nyards. The cost would be more than made up in the saving of feed.\r\n\r\nThey are growing some pretty heavy crops of wheat in New Hampshire. The\r\nLebanon Free Press reports that Harlan Flint, of Hanover, raised this\r\nyear eighty bushels of wheat on five acres of ground, and Uel Spencer,\r\nof the same town, 206 bushels from four and a half acres, while the town\r\nfarm crop averaged forty-three bushels per acre. That raised by Mr.\r\nFlint was winter wheat, and Spencer's White Russian. A Meredith\r\ncorrespondent of the Laconia Democrat says that eight farms adjoining\r\neach other, in that town, have produced this year 524 bushels of wheat.\r\nReports from all sections of the State show that a great yield of wheat\r\nhas been secured wherever the crop has been sown. Perhaps by the time\r\nthe prairie skinners of the Northwest have spread over all the wheat\r\nbearing land this side of the Rocky Mountains, they may begin the New\r\nEngland States and travel the continent over again.\r\n\r\nCorrespondent Farm and Fireside: There is nothing so much needed about\r\nmany houses as good walks in paths that must be used daily. There is\r\nhardly an excuse for not having them when either brick, gravel, or\r\ntimber can be had. A good walk through muddy yards can be easily and\r\ncheaply made by placing poles side by side, a short distance apart, and\r\nthen filling the intervening space with gravel, or with broken corn\r\ncobs, or with sawdust. Oak planks will last many years, if turned over\r\noccasionally, and this also counteracts warping. One of the best of\r\nwalks through a level barn-yard can be made by cutting off short pieces\r\nfrom logs, a foot or more in diameter, and setting them upon end in a\r\nshallow trench. Such a walk from the barn to the kitchen will always be\r\nclean, and there will be less to disturb the temper of the women folks\r\nof the household, to say nothing of the good effect upon the men folks\r\nwho take pleasure in lightening the labor required to keep everything\r\nneat and tidy within doors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL ORGANIZATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Officers and members of farmers' organizations of all kinds are\r\ninvited to send for publication in this department notices of meetings,\r\ntime of holding fairs, and other pertinent information. We desire to\r\nmake of it a weekly bulletin that shall be looked for with interest by\r\nmembers of clubs, granges, fair associations, and agricultural and\r\nhorticultural societies._]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Maine State Grange has elected the following officers: Master,\r\nFrederick Robie, of Gorham; Overseer, H.E. Gregory, of Hampden;\r\nLecturer, D.H. Thing, of Vernon.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Wisconsin State Grange resolutions were passed\r\nrequesting the Legislature to separate the State Agricultural Experiment\r\nFarm from the State University, and to locate it in an agricultural\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the Vermont State Grange's annual meeting at Brattleboro, December\r\n13-14, 1883, 72 granges were represented. For the first time since the\r\norganization of the grange its doors were opened to the public, and the\r\nState Board of Agriculture met with it. Worthy Master Franklin's address\r\nrevealed a healthy condition of the Order in Vermont.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the Massachusetts State Grange was an excellent one.\r\nMaster Draper was again re-elected. The committees' reports and\r\ndiscussions revealed a hearty interest in and sympathy with the\r\nexperimental station and the agricultural college, but the present\r\nsystem by which the college trustees perpetuate themselves was sharply\r\ncriticised, and a change in the law was recommended. It was also\r\n\"Resolved, that as Patrons of Husbandry, we recommend such a change in\r\nthe law as will withhold the State bounty from all societies that permit\r\nliquor selling or gambling at their annual fairs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting of the Michigan Grange last month was largely\r\nattended. The Secretary's report showed the grange to be in good\r\ncondition. The committee on the agricultural college recommended the\r\nadmission of girls to that institution. Reports were adopted\r\nrecommending the restoration of the duty on wool, so that it shall equal\r\nthat on manufactured woolen articles; urged that taxpayers be required\r\nto make oath to their assessments; recommended the continued fostering\r\nof the sorghum industry; condemned the extortionate practices of many\r\nmillers in the State, urging co-operative mills if necessary to remedy\r\nthe same, and asks the appointment of a committee to draft a bill\r\nsimilar to the Reagan bill to remedy some of the evils of\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIDN'T NO. 38 DIE HARD!\r\n\r\n\r\nNew England Homestead: \"The eminent men\"--George B. Loring, Daniel\r\nNeedham, Charles L. Flint, Benjamin P. Ware, and George Noyes--composing\r\nthe late Massachusetts grange No. 38, couldn't appreciate what had\r\nhappened to them when the State Master's action in revoking the charter\r\nof their grange was sustained by the National Grange tribunal. So\r\nBrother Ware hied him to Barre, last week, to bring the matter up before\r\nthe State Grange at its annual session. No doubt the \"eminent men\"\r\nsupposed that the presence of the Hon. Mr. Ware would alone be\r\nsufficient to cause the State Grange to tremble and humbly beg pardon\r\nfor their Master's action in disturbing the serenity of this mutual\r\nadmiration society. Alas, pride must have a fall! Judge of the\r\nconsternation of these \"eminent men\" when the State Grange unanimously\r\nrefused admittance to Brother Ware because he was a suspended member!\r\nNow if the honorable delegate from No. 38 deceased had known when he was\r\n\"set on,\" he would have silently packed his grip sack and returned to\r\nthe secrecy of the obscure agricultural newspaper office at 45 Milk\r\nstreet, Boston, the \"headquarters\" of the corpse of No. 38. But like all\r\n\"eminent men\" he made a grave mistake. At a subsequent session he\r\ninduced a friend to move that he be given a hearing, but the grange\r\nagain voted against taking any further action in the matter. This double\r\nrebuff was effectual. With his hopes dashed to the ground, the honorable\r\nsuspended brother crept sadly away to the depot, and when last seen was\r\ntrying to derive some consolation from his flattering picture as it\r\nappeared in the Homestead of December 15.\r\n\r\nAs our able contemporary, the Maine Farmer remarks, it was a triumph of\r\nprinciple, proving that the grange recognizes no aristocracy. Thus may\r\nit ever be!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GRANGE TEMPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt its last meeting the National Grange determined to enter upon the\r\nwork of erecting, in Washington city, a building in which the records\r\nand archives of the Order may be preserved. It is proposed to raise the\r\nmoney needful to erect such a building in a way which shall enlist the\r\nbrotherhood at large, and yet not to be burdensome to even the least\r\nwealthy of the members. The National Grange asks each subordinate grange\r\nto solicit from every name on its roll a contribution of not less than\r\nfifty cents. The money so collected is to be kept separate from all\r\nother funds, and is to be used for no other purpose than the building of\r\na Grange Home in Washington. The treasurer of the National Grange is\r\ndirected to procure a book in which the names of all contributors, and\r\nthe sums contributed, shall be properly entered. In due time a\r\nbuilding-fund certificate will be prepared, containing an engraving of\r\nthe building, and such other devices as may be agreed upon, and a copy\r\nof the same will be sent to every individual who donates the sum of\r\nfifty cents or more.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCLUB RATES.\r\n\r\nTO OUR READERS.\r\n\r\nTHE PRAIRIE FARMER is the OLDEST, MOST RELIABLE, and the LEADING\r\nAGRICULTURAL JOURNAL OF THE GREAT NORTHWEST, devoted exclusively to the\r\ninterests of the Farmer, Gardener, Florist, Stock Breeder, Dairyman,\r\nEtc., and every species of industry connected with that great portion of\r\nthe People of the World, the PRODUCERS.

Todd, of Wakeman, Ohio,\r\nwon on Chester-Whites and Poland-Chinas in 1883 as follows: At the\r\nTri-State Fair, at Toledo, O., sweepstakes for best herd of\r\nPoland-Chinas, and the same on Chester-Whites. At the Michigan State\r\nFair he took sweepstakes on Chester-White boar; at the Illinois State\r\nFair, sweepstakes, for best Poland-China sow; do. for Chester-White sow,\r\nand the grand sweepstakes of $50 for the best herd on the ground\r\nregardless of breed. He also won in breeders' ring the prize for best\r\nherd of Chesters, and the prize for best boar with five of his get; also\r\nfirst and second prizes for sow with five of her pigs. Besides these\r\nnotable premiums Mr. Todd's stock won for him nearly 100 class prizes at\r\nvarious leading fairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWINE STATISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the Chicago dailies recently made the point that this city should\r\nbe the center of the swine and pork statistics of the country on the\r\nground that here is the center of trade in these products. The point is\r\na good one. Some years ago the bulk of the hogs of the West was marketed\r\nat Cincinnati. At that time the Price Current of Cincinnati with\r\ncommendable enterprize established itself as an authority in swine and\r\npork statistics, and it has held the position from that day to this,\r\ndespite the fact that Chicago has for several years received and packed\r\nseveral times as many hogs annually as has the original porkopolis. And\r\nthis year, as usual, the Chicago press is dependent upon Cincinnati for\r\npacking statistics throughout the extensive swine-growing regions of the\r\ncountry. Of course it makes no real difference to merchants or producers\r\nwhere the figures emanate from so that they are comprehensive and\r\nreliable. It is only a bit of local pride that suggests the idea that\r\nhere should the records be kept and the statistics compiled. If there is\r\nnot sufficient enterprize here to capture the business, there is no\r\nground for complaint. We should not have alluded to the matter,\r\nprobably, but for the fact that the Cincinnati Price Current, with its\r\nhog-packing statistics, for the season of 1883 has just brought it to\r\nnotice. Here the figures are compared with those of last year:\r\n\r\nCities.                           1883-84.   1882-83.\r\n\r\nChicago, packed                  1,405,000  1,500,000\r\nKansas City                        254,059    233,336\r\nCincinnati                         301,000    300,000\r\nSt. Louis                          200,000    207,000\r\nIndianapolis                       181,700    183,000\r\nMilwaukee                          185,000    197,000\r\nLouisville, Ky.                    142,000    118,000\r\nCedar Rapids, Iowa                  91,618     86,965\r\nCleveland, O.                       62,280     42,352\r\nKeokuk, Iowa                        28,601     31,411\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIOWA STOCK BREEDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Iowa State Improved Stock Breeders' Association had a good\r\nattendance at its annual meeting at Ames, last month.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEEP.\r\n\r\nHon. J. Kennedy read a paper on the subject \"Will Sheep Breeding Pay.\"\r\nViewed from a financial point of view, he thought there had been no\r\nbetter financial results from any commodity than from the sheep--the\r\nwool and mutton--when given proper care and attention. Speculators and\r\ntraffickers in wool and woolen goods were failing all over the country,\r\nbut he attributed this to want of fitness for the business in which they\r\nwere engaged. Though the present depression in the wool market was\r\nsomewhat due to tariff tinkering, was more the result of\r\nover-production--greater supply than demand.\r\n\r\nMr. Grinnell said that at one time he was the owner of a flock of 6,000\r\nsheep, but wool went down in price, and he did not think it profitable\r\nto keep so large a flock, and sold out.\r\n\r\nCol. Lucas believed the owner of 160 acres of land could not do better\r\nthan to put upon the tract at least 100 sheep.\r\n\r\nHon. E. Campbell had found the business profitable where flocks were\r\nfairly dealt with. He thought Iowa one of the best places in the world\r\nin which to raise sheep. He believed that both sheep and cattle could be\r\nprofitably kept upon the same farm. His favorite cross is Cotswold and\r\nMerino. The average weight of fleece in his own flock was over six\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWINE.\r\n\r\nCol. John Scott introduced the subject of swine by reading a compilation\r\nof historical facts regarding them. He presented drawings, showing the\r\ndifferent breeds and the improvements made in them, in form and size.\r\n\r\nMr. Failor spoke of the Jersey-Reds as his favorite breed for docility\r\nand other essentials.\r\n\r\nProf. Knapp said the most profitable hogs are those with sound\r\nconstitutions, good muscular systems, of early maturity, and in general\r\nmade to resist diseases which prevail from time to time, all over the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nMr. Young said that when we want an animal for the farm, we must first\r\nlook to soundness of constitution. Breed is not of so much consequence.\r\nA breed should not be run after merely because it is novel. He breeds\r\nPoland-Chinas. In order to gain the most prolific breeding, the sows of\r\nthis breed should not be allowed to get too fat before dropping the\r\nfirst litter; simply keep them in good condition.\r\n\r\nC.R. Smith thought early breeding injurious to the swine interests of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nH.W. Lathrop asserted that the forcing system of putting on meat had\r\ninjured the constitutions of many of our breeds of hogs. In times past,\r\nwhen less pampering was in vogue and hogs were allowed wide range, there\r\nwas less disease than now.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATTLE.\r\n\r\nMr. Clarkson, of Des Moines, read a paper entitled \"Plain and Practical\r\nThoughts for Common Farmers.\" It treated of the breeding and care of\r\ncattle.\r\n\r\nMr. Roberts said the more care there is bestowed upon cattle, the more\r\nprofitable they are. He had bred up from a good Short-horn bull. Other\r\nmembers agreed upon the necessity of improving the grade of cattle. The\r\nbest demand is always for the best stock.\r\n\r\nHon. J.B. Grinnell read his paper upon the extent of the cattle interest\r\nand the necessity of protecting our cattle from contagious diseases, in\r\nthis connection, the following resolutions were passed:\r\n\r\n    Resolved, That we earnestly urge upon Congress, in view of\r\n    the fact, the cattle interest is one of the most important\r\n    industries, the justice and expediency of passing laws\r\n    providing for an effectual eradication of pleuro-pneumonia\r\n    from the entire territory of the United States, and also\r\n    preventing the introduction of all contagious diseases in the\r\n    future. This is the only authority to which we can go for the\r\n    power for this purpose, as Congress has the exclusive power\r\n    to regulate commerce with other nations, as well as among the\r\n    several States; and, as there is now no law in any of the\r\n    States to prevent any man who has a herd infected with a\r\n    malignant, contagious disease, from taking them anywhere he\r\n    pleases to the herds of any of the States; to prevent which,\r\n    there must be a law more comprehensive in territorial power\r\n    and extent than any State has. Therefore, it is of the most\r\n    vital importance that the authority to regulate inter-State\r\n    commerce should promptly act to protect our great cattle\r\n    interest from total annihilation.\r\n\r\n    Resolved, That the Legislature of Iowa, as a police\r\n    regulation, should put the power in some hands, carefully and\r\n    wisely guarded from abuse and wasteful extravagance, to\r\n    arrest by isolation and destruction, if necessary, any\r\n    contagious disease which may suddenly be developed in any\r\n    neighborhood. This, however, not to include any of doubtful\r\n    contagious character, such as hog cholera; and that we\r\n    respectfully ask the Governor to call the especial attention\r\n    of the Legislature to this subject, though there is no\r\n    pleuro-pneumonia in our State now, nor has there ever been\r\n    any, but we need laws to arrest it if any should be\r\n    introduced.\r\n\r\n    Resolved, That nations, as well as individuals, who ask\r\n    justice should do justice, therefore, we insist that our\r\n    Government should as carefully and vigilantly seek to prevent\r\n    the exportation of contagious cattle diseases as to prevent\r\n    their importation. This policy would create a feeling of\r\n    national comity, and an effort to eradicate the scourge of\r\n    nations (the cattle diseases).\r\n\r\n\r\nWOLVES, DOGS, SHEEP.\r\n\r\nThe committee on resolutions submitted the following, which was adopted:\r\n\r\n   Whereas, It has become impossible to keep sheep in safety in\r\n   many parts of this State, owing to the loss occasioned by the\r\n   ravage of wolves and dogs: therefore, be it\r\n\r\n   Resolved, That this association petition the State Legislature\r\n   to increase the bounty on wolves and the tax on dogs.\r\n\r\n   Resolved, That the President of this association be requested\r\n   to appoint a committee to draft a bill embodying the sense of\r\n   this meeting in reference to a wolf and dog law.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUSINESS.\r\n\r\nThe next meeting of the Association will be held at Ottumwa, commencing\r\nthe first Tuesday in December next.\r\n\r\nCol. Scott is to prepare and publish the proceedings of this meeting.\r\nThe edition will be 5,000 copies.\r\n\r\nThe following are the officers for 1884: President, C.F. Clarkson;\r\nVice-presidents, H.C. Wheeler, B.F. Elbert, R. Stockdale, H. Wallace,\r\nW.H. Jordan, E.W. Lucas, and P. Nichols; Secretary and Treasurer, Fitch\r\nB. Stacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HORSE AND HIS TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nNUMBER ONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory chronicles no improvement in the horse made by the agency of\r\nman. The horses of the days of Pharaoh, or of Homer, have their\r\nsuperiors in no part of the civilized world to-day. The Arabs have for\r\nages been noted for the excellence of their horses, but that excellence\r\nwas not created, nor has it been increased by the arts of man. Since the\r\ntime of Cromwell the horses of England have steadily degenerated. Those\r\nmost conversant with the matter say that this degeneracy has been the\r\nmost marked and rapid during the last fifty years. The horses of this\r\ncountry lack the value of their ancestors of the Revolutionary period.\r\nNowhere, or at no time, can man boast of improving the horse by the arts\r\nof breeding. What is the reason of this?\r\n\r\nThe horse, the ox, the hog, and the sheep comprise the four great\r\nclasses of domesticated farm animals. In certain directions man has\r\nimproved these three last. These improvements have made them more\r\nvaluable. The ox has been bred to make more flesh from the same amount\r\nof food, and to lay on fat at an earlier age; the cow has been bred to\r\ngive instead of a supply of milk barely large enough to sustain her\r\nyoung, a bountiful yield, and of a richer quality; the hog has been bred\r\ninto a veritable machine to convert food into pork; the sheep has been\r\nbred to yield more wool, and of a finer texture, and to make more\r\nmutton. All these changes have been beneficial because the value of the\r\nanimal lay in its production of beef, milk, pork, wool, or mutton, as\r\nthe case might be. It is true that these changes have been accomplished\r\nat the expense of vigor and endurance. These two qualities are important\r\nin the hog, ox, or sheep, but those that have been developed so far\r\novershadow their lessening that on the whole we can say that the arts of\r\nman have improved our kine, swine, and sheep.\r\n\r\nBut it is not so with the horse. Its value does not depend upon the\r\nquantity and quality of its flesh, milk, or bodily covering. Unlike the\r\nothers its value depends upon the work it can do. Hence vigor and\r\nendurance are the prime essentials of a good horse. But as man has\r\nlessened the vigor and endurance of the hog, ox, and sheep, so he has of\r\nthe horse. This is the invariable result of human art. Whenever man\r\ntampers with the work of nature he is certain to lessen bodily vigor. It\r\ncould not be otherwise. For the course of nature, undisturbed and\r\nundeflected, is always towards the greatest health. Man changes the\r\ncourse of nature and the result is lessened vigor and endurance.\r\n\r\nMan has improved some qualities of the horse. He has increased its\r\nspeed, perhaps, but only for short distances. Our race horses of to-day\r\nwould make a sorry record with those of days no longer past than those\r\nof the \"pony express,\" to say nothing of the couriers of centuries ago,\r\nbecause they have been made to deteriorate in vigor and endurance. We\r\nhave ponderous, heavy horses to-day; but they can not do as much work\r\nbefore the plow or dray as those of the eighteenth century. We can not\r\npoint anywhere to horses produced by breeding that are the equals of the\r\nhorses of the days of chivalry. They lack not only in vigor and\r\nhardihood, but in intelligence. As the perfect symmetry of development\r\nby the course of nature has been destroyed by man the intelligence of\r\nthe animal lessened. Whenever the hand of man has touched his equine\r\nfriend it has been only to mar.\r\n\r\nThis decrease in the excellence of the horse can not be shifted from man\r\nto time. One instance alone demonstrates the unfairness of this. The\r\nAndalusians are now mere ponies, yet they are the descendants of those\r\nnoble beasts ridden to victory by the Spanish chivalry in the days when\r\nthe valor of the horse was as important as the valor of the knightly\r\nrider. Taken from their hills and valleys to serve in the haunts of men,\r\nand to be subjected to the arts of breeding, they have sadly\r\ndegenerated. But the horses of the Spanish explorers of both North and\r\nSouth America escaped, and to-day the descendants of these same Spanish\r\nhorses are, under the nurture of nature and nature's ways, the superb\r\nwild horses of the new world. They are the work of nature; the\r\nAndalusian ponies are the work of man's art.\r\n\r\nAs this degeneracy is the necessary co-existent of man's breeding, so\r\nfar as it is produced by this cause it can not be escaped. But a good\r\npart of the evil is not the necessary sequence of breeding per se. It is\r\nalso attributable to errors in treatment so palpable and easy of\r\ncorrection that it behooves us to note and avoid them. In my next I\r\nshall briefly mention a few of the most important of these.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBreeder and Sportsman: The old story of the countryman and his deceptive\r\nplug was recently repeated in Jersey, where people are supposed to have\r\ntheir eye-teeth cut. It was an old gray pacer this time, attached to a\r\ndilapidated wagon by cords and odd ends of harness. The astute hotel\r\nproprietor refused to give $20 for the outfit. Owner then replied that\r\nhe would pace the horse over a good track in three minutes. Landlord\r\nbets $100 to $50 that he can't do it. Money was then put up, and owner\r\nwanted to draw, as the track was a good way off, and he could not spare\r\nthe time to attend to the matter. Landlord insisted that the horse must\r\npace or pay forfeit. A sulky and harness were borrowed, and judge placed\r\nin the stand, according to Hoyle. Owner claims the right to three\r\ntrials, according to National Association rules. Point conceded. Old\r\ncrowbait is scored up and given the word. Works off the mile very slick\r\nin 2:43.

Its feasibility is already established on\r\na small scale, and there seems to be no discernible limit to the demand\r\nfor a first-class article during the six months when the pastures are\r\nbarren. The farmer who has the capital can readily provide a barn that\r\nwill make his cows nearly as comfortable and healthy in winter as in\r\nsummer, and shelter all the food they need to keep up a constant flow of\r\nrich milk. We have not attained, perhaps, all the information necessary\r\nto secure the best rations for winter milking, yet we are approximating\r\ntoward that knowledge. Some think they have found in ensilage the one\r\nthing needful. Yet, some of the parties dealing in gilt-edge butter\r\nbegin to complain of that made from rations consisting largely of\r\nensilage. We shall probably have to put down early cut hay with the\r\nflavor of June grass in it as an essential part of the winter rations\r\nfor first-class butter. We doubt if the bouquet of the June made article\r\ncan be found elsewhere. Another ration will be Indian meal, our great\r\nnational cereal, which is abundant and cheap and likely to continue so.\r\nThen we want green, succulent food with the dry fodder to sharpen the\r\nappetite and help the digestion. This suggests roots as another ration.\r\nWe have carrots, mangolds and sugar beets; all easily raised, and\r\ncheaply stored in barn cellars or pits. And from our own experience in\r\nusing them during several winters in connection with dry feed, we judge\r\nthem to be a safe ration in butter-making. Cabbage also is available,\r\nand in districts remote from large markets, might be grown for this\r\npurpose. Near cities it is probably worth more for human food than for\r\nfodder. The whole subject is yet in the tentative state, and all are\r\nlooking for further light!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHURNING TEMPERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the New England Homestead found difficulty in making\r\nthe butter \"come\" from cream raised in the Cooley Creamer. In a later\r\nissue several correspondents tried to help her through the difficulty.\r\nOne said:\r\n\r\nFirst of all be sure your cream is ready to come before you churn it. If\r\nyou have no floating thermometer, please get one right away. Deep set\r\ncream needs not only to be ripened, but the temperature must be\r\nright--not less than 62 degrees, and 65 degrees is better. Don't guess\r\nat it, but be sure. Mix each skimming with the others thoroughly, and\r\nkeep the cream pail in a warm place at all times.\r\n\r\nAnother said: Keep the cream at 60 degrees to 65 degrees all the time\r\nbefore it goes into the churn. Take care to thoroughly mix the different\r\nskimmings. Sometimes in cold weather the butter will nearly come, and\r\nthen hold on without any advance. In such cases, put into a thirty-quart\r\nchurning, half a cupful of salt and four quarts of water heated to 55\r\ndegrees; it will cut the butter from the buttermilk in five minutes. My\r\nbutter sells for fifty cents a pound and this is the way I manage.\r\n\r\nAnother: Sour your cream before churning and have it as near 62 degrees\r\nas you can, and you will have no trouble. The first fall we had the\r\nCooley we had one churning that would not come into butter. I found it\r\nwas perfectly sweet. Since then I have been particular to have it ripe\r\nand have had no trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEAS OF MILK.\r\n\r\n\r\nA newspaper correspondent contributes the following which is of course\r\nmade up of a mixture of facts and guesses. But as it is somewhere near\r\nthe truth, as a general thing, we do as all the rest of the papers are\r\ndoing, print it.\r\n\r\n\"There are nearly $2,000,250,000 invested in the dairying business in\r\nthis country,\" said an officer of the Erie Milk Producers' Association\r\nyesterday. \"That amount is almost double the money invested in banking\r\nand commercial industries, it is estimated that it requires 15,000,000\r\ncows to supply the demand for milk and its products in the United\r\nStates. To feed these cows 60,000,000 acres of land are under\r\ncultivation. The agricultural and dairy machinery and implements in use\r\nare worth over $200,000,000. The men employed in the business number\r\n700,000 and the horses nearly 1,000,000. The cows and horses consume\r\nannually 30,000,000 tons of hay, nearly 90,000,000 bushels of corn meal,\r\nabout the same amount of oat-meal, 275,000,000 bushels of oats,\r\n2,000,000 bushels of bran, and 30,000,000 bushels of corn, to say\r\nnothing of the brewery grains and questionable feed of various kinds\r\nthat is used to a great extent. It costs $400,000,000 to feed these cows\r\nand horses. The average price paid to the laborers necessary in the\r\ndairy business is probably $20 a month, amounting to $168,000,000 a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\"The average cow yields about 450 gallons of milk a year, giving a total\r\nproduct of 6,750,000,000 gallons. Twelve cents a gallon is a fair price\r\nto estimate the value of this milk at, a total return to the dairy\r\nfarmer of $810,000,000. Fifty per cent of the milk is made into cheese\r\nand butter. It takes twenty-seven pounds of milk to make one pound of\r\nbutter, and about ten pounds of milk to make one pound of cheese. There\r\nis the same amount of nutrition in three and one half pounds of milk\r\nthat there is in one pound of beef. A fat steer furnishes fifty per cent\r\nof boneless beef, but it would require about 24,000,000 steers, weighing\r\n1,500 pounds each, to produce the same amount of nutrition as the annual\r\nmilk product does.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETERINARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT SOUNDNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be supposed that the hackneyed term \"sound\" is so explicit as to\r\nneed no comment,--and most people conceive it to be so; but the term\r\n\"sound\" really admits of as much contrariety of opinion as the word\r\n\"tipsy;\" one man considers another so if, at ten at night, he is not\r\nprecisely as cool and collected as he was at one in the day. Another one\r\ncalls a man so when he lies on the floor and holds himself on by the\r\ncarpet. So,--as to soundness, some persons can not see that a horse is\r\nunsound, unless he works his flanks like the drone of a bagpipe, or\r\nblows and roars like a blacksmith's bellows; while some are so\r\nfastidious as to consider a horse as next to valueless because he may\r\nhave a corn that he never feels, or a thrush for which he is not, nor\r\nlikely to be, one dollar the worse.\r\n\r\nSo far as relates to such hypercritical deciders on soundness, we will\r\nventure to say that, if they brought us twenty reported horses in\r\nsuccession, we would find something in all of those produced that would\r\ninduce such persons to reject them, though, perhaps, not one among the\r\nlot had anything about him of material consequence. To say the least, we\r\nwill venture to assert that nine-tenths of the horses now in daily use\r\nare more or less unsound. We make no reservation as to the description\r\nof horse, his occupation, or what he may be worth. We scarcely ever had,\r\nindeed scarcely ever knew, a horse that had been used, and tried\r\nsufficiently to prove him a good one, that was in every particular\r\nunequivocally sound. We have no doubt that there are thousands of owners\r\nof horses who will at once say we are wrong in this assertion, and would\r\nbe ready to produce their own horses as undeniable proofs, whereby to\r\nback their opinion and refute ours. They may, perhaps, say that their\r\nhorses are never lame--perhaps not; that is, not lame in their\r\nestimation or to their eye; but we daily see horses that go to a certain\r\ndegree indubitably lame, while their owners conceive them to be as\r\nindubitably sound. These horses, perhaps, all do their work perfectly\r\nwell, are held as sound by owners, servants, acquaintances, and casual\r\nobservers; but a practical eye would detect an inequality in their\r\ngoing, as a watchmaker would do the same in the movement of a watch,\r\nthough we might look for a week, or listen for the same length of time,\r\nwithout being able to either see or hear the variation. The watch might,\r\nhowever, on the average keep fair time; but it would not be a perfect\r\none; and what matters, if it answers all the purposes for which we want\r\nit? A really bad watch that can not keep time is a different affair;--it\r\nis pretty much the same with a horse. If the unsoundness is such as to\r\nrender him unable to do his work, or even to do it unpleasantly to\r\nhimself or owner, or if it is likely to bring him to this, our advice is\r\nto have nothing to do with him. If, however, this is not the case, or\r\nlikely to be so,--if you like him--buy him.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that a man may say, I begin to believe that few\r\nhorses that have done work are quite sound; but a sound one I will have;\r\nI will, therefore, buy a four-year old, that has never done a day's\r\nwork. We will acknowledge that if he does so, he may probably get his\r\ndesideratum; but do not let him make too sure of this. There are such\r\nthings as four-year olds, unsound, as well as worked. But, supposing him\r\nto have got this sound animal; what has he got? An animal that he has to\r\nrun the risk of making useful, so far as teaching him his business goes;\r\nand by the time this is effectually done, and the colt has arrived at a\r\nserviceable age, he will probably be quite as unsound as many of those\r\nhe has rejected; independent of which, and supposing him to continue\r\nsound, the breeder of this horse must have better luck or better\r\njudgment in breeding than his neighbors, if more than one in five or six\r\nthat he does breed turn out desirable horses in every respect. If he\r\nturns out but a middling sort of beast, it is but small satisfaction to\r\nknow that he is sound; in fact, so little satisfaction should we feel,\r\nthat, if we were compelled to keep and use him, so far from rejoicing\r\nthat he was sound, we should only regret that he was not dead.\r\n\r\nIn relations to the doings of dealers in horses, it is not our present\r\nobject to expose the tricks of the trade, or to prejudice the\r\nunsophisticated buyer against all horse dealers. There are honest horse\r\ndealers, and there are dishonest ones; and we are sorry to say that, in\r\nnumbers, the latter predominate; that honesty in horse dealing is not\r\nproverbial. But horse dealers, like other mortals, are apt to err in\r\njudgment; and all their acts should not be set down as willful\r\nwrong-doings. However, be their acts what they may, the general verdict\r\nis against their motives. Therefore, supposing we could bring any person\r\nor number of persons to believe the fact that a man conversant with\r\nhorses might sell, as a sound horse, one that might, on proper\r\ninspection, be returned as unsound, all that we could say or write,\r\nwould never convince the majority of persons that a dealer could\r\ninnocently do the same thing. If his judgment errs, and leads him into\r\nerror as to the soundness of his horse, it is set down, not as willful\r\nor corrupt perjury as to oath, but most undoubtedly as to his word and\r\nhonesty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ANSWERED.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlanders, Chronic Catarrh, and \"Horse Distemper.\"--H.P.W., Peotone,\r\nIll.--Query--What are the symptoms whereby a person may know the\r\ndifference between glanders, catarrh, and ordinary horse distemper?\r\n\r\nReply--Among the prominent symptoms of glanders may be mentioned a\r\ndischarge of purulent matter from one or both nostrils; one or both\r\nglands on the inside of the lower jaw bones are more or less swollen,\r\nhard and knotty. One or both nostrils are sometimes swollen and glued up\r\nby a sticky, unhealthy looking pus, sometimes streaked with blood. On\r\nopening the nostrils, pustules and ulcers are seen on the inner surface.\r\nThe nose may sometimes bleed. The eyes are often prominent and watery;\r\nthe coat rough and staring if the horse is in lean condition; and the\r\nvoice more or less hoarse. The appetite is not often impaired. Sooner or\r\nlater, farcy buds may appear on the head, neck, body or limbs, generally\r\nalong the inner side of the thighs. In chronic nasal catarrh or\r\nso-called gleet, the glands between the jaw bones are very slightly, if\r\nat all, enlarged; they are loose, not hard and knotty, as in glanders.\r\nThis ailment, which is apt to persist for months, unless properly\r\ntreated, may leave an animal in an unthrifty state, with a staring coat,\r\ndisturbed appetite, dullness at work, cough and discharge from one or\r\nboth nostrils; but there are no pustules or ragged sores or ulcers\r\nwithin the nose, as in glanders. Chronic nasal gleet, however, is apt to\r\nrun into glanders; and, as there is no telling when the beginning is,\r\nsuch a horse, with chronic discharge from the nose, should always be\r\nlooked upon with suspicion, and be kept away from other horses. The\r\ndifference between glanders and influenza or ordinary horse distemper,\r\nis so marked that a mistake is not easily made. The more prominent\r\nsymptoms of distemper are as follows: With signs more or less prominent\r\nof a general febrile condition, there is great dullness and debility,\r\nfrequent and weak pulse, scanty discharge of high-colored urine,\r\ncostiveness, loss of appetite, and a yellow appearance of the membranes\r\nof the mouth and the eyes. The eyes appear more or less sunken, upper\r\nlid drooping and lips hanging, giving the animal a sleepy look; there is\r\ncough, soreness of the throat, and labored breathing; the mouth is\r\nfilled with frothy slime, the legs are cold and sometimes more or less\r\nswollen below the knees and hocks. In the advanced stages of distemper,\r\nthere is a free discharge from both nostrils.\r\n\r\nBrittle Hoofs.--I.F.C., Camden, Ill. If the animal is shod, the shoes\r\nshould be removed and reset at least once a month, to allow the feet to\r\nbe properly pared and trimmed. If habitually brittle, it will be proper\r\nto keep such feet off from much moisture, and instead provide dry floor\r\nof whatever kind. Once or twice a week such feet should be given an\r\nample coat of some simple hoof ointment, such as equal parts of tar,\r\ntallow and beeswax, carefully melted together, and stirred till cold.\r\n\r\nLung Disease in Swine.--A.J.T., Emery, Ill. Most internal diseases of\r\nswine, especially inflammation of the lungs, which is often given the\r\nwrong name of thumps, are very intractable and apt to prove fatal when\r\noccurring during the winter months. Prevention is the sheet anchor for\r\nthese troubles, and it must be a poor farmer indeed who can not manage\r\nto provide clean, comfortable and dry housing for his live stock during\r\nthis season, or who can not comprehend that such is necessary for the\r\nwell-doing of animals as well as of himself. Any animal, even a hog,\r\nwill of course suffer more, or less severely when constantly exposed to\r\nchilly winds, draft of cold air, wet ground and damp surroundings, icy\r\nor frozen drink or food, etc.\r\n\r\nBlindness After Lockjaw.--M.J.G., Los Angeles, Cal. Let the animal go\r\nloose in a comfortable, roomy, well-bedded shed, from which strong light\r\nis excluded. Apply, once daily, to the hollow space above the orbit of\r\nthe eyes, a small portion of fluid extract of belladonna. Give food\r\nwhich does not require much hard chewing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nREMEMBER _that $2.00 pays for_ THE PRAIRIE FARMER _one year, and the\r\nsubscriber gets a copy of_ THE PRAIRIE FARMER COUNTY MAP OF THE UNITED\r\nSTATES, FREE! _This is the most liberal offer ever made by any\r\nfirst-class weekly agricultural paper in this country._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHORTICULTURAL\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHorticulturists, Write for Your Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HEDGE QUESTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt one of the December meetings of the Massachusetts Horticultural\r\nSociety a prize essay from the pen of John J. Thomas, of Union Springs,\r\nN.Y., was read on the subject \"Hedge Plants and Hedges.\"\r\n\r\nThe subject of the essay was proposed in the form of a question, \"Are\r\nlive hedges to be recommended either for utility or ornament, and if\r\nthey are, what plants are most suitable?\" The answer to this question\r\nwas given from the experiments of the essayist during the last forty\r\nyears. The deciduous plants tried were the buckthorn, Osage orange,\r\nhoney-locust, privet and barberry. The evergreens were the Norway\r\nspruce, hemlock, and American arbor-vitae.\r\n\r\nThe buckthorn has the advantage of great hardiness, thick growth, and\r\neasy propagating and transplanting, and requires but a moderate amount\r\nof cutting back. But the growth is not stout enough to resist unruly\r\nanimals, unless in very rich soils, and even a moderate amount of\r\ncutting back is an objection to farmers.\r\n\r\nThe cost of buckthorn hedges, including the preparation of a strip of\r\nsoil five feet wide, purchase of plants, setting, and occasional horse\r\ncultivation on each side, was about twenty-five cents a rod the first\r\nyear. The yearly cultivation and cutting back, until the hedge had\r\nreached full size, was three or four cents a rod. Though the buckthorn\r\nhas nearly passed out of use on account of its inefficiency, it is not\r\nimpossible that it may be extensively planted when cultivators find that\r\nit may be converted into an efficient barrier by inclosing two or three\r\nbarbed wires extending its length through the interior--these wires,\r\nsupported on occasional posts, being successively placed in position as\r\nthe hedge increases in height, the branches growing around the wires and\r\nholding them immovably in position. Galvanized wire should be always\r\nused, on account of its durability.\r\n\r\nOsage orange hedges require more care than buckthorn, in assorting\r\nplants of equal size and vigor, and the rejection of feeble plants. Like\r\nall other hedge plants, they should be set in a single line, and eight\r\ninches apart is a suitable distance. For the first few years the ground\r\nmust be kept well cultivated. It is partly tender and will not endure\r\nthe winters at the North, unless on a well-drained soil. Hence the\r\nimportance of placing a good tile drain parallel to the hedge and within\r\na few feet of it. Thus protected, good hedges have stood for twenty-five\r\nyears where the thermometer has often shown ten or twelve degrees below\r\nzero, and sometimes lower.\r\n\r\nNo hedge is more commonly mismanaged than the Osage orange. It is\r\nplanted in imperfectly prepared ground; vigorous and feeble plants are\r\nplanted indiscriminately, cultivation and pruning are omitted or not\r\ndone thoroughly, resulting in broken and irregular lines. When more care\r\nis given, the hedge is nearly spoiled by being pruned too wide at the\r\ntop, the heavy shade above causing meagre growth and openings below. It\r\nshould be pruned in wedge shape, but shearing is objectionable as\r\ncausing a thick and short growth of leaves at the exterior, excluding\r\nlight from the inside and causing bare branches there. Cutting back more\r\nirregularly with a knife allows the growth of interior foliage, and\r\ngives more breadth to the hedge. The sheared hedge presents an unnatural\r\nstiffness in ornamental grounds; but skillfully cut back with the knife\r\nit has more of the beauty of natural form. The manner of pruning is very\r\nimportant, both as regards utility and beauty. For farm barriers hedges\r\ndo not require so elaborate care. Another mode of treatment has been\r\nadopted in the Western States. The trees are trimmed and the main stems\r\ntrained upright for a few years. They are then cut half off at the\r\nground and bent over at an angle of thirty degrees with the ground, a\r\ntree being left upright at distances of four or five feet, and the\r\ninclined ones interwoven among them, a straight line of trees being thus\r\nformed. The tops are then cut off about three feet high. New shoots\r\nspring up in abundance and form an impenetrable growth, as many as\r\nfifty having been counted from a single plant the first year. The top is\r\ncut to within a few inches each year of its previous height. Hedges made\r\nin this way have no gaps.\r\n\r\nA similar treatment may be adopted when a hedge becomes too high by long\r\nyears of growth. The trees are first partly trimmed with a light axe or\r\nhook with a long handle, and then half cut off at the ground and bent\r\nover. A new growth will spring up and form a new hedge. This course was\r\nadopted by the essayist with a hedge planted twenty-eight years ago, and\r\nwhich has been a perfect farm barrier for more than twenty years. The\r\ncost of this hedge was about twenty-five cents a rod the first year, and\r\nthe three subsequent cuttings for sixty rods cost about twenty dollars,\r\naveraging less than a dollar a year. But it was usually too tall and\r\nshaded, and occupied too much ground, to be recommended where land is\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nNinety rods of Osage orange hedge, properly trimmed, cost about the same\r\nfor the first four years of cultivation, but more for annual cutting\r\nback. It was planted twenty-four years ago, and has been a perfect\r\nbarrier for about twenty years. The yearly cost of pruning was about\r\nfour cents a rod for ten or twelve years, and since it has become larger\r\nand higher nearly double. For cutting back a stout hook with a handle\r\ntwo and a-half feet long or a stout scythe was used. Hedge shears are\r\ntoo slow except for ornamental hedges, and even for these the knife is\r\npreferable.\r\n\r\nThe Honey locust has been extensively used for hedges of late years on\r\naccount of its hardiness. Seed should be selected from the most thorny\r\ntrees. The trees have a tall, slender, and not hedgy growth, and require\r\nthorough cutting back to secure a thick mass of branches at the bottom,\r\nand very few have received this treatment when young. The care in\r\nplanting and rearing is similar to that required by the Osage orange.\r\n\r\nMany hedges have been injured or even destroyed by pruning after the\r\nsummer growth has commenced. The pruning must be done in spring before\r\nthe buds swell, if vigorous growth is to be preserved. But\r\nstrong-growing hedges, that are likely to become too high, may be\r\nchecked by summer pruning.\r\n\r\nThough the cost of planting and starting a hedge is less than that of\r\nbuilding a good board fence, they are not adapted to farmers who will\r\nnot give them the continued care required to keep them in good order.\r\nThis conclusion is justified by observing how few have succeeded with\r\nhedges, and many have allowed them to be ruined by neglect.\r\n\r\nThe evergreens which have been employed have been exclusively for\r\nornamental screens, and not for farm barriers. The Norway spruce may be\r\nplaced at the head on account of its rigid growth, hardiness, and the\r\nfreedom with which it may be cut back, it will bear more shade than many\r\nother evergreens, and hence the interior of the screen is green with\r\nfoliage. The cutting back should be done with a knife, and not with\r\nshears. Next to the Norway spruce is the hemlock, which excels the\r\nformer in its livelier green in winter, while it is unsurpassed for\r\nretaining interior foliage. It will bear cutting back to an almost\r\nunlimited extent in spring before growth commences. But it is not so\r\nstiff as the Norway spruce as a barrier. The American arbor-vitae, though\r\nmuch used, becomes destitute of foliage inside, and is browned by\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nBy the introduction of barbed wire an important change is likely to take\r\nplace in planting hedges. Barbed wire makes a cheaper fence for its\r\nefficiency than any other material. A serious objection to it is the\r\ndanger of animals being lacerated against it, the wires being nearly\r\ninvisible. This objection may be obviated by inclosing the wires in\r\nvisible hedges. Efficiency may also be thus imparted to small-growing\r\nhedge plants, such as privet, barberry and small evergreens, which will\r\nrequire but little labor in pruning and would become handsome ornaments.\r\nThe purple barberry, for example, would present an attractive appearance\r\nduring a large portion of the year. A new value may thus be given to\r\nhedges by rendering moderate growers and those easily kept in shape\r\nefficient barriers for farm and fruit gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUNG MEN WANTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the greatest needs of horticulture at the present day, is\r\nyoung men to engage in the work--intelligent, patient, energetic young\r\nmen, who will begin and make it a life-labor and study. What nobler\r\nemployment in which young men can engage? What field for study and\r\ninvestigation can be found for them which offers a more gratifying and\r\npleasant pursuit, and promises richer and more substantial results?\r\n\r\nThere are so many open questions connected with the science; so many\r\npoints that need investigation, so many problems to be solved; so much\r\nto learn that is yet unknown--that the needs for more laborers are great\r\nand pressing; and the wonder is that more of our young men are not\r\nentering upon the work.\r\n\r\nThat young men are needed, rather than the old or middle aged, is\r\nbecause many of the investigations to be undertaken require a lifetime\r\nto perfect, and can only be brought to a profitable issue in a long\r\nseries of years. Such, for instance, as the production of new varieties\r\nof fruits; the relative hardiness and longevity of trees; the effects of\r\nsoil and climate, heat, cold, etc., upon plant life; the degeneracy of\r\nspecies, etc.;--all of which require a long series of experiments to\r\ndetermine. Older men, here and there, are engaged in these\r\ninvestigations; but they are passing away in the midst of their work\r\nonly partially accomplished, and their labors are thus in a degree lost.\r\n\r\nOur farmers' sons--stout, healthy, energetic young men--are the ones\r\nupon whom this labor and high duty more properly devolves. To them\r\nbelongs, or should belong, the honor and glory of pushing forward this\r\nnoble work. Many of these, however, are mistakenly leaving the farms to\r\nengage in trade and speculation; while others who remain at home mostly\r\nincline to other branches. The agricultural colleges are doubtless\r\ndeveloping a few faithful workers for these too neglected fields; but\r\nthese munificently endowed institutions are believed to fall far short\r\nof their duty in this respect.\r\n\r\nI will close by recommending this matter to the thoughtful consideration\r\nof the young readers of THE PRAIRIE FARMER, who, as a class, I believe\r\nto be as capable and intelligent as the country affords, and with the\r\nremark that I know of no business in life to which I would sooner urge\r\nany young friend of my own to devote his talents and his energies.\r\n\r\n    T.G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSSIBILITIES IN IOWA CHERRY GROWING.\r\n\r\n\r\nProf. Budd, of Iowa, sends THE PRAIRIE FARMER the following copy of his\r\naddress before the Eastern Iowa Horticultural Society, remarking that\r\nits appearance in this paper may lead the Bloomington nurserymen to look\r\nup this very important line of propagation:\r\n\r\nThe topic assigned me is, as usual, experimental horticulture. I select\r\nthe division of the work implied in the heading for the reason that it\r\nis, as yet, mainly an unoccupied field of inquiry. If the idea occurs\r\nthat my treatment of the question is speculative rather than practical\r\npermit me to suggest that thought and investigation must always precede\r\nthe work of adapting fruits to a newly occupied country, especially if\r\nthat country is as peculiar in climate and soil as the great Northwest.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1882, I was fortunate in having a fine opportunity for\r\nstudying the varieties and races of cherries in Continental Europe. The\r\nfruit was ripening when we were in the valley of the Moselle in France,\r\nand as we went slowly northward and eastward it continued in season\r\nthrough Wirtemberg, the valleys and spurs of the Swabian Alps to Munich\r\nin Bavaria, through the passes of the Tyrol in Saltzburg to Austria,\r\nBohemia, Siberia, Poland, and Southwestern Russia. Still farther north\r\nof St. Petersburg and Moscow we met the cherries from Vladimir on every\r\ncorner, and our daily excursions to the country permitted the gathering\r\nof the perfectly ripened fruit from the trees.\r\n\r\nStill again when we passed six hundred miles east of Moscow we had\r\nopportunities for picking stray cherries of excellent quality from trees\r\nstanding near the 56th parallel of north latitude.\r\n\r\nTo undertake to tell of the varieties of the fruit and the relative\r\nhardiness of the trees--as estimated from the behavior of varieties we\r\nknew something of--of the many varieties and races we studied on this\r\nextended trip would make too long a story. On the plains of Silesia,\r\nnorth of the Carpathian mountains we first began to be intensely\r\ninterested in the cherry question. Here the cherry is the almost\r\nuniversal tree for planting along division lines and the public\r\nhighways. As far as the eye could reach over the plains when passing\r\nover the railways, the cherry tree indicated the location of the\r\nhighways and the division of estates. As we passed the highways running\r\nat right angles with the track we could get a glimpse down the avenues\r\nto a point on the plain where the lines seem to meet, and we were told\r\nthat unbroken lines along the highways were often found thirty to fifty\r\nmiles in length.\r\n\r\nAs a rule these street and division trees are of a race wholly unknown\r\nin this country excepting a few trees of the Ostheim in Iowa and\r\nMinnesota. They are classed in the books as Griottes with colored juice\r\nand long, slender, drooping branches. The trees are smaller than our\r\nEnglish Morello with low stems, and neat round tops. While some other\r\nraces are hardy on this plain as far north as Warsaw in Poland and\r\nRussia the Griottes are grown for three main reasons. (1) The trees are\r\ndeep rooted and so small in size that they do little shading of the\r\nstreet or cultivated fields. (2) They rarely fail to bear full crops as\r\nthe fruit buds are hardier and the fruit buds expand later than the\r\nKentish and the other and more upright forms of the Morello. (3) The\r\nfruit is less acid and richer in grape sugar than the Kentish forms\r\nmaking it more valuable for dessert, culinary use, and above all for\r\nmaking the celebrated \"Kirsch wasser\" which here takes the place of\r\nwine. Some of the thin twigged Griottes with dark skins and colored\r\njuice are as large in size as our Morello and nearly or quite as sweet.\r\nThat they will prove hardy and fruitful with us we can hardly doubt as\r\nthey grow on the dry plains of Northeast Europe where the Kentish forms\r\nutterly fail. Why have they not been introduced? I once asked this\r\nquestion of Mr. George Ellwanger, of Rochester, N.Y. He replied that in\r\nthe early days of their nursery some varieties of the Weichel type were\r\nintroduced in their collection. But the Eastern demand ran in the line\r\nof the Heart cherries and the Dukes, and if sour cherries were wanted\r\nfor pies the Kentish forms with uncolored juice seemed to be preferred.\r\nI suspect the difficulty of propagation and the inferior look of the\r\nlittle thin twigged trees in the nursery had something to do with the\r\nignorance of our people of the merits of this hardy and fruitful race.\r\nIn the trying climate of the Swabian Alps, the Tyrol, and the east plain\r\nof Silesia, Hungary, Poland, and South Russia, the trees are on their\r\nown roots mainly, and the sprouts are used for propagation. When small\r\nthey are placed in the nursery with the tops and roots cut back in the\r\nform of root-grafts. For the use of methodic growers and or planting on\r\nprivate grounds where sprouts are not wanted the trees are budded or\r\ninarched on Prunus Padus.\r\n\r\nHow will we propagate this valuable race of the cherry? The scions are\r\ntoo small for profitable grafting, and budding on our Morello seedlings\r\nhardly answers, as the slow-growing top favors sprouting from the root.\r\nPerhaps we shall find that our bird cherry (Prunus Pennsylvanica) is\r\nbest suited for our use. The question of propagation of this race is\r\nimportant, as the cherries grown in immense quantities in the Province\r\nof Vladimir, one hundred and fifty miles east of Moscow, and in all the\r\nprovinces of the upper Volga are of this thin twigged race. Beyond all\r\ndoubt it is the coming cherry for universal use in Central and Northern\r\nIowa, and even in Dakota and the far Northwest. Yet it is not the only\r\nrace of the cherry which will thrive on our prairies and prove\r\nlonger-lived, more fruitful, and far better in quality than any we now\r\nhave.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the grounds of the Pomological Institute, at Proskau, Silesia, we saw\r\nmany varieties of the Amarelle and Spanish cherries that will bear more\r\nsummer heat, an aridity of air, and a lower summer temperature than our\r\nRichmonds or English Morello. In leaf and habit of growth these Amarells\r\nof Austria and South Russia are much like our Carnalion, but some of the\r\nvarieties bear large fruit, as nearly sweet as is desirable for dessert\r\nuse. The race known as Spanish bears sweet fruit, much like our tall\r\ngrowing Hearts and Bigarreaus, but the leaves are smaller, firmer, and\r\nthicker, and the habit of the tree is nearly as low and spreading as\r\nthat of the Amarells. In Austria we are told that the original stock of\r\nthese round-topped, sweet cherries came from Spain, but as we went east\r\nto Orel, Veronish, and Saratov we met varieties of this race on the\r\ngrounds of amateurs and proprietors who told us that the race was\r\nindigenous to Bokara and other parts of Central Asia. While these\r\nvarieties are hardier than the Richmond the trees are lightly protected\r\nwith straw during the winter for protection of the fruit buds, when\r\npaying crops are secured. North of Orel the Griottes alone are grown on\r\nthe bush plan, with from three to six stems springing up from the crown.\r\nIn Vladimir tens of thousands of acres are covered with these bush\r\ncherry orchards, producing many train loads annually of fruit of\r\nsurprising excellence, considering the far northern and inland location\r\nof the plantations.\r\n\r\nOn the college farm we have some specimens growing of the Ostheim,\r\nVladimir, double Natte, and other forms of the Griottes, and a few\r\nspecimens from Orel and Veronish of the Amarells and the Spanish races.\r\nWe have now orders out, of which we have received a part, for perhaps\r\nfifty other varieties from Austria, Poland, and South Russia.\r\n\r\nFor the present these will be planted in experimental orchard with a\r\nview to noting their behavior in our climate. Until scions are grown\r\nhere we can not make much advance in propagation. The work is\r\nnecessarily slow, but it can not fail, I think, to finally demonstrate\r\nthat so far we have been on the wrong track in attempting to grow\r\ncherries on the prairies of the Northwest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRUNINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf turnips or other vegetables to be fed to stock become frosted, place\r\nthem in a cool cellar, cover lightly with straw, and let them remain\r\nfrozen. If they do not thaw they will be little harmed for feeding.\r\n\r\nSnow should not be allowed to accumulate on evergreens. If so, and it\r\npartly thaws and then freezes, it can not be removed, but will catch the\r\nsnow and wind, often to the entire destruction of the tree.\r\n\r\nA frost proof vegetable house is described as made with walls fifteen\r\ninches thick, double boarded, the space between the boards being filled\r\nwith sawdust. The ceiling is also boarded, with about ten inches of\r\nsawdust between the boards.\r\n\r\nNew England Homestead: The early black cranberry is the popular early\r\nberry on Cape Cod. It escapes the early frosts and so the crop produces\r\nbetter prices. A larger, lighter and longer berry is the James P.\r\nHowley, which is being introduced in Essex county. The latter variety is\r\nnot so early as the former, but bears well, and in the protected bogs\r\nalong shore is frequently preferred.\r\n\r\nNorthwest Farmer: Mr. Edison Gaylord, of Floyd county, Iowa, advocates\r\nsetting trees in a leaning posture, to prevent them from being killed by\r\nthe combined effects of the wind and sun on their southwest side. Prof.\r\nJ.L. Budd, of the Iowa Agricultural College, says, in confirmation of\r\nMr. Gaylord's view, he saw hundreds of the finer cherry and plum trees\r\nin Russia planted at an angle of forty-five degrees towards the one\r\no'clock sun. He says that only for a short time will trees thus set have\r\nan awkward appearance.\r\n\r\nThe most convenient boxes in which to start seeds and cuttings are those\r\nknown as \"flats\" among gardeners. A good size for the kitchen garden in\r\nwhich to start tomato seeds, etc., or for the ordinary conservatory, is\r\ntwo feet long, sixteen inches wide, and three inches deep. These shallow\r\nboxes are easy to handle, take up little room, and allow of much better\r\ndrainage to the young plants. Salt or soap boxes can be easily cut up\r\ninto three or four boxes three inches deep. Neat leather handles on each\r\nend of the box will increase its handiness. The bottom is better if made\r\nof several pieces of board, as the cracks insure good drainage.\r\n\r\nJames Vick's plan of catching slugs is as follows: \"Take some pieces of\r\nslate, or flat stones, or flat pieces of tin, and lay them about in the\r\ngarden among the plants, distributing them very liberally; just at\r\nsundown go out and place a teaspoonful of bran on each piece of slate or\r\ntin, and the slugs will soon become aware of it, and begin to gather and\r\nfeed on it. In about two hours, when it is dark, go out again with a\r\nlantern and a pail containing salt and water, and pick up each piece on\r\nwhich the slugs are found feeding, and throw slugs and bran into the\r\nbrine, where they instantly die. It is well, also, to go around in the\r\nmorning, and many slugs will be found hiding under the pieces of slate,\r\nand can be destroyed in the brine. By following up this method\r\npersistently for a few weeks the garden may be effectually rid of the\r\nnuisance.\"\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the Iowa Register advises us as to the proper manner\r\nof performing this operation: \"To heel trees in properly, a trench\r\nshould be dug on high, dry ground from two and a half to three feet\r\ndeep; one side of which should slope from the bottom at an angle of 35\r\nto 45 degrees. The trees should then be set against the sloping side of\r\nthe trench and sufficiently apart to allow of fine earth being brought\r\nin close contact with every part of every root. When the roots and\r\nbodies of the trees are carefully covered, the trench should not only be\r\nfilled but rounded up so as to form a mound over them. When air spaces\r\nare left among the roots they are liable to mould and rot. And very\r\nfrequently, when they have not been buried sufficiently deep, the\r\noutside bark becomes detached from them and will slip off when they are\r\nbeing taken from the trench.\"\r\n\r\nA correspondent of Gardening Illustrated (England), says this is the way\r\nto make an asparagus bed: Trench the soil at once two spits deep, and\r\nwork in stable manure as the work proceeds, or if procurable, seaweed\r\nand plenty of sand, or any gritty substance, such as road scrapings. It\r\nshould be left as rough as possible on the surface until April next,\r\nwhen the young plants will be in the best condition for planting, viz.,\r\nwith shoots a few inches long; then draw wide drills, and spread the\r\nroots of the plants out, covering with fine sandy soil, leaving the tips\r\nof the shoots just peeping through the soil, and if mild showery weather\r\nprevails the growth will be rapid. Put some pea-sticks to support the\r\ngrowth and keep it from suffering by wind waving. Merely keeping from\r\nweeds is all the other attention required until November, when the old\r\ntops may be cut off, and a dressing of rotten manure spread on the\r\nsurface of the bed, to be lightly forked in during the following spring.\r\n\r\nThe Rural New Yorker says as follows: We plant the Cuthbert raspberry\r\nfor late, the Hansel for early--both are of a bright red color, and\r\nsuitable for market as well as for home use. For a yellow plant the\r\nCaroline. It is hardy and productive, though not of the first quality.\r\nFor canning, or for table use, if you like a fruit full of raspberry\r\nflavor though a little tart, Shaffer's Colossal. It is rather dark in\r\ncolor for market, and perhaps a little soft. For a hardy, early, red\r\nraspberry that is sweet and delicious for home use, plant the Turner.\r\nFor a raspberry that is excellent in every way, plant the new Marlboro.\r\nFor the earliest and most productive of blackcaps, plant the Souhegan.\r\nFor a larger and later blackcap, plant the Gregg. For currants, plant\r\nthe Fay's Prolific for red, and the White Grape currant for white. For\r\ngrapes, plant the Lady for earliest white, Moore's Early and Worden for\r\nearly black. For later, plant the Victoria or Pocklington, for light\r\ncolored; the Vergennes, Jefferson. Brighton or Centennial for red, and\r\nthe Wilder, Herbert or Barry for black. For strawberries, try the\r\nCumberland Triumph, Charles Downing, Sharpless, Manchester (pistillate),\r\nDaniel Boone, James Vick, Mount Vernon, Hart's Minnesota, and Kentucky.\r\nYou can not select a better list for trial unless by experience you know\r\nalready what varieties will succeed best on your land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORICULTURE\r\n\r\nGleanings by an Old Florist.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPAGATING HOUSES AND OTHER THINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the days of our boyhood the propagating house was, in the more\r\npretentious nurseries, a very sacred place, under lock and key, and some\r\nof its mysteries supposed to be so profound that prying eyes of other\r\nestablishments were not welcome.\r\n\r\nBell glasses in those days were thought to be indispensable, and some of\r\nthe plants desired to be propagated were found to require months,\r\nsometimes nearly a year, before they could be transferred from the\r\ncutting pots. The hot-water tanks, and other bottom heat appliances of\r\nthe present day were then unknown; and these appliances have resulted in\r\ngreater simplicity of management. Still we are bound to admit that the\r\ndemands here generally embrace a class of plants that, as a rule, are\r\nfound to root the most readily, while those that have always been known\r\nto tax the propagator's skill, as the Heaths, New Holland, and others\r\ncalled hard wooded plants, are but little called for in this market.\r\n\r\nAt that time nearly everything was placed in pots of almost pure white\r\nsand, surrounded by the ordinary atmosphere of the house; while nowadays\r\nthe establishment must be small indeed if it does not contain some place\r\nwhere the bed is so arranged that the heat at the bottom is from ten to\r\nfifteen degrees above that of the house proper. Here lies the whole\r\nsecret as to whether it is a part of a single green-house or a house\r\ndevoted exclusively to propagating purposes. For the purpose of being\r\nable at all times to control the temperature of the top, the propagating\r\nhouse has often a northern exposure, except in the very dead of winter.\r\nWith a bright, clear sun above it is almost impossible in the daytime to\r\nkeep down the temperature of the house sufficiently to prevent the young\r\ncuttings from wilting, after which disaster is very likely to follow in\r\ntheir final rooting. Given a top temperature never above 55 or 65\r\ndegrees, with a bottom always from 10 to 15 degrees higher, if the\r\ncuttings are in good shape it is a simple matter to root them in from\r\nseven to fifteen days; though the time it takes depends, of course, upon\r\nthe plant and condition of the wood. At first efforts used to be\r\ncontrived to get this bottom heat by means of the old flue system, with\r\nplenty of material covering the bricks, to break, in part, the dry\r\nburning nature of the heat.\r\n\r\nThen hot water came in and furnished what was thought the acme of a\r\npropagator, and tanks of elaborate workmanship, and made of the finest\r\nmaterial down to the commonest wood, were made so a circulation of hot\r\nwater was kept up over as large an area as the necessity of the owner\r\nmight require.\r\n\r\nThe results seemed excellent, but lo, every now and again, disastrous\r\nfailures would occur. A material would spread all around called by the\r\nflorist the cutting bench fungus, that would sweep through his crop like\r\na plague; all sorts of theories would be given, and numberless articles\r\nappear in the horticultural periodicals of the day on its cause and\r\ncure. Presently it was found that those who did not use a tank of water,\r\nbut had inclosed a space to be heated by hot water pipes, did not seem\r\nto suffer so much from the invidious foe. Much moisture was found an\r\nexcellent remedy for the enemy, though it might have been its first\r\ncause, as it could be best warded off by dousing with the once praised\r\nhot water tank.\r\n\r\nWhether a house is used exclusively or not, the ordinary hot water pipes\r\nare simply inclosed in a brick or wood space, with ventilators that may\r\nbe opened to let off part of the confined heat into the house at\r\npleasure. The front benches used are about two feet six inches to three\r\nfeet in width, over, say four 4-inch pipes, up to within eighteen inches\r\nor two feet of the glass. On this is a platform over which three to six\r\ninches of sand is put, and in this bed are placed the cuttings where,\r\nwith the differences before mentioned, they are kept as uniform as\r\npossible, and the sand kept decidedly wet. Almost everything we called\r\nsoft wooded, or that can be got from the soft wood, even including most\r\nof our hardy shrubs, can be rooted with almost unerring certainty in the\r\nlarger establishments by the hundreds of thousands.\r\n\r\nAs modern ideas demand large propagating, even in the summer, when it is\r\nnext to impossible to keep these proportions of top and bottom heat, if\r\nin an ordinary propagating house, such firms as Miller & Hunt, strike\r\nout with another idea to overcome the difficulty. This is none other\r\nthan instead of glass, they have a muslin canvas-covered house, in which\r\nthey have again pits, where mild bottom heat can be obtained by the use\r\nof spent hops, tan bark, manure, or other material. Of course, it would\r\nbe idle to talk of a summer bottom heat of 60 deg., but instead of that,\r\nthey get one of about 80 deg., and depend upon a close, uniform, high,\r\nmoist temperature to carry out the same results.\r\n\r\nWith this, rose plants can be and are raised by the hundreds of\r\nthousands from the single eye to a cutting, with a loss of not five per\r\ncent in the aggregate, and often not one per cent. It is very evident\r\nthat with new or scarce plants this is an enormous average, as by its\r\nmeans firms can import the new European plants in the spring, at perhaps\r\nvery high rates, start them into immediate, rapid growth, and from half\r\na dozen plants to work on, maybe in the next spring markets have\r\nhundreds for sale.\r\n\r\nThis is all new as managed by us old 'uns in former times, but he who\r\nexpects to be up with the present day and cater for that class of\r\npatronage, must take the new and not the old way of doing things, or he\r\nwill, in the vernacular of the streets, \"get left.\"\r\n\r\nAs we are on this particular topic, however, and as the amateur window\r\nplant-grower may want to propagate some little stock as well, even if\r\nnot on these \"high-falutin\" ways, it might not be amiss to say that\r\nbeyond the methods of \"slipping\" here and there cuttings in and among\r\nothers growing in pots, or, mayhap, in a pot all by themselves, they can\r\nreadily root lots of plants in a water and sand bath, which is nothing\r\nmore than taking a deep saucer, putting half an inch of sand in the\r\nbottom, filling up the saucer full of water, and keeping it full; stick\r\nyour cuttings into this, place right in the sunniest spot of your\r\nwindow, and they will grow about as certain, many of them, as if treated\r\nby the florist's more portentious method. Likely the reason of all this\r\nis, the water keeps the cuttings from wilting long enough for them to\r\nput forth their efforts for existence in the shape of new roots,\r\nobtained from the stored up material in the cuttings, and as soon as\r\nthis is done they become new individual plants, requiring only to be\r\ntransferred into a suitable medium of earth to go on as an independent,\r\nbut similar existence to the plant from which they were obtained.\r\n\r\n    EDGAR SANDERS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOUR NEW CLUBBING LIST FOR 1884.\r\n\r\nTHE PRAIRIE FARMER IN CONNECTION WITH OTHER JOURNALS.\r\n\r\nWe offer more liberal terms than ever before to those who desire to\r\ntake, in connection with THE PRAIRIE FARMER, either of the following\r\nweekly or monthly periodicals.

It has kept pace with the progress and\r\ndevelopment of the country, holding its steady course through all these\r\nforty-three years, encouraging, counseling, and educating its thousands\r\nof readers. It has labored earnestly in the interest of all who are\r\nengaged in the rural industries of the country, and that it has labored\r\nsuccessfully is abundantly shown by the prominence and prestige it has\r\nachieved, and the hold it has upon the agricultural classes.\r\n\r\nIts managers are conscious from comparison with other journals of its\r\nclass, and from the uniform testimony of its readers, that it is\r\nforemost among the farm and home papers of the country. It will not be\r\npermitted to lose this proud position; we shall spare no efforts to\r\nmaintain its usefulness and make it indispensable to farmers,\r\nstock-raisers, feeders, dairymen, horticulturists, gardeners, and all\r\nothers engaged in rural pursuits. It will enter upon its forty-fourth\r\nyear under auspices, in every point of view, more encouraging than ever\r\nbefore in its history. Its mission has always been, and will continue to\r\nbe--\r\n\r\nTo discuss the most approved practices in all agricultural and\r\nhorticultural pursuits.\r\n\r\nTo set forth the merits of the best breeds of domestic animals, and to\r\nelucidate the principles of correct breeding and management.\r\n\r\nTo further the work of agricultural and horticultural organization.\r\n\r\nTo advocate industrial education in the correct sense of the term.\r\n\r\nTo lead the van in the great contest of the people against monopolies\r\nand the unjust encroachments of capital.\r\n\r\nTo discuss the events and questions of the day without fear or favor.\r\n\r\nTo provide information concerning the public domain, Western soil,\r\nclimate, water, railroads, schools, churches, and society.\r\n\r\nTo answer inquiries on all manner of subjects coming within its sphere.\r\n\r\nTo furnish the latest and most important industrial news at home and\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nTo give full and reliable crop, weather, and market reports.\r\n\r\nTo present the family with pure, choice, and interesting literature.\r\n\r\nTo amuse and instruct the young folks.\r\n\r\nTo gather and condense the general news of the day.\r\n\r\nTo be, in brief, an indispensable and unexceptionable farm and home\r\ncompanion for the people of the whole country.\r\n\r\nThe style and form of the paper are now exactly what they should be. The\r\npaper used is of superior quality. The type is bold and clear. The\r\nillustrations are superb. The departments are varied and carefully\r\narranged. The editorial force is large and capable. The list of\r\ncontributors is greatly increased, and embraces a stronger array of\r\ntalent than is employed on any similar paper in this country. We\r\nchallenge comparison with any agricultural journal in the land.\r\n\r\nTHE PRAIRIE FARMER is designed for all sections of the country. In\r\nentering upon the campaign of 1884, we urge all patrons and friends to\r\ncontinue their good works in extending the circulation of our paper. On\r\nour part we promise to leave nothing undone that it is possible for\r\nfaithful, earnest work--aided by money and every needed mechanical\r\nfacility--to do to make the paper in every respect still better than it\r\nhas ever been before.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSPECIAL NOTICE\r\n\r\nTo each Subscriber who will remit us $2 00 between now and February 1st,\r\n1884, we will mail a copy of THE PRAIRIE FARMER FOR ONE YEAR, AND ONE\r\nOF OUR NEW STANDARD TIME COMMERCIAL MAPS OF THE UNITED STATES AND\r\nCANADA--showing all the Counties, Railroads, and Principal Towns up to\r\ndate.

It is strong,\r\ndurable, steady, and it takes and uses all the wind there is going.\r\n\r\n\r\nHon. E.B. David, member of the Illinois State Board of Agriculture from\r\nMercer county, made a brief call at THE PRAIRIE FARMER office last week.\r\nFrom him we gathered the facts regarding the late meeting of the Board\r\nmentioned elsewhere. Mr. David has long been a staunch friend of THE\r\nPRAIRIE FARMER, and his call was a very welcome one.\r\n\r\n\r\nImmigration at the port of New York fell off last year to the amount of\r\n66,405 persons, or about 14-1/2 per cent from that of 1882. The total\r\nnumber landed this last year was 388,342. The greatest decrease was from\r\nSweden and Russia. From England came 30,818; Ireland, 52,555; Germany,\r\n164,036; Italy, 24,101; Norway, 11,536; Hungary, 11,448; Switzerland,\r\n9,447; Denmark, 7,770; Bohemia, 4,652. Last year the arrivals were\r\n182,893. It is not unlikely that there will be a greater falling off\r\nthis year for times are not sufficiently promising here to greatly\r\nstimulate emigration from Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crystal Palace Company, of London advertise the holding for six\r\nmonths, from April 3 next, of an \"exhibition of arts, manufactures, and\r\nscientific, agricultural, and industrial products,\" and invite the\r\nparticipation of American exhibitors. A court in a central position on\r\nthe main floor has been set aside for expected American contributions,\r\nand the ordinary charge for space is two shillings per square foot. This\r\nwill probably seem a trifle steep to American exhibitors who are not\r\naccustomed to pay for space in their own exposition buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\nLast year was not a very surprising one in the matter of railway\r\nextension within the limits of Illinois. The report of the Railway and\r\nWarehouse Commissioners will show that but 135 miles of track were laid.\r\nBut there are 10,456 miles of track in use in the State. The companies\r\namong these lines numbering sixty-four, operate 29,370 miles of road or\r\nnearly 20,000 miles outside of Illinois. The total net income of these\r\ncompanies was $81,720,256 and the dividends amounted to $36,374,474. In\r\n1882 the dividends amounted to but $29,000,000. The average freight\r\ncharges in 1883 were 1.09 cents per mile, while the year before they\r\naveraged 1.20 cents, hence it must follow that the amount of traffic\r\ngreatly increased over that of 1882.\r\n\r\n\r\nA lecture course for farmers at the Nebraska Agricultural College, will\r\nbe given from February 4-15, by the regular instructors in the college.\r\nOne or more lectures will be given on the following topics: Breeds of\r\ncattle and swine; breeding, improving, and care of stock; care of farm\r\nmachinery; health on the farm; adulteration of food; economical farming;\r\ntame grapes; ensilage; what to feed; meteorology and plant growth;\r\nsorghum-growth and manufacture; horticulture; principles of pruning; the\r\ndigestive organs of domestic animals; injurious insects. A number of\r\nleading farmers of the State have been invited to lecture upon their\r\nspecialties. All the facilities of illustration and study owned by the\r\ncollege will be at the disposal of the students attending the course.\r\nThese include several compound microscopes, a good agricultural\r\nlibrary, meteorological apparatus, six breeds of cattle and four of\r\nswine, orchard, nursery, arboretum, vineyard, etc., etc. A limited\r\nnumber will be boarded at the college farm for a price not to exceed\r\nthree dollars per week. Persons attending will be aided in securing\r\ncheap board in the city. Persons expecting to attend or desiring further\r\ninformation should write to S.R. Thompson, Dean Agricultural College,\r\nLincoln, Neb.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of our readers may wish to paste this item in their scrap books. It\r\ncost to run the United States Government last year the sum of\r\n$251,428,117, expended as follows: To supply deficiencies, $9,853,869;\r\nlegislative, executive, and judicial expenses, $20,332,908; sundry civil\r\nexpenses, $25,425,479; support of the army, $27,032,099; naval service,\r\n$14,903,559; Indian service, $5,219,604; rivers and harbors,\r\n$18,988,875; forts and fortifications, $375,000; military academy,\r\n$335,557; post-office department, $1,902,178; pensions, $116,000,000;\r\nconsular and diplomatic service, $1,256,655; agricultural department,\r\n$427,280; expenses District of Columbia, $3,496,060. The interest on the\r\npublic debt amounted to $59,160,131 and the amount of principal paid off\r\nwas $134,178,756. The receipts from internal revenue were $144,720,368,\r\nand from custom duties $214,706,496.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Minnesota State Horticultural Society will hold its seventeenth\r\nannual meeting at the College of Agriculture, Minneapolis, four days,\r\nbeginning with January 15th, and with the Minnesota State Forestry\r\nAssociation on the 18th. A cordial invitation is given to all persons\r\ninterested in horticulture and forestry to be present. A large number of\r\npapers and reports are to be read, followed by discussions. These\r\nreports are by persons who possess a thorough practical acquaintance\r\nwith the subjects presented, including such men as Peter M. Gideon, J.C.\r\nPlumb, Dr. T.H. Hoskins, Prof. C.W. Hall, Prof. J.L. Budd, Dr. F.B.\r\nHough, H.J. Joly, J.F. Williams, and others. A number of premiums are\r\noffered for apples, grapes, plants, and flowers, vegetables, seeds, and\r\nmiscellaneous objects. John S. Harris, of La Crescent, is President, and\r\nOliver Gibbs, Jr., of Lake City, is Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILLINOIS STATE BOARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Illinois State Board of Agriculture held a business session in\r\nSpringfield last week. All the members were present at one time or\r\nanother during the meeting. The premium list was revised for the fair of\r\n1884. The premiums for speed were somewhat increased over last year. In\r\ncattle sweepstakes classes it was decided that no animals can be allowed\r\nto compete except the winners of a first prize in other classes in which\r\nthey had been entered, except in the case of the grand sweepstakes, to\r\nwhich will be permitted animals not previously entered for any prize.\r\n\r\nThe Board is to make a laudable attempt to stimulate corn culture and to\r\nbenefit the corn growers of the State. It offers $100 for the best\r\nbushel (ears) of corn grown in each of the three grand divisions of the\r\nState, and a second prize of $50 for the next best sample in the three\r\ndivisions. The premium samples are to become the property of the Board,\r\nand the winners of prize premiums must deliver on cars directed to the\r\nagricultural rooms, Springfield, twenty-five bushels (ears) of same\r\nvariety that shall equal in merit the premium bushel. The winners of the\r\nsecond premiums must send the samples and fifteen bushels of same\r\nvariety and of equal quality. The premiums will not be paid until the\r\ncomparisons of the premium corn with the larger lots are made by a\r\ncommittee of the Board at its winter meeting in January next. The corn\r\nthus donated to the Board will be distributed to farmers throughout the\r\nState for planting in 1885.\r\n\r\nPremiums are to be offered for tools, implements and appurtenances used\r\nin the coal mining and handling industry of the State.\r\n\r\nPremiums for poultry have been increased, and an expert will be selected\r\nto do all the judging in the poultry department.\r\n\r\nThe chicken exhibit at the Fat Stock Show will not be continued.\r\n\r\nThe committee of dairymen appointed at the late meeting of the Illinois\r\nDairymen's Association did not present themselves at the State Board\r\nmeeting to confer about holding a dairy exhibit either at the State Fair\r\nor the Fat Stock Show, as instructed to do. No explanation of the\r\nfailure was made. The State Board, however, to leave nothing undone to\r\nestablish its desire to meet the dairymen half way or more, appointed a\r\ncommittee consisting of Messrs. David, Chester, and Griffith, to confer\r\nwith the DeKalb committee, in Chicago, at some convenient time to be\r\nagreed upon.\r\n\r\nIt was decided to hold the next Illinois State Fair at Chicago the week\r\nbeginning September 8th, and the Fat Stock Show at the Exposition\r\nBuilding, Chicago, beginning November 11th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSORGHUM AT WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nProf. Wiley, of the Department of Agriculture at Washington, will soon\r\nissue his report upon the sorghum business of 1883. Newspaper\r\ncorrespondents have been permitted to make a digest of the report. He\r\npronounces erroneous the prevalent impression that every farmer may\r\nbecome his own sugar-maker. Sorghum, unlike sugar beet, contains various\r\nnon-crystallizable sugars, the separation of which demands much skill\r\nand scientific knowledge. Sorghum-sugar will have to be made in large\r\nfactories. The existing factories have shown that it can be made, but\r\nhow profitably or unprofitably can not be stated by Prof. Wiley, who\r\nsuggests that farmers near factories may, in effect, make their own\r\nsugar by raising the cane and trading it at factories for sugar. Cane\r\ngiving sixty pounds of sugar per ton ought to bring the farmer\r\nthirty-five pounds, the rest of the sugar and molasses going to the\r\nmanufacturer to pay expenses and yield profit. The profitableness of\r\nmaking sugar from sorghum depends largely on utilizing all waste\r\nproducts. The scums and sediments make manure hardly inferior to guano.\r\nBagasse, or crushed cane, can be turned into manure by being thrown into\r\nhog-pens, as at Rio Grande, N.J., or it will make a fair quality of\r\nprinting paper. It is not economical to burn it. If the manufacture of\r\nsorghum-sugar is proved to be profitable, it will result in supplying to\r\na large extent our demand for sugar, but as sorghum makes a great deal\r\nmore molasses in proportion to sugar than sugar-cane does, the Professor\r\nconcludes that when there is enough sugar there will be a great deal\r\nmore molasses than can be disposed of.\r\n\r\nProf. Wiley has made experimentally some fair samples of rum and alcohol\r\nfrom sorghum molasses. Under favorable circumstances one gallon of\r\nmolasses weighing eleven pounds would give 2.75 pounds absolute alcohol,\r\n3.03 pounds of 90 per cent, and 5.5 whisky or rum. Thus each gallon of\r\nmolasses would give nearly half a gallon of commercial alcohol and two\r\nthirds of a gallon of whisky or rum. As it has been abundantly proved,\r\nhe says, that sugar can be made from sorghum, the Government should make\r\nno further experiments in this direction. Prof. Wiley has tried the\r\ndiffusion process, and finds it yields 20 per cent more sugar, but at a\r\nsomewhat higher cost than grinding. The Government, he thinks, should\r\npurchase machinery for large experiments in the diffusion process, and\r\nshould raise its cane somewhere else than near Washington, as land there\r\nis expensive and not adapted to the purpose. The Government should also\r\nmake arrangements with agricultural colleges or other agencies in\r\nvarious States for experimenting with sorghum-culture to determine what\r\nparts of the country are most favorable to the culture of\r\nsugar-producing plants. Prof. Wiley suggests in each State the trial of\r\ntwo acres divided into ten plots--five for sorghum, four for beets, and\r\none for corn--to test for purposes of comparison the general fertility\r\nof the soil and the character of the season. The Government ought to\r\ncarry on for a series of years the process of selection of sorghum seed\r\nin order to secure an improvement in the quality of the cane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLD SPELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cold weather of last week seems to have extended over nearly the\r\nentire North American Continent. Nothing for severity has been known to\r\nequal it during a long series of years. East, West, North, and South it\r\nwas all the same, differing in degree of course, but uniformly colder\r\nthan scarce ever known in the same latitude.\r\n\r\nThe greatest loss to stock so far as heard from was in that in transit\r\nto market. On some of the roads the losses were heavy. A dispatch from\r\nIndependence, Mo., says a train of fifteen cars, loaded with mules from\r\nTexas via the Iron Mountain and Southern road, arrived there on the 5th,\r\nwhen it was discovered that at least 100 of the mules had frozen to\r\ndeath, and the others were in a freezing condition. The mules were two\r\nyears old and direct from grass. They had been three days without food.\r\n\r\nMany trains arriving at Chicago had scores of frozen animals.\r\n\r\nNo great disaster is yet reported from the far West or from Minnesota\r\nand Dakota. Still there must have been great suffering not only among\r\nthe dumb brutes, but among human beings as well. It is fortunate that\r\npolar waves do not visit us more frequently.\r\n\r\nThe effect upon fruit, buds, trees, and shrubs is not yet ascertained.\r\nIt will be a marvel if many localities are not barren of fruit of nearly\r\nall kinds next year.\r\n\r\nTHE PRAIRIE FARMER will be very glad if its readers will favor it with\r\ntheir ideas and the results of their observations in regard to the\r\ndamage of all sorts done by the intense cold of the first week of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ANSWERED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Miller and F. Myrick, Peotone, Ill.--1. What are the laws in\r\nregard to drainage passed by the last Legislature? 2. Who is the Chief\r\nJustice of the Supreme Court and who his associates?\r\n\r\nAnswer--1. This is a question probably neither lawyers nor judges in\r\nIllinois are competent to answer. It you doubt it procure from the clerk\r\nof your County Court a copy of the public laws of 1883 and read the\r\nfifteen pages relating to drainage. 2. The Chief Justice of the United\r\nStates Supreme Court is M.R. Waite, and his associates are S.F. Miller,\r\nS.J. Field, J.P. Bradley, J.M. Harlan. W.B. Woods, S. Mathews, H. Gray,\r\nand S. Blatchford.\r\n\r\nSamuel Snodgrass, Meade Co., Ky.--1. I have some large, old, and\r\napparently healthy, apple trees, but they are comparatively barren. What\r\ncan I do for them? 2. I have others which appear to be going to decay\r\nand will soon die. Had I better anticipate their death by cutting them\r\ndown, or try to save them as I would like to do, for their associations\r\nwith the past.\r\n\r\nAnswer--1. We know no better course for you to take than to dig a deep\r\nditch all around the trees, say three feet wide and as many deep, and\r\njust within the outer reach of the limbs, and fill this in with half the\r\nearth removed and the other half made up of vegetable matter, ashes,\r\nroad dirt, and such manure from the barn and stable as you can spare.\r\nHaving done this make an arrangement about each tree that will retain\r\nall the rainfall which comes down to the earth beneath and collect as\r\nmuch more from the open spaces about as possible. 2. Your old and\r\ndecaying trees may be saved if decay has not gone too far. But the\r\nremedy is an heroic one, and rather expensive as you will find. First\r\ntreat the decaying trees as described for the healthy ones, with the\r\nexception you add a greater proportion of fertilizers and manure when\r\nyou fill in the ditch with half new material. Then (and all this work\r\nshould be done, as it can readily be done, in your latitude during the\r\ncold months when vegetation is at a stand) give the old trees a thorough\r\npruning, even going as far as to remove 90 per cent of all the leaf and\r\nfruit buds on the tree. Then wait for results, looking for nothing more\r\nthan a new growth of wood the first year, but fruitfulness thereafter\r\nand a new lease of life. But remember as in the first place, care must\r\nbe taken to supply abundant water, indeed as much more as the average\r\nrainfall, so much being absolutely necessary to afford the roots the\r\namount of manurial plant food, in solution, the new departure demands.\r\nEvery fruit-grower knows when a dwarf pear has borne a certain number of\r\ncrops, fruit buds cease to form and the tree becomes nearly barren. If\r\nat this stage the dwarf is deprived of every bud, whether fruit or leaf,\r\nand the limbs are left to resemble bare sticks, and at the same time the\r\nearth about the roots is fortified with wood ashes and well rotted\r\nmanure, a handsome growth of branches will be made the first year and a\r\ncrop of fruit result the second. This, the writer has tried with\r\nperfectly satisfactory results twice on the same dwarfs, and has others\r\nwhich, having been submitted to this course of treatment, in the fall of\r\n1882, made a handsome growth in 1883, and have set fruit buds for a good\r\ncrop in 1884. The life of an average apple tree in Illinois is scarcely\r\nmore than 35 or 40 years; but there is no doubt if, when they begin to\r\nshow signs of decrepitude or decay, they are treated as above, they may\r\nbe made to live and bear fruit for perhaps a hundred years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN ASH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are five well-known species of this genus (Fraxinus Americana),\r\nand they occupy an important place as valuable timber trees. This is\r\nespecially true of the white ash, more commonly called the American ash.\r\nOf this tree the late Arthur Bryant, Sr., said in his Book on Trees: \"It\r\nis one of the most valuable and worthy of culture for the quality of its\r\nwood and the rapidity of its growth. When full grown it is one of the\r\nlargest of the trees of our forests. * * * * The prairie soils of Iowa\r\nand Central and Northern Illinois are well adapted to the growth of the\r\nwhite ash.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAYSIDE NOTES.\r\n\r\nBY A MAN OF THE PRAIRIE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a strange and almost an unheard of thing for any one to say a good\r\nword for the \"tree peddler\" but I am going to say it if it breaks the\r\nheart of every horticultural baby in the land. Since a time to which the\r\nmemory of man runneth not back, the poor \"tree peddler\" has been abused\r\nand maligned by horticultural speakers and writers. In conventions he\r\nhas been ridiculed and denounced. Every cross-road nursery-man not\r\npossessed of stock sufficient to warrant a line of advertising even in\r\nhis local paper, nor business force enough to send an agent through his\r\nown neighborhood to take orders for trees, has spoken in a horticultural\r\nmeeting or written a letter to his favorite paper, warning the farmers\r\nagainst the wiles of the oily tongued fellow with colored fruit plates,\r\nspecimens of preserved fruits, and an order book for trees, shrubs, and\r\nvines. And I think I have known of some of the big fish in the nursery\r\nbusiness who with one end of their tongues have lashed some other big\r\nfish in the same business for employing irresponsible agents to sell\r\nstock for them, while with the other end they were commanding a small\r\narmy of the same class of agents to go forth into all the world and\r\npreach the gospel of tree planting and--sell trees. Others have sold and\r\ncontinue to sell trees to peddlers without limit, for cash, and of any\r\nand all varieties called for, while they denounced the system of\r\npeddling in unmeasured terms. Now it is just as possible for a tree\r\npeddler to be an honest man as it is for the man who grows trees to sell\r\nto be honest. I do not say that all men belonging to either class are\r\nhonest. It would be equally absurd to say that all of either class are\r\ndishonest. I despise the quack, the liar, the deceiver in any business,\r\nand I have no respect or love for the man who will sell worthless\r\nvarieties of trees or wrongly named varieties, knowingly. Honesty here\r\nas elsewhere is the best policy. But here is a fact, as I believe: It is\r\nbetter to plant an inferior tree than none at all, and I know of\r\nneighbors who would go down into their graves without ever planting a\r\ntree if some persuasive peddler had not talked it into them to do so,\r\nand these same neighbors now have quite respectable orchards. Here is\r\nanother fact: One half the orders sent to nursery-men by farmers during\r\nthe past twenty years have called for varieties utterly worthless for\r\nthe localities in which they were to be planted. And the tree peddler\r\noften gratifies the purchaser by pretending to sell to him a sort which\r\nhe has made up his mind to have because he knows it was good in his old\r\nhome a thousand miles away. But the peddler, not having this variety,\r\nand knowing that if he did have it it would prove worthless, substitutes\r\na Ben Davis or some other approved variety, and it goes into the ground\r\nand in due time produces an abundance of excellent fruit. In this case\r\nthe peddler does a really good thing. If nursery-men will stop\r\npropagating everything but varieties adapted to the country and the\r\nmarkets, and many of them are doing this, the tree peddler will be\r\npowerless for mischief--will in fact become a great public benefactor.\r\nBut so long as nursery-men will continue to grow and sell worthless\r\nvarieties, and so long as the people will remain in ignorance regarding\r\nadaptability, so long will the dishonest peddler remain an unmitigated\r\nnuisance and fraud. In brief these three things are wanted: Intelligent\r\nand honest nurserymen; orchard planters who either know what varieties\r\nare best for them to have, or who are willing to trust the selection to\r\nthe afore-mentioned intelligent and honest nursery-men; and third,\r\nfirst-class talkers, intelligent as to varieties and methods of culture,\r\nwho buy only of the intelligent and honest nursery-men, to go through\r\nthe country and sell trees. It is unfortunate that it takes so many\r\nwords to express what I wanted to say, but I am done at last.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have got it! Yes, all the ice I want is now white for the harvest in\r\nour \"artificial\" pond. It is the only thing that reconciles me to this\r\nfierce visit of polar weather. As soon as a trifle milder wave gets\r\nalong our way we shall carefully store away sufficient for the year's\r\nuse. By the way, where are the poor deluded woodchucks, muskrats, and\r\nOld Settlers, who told us we were to bask in mild etherialness all\r\nwinter long? I am disgusted this morning, with the mercury at 30 degrees\r\nbelow zero, and still going down, at the whole batch of them, and with\r\nVennor and Hazen, and all professionally weatherwise men and things. I\r\nhave heard of little real suffering in my neighborhood from the cold,\r\namong either humans or brutes. Doubtless, when the weather moderates\r\nand people get out to tell each other all about the cold spell, there\r\nwill be many true tales of intense suffering and more than the usual\r\nromancing about the terrible week. And then the Oldest Inhabitant will\r\nthaw out, and with all the self-satisfaction that superior age and\r\nexperience crown him with, will tell how much colder it was in such and\r\nsuch a year, until we wish this little spell had sealed his memory and\r\nmouth, for we do all take a great pride in living in a time that excels\r\nall other times, albeit, if it be only in a storm or a freeze. But in\r\nthese things the early times of the Old Settler can never be excelled,\r\nno matter in what century he flourishes. He is always master of the\r\nsituation. His experiences are like those of no other settler that ever\r\nlived and died. With him, imagination has gradually usurped the place of\r\nexperience and its isothermal dips and dodges carry him through hotter\r\nand through colder seasons than are marked down in any Standard Time\r\nPRAIRIE FARMER, or any other map or chart in existence. But for this\r\nweather business I should like to live next door to the Old Settler, for\r\nhe is generally truthful, good, kind, full of practical knowledge and\r\ncommon sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM CHAMPAIGN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are having some very sharp winter weather, and sleighing as\r\nuninterruptedly good since the 20th of December as I ever remember. This\r\nmorning, January 5th, the mercury reported 28 degrees below zero at 5:30\r\nA.M., and 20 degrees below at 10 o'clock. This is the coldest since\r\nJanuary 29th, 1873, when 36 degrees below was recorded at the Industrial\r\nUniversity here, and 42 degrees below by the spirit thermometer at one\r\nof the Jacksonville institutions. But the wind was west at that date,\r\nand it is so to-day, showing our coldest weather comes from that\r\ndirection rather than from the northwest or north. The explanation I\r\nsuppose to be, those great fountains of cold storage, the Colorado\r\nmountains, lie west and southwest of us, and are several hundred miles\r\nnearer than the lower peaks and ranges northwest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting and important truth to know at this time that an\r\nunexpected source for seed corn has been discovered here at home. It has\r\nbeen ascertained by experiment and investigation that the early frosted\r\ncorn, which has been allowed to stand in the field, has a sound germ,\r\nand though shrunken, will make fairly good seed, whereas corn which was\r\nnot frosted till late in October, and ripened in most respects, save\r\ndrying out, is wholly unfit for seed, having had the cells of the\r\nkernels ruptured by the freezings it has been subjected to. This rupture\r\nof cells the grain of the frosted corn escaped, having parted with the\r\nsurplus water of vegetation before hard weather set in. However, the\r\nearly frosted and shrunken cane fit for seed may be confined to this\r\ncounty or neighborhood, or a narrow area, and therefore I advise every\r\none who thinks of making use of it to ascertain for himself, by the\r\nusual methods, whether the germ is sound or not.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeveral parties have written me--one from Missouri, another from\r\nIndiana, and a third from Kentucky, that they have seed corn for sale,\r\ncheap and in quantity. I have no doubt of it, and I have accordingly\r\nadvised each to advertise it in THE PRAIRIE FARMER, if they are really\r\ndesirous of selling, stating briefly what variety, where grown, and at\r\nwhat price. I should be glad to advertise it for them gratuitously, but\r\nthe contract of THE PRAIRIE FARMER with its contributors contains a\r\nclause to the effect that \"they shall neither use its columns to grind\r\ntheir own axes nor the axes of anybody else.\" With the recourse of early\r\nfrosted corn to go to, and the assistance of appropriately selected seed\r\nfrom abroad, the gross mistakes and disappointments of 1883 are pretty\r\ncertain to be avoided in 1884.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo doubt many who are more or less familiar with the Reports on Hog\r\nCholera in the official publication of the Department of Agriculture,\r\nask themselves why Dr. Detmers is singled out by Frenchmen as the sole\r\nauthority on swine diseases, when his colleagues of the commission, Dr.\r\nSalmon and Laws went nearly as far as he did in their extravagant\r\nstatements. But the prominence Dr. Detmers has obtained in the\r\nestimation of Frenchmen is now explained in this: At a late sitting of\r\nthe French Academy of Sciences that eminent savant, Pasteur, referred to\r\nhim and his investigations in flattering terms. Giving an account of the\r\ndiscovery of the microbe which causes the rouget of swine in France,\r\nPasteur said: \"Respect for historic truth compels me to state, however,\r\nthat in the month of March, 1882, the microbe of the rouget was\r\ndiscovered at Chicago, in America, by Professor Detmers, in a series of\r\ninvestigations which did great honor to their author.\" With the\r\nindorsement of one of the most eminent scientists in the world, before a\r\nbody equally distinguished, Dr. Detmers may find some compensation in\r\nbeing singled out as the scape goat for an unfortunate commission which\r\nhas cost the country many millions.\r\n\r\n    B.F.J.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nREMEMBER _that $2.00 pays for_ THE PRAIRIE FARMER _one year, and the\r\nsubscriber gets a copy of_ THE PRAIRIE FARMER COUNTY MAP OF THE UNITED\r\nSTATES, FREE! _This is the most liberal offer ever made by any\r\nfirst-class weekly agricultural paper in this country._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOULTRY NOTES.\r\n\r\nPoultry-raisers. Write For Your Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DUCK FARM.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will not find it on the map because it is not mentioned there, and I\r\nshall not tell you where it is because I promised the little woman who\r\nowns it, and who gave me permission to tell other women what she had\r\ndone, that I would not mention her name or the name of the place where\r\nshe lives and works. How did I happen to find her? I didn't find her; it\r\njust happened--i.e., if anything ever happens in this queer old world of\r\nours. We bumped our heads together once in a railway accident, and we\r\nhave been firm friends ever since.\r\n\r\nHer farm is only a bit of land, some thirty acres, but for the last five\r\nyears she has made from ten to twelve hundred dollars a year from it,\r\nand most of the money came from the ducks. She sells eggs for hatching,\r\nand ducks for breeding and for exhibition, but the main object is ducks\r\nand feathers for market. She thinks ducks are less trouble and quite as\r\nprofitable as hens. She keeps twenty-four stock ducks, eight males and\r\nsixteen females, through the winter. The ducks commence laying from the\r\nmiddle of February to the first of March, and lay from 100 to 125 eggs\r\neach in a season. The first laid eggs are set to get ducks to sell for\r\nbreeding stock and for the early summer market. For this purpose the\r\neggs from the ducks that are two or three years old are used, and when\r\nhatched the ducklings from those eggs are marked by punching a small\r\nround hole in the web of the feet. She thinks, and rightly, too, that\r\nthe eggs from the older ducks procure larger and more vigorous birds\r\nthan the first eggs from the young ducks.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the weather gets warm enough to ship without danger of\r\nchilling on the way, she sells eggs for hatching at $3 per dozen, and\r\nfinds no difficulty in disposing of as many as she cares to spare at\r\nthat price. Her sales of eggs for hatching amount to about $100 yearly.\r\nBesides the eggs used and sold for hatching she generally sends a\r\ntwenty-four-dozen case to New York just before Easter. These large,\r\nfinely-shaped, pure white eggs sell readily for Easter eggs, and bring\r\nfrom forty to fifty cents per dozen.\r\n\r\nFrom the eggs set on her own place during the season she raises from ten\r\nto twelve hundred ducks each year. The ducklings are hatched from the\r\nfirst of April up to about the first of August. Most of the ducklings\r\nare raised by hen mothers, and she keeps some fifty hens for that\r\npurpose. The hens are all pure Buff Cochins, and are kept until they are\r\ntwo years and a half old. Besides raising two broods of ducks each\r\nseason, each hen pays her owner an average profit of seventy-five cents\r\na year from the sale of eggs for market. When fattened for market at the\r\nend of the second season, these Cochin hens are large and heavy, and the\r\ncarcass of the old fowl generally sells for enough to pay for a pullet\r\nto take her place. No chickens are raised on the farm; the pullets are\r\nbought of a neighbor who keeps the Buff Cochins.\r\n\r\nShe aims to set several hens and the incubator at the same time; when\r\nthe eggs hatch the incubator ducklings are divided up among the hens;\r\none hen will care for twenty ducklings until they are old enough to care\r\nfor themselves. The eggs hatch well--those in the incubator quite as\r\nwell as those under hens, and when the incubator ducklings are once\r\nmixed up with the others she finds it impossible to distinguish \"which\r\nfrom 'tother.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the ducklings are ten or twelve hours old they are moved with the\r\nmother hen to coops and safety runs, which are placed in an orchard near\r\nthe house. This orchard contains about four and a half acres, and the\r\ncoops are scattered over it a few rods apart. On the side of the orchard\r\nthat leads to the \"pond lot,\" the bottom board of the fence is a foot\r\nwide and comes close to the ground in order to keep the ducklings from\r\ntaking to the water too early in life.\r\n\r\nWhen the ducklings are four weeks old the hens are taken away, but the\r\nducklings are kept in the orchard until they are six weeks old, or until\r\nthey are well feathered on the breast and under part of their bodies,\r\nwhen they are turned into the pond lot, where they \"take to the water\r\nlike ducks.\"\r\n\r\nThe pond lot contains nearly thirteen acres, five of which are covered\r\nwith water. Originally, this lot was a piece of low, rocky, bushy\r\npasture land, between two low ranges of hills. A stream of clear,\r\nsparkling water, a famous trout brook, ran through the center. The woman\r\nwho proposed to raise ducks saw at once the advantage of such a\r\nsituation, and had a dam constructed near the upper end of the lot, and\r\nlater another was made lower down, so that the lot contained two large\r\nponds. Where the fences which separate my friend's land from that of her\r\nneighbor cross the stream, water-gates are put in, which keep the ducks\r\nfrom swimming out with the water; and the bottom boards of the fence\r\naround the rest of the lot keep them from getting out that way. Two\r\nwell-trained dogs guard this lot at night, and woe to the two-footed or\r\nfour-footed prowler who intrudes.\r\n\r\nThe duck houses are simply long, low sheds--with the exception of the\r\none where the breeding stock is wintered, which is inclosed--placed on\r\nthe slope a few rods back from the water. They were built of refuse\r\nlumber, and the cost was comparatively trifling. Connected with the\r\nhouse for the breeding-stock is a small yard where the ducks are shut in\r\nat night through the laying season. From the time when they are twelve\r\nhours old till within twenty-four hours of the time when they are killed\r\nfor market, the ducklings are well fed with a great variety of food.\r\nFrom the first meal until they are turned into the pond lot they are fed\r\nevery two hours between daylight and dark. \"Little and often,\" is the\r\nmotto. Before they take to the water the ducklings are fed a little\r\ncooked meat once each day, and doubtless this ration of meat has much to\r\ndo toward making the fine large ducks that my friend has a reputation\r\nfor raising. After they are turned into the pond lot the ducklings are\r\nfed but three times a day till within two or three weeks of the time\r\nwhen they are to be marketed; then they are confined in the fattening\r\nyards and fed oftener.\r\n\r\nThe fattening yards are situated between the two ponds, and so arranged\r\nas to inclose a portion of the stream.\r\n\r\nThe ducklings are marketed as fast as they reach a suitable age and\r\nsize. She commences sending them to market about the middle of June and\r\nkeeps it up till about the middle of September, when she quits till near\r\nthe middle of January. These prime young ducks, getting into market at a\r\ntime when such poultry is scarce, bring good prices--from 22 to 25 cents\r\na pound, dressed. By the time the price begins to decline she has\r\nmarketed all the earlier ones that she cares to spare, and the\r\nlater-hatched she keeps growing till mid-winter, when fine ducks are\r\nagain scarce and the price goes up. At Thanksgiving and during the\r\nholidays when the markets are crowded with poultry of all kinds, she\r\nholds on to her ducks, unless she has an order at an extra price.\r\n\r\nAt first my friend kept the Rouens; then she tried the Aylesburys, but\r\nnow she keeps only the pure Pekins, and is so well satisfied with them\r\nthat she has no desire to change for anything else. She says, \"For\r\nlaying qualities, quick growth, great size, fine flesh and fine\r\nfeathers, the Pekins can not be excelled.\"\r\n\r\nOn her place I have seen six-weeks old Pekins that weighed six pounds a\r\npair alive, and those that dressed from three to four pounds each at ten\r\nor twelve weeks. At five and six months her ducks dress from six to\r\neight pounds each. For the feathers, the best and finest of which are\r\ncarefully saved by themselves, my friend obtains forty cents per pound.\r\n\r\nAll the work connected with the duck-raising, except now and then some\r\nheavy work which is necessary in the pond lot, is now performed by my\r\nfriend and her three children, a boy of fifteen, and two girls of\r\nthirteen and eighteen.\r\n\r\nThere is a moral to this, but if you can't find it it will not do you\r\none bit of good.\r\n\r\nFANNY FIELD.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCONSUMPTION CURED.\r\n\r\nAn old physician, retired from practice, having had placed in his hands\r\nby an East India missionary the formula of a simple vegetable remedy for\r\nthe speedy and permanent cure of Consumption, Bronchitis, Catarrh,\r\nAsthma and all throat and Lung Affections, also a positive and radical\r\ncure for Nervous Debility and all Nervous Complaints, after having\r\ntested its wonderful curative powers in thousands of cases, has felt it\r\nhis duty to make it known to his suffering fellows.

Langstroth.\r\nAfter a careful perusal of the article named, in which the good and bad\r\ntraits of each race are delineated, any person ought to be able to\r\nchoose intelligently which bee is best, all things taken into\r\nconsideration, for him to procure.\r\n\r\nIn starting an apiary, there is another item of equal importance, and\r\nthat is what kind of dwellings should be erected for the occupants of\r\nthis future city. The wants of the future tenants should be considered;\r\nprovide them with all modern conveniences, as to pantry and larder, and\r\ndon't forget, as some architects do, that abodes should be ventilated as\r\nwell as warm. Some bee-masters prefer houses that are high between\r\nceilings, others low; some prefer large houses, many again those that\r\nare smaller. The size has to be made according to the frame chosen.\r\nThere are five different sizes of movable frames now in use among\r\nbee-keepers, and those are equally successful who use either size. The\r\nLangstroth is more in common use than any other. Some object to it,\r\nclaiming that it is too shallow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn looking at the plates of the five different sizes of frames, an idea\r\nis gained how minds differ. Each one has its advocates, and its votaries\r\nclaim that the frame they use is the very best for all purposes. We were\r\nonce looking out of the window of a friend's house on her neat,\r\nwell-kept apiary, and remarked what baby hives. And we found no fault\r\nwith the baby, when this lady showed us her beautiful white sections of\r\ncomb-honey, and ate her delicious peaches, canned, with extracted honey\r\nfor sweetening.\r\n\r\nIt must be fun to handle the little Gallup, but the Langstroth has an\r\nadvantage over all others; it consists in this: that it is most used,\r\nand if a person desires to sell his hives and frames, he can more\r\nreadily do so. It is also easily obtained, as it is kept in stock by\r\nsupply dealers, and can be quickly sent forward when ordered, but if it\r\nwas an off size wanted, a delay would occur; some change might have to\r\nbe made in the machinery, and it would cost more, as well as the delay\r\noccasioned, which, if in the midst of the honey harvest, might cause\r\ngreat loss.\r\n\r\nOther appliances of the apiary, to suit this frame, are kept by supply\r\ndealers; such as extractors, comb-baskets, uncapping cans, etc. With any\r\nof these frames a hive can be made large or small, by regulating the\r\nnumber of frames. If the hives are bottomless, as many make them, a tall\r\nhive can be made by tiering up, as is practiced by those who work for\r\nextracted honey. The Adair frame was formerly used in a hive called the\r\n\"New Idea, or Non-swarming Hive.\" Its non-swarming qualities consisted\r\nin its being a long hive, and if empty frames were always kept in front,\r\nso that the bees had to pass through empty space to reach the brood\r\nnest, they would not swarm.\r\n\r\nFrames should be placed in a hive an inch and one-half from center to\r\ncenter, and should have three-eighths of an inch space between them and\r\nthe hive. This last item was considered of enough importance to have a\r\npatent issued for it. If the distance from the top of the frames to the\r\nhoney board, or between the frames and the hive, is less than\r\nthree-eighths of an inch, the bees will propolis it together, and if it\r\nis more, they will build comb between.\r\n\r\n    MRS.

From what remote\r\nregion of antiquity may we suppose that this fancy came, that important\r\nevents to the world of man were heralded by marvelous phenomena of the\r\nheavens? To the ignorant man, there can never be any world outside of\r\nthat with which he is concerned. So the primitive man had no use for\r\nplanets, comets, and the like, that were not in some way concerned with\r\nhis destiny. And we no doubt own our magnificent modern science of\r\nastronomy to the quack system of astrology, which was only a device to\r\ninduce the heavenly bodies to minister to the importance and conceit of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThe accepted Scriptures tell us that the birth of the Savior of mankind\r\nwas heralded by the appearance of a remarkable star in the sky. Taking\r\nthis assertion to be true, it might be a matter of some interest to\r\nconsider what explanations have been made of this phenomenon. A large\r\nmajority of religious teachers, we admit, even to the present day, have\r\nattempted no explanation whatever, but have settled the subject by\r\ncalling the star a miraculous appearance, concerning whose true nature\r\nwe can know nothing. But two solutions of the phenomenon have been given\r\nby well-known astronomers, either of which, if accepted, will place the\r\nmiracle in the list of purely natural occurrences.\r\n\r\nKepler held that the Star of Bethlehem was simply a conjunction of the\r\nplanets. Astronomy, which, more fortunate than history, can bring\r\nunimpeachable witnesses to its record of past events, assures us that\r\nthere was a remarkable conjunction, or rather three conjunctions of the\r\nplanets Jupiter and Saturn, in the year of Rome 747, or seven years\r\nbefore the Christian era. It is now generally admitted that Christ was\r\nprobably born at least four years before the date fixed upon as the\r\nfirst \"year of our Lord,\" and remembering how much uncertainty hangs\r\nabout this date we might consider ourselves fully justified in placing\r\nit, as Kepler did, in the year 7 B.C. This being granted, let us see how\r\nthe occurrence of the conjunctions in this year explains the miracle of\r\nthe \"Star.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first place, note that the Magi, or Wise Men, of the East\r\n(presumably the country of Chaldea) were the first to call attention to\r\nthe star as indicating the birth of the \"King of the Jews.\" The\r\nChaldeans were devoted to astrology, and it is only reasonable to infer\r\nthat whatever remarkable appearance they saw in the sky, they would\r\nendeavor to explain it by their astrological laws. On the 29th of May, 7\r\nB.C., a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn occurred, in the 20th degree\r\nof the constellation Pisces, close to the first point of Aries; on the\r\n29th of September of the same year, another conjunction of these planets\r\ntook place, in the 16th degree of Pisces; and on the 5th of December, a\r\nthird, in the 15th degree of the same sign. (These are not conjectures\r\nor inferences, but known astronomical facts.) If we suppose that the\r\nMagi, intent on their study of the heavens, saw the first of these\r\nconjunctions, they actually saw it _in the East_, for on May 29, it\r\nwould rise three and one half hours before sunrise. It is not necessary\r\nto suppose that the planets approached near enough to each other to\r\nappear as one star, for they probably did not--it was their conjunctions\r\nthat gave their astrological significance. It plainly indicated to these\r\nobservers that some important event was impending, and what could be\r\nmore important than the birth of a great man? But where was this one to\r\nappear? The sign Pisces was the most significant one for the Jews, for\r\naccording to astrological legend, in the year 2865 A.M. a conjunction of\r\nJupiter and Saturn in this sign had heralded the birth of Moses; the\r\nproximity to Aries indicated that the hero foretold was of kingly\r\nlineage; the Jewish expectation of a great king had become a well-known\r\nstory in Chaldea during the captivity, ergo, the inference was prompt\r\nand sure, this conjunction indicated the birth of the expected King of\r\nthe Jews. That they might be among the first to do honor to so great a\r\npersonage as they believed this king to be, the wise men soon set out\r\nfor Judea. The journey probably took them five months or more. On their\r\nway they witnessed the second conjunction, which no doubt only\r\nstrengthened their faith. If they performed the journey from Jerusalem\r\nto Bethlehem at the time of the third conjunction, December 5, in the\r\nevening, as the narration implies, the stars would be some distance east\r\nof the meridian, and would seem to move from southeast to southwest, or\r\ntowards Bethlehem. Their standing over the house we may regard as an\r\nadditional statement that crept into the narration probably through its\r\nrepetitions.\r\n\r\nSuch is Kepler's explanation of the Star of Bethlehem. But before he had\r\ngiven this to the world, indeed while he was an infant in his cradle,\r\nTycho Brahe had connected the phenomenon with that of one of the great\r\nvariable stars of the solar system.\r\n\r\nThe latter astronomer discovered, in 1572, what appeared to be a new\r\nstar in the constellation, Cassiopeia. It was a star of the first\r\nmagnitude when first perceived, and daily it increased in brilliancy,\r\ntill it out-shone Sirius, equaled Venus in lustre, and could be\r\nperceived, even by the naked eye, at noonday. For nearly a month the\r\nstar shone; at first it had a white light, then a yellow, and finally it\r\nwas a bright red. Then it slowly faded, and in about sixteen months had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nAmidst all the conjecture concerning this remarkable appearance, some\r\nregarding it as a new world in process of creation, others as a sun on\r\nfire, Tycho Brahe held to the belief, though unable to prove it, that it\r\nwas a star with a regular period of light and of darkness, caused\r\npossibly by its nearness to, or distance from, the earth. When the\r\ntelescope was invented, forty years later, the accuracy of this theory\r\nwas known. At the spot carefully mapped out by Tycho Brahe, a telescopic\r\nstar was found, undoubtedly the same one whose brilliant appearance had\r\nso startled the world in 1572. Upon this, astronomers began to study the\r\nannals of their science for similar appearances, and found that a very\r\nbrilliant star had appeared and disappeared near the same spot in the\r\nheavens in 1264, and also in 945. The inference was that this star had a\r\nperiod of about three hundred years, and counting back, imagination\r\nmight place one of its periods of brilliancy very near the time of\r\nChrist's birth. For this reason it received the name of the Star of\r\nBethlehem, and many have fully accepted the theory which makes this\r\nvariable luminary identical with the \"Star of the East.\"\r\n\r\nThis second theory has especial interest just now, for if astronomical\r\ncalculations are correct, we may look for the reappearance of this\r\nremarkable star during the coming year. If it does fulfill the\r\nprediction of its return it must be reckoned as one of the most\r\nnoteworthy phenomena of the century.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of amateur observers, who are as likely as any to be the\r\nfirst to perceive this remarkable sight, we may say that Cassiopeia, the\r\nconstellation in which it will appear, lies very near the North Star.\r\nYou all know how to find the Polar Star by the pointers of the Great\r\nDipper; continue this line beyond about an equal distance, and you will\r\nstrike Caph, the largest star in Cassiopeia, or the Chair, so-called\r\nbecause the stars form the outline of an inverted chair. Near one of\r\nthese the wandering luminary will probably flash out, \"to amaze a\r\nwondering world.\"\r\n\r\nWe may remark, in conclusion, that though there are quite a number of\r\nvariable stars, their nature and the cause of their changes are but\r\nimperfectly understood. The Star of Bethlehem has no doubt an orbit,\r\nwhich brings it much nearer the earth at some times than others. But\r\nastronomers do not believe that the mere fact of distance explains all\r\nchanges. There is a star known as Mira, which for eleven months is\r\nwholly invisible to the naked eye, then flames forth as a star of the\r\nfirst magnitude, and is visible for a period of nearly three months,\r\nfading at its close into darkness again. The star Algol, in the\r\nconstellation Perseus, is usually of the second magnitude, but every two\r\nand a-half days it begins to decline in brilliancy, becomes very faint,\r\nand remains thus for about three hours, and then waxes bright again.\r\nPossibly this may be caused by the shadow of another star. In 1866 a\r\nstar of the eighth magnitude, in the Northern Crown, suddenly flamed up\r\ninto extraordinary brilliancy, remained thus for several months and\r\ngradually subsided. This star was examined with the spectrum, and showed\r\nlines of burning hydrogen. This led to the theory, now held, that the\r\nincrease in brilliancy of these stars is caused by the incandescence of\r\nthis gas. These fixed stars are all supposed to be suns of other\r\nsystems, and to be surrounded--like our sun--with envelopes of fiery\r\ngases; from some cause not at all understood these gases may, at\r\nregular periods, flame up with fiercer heat than usual, and produce this\r\nappearance of greatly increased light. This is a very inadequate\r\nexplanation, no doubt, but it is the best that astronomers have yet been\r\nable to devise in the matter.\r\n\r\n    A.C.C.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOUR BOOKS.\r\n\r\nBooks Free!\r\n\r\nGood books are valued by intelligent men and women more than silver and\r\ngold.

KIRKMAN'S BOOKS ON RAILROAD TOPICS.\r\n\r\nDO YOU WANT TO BECOME A RAILROAD MAN\r\n\r\nIF YOU DO, THE BOOKS DESCRIBED BELOW POINT THE WAY.\r\n\r\nThe most promising field for men of talent and ambition at the present\r\nday is the railroad service. The pay is large in many instances, while\r\nthe service is continuous and honorable. Most of our railroad men began\r\nlife on the farm. Of this class is the author of the accompanying books\r\ndescriptive of railway operations, who has been connected continuously\r\nwith railroads as a subordinate and officer for 27 years. He was brought\r\nup on a farm, and began railroading as a lad at $7 per month. He has\r\nwritten a number of standard books on various topics connected with the\r\norganization, construction, management and policy of railroads. These\r\nbooks are of interest not only to railroad men but to the general reader\r\nas well. They are indispensable to the student. They present every phase\r\nof railroad life, and are written in an easy and simple style that both\r\ninterests and instructs. The books are as follows:\r\n\r\n\"RAILWAY EXPENDITURES--THEIR EXTENT,\r\nOBJECT AND ECONOMY.\"--A Practical\r\nTreatise on Construction and Operation.\r\nIn Two Volumes, 850 pages.                         $4.00\r\n\r\n\"HAND BOOK OF RAILWAY EXPENDITURES.\"--Practical\r\nDirections for Keeping\r\nthe Expenditure Accounts.                           2.00\r\n\r\n\"RAILWAY REVENUE AND ITS COLLECTION.\"--And\r\nExplaining the Organization of\r\nRailroads.                                          2.50\r\n\r\n\"THE BAGGAGE PARCEL AND MAIL TRAFFIC\r\nOF RAILROADS.\"--An interesting work\r\non this important service; 425 pages.               2.00\r\n\r\n\"TRAIN AND STATION SERVICE\"--Giving\r\nThe Principal Rules and Regulations governing\r\nTrains; 280 pages.                                  2.00\r\n\r\n\"THE TRACK ACCOUNTS OF RAILROADS.\"--And\r\nhow they should be kept.

Whittier in St. Nicholas._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER TWENTY YEARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following tale of love and faithful waiting is told the New York\r\nWorld by its Canton, Ohio, correspondent:\r\n\r\nAt the residence of Thomas Barker, three miles from this village, two\r\npeople were to-day made man and wife. William Craig left his pretty girl\r\nsweetheart in a fit of jealous anger on the eve of Dec. 9, 1863,\r\nreturned a week or two since, found his betrothed still single and true,\r\nand this afternoon the long deferred marriage was consummated. All the\r\nsurviving friends of their youth were present, and many half forgotten\r\nassociates came from neighboring towns and farms to join in the\r\nmerrymaking.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago Will Craig worked on his father's farm near here during\r\nthe day and spent his evenings at the residence of a farmer neighbor.\r\nThe attraction was Mary Barker, a pretty seventeen-year old girl. Craig\r\nwas deeply in love and so was Mary, but like many other girls she liked\r\nto play the coquette occasionally.\r\n\r\nTheir wedding-day was set for Christmas, 1863, and the prospective bride\r\nfelt secure. One evening, however, the pretty Mary pushed her coquetry\r\ntoo far. On December 7, 1863, Farmer Barker gave an old-fashioned\r\n\"sociable\" in honor of his daughter's approaching wedding. Craig was\r\nthere, of course, but his happiness was marred by the presence of a\r\nPittsburg youth--a new comer. Mary allowed this young man to pay her\r\nmany attentions.\r\n\r\nCraig was madly jealous. After all his attention he thought his\r\nbetrothed showed too much regard for his rival, and as she only laughed\r\nat his pleadings he grew angry and threatened to leave. Her seeming\r\nindifference made him desperate, and he declared:\r\n\r\n\"If you dance once more with that fellow you will not see me again for\r\ntwenty years.\"\r\n\r\n\"You couldn't leave me for even twenty hours if you tried ever so hard,\"\r\nshe replied, and with a coquettish smile she went off to dance with his\r\nrival.\r\n\r\nCraig went home alone that night and the next day was missing. The most\r\ncareful search failed to reveal any trace of him. The old couple\r\ncontinued to till the farm without the aid of the strong-armed son, and\r\nat the neighbor's down the road pretty Mary Barker went about her\r\nhousehold labors with a demure air that told plainly how she regarded\r\nher lover's disappearance. She refused to \"keep company\" in the\r\nold-fashioned way with any of the young farmers who would willingly have\r\ntaken young Craig's place. She went out very little, kept a cat and grew\r\ndomestic in her habits. She had an abiding faith that Craig would\r\nreturn, and to all entreaties would only shake her head and say: \"I am\r\nwaiting for Will.\" The firm contour of the cheek grew somewhat less\r\nrounded, the springing step less elastic, but she would not think of\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nFriday, December 7, of this month (December) was just twenty years since\r\nthe disappearance of William Craig. In the twilight a bearded man of\r\nforty came up the walk and as Miss Barker opened the door he put out\r\nboth hands and said:\r\n\r\n\"Mary, I have come again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry you waited so long Will,\" was the quiet reply, as she led\r\nhim into the house, where each told the story of the weary waiting, and\r\nChristmas was fixed upon once more as the day for the wedding.\r\n\r\nTo the eager questions of old friends as to where he spent the time, he\r\ntold them, as he had already told his wife, how he had at once gone to\r\nPhiladelphia, enlisted in the army under an assumed name, then, after\r\nthe war, gone to Nebraska and taken up a tract of valuable land. This he\r\nhad diligently cultivated until at present he is in more than\r\ncomfortable circumstances. The Craigs will leave early in January for\r\ntheir Nebraska home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILL READERS TRY IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other day, says an exchange, we came across the following recipe for\r\nmaking ink in an English archaeological journal. Archaeology is the\r\n\"science of antiquities,\" and surely this recipe is old enough to be\r\ngood. It occurred to us that during the summer vacation many of our boys\r\nwho are longing for something to do, might earn some money by\r\nmanufacturing some of this ink and selling it in their neighborhood. At\r\nany rate the recipe is a good one and worthy of a trial by old folks as\r\nwell as young people. Here is the recipe, and the way it was discovered,\r\nas told by a writer in Notes and Queries:\r\n\r\nWhile examining a large number of MSS. of an old scribe some twenty\r\nyears ago, I was struck with the clearness and legibility of the\r\nwriting, owing in a great measure to the permanent quality of the ink,\r\nwhich had not faded in the least, although many of the MSS. were at\r\nleast two hundred years old. It was remarkable, that the writer must\r\nhave been celebrated in his day for the excellence of his calligraphy,\r\nfor I met with a letter or two from his correspondents in which there\r\nwas a request for the recipe of the ink he used. I found his recipes,\r\nwhich I copied, and from one of them, dated in 1654, I have, during the\r\nlast fifteen years, made all the ink I have used. The recipe is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nRain water, one pint; galls, bruised, one and one-half ounces; green\r\ncopperas, six drachms; gum Arabic, ten drachms. The galls must be\r\ncoarsely powdered and put in a bottle, and the other ingredients and\r\nwater added. The bottle securely stoppered, is placed in the light (sun\r\nif possible), and its contents are stirred occasionally until the gum\r\nand copperas is dissolved; after which it is enough to shake the bottle\r\ndaily, and in the course of a month or six weeks it will be fit for use.\r\nI have ventured to add ten drops of carbolic acid to the contents of the\r\nbottle, as it effectually prevents the formation and growth of mold,\r\nwithout any detriment to the quality of the ink, so far as I know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECRET OF LONGEVITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nA French medical man who has just died at the age of one hundred and\r\nseven, pledged his word to reveal the secret of his longevity, when no\r\nmore, for the benefit of others. It was stipulated, however, that the\r\nprecious envelope containing the recipe for long life was not to be\r\nopened until he had been buried. The doctor's prescription, now made\r\nknown, is simple enough; and easy to follow; but whether it is as\r\navailable as he pretends, the Journal of Chemistry says, is extremely\r\ndoubtful. He tells his fellow-men, that, if they wish to live for a\r\ncentury or more, they have but to pay attention to the position of their\r\nbeds. \"Let the head of the bed be placed to the north, the foot to the\r\nsouth; and the electric current, which is stronger during the night in\r\nthe direction of the north, will work wonders on their constitutions,\r\ninsure them healthier rest, strengthen their nervous system, and prolong\r\ntheir days.\" It is, he adds, to scrupulous attention to the position of\r\nhis bed that he ascribes his longevity, the enjoyment of perfect health,\r\nand the absence of infirmity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE INVENTOR PLAGUES HIS WIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA facetious chap connected with one of our daily newspapers gave the\r\nfollowing amusing burlesque on the trials of an inventor's wife:\r\n\r\n\"It is all very well to talk about working for the heathen,\" said one,\r\nas the ladies put up their sewing, \"but I'd like to have some one tell\r\nme what I am to do with my husband.\" \"What is the matter with him?\"\r\nasked a sympathetic old lady. \"William is a good man,\" continued the\r\nfirst, waving her glasses in an argumentative way, \"but William will\r\ninvent. He goes inventing round from morning till night, and I have no\r\npeace or comfort. I didn't object when he invented a fire escape, but I\r\ndid remonstrate when he wanted me to crawl out of the window one night\r\nlast winter to see how it worked. Then he originated a lock for the door\r\nthat would not open from midnight until morning, so as to keep burglars\r\nout. The first time he tried it he caught his coat tail in it, and I had\r\nto walk around him with a pan of hot coals all night to keep him from\r\nfreezing.\" \"Why didn't he take his coat off?\" \"I wanted him to, but he\r\nstood around till the thing opened itself, trying to invent some way of\r\nunfastening it. That's William's trouble. He will invent. A little while\r\nago he got up a cabinet bedstead that would shut and open without\r\nhandling. It went by clockwork. William got into it, and up it went.\r\nBless your heart, he staid in there from Saturday afternoon till Sunday\r\nnight, when it flew open and disclosed William with the plans and\r\nspecifications of a patent washbowl that would tip over just when it got\r\nso full. The result was that I lost all my rings and breastpin down the\r\nwaste pipe. Then he got up a crutch for a man that could also be used as\r\nan opera-glass. Whenever the man leaned on it up it went, and when he\r\nput it to his eye to find William, it flew out into a crutch and almost\r\nbroke the top of his head off. Once he invented a rope ladder to be worn\r\nas guard chain and lengthened out with a spring. He put it round his\r\nneck, but the spring got loose and turned it into a ladder and almost\r\nchoked him to death. Then he invented a patent boot heel to crack nuts\r\nwith, but he mashed his thumb with it and gave it up. Why, he has a\r\nwashtub full of inventions. One of them is a prayerbook that always\r\nopens at the right place. We tried it one morning at church, but the\r\nwheels and springs made such a noise that the sexton took William by the\r\ncollar and told him to leave his fire engines at home when he came to\r\nworship. The other day I saw him going up the street with a model of a\r\ngrain elevator sticking out of his hip pocket, and he is fixing up an\r\nimproved shot tower in our bed-room.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES.\r\n\r\nA hot shovel held over furniture removes white spots.\r\n\r\nA paste of equal parts of sifted ashes, clay, salt, and a little water\r\ncements cracks in stoves and ovens.\r\n\r\nFried potatoes: Chop fine cold boiled potatoes; heat some butter in a\r\nfrying pan and put the potatoes in.

Put a little salt with it. This may be given, as\r\nthe sick one prefers, cold or hot, or it may be frozen, and given in\r\nsmall lumps.\r\n\r\nRolls: Flour, two quarts; sugar, one tablespoonful; one half cup of\r\nyeast; one pint of scalded milk, or water if milk is scarce, and a\r\nlittle salt.

Stick the peg in the apple and you have a\r\nvery fair representation of a candle. The wick you can light, and it\r\nwill burn for at least a minute. In performing you should have your\r\ncandle in a clean candlestick, show it plainly to the audience, and then\r\nput it into your mouth, taking care to blow it out, and munch it up. If\r\nyou think best, you can blow the candle out and allow the wick to cool,\r\nand it will look, with its burned wick, so natural that even the\r\nsharpest eyes can not distinguish it from the genuine article.\r\n\r\nOnce, at a summer resort in Massachusetts, I made use of this candle\r\nwith considerable effect. While performing a few parlor tricks to amuse\r\nsome friends, I pretended to need a light. A confederate left the room,\r\nand soon returned with a lantern containing one of these apple\r\ncounterfeits.\r\n\r\n\"Do you call that a candle?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"Why, there is scarcely a mouthful.\"\r\n\r\n\"A mouthful? Rather a disagreeable mouthful, I guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have never been in Russia, I presume.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you don't know what is good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, good. Why, candle ends, with the wick a little burned to give them\r\na flavor, are delicious. They always serve them up before dinner in\r\nRussia as a kind of relish. It is considered bad taste in good society\r\nthere to ask a friend to sit down to dinner without offering him this\r\nappetizer.\"\r\n\r\n\"The bad taste would be in the relish, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. Try a bit.\"\r\n\r\nI took the candle out of the lantern, and extended it toward my\r\nconfederate, who shrank back with disgust.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I said, \"if you won't have it, I'll eat it myself.\" And so\r\nsaying, I put it into my mouth and munched it up, amid the cries of\r\nsurprise and horror of the assembled party. Two old maids insisted on\r\nlooking into my mouth to see whether it was not concealed there.\r\n\r\nHaving soaked a piece of thread in common salt water, tie it to a small\r\nfinger-ring. When you apply the flame of a candle to the thread it will\r\nburn to ashes and yet sustain the ring.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DIFFICULT CIRCLE TO JUMP FROM.\r\n\r\nTake a piece of chalk, and ask, if you make a circle, whether any boy\r\nstanding in it thinks he can jump out of it. As soon as one proposes to\r\ndo so, bring him into the center of the room, draw a circle with the\r\nchalk around his jacket, and say, \"Now jump out of it!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAN IMPOSSIBLE WALK.\r\n\r\nAsk one young lady in the company whether she thinks, if she clasped her\r\nhands, she could walk out of the room. On her saying she could, request\r\nher to pass her arm round the leg of the table or piano, join her hands,\r\nand walk away.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HAT TRICK.\r\n\r\nFill a small glass with water, cover it with a hat, and profess your\r\nreadiness to drink it without touching the hat. Put your head under the\r\ntable, make a noise, as if drinking, rise, and wipe your lips. The\r\ncompany, thinking you have drunk the water, one of them will certainly\r\ntake up the hat to see. As soon as the hat is removed, take up the glass\r\nand drink its contents. \"There!\" say you, \"you see I have not touched\r\nthe hat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INCOMBUSTIBLE THREAD.\r\n\r\nWind some linen thread tightly round a smooth pebble, and secure the\r\nend; then, if you expose it to the flame of a lamp or candle, the thread\r\nwill not burn; for the caloric (or heat) traverses the thread, without\r\nremaining in it, and attacks the stone. The same sort of trick may be\r\nperformed with a poker, round which is evenly pasted a sheet of paper.\r\nYou can poke the fire with it without burning the paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN IMPOSSIBLE JUMP.\r\n\r\nTake a ruler, or any other piece of wood, and ask whether, if you laid\r\nit down on the ground, any of the company could jump over it. Of course\r\none or two will express their readiness to jump over so small an\r\nobstruction. Then lay the ruler on the ground, close against the wall,\r\nand tell them to try.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DIFFICULT LOAD TO CARRY.\r\n\r\nTake a piece of wood, such as a lucifer match, and say to one of the\r\ncompany, \"How long do you think it would take you to carry this piece of\r\nwood into the next room?\" \"Half a minute.\" perhaps one will reply.\r\n\"Well, try, then,\" say you; \"carry it.\" You then cut off little pieces,\r\nand give them to him one by one. He will soon be tired of the\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO TURN A GLASS OF WATER UPSIDE DOWN WITHOUT SPILLING ITS CONTENTS.\r\n\r\nFill a glass carefully, place a piece of paper on the top, place your\r\nhand on the paper, and tilt the glass round sharply, when it will be\r\nfound that the pressure of the air upward on the paper will retain the\r\nwater. The glass may then be held by the bottom.\r\n\r\nHealth and Home says: I want to tell you of something very funny to do,\r\nif you have a little brother or sister who does not mind dressing up and\r\nstanding still for a few moments. My aunt showed me how to do it the\r\nother day, when sister Nelly had a birthday party. We took little\r\nbrother Tommy out into the library and stood him upon a high wooden\r\nstool, and dressed him up very finely in mamma's clothes. The stool made\r\nhim so full that the dress was of just the right length. Then Uncle Ned,\r\ntelling him to stand straight and firm, carried him, stool and all, into\r\nthe parlor. I wish you could have heard the girls and boys laugh! He had\r\nsuch a comical look--with his tall body and little round face--just like\r\nsome of those French Parian figures. One little girl handed him a fan,\r\nand then it was too funny to see the tall lady fan herself affectedly\r\nwith her very small, dimpled hands.

Few people are free from the distressing evils\r\nwhich hypochondria brings. They come at all times and are fed by the\r\nvery flame which they themselves start. They are a dread of coming\r\nderangement caused by present disorder and bring about more suicides\r\nthan any other one thing. Their first approach should be carefully\r\nguarded.\r\n\r\n_Editors Herald_:\r\n\r\n    It is seldom I appear in print and I should not do so now did\r\n    I not believe myself in possession of truths, the revelation\r\n    of which will prove of inestimable value to many who may see\r\n    these lines. Mine has been a trying experience. For many\r\n    years I was conscious of a want of nerve tone. My mind seemed\r\n    sluggish and I felt a certain falling off in my natural\r\n    condition of intellectual acuteness, activity, and vigor. I\r\n    presume this is the same way in which an innumerable number\r\n    of other people feel, who, like myself, are physically below\r\n    par, but like thousands of others I paid no attention to\r\n    these annoying troubles, attributing them to overwork, and\r\n    resorting to a glass of beer or a milk punch, which would for\r\n    the time invigorate and relieve my weariness.\r\n\r\n    After awhile the stimulants commenced to disagree with my\r\n    stomach, my weariness increased, and I was compelled to\r\n    resort to other means to find relief. If a physician is\r\n    suffering he invariably calls another physician to prescribe\r\n    for him, as he cannot see himself as he sees others; so I\r\n    called a physician, and he advised me to try a little\r\n    chemical food, or a bottle of hypophosphates. I took two or\r\n    three bottles of the chemical food with no apparent benefit.\r\n    My lassitude and indisposition seemed to increase, my food\r\n    distressed me. I suffered from neuralgic pains in different\r\n    parts of my body, my muscles became sore, my bowels were\r\n    constipated, and my prospects for recovery were not very\r\n    flattering. I stated my case to another physician, and he\r\n    advised me to take five to ten drops of Magende's solution of\r\n    morphine, two or three times a day, for the weakness and\r\n    distress in my stomach, and a blue pill every other night to\r\n    relieve the constipation. The morphine produced such a\r\n    deathly nausea that I could not take it, and the blue pill\r\n    failed to relieve my constipation.\r\n\r\n    In this condition I passed nearly a year, wholly unfit for\r\n    business, while the effort to think was irksome and painful.\r\n    My blood became impoverished, and I suffered from incapacity\r\n    with an appalling sense of misery and general apprehension of\r\n    coming evil. I passed sleepless nights and was troubled with\r\n    irregular action of the heart, a constantly feverish\r\n    condition, and the most excruciating tortures in my stomach,\r\n    living for days on rice water and gruel, and, indeed, the\r\n    digestive functions seemed to be entirely destroyed.\r\n\r\n    It was natural that while in this condition I should become\r\n    hypochondrical, and fearful suggestions of self-destruction\r\n    occasionally presented themselves. I experienced an\r\n    insatiable desire for sleep, but on retiring would lie awake\r\n    for a long time, tormented with troubled reflections, and\r\n    when at last I did fall into an uneasy slumber of short\r\n    duration, it was disturbed by horrid dreams. In this\r\n    condition I determined to take a trip to Europe, but in spite\r\n    of all the attentions of physicians and change of scene and\r\n    climate, I did not improve, and so returned home with no\r\n    earthly hope of ever again being able to leave the house.\r\n\r\n    Among the numerous friends that called on me was one who had\r\n    been afflicted somewhat similarly to myself, but who had been\r\n    restored to perfect health. Upon his earned recommendation I\r\n    began the same treatment he had employed but with little hope\r\n    of being benefited. At first, I experienced little, if any,\r\n    relief, except that it did not distress my stomach as other\r\n    remedies or even food had done. I continued its use, however,\r\n    and after the third bottle could see a marked change for the\r\n    better, and now after the fifteenth bottle I am happy to\r\n    state that I am again able to attend to my professional\r\n    duties. I sleep well, nothing distresses me that I eat, I go\r\n    from day to day without a feeling of weariness or pain,\r\n    indeed I am a well man, and wholly through the influence of\r\n    H.H. Warner & Co's Tippecanoe. I consider this remedy as\r\n    taking the highest possible rank in the treatment of all\r\n    diseases marked by debility, loss of appetite, and all other\r\n    symptoms of stomach and digestive disorders. It is\r\n    overwhelmingly superior to the tonics, bitters, and dyspepsia\r\n    cures of the day, and is certain to be so acknowledged by the\r\n    public universally. Thousands of people to-day are going to\r\n    premature graves with these serious diseases, that I have\r\n    above described, and to all such I would say: \"Do not let\r\n    your good judgment be governed by your prejudices, but give\r\n    the above named remedy a fair and patient trial, and I\r\n    believe you will not only be rewarded by a perfect\r\n    restoration to health, but you will also be convinced that\r\n    the medical profession does not possess all the knowledge\r\n    there is embraced in medical science.\"\r\n\r\n    A.G.

This\r\nis six degrees lower than the lowest record ever made here, which was\r\ntwenty years ago, when on the 1st of January it marked 18 below at my\r\nhouse, with some other records two or three degrees lower. At that time\r\npeach orchards were badly killed. There can be no doubt that such is the\r\ncase now.

I was eighteen, strong and well, but did not\r\nknow how to work. In the little back room of the New York tenement house\r\n(by the way, the landlady seized my clothes for our rent) I considered\r\nmy future. I had inherited a great faith in relatives, from my father,\r\nso I wrote to seven. I received six polite notes, telling me to go to\r\nwork, and the following letter:\r\n\r\n   JONESBORO, COLORADO--JACKSON'S RANCH.\r\n\r\n   Dear Nell.--I'm your cousin Jack. Your father once give me\r\n   money to come out West. I've took up land, got a comfortable\r\n   home, no style or frills, but good folks to live with and\r\n   healthy grub. I've got the best wife you ever see and seven\r\n   fine youngsters. The city ain't no place for a friendless\r\n   girl. Wife wants you to come. She'll be a mother to you. Come\r\n   right off. I'll meet you at Denver.\r\n\r\n   Jack.\r\n\r\nInclosed was a check sufficient to defray expenses; so I started. Denver\r\nwas then only a large town and the depot a barn-like structure. I got\r\nout of the cars and stood bewildered among all the emigrants and their\r\nbundles. Some one touched me on the shoulder--a roughly-dressed,\r\nbroad-shouldered man with long, blonde beard and big blue eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Are you Nell?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and you're Cousin Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew you,\" he said, as he led the way, \"by your black clothes an'\r\nsorrerful look, an' them big blue eyes, like yer father's as two peas.\r\nWe'll git the shader outer 'em when we get home. Yer father was a mighty\r\ngood man. Bless yer dear heart, don't let them tears come. This 'ere's a\r\ndry country, we don't waste no water.\"\r\n\r\nComforting me in his kind, rough way, he reached his team, a big green\r\nwagon, drawn by two wild-looking steeds which I afterward knew to be\r\nbronchos. A fat, blonde boy, about twelve, held the reins.\r\n\r\n\"That's Ted,\" said Cousin Jack. \"Ted, this is Miss Nell, yer cousin;\r\ngive her a hug.\" The fat boy solemnly obeyed.\r\n\r\nAfter this he seemed to have a special claim on my affections because he\r\nmet me first. Jack's wife was a jolly, plump woman, with brown eyes and\r\ncurly hair. She always had a baby in her arms and another at her heels.\r\nShe adored Jack. I never knew them to have a quarrel. I soon grew to\r\nlove the life at the ranch. I liked the big, half-finished house, its\r\nuntidyness and comfort--its pleasant, healthy atmosphere. I loved the\r\nchildren, the household pets--Shep, the sagacious dog; Thad, the clever\r\ncat; the hens and sheep; the horses Dolly, Dot, and Daisy, that did the\r\nplowing, and the marketing at Denver, twelve miles away, and were so\r\ngentle and kind we used to ride them without saddle or bridle. I learned\r\nthat cattle grew fat on the dry-looking grass and gave the best of milk.\r\nI learned to love the broad plains and the glorious sunsets, and to\r\nwatch the distant bands of Indians with half fear, half interest. I\r\nhelped Cousin Mary, sewed and cooked, kept the house and children neat,\r\nand lifted many burdens from her weary shoulders. We were so happy. The\r\nchildren and I took long walks over the plains, and Ted and I took many\r\nrides on Dolly and Dot, and in the long winter evenings I told the\r\nchildren stories. Occasionally Harry White came over to visit us from\r\nhis ranch five miles away. He lived with his old mother; he and Jack\r\nwere dear friends. Harry needed a wife, Jack used to say, winking at me.\r\n\r\nOne day Jack went to Denver for supplies. He went alone, and coming home\r\nlater than usual, Ted and I and baby Mame went out to meet him. Jack\r\nlooked sober and guilty, and seemed ill at ease. If he ever drank, I\r\nshould have thought him intoxicated. In the wagon was a queer-shaped\r\nheap under a horse-blanket. I was sure it moved. When we got behind the\r\nbarn Jack said, sheepishly, avoiding my eye.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Ted, I calkerlate I've got su'thing in that there waggin that 'ul\r\nastonish yer marm.\"\r\n\r\nLittle Mame pulled the blanket off the heap; she had been peeping under\r\nit all the while she was in the back of the wagon. There lay a human\r\nbeing. Such an object; short and squat, dressed in a queer blue blouse\r\nwith flowing sleeves, wide trousers and queer wooden shoes. He had\r\nsmall, black eyes, a shaven poll, from which depended a long thin queue.\r\nHis countenance was battered and bruised, his clothes torn and bloody.\r\n\r\n\"There was a row down to Denver,\" said Jack; \"the Christian folks stove\r\nin these 'ere heathen's winders, tore their houses down, an' killed half\r\non 'em. I cleared out soon as I could. When I got half way home I heard\r\na noise back o' me, and out crawled this thing. I was so dumfounded I\r\ncouldn't speak. He thought I was going ter send him back, an' he fell\r\nter cryin' an' jabberin' in that yap of his, an' clingin' onter my han'\r\nan' kissin' of it. It sorter turned my stomach. I told him ter set down,\r\ngive him some crackers ter eat, covered him up an' told him he could\r\nlive with me. What do you s'pose marm'll say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Cousin Jack,\" I said, \"of course, she will not care. Your home is a\r\nrefuge for all the wretched and unfortunate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now don't, Nell,\" he said, turning as red as a rose, and busying\r\nhimself about the harness. The Celestial looked at us solemnly: Mame\r\ntoddled up to him. He looked at her curiously, but did not move.\r\n\r\n\"Get out, John,\" said Jack, \"you needn't be scared no more; we're to\r\nhome.\"\r\n\r\nHe got out stiffly, and, to my surprise, turned and lifted the baby\r\ndown. She caught his pig-tail, and pulled it in wild delight. He seemed\r\ngrieved when I took her away. When Jack told Mary, the good soul found a\r\nthousand reasons why he should stay, and hurried to make him a bed in\r\nthe attic. The Celestial did not say much, but when Jack called him\r\n\"John,\" he smiled a sad smile.\r\n\r\n\"Melican man callee John. Hump. Yik Kee.\"\r\n\r\nSo with due consideration for his feelings we addressed him as Yik Kee.\r\nHe was of great use. He helped take care of the children, did the\r\nwashing (Mary did not fancy his method of sprinkling clothes) and helped\r\nJack on the farm. We made him one of the family. He was always pleasant\r\nand smiling, but was a man of few words.\r\n\r\nCousin Jack added much to his income by trading in hides. Ranchmen\r\nliving at a distance sold their hides to him and Jack sold them to\r\ntraders who came around at certain times in the year. Harry White was a\r\npartner in the business. He used to go on a sort of round-up and visit\r\nthe ranches all over the country. The cattle of the ranchmen roamed in\r\nvast herds over the plains, protected only by the brand of the owner.\r\nCattle stealing was frequently practiced. Offenders in this respect were\r\nshown no mercy. They were convicted, tried, and executed only in the\r\ncourt of Judge Lynch. I never blamed the ranchmen for this; it was\r\nimpossible to guard the herds in the vast area over which they\r\ntraversed, and the cattle must be protected in some way. Gil Mead was a\r\nwealthy ranchman, who lived about ten miles from us. He owned the\r\nlargest herd of cattle on the plains. They were branded with the vowels\r\nof his name. E.A., which could be recognized anywhere. He always shipped\r\nhis cattle East to his brother in Chicago. I feared the man. He was tall\r\nand gaunt, with deep-set black eyes and low forehead. His home was\r\nunhappy; his wife cross and ugly, and his children wild and unruly. This\r\nmade him more than commonly disagreeable.\r\n\r\nI think it was in the fall of '74 that Harry White brought the big load\r\nof hides to Jack. Both were much pleased at the bargain they made. Harry\r\ngave glowing accounts of a new customer--a ranchman from Chicago, who\r\nhad taken up an abandoned homestead. He had purchased many cattle from\r\nhis cousin, Gil Mead, and hoped to rival him in the number and quality\r\nof his herd. Jack packed the hides away to keep till December, when we\r\nexpected the dealer.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, not long after this, Gil Mead rode up to the house,\r\nlooking very agreeable and pleasant. A couple of strangers, also\r\nranchmen, were with him. They wanted to look at the hides, one of the\r\nmen being a trader, Gil said. Jack was in Denver, so Yik Kee and I went\r\nto the barn with them. They looked the hides over carefully, and\r\nconversed in low tones, Gil with a suppressed oath. Finally they thanked\r\nus courteously and took their leave.\r\n\r\n\"Hump; no goodee,\" said Yik Kee, but he wouldn't say any more.\r\n\r\nAt five that evening, when we were at supper, a crowd of twenty-five or\r\nthirty men rode up on horseback. Jack came out and met them, inviting\r\nthem in to take supper, in his generous, hospitable way. They wanted him\r\nto go to Denver with them, there was to be a meeting there of importance\r\nto ranchmen. The meeting would be at eight. They had brought with them\r\nan extra horse for Jack. Mary looked around for Yik Kee to help her, but\r\nhe had mysteriously disappeared.\r\n\r\nI faintly remembered seeing his white, horrified face peering around the\r\nbarn at the horses. I noted the visitors ate little--the food seemed to\r\nchoke them. Some of them watched Mary and the baby in a queer sort of\r\nway. When Jack, as was his custom, kissed his wife and babies good-by,\r\none of the visitors, an oldish man, coughed huskily, and said: \"Blest if\r\nI kin stan' this.\" They all rode off, Jack the merriest of all, waving\r\nhis hat till he was out of sight.\r\n\r\nWhen we were clearing up the unusual quantity of dishes, Yik Kee\r\nappeared at the end window and beckoned me. I followed him out. Ted was\r\nwith him. Behind the barn were the three horses saddled. Shep was with\r\nthem, released from confinement, where he had been secured from\r\nfollowing his master.\r\n\r\n\"Foller 'em,\" said Ted in an excited whisper. \"Yik's afraid they're up\r\nto something.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Yik?\" I said, sternly. \"No fooling now.\"\r\n\r\nFor answer he twisted his long pig-tail around his neck, tying it under\r\nhis left ear in a significant manner.\r\n\r\n\"Hump, he hangee; stealee cow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mary,\" I sobbed, remembering Gil Mead's visit, and his strange\r\nactions, and dimly seeing what Yik Kee meant, \"I must tell Mary,\" I\r\nsaid, wildly.\r\n\r\n\"Hump, no,\" said Yik Kee. \"Yellee sick,\" and he closed his eyes in a\r\ndie-away sort of manner. \"Go now--too latee.\"\r\n\r\nWe mounted.\r\n\r\n\"Mother'll think we're gone to ride,\" said Ted, as we galloped over the\r\nplains. He was deathly pale, poor little fellow, but he sat erect and\r\nfirm. I saw his father's big Colt's revolver sticking out of his pocket.\r\nHe was a determined boy. Even in my despair, in my wild hope that I\r\ncould save Jack by begging on my knees, that I could cling to him, that\r\nthey would have to kill me first, I could not help a smile at the\r\ncomical figure Yik Kee presented on horseback. His loose garments\r\nflapped in the wind, his long pig-tail flew out behind, and he bobbed\r\nup and down like a kernel of corn in a corn-hopper.\r\n\r\nIt was a soft, warm night, lighted only by the pale young moon and the\r\ntwinkling stars. We rode as fast as our horses could gallop. Shep was\r\nclose at our heels. Way ahead, when we reached the top of a little hill,\r\nwe saw the crowd of horsemen. They were riding toward Denver. We\r\ngalloped on with renewed zeal. They turned into a cross road leading to\r\nMead's ranch. On this road was a bridge over Dry Gulch, which was in the\r\nspring a roaring torrent. Beyond the bridge, across the fields, was the\r\nhay-stack of Mead, where was stored sufficient to feed his domestic\r\ncattle through the winter. We at last reached the turn in the road. They\r\nwere three miles in advance, riding rapidly. Yik Kee stopped at the\r\nturn. \"Hump! Can't catchee. Hangee at bridge. You goee!\" He turned his\r\nhorse and sped across the field, deserting us basely.\r\n\r\nWe rode on, Ted and I. He was pale and still; my cheeks were burning. We\r\nneared the bridge. The high mound of earth before us hid us from sight.\r\nWe stopped our horses and listened. The men had lighted torches, some\r\nwere preparing a rough gallows under the bridge; two were uncoiling\r\nrope; some held the horses of the others beyond the bridge. The men were\r\nmasked now, and I could see by the lighted torches that this number was\r\nincreased. Jack was very white and sad, but he showed no fear.\r\n\r\n\"I am innocent, gentlemen,\" he said, slowly, \"but I refuse to tell you\r\nof whom I bought the hides.\"\r\n\r\nI understood him. Could Harry White be a cattle thief? I felt as if I\r\nwere going mad.\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do?\" whispered Ted, cocking his revolver?\r\n\r\nSuddenly a bright red light illuminated the heavens, followed by clouds\r\nof black smoke and a queer crackling noise. A yell from the men--Gil\r\nMead's voice above the rest. The hay-stack was on fire. It seemed to me\r\nin the gale around it that I could see a foreign-looking human vanishing\r\nacross the plain.\r\n\r\nThe men mounted their horses, Gil Mead at the head, and set off across\r\nthe fields at a mad gallop. They must save the stack. They left Jack,\r\nbound hand and foot, and guarded by one man.\r\n\r\nShep, the wonderful dog, had kept by us until now, slinking in the dark\r\nshadows. Now, gliding sidewise and still, he reached the man on guard\r\nwhose back was to us, and with no warning growl caught him by the throat\r\nwith strong white teeth that could choak a coyote in a second. The man,\r\nwho was in a sitting posture, fell back with a groan. Ted struck him\r\nover the head with the butt of the revolver, and pulled off the dog. I\r\ncut Jack's bonds with a knife. He looked at us wonderingly and staggered\r\nto his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind how we came, Jack,\" I said; \"quick, mount the horse beyond\r\nthe bridge, and ride to Denver for your life. They will not harm a woman\r\nand child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Harry White,\" he muttered, the loyal soul that even now could think of\r\nanother's danger.\r\n\r\n\"I will tell him.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no; not of this--only say, if he stole the cattle, to fly the\r\ncountry. They will find out, sooner or later.\"\r\n\r\nHe galloped down the road. Ted and I mounted, calling off Shep, who sat\r\non his haunches watching the unconscious man, and then we, too, sped\r\ndown the road. The hay-stack was giving out great columns of black\r\nsmoke, but the fire was dead.\r\n\r\nAhead of us was a riderless horse, Dolly, who greeted her master with a\r\njoyful whinny. Where was Yik Kee? Then Dot, my horse, shied from the\r\nroad at a recumbent black figure. It was the indomitable Yik Kee, who\r\nhad crawled all the way from the stack on his stomach, so that he could\r\nnot be seen, after lying in the ditch till the blaze had faded out.\r\n\"Hump! no catchee Chinee; heap sore,\" he said, laconically rubbing his\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nHe mounted Dolly, and we rode on to White's ranch. Harry rushed out at\r\nthe sound of horses' feet, at midnight. There, under the twinkling stars\r\nI looked into his eyes, and I told him the whole story. He showed no\r\nguilt, but only said we must stay the night at his ranch, for the men\r\nwould come back to Jack's for him, and then mounting his fleet colt rode\r\noff down the road. I comforted his mother as best I could. At day-break\r\nwe rode home.\r\n\r\nMary was in a wild state of alarm. Where had we been? Where was Jack?\r\nand how cruel we were to leave her alone. She said that at one o'clock\r\nthree masked men had come to the house and searched it and the\r\npremises, and had not molested her or the children, only asking where\r\nJack was, very sternly and sharply.\r\n\r\nAt noon Jack, Harry, the sheriff, and a party of armed men from Denver\r\nrode up, stopping only a moment to tell me they would be back at night.\r\nI dared not tell Mary, and she worried all the afternoon at their\r\nstrange conduct. At night Jack and Harry came home, looking tired but\r\nhappy. Then Jack told Mary, and she clung to him as though she could\r\nnever let him go.\r\n\r\nIt seemed the pleasing ranchman from Chicago was one of a band of cattle\r\nthieves. He sold the hides to Harry, who, honest and open himself, was\r\nslow to suspect wrong dealings in others. The sheriff had caught the men\r\nskinning a cow that belonged to Mead, and had captured the gang and\r\ntaken them to Denver.\r\n\r\nThe men concerned in the attempt to lynch Jack were sincerely sorry.\r\nTheir regrets would not have availed much, however, if they had\r\nsucceeded in their purpose. They gave each of the children ten acres of\r\nland; they gave Ted sixty-five, and me, whom they pleased to consider\r\nvery plucky, one hundred and fifty acres. I felt rich enough, and time\r\nhas made it very valuable land. The man on guard was our warmest\r\nadmirer. He thought Ted, Shep, and I wonders of courage. He said when I\r\ncame down on the bridge with the open knife, he thought his last hour\r\nhad come.\r\n\r\nGil Mead committed suicide not long after this. He was always queer. No\r\none ever knew that Yik Kee set the stack afire. I tell you Jack rewarded\r\nthe faithful fellow--gave him a good farm, taught him to work it, and\r\nbuilt him a house. The funniest thing was Yik Kee had a wife and three\r\nqueer little children back in China, and Jack sent for them, and Yik Kee\r\nand his family are as happy as they can be. The children play with\r\nJack's (he has twelve now) and get along finely together.\r\n\r\nIn '75 I married Harry White, which, I suppose, was foreseen from the\r\nbeginning--at least, Jack says anybody could have seen it. The most\r\nserene and satisfied face at the wedding was that of the Celestial. In\r\nmy inner consciousness, notwithstanding he is a \"heathen Chinee,\" I have\r\nthe conviction that as great a hero as is seen in modern times is the\r\nman of few words, Yik Kee.--_The Continent._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMOROUS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A LEEDLE MISTAKES.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I see all how it vhas now,\" observed Jacob Handonder, as he came out.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you do! You are the man who got drunk and raised a fuss on a street\r\ncar?\"\r\n\r\n\"I vhas der man, and I tell you how it vhas. You see, I vhas tight. I\r\ntook too much beer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can a saloon-keeper take too much beer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Vhell, maype I vhas seek. I shtart to go home. Vhen der sthreet car\r\ncomes along I pelief it vhas my house. I got in und look all aroundt,\r\nbut I doan' see Katarina. I call out for der shildrens, und eferybody\r\nlaughs at me. Maype dot makes me madt, und der drifer calls a boliceman,\r\nund I vhas galloped down here.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it wasn't your home?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not oxactly. It vhas a leedle mistake.\"\r\n\r\n\"It'll cost you $5.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vheel, dot ain't so bad. I pay him oop und go home to preakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be careful next time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I vill dot. Next time I vhas tight I go home on some shtreets\r\nmidout cars. If I take some ice-wagon for my house I pelief I got cooled\r\noff pooty queek.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHARPER THAN A RAZOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nA long-waisted man, with the nose of a fox and an eye full of\r\nspeculation, walked up to a second-hand clothier, in Buffalo, the other\r\nday, and said:\r\n\r\n\"See that overcoat hanging out down there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've taken a fancy to it. It's rather cheeky to ask you to go\r\ndown there, but I'll make it an object; I won't give but $8 for the\r\ncoat, but I'll give you $1 to buy it for me. You are also a Jew and know\r\nhow to beat him down. Here are $9.\"\r\n\r\nThe dealer took the money and started off, and in five minutes was back\r\nwith the coat.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" chuckled the other. \"I reckoned you'd lay him out. How much did\r\nyou make for your share?\"\r\n\r\n\"Vhell, ash dot is my branch shore, and I only ask six dollar fur de\r\ngoat, I was about tree dollar ahead.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA COMING DIVIDEND.\r\n\r\n\r\nLast fall, when a would-be purchaser of railroad stock called upon\r\nRussell Sage and asked him regarding the outlook of certain stock, Mr.\r\nSage replied:\r\n\r\n\"Splendid idea! That stock is certain to raise fifteen per cent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon what do you base your calculations?\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon the immense crops to be moved along that line.\"\r\n\r\nThe other day the same gentleman again interviewed Mr. Sage regarding\r\nthe same stock, and the great financier replied:\r\n\r\n\"Best outlook in the world for that stock! Certain to advance fifteen\r\nper cent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you base your calculations upon last fall's crops?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; it's going to be an open winter, and the line will save enough\r\nin snow-plows to declare a dividend of five per cent.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt a party: Merchant--\"Ah!

Shipping grades of cattle were active and\r\nfirm yesterday at $5 @ 6 67-1/2, exporters taking a fair number. Common\r\nlots were lower, with sales to dressed-beef buyers as low as $4 25. A\r\ngood share of the day's trading was done at $5 70 @ 6 60. Quotations are\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nFancy fat cattle                             $ 6 75 @ 7 00\r\nChoice to prime steers                         6 05 @ 6 70\r\nFair to good shipping steers                   5 55 @ 6 00\r\nCommon to medium steers                        4 25 @ 5 50\r\nButcher's steers                               4 50 @ 5 00\r\nCows and bulls, common to good                 3 00 @ 4 25\r\nInferior cows and bulls                        2 00 @ 2 95\r\nStockers                                       3 40 @ 4 40\r\nFeeders                                        4 25 @ 4 75\r\nMilch cows, per head                          25 00 @55 00\r\nVeal calves, per 100lbs                        4 00 @ 7 25\r\n\r\nHOGS.--The receipts Sunday and Monday were estimated at 18,000 hogs,\r\nagainst only 6,700 received in the corresponding time last week.\r\nAlthough the receipts have been increasing during the last few days,\r\nsupplies are still remarkably small for the first half of January. The\r\ngreat bulk of the crop has undoubtedly been marketed, but there are\r\nknown to be a very good number still unmarketed, and it is believed that\r\nfarmers are unwilling to ship freely to this market while packers are so\r\nlargely inactive, fearing a decline in prices. Shippers have been taking\r\nmost of the hogs lately. Butchers took in the neighborhood of 1,900\r\nhogs, leaving a few thousand still unsold. Sales were made of heavy at\r\n$5 10 @ 6 25; light at $5 10 @ 5 75, and skips and culls at $3 50 @ 5.\r\n\r\nNote.--All sales of hogs are made subject to a shrinkage of 40 lbs for\r\npiggy sows and 80 lbs for stags. Dead hogs sell for 1-1/2c per lb for\r\nweights of 200 and over and for weights of less than 100lbs.\r\n\r\nSHEEP.--The market opened with a good supply, the receipts for Sunday\r\nand Monday being estimated at 2,500 head, as against 1,968 received in\r\nthe same time last week. There was an active local and shipping demand\r\nfor all desirable offerings, and prices ruled firm at the recent\r\nadvance, sales being made of fair to choice at $3 65 @ 5 60.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION MERCHANTS.\r\n\r\nJ.H.
