Their sweet\r\nlittle letters plead to know \"more about Dorothy\"; and they ask: \"What\r\nbecame of the Cowardly Lion?\" and \"What did Ozma do\r\nafterward?\"--meaning, of course, after she became the Ruler of Oz. And\r\nsome of them suggest plots to me, saying: \"Please have Dorothy go to the\r\nLand of Oz again\"; or, \"Why don't you make Ozma and Dorothy meet, and\r\nhave a good time together?\" Indeed, could I do all that my little\r\nfriends ask, I would be obliged to write dozens of books to satisfy\r\ntheir demands. And I wish I could, for I enjoy writing these stories\r\njust as much as the children say they enjoy reading them.\r\n\r\nWell, here is \"more about Dorothy,\" and about our old friends the\r\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman, and about the Cowardly Lion, and Ozma,\r\nand all the rest of them; and here, likewise, is a good deal about some\r\nnew folks that are queer and unusual. One little friend, who read this\r\nstory before it was printed, said to me: \"Billina is _real Ozzy_, Mr.\r\nBaum, and so are Tiktok and the Hungry Tiger.\"\r\n\r\nIf this judgment is unbiased and correct, and the little folks find this\r\nnew story \"real Ozzy,\" I shall be very glad indeed that I wrote it. But\r\nperhaps I shall get some more of those very welcome letters from my\r\nreaders, telling me just how they like \"Ozma of Oz.\" I hope so, anyway.\r\n\r\n    L. FRANK BAUM.\r\n\r\n    MACATAWA, 1907.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Girl in the Chicken Coop\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe wind blew hard and joggled the water of the ocean, sending ripples\r\nacross its surface. Then the wind pushed the edges of the ripples until\r\nthey became waves, and shoved the waves around until they became\r\nbillows. The billows rolled dreadfully high: higher even than the tops\r\nof houses. Some of them, indeed, rolled as high as the tops of tall\r\ntrees, and seemed like mountains, and the gulfs between the great\r\nbillows were like deep valleys.\r\n\r\nAll this mad dashing and splashing of the waters of the big ocean, which\r\nthe mischievous wind caused without any good reason whatever, resulted\r\nin a terrible storm, and a storm on the ocean is liable to cut many\r\nqueer pranks and do a lot of damage.\r\n\r\nAt the time the wind began to blow, a ship was sailing far out upon the\r\nwaters. When the waves began to tumble and toss and to grow bigger and\r\nbigger the ship rolled up and down, and tipped sidewise--first one way\r\nand then the other--and was jostled around so roughly that even the\r\nsailor-men had to hold fast to the ropes and railings to keep themselves\r\nfrom being swept away by the wind or pitched headlong into the sea.\r\n\r\nAnd the clouds were so thick in the sky that the sunlight couldn't get\r\nthrough them; so that the day grew dark as night, which added to the\r\nterrors of the storm.\r\n\r\nThe Captain of the ship was not afraid, because he had seen storms\r\nbefore, and had sailed his ship through them in safety; but he knew that\r\nhis passengers would be in danger if they tried to stay on deck, so he\r\nput them all into the cabin and told them to stay there until after the\r\nstorm was over, and to keep brave hearts and not be scared, and all\r\nwould be well with them.\r\n\r\nNow, among these passengers was a little Kansas girl named Dorothy\r\nGale, who was going with her Uncle Henry to Australia, to visit some\r\nrelatives they had never before seen. Uncle Henry, you must know, was\r\nnot very well, because he had been working so hard on his Kansas farm\r\nthat his health had given way and left him weak and nervous. So he left\r\nAunt Em at home to watch after the hired men and to take care of the\r\nfarm, while he traveled far away to Australia to visit his cousins and\r\nhave a good rest.\r\n\r\nDorothy was eager to go with him on this journey, and Uncle Henry\r\nthought she would be good company and help cheer him up; so he decided\r\nto take her along. The little girl was quite an experienced traveller,\r\nfor she had once been carried by a cyclone as far away from home as the\r\nmarvelous Land of Oz, and she had met with a good many adventures in\r\nthat strange country before she managed to get back to Kansas again. So\r\nshe wasn't easily frightened, whatever happened, and when the wind began\r\nto howl and whistle, and the waves began to tumble and toss, our little\r\ngirl didn't mind the uproar the least bit.\r\n\r\n\"Of course we'll have to stay in the cabin,\" she said to Uncle Henry and\r\nthe other passengers, \"and keep as quiet as possible until the storm is\r\nover. For the Captain says if we go on deck we may be blown overboard.\"\r\n\r\nNo one wanted to risk such an accident as that, you may be sure; so all\r\nthe passengers stayed huddled up in the dark cabin, listening to the\r\nshrieking of the storm and the creaking of the masts and rigging and\r\ntrying to keep from bumping into one another when the ship tipped\r\nsidewise.\r\n\r\nDorothy had almost fallen asleep when she was aroused with a start to\r\nfind that Uncle Henry was missing. She couldn't imagine where he had\r\ngone, and as he was not very strong she began to worry about him, and to\r\nfear he might have been careless enough to go on deck. In that case he\r\nwould be in great danger unless he instantly came down again.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that Uncle Henry had gone to lie down in his little\r\nsleeping-berth, but Dorothy did not know that. She only remembered that\r\nAunt Em had cautioned her to take good care of her uncle, so at once she\r\ndecided to go on deck and find him, in spite of the fact that the\r\ntempest was now worse than ever, and the ship was plunging in a really\r\ndreadful manner. Indeed, the little girl found it was as much as she\r\ncould do to mount the stairs to the deck, and as soon as she got there\r\nthe wind struck her so fiercely that it almost tore away the skirts of\r\nher dress. Yet Dorothy felt a sort of joyous excitement in defying the\r\nstorm, and while she held fast to the railing she peered around through\r\nthe gloom and thought she saw the dim form of a man clinging to a mast\r\nnot far away from her. This might be her uncle, so she called as loudly\r\nas she could:\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Henry! Uncle Henry!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"UNCLE HENRY! UNCLE HENRY!\" CALLED DOROTHY]\r\n\r\nBut the wind screeched and howled so madly that she scarce heard her own\r\nvoice, and the man certainly failed to hear her, for he did not move.\r\n\r\nDorothy decided she must go to him; so she made a dash forward, during a\r\nlull in the storm, to where a big square chicken-coop had been lashed to\r\nthe deck with ropes. She reached this place in safety, but no sooner had\r\nshe seized fast hold of the slats of the big box in which the chickens\r\nwere kept than the wind, as if enraged because the little girl dared to\r\nresist its power, suddenly redoubled its fury. With a scream like that\r\nof an angry giant it tore away the ropes that held the coop and lifted\r\nit high into the air, with Dorothy still clinging to the slats. Around\r\nand over it whirled, this way and that, and a few moments later the\r\nchicken-coop dropped far away into the sea, where the big waves caught\r\nit and slid it up-hill to a foaming crest and then downhill into a deep\r\nvalley, as if it were nothing more than a plaything to keep them amused.\r\n\r\nDorothy had a good ducking, you may be sure, but she didn't lose her\r\npresence of mind even for a second. She kept tight hold of the stout\r\nslats and as soon as she could get the water out of her eyes she saw\r\nthat the wind had ripped the cover from the coop, and the poor chickens\r\nwere fluttering away in every direction, being blown by the wind until\r\nthey looked like feather dusters without handles. The bottom of the coop\r\nwas made of thick boards, so Dorothy found she was clinging to a sort of\r\nraft, with sides of slats, which readily bore up her weight. After\r\ncoughing the water out of her throat and getting her breath again, she\r\nmanaged to climb over the slats and stand upon the firm wooden bottom of\r\nthe coop, which supported her easily enough.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I've got a ship of my own!\" she thought, more amused than\r\nfrightened at her sudden change of condition; and then, as the coop\r\nclimbed up to the top of a big wave, she looked eagerly around for the\r\nship from which she had been blown.\r\n\r\nIt was far, far away, by this time. Perhaps no one on board had yet\r\nmissed her, or knew of her strange adventure. Down into a valley\r\nbetween the waves the coop swept her, and when she climbed another\r\ncrest the ship looked like a toy boat, it was such a long way off. Soon\r\nit had entirely disappeared in the gloom, and then Dorothy gave a sigh\r\nof regret at parting with Uncle Henry and began to wonder what was going\r\nto happen to her next.\r\n\r\nJust now she was tossing on the bosom of a big ocean, with nothing to\r\nkeep her afloat but a miserable wooden hen-coop that had a plank bottom\r\nand slatted sides, through which the water constantly splashed and\r\nwetted her through to the skin! And there was nothing to eat when she\r\nbecame hungry--as she was sure to do before long--and no fresh water to\r\ndrink and no dry clothes to put on.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I declare!\" she exclaimed, with a laugh. \"You're in a pretty fix,\r\nDorothy Gale, I can tell you! and I haven't the least idea how you're\r\ngoing to get out of it!\"\r\n\r\nAs if to add to her troubles the night was now creeping on, and the gray\r\nclouds overhead changed to inky blackness. But the wind, as if satisfied\r\nat last with its mischievous pranks, stopped blowing this ocean and\r\nhurried away to another part of the world to blow something else; so\r\nthat the waves, not being joggled any more, began to quiet down and\r\nbehave themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOROTHY AFLOAT IN THE HEN-COOP]\r\n\r\nIt was lucky for Dorothy, I think, that the storm subsided; otherwise,\r\nbrave though she was, I fear she might have perished. Many children, in\r\nher place, would have wept and given way to despair; but because Dorothy\r\nhad encountered so many adventures and come safely through them it did\r\nnot occur to her at this time to be especially afraid. She was wet and\r\nuncomfortable, it is true; but, after sighing that one sigh I told you\r\nof, she managed to recall some of her customary cheerfulness and decided\r\nto patiently await whatever her fate might be.\r\n\r\nBy and by the black clouds rolled away and showed a blue sky overhead,\r\nwith a silver moon shining sweetly in the middle of it and little stars\r\nwinking merrily at Dorothy when she looked their way. The coop did not\r\ntoss around any more, but rode the waves more gently--almost like a\r\ncradle rocking--so that the floor upon which Dorothy stood was no longer\r\nswept by water coming through the slats. Seeing this, and being quite\r\nexhausted by the excitement of the past few hours, the little girl\r\ndecided that sleep would be the best thing to restore her strength and\r\nthe easiest way in which she could pass the time. The floor was damp and\r\nshe was herself wringing wet, but fortunately this was a warm climate\r\nand she did not feel at all cold. So she sat down in a corner of the\r\ncoop, leaned her back against the slats, nodded at the friendly stars\r\nbefore she closed her eyes, and was asleep in half a minute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Yellow Hen\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nA strange noise awoke Dorothy, who opened her eyes to find that day had\r\ndawned and the sun was shining brightly in a clear sky. She had been\r\ndreaming that she was back in Kansas again, and playing in the old\r\nbarn-yard with the calves and pigs and chickens all around her; and at\r\nfirst, as she rubbed the sleep from her eyes, she really imagined she\r\nwas there.\r\n\r\n\"Kut-kut-kut, ka-daw-kut! Kut-kut-kut, ka-daw-kut!\"\r\n\r\nAh; here again was the strange noise that had awakened her. Surely it\r\nwas a hen cackling! But her wide-open eyes first saw, through the slats\r\nof the coop, the blue waves of the ocean, now calm and placid, and her\r\nthoughts flew back to the past night, so full of danger and discomfort.\r\nAlso she began to remember that she was a waif of the storm, adrift upon\r\na treacherous and unknown sea.\r\n\r\n\"Kut-kut-kut, ka-daw-w-w--kut!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" cried Dorothy, starting to her feet.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I've just laid an egg, that's all,\" replied a small, but sharp and\r\ndistinct voice, and looking around her the little girl discovered a\r\nyellow hen squatting in the opposite corner of the coop.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" she exclaimed, in surprise; \"have _you_ been here all night,\r\ntoo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" answered the hen, fluttering her wings and yawning. \"When\r\nthe coop blew away from the ship I clung fast to this corner, with claws\r\nand beak, for I knew if I fell into the water I'd surely be drowned.\r\nIndeed, I nearly drowned, as it was, with all that water washing over\r\nme. I never was so wet before in my life!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" agreed Dorothy, \"it was pretty wet, for a time, I know. But do\r\nyou feel comfor'ble now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not very. The sun has helped to dry my feathers, as it has your dress,\r\nand I feel better since I laid my morning egg. But what's to become of\r\nus, I should like to know, afloat on this big pond?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to know that, too,\" said Dorothy. \"But, tell me; how does it\r\nhappen that you are able to talk? I thought hens could only cluck and\r\ncackle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, as for that,\" answered the yellow hen thoughtfully, \"I've clucked\r\nand cackled all my life, and never spoken a word before this morning,\r\nthat I can remember. But when you asked a question, a minute ago, it\r\nseemed the most natural thing in the world to answer you. So I spoke,\r\nand I seem to keep on speaking, just as you and other human beings do.\r\nStrange, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very,\" replied Dorothy. \"If we were in the Land of Oz, I wouldn't think\r\nit so queer, because many of the animals can talk in that fairy country.\r\nBut out here in the ocean must be a good long way from Oz.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is my grammar?\" asked the yellow hen, anxiously. \"Do I speak quite\r\nproperly, in your judgment?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Dorothy, \"you do very well, for a beginner.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad to know that,\" continued the yellow hen, in a confidential\r\ntone; \"because, if one is going to talk, it's best to talk correctly.\r\nThe red rooster has often said that my cluck and my cackle were quite\r\nperfect; and now it's a comfort to know I am talking properly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm beginning to get hungry,\" remarked Dorothy. \"It's breakfast time;\r\nbut there's no breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may have my egg,\" said the yellow hen. \"I don't care for it, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you want to hatch it?\" asked the little girl, in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed; I never care to hatch eggs unless I've a nice snug nest, in\r\nsome quiet place, with a baker's dozen of eggs under me. That's\r\nthirteen, you know, and it's a lucky number for hens. So you may as well\r\neat this egg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I couldn't _poss'bly_ eat it, unless it was cooked,\" exclaimed\r\nDorothy. \"But I'm much obliged for your kindness, just the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't mention it, my dear,\" answered the hen, calmly, and began pruning\r\nher feathers.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Dorothy stood looking out over the wide sea. She was still\r\nthinking of the egg, though; so presently she asked:\r\n\r\n\"Why do you lay eggs, when you don't expect to hatch them?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a habit I have,\" replied the yellow hen. \"It has always been my\r\npride to lay a fresh egg every morning, except when I'm moulting. I\r\nnever feel like having my morning cackle till the egg is properly laid,\r\nand without the chance to cackle I would not be happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's strange,\" said the girl, reflectively; \"But as I'm not a hen I\r\ncan't be 'spected to understand that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not, my dear.\"\r\n\r\nThen Dorothy fell silent again. The yellow hen was some company, and a\r\nbit of comfort, too; but it was dreadfully lonely out on the big ocean,\r\nnevertheless.\r\n\r\nAfter a time the hen flew up and perched upon the topmost slat of the\r\ncoop, which was a little above Dorothy's head when she was sitting upon\r\nthe bottom, as she had been doing for some moments past.\r\n\r\n\"Why, we are not far from land!\" exclaimed the hen.\r\n\r\n\"Where? Where is it?\" cried Dorothy, jumping up in great excitement.\r\n\r\n\"Over there a little way,\" answered the hen, nodding her head in a\r\ncertain direction. \"We seem to be drifting toward it, so that before\r\nnoon we ought to find ourselves upon dry land again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall like that!\" said Dorothy, with a little sigh, for her feet and\r\nlegs were still wetted now and then by the sea-water that came through\r\nthe open slats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE YELLOW HEN]\r\n\r\n\"So shall I,\" answered her companion. \"There is nothing in the world so\r\nmiserable as a wet hen.\"\r\n\r\nThe land, which they seemed to be rapidly approaching, since it grew\r\nmore distinct every minute, was quite beautiful as viewed by the little\r\ngirl in the floating hen-coop. Next to the water was a broad beach of\r\nwhite sand and gravel, and farther back were several rocky hills, while\r\nbeyond these appeared a strip of green trees that marked the edge of a\r\nforest. But there were no houses to be seen, nor any sign of people who\r\nmight inhabit this unknown land.\r\n\r\n\"I hope we shall find something to eat,\" said Dorothy, looking eagerly\r\nat the pretty beach toward which they drifted. \"It's long past breakfast\r\ntime, now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm a trifle hungry, myself,\" declared the yellow hen.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you eat the egg?\" asked the child. \"You don't need to have\r\nyour food cooked, as I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you take me for a cannibal?\" cried the hen, indignantly. \"I do not\r\nknow what I have said or done that leads you to insult me!\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, I'm sure Mrs.--Mrs.--by the way, may I inquire your\r\nname, ma'am?\" asked the little girl.\r\n\r\n\"My name is Bill,\" said the yellow hen, somewhat gruffly.\r\n\r\n\"Bill! Why, that's a boy's name.\"\r\n\r\n\"What difference does that make?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a lady hen, aren't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. But when I was first hatched out no one could tell whether I\r\nwas going to be a hen or a rooster; so the little boy at the farm where\r\nI was born called me Bill, and made a pet of me because I was the only\r\nyellow chicken in the whole brood. When I grew up, and he found that I\r\ndidn't crow and fight, as all the roosters do, he did not think to\r\nchange my name, and every creature in the barn-yard, as well as the\r\npeople in the house, knew me as 'Bill.' So Bill I've always been called,\r\nand Bill is my name.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's all wrong, you know,\" declared Dorothy, earnestly; \"and, if\r\nyou don't mind, I shall call you 'Billina.' Putting the 'eena' on the\r\nend makes it a girl's name, you see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't mind it in the least,\" returned the yellow hen. \"It doesn't\r\nmatter at all what you call me, so long as I know the name means _me_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Billina. _My_ name is Dorothy Gale--just Dorothy to my\r\nfriends and Miss Gale to strangers. You may call me Dorothy, if you\r\nlike. We're getting very near the shore. Do you suppose it is too deep\r\nfor me to wade the rest of the way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a few minutes longer. The sunshine is warm and pleasant, and we\r\nare in no hurry.\"\r\n\r\n\"But my feet are all wet and soggy,\" said the girl. \"My dress is dry\r\nenough, but I won't feel real comfor'ble till I get my feet dried.\"\r\n\r\nShe waited, however, as the hen advised, and before long the big wooden\r\ncoop grated gently on the sandy beach and the dangerous voyage was over.\r\n\r\nIt did not take the castaways long to reach the shore, you may be sure.\r\nThe yellow hen flew to the sands at once, but Dorothy had to climb over\r\nthe high slats. Still, for a country girl, that was not much of a feat,\r\nand as soon as she was safe ashore Dorothy drew off her wet shoes and\r\nstockings and spread them upon the sun-warmed beach to dry.\r\n\r\nThen she sat down and watched Billina, who was pick-pecking away with\r\nher sharp bill in the sand and gravel, which she scratched up and turned\r\nover with her strong claws.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing?\" asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Getting my breakfast, of course,\" murmured the hen, busily pecking\r\naway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"HOW DREADFUL!\" EXCLAIMED DOROTHY]\r\n\r\n\"What do you find?\" inquired the girl, curiously.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, some fat red ants, and some sand-bugs, and once in a while a tiny\r\ncrab. They are very sweet and nice, I assure you.\"\r\n\r\n\"How dreadful!\" exclaimed Dorothy, in a shocked voice.\r\n\r\n\"What is dreadful?\" asked the hen, lifting her head to gaze with one\r\nbright eye at her companion.\r\n\r\n\"Why, eating live things, and horrid bugs, and crawly ants. You ought to\r\nbe _'shamed_ of yourself!\"\r\n\r\n\"Goodness me!\" returned the hen, in a puzzled tone; \"how queer you are,\r\nDorothy! Live things are much fresher and more wholesome than dead ones,\r\nand you humans eat all sorts of dead creatures.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't!\" said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"You do, indeed,\" answered Billina. \"You eat lambs and sheep and cows\r\nand pigs and even chickens.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we cook 'em,\" said Dorothy, triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\"What difference does that make?\"\r\n\r\n\"A good deal,\" said the girl, in a graver tone. \"I can't just 'splain\r\nthe diff'rence, but it's there. And, anyhow, we never eat such dreadful\r\nthings as _bugs_.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you eat the chickens that eat the bugs,\" retorted the yellow hen,\r\nwith an odd cackle. \"So you are just as bad as we chickens are.\"\r\n\r\nThis made Dorothy thoughtful. What Billina said was true enough, and it\r\nalmost took away her appetite for breakfast. As for the yellow hen, she\r\ncontinued to peck away at the sand busily, and seemed quite contented\r\nwith her bill-of-fare.\r\n\r\nFinally, down near the water's edge, Billina stuck her bill deep into\r\nthe sand, and then drew back and shivered.\r\n\r\n\"Ow!\" she cried. \"I struck metal, that time, and it nearly broke my\r\nbeak.\"\r\n\r\n\"It prob'bly was a rock,\" said Dorothy, carelessly.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense. I know a rock from metal, I guess,\" said the hen. \"There's a\r\ndifferent feel to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there couldn't be any metal on this wild, deserted seashore,\"\r\npersisted the girl. \"Where's the place? I'll dig it up, and prove to you\r\nI'm right.\"\r\n\r\nBillina showed her the place where she had \"stubbed her bill,\" as she\r\nexpressed it, and Dorothy dug away the sand until she felt something\r\nhard. Then, thrusting in her hand, she pulled the thing out, and\r\ndiscovered it to be a large sized golden key--rather old, but still\r\nbright and of perfect shape.\r\n\r\n\"What did I tell you?\" cried the hen, with a cackle of triumph. \"Can I\r\ntell metal when I bump into it, or is the thing a rock?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's metal, sure enough,\" answered the child, gazing thoughtfully at\r\nthe curious thing she had found. \"I think it is pure gold, and it must\r\nhave lain hidden in the sand for a long time. How do you suppose it came\r\nthere, Billina? And what do you suppose this mysterious key unlocks?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't say,\" replied the hen. \"You ought to know more about locks and\r\nkeys than I do.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy glanced around. There was no sign of any house in that part of\r\nthe country, and she reasoned that every key must fit a lock and every\r\nlock must have a purpose. Perhaps the key had been lost by somebody who\r\nlived far away, but had wandered on this very shore.\r\n\r\nMusing on these things the girl put the key in the pocket of her dress\r\nand then slowly drew on her shoes and stockings, which the sun had fully\r\ndried.\r\n\r\n\"I b'lieve, Billina,\" she said, \"I'll have a look 'round, and see if I\r\ncan find some breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters in the Sand\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nWalking a little way back from the water's edge, toward the grove of\r\ntrees, Dorothy came to a flat stretch of white sand that seemed to have\r\nqueer signs marked upon its surface, just as one would write upon sand\r\nwith a stick.\r\n\r\n\"What does it say?\" she asked the yellow hen, who trotted along beside\r\nher in a rather dignified fashion.\r\n\r\n\"How should I know?\" returned the hen. \"I cannot read.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Can't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not; I've never been to school, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have,\" admitted Dorothy; \"but the letters are big and far\r\napart, and it's hard to spell out the words.\"\r\n\r\nBut she looked at each letter carefully, and finally discovered that\r\nthese words were written in the sand:\r\n\r\n    \"BEWARE THE WHEELERS!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's rather strange,\" declared the hen, when Dorothy had read aloud\r\nthe words. \"What do you suppose the Wheelers are?\"\r\n\r\n\"Folks that wheel, I guess. They must have wheelbarrows, or baby-cabs or\r\nhand-carts,\" said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps they're automobiles,\" suggested the yellow hen. \"There is no\r\nneed to beware of baby-cabs and wheelbarrows; but automobiles are\r\ndangerous things. Several of my friends have been run over by them.\"\r\n\r\n\"It can't be auto'biles,\" replied the girl, \"for this is a new, wild\r\ncountry, without even trolley-cars or tel'phones. The people here havn't\r\nbeen discovered yet, I'm sure; that is, if there _are_ any people. So I\r\ndon't b'lieve there _can_ be any auto'biles, Billina.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not,\" admitted the yellow hen. \"Where are you going now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Over to those trees, to see if I can find some fruit or nuts,\" answered\r\nDorothy.\r\n\r\nShe tramped across the sand, skirting the foot of one of the little\r\nrocky hills that stood near, and soon reached the edge of the forest.\r\n\r\nAt first she was greatly disappointed, because the nearer trees were all\r\npunita, or cotton-wood or eucalyptus, and bore no fruit or nuts at all.\r\nBut, bye and bye, when she was almost in despair, the little girl came\r\nupon two trees that promised to furnish her with plenty of food.\r\n\r\nOne was quite full of square paper boxes, which grew in clusters on all\r\nthe limbs, and upon the biggest and ripest boxes the word \"Lunch\" could\r\nbe read, in neat raised letters. This tree seemed to bear all the year\r\naround, for there were lunch-box blossoms on some of the branches, and\r\non others tiny little lunch-boxes that were as yet quite green, and\r\nevidently not fit to eat until they had grown bigger.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of this tree were all paper napkins, and it presented a very\r\npleasing appearance to the hungry little girl.\r\n\r\nBut the tree next to the lunch-box tree was even more wonderful, for it\r\nbore quantities of tin dinner-pails, which were so full and heavy that\r\nthe stout branches bent underneath their weight. Some were small and\r\ndark-brown in color; those larger were of a dull tin color; but the\r\nreally ripe ones were pails of bright tin that shone and glistened\r\nbeautifully in the rays of sunshine that touched them.\r\n\r\nDorothy was delighted, and even the yellow hen acknowledged that she was\r\nsurprised.\r\n\r\nThe little girl stood on tip-toe and picked one of the nicest and\r\nbiggest lunch-boxes, and then she sat down upon the ground and eagerly\r\nopened it. Inside she found, nicely wrapped in white papers, a ham\r\nsandwich, a piece of sponge-cake, a pickle, a slice of new cheese and an\r\napple. Each thing had a separate stem, and so had to be picked off the\r\nside of the box; but Dorothy found them all to be delicious, and she ate\r\nevery bit of luncheon in the box before she had finished.\r\n\r\n\"A lunch isn't zactly breakfast,\" she said to Billina, who sat beside\r\nher curiously watching. \"But when one is hungry one can eat even supper\r\nin the morning, and not complain.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope your lunch-box was perfectly ripe,\" observed the yellow hen, in\r\nan anxious tone. \"So much sickness is caused by eating green things.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LITTLE GIRL PICKED ONE OF THE LUNCH-BOXES]\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure it was ripe,\" declared Dorothy, \"all, that is, 'cept the\r\npickle, and a pickle just _has_ to be green, Billina. But everything\r\ntasted perfectly splendid, and I'd rather have it than a church picnic.\r\nAnd now I think I'll pick a dinner-pail, to have when I get hungry\r\nagain, and then we'll start out and 'splore the country, and see where\r\nwe are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Havn't you any idea what country this is?\" inquired Billina.\r\n\r\n\"None at all. But listen: I'm quite sure it's a fairy country, or such\r\nthings as lunch-boxes and dinner-pails wouldn't be growing upon trees.\r\nBesides, Billina, being a hen, you wouldn't be able to talk in any\r\nciv'lized country, like Kansas, where no fairies live at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we're in the Land of Oz,\" said the hen, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"No, that can't be,\" answered the little girl; \"because I've been to the\r\nLand of Oz, and it's all surrounded by a horrid desert that no one can\r\ncross.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how did you get away from there again?\" asked Billina.\r\n\r\n\"I had a pair of silver shoes, that carried me through the air; but I\r\nlost them,\" said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, indeed,\" remarked the yellow hen, in a tone of unbelief.\r\n\r\n\"Anyhow,\" resumed the girl, \"there is no seashore near the Land of Oz,\r\nso this must surely be some other fairy country.\"\r\n\r\nWhile she was speaking she selected a bright and pretty dinner-pail\r\nthat seemed to have a stout handle, and picked it from its branch. Then,\r\naccompanied by the yellow hen, she walked out of the shadow of the trees\r\ntoward the sea-shore.\r\n\r\nThey were part way across the sands when Billina suddenly cried, in a\r\nvoice of terror:\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDorothy turned quickly around, and saw coming out of a path that led\r\nfrom between the trees the most peculiar person her eyes had ever\r\nbeheld.\r\n\r\nIt had the form of a man, except that it walked, or rather rolled, upon\r\nall fours, and its legs were the same length as its arms, giving them\r\nthe appearance of the four legs of a beast. Yet it was no beast that\r\nDorothy had discovered, for the person was clothed most gorgeously in\r\nembroidered garments of many colors, and wore a straw hat perched\r\njauntily upon the side of its head. But it differed from human beings in\r\nthis respect, that instead of hands and feet there grew at the end of\r\nits arms and legs round wheels, and by means of these wheels it rolled\r\nvery swiftly over the level ground. Afterward Dorothy found that these\r\nodd wheels were of the same hard substance that our finger-nails and\r\ntoe-nails are composed of, and she also learned that creatures of this\r\nstrange race were born in this queer fashion. But when our little girl\r\nfirst caught sight of the first individual of a race that was destined\r\nto cause her a lot of trouble, she had an idea that the\r\nbrilliantly-clothed personage was on roller-skates, which were attached\r\nto his hands as well as to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Run!\" screamed the yellow hen, fluttering away in great fright. \"It's a\r\nWheeler!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"IT'S A WHEELER!\"]\r\n\r\n\"A Wheeler?\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"What can that be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you remember the warning in the sand: 'Beware the Wheelers'? Run,\r\nI tell you--run!\"\r\n\r\nSo Dorothy ran, and the Wheeler gave a sharp, wild cry and came after\r\nher in full chase.\r\n\r\nLooking over her shoulder as she ran, the girl now saw a great\r\nprocession of Wheelers emerging from the forest--dozens and dozens of\r\nthem--all clad in splendid, tight-fitting garments and all rolling\r\nswiftly toward her and uttering their wild, strange cries.\r\n\r\n\"They're sure to catch us!\" panted the girl, who was still carrying the\r\nheavy dinner-pail she had picked. \"I can't run much farther, Billina.\"\r\n\r\n\"Climb up this hill,--quick!\" said the hen; and Dorothy found she was\r\nvery near to the heap of loose and jagged rocks they had passed on their\r\nway to the forest. The yellow hen was even now fluttering among the\r\nrocks, and Dorothy followed as best she could, half climbing and half\r\ntumbling up the rough and rugged steep.\r\n\r\nShe was none too soon, for the foremost Wheeler reached the hill a\r\nmoment after her; but while the girl scrambled up the rocks the creature\r\nstopped short with howls of rage and disappointment.\r\n\r\nDorothy now heard the yellow hen laughing, in her cackling, henny way.\r\n\r\n\"Don't hurry, my dear,\" cried Billina. \"They can't follow us among these\r\nrocks, so we're safe enough now.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy stopped at once and sat down upon a broad boulder, for she was\r\nall out of breath.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the Wheelers had now reached the foot of the hill, but it\r\nwas evident that their wheels would not roll upon the rough and jagged\r\nrocks, and therefore they were helpless to follow Dorothy and the hen to\r\nwhere they had taken refuge. But they circled all around the little\r\nhill, so the child and Billina were fast prisoners and could not come\r\ndown without being captured.\r\n\r\nThen the creatures shook their front wheels at Dorothy in a threatening\r\nmanner, and it seemed they were able to speak as well as to make their\r\ndreadful outcries, for several of them shouted:\r\n\r\n\"We'll get you in time, never fear! And when we do get you, we'll tear\r\nyou into little bits!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why are you so cruel to me?\" asked Dorothy. \"I'm a stranger in your\r\ncountry, and have done you no harm.\"\r\n\r\n\"No harm!\" cried one who seemed to be their leader. \"Did you not pick\r\nour lunch-boxes and dinner-pails? Have you not a stolen dinner-pail\r\nstill in your hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"I only picked one of each,\" she answered. \"I was hungry, and I didn't\r\nknow the trees were yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is no excuse,\" retorted the leader, who was clothed in a most\r\ngorgeous suit. \"It is the law here that whoever picks a dinner-pail\r\nwithout our permission must die immediately.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you believe him,\" said Billina. \"I'm sure the trees do not belong\r\nto these awful creatures. They are fit for any mischief, and it's my\r\nopinion they would try to kill us just the same if you hadn't picked a\r\ndinner-pail.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so, too,\" agreed Dorothy. \"But what shall we do now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay where we are,\" advised the yellow hen. \"We are safe from the\r\nWheelers until we starve to death, anyhow; and before that time comes a\r\ngood many things can happen.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTiktok the Machine Man\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter an hour or so most of the band of Wheelers rolled back into the\r\nforest, leaving only three of their number to guard the hill. These\r\ncurled themselves up like big dogs and pretended to go to sleep on the\r\nsands; but neither Dorothy nor Billina were fooled by this trick, so\r\nthey remained in security among the rocks and paid no attention to their\r\ncunning enemies.\r\n\r\nFinally the hen, fluttering over the mound, exclaimed: \"Why, here's a\r\npath!\"\r\n\r\nSo Dorothy at once clambered to where Billina sat, and there, sure\r\nenough, was a smooth path cut between the rocks. It seemed to wind\r\naround the mound from top to bottom, like a cork-screw, twisting here\r\nand there between the rough boulders but always remaining level and easy\r\nto walk upon.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Dorothy wondered at first why the Wheelers did not roll up this\r\npath; but when she followed it to the foot of the mound she found that\r\nseveral big pieces of rock had been placed directly across the end of\r\nthe way, thus preventing any one outside from seeing it and also\r\npreventing the Wheelers from using it to climb up the mound.\r\n\r\nThen Dorothy walked back up the path, and followed it until she came to\r\nthe very top of the hill, where a solitary round rock stood that was\r\nbigger than any of the others surrounding it. The path came to an end\r\njust beside this great rock, and for a moment it puzzled the girl to\r\nknow why the path had been made at all. But the hen, who had been\r\ngravely following her around and was now perched upon a point of rock\r\nbehind Dorothy, suddenly remarked:\r\n\r\n\"It looks something like a door, doesn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"What looks like a door?\" enquired the child.\r\n\r\n\"Why, that crack in the rock, just facing you,\" replied Billina, whose\r\nlittle round eyes were very sharp and seemed to see everything. \"It runs\r\nup one side and down the other, and across the top and the bottom.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"What does?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, the crack. So I think it must be a door of rock, although I do not\r\nsee any hinges.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Dorothy, now observing for the first time the crack in\r\nthe rock. \"And isn't this a key-hole, Billina?\" pointing to a round,\r\ndeep hole at one side of the door.\r\n\r\n\"Of course. If we only had the key, now, we could unlock it and see\r\nwhat is there,\" replied the yellow hen. \"May be it's a treasure chamber\r\nfull of diamonds and rubies, or heaps of shining gold, or----\"\r\n\r\n\"That reminds me,\" said Dorothy, \"of the golden key I picked up on the\r\nshore. Do you think that it would fit this key-hole, Billina?\"\r\n\r\n\"Try it and see,\" suggested the hen.\r\n\r\nSo Dorothy searched in the pocket of her dress and found the golden key.\r\nAnd when she had put it into the hole of the rock, and turned it, a\r\nsudden sharp snap was heard; then, with a solemn creak that made the\r\nshivers run down the child's back, the face of the rock fell outward,\r\nlike a door on hinges, and revealed a small dark chamber just inside.\r\n\r\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Dorothy, shrinking back as far as the narrow path\r\nwould let her.\r\n\r\nFor, standing within the narrow chamber of rock, was the form of a\r\nman--or, at least, it seemed like a man, in the dim light. He was only\r\nabout as tall as Dorothy herself, and his body was round as a ball and\r\nmade out of burnished copper. Also his head and limbs were copper, and\r\nthese were jointed or hinged to his body in a peculiar way, with metal\r\ncaps over the joints, like the armor worn by knights in days of old. He\r\nstood perfectly still, and where the light struck upon his form it\r\nglittered as if made of pure gold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THIS COPPER MAN IS NOT ALIVE AT ALL\"]\r\n\r\n\"Don't be frightened,\" called Billina, from her perch. \"It isn't alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see it isn't,\" replied the girl, drawing a long breath.\r\n\r\n\"It is only made out of copper, like the old kettle in the barn-yard at\r\nhome,\" continued the hen, turning her head first to one side and then to\r\nthe other, so that both her little round eyes could examine the object.\r\n\r\n\"Once,\" said Dorothy, \"I knew a man made out of tin, who was a woodman\r\nnamed Nick Chopper. But he was as alive as we are, 'cause he was born a\r\nreal man, and got his tin body a little at a time--first a leg and then\r\na finger and then an ear--for the reason that he had so many accidents\r\nwith his axe, and cut himself up in a very careless manner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said the hen, with a sniff, as if she did not believe the story.\r\n\r\n\"But this copper man,\" continued Dorothy, looking at it with big eyes,\r\n\"is not alive at all, and I wonder what it was made for, and why it was\r\nlocked up in this queer place.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a mystery,\" remarked the hen, twisting her head to arrange her\r\nwing-feathers with her bill.\r\n\r\nDorothy stepped inside the little room to get a back view of the copper\r\nman, and in this way discovered a printed card that hung between his\r\nshoulders, it being suspended from a small copper peg at the back of his\r\nneck. She unfastened this card and returned to the path, where the light\r\nwas better, and sat herself down upon a slab of rock to read the\r\nprinting.\r\n\r\n\"What does it say?\" asked the hen, curiously.\r\n\r\nDorothy read the card aloud, spelling out the big words with some\r\ndifficulty; and this is what she read:\r\n\r\n\r\n    SMITH & TINKER'S\r\n\r\n    Patent Double-Action, Extra-Responsive,\r\n    Thought-Creating, Perfect-Talking\r\n\r\n    MECHANICAL MAN\r\n\r\n    Fitted with our Special Clock-Work Attachment.\r\n    Thinks, Speaks, Acts, and Does Everything but Live.\r\n\r\n    Manufactured only at our Works at Evna, Land of Ev.\r\n    All infringements will be promptly Prosecuted according to Law.\r\n\r\n\"How queer!\" said the yellow hen. \"Do you think that is all true, my\r\ndear?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" answered Dorothy, who had more to read. \"Listen to this,\r\nBillina:\"\r\n\r\n    DIRECTIONS FOR USING:\r\n\r\n    For THINKING:--Wind the Clock-work Man under his\r\n    left arm, (marked No. 1.)\r\n\r\n    For SPEAKING:--Wind the Clock-work Man under his\r\n    right arm, (marked No. 2.)\r\n\r\n    For WALKING and ACTION:--Wind Clock-work in the\r\n    middle of his back, (marked No. 3.)\r\n\r\n    N. B.--This Mechanism is guaranteed to work perfectly for a thousand\r\n    years.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I declare!\" gasped the yellow hen, in amazement; \"if the copper\r\nman can do half of these things he is a very wonderful machine. But I\r\nsuppose it is all humbug, like so many other patented articles.\"\r\n\r\n\"We might wind him up,\" suggested Dorothy, \"and see what he'll do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is the key to the clock-work?\" asked Billina.\r\n\r\n\"Hanging on the peg where I found the card.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the hen, \"let us try him, and find out if he will go. He is\r\nwarranted for a thousand years, it seems; but we do not know how long he\r\nhas been standing inside this rock.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy had already taken the clock key from the peg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOROTHY WOUND UP NUMBER ONE]\r\n\r\n\"Which shall I wind up first?\" she asked, looking again at the\r\ndirections on the card.\r\n\r\n\"Number One, I should think,\" returned Billina. \"That makes him think,\r\ndoesn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Dorothy, and wound up Number One, under the left arm.\r\n\r\n\"He doesn't seem any different,\" remarked the hen, critically.\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course not; he is only thinking, now,\" said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what he is thinking about.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll wind up his talk, and then perhaps he can tell us,\" said the girl.\r\n\r\nSo she wound up Number Two, and immediately the clock-work man said,\r\nwithout moving any part of his body except his lips:\r\n\r\n\"Good morn-ing, lit-tle girl. Good morn-ing, Mrs. Hen.\"\r\n\r\nThe words sounded a little hoarse and creakey, and they were uttered all\r\nin the same tone, without any change of expression whatever; but both\r\nDorothy and Billina understood them perfectly.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, sir,\" they answered, politely.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for res-cu-ing me,\" continued the machine, in the same\r\nmonotonous voice, which seemed to be worked by bellows inside of him,\r\nlike the little toy lambs and cats the children squeeze so that they\r\nwill make a noise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Don't mention it,\" answered Dorothy. And then, being very curious, she\r\nasked: \"How did you come to be locked up in this place?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a long sto-ry,\" replied the copper man; \"but I will tell it to\r\nyou brief-ly. I was pur-chased from Smith & Tin-ker, my\r\nman-u-fac-tur-ers, by a cru-el King of Ev, named Ev-ol-do, who used to\r\nbeat all his serv-ants un-til they died. How-ev-er, he was not a-ble to\r\nkill me, be-cause I was not a-live, and one must first live in or-der to\r\ndie. So that all his beat-ing did me no harm, and mere-ly kept my\r\ncop-per bod-y well pol-ished.\r\n\r\n\"This cru-el king had a love-ly wife and ten beau-ti-ful chil-dren--five\r\nboys and five girls--but in a fit of an-ger he sold them all to the Nome\r\nKing, who by means of his mag-ic arts changed them all in-to oth-er\r\nforms and put them in his un-der-ground pal-ace to or-na-ment the rooms.\r\n\r\n\"Af-ter-ward the King of Ev re-gret-ted his wick-ed ac-tion, and tried\r\nto get his wife and chil-dren a-way from the Nome King, but with-out\r\na-vail. So, in de-spair, he locked me up in this rock, threw the key\r\nin-to the o-cean, and then jumped in af-ter it and was drowned.\"\r\n\r\n\"How very dreadful!\" exclaimed Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"It is, in-deed,\" said the machine. \"When I found my-self im-pris-oned I\r\nshout-ed for help un-til my voice ran down; and then I walked back and\r\nforth in this lit-tle room un-til my ac-tion ran down; and then I stood\r\nstill and thought un-til my thoughts ran down. Af-ter that I re-mem-ber\r\nnoth-ing un-til you wound me up a-gain.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a very wonderful story,\" said Dorothy, \"and proves that the Land\r\nof Ev is really a fairy land, as I thought it was.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COPPER MAN WALKED OUT OF THE ROCKY CAVERN]\r\n\r\n\"Of course it is,\" answered the copper man. \"I do not sup-pose such a\r\nper-fect ma-chine as I am could be made in an-y place but a fair-y\r\nland.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've never seen one in Kansas,\" said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"But where did you get the key to un-lock this door?\" asked the\r\nclock-work voice.\r\n\r\n\"I found it on the shore, where it was prob'ly washed up by the waves,\"\r\nshe answered. \"And now, sir, if you don't mind, I'll wind up your\r\naction.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will please me ve-ry much,\" said the machine.\r\n\r\nSo she wound up Number Three, and at once the copper man in a somewhat\r\nstiff and jerky fashion walked out of the rocky cavern, took off his\r\ncopper hat and bowed politely, and then kneeled before Dorothy. Said he:\r\n\r\n\"From this time forth I am your o-be-di-ent ser-vant. What-ev-er you\r\ncom-mand, that I will do will-ing-ly--if you keep me wound up.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your name?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Tik-tok,\" he replied. \"My for-mer mas-ter gave me that name be-cause my\r\nclock-work al-ways ticks when it is wound up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can hear it now,\" said the yellow hen.\r\n\r\n\"So can I,\" said Dorothy. And then she added, with some anxiety: \"You\r\ndon't strike, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Tiktok; \"and there is no a-larm con-nec-ted with my\r\nma-chin-er-y. I can tell the time, though, by speak-ing, and as I nev-er\r\nsleep I can wak-en you at an-y hour you wish to get up in the morn-ing.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's nice,\" said the little girl; \"only I never wish to get up in the\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can sleep until I lay my egg,\" said the yellow hen. \"Then, when I\r\ncackle, Tiktok will know it is time to waken you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you lay your egg very early?\" asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"About eight o'clock,\" said Billina. \"And everybody ought to be up by\r\nthat time, I'm sure.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDorothy Opens the Dinner Pail\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Now Tiktok,\" said Dorothy, \"the first thing to be done is to find a way\r\nfor us to escape from these rocks. The Wheelers are down below, you\r\nknow, and threaten to kill us.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no rea-son to be a-fraid of the Wheel-ers,\" said Tiktok, the\r\nwords coming more slowly than before.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Be-cause they are ag-g-g--gr-gr-r-r-\"\r\n\r\nHe gave a sort of gurgle and stopped short, waving his hands frantically\r\nuntil suddenly he became motionless, with one arm in the air and the\r\nother held stiffly before him with all the copper fingers of the hand\r\nspread out like a fan.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" said Dorothy, in a frightened tone. \"What can the matter be?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's run down, I suppose,\" said the hen, calmly. \"You couldn't have\r\nwound him up very tight.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know how much to wind him,\" replied the girl; \"but I'll try to\r\ndo better next time.\"\r\n\r\nShe ran around the copper man to take the key from the peg at the back\r\nof his neck, but it was not there.\r\n\r\n\"It's gone!\" cried Dorothy, in dismay.\r\n\r\n\"What's gone?\" asked Billina.\r\n\r\n\"The key.\"\r\n\r\n\"It probably fell off when he made that low bow to you,\" returned the\r\nhen. \"Look around, and see if you cannot find it again.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy looked, and the hen helped her, and by and by the girl\r\ndiscovered the clock-key, which had fallen into a crack of the rock.\r\n\r\nAt once she wound up Tiktok's voice, taking care to give the key as many\r\nturns as it would go around. She found this quite a task, as you may\r\nimagine if you have ever tried to wind a clock, but the machine man's\r\nfirst words were to assure Dorothy that he would now run for at least\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n\"You did not wind me much, at first,\" he calmly said, \"and I told you\r\nthat long sto-ry a-bout King Ev-ol-do; so it is no won-der that I ran\r\ndown.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nShe next rewound the action clock-work, and then Billina advised her to\r\ncarry the key to Tiktok in her pocket, so it would not get lost again.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said Dorothy, when all this was accomplished, \"tell me what\r\nyou were going to say about the Wheelers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, they are noth-ing to be fright-en'd at,\" said the machine. \"They\r\ntry to make folks be-lieve that they are ver-y ter-ri-ble, but as a\r\nmat-ter of fact the Wheel-ers are harm-less e-nough to an-y one that\r\ndares to fight them. They might try to hurt a lit-tle girl like you,\r\nper-haps, be-cause they are ver-y mis-chiev-ous. But if I had a club\r\nthey would run a-way as soon as they saw me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Haven't you a club?\" asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Tiktok.\r\n\r\n\"And you won't find such a thing among these rocks, either,\" declared\r\nthe yellow hen.\r\n\r\n\"Then what shall we do?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Wind up my think-works tight-ly, and I will try to think of some oth-er\r\nplan,\" said Tiktok.\r\n\r\nSo Dorothy rewound his thought machinery, and while he was thinking she\r\ndecided to eat her dinner. Billina was already pecking away at the\r\ncracks in the rocks, to find something to eat, so Dorothy sat down and\r\nopened her tin dinner-pail.\r\n\r\nIn the cover she found a small tank that was full of very nice lemonade.\r\nIt was covered by a cup, which might also, when removed, be used to\r\ndrink the lemonade from. Within the pail were three slices of turkey,\r\ntwo slices of cold tongue, some lobster salad, four slices of bread and\r\nbutter, a small custard pie, an orange and nine large strawberries, and\r\nsome nuts and raisins. Singularly enough, the nuts in this dinner-pail\r\ngrew already cracked, so that Dorothy had no trouble in picking out\r\ntheir meats to eat.\r\n\r\nShe spread the feast upon the rock beside her and began her dinner,\r\nfirst offering some of it to Tiktok, who declined because, as he said,\r\nhe was merely a machine. Afterward she offered to share with Billina,\r\nbut the hen murmured something about \"dead things\" and said she\r\npreferred her bugs and ants.\r\n\r\n\"Do the lunch-box trees and the dinner-pail trees belong to the\r\nWheelers?\" the child asked Tiktok, while engaged in eating her meal.\r\n\r\n\"Of course not,\" he answered. \"They be-long to the roy-al fam-il-y of\r\nEv, on-ly of course there is no roy-al fam-il-y just now be-cause King\r\nEv-ol-do jumped in-to the sea and his wife and ten chil-dren have been\r\ntrans-formed by the Nome King. So there is no one to rule the Land of\r\nEv, that I can think of. Per-haps it is for this rea-son that the\r\nWheel-ers claim the trees for their own, and pick the lunch-eons and\r\ndin-ners to eat them-selves. But they be-long to the King, and you will\r\nfind the roy-al \"E\" stamped up-on the bot-tom of ev-er-y din-ner pail.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy turned the pail over, and at once discovered the royal mark upon\r\nit, as Tiktok had said.\r\n\r\n\"Are the Wheelers the only folks living in the Land of Ev?\" enquired the\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOROTHY OPENED HER TIN DINNER-PAIL]\r\n\r\n\"No; they on-ly in-hab-it a small por-tion of it just back of the\r\nwoods,\" replied the machine. \"But they have al-ways been mis-chiev-ous\r\nand im-per-ti-nent, and my old mas-ter, King Ev-ol-do, used to car-ry a\r\nwhip with him, when he walked out, to keep the crea-tures in or-der.\r\nWhen I was first made the Wheel-ers tried to run o-ver me, and butt me\r\nwith their heads; but they soon found I was built of too sol-id a\r\nma-ter-i-al for them to in-jure.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem very durable,\" said Dorothy. \"Who made you?\"\r\n\r\n\"The firm of Smith & Tin-ker, in the town of Ev-na, where the roy-al\r\npal-ace stands,\" answered Tiktok.\r\n\r\n\"Did they make many of you?\" asked the child.\r\n\r\n\"No; I am the on-ly au-to-mat-ic me-chan-i-cal man they ev-er\r\ncom-plet-ed,\" he replied. \"They were ver-y won-der-ful in-ven-tors, were\r\nmy mak-ers, and quite ar-tis-tic in all they did.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure of that,\" said Dorothy. \"Do they live in the town of Evna\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are both gone,\" replied the machine. \"Mr. Smith was an art-ist, as\r\nwell as an in-vent-or, and he paint-ed a pic-ture of a riv-er which was\r\nso nat-ur-al that, as he was reach-ing a-cross it to paint some flow-ers\r\non the op-po-site bank, he fell in-to the wa-ter and was drowned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry for that!\" exclaimed the little girl.\r\n\r\n\"Mis-ter Tin-ker,\" continued Tiktok, \"made a lad-der so tall that he\r\ncould rest the end of it a-gainst the moon, while he stood on the\r\nhigh-est rung and picked the lit-tle stars to set in the points of the\r\nking's crown. But when he got to the moon Mis-ter Tin-ker found it such\r\na love-ly place that he de-cid-ed to live there, so he pulled up the\r\nlad-der af-ter him and we have nev-er seen him since.\"\r\n\r\n\"He must have been a great loss to this country,\" said Dorothy, who was\r\nby this time eating her custard pie.\r\n\r\n\"He was,\" acknowledged Tiktok. \"Also he is a great loss to me. For if I\r\nshould get out of or-der I do not know of an-y one a-ble to re-pair me,\r\nbe-cause I am so com-pli-cat-ed. You have no i-de-a how full of\r\nma-chin-er-y I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can imagine it,\" said Dorothy, readily.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" continued the machine, \"I must stop talk-ing and be-gin\r\nthink-ing a-gain of a way to es-cape from this rock.\" So he turned\r\nhalfway around, in order to think without being disturbed.\r\n\r\n\"The best thinker I ever knew,\" said Dorothy to the yellow hen, \"was a\r\nscarecrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" snapped Billina.\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" declared Dorothy. \"I met him in the Land of Oz, and he\r\ntravelled with me to the city of the great Wizard of Oz, so as to get\r\nsome brains, for his head was only stuffed with straw. But it seemed to\r\nme that he thought just as well before he got his brains as he did\r\nafterward.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you expect me to believe all that rubbish about the Land of Oz?\"\r\nenquired Billina, who seemed a little cross--perhaps because bugs were\r\nscarce.\r\n\r\n\"What rubbish?\" asked the child, who was now finishing her nuts and\r\nraisins.\r\n\r\n\"Why, your impossible stories about animals that can talk, and a tin\r\nwoodman who is alive, and a scarecrow who can think.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are all there,\" said Dorothy, \"for I have seen them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it!\" cried the hen, with a toss of her head.\r\n\r\n\"That's 'cause you're so ign'rant,\" replied the girl, who was a little\r\noffended at her friend Billina's speech.\r\n\r\n\"In the Land of Oz,\" remarked Tiktok, turning toward them, \"an-y-thing\r\nis pos-si-ble. For it is a won-der-ful fair-y coun-try.\"\r\n\r\n\"There, Billina! what did I say?\" cried Dorothy. And then she turned to\r\nthe machine and asked in an eager tone: \"Do you know the Land of Oz,\r\nTiktok?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MISTER TINKER VISITS THE MOON]\r\n\r\n\"No; but I have heard a-bout it,\" said the copper man. \"For it is on-ly\r\nsep-a-ra-ted from this Land of Ev by a broad des-ert.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy clapped her hands together delightedly.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad of that!\" she exclaimed. \"It makes me quite happy to be so\r\nnear my old friends. The scarecrow I told you of, Billina, is the King\r\nof the Land of Oz.\"\r\n\r\n\"Par-don me. He is not the king now,\" said Tiktok.\r\n\r\n\"He was when I left there,\" declared Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said Tiktok, \"but there was a rev-o-lu-tion in the Land of Oz,\r\nand the Scare-crow was de-posed by a sol-dier wo-man named Gen-er-al\r\nJin-jur. And then Jin-jur was de-posed by a lit-tle girl named Oz-ma,\r\nwho was the right-ful heir to the throne and now rules the land un-der\r\nthe ti-tle of Oz-ma of Oz.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is news to me,\" said Dorothy, thoughtfully. \"But I s'pose lots of\r\nthings have happened since I left the Land of Oz. I wonder what has\r\nbecome of the Scarecrow, and of the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion.\r\nAnd I wonder who this girl Ozma is, for I never heard of her before.\"\r\n\r\nBut Tiktok did not reply to this. He had turned around again to resume\r\nhis thinking.\r\n\r\nDorothy packed the rest of the food back into the pail, so as not to be\r\nwasteful of good things, and the yellow hen forgot her dignity far\r\nenough to pick up all of the scattered crumbs, which she ate rather\r\ngreedily, although she had so lately pretended to despise the things\r\nthat Dorothy preferred as food.\r\n\r\nBy this time Tiktok approached them with his stiff bow.\r\n\r\n\"Be kind e-nough to fol-low me,\" he said, \"and I will lead you a-way\r\nfrom here to the town of Ev-na, where you will be more com-for-ta-ble,\r\nand also I will pro-tect you from the Wheel-ers.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" answered Dorothy, promptly. \"I'm ready!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Heads of Langwidere\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThey walked slowly down the path between the rocks, Tiktok going first,\r\nDorothy following him, and the yellow hen trotting along last of all.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the path the copper man leaned down and tossed aside with\r\nease the rocks that cumbered the way. Then he turned to Dorothy and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Let me car-ry your din-ner-pail.\"\r\n\r\nShe placed it in his right hand at once, and the copper fingers closed\r\nfirmly over the stout handle.\r\n\r\nThen the little procession marched out upon the level sands.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the three Wheelers who were guarding the mound saw them, they\r\nbegan to shout their wild cries and rolled swiftly toward the little\r\ngroup, as if to capture them or bar their way. But when the foremost had\r\napproached near enough, Tiktok swung the tin dinner-pail and struck the\r\nWheeler a sharp blow over its head with the queer weapon. Perhaps it did\r\nnot hurt very much, but it made a great noise, and the Wheeler uttered a\r\nhowl and tumbled over upon its side. The next minute it scrambled to its\r\nwheels and rolled away as fast as it could go, screeching with fear at\r\nthe same time.\r\n\r\n\"I told you they were harm-less,\" began Tiktok; but before he could say\r\nmore another Wheeler was upon them. Crack! went the dinner-pail against\r\nits head, knocking its straw hat a dozen feet away; and that was enough\r\nfor this Wheeler, also. It rolled away after the first one, and the\r\nthird did not wait to be pounded with the pail, but joined its fellows\r\nas quickly as its wheels would whirl.\r\n\r\nThe yellow hen gave a cackle of delight, and flying to a perch upon\r\nTiktok's shoulder, she said:\r\n\r\n\"Bravely done, my copper friend! and wisely thought of, too. Now we are\r\nfree from those ugly creatures.\"\r\n\r\nBut just then a large band of Wheelers rolled from the forest, and\r\nrelying upon their numbers to conquer, they advanced fiercely upon\r\nTiktok. Dorothy grabbed Billina in her arms and held her tight, and the\r\nmachine embraced the form of the little girl with his left arm, the\r\nbetter to protect her. Then the Wheelers were upon them.\r\n\r\nRattlety, bang! bang! went the dinner-pail in every direction, and it\r\nmade so much clatter bumping against the heads of the Wheelers that they\r\nwere much more frightened than hurt and fled in a great panic. All, that\r\nis, except their leader. This Wheeler had stumbled against another and\r\nfallen flat upon his back, and before he could get his wheels under him\r\nto rise again, Tiktok had fastened his copper fingers into the neck of\r\nthe gorgeous jacket of his foe and held him fast.\r\n\r\n\"Tell your peo-ple to go a-way,\" commanded the machine.\r\n\r\nThe leader of the Wheelers hesitated to give this order, so Tiktok shook\r\nhim as a terrier dog does a rat, until the Wheeler's teeth rattled\r\ntogether with a noise like hailstones on a window pane. Then, as soon as\r\nthe creature could get its breath, it shouted to the others to roll\r\naway, which they immediately did.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Tiktok, \"you shall come with us and tell me what I want to\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"You'll be sorry for treating me in this way,\" whined the Wheeler. \"I'm\r\na terribly fierce person.\"\r\n\r\n\"As for that,\" answered Tiktok, \"I am only a ma-chine, and can-not feel\r\nsor-row or joy, no mat-ter what hap-pens. But you are wrong to think\r\nyour-self ter-ri-ble or fierce.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so?\" asked the Wheeler.\r\n\r\n\"Be-cause no one else thinks as you do. Your wheels make you help-less\r\nto in-jure an-y one. For you have no fists and can not scratch or e-ven\r\npull hair. Nor have you an-y feet to kick with. All you can do is to\r\nyell and shout, and that does not hurt an-y one at all.\"\r\n\r\nThe Wheeler burst into a flood of tears, to Dorothy's great surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Now I and my people are ruined forever!\" he sobbed; \"for you have\r\ndiscovered our secret. Being so helpless, our only hope is to make\r\npeople afraid of us, by pretending we are very fierce and terrible, and\r\nwriting in the sand warnings to Beware the Wheelers. Until now we have\r\nfrightened everyone, but since you have discovered our weakness our\r\nenemies will fall upon us and make us very miserable and unhappy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" exclaimed Dorothy, who was sorry to see this beautifully\r\ndressed Wheeler so miserable; \"Tiktok will keep your secret, and so will\r\nBillina and I. Only, you must promise not to try to frighten children\r\nany more, if they come near to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't--indeed I won't!\" promised the Wheeler, ceasing to cry and\r\nbecoming more cheerful. \"I'm not really bad, you know; but we have to\r\npretend to be terrible in order to prevent others from attacking us.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON THE WAY TO THE ROYAL PALACE OF EV]\r\n\r\n\"That is not ex-act-ly true,\" said Tiktok, starting to walk toward the\r\npath through the forest, and still holding fast to his prisoner, who\r\nrolled slowly along beside him. \"You and your peo-ple are full of\r\nmis-chief, and like to both-er those who fear you. And you are of-ten\r\nim-pu-dent and dis-a-gree-a-ble, too. But if you will try to cure those\r\nfaults I will not tell any-one how help-less you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll try, of course,\" replied the Wheeler, eagerly. \"And thank you, Mr.\r\nTiktok, for your kindness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am on-ly a ma-chine,\" said Tiktok. \"I can not be kind an-y more than\r\nI can be sor-ry or glad. I can on-ly do what I am wound up to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you wound up to keep my secret?\" asked the Wheeler, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; if you be-have your-self. But tell me: who rules the Land of Ev\r\nnow?\" asked the machine.\r\n\r\n\"There is no ruler,\" was the answer, \"because every member of the royal\r\nfamily is imprisoned by the Nome King. But the Princess Langwidere, who\r\nis a niece of our late King Evoldo, lives in a part of the royal palace\r\nand takes as much money out of the royal treasury as she can spend. The\r\nPrincess Langwidere is not exactly a ruler, you see, because she doesn't\r\nrule; but she is the nearest approach to a ruler we have at present.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not re-mem-ber her,\" said Tiktok. \"What does she look like?\"\r\n\r\n\"That I cannot say,\" replied the Wheeler, \"although I have seen her\r\ntwenty times. For the Princess Langwidere is a different person every\r\ntime I see her, and the only way her subjects can recognize her at all\r\nis by means of a beautiful ruby key which she always wears on a chain\r\nattached to her left wrist. When we see the key we know we are beholding\r\nthe Princess.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is strange,\" said Dorothy, in astonishment. \"Do you mean to say\r\nthat so many different princesses are one and the same person?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly,\" answered the Wheeler. \"There is, of course, but one\r\nprincess; but she appears to us in many forms, which are all more or\r\nless beautiful.\"\r\n\r\n\"She must be a witch,\" exclaimed the girl.\r\n\r\n\"I do not think so,\" declared the Wheeler. \"But there is some mystery\r\nconnected with her, nevertheless. She is a very vain creature, and lives\r\nmostly in a room surrounded by mirrors, so that she can admire herself\r\nwhichever way she looks.\"\r\n\r\nNo one answered this speech, because they had just passed out of the\r\nforest and their attention was fixed upon the scene before them--a\r\nbeautiful vale in which were many fruit trees and green fields, with\r\npretty farm-houses scattered here and there and broad, smooth roads that\r\nled in every direction.\r\n\r\nIn the center of this lovely vale, about a mile from where our friends\r\nwere standing, rose the tall spires of the royal palace, which glittered\r\nbrightly against their background of blue sky. The palace was surrounded\r\nby charming grounds, full of flowers and shrubbery. Several tinkling\r\nfountains could be seen, and there were pleasant walks bordered by rows\r\nof white marble statuary.\r\n\r\nAll these details Dorothy was, of course, unable to notice or admire\r\nuntil they had advanced along the road to a position quite near to the\r\npalace, and she was still looking at the pretty sights when her little\r\nparty entered the grounds and approached the big front door of the\r\nking's own apartments. To their disappointment they found the door\r\ntightly closed. A sign was tacked to the panel which read as follows:\r\n\r\n     OWNER ABSENT.\r\n\r\n     Please Knock at the Third Door in the Left Wing.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Tiktok to the captive Wheeler, \"you must show us the way to\r\nthe Left Wing.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SIGN WAS TACKED TO THE PANEL]\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" agreed the prisoner, \"it is around here at the right.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can the left wing be at the right?\" demanded Dorothy, who feared\r\nthe Wheeler was fooling them.\r\n\r\n\"Because there used to be three wings, and two were torn down, so the\r\none on the right is the only one left. It is a trick of the Princess\r\nLangwidere to prevent visitors from annoying her.\"\r\n\r\nThen the captive led them around to the wing, after which the machine\r\nman, having no further use for the Wheeler, permitted him to depart and\r\nrejoin his fellows. He immediately rolled away at a great pace and was\r\nsoon lost to sight.\r\n\r\nTiktok now counted the doors in the wing and knocked loudly upon the\r\nthird one.\r\n\r\nIt was opened by a little maid in a cap trimmed with gay ribbons, who\r\nbowed respectfully and asked:\r\n\r\n\"What do you wish, good people?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you the Princess Langwidere?\" asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"No, miss; I am her servant,\" replied the maid.\r\n\r\n\"May I see the Princess, please?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell her you are here, miss, and ask her to grant you an\r\naudience,\" said the maid. \"Step in, please, and take a seat in the\r\ndrawing-room.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSo Dorothy walked in, followed closely by the machine. But as the yellow\r\nhen tried to enter after them, the little maid cried \"Shoo!\" and flapped\r\nher apron in Billina's face.\r\n\r\n\"Shoo, yourself!\" retorted the hen, drawing back in anger and ruffling\r\nup her feathers. \"Haven't you any better manners than that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do you talk?\" enquired the maid, evidently surprised.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you hear me?\" snapped Billina. \"Drop that apron, and get out of\r\nthe doorway, so that I may enter with my friends!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Princess won't like it,\" said the maid, hesitating.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care whether she likes it or not,\" replied Billina, and\r\nfluttering her wings with a loud noise she flew straight at the maid's\r\nface. The little servant at once ducked her head, and the hen reached\r\nDorothy's side, in safety.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" sighed the maid; \"if you are all ruined because of this\r\nobstinate hen, don't blame me for it. It isn't safe to annoy the\r\nPrincess Langwidere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell her we are waiting, if you please,\" Dorothy requested, with\r\ndignity. \"Billina is my friend, and must go wherever I go.\"\r\n\r\nWithout more words the maid led them to a richly furnished drawing-room,\r\nlighted with subdued rainbow tints that came in through beautiful\r\nstained-glass windows.\r\n\r\n\"Remain here,\" she said. \"What names shall I give the Princess?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am Dorothy Gale, of Kansas,\" replied the child; \"and this gentleman\r\nis a machine named Tiktok, and the yellow hen is my friend Billina.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE PRINCESS WONT LIKE IT,\" SAID THE MAID]\r\n\r\nThe little servant bowed and withdrew, going through several passages\r\nand mounting two marble stairways before she came to the apartments\r\noccupied by her mistress.\r\n\r\nPrincess Langwidere's sitting-room was panelled with great mirrors,\r\nwhich reached from the ceiling to the floor; also the ceiling was\r\ncomposed of mirrors, and the floor was of polished silver that reflected\r\nevery object upon it. So when Langwidere sat in her easy chair and\r\nplayed soft melodies upon her mandolin, her form was mirrored hundreds\r\nof times, in walls and ceiling and floor, and whichever way the lady\r\nturned her head she could see and admire her own features. This she\r\nloved to do, and just as the maid entered she was saying to herself:\r\n\r\n\"This head with the auburn hair and hazel eyes is quite attractive. I\r\nmust wear it more often than I have done of late, although it may not be\r\nthe best of my collection.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have company, Your Highness,\" announced the maid, bowing low.\r\n\r\n\"Who is it?\" asked Langwidere, yawning.\r\n\r\n\"Dorothy Gale of Kansas, Mr. Tiktok and Billina,\" answered the maid.\r\n\r\n\"What a queer lot of names!\" murmured the Princess, beginning to be a\r\nlittle interested. \"What are they like? Is Dorothy Gale of Kansas\r\npretty?\"\r\n\r\n\"She might be called so,\" the maid replied.\r\n\r\n\"And is Mr. Tiktok attractive?\" continued the Princess.\r\n\r\n\"That I cannot say, Your Highness. But he seems very bright. Will Your\r\nGracious Highness see them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I may as well, Nanda. But I am tired admiring this head, and if my\r\nvisitor has any claim to beauty I must take care that she does not\r\nsurpass me. So I will go to my cabinet and change to No. 17, which I\r\nthink is my best appearance. Don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your No. 17 is exceedingly beautiful,\" answered Nanda, with another\r\nbow.\r\n\r\nAgain the Princess yawned. Then she said:\r\n\r\n\"Help me to rise.\"\r\n\r\nSo the maid assisted her to gain her feet, although Langwidere was the\r\nstronger of the two; and then the Princess slowly walked across the\r\nsilver floor to her cabinet, leaning heavily at every step upon Nanda's\r\narm.\r\n\r\nNow I must explain to you that the Princess Langwidere had thirty\r\nheads--as many as there are days in the month. But of course she could\r\nonly wear one of them at a time, because she had but one neck. These\r\nheads were kept in what she called her \"cabinet,\" which was a beautiful\r\ndressing-room that lay just between Langwidere's sleeping-chamber and\r\nthe mirrored sitting-room. Each head was in a separate cupboard lined\r\nwith velvet. The cupboards ran all around the sides of the\r\ndressing-room, and had elaborately carved doors with gold numbers on the\r\noutside and jewelled-framed mirrors on the inside of them.\r\n\r\nWhen the Princess got out of her crystal bed in the morning she went to\r\nher cabinet, opened one of the velvet-lined cupboards, and took the head\r\nit contained from its golden shelf. Then, by the aid of the mirror\r\ninside the open door, she put on the head--as neat and straight as could\r\nbe--and afterward called her maids to robe her for the day. She always\r\nwore a simple white costume, that suited all the heads. For, being able\r\nto change her face whenever she liked, the Princess had no interest in\r\nwearing a variety of gowns, as have other ladies who are compelled to\r\nwear the same face constantly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BY THE AID OF THE MIRROR SHE PUT ON THE HEAD]\r\n\r\nOf course the thirty heads were in great variety, no two formed alike\r\nbut all being of exceeding loveliness. There were heads with golden\r\nhair, brown hair, rich auburn hair and black hair; but none with gray\r\nhair. The heads had eyes of blue, of gray, of hazel, of brown and of\r\nblack; but there were no red eyes among them, and all were bright and\r\nhandsome. The noses were Grecian, Roman, retrouss√© and Oriental,\r\nrepresenting all types of beauty; and the mouths were of assorted sizes\r\nand shapes, displaying pearly teeth when the heads smiled. As for\r\ndimples, they appeared in cheeks and chins, wherever they might be most\r\ncharming, and one or two heads had freckles upon the faces to contrast\r\nthe better with the brilliancy of their complexions.\r\n\r\nOne key unlocked all the velvet cupboards containing these treasures--a\r\ncurious key carved from a single blood-red ruby--and this was fastened\r\nto a strong but slender chain which the Princess wore around her left\r\nwrist.\r\n\r\nWhen Nanda had supported Langwidere to a position in front of cupboard\r\nNo. 17, the Princess unlocked the door with her ruby key and after\r\nhanding head No. 9, which she had been wearing, to the maid, she took\r\nNo. 17 from its shelf and fitted it to her neck. It had black hair and\r\ndark eyes and a lovely pearl-and-white complexion, and when Langwidere\r\nwore it she knew she was remarkably beautiful in appearance.\r\n\r\nThere was only one trouble with No. 17; the temper that went with it\r\n(and which was hidden somewhere under the glossy black hair) was fiery,\r\nharsh and haughty in the extreme, and it often led the Princess to do\r\nunpleasant things which she regretted when she came to wear her other\r\nheads.\r\n\r\nBut she did not remember this today, and went to meet her guests in the\r\ndrawing-room with a feeling of certainty that she would surprise them\r\nwith her beauty.\r\n\r\nHowever, she was greatly disappointed to find that her visitors were\r\nmerely a small girl in a gingham dress, a copper man that would only go\r\nwhen wound up, and a yellow hen that was sitting contentedly in\r\nLangwidere's best work-basket, where there was a china egg used for\r\ndarning stockings.[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: It may surprise you to learn that a princess ever does such\r\na common thing as darn stockings. But, if you will stop to think, you\r\nwill realize that a princess is sure to wear holes in her stockings, the\r\nsame as other people; only it isn't considered quite polite to mention\r\nthe matter.]\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Langwidere, slightly lifting the nose of No. 17. \"I thought\r\nsome one of importance had called.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you were right,\" declared Dorothy. \"I'm a good deal of 'portance\r\nmyself, and when Billina lays an egg she has the proudest cackle you\r\never heard. As for Tiktok, he's the----\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop--Stop!\" commanded the Princess, with an angry flash of her\r\nsplendid eyes. \"How dare you annoy me with your senseless chatter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you horrid thing!\" said Dorothy, who was not accustomed to being\r\ntreated so rudely.\r\n\r\nThe Princess looked at her more closely.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" she resumed, \"are you of royal blood?\"\r\n\r\n\"Better than that, ma'am,\" said Dorothy. \"I came from Kansas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh!\" cried the Princess, scornfully. \"You are a foolish child, and I\r\ncannot allow you to annoy me. Run away, you little goose, and bother\r\nsome one else.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy was so indignant that for a moment she could find no words to\r\nreply. But she rose from her chair, and was about to leave the room when\r\nthe Princess, who had been scanning the girl's face, stopped her by\r\nsaying, more gently:\r\n\r\n\"Come nearer to me.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy obeyed, without a thought of fear, and stood before the Princess\r\nwhile Langwidere examined her face with careful attention.\r\n\r\n\"You are rather attractive,\" said the lady, presently. \"Not at all\r\nbeautiful, you understand, but you have a certain style of prettiness\r\nthat is different from that of any of my thirty heads. So I believe I'll\r\ntake your head and give you No. 26 for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I b'lieve you won't!\" exclaimed Dorothy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"WELL I B'LIEVE YOU WONT!\" EXCLAIMED DOROTHY]\r\n\r\n\"It will do you no good to refuse,\" continued the Princess; \"for I\r\nneed your head for my collection, and in the Land of Ev my will is law.\r\nI never have cared much for No. 26, and you will find that it is very\r\nlittle worn. Besides, it will do you just as well as the one you're\r\nwearing, for all practical purposes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know anything about your No. 26, and I don't want to,\" said\r\nDorothy, firmly. \"I'm not used to taking cast-off things, so I'll just\r\nkeep my own head.\"\r\n\r\n\"You refuse?\" cried the Princess, with a frown.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I do,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Langwidere, \"I shall lock you up in a tower until you\r\ndecide to obey me. Nanda,\" turning to her maid, \"call my army.\"\r\n\r\nNanda rang a silver bell, and at once a big fat colonel in a bright red\r\nuniform entered the room, followed by ten lean soldiers, who all looked\r\nsad and discouraged and saluted the princess in a very melancholy\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\n\"Carry that girl to the North Tower and lock her up!\" cried the\r\nPrincess, pointing to Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"To hear is to obey,\" answered the big red colonel, and caught the child\r\nby her arm. But at that moment Tiktok raised his dinner-pail and pounded\r\nit so forcibly against the colonel's head that the big officer sat down\r\nupon the floor with a sudden bump, looking both dazed and very much\r\nastonished.\r\n\r\n\"Help!\" he shouted, and the ten lean soldiers sprang to assist their\r\nleader.\r\n\r\nThere was great excitement for the next few moments, and Tiktok had\r\nknocked down seven of the army, who were sprawling in every direction\r\nupon the carpet, when suddenly the machine paused, with the dinner-pail\r\nraised for another blow, and remained perfectly motionless.\r\n\r\n\"My ac-tion has run down,\" he called to Dorothy. \"Wind me up, quick.\"\r\n\r\nShe tried to obey, but the big colonel had by this time managed to get\r\nupon his feet again, so he grabbed fast hold of the girl and she was\r\nhelpless to escape.\r\n\r\n\"This is too bad,\" said the machine. \"I ought to have run six hours\r\nlon-ger, at least, but I sup-pose my long walk and my fight with the\r\nWheel-ers made me run down fast-er than us-u-al.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it can't be helped,\" said Dorothy, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Will you exchange heads with me?\" demanded the Princess.\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed!\" cried Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Then lock her up,\" said Langwidere to her soldiers, and they led\r\nDorothy to a high tower at the north of the palace and locked her\r\nsecurely within. The soldiers afterward tried to lift Tiktok, but they\r\nfound the machine so solid and heavy that they could not stir it. So\r\nthey left him standing in the center of the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\"People will think I have a new statue,\" said Langwidere, \"so it won't\r\nmatter in the least, and Nanda can keep him well polished.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do with the hen?\" asked the colonel, who had just\r\ndiscovered Billina in the work-basket.\r\n\r\n\"Put her in the chicken-house,\" answered the Princess. \"Some day I'll\r\nhave her fried for breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"She looks rather tough, Your Highness,\" said Nanda, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"That is a base slander!\" cried Billina, struggling frantically in the\r\ncolonel's arms. \"But the breed of chickens I come from is said to be\r\npoison to all princesses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" remarked Langwidere, \"I will not fry the hen, but keep her to\r\nlay eggs; and if she doesn't do her duty I'll have her drowned in the\r\nhorse trough.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOzma of Oz to the Rescue\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nNanda brought Dorothy bread and water for her supper and she slept upon\r\na hard stone couch with a single pillow and a silken coverlet.\r\n\r\nIn the morning she leaned out of the window of her prison in the tower\r\nto see if there was any way to escape. The room was not so very high up,\r\nwhen compared with our modern buildings, but it was far enough above the\r\ntrees and farm houses to give her a good view of the surrounding\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nTo the east she saw the forest, with the sands beyond it and the ocean\r\nbeyond that. There was even a dark speck upon the shore that she\r\nthought might be the chicken-coop in which she had arrived at this\r\nsingular country.\r\n\r\nThen she looked to the north, and saw a deep but narrow valley lying\r\nbetween two rocky mountains, and a third mountain that shut off the\r\nvalley at the further end.\r\n\r\nWestward the fertile Land of Ev suddenly ended a little way from the\r\npalace, and the girl could see miles and miles of sandy desert that\r\nstretched farther than her eyes could reach. It was this desert, she\r\nthought, with much interest, that alone separated her from the wonderful\r\nLand of Oz, and she remembered sorrowfully that she had been told no one\r\nhad ever been able to cross this dangerous waste but herself. Once a\r\ncyclone had carried her across it, and a magical pair of silver shoes\r\nhad carried her back again. But now she had neither a cyclone nor silver\r\nshoes to assist her, and her condition was sad indeed. For she had\r\nbecome the prisoner of a disagreeable princess who insisted that she\r\nmust exchange her head for another one that she was not used to, and\r\nwhich might not fit her at all.\r\n\r\nReally, there seemed no hope of help for her from her old friends in the\r\nLand of Oz. Thoughtfully she gazed from her narrow window. On all the\r\ndesert not a living thing was stirring.\r\n\r\nWait, though! Something surely _was_ stirring on the desert--something\r\nher eyes had not observed at first. Now it seemed like a cloud; now it\r\nseemed like a spot of silver; now it seemed to be a mass of rainbow\r\ncolors that moved swiftly toward her.\r\n\r\nWhat _could_ it be, she wondered?\r\n\r\nThen, gradually, but in a brief space of time nevertheless, the vision\r\ndrew near enough to Dorothy to make out what it was.\r\n\r\nA broad green carpet was unrolling itself upon the desert, while\r\nadvancing across the carpet was a wonderful procession that made the\r\ngirl open her eyes in amazement as she gazed.\r\n\r\nFirst came a magnificent golden chariot, drawn by a great Lion and an\r\nimmense Tiger, who stood shoulder to shoulder and trotted along as\r\ngracefully as a well-matched team of thoroughbred horses. And standing\r\nupright within the chariot was a beautiful girl clothed in flowing robes\r\nof silver gauze and wearing a jeweled diadem upon her dainty head. She\r\nheld in one hand the satin ribbons that guided her astonishing team, and\r\nin the other an ivory wand that separated at the top into two prongs,\r\nthe prongs being tipped by the letters \"O\" and \"Z\", made of glistening\r\ndiamonds set closely together.\r\n\r\nThe girl seemed neither older nor larger than Dorothy herself, and at\r\nonce the prisoner in the tower guessed, that the lovely driver of the\r\nchariot must be that Ozma of Oz of whom she had so lately heard from\r\nTiktok.\r\n\r\nFollowing close behind the chariot Dorothy saw her old friend the\r\nScarecrow, riding calmly astride a wooden Saw-Horse, which pranced and\r\ntrotted as naturally as any meat horse could have done.\r\n\r\nAnd then came Nick Chopper, the Tin Woodman, with his funnel-shaped cap\r\ntipped carelessly over his left ear, his gleaming axe over his right\r\nshoulder, and his whole body sparkling as brightly as it had ever done\r\nin the old days when first she knew him.\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman was on foot, marching at the head of a company of\r\ntwenty-seven soldiers, of whom some were lean and some fat, some short\r\nand some tall; but all the twenty-seven were dressed in handsome\r\nuniforms of various designs and colors, no two being alike in any\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nBehind the soldiers the green carpet rolled itself up again, so that\r\nthere was always just enough of it for the procession to walk upon, in\r\norder that their feet might not come in contact with the deadly,\r\nlife-destroying sands of the desert.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MAGIC CARPET]\r\n\r\nDorothy knew at once it was a magic carpet she beheld, and her heart\r\nbeat high with hope and joy as she realized she was soon to be rescued\r\nand allowed to greet her dearly beloved friends of Oz--the Scarecrow,\r\nthe Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the girl felt herself as good as rescued as soon as she\r\nrecognized those in the procession, for she well knew the courage and\r\nloyalty of her old comrades, and also believed that any others who came\r\nfrom their marvelous country would prove to be pleasant and reliable\r\nacquaintances.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the last bit of desert was passed and all the procession,\r\nfrom the beautiful and dainty Ozma to the last soldier, had reached the\r\ngrassy meadows of the Land of Ev, the magic carpet rolled itself\r\ntogether and entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nThen the chariot driver turned her Lion and Tiger into a broad roadway\r\nleading up to the palace, and the others followed, while Dorothy still\r\ngazed from her tower window in eager excitement.\r\n\r\nThey came quite close to the front door of the palace and then halted,\r\nthe Scarecrow dismounting from his Saw-Horse to approach the sign\r\nfastened to the door, that he might read what it said.\r\n\r\nDorothy, just above him, could keep silent no longer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Here I am!\" she shouted, as loudly as she could. \"Here's Dorothy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dorothy who?\" asked the Scarecrow, tipping his head to look upward\r\nuntil he nearly lost his balance and tumbled over backward.\r\n\r\n\"Dorothy Gale, of course. Your friend from Kansas,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"Why, hello, Dorothy!\" said the Scarecrow. \"What in the world are you\r\ndoing up there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" she called down, \"because there's nothing to do. Save me, my\r\nfriend--save me!\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to be quite safe now,\" replied the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"But I'm a prisoner. I'm locked in, so that I can't get out,\" she\r\npleaded.\r\n\r\n\"That's all right,\" said the Scarecrow. \"You might be worse off, little\r\nDorothy. Just consider the matter. You can't get drowned, or be run over\r\nby a Wheeler, or fall out of an apple-tree. Some folks would think they\r\nwere lucky to be up there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't,\" declared the girl, \"and I want to get down immed'i'tly\r\nand see you and the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said the Scarecrow, nodding. \"It shall be just as you say,\r\nlittle friend. Who locked you up?\"\r\n\r\n\"The princess Langwidere, who is a horrid creature,\" she answered.\r\n\r\nAt this Ozma, who had been listening carefully to the conversation,\r\ncalled to Dorothy from her chariot, asking:\r\n\r\n\"Why did the Princess lock you up, my dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" exclaimed Dorothy, \"I wouldn't let her have my head for her\r\ncollection, and take an old, cast-off head in exchange for it.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"SAVE ME, MY FRIEND--SAVE ME!\"]\r\n\r\n\"I do not blame you,\" exclaimed Ozma, promptly. \"I will see the Princess\r\nat once, and oblige her to liberate you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, thank you very, very much!\" cried Dorothy, who as soon as she heard\r\nthe sweet voice of the girlish Ruler of Oz knew that she would soon\r\nlearn to love her dearly.\r\n\r\nOzma now drove her chariot around to the third door of the wing, upon\r\nwhich the Tin Woodman boldly proceeded to knock.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the maid opened the door Ozma, bearing in her hand her ivory\r\nwand, stepped into the hall and made her way at once to the\r\ndrawing-room, followed by all her company, except the Lion, and the\r\nTiger. And the twenty-seven soldiers made such a noise and a clatter\r\nthat the little maid Nanda ran away screaming to her mistress, whereupon\r\nthe Princess Langwidere, roused to great anger by this rude invasion of\r\nher palace, came running into the drawing-room without any assistance\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nThere she stood before the slight and delicate form of the little girl\r\nfrom Oz and cried out;--\r\n\r\n\"How dare you enter my palace unbidden? Leave this room at once, or I\r\nwill bind you and all your people in chains, and throw you into my\r\ndarkest dungeons!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"What a dangerous lady!\" murmured the Scarecrow, in a soft voice.\r\n\r\n\"She seems a little nervous,\" replied the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\nBut Ozma only smiled at the angry Princess.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, please,\" she said, quietly. \"I have traveled a long way to\r\nsee you, and you must listen to what I have to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Must!\" screamed the Princess, her black eyes flashing with fury--for\r\nshe still wore her No. 17 head. \"Must, to _me_!\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure,\" said Ozma. \"I am Ruler of the Land of Oz, and I am\r\npowerful enough to destroy all your kingdom, if I so wish. Yet I did not\r\ncome here to do harm, but rather to free the royal family of Ev from the\r\nthrall of the Noma King, the news having reached me that he is holding\r\nthe Queen and her children prisoners.\"\r\n\r\nHearing these words, Langwidere suddenly became quiet.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you could, indeed, free my aunt and her ten royal children,\"\r\nsaid she, eagerly. \"For if they were restored to their proper forms and\r\nstation they could rule the Kingdom of Ev themselves, and that would\r\nsave me a lot of worry and trouble. At present there are at least ten\r\nminutes every day that I must devote to affairs of state, and I would\r\nlike to be able to spend my whole time in admiring my beautiful heads.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we will presently discuss this matter,\" said Ozma, \"and try to\r\nfind a way to liberate your aunt and cousins. But first you must\r\nliberate another prisoner--the little girl you have locked up in your\r\ntower.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"WHAT A DANGEROUS LADY!\" MURMURED THE SCARECROW]\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Langwidere, readily. \"I had forgotten all about her.\r\nThat was yesterday, you know, and a Princess cannot be expected to\r\nremember today what she did yesterday. Come with me, and I will release\r\nthe prisoner at once.\"\r\n\r\nSo Ozma followed her, and they passed up the stairs that led to the room\r\nin the tower.\r\n\r\nWhile they were gone Ozma's followers remained in the drawing-room, and\r\nthe Scarecrow was leaning against a form that he had mistaken for a\r\ncopper statue when a harsh, metallic voice said suddenly in his ear:\r\n\r\n\"Get off my foot, please. You are scratch-ing my pol-ish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, excuse me!\" he replied, hastily drawing back. \"Are you alive?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Tiktok, \"I am on-ly a ma-chine. But I can think and speak and\r\nact, when I am pro-per-ly wound up. Just now my ac-tion is run down, and\r\nDor-o-thy has the key to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"Dorothy will soon be free,\r\nand then she'll attend to your works. But it must be a great misfortune\r\nnot to be alive. I'm sorry for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked Tiktok.\r\n\r\n\"Because you have no brains, as I have,\" said the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I have,\" returned Tiktok. \"I am fit-ted with Smith & Tin-ker's\r\nImproved Com-bi-na-tion Steel Brains. They are what make me think. What\r\nsort of brains are you fit-ted with?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" admitted the Scarecrow. \"They were given to me by the\r\ngreat Wizard of Oz, and I didn't get a chance to examine them before he\r\nput them in. But they work splendidly and my conscience is very active.\r\nHave you a conscience?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Tiktok.\r\n\r\n\"And no heart, I suppose?\" added the Tin Woodman, who had been listening\r\nwith interest to this conversation.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Tiktok.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" continued the Tin Woodman, \"I regret to say that you are greatly\r\ninferior to my friend the Scarecrow, and to myself. For we are both\r\nalive, and he has brains which do not need to be wound up, while I have\r\nan excellent heart that is continually beating in my bosom.\"\r\n\r\n\"I con-grat-u-late you,\" replied Tiktok. \"I can-not help be-ing your\r\nin-fer-i-or for I am a mere ma-chine. When I am wound up I do my du-ty\r\nby go-ing just as my ma-chin-er-y is made to go. You have no i-de-a how\r\nfull of ma-chin-er-y I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can guess,\" said the Scarecrow, looking at the machine man curiously.\r\n\"Some day I'd like to take you apart and see just how you are made.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not do that, I beg of you,\" said Tiktok; \"for you could not put me\r\nto-geth-er a-gain, and my use-ful-ness would be de-stroyed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! are you useful?\" asked the Scarecrow, surprised.\r\n\r\n\"Ve-ry,\" said Tiktok.\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" the Scarecrow kindly promised, \"I won't fool with your\r\ninterior at all. For I am a poor mechanic, and might mix you up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Tiktok.\r\n\r\nJust then Ozma re-entered the room, leading Dorothy by the hand and\r\nfollowed closely by the Princess Langwidere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hungry Tiger\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thing Dorothy did was to rush into the embrace of the\r\nScarecrow, whose painted face beamed with delight as he pressed her form\r\nto his straw-padded bosom. Then the Tin Woodman embraced her--very\r\ngently, for he knew his tin arms might hurt her if he squeezed too\r\nroughly.\r\n\r\nThese greetings having been exchanged, Dorothy took the key to Tiktok\r\nfrom her pocket and wound up the machine man's action, so that he could\r\nbow properly when introduced to the rest of the company. While doing\r\nthis she told them now useful Tiktok had been to her, and both the\r\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman shook hands with the machine once more and\r\nthanked him for protecting their friend.\r\n\r\nThen Dorothy asked: \"Where is Billina?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said the Scarecrow. \"Who is Billina?\"\r\n\r\n\"She's a yellow hen who is another friend of mine,\" answered the girl,\r\nanxiously. \"I wonder what has become of her?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is in the chicken house, in the back yard,\" said the Princess. \"My\r\ndrawing-room is no place for hens.\"\r\n\r\nWithout waiting to hear more Dorothy ran to get Billina, and just\r\noutside the door she came upon the Cowardly Lion, still hitched to the\r\nchariot beside the great Tiger. The Cowardly Lion had a big bow of blue\r\nribbon fastened to the long hair between his ears, and the Tiger wore a\r\nbow of red ribbon on his tail, just in front of the bushy end.\r\n\r\nIn an instant Dorothy was hugging the huge Lion joyfully.\r\n\r\n\"I'm _so_ glad to see you again!\" she cried.\r\n\r\n\"I am also glad to see you, Dorothy,\" said the Lion. \"We've had some\r\nfine adventures together, haven't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed,\" she replied. \"How are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"As cowardly as ever,\" the beast answered in a meek voice. \"Every little\r\nthing scares me and makes my heart beat fast. But let me introduce to\r\nyou a new friend of mine, the Hungry Tiger.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Are you hungry?\" she asked, turning to the other beast, who was\r\njust then yawning so widely that he displayed two rows of terrible teeth\r\nand a mouth big enough to startle anyone.\r\n\r\n\"Dreadfully hungry,\" answered the Tiger, snapping his jaws together with\r\na fierce click.\r\n\r\n\"Then why don't you eat something?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"It's no use,\" said the Tiger sadly. \"I've tried that, but I always get\r\nhungry again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it is the same with me,\" said Dorothy. \"Yet I keep on eating.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you eat harmless things, so it doesn't matter,\" replied the Tiger.\r\n\"For my part, I'm a savage beast, and have an appetite for all sorts of\r\npoor little living creatures, from a chipmonk to fat babies.\"\r\n\r\n\"How dreadful!\" said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it, though?\" returned the Hungry Tiger, licking his lips with his\r\nlong red tongue. \"Fat babies! Don't they sound delicious? But I've never\r\neaten any, because my conscience tells me it is wrong. If I had no\r\nconscience I would probably eat the babies and then get hungry again,\r\nwhich would mean that I had sacrificed the poor babies for nothing. No;\r\nhungry I was born, and hungry I shall die. But I'll not have any cruel\r\ndeeds on my conscience to be sorry for.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you are a very good tiger,\" said Dorothy, patting the huge head\r\nof the beast.\r\n\r\n\"In that you are mistaken,\" was the reply. \"I am a good beast, perhaps,\r\nbut a disgracefully bad tiger. For it is the nature of tigers to be\r\ncruel and ferocious, and in refusing to eat harmless living creatures I\r\nam acting as no good tiger has ever before acted. That is why I left\r\nthe forest and joined my friend the Cowardly Lion.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HUNGRY TIGER]\r\n\r\n\"But the Lion is not really cowardly,\" said Dorothy. \"I have seen him\r\nact as bravely as can be.\"\r\n\r\n\"All a mistake, my dear,\" protested the Lion gravely. \"To others I may\r\nhave seemed brave, at times, but I have never been in any danger that I\r\nwas not afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I,\" said Dorothy, truthfully. \"But I must go and set free Billina,\r\nand then I will see you again.\"\r\n\r\nShe ran around to the back yard of the palace and soon found the chicken\r\nhouse, being guided to it by a loud cackling and crowing and a\r\ndistracting hubbub of sounds such as chickens make when they are\r\nexcited.\r\n\r\nSomething seemed to be wrong in the chicken house, and when Dorothy\r\nlooked through the slats in the door she saw a group of hens and\r\nroosters huddled in one corner and watching what appeared to be a\r\nwhirling ball of feathers. It bounded here and there about the chicken\r\nhouse, and at first Dorothy could not tell what it was, while the\r\nscreeching of the chickens nearly deafened her.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly the bunch of feathers stopped whirling, and then, to her\r\namazement, the girl saw Billina crouching upon the prostrate form of a\r\nspeckled rooster. For an instant they both remained motionless, and then\r\nthe yellow hen shook her wings to settle the feathers and walked toward\r\nthe door with a strut of proud defiance and a cluck of victory, while\r\nthe speckled rooster limped away to the group of other chickens,\r\ntrailing his crumpled plumage in the dust as he went.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Billina!\" cried Dorothy, in a shocked voice; \"have you been\r\nfighting?\"\r\n\r\n\"I really think I have,\" retorted Billina. \"Do you think I'd let that\r\nspeckled villain of a rooster lord it over _me_, and claim to run this\r\nchicken house, as long as I'm able to peck and scratch? Not if my name\r\nis Bill!\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't Bill, it's Billina; and you're talking slang, which is very\r\nundig'n'fied,\" said Dorothy, reprovingly. \"Come here, Billina, and I'll\r\nlet you out; for Ozma of Oz is here, and has set us free.\"\r\n\r\nSo the yellow hen came to the door, which Dorothy unlatched for her to\r\npass through, and the other chickens silently watched them from their\r\ncorner without offering to approach nearer.\r\n\r\nThe girl lifted her friend in her arms and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Billina! how dreadful you look. You've lost a lot of feathers, and\r\none of your eyes is nearly pecked out, and your comb is bleeding!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's nothing,\" said Billina. \"Just look at the speckled rooster!\r\nDidn't I do him up brown?\"\r\n\r\nDorothy shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"I don't 'prove of this, at all,\" she said, carrying Billina away toward\r\nthe palace. \"It isn't a good thing for you to 'sociate with those common\r\nchickens. They would soon spoil your good manners, and you wouldn't be\r\nrespec'able any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't ask to associate with them,\" replied Billina. \"It is that\r\ncross old Princess who is to blame. But I was raised in the United\r\nStates, and I won't allow any one-horse chicken of the Land of Ev to run\r\nover me and put on airs, as long as I can lift a claw in self-defense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Billina,\" said Dorothy. \"We won't talk about it any more.\"\r\n\r\nSoon they came to the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger to whom the\r\ngirl introduced the Yellow Hen.\r\n\r\n\"Glad to meet any friend of Dorothy's,\" said the Lion, politely. \"To\r\njudge by your present appearance, you are not a coward, as I am.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"WHY, BILLINA!\" CRIED DOROTHY; \"HAVE YOU BEEN FIGHTING?\"]\r\n\r\n\"Your present appearance makes my mouth water,\" said the Tiger, looking\r\nat Billina greedily. \"My, my! how good you would taste if I could only\r\ncrunch you between my jaws. But don't worry. You would only appease my\r\nappetite for a moment; so it isn't worth while to eat you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said the hen, nestling closer in Dorothy's arms.\r\n\r\n\"Besides, it wouldn't be right,\" continued the Tiger, looking steadily\r\nat Billina and clicking his jaws together.\r\n\r\n\"Of course not,\" cried Dorothy, hastily. \"Billina is my friend, and you\r\nmustn't ever eat her under any circ'mstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll try to remember that,\" said the Tiger; \"but I'm a little\r\nabsent-minded, at times.\"\r\n\r\nThen Dorothy carried her pet into the drawing-room of the palace, where\r\nTiktok, being invited to do so by Ozma, had seated himself between the\r\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman. Opposite to them sat Ozma herself and the\r\nPrincess Langwidere, and beside them there was a vacant chair for\r\nDorothy.\r\n\r\nAround this important group was ranged the Army of Oz, and as Dorothy\r\nlooked at the handsome uniforms of the Twenty-Seven she said:\r\n\r\n\"Why, they seem to be all officers.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are, all except one,\" answered the Tin Woodman. \"I have in my Army\r\neight Generals, six Colonels, seven Majors and five Captains, besides\r\none private for them to command. I'd like to promote the private, for I\r\nbelieve no private should ever be in public life; and I've also noticed\r\nthat officers usually fight better and are more reliable than common\r\nsoldiers. Besides, the officers are more important looking, and lend\r\ndignity to our army.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt you are right,\" said Dorothy, seating herself beside Ozma.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" announced the girlish Ruler of Oz, \"we will hold a solemn\r\nconference to decide the best manner of liberating the royal family of\r\nthis fair Land of Ev from their long imprisonment.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Royal Family of Ev\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman was the first to address the meeting.\r\n\r\n\"To begin with,\" said he, \"word came to our noble and illustrous Ruler,\r\nOzma of Oz, that the wife and ten children--five boys and five girls--of\r\nthe former King of Ev, by name Evoldo, have been enslaved by the Nome\r\nKing and are held prisoners in his underground palace. Also that there\r\nwas no one in Ev powerful enough to release them. Naturally our Ozma\r\nwished to undertake the adventure of liberating the poor prisoners; but\r\nfor a long time she could find no way to cross the great desert between\r\nthe two countries. Finally she went to a friendly sorceress of our land\r\nnamed Glinda the Good, who heard the story and at once presented Ozma a\r\nmagic carpet, which would continually unroll beneath our feet and so\r\nmake a comfortable path for us to cross the desert. As soon as she had\r\nreceived the carpet our gracious Ruler ordered me to assemble our army,\r\nwhich I did. You behold in these bold warriors the pick of all the\r\nfinest soldiers of Oz; and, if we are obliged to fight the Nome King,\r\nevery officer as well as the private, will battle fiercely unto death.\"\r\n\r\nThen Tiktok spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Why should you fight the Nome King?\" he asked. \"He has done no wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"No wrong!\" cried Dorothy. \"Isn't it wrong to imprison a queen mother\r\nand her ten children?\"\r\n\r\n\"They were sold to the Nome King by King Ev-ol-do,\" replied Tiktok. \"It\r\nwas the King of Ev who did wrong, and when he re-al-ized what he had\r\ndone he jumped in-to the sea and drowned him-self.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is news to me,\" said Ozma, thoughtfully. \"I had supposed the Nome\r\nKing was all to blame in the matter. But, in any case, he must be made\r\nto liberate the prisoners.\"\r\n\r\n\"My uncle Evoldo was a very wicked man,\" declared the Princess\r\nLangwidere. \"If he had drowned himself before he sold his family, no one\r\nwould have cared. But he sold them to the powerful Nome King in exchange\r\nfor a long life, and afterward destroyed the life by jumping into the\r\nsea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Ozma, \"he did not get the long life, and the Nome King must\r\ngive up the prisoners. Where are they confined?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one knows, exactly,\" replied the Princess. \"For the king, whose name\r\nis Roquat of the Rocks, owns a splendid palace underneath the great\r\nmountain which is at the north end of this kingdom, and he has\r\ntransformed the queen and her children into ornaments and bric-a-brac\r\nwith which to decorate his rooms.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to know,\" said Dorothy, \"who this Nome King is?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you,\" replied Ozma. \"He is said to be the Ruler of the\r\nUnderground World, and commands the rocks and all that the rocks\r\ncontain. Under his rule are many thousands of the Nomes, who are queerly\r\nshaped but powerful sprites that labor at the furnaces and forges of\r\ntheir king, making gold and silver and other metals which they conceal\r\nin the crevices of the rocks, so that those living upon the earth's\r\nsurface can only find them with great difficulty. Also they make\r\ndiamonds and rubies and emeralds, which they hide in the ground; so that\r\nthe kingdom of the Nomes is wonderfully rich, and all we have of\r\nprecious stones and silver and gold is what we take from the earth and\r\nrocks where the Nome King has hidden them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" said Dorothy, nodding her little head wisely.\r\n\r\n\"For the reason that we often steal his treasures,\" continued Ozma, \"the\r\nRuler of the Underground World is not fond of those who live upon the\r\nearth's surface, and never appears among us. If we wish to see King\r\nRoquat of the Rocks, we must visit his own country, where he is all\r\npowerful, and therefore it will be a dangerous undertaking.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, for the sake of the poor prisoners,\" said Dorothy, \"we ought to do\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall do it,\" replied the Scarecrow, \"although it requires a lot of\r\ncourage for me to go near to the furnaces of the Nome King. For I am\r\nonly stuffed with straw, and a single spark of fire might destroy me\r\nentirely.\"\r\n\r\n\"The furnaces may also melt my tin,\" said the Tin Woodman; \"but I am\r\ngoing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't bear heat,\" remarked the Princess Langwidere, yawning lazily,\r\n\"so I shall stay at home. But I wish you may have success in your\r\nundertaking, for I am heartily tired of ruling this stupid kingdom, and\r\nI need more leisure in which to admire my beautiful heads.\"\r\n\r\n\"We do not need you,\" said Ozma. \"For, if with the aid of my brave\r\nfollowers I cannot accomplish my purpose, then it would be useless for\r\nyou to undertake the journey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite true,\" sighed the Princess. \"So, if you'll excuse me, I will now\r\nretire to my cabinet. I've worn this head quite awhile, and I want to\r\nchange it for another.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she had left them (and you may be sure no one was sorry to see her\r\ngo) Ozma said to Tiktok:\r\n\r\n\"Will you join our party?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am the slave of the girl Dor-oth-y, who res-cued me from pris-on,\"\r\nreplied the machine. \"Where she goes I will go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am going with my friends, of course,\" said Dorothy, quickly. \"I\r\nwouldn't miss the fun for anything. Will you go, too, Billina?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure,\" said Billina in a careless tone. She was smoothing down\r\nthe feathers of her back and not paying much attention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I CAN'T BEAR HEAT,\" REMARKED LANGWIDERE]\r\n\r\n\"Heat is just in her line,\" remarked the Scarecrow. \"If she is nicely\r\nroasted, she will be better than ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Ozma, \"we will arrange to start for the Kingdom of the Nomes\r\nat daybreak tomorrow. And, in the meantime, we will rest and prepare\r\nourselves for the journey.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Princess Langwidere did not again appear to her guests, the\r\npalace servants waited upon the strangers from Oz and did everything in\r\ntheir power to make the party comfortable. There were many vacant rooms\r\nat their disposal, and the brave Army of twenty-seven was easily\r\nprovided for and liberally feasted.\r\n\r\nThe Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger were unharnessed from the chariot\r\nand allowed to roam at will throughout the palace, where they nearly\r\nfrightened the servants into fits, although they did no harm at all. At\r\none time Dorothy found the little maid Nanda crouching in terror in a\r\ncorner, with the Hungry Tiger standing before her.\r\n\r\n\"You certainly look delicious,\" the beast was saying. \"Will you kindly\r\ngive me permission to eat you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no!\" cried the maid in reply.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the Tiger, yawning frightfully, \"please to get me about\r\nthirty pounds of tenderloin steak, cooked rare, with a peck of boiled\r\npotatoes on the side, and five gallons of ice-cream for dessert.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I'll do the best I can!\" said Nanda, and she ran away as fast as she\r\ncould go.\r\n\r\n\"Are you so very hungry?\" asked Dorothy, in wonder.\r\n\r\n\"You can hardly imagine the size of my appetite,\" replied the Tiger,\r\nsadly. \"It seems to fill my whole body, from the end of my throat to the\r\ntip of my tail. I am very sure the appetite doesn't fit me, and is too\r\nlarge for the size of my body. Some day, when I meet a dentist with a\r\npair of forceps, I'm going to have it pulled.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, your tooth?\" asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"No, my appetite,\" said the Hungry Tiger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOROTHY RELATED TO THEM HER OWN ADVENTURES]\r\n\r\nThe little girl spent most of the afternoon talking with the Scarecrow\r\nand the Tin Woodman, who related to her all that had taken place in the\r\nLand of Oz since Dorothy had left it. She was much interested in the\r\nstory of Ozma, who had been, when a baby, stolen by a wicked old witch\r\nand transformed into a boy. She did not know that she had ever been a\r\ngirl until she was restored to her natural form by a kind sorceress.\r\nThen it was found that she was the only child of the former Ruler of\r\nOz, and was entitled to rule in his place. Ozma had many adventures,\r\nhowever, before she regained her father's throne, and in these she was\r\naccompanied by a pumpkin-headed man, a highly magnified and thoroughly\r\neducated Woggle-Bug, and a wonderful sawhorse that had been brought to\r\nlife by means of a magic powder. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman had\r\nalso assisted her; but the Cowardly Lion, who ruled the great forest as\r\nthe King of Beasts, knew nothing of Ozma until after she became the\r\nreigning princess of Oz. Then he journeyed to the Emerald City to see\r\nher, and on hearing she was about to visit the Land of Ev to set free\r\nthe royal family of that country, the Cowardly Lion begged to go with\r\nher, and brought along his friend, the Hungry Tiger, as well.\r\n\r\nHaving heard this story, Dorothy related to them her own adventures, and\r\nthen went out with her friends to find the Sawhorse, which Ozma had\r\ncaused to be shod with plates of gold, so that its legs would not wear\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThey came upon the Sawhorse standing motionless beside the garden gate,\r\nbut when Dorothy was introduced to him he bowed politely and blinked his\r\neyes, which were knots of wood, and wagged his tail, which was only the\r\nbranch of a tree.\r\n\r\n\"What a remarkable thing, to be alive!\" exclaimed Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"I quite agree with you,\" replied the Sawhorse, in a rough but not\r\nunpleasant voice. \"A creature like me has no business to live, as we all\r\nknow. But it was the magic powder that did it, so I cannot justly be\r\nblamed.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Of course not,\" said Dorothy. \"And you seem to be of some use, 'cause I\r\nnoticed the Scarecrow riding upon your back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes; I'm of use,\" returned the Sawhorse; \"and I never tire, never\r\nhave to be fed, or cared for in any way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you intel'gent?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Not very,\" said the creature. \"It would be foolish to waste intelligence\r\non a common Sawhorse, when so many professors need it. But I know enough\r\nto obey my masters, and to gid-dup, or whoa, when I'm told to. So I'm\r\npretty well satisfied.\"\r\n\r\nThat night Dorothy slept in a pleasant little bedchamber next to that\r\noccupied by Ozma of Oz, and Billina perched upon the foot of the bed and\r\ntucked her head under her wing and slept as soundly in that position as\r\ndid Dorothy upon her soft cushions.\r\n\r\nBut before daybreak every one was awake and stirring, and soon the\r\nadventurers were eating a hasty breakfast in the great dining-room of\r\nthe palace. Ozma sat at the head of a long table, on a raised platform,\r\nwith Dorothy on her right hand and the Scarecrow on her left. The\r\nScarecrow did not eat, of course; but Ozma placed him near her so that\r\nshe might ask his advice about the journey while she ate.\r\n\r\nLower down the table were the twenty-seven warriors of Oz, and at the\r\nend of the room the Lion and the Tiger were eating out of a kettle that\r\nhad been placed upon the floor, while Billina fluttered around to pick\r\nup any scraps that might be scattered.\r\n\r\nIt did not take long to finish the meal, and then the Lion and the Tiger\r\nwere harnessed to the chariot and the party was ready to start for the\r\nNome King's Palace.\r\n\r\nFirst rode Ozma, with Dorothy beside her in the golden chariot and\r\nholding Billina fast in her arms. Then came the Scarecrow on the\r\nSawhorse, with the Tin Woodman and Tiktok marching side by side just\r\nbehind him. After these tramped the Army, looking brave and handsome in\r\ntheir splendid uniforms. The generals commanded the colonels and the\r\ncolonels commanded the majors and the majors commanded the captains and\r\nthe captains commanded the private, who marched with an air of proud\r\nimportance because it required so many officers to give him his orders.\r\n\r\nAnd so the magnificent procession left the palace and started along the\r\nroad just as day was breaking, and by the time the sun came out they had\r\nmade good progress toward the valley that led to the Nome King's\r\ndomain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Giant with the Hammer\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe road led for a time through a pretty farm country, and then past a\r\npicnic grove that was very inviting. But the procession continued to\r\nsteadily advance until Billina cried in an abrupt and commanding manner:\r\n\r\n\"Wait--wait!\"\r\n\r\nOzma stopped her chariot so suddenly that the Scarecrow's Sawhorse\r\nnearly ran into it, and the ranks of the army tumbled over one another\r\nbefore they could come to a halt. Immediately the yellow hen struggled\r\nfrom Dorothy's arms and flew into a clump of bushes by the roadside.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" called the Tin Woodman, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Billina wants to lay her egg, that's all,\" said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Lay her egg!\" repeated the Tin Woodman, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; she lays one every morning, about this time; and it's quite\r\nfresh,\" said the girl.\r\n\r\n\"But does your foolish old hen suppose that this entire cavalcade, which\r\nis bound on an important adventure, is going to stand still while she\r\nlays her egg?\" enquired the Tin Woodman, earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"What else can we do?\" asked the girl. \"It's a habit of Billina's and\r\nshe can't break herself of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then she must hurry up,\" said the Tin Woodman, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" exclaimed the Scarecrow. \"If she hurries she may lay scrambled\r\neggs.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's nonsense,\" said Dorothy. \"But Billina won't be long, I'm sure.\"\r\n\r\nSo they stood and waited, although all were restless and anxious to\r\nproceed. And by and by the yellow hen came from the bushes saying:\r\n\r\n\"Kut-kut, kut, ka-daw-kutt! Kut, kut, kut--ka-daw-kut!\" \"What is she\r\ndoing--singing her lay?\" asked the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"For-ward--march!\" shouted the Tin Woodman, waving his axe, and the\r\nprocession started just as Dorothy had once more grabbed Billina in her\r\narms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Isn't anyone going to get my egg?\" cried the hen, in great excitement.\r\n\r\n\"I'll get it,\" said the Scarecrow; and at his command the Sawhorse\r\npranced into the bushes. The straw man soon found the egg, which he\r\nplaced in his jacket pocket. The cavalcade, having moved rapidly on, was\r\neven then far in advance; but it did not take the Sawhorse long to\r\ncatch up with it, and presently the Scarecrow was riding in his\r\naccustomed place behind Ozma's chariot.\r\n\r\n\"What shall I do with the egg?\" he asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" the girl answered. \"Perhaps the Hungry Tiger would like\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"It would not be enough to fill one of my back teeth,\" remarked the\r\nTiger. \"A bushel of them, hard boiled, might take a little of the edge\r\noff my appetite; but one egg isn't good for anything at all, that I know\r\nof.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; it wouldn't even make a sponge cake,\" said the Scarecrow,\r\nthoughtfully. \"The Tin Woodman might carry it with his axe and hatch it;\r\nbut after all I may as well keep it myself for a souvenir.\" So he left\r\nit in his pocket.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThey had now reached that part of the valley that lay between the two\r\nhigh mountains which Dorothy had seen from her tower window. At the far\r\nend was the third great mountain, which blocked the valley and was the\r\nnorthern edge of the Land of Ev. It was underneath this mountain that\r\nthe Nome King's palace was said to be; but it would be some time before\r\nthey reached that place.\r\n\r\nThe path was becoming rocky and difficult for the wheels of the chariot\r\nto pass over, and presently a deep gulf appeared at their feet which was\r\ntoo wide for them to leap. So Ozma took a small square of green cloth\r\nfrom her pocket and threw it upon the ground. At once it became the\r\nmagic carpet, and unrolled itself far enough for all the cavalcade to\r\nwalk upon. The chariot now advanced, and the green carpet unrolled\r\nbefore it, crossing the gulf on a level with its banks, so that all\r\npassed over in safety.\r\n\r\n\"That's easy enough,\" said the Scarecrow. \"I wonder what will happen\r\nnext.\"\r\n\r\nHe was not long in making the discovery, for the sides of the mountain\r\ncame closer together until finally there was but a narrow path between\r\nthem, along which Ozma and her party were forced to pass in single file.\r\n\r\nThey now heard a low and deep \"thump!----thump!----thump!\" which echoed\r\nthroughout the valley and seemed to grow louder as they advanced. Then,\r\nturning a corner of rock, they saw before them a huge form, which\r\ntowered above the path for more than a hundred feet. The form was that\r\nof a gigantic man built out of plates of cast iron, and it stood with\r\none foot on either side of the narrow road and swung over its right\r\nshoulder an immense iron mallet, with which it constantly pounded the\r\nearth. These resounding blows explained the thumping sounds they had\r\nheard, for the mallet was much bigger than a barrel, and where it struck\r\nthe path between the rocky sides of the mountain it filled all the space\r\nthrough which our travelers would be obliged to pass.\r\n\r\nOf course they at once halted, a safe distance away from the terrible\r\niron mallet. The magic carpet would do them no good in this case, for it\r\nwas only meant to protect them from any dangers upon the ground beneath\r\ntheir feet, and not from dangers that appeared in the air above them.\r\n\r\n\"Wow!\" said the Cowardly Lion, with a shudder. \"It makes me dreadfully\r\nnervous to see that big hammer pounding so near my head. One blow would\r\ncrush me into a door-mat.\"\r\n\r\n\"The ir-on gi-ant is a fine fel-low,\" said Tiktok, \"and works as\r\nstead-i-ly as a clock. He was made for the Nome King by Smith & Tin-ker,\r\nwho made me, and his du-ty is to keep folks from find-ing the\r\nun-der-ground pal-ace. Is he not a great work of art?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can he think, and speak, as you do?\" asked Ozma, regarding the giant\r\nwith wondering eyes.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the machine; \"he is on-ly made to pound the road, and has\r\nno think-ing or speak-ing at-tach-ment. But he pounds ve-ry well, I\r\nthink.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too well,\" observed the Scarecrow. \"He is keeping us from going\r\nfarther. Is there no way to stop his machinery?\"\r\n\r\n\"On-ly the Nome King, who has the key, can do that,\" answered Tiktok.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Dorothy, anxiously, \"what shall we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me for a few minutes,\" said the Scarecrow, \"and I will think it\r\nover.\"\r\n\r\nHe retired, then, to a position in the rear, where he turned his painted\r\nface to the rocks and began to think.\r\n\r\nMeantime the giant continued to raise his iron mallet high in the air\r\nand to strike the path terrific blows that echoed through the mountains\r\nlike the roar of a cannon. Each time the mallet lifted, however, there\r\nwas a moment when the path beneath the monster was free, and perhaps the\r\nScarecrow had noticed this, for when he came back to the others he said:\r\n\r\n\"The matter is a very simple one, after all. We have but to run under\r\nthe hammer, one at a time, when it is lifted, and pass to the other\r\nside before it falls again.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TIGER WENT NEXT]\r\n\r\n\"It will require quick work, if we escape the blow,\" said the Tin\r\nWoodman, with a shake of his head. \"But it really seems the only thing\r\nto be done. Who will make the first attempt?\"\r\n\r\nThey looked at one another hesitatingly for a moment. Then the Cowardly\r\nLion, who was trembling like a leaf in the wind, said to them:\r\n\r\n\"I suppose the head of the procession must go first--and that's me. But\r\nI'm terribly afraid of the big hammer!\"\r\n\r\n\"What will become of me?\" asked Ozma. \"You might rush under the hammer\r\nyourself, but the chariot would surely be crushed.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must leave the chariot,\" said the Scarecrow. \"But you two girls can\r\nride upon the backs of the Lion and the Tiger.\"\r\n\r\nSo this was decided upon, and Ozma, as soon as the Lion was unfastened\r\nfrom the chariot, at once mounted the beast's back and said she was\r\nready.\r\n\r\n\"Cling fast to his mane,\" advised Dorothy. \"I used to ride him myself,\r\nand that's the way I held on.\"\r\n\r\nSo Ozma clung fast to the mane, and the Lion crouched in the path and\r\neyed the swinging mallet carefully until he knew just the instant it\r\nwould begin to rise in the air.\r\n\r\nThen, before anyone thought he was ready, he made a sudden leap\r\nstraight between the iron giant's legs, and before the mallet struck the\r\nground again the Lion and Ozma were safe on the other side.\r\n\r\nThe Tiger went next. Dorothy sat upon his back and locked her arms\r\naround his striped neck, for he had no mane to cling to. He made the\r\nleap straight and true as an arrow from a bow, and ere Dorothy realized\r\nit she was out of danger and standing by Ozma's side.\r\n\r\nNow came the Scarecrow on the Sawhorse, and while they made the dash in\r\nsafety they were within a hair's breadth of being caught by the\r\ndescending hammer.\r\n\r\nTiktok walked up to the very edge of the spot the hammer struck, and as\r\nit was raised for the next blow he calmly stepped forward and escaped\r\nits descent. That was an idea for the Tin Woodman to follow, and he also\r\ncrossed in safety while the great hammer was in the air. But when it\r\ncame to the twenty-six officers and the private, their knees were so\r\nweak that they could not walk a step.\r\n\r\n\"In battle we are wonderfully courageous,\" said one of the generals,\r\n\"and our foes find us very terrible to face. But war is one thing and\r\nthis is another. When it comes to being pounded upon the head by an iron\r\nhammer, and smashed into pancakes, we naturally object.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make a run for it,\" urged the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"Our knees shake so that we cannot run,\" answered a captain. \"If we\r\nshould try it we would all certainly be pounded to a jelly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well\" sighed the Cowardly Lion, \"I see, friend Tiger, that we\r\nmust place ourselves in great danger to rescue this bold army. Come with\r\nme, and we will do the best we can.\"\r\n\r\nSo, Ozma and Dorothy having already dismounted from their backs, the\r\nLion and the Tiger leaped back again under the awful hammer and returned\r\nwith two generals clinging to their necks. They repeated this daring\r\npassage twelve times, when all the officers had been carried beneath the\r\ngiant's legs and landed safely on the further side. By that time the\r\nbeasts were very tired, and panted so hard that their tongues hung out\r\nof their great mouths.\r\n\r\n\"But what is to become of the private?\" asked Ozma.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, leave him there to guard the chariot,\" said the Lion. \"I'm tired\r\nout, and won't pass under that mallet again.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WOODEN HORSE WAS CARELESS]\r\n\r\nThe officers at once protested that they must have the private with\r\nthem, else there would be no one for them to command. But neither the\r\nLion or the Tiger would go after him, and so the Scarecrow sent the\r\nSawhorse.\r\n\r\nEither the wooden horse was careless, or it failed to properly time the\r\ndescent of the hammer, for the mighty weapon caught it squarely upon its\r\nhead, and thumped it against the ground so powerfully that the private\r\nflew off its back high into the air, and landed upon one of the giant's\r\ncast-iron arms. Here he clung desperately while the arm rose and fell\r\nwith each one of the rapid strokes.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow dashed in to rescue his Sawhorse, and had his left foot\r\nsmashed by the hammer before he could pull the creature out of danger.\r\nThey then found that the Sawhorse had been badly dazed by the blow; for\r\nwhile the hard wooden knot of which his head was formed could not be\r\ncrushed by the hammer, both his ears were broken off and he would be\r\nunable to hear a sound until some new ones were made for him. Also his\r\nleft knee was cracked, and had to be bound up with a string.\r\n\r\nBillina having fluttered under the hammer, it now remained only to\r\nrescue the private who was riding upon the iron giant's arm, high in the\r\nair. The Scarecrow lay flat upon the ground and called to the man to\r\njump down upon his body, which was soft because it was stuffed with\r\nstraw. This the private managed to do, waiting until a time when he was\r\nnearest the ground and then letting himself drop upon the Scarecrow. He\r\naccomplished the feat without breaking any bones, and the Scarecrow\r\ndeclared he was not injured in the least.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Tin Woodman having by this time fitted new ears to the\r\nSawhorse, the entire party proceeded upon its way, leaving the giant to\r\npound the path behind them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nome King\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nBy and by, when they drew near to the mountain that blocked their path\r\nand which was the furthermost edge of the Kingdom of Ev, the way grew\r\ndark and gloomy for the reason that the high peaks on either side shut\r\nout the sunshine. And it was very silent, too, as there were no birds to\r\nsing or squirrels to chatter, the trees being left far behind them and\r\nonly the bare rocks remaining.\r\n\r\nOzma and Dorothy were a little awed by the silence, and all the others\r\nwere quiet and grave except the Sawhorse, which, as it trotted along\r\nwith the Scarecrow upon his back, hummed a queer song, of which this was\r\nthe chorus:\r\n\r\n    \"Would a wooden horse in a woodland go?\r\n      Aye, aye! I sigh, he would, although\r\n    Had he not had a wooden head\r\n      He'd mount the mountain top instead.\"\r\n\r\nBut no one paid any attention to this because they were now close to the\r\nNome King's dominions, and his splendid underground palace could not be\r\nvery far away.\r\n\r\nSuddenly they heard a shout of jeering laughter, and stopped short. They\r\nwould have to stop in a minute, anyway, for the huge mountain barred\r\ntheir further progress and the path ran close up to a wall of rock and\r\nended.\r\n\r\n\"Who was that laughing?\" asked Ozma.\r\n\r\nThere was no reply, but in the gloom they could see strange forms flit\r\nacross the face of the rock. Whatever the creations might be they seemed\r\nvery like the rock itself, for they were the color of rocks and their\r\nshapes were as rough and rugged as if they had been broken away from the\r\nside of the mountain. They kept close to the steep cliff facing our\r\nfriends, and glided up and down, and this way and that, with a lack of\r\nregularity that was quite confusing. And they seemed not to need places\r\nto rest their feet, but clung to the surface of the rock as a fly does\r\nto a window-pane, and were never still for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Do not mind them,\" said Tiktok, as Dorothy shrank back. \"They are on-ly\r\nthe Nomes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what are Nomes?\" asked the girl, half frightened.\r\n\r\n\"They are rock fair-ies, and serve the Nome King,\" replied the machine.\r\n\"But they will do us no harm. You must call for the King, be-cause\r\nwith-out him you can ne-ver find the en-trance to the pal-ace.\"\r\n\r\n\"_You_ call,\" said Dorothy to Ozma.\r\n\r\nJust then the Nomes laughed again, and the sound was so weird and\r\ndisheartening that the twenty-six officers commanded the private to\r\n\"right-about-face!\" and they all started to run as fast as they could.\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman at once pursued his army and cried \"halt!\" and when they\r\nhad stopped their flight he asked: \"Where are you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I find I've forgotten the brush for my whiskers,\" said a general,\r\ntrembling with fear. \"S-s-so we are g-going back after it!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is impossible,\" replied the Tin Woodman. \"For the giant with the\r\nhammer would kill you all if you tried to pass him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I'd forgotten the giant,\" said the general, turning pale.\r\n\r\n\"You seem to forget a good many things,\" remarked the Tin Woodman. \"I\r\nhope you won't forget that you are brave men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" cried the general, slapping his gold-embroidered chest.\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" cried all the other officers, indignantly slapping their\r\nchests.\r\n\r\n\"For my part,\" said the private, meekly, \"I must obey my officers; so\r\nwhen I am told to run, I run; and when I am told to fight, I fight.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is right,\" agreed the Tin Woodman. \"And now you must all come back\r\nto Ozma, and obey _her_ orders. And if you try to run away again I will\r\nhave her reduce all the twenty-six officers to privates, and make the\r\nprivate your general.\"\r\n\r\nThis terrible threat so frightened them that they at once returned to\r\nwhere Ozma was standing beside the Cowardly Lion.\r\n\r\nThen Ozma cried out in a loud voice:\r\n\r\n\"I demand that the Nome King appear to us!\"\r\n\r\nThere was no reply, except that the shifting Nomes upon the mountain\r\nlaughed in derision.\r\n\r\n\"You must not command the Nome King,\" said Tiktok, \"for you do not rule\r\nhim, as you do your own peo-ple.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONLY THE MOCKING LAUGHTER REPLIED TO HER]\r\n\r\nSo Ozma called again, saying:\r\n\r\n\"I request the Nome King to appear to us.\"\r\n\r\nOnly the mocking laughter replied to her, and the shadowy Nomes\r\ncontinued to flit here and there upon the rocky cliff.\r\n\r\n\"Try en-treat-y,\" said Tiktok to Ozma. \"If he will not come at your\r\nre-quest, then the Nome King may list-en to your plead-ing.\"\r\n\r\nOzma looked around her proudly.\r\n\r\n\"Do you wish your ruler to plead with this wicked Nome King?\" she asked.\r\n\"Shall Ozma of Oz humble herself to a creature who lives in an\r\nunderground kingdom?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" they all shouted, with big voices; and the Scarecrow added:\r\n\r\n\"If he will not come, we will dig him out of his hole, like a fox, and\r\nconquer his stubbornness. But our sweet little ruler must always\r\nmaintain her dignity, just as I maintain mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not afraid to plead with him,\" said Dorothy. \"I'm only a little\r\ngirl from Kansas, and we've got more dignity at home than we know what\r\nto do with. _I'll_ call the Nome King.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do,\" said the Hungry Tiger; \"and if he makes hash of you I'll willingly\r\neat you for breakfast tomorrow morning.\"\r\n\r\nSo Dorothy stepped forward and said:\r\n\r\n\"_Please_ Mr. Nome King, come here and see us.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nomes started to laugh again; but a low growl came from the\r\nmountain, and in a flash they had all vanished from sight and were\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nThen a door in the rock opened, and a voice cried:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Enter!\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it a trick?\" asked the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" replied Ozma. \"We came here to rescue the poor Queen of Ev\r\nand her ten children, and we must run some risks to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Nome King is hon-est and good na-tured,\" said Tiktok. \"You can\r\ntrust him to do what is right.\"\r\n\r\nSo Ozma led the way, hand in hand with Dorothy, and they passed through\r\nthe arched doorway of rock and entered a long passage which was lighted\r\nby jewels set in the walls and having lamps behind them. There was no\r\none to escort them, or to show them the way, but all the party pressed\r\nthrough the passage until they came to a round, domed cavern that was\r\ngrandly furnished.\r\n\r\nIn the center of this room was a throne carved out of a solid boulder of\r\nrock, rude and rugged in shape but glittering with great rubies and\r\ndiamonds and emeralds on every part of its surface. And upon the throne\r\nsat the Nome King.\r\n\r\nThis important monarch of the Underground World was a little fat man\r\nclothed in gray-brown garments that were the exact color of the rock\r\nthrone in which he was seated. His bushy hair and flowing beard were\r\nalso colored like the rocks, and so was his face. He wore no crown of\r\nany sort, and his only ornament was a broad, jewel-studded belt that\r\nencircled his fat little body. As for his features, they seemed kindly\r\nand good humored, and his eyes were turned merrily upon his visitors as\r\nOzma and Dorothy stood before him with their followers ranged in close\r\norder behind them.\r\n\r\n\"Why, he looks just like Santa Claus--only he isn't the same color!\"\r\nwhispered Dorothy to her friend; but the Nome King heard the speech, and\r\nit made him laugh aloud.\r\n\r\n    \"'He had a red face and a round little belly\r\n    That shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly!'\"\r\n\r\nquoth the monarch, in a pleasant voice; and they could all see that he\r\nreally did shake like jelly when he laughed.\r\n\r\nBoth Ozma and Dorothy were much relieved to find the Nome King so jolly,\r\nand a minute later he waved his right hand and the girls each found a\r\ncushioned stool at her side.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, my dears,\" said the King, \"and tell me why you have come all\r\nthis way to see me, and what I can do to make you happy.\"\r\n\r\nWhile they seated themselves the Nome King picked up a pipe, and taking\r\na glowing red coal out of his pocket he placed it in the bowl of the\r\npipe and began puffing out clouds of smoke that curled in rings above\r\nhis head. Dorothy thought this made the little monarch look more like\r\nSanta Claus than ever; but Ozma now began speaking, and every one\r\nlistened intently to her words.\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty,\" said she, \"I am the ruler of the Land of Oz, and I have\r\ncome here to ask you to release the good Queen of Ev and her ten\r\nchildren, whom you have enchanted and hold as your prisoners.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; you are mistaken about that,\" replied the King. \"They are not\r\nmy prisoners, but my slaves, whom I purchased from the King of Ev.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that was wrong,\" said Ozma.\r\n\r\n\"According to the laws of Ev, the king can do no wrong,\" answered the\r\nmonarch, eyeing a ring of smoke he had just blown from his mouth; \"so\r\nthat he had a perfect right to sell his family to me in exchange for a\r\nlong life.\"\r\n\r\n\"You cheated him, though,\" declared Dorothy; \"for the King of Ev did not\r\nhave a long life. He jumped into the sea and was drowned.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was not my fault,\" said the Nome King, crossing his legs and\r\nsmiling contentedly. \"I gave him the long life, all right; but he\r\ndestroyed it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how could it be a long life?\" asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Easily enough,\" was the reply. \"Now suppose, my dear, that I gave you a\r\npretty doll in exchange for a lock of your hair, and that after you had\r\nreceived the doll you smashed it into pieces and destroyed it. Could you\r\nsay that I had not given you a pretty doll?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"And could you, in fairness, ask me to return to you the lock of hair,\r\njust because you had smashed the doll?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Dorothy, again.\r\n\r\n\"Of course not,\" the Nome King returned. \"Nor will I give up the Queen\r\nand her children because the King of Ev destroyed his long life by\r\njumping into the sea. They belong to me and I shall keep them.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THEY BELONG TO ME AND I SHALL KEEP THEM\"]\r\n\r\n\"But you are treating them cruelly,\" said Ozma, who was much distressed\r\nby the King's refusal.\r\n\r\n\"In what way?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"By making them your slaves,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"Cruelty,\" remarked the monarch, puffing out wreathes of smoke and\r\nwatching them float into the air, \"is a thing I can't abide. So, as\r\nslaves must work hard, and the Queen of Ev and her children were\r\ndelicate and tender, I transformed them all into articles of ornament\r\nand bric-a-brac and scattered them around the various rooms of my\r\npalace. Instead of being obliged to labor, they merely decorate my\r\napartments, and I really think I have treated them with great kindness.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what a dreadful fate is theirs!\" exclaimed Ozma, earnestly. \"And\r\nthe Kingdom of Ev is in great need of its royal family to govern it. If\r\nyou will liberate them, and restore them to their proper forms, I will\r\ngive you ten ornaments to replace each one you lose.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nome King looked grave.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose I refuse?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Ozma, firmly, \"I am here with my friends and my army to\r\nconquer your kingdom and oblige you to obey my wishes.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nome King laughed until he choked; and he choked until he coughed;\r\nand he coughed until his face turned from grayish-brown to bright red.\r\nAnd then he wiped his eyes with a rock-colored handkerchief and grew\r\ngrave again.\r\n\r\n\"You are as brave as you are pretty, my dear,\" he said to Ozma. \"But you\r\nhave little idea of the extent of the task you have undertaken. Come\r\nwith me for a moment.\"\r\n\r\nHe arose and took Ozma's hand, leading her to a little door at one side\r\nof the room. This he opened and they stepped out upon a balcony, from\r\nwhence they obtained a wonderful view of the Underground World.\r\n\r\nA vast cave extended for miles and miles under the mountain, and in\r\nevery direction were furnaces and forges glowing brightly and Nomes\r\nhammering upon precious metals or polishing gleaming jewels. All around\r\nthe walls of the cave were thousands of doors of silver and gold, built\r\ninto the solid rock, and these extended in rows far away into the\r\ndistance, as far as Ozma's eyes could follow them.\r\n\r\nWhile the little maid from Oz gazed wonderingly upon this scene the Nome\r\nKing uttered a shrill whistle, and at once all the silver and gold doors\r\nflew open and solid ranks of Nome soldiers marched out from every one.\r\nSo great were their numbers that they quickly filled the immense\r\nunderground cavern and forced the busy workmen to abandon their tasks.\r\n\r\nAlthough this tremendous army consisted of rock-colored Nomes, all squat\r\nand fat, they were clothed in glittering armor of polished steel, inlaid\r\nwith beautiful gems. Upon his brow each wore a brilliant electric light,\r\nand they bore sharp spears and swords and battle-axes of solid bronze.\r\nIt was evident they were perfectly trained, for they stood in straight\r\nrows, rank after rank, with their weapons held erect and true, as if\r\nawaiting but the word of command to level them upon their foes.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" said the Nome King, \"is but a small part of my army. No ruler\r\nupon Earth has ever dared to fight me, and no ruler ever will, for I am\r\ntoo powerful to oppose.\"\r\n\r\nHe whistled again, and at once the martial array filed through the\r\nsilver and gold doorways and disappeared, after which the workmen again\r\nresumed their labors at the furnaces.\r\n\r\nThen, sad and discouraged, Ozma of Oz turned to her friends, and the\r\nNome King calmly reseated himself on his rock throne.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THIS IS BUT A SMALL PART OF MY ARMY\"]\r\n\r\n\"It would be foolish for us to fight,\" the girl said to the Tin Woodman.\r\n\"For our brave Twenty-Seven would be quickly destroyed. I'm sure I do\r\nnot know how to act in this emergency.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ask the King where his kitchen is,\" suggested the Tiger. \"I'm hungry as\r\na bear.\"\r\n\r\n\"I might pounce upon the King and tear him in pieces,\" remarked the\r\nCowardly Lion.\r\n\r\n\"Try it,\" said the monarch, lighting his pipe with another hot coal\r\nwhich he took from his pocket.\r\n\r\nThe Lion crouched low and tried to spring upon the Nome King; but he\r\nhopped only a little way into the air and came down again in the same\r\nplace, not being able to approach the throne by even an inch.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" said the Scarecrow, thoughtfully, \"that our best plan\r\nis to wheedle his Majesty into giving up his slaves, since he is too\r\ngreat a magician to oppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is the most sensible thing any of you have suggested,\" declared\r\nthe Nome King. \"It is folly to threaten me, but I'm so kind-hearted that\r\nI cannot stand coaxing or wheedling. If you really wish to accomplish\r\nanything by your journey, my dear Ozma, you must coax me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Ozma, more cheerfully. \"Let us be friends, and talk\r\nthis over in a friendly manner.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure,\" agreed the King, his eyes twinkling merrily.\r\n\r\n\"I am very anxious,\" she continued, \"to liberate the Queen of Ev and her\r\nchildren who are now ornaments and bric-a-brac in your Majesty's palace,\r\nand to restore them to their people. Tell me, sir, how this may be\r\naccomplished.\"\r\n\r\nThe king remained thoughtful for a moment, after which he asked:\r\n\r\n\"Are you willing to take a few chances and risks yourself, in order to\r\nset free the people of Ev?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed!\" answered Ozma, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the Nome King, \"I will make you this offer: You shall go\r\nalone and unattended into my palace and examine carefully all that the\r\nrooms contain. Then you shall have permission to touch eleven different\r\nobjects, pronouncing at the time the word 'Ev,' and if any one of them,\r\nor more than one, proves to be the transformation of the Queen of Ev or\r\nany of her ten children, then they will instantly be restored to their\r\ntrue forms and may leave my palace and my kingdom in your company,\r\nwithout any objection whatever. It is possible for you, in this way, to\r\nfree the entire eleven; but if you do not guess all the objects\r\ncorrectly, and some of the slaves remain transformed, then each one of\r\nyour friends and followers may, in turn, enter the palace and have the\r\nsame privileges I grant you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, thank you! thank you for this kind offer!\" said Ozma, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"I make but one condition,\" added the Nome King, his eyes twinkling.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" she enquired.\r\n\r\n\"If none of the eleven objects you touch proves to be the transformation\r\nof any of the royal family of Ev, then, instead of freeing them, you\r\nwill yourself become enchanted, and transformed into an article of\r\nbric-a-brac or an ornament. This is only fair and just, and is the risk\r\nyou declared you were willing to take.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Eleven Guesses\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nHearing this condition imposed by the Nome King, Ozma became silent and\r\nthoughtful, and all her friends looked at her uneasily.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you do it!\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"If you guess wrong, you will be\r\nenslaved yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I shall have eleven guesses,\" answered Ozma. \"Surely I ought to\r\nguess one object in eleven correctly; and, if I do, I shall rescue one\r\nof the royal family and be safe myself. Then the rest of you may attempt\r\nit, and soon we shall free all those who are enslaved.\"\r\n\r\n\"What if we fail?\" enquired the Scarecrow. \"I'd look nice as a piece of\r\nbric-a-brac, wouldn't I?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must not fail!\" cried Ozma, courageously. \"Having come all this\r\ndistance to free these poor people, it would be weak and cowardly in us\r\nto abandon the adventure. Therefore I will accept the Nome King's offer,\r\nand go at once into the royal palace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come along, then, my dear,\" said the King, climbing down from his\r\nthrone with some difficulty, because he was so fat; \"I'll show you the\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\nHe approached a wall of the cave and waved his hand. Instantly an\r\nopening appeared, through which Ozma, after a smiling farewell to her\r\nfriends, boldly passed.\r\n\r\nShe found herself in a splendid hall that was more beautiful and grand\r\nthan anything she had ever beheld. The ceilings were composed of great\r\narches that rose far above her head, and all the walls and floors were\r\nof polished marble exquisitely tinted in many colors. Thick velvet\r\ncarpets were on the floor and heavy silken draperies covered the arches\r\nleading to the various rooms of the palace. The furniture was made of\r\nrare old woods richly carved and covered with delicate satins, and the\r\nentire palace was lighted by a mysterious rosy glow that seemed to come\r\nfrom no particular place but flooded each apartment with its soft and\r\npleasing radiance.\r\n\r\nOzma passed from one room to another, greatly delighted by all she saw.\r\nThe lovely palace had no other occupant, for the Nome King had left her\r\nat the entrance, which closed behind her, and in all the magnificent\r\nrooms there appeared to be no other person.\r\n\r\nUpon the mantels, and on many shelves and brackets and tables, were\r\nclustered ornaments of every description, seemingly made out of all\r\nsorts of metals, glass, china, stones and marbles. There were vases, and\r\nfigures of men and animals, and graven platters and bowls, and mosaics\r\nof precious gems, and many other things. Pictures, too, were on the\r\nwalls, and the underground palace was quite a museum of rare and curious\r\nand costly objects.\r\n\r\nAfter her first hasty examination of the rooms Ozma began to wonder\r\nwhich of all the numerous ornaments they contained were the\r\ntransformations of the royal family of Ev. There was nothing to guide\r\nher, for everything seemed without a spark of life. So she must guess\r\nblindly; and for the first time the girl came to realize how dangerous\r\nwas her task, and how likely she was to lose her own freedom in striving\r\nto free others from the bondage of the Nome King. No wonder the\r\ncunning monarch laughed good naturedly with his visitors, when he knew\r\nhow easily they might be entrapped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OZMA SHUT HER EYES TIGHTLY AND ADVANCED]\r\n\r\nBut Ozma, having undertaken the venture, would not abandon it. She\r\nlooked at a silver candelabra that had ten branches, and thought: \"This\r\nmay be the Queen of Ev and her ten children.\" So she touched it and\r\nuttered aloud the word \"Ev,\" as the Nome King had instructed her to do\r\nwhen she guessed. But the candelabra remained as it was before.\r\n\r\nThen she wandered into another room and touched a china lamb, thinking\r\nit might be one of the children she sought. But again she was\r\nunsuccessful. Three guesses; four guesses; five, six, seven, eight, nine\r\nand ten she made, and still not one of them was right!\r\n\r\nThe girl shivered a little and grew pale even under the rosy light; for\r\nnow but one guess remained, and her own fate depended upon the result.\r\n\r\nShe resolved not to be hasty, and strolled through all the rooms once\r\nmore, gazing earnestly upon the various ornaments and trying to decide\r\nwhich she would touch. Finally, in despair, she decided to leave it\r\nentirely to chance. She faced the doorway of a room, shut her eyes\r\ntightly, and then, thrusting aside the heavy draperies, she advanced\r\nblindly with her right arm outstretched before her.\r\n\r\nSlowly, softly she crept forward until her hand came in contact with an\r\nobject upon a small round table. She did not know what it was, but in a\r\nlow voice she pronounced the word \"Ev.\"\r\n\r\nThe rooms were quite empty of life after that. The Nome King had gained\r\na new ornament. For upon the edge of the table rested a pretty\r\ngrasshopper, that seemed to have been formed from a single emerald. It\r\nwas all that remained of Ozma of Oz.\r\n\r\nIn the throne room just beyond the palace the Nome King suddenly looked\r\nup and smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Next!\" he said, in his pleasant voice.\r\n\r\nDorothy, the Scarecrow, and the Tin Woodman, who had been sitting in\r\nanxious silence, each gave a start of dismay and stared into one\r\nanother's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Has she failed?\" asked Tiktok.\r\n\r\n\"So it seems,\" answered the little monarch, cheerfully. \"But that is no\r\nreason one of you should not succeed. The next may have twelve guesses,\r\ninstead of eleven, for there are now twelve persons transformed into\r\nornaments. Well, well! Which of you goes next?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go,\" said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Not so,\" replied the Tin Woodman. \"As commander of Ozma's army, it is\r\nmy privilege to follow her and attempt her rescue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Away you go, then,\" said the Scarecrow. \"But be careful, old friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" promised the Tin Woodman; and then he followed the Nome King\r\nto the entrance to the palace and the rock closed behind him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nome King Laughs\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a moment the King returned to his throne and relighted his pipe, and\r\nthe rest of the little band of adventurers settled themselves for\r\nanother long wait. They were greatly disheartened by the failure of\r\ntheir girl Ruler, and the knowledge that she was now an ornament in the\r\nNome King's palace--a dreadful, creepy place in spite of all its\r\nmagnificence. Without their little leader they did not know what to do\r\nnext, and each one, down to the trembling private of the army, began to\r\nfear he would soon be more ornamental than useful.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the Nome King began laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Ha, ha, ha! He, he, he! Ho, ho, ho!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's happened?\" asked the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"Why, your friend, the Tin Woodman, has become the funniest thing you\r\ncan imagine,\" replied the King, wiping the tears of merriment from his\r\neyes. \"No one would ever believe he could make such an amusing ornament.\r\nNext!\"\r\n\r\nThey gazed at each other with sinking hearts. One of the generals began\r\nto weep dolefully.\r\n\r\n\"What are you crying for?\" asked the Scarecrow, indignant at such a\r\ndisplay of weakness.\r\n\r\n\"He owed me six weeks back pay,\" said the general, \"and I hate to lose\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you shall go and find him,\" declared the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"Me!\" cried the general, greatly alarmed.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. It is your duty to follow your commander. March!\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't,\" said the general. \"I'd like to, of course; but I just simply\r\n_won't_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow looked enquiringly at the Nome King.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" said the jolly monarch. \"If he doesn't care to enter the\r\npalace and make his guesses I'll throw him into one of my fiery\r\nfurnaces.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go!--of course I'm going,\" yelled the general, as quick as scat.\r\n\"Where is the entrance--where is it? Let me go at once!\"\r\n\r\nSo the Nome King escorted him into the palace, and again returned to\r\nawait the result. What the general did, no one can tell; but it was not\r\nlong before the King called for the next victim, and a colonel was\r\nforced to try his fortune.\r\n\r\nThus, one after another, all of the twenty-six officers filed into the\r\npalace and made their guesses--and became ornaments.\r\n\r\nMeantime the King ordered refreshments to be served to those waiting,\r\nand at his command a rudely shaped Nome entered, bearing a tray. This\r\nNome was not unlike the others that Dorothy had seen, but he wore a\r\nheavy gold chain around his neck to show that he was the Chief Steward\r\nof the Nome King, and he assumed an air of much importance, and even\r\ntold his majesty not to eat too much cake late at night, or he would be\r\nill.\r\n\r\nDorothy, however, was hungry, and she was not afraid of being ill; so\r\nshe ate several cakes and found them good, and also she drank a cup of\r\nexcellent coffee made of a richly flavored clay, browned in the furnaces\r\nand then ground fine, and found it most refreshing and not at all\r\nmuddy.\r\n\r\nOf all the party which had started upon this adventure, the little\r\nKansas girl was now left alone with the Scarecrow, Tiktok, and the\r\nprivate for counsellors and companions. Of course the Cowardly Lion and\r\nthe Hungry Tiger were still there, but they, having also eaten some of\r\nthe cakes, had gone to sleep at one side of the cave, while upon the\r\nother side stood the Sawhorse, motionless and silent, as became a mere\r\nthing of wood. Billina had quietly walked around and picked up the\r\ncrumbs of cake which had been scattered, and now, as it was long after\r\nbed-time, she tried to find some dark place in which to go to sleep.\r\n\r\nPresently the hen espied a hollow underneath the King's rocky throne,\r\nand crept into it unnoticed. She could still hear the chattering of\r\nthose around her, but it was almost dark underneath the throne, so that\r\nsoon she had fallen fast asleep.\r\n\r\n\"Next!\" called the King, and the private, whose turn it was to enter the\r\nfatal palace, shook hands with Dorothy and the Scarecrow and bade them a\r\nsorrowful good-bye, and passed through the rocky portal.\r\n\r\nThey waited a long time, for the private was in no hurry to become an\r\nornament and made his guesses very slowly. The Nome King, who seemed to\r\nknow, by some magical power, all that took place in his beautiful rooms\r\nof his palace, grew impatient finally and declared he would sit up no\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n\"I love ornaments,\" said he, \"but I can wait until tomorrow to get more\r\nof them; so, as soon as that stupid private is transformed, we will all\r\ngo to bed and leave the job to be finished in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it so very late?\" asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it is after midnight,\" said the King, \"and that strikes me as\r\nbeing late enough. There is neither night nor day in my kingdom, because\r\nit is under the earth's surface, where the sun does not shine. But we\r\nhave to sleep, just the same as the up-stairs people do, and for my part\r\nI'm going to bed in a few minutes.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, it was not long after this that the private made his last guess.\r\nOf course he guessed wrongly, and of course he at once became an\r\nornament. So the King was greatly pleased, and clapped his hands to\r\nsummon his Chief Steward.\r\n\r\n\"Show these guests to some of the sleeping apartments,\" he commanded,\r\n\"and be quick about it, too, for I'm dreadfully sleepy myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've no business to sit up so late,\" replied the Steward, gruffly.\r\n\"You'll be as cross as a griffin tomorrow morning.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOON SHE HAD FALLEN FAST ASLEEP]\r\n\r\nHis Majesty made no answer to this remark, and the Chief Steward led\r\nDorothy through another doorway into a long hall, from which several\r\nplain but comfortable sleeping rooms opened. The little girl was given\r\nthe first room, and the Scarecrow and Tiktok the next--although they\r\nnever slept--and the Lion and the Tiger the third. The Sawhorse hobbled\r\nafter the Steward into a fourth room, to stand stiffly in the center of\r\nit until morning. Each night was rather a bore to the Scarecrow, Tiktok\r\nand the Sawhorse; but they had learned from experience to pass the time\r\npatiently and quietly, since all their friends who were made of flesh\r\nhad to sleep and did not like to be disturbed.\r\n\r\nWhen the Chief Steward had left them alone the Scarecrow remarked,\r\nsadly:\r\n\r\n\"I am in great sorrow over the loss of my old comrade, the Tin Woodman.\r\nWe have had many dangerous adventures together, and escaped them all,\r\nand now it grieves me to know he has become an ornament, and is lost to\r\nme forever.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was al-ways an or-na-ment to so-ci-e-ty,\" said Tiktok.\r\n\r\n\"True; but now the Nome King laughs at him, and calls him the funniest\r\nornament in all the palace. It will hurt my poor friend's pride to be\r\nlaughed at,\" continued the Scarecrow, sadly.\r\n\r\n\"We will make rath-er ab-surd or-na-ments, our-selves, to-mor-row,\"\r\nobserved the machine, in his monotonous voice.\r\n\r\nJust then Dorothy ran into their room, in a state of great anxiety,\r\ncrying:\r\n\r\n\"Where's Billina? Have you seen Billina? Is she here?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"Then what has become of her?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I thought she was with you,\" said the Scarecrow. \"Yet I do not\r\nremember seeing the yellow hen since she picked up the crumbs of cake.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must have left her in the room where the King's throne is,\" decided\r\nDorothy, and at once she turned and ran down the hall to the door\r\nthrough which they had entered. But it was fast closed and locked on the\r\nother side, and the heavy slab of rock proved to be so thick that no\r\nsound could pass through it. So Dorothy was forced to return to her\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nThe Cowardly Lion stuck his head into her room to try to console the\r\ngirl for the loss of her feathered friend.\r\n\r\n\"The yellow hen is well able to take care of herself,\" said he; \"so\r\ndon't worry about her, but try to get all the sleep you can. It has\r\nbeen a long and weary day, and you need rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll prob'ly get lots of rest tomorrow, when I become an orn'ment,\"\r\nsaid Dorothy, sleepily. But she lay down upon her couch, nevertheless,\r\nand in spite of all her worries was soon in the land of dreams.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDorothy Tries to be Brave\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nMeantime the Chief Steward had returned to the throne room, where he\r\nsaid to the King:\r\n\r\n\"You are a fool to waste so much time upon these people.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" cried his Majesty, in so enraged a voice that it awoke Billina,\r\nwho was asleep under his throne. \"How dare you call me a fool?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I like to speak the truth,\" said the Steward. \"Why didn't you\r\nenchant them all at once, instead of allowing them to go one by one into\r\nthe palace and guess which ornaments are the Queen of Ev and her\r\nchildren?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you stupid rascal, it is more fun this way,\" returned the King,\r\n\"and it serves to keep me amused for a long time.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose some of them happen to guess aright,\" persisted the\r\nSteward; \"then you would lose your old ornaments and these new ones,\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no chance of their guessing aright,\" replied the monarch, with\r\na laugh. \"How could they know that the Queen of Ev and her family are\r\nall ornaments of a royal purple color?\"\r\n\r\n\"But there are no other purple ornaments in the palace,\" said the\r\nSteward.\r\n\r\n\"There are many other colors, however, and the purple ones are scattered\r\nthroughout the rooms, and are of many different shapes and sizes. Take\r\nmy word for it, Steward, they will never think of choosing the purple\r\nornaments.\"\r\n\r\nBillina, squatting under the throne, had listened carefully to all this\r\ntalk, and now chuckled softly to herself as she heard the King disclose\r\nhis secret.\r\n\r\n\"Still, you are acting foolishly by running the chance,\" continued the\r\nSteward, roughly; \"and it is still more foolish of you to transform all\r\nthose people from Oz into green ornaments.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"HOW DARE YOU CALL ME A FOOL?\"]\r\n\r\n\"I did that because they came from the Emerald City,\" replied the\r\nKing; \"and I had no green ornaments in my collection until now. I think\r\nthey will look quite pretty, mixed with the others. Don't you?\"\r\n\r\nThe Steward gave an angry grunt.\r\n\r\n\"Have your own way, since you are the King,\" he growled. \"But if you\r\ncome to grief through your carelessness, remember that I told you so. If\r\nI wore the magic belt which enables you to work all your\r\ntransformations, and gives you so much other power, I am sure I would\r\nmake a much wiser and better King than you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, cease your tiresome chatter!\" commanded the King, getting angry\r\nagain. \"Because you are my Chief Steward you have an idea you can scold\r\nme as much as you please. But the very next time you become impudent, I\r\nwill send you to work in the furnaces, and get another Nome to fill your\r\nplace. Now follow me to my chamber, for I am going to bed. And see that\r\nI am wakened early tomorrow morning. I want to enjoy the fun of\r\ntransforming the rest of these people into ornaments.\"\r\n\r\n\"What color will you make the Kansas girl?\" asked the Steward.\r\n\r\n\"Gray, I think,\" said his Majesty.\r\n\r\n\"And the Scarecrow and the machine man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they shall be of solid gold, because they are so ugly in real\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\nThen the voices died away, and Billina knew that the King and his\r\nSteward had left the room. She fixed up some of her tail feathers that\r\nwere not straight, and then tucked her head under her wing again and\r\nwent to sleep.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Dorothy and the Lion and Tiger were given their breakfast\r\nin their rooms, and afterward joined the King in his throne room. The\r\nTiger complained bitterly that he was half starved, and begged to go\r\ninto the palace and become an ornament, so that he would no longer\r\nsuffer the pangs of hunger.\r\n\r\n\"Haven't you had your breakfast?\" asked the Nome King.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I had just a bite,\" replied the beast. \"But what good is a bite, to\r\na hungry tiger?\"\r\n\r\n\"He ate seventeen bowls of porridge, a platter full of fried sausages,\r\neleven loaves of bread and twenty-one mince pies,\" said the Steward.\r\n\r\n\"What more do you want?\" demanded the King.\r\n\r\n\"A fat baby. I want a fat baby,\" said the Hungry Tiger. \"A nice, plump,\r\njuicy, tender, fat baby. But, of course, if I had one, my conscience\r\nwould not allow me to eat it. So I'll have to be an ornament and forget\r\nmy hunger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\" exclaimed the King. \"I'll have no clumsy beasts enter my\r\npalace, to overturn and break all my pretty nick-nacks. When the rest of\r\nyour friends are transformed you can return to the upper world, and go\r\nabout your business.\"\r\n\r\n\"As for that we have no business, when our friends are gone,\" said the\r\nLion. \"So we do not care much what becomes of us.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy begged to be allowed to go first into the palace, but Tiktok\r\nfirmly maintained that the slave should face danger before the mistress.\r\nThe Scarecrow agreed with him in that, so the Nome King opened the door\r\nfor the machine man, who tramped into the palace to meet his fate. Then\r\nhis Majesty returned to his throne and puffed his pipe so contentedly\r\nthat a small cloud of smoke formed above his head.\r\n\r\nBye and bye he said:\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry there are so few of you left. Very soon, now, my fun will be\r\nover, and then for amusement I shall have nothing to do but admire my\r\nnew ornaments.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" said Dorothy, \"that you are not so honest as you\r\npretend to be.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NOME KING PUFFED HIS PIPE]\r\n\r\n\"How's that?\" asked the King.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you made us think it would be easy to guess what ornaments the\r\npeople of Ev were changed into.\"\r\n\r\n\"It _is_ easy,\" declared the monarch, \"if one is a good guesser. But it\r\nappears that the members of your party are all poor guessers.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is Tiktok doing now?\" asked the girl, uneasily.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" replied the King, with a frown. \"He is standing perfectly\r\nstill, in the middle of a room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I expect he's run down,\" said Dorothy. \"I forgot to wind him up\r\nthis morning. How many guesses has he made?\"\r\n\r\n\"All that he is allowed except one,\" answered the King. \"Suppose you go\r\nin and wind him up, and then you can stay there and make your own\r\nguesses.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"It is my turn next,\" declared the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you don't want to go away and leave me all alone, do you?\" asked\r\nthe girl. \"Besides, if I go now I can wind up Tiktok, so that he can\r\nmake his last guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then,\" said the Scarecrow, with a sigh. \"Run along, little\r\nDorothy, and may good luck go with you!\"\r\n\r\nSo Dorothy, trying to be brave in spite of her fears, passed through the\r\ndoorway into the gorgeous rooms of the palace. The stillness of the\r\nplace awed her, at first, and the child drew short breaths, and pressed\r\nher hand to her heart, and looked all around with wondering eyes.\r\n\r\nYes, it was a beautiful place; but enchantments lurked in every nook and\r\ncorner, and she had not yet grown accustomed to the wizardries of these\r\nfairy countries, so different from the quiet and sensible common-places\r\nof her own native land.\r\n\r\nSlowly she passed through several rooms until she came upon Tiktok,\r\nstanding motionless. It really seemed, then, that she had found a friend\r\nin this mysterious palace, so she hastened to wind up the machine man's\r\naction and speech and thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Dor-oth-y,\" were his first words. \"I have now one more guess\r\nto make.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, be very careful, Tiktok; won't you?\" cried the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. But the Nome King has us in his power, and he has set a trap for\r\nus. I fear we are all lost,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"I fear so, too,\" said Dorothy, sadly.\r\n\r\n\"If Smith & Tin-ker had giv-en me a guess-ing clock-work at-tach-ment,\"\r\ncontinued Tiktok, \"I might have de-fied the Nome King. But my thoughts\r\nare plain and sim-ple, and are not of much use in this case.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do the best you can,\" said Dorothy, encouragingly, \"and if you fail I\r\nwill watch and see what shape you are changed into.\"\r\n\r\nSo Tiktok touched a yellow glass vase that had daisies painted on one\r\nside, and he spoke at the same time the word \"Ev.\"\r\n\r\nIn a flash the machine man had disappeared, and although the girl looked\r\nquickly in every direction, she could not tell which of the many\r\nornaments the room contained had a moment before been her faithful\r\nfriend and servant.\r\n\r\nSo all she could do was to accept the hopeless task set her, and make\r\nher guesses and abide by the result.\r\n\r\n\"It can't hurt very much,\" she thought, \"for I haven't heard any of them\r\nscream or cry out--not even the poor officers. Dear me! I wonder if\r\nUncle Henry or Aunt Em will ever know I have become an orn'ment in the\r\nNome King's palace, and must stand forever and ever in one place and\r\nlook pretty--'cept when I'm moved to be dusted. It isn't the way I\r\nthought I'd turn out, at all; but I s'pose it can't be helped.\"\r\n\r\nShe walked through all the rooms once more, and examined with care all\r\nthe objects they contained; but there were so many, they bewildered her,\r\nand she decided, after all, as Ozma had done, that it could be only\r\nguess work at the best, and that the chances were much against her\r\nguessing aright.\r\n\r\nTimidly she touched an alabaster bowl and said: \"Ev.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's one failure, anyhow,\" she thought. \"But how am I to know which\r\nthing is enchanted, and which is not?\"\r\n\r\nNext she touched the image of a purple kitten that stood on the corner\r\nof a mantel, and as she pronounced the word \"Ev\" the kitten disappeared,\r\nand a pretty, fair-haired boy stood beside her. At the same time a bell\r\nrang somewhere in the distance, and as Dorothy started back, partly in\r\nsurprise and partly in joy, the little one exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Where am I? And who are you? And what has happened to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I declare!\" said Dorothy. \"I've really done it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Done what?\" asked the boy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Saved myself from being an ornament,\" replied the girl, with a laugh,\r\n\"and saved you from being forever a purple kitten.\"\r\n\r\n\"A purple kitten?\" he repeated. \"There _is_ no such thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" she answered. \"But there was, a minute ago. Don't you remember\r\nstanding on a corner of the mantel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not. I am a Prince of Ev, and my name is Evring,\" the little\r\none announced, proudly. \"But my father, the King, sold my mother and all\r\nher children to the cruel ruler of the Nomes, and after that I remember\r\nnothing at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"A purple kitten can't be 'spected to remember, Evring,\" said Dorothy.\r\n\"But now you are yourself again, and I'm going to try to save some of\r\nyour brothers and sisters, and perhaps your mother, as well. So come\r\nwith me.\"\r\n\r\nShe seized the child's hand and eagerly hurried here and there, trying\r\nto decide which object to choose next. The third guess was another\r\nfailure, and so was the fourth and the fifth.\r\n\r\nLittle Evring could not imagine what she was doing, but he trotted along\r\nbeside her very willingly, for he liked the new companion he had found.\r\n\r\nDorothy's further quest proved unsuccessful; but after her first\r\ndisappointment was over, the little girl was filled with joy and\r\nthankfulness to think that after all she had been able to save one\r\nmember of the royal family of Ev, and could restore the little Prince to\r\nhis sorrowing country. Now she might return to the terrible Nome King in\r\nsafety, carrying with her the prize she had won in the person of the\r\nfair-haired boy.\r\n\r\nSo she retraced her steps until she found the entrance to the palace,\r\nand as she approached, the massive doors of rock opened of their own\r\naccord, allowing both Dorothy and Evring to pass the portals and enter\r\nthe throne room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBillina Frightens the Nome King\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nNow when Dorothy had entered the palace to make her guesses and the\r\nScarecrow was left with the Nome King, the two sat in moody silence for\r\nseveral minutes. Then the monarch exclaimed, in a tone of satisfaction:\r\n\r\n\"Very good!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is very good?\" asked the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"The machine man. He won't need to be wound up any more, for he has now\r\nbecome a very neat ornament. Very neat, indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about Dorothy?\" the Scarecrow enquired.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, she will begin to guess, pretty soon,\" said the King, cheerfully.\r\n\"And then she will join my collection, and it will be your turn.\"\r\n\r\nThe good Scarecrow was much distressed by the thought that his little\r\nfriend was about to suffer the fate of Ozma and the rest of their party;\r\nbut while he sat in gloomy reverie a shrill voice suddenly cried:\r\n\r\n\"Kut, kut, kut--ka-daw-kutt! Kut, kut, kut--ka-daw-kutt!\"\r\n\r\nThe Nome King nearly jumped off his seat, he was so startled.\r\n\r\n\"Good gracious! What's that?\" he yelled.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's Billina,\" said the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by making a noise like that?\" shouted the King,\r\nangrily, as the yellow hen came from under the throne and strutted\r\nproudly about the room.\r\n\r\n\"I've got a right to cackle, I guess,\" replied Billina. \"I've just laid\r\nmy egg.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Laid an egg! In my throne room! How dare you do such a thing?\"\r\nasked the King, in a voice of fury.\r\n\r\n\"I lay eggs wherever I happen to be,\" said the hen, ruffling her\r\nfeathers and then shaking them into place.\r\n\r\n\"But--thunder-ation! Don't you know that eggs are poison?\" roared the\r\nKing, while his rock-colored eyes stuck out in great terror.\r\n\r\n\"Poison! well, I declare,\" said Billina, indignantly. \"I'll have you\r\nknow all my eggs are warranted strictly fresh and up to date. Poison,\r\nindeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't understand,\" retorted the little monarch, nervously. \"Eggs\r\nbelong only to the outside world--to the world on the earth's surface,\r\nwhere you came from. Here, in my underground kingdom, they are rank\r\npoison, as I said, and we Nomes can't bear them around.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you'll have to bear this one around,\" declared Billina; \"for I've\r\nlaid it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" asked the King.\r\n\r\n\"Under your throne,\" said the hen.\r\n\r\nThe King jumped three feet into the air, so anxious was he to get away\r\nfrom the throne.\r\n\r\n\"Take it away! Take it away at once!\" he shouted.\r\n\r\n\"I can't,\" said Billina. \"I havn't any hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll take the egg,\" said the Scarecrow. \"I'm making a collection of\r\nBillina's eggs. There's one in my pocket now, that she laid yesterday.\"\r\n\r\nHearing this, the monarch hastened to put a good distance between\r\nhimself and the Scarecrow, who was about to reach under the throne for\r\nthe egg when the hen suddenly cried:\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong?\" asked the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"Don't take the egg unless the King will allow me to enter the palace\r\nand guess as the others have done,\" said Billina.\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw!\" returned the King. \"You're only a hen. How could you guess my\r\nenchantments?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can try, I suppose,\" said Billina. \"And, if I fail, you will have\r\nanother ornament.\"\r\n\r\n\"A pretty ornament you'd make, wouldn't you?\" growled the King. \"But you\r\nshall have your way. It will properly punish you for daring to lay an\r\negg in my presence. After the Scarecrow is enchanted you shall follow\r\nhim into the palace. But how will you touch the objects?\"\r\n\r\n\"With my claws,\" said the hen; \"and I can speak the word 'Ev' as plainly\r\nas anyone. Also I must have the right to guess the enchantments of my\r\nfriends, and to release them if I succeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said the King. \"You have my promise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Billina to the Scarecrow, \"you may get the egg.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"DON'T YOU KNOW THAT EGGS ARE POISON?\"]\r\n\r\nHe knelt down and reached underneath the throne and found the egg,\r\nwhich he placed in another pocket of his jacket, fearing that if both\r\neggs were in one pocket they would knock together and get broken.\r\n\r\nJust then a bell above the throne rang briskly, and the King gave\r\nanother nervous jump.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well!\" said he, with a rueful face; \"the girl has actually done\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Done what?\" asked the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"She has made one guess that is right, and broken one of my neatest\r\nenchantments. By ricketty, it's too bad! I never thought she would do\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do I understand that she will now return to us in safety?\" enquired the\r\nScarecrow, joyfully wrinkling his painted face into a broad smile.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said the King, fretfully pacing up and down the room. \"I\r\nalways keep my promises, no matter how foolish they are. But I shall\r\nmake an ornament of the yellow hen to replace the one I have just lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you will, and perhaps you won't,\" murmured Billina, calmly. \"I\r\nmay surprise you by guessing right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Guessing right?\" snapped the King. \"How should you guess right, where\r\nyour betters have failed, you stupid fowl?\"\r\n\r\nBillina did not care to answer this question, and a moment later the\r\ndoors flew open and Dorothy entered, leading the little Prince Evring by\r\nthe hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow welcomed the girl with a close embrace, and he would have\r\nembraced Evring, too, in his delight. But the little Prince was shy, and\r\nshrank away from the painted Scarecrow because he did not yet know his\r\nmany excellent qualities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"BY RICKETTY, IT'S TOO BAD!\"]\r\n\r\nBut there was little time for the friends to talk, because the Scarecrow\r\nmust now enter the palace. Dorothy's success had greatly encouraged\r\nhim, and they both hoped he would manage to make at least one correct\r\nguess.\r\n\r\nHowever, he proved as unfortunate as the others except Dorothy, and\r\nalthough he took a good deal of time to select his objects, not one did\r\nthe poor Scarecrow guess aright.\r\n\r\nSo he became a solid gold card-receiver, and the beautiful but terrible\r\npalace awaited its next visitor.\r\n\r\n\"It's all over,\" remarked the King, with a sigh of satisfaction; \"and it\r\nhas been a very amusing performance, except for the one good guess the\r\nKansas girl made. I am richer by a great many pretty ornaments.\r\n\r\n\"It is my turn, now,\" said Billina, briskly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'd forgotten you,\" said the King. \"But you needn't go if you don't\r\nwish to. I will be generous, and let you off.\"\r\n\r\n\"No you won't,\" replied the hen. \"I insist upon having my guesses, as\r\nyou promised.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then go ahead, you absurd feathered fool!\" grumbled the King, and he\r\ncaused the opening that led to the palace to appear once more.\r\n\r\n\"Don't go, Billina,\" said Dorothy, earnestly. \"It isn't easy to guess\r\nthose orn'ments, and only luck saved me from being one myself. Stay with\r\nme, and we'll go back to the Land of Ev together. I'm sure this little\r\nPrince will give us a home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I will,\" said Evring, with much dignity.\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry, my dear,\" cried Billina, with a cluck that was meant for a\r\nlaugh. \"I may not be human, but I'm no fool, if I _am_ a chicken.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Billina!\" said Dorothy, \"you haven't been a chicken in a long time.\r\nNot since you--you've been--grown up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps that's true,\" answered Billina, thoughtfully. \"But if a Kansas\r\nfarmer sold me to some one, what would he call me?--a hen or a chicken!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not a Kansas farmer, Billina,\" replied the girl, \"and you\r\nsaid--\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind that, Dorothy. I'm going. I won't say good-bye, because I'm\r\ncoming back. Keep up your courage, for I'll see you a little later.\"\r\n\r\nThen Billina gave several loud \"cluck-clucks\" that seemed to make the\r\nfat little King _more_ nervous than ever, and marched through the\r\nentrance into the enchanted palace.\r\n\r\n\"I hope I've seen the last of _that_ bird,\" declared the monarch,\r\nseating himself again in his throne and mopping the perspiration from\r\nhis forehead with his rock-colored handkerchief. \"Hens are bothersome\r\nenough at their best, but when they can talk they're simply dreadful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Billina's my friend,\" said Dorothy quietly. \"She may not always be\r\n'zactly polite; but she _means_ well, I'm sure.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPurple, Green and Gold\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe yellow hen, stepping high and with an air of vast importance, walked\r\nslowly over the rich velvet carpets of the splendid palace, examining\r\neverything she met with her sharp little eyes.\r\n\r\nBillina had a right to feel important; for she alone shared the Nome\r\nKing's secret and knew how to tell the objects that were transformations\r\nfrom those that had never been alive. She was very sure that her guesses\r\nwould be correct, but before she began to make them she was curious to\r\nbehold all the magnificence of this underground palace, which was\r\nperhaps one of the most splendid and beautiful places in any fairyland.\r\n\r\nAs she went through the rooms she counted the purple ornaments; and\r\nalthough some were small and hidden in queer places, Billina spied them\r\nall, and found the entire ten scattered about the various rooms. The\r\ngreen ornaments she did not bother to count, for she thought she could\r\nfind them all when the time came.\r\n\r\nFinally, having made a survey of the entire palace and enjoyed its\r\nsplendor, the yellow hen returned to one of the rooms where she had\r\nnoticed a large purple footstool. She placed a claw upon this and said\r\n\"Ev,\" and at once the footstool vanished and a lovely lady, tall and\r\nslender and most beautifully robed, stood before her.\r\n\r\nThe lady's eyes were round with astonishment for a moment, for she could\r\nnot remember her transformation, nor imagine what had restored her to\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, ma'am,\" said Billina, in her sharp voice. \"You're looking\r\nquite well, considering your age.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who speaks?\" demanded the Queen of Ev, drawing herself up proudly.\r\n\r\n\"Why, my name's Bill, by rights,\" answered the hen, who was now perched\r\nupon the back of a chair; \"although Dorothy has put scollops on it and\r\nmade it Billina. But the name doesn't matter. I've saved you from the\r\nNome King, and you are a slave no longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I thank you for the gracious favor,\" said the Queen, with a\r\ngraceful courtesy. \"But, my children--tell me, I beg of you--where are\r\nmy children?\" and she clasped her hands in anxious entreaty.\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry,\" advised Billina, pecking at a tiny bug that was crawling\r\nover the chair back. \"Just at present they are out of mischief and\r\nperfectly safe, for they can't even wiggle.\"\r\n\r\n\"What mean you, O kindly stranger?\" asked the Queen, striving to repress\r\nher anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"They're enchanted,\" said Billina, \"just as you have been--all, that is,\r\nexcept the little fellow Dorothy picked out. And the chances are that\r\nthey have been good boys and girls for some time, because they couldn't\r\nhelp it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my poor darlings!\" cried the Queen, with a sob of anguish.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" returned the hen. \"Don't let their condition make you\r\nunhappy, ma'am, because I'll soon have them crowding 'round to bother\r\nand worry you as naturally as ever. Come with me, if you please, and\r\nI'll show you how pretty they look.\"\r\n\r\nShe flew down from her perch and walked into the next room, the Queen\r\nfollowing. As she passed a low table a small green grasshopper caught\r\nher eye, and instantly Billina pounced upon it and snapped it up in her\r\nsharp bill. For grasshoppers are a favorite food with hens, and they\r\nusually must be caught quickly, before they can hop away. It might\r\neasily have been the end of Ozma of Oz, had she been a real grasshopper\r\ninstead of an emerald one. But Billina found the grasshopper hard and\r\nlifeless, and suspecting it was not good to eat she quickly dropped it\r\ninstead of letting it slide down her throat.\r\n\r\n\"I might have known better,\" she muttered to herself, \"for where there\r\nis no grass there can be no live grasshoppers. This is probably one of\r\nthe King's transformations.\"\r\n\r\nA moment later she approached one of the purple ornaments, and while the\r\nQueen watched her curiously the hen broke the Nome King's enchantment\r\nand a sweet-faced girl, whose golden hair fell in a cloud over her\r\nshoulders, stood beside them.\r\n\r\n\"Evanna!\" cried the Queen, \"my own Evanna!\" and she clasped the girl to\r\nher bosom and covered her face with kisses.\r\n\r\n\"That's all right,\" said Billina, contentedly. \"Am I a good guesser, Mr.\r\nNome King? Well, I guess!\"\r\n\r\nThen she disenchanted another girl, whom the Queen addressed as Evrose,\r\nand afterwards a boy named Evardo, who was older than his brother\r\nEvring. Indeed, the yellow hen kept the good Queen exclaiming and\r\nembracing for some time, until five Princesses and four Princes, all\r\nlooking very much alike except for the difference in size, stood in a\r\nrow beside their happy mother.\r\n\r\nThe Princesses were named, Evanna, Evrose, Evella, Evirene and Evedna,\r\nwhile the Princes were Evrob, Evington, Evardo and Evroland. Of these\r\nEvardo was the eldest and would inherit his father's throne and be\r\ncrowned King of Ev when he returned to his own country. He was a grave\r\nand quiet youth, and would doubtless rule his people wisely and with\r\njustice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE QUEEN OF EV THANKS BILLINA]\r\n\r\nBillina, having restored all of the royal family of Ev to their proper\r\nforms, now began to select the green ornaments which were the\r\ntransformations of the people of Oz. She had little trouble in finding\r\nthese, and before long all the twenty-six officers, as well as the\r\nprivate, were gathered around the yellow hen, joyfully congratulating\r\nher upon their release. The thirty-seven people who were now alive in\r\nthe rooms of the palace knew very well that they owed their freedom to\r\nthe cleverness of the yellow hen, and they were earnest in thanking her\r\nfor saving them from the magic of the Nome King.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Billina, \"I must find Ozma. She is sure to be here,\r\nsomewhere, and of course she is green, being from Oz. So look around,\r\nyou stupid soldiers, and help me in my search.\"\r\n\r\nFor a while, however, they could discover nothing more that was green.\r\nBut the Queen, who had kissed all her nine children once more and could\r\nnow find time to take an interest in what was going on, said to the hen:\r\n\r\n\"Mayhap, my gentle friend, it is the grasshopper whom you seek.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course it's the grasshopper!\" exclaimed Billina. \"I declare, I'm\r\nnearly as stupid as these brave soldiers. Wait here for me, and I'll go\r\nback and get it.\"\r\n\r\nSo she went into the room where she had seen the grasshopper, and\r\npresently Ozma of Oz, as lovely and dainty as ever, entered and\r\napproached the Queen of Ev, greeting her as one high born princess\r\ngreets another.\r\n\r\n\"But where are my friends, the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman?\" asked the\r\ngirl Ruler, when these courtesies had been exchanged.\r\n\r\n\"I'll hunt them up,\" replied Billina. \"The Scarecrow is solid gold, and\r\nso is Tiktok; but I don't exactly know what the Tin Woodman is, because\r\nthe Nome King said he had been transformed into something funny.\"\r\n\r\nOzma eagerly assisted the hen in her quest, and soon the Scarecrow and\r\nthe machine man, being ornaments of shining gold, were discovered and\r\nrestored to their accustomed forms. But, search as they might, in no\r\nplace could they find a funny ornament that might be the transformation\r\nof the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n\"Only one thing can be done,\" said Ozma, at last, \"and that is to return\r\nto the Nome King and oblige him to tell us what has become of our\r\nfriend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he won't,\" suggested Billina.\r\n\r\n\"He must,\" returned Ozma, firmly. \"The King has not treated us honestly,\r\nfor under the mask of fairness and good nature he entrapped us all, and\r\nwe would have been forever enchanted had not our wise and clever friend,\r\nthe yellow hen, found a way to save us.\"\r\n\r\n\"The King is a villain,\" declared the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"His laugh is worse than another man's frown,\" said the private, with a\r\nshudder.\r\n\r\n\"I thought he was hon-est, but I was mis-tak-en,\" remarked Tiktok. \"My\r\nthoughts are us-u-al-ly cor-rect, but it is Smith & Tin-ker's fault if\r\nthey some-times go wrong or do not work prop-er-ly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Smith & Tinker made a very good job of you,\" said Ozma, kindly. \"I do\r\nnot think they should be blamed if you are not quite perfect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" replied Tiktok.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Billina, in her brisk little voice, \"let us all go back to\r\nthe Nome King, and see what he has to say for himself.\"\r\n\r\nSo they started for the entrance, Ozma going first, with the Queen and\r\nher train of little Princes and Princesses following. Then came Tiktok,\r\nand the Scarecrow with Billina perched upon his straw-stuffed shoulder.\r\nThe twenty-seven officers and the private brought up the rear.\r\n\r\nAs they reached the hall the doors flew open before them; but then they\r\nall stopped and stared into the domed cavern with faces of astonishment\r\nand dismay. For the room was filled with the mail-clad warriors of the\r\nNome King, rank after rank standing in orderly array. The electric\r\nlights upon their brows gleamed brightly, their battle-axes were poised\r\nas if to strike down their foes; yet they remained motionless as\r\nstatues, awaiting the word of command.\r\n\r\nAnd in the center of this terrible army sat the little King upon his\r\nthrone of rock. But he neither smiled nor laughed. Instead, his face was\r\ndistorted with rage, and most dreadful to behold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow Wins the Fight\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Billina had entered the palace Dorothy and Evring sat down to\r\nawait the success or failure of her mission, and the Nome King occupied\r\nhis throne and smoked his long pipe for a while in a cheerful and\r\ncontented mood.\r\n\r\nThen the bell above the throne, which sounded whenever an enchantment\r\nwas broken, began to ring, and the King gave a start of annoyance and\r\nexclaimed, \"Rocketty-ricketts!\"\r\n\r\nWhen the bell rang a second time the King shouted angrily, \"Smudge and\r\nblazes!\" and at a third ring he screamed in a fury, \"Hippikaloric!\"\r\nwhich must be a dreadful word because we don't know what it means.\r\n\r\nAfter that the bell went on ringing time after time; but the King was\r\nnow so violently enraged that he could not utter a word, but hopped out\r\nof his throne and all around the room in a mad frenzy, so that he\r\nreminded Dorothy of a jumping-jack.\r\n\r\nThe girl was, for her part, filled with joy at every peal of the bell,\r\nfor it announced the fact that Billina had transformed one more ornament\r\ninto a living person. Dorothy was also amazed at Billina's success, for\r\nshe could not imagine how the yellow hen was able to guess correctly\r\nfrom all the bewildering number of articles clustered in the rooms of\r\nthe palace. But after she had counted ten, and the bell continued to\r\nring, she knew that not only the royal family of Ev, but Ozma and her\r\nfollowers also, were being restored to their natural forms, and she was\r\nso delighted that the antics of the angry King only made her laugh\r\nmerrily.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the little monarch could not be more furious than he was before,\r\nbut the girl's laughter nearly drove him frantic, and he roared at her\r\nlike a savage beast. Then, as he found that all his enchantments were\r\nlikely to be dispelled and his victims every one set free, he suddenly\r\nran to the little door that opened upon the balcony and gave the shrill\r\nwhistle that summoned his warriors.\r\n\r\nAt once the army filed out of the gold and silver doors in great\r\nnumbers, and marched up a winding stairs and into the throne room, led\r\nby a stern featured Nome who was their captain. When they had nearly\r\nfilled the throne room they formed ranks in the big underground cavern\r\nbelow, and then stood still until they were told what to do next.\r\n\r\nDorothy had pressed back to one side of the cavern when the warriors\r\nentered, and now she stood holding little Prince Evring's hand while the\r\ngreat Lion crouched upon one side and the enormous Tiger crouched an the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\n\"Seize that girl!\" shouted the King to his captain, and a group of\r\nwarriors sprang forward to obey. But both the Lion and Tiger snarled so\r\nfiercely and bared their strong, sharp teeth so threateningly, that the\r\nmen drew back in alarm.\r\n\r\n\"Don't mind them!\" cried the Nome King; \"they cannot leap beyond the\r\nplaces where they now stand.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they can bite those who attempt to touch the girl,\" said the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n\"I'll fix that,\" answered the King. \"I'll enchant them again, so that\r\nthey can't open their jaws.\"\r\n\r\nHe stepped out of the throne to do this, but just then the Sawhorse ran\r\nup behind him and gave the fat monarch a powerful kick with both his\r\nwooden hind legs.\r\n\r\n\"Ow! Murder! Treason!\" yelled the King, who had been hurled against\r\nseveral of his warriors and was considerably bruised. \"Who did that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" growled the Sawhorse, viciously. \"You let Dorothy alone, or\r\nI'll kick you again.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll see about that,\" replied the King, and at once he waved his hand\r\ntoward the Sawhorse and muttered a magical word. \"Aha!\" he continued;\r\n\"_now_ let us see you move, you wooden mule!\"\r\n\r\nBut in spite of the magic the Sawhorse moved; and he moved so quickly\r\ntoward the King, that the fat little man could not get out of his way.\r\nThump--_bang!_ came the wooden heels, right against his round body, and\r\nthe King flew into the air and fell upon the head of his captain, who\r\nlet him drop flat upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well!\" said the King, sitting up and looking surprised. \"Why\r\ndidn't my magic belt work, I wonder?\"\r\n\r\n\"The creature is made of wood,\" replied the captain. \"Your magic will\r\nnot work on wood, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I'd forgotten that,\" said the King, getting up and limping to his\r\nthrone. \"Very well, let the girl alone. She can't escape us, anyway.\"\r\n\r\nThe warriors, who had been rather confused by these incidents, now\r\nformed their ranks again, and the Sawhorse pranced across the room to\r\nDorothy and took a position beside the Hungry Tiger.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the doors that led to the palace flew open and the people\r\nof Ev and the people of Oz were disclosed to view. They paused,\r\nastonished, at sight of the warriors and the angry Nome King, seated in\r\ntheir midst.\r\n\r\n\"Surrender!\" cried the King, in a loud voice. \"You are my prisoners.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go 'long!\" answered Billina, from the Scarecrow's shoulder. \"You\r\npromised me that if I guessed correctly my friends and I might depart in\r\nsafety. And you always keep your promises.\"\r\n\r\n\"I said you might leave the palace in safety,\" retorted the King; \"and\r\nso you may, but you cannot leave my dominions. You are my prisoners, and\r\nI will hurl you all into my underground dungeons, where the volcanic\r\nfires glow and the molten lava flows in every direction, and the air is\r\nhotter than blue blazes.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"HELP, HELP!\" SCREAMED THE KING]\r\n\r\n\"That will be the end of me, all right,\" said the Scarecrow,\r\nsorrowfully. \"One small blaze, blue or green, is enough to reduce me to\r\nan ash-heap.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you surrender?\" demanded the King.\r\n\r\nBillina whispered something in the Scarecrow's ear that made him smile\r\nand put his hands in his jacket pockets.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" returned Ozma, boldly answering the King. Then she said to her\r\narmy:\r\n\r\n\"Forward, my brave soldiers, and fight for your Ruler and yourselves,\r\nunto death!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, Most Royal Ozma,\" replied one of her generals; \"but I find\r\nthat I and my brother officers all suffer from heart disease, and the\r\nslightest excitement might kill us. If we fight we may get excited.\r\nWould it not be well for us to avoid this grave danger?\"\r\n\r\n\"Soldiers should not have heart disease,\" said Ozma.\r\n\r\n\"Private soldiers are not, I believe, afflicted that way,\" declared\r\nanother general, twirling his moustache thoughtfully. \"If your Royal\r\nHighness desires, we will order our private to attack yonder warriors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do so,\" replied Ozma.\r\n\r\n\"For-ward--march!\" cried all the generals, with one voice.\r\n\"For-ward--march!\" yelled the colonels. \"For-ward--march!\" shouted the\r\nmajors. \"For-ward--march!\" commanded the captains.\r\n\r\nAnd at that the private leveled his spear and dashed furiously upon the\r\nfoe.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the Nomes was so surprised by this sudden onslaught that\r\nhe forgot to command his warriors to fight, so that the ten men in the\r\nfirst row, who stood in front of the private's spear, fell over like so\r\nmany toy soldiers. The spear could not go through their steel armor,\r\nhowever, so the warriors scrambled to their feet again, and by that time\r\nthe private had knocked over another row of them.\r\n\r\nThen the captain brought down his battle-axe with such a strong blow\r\nthat the private's spear was shattered and knocked from his grasp, and\r\nhe was helpless to fight any longer.\r\n\r\nThe Nome King had left his throne and pressed through his warriors to\r\nthe front ranks, so he could see what was going on; but as he faced Ozma\r\nand her friends the Scarecrow, as if aroused to action by the valor of\r\nthe private, drew one of Billina's eggs from his right jacket pocket and\r\nhurled it straight at the little monarch's head.\r\n\r\nIt struck him squarely in his left eye, where the egg smashed and\r\nscattered, as eggs will, and covered his face and hair and beard with\r\nits sticky contents.\r\n\r\n\"Help, help!\" screamed the King, clawing with his fingers at the egg, in\r\na struggle to remove it.\r\n\r\n\"An egg! an egg! Run for your lives!\" shouted the captain of the Nomes,\r\nin a voice of horror.\r\n\r\nAnd how they _did_ run! The warriors fairly tumbled over one another in\r\ntheir efforts to escape the fatal poison of that awful egg, and those\r\nwho could not rush down the winding stair fell off the balcony into the\r\ngreat cavern beneath, knocking over those who stood below them.\r\n\r\nEven while the King was still yelling for help his throne room became\r\nemptied of every one of his warriors, and before the monarch had managed\r\nto clear the egg away from his left eye the Scarecrow threw the second\r\negg against his right eye, where it smashed and blinded him entirely.\r\nThe King was unable to flee because he could not see which way to run;\r\nso he stood still and howled and shouted and screamed in abject fear.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on, Billina flew over to Dorothy, and perching\r\nherself upon the Lion's back the hen whispered eagerly to the girl:\r\n\r\n\"Get his belt! Get the Nome King's jeweled belt! It unbuckles in the\r\nback. Quick, Dorothy--quick!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fate of the Tin Woodman\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nDorothy obeyed. She ran at once behind the Nome King, who was still\r\ntrying to free his eyes from the egg, and in a twinkling she had\r\nunbuckled his splendid jeweled belt and carried it away with her to her\r\nplace beside the Tiger and Lion, where, because she did not know what\r\nelse to do with it, she fastened it around her own slim waist.\r\n\r\nJust then the Chief Steward rushed in with a sponge and a bowl of water,\r\nand began mopping away the broken eggs from his master's face. In a few\r\nminutes, and while all the party stood looking on, the King regained\r\nthe use of his eyes, and the first thing he did was to glare wickedly\r\nupon the Scarecrow and exclaim:\r\n\r\n\"I'll make you suffer for this, you hay-stuffed dummy! Don't you know\r\neggs are poison to Nomes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Really,\" said the Scarecrow, \"they _don't_ seem to agree with you,\r\nalthough I wonder why.\"\r\n\r\n\"They were strictly fresh and above suspicion,\" said Billina. \"You ought\r\nto be glad to get them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll transform you all into scorpions!\" cried the King, angrily, and\r\nbegan waving his arms and muttering magic words.\r\n\r\nBut none of the people became scorpions, so the King stopped and looked\r\nat them in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you are not wearing your magic belt,\" replied the Chief Steward,\r\nafter looking the King over carefully. \"Where is it? What have you done\r\nwith it?\"\r\n\r\nThe Nome King clapped his hand to his waist, and his rock colored face\r\nturned white as chalk.\r\n\r\n\"It's gone,\" he cried, helplessly. \"It's gone, and I am ruined!\"\r\n\r\nDorothy now stepped forward and said:\r\n\r\n\"Royal Ozma, and you, Queen of Ev, I welcome you and your people back to\r\nthe land of the living. Billina has saved you from your troubles, and\r\nnow we will leave this drea'ful place, and return to Ev as soon as\r\nposs'ble.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the child spoke they could all see that she wore the magic belt,\r\nand a great cheer went up from all her friends, which was led by the\r\nvoices of the Scarecrow and the private. But the Nome King did not join\r\nthem. He crept back onto his throne like a whipped dog, and lay there\r\nbitterly bemoaning his defeat.\r\n\r\n\"But we have not yet found my faithful follower, the Tin Woodman,\" said\r\nOzma to Dorothy, \"and without him I do not wish to go away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I,\" replied Dorothy, quickly. \"Wasn't he in the palace?\"\r\n\r\n\"He must be there,\" said Billina; \"but I had no clew to guide me in\r\nguessing the Tin Woodman, so I must have missed him.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will go back into the rooms,\" said Dorothy. \"This magic belt, I am\r\nsure, will help us to find our dear old friend.\"\r\n\r\nSo she re-entered the palace, the doors of which still stood open, and\r\neveryone followed her except the Nome King, the Queen of Ev and Prince\r\nEvring. The mother had taken the little Prince in her lap and was\r\nfondling and kissing him lovingly, for he was her youngest born.\r\n\r\nBut the others went with Dorothy, and when she came to the middle of the\r\nfirst room the girl waved her hand, as she had seen the King do, and\r\ncommanded the Tin Woodman, whatever form he might then have, to resume\r\nhis proper shape. No result followed this attempt, so Dorothy went into\r\nanother room and repeated it, and so through all the rooms of the\r\npalace. Yet the Tin Woodman did not appear to them, nor could they\r\nimagine which among the thousands of ornaments was their transformed\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nSadly they returned to the throne room, where the King, seeing that they\r\nhad met with failure, jeered at Dorothy, saying:\r\n\r\n\"You do not know how to use my belt, so it is of no use to you. Give it\r\nback to me and I will let you go free--you and all the people who came\r\nwith you. As for the royal family of Ev, they are my slaves, and shall\r\nremain here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall keep the belt,\" said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"But how can you escape, without my consent?\" asked the King.\r\n\r\n\"Easily enough,\" answered the girl. \"All we need to do is to walk out\r\nthe way that we came in.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOROTHY AND BILLINA ARGUE WITH THE KING]\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's all, is it?\" sneered the King. \"Well, where is the passage\r\nthrough which you entered this room?\"\r\n\r\nThey all looked around, but could not discover the place, for it had\r\nlong since been closed. Dorothy, however, would not be dismayed. She\r\nwaved her hand toward the seemingly solid wall of the cavern and said:\r\n\r\n\"I command the passage to open!\"\r\n\r\nInstantly the order was obeyed; the opening appeared and the passage lay\r\nplainly before them.\r\n\r\nThe King was amazed, and all the others overjoyed.\r\n\r\n\"Why, then, if the belt obeys you, were we unable to discover the Tin\r\nWoodman?\" asked Ozma.\r\n\r\n\"I can't imagine,\" said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"See here, girl,\" proposed the King, eagerly; \"give me the belt, and I\r\nwill tell you what shape the Tin Woodman was changed into, and then you\r\ncan easily find him.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy hesitated, but Billina cried out:\r\n\r\n\"Don't you do it! If the Nome King gets the belt again he will make\r\nevery one of us prisoners, for we will be in his power. Only by keeping\r\nthe belt, Dorothy, will you ever be able to leave this place in\r\nsafety.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that is true,\" said the Scarecrow. \"But I have another idea,\r\ndue to my excellent brains. Let Dorothy transform the King into a\r\ngoose-egg unless he agrees to go into the palace and bring out to us the\r\nornament which is our friend Nick Chopper, the Tin Woodman.\"\r\n\r\n\"A goose-egg!\" echoed the horrified King. \"How dreadful!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Well, a goose-egg you will be unless you go and fetch us the ornament\r\nwe want,\" declared Billina, with a joyful chuckle.\r\n\r\n\"You can see for yourself that Dorothy is able to use the magic belt all\r\nright,\" added the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\nThe Nome King thought it over and finally consented, for he did not want\r\nto be a goose-egg. So he went into the palace to get the ornament which\r\nwas the transformation of the Tin Woodman, and they all awaited his\r\nreturn with considerable impatience, for they were anxious to leave this\r\nunderground cavern and see the sunshine once more. But when the Nome\r\nKing came back he brought nothing with him except a puzzled and anxious\r\nexpression upon his face.\r\n\r\n\"He's gone!\" he said. \"The Tin Woodman is nowhere in the palace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure?\" asked Ozma, sternly.\r\n\r\n\"I'm very sure,\" answered the King, trembling, \"for I know just what I\r\ntransformed him into, and exactly where he stood. But he is not there,\r\nand please don't change me into a goose-egg, because I've done the best\r\nI could.\"\r\n\r\nThey were all silent for a time, and then Dorothy said:\r\n\r\n\"There is no use punishing the Nome King any more, and I'm 'fraid we'll\r\nhave to go away without our friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he is not here, we cannot rescue him,\" agreed the Scarecrow, sadly.\r\n\"Poor Nick! I wonder what has become of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he owed me six weeks back pay!\" said one of the generals, wiping\r\nthe tears from his eyes with his gold-laced coat sleeve.\r\n\r\nVery sorrowfully they determined to return to the upper world without\r\ntheir former companion, and so Ozma gave the order to begin the march\r\nthrough the passage.\r\n\r\nThe army went first, and then the royal family of Ev, and afterward came\r\nDorothy, Ozma, Billina, the Scarecrow and Tiktok.\r\n\r\nThey left the Nome King scowling at them from his throne, and had no\r\nthought of danger until Ozma chanced to look back and saw a large number\r\nof the warriors following them in full chase, with their swords and\r\nspears and axes raised to strike down the fugitives as soon as they drew\r\nnear enough.\r\n\r\nEvidently the Nome King had made this last attempt to prevent their\r\nescaping him; but it did him no good, for when Dorothy saw the danger\r\nthey were in she stopped and waved her hand and whispered a command to\r\nthe magic belt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nInstantly the foremost warriors became eggs, which rolled upon the floor\r\nof the cavern in such numbers that those behind could not advance\r\nwithout stepping upon them. But, when they saw the eggs, all desire to\r\nadvance departed from the warriors, and they turned and fled madly into\r\nthe cavern, and refused to go back again.\r\n\r\nOur friends had no farther trouble in reaching the end of the passage,\r\nand soon were standing in the outer air upon the gloomy path between\r\nthe two high mountains. But the way to Ev lay plainly before them, and\r\nthey fervently hoped that they had seen the last of the Nome King and of\r\nhis dreadful palace.\r\n\r\nThe cavalcade was led by Ozma, mounted on the Cowardly Lion, and the\r\nQueen of Ev, who rode upon the back of the Tiger. The children of the\r\nQueen walked behind her, hand in hand. Dorothy rode the Sawhorse, while\r\nthe Scarecrow walked and commanded the army in the absence of the Tin\r\nWoodman.\r\n\r\nPresently the way began to lighten and more of the sunshine to come in\r\nbetween the two mountains. And before long they heard the \"thump! thump!\r\nthump!\" of the giant's hammer upon the road.\r\n\r\n\"How may we pass the monstrous man of iron?\" asked the Queen, anxious\r\nfor the safety of her children. But Dorothy solved the problem by a word\r\nto the magic belt.\r\n\r\nThe giant paused, with his hammer held motionless in the air, thus\r\nallowing the entire party to pass between his cast-iron legs in safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe King of Ev\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there were any shifting, rock-colored Nomes on the mountain side now,\r\nthey were silent and respectful, for our adventurers were not annoyed,\r\nas before, by their impudent laughter. Really the Nomes had nothing to\r\nlaugh at, since the defeat of their King.\r\n\r\nOn the other side they found Ozma's golden chariot, standing as they had\r\nleft it. Soon the Lion and the Tiger were harnessed to the beautiful\r\nchariot, in which was enough room for Ozma and the Queen and six of the\r\nroyal children.\r\n\r\nLittle Evring preferred to ride with Dorothy upon the Sawhorse, which\r\nhad a long back. The Prince had recovered from his shyness and had\r\nbecome very fond of the girl who had rescued him, so they were fast\r\nfriends and chatted pleasantly together as they rode along. Billina was\r\nalso perched upon the head of the wooden steed, which seemed not to mind\r\nthe added weight in the least, and the boy was full of wonder that a hen\r\ncould talk, and say such sensible things.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the gulf, Ozma's magic carpet carried them all over in\r\nsafety; and now they began to pass the trees, in which birds were\r\nsinging; and the breeze that was wafted to them from the farms of Ev was\r\nspicy with flowers and new-mown hay; and the sunshine fell full upon\r\nthem, to warm them and drive away from their bodies the chill and\r\ndampness of the underground kingdom of the Nomes.\r\n\r\n\"I would be quite content,\" said the Scarecrow to Tiktok, \"were only the\r\nTin Woodman with us. But it breaks my heart to leave him behind.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was a fine fel-low,\" replied Tiktok, \"al-though his ma-ter-i-al was\r\nnot ve-ry du-ra-ble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, tin is an excellent material,\" the Scarecrow hastened to say; \"and\r\nif anything ever happened to poor Nick Chopper he was always easily\r\nsoldered. Besides, he did not have to be wound up, and was not liable\r\nto get out of order.\"\r\n\r\n\"I some-times wish,\" said Tiktok, \"that I was stuffed with straw, as you\r\nare. It is hard to be made of cop-per.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no reason to complain of my lot,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"A\r\nlittle fresh straw, now and then, makes me as good as new. But I can\r\nnever be the polished gentleman that my poor departed friend, the Tin\r\nWoodman, was.\"\r\n\r\nYou may be sure the royal children of Ev and their Queen mother were\r\ndelighted at seeing again their beloved country; and when the towers of\r\nthe palace of Ev came into view they could not forbear cheering at the\r\nsight. Little Evring, riding in front of Dorothy, was so overjoyed that\r\nhe took a curious tin whistle from his pocket and blew a shrill blast\r\nthat made the Sawhorse leap and prance in sudden alarm.\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" asked Billina, who had been obliged to flutter her wings\r\nin order to keep her seat upon the head of the frightened Sawhorse.\r\n\r\n\"That's my whistle,\" said Prince Evring, holding it out upon his hand.\r\n\r\nIt was in the shape of a little fat pig, made of tin and painted green.\r\nThe whistle was in the tail of the pig.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you get it?\" asked the yellow hen, closely examining the toy\r\nwith her bright eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I picked it up in the Nome King's palace, while Dorothy was making\r\nher guesses, and I put it in my pocket,\" answered the little Prince.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBillina laughed; or at least she made the peculiar cackle that served\r\nher for a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"No wonder I couldn't find the Tin Woodman,\" she said; \"and no wonder the\r\nmagic belt didn't make him appear, or the King couldn't find him,\r\neither!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" questioned Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Why, the Prince had him in his pocket,\" cried Billina, cackling again.\r\n\r\n\"I did not!\" protested little Evring. \"I only took the whistle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, watch me,\" returned the hen, and reaching out a claw she\r\ntouched the whistle and said \"Ev.\"\r\n\r\nSwish!\r\n\r\n\"Good afternoon,\" said the Tin Woodman, taking off his funnel cap and\r\nbowing to Dorothy and the Prince. \"I think I must have been asleep for\r\nthe first time since I was made of tin, for I do not remember our\r\nleaving the Nome King.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been enchanted,\" answered the girl, throwing an arm around her\r\nold friend and hugging him tight in her joy. \"But it's all right, now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want my whistle!\" said the little Prince, beginning to cry.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" cautioned Billina. \"The whistle is lost, but you may have\r\nanother when you get home.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"YOUR FUTURE RULER, KING EVARDO FIFTEENTH\"]\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow had fairly thrown himself upon the bosom of his old\r\ncomrade, so surprised and delighted was he to see him again, and Tiktok\r\nsqueezed the Tin Woodman's hand so earnestly that he dented some of his\r\nfingers. Then they had to make way for Ozma to welcome the tin man,\r\nand the army caught sight of him and set up a cheer, and everybody was\r\ndelighted and happy.\r\n\r\nFor the Tin Woodman was a great favorite with all who knew him, and his\r\nsudden recovery after they had thought he was lost to them forever was\r\nindeed a pleasant surprise.\r\n\r\nBefore long, the cavalcade arrived at the royal palace, where a great\r\ncrowd of people had gathered to welcome their Queen and her ten\r\nchildren. There was much shouting and cheering, and the people threw\r\nflowers in their path, and every face wore a happy smile.\r\n\r\nThey found the Princess Langwidere in her mirrored chamber, where she\r\nwas admiring one of her handsomest heads--one with rich chestnut hair,\r\ndreamy walnut eyes and a shapely hickorynut nose. She was very glad to\r\nbe relieved of her duties to the people of Ev, and the Queen graciously\r\npermitted her to retain her rooms and her cabinet of heads as long as\r\nshe lived.\r\n\r\nThen the Queen took her eldest son out upon a balcony that overlooked\r\nthe crowd of subjects gathered below, and said to them:\r\n\r\n\"Here is your future ruler, King Evardo Fifteenth. He is fifteen years\r\nof age, has fifteen silver buckles on his jacket and is the fifteenth\r\nEvardo to rule the land of Ev.\"\r\n\r\nThe people shouted their approval fifteen times, and even the Wheelers,\r\nsome of whom were present, loudly promised to obey the new King.\r\n\r\nSo the Queen placed a big crown of gold, set with rubies, upon Evardo's\r\nhead, and threw an ermine robe over his shoulders, and proclaimed him\r\nKing; and he bowed gratefully to all his subjects and then went away to\r\nsee if he could find any cake in the royal pantry.\r\n\r\nOzma of Oz and her people, as well as Dorothy, Tiktok and Billina, were\r\nsplendidly entertained by the Queen mother, who owed all her happiness\r\nto their kind offices; and that evening the yellow hen was publicly\r\npresented with a beautiful necklace of pearls and sapphires, as a token\r\nof esteem from the new King.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Emerald City\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nDorothy decided to accept Ozma's invitation to return with her to the\r\nLand of Oz. There was no greater chance of her getting home from Ev than\r\nfrom Oz, and the little girl was anxious to see once more the country\r\nwhere she had encountered such wonderful adventures. By this time Uncle\r\nHenry would have reached Australia in his ship, and had probably given\r\nher up for lost; so he couldn't worry any more than he did if she stayed\r\naway from him a while longer. So she would go to Oz.\r\n\r\nThey bade good-bye to the people of Ev, and the King promised Ozma that\r\nhe would ever be grateful to her and render the Land of Oz any service\r\nthat might lie within his power.\r\n\r\nAnd then they approached the edge of the dangerous desert, and Ozma\r\nthrew down the magic carpet, which at once unrolled far enough for all\r\nof them to walk upon it without being crowded.\r\n\r\nTiktok, claiming to be Dorothy's faithful follower because he belonged\r\nto her, had been permitted to join the party, and before they started\r\nthe girl wound up his machinery as far as possible, and the copper man\r\nstepped off as briskly as any one of them.\r\n\r\nOzma also invited Billina to visit the Land of Oz, and the yellow hen\r\nwas glad enough to go where new sights and scenes awaited her.\r\n\r\nThey began the trip across the desert early in the morning, and as they\r\nstopped only long enough for Billina to lay her daily egg, before sunset\r\nthey espied the green slopes and wooded hills of the beautiful Land of\r\nOz. They entered it in the Munchkin territory, and the King of the\r\nMunchkins met them at the border and welcomed Ozma with great respect,\r\nbeing very pleased by her safe return. For Ozma of Oz ruled the King of\r\nthe Munchkins, the King of the Winkies, the King of the Quadlings and\r\nthe King of the Gillikins just as those kings ruled their own people;\r\nand this supreme ruler of the Land of Oz lived in a great town of her\r\nown, called the Emerald City, which was in the exact center of the four\r\nkingdoms of the Land of Oz.\r\n\r\nThe Munchkin king entertained them at his palace that night, and in the\r\nmorning they set out for the Emerald City, travelling over a road of\r\nyellow brick that led straight to the jewel-studded gates. Everywhere\r\nthe people turned out to greet their beloved Ozma and to hail joyfully\r\nthe Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion, who were popular\r\nfavorites. Dorothy, too, remembered some of the people, who had\r\nbefriended her on the occasion of her first visit to Oz, and they were\r\nwell pleased to see the little Kansas girl again, and showered her with\r\ncompliments and good wishes.\r\n\r\nAt one place, where they stopped to refresh themselves, Ozma accepted a\r\nbowl of milk from the hands of a pretty dairy-maid. Then she looked at\r\nthe girl more closely, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's Jinjur--isn't it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your Highness,\" was the reply, as Jinjur dropped a low curtsy. And\r\nDorothy looked wonderingly at this lively appearing person, who had once\r\nassembled an army of women and driven the Scarecrow from the throne of\r\nthe Emerald City, and even fought a battle with the powerful army of\r\nGlinda the Sorceress.\r\n\r\n\"I've married a man who owns nine cows,\" said Jinjur to Ozma, \"and now I\r\nam happy and contented and willing to lead a quiet life and mind my own\r\nbusiness.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Where is your husband?\" asked Ozma.\r\n\r\n\"He is in the house, nursing a black eye,\" replied Jinjur, calmly. \"The\r\nfoolish man would insist upon milking the red cow when I wanted him to\r\nmilk the white one; but he will know better next time, I am sure.\"\r\n\r\nThen the party moved on again, and after crossing a broad river on a\r\nferry and passing many fine farm houses that were dome shaped and\r\npainted a pretty green color, they came in sight of a large building\r\nthat was covered with flags and bunting.\r\n\r\n\"I don't remember that building,\" said Dorothy. \"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the College of Art and Athletic Perfection,\" replied Ozma. \"I\r\nhad it built quite recently, and the Woggle-Bug is its president. It\r\nkeeps him busy, and the young men who attend the college are no worse\r\noff than they were before. You see, in this country are a number of\r\nyouths who do not like to work, and the college is an excellent place\r\nfor them.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now they came in sight of the Emerald City, and the people flocked\r\nout to greet their lovely ruler. There were several bands and many\r\nofficers and officials of the realm, and a crowd of citizens in their\r\nholiday attire.\r\n\r\nThus the beautiful Ozma was escorted by a brilliant procession to her\r\nroyal city, and so great was the cheering that she was obliged to\r\nconstantly bow to the right and left to acknowledge the greetings of her\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I PROMOTE YOU TO BE CAPTAIN-GENERAL\"]\r\n\r\nThat evening there was a grand reception in the royal palace, attended\r\nby the most important persons of Oz, and Jack Pumpkinhead, who was a\r\nlittle over-ripe but still active, read an address congratulating Ozma\r\nof Oz upon the success of her generous mission to rescue the royal\r\nfamily of a neighboring kingdom.\r\n\r\nThen magnificent gold medals set with precious stones were presented to\r\neach of the twenty-six officers; and the Tin Woodman was given a new axe\r\nstudded with diamonds; and the Scarecrow received a silver jar of\r\ncomplexion powder. Dorothy was presented with a pretty coronet and made\r\na Princess of Oz, and Tiktok received two bracelets set with eight rows\r\nof very clear and sparkling emeralds.\r\n\r\nAfterward they sat down to a splendid feast, and Ozma put Dorothy at her\r\nright and Billina at her left, where the hen sat upon a golden roost and\r\nate from a jeweled platter. Then were placed the Scarecrow, the Tin\r\nWoodman and Tiktok, with baskets of lovely flowers before them, because\r\nthey did not require food. The twenty-six officers were at the lower end\r\nof the table, and the Lion and the Tiger also had seats, and were served\r\non golden platters, that held a half a bushel at one time.\r\n\r\nThe wealthiest and most important citizens of the Emerald City were\r\nproud to wait upon these famous adventurers, and they were assisted by a\r\nsprightly little maid named Jellia Jamb, whom the Scarecrow pinched upon\r\nher rosy cheeks and seemed to know very well.\r\n\r\nDuring the feast Ozma grew thoughtful, and suddenly she asked:\r\n\r\n\"Where is the private?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he is sweeping out the barracks,\" replied one of the generals, who\r\nwas busy eating a leg of a turkey. \"But I have ordered him a dish of\r\nbread and molasses to eat when his work is done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let him be sent for,\" said the girl ruler.\r\n\r\nWhile they waited for this command to be obeyed, she enquired:\r\n\r\n\"Have we any other privates in the armies?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" replied the Tin Woodman, \"I believe there are three,\r\naltogether.\"\r\n\r\nThe private now entered, saluting his officers and the royal Ozma very\r\nrespectfully.\r\n\r\n\"What is your name, my man?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Omby Amby,\" answered the private.\r\n\r\n\"Then, Omby Amby,\" said she, \"I promote you to be Captain General of all\r\nthe armies of my kingdom, and especially to be Commander of my Body\r\nGuard at the royal palace.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very expensive to hold so many offices,\" said the private,\r\nhesitating. \"I have no money with which to buy uniforms.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall be supplied from the royal treasury,\" said Ozma.\r\n\r\nThen the private was given a seat at the table, where the other officers\r\nwelcomed him cordially, and the feasting and merriment were resumed.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Jellia Jamb exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing more to eat! The Hungry Tiger has consumed\r\neverything!\"\r\n\r\n\"But that is not the worst of it,\" declared the Tiger, mournfully.\r\n\"Somewhere or somehow, I've actually lost my appetite!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDorothy's Magic Belt\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nDorothy passed several very happy weeks in the Land of Oz as the guest\r\nof the royal Ozma, who delighted to please and interest the little\r\nKansas girl. Many new acquaintances were formed and many old ones\r\nrenewed, and wherever she went Dorothy found herself among friends.\r\n\r\nOne day, however, as she sat in Ozma's private room, she noticed hanging\r\nupon the wall a picture which constantly changed in appearance, at one\r\ntime showing a meadow and at another time a forest, a lake or a\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\n\"How curious!\" she exclaimed, after watching the shifting scenes for a\r\nfew moments.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Ozma, \"that is really a wonderful invention in magic. If I\r\nwish to see any part of the world or any person living, I need only\r\nexpress the wish and it is shown in the picture.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I use it?\" asked Dorothy, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, my dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'd like to see the old Kansas farm, and Aunt Em,\" said the girl.\r\n\r\nInstantly the well remembered farmhouse appeared in the picture, and\r\nAunt Em could be seen quite plainly. She was engaged in washing dishes\r\nby the kitchen window and seemed quite well and contented. The hired men\r\nand the teams were in the harvest fields behind the house, and the corn\r\nand wheat seemed to the child to be in prime condition. On the side\r\nporch Dorothy's pet dog, Toto, was lying fast asleep in the sun, and to\r\nher surprise old Speckles was running around with a brood of twelve new\r\nchickens trailing after her.\r\n\r\n\"Everything seems all right at home,\" said Dorothy, with a sigh of\r\nrelief. \"Now I wonder what Uncle Henry is doing.\"\r\n\r\nThe scene in the picture at once shifted to Australia, where, in a\r\npleasant room in Sydney, Uncle Henry was seated in an easy chair,\r\nsolemnly smoking his briar pipe. He looked sad and lonely, and his hair\r\nwas now quite white and his hands and face thin and wasted.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" cried Dorothy, in an anxious voice, \"I'm sure Uncle Henry isn't\r\ngetting any better, and it's because he is worried about me. Ozma, dear,\r\nI must go to him at once!\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you?\" asked Ozma.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" replied Dorothy; \"but let us go to Glinda the Good. I'm\r\nsure she will help me, and advise me how to get to Uncle Henry.\"\r\n\r\nOzma readily agreed to this plan and caused the Sawhorse to be harnessed\r\nto a pretty green and pink phaeton, and the two girls rode away to visit\r\nthe famous sorceress.\r\n\r\nGlinda received them graciously, and listened to Dorothy's story with\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\"I have the magic belt, you know,\" said the little girl. \"If I buckled\r\nit around my waist and commanded it to take me to Uncle Henry, wouldn't\r\nit do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so,\" replied Glinda, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"And then,\" continued Dorothy, \"if I ever wanted to come back here\r\nagain, the belt would bring me.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THAT IS A WISE PLAN,\" REPLIED GLINDA]\r\n\r\n\"In that you are wrong,\" said the sorceress. \"The belt has magical\r\npowers only while it is in some fairy country, such as the Land of Oz,\r\nor the Land of Ev. Indeed, my little friend, were you to wear it and\r\nwish yourself in Australia, with your uncle, the wish would doubtless be\r\nfulfilled, because it was made in fairyland. But you would not find the\r\nmagic belt around you when you arrived at your destination.\"\r\n\r\n\"What would become of it?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"It would be lost, as were your silver shoes when you visited Oz before,\r\nand no one would ever see it again. It seems too bad to destroy the use\r\nof the magic belt in that way, doesn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Dorothy, after a moment's thought, \"I will give the magic\r\nbelt to Ozma, for she can use it in her own country. And she can wish me\r\ntransported to Uncle Henry without losing the belt.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a wise plan,\" replied Glinda.\r\n\r\nSo they rode back to the Emerald City, and on the way it was arranged\r\nthat every Saturday morning Ozma would look at Dorothy in her magic\r\npicture, wherever the little girl might chance to be. And, if she saw\r\nDorothy make a certain signal, then Ozma would know that the little\r\nKansas girl wanted to revisit the Land of Oz, and by means of the Nome\r\nKing's magic belt would wish that she might instantly return.\r\n\r\nThis having been agreed upon, Dorothy bade good-bye to all her friends.\r\nTiktok wanted to go to Australia, too; but Dorothy knew that the machine\r\nman would never do for a servant in a civilized country, and the chances\r\nwere that his machinery wouldn't work at all. So she left him in Ozma's\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nBillina, on the contrary, preferred the Land of Oz to any other country,\r\nand refused to accompany Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"The bugs and ants that I find here are the finest flavored in the\r\nworld,\" declared the yellow hen, \"and there are plenty of them. So here\r\nI shall end my days; and I must say, Dorothy, my dear, that you are very\r\nfoolish to go back into that stupid, humdrum world again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Henry needs me,\" said Dorothy, simply; and every one except\r\nBillina thought it was right that she should go.\r\n\r\nAll Dorothy's friends of the Land of Oz--both old and new--gathered in a\r\ngroup in front of the palace to bid her a sorrowful good-bye and to wish\r\nher long life and happiness. After much hand shaking, Dorothy kissed\r\nOzma once more, and then handed her the Nome King's magic belt, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Now, dear Princess, when I wave my handkerchief, please wish me with\r\nUncle Henry. I'm aw'fly sorry to leave you--and the Scarecrow--and the\r\nTin Woodman--and the Cowardly Lion--and Tiktok--and--and everybody--but\r\nI do want my Uncle Henry! So good-bye, all of you.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThen the little girl stood on one of the big emeralds which decorated\r\nthe courtyard, and after looking once again at each of her friends,\r\nwaved her handkerchief.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Dorothy, \"I wasn't drowned at all. And I've come to nurse you\r\nand take care of you, Uncle Henry, and you must promise to get well as\r\nsoon as poss'ble.\"\r\n\r\nUncle Henry smiled and cuddled his little niece close in his lap.\r\n\r\n\"I'm better already, my darling,\" said he.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nBooks by L.
