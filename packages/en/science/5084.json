Whether or not, as some affirm, the American\r\npublic \"discovered\" Mr. Herbert Spencer, they responded at once to the\r\ninfluence of the younger evolutionary writer, whose wide and exact\r\nknowledge of nature was but a stepping-stone to his interest in human\r\nlife and its problems. And when, a few years later, after more than one\r\ninvitation, he came to lecture in the United States and made himself\r\npersonally known to his many readers, it was this widespread response to\r\nhis influence which made his welcome comparable, as was said at the\r\ntime, to a royal progress.\r\n\r\nHis own interest in the present problems of the country and the\r\npossibilities of its future was always keen, not merely as touching the\r\ndevelopment of a vast political force--one of the dominant factors of\r\nthe near future--but far more as touching the character of its\r\napproaching greatness. Huge territories and vast resources were of small\r\ninterest to him in comparison with the use to which they should be put.\r\nNone felt more vividly than he that the true greatness of a nation would\r\ndepend upon the spirit of the principles it adopted, upon the character\r\nof the individuals who make up the nation and shape the channels in\r\nwhich the currents of its being will hereafter flow.\r\n\r\nThis was the note he struck in the appeal for intellectual sincerity and\r\nclearness which he made at the end of his New York \"Lectures on\r\nEvolution.\" The same note dominates that letter to his sister--a\r\nSoutherner by adoption--which gives his reading of the real issue at\r\nstake in the great civil war. Slavery is bad for the slave, but far\r\nworse for the master, as sapping his character and making impossible\r\nthat moral vigour of the individual on which is based the collective\r\nvigour of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe interest with which he followed the later development of social\r\nproblems need not be dwelt on here, except to say that he watched their\r\nearlier maturity in America as an indication of the problems which would\r\nafterwards call for a solution in his own country. His share in treating\r\nthem was limited to examining the principles of social philosophy on\r\nwhich some of the proposed remedies for social troubles were based, and\r\nthis examination may be found in his \"Collected Essays.\" But the\r\neducational campaign which he carried on in England had its counterpart\r\nin America. It was not only that he was chosen to open the Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity as the type of a new form of education; there and elsewhere\r\npupils of his carried out in America his methods of teaching biology,\r\nwhile others engaged in general education would write testifying to the\r\ninfluence of his ideas upon their own methods of teaching. But it must\r\nbe remembered that nothing was further from his mind than the desire to\r\nfound a school of thought. He only endeavoured as a scholar and a\r\nstudent to clear up his own thoughts and help others to clear theirs,\r\nwhether in the intellectual or the moral world. This was the help he\r\nsteadfastly hoped to give the people, that interacting union of\r\nintellectual freedom and moral discernment which may be furthered by\r\ngood education and training, by precept and example, that basis of all\r\nsocial health and prosperity. And if, as he said, he would like to be\r\nremembered as one who had done his best to help the people, he meant\r\nassuredly not the people only of his native land, but the wider world to\r\nwhom his words could be carried.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE ENGLISH EDITION.\r\n\r\nMy father's life was one of so many interests, and his work was at all\r\ntimes so diversified, that to follow each thread separately, as if he\r\nhad been engaged on that alone for a time, would be to give a false\r\nimpression of his activity and the peculiar character of his labours.\r\nAll through his active career he was equally busy with research into\r\nnature, with studies in philosophy, with teaching and administrative\r\nwork. The real measure of his energy can only be found when all these\r\nare considered together. Without this there can be no conception of the\r\nlimitations imposed upon him in his chosen life's work. The mere amount\r\nof his research is greatly magnified by the smallness of the time\r\nallowed for it.\r\n\r\nBut great as was the impression left by these researches in purely\r\nscientific circles, it is not by them alone that he made his impression\r\nupon the mass of his contemporaries. They were chiefly moved by\r\nsomething over and above his wide knowledge in so many fields--by his\r\npassionate sincerity, his interest not only in pure knowledge, but in\r\nhuman life, by his belief that the interpretation of the book of nature\r\nwas not to be kept apart from the ultimate problems of existence; by the\r\nlove of truth, in short, both theoretical and practical, which gave the\r\nkey to the character of the man himself.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I have not discussed with any fulness the value of his\r\ntechnical contributions to natural science; I have not drawn up a\r\ncompendium of his philosophical views. One is a work for specialists;\r\nthe other can be gathered from his published works. I have endeavoured\r\nrather to give the public a picture, so far as I can, of the man\r\nhimself, of his aims in the many struggles in which he was engaged, of\r\nhis character and temperament, and the circumstances under which his\r\nvarious works were begun and completed.\r\n\r\nSo far as possible, I have made his letters, or extracts from them, tell\r\nthe story of his life. If those of any given period are diverse in tone\r\nand character, it is simply because they reflect an equal diversity of\r\noccupations and interests. Few of the letters, however, are of any great\r\nlength; many are little more than hurried notes; others, mainly of\r\nprivate interest, supply a sentence here and there to fill in the\r\ngeneral outline.\r\n\r\nMoreover, whenever circumstances permit, I have endeavoured to make my\r\nown part in the book entirely impersonal. My experience is that the\r\nconstant iteration by the biographer of his relationship to the subject\r\nof his memoir, can become exasperating to the reader; so that at the\r\nrisk of offending in the opposite direction, I have chosen the other\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nLastly, I have to express my grateful thanks to all who have sent me\r\nletters or supplied information, and especially to Dr. J.H. Gladstone,\r\nSir Mountstuart Grant Duff, Professor Howes, Professor Henry Sidgwick,\r\nand Sir Spencer Walpole, for their contributions to the book; but above\r\nall to Sir Joseph Hooker and Sir Michael Foster, whose invaluable help\r\nin reading proofs and making suggestions has been, as it were, a final\r\nlabour of love for the memory of their old friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE AMERICAN EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE ENGLISH EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.1. 1825-1842.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.2. 1841-1846.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.3. 1846-1849.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.4. 1848-1850.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.5. 1850-1851.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.6. 1851-1854.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.7. 1851-1853.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.8. 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.9. 1855.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.10. 1855-1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.11. 1857-1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.12. 1859-1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.13. 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.14. 1859-1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.15. 1860-1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.16. 1860-1861.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.17. 1861-1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.18. 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.19. 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.20. 1866.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.21. 1867.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.22. 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.23. 1869.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\nPLATE 1.

Here stood a large\r\nsemi-public school, which had risen to the front rank in numbers and\r\nreputation under Dr. Nicholas, of Wadham College, Oxford, who in 1791\r\nbecame the son-in-law and successor of the previous master.\r\n\r\nThe senior assistant-master in this school was George Huxley, a tall,\r\ndark, rather full-faced man, quick tempered, and distinguished, in his\r\nson's words, by \"that glorious firmness which one's enemies called\r\nobstinacy.\" In the year 1810 he had married Rachel Withers; she bore\r\nfive sons and three daughters, of whom one son and one daughter died in\r\ninfancy; the seventh and youngest surviving child was Thomas Henry.\r\n\r\nGeorge Huxley, the master at Ealing, was the second son of Thomas Huxley\r\nand Margaret James, who were married at St. Michael's, Coventry, on\r\nSeptember 8, 1773. This Thomas Huxley continued to live at Coventry\r\nuntil his death in January 1796, when he left behind him a large family\r\nand no very great wealth. The most notable item in the latter is the\r\n\"capital Messuage, by me lately purchased of Mrs. Ann Thomas,\" which he\r\ndirects to be sold to pay his debts--an inn, apparently, for the\r\ntestator is described as a victualler. Family tradition tells that he\r\ncame to Coventry from Lichfield, and if so, he and his sons after him\r\nexemplify the tendency to move south, which is to be observed in those\r\nof the same name who migrated from their original home in Cheshire. This\r\nhome is represented to-day by a farm in the Wirral, about eight miles\r\nfrom Chester, called Huxley Hall. From this centre Huxleys spread to the\r\nneighbouring villages, such as Overton and Eccleston, Clotton and\r\nDuddon, Tattenhall and Wettenhall; others to Chester and Brindley near\r\nNantwich. The southward movement carries some to the Welsh border,\r\nothers into Shropshire. The Wettenhall family established themselves in\r\nthe fourth generation at Rushall, and held property in Handsworth and\r\nWalsall; the Brindley family sent a branch to Macclesfield, whose\r\nrepresentative, Samuel, must have been on the town council when the\r\nYoung Pretender rode through on his way to Derby, for he was mayor in\r\n1746; while at the end of the sixteenth century, George, the\r\ndisinherited heir of Brindley, became a merchant in London, and\r\npurchased Wyre Hall at Edmonton, where his descendants lived for four\r\ngenerations, his grandson being knighted by Charles II in 1663.\r\n\r\nBut my father had no particular interest in tracing his early ancestry.\r\n\"My own genealogical inquiries,\" he said, \"have taken me so far back\r\nthat I confess the later stages do not interest me.\" Towards the end of\r\nhis life, however, my mother persuaded him to see what could be found\r\nout about Huxley Hall and the origin of the name. This proved to be from\r\nthe manor of Huxley or Hodesleia, whereof one Swanus de Hockenhull was\r\nenfeoffed by the abbot and convent of St. Werburgh in the time of\r\nRichard I. Of the grandsons of this Swanus, the eldest kept the manor\r\nand name of Hockenhull (which is still extant in the Midlands); the\r\nyounger ones took their name from the other fief.\r\n\r\nBut the historian of Cheshire records the fact that owing to the\r\nrespectability of the name, it was unlawfully assumed by divers \"losels\r\nand lewd fellows of the baser sort,\" and my father, with a fine show of\r\nearnestness, used to declare that he was certain the legitimate owners\r\nof the name were far too sober and respectable to have produced such a\r\nreprobate as himself, and one of these \"losels\" must be his progenitor.\r\n\r\nThomas Henry Huxley was born at Ealing on May 4, 1825, \"about eight\r\no'clock in the morning.\" (So in the Autobiography, but 9.30 according to\r\nthe Family Bible.) \"I am not aware,\" he tells us playfully in his\r\nAutobiography, \"that any portents preceded my arrival in this world,\r\nbut, in my childhood, I remember hearing a traditional account of the\r\nmanner in which I lost the chance of an endowment of great practical\r\nvalue. The windows of my mother's room were open, in consequence of the\r\nunusual warmth of the weather. For the same reason, probably, a\r\nneighbouring beehive had swarmed, and the new colony, pitching on the\r\nwindow-sill, was making its way into the room when the horrified nurse\r\nshut down the sash. If that well-meaning woman had only abstained from\r\nher ill-timed interference, the swarm might have settled on my lips, and\r\nI should have been endowed with that mellifluous eloquence which, in\r\nthis country, leads far more surely than worth, capacity, or honest\r\nwork, to the highest places in Church and State. But the opportunity was\r\nlost, and I have been obliged to content myself through life with saying\r\nwhat I mean in the plainest of plain language, than which, I suppose,\r\nthere is no habit more ruinous to a man's prospects of advancement.\"\r\n\r\nAs to his debt, physical and mental, to either parent, he writes as\r\nfollows:--]\r\n\r\nPhysically I am the son of my mother so completely--even down to\r\npeculiar movements of the hands, which made their appearance in me as I\r\nreached the age she had when I noticed them--that I can hardly find any\r\ntrace of my father in myself, except an inborn faculty for drawing,\r\nwhich, unfortunately, in my case, has never been cultivated, a hot\r\ntemper, and that amount of tenacity of purpose which unfriendly\r\nobservers sometimes call obstinacy.\r\n\r\nMy mother was a slender brunette, of an emotional and energetic\r\ntemperament, and possessed of the most piercing black eyes I ever saw in\r\na woman's head. With no more education than other women of the middle\r\nclasses of her day, she had an excellent mental capacity. Her most\r\ndistinguishing characteristic, however, was rapidity of thought. If one\r\nventured to suggest that she had not taken much time to arrive at any\r\nconclusion, she would say, \"I cannot help it; things flash across me.\"\r\nThat peculiarity has been passed on to me in full strength; it has often\r\nstood me in good stead; it has sometimes played me sad tricks, and it\r\nhas always been a danger. But, after all, if my time were to come over\r\nagain, there is nothing I would less willingly part with than my\r\ninheritance of mother-wit.\r\n\r\n[Restless, talkative, untiring to the day of her death, she was at\r\nsixty-six \"as active and energetic as a young woman.\" His early devotion\r\nto her was remarkable. Describing her to his future wife he writes:--]\r\n\r\nAs a child my love for her was a passion. I have lain awake for hours\r\ncrying because I had a morbid fear of her death; her approbation was my\r\ngreatest reward, her displeasure my greatest punishment.\r\n\r\nI have next to nothing to say about my childhood (he continues in the\r\nAutobiography). In later years my mother, looking at me almost\r\nreproachfully, would sometimes say, \"Ah! you were such a pretty boy!\"\r\nwhence I had no difficulty in concluding that I had not fulfilled my\r\nearly promise in the matter of looks. In fact, I have a distinct\r\nrecollection of certain curls of which I was vain, and of a conviction\r\nthat I closely resembled that handsome, courtly gentleman, Sir Herbert\r\nOakley, who was vicar of our parish, and who was as a god to us country\r\nfolk, because he was occasionally visited by the then Prince George of\r\nCambridge. I remember turning my pinafore wrong side forwards in order\r\nto represent a surplice, and preaching to my mother's maids in the\r\nkitchen as nearly as possible in Sir Herbert's manner one Sunday morning\r\nwhen the rest of the family were at church. That is the earliest\r\nindication of the strong clerical affinities which my friend Mr. Herbert\r\nSpencer has always ascribed to me, though I fancy they have for the most\r\npart remained in a latent state.\r\n\r\n[There remains no record of his having been a very precocious child.\r\nIndeed, it is usually the eldest child whose necessary companionship\r\nwith his elders wins him this reputation. The youngest remains a child\r\namong children longer than any other of his brothers and sisters.\r\n\r\nOne talent, however, displayed itself early. The faculty of drawing he\r\ninherited from his father. But on the queer principle that training is\r\neither unnecessary to natural capacity or even ruins it, he never\r\nreceived regular instruction in drawing; and his draughtsmanship,\r\nvigorous as it was, and a genuine medium of artistic expression as well\r\nas an admirable instrument in his own especial work, never reached the\r\ntechnical perfection of which it was naturally capable.\r\n\r\nThe amount of instruction, indeed of any kind, which he received was\r\nscanty in the extreme. For a couple of years, from the age of eight to\r\nten, he was given a taste of the unreformed public school life, where,\r\napart from the rough and ready mode of instruction in vogue and the\r\nnecessary obedience enforced to certain rules, no means were taken to\r\nreach the boys themselves, to guide them and help them in their school\r\nlife. The new-comer was left to struggle for himself in a community\r\ncomposed of human beings at their most heartlessly cruel age, untempered\r\nby any external influence.\r\n\r\nHere he had little enough of mental discipline, or that deliberate\r\ntraining of character which is a leading object of modern education. On\r\nthe contrary, what he learnt was a knowledge of undisciplined human\r\nnature.]\r\n\r\nMy regular school training [he tells us], was of the briefest, perhaps\r\nfortunately; for though my way of life has made me acquainted with all\r\nsorts and conditions of men, from the highest to the lowest, I\r\ndeliberately affirm that the society I fell into at school was the worst\r\nI have ever known. We boys were average lads, with much the same\r\ninherent capacity for good and evil as any others; but the people who\r\nwere set over us cared about as much for our intellectual and moral\r\nwelfare as if they were baby-farmers. We were left to the operation of\r\nthe struggle for existence among ourselves; bullying was the least of\r\nthe ill practices current among us. Almost the only cheerful\r\nreminiscence in connection with the place which arises in my mind is\r\nthat of a battle I had with one of my classmates, who had bullied me\r\nuntil I could stand it no longer. I was a very slight lad, but there was\r\na wild-cat element in me which, when roused, made up for lack of weight,\r\nand I licked my adversary effectually. However, one of my first\r\nexperiences of the extremely rough-and-ready nature of justice, as\r\nexhibited by the course of things in general, arose out of the fact that\r\nI--the victor--had a black eye, while he--the vanquished--had none, so\r\nthat I got into disgrace and he did not. We made it up, and thereafter I\r\nwas unmolested. One of the greatest shocks I ever received in my life\r\nwas to be told a dozen years afterwards by the groom who brought me my\r\nhorse in a stable-yard in Sydney that he was my quondam antagonist. He\r\nhad a long story of family misfortune to account for his position; but\r\nat that time it was necessary to deal very cautiously with mysterious\r\nstrangers in New South Wales, and on inquiry I found that the\r\nunfortunate young man had not only been \"sent out,\" but had undergone\r\nmore than one colonial conviction.\r\n\r\n[His brief school career was happily cut short by the break up of the\r\nEaling establishment. On the death of Dr. Nicholas, his sons attempted\r\nto carry on the school; but the numbers declined rapidly, and George\r\nHuxley, about 1835, returned to his native town of Coventry, where he\r\nobtained the modest post of manager of the Coventry savings bank, while\r\nhis daughters eked out the slender family resources by keeping school.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the boy Tom, as he was usually called, got little or no\r\nregular instruction. But he had an inquiring mind, and a singularly\r\nearly turn for metaphysical speculation. He read everything he could lay\r\nhands on in his father's library. Not satisfied with the ordinary length\r\nof the day, he used, when a boy of twelve, to light his candle before\r\ndawn, pin a blanket round his shoulders, and sit up in bed to read\r\nHutton's \"Geology.\" He discussed all manner of questions with his\r\nparents and friends, for his quick and eager mind made it possible for\r\nhim to have friendships with people considerably older than himself.\r\nAmong these may especially be noted his medical brother-in-law, Dr.\r\nCooke of Coventry, who had married his sister Ellen in 1839, and through\r\nwhom he early became interested in human anatomy; and George Anderson\r\nMay, at that time in business at Hinckley (a small weaving centre some\r\ndozen miles distant from Coventry), whom his friends who knew him\r\nafterwards in the home which he made for himself on the farm at Elford,\r\nnear Tamworth, will remember for his genial spirit and native love of\r\nletters. There was a real friendship between the two. The boy of fifteen\r\nnotes down with pleasure his visits to the man of six-and-twenty, with\r\nwhom he could talk freely of the books he read, and the ideas he\r\ngathered about philosophy.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, however, their ways lay far apart, and I believe they did\r\nnot meet again until the seventies, when Mr. May sent his children to be\r\neducated in London, and his youngest son was at school with me; his\r\nyounger daughter studied art at the Slade school with my sisters, and\r\nboth found a warm welcome in the home circle at Marlborough Place.\r\n\r\nOne of his boyish speculations was as to what would become of things if\r\ntheir qualities were taken away; and lighting upon Sir William\r\nHamilton's \"Logic,\" he devoured it to such good effect that when, years\r\nafterwards, he came to tackle the greater philosophers, especially the\r\nEnglish and the German, he found he had already a clear notion of where\r\nthe key of metaphysic lay.\r\n\r\nThis early interest in metaphysics was another form of the intense\r\ncuriosity to discover the motive principle of things, the why and how\r\nthey act, that appeared in the boy's love of engineering and of anatomy.\r\nThe unity of this motive and the accident which bade fair to ruin his\r\nlife at the outset, and actually levied a lifelong tax upon his bodily\r\nvigour, are best told in his own words:--]\r\n\r\nAs I grew older, my great desire was to be a mechanical engineer, but\r\nthe fates were against this, and while very young I commenced the study\r\nof medicine under a medical brother-in-law. But, though the Institute of\r\nMechanical Engineers would certainly not own me, I am not sure that I\r\nhave not all along been a sort of mechanical engineer in partibus\r\ninfidelium. I am now occasionally horrified to think how little I ever\r\nknew or cared about medicine as the art of healing. The only part of my\r\nprofessional course which really and deeply interested me was\r\nphysiology, which is the mechanical engineering of living machines; and,\r\nnotwithstanding that natural science has been my proper business, I am\r\nafraid there is very little of the genuine naturalist in me. I never\r\ncollected anything, and species work was always a burden to me; what I\r\ncared for was the architectural and engineering part of the business,\r\nthe working out the wonderful unity of plan in the thousands and\r\nthousands of diverse living constructions, and the modifications of\r\nsimilar apparatuses to serve diverse ends. The extraordinary attraction\r\nI felt towards the study of the intricacies of living structure nearly\r\nproved fatal to me at the outset. I was a mere boy--I think between\r\nthirteen and fourteen years of age--when I was taken by some older\r\nstudent friends of mine to the first post-mortem examination I ever\r\nattended. All my life I have been most unfortunately sensitive to the\r\ndisagreeables which attend anatomical pursuits, but on this occasion my\r\ncuriosity overpowered all other feelings, and I spent two or three hours\r\nin gratifying it. I did not cut myself, and none of the ordinary\r\nsymptoms of dissection-poison supervened, but poisoned I was somehow,\r\nand I remember sinking into a strange state of apathy. By way of a last\r\nchance, I was sent to the care of some good, kind people, friends of my\r\nfather's, who lived in a farmhouse in the heart of Warwickshire. I\r\nremember staggering from my bed to the window on the bright spring\r\nmorning after my arrival, and throwing open the casement. Life seemed to\r\ncome back on the wings of the breeze, and to this day the faint odour of\r\nwood-smoke, like that which floated across the farmyard in the early\r\nmorning, is as good to me as the \"sweet south upon a bed of violets.\" I\r\nsoon recovered, but for years I suffered from occasional paroxysms of\r\ninternal pain, and from that time my constant friend, hypochondriacal\r\ndyspepsia, commenced his half-century of co-tenancy of my fleshly\r\ntabernacle.\r\n\r\n[Some little time after his return from the voyage of the \"Rattlesnake,\"\r\nHuxley succeeded in tracing his good Warwickshire friends again. A\r\nletter of May 11, 1852, from one of them, Miss K. Jaggard, tells how\r\nthey had lost sight of the Huxleys after their departure from Coventry;\r\nhow they were themselves dispersed by death, marriage, or retirement;\r\nand then proceeds to draw a lively sketch of the long delicate-looking\r\nlad, which clearly refers to this period or a little later.]\r\n\r\nMy brother and sister who were living at Grove Fields when you visited\r\nthere, have now retired from the cares of business, and are living very\r\ncomfortably at Leamington...I suppose you remember Mr. Joseph Russell,\r\nwho used to live at Avon Dassett. He is now married and gone to live at\r\nGrove Fields, so that it is still occupied by a person of the same name\r\nas when you knew it. But it is very much altered in appearance since the\r\ntime when such merry and joyous parties of aunts and cousins used to\r\nassemble there. I assure you we have often talked of \"Tom Huxley\" (who\r\nwas sometimes one of the party) looking so thin and ill, and pretending\r\nto make hay with one hand, while in the other he held a German book! Do\r\nyou remember it? And the picnic at Scar Bank? And how often too your\r\npatience was put to the test in looking for your German books which had\r\nbeen hidden by some of those playful companions who were rather less\r\ninclined for learning than yourself?\r\n\r\n[It is interesting to see from this letter and from a journal, to be\r\nquoted hereafter, that he had thus early begun to teach himself German,\r\nan undertaking more momentous in its consequences than the boy dreamed\r\nof. The knowledge of German thus early acquired was soon of the utmost\r\nservice in making him acquainted with the advance of biological\r\ninvestigation on the continent at a time when few indeed among English\r\nmen of science were able to follow it at first hand, and turn the light\r\nof the newest theories upon their own researches.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore peculiarly interesting to note the cause which\r\ndetermined the young Huxley to take up the study of so little read a\r\nlanguage. I have more than once heard him say that this was one half of\r\nthe debt he owed to Carlyle, the other half being an intense hatred of\r\nshams of every sort and kind. The translations from the German, the\r\nconstant references to German literature and philosophy, fired him to\r\ntry the vast original from which these specimens were quarried, for the\r\nsake partly of the literature, but still more of the philosophy. The\r\ntranslation of \"Wilhelm Meister,\" and some of the \"Miscellaneous Essays\"\r\ntogether, with \"The French Revolution,\" were certainly among works of\r\nCarlyle with which he first made acquaintance, to be followed later by\r\n\"Sartor Resartus,\" which for many years afterwards was his Enchiridion,\r\nas he puts it in an unpublished autobiographical fragment.\r\n\r\nBy great good fortune, a singularly interesting glimpse of my father's\r\nlife from the age of fifteen onwards has been preserved in the shape of\r\na fragmentary journal which he entitled, German fashion, \"Thoughts and\r\nDoings.\" Begun on September 29, 1840, it is continued for a couple of\r\nyears, and concludes with some vigorous annotations in 1845, when the\r\nlittle booklet emerged from a three years' oblivion at the bottom of an\r\nold desk. Early as this journal is, in it the boy displays three habits\r\nafterwards characteristic of the man: the habit of noting down any\r\nstriking thought or saying he came across in the course of his reading;\r\nof speculating on the causes of things and discussing the right and\r\nwrong of existing institutions; and of making scientific experiments,\r\nusing them to correct his theories.\r\n\r\nThe first entry, the heading, as it were, and keynote of all the rest,\r\nis a quotation from Novalis;--\"Philosophy can bake no bread; but it can\r\nprove for us God, freedom, and immortality. Which, now, is more\r\npractical, Philosophy or Economy?\" The reference here given is to a\r\nGerman edition of Novalis, so that it seems highly probable that the boy\r\nhad learnt enough of the language to translate a bit for himself,\r\nthough, as appears from entries in 1841, he had still to master the\r\ngrammar completely.\r\n\r\nIn science, he was much interested in electricity; he makes a galvanic\r\nbattery] \"in view of experiment to get crystallized carbon. Got it\r\ndeposited, but not crystallized.\" [Other experiments and theorising upon\r\nthem are recorded in the following year. Another entry showing the\r\ncourage of youth, deserves mention:--]\r\n\r\nOctober 5 (1840).--Began speculating on the cause of colours at sunset.\r\nHas any explanation of them ever been attempted? [which is supplemented\r\nby an extract] from old book.\r\n\r\n[We may also remark the early note of Radicalism and resistance to\r\nanything savouring of injustice or oppression, together with the naive\r\nhonesty of the admission that his opinions may change with years.]\r\n\r\nOctober 25 (at Hinckley).--Read Dr. S. Smith on the Divine\r\nGovernment.--Agree with him partly.--I should say that a general belief\r\nin his doctrines would have a very injurious effect on morals.\r\n\r\nNovember 22.--...Had a long talk with my mother and father about the\r\nright to make Dissenters pay church rates--and whether there ought to be\r\nany Establishment. I maintain that there ought not in both cases--I\r\nwonder what will be my opinion ten years hence? I think now that it is\r\nagainst all laws of justice to force men to support a church with whose\r\nopinions they cannot conscientiously agree. The argument that the rate\r\nis so small is very fallacious. It is as much a sacrifice of principle\r\nto do a little wrong as to do a great one.\r\n\r\nNovember 22 (Hinckley).--Had a long argument with Mr. May on the nature\r\nof the soul and the difference between it and matter. I maintained that\r\nit could not be proved that matter is ESSENTIALLY--as to its\r\nbase--different from soul. Mr. M. wittily said, soul was the\r\nperspiration of matter.\r\n\r\nWe cannot find the absolute basis of matter: we only know it by its\r\nproperties; neither know we the soul in any other way. Cogito ergo sum\r\nis the only thing that we CERTAINLY know.\r\n\r\nWhy may not soul and matter be of the same substance (i.e. basis whereon\r\nto fix qualities, for we cannot suppose a quality to exist per se--it\r\nmust have a something to qualify), but with different qualities.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose then an Eon--a something with no quality but that of\r\nexistence--this Eon endued with all the intelligence, mental qualities,\r\nand that in the highest degree--is God. This combination of intelligence\r\nwith existence we may suppose to have existed from eternity. At the\r\ncreation we may suppose that a portion of the Eon was separated from the\r\nintelligence, and it was ordained--it became a natural law--that it\r\nshould have the properties of gravitation, etc.--that is, that it should\r\ngive to man the ideas of those properties. The Eon in this state is\r\nmatter in the abstract. Matter, then, is Eon in the simplest form in\r\nwhich it possesses qualities appreciable by the senses. Out of this\r\nmatter, by the superimposition of fresh qualities, was made all things\r\nthat are.\r\n\r\n1841.\r\n\r\nJanuary 7.--Came to Rotherhithe.

Objective--that for which a man is indebted to the external world;\r\nand\r\n\r\n2. Subjective--that which he has acquired or may acquire by inward\r\ncontemplation.\r\n\r\nSubjective.\r\n/\r\nMetaphysics.\r\n/\r\nMetaphysics proper, Mathematics, Logic, Theology, Morality.\r\n\r\nObjective.\r\n/\r\nMorality, History, Physiology, Physics.\r\n\r\nMetaphysics comes immediately, of course, under the first (2) head--that\r\nis to say, the relations of the mind to itself; of this Mathematics and\r\nLogic, together with Theology, are branches.\r\n\r\nI am in doubt under which head to put morality, for I cannot determine\r\nexactly in my own mind whether morality can exist independent of others,\r\nwhether the idea of morality could ever have arisen in the mind of an\r\nisolated being or not. I am rather inclined to the opinion that it is\r\nobjective.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of objective knowledge comes first Physics, including the\r\nwhole body of the relations of inanimate unorganised bodies; secondly,\r\nPhysiology. Including the structure and functions of animal bodies,\r\nincluding language and Psychology; thirdly comes History.\r\n\r\nOne object for which I have attempted to form an arrangement of\r\nknowledge is that I may test the amount of my own acquirements. I shall\r\nform an extensive list of subjects on this plan, and as I acquire any\r\none of them I shall strike it out of the list. May the list soon get\r\nblack! though at present I shall hardly be able, I am afraid, to spot\r\nthe paper.\r\n\r\n(A prophecy! a prophecy, 1845!).\r\n\r\n[April 1842 introduces a number of quotations from Carlyle's\r\nMiscellaneous Writings, \"Characteristics,\" some clear and crisp, others\r\nsinking into Carlyle's own vein of speculative mysticism, e.g.]\r\n\r\n\"In the mind as in the body the sign of health is unconsciousness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of our thinking it is but the upper surface that we shape into\r\narticulate thought; underneath the region of argument and conscious\r\ndiscourse lies the region of meditation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Genius is ever a secret to itself.\"\r\n\r\n\"The healthy understanding, we should say, is neither the argumentative\r\nnor the Logical, but the Intuitive, for the end of understanding is not\r\nto prove and find reasons but to know and believe\" (!)\r\n\r\n\"The ages of heroism are not ages of Moral Philosophy.

In 1839 both his sisters married, and both\r\nmarried doctors. Dr. Cooke, the husband of the elder sister, who was\r\nsettled in Coventry, had begun to give him some instruction in the\r\nprinciples of medicine as early as the preceding June. It was now\r\narranged that he should go as assistant to Mr. Chandler, of Rotherhithe,\r\na practical preliminary to walking the hospitals and obtaining a medical\r\ndegree in London. His experiences among the poor in the dock region of\r\nthe East of London--for Dr. Chandler had charge of the parish--supplied\r\nhim with a grim commentary on his diligent reading in Carlyle. Looking\r\nback on this period, he writes:--]\r\n\r\nThe last recorded speech of Professor Teufelsdrockh proposes the toast\r\n'Die Sache der Armen in Gottes und Teufelsnamen' (The cause of the Poor\r\nin Heaven's name and --'s.) The cause of the Poor is the burden of \"Past\r\nand Present,\" \"Chartism,\" and \"Latter-Day Pamphlets.\" To me...this\r\nadvocacy of the cause of the poor appealed very strongly...because...I\r\nhad had the opportunity of seeing for myself something of the way the\r\npoor live. Not much, indeed, but still enough to give a terrible\r\nfoundation of real knowledge to my speculations.\r\n\r\n[After telling how he came to know something of the East End, he\r\nproceeds:--]\r\n\r\nI saw strange things there--among the rest, people who came to me for\r\nmedical aid, and who were really suffering from nothing but slow\r\nstarvation. I have not forgotten--am not likely to forget so long as\r\nmemory holds--a visit to a sick girl in a wretched garret where two or\r\nthree other women, one a deformed woman, sister of my patient, were busy\r\nshirt-making. After due examination, even my small medical knowledge\r\nsufficed to show that my patient was merely in want of some better food\r\nthan the bread and bad tea on which these people were living. I said so\r\nas gently as I could, and the sister turned upon me with a kind of\r\nchoking passion. Pulling out of her pocket a few pence and halfpence,\r\nand holding them out, \"That is all I get for six and thirty hours' work,\r\nand you talk about giving her proper food.\"\r\n\r\nWell, I left that to pursue my medical studies, and it so happened the\r\nshortest way between the school which I attended and the library of the\r\nCollege of Surgeons, where my spare hours were largely spent, lay\r\nthrough certain courts and alleys, Vinegar Yard and others, which are\r\nnow nothing like what they were then. Nobody would have found robbing me\r\na profitable employment in those days, and I used to walk through these\r\nwretched dens without let or hindrance. Alleys nine or ten feet wide, I\r\nsuppose, with tall houses full of squalid drunken men and women, and the\r\npavement strewed with still more squalid children. The place of air was\r\ntaken by a steam of filthy exhalations; and the only relief to the\r\ngeneral dull apathy was a roar of words--filthy and brutal beyond\r\nimagination--between the closed-packed neighbours, occasionally ending\r\nin a general row. All this almost within hearing of the traffic of the\r\nStrand, within easy reach of the wealth and plenty of the city.\r\n\r\nI used to wonder sometimes why these people did not sally forth in mass\r\nand get a few hours' eating and drinking and plunder to their hearts'\r\ncontent, before the police could stop and hang a few of them. But the\r\npoor wretches had not the heart even for that. As a slight, wiry\r\nLiverpool detective once said to me when I asked him how it was he\r\nmanaged to deal with such hulking ruffians as we were among, \"Lord bless\r\nyou, sir, drink and disease leave nothing in them.\"\r\n\r\n[This early contact with the sternest facts of the social problem\r\nimpressed him profoundly. And though not actively employed in what is\r\ngenerally called \"philanthropy,\" still he did his part, hopefully but\r\nsoberly, not only to throw light on the true issues and to strip away\r\nmake-believe from them, but also to bring knowledge to the working\r\nclasses, and to institute machinery by which capacity should be caught\r\nand led to a position where it might be useful instead of dangerous to\r\nsocial order.\r\n\r\nAfter some time, however, he left Mr. Chandler to join his second\r\nbrother-in-law (John Godwin Scott.), who had set up in the north of\r\nLondon, and to whom he was duly apprenticed, as his brother James had\r\nbeen before him. This change gave him more time and opportunity to\r\npursue his medical education. He attended lectures at the Sydenham\r\nCollege, and, as has been seen, began to prepare for the matriculation\r\nexamination of the University of London. At the Sydenham College he met\r\nwith no little success, winning, besides certificates of merit in other\r\ndepartments, a prize--his first prize--for botany. His vivid\r\nrecollections, given below, of this entry into the scientific arena are\r\ntaken from a journal he kept for his fiancee during his absence from\r\nSydney on the cruises of the \"Rattlesnake.\"]\r\n\r\nON BOARD H.M.S. \"RATTLESNAKE,\" CHRISTMAS 1847.\r\n\r\nNext summer it will be six years since I made my first trial in the\r\nworld. My first public competition, small as it was, was an epoch in my\r\nlife. I had been attending (it was my first summer session) the\r\nbotanical lectures at Chelsea. One morning I observed a notice stuck\r\nup--a notice of a public competition for medals, etc., to take place on\r\nthe 1st August (if I recollect right). It was then the end of May or\r\nthereabouts. I remember looking longingly at the notice, and some one\r\nsaid to me, \"Why don't you go in and try for it?\" I laughed at the idea,\r\nfor I was very young, and my knowledge somewhat of the vaguest.\r\nNevertheless I mentioned the matter to S. [his brother-in-law.] when I\r\nreturned home. He likewise advised me to try, and so I determined I\r\nwould. I set to work in earnest, and perseveringly applied myself to\r\nsuch works as I could lay my hands on, Lindley's and De Candolle's\r\n\"Systems\" and the \"Annales des Sciences Naturelles\" in the British\r\nMuseum. I tried to read Schleiden, but my German was insufficient.\r\n\r\nFor a young hand I worked really hard from eight or nine in the morning\r\nuntil twelve at night, besides a long hot summer's walk over to Chelsea\r\ntwo or three times a week to hear Lindley. A great part of the time I\r\nworked till sunrise. The result was a sort of ophthalmia which kept me\r\nfrom reading at night for months afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe day of the examination came, and as I went along the passage to go\r\nout I well remember dear Lizzie [His eldest sister, Mrs. Scott.], half\r\nin jest, half in earnest, throwing her shoe after me, as she said, for\r\nluck. She was alone, beside S., in the secret, and almost as anxious as\r\nI was. How I reached the examination room I hardly know, but I recollect\r\nfinding myself at last with pen and ink and paper before me and five\r\nother beings, all older than myself, at a long table. We stared at one\r\nanother like strange cats in a garret, but at length the examiner (Ward)\r\nentered, and before each was placed the paper of questions and sundry\r\nplants. I looked at my questions, but for some moments could hardly hold\r\nmy pen, so extreme was my nervousness; but when I once fairly began, my\r\nideas crowded upon me almost faster than I could write them. And so we\r\nall sat, nothing heard but the scratching of the pens and the occasional\r\ncrackle of the examiner's \"Times\" as he quietly looked over the news of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nThe examination began at eleven. At two they brought in lunch. It was a\r\ngood meal enough, but the circumstances were not particularly favourable\r\nto enjoyment, so after a short delay we resumed our work. It began to be\r\nevident between whom the contest lay, and the others determined that I\r\nwas one man's competitor and Stocks [John Ellerton Stocks, M.D., London,\r\ndistinguished himself as a botanist in India. He travelled and collected\r\nin Beloochistan and Scinde; died 1854.] (he is now in the East India\r\nservice) the other. Scratch, scratch, scratch! Four o'clock came, the\r\nusual hour of closing the examination, but Stocks and I had not half\r\ndone, so with the consent of the others we petitioned for an extension.\r\nThe examiner was willing to let us go on as long as we liked. Never did\r\nI see man write like Stocks; one might have taken him for an attorney's\r\nclerk writing for his dinner. We went on. I had finished a little after\r\neight, he went on till near nine, and then we had tea and dispersed.\r\n\r\nGreat were the greetings I received when I got home, where my long\r\nabsence had caused some anxiety. The decision would not take place for\r\nsome weeks, and many were the speculations made as to the probabilities\r\nof success. I for my part managed to forget all about it, and went on my\r\nordinary avocations without troubling myself more than I could possibly\r\nhelp about it. I knew too well my own deficiencies to have been either\r\nsurprised or disappointed at failure, and I made a point of shattering\r\nall involuntary \"castles in the air\" as soon as possible. My worst\r\nanticipations were realised. One day S. came to me with a sorrowful\r\nexpression of countenance. He had inquired of the Beadle as to the\r\ndecision, and ascertained on the latter's authority that all the\r\nsuccessful candidates were University College men, whereby, of course, I\r\nwas excluded. I said, \"Very well, the thing was not to be helped,\" put\r\nmy best face upon the matter, and gave up all thoughts of it. Lizzie,\r\ntoo, came to comfort me, and, I believe, felt it more than I did. What\r\nwas my surprise on returning home one afternoon to find myself suddenly\r\nseized, and the whole female household vehemently insisting on kissing\r\nme. It appeared an official-looking letter had arrived for me, and\r\nLizzie, as I did not appear, could not restrain herself from opening it.\r\nI was second, and was to receive a medal accordingly, and dine with the\r\nguild on the 9th November to have it bestowed.\r\n[Silver Medal of the Pharmaceutical Society, 9th November 1842. Another\r\nbotanical prize is a book--\"La Botanique,\" by A. Richard--with the\r\nfollowing inscription:--\r\n\r\n  THOMAE HUXLEY\r\n  In Exercitatione Botanices\r\n  Apud Scholam Collegii Sydenhamiensis\r\n  Optime Merenti\r\n  Hunc librum dono dedit\r\n  RICARDUS D. HOBLYN, Botanices Professor.]\r\n\r\nI dined with the company, and bore my share in both pudding and praise,\r\nbut the charm of success lay in Lizzie's warm congratulation and\r\nsympathy. Since then she always took upon herself to prophesy touching\r\nthe future fortunes of \"the boy.\"\r\n\r\n[The haphazard, unsystematic nature of preliminary medical study here\r\npresented cannot fail to strike one with wonder. Thomas Huxley was now\r\nseventeen; he had already had two years' \"practice in pharmacy\" as a\r\ntestimonial put it. After a similar apprenticeship, his brother had made\r\nthe acquaintance of the director of the Gloucester Lunatic Asylum, and\r\nwas given by him the post of dispenser or \"apothecary,\" which he filled\r\nso satisfactorily as to receive a promise that if he went to London for\r\na couple of years to complete his medical training, a substitute should\r\nbe appointed meanwhile to keep the place until he returned.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity to which both the brothers looked came in the shape of\r\nthe Free Scholarships offered by the Charing Cross Hospital to students\r\nwhose parents were unable to pay for their education. Testimonials as to\r\nthe position and general education of the candidates were required, and\r\nit is curious that one of the persons applied to by the elder Huxley was\r\nJ.H. Newman, at that time Vicar of Littlemore, who had been educated at\r\nDr. Nicholas' School at Ealing.\r\n\r\nThe application for admission to the lectures and other teaching at the\r\nHospital states of the young T.H. Huxley that \"He has a fair knowledge\r\nof Latin, reads French with facility, and knows something of German. He\r\nhas also made considerable progress in the Mathematics, having, as far\r\nas he has advanced, a thorough not a superficial knowledge of the\r\nsubject.\" The document ends in the following confident words:--\r\n\r\nI appeal to the certificates and testimonials that will be herewith\r\nsubmitted for evidence of their past conduct, offering prospectively\r\nthat these young men, if elected to the Free Scholarships of the Charing\r\nCross Hospital and Medical College, will be diligent students, and in\r\nall things submit themselves to the controul and guidance of the\r\nDirector and Medical Officers of the establishment. A father may be\r\npardoned, perhaps, for adding his belief that these young men will\r\nhereafter reflect credit on any institution from which they may receive\r\ntheir education.\r\n\r\nThe authorities replied that \"although it is not usual to receive two\r\nmembers of the same family at the same time, the officers taking into\r\nconsideration the age of Mr. Huxley, sen., the numerous and satisfactory\r\ntestimonials of his respectability, and of the good conduct and merits\r\nof the candidates, have decided upon admitting Mr. J.E. and Mr. T.\r\nHuxley on this occasion.\"\r\n\r\nThe brothers began their hospital course on October 1, 1842. Here, after\r\na time, my father seems to have begun working more steadily and\r\nsystematically than he had done before, under the influence of a really\r\ngood teacher.]\r\n\r\nLooking back [he says] on my \"Lehrjahre,\" I am sorry to say that I do\r\nnot think that any account of my doings as a student would tend to\r\nedification. In fact, I should distinctly warn ingenuous youth to avoid\r\nimitating my example. I worked extremely hard when it pleased me, and\r\nwhen it did not, which was a very frequent case, I was extremely idle\r\n(unless making caricatures of one's pastors and masters is to be called\r\na branch of industry), or else wasted my energies in wrong directions. I\r\nread everything I could lay hands upon, including novels, and took up\r\nall sorts of pursuits to drop them again quite as speedily. No doubt it\r\nwas very largely my own fault, but the only instruction from which I\r\nobtained the proper effect of education was that which I received from\r\nMr. Wharton Jones, who was the lecturer on physiology at the Charing\r\nCross School of Medicine. The extent and precision of his knowledge\r\nimpressed me greatly, and the severe exactness of his method of\r\nlecturing was quite to my taste. I do not know that I have ever felt so\r\nmuch respect for anybody as a teacher before or since. I worked hard to\r\nobtain his approbation, and he was extremely kind and helpful to the\r\nyoungster who, I am afraid, took up more of his time than he had any\r\nright to do. It was he who suggested the publication of my first\r\nscientific paper--a very little one--in the \"Medical Gazette\" of 1845,\r\nand most kindly corrected the literary faults which abounded in it,\r\nshort as it was; for at that time, and for many years afterwards, I\r\ndetested the trouble of writing, and would take no pains with it.\r\n\r\n[He never forgot his debt to Wharton Jones, and years afterwards was\r\ndelighted at being able to do him a good turn, by helping to obtain a\r\npension for him. But although in retrospect he condemns the fitfulness\r\nof his energies and his want of system, which left much to be learned\r\nafterwards, which might with advantage have been learned then, still it\r\nwas his energy that struck his contemporaries. I have a story from one\r\nof them that when the other students used to go out into the court of\r\nthe hospital after lectures were over, they would invariably catch sight\r\nof young Huxley's dark head at a certain window bent over a microscope\r\nwhile they amused themselves outside. The constant silhouette framed in\r\nthe outlines of the window tickled the fancy of the young fellows, and a\r\nwag amongst them dubbed it with a name that stuck, \"The Sign of the Head\r\nand Microscope.\"\r\n\r\nThe scientific paper, too, which he mentions, was somewhat remarkable\r\nunder the circumstances. It is not given to every medical student to\r\nmake an anatomical discovery, even a small one. In this case the boy of\r\nnineteen, investigating things for himself, found a hitherto\r\nundiscovered membrane in the root of the human hair, which received the\r\nname of Huxley's layer.\r\n\r\nSpeculations, too, such as had filled his mind in early boyhood, still\r\nhaunted his thoughts. In one of his letters from the \"Rattlesnake,\" he\r\ngives an account of how he was possessed in his student days by that\r\nproblem which has beset so many a strong imagination, the problem of\r\nperpetual motion, and even sought an interview with Faraday, whom he\r\nleft with the resolution to meet the great man some day on a more equal\r\nfooting.]\r\n\r\nMarch 1848.\r\n\r\nTo-day, ruminating over the manifold ins and outs of life in general,\r\nand my own in particular, it came into my head suddenly that I would\r\nwrite down my interview with Faraday--how many years ago? Aye, there's\r\nthe rub, for I have completely forgotten. However, it must have been in\r\neither my first or second winter session at Charing Cross, and it was\r\nbefore Christmas I feel sure.\r\n\r\nI remember how my long brooding perpetual motion scheme (which I had\r\nmade more than one attempt to realise, but failed owing to insufficient\r\nmechanical dexterity) had been working upon me, depriving me of rest\r\neven, and heating my brain with chateaux d'Espagne of endless variety. I\r\nremember, too, it was Sunday morning when I determined to put the\r\nquestions, which neither my wits nor my hands would set at rest, into\r\nsome hands for decision, and I determined to go before some tribunal\r\nfrom whence appeal should be absurd.\r\n\r\nBut to whom to go? I knew no one among the high priests of science, and\r\ngoing about with a scheme for perpetual motion was, I knew, for most\r\npeople the same thing as courting ridicule among high and low. After all\r\nI fixed upon Faraday, possibly perhaps because I knew where he was to be\r\nfound, but in part also because the cool logic of his works made me hope\r\nthat my poor scheme would be treated on some other principle than that\r\nof mere previous opinion one way or other. Besides, the known courtesy\r\nand affability of the man encouraged me. So I wrote a letter, drew a\r\nplan, enclosed the two in an envelope, and tremblingly betook myself on\r\nthe following afternoon to the Royal Institution.\r\n\r\n\"Is Dr. Faraday here?\" said I to the porter. \"No, sir, he has just gone\r\nout.\" I felt relieved. \"Be good enough to give him this letter,\" and I\r\nwas hurrying out when a little man in a brown coat came in at the glass\r\ndoor. \"Here is Dr. Faraday,\" said the man, and gave him my letter. He\r\nturned to me and courteously inquired what I wished. \"To submit to you\r\nthat letter, sir, if you are not occupied.\" \"My time is always occupied,\r\nsir, but step this way,\" and he led me into the museum or library, for I\r\nforget which it was, only I know there was a glass case against which we\r\nleant. He read my letter, did not think my plan would answer. Was I\r\nacquainted with mechanism, what we call the laws of motion? I saw all\r\nwas up with my poor scheme, so after trying a little to explain, in the\r\ncourse of which I certainly failed in giving him a clear idea of what I\r\nwould be at, I thanked him for his attention, and went off as\r\ndissatisfied as ever. The sense of one part of the conversation I well\r\nrecollect. He said \"that were the perpetual motion possible, it would\r\nhave occurred spontaneously in nature, and would have overpowered all\r\nother forces,\" or words to that effect. I did not see the force of this,\r\nbut did not feel competent enough to discuss the question.\r\n\r\nHowever, all this exorcised my devil, and he has rarely come to trouble\r\nme since. Some future day, perhaps, I may be able to call Faraday's\r\nattention more decidedly. Pergo modo! \"wie das Gestirn, ohne Hast, ohne\r\nRast\" (Das Gestirn in a midshipman's berth!).\r\n\r\n[In other respects also his student's career was a brilliant one. In\r\n1843 he won the first chemical prize, the certificate stating that his\r\n\"extraordinary diligence and success in the pursuit of this branch of\r\nscience do him infinite honour.\" At the same time, he also won the first\r\nprize in the class of anatomy and physiology. On the back of Wharton\r\nJones' certificate is scribbled in pencil: \"Well, 'tis no matter. Honour\r\npricks me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I come on? How\r\nthen?\"\r\n\r\nFinally, in 1845 he went up for his M.B. at London University and won a\r\ngold medal for anatomy and physiology, being second in honours in that\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nWhatever then he might think of his own work, judged by his own\r\nstandards, he had done well enough as medical students go. But a\r\nbrilliant career as a student did not suffice to start him in life or\r\nprovide him with a livelihood. How he came to enter the Navy is best\r\ntold in his own words.]\r\n\r\nIt was in the early spring of 1846, that, having finished my obligatory\r\nmedical studies and passed the first M.B. examination at the London\r\nUniversity, though I was still too young to qualify at the College of\r\nSurgeons, I was talking to a fellow-student (the present eminent\r\nphysician, Sir Joseph Fayrer), and wondering what I should do to meet\r\nthe imperative necessity for earning my own bread, when my friend\r\nsuggested that I should write to Sir William Burnett, at that time\r\nDirector-General for the Medical Service of the Navy, for an\r\nappointment. I thought this rather a strong thing to do, as Sir William\r\nwas personally unknown to me, but my cheery friend would not listen to\r\nmy scruples, so I went to my lodgings and wrote the best letter I could\r\ndevise. A few days afterwards I received the usual official circular of\r\nacknowledgment, but at the bottom there was written an instruction to\r\ncall at Somerset House on such a day. I thought that looked like\r\nbusiness, so at the appointed time I called and sent in my card while I\r\nwaited in Sir William's anteroom. He was a tall, shrewd-looking old\r\ngentleman, with a broad Scotch accent, and I think I see him now as he\r\nentered with my card in his hand. The first thing he did was to return\r\nit, with the frugal reminder that I should probably find it useful on\r\nsome other occasion. The second was to ask whether I was an Irishman. I\r\nsuppose the air of modesty about my appeal must have struck him. I\r\nsatisfied the Director-General that I was English to the backbone, and\r\nhe made some inquiries as to my student career, finally desiring me to\r\nhold myself ready for examination. Having passed this, I was in Her\r\nMajesty's Service, and entered on the books of Nelson's old ship the\r\n\"Victory,\" for duty at Haslar Hospital, about a couple of months after\r\nmy application.\r\n\r\nMy official chief at Haslar was a very remarkable person, the late Sir\r\nJohn Richardson, an excellent naturalist and far-famed as an indomitable\r\nArctic traveller. He was a silent, reserved man, outside the circle of\r\nhis family and intimates; and having a full share of youthful vanity, I\r\nwas extremely disgusted to find that \"Old John,\" as we irreverent\r\nyoungsters called him, took not the slightest notice of my worshipful\r\nself, either the first time I attended him, as it was my duty to do, or\r\nfor some weeks afterwards. I am afraid to think of the lengths to which\r\nmy tongue may have run on the subject of the churlishness of the chief,\r\nwho was, in truth, one of the kindest-hearted and most considerate of\r\nmen. But one day, as I was crossing the hospital square, Sir John\r\nstopped me and heaped coals of fire on my head by telling me that he had\r\ntried to get me one of the resident appointments, much coveted by the\r\nassistant-surgeons, but that the Admiralty had put in another man.\r\n\"However,\" said he, \"I mean to keep you here till I can get you\r\nsomething you will like,\" and turned upon his heel without waiting for\r\nthe thanks I stammered out. That explained how it was I had not been\r\npacked off to the West Coast of Africa like some of my juniors, and why,\r\neventually, I remained altogether seven months at Haslar.\r\n\r\nAfter a long interval, during which \"Old John\" ignored my existence\r\nalmost as completely as before, he stopped me again as we met in a\r\ncasual way, and describing the service on which the \"Rattlesnake\" was\r\nlikely to be employed, said that Captain Owen Stanley, who was to\r\ncommand the ship, had asked him to recommend an assistant surgeon who\r\nknew something of science; would I like that? Of course I jumped at the\r\noffer. \"Very well, I give you leave; go to London at once and see\r\nCaptain Stanley.\" I went, saw my future commander, who was very civil to\r\nme, and promised to ask that I should be appointed to his ship, as in\r\ndue time I was. It is a singular thing that during the few months of my\r\nstay at Haslar I had among my messmates two future Directors-General of\r\nthe Medical Service of the Navy (Sir Alexander Armstrong and Sir John\r\nWatt-Reid), with the present President of the College of Physicians, and\r\nmy kindest of doctors, Sir Andrew Clark.\r\n\r\nA letter to his eldest sister, Lizzie, dated from Haslar May 24, 1846,\r\nshows how he regarded the prospect now opening before him.]\r\n\r\n...As I see no special queries in your letter, I think I shall go on to\r\ntell you what that same way of life is likely to be--my fortune having\r\nalready been told for me (for the next five years at least). I told you\r\nin my last that I was likely to have a permanency here. Well, I was\r\nrecommended by Sir John Richardson, and should have certainly had it,\r\nhad not (luckily) the Admiralty put in a man of their own. Having a good\r\nimpudent faith in my own star (Wie das Gestirn, ohne Hast, ohne Rast), I\r\nknew this was only because I was to have something better, and so it\r\nturned out; for a day or two after I was ousted from the museum, Sir J.\r\nRichardson (who has shown himself for some reason or another a special\r\ngood friend to me) told me that he had received a letter from Captain\r\nOwen Stanley, who is to command an EXPLORING EXPEDITION to New Guinea\r\n(not coast of Africa, mind), requesting him to recommend an assistant\r\nsurgeon for this expedition--would I like the appointment? As you may\r\nimagine I was delighted at the offer, and immediately accepted it. I was\r\nrecommended accordingly to Captain Stanley and Sir W. Burnett, and I\r\nshall be appointed as soon as the ship is in commission. We are to have\r\nthe \"Rattlesnake,\" a 28-gun frigate, and as she will fit out here I\r\nshall have no trouble. We sail probably in September.\r\n\r\nNew Guinea, as you may be aware, is a place almost unknown, and our\r\nobject is to bring back a full account of its Geography, Geology, and\r\nNatural History. In the latter department with which I shall have (in\r\naddition to my medical functions) somewhat to do, we shall form one\r\ngrand collection of specimens and deposit it in the British Museum or\r\nsome other public place, and this main object being always kept in view,\r\nwe are at liberty to collect and work for ourselves as we please. Depend\r\nupon it unless some sudden attack of laziness supervenes, such an\r\nopportunity shall not slip unused out of my hands. The great difficulty\r\nin such a wide field is to choose an object. In this point, however, I\r\nhope to be greatly assisted by the scientific folks, to many of whom I\r\nhave already had introductions (Owen, Gray, Grant, Forbes), and this, I\r\nassure you, I look upon as by no means the least of the advantages I\r\nshall derive from being connected with the expedition. I have been twice\r\nto town to see Captain Stanley. He is a son of the Bishop of Norwich, is\r\nan exceedingly gentlemanly man, a thorough scientific enthusiast, and\r\nshows himself altogether very much disposed to forward my views in every\r\npossible way. Being a scientific man himself he will take care to have\r\nthe ship's arrangements as far as possible in harmony with scientific\r\npursuits--a circumstance you would appreciate as highly as I do if you\r\nwere as well acquainted as I now am with the ordinary opportunities of\r\nan assistant surgeon. Furthermore, I am given to understand that if one\r\ndoes anything at all, promotion is almost certain. So that altogether I\r\nam in a very fair way, and would snap my fingers at the Grand Turk.\r\nWharton Jones was delighted when I told him about my appointment. Dim\r\nvisions of strangely formed corpuscles seemed to cross his imagination\r\nlike the ghosts of the kings in \"Macbeth.\"\r\n\r\n        What seems his head\r\n  The likeness of a nucleated cell has on.\r\n\r\n[The law's delays are proverbial, but on this occasion, as on the return\r\nof the \"Rattlesnake,\" the Admiralty seem to have been almost as\r\nprovoking to the eager young surgeon as any lawyer could have been. The\r\nappointment was promised in May; it was not made till October. On the\r\n6th of that month there is another letter to his sister, giving fuller\r\nparticulars of his prospects on the voyage:--]\r\n\r\nMy dearest Lizzie,\r\n\r\nAt last I have really got my appointment and joined my ship. I was so\r\ncompletely disgusted with the many delays that had occurred that I made\r\nup my mind not to write to anybody again until I had my commission in my\r\nhand. Henceforward, like another Jonah, my dwelling-place will be the\r\n\"inwards\" of the \"Rattlesnake,\" and upon the whole I really doubt\r\nwhether Jonah was much worse accommodated, so far as room goes, than\r\nmyself. My total length, as you are aware, is considerable, 5 feet 11\r\ninches, possibly, but the height of the lower deck of the \"Rattlesnake,\"\r\nwhich will be my especial location, is at the outside 4 feet 10 inches.\r\nWhat I am to do with the superfluous foot I cannot divine. Happily,\r\nhowever, there is a sort of skylight into the berth, so that I shall be\r\nable to sit with the body in it and my head out.\r\n\r\nApart from joking, however, this is not such a great matter, and it is\r\nthe only thing I would see altered in the whole affair. The officers, as\r\nfar as I have seen them, are a very gentlemanly, excellent set of men,\r\nand considering we are to be together for four or five years, that is a\r\nmatter of no small importance. I am not given to be sanguine, but I\r\nconfess I expect a good deal to arise out of this appointment. In the\r\nfirst place, surveying ships are totally different from the ordinary run\r\nof men-of-war. The requisite discipline is kept up, but not in the\r\nmartinet style. Less form is observed. From the men who are appointed\r\nhaving more or less scientific turns, they have more respect for one\r\nanother than that given by mere position in the service, and hence that\r\nposition is less taken advantage of. They are brought more into contact,\r\nand hence those engaged in the surveying service almost proverbially\r\nstick by one another. To me, whose interest in the service is almost all\r\nto be made, this is a matter of no small importance.\r\n\r\nThen again, in a surveying ship you can work. In an ordinary frigate if\r\na fellow has the talents of all the scientific men from Archimedes\r\ndownwards compressed into his own peculiar skull they are all lost. Even\r\nif it were possible to study in a midshipmen's berth, you have not room\r\nin your \"chat\" for more than a dozen books. But in the \"Rattlesnake\" the\r\nwhole poop is to be converted into a large chart-room with bookshelves\r\nand tables and plenty of light. There I may read, draw, or microscopise\r\nat pleasure, and as to books, I have a carte blanche from the Captain to\r\ntake as many as I please, of which permission we shall avail\r\nourself--rather--and besides all this, from the peculiar way in which I\r\nobtained this appointment, I shall have a much wider swing than\r\nassistant surgeons in general get. I can see clearly that certain\r\nbranches of the natural history work will fall into my hands if I manage\r\nproperly through Sir John Richardson, who has shown himself a very kind\r\nfriend all throughout, and also through Captain Stanley I have been\r\nintroduced to several eminent zoologists--to Owen and Gray and Forbes of\r\nKing's College. From all these men much is to be learnt which becomes\r\npeculiarly my own, and can of course only be used and applied by me.\r\nFrom Forbes especially I have learned and shall learn much with respect\r\nto dredging operations (which bear on many of the most interesting\r\npoints of zoology). In consequence of this I may very likely be\r\nentrusted with the carrying of them out, and all that is so much the\r\nmore towards my opportunities. Again, I have learnt the calotype process\r\nfor the express purpose of managing the calotype apparatus, for which\r\nCaptain Stanley has applied to the Government.\r\n\r\nAnd having once for all enumerated all these meaner prospects of mere\r\npersonal advancement, I must confess I do glory in the prospect of being\r\nable to give myself up to my own favourite pursuits without thereby\r\nneglecting the proper duties of life. And then perhaps by the following\r\nof my favourite motto:--\r\n\r\n  Wie das Gestirn,\r\n  Ohne Hast,\r\n  Ohne Rast:--\r\n\r\nsomething may be done, and some of Sister Lizzie's fond imaginations\r\nturn out not altogether untrue.\r\n\r\nI perceive that I have nearly finished a dreadfully egotistical letter,\r\nbut I know you like to hear of my doings, so shall not apologise. Kind\r\nregards to the Doctor and kisses to the babbies. Write me a long letter\r\nall about yourselves.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate brother,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[One more description to complete the sketch of his quarters on board\r\nthe \"Rattlesnake.\" It is from a letter to his mother, written at\r\nPlymouth, where the \"Rattlesnake\" put in after leaving Portsmouth. The\r\ncomparison with the ordinary quarters of an assistant-surgeon, and the\r\nshifts to which a studious man might be put in his endeavour to find a\r\nquiet spot to work in, have a flavour of Mr. Midshipman Easy about them\r\nto relieve the deplorable reality of his situation:--]\r\n\r\nYou will be very glad to know that I am exceedingly comfortable here. My\r\ncabin has now got into tolerable order, and what with my books--which\r\nare, I am happy to say, not a few--my gay curtain and the spicy oilcloth\r\nwhich will be down on the floor, looks most respectable. Furthermore,\r\nalthough it is an unquestionably dull day I have sufficient light to\r\nwrite here, without the least trouble, to read, or even if necessary, to\r\nuse my microscope. I went to see a friend of mine on board the \"Recruit\"\r\nthe other day, and truly I hugged myself when I compared my position\r\nwith his. The berth where he and seven others eat their daily bread is\r\nhardly bigger than my cabin, except in height--and, of course, he has to\r\nsleep in a hammock. My friend is rather an eccentric character, and,\r\nbeing missed in the ship, was discovered the other day reading in the\r\nmain-top--the only place, as he said, sufficiently retired for study.\r\nAnd this is really no exaggeration. If I had no cabin I should take to\r\ndrinking in a month.\r\n\r\n[It was during this period of waiting that he attended his first meeting\r\nof the British Association, which was held in 1846 at Southampton. Here\r\nhe obtained from Professor Edward Forbes one of his living specimens of\r\nAmphioxus lanceolatus, and made an examination of its blood. The result\r\nwas a short paper read at the following meeting of the Association,\r\nwhich showed that in the composition of its blood this lowly vertebrate\r\napproached very near the invertebrates. (\"Examination of the Corpuscles\r\nof the Blood of Amphioxus lanceolatus\" \"British Association Report\" 1847\r\n2 page 95 and \"Scientific Memoirs\" 1.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.3.\r\n\r\n1846-1849.\r\n\r\n[It is a curious coincidence that, like two other leaders of science,\r\nCharles Darwin and Joseph Dalton Hooker, their close friend Huxley began\r\nhis scientific career on board one of Her Majesty's ships. He was,\r\nhowever, to learn how little the British Government of that day, for all\r\nits professions, really cared for the advancement of knowledge. (The key\r\nto this attitude on the part of the Admiralty is to be found in the\r\nscathing description in Briggs' \"Naval Administration from 1827 to 1892\"\r\npage 92, of the ruinous parsimony of either political party at this time\r\nwith regard to the navy--a policy the results of which were only too\r\napparent at the outbreak of the Crimean war. I quote a couple of\r\nsentences, \"The navy estimates were framed upon the lowest scale, and\r\nreduction pushed to the very verge of danger.\" \"Even from a financial\r\npoint of view the course pursued was the reverse of economical, and\r\nultimately led to wasteful and increased expenditure.\" Thus the liberal\r\nprofessions of the Admiralty were not fulfilled; its good will gave the\r\nyoung surgeon three and a half years of leave from active service; with\r\nan obdurate treasury, it could do no more.) But of the immense value to\r\nhimself of these years of hard training, the discipline, the knowledge\r\nof men and of the capabilities of life, even without more than the\r\nbarest necessities of existence--of this he often spoke. As he puts it\r\nin his Autobiography:--]\r\n\r\nLife on board Her Majesty's ships in those days was a very different\r\naffair from what it is now, and ours was exceptionally rough, as we were\r\noften many months without receiving letters or seeing any civilised\r\npeople but ourselves. In exchange, we had the interest of being about\r\nthe last voyagers, I suppose, to whom it could be possible to meet with\r\npeople who knew nothing of firearms--as we did on the south coast of New\r\nGuinea--and of making acquaintance with a variety of interesting savage\r\nand semi-civilised people. But, apart from experience of this kind and\r\nthe opportunities offered for scientific work, to me, personally, the\r\ncruise was extremely valuable. It was good for me to live under sharp\r\ndiscipline; to be down on the realities of existence by living on bare\r\nnecessaries: to find how extremely well worth living life seemed to be\r\nwhen one woke up from a night's rest on a soft plank, with the sky for\r\ncanopy, and cocoa and weevilly biscuit the sole prospect for breakfast;\r\nand, more especially, to learn to work for the sake of what I got for\r\nmyself out of it, even if it all went to the bottom and I along with it.\r\nMy brother officers were as good fellows as sailors ought to be and\r\ngenerally are, but, naturally, they neither knew nor cared anything\r\nabout my pursuits, nor understood why I should be so zealous in pursuit\r\nof the objects which my friends, the middies, christened \"Buffons,\"\r\nafter the title conspicuous on a volume of the \"Suites a Buffon,\" which\r\nstood on my shelf in the chart-room.\r\n\r\n[On the whole, life among the company of officers was satisfactory\r\nenough. (The Assistant-Surgeon messed in the gun-room with the middies.\r\nA man in the midst of a lot of boys, with hardly any grown-up\r\ncompanions, often has a rather unenviable position; but, says Captain\r\nHeath, who was one of these middies, Huxley's constant good spirits and\r\nfun, when he was not absorbed in his work, his freedom from any\r\nassumption of superiority over them, made the boys his good comrades and\r\nallies.) Huxley's immediate superior, John Thompson, was a man of\r\nsterling worth; and Captain Stanley was an excellent commander, and\r\nsympathetic withal. Among Huxley's messmates there was only one, the\r\nship's clerk, whoever made himself actively disagreeable, and a quarrel\r\nwith him only served to bring into relief the young surgeon's integrity\r\nand directness of action. After some dispute, in which he had been\r\nworsted, this gentleman sought to avenge himself by dropping mysterious\r\nhints as to Huxley's conduct before joining the ship. He had been\r\ntreasurer of his mess; there had been trouble about the accounts, and a\r\nscandal had barely been averted. This was not long in coming to Huxley's\r\nears. Furiously indignant as he was, he did not lose his self-control;\r\nbut promptly inviting the members of the wardroom to meet as a court of\r\nhonour, laid his case before them, and challenged his accuser to bring\r\nforward any tittle of evidence in support of his insinuations. The\r\nlatter had nothing to say for himself, and made a formal retraction and\r\napology. A signed account of the proceedings was kept by the first\r\nofficer, and a duplicate by Huxley, as a defence against any possible\r\nrevival of the slander.\r\n\r\nOn December 3, 1846, the \"Rattlesnake\" frigate left Spithead, but\r\ntouched again at Plymouth to ship 65,000 pounds sterling of specie for\r\nthe Cape. This delay was no pleasure to the young Huxley; it only served\r\nto renew the pain of parting from home, so that, after writing a last\r\nletter to reassure his mother as to the comfort of his present quarters,\r\nhe was glad to lose sight of the English coast on the 11th.\r\n\r\nMadeira was reached on the 18th. On the 26th they sailed for Rio de\r\nJaneiro, where they stayed from January 23 to February 2, 1847. Here\r\nHuxley had his first experience of tropical dredging in Botafago Bay,\r\nwith Macgillivray, naturalist to the expedition. It was a memorable\r\noccasion, the more so, because in the absence of a sieve they were\r\ncompelled to use their hands as strainers the first day. Happily the\r\nwant was afterwards supplied by a meat cover. From the following letter\r\nit seems that several prizes of value were taken in the dredge:--]\r\n\r\nRio de Janeiro, January 24, 1847.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mother,\r\n\r\nFour weeks of lovely weather and uninterrupted fair winds brought us to\r\nthis southern fairyland. In my last letter I told you a considerable\r\nyarn about Madeira, I guess, and so for fear lest you should imagine me\r\nscenery mad I will spare you any description of Rio Harbour. Suffice it\r\nto say that it contends with the Bay of Naples for the title of the most\r\nbeautiful place in the world. It must beat Naples in luxuriance and\r\nvariety of vegetation, but from all accounts, to say nothing of George's\r\n[his eldest brother] picture, falls behind it in the colours of sky and\r\nsea, that of the latter being in the harbour and for some distance\r\noutside of a dirty olive green like the washings of a painter's palette.\r\n\r\nWe have come in for the purpose of effecting some trifling repairs,\r\nwhich, though not essential to the safety of the ship, will nevertheless\r\nnaturally enhance the comfort of its inmates. This you will understand\r\nwhen I tell you that in consequence of these same defects I have had\r\nwater an inch or two deep in my cabin, wish-washing about ever since we\r\nleft Madeira.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the line on the 13th of this month, and as one of the\r\nuninitiated I went through the usual tomfoolery practised on that\r\noccasion. The affair has been too often described for me to say anything\r\nabout it. I had the good luck to be ducked and shaved early, and of\r\ncourse took particular care to do my best in serving out the unhappy\r\nbeggars who had to follow. I enjoyed the fun well enough at the time,\r\nbut unquestionably it is on all grounds a most pernicious custom. It\r\nswelled our sick list to double the usual amount, and one poor fellow, I\r\nam sorry to say, died of the effects of pleurisy then contracted.\r\n\r\nWe have been quite long enough at sea now to enable me to judge how I\r\nshall get on in the ship, and to form a very clear idea of how it fits\r\nme and how I fit it. In the first place I am exceedingly well and\r\nexceedingly contented with my lot. My opinion of the advantages lying\r\nopen to me increases rather than otherwise as I see my way about me. I\r\nam on capital terms with all the superior officers, and I find them\r\nready to give me all facilities. I have a place for my books and\r\nmicroscope in the chart room, and there I sit and read in the morning\r\nmuch as though I were in my rooms in Agar Street. My immediate superior,\r\nJohnny Thompson, is a long-headed good fellow without a morsel of humbug\r\nabout him--a man whom I thoroughly respect, both morally and\r\nintellectually. I think it will be my fault if we are not fast friends\r\nthrough the commission. One friend on board a ship is as much as anybody\r\nhas a right to expect.\r\n\r\nIt is just the interval between the sea and the land breezes, the sea\r\nlike glass, and not a breath stirring. I shall become soup if I do not\r\ngo on deck. Temperature in sun at noon 86 in shade, 139 in sun. N.B.--It\r\nhas been up to 89 in shade, 139 in sun since this.\r\n\r\nMarch 28, 1847.\r\n\r\nI see I concluded with a statement of temperature. Since then it has\r\nbeen considerably better--140 in sun; however, in the shade it rarely\r\nrises above 86 or so, and when the sea or land breezes are blowing this\r\nis rather pleasant than otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have been ashore two or three times. The town is like most Portuguese\r\ntowns, hot and stinking, the odours here being improved by a strong\r\nflavour of nigger from the slaves, of whom there is an immense number.\r\nThey seem to do all the work, and their black skins shine in the sun as\r\nthough they had been touched up with Warren, 30 Strand. They are mostly\r\nin capital condition, and on the whole look happier than the\r\ncorresponding class in England, the manufacturing and agricultural poor,\r\nI mean. I have a much greater respect for them than for their beastly\r\nPortuguese masters, than whom there is not a more vile, ignorant, and\r\nbesotted nation under the sun. I only regret that such a glorious\r\ncountry as this should be in such hands. Had Brazil been colonised by\r\nEnglishmen, it would by this time have rivalled our Indian Empire.\r\n\r\nThe naturalist Macgillivray and I have had several excursions under\r\npretence of catching butterflies, etc. On the whole, however, I think we\r\nhave been most successful in imbibing sherry cobbler, which you get here\r\nin great perfection. By the way, tell Cooke [his brother-in-law], with\r\nmy kindest regards, that -- is a lying old thief, many of the things he\r\ntold me about Macgillivray, e.g., being an ignoramus in natural history,\r\netc. etc., having proved to be lies. He is at any rate a very good\r\nornithologist, and, I can testify, is exceedingly zealous in his\r\nvocation as a collector. As in these (points) Mr. --'s statements are\r\nunquestionably false, I must confess I feel greatly inclined to\r\ndisbelieve his other assertions.\r\n\r\nMarch 29.\r\n\r\nWe sail hence on Sunday for the Cape, so I will finish up. If you have\r\nnot already written to me at that place, direct your letters to H.M.S.\r\n\"Rattlesnake,\" Sydney (to wait arrival). We shall probably be at the\r\nCape some weeks surveying, thence shall be take ourselves to the\r\nMauritius, and leave a card on Paul and Virginia, thence on to Sydney;\r\nbut it is of no use to direct to any place but the last.\r\n\r\nP.S.--The Rattlesnakes are not idle. We shall most likely have something\r\nto say to the English savans before long. If I have any frizz in the\r\nfire I will let you know.\r\n\r\n[He gives a fuller account of this piece of work in a letter to his\r\nsister, dated Sydney, August 1, 1847. The two papers in question, as\r\nappears from the briefest notice in the \"Proceedings of the Linnean\r\nSociety,\" ascribing them to William (!) Huxley, were read in 1849:--]\r\n\r\nIn my last letter I think I mentioned to you that I had worked out and\r\nsent home to the President of the Linnean Society, through Captain\r\nStanley, an account of Physalia, or Portuguese man-of-war as it is\r\ncalled, an animal whose structure and affinities had never been worked\r\nout. The careful investigation I made gave rise to several new ideas\r\ncovering the whole class of animals to which this creature belongs, and\r\nthese ideas I have had the good fortune to have had many opportunities\r\nof working out in the course of our subsequent wanderings, so that I am\r\nprovided with materials for a second paper far more considerable in\r\nextent, and embracing an altogether wider field. This second paper is\r\nnow partly in esse--that is, written out--and partly in posse--that is,\r\nin my head; but I shall send it before leaving. Its title will be\r\n\"Observations upon the Anatomy of the Diphydae, and upon the Unity of\r\nOrganisation of the Diphydae and Physophoridae,\" and it will have lots\r\nof figures to illustrate it. Now when we return from the north I hope to\r\nhave collected materials for a much bigger paper than either of these,\r\nand to which they will serve as steps. If my present anticipations turn\r\nout correct, this paper will achieve one of the great ends of Zoology\r\nand Anatomy, namely, the reduction of two or three apparently widely\r\nseparated and incongruous groups into modifications of the single type,\r\nevery step of the reasoning being based upon anatomical facts. There!\r\nThink yourself lucky you have only got that to read instead of the\r\nslight abstract of all three papers with which I had some intention of\r\nfavouring you. [These papers are to be found in volume 1 of the\r\n\"Scientific Memoirs\" of T.H. Huxley page 9.]\r\n\r\nBut five years ago you threw a slipper after me for luck on my first\r\nexamination, and I must have you to do it for everything else.\r\n\r\n[At the Cape a stay of a month was made, from March 6 to April 10, and\r\ncertain surveying work was done, after which the \"Rattlesnake\" sailed\r\nfor Mauritius. In spite of the fact that the novelty of tropical scenery\r\nhad worn off, the place made a deep impression. He writes to his mother,\r\nMay 15, 1847:--]\r\n\r\nAfter a long and somewhat rough passage from the Cape, we made the\r\nhighland of the Isle of France on the afternoon of the 3rd of this\r\nmonth, and passing round the northern extremity of the island, were\r\ntowed into Port Louis by the handsomest of tugs about noon on the 4th.\r\nIn my former letter I have spoken to you of the beauty of the places we\r\nhave visited, of the picturesque ruggedness of Madeira, the fine\r\nluxuriance of Rio, and the rude and simple grandeur of South Africa.\r\nMuch of my admiration has doubtless arisen from the novelty of these\r\ntropical or semitropical scenes, and would be less vividly revived by a\r\nsecond visit. I have become in a manner blase with fine sights and\r\nsomething of a critic. All this is to lead you to believe that I have\r\nreally some grounds for the raptures I am going into presently about\r\nMauritius. In truth it is a complete paradise, and if I had nothing\r\nbetter to do, I should pick up some pretty French Eve (and there are\r\nplenty) and turn Adam. N.B. There are NO serpents in the island.\r\n\r\nThis island is, you know, the scene of St. Pierre's beautiful story of\r\nPaul and Virginia, over which I suppose most people have sentimentalised\r\nat one time or another of their lives. Until we reached here I did not\r\nknow that the tale was like the lady's improver--a fiction founded on\r\nfact, and that Paul and Virginia were at one time flesh and blood, and\r\nthat their veritable dust was buried at Pamplemousses in a spot\r\nconsidered as one of the lions of the place, and visited as classic\r\nground. Now, though I never was greatly given to the tender and\r\nsentimental, and have not had any tendencies that way greatly increased\r\nby the elegancies and courtesies of a midshipman's berth,--not to say\r\nthat, as far as I recollect, Mdlle. Virginia was a bit of a prude, and\r\nM. Paul a pump,--yet were it but for old acquaintance sake, I determined\r\non making a pilgrimage. Pamplemousses is a small village about seven\r\nmiles from Port Louis, and the road to it is lined by rows of tamarind\r\ntrees, of cocoanut trees, and sugarcanes. I started early in the morning\r\nin order to avoid the great heat of the middle of the day, and having\r\nbreakfasted at Port Louis, made an early couple of hours' walk of it,\r\nmeeting on my way numbers of the coloured population hastening to market\r\nin all the varieties of their curious Hindoo costume. After some trouble\r\nI found my way to the \"Tombeaux\" as they call them. They are situated in\r\na garden at the back of a house now in the possession of one Mr. Geary,\r\nan English mechanist, who puts up half the steam engines for the sugar\r\nmills in the island. The garden is now an utter wilderness, but still\r\nvery beautiful; round it runs a grassy path, and in the middle of the\r\npath on each side towards the further extremity of the garden is a\r\nfuneral urn supported on a pedestal, and as dilapidated as the rest of\r\nthe affair. These dilapidations, as usual, are the work of English\r\nvisitors, relic-hunters, who are as shameless here as elsewhere. I was\r\nexceedingly pleased on the whole with my excursion, and when I returned\r\nI made a drawing of the place, which I will send some day or other.\r\n\r\nSince this I have made, in company with our purser and a passenger, Mr.\r\nKing, a regular pedestrian trip to see some very beautiful falls up the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n[Leaving Mauritius on May 17, they prolonged their voyage to Sydney by\r\nbeing requisitioned to take more specie to Hobart Town, so that Sydney\r\nwas not reached until July 16, eight months since they had had news of\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThe three months spent in this first visit to Sydney proved to be one of\r\nthe most vital periods in the young surgeon's career. From boyhood up,\r\nvaguely conscious of unrest, of great powers within him working to find\r\nexpression, he had yet been to a certain extent driven in upon himself.\r\nHe had been somewhat isolated from those of his own age by his eagerness\r\nfor problems about which they cared nothing; and the tendency to\r\nsolitude, the habit of outward reserve imposed upon an unusually warm\r\nnature, were intensified by the fact that he grew up in surroundings not\r\nwholly congenial. One member alone of his family felt with him that\r\ncomplete and vivid sympathy which is so necessary to the full\r\ndevelopment of such a nature. When he was fourteen this sister married\r\nand left home, but the bond between them was not broken. In some ways it\r\nwas strengthened by the lad's love for her children; by his grief,\r\nscarcely less than her own, at the death of her eldest little girl.\r\nMoreover they were brought into close companionship for a considerable\r\ntime when, after his dismal period of apprenticeship at Rotherhithe--to\r\nwhich he could never look back without a shudder--he came to work under\r\nher husband. She had encouraged him in his studies; had urged him to\r\nwork for the Botanical prize at Sydenham College; had brightened his\r\nlife with her sympathy, and believed firmly in the brilliant future\r\nwhich awaited him--a belief which for her sake, if for nothing else, he\r\nwas eager to justify by his best exertions.\r\n\r\nHe had not had, so far, much opportunity of entering the social world;\r\nbut his visit to Sydney gave him an opportunity of entering a good\r\nsociety to which his commission in the navy was a sufficient\r\nintroduction. He was eager to find friendships if he could, for his\r\nreserve was anything but misanthropic. It was not long before he made\r\nthe acquaintance of William Macleay, a naturalist of wide research and\r\ngreat speculative ability; and struck up a close friendship with William\r\nFanning, one of the leading merchants of the town, a friendship which\r\nwas to have momentous consequences. For it was at Fanning's house that\r\nhe met his future wife, Miss Henrietta Anne Heathorn, for whom he was to\r\nserve longer and harder than Jacob thought to serve for Rachel, but who\r\nwas to be his help and stay for forty years, in his struggles ready to\r\ncounsel, in adversity to comfort; the critic whose judgment he valued\r\nabove almost any, and whose praise he cared most to win; his first care\r\nand his latest thought, the other self, whose union with him was a\r\nsupreme example of mutual sincerity and devotion.\r\n\r\nIt was a case of love, if not actually at first sight, yet of very rapid\r\ngrowth when he came to learn the quiet strength and tenderness of her\r\nnature as displayed in the management of her sister's household. A\r\ncertain simplicity and directness united with an unusual degree of\r\ncultivation, had attracted him from the first. She had been two years at\r\nschool in Germany, and her knowledge of German and of German literature\r\nbrought them together on common ground. Things ran very smoothly at the\r\nbeginning, and the young couple, whose united ages amounted to\r\nforty-four years, became engaged.\r\n\r\nThe marriage was to take place on his promotion to the rank of full\r\nsurgeon--a promotion he hoped to attain speedily at the conclusion of\r\nthe voyage on the strength of his scientific work, for this was the\r\ninducement held out by the Admiralty to energetic subalterns. The\r\nfollowing letter to his sister describes the situation:--]\r\n\r\nSydney Harbour, March 21, 1848.\r\n\r\n...I have deferred writing to you in the hope of knowing something from\r\nyourself of your doings and whereabouts, and now that we are on the eve\r\nof departing for a long cruise in Torres Straits, I will no longer\r\npostpone the giving you some account of \"was ist geschehen\" on this side\r\nof the world. We spent three months in Sydney, and a gay three months of\r\nit we had,--nothing but balls and parties the whole time. In this corner\r\nof the universe, where men of war are rather scarce, even the old\r\n\"Rattlesnake\" is rather a lion, and her officers are esteemed\r\naccordingly. Besides, to tell you the truth, we are rather agreeable\r\npeople than otherwise, and can manage to get up a very decent turn-out\r\non board on occasion. What think you of your grave, scientific brother\r\nturning out a ball-goer and doing the \"light fantastic\" to a great\r\nextent? It is a great fact, I assure you. But there is a method in my\r\nmadness. I found it exceedingly disagreeable to come to a great place\r\nlike Sydney and think there was not a soul who cared whether I was alive\r\nor dead, so I determined to go into what society was to be had and see\r\nif I could not pick up a friend or two among the multitude of the empty\r\nand frivolous. I am happy to say that I have had more success than I\r\nhoped for or deserved, and then as now, two or three houses where I can\r\ngo and feel myself at home at all times. But my \"home\" in Sydney is the\r\nhouse of my good friend Mr. Fanning, one of the first merchants in the\r\nplace. But thereby hangs a tale which, of all people in the world, I\r\nmust tell you. Mrs. Fanning has a sister, and the dear little sister and\r\nI managed to fall in love with one another in the most absurd manner\r\nafter seeing one another--I will not tell you how few times, lest you\r\nshould laugh. Do you remember how you used to talk to me about choosing\r\na wife? Well, I think that my choice would justify even your\r\nfastidiousness...I think you will understand how happy her love ought to\r\nand does make me. I fear that in this respect indeed the advantage is on\r\nmy side, for my present wandering life and uncertain position must\r\nnecessarily give her many an anxious thought. Our future is indeed none\r\nof the clearest. Three years at the very least must elapse before the\r\n\"Rattlesnake\" returns to England, and then unless I can write myself\r\ninto my promotion or something else, we shall be just where we were.\r\nNevertheless I have the strongest persuasion that four years hence I\r\nshall be married and settled in England. We shall see.\r\n\r\nI am getting on capitally at present. Habit, inclination, and now a\r\nsense of duty keep me at work, and the nature of our cruise affords me\r\nopportunities such as none but a blind man would fail to make use of. I\r\nhave sent two or three papers home already to be published, which I have\r\ngreat hopes will throw light upon some hitherto obscure branches of\r\nnatural history, and I have just finished a more important one, which I\r\nintend to get read at the Royal Society. The other day I submitted it to\r\nWilliam Macleay (the celebrated propounder of the Quinary system), who\r\nhas a beautiful place near Sydney, and, I hear, \"werry much approves\r\nwhat I have done.\" All this goes to the comforting side of the question,\r\nand gives me hope of being able to follow out my favourite pursuits in\r\ncourse of time, without hindrance to what is now the main object of my\r\nlife. I tell Netty to look to being a \"Frau Professorin\" one of these\r\nodd days, and she has faith, as I believe would have if I told her I was\r\ngoing to be Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nWe go to the northward again about the 23rd of this month [April], and\r\nshall be away for ten or twelve months surveying in Torres Straits. I\r\nbelieve we are to refit in Port Essington, and that will be the only\r\nplace approaching to civilisation that we shall see for the whole of\r\nthat time; and after July or August next, when a provision ship is to\r\ncome up to us, we shall not even get letters. I hope and trust I shall\r\nhear from you before then. Do not suppose that my new ties have made me\r\nforgetful of old ones. On the other hand, these are if anything\r\nstrengthened. Does not my dearest Nettie love you as I do! and do I not\r\noften wish that you could see and love and esteem her as I know you\r\nwould. We often talk about you, and I tell her stories of old times.\r\n\r\n[Another letter, a year later, gives his mother the answers to a string\r\nof questions which, mother-like, she had asked him, thirsting for exact\r\nand minute information about her future daughter-in-law:--]\r\n\r\nSydney, February 1, 1849.\r\n\r\n[After describing how he had just come back from a nine months'\r\ncruise)--First and foremost, my dear mother, I must thank you for your\r\nvery kind letter of September 1848. I read the greater part of it to\r\nNettie, who was as much pleased as I with your kindly wishes towards\r\nboth of us. Now I suppose I must do my best to answer your questions.\r\nFirst, as to age, Nettie is about three months younger than myself--that\r\nis the difference in OUR years, but she is IN FACT as much younger than\r\nher years as I am older than mine. Next, as to complexion she is\r\nexceedingly fair, with the Saxon yellow hair and blue eyes. Then as to\r\nface, I really don't know whether she is pretty or not. I have never\r\nbeen able to decide the matter in my own mind. Sometimes I think she is,\r\nand sometimes I wonder how the idea ever came into my head. Whether or\r\nnot, her personal appearance has nothing whatever to do with the hold\r\nshe has upon my mind, for I have seen hundreds of prettier women. But I\r\nnever met with so sweet a temper, so self-sacrificing and affectionate a\r\ndisposition, or so pure and womanly a mind, and from the perfectly\r\nintimate footing on which I stand with her family I have plenty of\r\nopportunities of judging. As I tell her, the only great folly I am aware\r\nof her being guilty of was the leaving her happiness in the hands of a\r\nman like myself, struggling upwards and certain of nothing.\r\n\r\nAs to my future intentions I can say very little about them. With my\r\npresent income, of course, marriage is rather a bad look out, but I do\r\nnot think it would be at all fair towards Nettie herself to leave this\r\ncountry without giving her a wife's claim upon me...It is very unlikely\r\nI shall ever remain in the colony. Nothing but a very favourable chance\r\ncould induce me to do so.\r\n\r\nMuch must depend upon how things go in England. If my various papers\r\nmeet with any success, I may perhaps be able to leave the service. At\r\npresent, however, I have not heard a word of anything I have sent.\r\nProfessor Forbes has, I believe, published some of Macgillivary's\r\nletters to him, but he has apparently forgotten to write to Macgillivray\r\nhimself, or to me. So I shall certainly send him nothing more,\r\nespecially as Mr. Macleay (of this place, and a great man in the\r\nnaturalist world) has offered to get anything of mine sent to the\r\nZoological Society.\r\n\r\n[In the paper mentioned in the letter of March 21, above (\"On the\r\nAnatomy and Affinities of the Family of the Medusae\"), Huxley aimed at]\r\n\"giving broad and general views of the whole class, considered as\r\norganised upon a given type, and inquiring into its relations with other\r\nfamilies,\" [unlike previous observers whose patience and ability had\r\nbeen devoted rather to] \"stating matters of detail concerning particular\r\ngenera and species.\" [At the outset, section 8 (\"Science Memoirs\" 1 11),\r\nhe states--]\r\n\r\nI would wish to lay particular stress upon the composition of this (the\r\nstomach) and other organs of the Medusae out of TWO DISTINCT MEMBRANES,\r\nas I believe that it is one of the essential peculiarities of their\r\nstructure, and that a knowledge of the fact is of great importance in\r\ninvestigating their homologies. I will call these two membranes as such,\r\nand independently of any modifications into particular organs,\r\n\"foundation membranes.\"\r\n\r\n[And in section 56 (page 23) one of the general conclusions which he\r\ndeduces from his observations, is]\r\n\r\nThat a Medusa consists essentially of two membranes enclosing a\r\nvariously-shaped cavity, inasmuch as its various organs are so composed,\r\n\r\n[a peculiarity shared by certain other families of zoophytes. This is a\r\npoint which that eminent authority, Professor G.J. Allman, had in his\r\nmind when he wrote to call my attention\r\n\r\n\"to a fact which has been overlooked in all the notices I have seen, and\r\nwhich I regard as one of the greatest claims of his splendid work on the\r\nrecognition of zoologists. I refer to his discovery that the body of the\r\nMedusae is essentially composed of two membranes, an outer and an inner,\r\nand his recognition of these as the homologues of the two primary\r\ngerminal leaflets in the vertebrate embryo. Now this discovery stands at\r\nthe very basis of a philosophic zoology, and of a true conception of the\r\naffinities of animals. It is the ground on which Haeckel has founded his\r\nfamous Gastraea Theory, and without it Kowalesky could never have\r\nannounced his great discovery of the affinity of the Ascidians and\r\nVertebrates, by which zoologists had been startled.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.4.\r\n\r\n1848-1850.\r\n\r\n[The whole cruise of the \"Rattlesnake\" lasted almost precisely four\r\nyears, her stay in Australian waters nearly three. Of this time\r\naltogether eleven months were spent at Sydney, namely, July 16 to\r\nOctober 11, 1847; January 14 to February 2, and March 9 to April 29,\r\n1848; January 24 to May 8, 1849; and February 14 to May 2, 1850. The\r\nthree months of the first northern cruise were spent in the survey of\r\nthe Inshore Passage--the passage, that is, within the Great Barrier Reef\r\nfor ships proceeding from India to Sydney. In 1848, while waiting for\r\nthe right season to visit Torres Straits, a short cruise was made in\r\nFebruary and March, to inspect the lighthouses in Bass' Straits. It was\r\non this occasion that Huxley visited Melbourne, then an insignificant\r\ntown, before the discovery of gold had brought a rush of immigrants.\r\n\r\nThe second northern cruise of 1848, which lasted nine months, had for\r\nits object the completion of the survey of the Inner Passage as far as\r\nNew Guinea and the adjoining archipelago. The third cruise in 1849-50\r\nagain lasted nine months, and continued the survey in Torres Straits,\r\nthe Louisiade archipelago, and the south-eastern part of New Guinea.\r\nAfter this the original plan was to make a fourth cruise, filling up the\r\ncharts of the Inner Passage on the east coast, and surveying the straits\r\nof Alass between Lombok and Sumbawa in the Malay Archipelago; then,\r\ninstead of returning to Sydney, to proceed to Singapore and so home by\r\nthe Cape. But these plans were altered by the untimely death of Captain\r\nStanley on March 13, and the \"Rattlesnake\" sailed for England direct in\r\nMay 1850.\r\n\r\nThere was a great monotony about these cruises, particularly to those\r\nwho were not constantly engaged in the active work of surveying. The\r\nship sailed slowly from place to place, hunting out reefs and islets; a\r\nstay of a few days would be made at some lonely island, while charting\r\nexpeditions went out in the boats or supplies of water and fresh fruits\r\nwere laid in. On the second expedition there were two cases of scurvy on\r\nboard by the time the mail from Sydney reached the ship at Cape York\r\nwith letters and lime-juice, the first reminder of civilisation for four\r\nmonths and a half. On this cruise there was an unusual piece of interest\r\nin Kennedy's ill-fated expedition, which the \"Rattlesnake\" landed in\r\nRockingham Bay, and trusted to meet again at Cape York. Happy it was for\r\nHuxley that his duties forbade him to accept Kennedy's proposal to join\r\nthe expedition. After months of weary struggles in the dense scrub,\r\nKennedy himself, who had pushed on for help with his faithful black man\r\nJacky, was speared by the natives when almost in sight of Cape York;\r\nJack barely managed to make his way there through his enemies, and\r\nguided a party to the rescue of the two starved and exhausted survivors\r\nof the disease-stricken camp by the Sugarloaf Hill. It was barely time.\r\nAnother hour, and they too would have been killed by the crowd of\r\nblackfellows who hovered about in hopes of booty, and were only\r\ndispersed for a moment by the rescue party.\r\n\r\nOn the third cruise there were a few adventures more directly touching\r\nthe \"Rattlesnake.\" Twice the landing parties, including Huxley, were\r\nwithin an ace of coming to blows with the islanders of the Louisiades,\r\nand on one occasion a portly member of the gun-room, being cut off by\r\nthese black gentry, only saved his life by parting with all his clothes\r\nas presents to them, and keeping them amused by an impromptu dance in a\r\nstate of nature under the broiling sun, until a party came to his\r\nrelief. At Cape York also, a white woman was rescued who had been made\r\nprisoner by the blacks from a wreck, and had lived among them for\r\nseveral years. Here, too, Huxley and Macgillivray made a trip inland,\r\nand were welcomed by a native chief, who saw in the former the returning\r\nspirit of his dead brother.\r\n\r\nThroughout the voyage Huxley was busy with his pencil, and many\r\nlithographs from his drawings illustrate the account of the voyage\r\nafterwards published. As to his scientific work, he was accumulating a\r\nlarge stock of observations, but felt rather sore about the papers which\r\nhe had already sent home, for no word had reached him as to their fate,\r\nnot even that they had been received or looked over by Forbes, to whom\r\nthey had been consigned. As a matter of fact, they had not been\r\nneglected, as he was to find out on his return; but meanwhile the state\r\nof affairs was not reassuring to a man whose dearest hopes were bound up\r\nin the reception he could win for these and similar researches.\r\nAltogether, it was with no little joy that he turned his back on the\r\nsweltering heat of Torres Straits, on the great mountains of New Guinea,\r\nthe Owen Stanley range, which had remained hidden from D'Urville in the\r\n\"Astrolabe\" to be discovered by the explorers on the \"Rattlesnake,\" and\r\nthe far stretching archipelago of the Louisiades, one tiny island in\r\nwhich still bears the name of Huxley, after the assistant-surgeon of the\r\n\"Rattlesnake.\"\r\n\r\nA few extracts from letters of the time will give a more vivid idea of\r\nwhat the voyage was like. The first is from a letter to his mother,\r\ndated February 1, 1849:--]\r\n\r\n...I suppose you have wondered at the long intervals of my letters, but\r\nmy silence has been forced. I wrote from Rockingham Bay in May, and from\r\nCape York in October. After leaving the latter place we have had no\r\ncommunication with any one but the folks at Port Essington, which is a\r\nmere military post, without any certain means of communication with\r\nEngland. We were ten weeks on our passage from Port Essington to Sydney\r\nand touched nowhere, so that you may imagine we were pretty well tired\r\nof the sea by the time we reached Port Jackson.\r\n\r\nThank God we are now safely anchored in our old quarters, and for the\r\nnext three months shall enjoy a few of those comforts that make life\r\nworth the living...\r\n\r\nThe only place we have visited since my last budget to you was Port\r\nEssington, a military post which has been an object of much attention\r\nfor some time past in connection with the steam navigation between\r\nSydney and India. It is about the most useless, miserable, ill-managed\r\nhole in Her Majesty's dominions. Placed fifteen miles inland on the\r\nswampy banks of an estuary out of reach of the sea breezes, it is the\r\nmost insufferably hot and enervating place imaginable. The temperature\r\nof the water alongside the ship was from 88 to 90, i.e. about that of a\r\nmoderately warm bath, so that you may fancy what it is on land. Added to\r\nthis, the commandant is a litigious old fool, always at war with his\r\nofficers, and endeavouring to make the place as much of a hell morally\r\nas it is physically. Little more than two years ago a detachment of\r\nsixty men came out to the settlement. At the parade on the Sunday I was\r\nthere; there were just ten men present. The rest were invalided, dead,\r\nor sick. I have no hesitation in saying that half of this was the result\r\nof ill-management. The climate in itself is not particularly unhealthy.\r\nWe were all glad to get away from the place.\r\n\r\n[Another is to his sister, under date Sydney, March 14, 1849:--]\r\n\r\nBy the way, I may as well give you a short account of our cruise. We\r\nstarted from here last May to survey what is called the inner passage to\r\nIndia. You must know that the east coast of Australia has running\r\nparallel to it at distances of from five miles to seventy or eighty an\r\nalmost continuous line of coral reefs, the Great Barrier as it is\r\ncalled. Outside this line is the great Pacific, inside is a space\r\nvarying in width as above, and cut up by little islands and detached\r\nreefs. Now to get to India from Sydney, ships must go either inside or\r\noutside the Great Barrier. The inside passage has been called the Inner\r\nRoute in consequence of its desirability for steamers, and our business\r\nhas been to mark out this Inner Route safely and clearly among the\r\nlabyrinth-like islands and reefs within the Barrier. And a parlous dull\r\nbusiness it was for those who, like myself, had no necessary and\r\nconstant occupation. Fancy for five mortal months shifting from patch to\r\npatch of white sand in latitude from 17 to 10 south, living on salt pork\r\nand beef, and seeing no mortal face but our own sweet countenances\r\nconsiderably obscured by the long beard and moustaches with which,\r\npartly from laziness and partly from comfort, we had become adorned. I\r\ncultivated a peak in Charles I style, which imparted a remarkably\r\npeculiar and triste expression to my sunburnt phiz, heightened by the\r\nfact that the aforesaid beard was, I regret to say it, of a very\r\nquestionable auburn--my messmates called it red.\r\n\r\nWe convoyed a land expedition as far as the Rockingham Bay in 17 south\r\nunder a Mr. Kennedy, which was to work its way up to Cape York in 11\r\nsouth and there meet us. A fine noble fellow poor Kennedy was too. I was\r\na good deal with him at Rockingham Bay, and indeed accompanied him in\r\nthe exploring trips which he made for some four or five days in order to\r\nsee how the land lay about him. In fact we got on so well together that\r\nhe wanted me much to accompany him and join the ship again at Cape York,\r\nand if the Service would have permitted of my absence I should certainly\r\nhave done so. But it was well I did not. Out of thirteen men composing\r\nthe party but three remain alive. The rest have perished by starvation\r\nor the spears of the natives. Poor Kennedy himself had, in company with\r\nthe black fellow attached to the party, by dint of incredible exertions,\r\npushed on until he came within sight of the provision vessel waiting his\r\narrival at Cape York. But here, within grasp of his object, a large\r\nparty of natives attacked and killed him. The black fellow alone reached\r\nCape York with the news. The other two men who were saved were the sole\r\nsurvivors of the party Kennedy left behind him at a spot near the coast,\r\nand were picked up by the provision vessel when she returned.\r\n\r\nYou may be sure I am not sorry to return home. I say home advisedly, for\r\nmy friend Fanning's house is as completely my home as it well can be.\r\nAnd then Nettie had not heard anything of me for six months, so that I\r\nhave been petted and spoiled ever since we came in...as I tell her I\r\nfear she has rested her happiness on a very insecure foundation; but she\r\nis full of hope and confidence, and to me her love is the faith that\r\nmoveth mountains. We have, as you may be sure, a thousand difficulties\r\nin our way, but like Danton I take for my motto, \"De l'audace et encore\r\nde l'audace et toujours de l'audace,\" and look forward to a happy\r\ntermination, nothing doubting.\r\n\r\n[To his mother (announcing the probable time of his return).]\r\n\r\nSydney, February 11, 1850.\r\n\r\nI cannot at all realise the idea of our return. We have been leading\r\nsuch a semi-savage life for years past, such a wandering nomadic\r\nexistence, that any other seems in a manner unnatural to me. Time was\r\nwhen I should have looked upon our return with unmixed joy; but so many\r\nnew and strong ties have arisen to unite me with Sydney, that now when\r\nthe anchor is getting up for England, I scarcely know whether to rejoice\r\nor to grieve. You must not be angry, my dear Mother; I have none the\r\nless affection for you or any other of those whom I love in\r\nEngland--only a very great deal for a certain little lassie whom I must\r\nleave behind me without clearly seeing when we are to meet again. You\r\nmust remember the Scripture as my excuse, \"A man shall leave his father\r\nand mother and cleave unto his\" (I wish I could add) wife. Our long\r\ncruises are fine times for reflection, and during the last I determined\r\nthat we would be terribly prudent and get married about 1870, or the\r\nGreek Kalends, or, what is about the same thing, whenever I am afflicted\r\nwith the malheur de richesses.\r\n\r\nPeople talk about the satisfaction of an approving conscience. Mine\r\napproves me intensely; but I'll be hanged if I see the satisfaction of\r\nit. I feel much more inclined to swear \"worse than our armies in\r\nFlanders.\"...So far as my private doings are concerned, I hear very\r\nsatisfactory news of them. I heard from an old messmate of mine at\r\nHaslar the other day that Dr. MacWilliam, F.R.S., one of our\r\ndeputy-inspectors, had been talking about one of my papers, and gave him\r\nto understand that it was to be printed. Furthermore, he is a great\r\nadvocate for the claims of assistant surgeons to ward-room rank, and all\r\nthat sort of stuff, and, I am told, quoted me as an example!\r\nHenceforward I look upon the learned doctor as a man of sound sense and\r\ndiscrimination! Without joking, however, I am glad to have come under\r\nhis notice, as he may be of essential use to me. I find myself getting\r\nhorribly selfish, looking at everything with regard to the influence it\r\nmay have on my grand objects.\r\n\r\n[Further descriptions of the voyage are to be drawn from an article in\r\nthe \"Westminster Review\" for January 1854 (volume 5), in which, under\r\nthe title of \"Science at Sea,\" Huxley reviewed the \"Voyage of the\r\n'Rattlesnake'\" by Macgillivray, the naturalist to the expedition, which\r\nhad recently appeared. This book gave very few descriptions of the\r\nincidents and life on board, and so drew in many ways a colourless\r\npicture of the expedition. This defect the reviewer sought to remedy by\r\ngiving extracts from the so-called \"unpublished correspondence\" of one\r\nof the officers--sketches apparently written for the occasion--as well\r\nas from an equally unpublished but more real journal kept by the same\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThe description of the ship herself, of her inadequate equipment for the\r\nspecial purposes she was to carry out, of the officers' quiet contempt\r\nof scientific pursuits, which not even the captain's influence was able\r\nto subdue, of the illusory promises of help and advancement held out by\r\nthe Admiralty to young investigators, makes a striking foil to the\r\nspirit in which the Government of thirty years later undertook a greater\r\nscientific expedition. Perhaps some vivid recollections of this voyage\r\ndid something to better the conditions under which the later\r\ninvestigators worked.\r\n\r\nThus, page 100:]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1846, Captain Owen Stanley, a young and zealous officer, of\r\ngood report for his capabilities as a scientific surveyor, was entrusted\r\nwith the command of the \"Rattlesnake,\" a vessel of six-and-twenty guns,\r\nstrong and seaworthy, but one of that class unenviably distinguished in\r\nthe war-time as a \"donkey-frigate.\" To the laity it would seem that a\r\nship journeying to unknown regions, when the lives of a couple of\r\nhundred men may, at any moment, depend upon her handiness in going\r\nabout, so as to avoid any suddenly discovered danger, should possess the\r\nbest possible sailing powers. The Admiralty, however, makes its\r\nselection upon other principles, and exploring vessels will be\r\ninvariably found to be the slowest, clumsiest, and in every respect the\r\nmost inconvenient ships which wear the pennant. In accordance with the\r\nrule, such was the \"Rattlesnake\"; and to carry out the spirit of the\r\nauthorities more completely, she was turned out of Portsmouth dockyard\r\nin such a disgraceful state of unfitness, that her lower deck was\r\ncontinually under water during the voyage.\r\n\r\n[Again, page 100:]\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to be provided with books of reference, which are\r\nruinously expensive to a private individual, though a mere dewdrop in\r\nthe general cost of the fitting out of a ship, especially as they might\r\nbe kept in store, and returned at the end of a commission, like other\r\nstores. A hundred pounds sterling would have well supplied the\r\n\"Rattlesnake\"; but she sailed without a volume, an application made by\r\nher captain not having been attended to.\r\n\r\n[Page 103:]\r\n\r\nOf all those who were actively engaged upon the survey, the young\r\ncommander alone was destined by inevitable fate to be robbed of his just\r\nreward. Care and anxiety, from the mobility of his temperament, sat not\r\nso lightly upon him as they might have done, and this, joined to the\r\nphysical debility produced by the enervating climate of New Guinea,\r\nfairly wore him out, making him prematurely old before much more than\r\nhalf of the allotted span was completed. But he died in harness, the end\r\nattained, the work that lay before him honourably done. Which of us may\r\ndare to ask for more? He has raised an enduring monument in his works,\r\nand his epitaph shall be the grateful thanks of many a mariner threading\r\nhis way among the mazes of the Coral Sea.\r\n\r\n[Page 104:]\r\n\r\nThe world enclosed within the timbers of a man-of-war is a most\r\nremarkable community, hardly to be rendered vividly intelligible to the\r\nmere landsman in these days of constitutional government and freedom of\r\nthe press.\r\n\r\n[Then follows a vigorous sketch of sea life from Chamisso, suggesting\r\nthat the type of one's relation to the captain is to be found in Jean\r\nPaul's \"Biography of the Twins,\" who were united back to back. This\r\nsketch Huxley enforces by a passage from the imaginary journal\r\naforesaid,] \"indited apparently when the chains were yet new and\r\nsomewhat galled the writer,\" [to judge from which] \"little alteration\r\nwould seem to have taken place in nautical life\" [since Chamisso's\r\nvoyage, thirty years before.]\r\n\r\nYou tell me [he writes], that you sigh for my life of freedom and\r\nadventure; and that, compared with mine, the conventional monotony of\r\nyour own stinks in your nostrils. My dear fellow, be patient, and listen\r\nto what I have to say; you will then, perhaps, be a little more content\r\nwith your lot in life, and a little less desirous of mine. Of all extant\r\nlives, that on board a ship-of-war is the most artificial--whether\r\nnecessarily so or not is a question I will not undertake to decide; but\r\nthe fact is indubitable.\r\n\r\nHow utterly disgusted you get with one another! Little peculiarities\r\nwhich would give a certain charm and variety to social intercourse under\r\nany other circumstances, become sources of absolute pain, and almost\r\nuncontrollable irritation, when you are shut up with them day and night.\r\nOne good friend and messmate of mine has a peculiar laugh, whose\r\niteration on our last cruise nearly drove me insane.\r\n\r\nThere is no being alone in a ship. Sailors are essentially gregarious\r\nanimals, and don't at all understand the necessity under which many\r\npeople labour--I among the rest--of having a little solitary converse\r\nwith oneself occasionally.\r\n\r\nThen, to a landsman fresh from ordinary society and its peculiarly\r\nundemonstrative ways, there is something very wonderful about naval\r\ndiscipline. I do not mean to say that the subordination kept up is more\r\nthan is necessary, nor perhaps is it in reality greater than is to be\r\nfound in a college, or a regiment, or a large mercantile house; but it\r\nis made so VERY obvious. You not only feel the bit, but you see it; and\r\nyour bridle is hung with bells to tell you of its presence.\r\n\r\nYour captain is a very different person, in relation to his officers,\r\nfrom the colonel of a regiment; he is a demi-god, a Dalai lama, living\r\nin solitary state; sublime, unapproachable; and the radiation of his\r\ndignity stretches through all the other members of the nautical\r\nhierarchy; hence all sorts of petty intrigues, disputes, grumblings, and\r\njealousies, which, to the irreverent eye of an \"idler,\" give to the\r\nwhole little society the aspect of nothing so much as the court of Prinz\r\nIrenaeus in Kater Murr's inestimable autobiography.\r\n\r\n[Page 107 sq.:\r\n\r\nAfter describing the illusory promises of the Admiralty and their\r\ngrudging spirit towards the scientific members of the expedition, he\r\ncontinues:--]\r\n\r\nThese are the FACILITIES AND ENCOURAGEMENT to science afforded by the\r\nAdmiralty; and it cannot be wondered at if the same spirit runs through\r\nits subordinate officers.\r\n\r\nNot that there is any active opposition--quite the reverse. But it is a\r\ncurious fact, that if you want a boat for dredging, ten chances to one\r\nthey are always actually or potentially otherwise disposed of; if you\r\nleave your towing-net trailing astern in search of new creatures, in\r\nsome promising patch of discoloured water, it is, in all probability,\r\nfound to have a wonderful effect in stopping the ship's way, and is\r\nhauled in as soon as your back is turned; or a careful dissection\r\nwaiting to be drawn may find its way overboard as a \"mess.\"\r\n\r\nThe singular disrespect with which the majority of naval officers regard\r\neverything that lies beyond the sphere of routine, tends to produce a\r\ntone of feeling very unfavourable to scientific exertions. How can it be\r\notherwise, in fact, with men who, from the age of thirteen, meet with no\r\ninfluence but that which teaches them that the \"Queen's regulations and\r\ninstructions\" are the law and the prophets, and something more?\r\n\r\nIt may be said, without fear of contradiction, that in time of peace the\r\nonly vessels which are engaged in services involving any real hardship\r\nor danger are those employed upon the various surveys; and yet the men\r\nof easy routine--harbour heroes--the officers of REGULAR men-of-war, as\r\nthey delight to be called, pretend to think surveying a kind of\r\nshirking--in sea-phrase, \"sloping.\" It is to be regretted that the\r\nofficers of the surveying vessels themselves are too often imbued with\r\nthe same spirit; and though, for shame's sake, they can but stand up for\r\nhydrography, they are too apt to think an alliance with other branches\r\nof science as beneath the dignity of their divinity--the \"Service.\"\r\n\r\n[Page 112:]\r\n\r\nAny adventures ashore were mere oases, separated by whole deserts of the\r\nmost wearisome ennui. For weeks, perhaps, those who were not fortunate\r\nenough to be living hard and getting fatigued every day in the boats\r\nwere yawning away their existence in an atmosphere only comparable to\r\nthat of an orchid-house, a life in view of which that of Mariana in the\r\nmoated grange has its attractions.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider this extract from the journal of one of the\r\nofficers, date August 1849:--\r\n\r\n\"Rain! rain! encore et toujours--I wonder if it is possible for the mind\r\nof man to conceive anything more degradingly offensive than the\r\ncondition of us 150 men, shut up in this wooden box, and being watered\r\nwith hot water, as we are now. It is no exaggeration to say HOT, for the\r\ntemperature is that at which people at home commonly take a hot bath. It\r\nrains so hard that we have caught seven tons of water in one day, and it\r\nis therefore impossible to go on deck, though, if one did, one's\r\ncondition would not be much improved. A HOT Scotch mist covers the sea\r\nand hides the land, so that no surveying can be done; moving about in\r\nthe slightest degree causes a flood of perspiration to pour out; all\r\nenergy is completely gone, and if I could help it I would not think\r\neven; it's too hot. The rain awnings are spread, and we can have no wind\r\nsails up; if we could, there is not a breath of wind to fill them; and\r\nconsequently the lower and main decks are utterly unventilated: a sort\r\nof solution of man in steam fills them from end to end, and surrounds\r\nthe lights with a lurid halo. It's too hot to sleep, and my sole\r\namusement consists in watching the cockroaches, which are in a state of\r\nintense excitement and happiness. They manifest these feelings in a very\r\nremarkable manner--a sudden unanimous impulse seems to seize the obscene\r\nthousands which usually lurk hidden in the corners of my cabin. Out they\r\nrush, helter-skelter, and run over me, my table, and my desk; others,\r\nmore vigorous, fly, quite regardless of consequences, until they hit\r\nagainst something, upon which, half spreading their wings, they make\r\ntheir heads a pivot and spin round in a circle, in a manner which\r\nindicates a temporary aberration of the cockroach mind. It is these\r\noutbreaks alone which rouse us from our lassitude. Knocks are heard\r\nresounding on all sides, and each inhabitant of a cabin, armed with a\r\nslipper, is seen taking ample revenge upon the disturbers of his rest\r\nand the destroyers of his body and clothes.\"\r\n\r\nHere, on the other hand, is an oasis, a bartering scene at Bruny Island,\r\nin the Louisiade:--\r\n\r\n\"We landed at the same place as before, and this time the natives ran\r\ndown prancing and gesticulating. Many of them had garlands of green\r\nleaves round their heads, knees, and ankles; some wore long streamers\r\ndepending from their arms and ears and floating in the wind as they\r\ngalloped along, shaking their spears and prancing just as boys do when\r\nplaying at horses. They soon surrounded us, shouting 'Kelumai! Kelumai!'\r\n(their word for iron), and offering us all sorts of things in exchange.\r\nOne very fine athletic man, \"Kaioo-why-who-at' by name, was perfectly\r\nmad to get an axe, and very soon comprehended the arrangements that were\r\nmade. Mr. Brady drew ten lines on the sand and laid an axe down by them,\r\ngiving K-- (I really can't write that long name all over again) to\r\nunderstand by signs that when there was a 'bahar' (yam) on every mark he\r\nshould have the axe. He comprehended directly, and bolted off as fast as\r\nhe could run, soon returning with his hands full of yams, which he\r\ndeposited one by one on the appropriate lines; then fearful lest some of\r\nthe others should do him out of the axe, he caught hold of Brady by the\r\narm, and would not let him go until yams enough had been brought by the\r\nothers to make up the number, and the axe was handed over to him.\r\n\r\n\"Then was there a yell of delight! He jumped up with the axe, flourished\r\nit, passed it to his companions, tumbled down and rolled over, kicking\r\nup his heels in the air, and finally, catching hold of me, we had a\r\ngrand waltz, with various poses plasticques, for about a quarter of a\r\nmile. I daresay he was unsophisticated enough to imagine that I was\r\nfilled with sympathetic joy, but I grieve to say that I was taking care\r\nall the while to direct his steps towards the village, which, as we had\r\nas yet examined none of their houses, I was most desirous of entering\r\nunder my friend's sanction. I think he suspected something, for he\r\nlooked at me rather dubiously when I directed our steps towards the\r\nentrance in the bush which led to the houses, and wanted me to go back;\r\nbut I was urgent, so he gave way, and we both entered the open space,\r\nwhere we were joined by two or three others, and sat down under a\r\ncocoanut tree.\r\n\r\n\"I persuaded him to sit for his portrait (taking care first that my back\r\nwas against the tree and my pistols handy), and we ate green cocoanuts\r\ntogether, at last attaining to so great a pitch of intimacy that he made\r\nme change names with him, calling himself 'Tamoo' (my Cape York name),\r\nand giving me to understand that I was to take his own lengthy\r\nappellation. When I did so, and talked to him as 'Tamoo,' nothing could\r\nexceed the delight of all around; they patted me as you would a child,\r\nand evidently said to one another, 'This really seems to be a very\r\nintelligent white fellow.'\r\n\r\n\"Like the Cape York natives, they were immensely curious to look at\r\none's legs, asking permission, very gently but very pressingly, to pull\r\nup the trouser, spanning the calf with their hands, drawing in their\r\nbreath and making big eyes all the while. Once, when the front of my\r\nshirt blew open, and they saw the white skin of my chest, they set up an\r\nuniversal shout. I imagine that as they paint THEIR faces black, they\r\nfancied that we ingeniously coloured ours white, and were astonished to\r\nsee that we were really of that (to them) disgusting tint all over.\"\r\n\r\n[On May 2, 1850, the \"Rattlesnake\" sailed for the last time out of\r\nSydney harbour, bound for England by way of the Horn. In spite of his\r\ncheerful anticipations, Huxley was not to see his future wife again for\r\nfive years more, when he was at length in a position to bid her come and\r\njoin him. During the three years of their engagement in Australia, they\r\nhad at least been able to see each other at intervals, and to be\r\ntogether for months at a time. In the long periods of absence, also,\r\nthey had invented a device to cheat the sense of separation. Each kept a\r\nparticular journal, to be exchanged when they met again, and only to be\r\nread, day by day, during the next voyage. But now it was very different,\r\ntheir only means of communication being the slow agency of the post,\r\nbeset with endless possibilities of misunderstanding when it brought\r\nbelated answers to questions already months old and out of date in the\r\nchanged aspect of circumstances. These perils, however, they weathered,\r\nand it proves how deep in the moral nature of each the bond between them\r\nwas rooted, that in the end they passed safely through the still greater\r\ndanger of imperceptibly growing estranged from one another under the\r\ninfluences of such utterly different surroundings.\r\n\r\nA kindly storm which forced the old ship to put into the Bay of Islands\r\nto repair a number of small leaks that rendered the lower deck\r\nuninhabitable, made it possible for Huxley to send back a letter that\r\nshould reach Australia in one month instead of ten after his departure.\r\n\r\nHe utilized a week's stay here characteristically enough in an\r\nexpedition to Waimate, the chief missionary station and the school of\r\nthe native institutions (a sort of Normal School for native teachers),\r\nin order to judge of his own inspection what missionary life was like.]\r\n\r\nI have been greatly surprised in these good people [he writes]. I had\r\nexpected a good deal of \"straight-hairedness\" (if you understand the\r\nphrase) and methodistical puritanism, but I find it quite otherwise.\r\nBoth Mr. and Mrs. Burrows seem very quiet and\r\nunpretending--straightforward folks desirous of doing their best for the\r\npeople among whom they are placed.\r\n\r\n[One touch must not be allowed to pass unnoticed in his appreciation of\r\nthe missionaries' unstudied welcome to the belated travellers, whose\r\nproper host was unable to take them in:--\"tea unlimited and a blazing\r\nfire, TOGETHER WITH A VERY NICE CAT.\"\r\n\r\nBy July 12, midwinter of course in the southern hemisphere, they had\r\nrounded the Horn, and Huxley writes from that most desolate of British\r\npossessions, the Falkland Islands:--]\r\n\r\nI have great hopes of being able to send a letter to you, via\r\nCalifornia, even from this remote corner of the world. It is the Ultima\r\nThule and no mistake. Fancy two good-sized islands with undulated\r\nsurface and sometimes elevated hills, but without tree or bush as tall\r\nas a man. When we arrived the 8th inst. the barren uniformity was\r\nrendered still more obvious by the deep coating of snow which enveloped\r\neverything. How can I describe to you \"Stanley,\" the sole town,\r\nmetropolis, and seat of government? It consists of a lot of black, low,\r\nweatherboard houses scattered along the hillsides which rise round the\r\nharbour. One barnlike place is Government House, another the pensioners'\r\nbarracks, rendered imposing by four field-pieces in front; others\r\nsmaller are the residences of the colonel, surgeon, etc. In one\r\nparticularly black and unpromising-looking house lives a Mrs. Sulivan,\r\nthe wife of Captain Sulivan, who surveyed these islands, and has settled\r\nout here. (Captain Sulivan, who sailed with Darwin in the \"Beagle,\" and\r\nserved with great distinction in command of the southern division of the\r\nfleet in the battle of Obligado (Plate River), had surveyed the Falkland\r\nIslands many years before his temporary settlement there. During the\r\nCrimean War he was surveying officer to the Baltic fleet, and afterwards\r\nnaval adviser to the Board of Trade. He was afterwards Admiral and\r\nK.C.B.) I asked myself if I could have had the heart to bring you to\r\nsuch a desolate place, and myself said \"No.\" However, I believe she is\r\nvery happy with her children. Sulivan is a fine energetic man, so I\r\nsuppose if she loves him, well and good, and fancies (is she not a silly\r\nwoman?) that she has her reward. Mrs. Stanley has gone to stay with them\r\nwhile the ship remains here, and I think I shall go and look them up\r\nunder pretence of making a call. They say that the present winter is far\r\nmore savage than the generality of Falkland Island winters, and it had\r\nneed be, for I never felt anything so bitterly cold in my life. The\r\nthermometer has been down below 22, and shallow parts of the harbour\r\neven have frozen. Nothing to be done ashore. My rifle lies idle in its\r\ncase; no chance of a shot at a bull, and one has to go away 20 miles to\r\nget hold even of the upland geese and rabbits. The only thing to be done\r\nis to eat, eat, eat, and the cold assists one wonderfully in that\r\noperation. You consume a pound or so of beefsteaks at breakfast and then\r\nwalk the deck for an appetite at dinner, when you take another pound or\r\ntwo of beef or a goose, or some such trifle. By four o'clock it is dark\r\nnight, and as it is too cold to read the only thing to be done is to\r\nvanish under blankets as soon as possible and take twelve or fourteen\r\nhours' sleep.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanley's Bougirigards [The Australian love-bird; a small\r\nparrakeet.], which I have taken under my care during the cold weather,\r\nadmire this sort of thing exceedingly and thrive under it, so I suppose\r\nI ought to.\r\n\r\nThe journey from New Zealand here has been upon the whole favourable; no\r\ngales--quite the reverse--but light variable winds and calms. The latter\r\npart of our voyage has, however, been very cold, snow falling in\r\nabundance, and the ice forming great stalactites about our bows. We have\r\nseen no icebergs nor anything remarkable. From all I can learn it is\r\nmost probable that we shall leave in about a week and shall go direct to\r\nEngland without stopping at any other port. I wish it may be so. I want\r\nto get home and look about me.\r\n\r\nWe have had news up to the end of March. There is nothing of any\r\nimportance going on. By the Navy list for April I see that I shall be as\r\nnearly as possible in the middle of those of my own rank, i.e. I shall\r\nhave about 150 above and as many below me. This is about what I ought to\r\nexpect in the ordinary run of promotion in eight years, and I have\r\nserved four and a half of that time. I don't expect much in the way of\r\npromotion, especially in these economic times; but I do not fear that I\r\nshall be able to keep me in England for at least a year after our\r\narrival, in order to publish my papers. The Admiralty have quite\r\nrecently published a distinct declaration that they will consider\r\nscientific attainments as a claim to their notice, and I expect to be\r\nthe first to remind them of their promise, and I will take care to have\r\nthe reminder so backed that they must and shall take note of it. Even if\r\nthey will not promote me at once, it would answer our purpose to have an\r\nappointment to some ship on the home station for a short time.\r\n\r\n[The last of the Falklands was seen on July 25; the line was crossed in\r\nthirty-six days; another month, and water running short, it was found\r\nnecessary to put in at the Azores for a week. Leaving Fayal on October\r\n5, the \"Rattlesnake\" reached Plymouth on the 23rd, but next day\r\nproceeded to Chatham, which, thanks to baffling winds, was not reached\r\ntill November 9, when the ship was paid off.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.5.\r\n\r\n1850-1851.\r\n\r\n[In the Huxley Lecture for 1898 (\"Times,\" October 4) Professor Virchow\r\ntakes occasion to speak of the effect of Huxley's service in the\r\n\"Rattlesnake\" upon his intellectual development:--\r\n\r\nWhen Huxley himself left Charing Cross Hospital in 1846, he had enjoyed\r\na rich measure of instruction in anatomy and physiology. Thus trained,\r\nhe took the post of naval surgeon, and by the time that he returned,\r\nfour years later, he had become a perfect zoologist and a keen-sighted\r\nethnologist. How this was possible any one will readily understand who\r\nknows from his own experience how great the value of personal\r\nobservation is for the development of independent and unprejudiced\r\nthought. For a young man who, besides collecting a rich treasure of\r\npositive knowledge, has practised dissection and the exercise of a\r\ncritical judgment, a long sea-voyage and a peaceful sojourn among\r\nentirely new surroundings afford an invaluable opportunity for original\r\nwork and deep reflection. Freed from the formalism of the schools,\r\nthrown upon the use of his own intellect, compelled to test each single\r\nobject as the prevailing system and becomes, first a sceptic, and then\r\nan investigator. This change, which did not fail to affect Huxley, and\r\nthrough which arose that Huxley whom we commemorate to-day, is no\r\nunknown occurrence to one who is acquainted with the history, not only\r\nof knowledge, but also of scholars.\r\n\r\nBut he was not destined to find his subsequent path easy. Once in\r\nEngland, indeed, he did not lose any time. No sooner had the\r\n\"Rattlesnake\" touched at Plymouth than Commander Yule, who had succeeded\r\nCaptain Stanley in the command of the ship, wrote to the head of the\r\nNaval Medical Department stating the circumstances under which Huxley's\r\nzoological investigations had been undertaken, and asking the sanction\r\nof the Admiralty for their publication. The hydrographer, in sending the\r\nformal permission, says:--\r\n\r\nBut I have to add that their Lordships will not allow any charge to be\r\nmade upon the public funds towards the expense. You will, however,\r\nfurther assure Mr. Huxley that any assistance that can be supplied from\r\nthis office shall be most cheerfully given to him, and that I heartily\r\nhope, from the capacity and taste for scientific investigation for which\r\nyou give him credit, that he will produce a work alike creditable to\r\nhimself, to his late Captain, by whom he was selected for it, and to Her\r\nMajesty's service.\r\n\r\nPersonally, the hydrographer took a great interest in science; but as\r\nfor the department, Huxley somewhat bitterly interpreted the official\r\nmeaning of this well-sounding flourish to be made: \"Publish if you can,\r\nand give us credit for granting every facility except the one means of\r\npublishing.\"\r\n\r\nHappily there was another way of publishing, if the Admiralty would\r\ngrant him time to arrange his papers and superintend their publication.\r\nThe Royal Society had at their disposal an annual grant of money for the\r\npublication of scientific works. If the Government would not contribute\r\ndirectly to publish the researches made under their auspices, the\r\nfavourable reception which his preliminary papers had met with led\r\nHuxley to hope that his greater work would be undertaken by the Royal\r\nSociety. If the leading men of science attested the value of his work,\r\nthe Admiralty might be induced to let him stay in England with the\r\nnominal appointment as assistant surgeon to H.M.S. \"Fisguard\" at\r\nWoolwich, for \"particular service,\" but with leave of absence from the\r\nship so that he could live and pursue his avocations in London. There\r\nwas a precedent for this course in the case of Dr. Hooker, when he had\r\nto work out the scientific results of the voyage of the \"Erebus\" and\r\n\"Terror.\"\r\n\r\nIn this design he was fortified by his old Haslar friend, Dr.\r\n(afterwards Sir John) Watt Reid, who wrote: \"They cannot, and, I am\r\nsure, will not wish to stand in your way at Whitehall.\" Meanwhile, the\r\nfirst person, naturally, he had thought of consulting was his old chief,\r\nSir John Richardson, who had great weight at the Admiralty, and to him\r\nhe wrote the following letter before leaving Plymouth.]\r\n\r\nTo Sir John Richardson.\r\n\r\nOctober 31, 1850.\r\n\r\nI regret very much that in consequence of our being ordered to be paid\r\noff at Chatham, instead of Portsmouth, as we always hoped and expected,\r\nI shall be unable to submit to your inspection the zoological notes and\r\ndrawings which I have made during our cruise. They are somewhat numerous\r\n(over 180 sheets of drawings), and I hope not altogether valueless,\r\nsince they have been made with as great care and attention as I am\r\nmaster of--and with a microscope, such as has rarely, if ever, made a\r\nvoyage round the world before. A further reason for indulging in this\r\nhope consists in the fact that they relate for the most part to animals\r\nhitherto very little known, whether from their rarity or from their\r\nperishable nature, and that they bear upon many curious physiological\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nI may thus classify and enumerate the observations I have made:--\r\n\r\n1. Upon the organs of hearing and circulation in some of the transparent\r\nCrustacea, and upon the structure of certain of the lower forms of\r\nCrustacea.\r\n\r\n2. Upon some very remarkable new forms of Annelids, and especially upon\r\nthe much contested genus Sagitta, which I have evidence to show is\r\nneither a Mollusc nor an Epizoon, but an Annelid.\r\n\r\n3. Upon the nervous system of certain Mollusca hitherto imperfectly\r\ndescribed--upon what appears to me to be an urinary organ in many of\r\nthem--and upon the structure of Firola and Atlanta, of which latter I\r\nhave a pretty complete account.\r\n\r\n4. Upon two perfectly new (ordinally new) species of Ascidians.\r\n\r\n5. Upon Pyrosoma and Salpa. The former has never been described (I\r\nthink) since Savigny's time, and he had only specimens preserved in\r\nspirits. I have a great deal to add and alter. Then as to Salpa, whose\r\nmode of generation has always been so great a bone of contention, I have\r\na long series of observations and drawings which I have verified over\r\nand over again, and which, if correct, must give rise to quite a new\r\nview of the matter. I may mention as an interesting fact that in these\r\nanimals so low in the scale I have found a PLACENTAL CIRCULATION,\r\nrudimentary indeed, but nevertheless a perfect model on a small scale of\r\nthat which takes place in the mammalia.\r\n\r\n6. I have the materials for a monograph upon the Acalephae and\r\nHydrostatic Acalephae. I have examined very carefully more than forty\r\ngenera of these animals--many of them very rare, and some quite new. But\r\nI paid comparatively little attention to the collection of new species,\r\ncaring rather to come to some clear and definite idea as to the\r\nstructure of those which had indeed been long known, but very little\r\nunderstood. Unfortunately for science, but fortunately for me, this\r\nmethod appears to have been somewhat novel with observers of these\r\nanimals, and consequently everywhere new and remarkable facts were to be\r\nhad for the picking up.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that one could occupy one's self with the\r\nanimals for so long without coming to some conclusion as to their\r\nsystematic place, however subsidiary to observation such considerations\r\nmust always be regarded, and it seems to me (although on such matters I\r\ncan of course only speak with the greatest hesitation) that just as the\r\nmore minute and careful observations made upon the old \"Vermes\" of\r\nLinnaeus necessitated the breaking up of that class into several very\r\ndistinct classes, so more careful investigation requires the breaking up\r\nof Cuvier's \"Radiata\" (which succeeded the \"Vermes\" as a sort of\r\nzoological lumber-room) into several very distinct and well-defined new\r\nclasses, of which the Acalephae, Hydrostatic Acalephae, actinoid and\r\nhydroid polypes, will form one. But I fear that I am trespassing beyond\r\nthe limits of a letter. I have only wished to state what I have done in\r\norder that you may judge concerning the propriety or impropriety of what\r\nI propose to do. And I trust that you will not think that I am presuming\r\ntoo much upon your kindness if I take the liberty of thus asking your\r\nadvice about my own affairs. In truth, I feel in a manner responsible to\r\nyou for the use of the appointment you procured for me; and furthermore,\r\nCaptain Stanley's unfortunate decease has left the interests of the ship\r\nin general and my own in particular without a representative.\r\n\r\nCan you inform me, then, what chance I should have either (1) of\r\nprocuring a grant for the publication of my papers, or (2) should that\r\nnot be feasible, to obtain a nominal appointment (say to the \"Fisguard\"\r\nat Woolwich, as in Dr. Hooker's case) for such time as might be\r\nrequisite for the publication of my papers and drawings in some other\r\nway?\r\n\r\nI shall see Professors Owen and Forbes when I reach London, and I have a\r\nletter of introduction to Sir John Herschel (who has, I hear, a great\r\npenchant for the towing-net). Supposing I could do so, would it be of\r\nany use to procure recommendations from them that my papers should be\r\npublished?\r\n\r\n[[Half-erased] To Sir F. Beaufort also I have a letter.] Would it not be\r\nproper also to write to Sir W. Burnett acquainting him with my views,\r\nand requesting his acquiescence and assistance?\r\n\r\nBegging an answer at your earliest convenience, addressed either to the\r\n\"Rattlesnake\" or to my brother, I remain, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n41 North Bank.\r\n\r\n[He received a most friendly reply from \"Old John.\" He was willing to do\r\nall in his power to help, but could recommend Government aid better if\r\nhe had seen the drawings. Meantime a certificate should be got from\r\nForbes, the best man in this particular branch of science, backed, if\r\npossible, by Owen. He would speak to some officials himself, and give\r\nHuxley introductions to others, and if he could get up to town, would\r\ntry to see the collections and add his name to the certificate.\r\n\r\nBoth Forbes and Owen were ready to help. The former wrote a most\r\nencouraging letter, singling out the characteristics which gave a\r\npeculiar value to these papers:--\r\n\r\nI have had very great pleasure in examining your drawings of animals\r\nobserved during the voyage of the \"Rattlesnake,\" and have also fully\r\navailed myself of the opportunity of going over the collections made\r\nduring the course of the survey upon which you have been engaged. I can\r\nsay without exaggeration that more important or more complete zoological\r\nresearches have never been conducted during any voyage of discovery in\r\nthe southern hemisphere. The course you have taken of directing your\r\nattention mainly to impreservable creatures, and to those orders of the\r\nanimal kingdom respecting which we have least information, and the care\r\nand skill with which you have conducted elaborate dissections and\r\nmicroscopic examinations of the curious creatures you were so fortunate\r\nas to meet with, necessarily gives a peculiar and unique character to\r\nyour researches, since thereby they fill up gaps in our knowledge of the\r\nanimal kingdom. This is the more important, since such researches have\r\nbeen almost always neglected during voyages of discovery. The value of\r\nsome of your notes was publicly acknowledged during your absence, when\r\nyour memoir on the structure of the Medusae, communicated to the Royal\r\nSociety, was singled out for publication in the \"Philosophical\r\nTransactions.\" It would be a very great loss to science if the mass of\r\nnew matter and fresh observation which you have accumulated were not to\r\nbe worked out and fully published, as well as an injustice to the merits\r\nof the expedition in which you have served.\r\n\r\nThe latter offered to write to the Admiralty on his behalf, giving the\r\nweight of his name to the suggestion that the work to be done would take\r\nat least twelve months, and that therefore his appointment to the\r\n\"Fisguard\" should not be limited to any less period.] \"They might be\r\ndisposed,\" [wrote Huxley to him,] \"to cut anything I request down--on\r\nprinciple.\" [Moreover, Owen, Forbes, Bell, and Sharpey, all members of\r\nthe Committee of Recommendation of the Royal Society, had expressed\r\nthemselves so favourably to his views that in his application he was\r\nable to relieve the economic scruples of the Admiralty by telling them\r\nthat he had a means of publishing his papers through the Royal Society.\r\n\r\nThe result of his application, thus backed, was that he obtained his\r\nappointment on November 29. It was for six months, subject to extension\r\nif he were able to report satisfactory progress with his work.\r\n\r\nA long letter to his sister, now settled in Tennessee, gives a good idea\r\nof his aims and hopes at this time.]\r\n\r\n41 North Bank, Regent's Park.\r\n\r\nNovember 21, 1850.\r\n\r\nMy dearest Lizzie,\r\n\r\nWe have been at home now nearly three weeks, and I have been a free man\r\nagain twelve days. Her Majesty's ships have been paid off on the 9th of\r\nthis month. Properly speaking, indeed, we have been at home longer, for\r\nwe touched at Plymouth and trod English ground and saw English green\r\nfields on the 23rd of October, but we were allowed to remain only\r\ntwenty-four hours, and to my great disgust were ordered round to Chatham\r\nto be paid off. The ill-luck which had made our voyage homeward so long\r\n(we sailed from Sydney on the 2nd of May) pursued us in the Channel, and\r\nwe did not reach Chatham until the 2nd of November; and what do you\r\nthink was one of the first things I did when we reached Plymouth? Wrote\r\nto Eliza K. asking news of a certain naughty sister of mine, from whom I\r\nhad never heard a word since we had been away--and if perchance there\r\nshould be any letter, begging her to forward it immediately to Chatham.\r\nAnd so, when at length we got there, I found your kind long letter had\r\nbeen in England some six or seven months; but hearing of the likelihood\r\nof our return, they had very judiciously not sent it to me.\r\n\r\nYour letter, my poor Lizzie, justifies many a heartache I have had when\r\nthinking over your lot, knowing, as I well do, what emigrant life is in\r\nclimates less trying than that in which you live. I have seen a good\r\ndeal of bush life in Australia, and it enables me fully to sympathise\r\nwith and enter into every particular you tell me--from the baking and\r\nboiling and pigs squealing, down to that ferocious landshark Mrs.\r\nGunther, of whose class Australia will furnish fine specimens. Had I\r\nbeen at home, too, I could have enlightened the good folks as to the\r\nmeans of carriage in the colonies, and could have told them that the two\r\nor twenty thousand miles over sea is the smallest part of the difficulty\r\nand expense of getting anything to people living inland; as it is, I\r\nthink I have done some good in the matter; their meaning was good but\r\ntheir discretion small. But the obtuseness of English in general about\r\nanything out of the immediate circle of their own experience is\r\nsomething wonderful.\r\n\r\nI had heard here and there fractional accounts of your doings from Eliza\r\nK. and my mother--not of the most cheery description--and therefore I\r\nwas right glad to get your letter, which, though it tells of sorrow and\r\nmisfortune enough and to spare, yet shows me that the brave woman's\r\nheart you always had, my dearest Lizzie, is still yours, and that you\r\nhave always had the warm love of those immediately around you, and now,\r\nas the doctor's letter tells us, you have one more source of joy and\r\nhappiness, and this new joy must efface the bitterness--I do not say the\r\nmemory, knowing how impossible that would be--of your great loss. [The\r\ndeath of her little daughter Jessie]. God knows, my dear sister, I could\r\nfeel for you. It was as if I could see again a shadow of the great\r\nsorrow that fell upon us all years ago.\r\n\r\nNothing can bind me more closely to your children than I am already, but\r\nif the christening be not all over you must let me be godfather; and\r\nthough I fear I am too much of a heretic to promise to bring him up a\r\ngood son of the church--yet should ever the position which you prophesy,\r\nand of which I have an \"Ahnung\" (though I don't tell that to anybody but\r\nNettie), be mine, he shall (if you will trust him to me) be cared for as\r\nfew sons are. As things stand, I am talking half nonsense, but I mean\r\nit--and you know of old, for good and for evil, my tenacity of purpose.\r\n\r\nNow, as to my own affairs--I am not married. Prudently, at any rate, but\r\nwhether wisely or foolishly I am not quite sure yet, Nettie and I\r\nresolved to have nothing to do with matrimony for the present. In truth,\r\nthough our marriage was my great wish on many accounts, yet I feared to\r\nbring upon her the consequences that might have occurred had anything\r\nhappened to me within the next few years. We had a sad parting enough,\r\nand as is usually the case with me, time, instead of alleviating,\r\nrenders more disagreeable our separation. I have a woman's element in\r\nme. I hate the incessant struggle and toil to cut one another's throat\r\namong us men, and I long to be able to meet with some one in whom I can\r\nplace implicit confidence, whose judgment I can respect, and yet who\r\nwill not laugh at my most foolish weaknesses, and in whose love I can\r\nforget all care. All these conditions I have fulfilled in Nettie. With a\r\nstrong natural intelligence, and knowledge enough to understand and\r\nsympathise with my aims, with firmness of a man, when necessary, she\r\ncombines the gentleness of a very woman and the honest simplicity of a\r\nchild, and then she loves me well, as well as I love her, and you know I\r\nlove but few--in the real meaning of the word, perhaps, but two--she and\r\nyou. And now she is away, and you are away. The worst of it is I have no\r\nambition, except as means to an end, and that end is the possession of a\r\nsufficient income to marry upon. I assure you I would not give two\r\nstraws for all the honours and titles in the world. A worker I must\r\nalways be--it is my nature--but if I had 400 pounds sterling a year I\r\nwould never let my name appear to anything I did or shall ever do. It\r\nwould be glorious to be a voice working in secret and free from all\r\nthose personal motives that have actuated the best. But, unfortunately,\r\none is not a \"vox et praeterea nihil,\" but with a considerable\r\ncorporality attached which requires feeding, and so while my inner man\r\nis continually indulging in these anchorite reflections, the outer is\r\nsedulously elbowing and pushing as if he dreamed of nothing but gold\r\nmedals and professors' caps.\r\n\r\nI am getting on very well--better I fear than I deserve. One of my\r\npapers was published in 1849 in the \"Philosophical Transactions,\"\r\nanother in the \"Zoological Transactions,\" and some more may be published\r\nin the \"Linnean\" if I like--but I think I shall not like. Then I have\r\nworked pretty hard, and brought home a considerable amount of drawings\r\nand notes about new or rare animals, all particularly nasty slimy\r\nthings, and they will most likely be published as a separate work by the\r\nRoyal Society.\r\n\r\nOwens, Forbes, Bell, and Sharpey (the doctor will tell you of what\r\nweight these names are) are all members of the committee which disposes\r\nof the money, and are all strongly in favour of my \"valuable researches\"\r\n(cock-a-doodle-doo!!) being published by the Society. From various\r\ncircumstances I have taken a better position than I could have expected\r\namong these grandees, and I find them all immensely civil and ready to\r\nhelp me on, tooth and nail, particularly Professor Forbes, who is a\r\nright good fellow, and has taken a great deal of trouble on my behalf.\r\nOwen volunteered to write to the \"First Lord\" on my behalf, and did so.\r\nSharpey, when I saw him, reminded me, as he always does, of my great\r\ncontest with Stocks (do you remember throwing the shoe?), and promised\r\nme all the assistance in his power. Professor Bell, who is secretary to\r\nthe Royal, and has great influence, promised to help me in every way,\r\nand asked me to dine with him and meet a lot of nobs. I take all these\r\nthings quite as a matter of course, but am all the while considerably\r\nastonished. The other day I dined at the Geological Club and met Lyell,\r\nMurchison, de la B[eche] Horner, and a lot more, and last evening I\r\ndined with a whole lot of literary and scientific people.\r\n\r\nOwen was, in my estimation, great, from the fact of his smoking his\r\ncigar and singing his song like a brick.\r\n\r\nI tell you all these things to show you clearly how I stand. I am under\r\nno one's PATRONAGE, nor do I ever mean to be. I have never asked, and I\r\nnever will ask, any man for his help from mere motives of friendship. If\r\nany man thinks that I am capable of forwarding the great cause in ever\r\nso small a way, let him just give me a helping hand and I will thank\r\nhim, but if not, he is doing both himself and me harm in offering it,\r\nand if it should be necessary for me to find public expression to my\r\nthoughts on any matter, I have clearly made up my mind to do so, without\r\nallowing myself to be influenced by hope of gain or weight of authority.\r\n\r\nThere are many nice people in this world for whose praise or blame I\r\ncare not a whistle. I don't know and I don't care whether I shall ever\r\nbe what is called a great man. I will leave my mark somewhere, and it\r\nshall be clear and distinct:\r\n\r\nT.H.H., HIS MARK,\r\n\r\nand free from the abominable blur of cant, humbug, and self-seeking\r\nwhich surrounds everything in this present world--that is to say,\r\nsupposing that I am not already unconsciously tainted myself, a result\r\nof which I have a morbid dread. I am perhaps overrating myself. You must\r\nput me in mind of my better self, as you did in your last letter, when\r\nyou write.\r\n\r\nBut I must come to the close of my epistle, as I have one to enclose\r\nfrom my mother. My next shall be longer, and I hope I shall then be able\r\nto tell you what I am doing. At any rate I hope to be in England for\r\ntwelve months.\r\n\r\nI am very much ashamed of myself for not having written to you for so\r\nlong--open confession is good for the soul, they say, and I will\r\nhonestly confess that I was half puzzled, half piqued, and altogether\r\nsulky at your not having answered my last letter containing my love\r\nstory, of which I wrote you an account before anybody. You must not\r\nsuppose my affection was a bit the less because I was half angry.\r\nNettie, who knows you well, could tell you otherwise. Indeed, now that I\r\nknow all, I consider myself a great brute, and I will give you leave, if\r\nyou will but write soon, to scold me as much as you like. All the family\r\nare well. My father is the only one who is much altered, and that in\r\nmind and strength, not in bodily health, which is very good. My mother\r\nhas lost her front teeth, but is otherwise just the same amusing,\r\nnervous, distressingly active old lady she always was.\r\n\r\nOur cruisers visit New Orleans sometimes, and if ever I am on the West\r\nIndia station, who knows, I may take a run up to see you all. Kindest\r\nlove to the children. Tell Florry that I could not get her the bird with\r\nthe long tail, but that some day I will send her some pictures of\r\ncopper-coloured gentlemen with great big wigs and no trousers, and tell\r\nher her old uncle loves her very much and never forgets her nor anybody\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nGod bless you, dearest Lizzie. Write soon.\r\n\r\nEver your brother,\r\n\r\nTom.\r\n\r\n[Thus within a month of landing in England, Huxley had secured his\r\nfooting in the scientific world. He was freed for the time from the more\r\nirksome part of his profession; his service in the navy had become a\r\nstepping-stone to the pursuits in which his heart really was. He had\r\nlong been half in despair over the work which he had sent out like the\r\ndove from the ark, if haply it might find him some standing ground in\r\nthe world; no news of it had reached him till he was about to start on\r\nhis homeward voyage, but he returned to discover that at a single stroke\r\nit had placed him in the front rank of naturalists.]\r\n\r\n41 North Bank, Regent's Park.\r\n\r\nJanuary 3, 1851.\r\n\r\nMy progress [he writes (When not otherwise specified, the extracts in\r\nthis chapter are from letters to his future wife.)], must necessarily be\r\nslow and uncertain. I cannot see two steps forwards. Much depends upon\r\nmyself, much upon circumstances. Hitherto all has gone as well as I\r\ncould wish. I have gained each object that I had set before myself--that\r\nis, I have my shore appointment, I have found a means of publishing what\r\nI have done creditably, and I have continued to come into communication\r\nwith some of the first men in England in my department of science. But,\r\nas I have found to be the case in all things that are gained, from money\r\nto friendship, it is not so much getting as keeping. It is by no means\r\ndifficult if you are decently introduced, have tolerably agreeable\r\nmanners, and some smattering of science, to take a position among these\r\nfolks, but it is a mighty different affair to keep it and turn it to\r\naccount. Not like the man who, at the Enchanted Castle, had the courage\r\nto blow the horn but not to draw the sword, and was consequently shot\r\nforth from the mouth of the cave by which he entered with most\r\nignominious haste,--one must be ready to fight immediately after one's\r\narrival has been announced, or be blown into oblivion.\r\n\r\nI HAVE drawn the sword, but whether I am in truth to beat the giants and\r\ndeliver my princess from the enchanted castle is yet to be seen.\r\n\r\n[For several months he lived with his brother George and his wife at\r\nNorth Bank, St. John's Wood (the house was pulled down in 1896 for the\r\nGreat Central Railway), but the surroundings were too easy, and not\r\nconducive to hard work.]\r\n\r\nI must, I fear, emigrate to some \"two pair back,\" which shall have the\r\nfeel and manner of a workshop, where I can leave my books about and\r\ndissect a marine nastiness if I think fit, sallying forth to meet the\r\nworld when necessary, and giving it no more time than necessary.

The dirty holes\r\nthat some of these lodgings are! such tawdry finery and such servants,\r\nwith their faces and hands not merely dirty, but absolutely macadamised.\r\nAnd they all make this confounded great Exhibition a plea for about\r\ndoubling the rent.\r\n\r\n[So in April 1851 he removed to lodgings hard by, at 1 Hanover Place,\r\nClarence Gate, Regent's Park] (\"which sounds grand, but means nothing\r\nmore than a sitting-room and bedroom in a small house\"), [then to St.\r\nAnne's Gardens, and after that to Upper York Place, while making a\r\nsecond home with his brother. His other great friends already in London\r\nwere the Fannings, who had left Australia a few months before his own\r\nreturn. In the scientific world he soon made acquaintance with most of\r\nthe leading men, and began a close friendship with Edward Forbes, with\r\nGeorge Busk (then surgeon to H.M.S. \"Dreadnought\" at Greenwich,\r\nafterwards President of the College of Surgeons) and his accomplished\r\nwife, and later in the year with both Hooker and Tyndall. The Busks,\r\nindeed, showed him the greatest kindness throughout this period of\r\nstruggle, and the sympathy and intellectual stimulus he received from\r\ntheir society were of the utmost help. They were always ready to welcome\r\nhim at Greenwich, and he not only often ran down there for a week-end,\r\nbut would spend part of his vacations with them at Lowestoft or Tenby,\r\nwhere naturalists could find plenty of occupation.\r\n\r\nBut from a worldly point of view, it was too soon clear that science was\r\nsadly unprofitable. There seemed no speedy prospect of making enough to\r\nmarry on. As early as March 1851 he writes:--]\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of obtaining a decent position in England in anything\r\nlike a reasonable time seem to me greater than ever they were. To\r\nattempt to live by any scientific pursuit is a farce. Nothing but what\r\nis absolutely practical will go down in England. A man of science may\r\nearn great distinction, but not bread. He will get invitations to all\r\nsorts of dinners and conversaziones, but not enough income to pay his\r\ncab fare. A man of science in these times is like an Esau who sells his\r\nbirthright for a mess of pottage. Again, if one turns to practice, it is\r\nstill the old story--wait; and only after years of working like a\r\ngalley-slave and intriguing like a courtier is there any chance of\r\ngetting a decent livelihood. I am not at all sure if...it would be the\r\nmost prudent thing to stick by the Service: there at any rate is\r\ncertainty in health and in sickness.\r\n\r\n[Nevertheless he was mightily encouraged in the work of bringing out his\r\n\"Rattlesnake\" papers by a notable success in a quarter where he scarcely\r\ndared to hope for it. The Royal Society had for some time set itself to\r\nbecome a body of working men of science; to exclude for the future all\r\nmere dilettanti, and to admit a limited number of men whose work was\r\nsuch as to deserve recognition. Thanks to the initiative of Forbes, he\r\nnow found this recognition accorded to him on the strength of his\r\n\"Medusa\" paper. He writes in February:--]\r\n\r\nThe F.R.S. that you tell me you dream of being appended to my name is\r\nnearer than one might think, to my no small surprise...I had no idea\r\nthat it was at all within my reach, until I found out the other day,\r\ntalking with Mr. Bell, that my having a paper in the \"Transactions\" was\r\none of the best of qualifications.\r\n\r\nMy friend Forbes, to whom I am so much indebted, has taken the matter in\r\nhand for me, and I am told I am sure of getting it this year or the\r\nnext. I do not at all expect it this year, as there are a great many\r\ncandidates, far better men than I...I shall think myself lucky if I get\r\nit next year. Don't say anything about the matter till I tell you...As\r\nthe old proverb says, there is many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip.\r\n\r\n[There were thirty-eight candidates; of these the Council would select\r\nfifteen, and submit their names for election at a general meeting of the\r\nSociety. He was not yet twenty-six years of age, and certainly the\r\nyoungest and least known of the competitors. Others probably had been up\r\nbefore--possibly many times before; nevertheless, on this, his first\r\ncandidature, he was placed among the selected. The formal election did\r\nnot took place till June 5, but on a chance visit to Forbes he heard the\r\ngreat news. The F.R.S. was a formal attestation of the value of the work\r\nhe had already done; it was a token of success in the present, an augury\r\nof greater success in the future. No wonder the news was exciting.]\r\n\r\nTo-day [he writes on April 14] I saw Forbes at the Museum of Practical\r\nGeology, where I often drop in on him. \"Well,\" he said, \"I am glad to be\r\nable to tell you you are all right for the Royal Society; the selection\r\nwas made on Friday night, and I hear that you are one of the selected. I\r\nhave not seen the list, but my authority is so good that you may make\r\nyourself easy about it.\" I confess to having felt a little proud, though\r\nI believe I spoke and looked as cool as a cucumber. There were\r\nthirty-eight candidates, out of whom only fifteen could be selected, and\r\nI fear that they have left behind much better men than I. I shall not\r\nfeel certain about the matter until I receive some official\r\nannouncement. I almost wish that until then I had heard nothing about\r\nit. Notwithstanding all my cucumbery appearance, I will confess to you\r\nthat I could not sit down and read to-day after the news. I wandered\r\nhither and thither restlessly half over London...Whether I have it or\r\nnot, I can say one thing, that I have left my case to stand on its own\r\nstrength; I have not asked for a single vote, and there are not on my\r\ncertificate half the names that there might be. If it be mine, it is by\r\nno intrigue.\r\n\r\n[Again, on May 4, 1851]\r\n\r\nI am twenty-six to-day...and it reminds me that I have left you now a\r\nwhole year. It is perfectly frightful to think how the time is slipping\r\nby, and yet seems to bring us no nearer.\r\n\r\nWhat have I done with my twenty-sixth year? Six months were spent at\r\nsea, and therefore may be considered as so much lost; and six months I\r\nhave had in England. That, I may say, has not been thrown away\r\naltogether without fruit. I have read a good deal and I have written a\r\ngood deal. I have made some valuable friends, and have found my work\r\nmore highly estimated than I had ventured to hope. I must tell you\r\nsomething, because it will please you, even if you think me vain for\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\nI was talking to Professor Owen yesterday, and said that I imagined I\r\nhad to thank him in great measure for the honour of the F.R.S. \"No,\" he\r\nsaid, \"you have nothing to thank but the goodness of your own work.\" For\r\nabout ten minutes I felt rather proud of that speech, and shall keep it\r\nby me whenever I feel inclined to think myself a fool, and that I have a\r\nmost mistaken notion of my own capacities. The only use of honours is as\r\nan antidote to such fits of the \"blue devils.\" Of one thing, however,\r\nwhich is by no means so agreeable, my opportunities for seeing the\r\nscientific world in England force upon me every day a stronger and\r\nstronger conviction. It is that there is no chance of living by science.\r\nI have been loth to believe it, but it is so. There are not more than\r\nfour or five offices in London which a Zoologist or Comparative\r\nAnatomist can hold and live by. Owen, who has a European reputation,\r\nsecond only to that of Cuvier, gets as Hunterian Professor 300 pounds\r\nsterling a year! which is less than the salary of many a bank clerk. My\r\nfriend Forbes, who is a highly distinguished and a very able man, gets\r\nthe same from his office of Paleontologist to the Geological Survey of\r\nGreat Britain. Now, these are first-rate men--men who have been at work\r\nfor years laboriously toiling upward--men whose abilities, had they\r\nturned them into the many channels of money-making, must have made large\r\nfortunes. But the beauty of Nature and the pursuit of Truth allured them\r\ninto a nobler life--and this is the result...In literature a man may\r\nwrite for magazines and reviews, and so support himself; but not so in\r\nscience. I could get anything I write into any of the journals or any of\r\nthe Transactions, but I know no means of thereby earning five shillings.\r\nA man who chooses a life of science chooses not a life of poverty, but,\r\nso far as I can see, a life of NOTHING, and the art of living upon\r\nnothing at all has yet to be discovered. You will naturally think, then,\r\n\"Why persevere in so hopeless a course?\" At present I cannot help\r\nmyself. For my own credit, for the sake of gratifying those who have\r\nhitherto helped me on--nay, for the sake of truth and science itself, I\r\nmust work out fairly and fully complete what I have begun. And when that\r\nis done, I will courageously and cheerfully turn my back upon all my old\r\naspirations. The world is wide, and there is everywhere room for honesty\r\nof purpose and earnest endeavour. Had I failed in attaining my wishes\r\nfrom an overweening self-confidence,--had I found that the obstacles\r\nafter all lay within myself--I should have bitterly despised myself,\r\nand, worst of all, I should have felt that you had just ground of\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\nSo far as the acknowledgment of the value of what I have done is\r\nconcerned, I have succeeded beyond my expectations, and if I have failed\r\non the other side of the question, I cannot blame myself. It is the\r\nworld's fault and not mine.\r\n\r\n[A few months more, and he was able to report another and still more\r\nunexpected testimony to the value of his work--another encouragement to\r\npersevere in the difficult pursuit of a scientific life. He found\r\nhimself treated as an equal by men of established reputation; and the\r\nfirst-fruits of his work ranked on a level with the maturer efforts of\r\nveterans in science. He was within an ace of receiving the Royal Medal,\r\nwhich was awarded him the following year. Of this, he writes:--]\r\n\r\nNovember 7, 1851.\r\n\r\nI have at last tasted what it is to mingle with my fellows--to take my\r\nplace in that society for which nature has fitted me, and whether the\r\ndraught has been a poison which has heated my veins or true nectar from\r\nthe gods, life-giving, I know not, but I can no longer rest where I once\r\ncould have rested. If I could find within myself that mere personal\r\nambition, the desire of fame, present or posthumous, had anything to do\r\nwith this restlessness, I would root it out. But in those moments of\r\nself-questioning, when one does not lie even to oneself, I feel that I\r\ncan say it is not so--that the real pleasure, the true sphere, lies in\r\nthe feeling of self-development--in the sense of power and of growing\r\nONENESS with the great spirit of abstract truth.\r\n\r\nDo you understand this? I know you do; our old oneness of feeling will\r\nnot desert us here...\r\n\r\nTo-day a most unexpected occurrence came to my knowledge. I must tell\r\nyou that the Queen places at the disposal of the Royal Society once a\r\nyear a valuable gold medal to be given to the author of the best paper\r\nupon either a physical, chemical, or anatomical or physiological\r\nsubject. One of these branches of science is chosen by the Royal Society\r\nfor each year, and therefore for any given subject--say anatomy and\r\nphysiology; it becomes a triennial prize, and is given to the best\r\nmemoir in the \"Transactions\" for three years.\r\n\r\nIt happens that the Royal Medal, as it is called, is this year given in\r\nAnatomy and Physiology. I had no idea that I had the least chance of\r\ngetting it, and made no effort to do so. But I heard this morning from a\r\nmember of the Council that the award was made yesterday, and that I was\r\nwithin an ace of getting it. Newport, a man of high standing in the\r\nscientific world, and myself were the two between whom the choice\r\nrested, and eventually it was given to him, on account of his having a\r\ngreater bulk of matter in his papers, so evenly did the balance swing.\r\nHad I only had the least idea that I should be selected they should have\r\nhad enough and to spare from me. However, I do not grudge Newport his\r\nmedal; he is a good sort and a worthy competitor, old enough to be my\r\nfather, and has long had a high reputation. Except for its practical\r\nvalue as a means of getting a position I care little enough for the\r\nmedal. What I do care for is the justification which the being marked in\r\nthis position gives to the course I have taken. Obstinate and\r\nself-willed as I am...there are times when grave doubts overshadow my\r\nmind, and then such testimony as this restores my self-confidence.\r\n\r\nTo let you know the full force of what I have been saying, I must tell\r\nyou that this \"Royal Medal\" is what such men as Owen and Faraday are\r\nglad to get, and is indeed one of the highest honours in England.\r\n\r\nTo-day I had the great pleasure of meeting my old friend Sir John\r\nRichardson (to whom I was mainly indebted for my appointment in the\r\n\"Rattlesnake\"). Since I left England he has married a third wife, and\r\nhas taken a hand in joining in search of Franklin (which was more\r\ndreadful?), like an old hero as he is; but not a feather of him is\r\naltered, and he is as grey, as really kind, and as seemingly abrupt and\r\ngrim, as ever he was. Such a fine old polar bear!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.6.\r\n\r\n1851-1854.\r\n\r\n[The course pursued by the Government in the matter of Huxley's papers\r\nis curious and instructive. The Admiralty minute of 1849 had promised\r\neither money assistance for publishing or speedy promotion as an\r\nencouragement to scientific research in the Navy, especially by the\r\nmedical officers. On leave to publish the scientific results of the\r\nexpedition being asked for, the Department forestalled any request for\r\nmonetary aid by an intimation that none would be given. Strong\r\nrepresentations, however, from the leading scientific authorities\r\ninduced them to grant the appointment to the \"Fisguard\" for six months.\r\n\r\nThe sequel shows how the departmental representatives of science did\r\ntheir best for science in Huxley's case, so far as in their power\r\nlay:--]\r\n\r\nJune 6, 1851.\r\n\r\nThe other day I received an intimation that my presence was required at\r\nSomerset House. I rather expected the mandate, as six months' leave was\r\nup. Sir William was very civil, and told me that the Commander of the\r\n\"Fisguard\" had applied to the Admiralty to know what was to be done with\r\nme, as my leave had expired. \"Now,\" said he, \"go to Forest\" (his\r\nsecretary), \"write a letter to me, stating what you want, and I will get\r\nit done for you.\" So away I went and applied for an indefinite amount of\r\nleave, on condition of reporting the progress of my work every six\r\nmonths, and as I suppose I shall get it, I feel quite easy on that head.\r\n\r\n[In May 1851 he applied to the Royal Society for help from the\r\nGovernment Grant towards publishing the bulk of his work as a whole, for\r\nmuch of its value would be lost if scattered fragmentarily among the\r\nTransactions of various learned societies. Personally, the members of\r\nthe committee were very willing to make the grant, but on further\r\nconsideration it appeared that the money was to be applied for promoting\r\nresearch, not for assisting publication; and moreover, it was desirable\r\nnot to establish a precedent for saddling the funds at the disposal of\r\nthe Society with all the publications which it was the clear duty of the\r\nGovernment to undertake. On this ground the application was refused, but\r\nat the same time it was resolved that the Government be formally asked\r\nto give the necessary subvention towards bringing out these valuable\r\npapers.\r\n\r\nA similar resolution was passed at the Ipswich meeting of the British\r\nAssociation in July 1851, and at a meeting of its Council in March 1852\r\nthe President declared himself ready to carry it into effect by asking\r\nthe Treasury for the needful 300 pounds sterling. But at the July\r\nmeeting he could only report a non possumus answer for the current year\r\n(1852) from the Government, and a resolution was passed recommending\r\nthat application on the subject be renewed by the British Association in\r\nthe following year.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, weary of official delay, Huxley had conceived the idea of\r\nwriting direct to the Duke of Northumberland, then First Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty, whom he knew to take an interest in scientific research. At\r\nthe same time he stirred Lord Rosse, the President of the Royal Society,\r\nto repeat his application to the Treasury. Although the Admiralty in\r\nApril 1852 again refused money help, and bade him apply to the Royal\r\nSociety for a portion of the Government Grant (which the latter had\r\nalready refused him), the Hydrographer was directed to make inquiries as\r\nto the propriety of granting him an extension of leave. To his question\r\nasking the exact amount of time still required for finishing the work of\r\npublication, Huxley returned what he described as a \"savage reply,\" that\r\nhis experience of engravers led him to think that the plates could be\r\npublished in eight or nine months from the receipt of a grant; that he\r\nhad reason to believe this grant might soon be promised, but that the\r\nlong delay was solely due to the remissness of those whose duty it was\r\nto represent his claims to the Government; and finally, that he must ask\r\nfor a year's extension of leave.\r\n\r\nFor these expressions his conscience smote him when, on June 12, at a\r\nsoiree of the Royal Society, Lord Rosse took him aside and informed him\r\nthat he had seen Sir C. Trevelyan, the Under Secretary to the Treasury,\r\nwho said there would be no difficulty in the matter if it were properly\r\nlaid before the Prime Minister, Lord Derby. To Lord Derby therefore he\r\nwent, and was told that Mr. Huxley should go to the Treasury and arrange\r\nmatters in person with Trevelyan. At the same time the indignant tone of\r\nhis letter to the Hydrographer seemed to have done good; he was invited\r\nto explain matters in person, and was granted the leave he asked for.\r\n\r\nEverything now seemed to point to a speedy solution of his difficulties.\r\nThe promise of a grant, of course, did nothing immediate, but assured\r\nhim a good position, and settled all the scruples of the Admiralty with\r\nregard to time.] \"You have no notion,\" [he writes,]\" of the trouble the\r\ngrant has cost me. It died a natural death till I wrote to the Duke in\r\nMarch, and brought it to life again. The more opposition there is, the\r\nmore determined I am to carry it through.\" [But he was doomed to a worse\r\ndisappointment than before. Trevelyan received him very civilly, but had\r\nheard nothing on the matter from Lord Derby, and accordingly sent him in\r\ncharge of his private secretary to see Lord Derby's secretary. The\r\nlatter had seen no papers relating to any such matter, and supposed Lord\r\nDerby had not brought them from St. James' Square, \"but promised to\r\nwrite to me as soon as anything was learnt. I look upon it as adjourned\r\nsine die.\" Parliament breaking up immediately after gave the officials a\r\ngood excuse for doing nothing more.\r\n\r\nWhen his year's leave expired in June 1853, he wrote the following\r\nletter to Sir William Burnett:--]\r\n\r\nAs the period of my leave of absence from H.M.S. \"Fisguard\" is about to\r\nexpire, I have the honour to report that the duty on which I have been\r\nengaged has been carried out, as far as my means permit, by the\r\npublication of a \"Memoir upon the Homologies of the Cephalous Mollusca,\"\r\nwith four plates, which appeared in the \"Philosophical Transactions\" for\r\n1852 (published 1853), being the fourth memoir resulting from the\r\nobservations made during the voyage of H.M.S. \"Rattlesnake\" which has\r\nappeared in these \"Transactions.\"\r\n\r\nI have the pleasure of being able to add that the President and Council\r\nof the Royal Society have considered these memoirs worthy of being\r\nrewarded by the Royal Medal in Physiology for 1852, which they did me\r\nthe honour to confer in the November of that year.\r\n\r\nI regret that no definite answer of any kind having as yet been given to\r\nthe strong representations which were made by the Presidents both of the\r\nRoyal Society and of the British Association in 1852 to H.M.\r\nGovernment--representations which have recently been earnestly\r\nrepeated--in order to obtain a grant for the purpose of publishing the\r\nremainder of these researches in a separate form, I have been unable to\r\nproceed any further, and I beg to request a renewal of my leave of\r\nabsence from H.M.S. \"Fisguard,\" so that if H.M. Government think fit to\r\ngive the grant applied for, it may be in my power to make use of it; or\r\nthat, should it be denied, I may be enabled to find some other means of\r\npreventing the total loss of the labour of some years.\r\n\r\n[Hereupon he was allowed six months longer, but with the intimation that\r\nno further leave would be granted. A final application from the\r\nscientific authorities resulted in fresh inquiries as to the length of\r\ntime still required, and the deadlock between the two departments of\r\nState being unchanged, he replied to the same effect as before, but to\r\nno purpose. His formal application for leave in January 1854 was met by\r\norders to join the \"Illustrious\" at Portsmouth. He appealed to the\r\nAdmiralty that this appointment might be cancelled, giving a brief\r\nsummary of the facts, and pointing out that it was the inaction of the\r\nTreasury which had absolutely prevented him from completing his work.]\r\n\r\nI would therefore respectfully submit that, under these circumstances,\r\nmy request to be permitted to remain on half-pay until the completion of\r\nthe publication of the results of some years' toil is not wholly\r\nunreasonable. It is the only reward for which I would ask their\r\nLordships, and indeed, considering the distinct pledge given in the\r\nminute to which I have referred, to grant it would seem as nearly to\r\nconcern their Lordships' honour as my advantage.\r\n\r\n[The counter to this bold stroke was crushing, if not convincing. He was\r\nordered to join his ship immediately under pain of being struck off the\r\nNavy list. He was of course prepared for this ultimatum, and whether he\r\ncould manage to pursue science in England or might be compelled to set\r\nup as a doctor in Sydney, he considered that he would be better off than\r\nas an assistant surgeon in the Navy. Accordingly he stood firm, and the\r\nthreat was carried into effect in March 1854. An unexpected consequence\r\nfollowed. As long as he was in the navy, with direct claims upon a\r\nGovernment department for assistance in publishing his work, the Royal\r\nSociety had not felt justified in allotting him any part of the\r\nGovernment Grant. But now that he had left the service, this objection\r\nwas removed, and in June 1854 the sum of 300 pounds sterling was\r\nassigned for this purpose, while the remainder of the expense was borne\r\nby the Ray Society, which undertook the publication under the title of\r\n\"Oceanic Hydrozoa.\" Thus he was able to record with some satisfaction\r\nhow he at last has got the grant, though indirectly, from the\r\nGovernment, and considers it something of a triumph for the principle of\r\nthe family motto, tenax propositi.\r\n\r\nWhile these fruitless negotiations with the Admiralty were in progress,\r\nhe had done a good deal, both in publishing what he could of his\r\n\"Rattlesnake\" work, and in trying to secure some scientific appointment\r\nwhich would enable him to carry out his two chief objects: the one his\r\nmarriage, the other the unhampered pursuit of science. In addition to\r\nthe papers sent home from the cruise--one on the Medusae, published in\r\nthe \"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\" for 1849, and one\r\non the Animal of Trigonia, published in the \"Proceedings of the\r\nZoological Society\" for the same year--he had reported to the Admiralty\r\nin June 1851 the publication of seven memoirs:--\r\n\r\n1. On the Auditory Organs of the Crustacea. Published in the \"Annals of\r\nNatural History.\"\r\n\r\n2. On the Anatomy of the genus Tethea. Published in the \"Annals of\r\nNatural History.\"\r\n\r\n3. Report upon the Development of the Echinoderms. To appear in the\r\n\"Annals\" for July.\r\n\r\n4. On the Anatomy and Physiology of the Salpae, with four plates. Read\r\nat the Royal Society, and to be published in the next part of the\r\n\"Philosophical Transactions.\"\r\n\r\n5. On two Genera of Ascidians, Doliolum and Appendicularia, with one\r\nplate. Read at the Royal Society, and to be published in the next part\r\nof the \"Philosophical Transactions.\"\r\n\r\n6. On some peculiarities in the Circulation of the Mollusca. Sent to M.\r\nMilne-Edwards, at his request, to be published in the \"Annales des\r\nSciences.\"\r\n\r\n7. On the Generative Organs of the Physophoridae and Diphydae. Sent to\r\nProfessor Muller of Berlin for publication in his \"Archiv.\"\r\n\r\nBy the end of the year he had four more to report:--\r\n\r\n1. On the Hydrostatic Acalephae; 2. On the genus Sagitta, both published\r\nin the \"Report of the British Association\" for 1851; 3. On Lacinularia\r\nsocialis, a contribution to the anatomy and physiology of the Rotifera,\r\nin the \"Transactions of the Microscopical Society\" 4. On Thalassicolla,\r\na new zoophyte, in the \"Annals of Natural History.\" Next year he read\r\nbefore the British Association a paper entitled \"Researches into the\r\nStructure of the Ascidians,\" and a very important one on the Morphology\r\nof the Cephalous Mollusca, afterwards published in the \"Philosophical\r\nTransactions.\" In addition he had prepared a great part of his longer\r\nwork for publication; out of twenty-four or twenty-five plates, nineteen\r\nwere ready for the engraver when he wrote his appeal to the Duke of\r\nNorthumberland. In this same year, 1852, he was also awarded the Royal\r\nMedal in Physiology for the value of his contributions to the\r\n\"Philosophical Transactions.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1853, besides seeing some of these papers through the press, he\r\npublished one on the existence of Cellulose in the Tunic of Ascidians,\r\nread before the Microscopical Society, and two papers on the Structure\r\nof the Teeth; the latter, of course, like a paper of the previous year\r\non Echinococcus, being distinct from the \"Rattlesnake\" work. The greater\r\nwork on Oceanic Hydrozoa, over which the battle of the grant in aid had\r\nbeen waged so long, did not see the light until 1858, when his interest\r\nhad been diverted from these subjects, and to return to them was more a\r\nburden than a pleasure.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the years 1851-53, so full of profitless successes\r\nin pure science, and delusive hopes held out by the Government, were\r\nmarked by an equally unsuccessful series of attempts to obtain a\r\nprofessorship. If a chair of Natural History had been established, as he\r\nhoped, in the projected university at Sydney, he would gladly have stood\r\nfor it. Sydney was a second home to him; he would have been backed by\r\nthe great influence of Macleay; and in his eyes a naturalist could not\r\ndesire a finer field for his labours than the waters of Port Jackson.\r\nBut this was not to be, and the first chair he tried for was the\r\nnewly-instituted chair of Zoology at the University of Toronto. The\r\nvacancy was advertised in the summer of 1851; the pay of full 300 pounds\r\nsterling a year was enough to marry on; his friends reassured him as to\r\nhis capacity to fill the post, which, moreover, did not debar him from\r\nthe hope of returning some day to fill a similar post in England.]\r\n\r\n1 Edward Street, St. John's Wood Terrace,\r\n\r\nJuly 29 [1851].\r\n\r\nMy dear Henfrey,\r\n\r\nI have been detained in town, or I hope we should long since have had\r\nour projected excursion.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of my looking out for a Professorship of Natural\r\nHistory at Toronto? Pay 350 pounds sterling, with chances of extra fees.\r\nI think that out there one might live comfortably upon that\r\nsum--possibly even do the domestic and cultivate the Loves and Graces as\r\nwell as the Muses.\r\n\r\nSeriously, however, I should like to know what you think of it. The\r\nchoice of getting anything over here without devoting one's self wholly\r\nto Mammon, seems to me very small. At least it involves years of\r\nwaiting.\r\n\r\nToronto is not very much out of the way, and the pay is decent and would\r\nenable me to devote myself wholly to my favourite pursuits. Were it in\r\nEngland, I could wish nothing better; and, as it is, I think it would\r\nanswer my purpose very well for some years at any rate.\r\n\r\nIf they go fairly to work I think I shall have a very good chance of\r\nbeing elected; but I am told that these matters are often determined by\r\npetty intrigues.\r\n\r\nFrancis and I looked for you everywhere at the Botanic Gardens, and\r\nfinding you were too wise to come, came here, grieving your absence, and\r\nhad an aesthetic \"Bier.\" [(Dr. William Francis, one of the editors of\r\nthe \"Philosophical Magazine,\" and a member of the publishing firm of\r\nTaylor and Francis.)\r\n\r\nHe obtained a remarkably strong set of testimonials from all the leading\r\nanatomists and physiologists in the kingdom, as well as one from\r\nMilne-Edwards in Paris.\r\n\r\nI have put together [he writes] twelve or fourteen testimonials from the\r\nfirst men. I will have no other.\r\n\r\n[His newly-obtained F.R.S. was a recommendation in itself. So that he\r\nwrites:--]\r\n\r\nThere are, I learn, several other candidates, but no one I fear at all,\r\nif they only have fair play. There is no one of the others who can\r\ncommand anything like the scientific influence which is being exercised\r\nfor me, whatever private influence they may have.\r\n\r\nWhat makes all the big-wigs so marvellously zealous on my behalf I know\r\nnot. I have sought none of them and flattered none of them, that I can\r\nsay with a good conscience, and I think you know me well enough to\r\nbelieve it. I feel very grateful to them; and if it ever happens that I\r\nam able to help a young man on (when I am a big-wig myself!) I shall\r\nremember it.\r\n\r\n[And again, September 23, 1851:--]\r\n\r\nWhen I have once sent away my testimonials and done all that is to be\r\ndone, I shall banish the subject from my mind and make myself quite easy\r\nas to results. For the present I confess to being somewhat anxious.\r\n\r\n[Nevertheless, after many postponements, a near relative of an\r\ninfluential Canadian politician was at length appointed late in 1853. By\r\nan amusing coincidence, Huxley's newly-made friend, Tyndall, was\r\nlikewise a candidate for a chair at Toronto, and likewise rejected. Two\r\nletters, concerning Tyndall's election to the Royal Society, contain\r\nreferences both to Toronto and to Sydney.]\r\n\r\n4 Upper York Place, St. John's Wood\r\n\r\nDecember 4 [1851].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI was greatly rejoiced to find I could be of service to you in any way,\r\nand I only regret, for your sake, that my name is not a more weighty\r\none. Your election, I should think, can be a matter of no doubt.\r\n\r\nAs to Toronto, I confess I am not very anxious about it. Sydney would\r\nhave been far more to my taste, and I confess I envy you what, as I\r\nhear, is the very good chance you have of going there.\r\n\r\nIt used to be our headquarters in the \"Rattlesnake\" and my home for\r\nthree months in the year. Should you go, I should be very happy, if you\r\nlike, to give you letters to some of my friends.\r\n\r\nGreatly as I wish we had been destined to do our work together, I cannot\r\nbut offer you the most hearty wishes for your success in Sydney.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nThomas H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nJohn Tyndall, Esq.\r\n\r\n41 North Bank, Regent's Park,\r\n\r\nMay 7, 1852.\r\n\r\nMy dear Tyndall,\r\n\r\nAllow me to be one of the first to have the pleasure of congratulating\r\nyou on your new honours. I had the satisfaction last night to hear your\r\nname read out as one of the selected of the Council of the Royal Society\r\nfor election to the Fellowship this year, and you are therefore as good\r\nas elected.\r\n\r\nI always made sure of your success, but I am not the less pleased that\r\nit is now a fait accompli.\r\n\r\nI am, my dear Tyndall, faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have heard nothing of Toronto, and I begin to think that the\r\nwhole affair, University and all, is a myth.\r\n\r\n[His hopes of the Colonies failing, he tried each of the divisions of\r\nthe United Kingdom in turn, with uniform ill-success; in 1852-53 at\r\nAberdeen and at Cork; in 1853 at King's College, London. He had great\r\nhopes of Aberdeen at first; the appointment lay with the Home Secretary,\r\na personal friend of Sir J. Clark, who was interested in Huxley though\r\nnot personally acquainted with him. But no sooner had he written to urge\r\nthe latter's claims than a change of ministry took place, and other\r\ninfluences commanded the field. It was cold comfort that Clark told him\r\nonly to wait--something must turn up. There was still a great\r\nprobability of the Toronto chair falling to a Cork professor; so with\r\nthis in view, he gave up a trip to Chamounix with his brother, and\r\nattended the meeting of the British Association at Belfast in August\r\n1852, in order to make himself known to the Irish men of science, for,\r\nas his friends told him, personal influence went for so much, and while\r\nmost men's reputations were better than themselves, he might flatter\r\nhimself that he was better than his reputation. But this, too, came to\r\nnothing, and the King's College appointment also went to the candidate\r\nwho was backed by the most powerful influence.\r\n\r\nA fatality seemed to dog his efforts; nevertheless he writes at the end\r\nof 1851:--]\r\n\r\nAmong my scientific friends the monition I get on all sides is that of\r\nDante's great ancestor to him--\r\n\r\nA te sequi la tua stella.\r\n\r\nIf this were from personal friends only, I should disregard it; but it\r\ncomes from men to whose approbation it would be foolish affectation to\r\ndeny the highest value. I find myself treated on a footing of equality\r\n(\"my proud self,\" as you may suppose, would not put up with any other)\r\nby men whose names and works have been long before the world. My\r\nopinions are treated with a respect altogether unaccountable to me, and\r\nwhat I have done is quoted as having full authority. Without canvassing\r\na soul or making use of any influence, I have been elected into the\r\nRoyal Society at a time when that election is more difficult than it has\r\never been in the history of the Society. Without my knowledge I was\r\nwithin an ace of getting the Royal Society medal this year, and if I go\r\non I shall very probably get it next time.\r\n\r\n[In 1852 he was not only to receive this coveted honour (See Chapter\r\n7.), but also to be elected upon the Royal Society Council. In January\r\n1852, when standing for Toronto, he describes how Colonel Sabine, then\r\nSecretary of the Royal Society, dissuaded him from the project, saying\r\nthat a brilliant prospect lay before him if he would only wait.]\r\n\r\n\"Make up your mind to get something fairly within your reach, and you\r\nwill have us all with you.\" Professor Owen again offers to do anything\r\nin his power for me; Professor Forbes will move heaven and earth for me\r\nif he can; Gray, Bell, and all the leading men are, I know, similarly\r\ninclined. Fate says wait, and you shall reach the goal which from a\r\nchild you have set before yourself. On the other hand, a small voice\r\nlike conscience speaks of one who is wasting youth and life away for\r\nyour sake.\r\n\r\n[Other friends, who, while recognising his general capacities, were not\r\nscientific, and had no direct appreciation of his superlative powers in\r\nscience, thought he was following a course which would never allow him\r\nto marry, and urged him to give up his unequal battle with fate, and\r\nemigrate to Australia. Of this he writes on August 5, 1852, to Miss\r\nHeathorn:--]\r\n\r\nI must make up my mind to it if nothing turns up. However, I look upon\r\nsuch a life as would await me in Australia with great misgiving. A life\r\nspent in a routine employment, with no excitement and no occupation for\r\nthe higher powers of the intellect, with its great aspirations stifled\r\nand all the great problems of existence set hopelessly in the\r\nbackground, offers to me a prospect that would be utterly intolerable\r\nbut for your love...Sometimes I am half mad with the notion of bringing\r\nall my powers in a surer struggle for a livelihood. Sometimes I am\r\nequally wild at thinking of the long weary while that has passed since\r\nwe met. There are times when I cannot bear to think of leaving my\r\npresent pursuits, when I feel I should be guilty of a piece of cowardly\r\ndesertion from my duty in doing it, and there come intervals when I\r\nwould give truth and science and all hopes to be folded in your arms...I\r\nknow which course is right, but I never know which I may follow; help\r\nme...for there is only one course in which there is either hope or peace\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\n[These repeated disappointments deepened the fits of depression which\r\nconstantly assailed him. He was torn by two opposing thoughts. Was it\r\njust, was it right, to demand so great a sacrifice from the woman who\r\nhad entrusted her future to the uncertain chances of his fortunes? Could\r\nhe ask her to go on offering up the best years of her life to\r\naspirations of his which were possibly chimerical, or perhaps merely\r\nselfishness in disguise, which ought to yield to more imperative duties?\r\nWhy not clip the wings of Pegasus, and descend to the sober, everyday\r\njog-trot after plain bread and cheese like other plain people? Time\r\nafter time he almost made up his mind to throw science to the winds; to\r\nemigrate and establish a practice in Sydney; to try even squatting or\r\nstorekeeping. And yet he knew only too well that with his temperament no\r\nlife would bring him the remotest approach to lasting happiness and\r\nsatisfaction except one that gave scope to his intellectual passion. To\r\nyield to the immediate pressure of circumstances was perhaps ignoble,\r\nwas even more probably a surer road to the loss of happiness for himself\r\nand for his wife than the repeated and painful sacrifices of the\r\npresent. With all this, however, and the more when assured of her entire\r\nconfidence in his judgment, he could not but feel a sense of remorse\r\nthat she willingly accepted the sacrifice, and feared that she might\r\nhave done so rather to gratify his wishes than because reason approved\r\nit as the right course to follow.\r\n\r\nHere is another typical extract from his correspondence. Hearing that\r\nToronto is likely to go to a relative of a Canadian minister, he writes,\r\nJanuary 2, 1852:--]\r\n\r\nI think of all my dreams and aspirations, and of the path which I know\r\nlies before me if I can only bide my time, and it seems a sin and a\r\nshameful thing to allow my resolve to be turned; and then comes the\r\nmocking suspicion, is this fine abstract duty of yours anything but a\r\nsubtlety of your own selfishness? Have you not other more imperative\r\nduties?\r\n\r\nYou may fancy whether my life is a very happy one thus spent without\r\neven the satisfaction of the sense of right-doing. I must come to some\r\nresolution about it, and that shortly. I was talking seriously with\r\nFanning the other night about the possibility of finding some employment\r\nof a profitable kind in Australia, storekeeping, squatting, or the like.\r\nAs I told him, any change in my mode of life must be TOTAL. If I am to\r\nchange at all, the change must be total and complete. I will not attempt\r\nmy own profession. I should only be led astray to think and to work as\r\nof old, and sigh continually for my old dear and intoxicating pursuits.\r\nI wish I understood Brewing, and I would make a proposition to come and\r\nhelp your father. You may smile, but I am as serious as ever I was in my\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n[The distance between them made it doubly difficult to keep in touch\r\nwith one another, when the post took from four and a half to five or\r\neven six months to reach England from Australia. The answer to a letter\r\nwould come when the matter in question was long done with. The assurance\r\nthat he was doing right at one moment seemed inadequate when\r\ncircumstances had altered and hope sunk lower. It was all too easy to\r\nsuspect that she did not understand his aims, his thirst for action, nor\r\nthe fact that he was no longer free to do as he liked, whether to stay\r\nin the navy, to go into practice, or follow his own pursuits and\r\npleasure. Yet it made him despair to be so hedged in by circumstances.\r\nWith all his efforts, he seemed as though he had done nothing but earn\r\nthe reputation of being a very promising young man. How much easier to\r\ncontinue the struggle if he could but have seen her face to face, and\r\nread her thoughts as to whether he were right or wrong in the course he\r\nwas pursuing. He appeals to her faith that he is choosing the nobler\r\npath in pursuing knowledge, than in turning aside to the temptation of\r\nthrowing it up for the sake of their speedier union. Still she was right\r\nin claiming a share in his work; but for her his life would have been\r\nwasted.\r\n\r\nThe clouds gathered very thickly about him when in April 1852 his mother\r\ndied, while his father was hopelessly ill.] \"Belief and happiness,\" [he\r\nwrites,] \"seem to be beyond the reach of thinking men in these days, but\r\ncourage and silence are left.\" [Again the clouds lifted, for in October\r\nhe received Miss Heathorn's] \"noble and self-sacrificing letter, which\r\nhas given me more comfort than anything for a long while,\" [the keynote\r\nof which was that a man should pursue those things for which he is most\r\nfitted, let them be what they will. He now felt free to tell the\r\nvicissitudes of thought and will he had passed through this twelvemonth,\r\nand how the idea of giving up all had affected him.] \"The spectre of a\r\nwasted life has passed before me--a vision of that servant who hid his\r\ntalent in a napkin and buried it.\"\r\n\r\n[Early in 1853 he writes how much he was cheered by his sister's advice\r\nand encouragement to persist in the struggle; but the darkest moment was\r\nstill to come. His hopes from his candidature crumbled away one after\r\nthe other; his leave from the Admiralty was coming to an end, and there\r\nwas small hope of renewing it; the grant from Government remained as\r\nunattainable as ever; the long struggle had taught him the full extent\r\nof his powers only, it seemed, to end by denying him all opportunity for\r\ntheir use.]\r\n\r\nAnd so the card house I have been so laboriously building up these two\r\nyears with all manner of hard struggling will be tumbled down again, and\r\nmy small light will be ignominiously snuffed out like that of better\r\nmen...I can submit if the fates are too strong. The world is no better\r\nthan an arena of gladiators, and I, a stray savage, have been turned\r\ninto it to fight my way with my rude club among the steel-clad fighters.\r\nWell, I have won my way into the front rank, and ought to be thankful\r\nand deem it only the natural order of things if I can get no further.\r\n\r\n[And again in a letter of July 6, 1853:--]\r\n\r\nI know that these three years have inconceivably altered me--that from\r\nbeing an idle man, only too happy to flow into the humours of the\r\nmoment, I have become almost unable to exist without active intellectual\r\nexcitement. I know that in this I find peace and rest such as I can\r\nattain in no other way. From being a mere untried fledgling, doubtful\r\nwhether the wish to fly proceeded from mere presumption or from budding\r\nwings, I have now some confidence in well-tried pinions, which have\r\ngiven me rank among the strongest and foremost. I have always felt how\r\ndifficult it was for you to realise all this--how strange it must be to\r\nyou that though your image remained as bright as ever, new interests and\r\npurposes had ranged themselves around it, and though they could claim no\r\npre-eminence, yet demanded their share of my thoughts. I make no apology\r\nfor this--it is man's nature and the necessary influence of\r\ncircumstances which will so have it; and depend, however painful our\r\npresent separation may be, the spectacle of a man who had given up the\r\ncherished purpose of his life, the Esau who had sold his birthright for\r\na mess of pottage and with it his self-respect, would before long years\r\nwere over our heads be infinitely more painful. Depend upon it, the\r\ntrust which you placed in my hands when I left you--to choose for both\r\nof us--has not been abused. Hemmed in by all sorts of difficulties, my\r\nchoice was a narrow one, and I was guided more by circumstances than my\r\nown free will. Nevertheless the path has shown itself to be a fair one,\r\nneither more difficult nor less so than most paths in life in which a\r\nman of energy may hope to do much if he believes in himself, and is at\r\npeace within.\r\n\r\nMy course in life is taken. I will NOT leave London--I WILL make myself\r\na name and a position as well as an income by some kind of pursuit\r\nconnected with science, which is the thing for which nature has fitted\r\nme if she has ever fitted any one for anything. Bethink yourself whether\r\nyou can cast aside all repining and all doubt, and devote yourself in\r\npatience and trust to helping me along my path as no one else could. I\r\nknow what I ask, and the sacrifice I demand, and if this were the time\r\nto use false modesty, I should say how little I have to offer in\r\nreturn...\r\n\r\nI am full of faults, but I am real and true, and the whole devotion of\r\nan earnest soul cannot be overprized.\r\n\r\n...It is as if all that old life at Holmwood had merely been a\r\npreparation for the real life of our love--as if we were then children\r\nignorant of life's real purpose--as if these last months had merely been\r\nmy old doubts over again, whether I had rightly or wrongly interpreted\r\nthe manner and the words that had given me hope...\r\n\r\nWe will begin the new love of woman and man, no longer that of boy and\r\ngirl, conscious that we have aims and purposes as well as affections,\r\nand that if love is sweet life is dreadfully stern and earnest.\r\n\r\n[As time went on and no permanency offered--although a good deal of\r\nwriting fell in his way--the strain told heavily upon him. In the autumn\r\nhe was quite out of sorts, body and mind, more at war with himself than\r\nhe ever was in his life before. All this, he writes, had darkened his\r\nthoughts, had made him once more imagine a hopeless discrepancy between\r\nthe two of them in their ways of thinking and objects in life. It was\r\nnot till November 1853 that this depression was banished by the trust\r\nand confidence of her last letter.] \"I wish to Heaven,\" [he writes,] \"it\r\nhad reached me six months ago. It would have saved me a world of pain\r\nand error.\" [But with this, the worst period of mental suffering was\r\nover, and every haunting doubt was finally exorcised. His career was\r\nmade possible by the steady faith which neither separation nor any\r\nmisgiving nor its own troubles could shake. And from this point all\r\nthings began to brighten. His health had been restored by a trip to the\r\nPyrenees with his brother George in September. He had got work that\r\nenabled him to regard the Admiralty and its menaces with complete\r\nequanimity; a \"Manual of Comparative Anatomy,\" for Churchhill the\r\npublisher, regular work on the \"Westminster,\" and another book in\r\nprospect,] \"so that if I quit the Service to-morrow, these will give me\r\nmore than my pay has been.\" [(This regular work was the article on\r\nContemporary Science, which in October 1854 he got Tyndall to share with\r\nhim. For, he writes,] \"To give some account of the books in one's own\r\ndepartment is no particular trouble, and comes with me under the head of\r\nbeing paid for what I MUST, in any case, do--but I neither will, nor\r\ncan, go on writing about books in other departments, of which I am not\r\ncompetent to form a judgment even if I had the time to give to them.\")\r\n[And on December 7 he writes how he has been restored and revived by\r\nreading over her last two letters, and confesses,] \"I have been unjust\r\nto the depth and strength of your devotion, but will never do so again.\"\r\n[Then he tells all he had gone through before leaving England in\r\nSeptember for his holiday--how he had resolved to abandon all his\r\nspecial pursuits and take up Chemistry, for practical purposes, when\r\nfirst one publisher and then another asked him to write for them, and\r\nhopes were held out to him of being appointed to deliver the Fullerian\r\nlectures at the Royal Institution for the next three years; while, most\r\nimportant of all, Edward Forbes was likely before long, to leave his\r\npost at the Museum of Practical Geology, and he had already been spoken\r\nto by the authorities about filling it. This was worth some 200 pounds\r\nsterling a year, while he calculated to make about 250 pounds sterling\r\nby his pen alone.] \"Therefore it would be absurd to go hunting for\r\nchemical birds in the bush when I have such in the hand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.7.\r\n\r\n1851-1853.\r\n\r\n[Several letters dating from 1851 to 1853 help to fill up the outlines\r\nof Huxley's life during those three years of struggle. There is a\r\ndescription of the British Association meeting at Ipswich in 1851]\r\n(\"Forbes advises me to go down to the meeting of the British Association\r\nthis year and make myself notorious somehow or other. Thank Heaven I\r\nhave impudence enough to lecture the savans of Europe if necessary. Can\r\nyou imagine me holding forth?\" [June 6, 1851.]), with the traditional\r\ntouch of gaiety to enliven the gravity of its proceedings, and the\r\nunconventional jollity of the Red Lion Club (a dining-club of members of\r\nthe Association), whose palmy days were those under the inspiration of\r\nthe genial and gifted Forbes. This was the meeting at which Huxley first\r\nbegan his alliance with Tyndall, with whom he travelled down from town,\r\nalthough he does not mention his name in this letter. With Hooker he had\r\nalready made acquaintance; and from this time forwards the three were\r\nclosely bound together by personal regard as well as by similarity of\r\naims and interests.\r\n\r\nThen follow his sketch of the English scientific world as he found it in\r\n1851, given in his letter to W. Macleay; several letters to his sister;\r\nthe description of his first lecture at the Royal Institution, which,\r\nthough successful on the whole, was very different in manner and\r\ndelivery from the clear and even flow of his later style, with the voice\r\nnot loud but distinct, the utterance never hurried beyond the point of\r\nimmediate comprehension, but carrying the attention of the audience with\r\nit, eager to the end. Two letters of warning and remonstrance against\r\nthe habits of lecturing in a colloquial tone, suitable to a knot of\r\nstudents gathered round his table, but not to a large audience--of\r\nrunning his words, especially technical terms, together--of pouring out\r\nnew and unfamiliar matter at breakneck speed, were addressed to him--one\r\nby a \"working man\" of his Monday evening audience at Jermyn Street in\r\n1855, the other, undated, by Mr. Jodrell, a frequenter of the Royal\r\nInstitution, and afterwards founder of the Jodrell Lectureships at\r\nUniversity College, London, and other benefactions to science, and these\r\nhe kept by him as a perpetual reminder, labelled \"Good Advice.\" How much\r\ncan be done by the frank acceptance of criticism and by careful practice\r\nis shown by the difference between the feelings of the later audiences\r\nwho flocked to his lectures, and those of the members of an Institute in\r\nSt. John's Wood, who, as he often used to tell, after hearing him in his\r\nearly days, petitioned \"not to have that young man again.\"]\r\n\r\nJuly 12, 1851.\r\n\r\nThe interval between my letters has been a little longer than usual, as\r\nI have been very busy attending the meeting of the British Association\r\nat Ipswich. The last time I attended one was at Southampton five years\r\nago, when I went merely as a spectator, and looked at the people who\r\nread papers as if they were somebodies. (See Chapter 2, ad fin.) This\r\ntime I have been behind the scenes myself and have played out my little\r\npart on the boards. I know all about the scenery and decorations, and no\r\nlonger think the manager a wizard.\r\n\r\nAny one who conceives that I went down from any especial interest in the\r\nprogress of science makes a great mistake. My journey was altogether a\r\nmatter of policy, partly for the purpose of doing a little necessary\r\ntrumpeting, and partly to get the assistance of the Association in\r\ninfluencing the Government.\r\n\r\nOn the journey down, my opposite in the railway carriage turned out to\r\nbe Sir James Ross, the Antarctic discoverer. We had some very pleasant\r\ntalk together. I knew all about him, as Dayman (one of the lieutenants\r\nof the \"Rattlesnake\") had sailed under his command; oddly enough we\r\nafterwards went to lodge at the same house, but as we were attending our\r\nrespective sections all day we did not see much of one another.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at Ipswich there was a good deal of trouble about\r\ngetting lodgings. My companions located themselves about a mile out of\r\nthe town, but that was too far for my \"indolent habits\"; I sought and at\r\nlast found a room in the town a little bigger than my cabin on board\r\nship for which I had the satisfaction of paying 30 shillings a week.\r\n\r\nYou know what the British Association is. It is a meeting of the savans\r\nof England and the Continent, under the presidency of some big-wig or\r\nother,--this year of the Astronomer-Royal,--for the purpose of\r\nexchanging information. To this end they arrange themselves into\r\ndifferent sections, each with its own president and committee, and\r\nindicated by letters. For instance, Section A is for Mathematics and\r\nPhysics; Section B for Chemistry, etc.; my own section, that of Natural\r\nHistory, was D, under the presidency of Professor Henslow of Cambridge.\r\nI was on the committee, and therefore saw the working of the whole\r\naffair.\r\n\r\nOn the first day there was a dearth of matter in our section. People had\r\nnot arrived with their papers. So by way of finding out whether I could\r\nspeak in public or not, I got up and talked to them for about twenty\r\nminutes. I was considerably surprised to find that when once I had made\r\nthe plunge, my tongue went glibly enough.\r\n\r\nOn the following day I read a long paper, which I had prepared and\r\nillustrated with a lot of big diagrams, to an audience of about twenty\r\npeople! The rest were all away after Prince Albert, who had been\r\nunfortunately induced to visit the meeting, and fairly turned the heads\r\nof the good people of Ipswich. On Saturday a very pleasant excursion on\r\nscientific pretences, but in fact a most jolly and unscientific picnic,\r\ntook place. Several hundred people went down the Orwell in a steamer.\r\nThe majority returned, but I and two others, considering Sunday in\r\nIpswich an impossibility, stopped at a little seaside village,\r\nFelixstowe, and idled away our time there very pleasantly. Babington the\r\nbotanist and myself walked into Ipswich on Sunday night. It is about\r\neleven miles, and we did it comfortably in two hours and three quarters,\r\nwhich was not bad walking.\r\n\r\nOn Monday at Section D again. Forbes brought forward the subject of my\r\napplication to Government in committee, and it was unanimously agreed to\r\nforward a resolution on the subject to the Committee of Recommendations.\r\nI made a speechification of some length in the Section about a new\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday morning I attended a meeting of the Ray Society, and to my\r\ninfinite astonishment, the secretary, Dr. Lankester, gave me the second\r\nmotion to make. The Prince of Casino moved the first, so I was in good\r\ncompany. The great absurdity of it was that not being a member of the\r\nSociety I had properly no right to speak at all. However, it was only a\r\nvote of thanks, and I got up and did the \"neat and appropriate\" in\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\nAfter this a party of us went out dredging in the Orwell in a small\r\nboat. We were away all day, and it rained hard coming back, so that I\r\ngot wet through, and had to pull five miles to keep off my enemy, the\r\nrheumatics.\r\n\r\nThen came the President's dinner, to which I did not go, as I preferred\r\nmaking myself comfortable with a few friends elsewhere. And after that,\r\nthe final evening meeting, when all the final determinations are\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\nAmong them I had the satisfaction to hear that it was resolved--that the\r\nPresident and Council of the British Association should co-operate with\r\nthe Royal Society in representing the value and importance, etc., of Mr.\r\nT.H. Huxley's zoological researches to Her Majesty's Government for the\r\npurpose of obtaining a grant towards their publication. Subsequently I\r\nwas introduced to Colonel Sabine, the President of the Association in\r\n1852, and a man of very high standing and considerable influence. He had\r\npreviously been civil enough to sign my certificate at the Royal\r\nSociety, unsolicited, and therefore knew me by reputation--I only mean\r\nthat as a very small word. He was very civil and promised me every\r\nassistance in his power.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious thing that of the four applications to Government to be\r\nmade by the Association, two were for Naval Assistant-Surgeons, namely\r\none for Dr. Hooker, who had just returned from the Himalaya Mountains,\r\nand one for me. How I envied Hooker; he has long been engaged to a\r\ndaughter of Professor Henslow's, and at this very meeting he sat by her\r\nside. He is going to be married in a day or two. His father is director\r\nof the Kew Gardens, and there is little doubt of his succeeding him.\r\n\r\nWhether the Government accede to the demand that will be made upon them\r\nor not, I can now rest satisfied that no means of influencing them has\r\nbeen left unused by me. If they will not listen to the conjoint\r\nrecommendations of the Royal Society and the British Association, they\r\nwill listen to nothing...\r\n\r\nJuly 16, 1851.\r\n\r\nI went yesterday to dine with Colonel Sabine. We had a long discourse\r\nabout the prospects and probable means of existence of young men trying\r\nto make their way to an existence in the scientific world. I took, as\r\nindeed what I have seen has forced me to take, rather the despairing\r\nside of the question, and said that as it seemed to me England did not\r\nafford even the means of existence to young men who were willing to\r\ndevote themselves to science. However, he spoke cheeringly, and advised\r\nme by no means to be hasty, but to wait, and he doubted not that I\r\nshould succeed. He cited his own case as an instance of waiting,\r\neventually successful. Altogether I felt the better for what he said...\r\n\r\nThere has been a notice of me in the \"Literary Gazette\" for last week,\r\nmuch more laudatory than I deserve, from the pen of my friend Forbes.\r\n[An appreciation of his papers on the Physophoridae and Sagitta,\r\nspeaking highly both of his observations and philosophic power, in the\r\nreport of the proceedings in Section D.]\r\n\r\nIn the same number is a rich song from the same fertile and versatile\r\npen, which was sung at one of our Red Lion meetings. That is why I want\r\nyou to look at it, not that you will understand it, because it is full\r\nof allusions to occurrences known only in the scientific circles. At\r\nIpswich we had a grand Red Lion meeting; about forty members were\r\npresent, and among them some of the most distinguished members of the\r\nAssociation. Some foreigners were invited (the Prince of Casino,\r\nBuonaparte's nephew, among others), and were not a little astonished to\r\nsee the grave professors, whose English solemnity and gravity they had\r\ndoubtless commented on elsewhere, giving themselves up to all sorts of\r\nfun. Among the Red Lions we have a custom (instead of cheering) of\r\nwaving and wagging one coat-tail (one Lion's tail) when we applaud. This\r\nseemed to strike the Prince's fancy amazingly, and when he got up to\r\nreturn thanks for his health being drunk, he told us that as he was\r\nrather out of practice in speaking English, he would return thanks in\r\nour fashion, and therewith he gave three mighty roars and wags, to the\r\nno small amusement of every one. He is singularly like the portraits of\r\nhis uncle, and seems a very jolly, good-humoured old fellow. I believe,\r\nhowever, he is a bit of a rip. It was remarkable how proud the Quakers\r\nwere of being noticed by him.\r\n\r\nTo W. Macleay, of Sydney.\r\n\r\n41 North Bank, Regent's Park, November 9, 1851.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nIt is a year to-day since the old \"Rattlesnake\" was paid off, and that\r\nreminds me among other things that I have hardly kept my promise of\r\ngiving you information now and then upon the state of matters scientific\r\nin England. My last letter is, I am afraid, nine or ten months old, but\r\nhere in England the fighting and scratching to keep your place in the\r\ncrowd exclude almost all other thoughts. When I last wrote I was but at\r\nthe edge of the crush at the pit-door of this great fools' theatre--now\r\nI have worked my way into it and through it, and am, I hope, not far\r\nfrom the check-takers. I have learnt a good deal in my passage.\r\n\r\n[Follows an account of his efforts to get his papers\r\npublished--substantially a repetition of what has already been given.]\r\n\r\nRumours there are scattered abroad of a favourable cast, and I am told\r\non all hands that something will certainly be done. I only asked for 300\r\npounds sterling, something less than the cost of a parliamentary\r\nblue-book which nobody ever hears of. They take care to obliterate any\r\nspark of gratitude that might perchance arise for what they do, by\r\nkeeping one so long in suspense that the result becomes almost a matter\r\nof indifference. Had I known they would keep me so long, I would have\r\npublished my work as a series of papers in the \"Philosophical\r\nTransactions.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile I have not been idle, as I hope to show you by the\r\nvarious papers enclosed with this. You will recollect that on the\r\nSalpae. No one here knew anything about them, and I thought that all my\r\nresults were absolutely new--until, me miserum! I found them in a little\r\npaper of Krohn's in the \"Annales des Sciences\" for 1846, without any\r\nfigures to draw anybody's attention.\r\n\r\nThe memoir on the Medusae (which I sent to you) has, I hear, just\r\nescaped a high honour--to wit, the Royal Medal. The award has been made\r\nto Newport for his paper on \"Impregnation.\" I had no idea that anything\r\nI had done was likely to have the slightest claim to such distinction,\r\nbut I was informed yesterday by one of the Council that the balance hung\r\npretty evenly, and was only decided by their thinking my memoir was too\r\nsmall and short.\r\n\r\nI have been working in all things with a reference to wide views of\r\nzoological philosophy, and the report upon the Echinoderms is intended\r\nin common with the mem. on the Salpae to explain my views of\r\nIndividuality among the lower animals--views which I mean to illustrate\r\nstill further and enunciate still more clearly in my book that is to be.\r\n[He lectured on this subject at the Royal Institution in 1852.] They\r\nhave met with approval from Carpenter, as you will see by the last\r\nedition of his \"Principles of Physiology,\" and I think that Forbes and\r\nsome others will be very likely eventually to come round to them, but\r\neverything that relates to abstract thought is at a low ebb among the\r\nmass of naturalists in this country.\r\n\r\nIn the paper upon \"Thalassicolla,\" and in that which I read before the\r\nBritish Association, as also in one upon the organisation of the\r\nRotifera, which I am going to have published in the Microscopical\r\nSociety's \"Transactions,\" I have been driving in a series of wedges into\r\nCuvier's Radiata, and showing how selon moi they ought to be\r\ndistributed.\r\n\r\nI am every day becoming more and more certain that you were on the right\r\ntrack thirty years ago in your views of the order and symmetry to be\r\ntraced in the true natural system.\r\n\r\nDuring the next session I mean to send in a paper to the Royal Society\r\nupon the \"Homologies of the Mollusca,\" which shall astonish them. I want\r\nto get done for the Mollusca what Savigny did for the Articulata, namely\r\nto show how they all--Cephalopoda, Gasteropoda, Pteropoda, Heteropoda,\r\netc.--are organised in each. What with this and the book, I shall have\r\nenough to do for the next six months.\r\n\r\nYou will doubtless ask what is the practical outlook of all this?\r\nwhether it leads anywhere in the direction of bread and cheese? To this\r\nalso I can give a tolerably satisfactory answer.\r\n\r\nAs you WON'T have a Professor of Natural History at Sydney--to my great\r\nsorrow--I have gone in as a candidate for a Professorial chair at the\r\nother end of the world, Toronto in Canada. In England there is nothing\r\nto be done--it is the most hopeless prospect I know of; of course the\r\nService offers nothing for me except irretrievable waste of time, and\r\nthe scientific appointments are so few and so poor that they are not\r\ntempting...\r\n\r\nHad the Sydney University been carried out as originally proposed, I\r\nshould certainly have become a candidate for the Natural History Chair.\r\nI know no finer field for exertion for any naturalist than Sydney\r\nHarbour itself. Should such a Professorship be hereafter established, I\r\ntrust you will jog the memory of my Australian friends in my behalf. I\r\nhave finally decided that my vocation is science, and I have made up my\r\nmind to the comparative poverty which is its necessary adjunct, and to\r\nthe no less certain seclusion from the ordinary pleasures and rewards of\r\nmen. I say this without the slightest idea that there is anything to be\r\nenthusiastic about in either science or its professors. A year behind\r\nthe scenes is quite enough to disabuse one of all rose-pink illusions.\r\n\r\nBut it is equally clear to me that for a man of my temperament, at any\r\nrate, the sole secret of getting through this life with anything like\r\ncontentment is to have full scope for the development of one's\r\nfaculties. Science alone seems to me to afford this scope--Law,\r\nDivinity, Physic, and Politics being in a state of chaotic vibration\r\nbetween utter humbug and utter scepticism.\r\n\r\nThere is a great stir in the scientific world at present about who is to\r\noccupy Konig's place at the British Museum, and whether the whole\r\nestablishment had better not, quoad Zoology, be remodelled and placed\r\nunder Owen's superintendence. The heart-burnings and jealousies about\r\nthis matter are beyond all conception. Owen is both feared and hated,\r\nand it is predicted that if Gray and he come to be officers of the same\r\ninstitution, in a year or two the total result will be a caudal vertebra\r\nof each remaining after the manner of the Kilkenny cats.\r\n\r\nHowever, I heard yesterday, upon what professed to be very good\r\nauthority, that Owen would not leave the College under any\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing with what an intense feeling of hatred Owen is\r\nregarded by the majority of his contemporaries, with Mantell as\r\narch-hater. The truth is, he is the superior of most, and does not\r\nconceal that he knows it, and it must be confessed that he does some\r\nvery ill-natured tricks now and then. A striking specimen of one is to\r\nbe found in his article on Lyell in the last Quarterly, where he\r\npillories poor Quekett--a most inoffensive man and his own immediate\r\nsubordinate--in a manner not more remarkable for its severity than for\r\nits bad taste. That review has done him much harm in the estimation of\r\nthinking men--and curiously enough, since it was written, reptiles have\r\nbeen found in the old red sandstone, and insectivorous mammals in the\r\nTrias! Owen is an able man, but to my mind not so great as he thinks\r\nhimself. He can only work in the concrete from bone to bone, in abstract\r\nreasoning he becomes lost--witness \"Parthenogenesis\" which he told me he\r\nconsidered one of the best things he had done!\r\n\r\nHe has, however, been very civil to me, and I am as grateful as it is\r\npossible to be towards a man with whom I feel it necessary to be always\r\non my guard.\r\n\r\nQuite another being is the other leader of Zoological Science in this\r\ncountry--I mean Edward Forbes, Paleontologist to the Geological Survey.\r\nMore especially a Zoologist and a Geologist than a Comparative\r\nAnatomist, he has more claims to the title of a Philosophic Naturalist\r\nthan any man I know of in England. A man of letters and an artist, he\r\nhas not merged the MAN in the man of science--he has sympathies for all,\r\nand an earnest, truth-seeking, thoroughly genial disposition which win\r\nfor him your affection as well as your respect. Forbes has more\r\ninfluence by his personal weight and example upon the rising generation\r\nof scientific naturalists than Owen will have if he write from now till\r\nDoomsday.\r\n\r\nPersonally I am greatly indebted to him (though the opinion I have just\r\nexpressed is that of the world in general). During my absence he\r\nsuperintended the publication of my paper, and from the moment of my\r\narrival until now he has given me all the help one man can give another.\r\nWhy he should have done so I do not know, as when I left England I had\r\nonly spoken to him once.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the naturalists stand far below these two in learning,\r\noriginality, and grasp of mind. Goodsir of Edinburgh should I suppose\r\ncome next, but he can't write intelligibly. Darwin might be anything if\r\nhe had good health. Bell is a good man in all the senses of the word,\r\nbut wants qualities 2 and 3. Newport is a laborious man, but wants 1 and\r\n3. Grant and Rymer Jones--arcades ambo--have mistaken their vocation.\r\n\r\nMy old chief Richardson is a man of men, but troubles himself little\r\nwith anything but detail zoology. What think you of his getting married\r\nfor the third time just before his last expedition? I hardly know by\r\nwhich step he approved himself the bolder man.\r\n\r\nI think I have now fulfilled my promise of supplying you with a little\r\nscientific scandal--and if this long epistle has repaid your trouble in\r\ngetting through it, I am content.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, I have not forgotten, nor ever shall forget, your kindness\r\nto me at a time when a little appreciation and encouragement were more\r\ngrateful to me and of more service than they will perhaps ever be again.\r\nI have done my best to justify you.\r\n\r\nI send copies of all the papers I have published with one exception, of\r\nwhich I have none separate. Of the Royal Society papers I send a double\r\nset. Will you be kind enough to give one with my kind regards and\r\nremembrances to Dr. Nicholson? I feel I ought to have written to him\r\nbefore leaving Sydney, but I trust he will excuse my not having done so.\r\n\r\nI shall be very glad if you can find time to write.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nW. Macleay, Esq.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Muller has just made a most extraordinary discovery, no less than\r\nthe generation of Molluscs from Holothuriae!!! You will find a\r\ntranslation of his paper by me in the \"Annals\" for January 1852.\r\n\r\nDecember 13, 1851.\r\n\r\n[To his sister.]\r\n\r\nMay 20, 1851.\r\n\r\n...Owen has been amazingly civil to me, and it was through his writing\r\nto the First Lord that I got my present appointment. He is a queer fish,\r\nmore odd in appearance than ever...and more bland in manner. He is so\r\nfrightfully polite that I never feel thoroughly at home with him. He got\r\nme to furnish him with some notes for the second edition of the\r\n\"Admiralty Manual of Scientific Inquiry,\" and I find that in it Darwin\r\nand I (comparisons are odious) figure as joint authorities on some\r\nmicroscopic matters!!\r\n\r\nProfessor Forbes, however, is my great ally, a first-rate man,\r\nthoroughly in earnest and disinterested, and ready to give his time and\r\ninfluence--which is great--to help any man who is working for the cause.\r\nTo him I am indebted for the supervision of papers that were published\r\nin my absence, for many introductions, and most valuable information and\r\nassistance, and all done in such a way as not to oppress one or give one\r\nany feeling of patronage, which you know (so much do I retain of my old\r\nself) would not suit me. My notions are diametrically opposed to his in\r\nsome matters, and he helps me to oppose him. The other night, or rather\r\nnights, for it took three, I had a long paper read at the Royal Society\r\nwhich opposed some of his views, and he got up and spoke in the highest\r\nterms of it afterwards. This is all as it should be. I can reverence\r\nsuch a man and yet respect myself.\r\n\r\nI have been aspiring to great honours since I wrote to you last, to wit\r\nthe F.R.S., and found no little to my astonishment that I had a chance\r\nof it, and so went in. I must tell you that they have made the admission\r\nmore difficult than it used to be. Candidates are not elected by the\r\nSociety alone, but fifteen only a year are selected by a committee, and\r\nthen elected as a matter of course by the Society. This year there were\r\nthirty-eight candidates. I did not expect to come in till next year, but\r\nI find I am one of the selected. I fancy I shall be the junior Fellow by\r\nsome years. Singularly enough, among the non-selected candidates were\r\nWard, the man who conducted the Botanical Honours Examination of\r\nApothecaries' Hall nine years ago, and Bryson, the surgeon of the\r\n\"Fisguard,\" i.e. nominally my immediate superior, and who, as he\r\nfrequently acts as Sir William Burnett's deputy, WILL VERY LIKELY\r\nEXAMINE ME WHEN I PASS FOR SURGEON R.N.!! That is awkward and must be\r\nannoying to him, but it is not my fault. I did not ask for a single name\r\nthat appeared upon my certificate. Owen's name and Carpenter's, which\r\nwere to have been appended, were not added. Forbes, my recommender, told\r\nme beforehand not to expect to get in this year, and did not use his\r\ninfluence, and so I have no intriguing to reproach myself with or to be\r\nreproached with. The only drawback is that it will cost me 14 pounds\r\nsterling, which is more than I can very well afford.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I have not told you that after staying for about five months\r\nwith George, I found that if I meant to work in earnest his home was not\r\nthe place, so, much to my regret,--for they made me very happy there,--I\r\nsummoned resolution and \"The Boy's Own Book\" and took a den of my own,\r\nwhence I write at present. You had better, anyhow, direct to George, as\r\nI am going to move and don't know how long I may remain at my next\r\nhabitation. At present I am living in the Park Road, but I find it too\r\nnoisy and am going to St. Anne's Gardens, St. John's Wood, close to my\r\nmother's, against whose forays I shall have to fortify myself.\r\n\r\n[It was a minor addition to his many troubles that after a time Huxley\r\nfound a grudging and jealous spirit exhibited in some quarters towards\r\nhis success, and influence used to prevent any further advance that\r\nmight endanger the existing balance of power in the scientific world.\r\nBut this could be battled with directly; indeed it was rather a relief\r\nto have an opportunity for action instead of sitting still to wait the\r\nresults of uncertain elections. The qualities requisite for such a\r\ncontest he possessed, in a high ideal of the dignity of science as an\r\ninstrument of truth; a standard of veracity in scientific workers to\r\nwhich all should subordinate their personal ambitions; a disregard of\r\nauthority as such unless its claims were verified by indisputable fact;\r\nand as a beginning, the will to subject himself to his own most rigid\r\ncanons of accuracy, thoroughness, and honesty; then to maintain his\r\nprinciple and defend his position against all attempts at browbeating.]\r\n\r\nMarch 5, 1852\r\n\r\nI told you I was very busy, and I must tell you what I am about and you\r\nwill believe me. I have just finished a Memoir for the Royal Society\r\n[\"On the Morphology of the Cephalous Mollusca\" \"Scientific Memoirs\"\r\nvolume 1 page 152.], which has taken me a world of time, thought, and\r\nreading, and is, perhaps, the best thing I have done yet. It will not be\r\nread till May, and I do not know whether they will print it or not\r\nafterwards; that will require care and a little manoeuvring on my part.\r\nYou have no notion of the intrigues that go on in this blessed world of\r\nscience. Science is, I fear, no purer than any other region of human\r\nactivity; though it should be. Merit alone is very little good; it must\r\nbe backed by tact and knowledge of the world to do very much.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I know that the paper I have just sent in is very original\r\nand of some importance, and I am equally sure that if it is referred to\r\nthe judgment of my \"particular friend\" -- that it will not be published.\r\nHe won't be able to say a word against it, but he will pooh-pooh it to a\r\ndead certainty.\r\n\r\nYou will ask with some wonderment, Why? Because for the last twenty\r\nyears -- has been regarded as the great authority on these matters, and\r\nhas had no one to tread on his heels, until at last, I think, he has\r\ncome to look upon the Natural World as his special preserve, and \"no\r\npoachers allowed.\" So I must manoeuvre a little to get my poor memoir\r\nkept out of his hands.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for these little stratagems utterly disgusts me. I would\r\nso willingly reverence and trust any man of high standing and ability. I\r\nam so utterly unable to comprehend this petty greediness. And yet withal\r\nyou will smile at my perversity. I have a certain pleasure in overcoming\r\nthese obstacles, and fighting these folks with their own weapons. I do\r\nso long to be able to trust men implicitly. I have such a horror of all\r\nthis literary pettifogging. I could be so content myself, if the\r\nnecessity of making a position would allow it, to work on anonymously,\r\nbut -- I see is determined not to let either me or any one else rise if\r\nhe can help it. Let him beware. On my own subjects I am his master, and\r\nam quite ready to fight half a dozen dragons. And although he has a\r\nbitter pen, I flatter myself that on occasions I can match him in that\r\ndepartment also.\r\n\r\nBut I was telling you how busy I am. I am getting a memoir ready for the\r\nZoological Society, and working at my lecture for the Royal Institution,\r\nwhich I want to make striking and original, as it is a good opportunity,\r\nbesides doing a translation now and then for one of the Journals.\r\nBesides this, I am working at the British Museum to make a catalogue of\r\nsome creatures there. All these things take a world of time and labour;\r\nand yield next to no direct profit; but they bring me into contact with\r\nall sorts of men, in a very independent position, and I am told, and\r\nindeed hope, that something must arise from it. So fair a prospect opens\r\nout before me if I can only wait. I am beginning to know what WORK\r\nmeans, and see how much more may be done by steady, unceasing, and\r\nwell-directed efforts. I thrive upon it too. I am as well as ever I was\r\nin my life, and the more I work the better my temper seems to be.\r\n\r\nApril 30, 1852, 11.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nI have just returned from giving my lecture at the Royal Institution, of\r\nwhich I told you in my last letter. [\"On Animal Individuality\"\r\n\"Scientific Memoirs\" volume 1 page 146 cp. supra.]\r\n\r\nI had got very nervous about it, and my poor mother's death had greatly\r\nupset my plans for working it out.\r\n\r\nIt was the first lecture I had ever given in my life, and to what is\r\nconsidered the best audience in London. As nothing ever works up my\r\nenergies but a high flight, I had chosen a very difficult abstract\r\npoint, in my view of which I stand almost alone. When I took a glimpse\r\ninto the theatre and saw it full of faces, I did feel most amazingly\r\nuncomfortable. I can now quite understand what it is to be going to be\r\nhanged, and nothing but the necessity of the case prevented me from\r\nrunning away.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the hour struck, in I marched, and began to deliver my\r\ndiscourse. For ten minutes I did not quite know where I was, but by\r\ndegrees I got used to it, and gradually gained perfect command of myself\r\nand of my subject. I believe I contrived to interest my audience, and\r\nupon the whole I think I may say that this essay was successful.\r\n\r\nThank Heaven I can say so, for though it is no great matter succeeding,\r\nfailing would have been a bitter annoyance to me. It has put me\r\ncomfortably at my ease with regard to all future lecturings. After the\r\nRoyal Institution there is no audience I shall ever fear.\r\n\r\nMay 9.\r\n\r\nThe foolish state of excitement into which I allowed myself to get the\r\nother day completely did for me, and I have hardly done anything since\r\nexcept sleep a great deal. It is a strange thing that with all my will I\r\ncannot control my physical organisation.\r\n\r\n[To his sister.]\r\n\r\nApril 17, 1852.\r\n\r\n...I fear nothing will have prepared you to hear that one so active in\r\nbody and mind as our poor mother was has been taken from us. But so it\r\nis...\r\n\r\nIt was very strange that before leaving London my mother, possessed by a\r\nstrange whim, as I thought, distributed to many of us little things\r\nbelonging to her. I laughed at her for what I called her \"testamentary\r\ndisposition,\" little dreaming that the words were prophetic.\r\n\r\n[The summons to those of the family in London reached them late, and\r\ntheir arrival was made still later by inconvenient trains and a midnight\r\ndrive, so that all had long been over when they came to Barning in Kent,\r\nwhere the elder Huxleys had just settled near their son James.]\r\n\r\nOur mother had died at half-past four, falling gradually into a more and\r\nmore profound insensibility. She was thus happily spared the pain of\r\nfruitlessly wishing us round her, in her last moments; and as the hand\r\nof Death was upon her, I know not that it could have fallen more\r\nlightly.\r\n\r\nI offer you no consolation, my dearest sister; for I know of none. There\r\nare things which each must bear as he best may with the strength that\r\nhas been allotted to him. Would that I were near you to soften the blow\r\nby the sympathy which we should have in common...\r\n\r\nMay 3, 1852.\r\n\r\nSo much occupation has crowded upon me between the beginning of this\r\nletter and the present time that I have been unable to finish it. I had\r\nundertaken to give a lecture at the Royal Institution on the 30th April.\r\nIt was on a difficult subject, requiring a good deal of thought; and as\r\nit was my first appearance before the best audience in London, you may\r\nimagine how anxious and nervous I was, and how completely I was obliged\r\nto abstract my thoughts from everything else.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am happy to say it is well over. There was a very good\r\naudience--Faraday, Professor Forbes, Dr. Forbes, Wharton Jones, and [a]\r\nwhole lot of \"nobs,\" among my auditors. I had made up my mind all day to\r\nbreak down, and then go and hang myself privately. And so you may\r\nimagine that I entered the theatre with a very pale face, and a heart\r\nbeating like a sledge-hammer nineteen to the dozen. For the first five\r\nminutes I did not know very clearly what I was about, but by degrees I\r\ngot possession of myself and of my subject, and did not care for\r\nanybody. I have had \"golden opinions from all sorts of men\" about it, so\r\nI suppose I may tell you I have succeeded. I don't think, however, that\r\nI ever felt so thoroughly used up in my life as I did for two days\r\nafterwards. There is one comfort, I shall never be nervous again about\r\nany audience; but at one's first attempt, to stand in the place of\r\nFaraday and such big-wigs might excuse a little weakness.\r\n\r\nThe way is clear before me, if my external circumstances will only allow\r\nme to persevere; but I fully expect that I shall have to give up my\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nScience in England does everything--but PAY. You may earn praise but not\r\npudding.\r\n\r\nI have helping hands held out to me on all sides, but there is nothing\r\nto help me to. Last year I became a candidate for a Professorship at\r\nToronto. I took an infinity of trouble over the thing, and got together\r\na mass of testimonials and recommendations, much better than I had any\r\nright to expect. From that time to this I have heard nothing of the\r\nbusiness--a result for which I care the less, as I believe the chair\r\nwill be given to a brother of one of the members of the Canadian\r\nministry, who is, I hear, a candidate. Such a qualification as that is,\r\nof course, better than all the testimonials in the world.\r\n\r\nI think I told you when I last wrote that I was expecting a grant from\r\nGovernment to publish the chief part of my work, done while away. I am\r\nexpecting it still. I got tired of waiting the other day and wrote to\r\nthe Duke of Northumberland, who is at present First Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty, upon the subject. His Grace has taken the matter up, and I\r\nhope now to get it done.\r\n\r\nWith all this, however, Time runs on. People look upon me, I suppose, as\r\na \"very promising young man,\" and perhaps envy my \"success,\" and I all\r\nthe while am cursing my stars that my Pegasus WILL fly aloft instead of\r\npulling slowly along in some respectable gig, and getting his oats like\r\nany other praiseworthy cart-horse.\r\n\r\nIt's a charming piece of irony altogether. It is two years yesterday\r\nsince I left Sydney harbour--and of course as long since I saw Nettie. I\r\nam getting thoroughly tired of our separation, and I think she is,\r\nthough the dear little soul is ready to do anything for my sake, and yet\r\nI dare not face the stagnation--the sense of having failed in the whole\r\npurpose of my existence--which would, I know, sooner or later beset me,\r\neven with her, if I forsake my present object. Can you wonder with all\r\nthis, my dearest Lizzie, that often as I long for your brave heart and\r\nclear head to support and advise me, I yet rarely feel inclined to\r\nwrite? Pray write to me more often than you have done; tell me all about\r\nyourself and the Doctor and your children. They must be growing up fast,\r\nand Florry must be getting beyond the \"Bird of Paradise\" I promised her.\r\nLove and kisses to all of them, and kindest remembrances to the Doctor.\r\n\r\nEver your affectionate brother,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[To Miss Heathorn]\r\n\r\nNovember 13, 1852.\r\n\r\nGoing last week to the Royal Society's library for a book, and like the\r\nboy in church \"thinkin' o' naughten,\" when I went in, Weld, the\r\nAssistant Secretary, said, \"Well, I congratulate you.\" I confess I did\r\nnot see at that moment what any mortal man had to congratulate me about.\r\nI had a deuced bad cold, with rheumatism in my head; it was a beastly\r\nNovember day and I was very grumpy, so I inquired in a state of mild\r\nsurprise what might be the matter. Whereupon I learnt that the Medal had\r\nbeen conferred at the meeting of the Council on the day before. I was\r\nvery pleased...and I thought you would be so too, and I thought moreover\r\nthat it was a fine lever to help us on, and if I could have sent a\r\nletter to you immediately I should have sat down and have written one to\r\nyou on the spot. As it is I have waited for official confirmation and a\r\nconvenient season.\r\n\r\nAnd now...shall I be very naughty and make a confession? The thing that\r\na fortnight ago (before I got it) I thought so much of, I give you my\r\nword I do not care a pin for. I am sick of it and ashamed of having\r\nthought so much of it, and the congratulations I get give me a sort of\r\ninternal sardonic grin. I think this has come about partly because I did\r\nnot get the official confirmation of what I had heard for some days, and\r\nwith my habit of facing the ill side of things I came to the conclusion\r\nthat Weld had made a mistake, and I went in thought through the whole\r\nenormous mortification of having to explain to those to whom I had\r\nmentioned it that it was quite a mistake. I found that all this, when I\r\ncame to look at it, was by no means so dreadful as it seemed--quite\r\nbearable in short--and then I laughed at myself and have cared nothing\r\nabout the whole concern ever since. In truth...I do not think that I am\r\nin the proper sense of the word ambitious. I have an enormous longing\r\nafter the highest and best in all shapes--a longing which haunts me and\r\nis the demon which ever impels me to work, and will let me have no rest\r\nunless I am doing his behests. The honours of men I value so far as they\r\nare evidences of power, but with the cynical mistrust of their judgment\r\nand my own worthiness, which always haunts me, I put very little faith\r\nin them. Their praise makes me sneer inwardly. God forgive me if I do\r\nthem any great wrong.\r\n\r\n...I feel and know that all the rewards and honours in the world will\r\never be worthless for me as soon as they are obtained. I know that\r\nalways, as now, they will make me more sad than joyful. I know that\r\nnothing that could be done would give me the pure and heartfelt joy and\r\npeace of mind that your love has given me, and, please God, shall give\r\nfor many a long year to come, and yet my demon says work! work! you\r\nshall not even love unless you work.\r\n\r\nNot blinded by any vanity, then, I hope...but viewing this stroke of\r\nfortune as respects its public estimation only, I think I must look upon\r\nthe award of this medal as the turning-point of my life, as the\r\nfinger-post teaching me as clearly as anything can what is the true\r\ncareer that lies open before me. For whatever may be my own private\r\nestimation of it, there can be no doubt as to the general feeling about\r\nthis thing, and in case of my candidature for any office it would have\r\nthe very greatest weight. And as you will have seen by my last letter,\r\nit only strengthens and confirms the conclusion I had come to. Bid me\r\nGod-speed then...it is all I want to labour cheerfully.\r\n\r\nNovember 28.\r\n\r\n...You will hear all the details of the Great Duke's state funeral from\r\nthe papers much better than I can tell you them. I went to the Cathedral\r\n[St Paul's] and had the good fortune to get a capital seat--in front,\r\nclose to the great door by which every one entered. It was bitter cold,\r\na keen November wind blowing right in, and as I was there from eight\r\ntill three, I expected nothing less than rheumatic fever the next day;\r\nhowever I didn't get it. It was pitiful to see the poor old Marquis of\r\nAnglesey--a year older than the Duke--standing with bare head in the\r\nkeen wind close to me for more than three quarters of an hour. It was\r\nimpressive enough--the great interior lighted by a single line of light\r\nrunning along the whole circuit of the cornice, and another encircling\r\nthe dome, and casting a curious illumination over the masses of uniforms\r\nwhich filled the great space. The best of our people were there and\r\npassed close to me, but the only face that made any great impression\r\nupon my memory was that of Sir Charles Napier, the conqueror of Scinde.\r\nFancy a very large, broad-winged, and fierce-looking hawk in uniform.\r\nSuch an eye!\r\n\r\nWhen the coffin and the mourners had passed I closed up with the\r\nsoldiers and went up under the dome, where I heard the magnificent\r\nservice in full perfection.\r\n\r\nAll of it, however, was but stage trickery compared with the noble\r\nsimplicity of the old man's life. How the old stoic, used to his iron\r\nbed and hard hair pillow, would have smiled at all the pomp--submitting\r\nto that, however, and all other things necessary to the \"carrying on of\r\nthe Queen's Government.\"\r\n\r\nI send Tennyson's ode by way of packing--it is not worth much more, the\r\nonly decent passages to my mind being those I have marked.\r\n\r\nThe day after to-morrow I go to have my medal presented and to dine and\r\nmake a speech.\r\n\r\n[The Royal Medal was conferred on November 30, and the medallists were\r\nentertained at the anniversary dinner of the Society on that day. In the\r\nwords with which the President, the Earl of Rosse, accompanied the\r\npresentation of the medal, \"it is not difficult,\" writes Sir M. Foster,\r\n\"reading between the lines, to recognise the appreciation of a new\r\nspirit of anatomical inquiry, not wholly free from a timorous\r\napprehension as to its complete validity.\" (\"In these papers (on the\r\nMedusae) you have for the first time fully developed their structure,\r\nand laid the foundation of a rational theory for their classification.\"\r\n\"In your second paper 'On the Anatomy of Salpa and Pyrosoma,' the\r\nphenomena, etc., have received the most ingenious and elaborate\r\nelucidation, and have given rise to a process of reasoning, the results\r\nof which can scarcely yet be anticipated, but must bear in a very\r\nimportant degree upon some of the most abstruse points of what may be\r\ncalled transcendental physiology.\" See \"Royal Society\" Obituary Notices\r\nvolume 59 page 1.) For the difference between this and the labours of\r\nthe greatest English comparative anatomist of the time, whose detailed\r\nwork was of the highest value, but whose generalisations and\r\nspeculations, based on the philosophy of Oken, proved barren and\r\nfruitless, lay in the fact that Huxley, led to it doubtless by his\r\nsolitary readings in his Charing Cross days, had taken up the method of\r\nVon Baer and Johannes Muller, then almost unknown, or at least unused in\r\nEngland--\"the method which led the anatomist to face his problems in the\r\nspirit in which the physicist faced his.\"\r\n\r\nHe had been warned by Forbes not to speak too strongly about the\r\ndilatoriness of the Government in the matter of the grant, so he\r\nwrites:] \"I will 'roar you like any sucking dove' at the dinner, though\r\nI felt tempted otherwise.\" [On December 1 he tells how he carried out\r\nthis advice.]\r\n\r\nMy dear Forbes,\r\n\r\nYou will, I know, like to learn how I got on yesterday. The President's\r\naddress to me had been drawn up by Bell. It was, of course, too\r\nflattering, but he had taken hold of the right points in my work--at\r\nleast I thought so.\r\n\r\nBunsen spoke very well for Humboldt.\r\n\r\nThere was a capital congregation at the dinner--sixty or seventy Fellows\r\nthere...\r\n\r\nWhen it came to my turn to return thanks, I believe I made a very\r\ntolerable speechification, at least everybody says so. Lord Rosse had\r\nalluded to \"science having to take care of itself in this country,\" and\r\nin winding up I gave them a small screed upon that text. That you may\r\nsee I kept your caution in mind, I will tell you as nearly as may be\r\nwhat I said. I told them that I could not conceive that anything I had\r\nhitherto done merited the honour of that day (I looked so preciously\r\nmeek over this), but that I was glad to be able to say that I had so\r\nmuch unpublished material as to make me hopeful of one day diminishing\r\nthe debt. I then said, \"The Government of this country, of this GREAT\r\ncountry, has been two years debating whether it should grant the three\r\nhundred pounds sterling necessary for the publication of these\r\nresearches. I have been too long used to strict discipline to venture to\r\ncriticise any act of my superiors, but I venture to hope that before\r\nlong, in consequence of the exertions of Lord Rosse, of the President of\r\nthe British Association, and the goodwill, which I gratefully\r\nacknowledge, of the present Lord of the Admiralty, I shall be able to\r\nlay before you something more worthy of to-day's award.\"\r\n\r\nI had my doubts how the nobs would take it, but both Lord Rosse and\r\nSabine warmly commended my speech and regretted I had not said even more\r\nupon the subject.\r\n\r\n[Some light is thrown upon his habits at this time by the following,\r\npart of his letter to Forbes of November 19:--]\r\n\r\nI have frequent visits from --. He is a good man, but direfully\r\nargumentative, and in that sense to me a bore. Besides that, the\r\ncreature will come and call upon me at nine or ten o'clock in the\r\nmorning before I am out of bed, or if out of bed, before I am in\r\npossession of my faculties, which never arrive before twelve or one.\r\n\r\n[This morning incapacity was of a piece with his hatred of the\r\nbreakfast-party of the period. To go abroad from home or to do any work\r\nbefore breakfasting ensured him a headache for the rest of the day, so\r\nthat he never was one of those risers with the dawn who do half a day's\r\nwork before the rest of the world is astir. And though necessity often\r\ncompelled him to do with less, he always found eight hours his proper\r\nallowance of sleep.\r\n\r\nBut in the end of 1853 we hear of a reform in his ways, after a bad bout\r\nof ill-health, when he rises at eight, goes to bed at twelve, and\r\neschews parties of every kind as far as possible, with excellent results\r\nas far as health went.\r\n\r\nAfter his marriage, however, and indeed to the beginning of his last\r\nillness, he always rose early enough for an eight o'clock breakfast,\r\nafter which the working day began, lasting regularly from a little after\r\nnine till midnight.\r\n\r\n4 Upper York Place, St. John's Wood, February 6, 1853.\r\n\r\nMany thanks, my dearest sister, for your kind and thoughtful letter--it\r\nwent to my heart no little that you, amidst all your trials and\r\ntroubles, should find time to think so wisely and so affectionately of\r\nmine. Though greatly tempted otherwise, I have acted in the spirit of\r\nyour advice, and my reward, in the shape of honours at any rate, has not\r\nfailed me, as the Royal Society gave me one of the Royal medals last\r\nyear. It's a bigger one than I got under your auspices so many years\r\nago, being worth 50 pounds sterling, but I don't know that I cared so\r\nmuch about it.\r\n\r\nIt was assigned to me quite unexpectedly, and in the eyes of the world\r\nI, of course, am greatly the bigger--but I will confess to you privately\r\nthat I am by no means dilated, and am the identical Boy Tom I was before\r\nI achieved the attainment of my golden porter's badge. Curiously it was\r\ngiven for the first Memoir I have in the Royal Society's \"Transactions,\"\r\nsent home four years ago with no small fear and trembling, and, \"after\r\nmany days,\" returning with this queer crust of bread. In the speech I\r\nhad to make at the Anniversary Dinner I grew quite eloquent on that\r\npoint, and talked of the dove I had sent from my ark, returning, not\r\nwith the olive branch, but with a sprig of the bay and a fruit from the\r\ngarden of the Hesperides--a simile which I thought decidedly clever, but\r\nwhich the audience--distinguished audience I ought to have\r\nsaid--probably didn't, as they did not applaud that, while they did some\r\nthings I said which were incomparably more stupid. This was in November,\r\nand I ought to have written to you about it before, my dear Lizzie, but\r\nfor one thing I am very much occupied, and for the other (shall I\r\nconfess it?) I was rather puzzled that I had not heard from you since I\r\nwrote. Now my useless conscience, which never makes me do anything right\r\nin time, is pitching in to me when it is too late.\r\n\r\nThe medal, however, must not be jested at, as it is most decidedly of\r\npractical use in giving me a status in the eyes of those charming\r\npeople, \"practical men,\" such as I had not before, and I am amused to\r\nfind some of my friends, whose contempt for my \"dreamy\" notions was not\r\nsmall in time past, absolutely advising me to take a far more dreamy\r\ncourse than I dare venture upon. However, I take very much my own course\r\nnow, even as I have done before--Huxley all over.\r\n\r\nHowever, that is enough about myself just now. In the next letter I will\r\ntell you more at length about my plans and prospects, which are mostly,\r\nI am sorry to say, only provocative of setting my teeth hard and saying,\r\n\"Never mind, I WILL.\" But what I write in a hurry about and want you to\r\ndo at once, is to write to me and tell me exactly how money may be sent\r\nsafely to you. It is inexpedient to send without definite directions,\r\naccording to the character you give your neighbours. Don't expect\r\nanything vast, but there is corn in Egypt...\r\n\r\nTwo classes of people can I deal with and no third. They are the good\r\npeople--people after my own heart, and the thorough men of the world.\r\nEither of these I can act and sympathise with, but the others, who are\r\nneither for God nor for the Devil, but for themselves, as grim old Dante\r\nhas it, and whom he therefore very justly puts in a most uncomfortable\r\nplace, I cannot do with...\r\n\r\nSo Florry is growing up into a great girl; the child will not remember\r\nme, but kiss her and my godson for me, and give my love to them all. The\r\nLymph shall come in my next letter for the young Yankee. I hope the\r\njuices of the English cow will prevent him from ever acquiring the\r\nsnuffle.\r\n\r\nTell the Doctor all about the medal, with my kindest regards, and\r\nbelieve me, my dearest Lizzie, your affectionate brother,\r\n\r\nTom.\r\n\r\n4 Upper York Place, St. John's Wood, April 22, 1853.\r\n\r\nMy dearest Lizzie,\r\n\r\nFirst let me congratulate you on being safe over your troubles and in\r\npossession of another possible President. I think it may be worth coming\r\nover twenty years hence on the possibility of picking up something or\r\nother from one of my nephews at Washington.\r\n\r\n[He sends some money.] Would it were more worth your having, but I have\r\nnot as yet got on to Tom Tiddler's ground on this side of the water. You\r\nneed not be alarmed about my having involved myself in any way--such\r\nportion of it as is of my sending has been conquered by mine own sword\r\nand spear, and the rest came from Mary. [Mrs. George Huxley]...\r\n\r\n[After giving a summary of his struggle with the Admiralty, he\r\nproceeds]--If I were to tell you all the intriguing and humbug there has\r\nbeen about my unfortunate grant--which yet granted--it would occupy this\r\nletter, and though a very good illustration of the encouragement\r\nafforded to Science in this country, would not be very amusing. Once or\r\ntwice it has fairly died out, only to be stirred up again by my own\r\npertinacity. However, I have hopes of it at last, as I hear Lord Rosse\r\nis just about to make another application to the present Government on\r\nthe subject. While this business has been dragging on of course I have\r\nnot been idle. I have four memoirs (on various matters in Comparative\r\nAnatomy) in the \"Philosophical Transactions,\" and they have given me\r\ntheir Fellowship and one of the Royal medals. I have written a whole lot\r\nof things for the journals--reviews for the \"British and Foreign\r\nQuarterly Medical,\" etc. I am one of the editors of Taylor's \"Scientific\r\nMemoirs\" (German scientific translations). In conjunction with my friend\r\nBusk I am translating a great German book on the \"Microscopical Anatomy\r\nof Man,\" and I have engaged to write a long article for Todd's\r\n\"Cyclopaedia.\" Besides this, have read two long memoirs at the British\r\nAssociation, and have given two lectures at the Royal Institution--one\r\nof them only two days ago, when I was so ill with influenza I could\r\nhardly stand or speak.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I have been a candidate for a Professorship of Natural\r\nHistory at Toronto (which is not even yet decided); for one at Aberdeen,\r\nwhich has been given against me; and at present I am a candidate for the\r\nProfessorship of Physiology at King's College, or, rather, for half of\r\nit--Todd having given up, and Bowman, who remains, being willing to take\r\nonly half, and that he will soon give up. My friend Edward Forbes--a\r\nregular brick, who has backed me through thick and thin--is backing me\r\nfor King's College, where he is one of the Professors. My chance is, I\r\nbelieve, very good, but nothing can be more uncertain than the result of\r\nthe contest. If they don't take one of their own men I think they will\r\nhave me. It would suit me very well, and the whole chair is worth 400\r\npounds sterling a year, and would enable me to live.\r\n\r\nSomething I must make up my mind to do, and that speedily. I can get\r\nhonour in Science, but it doesn't pay, and \"honour heals no wounds.\" In\r\ntruth I am often very weary. The longer one lives the more the ideal and\r\nthe purpose vanishes out of one's life, and I begin to doubt whether I\r\nhave done wisely in giving vent to the cherished tendency towards\r\nScience which has haunted me ever since my childhood. Had I given myself\r\nto Mammon I might have been a respectable member of society with large\r\nwatch-seals by this time. I think it is very likely that if this King's\r\nCollege business goes against me, I may give up the farce\r\naltogether--burn my books, burn my rod, and take to practice in\r\nAustralia. It is no use to go on kicking against the pricks...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.8.\r\n\r\n1854.\r\n\r\n[The year 1854 marks the turning-point in Huxley's career. The desperate\r\ntime of waiting came to an end. By the help of his lectures and his pen,\r\nhe could at all events stand and wait independently of the Navy. He\r\ncould not, of course, think of immediate marriage, nor of asking Miss\r\nHeathorn to join him in England; but it so happened that her father was\r\nalready thinking of returning home, and finally this was determined upon\r\njust before Professor Forbes' translation to a chair at Edinburgh gave\r\nHuxley what turned out to be the long-hoped-for permanency in London.]\r\n\r\nJune 3, 1854.\r\n\r\nI have often spoken to you of my friend Edward Forbes. He has quite\r\nrecently been suddenly appointed to a Professorial Chair in Edinburgh,\r\nvacated by the death of old Jamieson. He was obliged to go down there at\r\nonce and lecture, and as he had just commenced his course at the\r\nGovernment School of Mines in Jermyn Street, it was necessary to obtain\r\na substitute. He had spoken to me of the possibility of his being called\r\naway long ago, and had asked if I would take his place, to which, of\r\ncourse, I assented, but the whole affair was so uncertain that I never\r\nin any way reckoned upon it. Even at last I did not know on the Monday\r\nwhether I was to go on for him on the Friday or not. However, he did go\r\nafter giving two lectures, and on Friday the 25th May I took his\r\nlecture, and I have been going on ever since, twice a week on Mondays\r\nand Fridays. Called upon so very suddenly to give a course of some six\r\nand twenty lectures, I find it very hard work, but I like it and I never\r\nwas in better health.\r\n\r\n[On July 20, this temporary work, which he had undertaken as the friend\r\nof Forbes, was exchanged for one of the permanent lectureships formerly\r\nheld by the latter. A hundred a year for twenty-six lectures was not\r\naffluence; it would have suited him better to have had twice the work\r\nand twice the pay. But it was his crossing of the Rubicon, and,\r\nstrangely enough, no sooner had he gained this success than it was\r\ndoubled.]\r\n\r\nJuly 30, 1854.\r\n\r\nI was appointed yesterday to a post of 200 pounds sterling a year. It\r\nhas all come about in the strangest way. I told you how my friend Forbes\r\nhad been suddenly called away to Edinburgh, and that I had suddenly\r\ntaken his duties--sharp work it has been I can tell you these summer\r\nmonths, but it is over and done satisfactorily. Forbes got 500 pounds\r\nsterling a year, 200 pounds sterling for a double lectureship, 300\r\npounds sterling for another office. I took one of the lectureships,\r\nwhich would have given me 100 pounds sterling a year only, and another\r\nman was to have the second lectureship and the other office in question.\r\nIt was so completely settled a week ago that I had written to the\r\nPresident of the Board of Trade who makes the appointment, accepting\r\nmine, and the other man had done the same. Happily for me, however, my\r\nnew colleague was suddenly afflicted with a sort of moral colic, an\r\nabsurd idea that he could not perform the duties of his office, and\r\nresigned it. The result is that a new man has been appointed to the\r\noffice he left vacant, while the lectureship was offered to me. Of\r\ncourse I took it, and so in the course of the week I have seen my paid\r\nincome doubled...So after a short interval I have become a Government\r\nofficer again, but in rather a different position I flatter myself. I am\r\nchief of my own department, and my position is considered a very good\r\none--as good as anything of its kind in London.\r\n\r\n[Furthermore, on August 11 he was \"entrusted with the Coast Survey\r\ninvestigations under the Geological Survey, and remunerated by fee until\r\nMarch 31, 1855, when he was ranked as Naturalist on the Survey with an\r\nadditional salary of 200 pounds sterling, afterwards increased to 400\r\npounds sterling, rising to 600 pounds sterling per annum,\" as the\r\nofficial statement has it.\r\n\r\nThen in quick succession he was offered in August a lectureship on\r\nComparative Anatomy at St. Thomas' Hospital for the following May and\r\nJune, and in September he was asked to lecture in November and March for\r\nthe Science and Art Department at Marlborough House.\r\n\r\nNow therefore, with the Heathorns coming to England, his plans and\r\ntheirs exactly fitted, and he proposed to get married as soon as they\r\ncame over, early in the following summer.\r\n\r\nA letter of this year deserves quoting as illustrating the directness of\r\nHuxley's dealings with his friends, and his hatred of doing anything\r\nunknown to them which might be misreported to them or misconstrued\r\nwithout explanation. As a member of the Royal Society Council, it was\r\nhis duty to vote upon the persons to whom the yearly medals of the\r\nSociety should be awarded. For the Royal Medal first Hooker was named,\r\nand received his hearty support; then Forbes, in opposition to Hooker,\r\nin his eyes equally deserving of recognition, and almost more closely\r\nbound to him by ties of friendship, so that whatever action he took,\r\nmight be ascribed to motives which should have no part in such a\r\nselection. The course actually taken by him he explained at length in\r\nletters to both Forbes and Hooker.]\r\n\r\nNovember 6, 1854.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI have been so busy with lecturing here and there that I have not had\r\ntime to write and congratulate you on the award of the medal. The queer\r\nposition in which I was placed prevents me from being able to\r\ncongratulate MYSELF on having any finger in the pie, but I am quite sure\r\nthere was no member of the Council who felt more strongly than myself\r\nthat what honour the bauble could confer was most fully won, and no more\r\nthan your just deserts; or who rejoiced more when the thing was settled\r\nin your favour.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do trust that I shall never be placed in such an awkward\r\nposition again. I would have given a great deal to be able to back\r\nForbes tooth and nail--not only on account of my personal friendship and\r\naffection for him, but because I think he well deserves such\r\nrecognition. And had I thought right to do so, I felt sure that you\r\nwould have fully appreciated my motives, and that it would have done no\r\ninjury to our friendship.\r\n\r\nBut as I told the Council I did not think this a case where either of\r\nyou had any right to be excluded by the other. I told them that had\r\nForbes been first named, I should have thought it injudicious to bring\r\nyou forward, and that, as you were named, I for my own part should not\r\nhave brought forward Forbes as a candidate; that therefore while willing\r\nto speak up to any extent for Forbes' POSITIVE merits and deserts, I\r\nwould carefully be understood to give no opinion as to your and his\r\nRELATIVE standing.\r\n\r\nThey did not take much by my speech therefore either way, more\r\nespecially as I voted for BOTH of you.\r\n\r\nI hate doing anything of the kind \"unbeknownst\" to people, so there is\r\nthe exact history of my proceedings. If I had been able to come to the\r\nclear conclusion that the claims of either of you were strongly superior\r\nto those of the other, I think I should have had the honesty and moral\r\ncourage to \"act accordin',\" but I really had not, and so there was no\r\npart to play but that of a sort of Vicar of Bray.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[Forbes' reply was a letter which Huxley, after his friend's death,\r\nheld] \"among his most precious possessions.\" [It appeared without names\r\nin the obituary notice of Forbes in the \"Literary Gazette\" for November\r\n25, 1854, as an example of his unselfish generosity:--\r\n\r\nI heartily concur in the course you have taken, and had I been placed as\r\nyou have been, would have done exactly the same...Your way of proceeding\r\nwas as true an act of friendship as any that could be performed. As to\r\nmyself, I dream so little about medals, that the notion of being on the\r\nlist never entered my brain, even when asleep. If it ever comes I shall\r\nbe pleased and thankful; if it does not, it is not the sort of thing to\r\nbreak my equanimity. Indeed, I would always like to see it given not as\r\na mere honour, but as a help to a good man, and this it is assuredly in\r\nHooker's case. Government people are so ignorant that they require to\r\nhave merits drummed into their heads by all possible means, and Hooker's\r\ngetting the medal may be of real service to him before long. I am in a\r\nsnug, though not an idle nest,--he has not got his resting-place yet.\r\nAnd so, my dear Huxley, I trust that you know me too well to think that\r\nI am either grieved or envious, and you, Hooker, and I are much of the\r\nsame way of thinking.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to record the same scrupulosity over the election to\r\nthe Registrarship of the University of London in 1856, when, having\r\nbegun to canvass for Dr. Latham before his friend Dr. W.B. Carpenter\r\nentered the field, he writes to Hooker:--]\r\n\r\nI at once, of course told Carpenter precisely what I had done. Had I\r\nknown of his candidature earlier, I should certainly have taken no\r\nactive part on either side--not for Latham, because I would not oppose\r\nCarpenter, and not for Carpenter, because his getting the Registrarship\r\nwould probably be an advantage for me, as I should have a good chance of\r\nobtaining the Examinership in Physiology and Comparative Anatomy which\r\nhe would vacate. Indeed, I refused to act for Carpenter in a case in\r\nwhich he asked me to do so, partly for this reason and partly because I\r\nfelt thoroughly committed to Latham. Under these circumstances I think\r\nyou are quite absolved from any pledge to me. It's deuced hard to keep\r\nstraight in this wicked world, but as you say the only chance is to out\r\nwith it, and I thank you much for writing so frankly about the matter. I\r\nhope it will be as fine as to-day at Down. [(Charles Darwin's home in\r\nKent.)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the method was not so successful with smaller minds. Once\r\nin 1852, when he had to report unfavourably on a paper for the \"Annals\r\nof Natural History\" on the structure of the Starfishes, sent in by an\r\nacquaintance, he felt it right not to conceal his action, as he might\r\nhave done, behind the referee's usual screen of anonymity, but to write\r\na frank account of the reasons which had led him so to report, that he\r\nmight both clear himself of the suspicion of having dealt an unfair blow\r\nin the dark, and give his acquaintance the opportunity of correcting and\r\nenlarging his paper with a view of submitting it again for publication.\r\n\r\nIn this case the only result was an impassioned correspondence, the\r\nauthor even going so far as to suggest that Huxley had condemned the\r\npaper without having so much as dissected an Echinoderm in his life! and\r\nthen all intercourse ceased, till years afterwards the gentleman in\r\nquestion realised the weaknesses of his paper and repented him of his\r\nwrath.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving London to begin his work at Tenby as Naturalist to the\r\nSurvey, he delivered at St. Martin's Hall, on July 22, an address on the\r\n\"Educational Value of the Natural History Sciences. (The subsequent\r\nreference is to the words, \"I cannot but think that he who finds a\r\ncertain proportion of pain and evil inseparably woven up in the life of\r\nthe very worms will bear his own share with more courage and submission;\r\nand will, at any rate, view with suspicion those weakly amiable theories\r\nof the divine government, which would have us believe pain to be an\r\noversight and a mistake, to be corrected by and by.\" (\"Collected Essays\"\r\n3 page 62.) This essay contains the definition of science as \"trained\r\nand organised common sense,\" and the reference to a new \"Peter Bell\"\r\nwhich suggested Miss May Kendall's spirited parody of Wordsworth:--\r\n\r\n  Primroses by the river's brim\r\n  Dicotyledons were to him,\r\n  And they were nothing more.)\r\n\r\nThis, when it came out later as a pamphlet, he sent to his Tenby friend\r\nDr. Dyster (of whom hereafter), to whose criticism on one passage he\r\nreplied on October 10:--]\r\n\r\n...I am rejoiced you liked my speechment. It was written hastily and is,\r\nlike its speaker, I fear, more forcible than eloquent, but it can lay\r\nclaim to the merit of being sincere.\r\n\r\nMy intention on page 28 was by no means to express any satisfaction at\r\nthe worms being as badly off as ourselves, but to show that pain being\r\neverywhere is inevitable, and therefore like all other inevitable things\r\nto be borne. The rest of it is the product of my scientific Calvinism,\r\nwhich fell like a shell at your feet when we were talking over the fire.\r\n\r\nI doubt, or at least I have no confidence in, the doctrine of ultimate\r\nhappiness, and I am more inclined to look the opposite possibility fully\r\nin the face, and if that also be inevitable, make up my mind to bear it\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nYou will tell me there are better consolations than Stoicism; that may\r\nbe, but I do not possess them, and I have found my \"grin and bear it\"\r\nphilosophy stand me in such good stead in my course through oceans of\r\ndisgust and chagrin, that I should be loth to give it up.\r\n\r\n[The summer of 1854 was spent in company with the Busks at Tenby, amid\r\nplenty of open-air work and in great peace of mind, varied with a short\r\nvisit to Liverpool in order to talk business with his friend Forbes, who\r\nwas eager that Huxley should join him in Edinburgh.]\r\n\r\nTenby, South Wales, September 3, 1854.\r\n\r\nI have been here since the middle of August, getting rid of my yellow\r\nface and putting on a brown one, banishing dyspepsias and hypochondrias\r\nand all such other town afflictions to the four winds, and rejoicing\r\nexceedingly that I am out of the way of that pest, the cholera, which is\r\nraging just at present in London.\r\n\r\nAfter I had arranged to come here to do a lot of work of my own which\r\ncan only be done by the seaside, our Director, Sir Henry de la Beche,\r\ngave me a special mission of his own whereby I have the comfort of\r\nhaving my expenses paid, but at the same time get it taken out of me in\r\nadditional labour, so my recreation is anything but leisure.\r\n\r\nOctober 14.\r\n\r\nI left this place for a week's trip to Liverpool in the end of\r\nSeptember. The meeting of the British Association was held there, but I\r\nwent not so much to be present as to meet Forbes, with whom I wanted to\r\ntalk over many matters concerning us both. Forbes had a proposition that\r\nI should go to Edinburgh to take part of the duties of the Professor of\r\nPhysiology there, who is in bad health, with the ultimate aim of\r\nsucceeding to the chair. It was a tempting offer made in a flattering\r\nmanner, and presenting a prospect of considerably better emolument than\r\nmy special post, but it had the disadvantage of being but an uncertain\r\nposition. Had I accepted, I should have been at the mercy of the actual\r\nProfessor--and that is a position I don't like standing in, even with\r\nthe best of men, and had he died or resigned at any time the Scotch\r\nchairs are so disposed of that there would have been nothing like a\r\ncertainty of my getting the post, so I definitely declined--I hope\r\nwisely.\r\n\r\nAfter some talk, Forbes agreed with my view of the case, so he is off to\r\nEdinburgh, and I shall go off to London. I hope to remain there for my\r\nlife long.\r\n\r\n[He had long felt that London gave the best opportunities for a\r\nscientific career, and it was on his advice that Tyndall had left\r\nQueenwood College for the Royal Institution, where he was elected\r\nProfessor of Natural Philosophy in 1853:--]\r\n\r\n6 Upper York Place, St. John's Wood, February 25, 1853.\r\n\r\nMy dear Tyndall,\r\n\r\nHaving rushed into more responsibility than I wotted of, I have been\r\nruminating and taking counsel what advice to give you. When I wrote I\r\nhardly knew what kind of work you had in your present office, but\r\nFrancis has since enlightened me. I thought you had more leisure. One\r\nthing is very clear--you must come out of that. Your Pegasus is quite\r\nout of place ploughing. You are using yourself up in work that comes to\r\nnothing, and so far as I can see cannot be worse off.\r\n\r\nNow what are your prospects? Why, as I told you before, you have made a\r\nsucces here and must profit by it. The other night your name was\r\nmentioned at the Philosophical Club (the most influential scientific\r\nbody in London) with great praise. Gassiot, who has great influence,\r\nsaid in so many words, \"you had made your fortune,\" and I frankly tell\r\nyou I believe so too, if you can only get over the next three years. So\r\nyou see that quoad position, like Quintus Curtius, there is a \"fine\r\nopening\" ready for you, only mind you don't spoil it by any of your\r\nhorrid modesty.\r\n\r\nSo much for glory--now for economics. I have been trying to ferret out\r\nmore nearly your chances of a post, and here are my results (which, I\r\nneed not tell you, must be kept to yourself).\r\n\r\nAt the Museum in Jermyn Street, Playfair, Forbes, Percy and I think Sir\r\nHenry would do anything to get you, and eliminate --; but, so far as I\r\ncan judge, the probability of his going is so small that it is not worth\r\nyour while to reckon upon it. Nevertheless it may be comforting to you\r\nto know that in case of anything happening these men will help you tooth\r\nand nail. Cultivate Playfair when you have a chance--he is a good\r\nfellow, wishes you well, has great influence, and will have more. Entre\r\nnous, he has just got a new and important post under Government.\r\n\r\nNext, the Royal Institution. This is where, as I told you, you ought to\r\nbe looking to Faraday's place. Have no scruple about your chemical\r\nknowledge; you won't be required to train a college of students in\r\nabstruse analyses; and if you were, a year's work would be quite enough\r\nto put you at ease. What they want, and what you have, are CLEAR POWERS\r\nOF EXPOSITION--so clear that people may think they understand even if\r\nthey don't. That is the secret of Faraday's success, for not a tithe of\r\nthe people who go to hear him really understand him.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am afraid that a delay must occur before you can get placed\r\nat the Royal Institution, as you cannot hold the Professorship until you\r\nhave given a course of lectures there, and it would seem that there is\r\nno room for you this year. However, I must try and learn more about\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the London Institution looks tempting. I have\r\nbeen talking over the matter with Forbes, whose advice I look upon as\r\nfirst-rate in all these things, and he is decidedly of the opinion that\r\nyou should take the London Institution if it is offered you. He says\r\nthat lecturing there and lecturing at other Institutions, and writing,\r\nyou could with certainty make more than you at present receive, and that\r\nyou would have the command of a capital laboratory and plenty of time.\r\n\r\nThen as to position--of which I was doubtful--it appears that Grove has\r\nmade it a good one.\r\n\r\nIt is of great importance to look to this point in London--to be\r\nunshackled by anything that may prevent you taking the highest places,\r\nand it was only my fear on this head that made me advise you to hesitate\r\nabout the London Institution. More consideration leads me to say, take\r\nthat, if it will bring you up to London at once, so that you may hammer\r\nyour reputation while it is hot.\r\n\r\nHowever, consider all these things well, and don't be hasty. I will keep\r\neyes and ears open and inform you accordingly. Write to me if there is\r\nanything you want done, supposing always there is nobody who will do it\r\nbetter--which is improbable.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[But this year of victory was not to pass away without one last blow\r\nfrom fate. On November 18, Edward Forbes, the man in whom Huxley had\r\nfound a true friend and helper, inspired by the same ideals of truth and\r\nsincerity as himself, died suddenly at Edinburgh. The strong but\r\ndelicate ties that united them were based not merely upon intellectual\r\naffinity, but upon the deeper moral kinship of two strong characters,\r\nwhere each subordinated interest to ideal, and treated others by the\r\nmeasure of his own self-respect. As early as March 1851 he had\r\nwritten:--]\r\n\r\nI wish you knew my friend Professor Forbes. He is the best creature you\r\ncan imagine, and helps me in all manner of ways. A man of very great\r\nknowledge, he is wholly free from pedantry and jealousy, the two\r\nbesetting sins of literary and scientific men. Up to his eyes in work,\r\nhe never grudges his time if it is to help a friend. He is one of the\r\nfew men I have ever met to whom I can feel obliged, without losing a\r\nparticle of independence or self-respect.\r\n\r\n[The following from a letter to Hooker, announcing Forbes'death, is a\r\nstriking testimony to his worth:--]\r\n\r\nI think I have never felt so crushed by anything before. It is one of\r\nthose losses which cannot be replaced either to the private friend or to\r\nscience. To me especially it is a bitter loss. Without the aid and\r\nsympathy he has always given me from first to last, I should never have\r\nhad the courage to persevere in the course I have followed. And it was\r\none of my greatest hopes that we should work in harmony for long years\r\nat the aims so dear to us both.\r\n\r\nBut it is otherwise, and we who remain have nothing left but to bear the\r\ninevitable as we best may.\r\n\r\n[And again a few days later:--]\r\n\r\nI have had no time to write to you again till now, but I write to say\r\nhow perfectly you express my own feeling about our poor friend. One of\r\nthe first things I thought of was that medal business, and I never\r\nrejoiced in anything more than that I had not been deterred by any moral\r\ncowardice from acting as I did.\r\n\r\nAs it is I reckon that letter (which I will show you some day) among my\r\nmost precious possessions.\r\n\r\n[Huxley's last tribute to his dead friend was the organising a memorial\r\nfund, part of which went to getting a bust of him made, part to\r\nestablishing an Edward Forbes medal, to be competed for by the students\r\nof his old school in Jermyn Street.\r\n\r\nAs Huxley had been Forbes' successor at Jermyn Street, so now he seemed\r\nto many marked out to succeed him at Edinburgh. In November he writes to\r\nHooker:--]\r\n\r\nPeople have been at me about the Edinburgh chair. If I could contrive to\r\nstop here, between you and I, I would prefer it to half a dozen\r\nEdinburgh chairs, but there is a mortal difference between 200 and 1000\r\npounds sterling a year. I have written to say that if the Professors can\r\nmake up their minds they wish me to stand, I will--if not, I will not.\r\nFor my own part, I believe my chances would be very small, and I think\r\nthere is every probability of their dividing the chair, in which case I\r\ncertainly would not go. However, I hate thinking about the thing.\r\n\r\n[And also to his sister:--]\r\n\r\nNovember 26, 1854.\r\n\r\nMy dearest Lizzie,\r\n\r\nI feel I have been silent very long--a great deal too long--but you\r\nwould understand if you knew how much I have to do; why, with every\r\ndisposition to do otherwise, I now write hardly any but business\r\nletters. Even Nettie comes off badly I am afraid. When a man embarks as\r\nI have done, with nothing but his brains to back him, on the great sea\r\nof life in London, with the determination to MAKE the influence and the\r\nposition and the money which he hasn't got, you may depend upon it that\r\nthe fierce wants and interests of his present and immediate circle leave\r\nhim little time to think of anything else, whatever old loves and old\r\nmemories may be smouldering as warmly as ever below the surface. So,\r\nsister mine, you must not imagine because I do not write that therefore\r\nI do not think of you or care to know about you, but only that I am\r\neaten up with the zeal of my own house, and doing with all my heart the\r\nthing that the moment calls for.\r\n\r\nThe last year has been eventful for me. There is always a Cape Horn in\r\none's life that one either weathers or wrecks one's self on. Thank God I\r\nthink I may say I have weathered mine--not without a good deal of damage\r\nto spars and rigging though, for it blew deuced hard on the other side.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of this year my affairs came to a crisis. The\r\nGovernment, notwithstanding all the representations which were made to\r\nthem, would neither give nor refuse the grant for the publication of my\r\nwork, and by way of cutting short all further discussion the Admiralty\r\ncalled upon me to serve. A correspondence ensued, in which, as commonly\r\nhappens in these cases, they got the worst of it in logic and words, and\r\nI in reality and \"tin.\" They answered my syllogism by the irrelevant and\r\nabsurd threat of stopping my pay if I did not serve at once. Here was a\r\npretty business! However, it was no use turning back when so much had\r\nbeen sacrificed for one's end, so I put their Lordships' letter up on my\r\nmantelpiece and betook myself to scribbling for my bread. They, on the\r\nother hand, removed my name from the List. So there was an interregnum\r\nwhen I was no longer in Her Majesty's service. I had already joined the\r\n\"Westminster Review,\" and had inured myself to the labour of\r\ntranslation--and I could get any amount of scientific work I wanted--so\r\nthere was a living, though a scanty one, and amazingly hard work for it.\r\nMy pen is not a very facile one, and what I write costs me a good deal\r\nof trouble.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of this year, however, a door opened. My poor lost friend\r\nProfessor Forbes--whose steady attachment and aid had always been of the\r\nutmost service to me--was called to fill the chair of Natural History in\r\nEdinburgh at a moment's notice. It is a very valuable appointment, and\r\nhe was obliged to fill it at once. Of course he left a number of\r\nvacancies behind, among them one at the Government School of Mines in\r\nJermyn Street, where he lectured on Natural History. I was called upon\r\nto take up his lectures where he left off, in the same sudden way, and\r\nthe upshot of it all was that I became permanently attached--with 200\r\npounds sterling a year pay. In other ways I can make a couple of hundred\r\na year more even now, and I hope by-and-by to do better. In fact, a\r\nmarried man, as I hope soon to be, cannot live at all in the position\r\nwhich I ought to occupy under less than six hundred a year. If I keep my\r\nhealth, however, I have every hope of being able to do this--but, as the\r\njockeys say, the pace is severe. Nettie is coming over in the spring,\r\nand if I have any luck at all, I mean to have paid off my debts and to\r\nbe married by this time next year. ([He writes on July 21, 1851:--]\"I\r\ncommenced life upon nothing at all, and I had to borrow in the ordinary\r\nway from an agent for the necessary expenses of my outfit. I sent home a\r\ngreat deal of money, but notwithstanding, from the beautiful way they\r\nhave of accumulating interest and charges of one description and\r\nanother, I found myself 100 pounds sterling in debt when I\r\nreturned--besides something to my brother, about which, however, I do\r\nnot suppose I need trouble myself just at present. As you may imagine,\r\nliving in London, my pay now hardly keeps me, to say nothing of paying\r\noff my old scores. I could get no account of how things were going on\r\nwith my agent while I was away,and therefore I never could tell exactly\r\nhow I stood.\")\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, strangely enough--and very painfully for me--new\r\npossibilities have sprung up. My poor friend Forbes died only a week\r\nago, just as he was beginning his course and entering upon as brilliant\r\na career as ever was opened to any scientific man in this country.\r\n\r\nI cannot tell you how deeply this has shocked me. I owe him so much, I\r\nloved him so well, and I have so very very few friends in the true sense\r\nof the word, that it has been perhaps a greater loss to me than to any\r\none--although there never was a man so widely lamented. One could trust\r\nhim so thoroughly! However, he has gone, poor fellow, and there is\r\nnothing for it but to shut one's self up again--and I was only going to\r\nsay that his death leaves his post vacant, and I have been strongly\r\nurged to become a candidate for it by several of the most influential\r\nEdinburgh Professors. I am greatly puzzled what to do. I do not want to\r\nleave London, nor do I think much of my own chances of success if I\r\nbecome a candidate--though others do. On the other hand, a stipend which\r\nvaries between 800 and 1200 pounds sterling a year is not to be\r\npooh-poohed.\r\n\r\nWe shall see. If I can carry out some arrangements which are pending\r\nwith the Government to increase my pay to 400 pounds sterling a year, I\r\nshall be strongly tempted to stop in London. It is THE place, the centre\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, as things always do come in heaps, I obtained my\r\nlong-fought-for Grant--though indirectly--from the Government, which is,\r\nI think, a great triumph and vindication of the family motto--tenax\r\npropositi. Like many long-sought-for blessings, however, it is rather a\r\nbore now that I have it, as I don't see how I am to find time to write\r\nthe book. But things \"do themselves\" in a wonderful way. I'll tell you\r\nhow many irons I have in the fire at this present moment:--(1) a manual\r\nof Comparative Anatomy for Churchill; (2) my \"Grant\" book; (3) a book\r\nfor the British Museum people (half done); (4) an article for Todd's\r\n\"Cyclopaedia\" (half done); (5) sundry memoirs on Science; (6) a regular\r\nQuarterly article in the \"Westminster\"; (7) lectures at Jermyn Street in\r\nthe School of Mines; (8) lectures at the School of Art, Marlborough\r\nHouse; (9) lectures at the London Institution, and odds and ends. Now,\r\nmy dearest Lizzie, whenever you feel inclined to think it unkind I don't\r\nwrite, just look at that list, and remember that all these things\r\nrequire strenuous attention and concentration of the faculties, and\r\nleave one not very fit for anything else. You will say that it is bad to\r\nbe so entirely absorbed in these things, and to that I heartily say\r\nAmen!--but you might as well argue with a man who has just mounted the\r\nfavourite for the \"Oaks\" that it is a bad thing to ride fast. He admits\r\nthat, and is off like a shot when the bell rings nevertheless. My bell\r\nhas rung some time, and thank God the winning post is in sight.\r\n\r\nGive my kindest regards to the doctor and special love to all the\r\nchildren. I send a trifle for my godson and some odds and ends in the\r\nbook line, among other things a Shakespeare for yourself, dear Liz.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, ever your affectionate brother,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[In December the Edinburgh chair was practically offered to him\r\nundivided; but by that time the London authorities thought they had\r\nbetter make it worth his while to stay at Jermyn Street, and with\r\nnegotiations begun for this end he refused to stand for Edinburgh. In\r\nthe following spring, however, he was again approached from\r\nEdinburgh--not so much to withdraw his refusal and again become a\r\ncandidate, as to let it be made known that he would accept the chair if\r\nit were offered him. But his position in London was now established; and\r\nhe preferred to live in London on a bare sufficiency rather than to\r\nenjoy a larger income away from the centre of things.\r\n\r\nTwo letters to Tyndall, which refer to the division of labour in the\r\nscience reviews for the \"Westminster,\" indicate very clearly the high\r\npressure at which Huxley had already begun to work:--]\r\n\r\nTenby, South Wales, October 22, 1854.\r\n\r\nMy dear Tyndall,\r\n\r\nI was rejoiced to find you entertaining my proposition at all. No one\r\nbelieves how hard you work more than I, but I was not going to be such a\r\nbad diplomatist as to put that at the head of my letter, and if I had\r\nthought that what I want you to do involved any great accession thereto,\r\nI think I could not have mustered up the face to ask you. But really and\r\ntruly, so long as it is confined to our own department it is no great\r\naffair. You make me laugh at the long face you pull about the duties,\r\nbased on my phrase. The fact is, you notice what you like, and what you\r\ndo not you leave undone, unless you get an editorial request to say\r\nsomething about a particular book. The whole affair is entirely in your\r\nown hands--at least it is in mine--as I went upon my principle of having\r\na row at starting...\r\n\r\nNow here is an equitable proposition. Look at my work. I have a couple\r\nof monographs, odds and ends of papers for journals, a manual and some\r\nthree courses of lectures to provide for this winter. \"My necessities\r\nare as great as thine,\" as Sir Philip Sidney didn't say, so be a brick,\r\nsplit the difference, and say you will be ready for the April number. I\r\nwill write and announce the fact to Chapman.\r\n\r\nWhat idiots we all are to toil and slave at this pace. I almost repent\r\nme of tempting you--after all--so I promise to hold on if you really\r\nthink you will be overdoing it.\r\n\r\nWith you I envy Francis his gastric energies. I feel I have done for\r\nmyself in that line, and am in for a life-long dyspeps. I have not, now,\r\nnervous energy enough for stomach and brain both, and if I work the\r\nlatter, not even the fresh breezes of this place will keep the former in\r\norder. That is a discovery I have made here, and though highly\r\ninstructive, it is not so pleasant as some other physiological results\r\nthat have turned up.\r\n\r\nChapman, who died of cholera, was a distant relative of my man. The poor\r\nfellow vanished in the middle of an unfinished article, which has\r\nappeared in the last \"Westminster,\" as his forlorn vale! to the world.\r\nAfter all, that is the way to die, better a thousand times than\r\ndrivelling off into eternity betwixt awake and asleep in a fatuous old\r\nage.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, ever yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[On Tyndall consenting, he wrote again on the 29th:--]\r\n\r\nI rejoice in having got you to put your head under my yoke, and feel\r\nready to break into a hand gallop on the strength of it.\r\n\r\nI have written to Chapman to tell him you only make an experiment on\r\nyour cerebral substance--whose continuance depends on tenacity thereof.\r\n\r\nI didn't suspect you of being seduced by the magnificence of the\r\nemolument, you Cincinnatus of the laboratory. I only suggested that as\r\npay sweetens labour, a fortiori it will sweeten what to you will be no\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\nI'm not a miserable mortal now--quite the contrary. I never am when I\r\nhave too much to do, and my sage reflection was not provoked by envy of\r\nthe more idle. Only I do wish I could sometimes ascertain the exact\r\njuste milieu of work which will suit, not my head or will, THESE can't\r\nhave too much; but my absurd stomach.\r\n\r\n[The Edinburgh candidature, the adoption of his wider scheme for the\r\ncarrying out of the coast survey, and his approaching marriage, are\r\ntouched upon in the following letters to Dr. Frederick Dyster of Tenby,\r\nwhose keen interest in marine zoology was the starting-point of a warm\r\nfriendship with the rising naturalist, some fifteen years his junior.\r\n(It was to Dyster that Huxley owed his introduction in 1854 to F.D.\r\nMaurice (whose work in educating the people he did his best to help),\r\nand later to Charles Kingsley, whom he first met at the end of June\r\n1855.] \"What Kingsley do you refer to?\" [he writes on May 6,] \"ALTON\r\nLOCKE Kingsley or Photographic Kingsley? I shall be right glad to find\r\ngood men and true anywhere, and I will take your bail for any man. But\r\nthe work must be critically done.\") [He was strongly urged by the\r\nyounger man to complete and systematise his observations by taking in\r\nturn all the species of each genus of annelids found at Tenby, and\r\nworking them up into a series of little monographs] \"which would be the\r\nbest of all possible foundations for a History of the British\r\nAnnelidae\":--\r\n\r\nTo Dr. Dyster.\r\n\r\nJanuary 5, 1855\r\n\r\n[He begins by confessing \"a considerable liberty\" he had been taking\r\nwith Dyster's name, in calling a joint discovery of this, which he\r\ndescribed in the \"Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal,\" Protula\r\nDysteri.]\r\n\r\nAre you very savage? If so, you must go and take a walk along the sands\r\nand see the slant rays of the sunset tipping the rollers as they break\r\non the beach; that always made even ME at peace with all the world, and\r\na fortiori it will you.\r\n\r\nTruly, I wish I had any such source of consolation. Chimney pots are\r\nhighly injurious to my morals, and my temper is usually in proportion to\r\nthe extent of my horizon.\r\n\r\nI have been swallowing oceans of disgust lately. All sorts of squabbles,\r\nsome made by my own folly and others by the malice of other people, and\r\nno great sea and sky to go out under, and be alone and forget it all.\r\n\r\nYou may have seen my name advertised by Reeve as about to write a memoir\r\nof poor Forbes, to be prefixed to a collection of his essays. I found\r\nthat to be a mere bookseller's dodge on Reeve's part, and when I made\r\nthe discovery, of course we had a battle-royal, and I have now wholly\r\nwithdrawn from it.\r\n\r\nI find, however, that one's kind and generous friends imagine it was an\r\nelectioneering manoeuvre on my part for Edinburgh. Imagine how\r\nsatisfactory. I forget whether I told you that I had been asked to stand\r\nfor Edinburgh and have done so. Whether I shall be appointed or not I do\r\nnot know. So far as my own wishes go, I am in a curiously balanced state\r\nof mind about it. Many things make it a desirable post, but I dread\r\nleaving London and its freedom--its Bedouin sort of life--for Edinburgh\r\nand no whistling on Sundays. Besides, if I go there, I shall have to\r\ngive up all my coast-survey plans, and all their pleasant concomitants.\r\n\r\nApropos of Edinburgh I feel much like the Irish hod-man who betted his\r\nfellow he could not carry him up to the top of a house in his hod. The\r\nman did it, but Pat turning round as he was set down on the roof, said,\r\n\"Ye've done it, sure enough, but, bedad, I'd great hopes ye'd let me\r\nfall about three rounds from the top.\" Bedad, I'm nearly at the top of\r\nthe Scotch ladder, but I've hopes.\r\n\r\nIt is finally settled that the chair will not be divided. I told them\r\nfrankly I would not go if it were.\r\n\r\nHas Highly sent your books yet?\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, February 13, 1855.\r\n\r\nMy dear Dyster,\r\n\r\n...I will do my best to help--to some alumni if the chance comes in my\r\nway, though, as you say, I don't like him. I can't help it. I respect\r\npiety, and hope I have some after my own fashion, but I have a profound\r\nprejudice against the efflorescent form of it. I never yet found in\r\npeople thoroughly imbued with that pietism, the same notions of honour\r\nand straightforwardness that obtain among men of the world. It may be\r\notherwise with --, but I can't help my pagan prejudice. So don't judge\r\nharshly of me there-anent.\r\n\r\nAbout Edinburgh, I have been going to write to you for days past. I have\r\ndecided on withdrawing from the candidature, and have done so. In fact\r\nthe more I thought of it the less I liked it. They require nine months'\r\nlectures some four or five times a week, which would have thoroughly\r\nused me up, and completely put a stop to anything like original work;\r\nand then there was a horrid museum to be arranged, work I don't care\r\nabout, and which would have involved an amount of intriguing and\r\nheart-burning, and would have required an amount of diplomacy to carry\r\nto a successful issue, for which my temper and disposition are wholly\r\nunfitted.\r\n\r\nAnd then I felt above all things that it was for me an imposture. Here\r\nhave I been fighting and struggling for years, sacrificing everything to\r\nbe a man of science, a genuine worker, and if I had obtained the\r\nEdinburgh chair, I should have been in reality a mere pedagogue and a\r\nman of science only in name. Such were my notions, and if I hesitated at\r\nall and allowed myself to become a candidate, it was only because I have\r\nother interests to consult than my own. Intending to \"range myself\" one\r\nof these days and become a respectable member of society, I was bound to\r\nconsider my material interests. And so I should have been still a\r\ncandidate for Edinburgh had not the Government here professed themselves\r\nunwilling to lose my services, adding the \"material guarantee\" of an\r\naddition to my income, which, though by no means bringing it up to the\r\npoint of Edinburgh, will still enable me (das heisst \"us\") to live\r\ncomfortably here.\r\n\r\nI must renounce the \"pomps and vanities,\" but all those other \"lusts of\r\nthe flesh\" which may beseem a gentleman may be reasonably gratified.\r\n\r\nDon't you think I have been wise in my Hercules choice? After all I\r\ndon't lay claim to any great merit, seeing it was anything but certain I\r\nshould get Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nThe best of all is that I have every reason to believe that Government\r\nwill carry out my scheme for a coast survey, so happily and pleasantly\r\nbegun at Tenby last year.\r\n\r\nThe final arrangements are almost complete, and I believe you may make\r\nup your mind to have four months of me next year. Tenby shall be\r\nimmortalised and Jenkyn converted into a philosopher. [Jenkyn was\r\nemployed to collect shells, etc., at Tenby. He is often alluded to as\r\n\"the Professor.\"] By the way, I think the best way would be to retain\r\nthe shells till I come. My main purpose is to have in them a catalogue\r\nof what Tenby affords.\r\n\r\nPray give my kind remembrances to Mrs. Dyster, and believe me, ever\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nApril 1, 1855.\r\n\r\nMy dear Dyster,\r\n\r\nBy all that's good, your last note, which lies before me, has date a\r\nmonth ago. I looked at it just now, and became an April fool on the\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nAll the winds of March, however, took their course through my thorax and\r\neventuated in lectures. At least that is all the account I can give to\r\nmyself of the time, and an unprofitable account it is, for everything\r\nbut one's exchequer.\r\n\r\nSo far as knowledge goes it is mere prodigality spending one's capital\r\nand adding nothing, for I find the physical exertion of lecturing quite\r\nunfits me for much else. Fancy how last Friday was spent. I went to\r\nJermyn Street in the morning with the intention of preparing for my\r\nafternoon's lecture. People came talking to me up to within a quarter of\r\nan hour of the time, so I had to make a dash without preparation. Then I\r\nhad to go home to prepare for a second lecture in the evening, and after\r\nthat I went to a soiree, and got home about one o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nI go on telling myself this won't do, but to no purpose.\r\n\r\nYou will be glad to hear that my affairs here are finally settled, and I\r\nam regularly appointed an officer of the survey with the commission to\r\nwork out the natural history of the coast.\r\n\r\nEdinburgh has been tempting me again, and in fact I believe I was within\r\nan ace of going there, but the Government definitely offering me this\r\nposition, I was too glad to stop where I am.\r\n\r\nI can make six hundred a year here, and that being the case, I conceive\r\nI have a right to consult my own inclinations and the interest of my\r\nscientific reputation. The coast survey puts in my hands the finest\r\nopportunities that ever a man had, and it is a pity if I do not make\r\nmyself something better than a Caledonian pedagogue.\r\n\r\nThe great first scheme I have in connection with my new post is to work\r\nout the Marine Natural History of Britain, and to have every species of\r\nsea beast properly figured and described in the reports which I mean\r\nfrom time to time to issue. I can get all the engravings and all the\r\nprinting I want done, but of course I am not so absurd as to suppose I\r\ncan work out all these things myself. Therefore my notion is to seek in\r\nall highways and byways for fellow labourers. Busk will, I hope, supply\r\nme with figures and descriptions of the British Polyzoa and Hydrozoa,\r\nand I have confidence in my friend, Mr. Dyster of Tenby (are you\r\npresumptuous enough to say you know him?) for the Annelids, if he won't\r\nobject to that mode of publishing his work. The Mollusks, the\r\nCrustaceans, and the Fishes, the Echinoderms and the Worms, will give\r\nplenty of occupation to the other people, myself included, to say\r\nnothing of distribution and of the recent geological changes, all of\r\nwhich come within my programme.\r\n\r\nDid I not tell you it was a fine field, and could the land o' cakes give\r\nme any scope like this?\r\n\r\nApril 9, 1855.\r\n\r\nMy dear Dyster,\r\n\r\nI didn't by any means mean to be so sphinx-like in my letter, though you\r\nhave turned out an Oedipus of the first water. True it is that I mean to\r\n\"range myself,\" \"live cleanly and leave off sack,\" within the next few\r\nmonths--that is to say, if nothing happens to the good ship which is at\r\npresent bearing my fiancee homewards.\r\n\r\nSo far as a restless mortal--more or less aweary of most things--like\r\nmyself can be made happy by any other human being, I believe your good\r\nwishes are safe of realisation; at any rate, it will be my fault if they\r\nare not, and I beg you never to imagine that I could confound the piety\r\nof friendship with the \"efflorescent\" variety.\r\n\r\nI hope to marry in July, and make my way down to Tenby shortly\r\nafterwards, and I am ready to lay you a wager that your vaticinations\r\ntouching the amount of work that WON'T be done don't come true.\r\n\r\nSo much for wives--now for WORMS--(I could not for the life of me help\r\nthe alliteration). I, as right reverend father in worms and Bishop of\r\nAnnelidae, do not think I ought to interfere with my most promising son,\r\nwhen a channel opens itself for the publication of his labours. So do\r\nwhat you will apropos of J--. If he does not do the worms any better\r\nthan he did the zoophytes, he won't interfere with my plans.\r\n\r\nI shall be glad to see Mrs. Buckland's Echinoderm. I think it must be a\r\nnovelty by what you say. She is a very jolly person, but I have an\r\nunutterable fear of scientific women.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nMay 6, 1855.\r\n\r\nMy ship is not come home but is coming, and I have been in a state of\r\ndesperation at the continuous east winds. However, to-day there is a\r\nwesterly gale, and if it lasts I shall have news soon. You may imagine\r\nthat I am in an unsatisfactory state of mind between this and lecturing\r\nfive times a week.\r\n\r\nI beg to say that the \"goods\" I expect are home produce this\r\ntransplanted (or sent a voyage as you do Madeira), and not foreign\r\ngrowth by any means. But it is five years since we met, I am another man\r\naltogether, and if my wife be as much altered, we shall need a new\r\nintroduction. Correspondence, however active, is a poor substitute for\r\npersonal communication and tells one but little of the inner life.\r\n\r\n[Finally, on the eve of his marriage in July, Tyndall congratulates him\r\non being appointed to deliver the next course of Fullerian Lectures at\r\nthe Royal Institution:--\r\n\r\nThe fates once seemed to point to our connection in a distant land: we\r\nare now colleagues at home, and I can claim you as my scientific\r\nbrother. May the gods continue to drop fatness upon you, and may your\r\nnext great step be productive of all the felicity which your warmest\r\nfriends or your own rebellious heart can desire.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.9.\r\n\r\n1855.\r\n\r\nMiss Heathorn and her parents reached England at the beginning of May\r\n1855, and took up their abode at 8 Titchfield Terrace, not far from\r\nHuxley's own lodgings and his brothers' house. One thing, however,\r\nfilled Huxley with dismay. Miss Heathorn's health had broken down\r\nutterly, and she looked at death's door. All through the preceding year\r\nshe had been very ill; she had gone with friends, Mr. and Mrs. Wise, to\r\nthe newly opened mining-camp at Bathurst, and she and Mrs. Wise were\r\nindeed the first women to visit it; returning to Sydney after rather a\r\nrough time, she caught a chill, and being wrongly treated by a doctor of\r\nthe blood-letting, calomel-dosing school, she was reduced to a shadow,\r\nand only saved by another practitioner, who reversed the treatment just\r\nin time.\r\n\r\nIn his letters to her, Huxley had not at first realised the danger she\r\nhad been in; and afterwards tried to keep her spirits up by a cheerful\r\noptimism that would only look forward to their joyful union and many\r\nyears of unbroken happiness to atone for their long parting.\r\n\r\nBut the reality alarmed him. He took her to one of the most famous\r\ndoctors of the day, as if merely a patient he was interested in. Then as\r\none member of the profession to another, he asked him privately his\r\nopinion of the case. \"I give her six months of life,\" said Aesculapius.]\r\n\"Well, six months or not,\" [replied Huxley,] \"she is going to be my\r\nwife.\" [The doctor was mightily put out. \"You ought to have told me that\r\nbefore.\" Of course, the evasive answer in such a contingency was\r\nprecisely what Huxley wished to avoid. Happily another leading doctor\r\nheld a much more favourable opinion, and said that with care her\r\nstrength would come back, slowly but surely.]\r\n\r\n14 Waverley Place, Wednesday.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nMy wife and I met again on Sunday last, and I have established herself,\r\nher father and mother, close by me here at 8 Titchfield Terrace,\r\nRegent's Park, and whenever you and Mrs. Hooker are in this part of the\r\nworld, and can find time to call there, you will find her anything but\r\nsurprised to see you.\r\n\r\nGod help me! I discover that I am as bad as any young fool who knows no\r\nbetter, and if the necessity for giving six lectures a week did not\r\nsternly interfere, I should be hanging about her ladyship's\r\napron-strings all day. She is in very bad health, poor child, and I have\r\nsome reason to be anxious, but I have every hope she will mend with\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nOh this life! \"atra cura,\" as old Thackeray has it, sits on all our\r\nbacks and mingles with all our happiness. But if I go on talking in this\r\nway you will wonder what has come over my philosophership.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[Black Care was still in the background, but had relaxed her hold upon\r\nhim. His spirits rose to the old point of gaiety. He writes how he gives\r\na lively lecture to his students, and in the midst of it satan prompts\r\nhim to crow or howl--a temptation happily resisted. He makes atrocious\r\npuns in bidding Hooker to the wedding, which took place on July 21.]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, July 6, 1855.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI ought long since to have thanked you in Thomson's name as well as my\r\nown for your \"Flora Indica.\" Some day I promise myself much pleasure and\r\nprofit from the digestion of the Introductory Essay, which is probably\r\nas much as my gizzard is competent to convert into nutrition.\r\n\r\nI terminate my Baccalaureate and take my degree of M.A.-trimony (isn't\r\nthat atrocious?) on Saturday, July 21. After the unhappy criminals have\r\nbeen turned off, there will be refreshments provided for the sheriffs,\r\nchaplain, and spectators. Will you come? Don't if it is a bore, but I\r\nshould much like to have you there.\r\n\r\n[It was not a large party that assembled at the George Huxleys for the\r\nwedding, but all were life-long friends, including, besides the Fanning\r\nclan and Mrs. Griffiths, an old Australian ally, Hooker, Tyndall, and\r\nDr. and Mrs. Carpenter. There was none present but felt that abundant\r\nhappiness was at least well earned after eight years of trial, and still\r\nmore that its best guarantee was the firm loyalty and devotion that had\r\npassed through so many dangers of absence and isolation, so many\r\ntemptations to renounce the ideal course under stress of circumstance,\r\nonly to emerge strengthened and ennobled by the stern discipline of much\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\nGreat as was his new happiness, he hardly stood in need of Darwin's word\r\nof warning: \"I hope your marriage will not make you idle; happiness, I\r\nfear, is not good for work.\" Huxley could not sit idle for long. If he\r\nhad no occupation on hand, something worth investigation--and thorough\r\ninvestigation--was sure to catch his eye. So he writes to Hooker from\r\nTenby:--]\r\n\r\n15 St. Julian's Terrace, Tenby, August 16, 1855.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI am so near the end of the honeymoon that I think it can hardly be\r\nimmodest if I emerge from private life and write you a letter, more\r\nparticularly as I want to know something. I went yesterday on an\r\nexpedition to see the remains of a forest which exists between tidemarks\r\nat a place called Amroth, near here.\r\n\r\nSo far as I can judge there can be no doubt that this really is a case\r\nof downward movement. The stools of the trees are in their normal\r\nposition, and their roots are embedded and interwoven in a layer of\r\nstiff blue clay, which lies immediately beneath the superficial mud of\r\nthe shore. Layers of leaves, too, are mixed up with the clay in other\r\nparts, and the bark of some of the trees is in perfect preservation. The\r\ncondition of the wood is very curious. It is like very hard cheese, so\r\nthat you can readily cut slices with a spade, and yet where more of the\r\ntrunk has been preserved some parts are very hard. The trees are, I\r\nfancy, Beech and Oak. Could you identify slices if I were to send you\r\nsome?\r\n\r\nNow it seems to me that here is an opportunity one does not often have\r\nof getting some information about the action of sea water on wood, and\r\non the mode in which these vegetable remains may become embedded, etc.\r\netc., and I want to get you to tell me where I can find information on\r\nsubmerged forests in general, so as to see to what points one can best\r\ndirect one's attention, and to suggest any inquiries that may strike\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nI do not see how the stumps can occur in this position without direct\r\nsinking of the land, and that such a sinking should have occurred\r\ntallies very well with some other facts which I have observed as to the\r\nnature of the bottom at considerable depths here.\r\n\r\nWe had the jolliest cruise in the world by Oxford, Warwick, Kenilworth,\r\nStratford, Malvern, Ross, and the Wye though it WAS a little rainy, and\r\nthough my wife's strength sadly failed at times.\r\n\r\nStill she was on the whole much better and stronger than I had any right\r\nto expect, and although I get frightened every now and then, yet there\r\ncan be no doubt that she is steadily though slowly improving. I have no\r\nfears for the ultimate result, but her amendment will be a work of time.\r\nWe have really quite settled down into Darby and Joan, and I begin to\r\nregard matrimony as the normal state of man. It's wonderful how light\r\nthe house looks when I come back weary with a day's boating to what it\r\nused to do.\r\n\r\nI hope Mrs. Hooker is well and about again. Pray give her our very kind\r\nregards, and believe me, my dear Hooker, ever yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[At Tenby he stayed on through August and September, continuing his\r\noccupations of the previous summer, dredging up specimens for his\r\nmicroscope, and working partly for his own investigations, partly for\r\nthe Geological Survey.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.10.\r\n\r\n1855-1858.\r\n\r\nUp to his appointment at the School of Mines, Huxley's work had been\r\nalmost entirely morphological, dealing with the Invertebrates. His first\r\ninvestigations, moreover, had been directed not to species-hunting, but\r\nto working out the real affinities of little known orders, and thereby\r\nevolving a philosophical classification from the limbo of \"Vermes\" and\r\n\"Radiata.\"\r\n\r\nHe had continued the same work by tracing homologies of development in\r\nother classes of animals, such as the Cephalous Mollusca, the\r\nArticulata, and the Brachiopods. On these subjects, also, he had a good\r\ndeal of correspondence with other investigators of the same cast of\r\nmind, and even when he did not carry conviction, the impression made by\r\nhis arguments may be judged from the words of Dr. Allman, no mean\r\nauthority, in a letter of May 2, 1852:--]\r\n\r\nI have thought over your arguments again and again, and while I am the\r\nmore convinced of their ingenuity, originality, and STRENGTH, I yet feel\r\nashamed to confess that I too must exclaim \"tenax propositi.\" When was\r\nit otherwise in controversy?\r\n\r\n[Other speculations arising out of these researches had been given to\r\nthe public in the form of lectures, notably that on Animal Individuality\r\nat the Royal Institution in 1852.\r\n\r\nBut after 1854, Paleontology and administrative work began to claim much\r\nof the time he would willingly have bestowed upon distinctly zoological\r\nresearch. His lectures on Natural History of course demanded a good deal\r\nof first-hand investigation, and not only occasional notes in his\r\nfragmentary journals, but a vast mass of drawings now preserved at South\r\nKensington attest the amount of work he still managed to give to these\r\nsubjects. But with the exception of the Hunterian Lectures of 1868, he\r\nonly published one paper on Invertebrates as late as 1860; and only half\r\na dozen, not counting the belated \"Oceanic Hydrozoa,\" bear 1856 and\r\n1859. The essay on the Crayfish did not appear until after he had left\r\nJermyn Street and Paleontology for South Kensington.\r\n\r\nThe \"Method of Paleontology,\" published in 1856, was the first of a long\r\nseries of papers dealing with fossil creatures, the description of which\r\nfell to him as Naturalist to the Geological Survey. By 1860 he had\r\npublished twelve such papers, and by 1871 twenty-six more, or\r\nthirty-eight in sixteen years.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious irony of fate that led him into this position. He\r\nwrites in his Autobiography that, when Sir Henry de la Beche, the\r\nDirector-General of the Geological Survey, offered him the post Forbes\r\nvacated of Paleontologist and Lecturer on Natural History,]\r\n\r\nI refused the former point blank, and accepted the latter only\r\nprovisionally, telling Sir Henry that I did not care for fossils, and\r\nthat I should give up Natural History as soon as I could get a\r\nphysiological post. But I held the office for thirty-one years, and a\r\nlarge part of my work has been paleontological.\r\n\r\n[Yet the diversion was not without great use. A wide knowledge of\r\npaleontology offered a key to many problems that were hotly debated in\r\nthe years of battle following the publication of the \"Origin of Species\"\r\nin 1859, as well as providing fresh subject-matter for the lectures in\r\nwhich he continued to give the lay world the results of his thought.\r\n\r\nOn the administrative and official side he laid before himself the\r\norganisation of the resources of the Museum of Practical Geology as an\r\neducational instrument. This involved several years' work in the\r\narrangement of the specimens, so as to illustrate the paleontological\r\nlectures, and the writing of \"introductions\" to each section of the\r\ncatalogue, which should be a guide to the students. The \"Method of\r\nPaleontology\" mentioned above served as the prefatory essay to the whole\r\ncatalogue, and was reprinted in 1869 by the Smithsonian Institute of\r\nWashington under the title of \"Principles and Methods of Paleontology.\"\r\n\r\nThis work led to his taking a lively interest in the organisation of\r\nmuseums in general, whether private, such as Sir Philip Egerton's, which\r\nhe visited in 1856; local, such as Warwick or Chester; or central, such\r\nas the British Museum or that at Manchester.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the British Museum, the question had arisen of removing\r\nthe Natural History collections from the confined space and dusty\r\nsurroundings of Great Russell Street. A first memorial on the subject\r\nhad been signed, not only by many non-scientific persons, but also by a\r\nnumber of botanists, who wished to see the British Museum Herbarium,\r\netc., combined with the more accessible and more complete collections at\r\nKew. Owing apparently to official opposition, the Natural History\r\nsub-committee of the British Museum Trustees advised a treatment of the\r\nBotanical Department which commended itself to none of the leading\r\nbotanists. Consequently a number of botanists and zoologists took\r\ncounsel together and drew up a fresh memorial from the strictly\r\nscientific point of view. Huxley and Hooker took an active part in the\r\nagitation.] \"It is no use,\" [writes the former to his friend,] \"putting\r\nany faith in the old buffers, hardened as they are in trespasses and\r\nsin.\" [And again:--]\r\n\r\nI see nothing for it but for you and I to constitute ourselves into a\r\npermanent \"Committee of Public Safety,\" to watch over what is being done\r\nand take measures with the advice of others when necessary...As for --\r\nand id genus omne, I have never expected anything but opposition from\r\nthem. But I don't think it is necessary to trouble one's head about such\r\nopposition. It may be annoying and troublesome, but if we are beaten by\r\nit we deserve to be. With shall have to wade through oceans of trouble\r\nand abuse, but so long as we gain our end, I care not a whistle whether\r\nthe sweet voices of the scientific mob are with me or against me.\r\n\r\n[According to Huxley's views a complete system demanded a triple museum\r\nfor each subject, Zoology and Botany, since Geology was sufficiently\r\nprovided for in Jermyn Street--one typical or popular, \"in which all\r\nprominent forms or types of animals or plants, recent or fossil, should\r\nbe so displayed as to give the public an idea of the vast extent and\r\nvariety of natural objects, to diffuse a general knowledge of the\r\nresults obtained by science in their investigation and classification,\r\nand to serve as a general introduction to the student in Natural\r\nScience\"; the second scientific, \"in which collections of all available\r\nanimals and plants and their parts, whether recent or fossil, and in a\r\nsufficient number of specimens, should be disposed conveniently for\r\nstudy, and to which should be exclusively attached an appropriate\r\nlibrary, or collection of books and illustrations relating to science,\r\nquite independent of any general library\"; the third economic, \"in which\r\neconomic products, whether zoological or botanical, with illustrations\r\nof the processes by which they are obtained and applied to use, should\r\nbe so disposed as best to assist the progress of Commerce and the Arts.\"\r\nIt demanded further a Zoological and a Botanical Garden, where the\r\nliving specimens could be studied.\r\n\r\nSome of these institutions existed, but were not under state control.\r\nOthers were already begun--e.g. that of Economic Zoology at South\r\nKensington; but the value of the botanical collections was minimised by\r\nwant of concentration, while as to zoology \"the British Museum contains\r\na magnificent collection of recent and fossil animals, the property of\r\nthe state, but there is no room for its proper display and no\r\naccommodation for its proper study. Its official head reports directly\r\nneither to the Government nor to the governing body of the\r\ninstitution...It is true that the people stroll through the enormous\r\ncollections of the British Museum, but the sole result is that they are\r\ndazzled and confused by the multiplicity of unexplained objects, and the\r\nman of science is deprived thrice a week of the means of advancing\r\nknowledge.\"\r\n\r\nThe agitation of 1859-60 bore fruit in due season, and within twenty\r\nyears the ideal here sketched was to a great extent realised, as any\r\nvisitor to the Natural History Museum at South Kensington can see for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe same principles are reiterated in his letter of January 25, 1868, to\r\nthe Commissioners of the Manchester Natural History Society, who had\r\nasked his advice as to the erection of a museum. But to the principles\r\nhe adds a number of most practical suggestions as to the actual\r\nstructure of the building, which are briefly appended in abstract. The\r\ncomplement to this is a letter of 1872, giving advice as to a local\r\nmuseum at Chester, and one of 1859 describing the ideal catalogue for a\r\ngeological museum.]\r\n\r\nJanuary 25, 1868.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners of the Manchester Natural History Society.\r\n\r\nSCHEME FOR A MUSEUM.\r\n\r\nOBJECTS.\r\n\r\n1. The public exhibition of a collection of specimens large enough to\r\nillustrate all the most important truths of Natural History, but not so\r\nextensive as to weary and confuse ordinary visitors.\r\n\r\n2. The accessibility of this collection to the public.\r\n\r\n3. The conservation of all specimens not necessary for the purpose\r\ndefined in Paragraph 1 in a place apart.\r\n\r\n4. The accessibility of all objects contained in the museum to the\r\ncurator and to scientific students, without interference with the public\r\nor by the public.\r\n\r\n5. Thorough exclusion of dust and dirt from the specimens.\r\n\r\n6. A provision of space for workrooms, and, if need be, lecture-rooms.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPLE.\r\n\r\nA big hall (350 x 40 x 30) with narrower halls on either side, lighted\r\nfrom the top. The central hall for the public, the others for the\r\ncurators, etc. The walls, of arches upon piers about 15 feet high,\r\nbearing on girders a gallery 5 feet wide in the public room, and 3 feet\r\n6 inches in the curators'.\r\n\r\nThe cases should be larger below, 5 feet deep, and smaller above, 2 feet\r\ndeep, with glass fronts to the public, and doors on the curators' side.\r\n\r\nFor very large specimens--e.g. a whale--the case could expand into the\r\ncurators' part without encroaching on the public part, so as to keep the\r\nline of windows regular.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of the Vertebrata, illustrations of Physical Geography and\r\nStratigraphical Geology, should be placed below.\r\n\r\nThe Invertebrata, Botanical and Mineralogical specimens in the\r\ngalleries.\r\n\r\nThe partition to be continued above the galleries to the roof, thus\r\nexcluding all the dust raised by the public.\r\n\r\nSpace for students should be provided in the curators' rooms.\r\n\r\nStorage should be AMPLE.\r\n\r\nA museum of this size gives twice as much area for exhibition purposes\r\nas that offered by ALL the cases in the present museum.\r\n\r\nAthenaeum Club, December 8, 1872.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI regret that your letter has but just come into my hands, so that my\r\nreply cannot be in time for your meeting, which, I understand you to\r\nsay, was to be held yesterday.\r\n\r\nI have no hesitation whatever in expressing the opinion that, except in\r\nthe case of large and wealthy towns (and even in their case primarily),\r\na Local Museum should be exactly what its name implies, namely\r\n\"Local\"--illustrating local Geology, local Botany, local Zoology, and\r\nlocal Archaeology.\r\n\r\nSuch a museum, if residents who are interested in these sciences take\r\nproper pains, may be brought to a great degree of perfection and be\r\nunique of its kind. It will tell both natives and strangers exactly what\r\nthey want to know, and possess great scientific interest and importance.\r\nWhereas the ordinary lumber-room of clubs from New Zealand, Hindoo\r\nidols, sharks' teeth, mangy monkeys, scorpions, and conch shells--who\r\nshall describe the weary inutility of it? It is really worse than\r\nnothing, because it leads the unwary to look for the objects of science\r\nelsewhere than under their noses. What they want to know is that their\r\n\"America is here,\" as Wilhelm Meister has it.\r\n\r\nYours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nAlfred Walker, Esq., Nant-y-Glyn, Colwyn Bay.\r\n\r\nTO THE REVEREND P. BRODIE OF WARWICK.\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, October 14, 1859.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Brodie,\r\n\r\nI am sorry to say that I can as yet send you no catalogue of ours. The\r\nremodelling of our museum is only just completed, and only the\r\nintroductory part of my catalogue is written. When it is printed you\r\nshall have an early copy.\r\n\r\nIf I may make a suggestion I should say that a catalogue of your museum\r\nfor popular use should commence with a sketch of the topography and\r\nstratigraphy of the county, put into the most intelligible language, and\r\nillustrated by reference to mineral specimens in the cases, and to the\r\nlocalities where sections showing the superposition of such and such\r\nbeds is to be seen. After that I think should come a list of the most\r\nremarkable and interesting fossils, with reference to the cases where\r\nthey are to be seen; and under the head of each a brief popular account\r\nof the kind of animal or plant which the thing was when alive, its\r\nprobable habits, and its meaning and importance as a member of the great\r\nseries of successive forms of life.\r\n\r\nYours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The reorganisation of the course of studies at Jermyn Street, fully\r\nsketched out in the 1857 notebook, involved two very serious additions\r\nto his work over and above what was required of him by his appointment\r\nas Professor. He found his students to a great extent lacking in the\r\nknowledge of general principles necessary to the comprehension of the\r\nspecial work before them. To enable them to make the best use of his\r\nregular lectures, he offered them in addition a preliminary evening\r\ncourse of nine lectures each January, which he entitled \"An Introduction\r\nto the Study of the Collection of Fossils in the Museum of Practical\r\nGeology.\" These lectures summed up what he afterwards named\r\nPhysiography, together with a general sketch of fossils and their\r\nnature, the classification of animals and plants, their distribution at\r\nvarious epochs, and the principles on which they are constructed,\r\nillustrated by the examination of some animal, such as a lobster.\r\n\r\nThe regular lectures, fifty-seven in number, ran from February to April\r\nand from April to June, with fortnightly examinations during the latter\r\nperiod, six in number. I take the scheme from his notebook:--] \"After\r\nprolegomena, the physiology and morphology of lobster and dove; then\r\nthrough Invertebrates, Anodon, Actinia, and Vorticella Protozoa, to\r\nMolluscan types. Insects, then Vertebrates. Supplemented\r\nPaleontologically by the demonstrations of the selected types in the\r\ncases; twelve Paleozoic, twelve Mesozoic and Cainozoic,\" [by his\r\nassistants.] \"To make the course complete there should be added\r\n\r\n1. A series of lectures on Species, practical discrimination and\r\ndescription, modification by conditions and distribution;\r\n\r\n2. Lectures on the elements of Botany and Fossil Plants.\"\r\n\r\n[This reorganisation of his course went hand in hand with his\r\nutilisation of the Jermyn Street Museum for paleontological teaching,\r\nand all through 1857 he was busily working at the Explanatory Catalogue.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in 1855 he had begun at Jermyn Street his regular courses of\r\nlectures to working men--lectures which impressed those qualified to\r\njudge as surpassing even his class lectures. Year after year he gave the\r\nartisans of his best, on the principle enunciated thus early in a letter\r\nof February 27, 1855, to Dyster:--]\r\n\r\nI enclose a prospectus of some People's Lectures (POPULAR Lectures I\r\nhold to be an abomination unto the Lord) I am about to give here. I want\r\nthe working classes to understand that Science and her ways are great\r\nfacts for them--that physical virtue is the base of all other, and that\r\nthey are to be clean and temperate and all the rest--not because fellows\r\nin black with white ties tell them so, but because these are plain and\r\npatent laws of nature which they must obey \"under penalties.\"\r\n\r\nI am sick of the dilettante middle class, and mean to try what I can do\r\nwith these hard-handed fellows who live among facts. You will be with\r\nme, I know.\r\n\r\n[And again on May 6, 1855:--]\r\n\r\nI am glad your lectures went off so well. They were better attended than\r\nmine [the Preliminary Course], although in point of earnestness and\r\nattention my audience was all I could wish. I am now giving a course of\r\nthe same kind to working men exclusively--one of what we call our series\r\nof \"working men's lectures,\" consisting of six given in turn by each\r\nProfessor. The theatre holds 600, and is crammed full.\r\n\r\nI believe in the fustian, and can talk better to it than to any amount\r\nof gauze and Saxony; and to a fustian audience (but to that only) I\r\nwould willingly give some when I come to Tenby.\r\n\r\n[The corresponding movement set going by F.D. Maurice also claimed his\r\ninterest, and in 1857 he gave his first address at the Working Men's\r\nCollege to an audience, as he notes, of some fifty persons, including\r\nMaurice himself.\r\n\r\nOther work of importance was connected with the Royal Institution. He\r\nhad been elected to deliver the triennial course as Fullerian Professor,\r\nand for his subject in 1856-57 chose Physiology and Comparative Anatomy;\r\nin 1858, the Principles of Biology.\r\n\r\nHe was extremely glad of the additional \"grist to the mill\" brought in\r\nby these lectures. As he wrote in 1890:--]\r\n\r\nI have good reason to know what difference a hundred a year makes when\r\nyour income is not more than four or five times that. I remember when I\r\nwas candidate for the Fullerian professorship some twenty-three years\r\nago, a friend of mine asked a wealthy manager to support me. He\r\npromised, but asked the value of the appointment, and when told, said,\r\n\"Well, but what's the use of a hundred a year to him?\" I suppose he paid\r\nhis butler that.\r\n\r\n[A further attempt to organise scientific work throughout the country\r\nand make its results generally known, dates from this time. Huxley,\r\nHooker, and Tyndall had discussed, early in 1858, the possibility of\r\nstarting a \"Scientific Review,\" which should do for science what the\r\n\"Quarterly\" or the \"Westminster\" did for literature. The scheme was\r\nfound not to be feasible at the time, though it was revived in another\r\nform in 1860; so in the meanwhile it was arranged that science should be\r\nlaid before the public every fortnight, through the medium of a\r\nscientific column in the \"Saturday Review.\" The following letter bears\r\non this proposal:--]\r\n\r\nApril 20, 1858.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nBefore the dawn of the proposal for the ever-memorable though not-to-be\r\n\"Scientific Review,\" there had been some talk of one or two of us\r\nworking the public up for science through the \"Saturday Review.\"\r\nMaskelyne (you know him, I suppose) was the suggester of the scheme, and\r\nundertook to talk to the \"Saturday\" people about it.\r\n\r\nI think the whole affair had dropped through, but yesterday Maskelyne\r\ncame to me and to Ramsay with definite propositions from the \"Saturday\"\r\neditor.\r\n\r\nHe undertakes to put in a scientific article in the intermediate part\r\nbetween Leaders and Reviews once a fortnight if we will supply him. He\r\nis not to mutilate or to alter, but to take what he gets and be\r\nthankful.\r\n\r\nThe writers to select their own subjects. Now the question is, Will\r\nseven or eight of us, representing different sciences, join together and\r\nundertake to supply at least one article in three months? Once a\r\nfortnight would want a minimum of six articles in three months, so that\r\nif there were six, each man must supply one.\r\n\r\nSylvester is talked of for Mathematics. I am going to write to Tyndall\r\nabout doing Physics. Maskelyne and perhaps Frankland will take Chemistry\r\nand Mineralogy. You and I might do Biology; Ramsay, Geology; Smyth,\r\nTechnology.\r\n\r\nThis looks to me like a very feasible plan, not asking too much of\r\nanyone, and yet giving all an opportunity of saying what he has to say.\r\n\r\nBesides this the \"Saturday\" would be glad to get Reviews from us.\r\n\r\nIf all those mentioned agree to join, we will meet somewhere and discuss\r\nplans.\r\n\r\nLet me have a line to say what you think, and believe me, ever yours\r\nfaithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[In 1858 he read three papers at the Geological and two at the Linnean;\r\nhe lectured (February 15) on Fish and Fisheries at South Kensington, and\r\non May 21 gave a Friday evening discourse at the Royal Institution on\r\n\"The Phenomena of Gemmation.\" He wrote an article for \"Todd's\r\nCyclopaedia,\" on the \"Tegumentary Organs,\" an elaborate paper, as Sir M.\r\nFoster says, on a histological theme, to which, as to others of the same\r\nclass on the Teeth and the Corpuscular Tactus (\"Q. J. Micr. Science\"\r\n1853-4), he had been \"led probably by the desire, which only gradually\r\nand through lack of fulfilment left him, to become a physiologist rather\r\nthan a naturalist.\"\r\n\r\nNo less important was his more general work for science. Physiological\r\nstudy in England at this time was dominated by transcendental notions.\r\nTo put first principles on a sound experimental basis was the aim of the\r\nnew leaders of scientific thought. To this end Huxley made two\r\ncontributions in 1858--one on the general subject of the cell theory,\r\nthe other on the particular question of the development of the skull.\r\n\"In a striking 'Review of the Cell Theory,'\" says Sir M. Foster, \"which\r\nappeared in the \"British and Foreign Medical Review\" in 1858, a paper\r\nwhich more than one young physiologist at the time read with delight,\r\nand which even to-day may be studied with no little profit, he, in this\r\nsubject as in others, drove the sword of rational inquiry through the\r\nheart of conceptions, metaphysical and transcendental, but dominant.\"\r\n\r\nOf this article Professor E. Ray Lankester also writes:--\r\n\r\n...Indeed it is a fundamental study in morphology. The extreme interest\r\nand importance of the views put forward in that article may be judged of\r\nby the fact that although it is forty years since it was published, and\r\nalthough our knowledge of cell structure has made immense progress\r\nduring those forty years, yet the main contention of that article,\r\nnamely that cells are not the cause but the result of organisation--in\r\nfact, are, as he says, to the tide of life what the line of shells and\r\nweeds on the seashore is to the tide of the living sea--is even now\r\nbeing re-asserted, and in a slightly modified form is by very many\r\ncytologists admitted as having more truth in it than the opposed view\r\nand its later outcomes, to the effect that the cell is the unit of life\r\nin which and through which alone living matter manifests its activities.\r\n\r\nThe second was his Croonian Lecture of 1858, \"On the Theory of the\r\nVertebrate Skull,\" in which he demonstrated from the embryological\r\nresearches of Rathke and others, that after the first step the whole\r\ncourse of development in the segments of the skull proceeded on\r\ndifferent lines from that of the vertebral column; and that Oken's\r\nimaginative theory of the skull as modified vertebrae, logically\r\ncomplete down to a strict parallel between the subsidiary head-bones and\r\nthe limbs attached to the spine, outran the facts of a definite\r\nstructure common to all vertebrates which he had observed. (\"Following\r\nup Rathke, he strove to substitute for the then dominant fantastic\r\ndoctrines of the homologies of the cranial elements advocated by Owen,\r\nsounder views based on embryological evidence. He exposed the futility\r\nof attempting to regard the skull as a series of segments, in each of\r\nwhich might be recognised all the several parts of a vertebra, and\r\npointed out the errors of trusting to superficial resemblances of shape\r\nand position. He showed, by the history of the development of each,\r\nthat, though both skull and vertebral column are segmented, the one and\r\nthe other, after an early stage, are fashioned on lines so different as\r\nto exclude all possibility of regarding the detailed features of each as\r\nmere modifications of a type repeated along the axis of the body. 'The\r\nspinal column and the skull start from the same primitive condition,\r\nwhence they immediately begin to diverge.' 'It may be true to say that\r\nthere is a primitive identity of structure between the spinal or\r\nvertebral column and the skull; but it is no more true that the adult\r\nskull is a modified vertebral column than it would be to affirm that the\r\nvertebral column is modified skull.' This lecture marked an epoch in\r\nEngland in vertebrate morphology, and the views enunciated in it carried\r\nforward, if somewhat modified, as they have been, not only by Huxley's\r\nsubsequent researches and by those of his disciples, but especially by\r\nthe splendid work of Gegenbauer, are still, in the main, the views of\r\nthe anatomists of to-day.\"--Sir M. Foster, Royal Society Obituary Notice\r\nof T.H. Huxley.)\r\n\r\nWith the demolition of Oken's theory fell the superstructure raised by\r\nits chief supporter, Owen, \"archetype\" and all.\r\n\r\nIt was undoubtedly a bold step to challenge thus openly the man who was\r\nacknowledged as the autocrat of science in Britain. Moreover, though he\r\nhad long felt that on his own subjects he was Owen's master, to begin a\r\ncontroversy was contrary to his deliberate practice. But now he had the\r\nchoice of submitting to arbitrary dictation or securing himself from\r\nfurther aggressions by dealing a blow which would weaken the authority\r\nof the aggressor. For the growing antagonism between him and Owen had\r\ncome to a head early in the preceding year, when the latter, taking\r\nadvantage of the permission to use the lecture-theatre at Jermyn Street\r\nfor the delivery of a paleontological course, unwarrantably assumed the\r\ntitle of Professor of Paleontology at the School of Mines, to the\r\nobvious detriment of Huxley's position there. His explanations not\r\nsatisfying the council of the School of Mines, Huxley broke off all\r\npersonal intercourse with him.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.11.\r\n\r\n1857-1858.\r\n\r\nThroughout this period his health was greatly tried by the strain of his\r\nwork and life in town. Headache! headache! is his repeated note in the\r\nearly part of 1857, and in 1858 we find such entries as:--]\r\n\r\n\"February 11.--Used up. Hypochondrical and bedevilled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ditto 12.\"\r\n\r\n\"13.--Not good for much.\"\r\n\r\n\"21.--Toothache, incapable all day.\"\r\n\r\n[And again:--]\r\n\r\n\"March 30. Voiceless.\"\r\n\r\n\"31.--Missed lecture.\"\r\n\r\n[And]\r\n\r\n\"April 1.--Unable to go out.\"\r\n\r\n[He would come in thoroughly used up after lecturing twice on the same\r\nday, as frequently happened, and lie wearily on one sofa; while his\r\nwife, whose health was wretched, matched him on the other. Yet he would\r\ngo down to a lecture feeling utterly unable to deliver it, and, once\r\nstarted, would carry it through successfully--at what cost of nervous\r\nenergy was known only to those two at home.\r\n\r\nBut there was another branch of work, that for the Geological Survey,\r\nwhich occasionally took him out of London, and the open-air occupation\r\nand tramping from place to place did him no little good. Thus, through\r\nthe greater part of September and October 1856 he ranged the coasts of\r\nthe Bristol Channel from Weston to Clovelly, and from Tenby to Swansea,\r\npreparing a \"Report on the Recent Changes of Level in the Bristol\r\nChannel.\"] \"You can't think,\" [he writes from Braunton on October 3,]\r\n\"how well I am, so long as I walk eight or ten miles a day and don't\r\nwork too much, but I find fifteen or sixteen miles my limit for\r\ncomfort.\"\r\n\r\n[For many years after this his favourite mode of recruiting from the\r\nresults of a spell of overwork was to take a short walking tour with a\r\nfriend. In April 1857 he is off for a week to Cromer; in 1860 he goes\r\nwith Busk and Hooker for Christmas week to Snowdon; another time he is\r\nmanoeuvred off by his wife and friends to Switzerland with Tyndall.\r\n\r\nIn Switzerland he spent his summer holidays both in 1856 and 1857, in\r\nthe latter year examining the glaciers with Tyndall scientifically, as\r\nwell as seeking pleasure by the ascent of Mont Blanc. As fruits of this\r\nexcursion were published late in the same year, his \"Letter to Mr.\r\nTyndall on the Structure of Glacier Ice\" (\"Phil. Mag.\" 14 1857), and the\r\npaper in the \"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society,\" which\r\nappeared--much against his will--in the joint names of himself and\r\nTyndall. Of these he wrote in 1893 in answer to an inquiry on the\r\nsubject:--]\r\n\r\nBy the Observations on Glaciers I imagine you refer to a short paper\r\npublished in \"Phil. Mag.\" that embodied results of a little bit of work\r\nof my own. The Glacier paper in the \"Phil. Trans.\" is essentially and in\r\nall respects Professor Tyndall's. He took up glacier work in consequence\r\nof a conversation at my table, and we went out to Switzerland together,\r\nand of course talked over the matter a good deal. However, except for my\r\nfriend's insistence, I should not have allowed my name to appear as\r\njoint author, and I doubt whether I ought to have yielded. But he is a\r\nmasterful man and over-generous.\r\n\r\n[And in a letter to Hooker he writes:--]\r\n\r\nBy the way, you really must not associate me with Tyndall and talk about\r\nOUR theory. My sole merit in the matter (and for that I do take some\r\ncredit) is to have set him at work at it, for the only suggestion I\r\nmade, namely that the veined structure was analogous to his artificial\r\ncleavage phenomena, has turned out to be quite wrong.\r\n\r\nTyndall fairly MADE me put my name to that paper, and would have had it\r\nfirst if I would have let him, but if people go on ascribing to me any\r\nshare in his admirable work I shall have to make a public protest. All I\r\nam content to share is the row, if there is to be one.\r\n\r\n[The following letters to Hooker and Tyndall touch upon his Swiss trips\r\nof 1856 and 1857:--]\r\n\r\nBerne, September 3, 1856.\r\n\r\nI send you a line hence, having forgotten to write from Interlaken,\r\nwhence we departed this morning.\r\n\r\nThe Weissthor expedition was the most successful thing you can imagine.\r\nWe reached the Riffelberg in 11 1/2 hours, the first six being the\r\nhardest work I ever had in my life in the climbing way, and the last\r\nfive carrying us through the most glorious sight I ever witnessed.\r\nDuring the latter part of the day there was not a cloud on the whole\r\nMonte Rosa range, so you may imagine what the Matterhorn and the rest of\r\nthem looked like from the wide plain of neve just below the Weissthor.\r\nIt was quite a new sensation, and I would not have missed it for any\r\namount; and besides this I had an opportunity of examining the neve at a\r\nvery great height. A regularly stratified section, several hundred feet\r\nhigh, was exposed on the Cima di Jazi, and I was convinced that the\r\nWeissthor would be a capital spot for making observations on the neve\r\nand on other correlative matters. There are no difficulties in the way\r\nof getting up to it from the Zermatt side, tough job as it is from\r\nMacugnaga, and we might readily rig a tent under shelter of the ridge.\r\nThat would lick old Saussure into fits. All the Zermatt guides put the\r\nS. Theodul pass far beneath the Weissthor in point of difficulty; and\r\nyou may tell Mrs. Hooker that they think the S. Theodul easier than the\r\nMonte Moro. The best of the joke was that I lost my way in coming down\r\nthe Riffelberg to Zermatt the same evening, so that altogether I had a\r\nlong day of it. The next day I walked from Zermatt to Visp (recovering\r\nBaedeker by the way), but my shoes were so knocked to pieces that I got\r\na blister on my heel. Next day Voiture to Susten, and then over Gemmi to\r\nKandersteg, and on Thursday my foot was so queer I was glad to get a\r\nretour to Interlaken. I found most interesting and complete evidences of\r\nold moraine deposits all the way down the Leuk valley into the Rhine\r\nvalley, and I believe those little hills beyond Susten are old terminal\r\nmoraines too. On the other side I followed moraines down to Frutigen,\r\nand great masses of glacial gravel with boulders, nearly to the Lake of\r\nThum.\r\n\r\nMy wife is better, but anything but strong.\r\n\r\nChamounix, August 16, 1857.\r\n\r\nMy wife sends me intelligence of the good news you were so kind as to\r\ncommunicate to her. I need not tell you how rejoiced I am that\r\neverything has gone on well, and that your wife is safe and well. Offer\r\nher my warmest congratulations and good wishes. I have made one\r\nmatrimonial engagement for Noel already, otherwise I would bespeak the\r\nhand of the young lady for him.\r\n\r\nIt has been raining cats and dogs these two days, so that we have been\r\nunable to return to our headquarters at the Montanvert which we left on\r\nWednesday for the purpose of going up Mont Blanc. Tyndall (who has\r\nbecome one of the most active and daring mountaineers you ever saw--so\r\nthat we have christened him \"cat\"; and our guide said the other day \"Il\r\nva plus fort qu'un mouton. Il faut lui mettre une sonnette\") had set his\r\nheart on the performance of this feat (of course with purely scientific\r\nobjects), and had equally made up his mind not to pay five and twenty\r\npounds sterling for the gratification. So we had one guide and took two\r\nporters in addition as far as the Grande Mulets. He is writing to you,\r\nand will tell you himself what happened to those who reached the top--to\r\nwit, himself, Hirst, and the guide. I found that three days in\r\nSwitzerland had not given me my Swiss legs, and consequently I remained\r\nat the Grands Mulets, all alone in my glory, and for some eight hours in\r\na great state of anxiety, for the three did not return for about that\r\nperiod after they were due.\r\n\r\nI was there on a pinnacle like St. Simon Stylites, and nearly as dirty\r\nas that worthy saint must have been, but without any of his other claims\r\nto angelic assistance, so that I really did not see, if they had fallen\r\ninto a crevasse, how I was to help either them or myself. They came back\r\nat last, just as it was growing dusk, to my inexpressible relief, and\r\nthe next day we came down here--such a set of dirty, sun-burnt,\r\nsnow-blind wretches as you never saw.\r\n\r\nWe heartily wished you were with us. What we shall do next I neither\r\nknow nor care, as I have placed myself entirely under Commodore\r\nTyndall's orders; but I suppose we shall be three or four days more at\r\nthe Montanvert, and then make the tour of Mont Blanc. I have tied up six\r\npounds sterling in one end of my purse, and when I have no more than\r\nthat I shall come back. Altogether I don't feel in the least like the\r\nfather of a family; no more would you if you were here. The habit of\r\ncarrying a pack, I suppose, makes the \"quiver full of arrows\" feel\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n115 Esplanade, Deal, September 3, 1857.\r\n\r\nMy dear Tyndall,\r\n\r\nI don't consider myself returned until next Wednesday, when the\r\nestablishment of No. 14 will reopen on its accustomed scale of\r\nmagnificence, but I don't mind letting you know I am in the flesh and\r\nsafe back.\r\n\r\nThe tour round Mont Blanc was a decided success; in fact, I had only to\r\nregret you were not with me. The grand glacier of the Allee Blanche and\r\nthe view of Mont Blanc from the valley of Aosta were alone worth all the\r\ntrouble. I had only one wet day, and that I spent on the Brenon Glacier;\r\nfor, in spite of all good resolutions to the contrary, I cannot resist\r\npoking into the glaciers whenever I have a chance. You will be\r\ninterested in my results, which we shall soon, I hope, talk on together\r\nat length.\r\n\r\nAs I suspected, Forbes has made a most egregious blunder. What he speaks\r\nof and figures as the \"structure\" of the Brenon is nothing but a\r\npeculiar arrangement of ENTIRELY SUPERFICIAL DIRT BANDS, DEPENDENT ON\r\nTHE STRUCTURE, BUT NOT IT. The true structure is singularly beautiful\r\nand well marked in the Brenon, the blue veins being very close set, and\r\nof course wholly invisible from a distance of a hundred yards, which is\r\nless than that of the spot whence Forbes' view of the (supposed)\r\nstructure is taken.\r\n\r\nI saw another wonderful thing in La Brenon. About the middle of its\r\nlength there is a step like this of about 20 or 30 feet in height. In\r\nthe lower part (B) the structural planes are vertical; in the upper (A)\r\nthey dip at a considerable angle. I thought I had found a case of\r\nunconformability, indicating a slip of one portion of the glacier over\r\nanother, but when I came to examine the intermediate region (X)\r\ncarefully, I found the structural planes at every intermediate angle,\r\nand consequently a perfect transition from the one to the other.\r\n\r\nI returned by Aosta, the great St. Bernard, and the Col de Balme. Old\r\nSimond was quite affectionate in his discourse about you, and seemed\r\nquite unhappy because you would not borrow his money. He had received\r\nyour remittance, and asked me to tell you so. He was distressed at\r\nhaving forgotten to get a certificate from you, so I said in mine I was\r\nquite sure you were well satisfied with him.\r\n\r\nOn our journey he displayed his characteristic qualities, Je ne sais pas\r\nbeing the usual answer to any topographical inquiries with a total\r\nabsence of nerve, and a general conviction that distances were very\r\ngreat and that the weather would be bad. However, we got on very well,\r\nand I was sorry to part with him.\r\n\r\nI came home by way of Neuchatel, paying a visit to the Pierre a Bot,\r\nwhich I have long wished to see. My financial calculations were perfect\r\nin theory, but nearly broke down in practice, inasmuch as I was twice\r\nobliged to travel first-class when I calculated on second. The result\r\nwas that my personal expenses between Paris and London amounted to\r\n1.50!! and I arrived at my own house hungry and with a remainder of a\r\nfew centimes. I should think that your fate must have been similar.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for writing to my wife. She sends her kindest remembrances\r\nto you.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H.H.\r\n\r\n[The year 1857 was the last in which Huxley apparently had time to go so\r\nfar in journal-writing as to draw up a balance-sheet at the year's end\r\nof work done and work undone. Though he finds] \"as usual a lamentable\r\ndifference between agenda and acta; many things proposed to be done not\r\ndone, and many things not thought of finished,\" [still there is enough\r\nnoted to satisfy most energetic people. Mention has already been made of\r\nhis lectures--sixty-six at Jermyn Street, twelve Fullerian, and as many\r\nmore to prepare for the next year's course; seven to working men, and\r\none at the Royal Institution, together with the rearrangement of\r\nspecimens at the Jermyn Street Museum, and the preparation of the\r\nExplanatory Catalogue, which this year was published to the extent of\r\nthe Introduction and the Tertiary collections. To these may be added\r\nexaminations at the London University, where he had succeeded Dr.\r\nCarpenter as examiner in Physiology and Comparative Anatomy in 1856,\r\nreviews, translations, a report on Deep Sea Soundings, and ten\r\nscientific memoirs.\r\n\r\nThe most important of the unfinished work consists of the long-delayed\r\n\"Oceanic Hydrozoa,\" the \"Manual of Comparative Anatomy,\" and a report on\r\nFisheries. The rest of the unfinished programme shows the usual\r\ncommixture of technical studies in anatomy and paleontology, with essays\r\non the philosophical and educational bearings of his work. On the one\r\nhand are memoirs of Daphnia, Nautilus, and the Herring, the affinities\r\nof the Paleozoic Crustacea, the Ascidian Catalogue and Positive\r\nHistology; on the other, the Literature of the Drift, a review of the\r\npresent state of philosophical anatomy, and a scheme for arranging the\r\nExplanatory Catalogue to serve as an introductory textbook to the Jermyn\r\nStreet lectures and the paleontological demonstrations. Here, too, would\r\nfall a proposed \"Letter on the Study of Comparative Anatomy,\" to do for\r\nthose subjects what Henslow had done in his \"Letter\" for Botany.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the fact of his being forced to take up Paleontology, it\r\nwas perhaps the philosophic breadth of view with which he regarded his\r\nsubject at any time, and the desire of getting to the bottom of each\r\nsubsidiary problem arising from it, that made him for many years seem\r\nconstantly to spring aside from his own subject, to fly off at a tangent\r\nfrom the line in which he was assured of unrivalled success did he but\r\ndevote to it his undivided powers. But he was prepared to endure the\r\ncharge of desultoriness with equanimity. In part, he was still studying\r\nthe whole field of biological science before he would claim to be a\r\nmaster in one department; in part, he could not yet tell to what post he\r\nmight succeed when he left--as he fully expected to leave--the\r\nProfessorship at Jermyn Street.\r\n\r\nOne characteristic of his early papers should not pass unnoticed. This\r\nwas his familiarity with the best that had been written on his subjects\r\nabroad as well as in England. Thoroughness in this respect was rendered\r\neasier by the fact that he read French and German with almost as much\r\nfacility as his mother tongue. \"It is true, of course, that scientific\r\nmen read French and German before the time of Huxley; but the deliberate\r\nconsultation of all the authorities available has been maintained in\r\nhistorical succession since Huxley's earliest papers, and was absent in\r\nthe papers of his early contemporaries.\" (P. Chalmers Mitchell in\r\n\"Natural Science\" August 1895.)\r\n\r\nAbout this time his activity in several branches of science began to\r\nfind recognition from scientific societies at home and abroad. In 1857\r\nhe was elected honorary member of the Microscopical Society of Giessen;\r\nand in the same year, of a more important body, the Academy of Breslau\r\n(Imperialis Academia Caesariana Naturae Curiosum). He writes to\r\nHooker:--]\r\n\r\n14 Waverley Place, April 3, 1857.\r\n\r\nHaving subsided from standing upon my head--which was the immediate\r\ncausation of your correspondence about the co-extension Imperialis\r\nAcademia Caesariana Naturae Curiosum (don't I know their thundering long\r\ntitle well!)--I have to say that I was born on the 4th of May of the\r\nyear 1825, whereby I have now more or less mis-spent thirty-one years\r\nand a bittock, nigh on thirty-two.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, my locus natalis is Ealing, in the county of Middlesex.\r\nUpon my word, it is very obliging of the \"curious naturals,\" and I must\r\nsay wholly surprising and unexpected.\r\n\r\nI shall hold up my head immensely to-morrow when (blessed be the Lord) I\r\ngive my last Fullerian.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, I am going to take Cuvier's crack case of the\r\n'Possum of Montmartre as an illustration of MY views.\r\n\r\nI wondered what had become of you, but the people have come talking\r\nabout me this last lecture or two, so I supposed you had erupted to Kew.\r\n\r\nMy glacier article is out; tell me what you think of it some day.\r\n\r\nI wrote a civil note to Forbes yesterday, charging myself with my crime,\r\nand I hope that is the end of the business. [Principal James Forbes,\r\nwith whose theory of glaciers Huxley and Tyndall disagreed.]\r\n\r\nMy wife is mending slowly, and if she were here would desire to be\r\nremembered to you.\r\n\r\n[In December 1858 he became a Fellow of the Linnean, and the following\r\nmonth not only Fellow but Secretary of the Geological Society.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 also he was elected to the Athenaeum Club under Rule 2, which\r\nprovides that the committee shall yearly elect a limited number of\r\npersons distinguished in art, science, or letters. His proposer was Sir\r\nR. Murchison, who wrote:--\r\n\r\nAthenaeum, January 26.\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley,\r\n\r\nI had a success as to you that I never had or heard of before. Nineteen\r\npersons voted, and of these eighteen voted for you and no one against\r\nyou. You, of course, came in at the head of the poll; no other having,\r\ni.e. Cobden, more than eleven.\r\n\r\nYours well satisfied,\r\n\r\nRod. I. Murchison.\r\n\r\n[From this time forth he corresponded with many foreign men of science;\r\nin these years particularly with Victor Carus, Lacaze Duthiers,\r\nKolliker, and de Quatrefages, in reference to their common interest in\r\nthe study of the invertebrates.\r\n\r\nAt home, the year 1857 opened very brightly for Huxley with the birth of\r\nhis first child, a son, on the eve of the New Year. A Christmas child,\r\nthe boy was named Noel, and lived four happy years to be the very\r\nsunshine of home, the object of passionate devotion, whose sudden loss\r\nstruck deeper and more ineffaceably than any other blow that befell\r\nHuxley during all his life.\r\n\r\nAs he sat alone that December night, in the little room that was his\r\nstudy in the house in Waverley Place, waiting for the event that was to\r\nbring him so much happiness and so much sorrow, he made a last entry in\r\nhis journal, full of hope and resolution. In the blank space below\r\nfollows a note of four years later, when \"the ground seemed cut from\r\nunder his feet,\" yet written with restraint and without bitterness.]\r\n\r\nDecember 31, 1856.\r\n\r\n...1856-7-8 must still be \"Lehrjahre\" to complete training in principles\r\nof Histology, Morphology, Physiology, Zoology, and Geology by\r\nMonographic Work in each department. 1860 will then see me well grounded\r\nand ready for any special pursuits in either of these branches.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to map out beforehand how this must be done. I must\r\nseize opportunities as they come, at the risk of the reputation of\r\ndesultoriness.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 I may fairly look forward to fifteen or twenty years\r\n\"Meisterjahre,\" and with the comprehensive views my training will have\r\ngiven me, I think it will be possible in that time to give a new and\r\nhealthier direction to all Biological Science.\r\n\r\nTo smite all humbugs, however big; to give a nobler tone to science; to\r\nset an example of abstinence from petty personal controversies, and of\r\ntoleration for everything but lying; to be indifferent as to whether the\r\nwork is recognised as mine or not, so long as it is done:--are these my\r\naims? 1860 will show.\r\n\r\n  Willst du dir ein hubsch Leben zimmern,\r\n  Musst dich ans Vergangene nicht bekummern;\r\n  Und ware dir auch was Verloren,\r\n  Musst immer thun wie neugeboren.\r\n  Was jeder Tag will, sollst du fragen;\r\n  Was jeder Tag will, wird er sagen.\r\n  Musst dich an eigenem Thun ergotzen;\r\n  Was andere thun, das wirst du schatzen.\r\n  Besonders keinen Menschen hassen\r\n  Und das Ubrige Gott uberlassen.\r\n\r\n  [Wilt shape a noble life?

On Saturday night the fifteenth, I\r\ncarried him here into my study, and laid his cold still body here where\r\nI write.

I say heartily and without bitterness--Amen, so let it\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.12.\r\n\r\n1859-1860.\r\n\r\n[The programme laid down in 1857 was steadily carried out through a\r\ngreat part of 1859. Huxley published nine monographs, chiefly on fossil\r\nReptilia, in the proceedings of the Geological Society and of the\r\nGeological Survey, one on the armour of crocodiles at the Linnean, and\r\n\"Observations on the Development of some Parts of the Skeleton of\r\nFishes,\" in the \"Journal of Microscopical Science.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the former was a paper on Stagonolepis, a creature from the Elgin\r\nbeds, which had previously been ranked among the fishes. From some new\r\nremains, which he worked out of the stone with his own hands, Huxley\r\nmade out that this was a reptile closely allied to the Crocodiles; and\r\nfrom this and the affinities of another fossil, Hyperodapedon, from\r\nneighbouring beds, determined the geological age to which the Elgin beds\r\nbelonged. A good deal turned upon the nature of the scales from the back\r\nand belly of this animal, and a careful comparison with the scales of\r\nmodern crocodiles--a subject till then little investigated--led to the\r\npaper at the Linnean already mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe paper on fish development was mainly based upon dissections of the\r\nyoung of the stickleback. Fishes had been divided into two classes\r\naccording as their tails are developed evenly on either side of the line\r\nof the spine, which was supposed to continue straight through the centre\r\nof the tail, or lopsided, with one tail fin larger than the other. This\r\ninvestigation showed that the apparently even development was only an\r\nextreme case of lopsidedness, the continuation of the \"chorda,\" which\r\ngives rise to the spine, being at the top of the upper fin, and both\r\nfins being developed on the same side of it. Lopsidedness as such,\r\ntherefore, was not to be regarded as an embryological character in\r\nancient fishes; what might be regarded as such was the absence of a bony\r\nsheath to the end of the \"chorda\" found in the more developed fishes.\r\nFurther traces of this bony structure were shown to exist, among other\r\npiscine resemblances, in the Amphibia. Finally the embryological facts\r\nnow observed in the development of the bones of the skull were of great\r\nimportance,] \"as they enable us to understand, on the one hand, the\r\ndifferent modifications of the palato-suspensorial apparatus in fishes,\r\nand on the other hand the relations of the components of this apparatus\r\nto the corresponding parts in other Vertebrata,\" [fishes, reptiles, and\r\nmammals presenting a well-marked series of gradations in respect to this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nThis part of the paper had grown out of the investigations begun for the\r\nessay on the Vertebrate Skull, just as that on Jacare and Caiman from\r\ninquiry into the scales of Stagonolepis.\r\n\r\nThus he was still able to devote most of his time to original research.\r\nBut though in his letter of March 27, 1855, below, he says,] \"I never\r\nwrite for the Reviews now, as original work is much more to my taste,\"\r\n[it appears from jottings in his 1859 notebook, such as \"Whewell's\r\n'History of Scientific Ideas,' as a Peg on which to hang Cuvier\r\narticle,\" [that he again found it necessary to supplement his income by\r\nwriting. He was still examiner at London University, and delivered six\r\nlectures on Animal Motion at the London Institution and another at\r\nWarwick. This lecture he had offered to give at the Warwick Museum as\r\nsome recognition of the willing help he had received from the assistants\r\nwhen he came down to examine certain fossils there. On the way he\r\nvisited Rolleston at Oxford. The knowledge of Oxford life gained from\r\nthis and a later visit led him to write:--]\r\n\r\nThe more I see of the place the more glad I am that I elected to stay in\r\nLondon. I see much to admire and like; but I am more and more convinced\r\nthat it would not suit me as a residence.\r\n\r\n[Two more important points remain to be mentioned among the occupations\r\nof the year. In January Huxley was elected Secretary of the Geological\r\nSociety, and with this office began a form of administrative work in the\r\nscientific world which ceased only with his resignation of the\r\nPresidency of the Royal Society in 1885.\r\n\r\nPart of the summer Huxley spent in the North. On August 3 he went to\r\nLamlash Bay in Arran. Here Dr. Carpenter had, in 1855, discovered a\r\nconvenient cottage on Holy Island--the only one, indeed, on the\r\nisland--well suited for naturalists; the bay was calm and suitable both\r\nfor the dredge and for keeping up a vivarium. He proposed that either\r\nthe Survey should rent the whole island at a cost of some 50 pounds\r\nsterling, or, failing this, that he would take the cottage himself, if\r\nHuxley would join him for two or three seasons and share the expense.\r\nHuxley laid the plan before Sir R. Murchison, the head of the Survey,\r\nwho consented to try the plan for a course of years, during three months\r\nin each year. \"But,\" [he added,] \"keep it experimental; for there are no\r\nUSEFUL fisheries such as delight Lord Stanley.\" [Here, then, with an\r\nascent of Goatfell for variety on the 21st, a month was passed in\r\ntrawling, and experiments on the spawning of the herring appear to have\r\nbeen continued for him during the winter in Bute.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th Huxley left Lamlash for a trip through central and southern\r\nScotland, continuing his geological work for the Survey; and wound up by\r\nattending the meeting of the British Association at Aberdeen, leaving\r\nhis wife and the three children at Aberdour, on the Fifeshire coast.\r\n\r\nFrom Aberdeen, where Prince Albert was President of the Association,\r\nHuxley writes on September 15:--]\r\n\r\nOwen's brief address on giving up the presidential chair was exceedingly\r\ngood...I shall be worked like a horse here. There are all sorts of new\r\nmaterials from Elgin, besides other things, and I daresay I shall have\r\nto speak frequently. In point of attendance and money this is the best\r\nmeeting the Association ever had. In point of science, we shall\r\nsee...Tyndall has accepted the Physical chair with us, at which I am\r\ngreatly delighted.\r\n\r\n[In this connection the following letter to Tyndall is interesting:--]\r\n\r\nAberdour, Fife, N. B., September 5, 1859.\r\n\r\nMy dear Tyndall,\r\n\r\nI met Faraday on Loch Lomond yesterday, and learned from him that you\r\nhad returned, whereby you are a great sinner for not having written to\r\nme. Faraday told me you were all sound, wind and limb, and had carried\r\nout your object, which was good to hear.\r\n\r\nHave you had any letter from Sir Roderick? If not, pray call in Jermyn\r\nStreet and see Reeks as soon as possible. [Mr. Trenham Reeks, who died\r\nin 1879, was Registrar of the School of Mines, and Curator and Librarian\r\nof the Museum of Practical Geology.]\r\n\r\nThe thing I have been hoping for for years past has come about,--Stokes\r\nhaving resigned the Physical Chair in our place, in consequence of his\r\nappointment to the Cambridge University Commission. This unfortunately\r\noccurred only after our last meeting for the session, and after I had\r\nleft town, but Reeks wrote to me about it at once. I replied as soon as\r\nI received his letter, and told him that I would take upon myself the\r\nresponsibility of saying that you would accept the chair if it were\r\noffered you. I thought I was justified in this by various conversations\r\nwe have had; and, at any rate, I felt sure that it was better that I\r\nshould get into a mess than that you should lose the chance.\r\n\r\nI know that Sir Roderick has written to you, but I imagine the letter\r\nhas gone to Chamounix, so pray put yourself into communication with\r\nReeks at once.\r\n\r\nYou know very well that the having you with us at Jermyn Street is a\r\nproject that has long been dear to my heart, partly on your own account,\r\nbut largely for the interest of the school. I earnestly hope that there\r\nis no impediment in the way of your coming to us. How I am minded\r\ntowards you, you ought to know by this time; but I can assure you that\r\nall the rest of us will receive you with open arms. Of that I am quite\r\nsure.\r\n\r\nLet me have a line to know your determination. I am on tenterhooks till\r\nthe thing is settled.\r\n\r\nCan't you come up this way as you go to Aberdeen?\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I thought I might mention the Jermyn Street matter to Faraday\r\nprivately, and did so. He seemed pleased that the offer had been made.\r\n\r\n[The acceptance of the lectureship at the School of Mines brought\r\nTyndall into the closest contact with Huxley for the next nine years,\r\nuntil he resigned his lectureship in 1868 on succeeding Faraday as\r\nsuperintendent of the Royal Institution.\r\n\r\nOn September 17 he writes:--]\r\n\r\nYesterday Owen and I foregathered in Section D. He read a very good and\r\nimportant paper, and I got up afterwards and spoke exactly as I thought\r\nabout it, and praising many parts of it strongly. In his reply he was\r\nunco civil and complimentary, so that the people who had come in hopes\r\nof a row were (as I intended they should be) disappointed.\r\n\r\n[A number of miscellaneous letters of this period are here grouped\r\ntogether.]\r\n\r\n14 Waverley Place, January 30, 1858.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\n...I wish you wouldn't be apologetic about criticism from people who\r\nhave a right to criticise. I always look upon any criticism as a\r\ncompliment, not but what the old Adam in T.H.H. WILL arise and fight\r\nvigorously against all impugnment, and irrespective of all odds in the\r\nway of authority, but that is the way of the beast.\r\n\r\nWhy I value your and Tyndall's and Darwin's friendship so much is, among\r\nother things, that you all pitch into me when necessary. You may depend\r\nupon it, however blue I may look when in the wrong, it's wrath with\r\nmyself and nobody else.\r\n\r\n[To his sister.]\r\n\r\nThe Government School of Mines, Jermyn Street, March 27, 1858.\r\n\r\nMy dearest Lizzie,\r\n\r\nIt is a month since your very welcome letter reached me. I had every\r\ninclination and every intention to answer it at once, but the wear and\r\ntear of incessant occupation (for your letter arrived in the midst of my\r\nbusiest time) has, I will not say deprived me of the leisure, but of\r\nthat tone of mind which one wants for writing a long letter. I fully\r\nunderstand--no one should be better able to comprehend--how the same\r\ncauses may operate on you, but do not be silent so long again; it is bad\r\nfor both of us. I have loved but few people in my life, and am not\r\nlikely to care for any more unless it be my children. I desire therefore\r\nrather to knit more firmly than to loosen the old ties, and of these\r\nwhich is older or stronger than ours? Don't let us drift asunder again.\r\n\r\nYour letter came just after the birth of my second child, a little girl.\r\nI registered her to-day in the style and title of Jessie Oriana Huxley.\r\nThe second name is a family name of my wife's and not, as you might\r\nsuppose, taken from Tennyson. You will know why my wife and I chose the\r\nfirst. We could not make you a godmother, as my wife's mother is one,\r\nand a friend of ours had long since applied for the other vacancy, but\r\nperhaps this is a better tie than that meaningless formality. My little\r\nson is fifteen months old; a fair-haired, blue-eyed, stout little\r\nTrojan, very like his mother. He looks out on the world with bold\r\nconfident eyes and open brow, as if he were its master. We shall try to\r\nmake him a better man than his father. As for the little one, I am told\r\nshe is pretty, and slavishly admit the fact in the presence of mother\r\nand nurse, but between ourselves I don't see it. To my carnal eyes her\r\nnose is the image of mine, and you know what that means. For though\r\nwandering up and down the world and work have begun to sow a little\r\nsilver in my hair, they have by no means softened the outlines of that\r\nremarkable feature.\r\n\r\nYou want to know what I am and where I am--well, here's a list of\r\ntitles. T.H.H., Professor of Natural History, Government School of\r\nMines, Jermyn Street; Naturalist to the Geological Survey; Curator of\r\nthe Paleontological collections (NON-OFFICIAL maid-of-all-work in\r\nNatural Science to the Government); Examiner in Physiology and\r\nComparative Anatomy to the University of London; Fullerian Professor of\r\nPhysiology to the Royal Institution (but that's just over); F.R.S.,\r\nF.G.S., etc. Member of a lot of Societies and Clubs, all of which cost\r\nhim a mint of money. Considered a rising man and not a bad fellow by his\r\nfriends--per contra greatly over-estimated and a bitter savage critic by\r\nhis enemies. Perhaps they are both right. I have a high standard of\r\nexcellence and am no respecter of persons, and I am afraid I show the\r\nlatter peculiarity rather too much. An internecine feud rages between\r\nOwen and myself (more's the pity) partly on this account, partly from\r\nother causes.\r\n\r\nThis is the account any third person would give you of what I am and of\r\nwhat I am doing. He would probably add that I was very ambitious and\r\ndesirous of occupying a high place in the world's estimation. Therein,\r\nhowever, he would be mistaken. An income sufficient to place me above\r\ncare and anxiety, and free scope to work, are the only things I have\r\never wished for or striven for. But one is obliged to toil long and hard\r\nfor these, and it is only now that they are coming within my grasp. I\r\ngave up the idea of going to Edinburgh because I doubted whether leaving\r\nLondon was wise. Recently I have been tempted to put up for a good\r\nphysiological chair which is to be established at Oxford; but the\r\nGovernment propose to improve my position at the School of Mines, and\r\nthere is every probability that I shall now permanently remain in\r\nLondon. Indeed, it is high time that I should settle down to one line of\r\nwork. Hitherto, as you see by the somewhat varied list of my duties,\r\netc., above, I have been ranging over different parts of a very wide\r\nfield. But this apparent desultoriness has been necessary, for I knew\r\nnot for what branch of science I should eventually have to declare\r\nmyself. There are very few appointments open to men of science in this\r\ncountry, and one must take what one can get and be thankful.\r\n\r\nMy health was very bad some years ago, and I had great fear of becoming\r\na confirmed dyspeptic, but thanks to the pedestrian tours in the Alps I\r\nhave taken for the past two years, I am wonderfully better this session,\r\nand feel capable of any amount of work. It was in the course of one of\r\nthese trips that I went, as you have rightly heard, half way up Mont\r\nBlanc. But I was not in training and stuck at the Grands Mulets, while\r\nmy three companions went on. I spent seventeen hours alone on that grand\r\npinnacle, the latter part of the time in great anxiety, for I feared my\r\nfriends were lost; and as I had no guide my own neck would have been in\r\nconsiderable jeopardy in endeavouring to return amidst the maze of\r\ncrevasses of the Glacier des Bois. But it was glorious weather and the\r\ngrandest scenery in the world. In the previous year I saw much of the\r\nBernese and Monte Rosa country, journeying with a great friend of mine\r\nwell known as a natural philosopher, Tyndall, and partly seeking health\r\nand partly exploring the glaciers. You will find an article of mine on\r\nthat subject in the \"Westminster Review\" for 1857.\r\n\r\nI used at one time to write a good deal for that Review, principally the\r\nQuarterly notice of scientific books. But I never write for the Reviews\r\nnow, as original work is much more to my taste. The articles you refer\r\nto are not mine, as, indeed, you rightly divined. The only considerable\r\nbook I have translated is Kolliker's Histology--in conjunction with Mr.\r\nBusk, an old friend of mine. All translation and article writing is\r\nweary work, and I never do it except for filthy lucre. Lecturing I do\r\nnot like much better; though one way or another I have to give about\r\nsixty or seventy a year.\r\n\r\nNow then, I think that is enough about my \"Ich.\" You shall have a\r\nphotographic image of him and my wife and child as soon as I can find\r\ntime to have them done...\r\n\r\n1 Eldon Place, Broadstairs, September 5, 1858.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI am glad Mrs. Hooker has found rest for the sole of her foot. I\r\nreturned her Tyndall's letter yesterday.\r\n\r\nWallace's impetus seems to have set Darwin going in earnest, and I am\r\nrejoiced to hear we shall learn his views in full, at last. I look\r\nforward to a great revolution being effected. Depend upon it, in natural\r\nhistory, as in everything else, when the English mind fully determines\r\nto work a thing out, it will do it better than any other.\r\n\r\nI firmly believe in the advent of an English epoch in science and art,\r\nwhich will lick the Augustan (which, by the bye, had neither science nor\r\nart in our sense, but you know what I mean) into fits. So hooray, in the\r\nfirst place, for the Genera plantarum. I can quite understand the need\r\nof a new one, and I am right glad you have undertaken it. It seems to me\r\nto be in all respects the sort of work for you, and exactly adapted to\r\nyour environment at Kew. I remember you mentioned to me some time ago\r\nthat you were thinking of it.\r\n\r\nI wish I could even hope that such a thing would be even attempted in\r\nthe course of this generation for animals.\r\n\r\nBut with animal morphology in the state in which it is now, we have no\r\nterminology that will stand, and consequently concise and comparable\r\ndefinitions are in many cases impossible.\r\n\r\nIf old Dom. Gray [John Edward Gray (1800-1875) appointed Keeper of the\r\nZoological Collections in the British Museum in 1840.) were but an\r\nintelligent activity instead of being a sort of zoological whirlwind,\r\nwhat a deal he might do. And I am hopeless of Owen's comprehending what\r\nclassification means since the publication of the wonderful scheme which\r\nadorns the last edition of his lectures.\r\n\r\nAs you say, I have found this a great place for \"work of price.\" I have\r\nfinished the \"Oceanic Hydrozoa\" all but the bookwork, for which I must\r\nhave access to the B. M. Library--but another week will do him. My notes\r\nare from eight to twelve years old, and really I often have felt like\r\nthe editor of somebody else's posthumous work.\r\n\r\nJust now I am busy over the \"Croonian,\" which must be done before I\r\nreturn. I have been pulling at all the arguments as a spider does at his\r\nthreads, and I think they are all strong. If so the thing will do some\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nI am perplexed about the N. H. Collections. The best thing, I firmly\r\nbelieve, would be for the Economic Zoology and a set of well selected\r\ntypes to go to Kensington, but I should be sorry to see the scientific\r\ncollection placed under any such auspices as those which govern the\r\n\"Bilers.\" I don't believe the clay soil of the Regent's Park would\r\nmatter a fraction--and to have a grand scientific zoological and\r\npaleontological collection for working purposes close to the Gardens\r\nwhere the living beasts are, would be a grand thing. I should not wonder\r\nif the affair is greatly discussed at the B. A. at Leeds, and then,\r\nperhaps, light will arise.\r\n\r\nHave you seen that madcap Tyndall's letter in the \"Times?\" He'll break\r\nhis blessed neck some day, and that will be a great hole in the\r\nefficiency of my scientific young England. We mean to return next\r\nSaturday, and somewhere about the 16th of 17th I shall go down to York,\r\nwhere I want to study Plesiosaurs. I shall return after the British\r\nAssociation. The interesting question arises, Shall I have a row with\r\nthe Great O. there? What a capital title that is they give him of the\r\nBRITISH Cuvier. He stands in exactly the same relation to the French as\r\nBritish brandy to cognac.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nAm I to send the \"Gardener's Chronicle\" on, and where? please. I have\r\nmislaid the address.\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, October 25, 1858.\r\n\r\nMy dear Spencer,\r\n\r\nI read your article on the \"Archetype\" the other day with great delight,\r\nparticularly the phrase which puts the Owenian and Cummingian\r\ninterpolations on the same footing. It is rayther strong, but quite\r\njust.\r\n\r\nI do not remember a word to object to, but I think I could have\r\nstrengthened your argument in one or two places. Having eaten the food,\r\nwill you let me have back the dish? I am winding up the \"Croonian,\" and\r\nwant \"L'Archetype\" to refer to. So if you can let me have it I shall be\r\nobliged. When do you return?\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n14 Waverley Place, January 1, 1859.\r\n\r\nMy dearest Lizzie,\r\n\r\nIf intentions were only acts, the quantity of letter paper covered with\r\nmy scrawl which you should have had by this time should have been\r\nsomething wonderful. But I live at high pressure, with always a number\r\nof things crying out to be done, and those that are nearest and call\r\nloudest get done, while the others, too often, don't. However, this day\r\nshall not go by without my wishing you all happiness in the new year,\r\nand that wish you know necessarily includes all belonging to you, and my\r\nlove to them.\r\n\r\nI have been long wanting to send you the photographs of myself, wife,\r\nand boy, but one reason or other (Nettie's incessant ill-health being, I\r\nam sorry to say, the chief) has incessantly delayed the procuring of the\r\nlast. However, at length, we have obtained a tolerably successful one,\r\nthough you must not suppose that Noel has the rather washed out look of\r\nhis portrait. That comes of his fair hair and blue gray eyes--for the\r\nmonkey is like his mother and has not an atom of resemblance to me.\r\n\r\nHe was two years old yesterday, and is the apple of his father's eye and\r\nchief deity of his mother's pantheon, which at present contains only a\r\ngod and goddess. Another is expected shortly, however, so that there is\r\nno fear of Olympus looking empty.\r\n\r\n...Here is the 26th of January and no letter gone yet...Since I began\r\nthis letter I have been very busy with lectures and other sorts of work,\r\nand besides, my whole household almost has been ill--chicks with\r\nwhooping cough, mother with influenza, a servant ditto. I don't know\r\nwhether you have such things in Tennessee.\r\n\r\nLet me see what has happened to me that will interest you since I last\r\nwrote. Did I tell you that I have finally made up my mind to stop in\r\nLondon--the Government having made it worth my while to continue in\r\nJermyn Street? They give me 600 pounds sterling a year now, with a\r\ngradual rise up to 800 pounds sterling, which I reckon as just enough to\r\nlive on if one keeps very quiet. However, it is the greatest possible\r\nblessing to be paid at last, and to be free from all the abominable\r\nanxieties which attend a fluctuating income. I can tell you I have had a\r\nsufficiently hard fight of it.\r\n\r\nWhen Nettie and I were young fools we agreed we would marry whenever we\r\nhad 200 pounds sterling a year. Well, we have had more than twice that\r\nto begin upon, and how it is we have kept out of the Bench is a mystery\r\nto me. But we HAVE, and I am inclined to think that the Missus has got a\r\nprivate hoard (out of the puddings) for Noel.\r\n\r\nI shall leave Nettie to finish this rambling letter. In the meanwhile,\r\nmy best love to you and yours, and mind you are a better correspondent\r\nthan your affectionate brother,\r\n\r\nTom.\r\n\r\n[To Professor Leuckart.]\r\n\r\nThe Government School of Mines, Jermyn Street, London, January 30, 1859.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nOur mutual friend, Dr. Harley, informs me that you have expressed a wish\r\nto become possessed of a separate copy of my lectures, published in the\r\n\"Medical Times.\" I greatly regret that I have not one to send you. The\r\npublisher only gave me half a dozen separate copies of the numbers of\r\nthe journal in which the Lectures appeared. Of these I sent one to\r\nJohannes Muller and one to Professor Victor Carus, and the rest went to\r\nother friends.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to say that a mere fragment of what I originally intended to\r\nhave published has appeared, the series having been concluded when I\r\nreached the end of the Crustacea. To say truth, the Lectures were not\r\nfitted for the journal in which they appeared.\r\n\r\nI did not know that anyone in Germany had noticed them until I received\r\nthe copy of your \"Bericht\" for 1856, which you were kind enough to send\r\nme. I owe you many thanks for the manner in which you speak of them, and\r\nI assure you it was a source of great pleasure and encouragement to me\r\nto find so competent a judge as yourself appreciating and sympathising\r\nwith my objects.\r\n\r\nParticular branches of zoology have been cultivated in this country with\r\ngreat success, as you are well aware, but ten years ago I do not believe\r\nthat there were half a dozen of my countrymen who had the slightest\r\ncomprehension of morphology, and of what you and I should call\r\n\"Wissenschaftliche Zoologie.\"\r\n\r\nThose who thought about the matter at all took Owen's osteological\r\nextravaganzas for the ne plus ultra of morphological speculation.\r\n\r\nI learned the meaning of Morphology and the value of development as the\r\ncriterion of morphological views--first, from the study of the Hydrozoa\r\nduring a long voyage, and secondly, from the writings of Von Baer. I\r\nhave done my best, both by precept and practice, to inaugurate better\r\nmethods and a better spirit than had long prevailed. Others have taken\r\nthe same views, and I confidently hope that a new epoch for zoology is\r\ndawning among us. I do not claim for myself any great share in the good\r\nwork, but I have not flinched when there was anything to be done.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances you will imagine that it was very pleasant to\r\nfind on your side a recognition of what I was about.\r\n\r\nI sent you, through the booksellers, some time ago a copy of my memoir\r\non Aphis. I find from Moleschott's \"Untersuchungen\" that you must have\r\nbeen working at this subject contemporaneously with myself, and it was\r\nvery satisfactory to find so close a concordance in essentials between\r\nour results. Your memoirs are extremely interesting, and to some extent\r\nanticipated results at which my friend, Mr. Lubbock [The present Sir\r\nJohn Lubbock, M.P.] (a very competent worker, with whose paper on\r\nDaphnia you are doubtless acquainted), had arrived.\r\n\r\nI should be very glad to know what you think of my views of the\r\ncomposition of the articulate head.\r\n\r\nI have been greatly interested also in your Memoir on Pentastomum. There\r\ncan be no difficulty about getting a notice of it in our journals, and,\r\nindeed, I will see to it myself. Pray do me the favour to let me know\r\nwhenever I can serve you in this or other ways.\r\n\r\nI shall do myself the pleasure of forwarding to you immediately, through\r\nthe booksellers, a lecture of mine on the Theory of the Vertebrate\r\nSkull, which is just published, and also a little paper on the\r\ndevelopment of the tail in fishes.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to say that I have but little time for working at these\r\nmatters now, as my position at the School of Mines obliges me to confine\r\nmyself more and more to Paleontology.\r\n\r\nHowever, I keep to the anatomical side of that sort of work, and so, now\r\nand then, I hope to emerge from amidst the fossils with a bit of recent\r\nanatomy.\r\n\r\nJust at present, by the way, I am giving my disposable hours to the\r\ncompletion of a monograph on the Calycophoridae and Physophoridae\r\nobserved during my voyage. The book ought to have been published eight\r\nyears ago. But for three years I could get no money from the Government,\r\nand in the meanwhile you and Kolliker, Gegenbaur and Vogt, went to the\r\nshores of the Mediterranean and made sad havoc with my novelties. Then\r\ncame occupations consequent on my appointment to the chair I now hold;\r\nand it was only last autumn that I had leisure to take up the subject\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nHowever, the plates, which I hope you will see in a few months have,\r\nwith two exceptions, been engraved five years.\r\n\r\nPray make my remembrances to Dr. Eckhard. I was sorry not to have seen\r\nhim again in London.\r\n\r\nEver, my dear Sir, very faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nProfessor Leuckart.\r\n\r\n[At this time Sir J. Hooker was writing, as an introduction to his\r\n\"Flora of Tasmania,\" his essay on the \"Flora of Australia,\" published in\r\n1859--a book which owed its form to the influence of Darwin, and in\r\nreturn lent weighty support to evolutionary theory from the botanical\r\nside. He sent his proofs for Huxley to read.\r\n\r\n14 Waverley Place, N.W., April 22, 1859.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI have read your proofs with a great deal of attention and interest. I\r\nwas greatly struck with the suggestions in the first page, and the\r\nexposure of the fallacy \"that cultivated forms recur to wild types if\r\nleft alone\" is new to me and seems of vast importance.\r\n\r\nThe argument brought forward in the note is very striking and as simple\r\nas the egg of Columbus, when one sees it. I have marked one or two\r\npassages which are not quite clear to me...\r\n\r\nI have been accused of writing papers composed of nothing but heads of\r\nchapters, and I think you tend the same way. Please take the trouble to\r\nmake the two lines I have scored into a paragraph, so that poor devils\r\nwho are not quite so well up in the subject as yourself may not have to\r\nrack their brains for an hour to supply all the links of your chain of\r\nargument...\r\n\r\nYou see that I am in a carping humour, but the matter of the essays\r\nseems to me to be so very valuable that I am jealous of the manner of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI had a long visit from Greene of Cork yesterday. He is very Irish, but\r\nvery intelligent and well-informed, and I am in hopes he will do good\r\nservice. He is writing a little book on the Protozoa, which (so far as I\r\nhave glanced over the proof sheets as yet) seems to show a very\r\nphilosophical turn of mind. It is very satisfactory to find the ideas\r\none has been fighting for beginning to take root.\r\n\r\nI do not suppose my own personal contributions to science will ever be\r\nanything very grand, but I shall be well content if I have reason to\r\nbelieve that I have done something to stir up others.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[To the same:--]\r\n\r\nApril, 1859.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\n...I pity you--as for the MSS. it is one of those cases for which\r\npenances were originally devised. What do you say to standing on your\r\nhead in the garden for one hour per diem for the next week? It would be\r\na relief...\r\n\r\nI suppose you will be at the Phil. Club next Monday. In the meanwhile\r\ndon't let all the flesh be worried off your bones (there isn't much as\r\nit is).\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n14 Waverley Place, July 29, 1859.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI meant to have written to you yesterday, but things put it out of my\r\nhead. If there is to be any fund raised at all, I am quite of your mind\r\nthat it should be a scientific fund and not a mere naturalists' fund.\r\nSectarianism in such matters is ridiculous, and besides that, in this\r\nparticular case it is bad policy. For the word \"Naturalist\"\r\nunfortunately includes a far lower order of men than chemist, physicist,\r\nor mathematician. You don't call a man a mathematician because he has\r\nspent his life in getting as far as quadratics; but every fool who can\r\nmake bad species and worse genera is a \"Naturalist\"!--save the mark!\r\nImagine the chemists petitioning the Crown for a Pension for P-- if he\r\nwanted one! and yet he really is a philosopher compared to poor dear\r\nA--.\r\n\r\n\"Naturalists\" therefore are far more likely to want help than any other\r\nclass of scientific men, and they would be greatly damaging their own\r\ninterests if they formed an exclusive fund for themselves.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.13.\r\n\r\n1859.\r\n\r\n[In November 1859 the \"Origin of Species\" was published, and a new\r\ndirection was given to Huxley's activities. Ever since Darwin and\r\nWallace had made their joint communication to the Linnean Society in the\r\npreceding July, expectation had been rife as to the forthcoming book.\r\nHuxley was one of the few privileged to learn Darwin's argument before\r\nit was given to the world; but the greatness of the book, mere\r\ninstalment as it was of the long accumulated mass of notes, almost took\r\nhim by surprise. Before this time, he had taken up a thoroughly agnostic\r\nattitude with regard to the species question, for he could not accept\r\nthe creational theory, yet sought in vain among the transmutationists\r\nfor any cause adequate to produce transmutation. He had had many talks\r\nwith Darwin, and though ready enough to accept the main point,\r\nmaintained such a critical attitude on many others, that Darwin was not\r\nby any means certain of the effect the published book would produce upon\r\nhim. Indeed, in his 1857 notebook, I find jotted down under the head of\r\nhis paper on Pygocephalus (read at the Geological Society),]\r\n\"anti-progressive confession of faith.\" [Darwin was the more anxious,\r\nas, when he first put pen to paper, he had fixed in his mind three\r\njudges, by whose decision he determined mentally to abide. These three\r\nwere Lyell, Hooker, and Huxley. If these three came round, partly\r\nthrough the book, partly through their own reflections, he could feel\r\nthat the subject was safe. \"No one,\" writes Darwin on November 13, \"has\r\nread it, except Lyell, with whom I have had much correspondence. Hooker\r\nthinks him a complete convert, but he does not seem so in his letters to\r\nme; but is evidently deeply interested in the subject.\" And again: \"I\r\nthink I told you before that Hooker is a complete convert. If I can\r\nconvert Huxley I shall be content.\" (\"Life\" volume 2 page 221.)\r\n\r\nOn all three, the effect of the book itself, with its detailed arguments\r\nand overwhelming array of evidence, was far greater than that of\r\nprevious discussions. With one or two reservations as to the logical\r\ncompleteness of the theory, Huxley accepted it as a well-founded working\r\nhypothesis, calculated to explain problems otherwise inexplicable.\r\n\r\nTwo extracts from the chapter he contributed to the \"Life of Darwin\"\r\nshow very clearly his attitude of mind when the \"Origin of Species\" was\r\nfirst published:--]\r\n\r\nExtract from \"The Reception of the 'Origin of Species'\" in \"Life and\r\nLetters of Charles Darwin\" volume 2 pages 187-90 and 195-97.\r\n\r\nI think I must have read the \"Vestiges\" before I left England in 1846;\r\nbut, if I did, the book made very little impression upon me, and I was\r\nnot brought into serious contact with the \"Species\" question until after\r\n1850. At that time, I had long done with the Pentateuchal cosmogony,\r\nwhich had been impressed upon my childish understanding as Divine truth,\r\nwith all the authority of parents and instructors, and from which it had\r\ncost me many a struggle to get free. But my mind was unbiassed in\r\nrespect of any doctrine which presented itself, if it professed to be\r\nbased on purely philosophical and scientific reasoning. It seemed to me\r\nthen (as it does now) that \"creation,\" in the ordinary sense of the\r\nword, is perfectly conceivable. I find no difficulty in conceiving that,\r\nat some former period, this universe was not in existence; and that it\r\nmade its appearance in six days (or instantaneously, if that is\r\npreferred), in consequence of the volition of some pre-existing Being.\r\nThen, as now, the so-called a priori arguments against Theism; and,\r\ngiven a Deity, against the possibility of creative acts, appeared to me\r\nto be devoid of reasonable foundation. I had not then, and I have not\r\nnow, the smallest a priori objection to raise to the account of the\r\ncreation of animals and plants given in \"Paradise Lost,\" in which Milton\r\nso vividly embodies the natural sense of Genesis. Far be it from me to\r\nsay that it is untrue because it is impossible. I confine myself to what\r\nmust be regarded as a modest and reasonable request for some particle of\r\nevidence that the existing species of animals and plants did originate\r\nin that way, as a condition of my belief in a statement which appears to\r\nme to be highly improbable.\r\n\r\nAnd, by way of being perfectly fair, I had exactly the same answer to\r\ngive to the evolutionists of 1851-8. Within the ranks of the biologists,\r\nat that time, I met with nobody, except Dr. Grant of University College,\r\nwho had a word to say for Evolution--and his advocacy was not calculated\r\nto advance the cause. Outside these ranks, the only person known to me\r\nwhose knowledge and capacity compelled respect, and who was, at the same\r\ntime, a thorough-going evolutionist, was Mr. Herbert Spencer, whose\r\nacquaintance I made, I think, in 1852, and then entered into the bonds\r\nof a friendship which, I am happy to think, has known no interruption.\r\nMany and prolonged were the battles we fought on this topic. But even my\r\nfriend's rare dialectic skill and copiousness of apt illustration could\r\nnot drive me from my agnostic position. I took my stand upon two\r\ngrounds:--Firstly, that up to that time, the evidence in favour of\r\ntransmutation was wholly insufficient; and secondly, that no suggestion\r\nrespecting the causes of transmutation assumed, which had been made, was\r\nin any way adequate to explain the phenomena. Looking back at the state\r\nof knowledge at that time, I really do not see that any other conclusion\r\nwas justifiable.\r\n\r\nIn those days I had never even heard of Treviranus' \"Biologie.\" However,\r\nI had studied Lamarck attentively and I had read the \"Vestiges\" with due\r\ncare; but neither of them afforded me any good ground for changing my\r\nnegative and critical attitude. As for the \"Vestiges,\" I confess that\r\nthe book simply irritated me by the prodigious ignorance and thoroughly\r\nunscientific habit of mind manifested by the writer. If it had any\r\ninfluence on me at all, it set me against Evolution; and the only review\r\nI ever have qualms of conscience about, on the ground of needless\r\nsavagery, is one I wrote on the \"Vestiges\" while under that influence...\r\n\r\nBut, by a curious irony of fate, the same influence which led me to put\r\nas little faith in modern speculations on this subject as in the\r\nvenerable traditions recorded in the first two chapters of Genesis, was\r\nperhaps more potent than any other in keeping alive a sort of pious\r\nconviction that Evolution, after all, would turn out true. I have\r\nrecently read afresh the first edition of the \"Principles of Geology\";\r\nand when I consider that this remarkable book had been nearly thirty\r\nyears in everybody's hands, and that it brings home to any reader of\r\nordinary intelligence a great principle and a great fact,--the principle\r\nthat the past must be explained by the present, unless good cause be\r\nshown to the contrary; and the fact that so far as our knowledge of the\r\npast history of life on our globe goes, no such cause can be shown--I\r\ncannot but believe that Lyell, for others, as for myself, was the chief\r\nagent in smoothing the road for Darwin. For consistent uniformitarianism\r\npostulates Evolution as much in the organic as in the inorganic world.\r\nThe origin of a new species by other than ordinary agencies would be a\r\nvastly greater \"catastrophe\" than any of those which Lyell successfully\r\neliminated from sober geological speculation.\r\n\r\nThus, looking back into the past, it seems to me that my own position of\r\ncritical expectancy was just and reasonable, and must have been taken\r\nup, on the same grounds, by many other persons. If Agassiz told me that\r\nthe forms of life which have successively tenanted the globe were the\r\nincarnations of successive thoughts of the Deity; and that he had wiped\r\nout one set of these embodiments by an appalling geological catastrophe\r\nas soon as His ideas took a more advanced shape, I found myself not only\r\nunable to admit the accuracy of the deductions from the facts of\r\npaleontology, upon which this astounding hypothesis was founded, but I\r\nhad to confess my want of any means of testing the correctness of his\r\nexplanation of them. And besides that, I could by no means see what the\r\nexplanation explained. Neither did it help me to be told by an eminent\r\nanatomist that species had succeeded one another in time, in virtue of\r\n\"a continuously operative creational law.\" That seemed to me to be no\r\nmore than saying that species had succeeded one another in the form of a\r\nvote-catching resolution, with \"law\" to catch the man of science, and\r\n\"creational\" to draw the orthodox. So I took refuge in that \"thatige\r\nSkepsis\" which Goethe has so well defined; and, reversing the apostolic\r\nprecept to be all things to all men, I usually defended the tenability\r\nof the received doctrines when I had to do with the transmutationist;\r\nand stood up for the possibility of transmutation among the\r\northodox--thereby, no doubt, increasing an already current, but quite\r\nundeserved, reputation for needless combativeness.\r\n\r\nI remember, in the course of my first interview with Mr. Darwin,\r\nexpressing my belief in the sharpness of the lines of demarcation\r\nbetween natural groups and in the absence of transitional forms, with\r\nall the confidence of youth and imperfect knowledge. I was not aware, at\r\nthat time, that he had then been many years brooding over the\r\nspecies-question; and the humorous smile which accompanied his gentle\r\nanswer, that such was not altogether his view, long haunted and puzzled\r\nme. But it would seem that four or five years' hard work had enabled me\r\nto understand what it meant; for Lyell, writing to Sir Charles Bunbury\r\n(under date of April 30, 1856), says:--\r\n\r\n\"When Huxley, Hooker, and Wollaston were at Darwin's last week they (all\r\nfour of them) ran a tilt against species--further, I believe, than they\r\nare prepared to go.\"\r\n\r\nI recollect nothing of this beyond the fact of meeting Mr. Wollaston;\r\nand except for Sir Charles's distinct assurance as to \"all four,\" I\r\nshould have thought my outrecuidance was probably a counterblast to\r\nWollaston's conservatism. With regard to Hooker, he was already, like\r\nVoltaire's Habbakuk, capable du tout in the way of advocating Evolution.\r\n\r\nAs I have already said, I imagine that most of those of my\r\ncontemporaries who thought seriously about the matter, were very much in\r\nmy own state of mind--inclined to say to both Mosaists and\r\nEvolutionists, \"a plague on both your houses!\" and disposed to turn\r\naside from an interminable and apparently fruitless discussion, to\r\nlabour in the fertile fields of ascertainable fact. And I may therefore\r\nsuppose that the publication of the Darwin and Wallace paper in 1858,\r\nand still more that of the \"Origin\" in 1859, had the effect upon them of\r\nthe flash of light which, to a man who has lost himself on a dark night,\r\nsuddenly reveals a road which, whether it takes him straight home or\r\nnot, certainly goes his way. That which we were looking for, and could\r\nnot find, was a hypothesis respecting the origin of known organic forms\r\nwhich assumed the operation of no causes but such as could be proved to\r\nbe actually at work. We wanted, not to pin our faith to that or any\r\nother speculation, but to get hold of clear and definite conceptions\r\nwhich could be brought face to face with facts and have their validity\r\ntested. The \"Origin\" provided us with the working hypothesis we sought.\r\nMoreover, it did the immense service of freeing us for ever from the\r\ndilemma--Refuse to accept the creation hypothesis, and what have you to\r\npropose that can be accepted by any cautious reasoner? In 1857 I had no\r\nanswer ready, and I do not think that anyone else had. A year later we\r\nreproached ourselves with dulness for being perplexed with such an\r\ninquiry. My reflection, when I first made myself master of the central\r\nidea of the \"Origin\" was, \"How extremely stupid not to have thought of\r\nthat!\" I suppose that Columbus' companions said much the same when he\r\nmade the egg stand on end. The facts of variability, of the struggle for\r\nexistence, of adaptation to conditions, were notorious enough; but none\r\nof us had suspected that the road to the heart of the species problem\r\nlay through them, until Darwin and Wallace dispelled the darkness, and\r\nthe beacon-fire of the \"Origin\" guided the benighted.\r\n\r\nWhether the particular shape which the doctrine of Evolution, as applied\r\nto the organic world, took in Darwin's hands, would prove to be final or\r\nnot, was to me a matter of indifference. In my earliest criticisms of\r\nthe \"Origin\" I ventured to point out that its logical foundation was\r\ninsecure so long as experiments in selective breeding had not produced\r\nvarieties which were more or less infertile; and that insecurity remains\r\nup to the present time. But, with any and every critical doubt which my\r\nsceptical ingenuity could suggest, the Darwinian hypothesis remained\r\nincomparably more probable than the creation hypothesis. And if we had\r\nnone of us been able to discern the paramount significance of some of\r\nthe most patent and notorious of natural facts, until they were, so to\r\nspeak, thrust under our noses, what force remained in the\r\ndilemma--creation or nothing? It was obvious that hereafter the\r\nprobability would be immensely greater, that the links of natural\r\ncausation were hidden from our purblind eyes, than that natural\r\ncausation should be incompetent to produce all the phenomena of nature.\r\nThe only rational course for those who had no other object than the\r\nattainment of truth was to accept \"Darwinism\" as a working hypothesis\r\nand see what could be made of it. Either it would prove its capacity to\r\nelucidate the facts of organic life, or it would break down under the\r\nstrain. This was surely the dictate of common sense; and, for once,\r\ncommon sense carried the day.\r\n\r\n[Even before the \"Origin\" actually came out, Huxley had begun to act as\r\nwhat Darwin afterwards called his \"general agent.\" He began to prepare\r\nthe way for the acceptance of the theory of evolution by discussing, for\r\ninstance, one of the most obvious difficulties, namely, How is it that\r\nif evolution is ever progressive, progress is not universal? It was a\r\npoint with respect to which Darwin himself wrote soon after the\r\npublication of the \"Origin\":--\"Judging from letters...and from remarks,\r\nthe most serious omission in my book was not explaining how it is, as I\r\nbelieve, that all forms do not necessarily advance, how there can now be\r\nSIMPLE organisms existing.\" (May 22, 1860.)\r\n\r\nHuxley's idea, then, was to call attention to the persistence of many\r\ntypes without appreciable progression during geological time; to show\r\nthat this fact was not explicable on any other hypothesis than that put\r\nforward by Darwin; and by paleontological arguments, to pave the way for\r\nconsideration of the imperfection of the geological record.\r\n\r\nSuch were the lines on which he delivered his Friday evening lecture on\r\n\"Persistent Types\" at the Royal Institution on June 3,1859.\r\n\r\nHowever, the chief part which he took at this time in extending the\r\ndoctrines of evolution was in applying them to his own subjects,\r\nDevelopment and Vertebrate Anatomy, and more particularly to the\r\nquestion of the origin of mankind.\r\n\r\nOf all the burning questions connected with the Origin of Species, this\r\nwas the most heated--the most surrounded by prejudice and passion. To\r\ntouch it was to court attack; to be exposed to endless scorn, ridicule,\r\nmisrepresentation, abuse--almost to social ostracism. But the facts were\r\nthere; the structural likenesses between the apes and man had already\r\nbeen shown; and as Huxley warned Darwin,] \"I will stop at no point so\r\nlong as clear reasoning will carry me further.\"\r\n\r\n[Now two years before the \"Origin\" appeared, the denial of these facts\r\nby a leading anatomist led Huxley, as was his wont, to re-investigate\r\nthe question for himself and satisfy himself one way or the other. He\r\nfound that the previous investigators were not mistaken. Without going\r\nout of his way to refute the mis-statement as publicly as it was made,\r\nhe simply embodied his results in his regular teaching. But the\r\nopportunity came unsought. Fortified by his own researches, he openly\r\nchallenged these assertions when repeated at the Oxford meeting of the\r\nBritish Association in 1860, and promised to made good his challenge in\r\nthe proper place.\r\n\r\nWe also find him combating some of the difficulties in the way of\r\naccepting the theory laid before him by Sir Charles Lyell. The veteran\r\ngeologist had been Darwin's confidant from almost the beginning of his\r\nspeculations; he had really paved the way for the evolutionary doctrine\r\nby his own proof of geological uniformity, but he shrank from accepting\r\nit, for its inevitable extension to the descent of man was repugnant to\r\nhis feelings. Nevertheless, he would not allow sentiment to stand in the\r\nway of truth, and after the publication of the \"Origin\" it could be said\r\nof him:--]\r\n\r\nLyell, up to that time a pillar of the anti-transmutationists (who\r\nregarded him, ever afterwards, as Pallas Athene may have looked at Dian,\r\nafter the Endymion affair), declared himself a Darwinian, though not\r\nwithout putting in a serious caveat. Nevertheless, he was a tower of\r\nstrength, and his courageous stand for truth as against consistency did\r\nhim infinite honour. (T.H. Huxley in \"Life of Darwin\" volume 2 page\r\n231.)\r\n\r\n[To Sir Charles Lyell.]\r\n\r\nJune 25, 1859.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir Charles,\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to meet your objections in the enclosed.\r\n\r\nEver yours, very truly,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nThe fixity and definite limitation of species, genera, and larger groups\r\nappear to me to be perfectly consistent with the theory of\r\ntransmutation. In other words, I think TRANSMUTATION may take place\r\nwithout transition.\r\n\r\nSuppose that external conditions acting on species A give rise to a new\r\nspecies, B; the difference between the two species is a certain\r\ndefinable amount which may be called A-B. Now I know of no evidence to\r\nshow that the interval between the two species must NECESSARILY be\r\nbridged over by a series of forms, each of which shall occupy, as it\r\noccurs, a fraction of the distance between A and B. On the contrary, in\r\nthe history of the Ancon sheep, and of the six-fingered Maltese family,\r\ngiven by Reaumur, it appears that the new form appeared at once in full\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nI may illustrate what I mean by a chemical example. In an organic\r\ncompound, having a precise and definite composition, you may effect all\r\nsorts of transmutations by substituting an atom of one element for an\r\natom of another element. You may in this way produce a vast series of\r\nmodifications--but each modification is definite in its composition, and\r\nthere are no transitional or intermediate steps between one definite\r\ncompound and another. I have a sort of notion that similar laws of\r\ndefinite combination rule over the modifications of organic bodies, and\r\nthat in passing from species to species \"Natura fecit saltum.\"\r\n\r\nAll my studies lead me to believe more and more in the absence of any\r\nreal transitions between natural groups, great and small--but with what\r\nwe know of the physiology of conditions [?] this opinion seems to me to\r\nbe quite consistent with transmutation.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that no evidence, or hardly any, would justify one in\r\nbelieving in the view of a new species of Elephant, e.g. out of the\r\nearth, I mean that such an occurrence would be so diametrically contrary\r\nto all experience, so opposed to those beliefs which are the most\r\nconstantly verified by experience, that one would be justified in\r\nbelieving either that one's senses were deluded, or that one had not\r\nreally got to the bottom of the phenomenon. Of course, if one could vary\r\nthe conditions, if one could take a little silex, and by a little\r\nhocus-pocus a la crosse, galvanise a baby out of it as often as one\r\npleased, all the philosopher could do would be to hold up his hands and\r\ncry, \"God is great.\" But short of evidence of this kind, I don't mean to\r\nbelieve anything of the kind.\r\n\r\nHow much evidence would you require to believe that there was a time\r\nwhen stones fell upwards, or granite made itself by a spontaneous\r\nrearrangement of the elementary particles of clay and sand? And yet the\r\ndifficulties in the way of these beliefs are as nothing compared to\r\nthose which you would have to overcome in believing that complex organic\r\nbeings made themselves (for that is what creation comes to in scientific\r\nlanguage) out of inorganic matter.\r\n\r\nI know it will be said that even on the transmutation theory, the first\r\norganic being must have made itself. But there is as much difference\r\nbetween supposing the passage of inorganic matter into an AMOEBA, e.g.,\r\nand into an ELEPHANT, as there is between supposing that Portland stone\r\nmight have built itself up into St. Paul's, and believing that the\r\nGiant's Causeway may have come about by natural causes.\r\n\r\nTrue, one must believe in a beginning somewhere, but science consists in\r\nnot believing the having reached that beginning before one is forced to\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\nIt is wholly impossible to prove that any phenomenon whatsoever is not\r\nproduced by the interposition of some unknown cause. But philosophy has\r\nprospered exactly as it has disregarded such possibilities, and has\r\nendeavoured to resolve every event by ordinary reasoning.\r\n\r\nI do not exactly see the force of your argument that we are bound to\r\nfind fossil forms intermediate between men and monkeys in the Rocks.\r\nCrocodiles are the highest reptiles as men are the highest mammals, but\r\nwe find nothing intermediate between CROCODILIA and LACERTILIA in the\r\nwhole range of the Mesozoic rocks. How do we know that Man is not a\r\npersistent type? And as for implements, at this day, and as, I suppose,\r\nfor the last two or three thousand years at least, the savages of\r\nAustralia have made their weapons of nothing but bone and wood. Why\r\nshould HOMO EOCENUS or OOLITICUS, the fellows who waddied the\r\nAMPHITHERIUM and speared the PHASCOLOTHERIUM as the Australian niggers\r\ntreat their congeners, have been more advanced?\r\n\r\nI by no means suppose that the transmutation hypothesis is proven or\r\nanything like it. But I view it as a powerful instrument of research.\r\nFollow it out, and it will lead us somewhere; while the other notion is\r\nlike all the modifications of \"final causation,\" a barren virgin.\r\n\r\nAnd I would very strongly urge upon you that it is the logical\r\ndevelopment of Uniformitarianism, and that its adoption would harmonise\r\nthe spirit of Paleontology with that of Physical Geology.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.14.\r\n\r\n1859-1860.\r\n\r\n[The \"Origin\" appeared in November. As soon as he had read it, Huxley\r\nwrote the following letter to Darwin (already published in \"Life of\r\nDarwin\" volume 2 page 231):--\r\n\r\nJermyn Street W., November 23, 1859.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nI finished your book yesterday, a lucky examination having furnished me\r\nwith a few hours of continuous leisure.\r\n\r\nSince I read Von Baer's essays, nine years ago, no work on Natural\r\nHistory Science I have met with has made so great an impression upon me,\r\nand I do most heartily thank you for the great store of new views you\r\nhave given me. Nothing, I think, can be better than the tone of the\r\nbook--it impresses those who know about the subject. As for your\r\ndoctrine, I am prepared to go to the stake, if requisite, in support of\r\nChapter 9 [The Imperfection of the Geological Record], and most parts of\r\nChapters 10 [The Geological Succession of Organic Beings], 11, 12\r\n[Geographical Distribution], and Chapter 13 [Classification, Morphology,\r\nEmbryology, and Rudimentary Organs] contains much that is most\r\nadmirable, but on one or two points I enter a caveat until I can see\r\nfurther into all sides of the question.\r\n\r\nAs to the first four chapters [Chapter 1, Variation under Domestication;\r\n2, Variation under Nature; 3, The Struggle for Existence; 4, Operation\r\nof Natural Selection; 5, Laws of Variation], I agree thoroughly and\r\nfully with all the principles laid down in them. I think you have\r\ndemonstrated a true cause for the production of species, and have thrown\r\nthe onus probandi, that species did not arise in the way you suppose, on\r\nyour adversaries.\r\n\r\nBut I feel that I have not yet by any means fully realised the bearings\r\nof those most remarkable and original Chapters--III, IV, and V, and I\r\nwill write no more about them just now.\r\n\r\nThe only objections that have occurred to me are--1st, That you have\r\nloaded yourself with an unnecessary difficulty in adopting Natura non\r\nfacit saltum so unreservedly; and 2nd, It is not clear to me why, if\r\ncontinual physical conditions are of so little moment as you suppose,\r\nvariation should occur at all.\r\n\r\nHowever, I must read the book two or three times more before I presume\r\nto begin picking holes.\r\n\r\nI trust you will not allow yourself to be in any way disgusted or\r\nannoyed by the considerable abuse and misrepresentation which, unless I\r\ngreatly mistake, is in store for you. Depend upon it, you have earned\r\nthe lasting gratitude of all thoughtful men. And as to the curs which\r\nwill bark and yelp, you must recollect that some of your friends, at any\r\nrate, are endowed with an amount of combativeness which (though you have\r\noften and justly rebuked it) may stand you in good stead.\r\n\r\nI am sharpening up my claws and beak in readiness.\r\n\r\nLooking back over my letter, it really expresses so feebly all I think\r\nabout you and your noble book, that I am half-ashamed of it; but you\r\nwill understand that, like the parrot in the story, \"I think the more.\"\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[A month later, fortune put into his hands the opportunity of striking a\r\nvigorous and telling blow for the newly-published book. Never was\r\nwindfall more eagerly accepted. A short account of this lucky chance was\r\nwritten by him for the Darwin \"Life\" (volume 1 page 255).]\r\n\r\nThe \"Origin\" was sent to Mr. Lucas, one of the staff of the \"Times\"\r\nwriters at that day, in what was I suppose the ordinary course of\r\nbusiness. Mr. Lucas, though an excellent journalist, and at a later\r\nperiod, editor of \"Once a Week,\" was as innocent of any knowledge of\r\nscience as a babe, and be wailed himself to an acquaintance on having to\r\ndeal with such a book. Whereupon, he was recommended to ask me to get\r\nhim out of his difficulty, and he applied to me accordingly, explaining,\r\nhowever, that it would be necessary for him formally to adopt anything I\r\nmight be disposed to write, by prefacing it with two or three paragraphs\r\nof his own.\r\n\r\nI was too anxious to seize upon the opportunity thus offered of giving\r\nthe book a fair chance with the multitudinous readers of the \"Times,\" to\r\nmake any difficulty about conditions; and being then very full of the\r\nsubject, I wrote the article faster, I think, than I ever wrote anything\r\nin my life, and sent it to Mr. Lucas, who duly prefixed his opening\r\nsentences.\r\n\r\nWhen the article appeared, there was much speculation as to its\r\nauthorship. The secret leaked out in time, as all secrets will, but not\r\nby my aid; and then I used to derive a good deal of innocent amusement\r\nfrom the vehement assertions of some of my more acute friends, that they\r\nknew it was mine from the first paragraph!\r\n\r\nAs the \"Times\" some years since, referred to my connection with the\r\nreview, I suppose there will be no breach of confidence in the\r\npublication of this little history, if you think it worth the space it\r\nwill occupy.\r\n\r\n[The article appeared on December 26. Only Hooker was admitted into the\r\nsecret. In an undated note Huxley writes to him:--]\r\n\r\nI have written the other review you wot of, and have handed it over to\r\nmy friend to deal as he likes with it...Darwin will laugh over a letter\r\nthat I sent him this morning with a vignette of the Jermyn Street \"pet\"\r\nready to fight his battle, and the \"judicious Hooker\" holding the\r\nbottle.\r\n\r\n[And on December 31 he writes again:--]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, December 31, 1859.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI have not the least objection to my share in the \"Times\" article being\r\nknown, only I should not like to have anything stated on my authority.\r\nThe fact is, that the first quarter of the first column (down to \"what\r\nis a species,\" etc.) is not mine, but belongs to the man who is the\r\nofficial reviewer for the \"Times\" (my \"Temporal\" godfather I might call\r\nhim).\r\n\r\nThe rest is my ipsissima verba, and I only wonder that it turns out as\r\nwell as it does--for I wrote it faster than ever I wrote anything in my\r\nlife. The last column nearly as fast as my wife could read the sheets.\r\nBut I was thoroughly in the humour and full of the subject. Of course as\r\na scientific review the thing is worth nothing, but I earnestly hope it\r\nmay have made some of the educated mob, who derive their ideas from the\r\n\"Times,\" reflect. And whatever they do, they SHALL respect Darwin.\r\n\r\nPray give my kindest regards and best wishes for the New Year to Mrs.\r\nHooker, and tell her that if she, of her own natural sagacity and\r\nknowledge of the naughtiness of my heart, affirms that I wrote the\r\narticle, I shall not contradict her--but that for reasons of state--I\r\nmust not be supposed to say anything. I am pretty certain the Saturday\r\narticle was not written by Owen. On internal grounds, because no word in\r\nit exceeds an inch in length; on external, from what Cook said to me.\r\nThe article is weak enough and one-sided enough, but looking at the\r\nvarious forces in action, I think Cook has fully redeemed his promise to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI went down to Sir P. Egerton on Tuesday--was ill when I started, got\r\nworse and had to come back on Thursday. I am all adrift now, but I\r\ncouldn't stand being in the house any longer. I wish I had been born an\r\nan-hepatous foetus.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of good wishes to you, and may you and I and Tyndalides, and\r\none or two more bricks, be in as good fighting order in 1861 as in 1860.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[Speaking of this period and the half-dozen preceding years, in his 1894\r\npreface to \"Man's Place in Nature\" he says:--]\r\n\r\nAmong the many problems which came under my consideration, the position\r\nof the human species in zoological classification was one of the most\r\nserious. Indeed, at that time it was a burning question in the sense\r\nthat those who touched it were almost certain to burn their fingers\r\nseverely. It was not so very long since my kind friend, Sir William\r\nLawrence, one of the ablest men whom I have known, had been well-nigh\r\nostracised for his book \"On Man,\" which now might be read in a Sunday\r\nschool without surprising anybody; it was only a few years since the\r\nelectors to the chair of Natural History in a famous northern university\r\nhad refused to invite a very distinguished man to occupy it because he\r\nadvocated the doctrine of the diversity of species of mankind, or what\r\nwas called \"polygeny.\" Even among those who considered man from the\r\npoint of view, not of vulgar prejudice, but of science, opinions lay\r\npoles asunder. Linnaeus had taken one view, Cuvier another; and among my\r\nsenior contemporaries, men like Lyell, regarded by many as\r\nrevolutionaries of the deepest dye, were strongly opposed to anything\r\nwhich tended to break down the barrier between man and the rest of the\r\nanimal world.\r\n\r\nMy own mind was by no means definitely made up about this matter when,\r\nin the year 1857, a paper was read before the Linnean Society \"On the\r\nCharacters, Principles of Division and Primary Groups of the Class\r\nMammalia,\" in which certain anatomical features of the brain were said\r\nto be \"peculiar to the genus 'Homo,'\" and were made the chief ground for\r\nseparating that genus from all other mammals and placing him in a\r\ndivision, \"Archencephala,\" apart from, and superior to, all the rest. As\r\nthese statements did not agree with the opinions I had formed, I set to\r\nwork to reinvestigate the subject; and soon satisfied myself that the\r\nstructures in question were not peculiar to Man, but were shared by him\r\nwith all the higher and many of the lower apes. I embarked in no public\r\ndiscussion of these matters, but my attention being thus drawn to them,\r\nI studied the whole question of the structural relations of Man to the\r\nnext lower existing forms, with much care. And, of course, I embodied my\r\nconclusions in my teaching.\r\n\r\nMatters were at this point when the \"Origin of Species\" appeared. The\r\nweighty sentence, \"Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his\r\nhistory\" (1st edition page 488), was not only in full harmony with the\r\nconclusions at which I had arrived respecting the structural relations\r\nof apes and men, but was strongly supported by them. And inasmuch as\r\nDevelopment and Vertebrate Anatomy were not among Mr. Darwin's many\r\nspecialities, it appeared to me that I should not be intruding on the\r\nground he had made his own, if I discussed this part of the general\r\nquestion. In fact, I thought that I might probably serve the cause of\r\nEvolution by doing so.\r\n\r\nSome experience of popular lecturing had convinced me that the necessity\r\nof making things clear to uninstructed people was one of the very best\r\nmeans of clearing up the obscure corners in one's own mind. So, in 1860,\r\nI took the Relation of Man to the lower Animals for the subject of the\r\nsix lectures to working men which it was my duty to deliver. It was also\r\nin 1860 that this topic was discussed before a jury of experts at the\r\nmeeting of the British Association at Oxford, and from that time a sort\r\nof running fight on the same subject was carried on, until it culminated\r\nat the Cambridge Meeting of the Association in 1862, by my friend Sir W.\r\nFlower's public demonstration of the existence in the apes of those\r\ncerebral characters which had been said to be peculiar to man.\r\n\r\n[The famous Oxford Meeting of 1860 was of no small importance in\r\nHuxley's career. It was not merely that he helped to save a great cause\r\nfrom being stifled under misrepresentation and ridicule--that he helped\r\nto extort for it a fair hearing; it was now that he first made himself\r\nknown in popular estimation as a dangerous adversary in debate--a\r\npersonal force in the world of science which could not be neglected.\r\nFrom this moment he entered the front fighting line in the most exposed\r\nquarter of the field.\r\n\r\nMost unluckily, no contemporary account of his own exists of the\r\nencounter. Indeed, the same cause which prevented his writing home the\r\nstory of the day's work nearly led to his absence from the scene. It was\r\nknown that Bishop Wilberforce, whose first class in mathematics gave\r\nhim, in popular estimation, a right to treat on scientific matters,\r\nintended to \"smash Darwin\"; and, Huxley, expecting that the promised\r\ndebate would be merely an appeal to prejudice in a mixed audience,\r\nbefore which the scientific arguments of the Bishop's opponents would be\r\nat the utmost disadvantage, intended to leave Oxford that very morning\r\nand join his wife at Hardwicke, near Reading, where she was staying with\r\nher sister. But in a letter, quoted below, he tells how, on the Friday\r\nafternoon, he chanced to meet Robert chambers, the reputed author of the\r\n\"Vestiges of Creation,\" who begged him \"not to desert them.\" Accordingly\r\nhe postponed his departure; but seeing his wife next morning, had no\r\noccasion to write a letter.\r\n\r\nSeveral accounts of the scene are already in existence: one in the \"Life\r\nof Darwin\" (volume 2 page 320), another in the 1892 \"Life,\" page 236\r\nsq.; a third that of \"Lyell\" (volume 2 page 335), the slight differences\r\nbetween them representing the difference between individual\r\nrecollections of eye-witnesses. In addition to these I have been\r\nfortunate enough to secure further reminiscences from several other\r\neye-witnesses.\r\n\r\nTwo papers in Section D, of no great importance in themselves, became\r\nhistorical as affording the opponents of Darwin their opportunity of\r\nmaking an attack upon his theory which should tell with the public. The\r\nfirst was on Thursday, June 28. Dr. Daubeny of Oxford made a\r\ncommunication to the Section, \"On the final causes of the sexuality of\r\nplants, with particular reference to Mr. Darwin's work on the \"Origin of\r\nSpecies.\" (My best thanks are due to Mr. F. Darwin for permission to\r\nquote his accounts of the meeting; other citations are from the\r\n\"Athenaeum\" reports of July 14, 1860.) Huxley was called upon to speak\r\nby the President, but tried to avoid a discussion, on the ground \"that a\r\ngeneral audience, in which sentiment would unduly interfere with\r\nintellect, was not the public before which such a discussion should be\r\ncarried on.\"\r\n\r\nThis consideration, however, did not stop the discussion; it was\r\ncontinued by Owen. He said he \"wished to approach the subject in the\r\nspirit of the philosopher,\" and declared his \"conviction that there were\r\nfacts by which the public could come to some conclusion with regard to\r\nthe probabilities of the truth of Mr. Darwin's theory.\" As one of these\r\nfacts, he stated that the brain of the gorilla \"presented more\r\ndifferences, as compared with the brain of man, than it did when\r\ncompared with the brains of the very lowest and most problematical of\r\nthe Quadrumana.\"\r\n\r\nNow this was the very point, as said above, upon which Huxley had made\r\nspecial investigations during the last two years, with precisely\r\nopposite results, such as, indeed, had been arrived at by previous\r\ninvestigators. Hereupon he replied, giving these assertions a \"direct\r\nand unqualified contradiction,\" and pledging himself to \"justify that\r\nunusual procedure elsewhere,\"--a pledge which was amply fulfilled in the\r\npages of the \"Natural History Review\" for 1861.\r\n\r\nAccordingly it was to him, thus marked out as the champion of the most\r\ndebatable theory of evolution, that, two days later, the Bishop\r\naddressed his sarcasms, only to meet with a withering retort. For on the\r\nFriday there was peace; but on the Saturday came a yet fiercer battle\r\nover the \"Origin,\" which loomed all the larger in the public eye,\r\nbecause it was not merely the contradiction of one anatomist by another,\r\nbut the open clash between Science and the Church. It was, moreover, not\r\na contest of bare fact or abstract assertion, but a combat of wit\r\nbetween two individuals, spiced with the personal element which appeals\r\nto one of the strongest instincts of every large audience.\r\n\r\nIt was the merest chance, as I have already said, that Huxley attended\r\nthe meeting of the section that morning. Dr. Draper of New York was to\r\nread a paper on the \"Intellectual Development of Europe considered with\r\nreference to the views of Mr. Darwin.\" \"I can still hear,\" writes one\r\nwho was present, \"the American accents of Dr. Draper's opening address\r\nwhen he asked 'Air we a fortuitous concourse of atoms?'\" However, it was\r\nnot to hear him, but the eloquence of the Bishop, that the members of\r\nthe Association crowded in such numbers into the Lecture Room of the\r\nMuseum, that this, the appointed meeting-place of the section, had to be\r\nabandoned for the long west room, since cut in two by a partition for\r\nthe purposes of the library. It was not term time, nor were the general\r\npublic admitted; nevertheless the room was crowded to suffocation long\r\nbefore the protagonists appeared on the scene, 700 persons or more\r\nmanaging to find places. The very windows by which the room was lighted\r\ndown the length of its west side were packed with ladies, whose white\r\nhandkerchiefs, waving and fluttering in the air at the end of the\r\nBishop's speech, were an unforgettable factor in the acclamation of the\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\nOn the east side between the two doors was the platform. Professor\r\nHenslow, the President of the section, took his seat in the centre; upon\r\nhis right was the Bishop, and beyond him again Dr. Draper; on his\r\nextreme left was Mr. Dingle, a clergyman from Lanchester, near Durham,\r\nwith Sir J. Hooker and Sir J. Lubbock in front of him, and nearer the\r\ncentre, Professor Beale of King's College, London, and Huxley.\r\n\r\nThe clergy, who shouted lustily for the Bishop, were massed in the\r\nmiddle of the room; behind them in the north-west corner a knot of\r\nundergraduates (one of these was T.H. Green, who listened but took no\r\npart in the cheering) had gathered together beside Professor Brodie,\r\nready to lift their voices, poor minority though they were, for the\r\nopposite party. Close to them stood one of the few men among the\r\naudience already in Holy orders, who joined in--and indeed led--the\r\ncheers for the Darwinians.\r\n\r\nSo \"Dr. Draper droned out his paper, turning first to the right hand and\r\nthen to the left, of course bringing in a reference to the Origin of\r\nSpecies which set the ball rolling.\"\r\n\r\nAn hour or more that paper lasted, and then discussion began. The\r\nPresident \"wisely announced in limine that none who had not valid\r\narguments to bring forward on one side or the other would be allowed to\r\naddress the meeting; a caution that proved necessary, for no fewer than\r\nfour combatants had their utterances burked by him, because of their\r\nindulgence in vague declamation.\" (\"Life of Darwin\" l.c.)\r\n\r\nFirst spoke (writes Professor Farrar (Canon of Durham.)) a layman from\r\nBrompton, who gave his name as being one of the Committee of the (newly\r\nformed) Economic section of the Association. He, in a stentorian voice,\r\nlet off his theological venom. Then jumped up Richard Greswell with a\r\nthin voice, saying much the same, but speaking as a scholar (The\r\nReverend Richard Greswell, B.D., Tutor of Worcester College.); but we\r\ndid not merely want any theological discussion, so we shouted them down.\r\nThen a Mr. Dingle got up and tried to show that Darwin would have done\r\nmuch better if he had taken him into consultation. He used the\r\nblackboard and began a mathematical demonstration on the question--\"Let\r\nthis point A be man, and let that point B be the mawnkey.\" He got no\r\nfurther; he was shouted down with cries of \"mawnkey.\" None of these had\r\nspoken more than three minutes. It was when these were shouted down that\r\nHenslow said he must demand that the discussion should rest on\r\nSCIENTIFIC grounds only.\r\n\r\nThen there were calls for the Bishop, but he rose and said he understood\r\nhis friend Professor Beale had something to say first. Beale, who was an\r\nexcellent histologist, spoke to the effect that the new theory ought to\r\nmeet with fair discussion, but added, with great modesty, that he\r\nhimself had not sufficient knowledge to discuss the subject adequately.\r\nThen the Bishop spoke the speech that you know, and the question about\r\nhis mother being an ape, or his grandmother.\r\n\r\nFrom the scientific point of view, the speech was of small value. It was\r\nevident from his mode of handling the subject that he had been \"crammed\r\nup to the throat,\" and knew nothing at first hand; he used no argument\r\nbeyond those to be found in his \"Quarterly\" article, which appeared a\r\nfew days later, and is now admitted to have been inspired by Owen. \"He\r\nridiculed Darwin badly and Huxley savagely; but,\" confesses one of his\r\nstrongest opponents, \"all in such dulcet tones, so persuasive a manner,\r\nand in such well turned periods, that I who had been inclined to blame\r\nthe President for allowing a discussion that could serve no scientific\r\npurpose, now forgave him from the bottom of my heart.\" (\"Life of Darwin\"\r\nl.c.)\r\n\r\nThe Bishop spoke thus \"for full half an hour with inimitable spirit,\r\nemptiness and unfairness.\" \"In a light, scoffing tone, florid and\r\nfluent, he assured us there was nothing in the idea of evolution;\r\nrock-pigeons were what rock-pigeons had always been. Then, turning to\r\nhis antagonist with a smiling insolence, he begged to know, was it\r\nthrough his grandfather or his grandmother that he claimed his descent\r\nfrom a monkey?\" (\"Reminiscences of a Grandmother,\" \"Macmillan's\r\nMagazine,\" October 1898. Professor Farrar thinks this version of what\r\nthe Bishop said is slightly inaccurate. His impression is that the words\r\nactually used seemed at the moment flippant and unscientific rather than\r\ninsolent, vulgar, or personal. The Bishop, he writes, \"had been talking\r\nof the perpetuity of species of Birds; and then, denying a fortiori the\r\nderivation of the species Man from Ape, he rhetorically invoked the aid\r\nof FEELING, and said, 'If any one were to be willing to trace his\r\ndescent through an ape as his GRANDFATHER, would he be willing to trace\r\nhis descent similarly on the side of his GRANDMOTHER?' His false humour\r\nwas an attempt to arouse the antipathy about degrading WOMAN to the\r\nquadrumana. Your father's reply showed there was vulgarity as well as\r\nfolly in the Bishop's words; and the impression distinctly was, that the\r\nBishop's party, as they left the room, felt abashed, and recognised the\r\nBishop had forgotten to behave like a perfect gentleman.\")\r\n\r\nThis was the fatal mistake of his speech. Huxley instantly grasped the\r\ntactical advantage which the descent to personalities gave him. He\r\nturned to Sir Benjamin Brodie, who was sitting beside him, and\r\nemphatically striking his hand upon his knee, exclaimed,] \"The Lord hath\r\ndelivered him into mine hands.\" [The bearing of the exclamation did not\r\ndawn upon Sir Benjamin until after Huxley had completed his \"forcible\r\nand eloquent\" answer to the scientific part of the Bishop's argument,\r\nand proceeded to make his famous retort. (The \"Athenaeum\" reports him as\r\nsaying that Darwin's theory was an explanation of phenomena in Natural\r\nHistory, as the undulatory theory was of the phenomena of light. No one\r\nobjected to that theory because an undulation of light had never been\r\narrested and measured. Darwin's theory was an explanation of facts, and\r\nhis book was full of new facts, all bearing on his theory. Without\r\nasserting that every part of that theory had been confirmed, he\r\nmaintained that it was the best explanation of the origin of species\r\nwhich had yet been offered. With regard to the psychological distinction\r\nbetween men and animals, man himself was once a monad--a mere atom, and\r\nnobody could say at what moment in the history of his development he\r\nbecame consciously intelligent. The question was not so much one of a\r\ntransmutation or transition of species, as of the production of forms\r\nwhich became permanent.\r\n\r\nThus the short-legged sheep of America was not produced gradually, but\r\noriginated in the birth of an original parent of the whole stock, which\r\nhad been kept up by a rigid system of artificial selection.)\r\n\r\nOn this (continues the writer in \"Macmillan's Magazine\") Mr. Huxley\r\nslowly and deliberately arose. A slight tall figure, stern and pale,\r\nvery quiet and very grave (\"Young, cool, quiet, scientific--scientific\r\nin fact and in treatment.\"--J.R. Green. A certain piquancy must have\r\nbeen added to the situation by the superficial resemblance in feature\r\nbetween the two men, so different in temperament and expression. Indeed\r\nnext day at Hardwicke, a friend came up to Mr. Fanning and asked who his\r\nguest was, saying, \"Surely it is the son of the Bishop of Oxford.\"), he\r\nstood before us and spoke those tremendous words--words which no one\r\nseems sure of now, nor, I think, could remember just after they were\r\nspoken, for their meaning took away our breath, though it left us in no\r\ndoubt as to what it was. He was not ashamed to have a monkey for his\r\nancestor; but he would be ashamed to be connected with a man who used\r\ngreat gifts to obscure the truth. No one doubted his meaning, and the\r\neffect was tremendous. One lady fainted and had to be carried out; I,\r\nfor one, jumped out of my seat.\r\n\r\nThe fullest and probably most accurate account of these concluding words\r\nis the following, from a letter of the late John Richard Green, then an\r\nundergraduate, to his friend, afterwards Professor Boyd Dawkins (The\r\nwriter in \"Macmillan's\" tells me: \"I cannot quite accept Mr. J.R.\r\nGreen's sentences as your father's; though I didn't doubt that they\r\nconvey the sense; but then I think that only a shorthand writer could\r\nreproduce Mr. Huxley's singularly beautiful style--so simple and so\r\nincisive. The sentence given is much too 'Green.'\")]\r\n\r\nI asserted--and I repeat--that a man has no reason to be ashamed of\r\nhaving an ape for his grandfather. If there were an ancestor whom I\r\nshould feel shame in recalling it would rather be a man--a man of\r\nrestless and versatile intellect--who, not content with an equivocal\r\nsuccess in his own sphere of activity, plunges into scientific questions\r\nwith which he has no real acquaintance, only to obscure them by an\r\naimless rhetoric, and distract the attention of his hearers from the\r\nreal point at issue by eloquent digressions and skilled appeals to\r\nreligious prejudice. (My father once told me that he did not remember\r\nusing the word \"equivocal\" in this speech. (See his letter below.) The\r\nlate Professor Victor Carus had the same impression, which is\r\ncorroborated by Professor Farrar.) (As the late Henry Fawcett wrote in\r\n\"Macmillan's Magazine,\" 1860:--\"The retort was so justly deserved, and\r\nso inimitable in its manner, that no one who was present can ever forget\r\nthe impression that it made.\")\r\n\r\nFurther, Mr. A.G. Vernon-Harcourt, F.R.S., Reader in Chemistry at the\r\nUniversity of Oxford, writes to me:--\r\n\r\nThe Bishop had rallied your father as to the descent from a monkey,\r\nasking as a sort of joke how recent this had been, whether it was his\r\ngrandfather or further back. Your father, in replying on this point,\r\nfirst explained that the suggestion was of descent through thousands of\r\ngenerations from a common ancestor, and then went on to this\r\neffect--\"But if this question is treated, not as a matter for the calm\r\ninvestigation of science, but as a matter of sentiment, and if I am\r\nasked whether I would choose to be descended from the poor animal of low\r\nintelligence and stooping gait, who grins and chatters as we pass, or\r\nfrom a man, endowed with great ability and a splendid position, who\r\nshould use these gifts\" (here, as the point became clear, there was a\r\ngreat outburst of applause, which mostly drowned the end of the\r\nsentence) \"to discredit and crush humble seekers after truth, I hesitate\r\nwhat answer to make.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt your father's words were better than these, and they gained\r\neffect from his clear, deliberate utterance, but in outline and in SCALE\r\nthis represents truly what was said.\r\n\r\nAfter the commotion was over, \"some voices called for Hooker, and his\r\nname having been handed up, the President invited him to give his view\r\nof the theory from the Botanical side. This he did, demonstrating that\r\nthe Bishop, by his own showing, had never grasped the principles of the\r\n'Origin,' and that he was absolutely ignorant of the elements of\r\nbotanical science. The Bishop made no reply, and the meeting broke up.\"\r\n(\"Life of Darwin,\" l.c.)\r\n\r\nACCOUNT OF THE OXFORD MEETING BY THE REVEREND W.H. FREEMANTLE (in\r\n\"Charles Darwin, his Life Told\" etc. 1892 page 238.)\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Oxford attacked Darwin, at first playfully, but at last in\r\ngrim earnest. It was known that the Bishop had written an article\r\nagainst Darwin in the last \"Quarterly Review\" (It appeared in the\r\nensuing number for July.); it was also rumoured that Professor Owen had\r\nbeen staying in Cuddesdon and had primed the Bishop, who was to act as\r\nmouthpiece to the great Paleontologist, who did not himself dare to\r\nenter the lists. The Bishop, however, did not show himself master of the\r\nfacts, and made one serious blunder. A fact which had been much dwelt on\r\nas confirmatory of Darwin's idea of variation, was that a sheep had been\r\nborn shortly before in a flock in the North of England, having an\r\naddition of one to the vertebrae of the spine. The Bishop was declaring\r\nwith rhetorical exaggeration that there was hardly any evidence on\r\nDarwin's side. \"What have they to bring forward?\" he exclaimed. \"Some\r\nrumoured statement about a long-legged sheep.\" But he passed on to\r\nbanter: \"I should like to ask Professor Huxley, who is sitting by me,\r\nand is about to tear me to pieces when I have sat down, as to his belief\r\nin being descended from an ape. Is it on his grandfather's or his\r\ngrandmother's side that the ape ancestry comes in?\" And then taking a\r\ngraver tone, he asserted, in a solemn peroration, that Darwin's views\r\nwere contrary to the revelation of God in the Scriptures. Professor\r\nHuxley was unwilling to respond: but he was called for, and spoke with\r\nhis usual incisiveness and with some scorn:] \"I am here only in the\r\ninterests of science,\" [he said,] \"and I have not heard anything which\r\ncan prejudice the case of my august client.\" [Then after showing how\r\nlittle competent the Bishop was to enter upon the discussion, he touched\r\non the question of Creation.] \"You say that development drives out the\r\nCreator; but you assert that God made you: and yet you know that you\r\nyourself were originally a little piece of matter, no bigger than the\r\nend of this gold pencil-case.\" [Lastly as to the descent from a monkey,\r\nhe said:] \"I should feel it no shame to have risen from such an origin;\r\nbut I should feel it a shame to have sprung from one who prostituted the\r\ngifts of culture and eloquence to the service of prejudice and of\r\nfalsehood.\"\r\n\r\n[Many others spoke. Mr. Gresley, an old Oxford don, pointed out that in\r\nhuman nature at least orderly development was not the necessary rule:\r\nHomer was the greatest of poets, but he lived 3000 years ago, and has\r\nnot produced his like.\r\n\r\nAdmiral FitzRoy was present, and said he had often expostulated with his\r\nold comrade of the \"Beagle\" for entertaining views which were\r\ncontradictory to the First Chapter of Genesis.\r\n\r\nSir John Lubbock declared that many of the arguments by which the\r\npermanence of species was supported came to nothing, and instanced some\r\nwheat which was said to have come off an Egyptian mummy, and was sent to\r\nhim to prove that wheat had not changed since the time of the Pharaohs;\r\nbut which proved to be made of French chocolate. Sir Joseph (then Dr.)\r\nHooker spoke shortly, saying that he had found the hypothesis of Natural\r\nSelection so helpful in explaining the phenomena of his own subject of\r\nBotany, that he had been constrained to accept it. After a few words\r\nfrom Darwin's old friend, Professor Henslow, who occupied the chair, the\r\nmeeting broke up, leaving the impression that those most capable of\r\nestimating the arguments of Darwin in detail saw their way to accept his\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nNote.--Sir John Lubbock also insisted on the embryological evidence for\r\nevolution. F.D.]\r\n\r\n[T.H. Huxley To Francis Darwin (ibid.).]\r\n\r\nJune 27, 1891.\r\n\r\nI should say that Freemantle's account is substantially correct, but\r\nthat Green has the substance of my speech more accurately. However, I am\r\ncertain I did not use the word, \"equivocal.\"\r\n\r\nThe odd part of the business is, that I should not have been present\r\nexcept for Robert Chambers. I had heard of the Bishop's intention to\r\nutilise the occasion. I knew he had the reputation of being a\r\nfirst-class controversialist, and I was quite aware that if he played\r\nhis cards properly, we should have little chance, with such an audience,\r\nof making an efficient defence. Moreover, I was very tired, and wanted\r\nto join my wife at her brother-in-law's country house near Reading, on\r\nthe Saturday. On the Friday I met Chambers in the street, and in reply\r\nto some remark of his, about his going to the meeting, I said that I did\r\nnot mean to attend it--did not see the good of giving up peace and\r\nquietness to be episcopally pounded. Chambers broke out into vehement\r\nremonstrances, and talked about my deserting them. So I said, \"Oh! if\r\nyou are going to take it that way, I'll come and have my share of what\r\nis going on.\"\r\n\r\nSo I came, and chanced to sit near old Sir Benjamin Brodie. The Bishop\r\nbegan his speech, and to my astonishment very soon showed that he was so\r\nignorant that he did not know how to manage his own case. My spirits\r\nrose proportionately, and when he turned to me with his insolent\r\nquestion, I said to Sir Benjamin, in an undertone, \"The Lord hath\r\ndelivered him into mine hands.\"\r\n\r\nThat sagacious old gentleman stared at me as if I had lost my senses.\r\nBut, in fact, the Bishop had justified the severest retort I could\r\ndevise, and I made up my mind to let him have it. I was careful,\r\nhowever, not to rise to reply, until the meeting called for me--then I\r\nlet myself go.\r\n\r\nIn justice to the Bishop, I am bound to say he bore no malice, but was\r\nalways courtesy itself when we occasionally met in after years. Hooker\r\nand I walked away from the meeting together, and I remember saying to\r\nhim that this experience had changed my opinion as to the practical\r\nvalue of the art of public speaking, and that from that time forth I\r\nshould carefully cultivate it, and try to leave off hating it. I did the\r\nformer, but never quite succeeded in the latter effort.\r\n\r\nI did not mean to trouble you with such a long scrawl when I began about\r\nthis piece of ancient history.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[In the evening there was a crowded conversazione in Dr. Daubney's\r\nrooms, and here, continues the writer in \"Macmillan's,\" \"everyone was\r\neager to congratulate the hero of the day. I remember that some naive\r\nperson wished 'it could come over again'; Mr. Huxley, with the look on\r\nhis face of the victor who feels the cost of victory, put us aside\r\nsaying,] 'Once in a lifetime is enough, if not too much.'\"\r\n\r\n[In a letter to me the same writer remarks--\r\n\r\nI gathered from Mr. Huxley's look when I spoke to him at Dr. Daubeny's\r\nthat he was not quite satisfied to have been forced to take so personal\r\na tone--it a little jarred upon his fine taste. But it was the Bishop\r\nwho first struck the insolent note of personal attack.\r\n\r\nAgain, with reference to the state of feeling at the meeting:--\r\n\r\nI never saw such a display of fierce party spirit, the looks of bitter\r\nhatred which the audience bestowed--(I mean the majority) on us who were\r\non your father's side--as we passed through the crowd we felt that we\r\nwere expected to say \"how abominably the Bishop was treated\"--or to be\r\nconsidered outcasts and detestable.\r\n\r\nIt was very different, however, at Dr. Daubeny's, \"where,\" says the\r\nwriter of the account in \"Darwin's Life,\" \"the almost sole topic was the\r\nbattle of the 'Origin,' and I was much struck with the fair and\r\nunprejudiced way in which the black coats and white cravats of Oxford\r\ndiscussed the question, and the frankness with which they offered their\r\ncongratulations to the winners in the combat.\"\r\n\r\nThe result of this encounter, though a check to the other side, cannot,\r\nof course, be represented as an immediate and complete triumph for\r\nevolutionary doctrine. This was precluded by the character and temper of\r\nthe audience, most of whom were less capable of being convinced by the\r\narguments than shocked by the boldness of the retort, although, being\r\ngentlefolk, as Professor Farrar remarks, they were disposed to admit on\r\nreflection that the Bishop had erred on the score of taste and good\r\nmanners. Nevertheless, it was a noticeable feature of the occasion, Sir\r\nM. Foster tells me, that when Huxley rose he was received coldly, just a\r\ncheer of encouragement from his friends, the audience as a whole not\r\njoining in it. But as he made his points the applause grew and widened,\r\nuntil, when he sat down, the cheering was not very much less than that\r\ngiven to the Bishop. To that extent he carried an unwilling audience\r\nwith him by the force of his speech. The debate on the ape question,\r\nhowever, was continued elsewhere during the next two years, and the\r\nevidence was completed by the unanswerable demonstrations of Sir W.H.\r\nFlower at the Cambridge meeting of the Association in 1862.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the Oxford meeting lay in the open resistance that was\r\nmade to authority, at a moment when even a drawn battle was hardly less\r\neffectual than acknowledged victory. Instead of being crushed under\r\nridicule, the new theories secured a hearing, all the wider, indeed, for\r\nthe startling nature of their defence.]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.15.\r\n\r\n1860-1863.\r\n\r\n[In the autumn he set to work to make good his promise of demonstrating\r\nthe existence in the simian brain of the structures alleged to be\r\nexclusively human. The result was seen in his papers \"On the Zoological\r\nRelations of Man with the Lower Animals\" (\"Natural History Review\" 1861\r\npages 67-68); \"On the Brain of Ateles Paniscus,\" which appeared in the\r\n\"Proceedings of the Zoological Society\" for 1861, and on \"Nyctipithecus\"\r\nin 1862, while similar work was undertaken by his friends Rolleston and\r\nFlower. But the brain was only one point among many, as, for example,\r\nthe hand and the foot in man and the apes; and he already had in mind\r\nthe discussion of the whole question comprehensively. On January 6 he\r\nwrites to Sir J. Hooker:--]\r\n\r\nSome of these days I shall look up the ape question again and go over\r\nthe rest of the organisation in the same way. But in order to get a\r\nthorough grip of the question I must examine into a good many points for\r\nmyself. The results, when they do come out, will, I foresee, astonish\r\nthe natives.\r\n\r\n[Full of interest in this theme, he made it the subject of his popular\r\nlectures in the spring of 1861.\r\n\r\nThus from February to May he lectured weekly to working men on \"The\r\nRelation of Man to the rest of the Animal Kingdom,\" and on March 22\r\nwrites to his wife:--]\r\n\r\nMy working men stick by me wonderfully, the house being fuller than ever\r\nlast night. By next Friday evening they will all be convinced that they\r\nare monkeys...Said lecture, let me inform you, was very good. Lyell came\r\nand was rather astonished at the magnitude and attentiveness of the\r\naudience.\r\n\r\n[These lectures to working men were published in the \"Natural History\r\nReview,\" as was a Friday evening discourse at the Royal Institution\r\n(February 8) on \"The Nature of the Earliest Stages of Development of\r\nAnimals.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the publication of these researches led to another pitched\r\nbattle, in which public interest was profoundly engaged. The controversy\r\nwhich raged had some resemblance to a duel over a point of honour and\r\ncredit. Scientific technicalities became the catchwords of society, and\r\nthe echoes of the great Hippocampus question linger in the delightful\r\npages of the \"Water-Babies.\" Of this fight Huxley writes to Sir J.\r\nHooker on April 18, 1861:--]\r\n\r\nA controversy between Owen and myself, which I can only call absurd (as\r\nthere is no doubt whatever about the facts), has been going on in the\r\n\"Athenaeum,\" and I wound it up in disgust last week.\r\n\r\n[And again on April 27:--]\r\n\r\nOwen occupied an entirely untenable position--but I am nevertheless\r\nsurprised he did not try \"abusing plaintiff's attorney.\" The fact is he\r\nmade a prodigious blunder in commencing the attack, and now his only\r\nchance is to be silent and let people forget the exposure. I do not\r\nbelieve that in the whole history of science there is a case of any man\r\nof reputation getting himself into such a contemptible position. He will\r\nbe the laughing-stock of all the continental anatomists.\r\n\r\nRolleston has a great deal of Oxford slough to shed, but on that very\r\nground his testimony has been of most especial service. Fancy that man\r\n-- telling Maskelyne that Rolleston's observations were entirely\r\nconfirmatory of Owen.\r\n\r\n[About the same time he writes to his wife:--]\r\n\r\nApril 16.\r\n\r\nPeople are talking a good deal about the \"Man and the Apes\" question,\r\nand I hear that somebody, I suspect Monckton-Milnes, has set afloat a\r\npoetical squib on the subject...\r\n\r\n[The squib in question, dated \"the Zoological Gardens,\" and signed\r\n\"Gorilla,\" appeared in \"Punch\" for May 15, 1861, under a picture of that\r\nanimal, bearing the sign, \"Am I a Man and a Brother?\"\r\n\r\nThe concluding verses run as follows:\r\n\r\n  Next HUXLEY replies\r\n  That OWEN he lies\r\n  And garbles his Latin quotation;\r\n  That his facts are not new,\r\n  His mistakes not a few,\r\n  Detrimental to his reputation.\r\n\r\n  \"To twice slay the slain\"\r\n  By dint of the Brain\r\n  (Thus Huxley concludes his review),\r\n  Is but labour in vain,\r\n  Unproductive of gain,\r\n  And so I shall bid you \"Adieu!\"]\r\n\r\nSome think my winding-up too strong, but I trust the day will never come\r\nwhen I shall abstain from expressing my contempt for those who\r\nprostitute Science to the Service of Error. At any rate I am not old\r\nenough for that yet. Darwin came in just now. I get no scoldings for\r\npitching into the common enemy now!!\r\n\r\nI would give you fifty guesses [he writes to Hooker on April 30], and\r\nyou should not find out the author of the \"Punch\" poem. I saw it in MS.\r\nthree weeks ago, and was told the author was a friend of mine. But I\r\nremained hopelessly in the dark till yesterday. What do you say to Sir\r\nPhilip Egerton coming out in that line? I am told he is the author, and\r\nthe fact speaks volumes for Owen's perfect success in damning himself.\r\n\r\n[In the midst of the fight came a surprising invitation. On April 10 he\r\nwrites to his wife:--]\r\n\r\nThey have written to me from the Philosophical Institute of Edinburgh to\r\nask me to give two lectures on the \"Relation of Man to the Lower\r\nAnimals\" next session. I have replied that if they can give me January 3\r\nand 7 for lecture days I will do it--if not, not. Fancy unco guid\r\nEdinburgh requiring illumination on the subject! They know my views, so\r\nif they did not like what I have to tell them, it is their own fault.\r\n\r\n[These lectures were eventually delivered on January 4 and 7, 1862, and\r\nwere well reported in the Edinburgh papers. The substance of them\r\nappears as Part 2 in \"Man's Place in Nature,\" the first lecture\r\ndescribing the general nature of the process of development among\r\nvertebrate animals, and the modifications of the skeleton in the\r\nmammalia; the second dealing with the crucial points of comparison\r\nbetween the higher apes and man, namely the hand, foot, and brain. He\r\nshowed that the differences between man and the higher apes were no\r\ngreater than those between the higher and lower apes. If the Darwinian\r\nhypothesis explained the common ancestry of the latter, the anatomist\r\nwould have no difficulty with the origin of man, so far as regards the\r\ngap between him and the higher apes.\r\n\r\nYet, though convinced that] \"that hypothesis is as near an approximation\r\nto the truth as, for example, the Copernican hypothesis was to the true\r\ntheory of the planetary motions,\" [he steadfastly refused to be an\r\nadvocate of the theory,] \"if by an advocate is meant one whose business\r\nit is to smooth over real difficulties, and to persuade when he cannot\r\nconvince.\"\r\n\r\n[In common fairness he warned his audience of the one missing link in\r\nthe chain of evidence--the fact that selective breeding has not yet\r\nproduced species sterile to one another. But it is to be adopted as a\r\nworking hypothesis like other scientific generalisations,] \"subject to\r\nthe production of proof that physiological species may be produced by\r\nselective breeding; just as a physical philosopher may accept the\r\nundulatory theory of light, subject to the proof of the existence of the\r\nhypothetical ether; or as the chemist adopts the atomic theory, subject\r\nto the proof of the existence of atoms; and for exactly the same\r\nreasons, namely, that it has an immense amount of prima facie\r\nprobability; that it is the only means at present within reach of\r\nreducing the chaos of observed facts to order; and lastly, that it is\r\nthe most powerful instrument of investigation which has been presented\r\nto naturalists since the invention of the natural system of\r\nclassification, and the commencement of the systematic study of\r\nembryology.\"\r\n\r\n[As for the repugnance of most men to admitting kinship with the apes,]\r\n\"thoughtful men,\" [he says,] once escaped from the blinding influences\r\nof traditional prejudices, will find in the lowly stock whence man has\r\nsprung the best evidence of the splendour of his capacities; and will\r\ndiscern, in his long progress through the past, a reasonable ground of\r\nfaith in his attainment of a nobler future.\"\r\n\r\n[A simile, with which he enforced this elevating point of view, which\r\nhas since eased the passage of many minds to the acceptance of\r\nevolution, seems to have been much appreciated by his audience. It was a\r\ncomparison of man to the Alps, which turn out to be] \"of one substance\r\nwith the dullest clay, but raised by inward forces to that place of\r\nproud and seemingly inaccessible glory.\"\r\n\r\n[The lectures were met at first with astonishing quiet, but it was not\r\nlong before the stones began to fly. The \"Witness\" of January 11 lashed\r\nitself into a fury over the fact that the audience applauded this\r\n\"anti-scriptural and most debasing theory...standing in blasphemous\r\ncontradiction to biblical narrative and doctrine,\" instead of expressing\r\ntheir resentment at this \"foul outrage committed upon them individually,\r\nand upon the whole species as 'made in the likeness of God,'\" by\r\ndeserting the hall in a body, or using some more emphatic form of\r\nprotest against the corruption of youth by \"the vilest and beastliest\r\nparadox ever vented in ancient or modern times amongst Pagans or\r\nChristians.\" In his finest vein of sarcasm, the writer expresses his\r\nsurprise that the meeting did not instantly resolve itself into a\r\n\"Gorilla Emancipation Society,\" or propose to hear a lecture from an\r\napostle of Mormonism; \"even this would be a less offensive, mischievous,\r\nand inexcusable exhibition than was made in the recent two lectures by\r\nProfessor Huxley,\" etc.]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, January 13, 1862.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nIn the first place a new year's greeting to you and yours. In the next,\r\nI enclose this slip (please return it when you have read it) to show you\r\nwhat I have been doing in the north.\r\n\r\nEverybody prophesied I should be stoned and cast out of the city gate,\r\nbut, on the contrary, I met with unmitigated applause!! Three cheers for\r\nthe progress of liberal opinion!!\r\n\r\nThe report is as good as any, but they have not put quite rightly what I\r\nsaid about your views, respecting which I took my old line about the\r\ninfertility difficulty.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, they have not reported my statement that whether you were\r\nright or wrong, some form of the progressive development theory is\r\ncertainly true. Nor have they reported here my distinct statement that I\r\nbelieve man and the apes to have come from one stock.\r\n\r\nHaving got thus far, I find the lecture better reported in the\r\n\"Courant,\" so I send you that instead.\r\n\r\nI mean to publish the lecture in full by and by (about the time the\r\norchids come out).\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nI deserved the greatest credit for not having made an onslaught on\r\nBrewster for his foolish impertinence about your views in \"Good Words,\"\r\nbut declined to stir nationality, which you know (in him) is rather more\r\nthan his Bible.\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, January 16, 1862.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI wonder if we are ever to meet again in this world! At any rate I send\r\nto the remote province of Kew, Greeting, and my best wishes for the new\r\nyear to you and yours. I also inclose a slip from an Edinburgh paper\r\ncontaining a report of my lecture on the \"Relation of Man,\" etc. As you\r\nwill see, I went in for the entire animal more strongly, in fact, than\r\nthey have reported me. I told them in so many words that I entertained\r\nno doubt of the origin of man from the same stock as the apes.\r\n\r\nAnd to my great delight, in saintly Edinburgh itself the announcement\r\nmet with nothing but applause. For myself I can't say that the praise or\r\nblame of my audience was much matter, but it is a grand indication of\r\nthe general disintegration of old prejudices which is going on.\r\n\r\nI shall see if I cannot make something more of the lectures by\r\ndelivering them again in London, and then I shall publish them.\r\n\r\nThe report does not put nearly strongly enough what I said in favour of\r\nDarwin's views. I affirmed it to be the only scientific hypothesis of\r\nthe origin of species in existence, and expressed my belief that one gap\r\nin the evidence would be filled up, as I always do.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, January 20, 1862.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nThe inclosed article, which has been followed up by another more\r\nviolent, more scurrilously personal, and more foolish, will prove to you\r\nthat my labour has not been in vain, and that your views and mine are\r\nlikely to be better ventilated in Scotland than they have been.\r\n\r\nI was quite uneasy at getting no attack from the \"Witness,\" thinking I\r\nmust have overestimated the impression that I had made, and the\r\nfavourableness of the reception of what I said. But the raving of the\r\n\"Witness\" is clear testimony that my notion was correct.\r\n\r\nI shall send a short reply to the \"Scotsman\" for the purpose of further\r\nadvertising the question.\r\n\r\nWith regard to what are especially your doctrines, I spoke much more\r\nfavourably than I am reported to have done. I expressed no doubt as to\r\ntheir ultimate establishment, but as I particularly wished not to be\r\nmisrepresented as an advocate trying to soften or explain away real\r\ndifficulties, I did not in speaking enter into the details of what is to\r\nbe said in diminishing the weight of the hybrid difficulty. All this\r\nwill be put fully when I print the Lecture.\r\n\r\nThe arguments put in your letter are those which I have urged to other\r\npeople--of the opposite side--over and over again. I have told my\r\nstudents that I entertain no doubt that twenty years' experiments on\r\npigeons conducted by a skilled physiologist, instead of by a mere\r\nbreeder, would give us physiological species sterile inter se, from a\r\ncommon stock (and in this, if I mistake not, I go further than you do\r\nyourself), and I have told them that when these experiments have been\r\nperformed I shall consider your views to have a complete physical basis,\r\nand to stand on as firm ground as any physiological theory whatever.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for me, in the time I had, to lay all this down to my\r\nEdinburgh audience, and in default of full explanation it was far better\r\nto seem to do scanty justice to you. I am constitutionally slow of\r\nadopting any theory that I must needs stick by when I have gone in for\r\nit; but for these two years I have been gravitating towards your\r\ndoctrines, and since the publication of your primula paper with\r\naccelerated velocity. By about this time next year I expect to have shot\r\npast you, and to find you pitching into me for being more Darwinian than\r\nyourself. However, you have set me going, and must just take the\r\nconsequences, for I warn you I will stop at no point so long as clear\r\nreasoning will carry me further.\r\n\r\nMy wife and I were very grieved to hear you had had such a sick house,\r\nbut I hope the change in the weather has done you all good. Anything is\r\nbetter than the damp warmth we had.\r\n\r\nI will take great care of the three \"Barriers.\" [A pamphlet called \"The\r\nThree Barriers\" by G.R., being notes on Mr. Darwin's \"Origin of Species\"\r\n1861, 8vo.\" Habitat, structure, and procreative power are given as these\r\nthree barriers to Darwinism, against which natural theology takes its\r\nstand on Final Causes.] I wanted to cut it up in the \"Saturday,\" but how\r\nI am to fulfil my benevolent intentions--with five lectures a week--a\r\nlecture at the Royal Institution and heaps of other things on my hands,\r\nI don't know.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nI am very glad to hear about Brown Sequard; he is a thoroughly good man,\r\nand told me it was worth while to come all the way to Oxford to hear the\r\nBishop pummelled.\r\n\r\n[In the above-mentioned letter to the \"Scotsman\" of January 24 he\r\nexpresses his unfeigned satisfaction at the fulfilment of the three\r\nobjects of his address, namely, to state fully and fairly his\r\nconclusions, to avoid giving unnecessary offence, and thirdly,] \"while\r\nfeeling assured of the just and reasonable dealing of the respectable\r\npart of the Scottish press, I naturally hoped for noisy injustice and\r\nunreason from the rest, seeing, as I did, the best security for the\r\ndissemination of my views through regions which they might not otherwise\r\nreach, in the certainty of a violent attack by [the 'Witness'.\"\r\n\r\nThe applause of the audience, he says, afforded him genuine\r\nsatisfaction,] \"because it bids me continue in the faith on which I\r\nacted, that a man who speaks out honestly and fearlessly that which he\r\nknows, and that which he believes, will always enlist the good-will and\r\nthe respect, however much he may fail in winning the assent, of his\r\nfellow-men.\"\r\n\r\n[About this time a new field of interest was opened out to him, closely\r\nconnected with, indeed, and completing, the ape question. Sir Charles\r\nLyell was engaged in writing his \"Antiquity of Man,\" and asked Huxley to\r\nsupply him with various anatomical data touching the ape question, and\r\nlater to draw him a diagram illustrating the peculiarities of the newly\r\ndiscovered Neanderthal skull as compared with other skulls. He points\r\nout in his letters to Lyell that the range of cranial capacity between\r\nthe highest and the lowest German--\"one of the mediatised princes, I\r\nsuppose\" [The minor princes of Germany, whose territories were annexed\r\nto larger states, and who thus exchanged a direct for a mediate share in\r\nthe imperial government.--or the Himalayan or Peruvian, is almost 100\r\nper cent; in absolute amount twice as much as the difference between\r\nthat of the largest simian and the smallest human capacity, so that in\r\nseeking an ordinal difference between man and the apes, \"it would\r\ncertainly be well to let go the head, though I am afraid it does not\r\nmend matters much to lay hold of the foot.\"\r\n\r\nAnd on January 25, 1862:--]\r\n\r\nI have been skull-measuring all day at the College of Surgeons. The\r\nNEANDERTHAL SKULL may be described as a slightly exaggerated\r\nmodification of one of the two types (and the lower) of Australian\r\nskulls.\r\n\r\nAfter the fashion of accounting for the elephant of old, I suppose it\r\nwill be said that it was imported. But luckily the differences, though\r\nonly of degree, are rather too marked for this hypothesis.\r\n\r\nI only wish I had a clear six months to work at the subject. Little did\r\nI dream what the undertaking to arrange your three woodcuts would lead\r\nto. It will come in the long-run, I believe, to a new ethnological\r\nmethod, new modes of measurement, a new datum line, and new methods of\r\nregistration.\r\n\r\nIf one had but two heads and neither required sleep!\r\n\r\n[One immediate result of his investigations, which appeared in a lecture\r\nat the Royal Institution (February 7, 1862), \"On the Fossil Remains of\r\nMan,\" was incorporated in \"Man's Place in Nature.\" But a more important\r\nconsequence of this impulse was that he went seriously into the study of\r\nEthnology. Of his work in this branch of natural science, Professor\r\nVirchow, speaking at the dinner given him by the English medical\r\nprofession on October 5, 1898, declared that in the eyes of German\r\nsavants it alone would suffice to secure immortal reverence for his\r\nname.\r\n\r\nThe concluding stage in the long controversy raised first at Oxford, was\r\nthe British Association meeting at Cambridge in 1862. It was here that\r\nProfessor (afterwards Sir W.H.) Flower made his public demonstration of\r\nthe existence in apes of the cerebral characters said to be peculiar to\r\nman.\r\n\r\nFrom the 1st to the 9th of October Huxley stayed at Cambridge as the\r\nguest of Professor Fawcett at Trinity Hall, running over to Felixstow on\r\nthe 5th to see his wife, whose health did not allow her to accompany\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAs President of Section D he had a good deal to do, and he describes the\r\ncourse of events in a letter to Darwin:--]\r\n\r\n26 Abbey Place, October 9, 1862.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nIt is a source of sincere pleasure to me to learn that anything I can\r\nsay or do is a pleasure to you, and I was therefore very glad to get\r\nyour letter at that whirligig of an association meeting the other day.\r\nWe all missed you, but I think it was as well you did not come, for\r\nthough I am pretty tough, as you know, I found the pace rather killing.\r\nNothing could exceed the hospitality and kindness of the University\r\npeople--and that, together with a great deal of speaking on the top of a\r\nvery bad cold, which I contrived to catch just before going down, has\r\nsomewhat used me up.\r\n\r\nOwen came down with the obvious intention of attacking me on all points.\r\nEach of his papers was an attack, and he went so far as to offer stupid\r\nand unnecessary opposition to proposals of mine in my own committee.\r\nHowever, he got himself sold at all points...The Polypterus paper and\r\nthe Aye-Aye paper fell flat. The latter was meant to raise a discussion\r\non your views, but it was all a stale hash, and I only made some half\r\nsarcastic remarks which stopped any further attempts at discussion...\r\n\r\nI took my book to Scotland but did nothing. I shall ask leave to send\r\nyou a bit or two as I get on.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nA \"Society for the propagation of common honesty in all parts of the\r\nworld\" was established at Cambridge. I want you to belong to it, but I\r\nwill say more about it by and by.\r\n\r\n[This admirable society, which was also to \"search for scientific truth,\r\nespecially in biology,\" seems to have been but short lived. At all\r\nevents, I can find only two references to subsequent meetings, on\r\nOctober 7 and December 19 in this year.\r\n\r\nA few days later a final blow was struck in the battle over the ape\r\nquestion. He writes on October 15 how he has written a letter to the\r\n\"Medical Times\"--his last word on the subject, summing up in most\r\nemphatic terms:--]\r\n\r\nI have written the letter with the greatest care, and there is nothing\r\ncoarse or violent in it. But it shall put an end to all the humbug that\r\nhas been going on...Rolleston will come out with his letter in the same\r\nnumber, and the smash will be awful, but most thoroughly merited.\r\n\r\n[These several pieces of work, struck out at different times in response\r\nto various impulses, were now combined and re-shaped into \"Man's Place\r\nin Nature,\" the first book which was published by him. Thus he writes to\r\nSir Charles Lyell on May 5, 1862:--]\r\n\r\nOf course I shall be delighted to discuss anything with you [Referring\r\nto the address on \"Geological Contemporaneity\" delivered in 1862 at the\r\nGeological Society.], and the more so as I mean to put the whole\r\nquestion before the world in another shape in my little book, whose\r\ntitle is announced as \"Evidences as to Man's Place in Nature.\" I have\r\nwritten the first two essays, the second containing the substance of my\r\nEdinburgh Lecture. I recollect you once asked me for something to quote\r\non the Man question, so if you want anything in that way the MS. is at\r\nyour service.\r\n\r\n[Lyell looked over the proofs, and the following letters are in reply to\r\nhis criticisms:--]\r\n\r\nArdrishaig, Loch Fyne, August 17, 1862.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir Charles,\r\n\r\nI take advantage of my first quiet day to reply to your letter of the\r\n9th; and in the first place let me thank you very much for your critical\r\nremarks, as I shall find them of great service.\r\n\r\nWith regard to such matters as verbal mistakes, you must recollect that\r\nthe greater part of the proof was wholly uncorrected. But the reader\r\nmight certainly do his work better. I do not think you will find room to\r\ncomplain of any want of distinctness in my definition of Owen's position\r\ntouching the Hippocampus question. I mean to give the whole history of\r\nthe business in a note, so that the paraphrase of Sir Philip Egerton's\r\nline \"To which Huxley replies that Owen he lies,\" shall be unmistakable.\r\n\r\nI will take care about the Cheiroptera, and I will look at Lamarck\r\nagain. But I doubt if I shall improve my estimate of the latter. The\r\nnotion of common descent was not his--still less that of modification by\r\nvariation--and he was as far as De Maillet from seeing his way to any\r\nvera causa by which varieties might be intensified into species.\r\n\r\nIf Darwin is right about natural selection--the discovery of this vera\r\ncausa sets him to my mind in a different region altogether from all his\r\npredecessors--and I should no more call his doctrine a modification of\r\nLamarck's than I should call the Newtonian theory of the celestial\r\nmotions a modification of the Ptolemaic system. Ptolemy imagined a mode\r\nof explaining those motions. Newton proved their necessity from the laws\r\nand a force demonstrably in operation. If he is only right Darwin will,\r\nI think, take his place with such men as Harvey, and even if he is wrong\r\nhis sobriety and accuracy of thought will put him on a far different\r\nlevel from Lamarck. I want to make this clear to people.\r\n\r\nI am disposed to agree with you about the \"emasculate\" and\r\n\"uncircumcised\"-partly for your reasons, partly because I believe it is\r\nan excellent rule always to erase anything that strikes one as\r\nparticularly smart when writing it. But it is a great piece of\r\nself-denial to abstain from expressing my peculiar antipathy to the\r\npeople indicated, and I hope I shall be rewarded for the virtue.\r\n\r\nAs to the secondary causes I only wished to guard myself from being\r\nunderstood to imply that I had any comprehension of the meaning of the\r\nterm. If my phrase looks naughty I will alter it. What I want is to be\r\nread, and therefore to give no unnecessary handle to the enemy. There\r\nwill be row enough whatever I do.\r\n\r\nOur Commission here [The Fishery Commission] implicates us in an inquiry\r\nof some difficulty, and which involves the interests of a great many\r\npoor people. I am afraid it will not leave me very much leisure. But we\r\nare in the midst of a charming country, and the work is not unpleasant\r\nor uninteresting. If the sun would only shine more than once a week it\r\nwould be perfect.\r\n\r\nWith kind remembrances to Lady Lyell, believe me, faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nWe shall be here for the next ten days at least. But my wife will always\r\nknow my whereabouts.\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, March 23, 1863.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir Charles,\r\n\r\nI suspect that the passage to which you refer must have been taken from\r\nmy unrevised proofs, for it corresponds very nearly with what is written\r\nat page 97 of my book.\r\n\r\nFlower has recently discovered that the Siamang's brain affords an even\r\nmore curious exception to the general rule than that of Mycetes, as the\r\ncerebral hemispheres leave part not only of the sides but of the hinder\r\nend of the cerebellum uncovered.\r\n\r\nAs it is one of the Anthropoid apes and yet differs in this respect far\r\nmore widely from the gorilla than the gorilla differs from man, it\r\noffers a charming example of the value of cerebral characters.\r\n\r\nFlower publishes a paper on the subject in the forthcoming number of the\r\n\"N. H. Review.\"\r\n\r\nMight it not be well to allude to the fact that the existence of the\r\nposterior lobe, posterior cornu, and hippocampus in the Orang has been\r\npublicly demonstrated to an audience of experts at the College of\r\nSurgeons?\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The success of \"Man's Place\" was immediate, despite such criticisms as\r\nthat of the \"Athenaeum\" that \"Lyell's object is to make man old,\r\nHuxley's to degrade him.\" By the middle of February it reached its\r\nsecond thousand; in July it is heard of as republished in America; at\r\nthe same time L. Buchner writes that he wished to translate it into\r\nGerman, but finds himself forestalled by Victor Carus. From another\r\naspect, Lord Enniskillen, thanking him for the book, says (March 3), \"I\r\nbelieve you are already excommunicated by book, bell, and candle,\" while\r\nin an undated note, Bollaert writes, \"The Bishop of Oxford the other day\r\nspoke about 'the church having been in danger of late, by such books as\r\nColenso's, but that it (the church) was now restored.' And this at a\r\ntime, he might have added, when the works of Darwin, Lyell, and Huxley\r\nare torn from the hands of Mudie's shopmen, as if they were novels--(see\r\n\"Daily Telegraph,\" April 10).\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the impression left by his work upon the minds of the\r\nleading men of science may be judged from a few words of Sir Charles\r\nLyell, who writes to a friend on March 15, 1863 (\"Life and Letters\" 2\r\n366):--\r\n\r\nHuxley's second thousand is going off well. If he had leisure like you\r\nand me, and the vigour and logic of the lectures, and his address to the\r\nGeological Society, and half a dozen other recent works (letters to the\r\n\"Times\" on Darwin, etc.), had been all in one book, what a position he\r\nwould occupy! I entreated him not to undertake the \"Natural History\r\nReview\" before it began. The responsibility all falls on the man of\r\nchief energy and talent; it is a quarterly mischief, and will end in\r\nknocking him up.\r\n\r\nA similar estimate appears from an earlier letter of March 11, 1859\r\n(\"Life and Letters\" 2 321), when he quotes Huxley's opinion of Mansel's\r\nBampton Lectures on the \"Limits of Religious Thought\":--\r\n\r\nA friend of mine, Huxley, who will soon take rank as one of the first\r\nnaturalists we have ever produced, begged me to read these sermons as\r\nfirst rate,] \"although, regarding the author as a churchman, you will\r\nprobably compare him, as I did, to the drunken fellow in Hogarth's\r\ncontested election, who is sawing through the signpost at the other\r\nparty's public-house, forgetting he is sitting at the other end of it.\r\nBut read them as a piece of clear and unanswerable reasoning.\"\r\n\r\n[In the 1894 preface to the re-issue of \"Man's Place\" in the Collected\r\nEssays, Huxley speaks as follows of the warnings he received against\r\npublishing on so dangerous a topic, of the storm which broke upon his\r\nhead, and the small result which, in the long run, it produced (In\r\nSeptember 1887 he wrote to Mr. Edward Clodd--]\"All the propositions laid\r\ndown in the wicked book, which was so well anathematised a quarter of a\r\ncentury ago, are now taught in the text-books. What a droll world it\r\nis!\"):--\r\n\r\nMagna est veritas et praevalebit! Truth is great, certainly, but\r\nconsidering her greatness, it is curious what a long time she is apt to\r\ntake about prevailing. When, towards the end of 1862, I had finished\r\nwriting \"Man's Place in Nature,\" I could say with a good conscience that\r\nmy conclusions \"had not been formed hastily or enunciated crudely.\" I\r\nthought I had earned the right to publish them, and even fancied I might\r\nbe thanked rather than reproved for doing so. However, in my anxiety to\r\npublish nothing erroneous, I asked a highly competent anatomist and very\r\ngood friend of mine to look through my proofs, and, if he could, point\r\nout any errors of fact. I was well pleased when he returned them without\r\ncriticism on that score; but my satisfaction was speedily dashed by the\r\nvery earnest warning as to the consequences of publication, which my\r\nfriend's interest in my welfare led him to give. But, as I have\r\nconfessed elsewhere, when I was a young man, there was just a little--a\r\nmere soupcon--in my composition of that tenacity of purpose which has\r\nanother name; and I felt sure that all the evil things prophesied would\r\nnot be so painful to me as the giving up that which I had resolved to\r\ndo, upon grounds which I conceived to be right. [(As to this advice not\r\nto publish \"Man's Place\" for fear of misrepresentation on the score of\r\nmorals, he said, in criticising an attack of this sort made upon Darwin\r\nin the \"Quarterly\" for July 1876:--] \"It seemed to me, however, that a\r\nman of science has no raison d'etre at all, unless he is willing to face\r\nmuch greater risks than these for the sake of that which he believes to\r\nbe true; and further, that to a man of science such risks do not count\r\nfor much--that they are by no means so serious as they are to a man of\r\nletters, for example.\") So the book came out; and I must do my friend\r\nthe justice to say that his forecast was completely justified. The\r\nBoreas of criticism blew his hardest blasts of misrepresentation and\r\nridicule for some years, and I was even as one of the wicked. Indeed, it\r\nsurprises me at times to think how anyone who had sunk so low could\r\nsince have emerged into, at any rate, relative respectability.\r\nPersonally, like the non-corvine personages in the Ingoldsby legend, I\r\ndid not feel \"one penny the worse.\" Translated into several languages,\r\nthe book reached a wider public than I had ever hoped for; being largely\r\nhelped, I imagine, by the Ernulphine advertisements to which I referred.\r\nIt has had the honour of being freely utilised without acknowledgment by\r\nwriters of repute; and finally it achieved the fate, which is the\r\neuthanasia of a scientific work, of being inclosed among the rubble of\r\nthe foundations of later knowledge, and forgotten.\r\n\r\nTo my observation, human nature has not sensibly changed during the last\r\nthirty years. I doubt not that there are truths as plainly obvious and\r\nas generally denied as those contained in \"Man's Place in Nature,\" now\r\nawaiting enunciation. If there is a young man of the present generation\r\nwho has taken as much trouble as I did to assure himself that they are\r\ntruths, let him come out with them, without troubling his head about the\r\nbarking of the dogs of St. Ernulphus. Veritas praevalebit--some day; and\r\neven if she does not prevail in his time, he himself will be all the\r\nbetter and wiser for having tried to help her. And let him recollect\r\nthat such great reward is full payment for all his labour and pains.\r\n\r\n[The following letter refers to the newly published \"Man's Place in\r\nNature.\" Miss H. Darwin had suggested a couple of corrections:--]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, February 25, 1863.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nPlease to say to Miss Henrietta Minos Rhadamanthus Darwin that I plead\r\nguilty to the justice of both criticisms, and throw myself on the mercy\r\nof the court.\r\n\r\nAs extenuating circumstances with respect to indictment Number 1, see\r\nprefatory notice. Extenuating circumstance Number 2--that I picked up\r\n\"Atavism\" in Pritchard years ago, and as it is a much more convenient\r\nword than \"Hereditary transmission of variations,\" it slipped into\r\nequivalence in my mind, and I forgot all about the original limitation.\r\n\r\nBut if these excuses should in your judgment tend to aggravate my\r\noffences, suppress 'em like a friend. One may always hope more from a\r\nlady's tender-heartedness than from her sense of justice.\r\n\r\nPublisher has just sent to say that I must give him any corrections for\r\nsecond thousand of my booklet immediately.\r\n\r\nWhy did not Miss Etty send any critical remarks on that subject by the\r\nsame post? I should be most immensely obliged for them.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[During this period of special work at the anthropological side of the\r\nEvolution theory, Huxley made two important contributions to the general\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nAs secretary of the Geological Society, the duty of delivering the\r\nanniversary address in 1862 fell to him in the absence of the president,\r\nLeonard Horner, who had been driven by ill-health to winter in Italy.\r\n\r\nThe object at which he aimed appears from the postscript of a brief note\r\nof February 19, 1862, to Hooker:--]\r\n\r\nI am writing the body of the address, and I am going to criticise\r\nPaleontological doctrines in general in a way that will flutter their\r\nnerves considerable.\r\n\r\nDarwin is met everywhere with--Oh this is opposed to paleontology, or\r\nthat is opposed to paleontology--and I mean to turn round and ask, \"Now,\r\nmessieurs les Paleontologues, what the devil DO you really know?\"\r\n\r\nI have not changed sex, although the postscript is longer than the\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n[The delivery of the address itself on February 21 (On \"Geological\r\nContemporaneity\" (\"Collected Essays\" 8 292).) is thus described by Sir\r\nCharles Lyell (To a note of whose, proposing a talk over the subject,\r\nHuxley replies on May 5], \"I am very glad you find something to think\r\nabout in my address. That is the best of all praise.\") [(\"Life and\r\nLetters\" 2 356):--\r\n\r\nHuxley delivered a brilliant critical discourse on what paleontology has\r\nand has not done, and proved the value of negative evidence, how much\r\nthe progressive development system has been pushed too far, how little\r\ncan be said in favour of Owen's more generalised types when we go back\r\nto the vertebrata and in vertebrata of remote ages, the persistency of\r\nmany forms high and low throughout time, how little we know of the\r\nbeginning of life upon the earth, how often events called\r\ncontemporaneous in Geology are applied to things which, instead of\r\ncoinciding in time, may have happened ten millions of years apart, etc.;\r\nand a masterly sketch comparing the past and present in almost every\r\nclass in zoology, and sometimes of botany cited from Hooker, which he\r\nsaid he had done because it was useful to look into the cellars and see\r\nhow much gold there was there, and whether the quantity of bullion\r\njustified such an enormous circulation of paper. I never remember an\r\naddress listened to with such applause, though there were many private\r\nprotests against some of his bold opinions.\r\n\r\nThe dinner at Willis's was well attended; I should think eighty or more\r\npresent...and late in the evening Huxley made them merry by a sort of\r\nmock-modest speech.]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, May 6, 1862.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nI was very glad to get your note about my address. I profess to be a\r\ngreat stoic, you know, but there are some people from whom I am glad to\r\nget a pat on the back. Still I am not quite content with that, and I\r\nwant to know what you think of the argument--whether you agree with what\r\nI say about contemporaneity or not, and whether you are prepared to\r\nadmit--as I think your views compel you to do--that the whole Geological\r\nRecord is only the skimmings of the pot of life.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I want you to chuckle with me over the notion I find a\r\ngreat many people entertain--that the address is dead against your\r\nviews. The fact being, as they will by and by wake up [to] see that\r\nyours is the only hypothesis which is not negatived by the facts,--one\r\nof its great merits being that it allows not only of indefinite standing\r\nstill, but of indefinite retrogression.\r\n\r\nI am going to try to work the whole argument into an intelligible form\r\nfor the general public as a chapter in my forthcoming \"Evidence\" (one\r\nhalf of which I am happy to say is now written) [\"Evidence as to Man's\r\nPlace in Nature.\"], so I shall be very glad of any criticisms or hints.\r\n\r\nSince I saw you--indeed, from the following Tuesday onwards--I have\r\namused myself by spending ten days or so in bed. I had an unaccountable\r\nprostration of strength which they called influenza, but which, I\r\nbelieve, was nothing but some obstruction in the liver.\r\n\r\nOf course I can't persuade people of this, and they will have it that it\r\nis overwork. I have come to the conviction, however, that steady work\r\nhurts nobody, the real destroyer of hardworking men being not their\r\nwork, but dinners, late hours, and the universal humbug and excitement\r\nof society.\r\n\r\nI mean to get out of all that and keep out of it.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The other contribution to the general question was his Working Men's\r\nLectures for 1862. As he writes to Darwin on October 10--] \"I can't find\r\nanything to talk to the working men about this year but your book. I\r\nmean to give them a commentary a la Coke upon Lyttleton.\"\r\n\r\n[The lectures to working men here referred to, six in number, were duly\r\ndelivered once a week from November 10 onwards, and published in the\r\nform of as many little pamphlets. Appearing under the general title, \"On\r\nour Knowledge of the Causes of the Phenomena of Organic Nature,\" they\r\nwound up with a critical examination of the portion of Mr. Darwin's work\r\n\"On the Origin of Species,\" in relation to the complete theory of the\r\ncauses of organic nature.\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, December 2, 1862.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nI send you by this post three of my working men's lectures now in course\r\nof delivery. As you will see by the prefatory notice, I was asked to\r\nallow them to be taken down in shorthand for the use of the audience,\r\nbut I have no interest in them, and do not desire or intend that they\r\nshould be widely circulated.\r\n\r\nSometime hence, may be, I may revise and illustrate them, and make them\r\ninto a book as a sort of popular exposition of your views, or at any\r\nrate of my version of your views.\r\n\r\nThere really is nothing new in them nor anything worth your attention,\r\nbut if in glancing over them at any time you should see anything to\r\nobject to, I should like to know.\r\n\r\nI am very hard worked just now--six lectures a week, and no end of other\r\nthings--but as vigorous as a three-year old. Somebody told me you had\r\nbeen ill, but I hope it was fiction, and that you and Mrs. Darwin and\r\nall your belongings are flourishing.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[In reply, Darwin writes on December 10:--\r\n\r\nI agree entirely with all your reservations about accepting the\r\ndoctrine, and you might have gone further with perfect safety and\r\ntruth...\r\n\r\nTouching the \"Natural History Review,\" \"Do inaugurate a great\r\nimprovement, and have pages cut, like the Yankees do; I will heap\r\nblessings on your head.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again, December 18:--\r\n\r\nI have read Numbers 4 and 5. They are simply perfect. They ought to be\r\nlargely advertised; but it is very good in me to say so, for I threw\r\ndown Number 4 with this reflection, \"What is the good of my writing a\r\nthundering big book, when everything is in this green little book so\r\ndespicable for its size?\" In the name of all that is good and bad I may\r\nas well shut up shop altogether.\r\n\r\nThese lectures met with an annoying amount of success. They were not\r\ncast into permanent form, for he grudged the time necessary to prepare\r\nthem for the press. However, he gave a Mr. Hardwicke permission to take\r\nthem down in shorthand as delivered for the use of the audience. But no\r\nsooner were they printed, than they had a large sale. Writing to Sir\r\nJ.D. Hooker early in the following month, he says:]\r\n\r\nI fully meant to have sent you all the successive lectures as they came\r\nout, and I forward a set with all manner of apologies for my\r\ndelinquency. I am such a 'umble-minded party that I never imagined the\r\nlectures as delivered would be worth bringing out at all, and I knew I\r\nhad no time to work them out. Now, I lament I did not publish them\r\nmyself and turn an honest penny by them as I suspect Hardwicke is doing.\r\nHe is advertising them everywhere, confound him.\r\n\r\nI wish when you have read them you would tell me whether you think it\r\nwould be worthwhile for me to re-edit, enlarge, and illustrate them by\r\nand by.\r\n\r\n[And on January 28 Sir Charles Lyell writes to him:--\r\n\r\nI do grudge Hardwicke very much having not only the publisher's but the\r\nauthor's profits. It so often happens that popular lectures designed for\r\na class and inspired by an attentive audience's sympathy are better than\r\nany writing in the closet for the purpose of educating the many as\r\nreaders, and of remunerating the publisher and author. I would lose no\r\ntime in considering well what steps to take to rescue the copyright of\r\nthe third thousand.\r\n\r\nAs for the value of the work thus done in support of Darwin's theory, it\r\nis worth while quoting the words of Lord Kelvin, when, as President of\r\nthe Royal Society in 1894, it fell to him to award Huxley the Darwin\r\nMedal:--\r\n\r\nTo the world at large, perhaps, Mr. Huxley's share in moulding the\r\nthesis of NATURAL SELECTION is less well-known than is his bold\r\nunwearied exposition and defence of it after it had been made public.\r\nAnd, indeed, a speculative trifler, revelling in the problems of the\r\n\"might have been,\" would find a congenial theme in the inquiry how soon\r\nwhat we now call \"Darwinism\" would have met with the acceptance with\r\nwhich it has met, and gained the power which it has gained, had it not\r\nbeen for the brilliant advocacy with which in its early days it was\r\nexpounded to all classes of men.\r\n\r\nThat advocacy had one striking mark: while it made or strove to make\r\nclear how deep the new view went down, and how far it reached, it never\r\nshrank from trying to make equally clear the limit beyond which it could\r\nnot go.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.16.\r\n\r\n1860-1861.\r\n\r\n[The letters given in the following chapters illustrate the occupations\r\nand interests of the years 1860 to 1863, apart from the struggle over\r\nthe species question.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important and most engrossing was the launching of a\r\nscientific quarterly to do more systematically and thoroughly what had\r\nbeen done since 1858 in the fortnightly scientific column of the\r\n\"Saturday Review.\" Its genesis is explained in the following letter:--]\r\n\r\nJuly 17, 1860.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nSome time ago Dr. Wright of Dublin talked to me about the \"Natural\r\nHistory Review,\" which I believe to a great extent belongs to him, and\r\nwanted me to join in the editorship, provided certain alterations were\r\nmade. I promised to consider the matter, and yesterday he and Greene\r\ndined with me, and I learned that Haughton and Galbraith were out of the\r\nreview--that Harvey was likely to go--that a new series was to begin in\r\nJanuary, with Williams and Norgate for publishers over here--that it was\r\nto become an English and not a Hibernian concern in fact--and finally,\r\nthat if I chose to join as one of the editors, the effectual control\r\nwould be pretty much in my own hands. Now, considering the state of the\r\ntimes, and the low condition of natural history journalisation (always\r\nexcepting quarterly \"Mic. Journal\") in this country this seems to me to\r\nbe a fine opening for a plastically minded young man, and I am decidedly\r\ninclined to close with the offer, though I shall get nothing but extra\r\nwork by it.\r\n\r\nTo limit the amount of this extra work, however, I must get co-editors,\r\nand I have written to Lubbock and to Rolleston (also plastically minded\r\nyoung men) to see if they will join. Now up to this point you have been\r\nin a horrid state of disgust, because you thought I was going to ask you\r\nnext. But I am not, for rejoiced as I should be to have you, I know you\r\nhave heaps of better work to do, and hate journalism.\r\n\r\nBut can you tell me of any plastic young botanist who would come in all\r\nthere glory and no pay, though I think pay may be got if the concern is\r\nproperly worked. How about Oliver?\r\n\r\nAnd though you can't and won't be an editor yourself, won't you help us\r\nand pat us on the back?\r\n\r\nThe tone of the \"Review\" will be mildly episcopophagous, and you and\r\nDarwin and Lyell will have a fine opportunity if you wish it of slaying\r\nyour adversaries.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[Several of his elder friends tried to dissuade him from an undertaking\r\nwhich would inevitably distract him from his proper work. Sir Charles\r\nLyell prophesied that all the work would drift to the most energetic\r\nmember of the staff, and Huxley writes to Hooker, August 2, 1860:--]\r\n\r\nDarwin wrote me a very kind expostulation about it, telling me I ought\r\nnot to waste myself on other than original work. In reply, however, I\r\nassured him that I MUST waste myself willy-nilly, and that the \"Review\"\r\nwas only a save-all.\r\n\r\nThe more I think of it the more it seems to me it ought to answer if\r\nproperly conducted, and it ought to be of great use.\r\n\r\n[The first number appeared in January 1861. Writing on the 6th, Huxley\r\nsays:--]\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to get such expressions of opinion as I have had from\r\nLyell and Darwin about the Review. They make me quite hopeful about its\r\nprosperity, as I am sure we shall be able to do better than our first\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\n[It was not long, however, before Lyell's prophecy began to come true.\r\nIn June Huxley writes:--]\r\n\r\nIt is no use letting other people look after the journal. I find unless\r\nI revise every page of it, it goes wrong.\r\n\r\n[But in July 1863 he definitely ceased to contribute:--]\r\n\r\nI did not foresee all this crush of work [he writes], when the \"Review\"\r\nwas first started, or I should not have pledged myself to any share in\r\nsupplying it. [Moreover, with the appointment of paid editors that year,\r\nit seemed to him] that the working editors with the credit and pay must\r\ntake the responsibility of all the commissariat of the \"Review\" upon\r\ntheir shoulders.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, in 1865, the \"Review\" came to an end. As Mr. Murray,\r\nthe publisher, remarked, quarterlies did not pay; and this quarterly\r\nbecame still more financially unsound after the over-worked volunteers,\r\nwho both edited and contributed, gave place to paid editors.\r\n\r\nBut Huxley was not satisfied with one defeat. The quarterly scheme had\r\nfailed; he now tried if he could not serve science better by returning\r\nto a more frequent and more popular form of periodical. From 1863 to\r\n1866 he was concerned with the \"Reader,\" a weekly issue (The committee\r\nalso included Professor Cairns, F. Galton, W.F. Pollock, and J.\r\nTyndall.); but this also was too heavy a burden to be borne in addition\r\nto his other work. However, the labour expended in these ventures was\r\nnot wholly thrown away. The experience thus gained at last enabled the\r\npresent Sir Norman Lockyer, who acted as science editor for the\r\n\"Reader,\" to realise what had so long been aimed at by the establishment\r\nof \"Nature\" in 1869.\r\n\r\nApart from his contributions to the species question and the foundation\r\nof a scientific review, Huxley published in 1860 only two special\r\nmonographs (\"On Jacare and Caiman,\" and \"On the Mouth and Pharynx of the\r\nScorpion,\" already mentioned as read in the previous year), but he read\r\n\"Further Observations on Pyrosoma\" at the Linnean Society, and was busy\r\nwith paleontological work, the results of which appeared in three papers\r\nthe following year, the most important of which was the Memoir called a\r\n\"Preliminary Essay on the Arrangement of the Devonian Fishes,\" in the\r\nreport of the Geological Survey, \"which,\" says Sir M. Foster, \"though\r\nentitled a Preliminary Essay, threw an entirely new light on the\r\naffinities of these creatures, and, with the continuation published\r\nlater, in 1866, still remains a standard work.\"\r\n\r\nThe question of the admission of ladies to the learned societies was\r\nalready being mooted, and a letter to Sir Charles Lyell gives his ideas\r\nthus early not only on this point, but on the general question of\r\nwomen's education.]\r\n\r\nMarch 17, 1860.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir Charles,\r\n\r\nTo use the only forcible expression, I \"twig\" your meaning perfectly,\r\nbut I venture to think the parable does not apply. For the Geological\r\nSociety is not, to my mind, a place of education for students, but a\r\nplace of discussion for adepts; and the more it is applied to the former\r\npurpose the less competent it must become to fulfil the latter--its\r\nprimary and most important object.\r\n\r\nI am far from wishing to place any obstacle in the way of the\r\nintellectual advancement and development of women. On the contrary, I\r\ndon't see how we are to make any permanent advancement while one-half of\r\nthe race is sunk, as nine-tenths of women are, in mere ignorant\r\nparsonese superstitions; and to show you that my ideas are practical I\r\nhave fully made up my mind, if I can carry out my own plans, to give my\r\ndaughters the same training in physical science as their brother will\r\nget, so long as he is a boy. They, at any rate, shall not be got up as\r\nman-traps for the matrimonial market. If other people would do the like\r\nthe next generation would see women fit to be the companions of men in\r\nall their pursuits--though I don't think that men have anything to fear\r\nfrom their competition. But you know as well as I do that other people\r\nwon't do the like, and five-sixths of women will stop in the doll stage\r\nof evolution to be the stronghold of parsondom, the drag on\r\ncivilisation, the degradation of every important pursuit with which they\r\nmix themselves--\"intrigues\" in politics, and \"friponnes\" in science.\r\n\r\nIf my claws and beak are good for anything they shall be kept from\r\nhindering the progress of any science I have to do with.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[Three letters to Mr. Spencer show that he had been reading and\r\ncriticising the proofs of the \"First Principles.\" With regard to the\r\nsecond letter, which gives reasons for rejecting Mr. Spencer's remarks\r\nabout the power of inflation in birds during flight, it is curious to\r\nnote Mr. Spencer's reply:--\r\n\r\nHow oddly the antagonism comes out even when you are not conscious of\r\nit! My authority was Owen! I heard him assign this cause for the falling\r\nof wounded birds in one of his lectures at the College of Surgeons.]\r\n\r\n14 Waverley Place, September 3, 1860.\r\n\r\nMy dear Spencer,\r\n\r\nI return your proofs by this post. To my mind nothing can be better than\r\ntheir contents, whether in matter or in manner, and as my wife arrived,\r\nindependently, at the same opinion, I think my judgment is not\r\none-sided.\r\n\r\nThere is something calm and dignified about the tone of the whole--which\r\neminently befits a philosophical work which means to live--and nothing\r\ncan be more clear and forcible than the argument.\r\n\r\nI rejoice that you have made a beginning, and such a beginning--for the\r\nmore I think about it the more important it seems to me that somebody\r\nshould think out into a connected system the loose notions that are\r\nfloating about more or less distinctly in all the best minds.\r\n\r\nIt seems as if all the thoughts in what you have written were my own,\r\nand yet I am conscious of the enormous difference your presentation of\r\nthem makes in my intellectual state. One is thought in the state of hemp\r\nyarn, and the other in the state of rope. Work away, then, excellent\r\nrope-maker, and make us more ropes to hold on against the devil and the\r\nparsons.\r\n\r\nFor myself I am absorbed in dogs--gone to the dogs in fact--having been\r\noccupied in dissecting them for the last fortnight. You do not say how\r\nyour health is.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nSeptember 19, 1860.\r\n\r\nMy dear Spencer,\r\n\r\nYou will forgive the delay which has occurred in forwarding your proof\r\nwhen I tell you that we have lost our poor little son, our pet and hope.\r\nYou who knew him well, and know how his mother's heart and mine were\r\nwrapped up in him, will understand how great is our affliction. He was\r\nattacked with a bad form of scarlet fever on Thursday night, and on\r\nSaturday night effusion on the brain set in suddenly and carried him off\r\nin a couple of hours. Jessie was taken ill on Friday, but has had the\r\ndisease quite lightly, and is doing well. The baby has escaped. So end\r\nmany hopes and plans--sadly enough, and yet not altogether bitterly. For\r\nas the little fellow was our greatest joy so is the recollection of him\r\nan enduring consolation. It is a heavy payment, but I would buy the four\r\nyears of him again at the same price. My wife bears up bravely.\r\n\r\nI have read your proofs at intervals, and you must not suppose they have\r\ntroubled me. On the contrary they were at times the only things I could\r\nattend to. I agree in the spirit of the whole perfectly. On some matters\r\nof detail I had doubts which I am not at present clear-headed enough to\r\nthink out.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I object to in toto is the illustration which I have\r\nmarked at page 24. It is physically impossible that a bird's air-cells\r\nshould be DISTENDED with air during flight, unless the structure of the\r\nparts is in reality different from anything which anatomists at present\r\nknow. Blowing into the trachea is not to the point. A bird cannot blow\r\ninto its own trachea, and it has no mechanism for performing a\r\ncorresponding action.\r\n\r\nA bird's chest is essentially a pair of bellows in which the sternum\r\nduring rest and the back during flight act as movable wall. The air\r\ncells may all be represented as soft-walled bags opening freely into the\r\nbellows--there being, so far as anatomists yet know, no valves or\r\ncorresponding contrivances anywhere except at the glottis, which\r\ncorresponds with the nozzle and air valve both, of our bellows. But the\r\nglottis is always opened when the chest is dilated at each inspiration.\r\nHow then can the air in any air-cell be kept at a higher tension than\r\nthe surrounding atmosphere?\r\n\r\nHunter experimented on the uses of the air sacs, I know, but I have not\r\nhis work at hand. It may be that opening one of the air-cells interferes\r\nwith flight, but I hold it very difficult to conceive that the\r\ninterference can take place in the way you suppose. How on earth is a\r\nlark to sing for ten minutes together if the air-cells are to be kept\r\ndistended all the while he is up in the air?\r\n\r\nAt any rate twenty other illustrations will answer your purpose as well,\r\nso I would not select one which may be assailed by a carping fellow like\r\n\r\nYours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nOctober 10, 1860.\r\n\r\nMy dear Spencer [This was written at the time when Mr. Spencer had\r\nissued a notice of discontinuance, and when measures were being taken to\r\nprevent it.],\r\n\r\n\"A wilful man must have his way,\" and if you won't let me contribute\r\ntowards the material guarantees for the success of your book, I must be\r\ncontent to add twelve shillings' worth of moral influence to that I\r\nalready meant to exert per annum in its favour.\r\n\r\nI shall be most glad henceforth, as ever, to help your great undertaking\r\nin any way I can. The more I contemplate its issues the more important\r\ndoes it seem to me to be, and I assure you that I look upon its success\r\nas the business of all of us. So that if it were not a pleasure I should\r\nfeel it a duty to \"push behind\" as hard as I can.\r\n\r\nHave you seen this quarter's \"Westminster?\" The opening article on\r\n\"Neo-Christianity\" is one of the most remarkable essays in its way I\r\nhave ever read. I suppose it must be Newman's. The \"Review\" is terribly\r\nunequal, some of the other articles being absolutely ungrammatically\r\nwritten. What a pity it is it cannot be thoroughly organised.\r\n\r\nMy wife is a little better, but she is terribly shattered. By the time\r\nyou come back we shall, I hope, have reverted from our present hospital\r\ncondition to our normal arrangements, but in any case we shall be glad\r\nto see you.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The following is, I think, the first reference to his fastidiousness in\r\nthe literary expression and artistic completeness of his work. As he\r\nsaid in an after-dinner speech at a meeting in aid of the Literary Fund,\r\n\"Science and literature are not two things, but two sides of one thing.\"\r\nAnything that was to be published he subjected to repeated revision. And\r\nthus, apologising to Hooker for his absence, he writes (August 2,\r\n1860):--]\r\n\r\nI was sorry to have to send an excuse by Tyndall the other day, but I\r\nfound I must finish the Pyrosoma paper, and all last Tuesday was devoted\r\nto it, and I fear the next after will have the like fate.\r\n\r\nIt constantly becomes more and more difficult to me to FINISH things\r\nsatisfactorily.\r\n\r\n[To Hooker also he writes a few days later:--]\r\n\r\nI hope your ear is better; take care of yourself, there's a good fellow.\r\nI can't do without you these twenty years. We have a devil of a lot to\r\ndo in the way of smiting the Amalekites.\r\n\r\n[Between two men who seldom spoke of their feelings, but let constant\r\nintercourse attest them, these words show more than the practical side\r\nof their friendship, their community of aims and interests. Quick,\r\nstrong-willed, and determined as they both were, the fact that they\r\ncould work together for over forty years without the shadow of a\r\nmisunderstanding, presupposes an unusually strong friendship firmly\r\nbased upon mutual trust and respect as well as liking, the beginning of\r\nwhich Sir J. Hooker thus describes:--\r\n\r\nMy first meeting your father was in 1851, shortly after his return from\r\nthe \"Rattlesnake\" voyage with Captain Stanley. Hearing that I had paid\r\nsome attention to marine zoology during the voyage of the Antarctic\r\nExpedition, he was desirous of showing me the results of his studies of\r\nthe Oceanic Hydrozoa, and he sought me out in consequence. This and the\r\nfact that we had both embarked in the Naval service in the same capacity\r\nas medical officers and with the same object of scientific research,\r\nnaturally led to an intimacy which was undisturbed by a shadow of a\r\nmisunderstanding for nearly forty-five following years. Curiously\r\nenough, our intercourse might have dated from an earlier period by\r\nnearly six years had I accepted an appointment to the \"Rattlesnake\"\r\noffered me by Captain Stanley, which, but for my having arranged for a\r\njourney to India, might have been accepted.\r\n\r\nReturning to the purpose of our interview, the researches Mr. Huxley\r\nlaid before me were chiefly those on the Salpae, a much misunderstood\r\ngroup of marine Hydrozoa. Of these I had amused myself with making\r\ndrawings during the long and often weary months passed at sea on board\r\nthe \"Erebus,\" but having other subjects to attend to, I had made no\r\nfurther study of them than as consumers of the vegetable life (Diatoms)\r\nof the Antarctic Ocean. Hence his observations on their life-history,\r\nhabits, and affinities were on almost all points a revelation to me, and\r\nI could not fail to recognise in their author all the qualities\r\npossessed by a naturalist of commanding ability, industry, and power of\r\nexposition. Our interviews, thus commenced, soon ripened into a\r\nfriendship, which led to an arrangement for a monthly meeting, and in\r\nthe informal establishment of a club of nine, the other members of which\r\nwere, Mr. Busk, Dr. Frankland, Mr. Hirst, Sir J. Lubbock, Mr. Herbert\r\nSpencer, Dr. Tyndall, and Mr. Spottiswoode.\r\n\r\nJust a month after this letter to his friend, the same year which had\r\nfirst brought Huxley public recognition outside his special sphere\r\nbrought him also the greatest sorrow perhaps of his whole life. I have\r\nalready spoken of the sudden death of the little son in whom so much of\r\nhis own and his wife's happiness was centred. The suddenness of the blow\r\nmade it all the more crushing, and the mental strain, intensified by the\r\nsight of his wife's inconsolable grief, brought him perilously near a\r\ncomplete breakdown. But the birth of another son, on December 11, gave\r\nthe mother some comfort; and as the result of a friendly conspiracy\r\nbetween her and Dr. Tyndall, Huxley himself was carried off for a week's\r\nclimbing in Wales between Christmas and the New Year.\r\n\r\nHis reply to a long letter of sympathy in which Charles Kingsley set\r\nforth the grounds of his own philosophy as to the ends of life and the\r\nhope of immortality, affords insight into the very depths of his nature.\r\nIt is a rare outburst at a moment of intense feeling, in which, more\r\ncompletely than in almost any other writing of his, intellectual\r\nclearness and moral fire are to be seen uniting in a veritable passion\r\nfor truth:--]\r\n\r\n14, Waverley Place, September 23, 1860.\r\n\r\nMy dear Kingsley,\r\n\r\nI cannot sufficiently thank you, both on my wife's account and my own,\r\nfor your long and frank letter, and for all the hearty sympathy which it\r\nexhibits--and Mrs. Kingsley will, I hope, believe that we are no less\r\nsensible of her kind thought of us. To myself your letter was especially\r\nvaluable, as it touched upon what I thought even more than upon what I\r\nsaid in my letter to you. My convictions, positive and negative, on all\r\nthe matters of which you speak, are of long and slow growth and are\r\nfirmly rooted. But the great blow which fell upon me seemed to stir them\r\nto their foundation, and had I lived a couple of centuries earlier I\r\ncould have fancied a devil scoffing at me and them--and asking me what\r\nprofit it was to have stripped myself of the hopes and consolations of\r\nthe mass of mankind? To which my only reply was and is--Oh devil! truth\r\nis better than much profit. I have searched over the grounds of my\r\nbelief, and if wife and child and name and fame were all to be lost to\r\nme one after the other as the penalty, still I will not lie.\r\n\r\nAnd now I feel that it is due to you to speak as frankly as you have\r\ndone to me. An old and worthy friend of mine tried some three or four\r\nyears ago to bring us together--because, as he said, you were the only\r\nman who would do me any good. Your letter leads me to think he was\r\nright, though not perhaps in the sense he attached to his own words.\r\n\r\nTo begin with the great doctrine you discuss. I neither deny nor affirm\r\nthe immortality of man. I see no reason for believing in it, but, on the\r\nother hand, I have no means of disproving it.\r\n\r\nPray understand that I have no a priori objections to the doctrine. No\r\nman who has to deal daily and hourly with nature can trouble himself\r\nabout a priori difficulties. Give me such evidence as would justify me\r\nin believing anything else, and I will believe that. Why should I not?\r\nIt is not half so wonderful as the conservation of force, or the\r\nindestructibility of matter. Whoso clearly appreciates all that is\r\nimplied in the falling of a stone can have no difficulty about any\r\ndoctrine simply on account of its marvellousness. But the longer I live,\r\nthe more obvious it is to me that the most sacred act of a man's life is\r\nto say and to feel, \"I believe such and such to be true.\" All the\r\ngreatest rewards and all the heaviest penalties of existence cling about\r\nthat act. The universe is one and the same throughout; and if the\r\ncondition of my success in unravelling some little difficulty of anatomy\r\nor physiology is that I shall rigorously refuse to put faith in that\r\nwhich does not rest on sufficient evidence, I cannot believe that the\r\ngreat mysteries of existence will be laid open to me on other terms. It\r\nis no use to talk to me of analogies and probabilities. I know what I\r\nmean when I say I believe in the law of the inverse squares, and I will\r\nnot rest my life and my hopes upon weaker convictions. I dare not if I\r\nwould.\r\n\r\nMeasured by this standard, what becomes of the doctrine of immortality?\r\n\r\nYou rest in your strong conviction of your personal existence, and in\r\nthe instinct of the persistence of that existence which is so strong in\r\nyou as in most men.\r\n\r\nTo me this is as nothing. That my personality is the surest thing I\r\nknow--may be true. But the attempt to conceive what it is leads me into\r\nmere verbal subtleties. I have champed up all that chaff about the ego\r\nand the non-ego, about noumena and phenomena, and all the rest of it,\r\ntoo often not to know that in attempting even to think of these\r\nquestions, the human intellect flounders at once out of its depth.\r\n\r\nIt must be twenty years since, a boy, I read Hamilton's essay on the\r\nunconditioned, and from that time to this, ontological speculation has\r\nbeen a folly to me. When Mansel took up Hamilton's argument on the side\r\nof orthodoxy (!) I said he reminded me of nothing so much as the man who\r\nis sawing off the sign on which he is sitting, in Hogarth's picture. But\r\nthis by the way.\r\n\r\nI cannot conceive of my personality as a thing apart from the phenomena\r\nof my life. When I try to form such a conception I discover that, as\r\nColeridge would have said, I only hypostatise a word, and it alters\r\nnothing if, with Fichte, I suppose the universe to be nothing but a\r\nmanifestation of my personality. I am neither more nor less eternal than\r\nI was before.\r\n\r\nNor does the infinite difference between myself and the animals alter\r\nthe case. I do not know whether the animals persist after they disappear\r\nor not. I do not even know whether the infinite difference between us\r\nand them may not be compensated by THEIR persistence and MY cessation\r\nafter apparent death, just as the humble bulb of an annual lives, while\r\nthe glorious flowers it has put forth die away.\r\n\r\nSurely it must be plain that an ingenious man could speculate without\r\nend on both sides, and find analogies for all his dreams. Nor does it\r\nhelp me to tell me that the aspirations of mankind--that my own highest\r\naspirations even--lead me towards the doctrine of immortality. I doubt\r\nthe fact, to begin with, but if it be so even, what is this but in grand\r\nwords asking me to believe a thing because I like it.\r\n\r\nScience has taught to me the opposite lesson. She warns me to be careful\r\nhow I adopt a view which jumps with my preconceptions, and to require\r\nstronger evidence for such belief than for one to which I was previously\r\nhostile.\r\n\r\nMy business is to teach my aspirations to conform themselves to fact,\r\nnot to try and make facts harmonise with my aspirations.\r\n\r\nScience seems to me to teach in the highest and strongest manner the\r\ngreat truth which is embodied in the Christian conception of entire\r\nsurrender to the will of God. Sit down before fact as a little child, be\r\nprepared to give up every preconceived notion, follow humbly wherever\r\nand to whatever abysses nature leads, or you shall learn nothing. I have\r\nonly begun to learn content and peace of mind since I have resolved at\r\nall risks to do this.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, other arguments commonly brought forward in favour\r\nof the immortality of man, which are to my mind not only delusive but\r\nmischievous. The one is the notion that the moral government of the\r\nworld is imperfect without a system of future rewards and punishments.\r\nThe other is: that such a system is indispensable to practical morality.\r\nI believe that both these dogmas are very mischievous lies.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the first, I am no optimist, but I have the firmest\r\nbelief that the Divine Government (if we may use such a phrase to\r\nexpress the sum of the \"customs of matter\") is wholly just. The more I\r\nknow intimately of the lives of other men (to say nothing of my own),\r\nthe more obvious it is to me that the wicked does NOT flourish nor is\r\nthe righteous punished. But for this to be clear we must bear in mind\r\nwhat almost all forget, that the rewards of life are contingent upon\r\nobedience to the WHOLE law--physical as well as moral--and that moral\r\nobedience will not atone for physical sin, or vice versa.\r\n\r\nThe ledger of the Almighty is strictly kept, and every one of us has the\r\nbalance of his operations paid over to him at the end of every minute of\r\nhis existence.\r\n\r\nLife cannot exist without a certain conformity to the surrounding\r\nuniverse--that conformity involves a certain amount of happiness in\r\nexcess of pain. In short, as we live we are paid for living.\r\n\r\nAnd it is to be recollected in view of the apparent discrepancy between\r\nmen's acts and their rewards that Nature is juster than we. She takes\r\ninto account what a man brings with him into the world, which human\r\njustice cannot do. If I, born a bloodthirsty and savage brute,\r\ninheriting these qualities from others, kill you, my fellow-men will\r\nvery justly hang me, but I shall not be visited with the horrible\r\nremorse which would be my real punishment if, my nature being higher, I\r\nhad done the same thing.\r\n\r\nThe absolute justice of the system of things is as clear to me as any\r\nscientific fact. The gravitation of sin to sorrow is as certain as that\r\nof the earth to the sun, and more so--for experimental proof of the fact\r\nis within reach of us all--nay, is before us all in our own lives, if we\r\nhad but the eyes to see it.\r\n\r\nNot only, then, do I disbelieve in the need for compensation, but I\r\nbelieve that the seeking for rewards and punishments out of this life\r\nleads men to a ruinous ignorance of the fact that their inevitable\r\nrewards and punishments are here.\r\n\r\nIf the expectation of hell hereafter can keep me from evil-doing, surely\r\na fortiori the certainty of hell now will do so? If a man could be\r\nfirmly impressed with the belief that stealing damaged him as much as\r\nswallowing arsenic would do (and it does), would not the dissuasive\r\nforce of that belief be greater than that of any based on mere future\r\nexpectations?\r\n\r\nAnd this leads me to my other point.\r\n\r\nAs I stood behind the coffin of my little son the other day, with my\r\nmind bent on anything but disputation, the officiating minister read, as\r\na part of his duty, the words, \"If the dead rise not again, let us eat\r\nand drink, for to-morrow we die.\" I cannot tell you how inexpressibly\r\nthey shocked me. Paul had neither wife nor child, or he must have known\r\nthat his alternative involved a blasphemy against all that was best and\r\nnoblest in human nature. I could have laughed with scorn. What! because\r\nI am face to face with irreparable loss, because I have given back to\r\nthe source from whence it came, the cause of a great happiness, still\r\nretaining through all my life the blessings which have sprung and will\r\nspring from that cause, I am to renounce my manhood, and, howling,\r\ngrovel in bestiality? Why, the very apes know better, and if you shoot\r\ntheir young, the poor brutes grieve their grief out and do not\r\nimmediately seek distraction in a gorge.\r\n\r\nKicked into the world a boy without guide or training, or with worse\r\nthan none, I confess to my shame that few men have drunk deeper of all\r\nkinds of sin than I. Happily, my course was arrested in time--before I\r\nhad earned absolute destruction--and for long years I have been slowly\r\nand painfully climbing, with many a fall, towards better things. And\r\nwhen I look back, what do I find to have been the agents of my\r\nredemption? The hope of immortality or of future reward? I can honestly\r\nsay that for these fourteen years such a consideration has not entered\r\nmy head. No, I can tell you exactly what has been at work. \"Sartor\r\nResartus\" led me to know that a deep sense of religion was compatible\r\nwith the entire absence of theology. Secondly, science and her methods\r\ngave me a resting-place independent of authority and tradition. Thirdly,\r\nlove opened up to me a view of the sanctity of human nature, and\r\nimpressed me with a deep sense of responsibility.\r\n\r\nIf at this moment I am not a worn-out, debauched, useless carcass of a\r\nman, if it has been or will be my fate to advance the cause of science,\r\nif I feel that I have a shadow of a claim on the love of those about me,\r\nif in the supreme moment when I looked down into my boy's grave my\r\nsorrow was full of submission and without bitterness, it is because\r\nthese agencies have worked upon me, and not because I have ever cared\r\nwhether my poor personality shall remain distinct for ever from the All\r\nfrom whence it came and whither it goes.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, my dear Kingsley, you will understand what my position is. I\r\nmay be quite wrong, and in that case I know I shall have to pay the\r\npenalty for being wrong. But I can only say with Luther, \"Gott helfe\r\nmir, Ich kann nichts anders.\"\r\n\r\nI know right well that 99 out of 100 of my fellows would call me\r\natheist, infidel, and all the other usual hard names. As our laws stand,\r\nif the lowest thief steals my coat, my evidence (my opinions being\r\nknown) would not be received against him. [The law with respect to oaths\r\nwas reformed in 1869.]\r\n\r\nBut I cannot help it. One thing people shall not call me with justice\r\nand that is--a liar. As you say of yourself, I too feel that I lack\r\ncourage; but if ever the occasion arises when I am bound to speak, I\r\nwill not shame my boy.\r\n\r\nI have spoken more openly and distinctly to you than I ever have to any\r\nhuman being except my wife.\r\n\r\nIf you can show me that I err in premises or conclusion, I am ready to\r\ngive up these as I would any other theories. But at any rate you will do\r\nme the justice to believe that I have not reached my conclusions without\r\nthe care befitting the momentous nature of the problems involved.\r\n\r\nAnd I write this the more readily to you, because it is clear to me that\r\nif that great and powerful instrument for good or evil, the Church of\r\nEngland, is to be saved from being shivered into fragments by the\r\nadvancing tide of science--an event I should be very sorry to witness,\r\nbut which will infallibly occur if men like Samuel of Oxford are to have\r\nthe guidance of her destinies--it must be by the efforts of men who,\r\nlike yourself, see your way to the combination of the practice of the\r\nChurch with the spirit of science. Understand that all the younger men\r\nof science whom I know intimately are ESSENTIALLY of my way of thinking.\r\n(I know not a scoffer or an irreligious or an immoral man among them,\r\nbut they all regard orthodoxy as you do Brahmanism.) Understand that\r\nthis new school of the prophets is the only one that can work miracles,\r\nthe only one that can constantly appeal to nature for evidence that it\r\nis right, and you will comprehend that it is of no use to try to\r\nbarricade us with shovel hats and aprons, or to talk about our doctrines\r\nbeing \"shocking.\"\r\n\r\nI don't profess to understand the logic of yourself, Maurice, and the\r\nrest of your school, but I have always said I would swear by your\r\ntruthfulness and sincerity, and that good must come of your efforts. The\r\nmore plain this was to me, however, the more obvious the necessity to\r\nlet you see where the men of science are driving, and it has often been\r\nin my mind to write to you before.\r\n\r\nIf I have spoken too plainly anywhere, or too abruptly, pardon me, and\r\ndo the like to me.\r\n\r\nMy wife thanks you very much for your volume of sermons.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[A letter written in reply to the suggestion that he should carry out\r\nHooker's own good resolutions of keeping out of the turmoil of life, and\r\ndevoting himself to pure science, seems to indicate in its tone\r\nsomething of the stress of the time when it was written:--]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, December 19, 1860.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nWhat with one thing and another, I have almost forgotten to answer your\r\nnote--and first, as to the business matter...Next as to my own private\r\naffairs, the youngster is \"a swelling wisibly,\" and my wife is getting\r\non better than I hoped, though not quite so well as I could have wished.\r\nThe boy's advent is a great blessing to her in all ways. For myself I\r\nhardly know yet whether it is pleasure or pain. The ground has gone from\r\nunder my feet once, and I hardly know how to rest on anything again.\r\nIrrational, you will say, but nevertheless natural. And finally as to\r\nyour resolutions, my holy pilgrim, they will be kept about as long as\r\nthe resolutions of other anchorites who are thrown into the busy world,\r\nor I won't say that, for assuredly you will take the world \"as coolly as\r\nyou can,\" and so shall I. But that coolness amounts to the red heat of\r\nproperly constructed mortals.\r\n\r\nIt is no use having any false modesty about the matter. You and I, if we\r\nlast ten years longer, and you by a long while first, will be the\r\nrepresentatives of our respective lines in this country. In that\r\ncapacity we shall have certain duties to perform to ourselves, to the\r\noutside world, and to science. We shall have to swallow praise which is\r\nno great pleasure, and to stand multitudinous basting and irritations,\r\nwhich will involve a good deal of unquestionable pain. Don't flatter\r\nyourself that there is any moral chloroform by which either you or I can\r\nrender ourselves insensible or acquire the habit of doing things coolly.\r\nIt is assuredly of no great use to tear one's self to pieces before one\r\nis fifty. But the alternative, for men constructed on the high pressure\r\ntubular boiler principle, like ourselves, is to lie still and let the\r\ndevil have his own way. And I will be torn to pieces before I am forty\r\nsooner than see that.\r\n\r\nI have been privately trading on my misfortunes in order to get a little\r\npeace and quietness for a few months. If I can help it I don't mean to\r\ndo any dining out this winter, and I have cut down Societies to the\r\nminimum of the Geological, from which I cannot get away.\r\n\r\nBut it won't do to keep this up too long. By and by one must drift into\r\nthe stream again, and then there is nothing for it but to pull like mad\r\nunless we want to be run down by every collier.\r\n\r\nI am going to do one sensible thing, however, viz. to rush down to\r\nLlanberis with Busk between Christmas Day and New Year's Day and get my\r\nlungs full of hill-air for the coming session.\r\n\r\nI was at Down on Saturday and saw Darwin. He seems fairly well, and his\r\ndaughter was up and looks better than I expected to see her.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[Meanwhile, he took the opportunity to make the child's birth a new link\r\nwith his old friend, and wrote as follows :--]\r\n\r\n14 Waverley Place, January 3, 1861.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nIf I had nothing else to write about I must wish you a Happy New Year\r\nand many on 'em; but, in fact, my wife and I have a great favour to ask\r\nof you, which is neither more nor less than to stand godfather for our\r\nlittle son. You know my opinions on these matters, and I would not ask\r\nyou to do anything I would not do myself, so if you consent, the clerk\r\nshall tell all the lies for you, and you shall be asked to do nothing\r\nelse than to help devour the christening feed, and be as good a friend\r\nto the boy as you have been to his father.\r\n\r\nMy wife will have the youngster christened, although I am always in a\r\nbad temper from the time it is talked about until the ceremony is over.\r\nThe only way of turning the farce into a reality is by making it an\r\nextra bond with one's friends. On the other hand, if you have any\r\nobjection to say, \"all this I steadfastly believe,\" even by deputy, I\r\nknow you will have no hesitation in saying so, and in giving me as frank\r\na refusal as my request. [As against his dislike of consenting to a\r\nrite, to him meaningless, he was moved by a feeling which in part\r\ncorresponded to Descartes' morale par provision,--in part was an\r\nacknowledgment of the possibilities of individual development, making it\r\nonly fair to a child to give it a connection with the official spiritual\r\norganisation of its country, which it could either ignore or continue on\r\nreaching intellectual maturity.]\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any fault to find with the new \"Review.\" I think\r\nyou will see it would have been a dreadful business to translate all the\r\nGerman titles in the bibliography. I returned from a ramble about\r\nSnowdon with Busk and Tyndall on the 31st, all the better. My wife is\r\ndecidedly improved, though she mends but slowly.\r\n\r\nOur best wishes to you and all yours.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H.

We shall not call upon you for some time, I fancy, as\r\nthe mistress doesn't get strong very fast. However, I am only glad she\r\nis well as she is. She came down yesterday for the first time.\r\n\r\nIt is very pleasant to get such expressions of opinion as I have had\r\nfrom you, Lyell, and Darwin about the \"Review.\" They make me quite\r\nhopeful about its prosperity, as I am sure we shall be able to do better\r\nthan our first number.\r\n\r\nI am glad you liked what I said in the opening of my article. [(In the\r\n\"Natural History Review\" 1861 page 67--]\"The proof of his claim to\r\nindependent parentage will not change the brutishness of man's lower\r\nnature; nor, except in those valet souls who cannot see greatness in\r\ntheir fellow because his father was a cobbler, will the demonstration of\r\na pithecoid pedigree one whit diminish man's divine right of kingship\r\nover nature; nor lower the great and princely dignity of perfect\r\nmanhood, which is an order of nobility not inherited, but to be won by\r\neach of us, so far as he consciously seeks good and avoids evil, and\r\nputs the faculties with which he is endowed to their fittest use.\") I\r\nwish not to be in any way confounded with the cynics who delight in\r\ndegrading man, or with the common run of materialists, who think mind is\r\nany the lower for being a function of matter. I dislike them even more\r\nthan I do the pietists.\r\n\r\nSome of these days I shall look up the ape question again, and go over\r\nthe rest of the organisation in the same way. But in order to get a\r\nthorough grip of the question, I must examine into a good many points\r\nfor myself. The results, when they do come out, will, I foresee,\r\nastonish the natives.\r\n\r\nI am cold-proof, and all the better for the Welsh trip. To say truth, I\r\nwas just on the edge of breaking down when I went. Did I ever send you a\r\nletter of mine on the teaching of Natural History? It was published\r\nwhile you were away, and I forget whether I sent it or not. However, a\r\ncopy accompanies this note...\r\n\r\nOf course there will be room for your review and welcome. I have put it\r\ndown and reckon on it.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[Huxley returned from the trip to Wales in time to be with his wife for\r\nthe New Year. The plot she had made with Dr. Tyndall had been entirely\r\nsuccessful. The threatened breakdown was averted. Wales in winter was as\r\ngood as Switzerland. Of the ascent of Snowdon he writes on December 28:]\r\n\"Both Tyndall and I voted it under present circumstances as good as most\r\nthings Alpine.\"\r\n\r\n[His wife, however, continued in very weak health. She was prostrated by\r\nthe loss of her little boy. So in the middle of March he gladly accepted\r\nMr. Darwin's invitation for her and the three children to spend a\r\nfortnight in the quiet of his house at Down, where he himself managed to\r\nrun down for a week end.] \"It appears to me,\" [he writes to his wife,]\r\n\"that you are subjecting poor Darwin to a savage Tennysonian\r\npersecution. I shall see him looking like a martyr and across talk\r\ndouble science next Sunday.\"\r\n\r\n[In April another good friend, Dr. Bence Jones, lent the invalid his\r\nhouse at Folkestone for three months. Unable even to walk when she went\r\nthere, her recovery was a slow business. Huxley ran down every week; his\r\nbrother George and his wife also were frequent visitors. Meanwhile he\r\nresolved to move into a new house, in order that she might not return to\r\na place so full of sorrowful memories. On May 30 he effected the move to\r\na larger house not half a mile away from Waverley Place--26 Abbey Place\r\n(now 23 Abercorn Place). Here also Mrs. Heathorn lived for the next\r\nyear, my grandfather, over seventy as he was, being compelled to go out\r\nagain to Australia to look after a business venture of his which had\r\ncome to grief.\r\n\r\nMeantime the old house was still on his hands for another year. Trying\r\nto find a tenant, he writes on May 21, 1861:--]\r\n\r\nI met J. Tyndall at Ramsay's last night, and I think he is greatly\r\ninclined to have the house. I gave him your message and found that a\r\nsneaking kindness for the old house actuated him a good deal in wishing\r\nto take it. It is not a bad fellow, and we won't do him much on the\r\nfixtures.\r\n\r\n[Eventually Tyndall and his friend Hirst established themselves there.\r\n\r\nThis spring Professor Henslow, Mrs. Hooker's father, a botanist of the\r\nfirst rank, and a man extraordinarily beloved by all who came in contact\r\nwith him, was seized with a mortal illness, and lingered on without hope\r\nof recovery through almost the whole of April. Huxley writes:--]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, April 4, 1861.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI am very much grieved and shocked by your letter. The evening before\r\nlast I heard from Busk that your father-in-law had been ill, and that\r\nyou had been to see him, and I meant to have written to you yesterday to\r\ninquire, but it was driven out of my head by people coming here. And\r\nthen I had a sort of unreasonable notion that I should see you at the\r\nLinnean Council to-day and hear that all was right again. God knows, I\r\nfeel for you and your poor wife. Knowing what a great rift the loss of a\r\nmere undeveloped child will leave in one's life, I can faintly picture\r\nto myself the great and irreparable vacuity in a family circle caused by\r\nthe vanishing out of it of such a man as Henslow, with great\r\nacquirements, and that great calm catholic judgment and sense which\r\nalways seemed to me more prominent in him than in any man I ever knew.\r\n\r\nHe had intellect to comprehend his highest duty distinctly, and force of\r\ncharacter to do it; which of us dare ask for a higher summary of his\r\nlife than that? For such a man there can be no fear in facing the great\r\nunknown, his life has been one long experience of the substantial\r\njustice of the laws by which this world is governed, and he will calmly\r\ntrust to them still as he lays his head down for his long sleep.\r\n\r\nYou know all these things as well as I do, and I know as well as you do\r\nthat such thoughts do not cure heartache or assuage grief. Such\r\nmaladies, when men are as old as you and I are, are apt to hang about\r\none a long time, but I find that if they are faced and accepted as part\r\nof our fair share of life, a great deal of good is to be got out of\r\nthem. You will find that too, but in the meanwhile don't go and break\r\nyourself down with over wear and tear. The heaviest pull comes after the\r\nexcitement of a catastrophe of this kind is over.\r\n\r\nBelieve in my affectionate sympathy with you, and that I am, my dear old\r\nfellow, yours ever,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[And again on the 18th:--]\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your two letters. It would be sad to hear of life\r\ndragging itself out so painfully and slowly, if it were not for what you\r\ntell me of the calmness and wisdom with which the poor sufferer uses\r\nsuch strength as is left him.\r\n\r\nOne can express neither wish nor hope in such a case. With such a man\r\nwhat is will be well. All I have to repeat is, don't knock yourself up.\r\nI wish to God I could help you in some way or other beyond repeating the\r\nparrot cry. If I can, of course you will let me know.\r\n\r\n[In June 1861 a jotting in his notebook records that he is at work on\r\nthe chick's skull, part of the embryological work which he took up\r\nvigorously at this time, and at once the continuation of his researches\r\non the Vertebrate Skull, embodied in his Croonian lecture of 1858, and\r\nthe beginning of a long series of investigations into the structure of\r\nbirds. There is a reference to this in a very interesting letter dealing\r\nchiefly with what he conceived to be the cardinal point of the Darwinian\r\ntheory:--]\r\n\r\n26 Abbey Place, September 4, 1861.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nYesterday being the first day I went to the Athenaeum after reading your\r\nnote, I had a look at, and a good laugh over, the \"Quarterly\" article.\r\nWho can be the writer?\r\n\r\nI have been so busy studying chicken development, a difficult subject to\r\nwhich I had long ago made up my mind to devote my first spare time, that\r\nI have written you no word about your article in the \"Gardener's\r\nChronicle.\" I quite agree with the general tendency of your argument,\r\nthough it seems to me that you put your view rather too strongly when\r\nyou seem to question the position \"that, as a rule, resemblances prevail\r\nover differences\" between parent and offspring. Surely, as a rule,\r\nresemblances DO prevail over differences, though I quite agree with you\r\nthat the latter have been far too much overlooked. The great desideratum\r\nfor the species question at present seems to me to be the determination\r\nof the law of variation. Because no law has yet been made out, Darwin is\r\nobliged to speak of variation as if it were spontaneous or a matter of\r\nchance, so that the bishops and superior clergy generally (the only real\r\natheists and believers in chance left in the world) gird at him as if he\r\nwere another Lucretius.\r\n\r\nIt is [in] the recognition of a tendency to variation apart from the\r\nvariation of what are ordinarily understood as external conditions that\r\nDarwin's view is such an advance on Lamarck. Why does not somebody go to\r\nwork experimentally, and get at the law of variation for some one\r\nspecies of plant?\r\n\r\nWhat a capital article that was in the \"Athenaeum\" the other day apud\r\nthe Schlagintweits. [The brothers Schlagintweit (four of whom were\r\nultimately employed), who had gained some reputation for their work on\r\nthe Physical Geography of the Alps, were, on Humboldt's recommendation,\r\ndespatched by the East India Company in 1854-55-56 to the Deccan, and\r\nespecially to the Himalayan region (where they were the first Europeans\r\nto cross the Kuenlun Mountains), in order to correlate the instruments\r\nand observations of the several magnetic surveys of India. But they\r\nenlarged the scope of their mission by professing to correct the great\r\ntrigonometrical survey, while the contract with them was so loosely\r\ndrawn up that they had practically a roving commission in science, to\r\nmake researches and publish the results--up to nine volumes--in all\r\nmanner of subjects, which in fact ranged from the surveying work to\r\nethnology, and were crowned by an additional volume on Buddhism! The\r\noriginal cost to the Indian Government was estimated at 15 thousand\r\npounds sterling; the allowances from the English Government during the\r\ninordinately prolonged period of arranging and publishing materials,\r\nincluding payment for sixty copies of each volume, atlas, and so forth,\r\nas well as personal payments, came to as much more.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the results were of less value than was expected. The\r\nattempt to correct the work done with the large instruments of the\r\ntrigonometrical survey by means of far smaller instruments was absurd;\r\naway from the ground covered by the great survey the figures proved to\r\nbe very inaccurate. The most annoying part of the affair was that it\r\nabsorbed the State aid which might have been given to more valuable\r\nresearches.\r\n\r\nThe Council of the Royal Society had been consulted as to the\r\nadvisability of despatching this expedition and opposed it, for there\r\nwere in the service of the Company not a few men admirably qualified for\r\nthe duty, whose scientific services had received scant appreciation.\r\nNevertheless, the expedition started after all, with the approval of\r\nColonel Sabine, the president. In the last months of 1866, Huxley drew\r\nup for the Royal Society a report upon the scientific value of the\r\nresults of the expedition.] Don Roderigo is very wroth at being made\r\nresponsible with Sabine, and indeed I think he had little enough to do\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nYou will see a letter from him in this week's \"Athenaeum.\"\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.17.\r\n\r\n1861-1863.\r\n\r\n[It has been seen that the addition of journalistic work in science to\r\nthe mass of original research and teaching work upon which Huxley was\r\nengaged, called forth a remonstrance from both Lyell and Darwin. To\r\nHooker it seemed still more serious that he was dividing his allegiance,\r\nand going far afield in philosophy, instead of concentrating himself\r\nupon natural science. He writes:--\r\n\r\nI am sorry to hear that you are so poorly, and wish I could help you to\r\nsit down and work quietly at pure science. You have got into a\r\nwhirlpool, and should stroke vigorously at the proper angle, not attempt\r\nto breast the whole force of the current, nor yet give in to it. Do take\r\nthe counsel of a quiet looker on and withdraw to your books and studies\r\nin pure Natural History; let modes of thought alone. You may make a very\r\ngood naturalist, or a very good metaphysician (of that I know nothing,\r\ndon't despise me), but you have neither time nor place for both.\r\n\r\nHowever, it must be remarked that this love of philosophy, not recently\r\nacquired either, was only part of the passion for general principles\r\nunderlying the facts of science which had always possessed him. And the\r\ntime expended upon it was not directly taken from the hours of\r\nscientific work; he would read in bed through the small hours of the\r\nnight, when sleep was slow in coming to him. In this way he got through\r\nan immense amount of philosophy in the course of several years. Not that\r\nhe could \"state the views of so and so\" upon any given question, or\r\ndesired such kind of knowledge; he wished to find out and compare with\r\nhis own the answers which other thinkers gave to the problems which\r\ninterested himself.\r\n\r\nA gentler reproof of this time touches his handwriting, which was never\r\nof the most legible, so that his foreign correspondents in particular\r\nsometimes complained. Haeckel used to get his difficulties deciphered by\r\nhis colleague Gegenbaur. I cannot forbear quoting the delicate\r\nremonstrance of Professor Lacaze du Thiers, and the flattering remedy he\r\nproposed:--\r\n\r\nMarch 14.\r\n\r\nJe lis l'Anglais imprime, mais vos ecritures anglaises sont si rapides,\r\nqu'il m'est quelquefois difficile de m'en sortir. On me dit que vous\r\necrivez si bien le francais que je crois que je vous lirais bien mieux\r\ndans ma langue!\r\n\r\nOn his return from examining at Dublin, he again looked over proofs for\r\nMr. Spencer.]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, August 3, 1861.\r\n\r\nMy dear Spencer,\r\n\r\nI have been absent on a journey to Dublin and elsewhere [Visiting Sir\r\nPhilip Egerton at Oulton Park.] nearly all this week, and hence your\r\nnote and proof did not reach me till yesterday. I have but just had time\r\nto glance through the latter, and I need hardly say how heartily I\r\nconcur in its general tenor. I have, however, marked one or two passages\r\nwhich I think require some qualification. Then, at page 272, the fact\r\nthat the vital manifestations of plants depend as entirely as those of\r\nanimals upon the fall towards stable equilibrium of the elements of a\r\ncomplex protein compound is not sufficiently prominent. It is not so\r\nmuch that plants are deoxidisers and animals oxidisers, as that plants\r\nare manufacturers and animals consumers. It is true that plants\r\nmanufacture a good deal of non-nitrogenous produce in proportion to the\r\nnitrogenous, but it is the latter which is chiefly useful to the animal\r\nconsumer and not the former. This point is a very important one, which I\r\nhave never seen clearly and distinctly put--the prettiness of Dumas'\r\ncirculation of the elements having seduced everybody.\r\n\r\nOf course this in no way affects the principle of what you say. The\r\nstatements which I have marked at page 276 and 278 should have their\r\nauthorities given, I think. I should hardly like to commit myself to\r\nthem absolutely.\r\n\r\nYou will, if my memory does not mislead me, find authority for my note\r\nat page 283 in Stephenson's life. I think old George Stephenson brought\r\nout his views at breakfast at Sir R. Peel's when Buckland was there.\r\n\r\nThese are all the points that strike me, and I do not keep your proof\r\nany longer (I send it by the same post as this note), because I fear you\r\nmay be inconvenienced by the delay.\r\n\r\nTyndall is unfortunately gone to Switzerland, so that I cannot get you\r\nhis comments. Whether he might have picked holes in any detail or not I\r\ndo not know, but I know his opinions sufficiently well to make sure in\r\nhis agreement with the general argument. In fact a favourite problem of\r\nhis is--Given the molecular forces in a mutton chop, deduce Hamlet or\r\nFaust therefrom. He is confident that the Physics of the Future will\r\nsolve this easily.\r\n\r\nI am grieved to hear such a poor account of your health; I believe you\r\nwill have to come at last to the heroic remedy of matrimony, and if\r\n\"gynopathy\" were a mode of treatment that could be left off if it did\r\nnot suit the constitution, I should decidedly recommend it.\r\n\r\nBut it's worse than opium-eating--once begun and you must go on, and so,\r\nthough I ascribe my own good condition mainly to the care my wife takes\r\nof me, I dare not recommend it to you, lest perchance you should get\r\nhold of the wrong medicine.\r\n\r\nBeyond spending a night awake now and then I am in very good order, and\r\nI am going to spend my vacation in a spasmodic effort to lick the\r\n\"Manual\" into shape and work off some other arrears.\r\n\r\nMy wife is very fairly well, and, I trust, finally freed from all the\r\nsymptoms which alarmed me so much. I dread the coming round of September\r\nfor her again, but it must be faced.\r\n\r\nThe babbies are flourishing; and beyond the facts that we have a lunatic\r\nneighbour on one side and an empty house on the other, that it has cost\r\nme about twice as much to get into my house as I expected, that the\r\ncistern began to leak and spoil a ceiling, and such other small\r\ndrawbacks, the new house is a decided success.\r\n\r\nI forget whether I gave you the address, which is--\r\n\r\n26 Abbey Place, St. John's Wood.\r\n\r\nYou had better direct to me there, as after the 10th of this month I\r\nshall not be here for six weeks.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[October shows an unusual entry in his diary; the sacrifice of a working\r\nevening to hear Jenny Lind sing. Fond though he was of music, as those\r\nmay remember who ever watched his face at the Sunday evening gatherings\r\nin Marlborough Place in the later seventies, when there was sure to be\r\nat least a little good music or singing either from his daughters or\r\nsome of the guests, he seldom could spare the time for concert-going or\r\ntheatre-going, and the occasional notes of his bachelor days, \"to the\r\nopera with Spencer,\" had ceased as his necessary occupations grew more\r\nengrossing.\r\n\r\nThis year his friend Hooker moved to Kew to act as second in command to\r\nhis father, Sir William Hooker, the director of the Botanical Gardens.\r\nThis move made meetings between the two friends, except at clubs and\r\nsocieties, more difficult, and was one of the immediate causes of the\r\nfoundation of the x Club. It is this move which is referred to in the\r\nfollowing letters; the \"poor client\" being the wife of an old messmate\r\nof his on the \"Rattlesnake\":--]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, November 17.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nMy wife wrote to yours yesterday, the enclosed note explaining the\r\nkitchen-revolution which, it seems, must delay our meeting. When she had\r\ndone, however, she did not know where to direct it, and I am no wiser,\r\nso I send it to you.\r\n\r\nIt's a horrid nuisance and I have sworn a few, but that will not cook\r\nthe dinner, however much it may prepare me for being cooked elsewhere.\r\nTo complete my disgust at things in general, my wife is regularly\r\nknocked up with dining out twice this week, though it was only in the\r\nquietest way. I shall have to lock her up altogether.\r\n\r\nX-- has made a horrid mess of it, and I am sorry to say, from what I\r\nknow of him, that I cannot doubt where the fault lies. The worst of it\r\nis that he has a wife and three children over here, left without a penny\r\nor any means of support. The poor woman wrote to me the other day, and\r\nwhen I went to see her I found her at the last shilling and\r\ncontemplating the workhouse as her next step. She has brothers in\r\nAustralia, and it appeared to me that the only way to do her any good\r\nwas to get her out. She cannot starve there, and there will be more hope\r\nfor her children than an English poor-house. I am going to see if the\r\nEmigration Commissioners will do anything for her, as of course it is\r\ndesirable to cut down the cost of exportation to the smallest amount.\r\n\r\nIt is most lamentable that a man of so much ability should have so\r\nutterly damned himself as X-- has, but he is hopelessly Celtic.\r\n\r\nI shall be at the Phil. Club next Thursday.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n14 Waverley Place, Monday morning [November 1861].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nThe obstinate manner in which Mrs. Hooker and you go on refusing to give\r\nany address leads us to believe that you are dwelling peripatetically in\r\na \"Wan\" with green door and brass knocker somewhere on Wormwood Scrubbs,\r\nand that \"Kew\" is only a blind. So you see I am obliged to inclose Mrs.\r\nHooker's epistle to you.\r\n\r\nYou shall have your own way about the dinner, though we shall have\r\ntriumphed over all domestic difficulties by that time, and the first\r\nlieutenant scorns the idea of being \"worrited\" about anything. I only\r\ngrieve it is such a mortal long way for you to come.\r\n\r\nI could find it in my heart to scold you well for your generous aid to\r\nmy poor client. I assure you I told you all about the case because it\r\nwas fresh in my mind, and without the least notion of going to you for\r\nthat kind of aid. May it come back to you in some good shape or other.\r\n\r\nI find it is no use to look for help from the emigration people, but I\r\nhave no fear of being able to get the 50 pounds sterling which will send\r\nthem out by the \"Walter Hood.\"\r\n\r\nWould it be fair to apply to Bell in such a case? I will have a talk to\r\nyou about it at the Phil. Club.\r\n\r\nEver, my dear Hooker, yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[In 1862, in addition to all the work connected with the species\r\nquestion already detailed, Huxley published three paleontological papers\r\n(\"On the new Labyrinthodonts from the coal-field of Edinburgh\"; \"On a\r\nStalk-eyed Crustacean from the coal-fields of Paisley\"; and \"On the\r\nTeeth of Diprotodon.\"), while the paper on the \"Anatomy and Development\r\nof Pyrosoma,\" first read on December 1, 1859, was now published in the\r\n\"Proceedings of the Linnean Society.\"\r\n\r\nIn the list of work in hand are four paleontological papers, besides the\r\nslowly progressing \"Manual of Comparative Anatomy.\" (\"On Indian\r\nFossils,\" on \"Cephalaspis and Pteraspis,\" on \"Stagonolepis,\" and a\r\n\"Memoir descriptive of Labyrinthodont remains from the Trias and Coal of\r\nBritain,\" which he first treated of in 1858, \"clearly establishing for\r\nthe first time the vertebrate nature of these remains.\"--Sir M. Foster,\r\nObituary Notice \"Proceedings of the Royal Society\" 59 55.)\r\n\r\nWhen he went north to deliver his lectures at Edinburgh \"On the relation\r\nof Man to the Lower Animals,\" he took the opportunity of examining\r\nfossils at Forfar, and lectured also at Glasgow; while at Easter he went\r\nto Ireland; on March 15 he was at Dublin, lecturing there on the 25th.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made (in the letter to C. Darwin of May 6,\r\n1862) to the unsatisfactory state of Huxley's health. He was further\r\ncrippled by neuralgic rheumatism in his arm and shoulder, and to get rid\r\nof this, went on July 1 to Switzerland for a month's holiday. Reaching\r\nGrindelwald on the 4th, he was joined on the 6th by Dr. Tyndall, and\r\nwith him rambled on the glacier and made an expedition to the Faulhorn.\r\nOn the 13th they went to the Rhone glacier, meeting Sir J. Lubbock on\r\ntheir way, at the other side of the Grimsel. Both here and at the\r\nEggischhorn, where they went a few days later, Huxley confined himself\r\nto easy expeditions, or, as his notebook has it, stayed \"quiet\" or\r\n\"idle,\" while the hale pair ascended the Galenstock and the Jungfrau.\r\n\r\nBy July 28 he was home again in time for an examiners' meeting at the\r\nLondon University the next day, and a viva voce in physiology on the 4th\r\nAugust, before going to Scotland to serve on the Fishery Commission.\r\n\r\nThis was the first of the numerous commissions on which he served. With\r\nhis colleagues, Dr. Lyon Playfair (afterwards Lord Playfair) and Colonel\r\nMaxwell, he was busy from August 8 to September 16, chiefly on the west\r\ncoast, taking evidence from the trawlers and their opponents, and making\r\ndirect investigations into the habits of the herring.\r\n\r\nThe following letter to Mr. (afterwards Sir W.H.) Flower, then Curator\r\nof the Royal College of Surgeons' Museum, refers to this trip and to his\r\nappointment to the examinership in physiology at the College of\r\nSurgeons, for which he had applied in May and which he held until 1870.\r\nMr. Flower, indeed, was deeply interested at this time in the same\r\nproblems as Huxley, and helped his investigations for \"Man's Place\" by\r\nmaking a number of dissections to test the disputed relations between\r\nthe brain of man and of the apes.]\r\n\r\nHotel de la Jungfrau, Aeggischhorn, July 18, 1862.\r\n\r\nMy dear Flower,\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your letter. I shall make my acknowledgments to the\r\ncouncil in due form when I have read the official announcement on my\r\nreturn to England. I trust they will not have occasion to repent\r\ndeclining Dr. --'s offer. At any rate I shall do my best.\r\n\r\nI am particularly obliged to you for telling me about the Dijon bones.\r\nDijon lies quite in my way in returning to England, and I shall stop a\r\nday there for the purpose of making the acquaintance of M. Nodet and his\r\nSchizopleuron. I have a sort of dim recollection that there are some\r\nother remains of extinct South American mammals in the Dijon Museum\r\nwhich I ought to see.\r\n\r\nYour news about the lower jaw made me burst out into such an exclamation\r\nthat all the salle-a-manger heard me! I saw the fitness of the thing at\r\nonce. The foramen and the shape of the condyle ought to have suggested\r\nit at once.\r\n\r\nI have had a very pleasant trip, passing through Grindelwald, the Aar\r\nvalley, and the Rhone valley, as far as here; but, up to the day before\r\nyesterday, my health remained very unsatisfactory, and I was terribly\r\nteased by the neuralgia or rheumatism or whatever it is.\r\n\r\nOn that day, however, I had a very sharp climb involving a great deal of\r\nexertion and a most prodigious sweating, and on the next morning I\r\nreally woke up a new man. Yesterday I repeated the dose and I am in\r\nhopes now that I shall come back fit to grapple with all the work that\r\nlies before me.\r\n\r\nEver, my dear Flower, yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[This autumn he gladly took on what appeared to be an additional piece\r\nof work. On October 12 he writes from 26 Abbey Place:--]\r\n\r\nI saw Flower yesterday, and I find that my present colleague in the\r\nHunterian Professorship wishes to get rid of his share in the lectures,\r\nhaving, I suppose, at the eleventh hour discovered his incompetency. It\r\nlooks paradoxical to say so, but it will really be easier for me to give\r\neighteen or twenty-four lectures than twelve, so that I have professed\r\nmy readiness to take as much as he likes off his hands.\r\n\r\n[This Professorship had been in existence for more than sixty years, for\r\nwhen the Museum of the famous anatomist John Hunter was entrusted to the\r\nCollege of Surgeons by the Government, the condition was made that \"one\r\ncourse of lectures, not less than twenty-four in number, on comparative\r\nanatomy and other subjects, illustrated by the preparations, shall be\r\ngiven every year by some member of the company.\" Huxley arranged to\r\npublish from year to year the substance of his lectures on the\r\nvertebrates, \"and by that process to bring out eventually a\r\ncomprehensive, though condensed, systematic work on 'Comparative\r\nAnatomy'.\" (\"Comparative Anatomy\" volume 1 Preface.)\r\n\r\nOf the labour entailed in this course, the late Sir W.H. Flower wrote:--\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1862, he was appointed to the Hunterian Professorship at the\r\nCollege of Surgeons, he took for the subject of several yearly courses\r\nof lectures the anatomy of the vertebrata, beginning with the primates,\r\nand as the subject was then rather new to him, and as it was a rule with\r\nhim never to make a statement in a lecture which was not founded upon\r\nhis own actual observation, he set to work to make a series of original\r\ndissections of all the forms he treated of. These were carried on in the\r\nworkroom at the top of the college, and mostly in the evenings, after\r\nhis daily occupation at Jermyn Street (the School of Mines, as it was\r\nthen called) was over, an arrangement which my residence in the college\r\nbuildings enabled me to make for him. These rooms contained a large\r\nstore of material, entire or partially dissected animals preserved in\r\nspirit, which, unlike those mounted in the museum, were available for\r\nfurther investigation in any direction, and these, supplemented\r\noccasionally by fresh subjects from the Zoological Gardens, formed the\r\nfoundation of the lectures...On these evenings it was always my\r\nprivilege to be with him, and to assist in the work in which he was\r\nengaged. In dissecting, as in everything else, he was a very rapid\r\nworker, going straight to the point he wished to ascertain with a firm\r\nand steady hand, never diverted into side issues, nor wasting any time\r\nin unnecessary polishing up for the sake of appearances; the very\r\nopposite, in fact, to what is commonly known as \"finikin.\" His great\r\nfacility for bold and dashing sketching came in most usefully in this\r\nwork, the notes he made being largely helped out with illustrations.\r\n\r\nThe following is the letter in which he makes himself known to Professor\r\nHaeckel of Jena, who, in his thanks for the specimens, bewails the lot\r\nof \"us poor inland Germans, who have to get help from England.\"]\r\n\r\nThe Royal School of Mines, Jermyn Street, October 28, 1862.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nA copy of your exceedingly valuable and beautiful monograph, \"Die\r\nRadiolarien,\" came into my hands two or three days ago, and I have been\r\ndevoting the little leisure I possess just at present to a careful study\r\nof its contents, which are to me profoundly interesting and instructive.\r\n\r\nPermit me to say this much by way of introduction to a request which I\r\nhave to prefer, which is, that you will be good enough to let me have a\r\ncopy of your Habitationsschrift, \"De Rhizopodum Finibus,\" if you have\r\none to spare. If it is sent through Frommans of Jena to the care of\r\nMessrs. Williams and Norgate, London, it will reach me safely.\r\n\r\nI observe that in your preface you state that you have no specimen of\r\nthe famous Barbadoes deposit. As I happen to possess some from\r\nSchomburgk's own collection, I should be ashamed to allow you any longer\r\nto suffer from that want, and I beg your acceptance of the inclosed\r\nlittle packet. If this is not sufficient, pray let me know and I will\r\nsend you as much more.\r\n\r\nIf you desire it, I can also send you some of the Oran earth, and as\r\nmuch as you like of the Atlantic deep-sea soundings, which are almost\r\nentirely made up of Globigerina and Polycistina.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nThomas H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The next letter refers to the scientific examinations at the University\r\nof London.]\r\n\r\nDecember 4, 1862.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI look upon you as art and part of the \"Natural History Review,\" though\r\nnot ostensibly one of the gang, so I bid you to a feast, partly of\r\nreason and partly of mutton, at my house on December 11 (being this day\r\nweek) at half-past six. Do come if you can, for we have not seen your\r\nugly old phiz for ages, and should be comforted by an inspection\r\nthereof, however brief.\r\n\r\nI did my best yesterday to get separate exhibitions for Chemistry,\r\nBotany, and Zoological Biology, at the committee yesterday [At the\r\nLondon University.], and I suspect from your letter that if you had been\r\nthere you would have backed me. However, it is clear that they only mean\r\nto give separate exhibits for Chemistry and Biology as a whole.\r\n\r\nBecause Botany and Zoology are, philosophically speaking, cognate\r\nsubjects, people are under the delusion that it is easier to work both\r\nup at the same time, than it would be to work up, say, Chemistry and\r\nBotany. Just fancy asking a young man who has heaps of other things to\r\nwork up for the B.Sc., to qualify himself for honours both in botany,\r\nhistological, systematic, and physiological. That is to say, to get a\r\nPRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE of both these groups of subjects.\r\n\r\nI really think the botanical and zoological examiners ought to\r\nmemorialise the senate jointly on the subject. The present system leads\r\nto mere sham and cram.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The year 1863, notable for the publication of Huxley's first book,\r\nfound him plunged deep in an immense quantity of work of all sorts. He\r\nwas still examiner in Physiology and Comparative Anatomy at the London\r\nUniversity, a post he held from 1855 to 1863, and again from 1865 to\r\n1870, \"making,\" as Sir Michael Foster says, \"even an examination feel\r\nthe influence of the new spirit in biology; and among his examinees at\r\nthat time there was one at least who, knowing Huxley by his writings,\r\nbut by his writings only, looked forward to the viva voce test, not as a\r\ntrial, but as an occasion of delight.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the work mentioned in the following letters, I note three\r\nlectures at Hull on April 6, 8, and 10; a paper on \"Craniology\" (January\r\n17), and his \"Letter on the Human Remains in the Shell Mounds,\" in the\r\n\"Ethnological Society's Transactions,\" while the Fishery Commission\r\nclaimed much of his time, either at the Board of Trade, or travelling\r\nover the north, east, and south coasts from the end of July to the\r\nbeginning of October, and again in November and December.]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, April 30, 1863.\r\n\r\nMy dear Kingsley,\r\n\r\nI am exceedingly pleased to have your good word about the lectures,--and\r\nI think I shall thereby be encouraged to do what a great many people\r\nhave wished--that is, to bring out an enlarged and revised edition of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe only difficulty is time--if one could but work five-and-twenty hours\r\na day!\r\n\r\nWith respect to the sterility question, I do not think there is much\r\ndoubt as to the effect of breeding in and in in destroying fertility.\r\nBut the sterility which must be obtained by the selective breeder in\r\norder to convert his morphological species into physiological\r\nspecies--such as we have in nature--must be quite irrespective of\r\nbreeding in and in.\r\n\r\nThere is no question of breeding in and in between a horse and an ass,\r\nand yet their produce is usually a sterile hybrid.\r\n\r\nSo if Carrier and Tumbler, e.g., were physiological species equivalent\r\nto Horse and Ass, their progeny ought to be sterile or semi-sterile. So\r\nfar as experience has gone, on the contrary, it is perfectly fertile--as\r\nfertile as the progeny of Carrier and Carrier or Tumbler and Tumbler.\r\n\r\nFrom the first time that I wrote about Darwin's book in the \"Times\" and\r\nin the \"Westminster\" until now, it has been obvious to me that this is\r\nthe weak point of Darwin's doctrine. He HAS shown that selective\r\nbreeding is a vera causa for morphological species; he has not yet shown\r\nit a vera causa for physiological species.\r\n\r\nBut I entertain little doubt that a carefully devised system of\r\nexperimentation would produce physiological species by selection--only\r\nthe feat has not been performed yet.\r\n\r\nI hope you received a copy of \"Man's Place in Nature,\" which I desired\r\nshould be sent to you long ago. Don't suppose I ever expect an\r\nacknowledgment of the book--it is one of the greatest nuisances in the\r\nworld to have that to do, and I never do it--but as you mentioned the\r\nLectures and not the other, I thought it might not have reached you. If\r\nit has not, pray let me know and a copy shall be forwarded, as I want\r\nyou very much to read Essay Number 2.\r\n\r\nI have a great respect for all the old bottles, and if the new wine can\r\nbe got to go into them and not burst them I shall be very glad--I\r\nconfess I do not see my way to it; on the contrary, the longer I live\r\nand the more I learn the more hopeless to my mind becomes the\r\ncontradiction between the theory of the universe as understood and\r\nexpounded by Jewish and Christian theologians, and the theory of the\r\nuniverse which is every day and every year growing out of the\r\napplication of scientific methods to its phenomena.\r\n\r\nWhether astronomy and geology can or cannot be made to agree with the\r\nstatements as to the matters of fact laid down in Genesis--whether the\r\nGospels are historically true or not--are matters of comparatively small\r\nmoment in the face of the impassable gulf between the anthropomorphism\r\n(however refined) of theology and the passionless impersonality of the\r\nunknown and unknowable which science shows everywhere underlying the\r\nthin veil of phenomena.\r\n\r\nHere seems to me to be the great gulf fixed between science and\r\ntheology--beside which all Colenso controversies, reconcilements of\r\nScripture a la Pye Smith, etc., cut a very small figure.\r\n\r\nYou must have thought over all this long ago; but steeped as I am in\r\nscientific thought from morning till night, the contrast has perhaps a\r\ngreater vividness to me. I go into society, and except among two or\r\nthree of my scientific colleagues I find myself alone on these subjects,\r\nand as hopelessly at variance with the majority of my fellow-men as they\r\nwould be with their neighbours if they were set down among the\r\nAshantees. I don't like this state of things for myself--least of all do\r\nI see how it will work out for my children. But as my mind is\r\nconstituted, there is no way out of it, and I can only envy you if you\r\ncan see things differently.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, May 5, 1863.\r\n\r\nMy dear Kingsley,\r\n\r\nMy wife and children are away at Felixstow on the Suffolk coast, and as\r\nI run down on Saturday and come back on Monday your MS. has been kept\r\nlonger than it should have been. I am quite agreed with the general\r\ntenor of your argument; and indeed I have often argued against those who\r\nmaintain the intellectual gulf between man and the lower animals to be\r\nan impassable one, by pointing to the immense intellectual chasm as\r\ncompared to the structural differences between two species of bees or\r\nbetween sheep and goat or dog and wolf. So again your remarks upon the\r\nargument drawn from the apparent absence of progression in animals seem\r\nto me to be quite just. You might strengthen them much by reference to\r\nthe absence of progression in many races of men. The West African\r\nsavage, as the old voyagers show, was in just the same condition two\r\nhundred years ago as now--and I suspect that the modern Patagonian is as\r\nnearly as possible the unimproved representative of the makers of the\r\nflint implements of Abbeville.\r\n\r\nLyell's phrase is very good, but it is a simple application of Darwin's\r\nviews to human history. The advance of mankind has everywhere depended\r\non the production of men of genius; and that production is a case of\r\n\"spontaneous variation\" becoming hereditary, not by physical\r\npropagation, but by the help of language, letters and the printing\r\npress. Newton was to all intents and purposes a \"sport\" of a dull\r\nagricultural stock, and his intellectual powers are to a certain extent\r\npropagated by the grafting of the \"Principia,\" his brain-shoot, on us.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your letter. It is a great pleasure to me to be able to\r\nspeak out to any one who, like yourself, is striving to get at truth\r\nthrough a region of intellectual and moral influences so entirely\r\ndistinct from those to which I am exposed.\r\n\r\nI am not much given to open my heart to anybody, and on looking back I\r\nam often astonished at the way in which I threw myself and my troubles\r\nat your head, in those bitter days when my poor boy died. But the way in\r\nwhich you received my heathen letters set up a freemasonry between us,\r\nat any rate on my side; and if they make you a bishop I advise you not\r\nto let your private secretary open any letters with my name in the\r\ncorner, for they are as likely as not to contain matters which will make\r\nthe clerical hair stand on end.\r\n\r\nI am too much a believer in Butler and in the great principle of the\r\n\"Analogy\" that \"there is no absurdity in theology so great that you\r\ncannot parallel it by a greater absurdity of Nature\" (it is not commonly\r\nstated in this way), to have any difficulties about miracles. I have\r\nnever had the least sympathy with the a priori reasons against\r\northodoxy, and I have by nature and disposition the greatest possible\r\nantipathy to all the atheistic and infidel school.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I know that I am, in spite of myself, exactly what the\r\nChristian world call, and, so far as I can see, are justified in\r\ncalling, atheist and infidel. I cannot see one shadow or tittle of\r\nevidence that the great unknown underlying the phenomena of the universe\r\nstands to us in the relation of a Father--loves us and cares for us as\r\nChristianity asserts. On the contrary, the whole teaching of experience\r\nseems to me to show that while the governance (if I may use the term) of\r\nthe universe is rigorously just and substantially kind and beneficent,\r\nthere is no more relation of affection between governor and governed\r\nthan between me and the twelve judges. I know the administrators of the\r\nlaw desire to do their best for everybody, and that they would rather\r\nnot hurt me than otherwise, but I also know that under certain\r\ncircumstances they will most assuredly hang me; and that in any case it\r\nwould be absurd to suppose them guided by any particular affection for\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThis seems to me to be the relation which exists between the cause of\r\nthe phenomena of this universe and myself. I submit to it with implicit\r\nobedience and perfect cheerfulness, and the more because my small\r\nintelligence does not see how any other arrangement could possibly be\r\ngot to work as the world is constituted.\r\n\r\nBut this is what the Christian world calls atheism, and because all my\r\ntoil and pains does not enable me to see my way to any other conclusion\r\nthan this, a Christian judge would (if he knew it) refuse to take my\r\nevidence in a court of justice against that of a Christian\r\nticket-of-leave man.\r\n\r\nSo with regard to the other great Christian dogmas, the immortality of\r\nthe soul, and the future state of rewards and punishments, what possible\r\nobjection a priori can I--who am compelled perforce to believe in the\r\nimmortality of what we call Matter and Force and in a very unmistakable\r\nPRESENT state of rewards and punishments for all our deeds--have to\r\nthese doctrines? Give me a scintilla of evidence, and I am ready to jump\r\nat them.\r\n\r\nBut read Butler, and see to what drivel even his great mind descends\r\nwhen he has to talk about the immortality of the soul! I have never seen\r\nan argument on that subject which from a scientific point of view is\r\nworth the paper it is written upon. All resolve themselves into this\r\nformula:--The doctrine of the immortality of the soul is very pleasant\r\nand very useful, therefore it is true.\r\n\r\nAll the grand language about \"human aspiration,\" \"consistency with the\r\ndivine justice,\" etc., etc., collapses into this at last--Better the\r\nmisery of the \"Vale! in aeternum vale!\" ten times over than the opium of\r\nsuch empty sophisms--I have drunk of that cup to the bottom.\r\n\r\nI am called away and must close my letter. Don't trouble to answer it\r\nunless you are so minded.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, May 22, 1863.\r\n\r\nMy dear Kingsley,\r\n\r\nPray excuse my delay in replying to your letter. I have been very much\r\npressed for time for these two or three days.\r\n\r\nFirst touching the action of the spermatozoon. The best information you\r\ncan find on the subject is, I think, in Newport's papers in the\r\n\"Philosophical Transactions\" for 1851, 1853, and 1854, especially the\r\n1853 paper. Newport treats only of the Frog, but the information he\r\ngives is very full and definite. Allen Thomson's very accurate and\r\nlearned article \"Ovum\" in Todd's \"Cyclopaedia\" is also well worth\r\nlooking through, though unfortunately it is least full just where you\r\nwant most information. In French there is Coste's \"Developpement des\r\nCorps organises\" and the volume on \"Development\" by Bischoff in the\r\nFrench translation of the last edition of Soemmering's \"Anatomy.\"\r\n\r\nSo much for your inquiries as to the matters of fact. Next, as to\r\nquestions of speculation. If any expression of ignorance on my part will\r\nbring us nearer we are likely to come into absolute contact, for the\r\npossibilities of \"may be\" are, to me, infinite.\r\n\r\nI know nothing of Necessity, abominate the word Law (except as meaning\r\nthat we know nothing to the contrary), and am quite ready to admit that\r\nthere may be some place, \"other side of nowhere,\" par exemple, where 2 +\r\n2 = 5, and all bodies naturally repel one another instead of gravitating\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether Matter is anything distinct from Force. I don't\r\nknow that atoms are anything but pure myths. Cogito, ergo sum is to my\r\nmind a ridiculous piece of bad logic, all I can say at any time being\r\n\"Cogito.\" The Latin form I hold to be preferable to the English \"I\r\nthink,\" because the latter asserts the existence of an Ego--about which\r\nthe bundle of phenomena at present addressing you knows nothing. In\r\nfact, if I am pushed, metaphysical speculation lands me exactly where\r\nyour friend Raphael was when his bitch pupped. In other words, I believe\r\nin Hamilton, Mansell and Herbert Spencer so long as they are\r\ndestructive, and I laugh at their beards as soon as they try to spin\r\ntheir own cobwebs.\r\n\r\nIs this basis of ignorance broad enough for you? If you, theologian, can\r\nfind as firm footing as I, man of science, do on this foundation of\r\nminus nought--there will be nought to fear for our ever diverging.\r\n\r\nFor you see I am quite as ready to admit your doctrine that souls\r\nsecrete bodies as I am the opposite one that bodies secrete\r\nsouls--simply because I deny the possibility of obtaining any evidence\r\nas to the truth and falsehood of either hypothesis. My fundamental axiom\r\nof speculative philosophy is that MATERIALISM AND SPIRITUALISM ARE\r\nOPPOSITE POLES OF THE SAME ABSURDITY--the absurdity of imagining that we\r\nknow anything about either spirit or matter.\r\n\r\nCabanis and Berkeley (I speak of them simply as types of schools) are\r\nboth asses, the only difference being that one is a black donkey and the\r\nother a white one.\r\n\r\nThis universe is, I conceive, like to a great game being played out, and\r\nwe poor mortals are allowed to take a hand. By great good fortune the\r\nwiser among us have made out some few of the rules of the game, as at\r\npresent played. We call them \"Laws of Nature,\" and honour them because\r\nwe find that if we obey them we win something for our pains. The cards\r\nare our theories and hypotheses, the tricks our experimental\r\nverifications. But what sane man would endeavour to solve this problem:\r\ngiven the rules of a game and the winnings, to find whether the cards\r\nare made of pasteboard or goldleaf? Yet the problem of the\r\nmetaphysicians is to my mind no saner.\r\n\r\nIf you tell me that an Ape differs from a Man because the latter has a\r\nsoul and the ape has not, I can only say it may be so; but I should\r\nuncommonly like to know how either that the ape has not one or that the\r\nman has.\r\n\r\nAnd until you satisfy me as to the soundness of your method of\r\ninvestigation, I must adhere to what seems to my mind a simpler form of\r\nnotation--i.e. to suppose that all phenomena have the same substratum\r\n(if they have any), and that soul and body, or mental and physical\r\nphenomena, are merely diverse manifestations of that hypothetical\r\nsubstratum. In this way, it seems to me, I obey the rule which works so\r\nwell in practice, of always making the simplest possible suppositions.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you are of a different opinion, and find it more\r\nconvenient to call the x which underlies (hypothetically) mental\r\nphenomena, Soul, and the x which underlies (hypothetically) physical\r\nphenomena, Body, well and good. The two-fluid theory and the one-fluid\r\ntheory of electricity both accounted for the phenomena up to a certain\r\nextent, and both were probably wrong. So it may be with the theories\r\nthat there is only one x in nature or two x's or three x's.\r\n\r\nFor, if you will think upon it, there are only four possible ontological\r\nhypotheses now that Polytheism is dead.\r\n\r\n1. There is no x = Atheism on Berkeleyan principles.\r\n\r\n2. There is only one x = Materialism or Pantheism, according as you turn\r\nit heads or tails.\r\n\r\n3. There are two x's: Spirit and Matter = Speculators incertae sedis.\r\n\r\n4. There are three x's: God, Souls, Matter = Orthodox Theologians.\r\n\r\nTo say that I adopt any one of those hypotheses, as a representation of\r\nfact, would to my mind be absurd; but Number 2 is the one I can work\r\nwith best. To return to my metaphor, it chimes in better with the rules\r\nof the game of nature than any other of the four possibilities, to my\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nBut who knows when the great Banker may sweep away table and cards and\r\nall, and set us learning a new game? What will become of all my poor\r\ncounters then? It may turn out that I am quite wrong, and that there are\r\nno x's or 20 x's.\r\n\r\nI am glad you appreciate the rich absurdities of the new doctrine of\r\nspontogenesis [?]. Against the doctrine of spontaneous generation in the\r\nabstract I have nothing to say. Indeed it is a necessary corollary from\r\nDarwin's views if legitimately carried out, and I think Owen smites him\r\n(Darwin) fairly for taking refuge in \"Pentateuchal\" phraseology when he\r\nought to have done one of two things--(a) give up the problem, (b) admit\r\nthe necessity of spontaneous generation. It is the very passage in\r\nDarwin's book to which, as he knows right well, I have always strongly\r\nobjected. The x of science and the x of genesis are two different x's,\r\nand for any sake don't let us confuse them together. Maurice has sent me\r\nhis book. I have read it, but I find myself utterly at a loss to\r\ncomprehend his point of view.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The following letter is interesting, as showing his continued interest\r\nin the question of skull structure, as well as his relation to his\r\nfriend and fellow-worker, Dr. W.K. Parker.]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, March 18, 1863.\r\n\r\nMy dear Parker,\r\n\r\nAny conclusion that I have reached will seem to me all the better based\r\nfor knowing that you have been near or at it, and I am therefore right\r\nglad to have your letter. If I had only time, nothing would delight me\r\nmore than to go over your preparations, but these Hunterian Lectures are\r\nabout the hardest bit of work I ever took in hand, and I am obliged to\r\ngive every minute to them.\r\n\r\nBy and by I will gladly go with you over your vast material.\r\n\r\nDid you not some time ago tell me that you considered the Y-shaped bone\r\n(so-called presphenoid) in the Pike to be the true basisphenoid? If so,\r\nlet me know before lecture to-morrow, that I may not commit theft\r\nunawares.\r\n\r\nI have arrived at that conclusion myself from the anatomical relations\r\nof the bone in question to the brain and nerves.\r\n\r\nI look upon the proposition opisthotis = turtle's \"occipital externe\" =\r\nPerch's Rocher (Cuvier) as the one thing needful to clear up the unity\r\nof structure of the bony cranium; and it shall be counted unto me as a\r\ngreat sin if I have helped to keep you back from it. The thing has been\r\ndawning upon me ever since I read Kolliker's book two summers ago, but I\r\nhave never had time to work it out.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The following extracts from a letter to Hooker and a letter to Darwin\r\ndescribe the pressure of his work at this time.]\r\n\r\n1863.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\n...I would willingly send a paper to the Linnean this year if I could,\r\nbut I do not see how it is practicable. I lecture five times a week from\r\nnow till the middle of February. I then have to give eighteen lectures\r\nat the College of Surgeons--six on classification, and twelve on the\r\nvertebrate skeleton. I might write a paper on this new Glyptodon, with\r\nsome eighteen to twenty plates. A preliminary notice has already gone to\r\nthe Royal Society. I have a decade of fossil fish in progress; a fellow\r\nin the country WILL keep on sending me splendid new Labyrinthodonts from\r\nthe coal, and that d--d manual must come out.\r\n\r\nAyez pitie de moi.\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, July 2, 1863.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nI am horribly loth to say that I cannot do anything you want done; and\r\npartly for that reason and partly because we have been very busy here\r\nwith some new arrangements during the last day or two, I did not at once\r\nreply to your note.\r\n\r\nI am afraid, however, I cannot undertake any sort of new work. In spite\r\nof working like a horse (or if you prefer it, like an ass), I find\r\nmyself scandalously in arrear, and I shall get into terrible hot water\r\nif I do not clear off some things that have been hanging about me for\r\nmonths and years.\r\n\r\nIf you will send me up the specimens, however, I will ask Flower (whom I\r\nsee constantly) to examine them for you. The examination will be no\r\ngreat trouble, and I am ashamed to make a fuss about it, but I have\r\nsworn a big oath to take no fresh work, great or small, until certain\r\nthings are done.\r\n\r\nI wake up in the morning with somebody saying in my ear, \"A is not done,\r\nand B is not done, and C is not done, and D is not done,\" etc., and a\r\nfeeling like a fellow whose duns are all in the street waiting for him.\r\nBy the way, you ask me what I am doing now, so I will just enumerate\r\nsome of the A, B, and C's aforesaid.\r\n\r\n   A. Editing lectures on Vertebrate skull and bringing them out in the\r\n      \"Medical Times.\"\r\n\r\nB. Editing and re-writing lectures on Elementary Physiology, just\r\ndelivered here and reported as I went along. ([Delivered on Friday\r\nevenings from April to June at Jermyn Street, and reported in the\r\n\"Medical Times.\" They formed the basis of his well-known little book on\r\n\"Elementary Physiology,\" published 1866. He writes on April 22:--]\r\n\"Macmillan has just been with me, and I am let in for a school book on\r\nphysiology based on these lectures of mine. Money arrangements not quite\r\nfixed yet, but he is a good fellow, and will not do me unnecessarily.\")\r\n\r\nC. Thinking of my course of twenty-four lectures on the Mammalia at the\r\nCollege of Surgeons in next spring, and making investigations bearing on\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nD. Thinking of and working at a \"Manual of Comparative Anatomy\" (may it\r\nbe d--d); which I have had in hand these seven years.\r\n\r\nE. Getting heaps of remains of new Labyrinthodonts from the Glasgow\r\ncoalfield, which have to be described.\r\n\r\nF. Working at a memoir on Glyptodon based on a new and almost entire\r\nspecimen at the College of Surgeons.\r\n\r\nG. Preparing a new decade upon Fossil fishes for this place.\r\n\r\nH. Knowing that I ought to have written long ago a description of a most\r\ninteresting lot of Indian fossils sent to me by Oldham.\r\n\r\nI. Being blown up by Hooker for doing nothing for the \"Natural History\r\nReview.\"\r\n\r\nK. Being bothered by sundry editors just to write articles \"which you\r\nknow you can knock off in a moment.\"\r\n\r\nL. Consciousness of having left unwritten letters which ought to have\r\nbeen written long ago, especially to C. Darwin.\r\n\r\nM. General worry and botheration.

I hear it is republished in America, but I suppose I\r\nshall get nothing out of it. [In this expectation, however, he was\r\nagreeably disappointed by the action of D. Appleton and Company.\r\n\r\nAn undated letter to Kingsley, who had suggested that he should write an\r\narticle on Prayer, belongs probably to the autumn of 1863:--]\r\n\r\nI should like very much to write such an article as you suggest, but I\r\nam very doubtful about undertaking it for \"Fraser.\" Anything I could say\r\nwould go to the root of praying altogether, for inasmuch as the whole\r\nuniverse is governed, so far as I can see, in the same way, and the\r\nmoral world is as much governed by laws as the physical--whatever\r\nmilitates against asking for one sort of blessing seems to me to tell\r\nwith the same force against asking for any other.\r\n\r\nNot that I mean for a moment to say that prayer is illogical, for if the\r\nwhole universe is ruled by fixed laws it is just as logically absurd for\r\nme to ask you to answer this letter as to ask the Almighty to alter the\r\nweather. The whole argument is an \"old foe with a new face,\" the freedom\r\nand necessity question over again.\r\n\r\nIf I were to write about the question I should have to develop all this\r\nside of the problem, and then having shown that logic, as always happens\r\nwhen it is carried to extremes, leaves us bombinantes in vacuo, I should\r\nappeal to experience to show that prayers of this sort are not answered,\r\nand to science to prove that if they were they would do a great deal of\r\nharm.\r\n\r\nBut you know this would never do for the atmosphere of \"Fraser.\" It\r\nwould be much better suited for an article in my favourite organ, the\r\nwicked \"Westminster.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, to say truth, I do not see how I am to undertake anything fresh\r\njust at present. I have promised an article for \"Macmillan\" ages ago;\r\nand Masson scowls at me whenever we meet. I am afraid to go through the\r\nAlbany lest Cook should demand certain reviews of books which have been\r\nlong in my hands. I am just completing a long memoir for the Linnean\r\nSociety; a monograph on certain fossil reptiles must be finished before\r\nthe new year. My lectures have begun, and there is a certain \"Manual\"\r\nlooming in the background. And to crown all, these late events [the\r\ndeath of his brother] have given me such a wrench that I feel I must be\r\nprudent.\r\n\r\n[The following reference to Robert Lowe, afterwards Lord Sherbrooke, has\r\na quasi-prophetic interest:--]\r\n\r\nMay 7.\r\n\r\nDined at the Smiths' last night. [Dr. (afterwards Sir William) Smith, of\r\ndictionary fame.] Lowe was to have been there, but had a dinner-party of\r\nhis own...I have come to the conviction that our friend Bob is a most\r\nadmirable, well-judging statesman, for he says I am the only man fit to\r\nbe at the head of the British Museum [i.e. of the Natural History\r\nCollections.], and that if he had his way he would put me there.\r\n\r\n[Years afterwards, on Sir R. Owen's retirement, he was offered the post,\r\nbut declined it, as he greatly disliked the kind of work. At the same\r\ntime, he pointed out to the Minister who made the offer that the man of\r\nall others for the post would be the late distinguished holder of it,\r\nSir W.H. Flower, a suggestion happily acted on.\r\n\r\nEarly in August a severe loss befell him in the sudden death of his\r\nbrother George, who had been his close friend ever since he had returned\r\nfrom Australia, who had given him all the help and sympathy in his\r\nstruggles that could be given by a man of the world without special\r\ninterests in science or literature. With brilliancy enough to have won\r\nsuccess if he had had patience to ensure it, he was not only a pleasant\r\ncompanion, a \"clubbable man\" in Johnson's phrase, but a friend to trust.\r\nThe two households had seen much of one another; the childless couple\r\nregarded their brother's children almost as their own. Thus a real gap\r\nwas made in the family circle, and the trouble was not lessened by the\r\nfact that George Huxley's affairs were left in great confusion, and his\r\nbrother not only spent a great deal of time in looking after the\r\ninterests of the widow, but took upon himself certain obligations in\r\norder to make things straight, with the result that he was even\r\ncompelled to part with his Royal Medal, the gold of which was worth 50\r\npounds sterling.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.18.\r\n\r\n1864.\r\n\r\n[The year 1864 was much like 1863. The Hunterian Lectures were still\r\npart of his regular work. The Fishery Commission claimed a large portion\r\nof his time. from March 28 to April 2 he was in Cornwall; on May 7 at\r\nShoreham; from July 24 to September 9 visiting the coasts of Scotland\r\nand Ireland. The same pressure of work continued. He published four\r\npapers on paleontological or anatomical subjects in the \"Natural History\r\nReview\" (On \"Cetacean Fossils termed Ziphius by Cuvier,\" in the\r\n\"Transactions of the Geological Society\"; in those of the \"Zoological,\"\r\npapers on \"Arctocebus Calabarensis\" and \"The Structure of the Stomach in\r\nDesmodus Rufus\"; and on the \"Osteology of the Genus Glyptodon,\" in the\r\n\"Philosophical Transactions.\"), he wrote \"Further Remarks upon the Human\r\nRemains from the Neanderthal,\" and later, dealing with \"Criticisms on\r\nthe 'Origin of Species'\" (\"Collected Essays\" 2 page 80 \"Darwiniana\"), he\r\ngently but firmly dispersed several misconceptions of his old friend\r\nKolliker as to the plain meaning of the book; and ridiculed the\r\npretentious ignorance of M. Flourens' dicta upon the same subject; while\r\nin the winter he delivered a course of lectures to working men on \"The\r\nVarious Races of Mankind,\" a choice of subject which shows that his\r\nchief interest at that time lay in Ethnology.]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, January 16, 1864.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nI have had no news of you for a long time, but I earnestly hope you are\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nHave you any objection to putting your name to Flower's certificate for\r\nthe Royal Society herewith inclosed? It will please him much if you\r\nwill; and I go bail for his being a thoroughly good man in all senses of\r\nthe word--which, as you know, is more than I would say for everybody.\r\n\r\nDon't write any reply; but Mrs. Darwin perhaps will do me the kindness\r\nto send the thing on to Lyell as per enclosed envelope. I will write him\r\na note about it.\r\n\r\nWe are all well, barring customary colds and various forms of infantile\r\npip. As for myself, I am flourishing like a green bay tree (appropriate\r\ncomparison, Soapy Sam would observe), in consequence of having utterly\r\nrenounced societies and society since October.\r\n\r\nI have been working like a horse, however, and shall work \"horser\" as my\r\ncollege lectures begin in February.\r\n\r\nTout a vous,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nRoyal School of Mines, Jermyn Street, April 18, 1864.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nI was rejoiced to see your handwriting again, so much so that I shall\r\nnot scold you for undertaking the needless exertion (as it's my duty to\r\ndo) of writing to thank me for my book. [Hunterian Lectures on Anatomy.]\r\n\r\nI thought the last lecture would be nuts for you, but it is really\r\nshocking. There is not the smallest question that Owen wrote both the\r\narticle \"Oken\" and the \"Archetype Book,\" which appeared in its second\r\nedition in French--why, I know not. I think that if you will look at\r\nwhat I say again, there will not be much doubt left in your mind as to\r\nthe identity of the writer of the two.\r\n\r\nThe news you give of yourself is most encouraging; but pray don't think\r\nof doing any work again yet. Careful as I have been during this last\r\nwinter not to burn the candle at both ends, I have found myself, since\r\nthe pressure of my lectures ceased, in considerable need of quiet, and I\r\nhave been lazy accordingly.\r\n\r\nI don't know that I fear, with you, caring too much for science--for\r\nthere are lots of other things I should like to go into as well, but I\r\ndo lament more and more as time goes on, the necessity of becoming more\r\nand more absorbed in one kind of work, a necessity which is created for\r\nany one in my position, partly by one's reputation, and partly by one's\r\nchildren. For directly a man gets the smallest repute in any branch of\r\nscience, the world immediately credits him with knowing about ten times\r\nas much as he really does, and he becomes bound in common honesty to do\r\nhis best to climb up to his reputed place. And then the babies are a\r\ndevouring fire, eating up the present and discounting the future; they\r\nare sure to want all the money one can earn, and to be the better for\r\nall the credit one can win.\r\n\r\nHowever, I should fare badly without the young monkeys. Your pet Marian\r\nis almost as shy as ever, though she has left off saying \"can't,\" by the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nMy wife is wonderfully well. As I tell her, Providence has appointed her\r\nto take care of me when I am broken down and decrepit.\r\n\r\nI hope you can say as much of Mrs. Darwin. Pray give her my kind\r\nregards.\r\n\r\nAnd believe me, ever yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[A letter to his sister gives a sketch of his position at this time,\r\nspeaking of which he says to Dr. (afterwards Sir J.) Fayrer,] \"You and I\r\nhave travelled a long way, in all senses, since you settled my career\r\nfor me on the steps of the Charing Cross Hospital.\" [It must be\r\nremembered that his sister was living in Tennessee, and that her son at\r\nfifteen was serving in the Confederate army.]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, May 4, 1864.\r\n\r\nYou will want to know something about my progress in the world. Well, at\r\nthis moment I am Professor of Natural History here, and Hunterian\r\nProfessor of Comparative Anatomy at the College of Surgeons. The former\r\nis the appointment I have held since 1855; the latter chair I was asked\r\nto take last year, and now I have delivered two courses in that famous\r\nblack gown with the red facings which the doctor will recollect very\r\nwell. What with the duties of these two posts and other official and\r\nnon-official business, I am worked to the full stretch of my powers, and\r\nsometimes a little beyond them; though hitherto I have stood the wear\r\nand tear very well.\r\n\r\nI believe I have won myself a pretty fair place in science, but in\r\naddition to that I have the reputation (of which, I fear, you will not\r\napprove) of being a great heretic and a savage controversialist always\r\nin rows. To the accusation of heresy I fear I must plead guilty; but the\r\nsecond charge proceeds only, I do assure you, from a certain\r\nunconquerable hatred of lies and humbug which I cannot get over.\r\n\r\nI have read all you tell me about the south with much interest and with\r\nthe warmest sympathy, so far as the fate of the south affects you. But I\r\nam in the condition of most thoughtful Englishmen. My heart goes with\r\nthe south, and my head with the north.\r\n\r\nI have no love for the Yankees, and I delight in the energy and\r\nself-sacrifice of your people; but for all that, I cannot doubt that\r\nwhether you beat the Yankees or not, you are struggling to uphold a\r\nsystem which must, sooner or later, break down.\r\n\r\nI have not the smallest sentimental sympathy with the negro; don't\r\nbelieve in him at all, in short. But it is clear to me that slavery\r\nmeans, for the white man, bad political economy; bad social morality;\r\nbad internal political organisation, and a bad influence upon free\r\nlabour and freedom all over the world. For the sake of the white man,\r\ntherefore, for your children and grandchildren, directly, and for mine,\r\nindirectly, I wish to see this system ended. [Cf. \"Reader,\" February 27\r\nonwards, where these general arguments against slavery appear in a\r\ncontroversy arising from his ninth Hunterian Lecture, in which, while\r\nadmitting negro inferiority, he refutes those who justify slavery on the\r\nground that physiologically the negro is very low in the scale.] Would\r\nthat the south had had the wisdom to initiate that end without this\r\nmiserable war!\r\n\r\nAll this must jar upon you sadly, and I grieve that it does so; but I\r\ncould not pretend to be other than I am, even to please you. Let us\r\nagree to differ upon this point. If I were in your place I doubt not I\r\nshould feel as you do; and, when I think of you, I put myself in your\r\nplace and feel with you as your brother Tom. The learned gentleman who\r\nhas public opinions for which he is responsible is another \"party\" who\r\nwalks about in T's clothes when he is not thinking of his sister.\r\n\r\nIf this were not my birthday I should not feel justified in taking a\r\nmorning's holiday to write this long letter to you. The ghosts of undone\r\npieces of work are dancing about me, and I must come to an end.\r\n\r\nGive my love to your husband. I am glad to hear he wears so well. And\r\ndon't forget to give your children kindly thoughts of their uncle. Dr.\r\nWright gives a great account of my namesake, and says he is the\r\nhandsomest youngster in the Southern States. That comes of his being\r\nnamed after me, you know how renowned for personal beauty I always was.\r\n\r\nI asked Dr. Wright if you had taken to spectacles, and he seemed to\r\nthink not. I had a pain about my eyes a few months ago, but I found\r\nspectacles made this rather worse and left them off again. However, I do\r\ncatch myself holding a newspaper further off than I used to do.\r\n\r\nNow don't let six months go by without writing again. If our little\r\nventure succeeds this time, we shall send again. [I.e. a package of\r\nvarious presents to the family.] Ever, my dearest Lizzie, your\r\naffectionate brother,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[He writes to his wife, who had taken the children to Margate:--]\r\n\r\nSeptember 22.\r\n\r\nI am now busy over a paper for the Zoological Society; after that there\r\nis one for the Ethnological which was read last session though not\r\nwritten...Don't blaspheme about going into the bye-ways. They are both\r\nin the direct road of the book, only over the hills instead of going\r\nover the beaten path.\r\n\r\nOctober 6.\r\n\r\nI heard from Darwin last night jubilating over an article of mine which\r\nis published in the last number of the \"Natural History Review,\" and\r\nwhich he is immensely pleased with...My lectures tire me, from want of\r\npractice, I suppose. I shall soon get into swing.\r\n\r\n[The article in question was the \"Criticisms of the 'Origin of Species'\"\r\nof which he writes to Darwin:--]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, October 5, 1864.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nI am very glad to see your handwriting (in ink) again, and none the less\r\non account of the pretty words into which it was shaped.\r\n\r\nIt is a great pleasure to me that you like the article, for it was\r\nwritten very hurriedly, and I did not feel sure when I had done that I\r\nhad always rightly represented your views.\r\n\r\nHang the two scalps up in your wigwam!\r\n\r\nFlourens I could have believed anything of, but how a man of Kolliker's\r\nreal intelligence and ability could have so misunderstood the question\r\nis more than I can comprehend.\r\n\r\nIt will be a thousand pities, however, if any review interferes with\r\nyour saying something on the subject yourself. Unless it should give you\r\nneedless work I heartily wish you would.\r\n\r\nEverybody tells me I am looking so exceedingly well that I am ashamed to\r\nsay a word to the contrary. But the fact is, I get no exercise, and a\r\ngreat deal of bothering work on our Commission's Cruise; and though much\r\nfatter (indeed a regular bloater myself), I am not up to the mark. Next\r\nyear I will have a real holiday. [At the end of the year, as so often,\r\nhe went off for a ploy with Tyndall, this time into Derbyshire, walking\r\nvigorously over the moors.]\r\n\r\nI am a bachelor, my wife and belongings being all at that beautiful\r\nplace, Margate. When I came back I found them all looking so seedy that\r\nI took them off bag and baggage to that, as the handiest place, before a\r\nweek was over. They are wonderfully improved already, my wife especially\r\nbeing abundantly provided with her favourite east wind. Your godson is\r\ngrowing a very sturdy fellow, and I begin to puzzle my head with\r\nthinking what he is and what he is not to be taught.\r\n\r\nPlease to remember me very kindly to Mrs. Darwin, and believe me, yours\r\nvery faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The following illustrates the value he set upon public examinations as\r\nto a practical means for spreading scientific education, and upon\r\nfirst-rate examiners as a safeguard of proper methods of teaching.]\r\n\r\nOctober 6, 1864.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nDonnelly told me to-day that you had been applied to by the Science and\r\nTarts Department to examine for them in botany, and that you had\r\ndeclined.\r\n\r\nWill you reconsider the matter? I have always taken a very great\r\ninterest in the science examinations, looking upon them, as I do, as the\r\nmost important engine for forcing science into ordinary education.\r\n\r\nThe English nation will not take science from above, so it must get it\r\nfrom below.\r\n\r\nHaving known these examinations from the beginning, I can assure you\r\nthat they are very genuine things, and are working excellently. And what\r\nI have regretted from the first is that the botanical business was not\r\ntaken in hand by you, instead of by --.\r\n\r\nNow, like a good fellow, think better of it. The papers are necessarily\r\nvery simple, and one of Oliver's pupils could look them over for you.\r\nLet us have your co-operation and the advantage of that reputation for\r\nhonesty and earnestness which you have contrived (Heaven knows how) to\r\nget.\r\n\r\nI have come back fat and seedy for want of exercise. All my belongings\r\nare at Margate. Hope you don't think my review of Darwin's critics too\r\nheretical if you have seen it.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nWhen is our plan for getting some kind of meeting during the winter to\r\nbe organised?\r\n\r\n[The next two letters refer to the award of the Copley Medal to Mr.\r\nDarwin. Huxley was exceedingly indignant at an attempt on the part of\r\nthe president to discredit the \"Origin\" by a side wind:--]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, November 4, 1864.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nI write two lines which are NOT TO BE ANSWERED, just as to say how\r\ndelighted I am at the result of the doings of the Council of the Royal\r\nSociety yesterday. Many of us were somewhat doubtful of the result, and\r\nthe more ferocious sort had begun to whet their beaks and sharpen their\r\nclaws in preparation for taking a very decided course of action had\r\nthere been any failure of justice this time. But the affair was settled\r\nby a splendid majority, and our ruffled feathers are smoothed down.\r\n\r\nYour well-won reputation would not have been lessened by the lack of the\r\nCopley, but it would have been an indelible reproach to the Royal\r\nSociety not to have given it to you, and a good many of us had no notion\r\nof being made to share that ignominy.\r\n\r\nBut quite apart from all these grand public-spirited motives and their\r\nresults, you ought as a philanthropist to be rejoiced in the great\r\nsatisfaction the award has given to your troops of friends, to none more\r\nthan my wife (whom I woke up to tell the news when I got home late last\r\nnight).\r\n\r\nYours ever,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nPlease remember us kindly to Mrs. Darwin, and make our congratulations\r\nto her on owning a Copley medallist.\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, December 3, 1864.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI wish you had been at the Anniversary Meeting and Dinner, because the\r\nlatter was very pleasant, and the former, to me, very disagreeable. My\r\ndistrust of Sabine is as you know chronic, and I went determined to keep\r\ncareful watch on his address, lest some crafty phrase injurious to\r\nDarwin should be introduced. My suspicious were justified. The only part\r\nof the address to Darwin written by Sabine himself contained the\r\nfollowing passage:--\r\n\r\n\"Speaking generally and collectively, we have expressly omitted it\r\n(Darwin's theory) from the grounds of our award.\"\r\n\r\nOf course this would be interpreted by everybody as meaning that, after\r\ndue discussion, the council had formally resolved not only to exclude\r\nDarwin's theory from the grounds of the award, but to give public notice\r\nthrough the president that they had done so, and furthermore, that\r\nDarwin's friends had been base enough to accept an honour for him on the\r\nunderstanding that in receiving it he should be publicly insulted!\r\n\r\nI felt that this would never do, and therefore when the resolution for\r\nprinting the address was moved, I made a speech which I took care to\r\nkeep perfectly cool and temperate, disavowing all intention of\r\ninterfering with the liberty of the president to say what he pleased,\r\nbut exercising my constitutional right of requiring the minutes of\r\ncouncil making the award to be read, in order that the Society might be\r\ninformed whether the conditions implied by Sabine had been imposed or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nThe resolution was read, and of course nothing of the kind appeared.\r\nSabine didn't exactly like it, I believe. Both Busk and Falconer\r\nremonstrated against the passage to him, and I hope it will be withdrawn\r\nwhen the address is printed. [The passage stands in the published\r\naddress, but followed by another passage which softens it down.]\r\n\r\nIf not there will be an awful row, and I for one will show no mercy.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The foundation of the x Club towards the earth 1864 was a notable event\r\nfor Huxley and his circle of scientific friends. It was growing more and\r\nmore difficult for them to see one another except now and again at\r\nmeetings of the learned societies, and even that was quite uncertain.\r\nThe pressure of Huxley's own work may be inferred from his letters at\r\nthis time (especially to Darwin, July 2, 1863, and January 16, 1864).\r\nNot only society, but societies had to be almost entirely given up.\r\nMoreover, the distance from one another at which some of these friends\r\nlived, added another difficulty, so that Huxley writes to Hooker in his]\r\n\"remote province\" [of Kew:] \"I wonder if we are ever to meet again in\r\nthis world.\" [Accordingly in January 1864, Hooker gladly embraced a\r\nproposal of Huxley's to organise some kind of regular meeting, a\r\nproposal which bore fruit in the establishment of the x Club. On\r\nNovember 3, 1864, the first meeting was held at St. George's Hotel,\r\nAlbemarle Street, where they resolved to dine regularly \"except when\r\nBenham cannot have us, in which case dine at the Athenaeum.\" In the\r\nlatter eighties, however, the Athenaeum became the regular place of\r\nmeeting, and it was here that the \"coming of age\" of the club was\r\ncelebrated in 1885.\r\n\r\nEight members met at the first meeting; the second meeting brought their\r\nnumbers up to nine by the addition of W. Spottiswoode, but the proposal\r\nto elect a tenth member was never carried out. On the principle of lucus\r\na non lucendo, this lent an additional appropriateness to the symbol x,\r\nthe origin of which Huxley thus describes in his reminiscences of\r\nTyndall in the \"Nineteenth Century\" for January 1894:--]\r\n\r\nAt starting, our minds were terribly exercised over the name and\r\nconstitution of our society. As opinions on this grave matter were no\r\nless numerous than the members--indeed more so--we finally accepted the\r\nhappy suggestion of our mathematicians to call it the x Club; and the\r\nproposal of some genius among us, that we should have no rules, save the\r\nunwritten law not to have any, was carried by acclamation.\r\n\r\n[Besides Huxley, the members of the club were as follows:--\r\n\r\nGeorge Busk, F.R.S. (1807-87), then secretary of the Linnean Society, a\r\nskilful anatomist. (He served as surgeon to the hospital ship\r\n\"Dreadnought\" at Greenwich till 1856, when he resigned and, retiring\r\nfrom practice, devoted himself to scientific pursuits, and was elected\r\nPresident of the College of Surgeons in 1871.)\r\n\r\nEdward Frankland (1825-1899), Foreign Secretary R.S., K.C.B., then\r\nProfessor of Chemistry in the Royal Institution, and afterwards at the\r\nRoyal College of Science.\r\n\r\nThomas Archer Hirst, F.R.S., then mathematical master at University\r\nCollege School. (In 1865 appointed Professor of Physics; in 1867, of\r\nPure Mathematics, at University College, London; and from 1873 to 1883\r\nDirector of Naval Studies at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich; an old\r\nMarburg student, and intimate friend of Tyndall, whom he had succeeded\r\nat Queenwood College in 1853. He died in 1892.)\r\n\r\nJoseph Dalton Hooker, F.R.S., K.C.S.I., President of the Royal Society\r\n1873, the great botanist, then Assistant Director at Kew Gardens to his\r\nfather, Sir William Hooker.\r\n\r\nSir John Lubbock, Bart., F.R.S., M.P., the youngest of the nine, who had\r\nalready made his mark in archeology, and was then preparing to bring out\r\nhis \"Prehistoric Times.\"\r\n\r\nHerbert Spencer, who had already published \"Social Statics,\" \"Principles\r\nof Psychology,\" and \"First Principles.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Spottiswoode (1825-1883), F.R.S., Treasurer and afterwards\r\nPresident of the Royal Society 1878, who carried on the business of the\r\nQueen's printer as well as being deeply versed in mathematics,\r\nphilosophy, and languages.\r\n\r\nJohn Tyndall, F.R.S., (1820-1893), who had been for the last eleven\r\nyears Professor of Natural Philosophy at the Royal Institution, where he\r\nsucceeded Faraday as superintendent.\r\n\r\nThe one object, then, of the club was to afford a certain meeting-ground\r\nfor a few friends who were bound together by personal regard and\r\ncommunity of scientific interests, yet were in danger of drifting apart\r\nunder the stress of circumstances. They dined together on the first\r\nThursday in each month, except July, August, and September, before the\r\nmeeting of the Royal Society, of which all were members excepting Mr.\r\nSpencer, the usual dining hour being six, so that they should be in good\r\ntime for the society's meeting at eight; and a minute of December 5,\r\n1885, when Huxley was treasurer and revived the ancient custom of making\r\nsome note of the conversation, throws light on the habits of the club.\r\n\"Got scolded,\" he writes, \"for dining at 6.30. Had to prove we have\r\ndined at 6.30 for a long time by evidence of waiter.\" (At the February\r\nmeeting, however, \"agreed to fix dinner hour six hereafter.\") \"Talked\r\npolitics, scandal, and the three classes of witnesses--liars, d--d\r\nliars, and experts. Huxley gave account of civil list pension. Sat to\r\nthe unexampled hour of 10 p.m., except Lubbock who had to go to\r\nLinnean.\"\r\n\r\nFor some time there was a summer meeting, which consisted of a week-end\r\nexcursion of members and their wives (x's + yv's, as the correct formula\r\nran) to some place like Burnham or Maidenhead, Oxford or Windsor; but\r\nthis grew increasingly difficult to arrange, and dropped before very\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nGuests were not excluded from the dinners of the club; men of science or\r\nletters of almost every nationality dined with the x at one time or\r\nanother; Darwin, W.K. Clifford, Colenso, Strachey, Tollemache, Helps;\r\nProfessors Bain, Masson, Robertson Smith, and Bentham the botanist, Mr.\r\nJohn Morley, Sir D. Galton, Mr. Jodrell, the founder of several\r\nscientific lectureships; Dr. Klein; the Americans Marsh, Gilman, A.\r\nAgassiz, and Youmans, the latter of whom met here several of the\r\ncontributors to the \"International Science Series\" organised by him; and\r\ncontinental representatives, as Helmholtz, Laugel, and Cornu.\r\n\r\nSmall as the club was, the members of it were destined to play a\r\nconsiderable part in the history of English science. Five of them\r\nreceived the Royal Medal; three the Copley; one the Rumford, six were\r\nPresidents of the British Association; three Associates of the Institute\r\nof France; and from amongst them the Royal Society chose a Secretary, a\r\nForeign Secretary, a Treasurer, and three successive Presidents.]\r\n\r\nI think, originally [writes Huxley, l.c.] there was some vague notion of\r\nassociating representatives of each branch of science; at any rate, the\r\nnine who eventually came together could have managed, among us, to\r\ncontribute most of the articles to a scientific Encyclopaedia.\r\n\r\n[They included leading representatives of half a dozen branches of\r\nscience:--mathematics, physics, philosophy, chemistry, botany, and\r\nbiology; and all were animated by similar ideas of the high function of\r\nscience, and of the great Society which should be the chief\r\nrepresentative of science in this country. However unnecessary, it was\r\nperhaps not unnatural that a certain jealousy of the club and its\r\npossible influence grew up in some quarters. But whatever influence fell\r\nto it as it were incidentally--and earnest men with such opportunities\r\nof mutual understanding and such ideals of action could not fail to have\r\nsome influence on the progress of scientific organisation--it was\r\nassuredly not sectarian nor exerted for party purposes during the\r\ntwenty-eight years of the club's existence.]\r\n\r\nI believe that the x [continues Huxley] had the credit of being a sort\r\nof scientific caucus, or ring, with some people. In fact, two\r\ndistinguished scientific colleagues of mine once carried on a\r\nconversation (which I gravely ignored) across me, in the smoking-room of\r\nthe Athenaeum, to this effect, \"I say, A., do you know anything about\r\nthe x Club?\" \"Oh, yes, B., I have heard of it. What do they do?\" \"Well,\r\nthey govern scientific affairs, and really, on the whole, they don't do\r\nit badly.\" If my good friends could only have been present at a few of\r\nour meetings, they would have formed a much less exalted idea of us, and\r\nwould, I fear, have been much shocked at the sadly frivolous tone of our\r\nordinary conversation.\r\n\r\n[The x club is probably unique in the smallness of its numbers, the\r\nintellectual eminence of its members, and the length of its unchanged\r\nexistence. The nearest parallel is to be found in \"The Club.\" (Of which\r\nHuxley was elected a member in 1884. Tyndall and Hooker were also\r\nmembers.) Like the x, \"The Club\" began with eight members at its first\r\nmeeting, and of the original members Johnson lived twenty years,\r\nReynolds twenty-eight, Burke thirty-three, and Bennet Langton\r\nthirty-seven. But the ranks were earlier broken. Within ten years\r\nGoldsmith died, and he was followed in a twelvemonth by Nugent, and five\r\nyears later by Beauclerk and Chamier. Moreover, the eight were soon\r\nincreased to twelve; then to twenty and finally to forty, while the gaps\r\nwere filled up as they occurred.\r\n\r\nIn the x, on the contrary, nearly nineteen years passed before the\r\noriginal circle was broken by the death of Spottiswoode. From 1864 to\r\nSpottiswoode's death in 1883 the original circle remained unbroken; the\r\nmeetings \"were steadily continued for some twenty years, before our\r\nranks began to thin; and one by one, geistige Naturen such as those for\r\nwhich the poet so willingly paid the ferryman, silent but not\r\nunregarded, took the vacated places.\"\r\n\r\n  (Nimm dann Fuhrmann,\r\n  Nimm die Miethe\r\n  Die Ich gerne dreifach biete;\r\n  Zwei, die eben uberfuhren\r\n  Waren geistige Naturen.)\r\n\r\nThe peculiar constitution of the club scarcely seemed to admit of new\r\nmembers; not, at all events, without altering the unique relation of\r\nfriendship joined to common experience of struggle and success which had\r\nlasted so long. After the death of Spottiswoode and Busk, and the\r\nill-health of other members, the election of new members was indeed\r\nmooted, but the proposal was ultimately negatived. Huxley's opinion on\r\nthis point appears from letters to Sir E. Frankland in 1886 and to Sir\r\nJ.D. Hooker in 1888.]\r\n\r\nAs for the filling up the vacancies in the x, I am disposed to take\r\nTyndall's view of the matter. Our little club had no very definite\r\nobject beyond preventing a few men who were united by strong personal\r\nsympathies from drifting apart by the pressure of busy lives.\r\n\r\nNobody could have foreseen or expected twenty odd years ago when we\r\nfirst met, that we were destined to play the parts we have since played,\r\nand it is in the nature of things impossible that any of the new members\r\nproposed (much as we may like and respect them all), can carry on the\r\nwork which has so strangely fallen to us.\r\n\r\nAn axe with a new head and a new handle may be the same axe in one\r\nsense, but it is not the familiar friend with which one has cut one's\r\nway through wood and brier.\r\n\r\n[And in the other letter:--]\r\n\r\nWhat with the lame dog condition of Tyndall and Hirst and Spencer and my\r\nown recurrent illnesses, the x is not satisfactory. But I don't see that\r\nmuch will come from putting new patches in. The x really has no raison\r\nd'etre beyond the personal attachment of its original members. Frankland\r\ntold me of the names that had been mentioned, and none could be more\r\npersonally welcome to me...but somehow or other they seem out of place\r\nin the x.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am not going to stand out against the general wish, and I\r\nshall agree to anything that is desired.\r\n\r\n[Again:--]\r\n\r\nThe club has never had any purpose except the purely personal object of\r\nbringing together a few friends who did not want to drift apart. It has\r\nhappened that these cronies had developed into big-wigs of various\r\nkinds, and therefore the club has incidentally--I might say\r\naccidentally--had a good deal of influence in the scientific world. But\r\nif I had to propose to a man to join, and he were to say, Well, what is\r\nyour object? I should have to reply like the needy knife-grinder,\r\n\"Object, God bless you, sir, we've none to show.\"\r\n\r\n[As he wrote elsewhere (loc. cit.):--]\r\n\r\nLater on, there were attempts to add other members, which at last became\r\nwearisome, and had to be arrested by the agreement that no proposition\r\nof that kind should be entertained, unless the name of the new may be\r\nsuggested contained all the consonants absent from the names of the old\r\nones. In the lack of Slavonic friends this decision put an end to the\r\npossibility of increase.\r\n\r\n[After the death, in February 1892, of Hirst, a most devoted supporter\r\nof the club, who \"would, I believe, represent it in his sole person\r\nrather than pass the day over,\" only one more meeting took place, in the\r\nfollowing month. With five of the six survivors domiciled far from town,\r\nmeeting after meeting fell through, until the treasurer wrote, \"My idea\r\nis that it is best to let it die out unobserved, and say nothing about\r\nits decease to anyone.\"\r\n\r\nThus it came to pass that the March meeting of the club in 1893 remained\r\nits last. No ceremony ushered it out of existence. Its end exemplified a\r\nsaying of Sir J. Hooker's \"At our ages clubs are an anachronism.\" It had\r\nmet 240 times, yet, curious to say, although the average attendance up\r\nto 1883 was seven out of nine, the full strength of the club only met on\r\ntwenty-seven occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.19.\r\n\r\n1865.\r\n\r\n[The progress of the American civil war suggested to Huxley in 1865 the\r\ntext for an article, \"Emancipation, Black and White,\" the emancipation\r\nof the negro in America and the emancipation of women in England, which\r\nappeared in the \"Reader\" of May 20 (\"Collected Essays\" 3 66). His main\r\nargument for the emancipation of the negro was that already given in his\r\nletter to his sister; namely, that in accordance with the moral law that\r\nno human being can arbitrarily dominate over another without grievous\r\ndamage to his own nature, the master will benefit by freedom more than\r\nthe freed-man. And just as the negro will never take the highest places\r\nin civilisation yet need not to be confined to the lowest, so, he\r\nargues, it will be with women.] \"Nature's old salique law will never be\r\nrepealed, and no change of dynasty will be effected,\" [although]\r\n\"whatever argument justifies a given education for all boys justifies\r\nits application to girls as well.\"\r\n\r\n[With this may be compared his letter to the \"Times\" of July 8, 1874\r\n(Chapter 28).\r\n\r\nNo scientific monographs were published in 1865 by Huxley, but his\r\nlectures of the previous winter to working-men on \"The various Races of\r\nMankind\" are an indication of his continued interest in Ethnology,\r\nwhich, set going, as has been said, by the promise to revise the\r\nwoodcuts for Lyell's book, found expression in such papers as the \"Human\r\nRemains in the Shell Mounds,\" 1863; the \"Neanderthal Remains\" of 1864;\r\nthe \"Methods and Results of Ethnology\" of 1865; his Fullerian Lectures\r\nof 1866-67; papers on \"Two Widely Contrasted Forms of the Human Cranium\"\r\nof 1866 and 1868; the \"Patagonian Skulls\" of 1868; and \"Some Fixed\r\nPoints in British Ethnology\" of 1871:--\r\n\r\nHis published ethnological papers (says Sir Michael Foster) are not\r\nnumerous, nor can they be taken as a measure of his influence on this\r\nbranch of study. In many ways he has made himself felt, not the least by\r\nthe severity with which on the one hand he repressed the pretensions of\r\nshallow persons who, taking advantage of the glamour of the Darwinian\r\ndoctrine, talked nonsense in the name of anthropological science, and on\r\nthe other hand, exposed those who in the structure of the brain or of\r\nother parts, saw an impassable gulf between man and the monkey. The\r\nepisode of the \"hippocampus\" stirred for a while not only science but\r\nthe general public. He used his influence, already year by year growing\r\nmore and more powerful, to keep the study of the natural history of man\r\nwithin its proper lines, and chiefly with this end in view held the\r\nPresidential Chair of the Ethnological Society in 1869-70. It was mainly\r\nthrough his influence that this older Ethnological Society was, a year\r\nlater, in 1871, amalgamated with a newer rival society, the\r\nAnthropological, under the title of \"The Anthropological Institute.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this time he was constantly occupied with paleontological work,\r\nas the following letter to Sir Charles Lyell indicates:--]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, November 27, 1865.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir Charles,\r\n\r\nI returned last night from a hasty journey to Ireland, whither I betook\r\nmyself on Thursday night, being attracted vulture-wise by the scent of a\r\nquantity of carboniferous corpses. The journey was as well worth the\r\ntrouble as any I ever undertook, seeing that in a morning's work I\r\nturned out ten genera of vertebrate animals of which five are certainly\r\nnew; and of these four are Labyrinthodonts, amphibia of new types. These\r\nfour are baptised Ophiderpeton, Lepterpeton, Ichthyerpeton,\r\nKeraterpeton. They all have ossified spinal columns and limbs. The\r\nspecial interest attaching to the two first is that they represent a\r\ntype of Labyrinthodonts hitherto unknown, and corresponding with Siren\r\nand Amphiuma among living Amphibia. Ophiderpeton, for example, is like\r\nan eel, about three feet long with small fore legs and rudimentary hind\r\nones.\r\n\r\nIn the year of grace 1861, there were three genera of European\r\ncarboniferous Labyrinthodonts known, Archegosaurus, Scleroceplus,\r\nParabatrachus.\r\n\r\nThe vertebral column of Archegosaurus was alone known, and it was in a\r\nremarkably imperfect state of ossification. Since that date, by a\r\nsuccession of odd chances, seven new genera have come into my hands, and\r\nof these six certainly have well-ossified and developed vertebral\r\ncolumns.\r\n\r\nI reckon there are now about thirty genera of Labyrinthodonts known from\r\nall parts of the world and all deposits. Of these eleven have been\r\nestablished by myself in the course of the last half-dozen years, upon\r\nremains which have come into my hands by the merest chance.\r\n\r\nFive and twenty years ago, all the world but yourself believed that a\r\nvertebrate animal of higher organisation than a fish in the\r\ncarboniferous rocks never existed. I think the whole story is not a bad\r\ncomment upon negative evidence.\r\n\r\nJanuary 1, 1865.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nI cannot do better than write my first letter of the year to you, if it\r\nis only to wish you and yours your fair share (and more than your fair\r\nshare, if need be) of good for the New Year. The immediate cause of my\r\nwriting, however, was turning out my pocket and finding therein an\r\nunanswered letter of yours containing a scrap on which is a request for\r\na photograph, which I am afraid I overlooked. At least I hope I did, and\r\nthen my manners won't be so bad. I enclose the latest version of myself.\r\n\r\nI wish I could follow out your suggestion about a book on zoology. (By\r\nthe way please to tell Miss Emma that my last book IS a book. [The first\r\nvolume of his Hunterian Lectures on \"Comparative Anatomy.\" A second\r\nvolume never appeared. Miss Darwin, as her father wrote to Huxley after\r\nthe delivery of his Working Men's Lectures in 1862, \"was reading your\r\nLectures, and ended by saying, 'I wish he would write a book.' I\r\nanswered, 'he has just written a great book on the skull.' 'I don't call\r\nthat a book,' she replied, and added, 'I want something that people can\r\nread; he does write so well.'\"] Marry come up! Does her ladyship call it\r\na pamphlet?)\r\n\r\nBut I assure you that writing is a perfect pest to me unless I am\r\ninterested, and not only a bore but a very slow process. I have some\r\npopular lectures on Physiology, which have been half done for more than\r\na twelvemonth, and I hate the sight of them because the subject no\r\nlonger interests me, and my head is full of other matters. [See letter\r\nof April 22, 1863.]\r\n\r\nSo I have just done giving a set of lectures to working-men on \"The\r\nVarious Races of Mankind,\" which really would make a book in Miss Emma's\r\nsense of the word, and which I have had reported. But when am I to work\r\nthem up? Twenty-four Hunterian Lectures loom between me and Easter. I am\r\ndying to get out the second volume of the book that is not a book, but\r\nin vain.\r\n\r\nI trust you are better, though the last news I had of you from Lubbock\r\nwas not so encouraging as I could have wished.\r\n\r\nWith best wishes and remembrances to Mrs. Darwin.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nThanks for \"fur Darwin,\" I had it.\r\n\r\n26 Abbey Place, January 15, 1865.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nMany thanks for Deslongchamps' paper which I do not possess.\r\n\r\nI received another important publication yesterday morning in the shape\r\nof a small but hearty son, who came to light a little before six. The\r\nwife is getting on capitally, and we are both greatly rejoiced at having\r\nanother boy, as your godson ran great risks of being spoiled by a harem\r\nof sisters.\r\n\r\nThe leader in the \"Reader\" IS mine, and I am glad you like it. The more\r\nso as it has got me into trouble with some of my friends. However, the\r\nrevolution that is going on is not to be made with rose-water.\r\n\r\nI wish if anything occurs to you that would improve the scientific part\r\nof the \"Reader,\" you would let me know as I am in great measure\r\nresponsible for it.\r\n\r\nI am sorry not to have a better account of your health. With kind\r\nremembrances to Mrs. Darwin and the rest of your circle.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, May 1, 1865.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nI send you by this post a booklet none of which is much worth your\r\nreading, while of nine-tenths of it you may say as the man did who had\r\nbeen trying to read Johnson's \"Dictionary,\" \"that the words were fine,\r\nbut he couldn't make much of the story.\" [Probably \"A Catalogue of the\r\nCollection of Fossils in the Museum of Practical Geology,\" etc.]\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the young lady who has been kind enough to act as taster of\r\nmy books heretofore will read the explanatory notice, and give me her\r\nideas thereupon (always recollecting that almost the whole of it was\r\nwritten in the pre-Darwinian epoch.)\r\n\r\nI do not hear very good accounts of you--to my sorrow--though rumours\r\nhave reached me that the opus magnum is completely developed though not\r\nyet born. [On \"Pangenesis.\"]\r\n\r\nI am grinding at the mill and getting a little tired. My belongings\r\nflourishing as I hope you are.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, May 29, 1865.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nI meant to have written to you yesterday to say how glad I shall be to\r\nread whatever you like to send me.\r\n\r\nI have to lecture at the Royal Institution this week, but after Friday,\r\nmy time will be more at my own disposal than usual; and as always I\r\nshall be most particularly glad to be of any use to you.\r\n\r\nAny glimmer of light on the question you speak of is of the utmost\r\nimportance, and I shall be immensely interested in learning your views.\r\nAnd of course I need not add I will do my best to upset them. That is\r\nthe nature of the beast.\r\n\r\nI had a letter from one of the ablest of the younger zoologists of\r\nGermany, Haeckel, the other day, in which this passage occurs:--\r\n\r\n\"The Darwinian Theory, the establishment and development of which is the\r\nobject [of] all my scientific labours, has gained ground immensely in\r\nGermany (where it was at first so misunderstood) during the last two\r\nyears, and I entertain no doubt that it will before long be everywhere\r\nvictorious.\" And he adds that I dealt far too mildly with Kolliker.\r\n\r\nWith kindest remembrances to Mrs. Darwin and your family.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[This year, as is seen from the foregoing, he was again in direct\r\ncommunication with Professor Ernst Haeckel of Jena, the earliest and\r\nstrongest champion of Darwinian ideas in Germany. The latter wished to\r\nenlarge his observations by joining some English scientific expedition,\r\nif any such were in preparation, but was dissuaded by the following\r\nreply. The expected book of Darwin's was the \"Pangenesis,\" and this is\r\nalso referred to in the three succeeding letters to Darwin himself.]\r\n\r\nThe Royal School of Mines, Jermyn Street, London, June 7, 1865.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your letter, and for the welcome present of your\r\nportrait, which I shall value greatly, and in exchange for which I\r\nenclose my own. Indeed I have delayed writing to you in order to be able\r\nto send the last \"new and improved\" edition of myself.\r\n\r\nI wish it were in my power to help you to any such appointment as that\r\nyou wish for. But I do not think our government is likely to send out\r\nany scientific expedition to the South Seas. There is a talk about a new\r\nArctic expedition, but I doubt if it will come to much, and even if it\r\nshould be organised I could not recommend your throwing yourself away in\r\nan undertaking which promises more frost-bites than anything else to a\r\nnaturalist.\r\n\r\nIn truth, though I have felt and can still feel the attraction of\r\nforeign travel in all its strength, I would counsel you to stop at home,\r\nand as Goethe says, find your America here. There are plenty of people\r\nwho can observe and whose places, if they are expended by fever or\r\nshipwreck, can be well enough filled up. But there are very few who can\r\ngrapple with the higher problems of science as you have done and are\r\ndoing, and we cannot afford to lose you. It is the organisation of\r\nknowledge rather than its increase which is wanted just now. And I think\r\nyou can help in this great undertaking better in Germany than in New\r\nZealand.\r\n\r\nDarwin has been very ill for more than a year past, so ill, in fact,\r\nthat his recovery was at one time doubtful. But he contrives to work in\r\nspite of fate, and I hope that before long we shall have a new book from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBy way of consolation I sent him an extract from your letter touching\r\nthe progress of his views.\r\n\r\nI am glad that you did not think my critique of Kolliker too severe. He\r\nis an old friend of mine, and I desired to be as gentle as possible,\r\nwhile performing the unpleasant duty of showing how thoroughly he had\r\nmisunderstood the question.\r\n\r\nI shall look with great interest for your promised book. Lately I have\r\nbeen busy with Ethnological questions, and I fear I shall not altogether\r\nplease your able friend Professor Schleicher in some remarks I have had\r\nto make upon the supposed value of philological evidence.\r\n\r\nMay we hope to see you at the meeting of the British Association at\r\nBirmingham? It would give many, and especially myself, much pleasure to\r\nbecome personally acquainted with you.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nThe Royal School of Mines, Jermyn Street, June 1, 1865.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nYour MS. [of \"Pangenesis\"] reached me safely last evening.\r\n\r\nI could not refrain from glancing over it on the spot, and I perceive I\r\nshall have to put on my sharpest spectacles and best considering cap.\r\n\r\nI shall not write till I have thought well on the whole subject.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, July 16, 1865.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nI have just counted the pages of your MS. to see that they are all\r\nright, and packed it up to send you by post, registered, so I hope it\r\nwill reach you safely. I should have sent it yesterday, but people came\r\nin and bothered me about post time.\r\n\r\nI did not at all mean by what I said to stop you from publishing your\r\nviews, and I really should not like to take that responsibility.\r\nSomebody rummaging among your papers half a century hence will find\r\n\"Pangenesis\" and say, \"See this wonderful anticipation of our modern\r\ntheories, and that stupid ass Huxley preventing his publishing them.\"\r\nAnd then the Carlyleans of that day will make me a text for holding\r\nforth upon the difference between mere vulpine sharpness and genius.\r\n\r\nI am not going to be made a horrid example of in that way. But all I say\r\nis, publish your views, not so much in the shape of formed conclusions,\r\nas of hypothetical developments of the only clue at present accessible,\r\nand don't give the Philistines more chances of blaspheming than you can\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\nI am very grieved to hear that you have been so ill again.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n26 Abbey Place, October 2, 1865.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\n\"This comes hoping you are well,\" and for no other purpose than to say\r\nas much. I am just back from seven weeks' idleness at Littlehampton with\r\nmy wife and children, the first time I have had a holiday of any extent\r\nwith them for years.\r\n\r\nWe are all flourishing--the babies particularly so--and I find myself\r\nrather loth to begin grinding at the mill again. There is a vein of\r\nlaziness in me which crops out uncommonly strong in your godson, who is\r\nabout the idlest, jolliest young four year old I know.\r\n\r\nYou will have been as much grieved as I have been about dear old Hooker.\r\nAccording to the last accounts, however, he is mending, and I hope to\r\nsee him in the pristine vigour again before long.\r\n\r\nMy wife is gone to bed or she would join me in the kindest regards and\r\nremembrances to Mrs. Darwin and your family.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The sound judgment and nice sense of honour for which Huxley was known\r\namong his friends often led those who were in difficulties to appeal to\r\nhim for advice. About this time a dispute arose over an alleged case of\r\nunacknowledged \"conveyance\" of information. Writing to Hooker, he says\r\nthe one party to the quarrel failed to \"set the affair straight with\r\nhalf a dozen words of frank explanation as he might have done;\" as to\r\nthe other, \"like all quiet and mild men who do get a grievance, he\r\nbecame about twice as 'wud' as Berserks like you and me.\" Both came to\r\nhim, so that he says, \"I have found it very difficult to deal honestly\r\nwith both sides without betraying the confidence of either or making\r\nmatters worse.\" Happily, with his help, matters reached a peaceful\r\nsolution, and his final comment is:--]\r\n\r\nI don't mind fighting to the death in a good big row, but when A and B\r\nare supplying themselves from C's orchard, I don't think it is very much\r\nworth while to dispute whether B filled his pockets directly from the\r\ntrees or indirectly helped himself to the contents of A's basket. If B\r\nhas so helped himself, he certainly ought to say so like a man, but if I\r\nwere A, I would not much care whether he did or not.\r\n\r\n-- has been horribly disgusted about it, but I am not sure the\r\ndiscipline may not have opened his eyes to new and useful aspects of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n[The summer of 1865 saw the inception of an educational experiment--an\r\nInternational Education Society--to which Huxley gladly gave his support\r\nas a step in the right direction. He had long been convinced of the\r\ninadequacy of existing forms of education--survivals from the needs of a\r\nbygone age--to prepare for the new forms into which intellectual life\r\nwas passing. That educators should be content to bring up the young\r\ngeneration in the modes of thought which satisfied their forefathers\r\nthree centuries ago, as if no change had passed over the world since\r\nthen, filled him with mingled amazement and horror.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the scheme was the International College, at Spring\r\nGrove, Isleworth, under the headmastership of Dr. Leonhard Schmitz; one\r\nof the chief members of the committee being Dr. (afterwards Sir) William\r\nSmith, while at the head of the Society was Richard Cobden, under whose\r\npresidency it had been registered some time before. John Stuart Mill,\r\nhowever, refused to join, considering that this was not the most needed\r\nreform in education, and that he could not support a school in which the\r\nordinary theology was taught.\r\n\r\nAn article in the \"Reader\" for June 17, 1865, sketches the plan. The\r\ndesign was to give a liberal education to boys whether intended for a\r\nprofession or for commerce. The education for both was the same up to a\r\ncertain point, corresponding to that given in our higher schools,\r\ntogether with foreign languages and the elements of physical and social\r\nscience, after which the courses bifurcated. (For a fuller account of\r\nthe scientific education see below.) Special stress was laid on modern\r\nlanguages, both for themselves and as a preparation and help for\r\nclassical teaching. Accordingly, the International College was one of\r\nthree parallel institutions in England, France, and Germany, where a boy\r\ncould in turn acquire a sound knowledge of all three languages while\r\ncontinuing the same course of education. The Franco-Prussian war of\r\n1870, however, proved fatal to the scheme.\r\n\r\nSome letters to his friend Dr. W.K. Parker, show the good-fellowship\r\nwhich existed between them, as well as the interest he took in the style\r\nand success of Parker's work. (A man of whom he wrote (preface to\r\nProfessor Jeffery Parker's \"Life of W.K. Parker\" 1893), that \"in him the\r\ngenius of an artist struggled with that of a philosopher, and not\r\nunfrequently the latter got the worst of the contest.\" He speaks too of\r\nhis \"minute accuracy in observation and boundless memory for details and\r\nimagination which absolutely rioted in the scenting out of subtle and\r\noften far-fetched analogies.\") Parker was hard at work on Birds, a\r\nsubject in which his friend and leader also was deeply interested, and\r\nwas indeed preparing an important book upon it.\r\n\r\nReferring to his candidature for the Royal Society, he writes on\r\nFebruary 21, 1865:] \"With reference to your candidature, I am ready to\r\nbring your name forward whenever you like, and to back you with 'all my\r\nmight, power, amity, and authority,' as Essex did Bacon (you need not\r\nserve me as Bacon did Essex afterwards), but my impression has been that\r\nyou did not wish to come forward this year.\"\r\n\r\n[And on November 2, 1866, congratulating him on his] \"well-earned\r\nhonour\" [of the F.R.S.]--\"Go on and prosper. These are not the things\r\nwise men work for; but it is not the less proper of a wise man to take\r\nthem when they come unsought.\"\r\n\r\n26 Abbey Place, December 3, 1865.\r\n\r\nMy dear Parker,\r\n\r\nI have been so terribly pressed by my work that I have only just been\r\nable to finish the reading of your paper.\r\n\r\nVery few pieces of work which have fallen in my way come near your\r\naccount of the Struthious skull in point of clearness and completeness.\r\nIt is a most admirable essay, and will make an epoch in this kind of\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\nI want you, however, to remodel the introduction, and to make some\r\nunessential but convenient difference in the arrangement of some of the\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nSecondly, full as the appendix is of most valuable and interesting\r\nmatter, I advise you for the present to keep it back.\r\n\r\nMy reason is that you have done justice neither to yourself nor to your\r\ntopics, and that if the appendix is printed as it stands, your labour\r\nwill be in great measure lost.\r\n\r\nYou start subjects enough for half a dozen papers, and partly from the\r\ncompression thus resulting, and partly from the absence of\r\nillustrations, I do not believe there are half a dozen men in Europe who\r\nwill be able to follow you. Furthermore, though the appendix is relevant\r\nenough--every line of it--to those who have dived deep, as you and I\r\nhave--to any one else it has all the aspects of a string of desultory\r\ndiscussions. AS YOUR FATHER CONFESSOR, I FORBID THE PUBLICATION OF THE\r\nAPPENDIX. After having had all this trouble with you I am not going to\r\nhave you waste your powers for want of a little method, so I tell you.\r\n\r\nWhat you are to do is this. You are to rewrite the introduction and to\r\nsay that the present paper is the first of a series on the structure of\r\nthe vertebrate skull; that the second will be \"On the development of the\r\nosseous cranium of the Common Fowl\" (and here (if you are good), I will\r\npermit you to introduce the episode on cartilage and membrane\r\n[illegible]); the third will be \"On the chief modifications of the\r\ncranium observed in the Sauropsida.\"\r\n\r\nThe fourth, \"On the mammalian skull.\"\r\n\r\nThe fifth, \"On the skull of the Ichthyopsida.\"\r\n\r\nI will give you two years from this time to execute these five memoirs;\r\nand then if you have stood good-temperedly the amount of badgering and\r\nbullying you will get from me whenever you come dutifully to report\r\nprogress, you shall be left to your own devices in the third year to\r\npublish a paper on \"The general structure and theory of the vertebrate\r\nskull.\"\r\n\r\nYou have a brilliant field before you, and a start such that no one is\r\nlikely to catch you. Sit deliberately down over against the city,\r\nconquer it and make it your own, and don't be wasting powder in knocking\r\ndown odd bastions with random shells.\r\n\r\nI write jestingly, but I really am very much in earnest. Come and have a\r\ntalk on the matter as soon as you can, for I should send in my report.\r\nYou will find me in Jermyn Street, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday\r\nmornings, Thursday afternoon, but not Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon.\r\nSend a line to say when you will come.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.20.\r\n\r\n1866.\r\n\r\n[Besides his Fullerian lectures on Ethnology at the Royal Institution\r\nthis year, Huxley published in February 1866 a paper in the \"Natural\r\nHistory Review,\" on the \"Prehistoric Remains of Caithness,\" based upon a\r\nquantity of remains found the previous autumn at Keiss. This, and the\r\narticle on the \"Neanderthal Skull\" in the \"Natural History Review\" for\r\n1864, attracted some notice among foreign anthropologists. Dr. H.\r\nWelcker writes about them; Dr. A. Ecker wants the \"Prehistoric Remains\"\r\nfor his new \"Archiv fur Anthropologie\"; the Societe d'Anthropologie de\r\nParis elects him a Foreign Associate.\r\n\r\nHe was asked by Dr. Fayrer to assist in a great scheme he had proposed\r\nto the Asiatic Society (Comp. Chapter 22 ad init. and Appendix 1.), to\r\ngather men of every tribe from India, the Malayan Peninsula, Persia,\r\nArabia, the Indian Archipelago, etc., for anthropological purposes. It\r\nwas well received by the Council of the Society and by the\r\nLieutenant-Governor of Bengal; anything Huxley could say in its favour\r\nwould be of great weight. Would he come out as Dr. Fayrer's guest?\r\n\r\nUnable to go to Calcutta, he sent the following letter:--]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, London, June 14, 1866.\r\n\r\nMy dear Fayrer,\r\n\r\nI lose no time in replying to your second letter, and my first business\r\nis to apologise for not having answered the first, but it reached me in\r\nthe thick of my lectures, and like a great many other things which ought\r\nto have been done I put off replying to a more convenient season. I have\r\nbeen terribly hard worked this year, and thought I was going to break\r\ndown a few weeks ago but luckily I have pulled through.\r\n\r\nI heartily wish that there were the smallest chance of my being able to\r\naccept your kind invitation and take part in your great scheme at\r\nCalcutta. But it is impossible for me to leave England for more than six\r\nweeks or two months, and that only in the autumn, a time of year when I\r\nimagine Calcutta is not likely to be the scene of anything but cholera\r\npatients.\r\n\r\nAs to your plan itself, I think it a most grand and useful one if it can\r\nbe properly carried out. But you do things on so grand a scale in India\r\nthat I suppose all the practical difficulties which suggest themselves\r\nto me may be overcome.\r\n\r\nIt strikes me that it will not do to be content with a single\r\nrepresentative of each tribe. At least four or five will be needed to\r\neliminate the chances of accident, and even then much will depend upon\r\nthe discretion and judgment of the local agent who makes the suggestion.\r\nThis difficulty, however, applies chiefly if not solely to physical\r\nethnology. To the philologer the opportunities for comparing dialects\r\nand checking pronunciation will be splendid, however [few] the\r\nindividual speakers of each dialect may be. The most difficult task of\r\nall will be to prevent the assembled Savans from massacring the\r\n\"specimens\" at the end of the exhibition for the sake of their skulls\r\nand pelves!\r\n\r\nI am really afraid that my own virtue might yield if so tempted!\r\n\r\nJesting apart, I heartily wish your plans success, and if there are any\r\nmore definite ways in which I can help, let me know, and I will do my\r\nbest. You will want, I should think, a physical and a philological\r\ncommittee to organise schemes: (1) for systematic measuring, weighing,\r\nand portraiture, with observation and recording of all physical\r\ncharacters; and (2) for uniform registering of sounds by Roman letters\r\nand collection of vocabularies and grammatical forms upon an uniform\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nI should advise you to look into the Museum of the Societe\r\nd'Anthropologie of Paris, and to put yourself in communication with M.\r\nPaul Broca, one of its most active members, who has lately been\r\norganising a scheme of general anthropological instructions. But don't\r\nhave anything to do with the quacks who are at the head of the\r\n\"Anthropological Society\" over here. If they catch scent of what you are\r\nabout they will certainly want to hook on to you.\r\n\r\nOnce more I wish I had the chance of being able to visit your congress.\r\nI have been lecturing on Ethnology this year [As Fullerian Professor at\r\nthe Royal Institution.], and shall be again this year, and I would give\r\na good deal to be able to look at the complex facts of Indian Ethnology\r\nwith my own eyes.\r\n\r\nBut as the sage observed, \"what's impossible can't be,\" and what with\r\nshort holidays--a wife and seven children--and miles of work in arrear,\r\nIndia is an impossibility for me.\r\n\r\nYou say nothing about yourself, so I trust you are well and hearty, and\r\nall your belongings flourishing.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[In paleontology he published this year papers on the \"Vertebrate\r\nRemains from the Jarrow Colliery, Kilkenny;\" on a new \"Telerpeton from\r\nElgin,\" and on some \"Dinosaurs from South Africa.\" The latter, and many\r\nmore afterwards, were sent over by a young man named Alfred Brown, who\r\nhad a curious history. A Quaker gentleman came across him when employed\r\nin cleaning tools in Cirencester College, found that he was a good Greek\r\nand Latin scholar, and got him a tutorship in a clergyman's family at\r\nthe Cape. He afterwards entered the postal service, and being inspired\r\nwith a vivid interest in geology, spent all the leave he could obtain\r\nfrom his office on the Orange River in getting fossils from the\r\nStormberg Rocks. These, as often as he could afford to send such weighty\r\npackages, he sent to Sir R. Murchison, to whom he had received a letter\r\nof introduction from his official superior. Sir Roderick, writing to\r\nHuxley, says \"that he was proud of his new recruit,\" to whom he sent not\r\nonly welcome words of encouragement, but the no less welcome news that\r\nthe brother of his \"discoverer,\" hearing of the facts from Professor\r\nWoodward, offered to defray his expenses so that he could collect\r\nregularly.\r\n\r\nOn April 2 Huxley was in Edinburgh to receive the first academic\r\ndistinction conferred upon him in Britain. He received the honorary\r\ndegree of the University in company with Tyndall and Carlyle. It was\r\npart of the fitness of things that he should be associated in this\r\nhonour with his close friend Tyndall; but though he frequently\r\nacknowledged his debt to Carlyle as the teacher who in his youth had\r\ninspired him with his undying hatred of shams and humbugs of every kind,\r\nand whom he had gratefully come to know in after days, Carlyle did not\r\nforgive the publication of \"Man's Place in Nature.\" Years after, near\r\nthe end of his life, my father saw him walking slowly and alone down the\r\nopposite side of the street, and touched by his solitary appearance,\r\ncrossed over and spoke to him. The old man looked at him, and merely\r\nremarking, \"You're Huxley, aren't you? the man that says we are all\r\ndescended from monkeys,\" went on his way.\r\n\r\nOn July 6 he writes to tell Darwin that he has lodged a memorial of his\r\nabout the fossils at the Gallegos river, which was to be visited by the\r\n\"Nassau\" [Chapter 22] exploring ship, with the hydrographer direct,\r\ninstead of sending it in to the Lords of the Admiralty, who would only\r\nhave sent it on to the hydrographer. This letter he heads \"Country\r\norders executed with accuracy and despatch.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter to Charles Kingsley explains itself:--]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, April 12, 1866.\r\n\r\nMy dear Kingsley,\r\n\r\nI shall certainly do myself the pleasure of listening to you when you\r\npreach at the Royal Institution. I wonder if you are going to take the\r\nline of showing up the superstitions of men of science. Their name is\r\nlegion, and the exploit would be a telling one. I would do it myself\r\nonly I think I am already sufficiently isolated and unpopular.\r\n\r\nHowever, whatever you are going to do I am sure you will speak honestly\r\nand well, and I shall come and be assistant bottleholder.\r\n\r\nI am glad you like the working men's lectures. I suspect they are about\r\nthe best things of that line that I have done, and I only wish I had had\r\nthe sense to anticipate the run they have had here and abroad, and I\r\nwould have revised them properly.\r\n\r\nAs they stand they are terribly in the rough, from a literary point of\r\nview.\r\n\r\nNo doubt crib-biting, nurse-biting and original sin in general are all\r\nstrictly reducible from Darwinian principles; but don't by misadventure\r\nrun against any academical facts.\r\n\r\nSome whales have all the cerebral vertebrae free NOW, and every one of\r\nthem has the full number, seven, whether they are free or fixed. No\r\ndoubt whales had hind legs once upon a time. If when you come up to town\r\nyou go to the College of Surgeons, my friend Flower the Conservator (a\r\ngood man whom you should know), will show you the whalebone whale's\r\nthigh bones in the grand skeleton they have recently set up. The legs,\r\nto be sure, and the feet are gone, the battle of life having left\r\nprivate Cetacea in the condition of a Chelsea pensioner.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[This year the British Association met at Nottingham, and Huxley was\r\npresident of Section D. In this capacity he invited Professor Haeckel to\r\nattend the meeting, but the impending war with Austria prevented any\r\nPrussian from leaving his country at the time, though Haeckel managed to\r\ncome over later.\r\n\r\nHuxley did not deliver a regular opening address to the section on the\r\nThursday, but on the Friday made a speech, which was followed by a\r\ndiscussion upon biology and its several branches, especially morphology\r\nand its relation to physiology (\"the facts concerning form are questions\r\nof force, every form is force visible.\") He lamented that the\r\nsubdivisions of the section had to meet separately as a result of\r\nspecialisation, the reason for which he found in the want of proper\r\nscientific education in schools. And this was the fault of the\r\nuniversities, for just as in the story, \"Stick won't beat dog, dog won't\r\nbite pig, and so the old woman can't get home,\" science would not be\r\ntaught in the schools until it is recognised by the universities.\r\n\r\nThis prepared the way for Dean Farrar's paper on science teaching in the\r\npublic schools. His experience as a master at Harrow made him strongly\r\noppose the existing plan of teaching all boys classical composition\r\nwhether they were suited for it or no. He wished to exchange a great\r\ndeal of Latin verse-making for elementary science.\r\n\r\nThis paper was doubly interesting to Huxley, as coming from a classical\r\nmaster in a public school, and he remarked, \"He felt sure that at the\r\npresent time, the important question for England was not the duration of\r\nher coal, but the due comprehension of the truths of science, and the\r\nlabours of her scientific men.\"\r\n\r\nOn the practical side, however, Mr. J. Payne said the great difficulty\r\nwas the want of teachers; and suggested that if men of science were\r\nreally in earnest they would condescend to teach in the schools.\r\n\r\nIt was to a certain extent in answer to this appeal that Huxley gave his\r\nlectures on Physiography in 1869, and instituted the course of training\r\nfor science teachers in 1871.\r\n\r\nHe concluded his work at Nottingham by a lecture to working men.\r\n\r\nThe following is in reply to Mr. Spencer who had accused himself of\r\nlosing his temper in an argument:--]\r\n\r\n26 Abbey Place, Sunday, November 8, 1868.\r\n\r\nMy dear Spencer,\r\n\r\nYour conscience has been treating you with the most extreme and unjust\r\nseverity.\r\n\r\nI recollect you LOOKED rather savage at one point in our discussion, but\r\nI do assure you that you committed no overt act of ferocity; and if you\r\nhad, I think I should have fully deserved it for joining in the\r\nferocious onslaught we all made upon you.\r\n\r\nWhat your sins may be in this line to other folk I don't know, but so\r\nfar as I am concerned I assure you I have often said that I know no one\r\nwho takes aggravated opposition better than yourself, and that I have\r\nnot a few times been ashamed of the extent to which I have tried your\r\npatience.\r\n\r\nSo you see that you have, what the Buddhists call a stock of accumulated\r\nmerit, envers moi--and if you should ever feel inclined to \"d--n my\r\neyes\" you can do so and have a balance left.\r\n\r\nSeriously, my old friend, you must not think it necessary to apologise\r\nto me about any such matters, but believe me (d--nd or und--d)\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n26 Abbey Place, November 11, 1866.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nI thank you for the new edition of the \"Origin,\" and congratulate you on\r\nhaving done with it for a while, so as to be able to go on to that book\r\nof a portion of which I had a glimpse years ago. I hear good accounts of\r\nyour health, indeed the last was that you were so rampageous you meant\r\nto come to London and have a spree among its dissipations. May that be\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nI am in the thick of my work, and have only had time to glance at your\r\n\"Historical Sketch.\"\r\n\r\nWhat an unmerciful basting you give \"our mutual friend.\" I did not know\r\nhe had put forward any claim! and even now that I read it black and\r\nwhite, I can hardly believe it.\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear from Spencer that you are on the right (that is MY)\r\nside in the Jamaica business. But it is wonderful how people who\r\ncommonly act together are divided about it.\r\n\r\nMy wife joins with me in kindest wishes to Mrs. Darwin and yourself.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nYou will receive an elementary physiology book, not for your reading but\r\nfor Miss Darwin's. Were you not charmed with Haeckel?\r\n\r\n[The \"Jamaica business\" here alluded to was Governor Eyre's suppression\r\nof the negro rising, in the course of which he had executed, under\r\nmartial law, a coloured leader and member of the Assembly, named Gordon.\r\nThe question of his justification in so doing stirred England\r\nprofoundly. It became the touchstone of ultimate political convictions.\r\nMen who had little concern for ordinary politics, came forward to defend\r\na great constitutional principle which they conceived to be endangered.\r\nA committee was formed to prosecute Governor Eyre on a charge of murder,\r\nin order to vindicate the right of a prisoner to trial by due process of\r\nlaw. Thereupon a counter-committee was organised for the defence of the\r\nman who, like Cromwell, judged that the people preferred their real\r\nsecurity to forms, and had presumably saved the white population of\r\nJamaica by striking promptly at the focus of rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe \"Pall Mall Gazette\" of October 29, 1866, made a would-be smart\r\nallusion to the part taken in the affair by Huxley, which evoked, in\r\nreply, a calm statement of his reasons for joining the prosecuting\r\ncommittee:--\r\n\r\nIt is amusing (says the \"Pall Mall\") to see how the rival committees,\r\nthe one for the prosecution and the other for the defence of Mr. Eyre,\r\nparade the names of distinguished persons who are enrolled as\r\nsubscribers on either side. Mill is set against Carlyle, and to\r\ncounterbalance the adhesion of the Laureate to the Defence Fund, the\r\n\"Star\" hastens to announce that Sir Charles Lyell and Professor Huxley\r\nhave given their support to the Jamaica Committee. Everything, of\r\ncourse, depends on the ground on which the subscriptions are given. One\r\ncan readily conceive that Mr. Tennyson has been chiefly moved by a\r\ngenerous indignation at the vindictive behaviour of the Jamaica\r\nCommittee. It would be curious also to know how far Sir Charles Lyell's\r\nand Mr. Huxley's peculiar views on the development of species have\r\ninfluenced them in bestowing on the negro that sympathetic recognition\r\nwhich they are willing to extend even to the ape as \"a man and a\r\nbrother.\"\r\n\r\nThe reply appeared in the \"Pall Mall\" of October 31:--]\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI learn from yesterday evening's \"Pall Mall Gazette\" that you are\r\ncurious to know whether certain \"peculiar views on the development of\r\nspecies,\" which I am said to hold in the excellent company of Sir\r\nCharles Lyell, have led me to become a member of the Jamaica Committee.\r\n\r\nPermit me without delay to satisfy a curiosity which does me honour. I\r\nhave been induced to join that committee neither by my \"peculiar views\r\non the development of species,\" nor by any particular love for, or\r\nadmiration of the negro--still less by any miserable desire to wreak\r\nvengeance for recent error upon a man whose early career I have often\r\nadmired; but because the course which the committee proposes to take\r\nappears to me to be the only one by which a question of the profoundest\r\npractical importance can be answered. That question is, Does the killing\r\na man in the way Mr. Gordon was killed constitute murder in the eye of\r\nthe law, or does it not?\r\n\r\nYou perceive that this question is wholly independent of two others\r\nwhich are persistently confused with it, namely--was Mr. Gordon a\r\nJamaica Hampden or was he a psalm-singing fire-brand? and was Mr. Eyre\r\nactuated by the highest and noblest motives, or was he under the\r\ninfluence of panic-stricken rashness or worse impulses?\r\n\r\nI do not presume to speak with authority on a legal question; but,\r\nunless I am misinformed, English law does not permit good persons, as\r\nsuch, to strangle bad persons, as such. On the contrary, I understand\r\nthat, if the most virtuous of Britons, let his place and authority be\r\nwhat they may, seize and hang up the greatest scoundrel in Her Majesty's\r\ndominions simply because he is an evil and troublesome person, an\r\nEnglish court of justice will certainly find that virtuous person guilty\r\nof murder. Nor will the verdict be affected by any evidence that the\r\ndefendant acted from the best of motives, and, on the whole, did the\r\nState a service.\r\n\r\nNow, it MAY be that Mr. Eyre was actuated by the best of motives; it MAY\r\nbe that Jamaica is all the better for being rid of Mr. Gordon; but\r\nnevertheless the Royal Commissioners, who were appointed to inquire into\r\nMr. Gordon's case, among other matters, have declared that:--\r\n\r\nThe evidence, oral and documentary, appears to us to be wholly\r\ninsufficient to establish the charge upon which the prisoner took his\r\ntrial. (\"Report\" page 37.)\r\n\r\nAnd again that they\r\n\r\nCannot see in the evidence which has been adduced, any sufficient proof,\r\neither of his (Mr. Gordon's) complicity in the outbreak at Morant Bay,\r\nor of his having been a party to any general conspiracy against the\r\nGovernment. (\"Report\" page 38.)\r\n\r\nUnless the Royal Commissioners have greatly erred, therefore, the\r\nkilling of Mr. Gordon can only be defended on the ground that he was a\r\nbad and troublesome man; in short, that although he might not be guilty,\r\nit served him right.\r\n\r\nI entertain so deeply-rooted an objection to this method of killing\r\npeople--the act itself appears to me to be so frightful a precedent,\r\nthat I desire to see it stigmatised by the highest authority as a crime.\r\nAnd I have joined the committee which proposes to indict Mr. Eyre, in\r\nthe hope that I may hear a court of justice declare that the only\r\ndefence which can be set up (if the Royal Commissioners are right) is no\r\ndefence, and that the killing of Mr. Gordon was the greatest offence\r\nknown to the law--murder.\r\n\r\nI remain, Sir, your obedient servant.\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nThe Atehnaeum Club, October 30, 1866.\r\n\r\n[Two letters to friends who had taken the opposite side in this burning\r\nquestion show how resolutely he set himself against permitting a\r\ndifference on matters of principle to affect personal relations with his\r\nwarmest opponents.]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, November 8, 1866.\r\n\r\nMy dear Kingsley,\r\n\r\nThe letter of which you have heard, containing my reasons for becoming a\r\nmember of the Jamaica Committee was addressed to the \"Pall Mall Gazette\"\r\nin reply to some editorial speculations as to my reasons for so doing.\r\n\r\nI forget the date of the number in which my letter appeared, but I will\r\nfind it out and send you a copy of the paper.\r\n\r\nMr. Eyre's personality in this matter is nothing to me; I know nothing\r\nabout him, and, if he is a friend of yours, I am very sorry to be\r\nobliged to join in a movement which must be excessively unpleasant to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, when the verdict of the jury which will try him is once\r\ngiven, all hostility towards him on my part will cease. So far from\r\nwishing to see him vindictively punished, I would much rather, if it\r\nwere practicable, indict his official hat and his coat than himself.\r\n\r\nI desire to see Mr. Eyre indicted and a verdict of guilty in a criminal\r\ncourt obtained, because I have, from its commencement, carefully watched\r\nthe Gordon case; and because a new study of all the evidence which has\r\nnow been collected has confirmed my first conviction that Gordon's\r\nexecution was as bad a specimen as we have had since Jeffries' time of\r\npolitical murder.\r\n\r\nDon't suppose that I have any particular admiration for Gordon. He\r\nbelongs to a sufficiently poor type of small political agitator--and\r\nvery likely was a great nuisance to the Governor and other respectable\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nBut that is no reason why he should be condemned, by an absurd tribunal\r\nand with a brutal mockery of the forms of justice, for offences with\r\nwhich impartial judges, after a full investigation, declare there is no\r\nevidence to show that he was connected.\r\n\r\nEx-Governor Eyre seized the man, put him in the hands of the\r\npreposterous subalterns, who pretended to try him--saw the evidence and\r\napproved of the sentence. He is as much responsible for Gordon's death\r\nas if he had shot him through the head with his own hand. I daresay he\r\ndid all this with the best of motives, and in a heroic vein. But if\r\nEnglish law will not declare that heroes have no more right to kill\r\npeople in this fashion than other folk, I shall take an early\r\nopportunity of migrating to Texas or some other quiet place where there\r\nis less hero-worship and more respect for justice, which is to my mind\r\nof much more importance than hero-worship.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, men take sides on this question, not so much by\r\nlooking at the mere facts of the case, but rather as their deepest\r\npolitical convictions lead them. And the great use of the prosecution,\r\nand one of my reasons for joining it, is that it will help a great many\r\npeople to find out what their profoundest political beliefs are.\r\n\r\nThe hero-worshippers who believe that the world is to be governed by its\r\ngreat men, who are to lead the little ones, justly if they can; but if\r\nnot, unjustly drive or kick them the right way, will sympathise with Mr.\r\nEyre.\r\n\r\nThe other sect (to which I belong) who look upon hero-worship as no\r\nbetter than any other idolatry, and upon the attitude of mind of the\r\nhero-worshipper as essentially immoral; who think it is better for a man\r\nto go wrong in freedom than to go right in chains; who look upon the\r\nobservance of inflexible justice as between man and man as of far\r\ngreater importance than even the preservation of social order, will\r\nbelieve that Mr. Eyre has committed one of the greatest crimes of which\r\na person in authority can be guilty, and will strain every nerve to\r\nobtain a declaration that their belief is in accordance with the law of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nPeople who differ on fundamentals are not likely to convert one another.\r\nTo you, as to my dear friend Tyndall, with whom I almost always act, but\r\nwho in this matter is as much opposed to me as you are, I can only say,\r\nlet us be strong enough and wise enough to fight the question out as a\r\nmatter of principle and without bitterness.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nNovember 9, 1866.\r\n\r\nMy dear Tyndall,\r\n\r\nMany thanks for the kind note which accompanied your letter to the\r\nJamaica Committee.\r\n\r\nWhen I presented myself at Rogers' dinner last night I had not heard of\r\nthe letter, and Gassiot began poking fun at me, and declaring that your\r\nabsence was due to a quarrel between us on the unhappy subject.\r\n\r\nI replied to the jest earnestly enough, that I hoped and believed our\r\nold friendship was strong enough to stand any strain that might be put\r\non it, much as I grieved that we should be ranged in opposite camps in\r\nthis or any other cause.\r\n\r\nThat you and I have fundamentally different political principles must, I\r\nthink, have become obvious to both of us during the progress of the\r\nAmerican War. The fact is made still more plain by your printed letter,\r\nthe tone and spirit of which I greatly admired without being able to\r\nrecognise in it any important fact or argument which had not passed\r\nthrough my mind before I joined the Jamaica Committee.\r\n\r\nThus there is nothing for it but for us to agree to differ, each\r\nsupporting his own side to the best of his ability, and respecting his\r\nfriend's freedom as he would his own, and doing his best to remove all\r\npetty bitterness from that which is at bottom one of the most important\r\nconstitutional battles in which Englishmen have for many years been\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\nIf you and I are strong enough and wise enough, we shall be able to do\r\nthis, and yet preserve that love for one another which I value as one of\r\nthe good things of my life.\r\n\r\nIf not, we shall come to grief. I mean to do my best.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[Huxley was always of opinion that to write a good elementary text-book\r\nrequired a most extensive and intimate knowledge of the subject under\r\ndiscussion. Certainly the \"Lessons on Elementary Physiology\" which\r\nappeared at the end of 1866 were the outcome of such knowledge, and met\r\nwith a wonderful and lasting success as a text-book. A graceful\r\ncompliment was passed upon it by Sir William Lawrence, when, in thanking\r\nthe author for the gift of the book, he wrote (January 24, 1867), \"in\r\nyour modest book 'indocti discant, ament meminisse periti!'\"\r\n\r\nThis was before the days of American copyright, and English books were\r\nusually regarded as fair prey by the mass of American publishers. Among\r\nthe exceptions to this practical rule were the firm of D. Appleton &\r\nCo., who made it a point of honour to treat foreign authors as though\r\nthey were legally entitled to some equitable rights. On their behalf an\r\narrangement was made for an authorised American edition of the\r\n\"Physiology\" by Dr. Youmans, whose acquaintance thus made my father did\r\nnot allow to drop.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that by the year 1898 this little book had passed\r\nthrough four editions, and been reprinted thirty-one times.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.21.\r\n\r\n1867.\r\n\r\n[It has already been noted that Huxley's ethnological work continued\r\nthis year with a second series of lectures at the Royal Institution,\r\nwhile he enlarged his paper on \"Two widely contrasted forms of Human\r\nCrania,\" and published it in the \"Journal of Anatomy.\" One\r\npaleontological memoir of his appeared this year on Acanthopholis, a\r\nfossil from the chalk marl, an additional piece of work for which he\r\nexcuses himself to Sir Charles Lyell (January 4, 1867):--]\r\n\r\nThe new reptile advertised in \"Geol.

He then\r\nread the letter, which was simply signed \"A Regular Attendant at Your\r\nLectures,\" and which in a few words drew attention to the appalling\r\ndistress existing among the population out of work at the East End, and\r\nsuggested that all those present at the lecture that night should be\r\nallowed the opportunity of contributing one or two pennies each towards\r\na fund for their relief, and that the professor should become the\r\ntreasurer for the evening. This suggestion was received by the audience\r\nwith marks of approval. The professor said he would not put pressure on\r\nanyone; he would simply place his own subscription in one of the skulls\r\non the table. This he did, and all the audience coming on the platform,\r\nthrew in money in copper and silver until the novel cash box was filled\r\nwith coin which amounted to a large sum. A gentleman present expressed a\r\nhope that the example set by that audience might be followed with good\r\nresults wherever large bodies assembled either for educational or\r\nrecreative purposes.\r\n\r\n[At the end of April this year my father spent a week in Brittany with\r\nDr. Hooker and Sir J. Lubbock, rambling about the neighbourhood of\r\nRennes and Vannes, and combining the examination of prehistoric remains\r\nwith the refreshment of holiday making.\r\n\r\nFew letters of this period exist. The x Club was doing its work. Most of\r\nthose to whom he would naturally have written he met constantly. Two\r\nletters to Professor Haeckel give pieces of his experience. One suggests\r\nthe limits of aggressive polemics, as to which I remember his once\r\nsaying that he himself had only twice been the aggressor in controversy,\r\nwithout waiting to be personally attacked; once where he found his\r\nopponent was engaged in a flanking movement; the other when a man of\r\ngreat public reputation had come forward to champion an untenable\r\nposition of the older orthodoxy, and a blow dealt to his pretensions to\r\nhistorical and scientific accuracy would not only bring the question\r\nhome to many who neglected it in an impersonal form, but would also\r\nreact upon the value of the historical arguments with which he sought to\r\nstir public opinion in other spheres. The other letter touches on the\r\ninfluence, at once calming and invigorating, as he had known it to the\r\nfull for the last twelve years, which a wife can bring in the midst of\r\noutward struggles to the inner life of the home.]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, London, May 20, 1867.\r\n\r\nMy dear Haeckel,\r\n\r\nYour letter, though dated the 12th, has but just reached me. I mention\r\nthis lest you should think me remiss, my sin in not writing to you\r\nalready being sufficiently great. But your book did not reach me until\r\nNovember, and I have been hard at work lecturing, with scarcely an\r\nintermission ever since.\r\n\r\nNow I need hardly say that the \"Morphologie\" is not exactly a novel to\r\nbe taken up and read in the intervals of business. On the contrary,\r\nthough profoundly interesting, it is an uncommonly hard book, and one\r\nwants to read every sentence of it over.\r\n\r\nI went through it within a fortnight of its coming into my hands, so as\r\nto get at your general drift and purpose, but up to this time I have not\r\nbeen able to read it as I feel I ought to read it before venturing upon\r\ncriticism. You cannot imagine how my time is frittered away in these\r\naccursed lectures and examinations.\r\n\r\nThere can be but one opinion, however, as to the knowledge and\r\nintellectual grasp displayed in the book; and, to me, the attempt to\r\nsystematise biology as a whole is especially interesting and valuable.\r\n\r\nI shall go over this part of your work with great care by and by, but I\r\nam afraid you must expect that the number of biologists who will do so,\r\nwill remain exceedingly small. Our comrades are not strong in logic and\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the polemic excursus, of course, I chuckle over them\r\nmost sympathetically, and then say how naughty they are! I have done too\r\nmuch of the same sort of thing not to sympathise entirely with you; and\r\nI am much inclined to think that it is a good thing for a man, once at\r\nany rate in his life, to perform a public war-dance against all sorts of\r\nhumbug and imposture.\r\n\r\nBut having satisfied one's love of freedom in this way, perhaps the\r\nsooner the war-paint is off the better. It has no virtue except as a\r\nsign of one's own frame of mind and determination, and when that is once\r\nknown, is little better than a distraction.\r\n\r\nI think there are a few patches of this kind, my dear friend, which may\r\nas well come out in the next edition, e.g. that wonderful note about the\r\nrelation of God to gas, the gravity of which greatly tickled my fancy.\r\n\r\nI pictured to myself the effect which a translation of this would have\r\nupon the minds of my respectable countrymen!\r\n\r\nApropos of translation. Darwin wrote to me on that subject, and with his\r\nusual generosity, would have made a considerable contribution towards\r\nthe expense if we could have seen our way to the publication of a\r\ntranslation. But I do not think it would be well to translate the book\r\nin fragments, and, as a whole, it would be a very costly undertaking,\r\nwith very little chance of finding readers.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that in the British Islands there are fifty people who\r\nare competent to read the book, and of the fifty, five and twenty have\r\nread it or will read it in German.\r\n\r\nWhat I desire to do is to write a review of it, which will bring it into\r\nsome notice on this side of the water, and this I hope to do before\r\nlong. If I do not it will be, you well know, from no want of\r\ninclination, but simply from lack of time.\r\n\r\nIn any case, as soon as I have been able to study the book carefully,\r\nyou shall have my honest opinion about all points.\r\n\r\nI am glad your journey has yielded so good a scientific harvest, and\r\nespecially that you found my \"Oceanic Hydrozoa\" of some use. But I am\r\nshocked to find that you had no copy of the book of your own, and I\r\nshall take care that one is sent to you. It is my first-born work, done\r\nwhen I was very raw and inexperienced, and had neither friends nor help.\r\nPerhaps I am all the fonder of the child on that ground.\r\n\r\nA lively memory of you remains in my house, and wife and children will\r\nbe very glad to hear that I have news of you when I go home to dinner.\r\n\r\nKeep us in kindly recollection, and believe me,\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H.

I was very glad to\r\nhave the news, for it seemed to me very sad that a man of your warm\r\naffections should be surrounded only by hopeless regrets. Such\r\nsurroundings inflict a sort of partial paralysis upon one's whole\r\nnature, a result which is, to me, far more serious and regrettable than\r\nthe mere suffering one undergoes.\r\n\r\nThe one thing for men, who like you and I stand pretty much alone, and\r\nhave a good deal of fighting to do in the external world, is to have\r\nlight and warmth and confidence within the four walls of home. May all\r\nthese good things await you!\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your kind invitation to Jena. I am sure my wife would be\r\nas much pleased as I to accept it, but it is very difficult for her to\r\nleave her children.\r\n\r\nWe will keep it before us as a pleasant possibility, but I suspect you\r\nand Madame will be able to come to England before we shall reach\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nI wish I had rooms to offer you, but you have seen that troop of\r\nchildren and they leave no corner unoccupied.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for the Bericht and the genealogical tables. You seem, as\r\nusual, to have got through an immense amount of work.\r\n\r\nI have been exceedingly occupied with a paper on the \"Classification of\r\nBirds,\" a sort of expansion of one of my Hunterian Lectures this year.\r\nIt has now gone to press, and I hope soon to be able to send you a copy\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nOccupation of this and other kinds must be my excuse for having allowed\r\nso much longer a time to slip by than I imagined had done before writing\r\nto you. It is not for want of sympathy, be sure, for my wife and I have\r\noften talked of the new life opening out to you.\r\n\r\nThis is written in my best hand. I am proud of it, as I can read every\r\nword quite easily myself, which is more than I can always say for my own\r\nMS.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H.

We are all\r\nglad to have news of you, though it was really very unnecessary to thank\r\nus for trying to make your brief visit a pleasant one. Your conscience\r\nmust be more \"pungent\" than your talk, if it pricks you with so little\r\ncause. My wife rejoices saucily to find that phrase of hers has stuck so\r\nstrongly in your mind, but you must remember her fondness for \"Tusch.\"\r\n\r\nYou must certainly marry. In my bachelor days, it was unsafe for anyone\r\nto approach me before mid-day, and for all intellectual purposes I was\r\nbarren till the evening. Breakfast at six would have upset me for the\r\nday. You and the lobster noted the difference the other day.\r\n\r\nWhether it is matrimony or whether it is middle age I don't know, but as\r\ntime goes on you can combine both.\r\n\r\nI cannot but accept your kind offer to send me Fanny Lewald's works,\r\nthough it is a shame to rob you of them. In return my wife insists on\r\nyour studying a copy of Tennyson, which we shall send you as soon as we\r\nreturn to civilisation, which will be next Friday. If you are in London\r\nafter that date we shall hope to see you once more before you return to\r\nthe bosom of the \"Fatherland.\"\r\n\r\nI did my best to give the children your message, but I fear I failed\r\nignominiously in giving the proper bovine vocalisation to \"Mroo.\"\r\n\r\nThat small curly-headed boy Harry, struck, I suppose by the kindness you\r\nboth show to children, has effected a synthesis between you and Tyndall,\r\nand gravely observed the other day, \"Doctor Dohrn-Tyndall do say Mroo.\"\r\n\r\nMy wife...Sends her kind regards. The \"seven\" are not here or they would\r\nvote love by acclamation.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[He did not this year attend the British Association, which was held in\r\nDundee. This was the first occasion on which an evening was devoted to a\r\nworking men's lecture, a step important as tending towards his own ideal\r\nof what science should be:--not the province of a few, but the\r\npossession of the many.\r\n\r\nThis first lecture was delivered by Professor Tyndall, who wrote him an\r\naccount of the meeting, and in particular of his reconciliation with\r\nProfessors Thomson (Lord Kelvin) and Tait, with whom he had had a\r\nsomewhat embittered controversy.\r\n\r\nIn his reply, Huxley writes:--]\r\n\r\nTo J. Tyndall.\r\n\r\nThanks also for a copy of the \"Dundee Advertiser\" containing your\r\nlecture. It seemed to me that the report must be a very good one, and\r\nthe lecture reads exceedingly well. You have inaugurated the working\r\nmen's lectures of the Association in a way that cannot be improved. And\r\nit was worth the trouble, for I suspect they will become a great and\r\nnoble feature in the meetings.\r\n\r\nEverything seems to have gone well at the meeting, the educational\r\nbusiness carried [i.e. a recommendation that natural science be made a\r\npart of the curriculum in the public schools], and the anthropologers\r\nmaking fools of themselves in a most effectual way. So that I do not\r\nfeel that I have anything to reproach myself with for being absent.\r\n\r\nI am very pleased to hear of the reconciliation with Thomson and Tait.\r\nThe mode of it speaks well for them, and the fact will remove a certain\r\nsource of friction from amongst the cogs of your mental machinery.\r\n\r\n[The following gives the reason for his resigning the Fullerian\r\nlectureship:--]\r\n\r\nAthenaeum Club, May, 1867.\r\n\r\nMy dear Tyndall,\r\n\r\nA conversation I had with Bence Jones yesterday reminded me that I ought\r\nto have communicated with you. But we do not meet so often as we used to\r\ndo, being, I suppose, both very busy, and I forget to write.\r\n\r\nYou recollect that the last time we talked together, you mentioned a\r\nnotion of Bence Jones's to make the Fullerian Professorship of\r\nPhysiology a practically permanent appointment, and that I was quite\r\ninclined to stick by that (if such arrangement could be carried out),\r\nand give up other things.\r\n\r\nBut since I have been engaged in the present course of lectures I have\r\nfound reason to change my views. It is very hard work, and takes up\r\nevery atom of my time to make the lectures what they should be; and I\r\nfind that at this time of year, being more or less used up, I suppose,\r\nwith the winter work, I stand the worry and excitement of the actual\r\nlectures very badly. Add to this that it is six weeks clean gone out of\r\nthe only time I have disposable for real scientific progress, and you\r\nwill understand how it is that I have made up my mind to resign.\r\n\r\nI put all this clearly before Bence Jones yesterday, with the proviso\r\nthat I could and would do nothing that should embarrass the Institution\r\nor himself.\r\n\r\nIf there is the least difficulty in supplying my place, or if the\r\nmanagers think I shall deal shadily with them by resigning before the\r\nexpiration of my term, of course I go on. And I hope you all understand\r\nthat I would do anything rather than put even the appearance of a slight\r\nupon those who were kind enough to elect me.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[He found a substitute for 1868, the last year of the triennial course,\r\nin Dr. (now Sir) Michael Foster. Of his final lectures in 1867 he used\r\nto tell a story against himself.]\r\n\r\nIn my early period as a lecturer, I had very little confidence in my\r\ngeneral powers, but one thing I prided myself upon was clearness. I was\r\nonce talking of the brain before a large mixed audience, and soon began\r\nto feel that no one in the room understood me. Finally I saw the\r\nthoroughly interested face of a woman auditor, and took consolation in\r\ndelivering the remainder of the lecture directly to her. At the close,\r\nmy feeling as to her interest was confirmed when she came up and asked\r\nif she might put one question upon a single point which she had not\r\nquite understood. \"Certainly,\" I replied. \"Now, Professor,\" she said,\r\n\"is the cerebellum inside or outside the skull?\" (\"Reminiscences of T.H.\r\nHuxley\" by Professor H. Fairfield Osborn).\r\n\r\n[Dr. Foster used to add maliciously, that disgust at the small\r\nimpression he seemed to have made was the true reason for the\r\ntransference of the lectures.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.22.\r\n\r\n1868.\r\n\r\n[In 1868 he published five scientific memoirs, amongst them his\r\nclassification of birds and \"Remarks upon Archaeopteryx Lithographica\"\r\n(\"Proceedings of the Royal Society\" 16 1868 pages 243-248). This\r\ncreature, a bird with reptilian characters, was a suggestive object from\r\nwhich to popularise some of the far-reaching results of his many years'\r\nlabour upon the morphology of both birds and reptiles. Thus it led to a\r\nlecture at the Royal Institution, on February 7, \"On the Animals which\r\nare most nearly intermediate between Birds and Reptiles.\"\r\n\r\nOf this branch of work Sir M. Foster says: (Obituary Notice \"Proceedings\r\nof the Royal Society\" volume 59):--\r\n\r\nOne great consequence of these researches was that science was enriched\r\nby a clear demonstration of the many and close affinities between\r\nreptiles and birds, so that the two henceforward came to be known under\r\nthe joint title of Sauropsida, the amphibia being at the same time\r\ndistinctly more separated from the reptiles, and their relations to\r\nfishes more clearly signified by the joint title of Ichthyopsida. At the\r\nsame time, proof was brought forward that the line of descent of the\r\nSauropsida clearly diverged from that of the Mammalia, both starting\r\nfrom some common ancestry. And besides this great generalisation, the\r\nimportance of which, both from a classificatory and from an evolutional\r\npoint of view, needs no comment, there came out of the same researches\r\nnumerous lesser contributions to the advancement of morphological\r\nknowledge, including among others an attempt, in many respects\r\nsuccessful, at a classification of birds.\r\n\r\nThis work in connection with the reptilian ancestry of birds further\r\nappears in the paleontological papers published in 1869 upon the\r\nDinosaurs (see Chapter 23), and is referred to in a letter to Haeckel.\r\n\r\nHis Hunterian lectures on the Invertebrata appeared this year in the\r\n\"Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science\" (pages 126-129, and\r\n191-201), and in the October number of the same journal appeared his\r\nfamous article \"On some Organisms living at great depth in the North\r\nAtlantic Ocean,\" originally delivered before the British Association at\r\nNorwich in this year (1868). The sticky or viscid character of the fresh\r\nmud from the bottom of the Atlantic had already been noticed by Captain\r\nDayman when making soundings for the Atlantic cable. This stickiness was\r\napparently due to the presence of innumerable lumps of a transparent,\r\ngelatinous substance, consisting of minute granules without discoverable\r\nnucleus or membranous envelope, and interspersed with cretaceous\r\ncoccoliths. After a description of the structure of this substance and\r\nits chemical reactions, he makes a careful proviso against confounding\r\nthe statement of fact in the description and the interpretation which he\r\nproceeds to put upon these facts:--]\r\n\r\nI conceive that the granulate heaps and the transparent gelatinous\r\nmatter in which they are embedded represent masses of protoplasm. Take\r\naway the cysts which characterise the Radiolaria, and a dead Sphaerozoum\r\nwould very nearly represent one of this deep-sea \"Ur-schleim,\" which\r\nmust, I think, be regarded as a new form of those simple animated beings\r\nwhich have recently been so well described by Haeckel in his\r\n\"Monographie der Moneras\" page 210. [(See \"Collected Essays\" 5 153.)\r\n\r\nOf this he writes to Haeckel on October 6, 1868:--]\r\n\r\nThis paper] is about a new \"Moner\" which lies at the bottom of the\r\nAtlantic to all appearances, and gives rise to some wonderful calcified\r\nbodies. I have christened it Bathybius Haeckelii, and I hope that you\r\nwill not be ashamed of your god-child. I will send you some of the mud\r\nwith the paper.\r\n\r\n[The explanation was plausible enough on general grounds, if the\r\nevidence had been all that it seemed to be. But it must be noted that\r\nthe specimens examined by him and by Haeckel, who two years later\r\npublished a full and detailed description of Bathybius, were seen in a\r\npreserved state. Neither of them saw a fresh specimen, though on the\r\ncruise of the \"Porcupine,\" Sir Wyville Thomson and Dr. W. Carpenter\r\nexamined the substance in a fresh state, and found no better explanation\r\nto give of it. However, not only were the expectations that it was very\r\nwidely distributed over the Atlantic bottom, falsified in 1879 by the\r\nresearches of the \"Challenger\" expedition, but the behaviour of certain\r\ndeep-sea specimens gave good ground for suspecting that what had been\r\nsent home before as genuine deep-sea mud, was a precipitate due to the\r\naction on the specimens of the spirit in which they were preserved.\r\nThough Haeckel, with his special experience of Monera, refused to desert\r\nBathybius, a close parallel to which was found off Greenland in 1876,\r\nthe rest of its sponsors gave it up. Whatever it might be as a matter of\r\npossibility, the particular evidence upon which it had been described\r\nwas tainted. Once assured of this, Huxley characteristically took the\r\nbull by the horns. Without waiting for any one else to come forward, he\r\nmade public renunciation of Bathybius at the British Association in\r\n1879. The \"eating of the leek\" as recommended to his friend Dohrn (July\r\n7, 1868), was not merely a counsel for others, but was a prescription\r\nfollowed by himself on occasion:--]\r\n\r\nAs you know, I did not think you were on the right track with the\r\nArthropoda, and I am not going to profess to be sorry that you have\r\nfinally worked yourself to that conclusion.\r\n\r\nAs to the unlucky publication in the \"Journal of Anatomy and\r\nPhysiology,\" you have read your Shakespeare and know what is meant by\r\n\"eating a leek.\" Well, every honest man has to do that now and then, and\r\nI assure you that if eaten fairly and without grimaces, the devouring of\r\nthat herb has a very wholesome cooling effect on the blood, particularly\r\nin people of sanguine temperament.\r\n\r\nSeriously you must not mind a check of this kind.\r\n\r\n[This incident, one may suspect, was in his mind when he wrote in his\r\n\"Autobiography\" of the rapidity of thought characteristic of his\r\nmother:--]\r\n\r\nThat characteristic has been passed on to me in full strength; it has\r\noften stood me in good stead, it has sometimes played me sad tricks, and\r\nit has always been a danger.\r\n\r\n[At the Norwich meeting of the Association he also delivered his\r\nwell-known lecture to working men \"On a Piece of Chalk,\" a perfect\r\nexample of the handling of a common and trivial subject, so as to make\r\nit] \"a window into the Infinite.\" [He was particularly interested in the\r\nsuccess of the meeting, as his friend Hooker was President, and writes\r\nto Darwin, September 12:--]\r\n\r\nWe had a capital meeting at Norwich, and dear old Hooker came out in\r\ngreat force as he always does in emergencies.\r\n\r\nThe only fault was the terrible \"Darwinismus\" which spread over the\r\nsection and crept out when you least expected it, even in Fergusson's\r\nlecture on \"Buddhist Temples.\"\r\n\r\nYou will have the rare happiness to see your ideas triumphant during\r\nyour lifetime.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I am preparing to go into opposition; I can't stand it.\r\n\r\n[This lecture \"On a Piece of Chalk,\" together with two others delivered\r\nthis year, seem to me to mark the maturing of his style into that\r\nmastery of clear expression for which he deliberately laboured, the\r\nsaying exactly what he meant, neither too much nor too little, without\r\nconfusion and without obscurity. Have something to say, and say it, was\r\nthe Duke of Wellington's theory of style; Huxley's was to say that which\r\nhas to be said in such language that you can stand cross-examination on\r\neach word. Be clear, though you may be convicted of error. If you are\r\nclearly wrong, you will run up against a fact some time and get set\r\nright. If you shuffle with your subject, and study chiefly to use\r\nlanguage which will give a loophole of escape either way, there is no\r\nhope for you.\r\n\r\nThis was the secret of his lucidity. In no one could Buffon's aphorism\r\non style find a better illustration, \"Le style c'est l'homme meme.\" In\r\nhim science and literature, too often divorced, were closely united; and\r\nliterature owes him a debt for importing into it so much of the highest\r\nscientific habit of mind; for showing that truthfulness need not be\r\nbald, and that real power lies more in exact accuracy than in luxuriance\r\nof diction. Years after, no less an authority than Spedding, in a letter\r\nupon the influence of Bacon on his own style in the matter of\r\nexactitude, the pruning of fine epithets and sweeping statements, the\r\nreduction of numberless superlatives to positives, asserted that, if as\r\na young man he had fallen in with Huxley's writings before Bacon's, they\r\nwould have produced the same effect upon him.\r\n\r\nOf the other two discourses referred to, one is the opening address\r\nwhich he delivered as Principal at the South London Working Men's\r\nCollege on January 4, \"A Liberal Education, and Where to Find It.\" This\r\nis not a brief for science to the exclusion of other teaching; no essay\r\nhas insisted more strenuously on the evils of a one-sided education,\r\nwhether it be classical or scientific; but it urged the necessity for a\r\nstrong tincture of science and her method, if the modern conception of\r\nthe world, created by the spread of natural knowledge, is to be fairly\r\nunderstood. If culture is the \"criticism of life,\" it is fallacious if\r\ndeprived of knowledge of the most important factor which has transformed\r\nthe medieval into the modern spirit.\r\n\r\nTwo of his most striking passages are to be found in this address; one\r\nthe simile of the force behind nature as the hidden chess player; the\r\nother the noble description of the end of a true education.\r\n\r\nWell known as it is, I venture to quote the latter as an instance of his\r\nstyle:--]\r\n\r\nThat man, I think, has had a liberal education, who has been so trained\r\nin youth that his body is the ready servant of his will, and does with\r\nease and pleasure all the work that as a mechanism it is capable of;\r\nwhose intellect is a clear cold logic engine, with all its parts of\r\nequal strength, and in smooth working order; ready, like a steam engine,\r\nto be turned to any kind of work, and spin the gossamers as well as\r\nforge the anchors of the mind; whose mind is stored with a knowledge of\r\nthe great and fundamental truths of nature and of the laws of her\r\noperations; one who, no stunted ascetic, is full of life and fire, but\r\nwhose passions are trained to come to heel by a vigorous will, the\r\nservant of a tender conscience; who has learned to love all beauty,\r\nwhether of nature or of art, to hate all vileness, and to respect others\r\nas himself.\r\n\r\nSuch an one and no other, I conceive, has had a liberal education, for\r\nhe is, as completely as a man can be, in harmony with nature. He will\r\nmake the best of her, and she of him. They will get on together rarely;\r\nshe as his ever-beneficent mother; he as her mouth-piece, her conscious\r\nself, her minister and interpreter.\r\n\r\n[The third of these discourses is the address \"On the Physical Basis of\r\nLife,\" of which he writes to Haeckel on January 20, 1869:--]\r\n\r\nYou will be amused to hear that I went to the holy city, Edinburgh\r\nitself, the other day, for the purpose of giving the first of a series\r\nof Sunday lectures. I came back without being stoned; but Murchison (who\r\nis a Scotchman you know), told me he thought it was the boldest act of\r\nmy life. The lecture will be published in February, and I shall send it\r\nto you, as it contains a criticism of materialism which I should like\r\nyou to consider.\r\n\r\n[In it he explains in popular form a striking generalisation of\r\nscientific research, namely, that whether in animals or plants, the\r\nstructural unit of the living body is made up of similar material, and\r\nthat vital action and even thought are ultimately based upon molecular\r\nchanges in this life-stuff. Materialism! gross and brutal materialism!\r\nwas the mildest comment he expected in some quarters; and he took the\r\nopportunity to explain how he held] \"this union of materialistic\r\nterminology with the repudiation of materialistic philosophy,\"\r\n[considering the latter] \"to involve grave philosophic error.\"\r\n\r\n[His expectations were fully justified; in fact, he writes that some\r\npersons seemed to imagine that he had invented protoplasm for the\r\npurposes of the lecture.\r\n\r\nHere, too, in the course of a reply to Archbishop Thompson's confusion\r\nof the spirit of modern thought with the system of M. Comte, he launched\r\nhis well-known definition of Comtism as Catholicism MINUS Christianity,\r\nwhich involved him in a short controversy with Mr. Congreve (see \"The\r\nScientific Aspects of Positivism,\" \"Lay Sermons\" page 162), and with\r\nanother leading Positivist, who sent him a letter through Mr. Darwin.\r\nHuxley replied:--]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, March 11, 1869.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nI know quite enough of Mr. -- to have paid every attention to what he\r\nhas to say, even if you had not been his ambassador.\r\n\r\nI glanced over his letter when I returned home last night very tired\r\nwith my two nights' chairmanship at the Ethnological and the Geological\r\nSocieties.\r\n\r\nMost of it is fair enough, though I must say not helping me to any novel\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nTwo paragraphs, however, contained opinions which Mr. -- is at perfect\r\nliberty to entertain, but not, I think, to express to me.\r\n\r\nThe one is, that I shaped what I had to say at Edinburgh with a view of\r\nstirring up the prejudices of the Scotch Presbyterians (imagine how many\r\nPresbyterians I had in my audiences!) against Comte.\r\n\r\nThe other is the concluding paragraph, in which Mr. -- recommends me to\r\n\"READ COMTE,\" clearly implying that I have criticised Comte without\r\nreading him.\r\n\r\nYou will know how far I am likely to have committed either of the\r\nimmoralities thus laid to my charge.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I do not think I care to enter into more direct relations\r\nwith anyone who so heedlessly and unjustifiably assumes me to be guilty\r\nof them. Therefore I shall content myself with acknowledging the receipt\r\nof Mr. --'s letter through you.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, March 17, 1869.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nAfter I had sent my letter to you the other day I thought how stupid I\r\nhad been not to put in a slip of paper to say it was meant for --'s\r\nedification.\r\n\r\nI made sure you would understand that I wished it to be sent on, and\r\nwrote it (standing on the points of my toes and with my tail up very\r\nstiff) with that end in view.\r\n\r\n[Sketch of two dogs bristling up.]\r\n\r\nI am getting so weary of people writing to propose controversy to me\r\nupon one point or another, that I begin to wish the article had never\r\nbeen written. The fighting in itself is not particularly objectionable,\r\nbut it's the waste of time.\r\n\r\nI begin to understand your sufferings over the \"Origin.\" A good book is\r\ncomparable to a piece of meat, and fools are as flies who swarm to it,\r\neach for the purpose of depositing and hatching his own particular\r\nmaggot of an idea.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[A little later he wrote to Charles Kingsley, who had supported him in\r\nthe controversy:--]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, April 12, 1869.\r\n\r\nMy dear Kingsley,\r\n\r\nThanks for your hearty bottle-holding.\r\n\r\nCongreve is no better than a donkey to take the line he does. I studied\r\nComte, \"Philosophie,\" \"Politique,\" and all sixteen years ago, and having\r\nformed my judgment about him, put it into one of the pigeon holes of my\r\nbrain (about the H[ippocampus] minor [see above.]), and there let it\r\nrest till it was wanted.\r\n\r\nYou are perfectly right in saying that Comte knew nothing about physical\r\nscience--it is one of the points I am going to put in evidence.\r\n\r\nThe law of the three states is mainly evolved from his own\r\nconsciousness, and is only a bad way of expressing that tendency to\r\npersonification which is inherent in man.\r\n\r\nThe Classification of Sciences is bosh--as Spencer has already shown.\r\n\r\nNothing short of madness, however, can have dictated Congreve's\r\nchallenge of my admiration of Comte as a man at the end of his article.\r\nDid you ever read Littre's \"Life of Comte?\" I bought it when it came out\r\na year or more ago, and I rose from its perusal with a feeling of sheer\r\ndisgust and contempt for the man who could treat a noble-hearted woman\r\nwho had saved his life and his reason, as Comte treated his wife.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I have time I will deal with Comte effectually, you may\r\ndepend upon that. At the same time, I shall endeavour to be just to what\r\nthere is (as I hold), really great and good in his clear conception of\r\nthe necessity of reconstructing society from the bottom to the top \"sans\r\ndieu ni roi,\" if I may interpret that somewhat tall phrase as meaning\r\n\"with our conceptions of religion and politics on a scientific basis.\"\r\n\r\nComte in his later days was an apostate from his own creed; his \"nouveau\r\ngrand Etre supreme,\" being as big a fetish as ever nigger first made and\r\nthen worshipped.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[It is interesting to note how he invariably submitted his writings to\r\nthe criticism of his wife before they were seen by any other eye. To her\r\njudgment was due the toning down of many a passage which erred by excess\r\nof vigour, and the clearing up of phrases which would be obscure to the\r\npublic. In fact, if an essay met with her approval, he felt sure it\r\nwould not fail of its effect when published. Writing to her from Norwich\r\non August 23, 1868, he confesses himself with reference to the lecture\r\n\"On a Piece of Chalk\":--]\r\n\r\nI met Grove who edits \"Macmillan,\" at the soiree. He pulled the proof of\r\nmy lecture out of his pocket and said, \"Look here, there is one\r\nparagraph in your lecture I can make neither top nor tail of. I can't\r\nunderstand what it means.\" I looked to where his finger pointed, and\r\nbehold it was the paragraph you objected to when I read you the lecture\r\non the sea shore! I told him, and said I should confess, however set up\r\nit might make you.\r\n\r\n[At the beginning of September, he rejoined his wife and family at\r\nLittlehampton,] \"a grand place for children, because you go UP rather\r\nthan DOWN into the sea, and it is quite impossible for them to get into\r\nmischief by falling,\" [as he described it to his friend Dr. Dohrn, who\r\ncame down for ten days, eagerly looking forward \"to stimulating walks\r\nover stock and stone, to Tennyson, Herbert Spencer, and Harry's ringing\r\nlaugh.\"\r\n\r\nThe latter half of the month he spent at or near Dublin, serving upon\r\nthe Commission on Science and Art Instruction:--]\r\n\r\nToday [he writes on  September 16], we shall be occupied in inspecting\r\nthe School of Science and the Glasnevin botanical and agricultural\r\ngardens, and to-morrow we begin the session work of examining all the\r\nIrishry, who want jobs perpetrated. It is weary work, and the papers are\r\nalready beginning to tell lies about us and attack us.\r\n\r\n[The rest of the year he remained in London, except the last four days\r\nof December, when he was lecturing at Newcastle, and stayed with Sir W.\r\nArmstrong at Jesmond.]\r\n\r\n[To Professor Haeckel.]\r\n\r\nJanuary 21, 1868.\r\n\r\nDon't you think we did a right thing in awarding the Copley Medal to\r\nBaer last year? The old man was much pleased, and it was a comfort to me\r\nto think that we had not let him go to his grave without the highest\r\nhonour we had to bestow.\r\n\r\nI am over head and ears, as we say, in work, lecturing, giving addresses\r\nto the working men and (figurez vous!) to the clergy. [On December 12,\r\n1867, there was a meeting of clergy at Sion House, under the auspices of\r\nDean Farrar and the Reverend W. Rogers of Bishopsgate, when the bearing\r\nof recent science upon orthodox dogma was discussed. First Huxley\r\ndelivered an address; some of the clergy present denounced any\r\nconcessions as impossible; others declared that they had long ago\r\naccepted the teachings of geology; whereupon a candid friend inquired,\r\n\"Then why don't you say so from your pulpits?\" (See \"Collected Essays\" 3\r\n119.)]\r\n\r\nIn scientific work the main thing just now about which I am engaged is a\r\nrevision of the Dinosauria, with an eye to the \"Descendenz Theorie.\" The\r\nroad from Reptiles to Birds is by way of Dinosauria to the Ratitae. The\r\nbird \"phylum\" was struthious, and wings grew out of rudimentary\r\nforelimbs.\r\n\r\nYou see that among other things I have been reading Ernst Haeckel's\r\n\"Morphologie.\"\r\n\r\n[The next two letters reflect his views on the proper work to be\r\nundertaken by men of unusual scientific capacity:--]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, January 15, 1868.\r\n\r\nMy dear Dohrn,\r\n\r\nThough the most procrastinating correspondent in existence when a letter\r\ndoes not absolutely require an answer, I am tolerably well-behaved when\r\nsomething needs to be said or done immediately. And as that appears to\r\nme to be the case with your letter of the 13th which has this moment\r\nreached me, I lose no time in replying to it.\r\n\r\nThe Calcutta appointment has been in my hands as well as Turner's, and I\r\nhave made two or three efforts, all of which unfortunately have proved\r\nunsuccessful to find: (1) A man who will do for it and at the same time\r\n(2) for whom it will do. Now you fulfil the first condition admirably,\r\nbut as to the second I have very great doubts.\r\n\r\nIn the first place the climate of Calcutta is not particularly good for\r\nanyone who has a tendency to dysentery, and I doubt very much if you\r\nwould stand it for six months.\r\n\r\nSecondly, we have a proverb that it is not wise to use razors to cut\r\nblocks.\r\n\r\nThe business of the man who is appointed to that museum will be to get\r\nit into order. If he does his duty he will give his time and attention\r\nto museum work pure and simple, and I don't think that (especially in an\r\nIndian climate), he has much energy left for anything else after the\r\nday's work is done. Naming and arranging specimens is a most admirable\r\nand useful employment, but when you have done it is \"cutting blocks,\"\r\nand you, my friend, are a most indubitable razor, and I do not wish to\r\nhave your edge blunted in that fashion.\r\n\r\nIf it were necessary for you to win your own bread, one's advice might\r\nbe modified. Under such circumstances one must do things which are not\r\nentirely desirable. But for you who are your own master and have a\r\ncareer before you, to bind yourself down to work six hours a day at\r\nthings you do not care about and which others could do just as well,\r\nwhile you are neglecting the things which you do care for, and which\r\nothers could not do so well, would, I think, be amazingly unwise.\r\n\r\nLiberavi animam! don't tell my Indian friends I have dissuaded you, but\r\non my conscience I could give you no other advice.\r\n\r\nWe have to thank you three times over. In the first place for a portrait\r\nwhich has taken its place among those of our other friends; secondly for\r\nthe great pleasure you gave my little daughter Jessie, by the books you\r\nso kindly sent; and thirdly, for Fanny Lewald's autobiography which\r\narrived a few days ago.\r\n\r\nJessie is meditating a letter of thanks (a serious undertaking), and\r\nwhen it is sent the mother will have a word to say for herself.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of October scarlet fever broke out among my children, and\r\nthey have all had it in succession, except Jessie, who took it seven\r\nyears ago. The last convalescent is now well, but we had the disease in\r\nthe house nearly three months, and have been like lepers, cut off from\r\nall communication with our neighbours for that time.\r\n\r\nWe have had a great deal of anxiety, and my wife has been pretty nearly\r\nworn out with nursing day and night; but by great good fortune \"the\r\nhappy family\" has escaped all permanent injury, and you might hear as\r\nmuch laughter in the house as at Swanage.\r\n\r\nWill you be so kind as to thank Professor Gegenbaur for a paper on the\r\ndevelopment of the vertebral column of Lepidosteum I have just received\r\nfrom him? He has been writing about the process of ossification and the\r\n\"deck-knochen\" question, but I cannot make out exactly where. Could you\r\nlet me know?\r\n\r\nI am anxious for the \"Arthropoden Werk,\" but I expect to gasp when it\r\ncomes.\r\n\r\nTurn to page 380 of the new edition of our friend Kolliker's \"Handbuch,\"\r\nand you will find that though a view which I took off the \"organon\r\nadamantinae\" some twelve or fourteen years ago, and which Kolliker has\r\nup to this time repudiated, turns out, and is now admitted by him, to be\r\nperfectly correct, yet \"that I was not acquainted with the facts that\r\nwould justify the conclusion.\" Really, if I had time I could be angry.\r\n\r\nPray remember me most kindly to Haeckel, to all whose enemies I wish\r\nconfusion, and believe me, ever yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have read a hundred pages or so of Fanny Lewald's first Bd., and\r\nam delighted with her insight into child-life.\r\n\r\n[Tyndall was resigning his lectureship at the School of Mines:--]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, June 10, 1868.\r\n\r\nMy dear Tyndall,\r\n\r\nAll I can say is, I am heartily sorry.\r\n\r\nIf you feel that your lectures here interfere with your original work, I\r\nshould not be a true friend either to science or yourself if I said a\r\nword against your leaving us.\r\n\r\nBut for all that I am and shall remain very sorry.\r\n\r\nEver yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nT.H.

But at present I am rather disposed to d--n anyone who\r\noccupies your place.\r\n\r\n[The following extract is from a letter to Haeckel (November 13, 1868),\r\nwith reference to the proposed translation of his \"Morphologie\" by the\r\nRay Society:--]\r\n\r\nWe shall at once look out for a good translator of the text, as the job\r\nwill be a long and a tough one. My wife (who sends her best wishes and\r\ncongratulations on your fatherhood) will do the bits of Goethe's poetry,\r\nand I will look after the prose citations.\r\n\r\nNext as to the text itself. The council were a little alarmed at the\r\nbulk of the book, and it is of the utmost importance that it would be\r\ncondensed to the uttermost.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, English propriety had taken fright at rumours touching the\r\naggressive heterodoxy of some passages. (We do not much mind heterodoxy\r\nhere, if it does not openly proclaim itself as such.)\r\n\r\nAnd on both these points I had not only to give very distinct\r\nassurances, such as I thought your letters had entitled me to give; but\r\nin a certain sense to become myself responsible for your behaving\r\nyourself like a good boy!\r\n\r\nIf I had not known you and understood your nature and disposition as I\r\nfancy I do, I should not have allowed myself to be put in this position;\r\nbut I have implicit faith in your doing what is wise and right, and so\r\nmaking it tenable.\r\n\r\nThere is not the slightest desire to make you mutilate your book or\r\nleave out anything which you conceive to be absolutely essential; and I\r\non my part should certainly not think of asking you to make any\r\nalteration which would not in my judgment improve the book quite\r\nirrespectively of the tastes of the British public.\r\n\r\n[Alterations are suggested.] But I stop. By this time you will be\r\nswearing at me for attacking all your favourite bits. Let me know what\r\nyou think about these matters.\r\n\r\nI congratulate you and Madame Haeckel heartily on the birth of your boy.\r\nChildren work a greater metamorphosis in men than any other condition of\r\nlife. They ripen one wonderfully and make life ten times better worth\r\nhaving than it was.\r\n\r\n26 Abbey Place, November 15, 1868.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nYou are always the bienvenu, and we shall be right glad to see you on\r\nSunday morning.\r\n\r\nWe breakfast at 8.30, and the decks are clear before nine. I would offer\r\nyou breakfast, but I know it does not suit you to come out unfed; and\r\nbesides you would abuse the opportunity to demoralise Harry. [This small\r\nboy of nearly four was a great favourite of Darwin's. When we children\r\nwere all staying at Down about this time, Darwin himself would come in\r\nupon us at dinner, and patting him on the head, utter what was become a\r\nhousehold word amongst us, \"Make yourself at home, and take large\r\nmouthfuls.\"]\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[An undated note to Darwin belongs to the very end of this year, or to\r\nthe beginning of the next:--]\r\n\r\nThe two volumes of the new book have just reached me. My best thanks for\r\nthem; and if you can only send me a little time for reading within the\r\nnext three months you will heighten the obligation twenty-fold. I wish I\r\nhad either two heads or a body that needed no rest!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.23.\r\n\r\n1869.\r\n\r\n[In 1869 Huxley published five paleontological papers, chiefly upon the\r\nDinosaurs (see letter above to Haeckel, January 21, 1868). His\r\nphysiological researches upon the development of parts of the skull, are\r\nrepresented by a paper for the Zoological Society, while the\r\n\"Introduction to the Classification of Animals\" was a reprint this year\r\nof the substance of six lectures in the first part of the lectures on\r\n\"Elementary Comparative Anatomy\" (1864), which were out of print, but\r\nstill in demand by students.\r\n\r\nAs President of the Ethnological Society, he delivered an inaugural\r\naddress \"On the Ethnology and Archeology of India,\" on March 9, and\r\nanother \"On the Ethnology and Archeology of North America,\" on April 13.\r\nAs president of the Society, moreover, he urged upon the Government the\r\nadvisability of forming a systematic series of photographs of the\r\nvarious races comprehended in the British Empire, and was officially\r\ncalled upon to offer suggestions for carrying out the project. This\r\nappears to be an amplification of Sir Joseph Fayrer's plan in 1866, with\r\nrespect to all the tribes of India (see Appendix 1.)\r\n\r\nOn April 7 he delivered his \"Scientific Education: Notes of an\r\nAfter-Dinner Speech\" before the Philomathic Society at Liverpool\r\n(\"Collected Essays\" 3 3), one part of which deals with the attitude of\r\nthe clergy towards physical science, and expresses the necessary\r\nantagonism between science and Roman Catholic doctrine which appears\r\nmore forcibly in one of his speeches at the School Board in 1871.\r\n\r\nIn this and other educational addresses, he had suggested that one of\r\nthe best ways of imparting to children a preliminary knowledge of the\r\nphenomena of nature would be a course of what the Germans call\r\n\"Erdkunde,\" or general information about the world we live in. It should\r\nreach from our simplest everyday observations to wide generalisations of\r\nphysical science; and should supply a background for the study of\r\nhistory. To this he gave the name \"Physiography,\" a name which he\r\nbelieved to be original, until in 1877 his attention was called to the\r\nfact that a \"Physiographie\" had been published in Paris thirty years\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe idea was no new one with him. Part of his preliminary lectures at\r\nthe School of Mines had been devoted to something of the kind for the\r\nlast dozen years; he had served on the Committee of the British\r\nAssociation, appointed in 1866 as the result of a paper by the present\r\nDean Farrar, then a Harrow master, \"On the Teaching of Science in the\r\nPublic Schools,\" to report upon the whole question. Moreover, in\r\nconsultation with Dr. Tyndall, he had drawn up a scheme in the winter\r\n1868-69, for the science teaching in the International College, on the\r\nCouncil of which they both were.\r\n\r\nSeven yearly grades were arranged in this scheme, proceeding from the\r\nsimplest account of the phenomena of nature taught chiefly by object\r\nlessons, largely through the elements of Physics and Botany, Chemistry\r\nand Human Physiology--all illustrated with practical demonstrations--to\r\nmore advanced work in these subjects, as well as in Social Science,\r\nwhich embraced not only the theory of commerce and government, but the\r\nNatural History of Man up to the point at which Ethnology and Archeology\r\ntouch history.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the framers of this report thought it\r\nnecessary to point out that one master could not teach all these\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nIn the three later stages the boys might follow alternative lines of\r\nstudy according to their tastes and capacities; but of the earlier part,\r\nwhich was to be obligatory upon all, the report says:--These four years\r\nstudy, if properly employed by the teachers, will constitute a complete\r\npreparatory scientific course. However slight the knowledge of details\r\nconferred, a wise teacher of any of these subjects will be able to make\r\nthat teaching thorough; and to give the scholar a notion of the methods\r\nand of the ideas which he will meet with in his further progress in all\r\nbranches of physical science.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the fundamental principle was to begin with Observational\r\nScience, facts collected; to proceed to Classificatory Science, facts\r\narranged; and to end with Inductive Science, facts reasoned upon and\r\nlaws deduced.\r\n\r\nWhile he was much occupied with the theoretical and practical\r\ndifficulties of such a scheme of science teaching for general use, he\r\nwas asked by his friend, the Reverend W. Rogers of Bishopsgate, if he\r\nwould not deliver a course of lectures on elementary science to boys of\r\nthe schools in which the latter was interested.\r\n\r\nHe finally accepted in the following letter, and as the result,\r\ndelivered twelve lectures week by week from April to June to a large\r\naudience at the London Institution in Finsbury Circus, lectures not\r\neasily forgotten by the children who listened to them nor by their\r\nelders:--]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, February 5, 1869.\r\n\r\nMy dear Rogers,\r\n\r\nUpon due reflection I am not indisposed to undertake the course of\r\nlessons we talked about the other day, though they will cost me a good\r\ndeal of trouble in various ways, and at a time of the year when I am\r\ngetting to the end of my tether and don't much like trouble.\r\n\r\nBut the scheme is too completely in harmony with what (in conjunction\r\nwith Tyndall and others) I have been trying to bring about in schools in\r\ngeneral--not to render it a great temptation to me to try to get it into\r\npractical shape.\r\n\r\nAll I have to stipulate is that we shall have a clear understanding on\r\nthe part of the boys and teachers that the discourses are to [be]\r\nLESSONS and not talkee-talkee lectures. I should like it to be\r\nunderstood that the boys are to take notes and to be examined at the end\r\nof the course. Of course I cannot undertake to be examiner, but the\r\nschools might make some arrangement on this point.\r\n\r\nYou see my great object is to set going something which can be worked in\r\nevery school in the country in a thorough and effectual way, and set an\r\nexample of the manner in which I think this sort of introduction to\r\nscience ought to be managed.\r\n\r\nUnless this can be done I would rather not embark in a project which\r\nwill involve much labour, worry, and interruption to my regular line of\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nI met Mr. [illegible] last night, and discussed the subject briefly with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nI enclose a sort of rough programme of the kind of thing I mean, cut up\r\nfrom a project of instruction for a school about which I am now busy.\r\nThe managers might like to see it. But I shall be glad to have it\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n[These lectures were repeated in November at South Kensington Museum, as\r\nthe first part of a threefold course to women on the elements of\r\nphysical science, and the \"Times\" reporter naively remarks that under\r\nthe rather alarming name of Physiography, many of the audience were no\r\ndoubt surprised to hear an exceedingly simple and lucid description of a\r\nriver-basin. Want of leisure prevented him from bringing out the\r\nlectures in book form until November 1877. When it did appear, however,\r\nthe book, like his other popular works, had a wide sale, and became the\r\nforerunner of an immense number of school-books on the subject.\r\n\r\nAs President of the Geological Society, he delivered an address\r\n(\"Collected Essays\" 8 305), at the anniversary meeting, February 19,\r\nupon the \"Geological Reform\" demanded by the considerations advanced by\r\nthe physicists, as to the age of the earth and the duration of life upon\r\nit. From the point of view of biology he was ready to accept the limits\r\nsuggested, provided that the premises of Sir William Thomson's (Now Lord\r\nKelvin.) argument were shown to be perfectly reliable; but he pointed\r\nout a number of considerations which might profoundly modify the results\r\nof the isolated causes adduced; and uttered a warning against the\r\npossible degradation of \"a proper reverence for mathematical certainty\"\r\ninto \"a superstitious respect for all arguments arrived at by process of\r\nmathematics.\" (See \"Collected Essays\" 8 Introduction page 8.)\r\n\r\nAt the close of the year, as his own period of office came to an end, it\r\nwas necessary to select a new president of the Geological. He strongly\r\nurged Professor (afterwards Sir Joseph) Prestwich to stand, and when the\r\nlatter consented, a few weeks, by the way, before his marriage was to\r\ntake place, replied:--]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, December 16, 1869.\r\n\r\nMy dear Prestwich,\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your letter. Your consent to become our President for\r\nthe next period will give as unfeigned satisfaction to the whole body of\r\nthe Society as it does to me and your other personal friends.\r\n\r\nI have looked upon the affair as settled since our last talk, and a very\r\ngreat relief it has been to my mind.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt public-dinner speaking (and indeed all public\r\nspeaking) is nervous work. I funk horribly, though I never get the least\r\ncredit for it. But it is like swimming, the worst of it is in the first\r\nplunge; and after you have taken your \"header\" it's not so bad (just\r\nlike matrimony, by the way; only don't be so mean as to go and tell a\r\ncertain lady I said so, because I want to stand well in her books.)\r\n\r\nOf course you may command me in all ways in which I can possibly be of\r\nuse. But as one of the chiefs of the Society, and personally and\r\nscientifically popular with the whole body, you start with an immense\r\nadvantage over me, and will find no difficulties before you.\r\n\r\nWe will consider this business formally settled, and I shall speak of it\r\nofficially.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[I cannot place the following letter to Matthew Arnold with certainty,\r\nbut it must have been written about this period. (The most probable date\r\nbeing 1869, for on July 1 of that year he dined with Matthew Arnold at\r\nHarrow.) Everyone will sympathise with the situation:--]\r\n\r\n26 Abbey Place, July 8.\r\n\r\nMy dear Arnold,\r\n\r\nLook at Bishop Wilson on the sin of covetousness and then inspect your\r\numbrella stand. You will there see a beautiful brown smooth-handled\r\numbrella which is NOT your property.\r\n\r\nThink of what the excellent prelate would have advised and bring it with\r\nyou next time you come to the club. The porter will take care of it for\r\nme.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The following letter shows how paleontological work was continually\r\npouring in upon him:--]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, May 7, 1869.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nDo you recollect recommending that the \"Nassau,\" which sailed under\r\nCaptain Mayne's command for Magellan's Straits some years ago should\r\nexplore a fossiliferous deposit at the Gallegos River?\r\n\r\nThey visited the place the other day as you will see by Cunningham's\r\nletter which I enclose, and got some fossils which are now in my hands.\r\n\r\nThe skull to which Cunningham refers, consists of little more than the\r\njaws, but luckily nearly all the teeth are in place, and prove it to be\r\nan entirely new ungulate mammal with teeth in uninterrupted series like\r\nAnoplotherium, about as big as a small horse.\r\n\r\nWhat a wonderful assemblage of beasts there seems to have been in South\r\nAmerica! I suspect if we could find them all they would make the\r\nclassification of the Mammalia into a horrid mess.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[And on July 16, 1869, he writes again to Darwin:--]\r\n\r\nTo tell you the truth, what with fossils, Ethnology and the great\r\nquestion of \"Darwinismus\" which is such a worry to us all, I have lost\r\nsight of the collectors and naturalists \"by grace of the dredge,\" almost\r\nas completely as you have.\r\n\r\n[Indeed, the pressure was so great that he resolved to give up the\r\nHunterian Lectures at the College of Surgeons, as he had already given\r\nup the Fullerian Professorship at the Royal Institution. So he writes to\r\nProfessor (afterwards Sir William) Flower:--]\r\n\r\nJermyn Street, June 7, 1869.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE, CONFIDENTIAL, PARTICULAR.\r\n\r\nMy dear Flower,\r\n\r\nI have written to Quain [President of the Royal College of Surgeons.] to\r\ntell him that I do not propose to be put in nomination for the Hunterian\r\nChair this year. I really cannot stand it with the British Association\r\nhanging over my head. So make thy shoulders ready for the gown, and\r\npractise the goose-step in order to march properly behind the mace, and\r\nI will come and hear your inaugural.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The meeting of the Association to which he refers took place at Exeter,\r\nand he writes of it to Darwin (September 28):--]\r\n\r\nAs usual, your abominable heresies were the means of getting me into all\r\nsorts of hot water at the Association. Three parsons set upon you, and\r\nif you were the most malicious of men you could not have wished them to\r\nhave made greater fools of themselves than they did. They got\r\nconsiderably chaffed, and that was all they were worth. [(It is perhaps\r\nscarcely worth while exhuming these long-forgotten arguments in their\r\nentirety; but anyone curious enough to consult the report of the meeting\r\npreserved in the files of the \"Academy,\" will find, among other things,\r\nan entirely novel theory as to the relation of the Cherubim to\r\nterrestrial creation.)\r\n\r\nAnd to Tyndall, whom an accident had kept in Switzerland:--]\r\n\r\nAfter a sharp fight for Edinburgh, Liverpool was adopted as the place of\r\nmeeting for the Association of 1870, and I am to be President; although\r\nthe \"Times\" says that my best friends tremble for me. (I hope you are\r\nnot among that particular lot of my best friends.)\r\n\r\nI think we shall have a good meeting, and you know you are pledged to\r\ngive a lecture even if you come with your leg in a sling.\r\n\r\n[The foundation of the Metaphysical Society in 1869 was not without\r\ninterest as a sign of the times. As in the new birth of thought which\r\nput a period to the Middle Ages, so in the Victorian Renaissance, a vast\r\nintellectual ferment had taken immediate shape in a fierce struggle with\r\nlong established orthodoxy. But whereas Luther displaced Erasmus, and\r\nthe earlier reformers fought out the quarrel with the weapons of the\r\ntheologian rather than those of the Humanist, the latter-day reformation\r\nwas based upon the extension of the domain of positive science, upon the\r\nforce of historical criticism, and the sudden reorganisation of\r\naccumulated knowledge in the light of a physical theory adequate to\r\nexplain it.\r\n\r\nThese new facts and the new or re-vivified theories based upon them,\r\nremained to be reckoned with after the first storm of denunciation had\r\npassed by, and the meeting at Sion House in 1867 showed that some at\r\nleast of the English clergy besides Colenso and Stanley wished to\r\nunderstand the real meaning of the new movement. Although the wider\r\neffect of the scientific revival in modifying theological doctrine was\r\nnot yet fully apparent, the irreconcilables grew fewer and less noisy,\r\nwhile the injustice of their attempts to stifle the new doctrine and to\r\nostracise its supporters became more glaring.\r\n\r\nThus among the supporters of the old order of thought, there was one\r\nsection more or less ready to learn of the new. Another, seeing that the\r\ndoctrines of which they were firmly convinced were thrust aside by the\r\nrapid advance of the new school, thought, as men not unnaturally think\r\nin the like situation, that the latter did not duly weigh what was said\r\non their side. Hence this section eagerly entered into the proposal to\r\nfound a society which should bring together men of diverse views, and\r\neffect, as they hoped, by personal discussion of the great questions at\r\nissue, in the manner and with the machinery of the learned societies, a\r\nrapprochement unattainable by written debate.\r\n\r\nThe scheme was first propounded by Mr. James Knowles, then editor of the\r\n\"Contemporary Review,\" now of the \"Nineteenth Century,\" in conversation\r\nwith Tennyson and Professor Pritchard (Savilian Professor of Astronomy\r\nat Oxford).\r\n\r\nThus the Society came to be composed of men of the most opposite ways of\r\nthinking and of very various occupations in life. The largest group was\r\nthat of churchmen:--ecclesiastical dignitaries such as Thompson, the\r\nArchbishop of York, Ellicott, Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol, and Dean\r\nAlford; staunch laymen such as Mr. Gladstone, Lord Selborne, and the\r\nDuke of Argyll; while the liberal school was represented by Dean\r\nStanley, F.D. Maurice, and Mark Pattison. Three distinguished converts\r\nfrom the English Church championed Roman Catholic doctrine--Cardinal\r\nManning, Father Dalgairns, and W.G. Ward, while Unitarianism claimed Dr.\r\nJames Martineau. At the opposite pole, in antagonism to Christian\r\ntheology and theism generally, stood Professor W.K. Clifford, whose\r\nyouthful brilliancy was destined to be cut short by an untimely death.\r\nPositivism was represented by Mr. Frederic Harrison; and Agnosticism by\r\nsuch men of science or letters as Huxley and Tyndall, Mr. John Morley,\r\nand Mr. Leslie Stephen.\r\n\r\nSomething was gained, too, by the variety of callings followed by the\r\ndifferent members. While there were professional students of philosophy,\r\nlike Professor Henry Sidgwick or Sir Alexander Grant, the Principal of\r\nEdinburgh University, in some the technical knowledge of philosophy was\r\noverlaid by studies in history or letters; in others, by the practical\r\nexperience of the law or politics; in others, again, medicine or biology\r\nsupplied a powerful psychological instrument. This fact tended to keep\r\nthe discussions in touch with reality on many sides.\r\n\r\nThere was Tennyson, for instance, the only poet who thoroughly\r\nunderstood the movement of modern science, a stately but silent member;\r\nMr. Ruskin, J.A. Froude, Shadworth Hodgson, R.H. Hutton of the\r\n\"Spectator,\" James Hinton, and the well-known essayist, W.R. Greg; Sir\r\nJames FitzJames Stephen, Sir F. Pollock, Robert Lowe (Lord Sherbrooke),\r\nSir M.E. Grant Duff, and Lord Arthur Russell; Sir John Lubbock, Dr. W.B.\r\nCarpenter, Sir William Gull, and Sir Andrew Clark.\r\n\r\nOf contemporary thinkers of the first rank, neither John Stuart Mill nor\r\nMr. Herbert Spencer joined the society. The letter of the former\r\ndeclining the invitation to join (given in the \"Life of W.G. Ward\" page\r\n299) is extremely characteristic. He considers the object of the\r\nprojectors very laudable, \"but it is very doubtful whether it will be\r\nrealised in practice.\" The undoubted advantages of oral discussion on\r\nsuch questions are, he continues, best realised if undertaken in the\r\nmanner of the Socratic dialogue, between one and one; but less so in a\r\nmixed assembly. He therefore did not think himself justified in joining\r\nthe society at the expense of other occupations for which his time was\r\nalready engaged. And he concludes by defending himself against the\r\ncharge of not paying fair attention to the arguments of his opponents.\r\n\r\nIt followed from the composition of the society that the papers read\r\nwere less commonly upon technical questions of metaphysics, such as\r\n\"Matter and Force\" or \"The Relation of Will to Thought,\" than upon those\r\nof more vivid moral or religious interest, such as \"What is Death?\" \"The\r\nTheory of a Soul,\" \"The Ethics of Belief,\" or \"Is God Unknowable,\" in\r\nwhich wide scope was given to the emotions as well as the intellect of\r\neach disputant.\r\n\r\nThe method of the Society was for the paper to be printed and circulated\r\namong the members before the meeting, so that their main criticisms were\r\nready in advance. The discussions took place after a dinner at which\r\nmany of the members would appear; and if the more formal debates were\r\nnot more effectual than predicted by J.S. Mill, the informal\r\ndiscussions, almost conversations, at smaller meetings, and the free\r\ncourse of talk at the dinner table, did something to realise the primary\r\nobjects of the society. The personal rapprochement took place, but not\r\nphilosophic compromise or conversion. Whether or not the tone adopted\r\nafter this period by the clerical party at large was affected by the\r\nbetter understanding on the part of their representatives in the\r\nMetaphysical Society of the true aims of their opponents and the honest\r\nand substantial difficulties which stood in the way of reunion, it is\r\ntrue that the violent denunciations of the sixties decreased in number\r\nand intensity; the right to free expression of reasoned opinion on\r\nserious fact was tacitly acknowledged; and, being less attacked, Huxley\r\nhimself began to be regarded in the light of a teacher rather than an\r\niconoclast. The question began to be not whether such opinions are\r\nwicked, but whether from the point of view of scientific method they are\r\nirrefragably true.\r\n\r\nThe net philosophical result of the society's work was to distinguish\r\nthe essential and the unessential differences between the opposite\r\nparties; the latter were to a great extent cleared up; but the former\r\nremained all the more clearly defined in logical nakedness for the\r\nremoval of the side issues and the personal idiosyncrasies which often\r\nobscured the main issues. Indeed, when this point was reached by both\r\nparties, when the origins and consequences of the fundamental principles\r\non either side had been fully discussed and mutual misunderstandings\r\nremoved to the utmost, so that only the fundamentals themselves remained\r\nin debate, there was nothing left to be done. The society, in fact, as\r\nHuxley expressed it,] \"died of too much love.\"\r\n\r\n[Indeed, it is to be noticed that, despite the strong antagonism of\r\nprinciple and deductions from principle which existed among the members,\r\nthe rule of mutual toleration was well kept. The state of feeling after\r\nten years' open struggle seemed likely to produce active collision\r\nbetween representatives of the opposing schools at close quarters.] \"We\r\nall thought it would be a case of Kilkenny cats,\" [said Huxley many\r\nyears afterwards.] \"Hats and coats would be left in the hall, but there\r\nwould be no owners left to put them on again.\" [But only one flash of\r\nthe sort was elicited. One of the speakers at an early meeting insisted\r\non the necessity of avoiding anything like moral disapprobation in the\r\ndebates. There was a pause; then W.G. Ward said: \"While acquiescing in\r\nthis condition as a general rule, I think it cannot be expected that\r\nChristian thinkers shall give no sign of the horror with which they\r\nwould view the spread of such extreme opinions as those advocated by Mr.\r\nHuxley.\" Another pause; then Huxley, thus challenged, replied: \"As Dr.\r\nWard has spoken, I must in fairness say that it will be very difficult\r\nfor me to conceal my feeling as to the intellectual degradation which\r\nwould come of the general acceptance of such views as Dr. Ward holds.\"\r\n(\"Life of W.G. Ward\" by Wilfrid Ward page 309.)\r\n\r\nNo amount of argument could have been more effectual in supporting the\r\nclaim for mutual toleration than those two speeches, and thenceforward\r\nsuch forms of criticism were conspicuous by their absence. And where\r\nhonesty of conviction was patent, mutual toleration was often replaced\r\nby personal esteem and regard. \"Charity, brotherly love,\" writes Huxley,\r\n\"were the chief traits of the Society. We all expended so much charity,\r\nthat, had it been money, we should every one have been bankrupt.\"\r\n\r\nThe special part played in the society by Huxley was to show that many\r\nof the axioms of current speculation are far from being axiomatic, and\r\nthat dogmatic assertion on some of the cardinal points of metaphysic is\r\nunwarranted by the evidence of fact. To find these seeming axioms set\r\naside as unproven, was, it appears from his \"Life,\" disconcerting to\r\nsuch members of the society as Cardinal Manning, whose arguments\r\ndepended on the unquestioned acceptance of them. It was no doubt the\r\nobservation of a similar attitude of mind in Mr. Gladstone towards\r\nmetaphysical problems which provoked Huxley to reply, when asked whether\r\nMr. Gladstone was an expert metaphysician--\"An expert in metaphysics? He\r\ndoes not know the meaning of the word.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to his share in the discussions, Huxley contributed three\r\npapers to the society. The first, read November 17, 1869, was on \"The\r\nviews of Hume, Kant, and Whately on the logical basis of the doctrine of\r\nthe Immortality of the Soul,\" showing that these thinkers agreed in\r\nholding that no such basis is given by reasoning, a part, for instance,\r\nfrom revelation. A summary of the argument appears in the essay on Hume\r\n(\"Collected Essays\" 6 201 sq.)\r\n\r\nOn November 8, 1870, he read a paper, \"Has a Frog a Soul? and if so, of\r\nwhat Nature is that Soul?\" Experiment shows that a frog deprived of\r\nconsciousness and volition by the removal of the front part of its\r\nbrain, will, under the action of various stimuli, perform many acts\r\nwhich can only be called purposive, such as moving to recover its\r\nbalance when the board on which it stands is inclined, or scratching\r\nwhere it is made uncomfortable, or croaking when pressed in a particular\r\nspot. If its spinal cord be severed, the lower limbs, disconnected from\r\nthe brain, will also perform actions of this kind. The question arises,\r\nIs the frog entirely a soulless automaton, performing all its actions\r\ndirectly in response to external stimuli, only more perfectly and with\r\nmore delicate adjustment when its brain remains intact, or is its soul\r\ndistributed along its spinal marrow, so that it can be divided into two\r\nparts independent of one another?\r\n\r\nThe professed metaphysician might perhaps tend to regard such\r\nconsideration as irrelevant; but if the starting-point of metaphysics is\r\nto be found in psychology, psychology itself depends to no small extent\r\nupon physiology. This question, however, Huxley did not pretend to\r\nsolve. In the existing state of knowledge he believed it to be\r\ninsoluble. But he thought it was not without its bearing upon the\r\nsupposed relations of soul and body in the human subject, and should\r\nserve to give pause to current theories on the matter.\r\n\r\nHis third paper, read January 11, 1876, was on the \"Evidence of the\r\nMiracle of the Resurrection,\" in which he argued that there was no valid\r\nevidence of actual death having taken place. His rejection of the\r\nmiraculous had led to an invitation from some of his opponents in the\r\nsociety to write a paper on a definite miracle, and explain his reasons\r\nfor not accepting it. His choice of subject was due to two reasons:\r\nfirstly, it was a cardinal instance; secondly, it was a miracle not\r\nworked by Christ Himself, and therefore a discussion of its genuineness\r\ncould offer no suggestion of personal fraud, and hence would avoid\r\ninflicting gratuitous pain upon believers in it.\r\n\r\nThis certainty that there exist many questions at present insoluble,\r\nupon which it is intellectually, and indeed morally wrong to assert that\r\nwe have real knowledge, had long been with him, but, although he had\r\nearned abundant odium by openly resisting the claims of dogmatic\r\nauthority, he had not been compelled to define his philosophical\r\nposition until he entered the Metaphysical Society. How he came to\r\nenrich the English language with the name \"Agnostic\" is explained in his\r\narticle \"Agnosticism\" (\"Collected Essays\" 5 pages 237-239).\r\n\r\nAfter describing how it came about that his mind] \"steadily gravitated\r\ntowards the conclusions of Hume and Kant,\" [so well stated by the latter\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\nThe greatest and perhaps the sole use of all philosophy of pure reason\r\nis, after all, merely negative, since it serves not as an organon for\r\nthe enlargement (of knowledge), but as a discipline for its\r\ndelimitation; and, instead of discovering truth, has only the modest\r\nmerit of preventing error:--\r\n\r\nhe proceeds:--]\r\n\r\nWhen I reached intellectual maturity, and began to ask myself whether I\r\nwas an atheist, a theist, or a pantheist; a materialist or an idealist;\r\na Christian or a freethinker; I found that the more I learned and\r\nreflected, the less ready was the answer; until, at last, I came to the\r\nconclusion that I had neither art nor part with any of these\r\ndenominations, except the last. The one thing in which most of these\r\ngood people were agreed was the one thing in which I differed from them.\r\nThey were quite sure they had attained a certain \"gnosis\"--had, more or\r\nless successfully, solved the problem of existence; while I was quite\r\nsure I had not, and had a pretty strong conviction that the problem was\r\ninsoluble. And, with Hume and Kant on my side, I could not think myself\r\npresumptuous in holding fast by that opinion...\r\n\r\nThis was my situation when I had the good fortune to find a place among\r\nthe members of that remarkable confraternity of antagonists, long since\r\ndeceased, but of green and pious memory, the Metaphysical Society. Every\r\nvariety of philosophical and theological opinion was represented there,\r\nand expressed itself with entire openness; most of my colleagues were\r\n-ists of one sort or another; and, however kind and friendly they might\r\nbe, I, the man without a rag of a label to cover himself with, could not\r\nfail to have some of the uneasy feelings which must have beset the\r\nhistorical fox when, after leaving the trap in which his tail remained,\r\nhe presented himself to his normally elongated companions. So I took\r\nthought, and invented what I conceived to be the appropriate title of\r\n\"agnostic.\" It came into my head as suggestively antithetic to the\r\n\"gnostic\" of Church history, who professed to know so much about the\r\nvery things of which I was ignorant; and I took the earliest opportunity\r\nof parading it at our Society, to show that I, too, had a tail, like the\r\nother foxes. To my great satisfaction, the term took; and when the\r\n\"Spectator\" had stood godfather to it, any suspicion in the minds of\r\nrespectable people that a knowledge of its parentage might have awakened\r\nwas, of course, completely lulled.\r\n\r\n[As for the dialectical powers he displayed in the debates, it was\r\ngenerally acknowledged that in this, as well as in the power of\r\nconducting a debate, he shared the pre-eminence with W.G. Ward. Indeed,\r\na proposal was made that the perpetual presidency in alternate years\r\nshould be vested in these two; but time and health forbade.\r\n\r\nHis part in the debates is thus described in a letter to me from\r\nProfessor Henry Sidgwick:--\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Huxley,\r\n\r\nI became a member of the Metaphysical Society, I think, at its first\r\nmeeting in 1869; and, though my engagements in Cambridge did not allow\r\nme to attend regularly, I retain a very distinct recollection of the\r\npart taken by your father in the debates at which we were present\r\ntogether. There were several members of the Society with whose\r\nphilosophical views I had, on the whole, more sympathy; but there was\r\ncertainly no one to whom I found it more pleasant and more instructive\r\nto listen. Indeed I soon came to the conclusion that there was only one\r\nother member of our Society who could be placed on a par with him as a\r\ndebater, on the subjects discussed at our meetings; and that was,\r\ncuriously enough, a man of the most diametrically opposite\r\nopinions--W.G. Ward, the well-known advocate of Ultramontanism. Ward was\r\nby training, and perhaps by nature, more of a dialectician; but your\r\nfather was unrivalled in the clearness, precision, succinctness, and\r\npoint of his statements, in his complete and ready grasp of his own\r\nsystem of philosophical thought, and the quickness and versatility with\r\nwhich his thought at once assumed the right attitude of defence against\r\nany argument coming from any quarter. I used to think that while others\r\nof us could perhaps find, on the spur of the moment, AN answer more or\r\nless effective to some unexpected attack, your father seemed always able\r\nto find THE answer--I mean the answer that it was reasonable to give,\r\nconsistently with his general view, and much the same answer that he\r\nwould have given if he had been allowed the fullest time for\r\ndeliberation.\r\n\r\nThe general tone of the Metaphysical Society was one of extreme\r\nconsideration for the feelings of opponents, and your father's speaking\r\nformed no exception to the general harmony. At the same time I seem to\r\nremember him as the most combative of all the speakers who took a\r\nleading part in the debates. His habit of never wasting words, and the\r\nedge naturally given to his remarks by his genius for clear and\r\neffective statement, partly account for this impression; still I used to\r\nthink that he liked fighting, and occasionally liked to give play to his\r\nsarcastic humour--though always strictly within the limits imposed by\r\ncourtesy. I remember that on one occasion when I had read to the Society\r\nan essay on the \"Incoherence of Empiricism,\" I looked forward with some\r\nlittle anxiety to his criticisms; and when they came, I felt that my\r\nanxiety had not been superfluous; he \"went for\" the weak points of my\r\nargument in half a dozen trenchant sentences, of which I shall not\r\nforget the impression. It was hard hitting, though perfectly courteous\r\nand fair.\r\n\r\nI wish I could remember what he said, but the memory of all the words\r\nuttered in these debates has now vanished from my mind, though I recall\r\nvividly the general impression that I have tried briefly to put down.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, yours very truly,\r\n\r\nHenry Sidgwick.",
