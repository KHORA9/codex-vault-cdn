No. V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAUVOO AND DESERET.\r\n\r\nIMPOSTURE AND HISTORY OF THE MORMONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the many extraordinary chapters in the history of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury none will seem in the next age more incredible and curious than\r\nthat in which is related the Rise and Progress of Mormonism. The creed\r\nof the Latter Day Saints, as they style themselves, is not, indeed,\r\nmore absurd and ridiculous than that of the Millerites, but this last\r\nsect had but a very brief existence, and is now almost forgotten;\r\nwhile the imposture of Smith and his associates, commencing before\r\nMiller began his prophecies, is still successful, and represented by\r\nmissionaries in almost every state throughout the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MORMON EXODUS: PASSING THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS.]\r\n\r\nIt has been observed with some reason, that had a Rabelais or a Swift\r\ntold the story of the Mormons under the veil of allegory, the sane\r\nportion of mankind would probably have entered a protest against the\r\nextravagance of the satirist. The name of the mock hero, his own and\r\nhis family's ignorance and want of character, the low cunning of his\r\naccomplices, the open and shameless vices in which they indulged, and\r\nthe extraordinary success of the sect they founded, would all have been\r\nthought too obviously conceived with a view to ludicrous effects. Yet\r\nthe Mormon movement has assumed the condition of an important popular\r\nfeature, and after much suffering and many reverses, its authors have\r\nachieved a condition of eminent industrial prosperity. In twenty years\r\nthe company, consisting of the impostor and his father and brother,\r\nhas increased to nearly half a million; they occupy one of the richest\r\nportions of this continent, have a regularly organized government, and\r\nare represented in the Congress of the United States by a delegate\r\nhaving all the powers usually conferred on the members for territories.\r\nWith missions in every part of the country, in every capital of Europe,\r\nin Mecca, in Jerusalem, and among the islands of the Pacific and the\r\nIndian Oceans, all of whom are charged with the duty of making converts\r\nand gathering them to the Promised Land of Deseret, they must very soon\r\nhave a population sufficiently large to claim admission as an equal\r\nmember to the Union, and perhaps to hold the balance of power in its\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the energy and success with which their missions are\r\nprosecuted, we may cite the statement contained in a work just\r\npublished in London, _The Mormons, or Latter Day Saints, a Contemporary\r\nHistory_, that more than fourteen thousand persons have left Great\r\nBritain since 1840 for the \"Holy City.\" The emigrants passing through\r\nLiverpool in 1849, amounted to 2,500, generally of the better class\r\nof mechanics and farmers, and it was estimated that at least 30,000\r\nconverts remained behind. In June, 1850, there were in England and\r\nScotland, 27,863, of whom London contributed 2,529; Liverpool, 1,018;\r\nManchester, 2,787; Glasgow, 1,846; Sheffield, 1,920; Edinburgh, 1,331;\r\nBirmingham, 1,909; and Wales, 4,342. And the Mormon census was again\r\ntaken last January, giving the entire number in the British Isles\r\nat 30,747. In fourteen years, more than 50,000 had been baptized in\r\nEngland, of whom nearly 17,000 had \"emigrated to Zion.\" Although the\r\nMormon emigration is commonly of the better class, there are also poor\r\nMormons; and that these as well as their more prosperous brethren may\r\nbe \"gathered to the holy city,\" there is now amassed in Liverpool\r\na very large fund, under the control of officers appointed by the\r\n\"Apostles,\" destined exclusively for the equipment and transportation\r\nof converts to their place of Refuge.\r\n\r\nThe interest which recent events have attracted to the community in\r\nDeseret or Utah, will render interesting a more particular survey of\r\nits origin, progress, and condition.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 there lived near the village of Palmyra, in New-York, a family\r\nof small farmers of the name of Smith. They were of bad repute in the\r\nneighborhood, notorious for being continually in debt, and heedless of\r\ntheir business engagements. The eldest son, Joseph, says one of his\r\nfriends, \"could read without much difficulty, wrote a very imperfect\r\nhand, and had a very limited understanding of the elementary rules of\r\narithmetic.\" Associated in some degree with Sidney Rigdon, who comes\r\nbefore us in the first place as a journeyman printer, he was the\r\nfounder of the new faith. The early history of the conspiracy of these\r\nworthies is imperfectly known; but it is evident that Rigdon must have\r\nbeen in Smith's confidence from the first. Rigdon, indeed, probably\r\nhad more to do with the matter than even Smith; but it was the latter\r\nwho was first put conspicuously forward, and who managed to retain\r\nthe pre-eminence. The account of the pretended revelation, as given\r\nby Smith, is as follows: He all at once found himself laboring in a\r\nstate of great darkness and wretchedness of mind--was bewildered among\r\nthe conflicting doctrines of the Christians, and could find no comfort\r\nor rest for his soul. In this state, he resorted to earnest prayer,\r\nkneeling in the woods and fields, and after long perseverance was\r\nanswered by the appearance of a bright light in heaven, which gradually\r\ndescended until it enveloped the worshipper, who found himself standing\r\nface to face with two supernatural beings. Of these he inquired which\r\nwas the true religion? The reply was, that all existing religions\r\nwere erroneous, but that the pure doctrine and crowning dispensation\r\nof Christianity should at a future period be miraculously revealed\r\nto himself. Several similar visitations ensued, and at length he was\r\ninformed that the North American Indians were a remnant of Israel; that\r\nwhen they first entered America they were a powerful and enlightened\r\npeople; that their priests and rulers kept the records of their history\r\nand doctrines, but that, having fallen off from the true worship, the\r\ngreat body of the nation were supernaturally destroyed--not, however,\r\nuntil a priest and prophet named Mormon, had, by heavenly direction,\r\ndrawn up an abstract of their records and religious opinions. He was\r\ntold that this still existed, buried in the earth, and that he was\r\nselected as the instrument for its recovery and manifestation to all\r\nnations. The record, it was said, contained many prophecies as to these\r\nlatter days, and instructions for the gathering of the saints into a\r\ntemporal and spiritual kingdom, preparatory to the second coming of\r\nthe Messiah, which was at hand. After several very similar visions,\r\nthe spot in which the book lay buried was disclosed. Smith went to\r\nit, and after digging, discovered a sort of box, formed of upright and\r\nhorizontal flags, within which lay a number of plates resembling gold,\r\nand of the thickness of common tin. These were bound together by a\r\nwire, and were engraved with Egyptian characters. By the side of them\r\nlay two transparent stones, called by the ancients, \"Urim and Thummim,\"\r\nset in \"the two rims of a bow.\" These stones were divining crystals,\r\nand the angels informed Smith, that by using them he would be enabled\r\nto decipher the characters on the plates. What ultimately became of the\r\nplates--if such things existed at all--does not appear. They were said\r\nto have been seen and handled by eleven witnesses. With the exception\r\nof three persons, these witnesses were either members of Smith's\r\nfamily, or of a neighboring family of the name of Whitmer. The Smiths,\r\nof course, give suspicious testimony. The Whitmers have disappeared,\r\nand no one knows any thing about them. Another witness, Oliver Cowdrey,\r\nwas afterwards an amanuensis to Joseph; and another, Martin Harris, was\r\nlong a conspicuous disciple. There is some confusion, however, about\r\nthis person. Although he signs his name, as a witness who has seen and\r\nhandled the plates, he assured Professor Anthon that he never had seen\r\nthem, that \"he was not sufficiently pure of heart,\" and that Joseph\r\nrefused to show him the plates, but gave him instead a transcript on\r\npaper of the characters engraved on them. It is difficult to trace the\r\nearly advances of the imposture. Every thing is vague and uncertain. We\r\nhave no dates, and only the statements of the prophet and his friends.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Smith must have worked successfully on the feeble and\r\nsuperstitious mind of Martin Harris. This man, as we have just said,\r\nreceived from him a written transcript of the mysterious characters,\r\nand conveyed it to Professor Anthon, a competent philological\r\nauthority. Dr. Anthon's account of the interview is one of the most\r\nimportant parts of the entire history. Harris told him he had not seen\r\nthe plates, but that he intended to sell his farm and give the proceeds\r\nto enable Smith to publish a translation of them. This statement,\r\nwith what follows, shows that Smith's original intention, _quoad_ the\r\nalleged plates, was to use them as a means for swindling Harris. The\r\nMormons have published accounts of Professor Anthon's judgment on\r\nthe paper submitted to him, which he himself states to be \"perfectly\r\nfalse.\" The Mormon version of the interview represents Dr. Anthon\r\n\"as having been unable to decipher the characters correctly, but as\r\nhaving presumed that, if the original records could be brought, he\r\ncould assist in translating them.\" On this statement being made, Dr.\r\nAnthon described the document submitted to him as having been a sort\r\nof _pot-pourri_ of ancient marks and alphabets. \"It had evidently been\r\nprepared by some person who had before him a book containing various\r\nalphabets; Greek and Hebrew letters, crosses and flourishes, Roman\r\nletters, inverted or placed sideways, were arranged in perpendicular\r\ncolumns, and the whole ended in a rude delineation of a circle,\r\ndivided into various compartments, decked with numerous strange marks,\r\nand evidently copied after the Mexican Calendar given by Humboldt,\r\nbut copied in such a way as not to betray the source whence it was\r\nderived.\" This account disposes of the statement that the characters\r\nwere Egyptian, while the very jumble of the signs of different nations,\r\nlanguages, and ages, proves that the impostor was deficient both in\r\ntact and knowledge. The scheme seems to have been, at all events, _in\r\npetto_ when Smith communicated with Harris; but a satisfactory clue to\r\nthe fabrication is lost in our ignorance of the time and circumstances\r\nunder which Smith and Rigdon came together. It must have been\r\nsubsequent to that event that the \"translation,\" by means of the magic\r\nUrim and Thummim, was begun. This work Smith is represented as having\r\nlabored at steadily, assisted by Oliver Cowdrey, until a volume was\r\nproduced containing as much matter as the Old Testament, written in the\r\nBiblical style, and containing, as Smith said the Angel had informed\r\nhim, a history of the lost tribes in their pilgrimage to and settlement\r\nin America, with copious doctrinal and prophetic commentaries and\r\nrevelations.\r\n\r\nThe devotion of Harris to the impostor secured a fund sufficient for\r\ndefraying the cost of printing the pretended revelation, and the sect\r\nbegan slowly to increase. The doctrines of Smith were not at first\r\nvery clearly defined; it is probable that neither he nor Rigdon had\r\ndetermined what should be their precise character; but like their early\r\ncontemporary the prophet Matthias (the interesting history of whose\r\ncareer was published in New-York several years ago by the late Colonel\r\nStone), they had no hesitation in deciding on one cardinal point,\r\nthat the revelations made to Smith at any time should be received\r\nwith unquestioning and implicit faith, and the earliest of these\r\nrevelations contemplated a liberal provision for all the prophet's\r\npersonal necessities. Thus, in February, 1831, it was revealed to the\r\ndisciples that they should immediately build the prophet a house; on\r\nanother occasion it was enjoined that, if they had any regard for\r\ntheir own souls, the sooner they provided him with food and raiment,\r\nand every thing he needed, the better it would be for them; and in a\r\nthird revelation, Joseph was informed that \"he was not to labor for his\r\nliving.\" All these \"revelations\" were received, and though the impostor\r\nseemed to intelligent men little better than a buffoon, his followers\r\nsoon learned to regard him as almost deserving of adoration, and he\r\nbegan to revel in whatever luxury and profligacy was most agreeable\r\nto his vulgar taste and ambition. As in the case of the scarcely more\r\nrespectable pretender, Andrew Jackson Davis, it was asserted that\r\nhis original want of cultivation precluded the notion of his having\r\nby the exercise of any natural or acquired faculties produced his\r\n\"revelations.\" Everywhere his followers said, \"The prophet is not\r\nlearned in a human sense: how could he have become acquainted with all\r\nthe antiquarian learning here displayed, if it were not supernaturally\r\ncommunicated to him?\" But to this question there was soon an answer\r\nequally explicit and satisfactory. The real author of the Book of\r\nMormon was a Rev. Solomon Spaulding, who wrote it as a romance. Its\r\nentire history and the means by which it came into the possession of\r\nSmith are described, in the following statement, by Mr. Spaulding's\r\nwidow:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROSSING THE MISSOURI.]\r\n\r\n    \"Since the _Book of Mormon_, or _Golden Bible_ (as it was\r\n    originally called), has excited much attention, and is deemed\r\n    by a certain new sect of equal authority with the sacred\r\n    Scriptures, I think it a duty to the public to state what I\r\n    know of its origin.... Solomon Spaulding, to whom I was married\r\n    in early life, was a graduate of Dartmouth college, and was\r\n    distinguished for a lively imagination, and great fondness for\r\n    history. At the time of our marriage, he resided in Cherry\r\n    Valley, New York. From this place, we removed to New Salem,\r\n    Ashtabula County, Ohio, sometimes called Conneaut, as it is\r\n    situated on Conneaut Creek. Shortly after our removal to this\r\n    place, his health failed, and he was laid aside from active\r\n    labors. In the town of New Salem there are numerous mounds and\r\n    forts, supposed by many to be the dilapidated dwellings and\r\n    fortifications of a race now extinct. These relics arrest the\r\n    attention of new settlers, and become objects of research for\r\n    the curious. Numerous implements were found, and other articles\r\n    evincing skill in the arts. Mr. Spaulding being an educated\r\n    man, took a lively interest in these developments of antiquity;\r\n    and in order to beguile the hours of retirement, and furnish\r\n    employment for his mind, he conceived the idea of giving an\r\n    historical sketch of the long-lost race. Their antiquity led\r\n    him to adopt the most ancient style, and he imitated the Old\r\n    Testament as nearly as possible. His sole object in writing\r\n    this imaginary history was to amuse himself and his neighbors.\r\n    This was about the year 1812. Hull's surrender at Detroit\r\n    occurred near the same time, and I recollect the date well\r\n    from that circumstance. As he progressed in his narrative, the\r\n    neighbors would come in from time to time to hear portions\r\n    read, and a great interest in the work was excited among them.\r\n    It claimed to have been written by one of the lost nation, and\r\n    to have been recovered from the earth; and he gave it the title\r\n    of 'The Manuscript Found.' The neighbors would often inquire\r\n    how Mr. Spaulding advanced in deciphering the manuscript; and\r\n    when he had a sufficient portion prepared, he would inform\r\n    them, and they would assemble to hear it read. He was enabled,\r\n    from his acquaintance with the classics and ancient history,\r\n    to introduce many singular names, which were particularly\r\n    noticed by the people, and could be easily recognized by them.\r\n    Mr. Solomon Spaulding had a brother, Mr. John Spaulding,\r\n    residing in the place at the time, who was perfectly familiar\r\n    with the work, and repeatedly heard the whole of it. From\r\n    New Salem we removed to Pittsburgh, in Pennsylvania. Here\r\n    Mr. Spaulding found a friend and acquaintance, in the person\r\n    of Mr. Patterson, an editor of a newspaper. He exhibited his\r\n    manuscript to Mr. Patterson, who was much pleased with it,\r\n    and borrowed it for perusal. He retained it a long time, and\r\n    informed Mr. Spaulding that if he would make out a title-page\r\n    and preface, he would publish it, and it might be a source\r\n    of profit. This Mr. Spaulding refused to do. Sidney Rigdon,\r\n    who has figured so largely in the history of the Mormons,\r\n    was at that time connected with the printing office of Mr.\r\n    Patterson, as is well known in that region, and, as Rigdon\r\n    himself has frequently stated, became acquainted with Mr.\r\n    Spaulding's manuscript, and copied it. It was a matter of\r\n    notoriety and interest to all connected with the printing\r\n    establishment. At length the manuscript was returned to its\r\n    author, and soon after we removed to Amity, Washington county,\r\n    where Mr. Spaulding died, in 1816. The manuscript then fell\r\n    into my hands, and was carefully preserved. It has frequently\r\n    been examined by my daughter, Mrs. M'Kenstry, of Monson,\r\n    Massachusetts, with whom I now reside, and by other friends.\r\n    After the Book of Mormon came out, a copy of it was taken to\r\n    New Salem, the place of Mr. Spaulding's former residence,\r\n    and the very place where the 'Manuscript Found' was written.\r\n    A woman appointed a meeting there; and in the meeting read\r\n    copious extracts from the Book of Mormon. The historical part\r\n    was known by all the older inhabitants, as the identical\r\n    work of Mr. Spaulding, in which they had all been so deeply\r\n    interested years before. Mr. John Spaulding was present, and\r\n    recognized perfectly the production of his brother. He was\r\n    amazed and afflicted that it should have been perverted to so\r\n    wicked a purpose. His grief found vent in tears, and he arose\r\n    on the spot, and expressed to the meeting his sorrow that the\r\n    writings of his deceased brother should be used for a purpose\r\n    so vile and shocking. The excitement in New Salem became so\r\n    great, that the inhabitants had a meeting, and deputed Dr.\r\n    Philastus Hurlbut, one of their number, to repair to this\r\n    place, and to obtain from me the original manuscript of Mr.\r\n    Spaulding, for the purpose of comparing it with the Mormon\r\n    Bible--to satisfy their own minds and to prevent their friends\r\n    from embracing an error so delusive. This was in the year 1834.\r\n    Dr. Hurlbut brought with him an introduction and request for\r\n    the manuscript, which was signed by Messrs. Henry, Lake, Aaron\r\n    Wright, and others, with all of whom I was acquainted, as they\r\n    were my neighbors when I resided at New Salem. I am sure that\r\n    nothing would grieve my husband more, were he living, than\r\n    the use which has been made of his work. The air of antiquity\r\n    which was thrown about the composition doubtless suggested\r\n    the idea of converting it to the purposes of delusion. Thus,\r\n    an historical romance, with the addition of a few pious\r\n    expressions, and extracts from the sacred Scriptures, has been\r\n    construed into a new Bible, and palmed off upon a company of\r\n    poor deluded fanatics as Divine.\"\r\n\r\nSimilar evidence as to the Spaulding MS. was given by several private\r\nfriends, and by the writer's brother, all of whom were familiar with\r\nits contents. The facts thus graphically detailed have of course been\r\ndenied, but have never been disproved. Indeed, without them it is\r\nimpossible to explain the hold which Rigdon always possessed on the\r\nProphet; for he was a poor creature, without education and without\r\ntalents. At one time--a critical moment in the history of the new\r\nchurch--a quarrel arose between the accomplices; but it ended in\r\nSmith's receiving a \"revelation,\" in which Rigdon was raised by divine\r\ncommand to be equal with himself, having plenary power given to him to\r\nbind and loose both on earth and in heaven.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MORMON CARAVAN ON THE PRAIRIES.]\r\n\r\nThe remaining history of the Mormons is eminently interesting. Ignorant\r\nand superstitious as have been the chief part of the disciples, and\r\natrocious as have been the tricks of the knaves who have led them on\r\namid all the varieties of their good and evil fortune, there have\r\noccasionally been displayed among them an enthusiasm and bravery of\r\nendurance that demand admiration. Nearly from the beginning the leaders\r\nof the sect seem to have contemplated settling in the thinly populated\r\nregions of the western states, where lands were to be purchased for\r\nlow prices, and after a short residence at Kirkland, in Ohio, they\r\ndetermined to found a New Jerusalem in Missouri. The interests of the\r\ntown were confided to suitable officers, and Smith spent his time\r\nin travelling through the country and preaching, until the real or\r\npretended immoralities of the sect led to such discontents that in\r\n1839 they were forcibly and lawlessly expelled from the state. We are\r\ninclined to believe that they were not only treated with remarkable\r\nseverity, but that there was not any reason whatever to justify an\r\ninterference in their affairs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MORMON TEMPLE AT NAUVOO.]\r\n\r\nFrom Missouri the saints proceeded to Illinois, and on the sixth of\r\nApril, 1841, with imposing ceremonies, laid at their new city of Nauvoo\r\nthe corner-stone of the Temple,[1] an immense edifice, without any\r\narchitectural order or attraction, which in a few months was celebrated\r\nevery where as not inferior in size and magnificence to that built by\r\nSolomon in Jerusalem. Nauvoo is delightfully situated in the midst of\r\na fertile district, and a careful inquirer will not be apt to deny\r\nthat it became the home of a more industrious, frugal, and generally\r\nmoral society, than occupied any other town in the state. Whatever\r\ncharges were preferred against Smith and his disciples, to justify the\r\noutrages to which they were subjected, the history of their expulsion\r\nfrom Nauvoo is simply a series of illustrations of the fact that the\r\nruffian population of the neighboring country set on foot a vast scheme\r\nof robbery in order to obtain the lands and improvements of the Mormons\r\nwithout paying for them. We have not room for a particular statement\r\nof the discontents and conspiracies which grew up in the city, nor\r\nfor any detail of the aggressions from without. On the 27th of June,\r\n1844, Joseph and Hyrum Smith were murdered, while under the especial\r\nprotection of the authorities of the state. A writer in the _Christian\r\nReflector_ newspaper, soon after, observed of Joseph Smith:\r\n\r\n    \"Various are the opinions concerning this singular personage;\r\n    but whatever may be thought in reference to his principles,\r\n    objects, or moral character, all agree that he was a most\r\n    remarkable man.... Notwithstanding the low origin, poverty,\r\n    and profligacy of these mountebanks, they have augmented\r\n    their numbers till more than 100,000 persons are now numbered\r\n    among the followers of the Mormon Prophet, and they never\r\n    were increasing so rapidly as at the time of his death. Born\r\n    in the very lowest walks of life, reared in poverty, educated\r\n    in vice, having no claims to even common intelligence, coarse\r\n    and vulgar in deportment, the Prophet Smith succeeded in\r\n    establishing a religious creed, the tenets of which have been\r\n    taught throughout America; the Prophet's virtues have been\r\n    rehearsed in Europe; the ministers of Nauvoo have found a\r\n    welcome in Asia; Africa has listened to the grave sayings of\r\n    the seer of Palmyra; the standard of the Latter-Day Saints\r\n    has been reared on the banks of the Nile; and even the Holy\r\n    Land has been entered by the emissaries of this impostor. He\r\n    founded a city in one of the most beautiful situations in the\r\n    world, in a beautiful curve of the 'Father of Waters,' of no\r\n    mean pretensions, and in it he had collected a population\r\n    of twenty-five thousand, from every part of the world. The\r\n    acts of his life exhibit a character as incongruous as it is\r\n    remarkable. If we can credit his own words and the testimony\r\n    of eye-witnesses, he was at the same time the vicegerent of\r\n    God and a tavern-keeper--a prophet and a base libertine--a\r\n    minister of peace, and a lieutenant-general--a ruler of tens of\r\n    thousands, and a slave to all his own base passions--a preacher\r\n    of righteousness, and a profane swearer--a worshipper of\r\n    Bacchus, mayor of a city, and a miserable bar-room fiddler--a\r\n    judge on the judicial bench, and an invader of the civil,\r\n    social, and moral relations of men; and, notwithstanding\r\n    these inconsistencies of character, there are not wanting\r\n    thousands willing to stake their souls' eternal salvation\r\n    on his veracity. For aught we know, time and distance will\r\n    embellish his life with some new and rare virtues, which his\r\n    most intimate friends failed to discover while living with\r\n    him. Reasoning from effect to cause, we must conclude that\r\n    the Mormon Prophet was of no common genius: few are able to\r\n    commence and carry out an imposition like his, so long, and so\r\n    extensively. And we see, in the history of his success, most\r\n    striking proofs of the credulity of a large portion of the\r\n    human family.\"\r\n\r\n[1] The temple was of white limestone, 128 feet long, 83 feet wide, and\r\n60 feet high. Its style will be seen in the above engraving. It was\r\ndestroyed by fire, on the 19th of November, 1848. The town of Nauvoo\r\nis now occupied by another class of socialists, the Icarians, under M.\r\nCabet, of Paris.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EXPULSION FROM NAUVOO.]\r\n\r\nAfter some dissensions, in which the party of Brigham Young triumphed\r\nover that of Sidney Rigdon, the sect were reorganized and for some time\r\nwere permitted quietly to prosecute their plans at Nauvoo. But early in\r\n1846 they were driven out of their city and compelled in mid winter to\r\nseek a new home beyond the farthest borders of civilization. The first\r\ncompanies, embracing sixteen hundred persons, crossed the Mississippi\r\non the 3d February, 1846, and similar detachments continued to leave\r\nuntil July and August, travelling by ox-teams towards California,\r\nthen almost unknown, and quite unpeopled by the Anglo-Saxon race.\r\nTheir enemies asserted that the intention of the Saints was to excite\r\nthe Indians against the government, and that they would return to\r\ntake vengeance on the whites for the indignities they had suffered.\r\nNothing appears to have been further from their intentions. Their\r\nsole object was to plant their Church in some fertile and hitherto\r\nundiscovered spot, where they might be unmolested by any opposing sect.\r\nThe war against Mexico was then raging, and, to test the loyalty of\r\nthe Mormons, it was suggested that a demand should be made on them to\r\nraise five hundred men for the service of the country. They consented,\r\nand that number of their best men enrolled themselves under General\r\nKearney, and marched 2,400 miles with the armies of the United States.\r\nAt the conclusion of the war they were disbanded in Upper California.\r\nThey allege that it was one of this band who, in working at a mill,\r\nfirst discovered the golden treasures of California; and they are said\r\nto have amassed large quantities of gold before the secret was made\r\ngenerally known to the \"Gentiles.\" But faith was not kept with the\r\nMormons who remained in Nauvoo. Although they had agreed to leave in\r\ndetachments, as rapidly as practicable, they were not allowed necessary\r\ntime to dispose of their property; and in September, 1846, the city\r\nwas besieged by their enemies upon the pretence that they did not\r\nintend to fulfil the stipulations made with the people and authorities\r\nof Illinois. After a three days' bombardment, the last remnant was\r\nfinally driven out.\r\n\r\nThe terrible hejira of the Mormon emigrants over the Rocky Mountains\r\nhas been described by Mr. Kane of Philadelphia, in an interesting\r\npamphlet, which is honorable to his own character for good sense and\r\nfor benevolent feeling. No religious emigration was ever attended\r\nby more suffering, no emigration of any kind was ever prosecuted\r\nwith more bravery. It resulted in the permanent establishment of the\r\n\"Commonwealth of the New Covenant,\" in Utah, or Deseret, one of the\r\nmost attractive portions of the interior of this Continent, near its\r\nwestern border. Of this territory Mr. Kane says:\r\n\r\n    Deseret is emphatically a new country; new in its own\r\n    characteristic features, newer still in its bringing together\r\n    within its limits the most inconsistent peculiarities of\r\n    other countries. I cannot aptly compare it to any. Descend\r\n    from the mountains, where you have the scenery and climate of\r\n    Switzerland, to seek the sky of your choice among the many\r\n    climates of Italy, and you may find welling out of the same\r\n    hills the freezing springs of Mexico and the hot springs of\r\n    Iceland, both together coursing their way to the Salt Sea\r\n    of Palestine, in the plain below. The pages of Malte Brun\r\n    provide me with a less truthful parallel to it than those which\r\n    describe the Happy Valley of Rasselas, or the Continent of\r\n    Ballibarbi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREAT SALT LAKE CITY OR NEW JERUSAL'M.]\r\n\r\nThe history of the Mormons has ever since been an unbroken record\r\nof prosperity. It has looked as though the elements of fortune,\r\nobedient to a law of natural re-action, were struggling to compensate\r\ntheir undue share of suffering. They may be pardoned for deeming it\r\nmiraculous. But, in truth, the economist accounts for it all, who\r\nexplains to us the speedy recuperation of cities, laid in ruin by\r\nflood, fire, and earthquake. During its years of trial, Mormon labor\r\nhad subsisted on insufficient capital, and under many difficulties,\r\nbut it _has_ subsisted, and survives them now, as intelligent and\r\npowerful as ever it was at Nauvoo; with this difference, that it has\r\nin the mean time been educated to habits of unmatched thrift, energy,\r\nand endurance, and has been transplanted to a situation where it is\r\nin every respect more productive. Moreover, during all the period of\r\ntheir journey, while some have gained by practice in handicraft, and\r\nthe experience of repeated essays at their various halting-places,\r\nthe minds of all have been busy framing designs and planning the\r\nimprovements they have since found opportunity to execute. Their\r\nterritory is unequalled as a stock-raising country; the finest pastures\r\nof Lombardy are not more estimable than those on the east side of the\r\nUtah Lake and its tributary rivers, and it is scarcely less rich in\r\ntimber and minerals than the most fortunate portions of the continent.\r\n\r\nFrom the first the Mormons have had little to do in Deseret, but attend\r\nto mechanical and strictly agricultural pursuits. They have made\r\nseveral successful settlements; the farthest north is distant more than\r\nforty miles, and the farthest south, in a valley called the Sanpeech,\r\ntwo hundred, from that first formed. A duplicate of the Lake Tiberias\r\nempties its waters into the innocent Dead Sea of Deseret, by a fine\r\nriver, which they have named the Western Jordan. It was on the right\r\nbank of this stream, on a rich table land, traversed by exhaustless\r\nwaters falling from the highlands, that the pioneers, coming out of the\r\nmountains in the night of the 24th of July, 1847, pitched their first\r\ncamp in the Valley, and consecrated the ground. This spot proved the\r\nmost favorable site for their chief settlement, and after exploring\r\nthe whole country, they founded on it their city of the New Jerusalem.\r\nIts houses are diffused, to command as much as possible the farms,\r\nwhich are laid out in wards or cantons, with a common fence to each.\r\nThe farms in wheat already cover a space nearly as large as Rhode\r\nIsland. The houses of New Jerusalem, or Great Salt Lake City, as it is\r\ncommonly called, are distributed over an area nearly as great as that\r\nof New York. The foundations have been laid for a temple more vast\r\nand magnificent than that which was erected at Nauvoo. The Deseret\r\nNews, a paper established under the direction of the ecclesiastical\r\nauthority came to us lately with several columns descriptive of the\r\nfourth anniversary celebration of the arrival of the disciples in their\r\nPromised Land.\r\n\r\nSince the preceding paragraphs were written some important information\r\nhas been received from Utah, justifying apprehensions that the ambition\r\nof the chief of the sect, and territorial governor, Brigham Young,\r\nwill be continually productive of difficulties. It appears that in\r\nconsequence of his unwarrantable assumptions of authority, the larger\r\nand most respectable portion of the territorial officers, including\r\nB. O. Harris, Secretary of the Territory, G. K. Brandenburg, Chief\r\nJustice, E. P. Bracchas, Associate Justice, H. R. Day, Indian Agent,\r\nand Messrs. Gillette and Young, were preparing to leave for the\r\nAtlantic States.\r\n\r\nThe particulars of the difficulty are not stated, but it is said that\r\n$20,000 appropriated by Congress for territorial purposes had been\r\nsquandered by Young, and an attempt made by him to take $24,000 from\r\nthe Treasurer, who refused, and applied to the Court to support him.\r\nThis was done, and an injunction granted restraining the proceedings of\r\nthe Governor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WINDSOR CASTLE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the numerous objects of interest with which the banks of the Thames\r\nare so thickly studded, none are of such surpassing grandeur and regal\r\nmagnificence as Windsor Castle, with its adjacent chapel of St. George,\r\nand Eton College. This massive and stately pile is richly storied\r\nwith poetic associations, and venerable for its antiquity, in having\r\nproudly defied the ravages of Time for some eight centuries. Here\r\nkings were born; here they kept royal state amid the blaze of fashion\r\nand luxurious indulgence; and here in the adjoining mausoleum, they\r\nwere buried. Here deeds of chivalry and high renown that shine on\r\nus from ancient days were enacted; and it is here the most exemplary\r\nof England's monarchy still prefers to hold her suburban residence.\r\nThis brave old fortress, unlike the Tower of London, with its dark\r\nrecords of crime, is rife with pleasant memories. Not only is the\r\nedifice itself, with its gigantic towers, its broad bastions, and its\r\nkingly halls, sacred with incident and story, but Shakespeare has also\r\nrendered classical the very ground on which it stands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISTANT VIEW OF WINDSOR CASTLE.]\r\n\r\nWindsor Forest, with its magnificent old oaks and its richly variegated\r\nscenery, of \"upland, lawn and stream,\" has afforded a fruitful theme\r\nfor the pens of Gray and the poet of \"The Seasons;\" and Pope, it will\r\nbe remembered, has felicitously pictured forth its changeful beauties.\r\nAs far back as the days of the Saxons we have records of palatial\r\nresidence at Old Windsor, or as its name then was, _Windleshora_, so\r\ncalled from the windings of the Thames in its vicinity. William the\r\nNorman built some portions of the Castle, which, until the time of\r\nRichard I., seems ever to have been the peaceful abode of royalty.\r\nDuring the civil wars, of which Windsor was a principal scene, the\r\nCastle became the most important military establishment in the kingdom.\r\nThe sanguinary struggles connected with the signing of _Magna Charta_,\r\nare familiar to the reader. The birth of Edward III., which took place\r\nat Windsor, forms another epoch in its history--that prince having\r\nreconstructed the greater part of the Castle, and very largely extended\r\nit. William of Wykeham was the architect, with the liberal salary of a\r\nshilling a day. It is said he and six hundred workmen employed on the\r\nbuilding, at the rate of one penny a day. It was here Richard II. heard\r\nthe appeal of high treason, brought by the Duke of Lancaster against\r\nMowbray, Duke of Norfolk, which resulted in the former becoming Henry\r\nIV. It was here the Earl of Surrey, imprisoned for the high crime of\r\neating flesh in Lent, beguiled his solitude, with his muse; and here\r\nwas the last prison of that unfortunate monarch, Charles I. In Windsor\r\nCastle also resided the haughty Elizabeth; and along its terrace might\r\nhave been seen in the days of the Commonwealth the stern figure of the\r\nlion-hearted Cromwell. It was the residence of Henry VIII., and the\r\nprison of James I. of Scotland. It is indebted for most of its modern\r\nsplendor, to the luxurious taste and prodigal expenditure of George\r\nIV., who obtained from the House of Commons the sum of £300,000 for\r\nthe purpose. The suites of royal apartments at present in use by the\r\nQueen are superb in the extreme, especially the state drawing rooms, in\r\nwhich are nine pictures by Zuccarelli; and St. George's Hall--a vast\r\napartment in which the state banquets are given.\r\n\r\nThe long walk, extending about three miles in a direct line to the\r\nPalace, presents the finest vista of its kind in the world. It extends\r\nfrom the grand entrance of the Castle, to the top of a commanding\r\nhill in the Great Park, which affords a panoramic view of enchanting\r\nbeauty, including many places memorable in history. On the right is\r\nthe Thames, seen beyond Charter Island, and the plain of Runnymede,\r\nwhere the Barons extorted _Magna Charta_, whilst in the hazy distance\r\nare the rising eminences of Harrow and Hampstead. On the summit of this\r\nhill stands the equestrian statue of George III. Near the avenue called\r\nQueen Elizabeth's Walk, tradition still points out a withered tree as\r\nthe identical oak of \"Herne the Hunter,\" who, as the tale goes,\r\n\r\n    \"Sometimes a keeper here in Windsor Forest,\r\n    Doth all the winter time, at still midnight,\r\n    Walk round the oak, with great ragged horns.\"\r\n\r\n    [We derive this article from an interesting and beautifully\r\n    illustrated volume of \"Memories of the Great Metropolis,\" by\r\n    FREDERIC SAUNDERS, to be issued in a few days by one of our\r\n    leading publishers. We shall notice it again.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. GERARD, THE LION KILLER, AND M. LE BARON MUNCHAUSEN, WHO BEAT HIM.\r\n\r\n\r\nJules Gerard is an officer in the famous army of Africa, who has a\r\npassion for lion killing. He is the Gordon Cumming of France. He\r\nfollows lions alone; hunts them like sheep, for miles; sleeps near\r\nthem; and patiently awaits their coming. Last year we published\r\n(article \"Wild Sports in Algeria,\" _International_, vol. ii. p. 121,)\r\nan account of one of his exploits, to which he now refers us. His last\r\nadventure is sufficiently exciting, and incredibly daring. It is told\r\nin a letter to a friend, and published in the _Journal des Chasseurs_:--\r\n\r\n    \"My dear Léon,--In my narrative of the month of August, 1850,\r\n    I spoke of a large old lion which I had not been able to fall\r\n    in with, and of whose sex and age I had formed a notion from\r\n    his roarings. On the return of the expeditionary column from\r\n    Kabylia, I asked permission from General St. Armand to go and\r\n    explore the fine lairs situated on the northern declivity of\r\n    Mount Aures, in the environs of Klenchela, where I had left\r\n    my animal. Instead of a furlough, I received a mission for\r\n    that country, and accordingly had during two months to shut\r\n    my ears against the daily reports that were brought to me by\r\n    the Arabs of the misdeeds of the solitary. In the beginning of\r\n    September, when my mission was terminated, I proceeded to pitch\r\n    my tent in the midst of the district haunted by the lion, and\r\n    set about my investigations round about the _douars_ to which\r\n    he paid the most frequent visits. In this manner I spent many\r\n    a night beneath the open sky, without any satisfactory result,\r\n    when, on the 15th, in the morning, after a heavy rain which\r\n    had lasted till midnight, some natives, who had explored the\r\n    cover, came and informed me that the lion was ensconced within\r\n    half a league of my tent. I set out at three o'clock, taking\r\n    with me an Arab to hold my horse, another carrying my arms,\r\n    and a third in charge of a goat most decidedly unconscious of\r\n    the important part it was about to perform. Having alighted\r\n    at the skirt of the wood, I directed myself towards a glade\r\n    situated in the midst of the haunt, where I found a shrub to\r\n    which I could tie the goat, and a tuft or two to sit upon. The\r\n    Arabs went and crouched down beneath the cover, at a distance\r\n    of about 100 paces. I had been there about a quarter of an\r\n    hour, the goat meanwhile bleating with all its might, when a\r\n    covey of partridges got up behind me, uttering their usual\r\n    cry when surprised. I looked about me in every direction,\r\n    but could see nothing. Meanwhile the goat had ceased crying,\r\n    and its eyes were intently fixed at me. She made an attempt\r\n    to break away from the fastening, and then began trembling\r\n    in all her limbs. At these symptoms of fright I again turned\r\n    round, and perceived behind me, about fifteen paces off, the\r\n    lion stretched out at the foot of a juniper-tree, through the\r\n    branches of which he was surveying us and making wry faces. In\r\n    the position I was in, it was impossible for me to fire without\r\n    facing about. I tried to fire from the left shoulder but felt\r\n    awkward. In turning gently round without rising, I was in a\r\n    favorable position, and just as I was levelling my piece the\r\n    lion stood up and began to show me all his teeth, at the same\r\n    time shaking his head, as much as to say, 'What the devil are\r\n    you doing there?' I did not hesitate a moment, and fired at his\r\n    mouth. The animal fell on the spot as if struck by lightning.\r\n    My men ran up at the shot; and as they were eager to lay hands\r\n    on the lion, I fired a second time between the eyes, in order\r\n    to secure his lying perfectly still. The first bullet had taken\r\n    the course of the spine throughout its entire length, passing\r\n    through the marrow, and had come out at the tail. I had never\r\n    before fired a shot that penetrated so deeply, and yet I had\r\n    only loaded with sixty grains. It is true the rifle was one of\r\n    Devisme's and the bullets steel-pointed. The lion, a black one\r\n    and among the oldest I have ever shot, supplied the kettles of\r\n    four companies of infantry who were stationed at Klenchela.\r\n    Receive, my dear Léon, the assurance of my devoted affection.\r\n\r\n                                                 JULES GERARD.\"\r\n\r\nThe exploit of 1850 was the chasing of two lions, one of which he\r\nkilled; the other, supposed to be the one now shot, running away from\r\nhim and escaping, after a vigorous chase of many miles. Some one--a\r\ncelebrated author, indeed, with whose astonishing adventures we have\r\nbeen familiar from boyhood--envious of the recent fame of Mr. Arthur\r\nGordon Cumming and M. Jules Gerard, has sent the following letter to\r\nthe editor of the London _Times_:\r\n\r\n    Sir,--The exploit of M. Jules Gerard, recorded in _The Times_\r\n    of the 14th inst., is certainly very wonderful, but by no means\r\n    equals one performed by myself in South Africa. Observing on\r\n    one occasion a large black lion, about 18 feet in length,\r\n    reposing under a caoutchouc tree, I fired, and the bullet, like\r\n    that of M. Gerard, went right through the backbone and came\r\n    out at the tail; but, wonderful to relate, it hit against the\r\n    tree, and rebounding, came back the same way and went straight\r\n    into the barrel of my rifle, just after I had reloaded with\r\n    powder. I instantly presented my piece at the lioness, which\r\n    was reposing by the side of her lord, and fired; and thus I\r\n    killed two animals (so large that they supplied three regiments\r\n    of the line and 200 irregular cavalry with food for nearly a\r\n    week) with one and the same bullet. In case any of your readers\r\n    should doubt the truth of this statement, I eschew the usual\r\n    fashion of writing under a false name, and subscribe myself,\r\n    your very obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                                      BARON MUNCHAUSEN.\r\n  _London_, Oct. 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe present to the readers of the _International Magazine_, this month,\r\nfrom a recent Daguerrotype by Brady, the best portrait ever published\r\nof the greatest living poet who writes the English language.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT was born on the third of November, 1794, in\r\nthe village of Cummington, Massachusetts. His father, Dr. Peter\r\nBryant of that place, one of the most eminent physicians of the day,\r\nwas possessed of extensive literary and scientific acquirements, an\r\nunusually vigorous and well-disciplined mind, and an elegant and\r\nrefined taste. He was fond of study, and sought to infuse into the\r\nminds of his young and growing family, those habits of intellectual\r\nexertion which had been to himself a source of so much exalted\r\npleasure. It was fortunate for the subject of this notice, that such\r\nwas his character; for when his own genius began to discover signs\r\nof its power, he found in his father an able and skilful instructor,\r\nwho chastened, improved, and encouraged the first rude efforts of\r\nhis boyhood. That parent did not, like the father of Petrarch, burn\r\nthe poetic library of his son, amid the tears and groans of the boy;\r\nnor, like the relatives of Alfieri, suppress, for nearly one-third\r\nof his existence, the poetic fervor which consumed his heart; but,\r\nlooking upon poetry as a high, perhaps the highest of arts, and poetic\r\neminence as the noblest fame, he nourished with cheerful care the least\r\nindications of its presence, and supplied the youth with the means of\r\nits culture and growth. Nor were his services unrewarded, as it appears\r\nfrom Mr. Bryant's solemn Hymn to Death, by the subsequent gratitude and\r\nsuccess of his pupil.\r\n\r\nWhen only ten years of age, Mr. Bryant produced several small poems,\r\nwhich, though of course marked by the defects and puerilities of so\r\nimmature an age, were yet thought to possess sufficient merit to be\r\npublished in the newspaper of a neighboring village--the Hampshire\r\nGazette. His friends, though pleased with these early evidences of\r\ntalent, did not injure him with injudicious flattery, but, in the\r\nspirit of Dryden's simile, treated them\r\n\r\n    \"As those who unripe veins in mines explore,\r\n      On the rich bed again the warm turf lay,\r\n    Till time digests the yet imperfect ore,\r\n      Knowing it would be gold another day.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bryant acquired the rudiments of his school education under the\r\ncare, first of the Rev. Mr. Snell of Brookfield, and then under\r\nthat of the Rev. Mr. Hallock of Plainfield, Massachusetts. They\r\nfound in him a sprightly and intelligent pupil, better pleased to\r\nlay up knowledge from books, and the silent meditation of nature,\r\nthan to join in the ordinary pastimes of children. He was quick of\r\napprehension, and diligent in pursuit. He rapidly ran through the\r\nusual preliminary studies; and in 1810, then in the sixteenth year\r\nof his age, was entered a member of the sophomore class of Williams'\r\nCollege. In that institution, he continued his studies with the same\r\nardor and enthusiasm. He was particularly noted for his fondness for\r\nthe classics, and in a little while made himself master of the more\r\ninteresting portions of the literature of Greece and Rome. But he\r\nhad not been in college more than a year or two, when he asked and\r\nprocured an honorable dismission, for the purpose of devoting himself\r\nto the study of the law. This he did in the office of Judge Howe of\r\nWorthington, and afterwards in that of the Hon. William Baylies of\r\nBridgewater, and, in 1815, was admitted to practice at the bar of\r\nPlymouth.\r\n\r\nBut, during the period of his studies, Mr. Bryant had not neglected\r\nthe cultivation of his poetic abilities. In 1808, before he went to\r\ncollege, he had published, in Boston, a satirical poem, which attracted\r\nso much attention, that a second edition was demanded in the course of\r\nthe next year. \"When it is remembered,\" observes Mr. Leggett, \"that\r\nthis work was given to the public by an author who had not completed\r\nhis fourteenth year, it cannot but be considered a remarkable instance\r\nof early maturity of mind. Pope's Ode to Solitude was written at twelve\r\nyears of age; but it possesses neither fancy nor feeling, and except\r\nfor the harmony of its versification, is entitled to no particular\r\npraise. His Translation of Sappho to Phaon is indeed an extraordinary\r\nproduction, and has uniformly received the warmest commendation from\r\nthe critics. Yet, it is but a translation, while the poem of our\r\nauthor, written still earlier in life, is an original effort, and as\r\nsuch cannot but be received with greater surprise, on account of the\r\nwonderful precocity of judgment, wit, and fancy it exhibits. Like\r\nCowley's Poetical Blossoms, it must have been composed when the writer\r\nwas little more than thirteen; but in point of merit, it is decidedly\r\nsuperior to these effusions of unripened genius.\" Certain political\r\nstrictures on Mr. Jefferson and his party, which this poem contained,\r\nhave given rise, since Mr. Bryant has become conspicuous as an ardent\r\nfriend of democracy, to charges of political inconsistency and\r\nfaithlessness. They are charges, however, that require no refutation;\r\nand we refer to them now only to remark, that it is a singular evidence\r\nof Mr. Bryant's integrity and discernment, that the only point of\r\nattack which embittered enemies have found in his whole life, are his\r\nunconsidered mutterings when a stripling of only thirteen, living in\r\ntimes of high political excitement, and among a people who were all of\r\none way of thinking. How few pass through life with characters so pure\r\nand unassailable!\r\n\r\nBut what chiefly contributed to give Mr. Bryant rank as a poet, was\r\nthe publication, in the North American Review of 1816, of the poem of\r\nThanatopsis, written four years before, in 1812. That a young man, not\r\nyet nineteen, should have produced a poem so lofty in conception, and\r\nso beautiful in execution, so full of chaste language, and delicate and\r\nstriking imagery--and above all, so pervaded by a noble and cheerful\r\nreligious philosophy--may well be regarded as one of the most wonderful\r\nevents of literary history. And the wonder is increased when we learn,\r\nthat this sublime lyric was followed, in the course of the few next\r\nyears, by the \"Inscription for an Entrance into a Wood,\" written in\r\n1813, and published in the North American in 1817; by the \"Waterfowl,\"\r\nwritten in in 1816, and published in 1818; and by the \"Fragment of\r\nSimonides,\" written in 1811, and published in 1818. In 1821, he wrote\r\nhis largest poem, \"The Ages,\" which was delivered before the Phi Beta\r\nKappa Society of Harvard College, and soon after published at Boston,\r\nin a small volume, in connection with the poems we have already\r\nmentioned, and some others. The appearance of this volume at once\r\nestablished the fame of Mr. Bryant as a poet.\r\n\r\nIn the same year Mr. Bryant married a young and amiable lady, Miss\r\nFairchild, of Great Barrington, Mass., whither he had removed to\r\nprosecute his profession. He was both skilful and successful as a\r\nlawyer, but the labor of the vocation clashing with his poetic and\r\nmoral sensibilities, induced him, after a ten years' practice, to\r\nremove, in 1825, to the city of New-York, to commence a career of\r\nliterary effort. His fame, which had preceded him, soon procured\r\nhim the editorship of the New-York Review, which he managed, in\r\nconnection with other gentlemen, with great industry and talent. About\r\nthe same time he joined Mr. Gulian C. Verplanck, Mr. Robert Sands,\r\nand Fitz-Greene Halleck, and several young artists of the city, in\r\nthe production of an Annual called \"The Talisman,\" which for beauty\r\nand variety of contents, has not been surpassed, even in these more\r\nprolific days of Annuals. Some of Mr. Bryant's contributions to\r\nit place him as a prose writer beside the best of any nation. The\r\nnarrative of the \"Whirlwind,\" for accurate description, condensed\r\nenergy and eloquence of expression, and touching incident, has always\r\nstruck us as one of the master-pieces of writing.\r\n\r\nIn 1827, Mr. Bryant became an editor of the New-York Evening Post,\r\nand since then, with the exception of the years 1834 and '49, when\r\nhe travelled with his family in Europe, has had the almost exclusive\r\ncontrol of that journal. It is by his conduct in this capacity, that he\r\nhas acquired his standing as a politician.\r\n\r\nWe have cause, then, to speak of Mr. Bryant's political character.\r\nWhen he first undertook the management of the Evening Post, that paper\r\nhad taken no decided stand in the politics of the day. Its leanings,\r\nhowever, were towards the aristocratic party. Mr. Bryant soon infused\r\ninto its columns some portion of his native originality and spirit. Its\r\npolitics assumed a higher tone, its disquisitions on public measures\r\nbecame daily more pointed and stirring, and, finally, it declared with\r\ngreat boldness on what was considered the more liberal side. From that\r\nday to this, it has taken a leading part in political controversies,\r\nand exerted a controlling influence over public opinion. In the fierce\r\nexcitement kindled by General Jackson's attack upon the United States\r\nBank, in the hot debates of the tariff and internal improvement\r\nquestions, and in the deeply-agitating, almost convulsive contest\r\nwhich prostrated the banking system, the Evening Post maintained the\r\nstrongest ground, was generally in advance of its day, and never\r\nfaltered or flinched in the assertion of the severest tenets of the\r\ndemocratic creed. Unlike most journals, it did not satisfy itself with\r\nan undiscriminating defence of the temporary doctrines of party, but,\r\nregardless alike of friend and foe, yet cautiously and calmly, it\r\nexpressed the whole truth in its length and breadth.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which Mr. Bryant has conducted these controversies is in\r\nthe highest degree honorable to him. He has disdained the miserable\r\narts by which small minds achieve the triumphs of their party or their\r\nown profit. Drawing his principles from the independent conclusions\r\nof his own mind, he has not shifted with every wind of doctrine. He\r\nhas regarded politics, not as the strife of opposing interests, nor\r\nas a factious struggle for party supremacy, nor yet as a predatory\r\nwarfare for the spoils of success, but as the solemn conflict of great\r\nprinciples. He has studied it as a comprehensive science, in which\r\nthe rights and happiness of millions of men are interested, and which\r\nhas issues and dependencies spreading over the events of many years.\r\nIn this light, he has sought to teach its truths, with conscientious\r\nfidelity.\r\n\r\nHis intellectual adaptation to his calling is in many respects a\r\nstriking one. With a mind of quick sagacity, strong reasoning powers,\r\nready wit, and an inexhaustible fertility, he has been able to perform\r\nits incessant and laborious duties with signal success. Disciplined,\r\nas well as enriched by severe study, he has added to the learning of\r\nbooks the attainments of extensive observation and travel. His style is\r\nremarkable for its purity and elegance, no less than for the felicity\r\nof its illustrations. In controversy, he most frequently resorts to a\r\ncaustic but graceful irony. He is playful without being vulgar, pointed\r\nwithout grossness, sharp as a Damascus blade, and just as polished.\r\nNor are the compactness and strength of his expression less to be\r\nadmired, than his uniform perspicuity and ease. That he is sometimes\r\nunnecessarily cutting, as some complain, is a fault, if it exist, that\r\nsprings from the native integrity of his mind, and the secluded and\r\nrefined nature of his pursuits. It has seemed to us, however, that this\r\nalleged severity is no more than the spirit of justice as it manifests\r\nitself in a pure and honest mind. For we doubt if a man more perfectly\r\njust, and less liable to be warped by the questionable compliances of\r\nsociety, ever lived.\r\n\r\nWe shall not enter into any criticism of Mr. Bryant's poetry here,\r\nbecause it has been so fully estimated before, that there is no need of\r\ndoing so again; but there is one view which has been taken of it, on\r\nwhich we shall offer a few remarks. That view occurs in the following\r\npassage of Mr. J. R. Lowell's Fable for Critics:\r\n\r\n    \"There is Bryant, as quiet, as cool, and as dignified,\r\n    As a smooth, silent iceberg that never is ignified,\r\n    Save when by reflection 'tis kindled o' nights\r\n    With a semblance of flame by the chill Northern Lights.\r\n    He may rank (Griswold says so) first bard of your nation,\r\n    (There's no doubt that he stands in supreme ice-olation,)\r\n    Your topmost Parnassus he may set his heel on,\r\n    But no warm applauses come, peal following peal on,--\r\n    He's too smooth and too polished to hang any zeal on:\r\n    Unqualified merits, I'll grant, if you choose, he has 'em,\r\n    But he lacks the one merit of kindling enthusiasm;\r\n    If he stir you at all, it is just, on my soul,\r\n    Like being stirred up with the very North Pole,\r\n      \"He is very nice reading in summer, but _inter_\r\n    _Nos_, we don't want _extra_ freezing in winter;\r\n    Take him up in the depth of July, my advice is,\r\n    When you feel an Egyptian devotion to ices.\r\n    But, deduct all you can, there's enough that's right good in him,\r\n    He has a true soul for field, river, and wood in him;\r\n    And his heart in the midst of brick walls, or where'er it is,\r\n    Glows, softens, and thrills with the tenderest charities--\r\n    To you mortals that delve in this trade-ridden planet?\r\n    No, to old Berkshire's hills, with their limestone and granite.\r\n    If you're one who _in loco_ (add _foco_ here) _desipis_,\r\n    You will get out of his outermost heart (as I guess) a piece;\r\n    But you'd get deeper down if you came as a precipice,\r\n    And would break the last seal of its inwardest fountain,\r\n    If you could only palm yourself off for a mountain.\r\n    Mr. Quivis, or somebody quite as discerning,\r\n    Some scholar who's hourly expecting his learning,\r\n    Calls B. the American Wordsworth; but Wordsworth\r\n    Is worth near as much as your whole tuneful herd's worth.\r\n    No, don't be absurd, he's an excellent Bryant;\r\n    But, my friends, you'll endanger the life of your client,\r\n    By attempting to stretch him up into a giant:\r\n    If you choose to compare him, I think there are two persons\r\n    fit for a parallel--Thomson and Cowper;\r\n    I don't mean exactly,--there's something of each,\r\n    There's T.'s love of nature, C.'s penchant to preach;\r\n    Just mix up their minds so that C.'s spice of craziness\r\n    Shall balance and neutralize T.'s turn for laziness,\r\n    And it gives you a brain cool, quite frictionless, quiet,\r\n    Whose internal police nips the buds of all riot,--\r\n    A brain like a permanent strait-jacket put on\r\n    The heart which strives vainly to burst off a button,--\r\n    A brain which, without being slow or mechanic,\r\n    Does more than a larger less drilled, more volcanic;\r\n    He's a Cowper condensed, with no craziness bitten,\r\n    And the advantage that Wordsworth before him has written.\r\n\r\nNow, what is the main charge here: that Mr. Bryant, while he has great\r\nsympathy with external nature, with mountains and precipices, has no\r\nsympathy with his fellow-man. 'Tis a weighty charge--the weightiest\r\nthat can be made against a man or a poet. It says virtually that he\r\nhas no soul, no heart, no impulse, no feeling, except for brutes and\r\nvegetables; in short, that he is no better than a heathen savage, a\r\nregular worshipper of stocks and stones, without natural affection, or\r\nwithout God in the world. \"For,\" as the apostle queries very wisely,\r\n\"if he love not man, whom he hath seen, how can he love God, whom he\r\nhath not seen?\" Your lines, then, Mr. Quiz, imply nothing less than\r\nblack, bleak, barren, unredeemed practical Atheism!\r\n\r\nBut can there be the remotest semblance of truth in them? Is our Bryant\r\nsuch a heathen or atheist as not to know his fellow-men except they\r\npresent themselves in the disguise of mountains, or he see them, like\r\nthe prophet, as trees walking? We appeal to you, young ladies, who have\r\nbeen melted into tears by his pathos. We appeal to you, young men,\r\nwhose every purpose of good has been quickened into livelier action by\r\nhis words; and to you, old heads, whose experience has learned a riper\r\nand mellower wisdom from his fine meditative views of the ends and aims\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nYet, before you render your concurrent answers, with somewhat of\r\nindignation that anybody could put you upon the task, let us, in good\r\nAmerican sort, begin with a few statistics. This is a question of fact,\r\nand since it has been raised, we will determine it by facts.\r\n\r\nThere are, in Carey & Hart's splendid edition of Bryant--we mean\r\nsplendid as to the typography and paper, and not inclusive of those\r\nill-drawn sketches of Leutze, who has made the women all German and\r\ngiven Mr. William Tell of Switzerland a straddle as wide as the\r\nDardanelles, to say nothing of the hideous face of Rizpah and that\r\nMonk so excessively huge as to stand some forty feet from the pillar\r\nagainst which he leans--this splendid edition, we say, contains just\r\none hundred and thirty-two poems, all told, to which,--stand up and\r\nlisten, to the sentence, Mr. Lowell!--more than seventy refer wholly to\r\nsubjects of an exclusively human interest--man in his being and doing,\r\nwhile nine out of ten of the rest, though occupied primarily with\r\nsome phase of external nature, are yet so managed as to weave a deep\r\nand beautiful human philosophy,--with the dull and dead proceedings\r\nof the mechanical world. Yes, Mr. Critic, we say that there is a\r\nvery fine, a very rich, a very noble and very touching vein of human\r\nsentiment, which runs through all of Bryant's writings, whereby, even\r\nas much as Wordsworth, he makes these mountains and precipices a part\r\nof our human life, and whereby, too, he makes the whole of us, who\r\nread him lovingly, that is, who read him at all, much better men and\r\nwomen, in our several spheres. No human sympathies forsooth! Why there\r\nare hundreds, nay, thousands, of us, who have derived many of their\r\ntenderest and noblest humanities from this very cold-blooded He-Daphne;\r\nthis fleshless marble Apollo,--this Ice-Palace and Alpine glacier,--far\r\nshining brilliant, but oh how frigid!\r\n\r\nBy poems of an exclusive human interest, we mean, such as bear directly\r\non man's experience and duties and relations in this life: such as\r\nthe Ages, for instance, which commemorates the progress of humanity,\r\nthrough all its trials and triumphs: such as Thanatopsis, which makes\r\nthe grave glorious, and pours the light of a lofty and serene religion\r\naround our darkest hour: such as the Old Man's Funeral, more divine in\r\nits descriptive beauty than the best sermon we ever heard: such as the\r\nBattle Field, which animates us with the voice of trumpet to meet the\r\nstern struggles of daily warfare: and such as many others in the same\r\nvein, to say nothing of the Murdered Traveller, the Massacre at Scio,\r\nthe Hunter of the Prairies, the Living Lost, the Crowded Street, the\r\nGreek Boy, the Arctic Lover, the African Chief, the Child's Funeral,\r\n&c., &c. These could only have been prompted by a strong feeling of\r\nsympathy with man, and though executed with the nicest finish of art,\r\nare yet full of touching pathos and sentiment. The best proof of this\r\nis, that they invariably excite the emotions they were intended to\r\nexcite--and that, too, in no milk and waterish way. They sink straight\r\ninto the heart; they open the fountains of the feelings; they send the\r\nsalt water to the eyes (if that be needed); they make the blood tingle;\r\nin short, they produce that all-overishness which comes upon one when\r\nhe sees a fine action on the stage, or reads a noble passage in an\r\noration, or looks at Lentze's Washington. Try it on yourself, if you\r\ndon't believe it, or, what is better, try it on your little girl and\r\nboy, whose feelings are not yet case-hardened or frozen over! It will\r\nbe a queer kind of frigidity that they will be witness to. Why, bless\r\nyour soul, Mr. Lowell, we are free to confess that we have ourselves\r\nlong, long ago, cried over the Indian Girl's Lament, and the Death of\r\nthe Flowers,--yes, cried, and we say it without shame,--indeed, with\r\na strange sense of regret that we cannot cry now over things of that\r\nsort. _Eheu, eheu fugaces_, &c.\r\n\r\nMore than that, we have asseverated that even in poems which are\r\nnot immediately emotional, which are directed to some phase of mere\r\nexternal nature, the humanitary tendencies of Bryant break out, or\r\nshine through as veins of silver from the rocks. It is, in fact,\r\none of his most charming peculiarities, that he habitually connects\r\ngreat moral and social truths with the various aspects of nature. His\r\nmuse is never satisfied with celebrating the pomp and glory of the\r\nexternal world; she must find a deeper meaning in all than what the\r\neye sees or the ear hears; she must trace some beautiful analogy,\r\nsome spiritual significance on which both mind and heart can repose.\r\nBryant's descriptions of nature, it is granted, are accurate to a line;\r\nwhat he speaks he knows; he finds no nightingales nor cowslips just\r\nthree thousand miles away from where it is possible for them to live;\r\nand he never writes from his memory of books; yet his descriptions\r\nare more than mere descriptions,--dull scientific catalogues of\r\nquantities,--herbariums of dried plants,--museums of withered lifeless\r\ntwigs, and of stuffed animals standing thereupon! They have all a\r\nmeaning under them--a hidden wisdom--a genial yet profound human soul.\r\nIt is thus that he has wound our affections around the North Star, the\r\nWinds, Monument Mountain, and even the Ruffled Grouse. How often, too,\r\nin the midst of his general meditations and philosophizings, does some\r\ntouching individual allusion creep in, to show that the poet's heart is\r\nall alive with sensibility: as in the Hymn to Death, which closes with\r\nthat solemn monody on the Departure of his Father:\r\n\r\n    \"Alas! I little thought that the stern Power,\r\n    Whose fearful praise I sung, would try me thus,\r\n    Before the strain was ended. It must cease.--\r\n    For he is in his grave, who taught my youth\r\n    The art of verse, and in the bud of life\r\n    Offered me to the Muses. Oh, cut off\r\n    Untimely! when the reason in its strength\r\n    Ripened by years of toil and studious search,\r\n    And watch of Nature's silent lessons, taught\r\n    The hand to practice best the lenient art,\r\n    To which thou gavest thy laborious days,\r\n    And last, thy life. And, therefore, when the earth\r\n    Received thee, tears were in unyielding eyes,\r\n    And on hard cheeks, and they who deemed thy skill\r\n    Delayed their death hour, shuddered and turned pale\r\n    When thou wert gone. This faltering verse which thou\r\n    Shalt not, as wont, o'erlook, is all I have\r\n    To offer at thy grave,--this--and the hope\r\n    To copy thy example, and to leave\r\n    A name of which the wretched shall not think\r\n    As of an enemy's, whom they forgive\r\n    As all forgive the dead. Rest, therefore, thou\r\n    Whose early guidance trained my infant steps--\r\n    Rest, on the bosom of God, till the brief sleep\r\n    Of Death is over--and a happier life\r\n    Shall dawn to waken thine insensible dust!\"\r\n\r\nDoes an iceberg write in that strain, we should like to know? Or does\r\nit mourn the death of the flowers, in this wise:\r\n\r\n    \"And then I think of one, who in her youthful beauty died,\r\n    The fair meek blossom that grew up and faded by my side,\r\n    In the cold moist earth we laid her, when the forest cast the leaf,\r\n    And we wept that one so lovely should have a life so brief.\r\n    Yet not unmeet it was that one like that young friend of ours,\r\n    So gentle and so beautiful, should perish with the flowers.\"\r\n\r\nOr do icebergs yearn thus for communion in the after world with the\r\nbeloved spirits of this:\r\n\r\n    \"In meadows fanned by Heaven's life-breathing wind\r\n      In the resplendence of that glorious sphere,\r\n    And larger movements of the unfettered mind\r\n      Wilt thou forget the love that joined us here?\r\n\r\n    The love that lived through all the stormy past,\r\n      And meekly with my harsher nature bore,\r\n    And deeper grew and tenderer to the last,\r\n      Shall it expire with life and be no more?\"\r\n\r\nTruly, that iceberg theory must be surrendered, it must melt and give\r\nway before the gentle warmth of these words, and the thousand other\r\nsuch words which any reader of Bryant will instantly recall.\r\n\r\nBut, having convinced and confuted Mr. Critic, we will proceed to\r\nobserve that there is after all a foundation of truth--a slender\r\none--for his towering superstructure of ridicule. It is this: that in\r\nthe outset of his career, Mr. Bryant's sympathies were, not too much\r\nwith external Nature, but too little with Man. At the same time, we\r\nmaintain that he has been constantly correcting this fault, and has\r\nwritten more and more, the older he has grown, to the human heart. He\r\nis not, and we hope never will be, a passionate writer, like Byron:\r\nhe is not one who deals, like Burns, with the warm, gushing, homely\r\naffections of the poor every where: he has none of Schiller's energy of\r\nconviction: none of the naive, playful garrulous bonhomie of Beranger;\r\nsimply, because he is of another order of man from all these. He is\r\nquiet, gentle, contemplative, modest,--wise. Yet if no lava-tides\r\nof passion burn through his veins, as were said to run through the\r\nveins of Alfieri; if he is not, as Carlyle said of Dante, \"a red-hot\r\ncone of fire\" shooting steadily up into the sky; if he cannot, with\r\nShakespeare, or Goethe, make the blood quiver and thrill for weeks by a\r\nsingle word; he is still not a frigid, heartless writer, not altogether\r\nan ice mountain, which dazzles always but never warms. He is too\r\nearnest, too truthful, too good for that; too deeply penetrated by the\r\nspiritual realities of life, too democratic in his aspirations for our\r\nrace, too hopeful of the future developments of society, in short, too\r\nfinely touched with that feminine element which is the characteristic\r\nof genius. Besides, the great internal fires of the Earth, which shoot\r\nup in terrific and explosive violence, stupendous as they are, do not\r\nnurse the tender bud into life, nor cover the earth with verdure and\r\nfruit. This is left to the genial sunshine and the warm summer rains.\r\n\r\nIn private intercourse, Mr. Bryant is what all his writings, poetical\r\nas well as prose, indicate. His life is that of a student of\r\nelegant and lofty literature. He is reserved in his manner, almost\r\nto repulsiveness, yet in the social circle is witty, amiable, and\r\naffectionate. When his sympathies are interested, the spirit of\r\ntenderness and benevolence gleams like a flame from his eyes, and plays\r\naround his features in a beautiful radiance. In his opinions of men, he\r\nendeavors to be just; but when he is not just, the leaning is towards\r\nthe side of mercy. A strong natural irritability has been disciplined\r\nby stern effort into the subjection of reason; and his tastes and\r\nhabits, though refined by careful culture, are as simple as those of a\r\nchild. Those who know him best are at a loss which most to admire, the\r\nsuperiority of his faculties, or the modesty of his deportment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLIDING SCALES OF DESPAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe London _Morning Chronicle_, after an observation that a hurriedly\r\nwritten epitaph always appears, in the course of time, to require\r\nrevisal, expresses its admiration for the good sense of a Parisian\r\nsculptor, who, when he took his instructions for a monument, insisted\r\nupon the _veuve inconsolable_ or the heartstricken husband penning the\r\nintended inscription, and even signing the holograph, as a further\r\nauthority to him for immortalizing so much utter despair. \"The day\r\nbefore the record was actually to be cut for eternity, his habit was to\r\nsend the inscription book to the mourner's house, lest any correction\r\nshould be desired. The havoc which, upon receiving back the volume, he\r\nusually found made among laudatory adjectives and adverbs of infinity,\r\nwas, to a good man, a delightful evidence of the cooling and healing\r\npowers of time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH IN YOUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n            WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n                           BY H.

We have, however, chosen the most unpretending as\r\nthe subject of our present remarks, since, for the thinking majority of\r\nour readers, it will undoubtedly prove the most interesting. The volume\r\nto which we allude is entitled, _Des Auswanderers' Handbuch_, or, _The\r\nEmigrants' Hand-book: a True Sketch of the United States of North\r\nAmerica, and Reliable Counsellor for Men of every Rank and Condition\r\nwho propose Emigrating Thither: by_ GEORGE M. VON ROSS, of North\r\nAmerica, Editor of the \"_Allgemeinen Auswanderungs-Zeitung_\" (Universal\r\nEmigration Journal). Published at Elberfeld and Iserlohn, by Julius\r\nBaedeker.\r\n\r\nThe author, according to his preface, is an American by birth, and\r\nwas for many years a farmer in the eastern, western, and southwestern\r\nsections of the United States. That he is not without learning\r\nand ability is evinced by his remarkably excellent work entitled\r\n_Taschen-Fremdwörterbuch, oder Verdeutschung von mehr als 16,000\r\nFremdwörter_--(_i. e._ a Pocket Dictionary of Foreign Words, or the\r\nadoption into German of more than Sixteen Thousand Foreign Words).\r\nThis book is familiar in Germany, and exhibits great philological\r\nacumen, as well as a thorough knowledge of German in its minutest\r\ndifficulties. At one time Mr. Ross distinguished himself by attacking\r\nSchröter's well-known pamphlet relative to the Catholic emigration to\r\nSt. Mary's, in Pennsylvania, and he has since published a smaller work\r\nfor emigrants, entitled _Rathschlage und Warnungen_, or, Counsels and\r\nWarning.\r\n\r\nThe performance now before us is written in that straightforward\r\npractical style which may be best characterized by the statement that\r\n\"He had something to say, _and he said it_.\" That it is impartial is\r\nnot its least merit. A foreigner, it is true, may occasionally be found\r\nwho passes unprejudiced judgments on another country, but that any one\r\nstill retaining home-born sympathies and feelings with his native land\r\nshould do so is a wonder. And we deem it a creditable thing in this\r\nwork, that where he is called upon to describe any calling, trade,\r\nor profession, he is not afraid to say boldly--In this calling the\r\nGerman cannot succeed--in that, he is unapt--in a third, the American\r\nsurpasses him; while, on the other hand, he amply encourages the\r\nemigrant as regards occupations for which he is qualified. Many writers\r\nof such books have cast a _couleur de rose_ light over every thing\r\n(well knowing that by such means their books would be more saleable),\r\nand induced industrious men, following callings unheard of in this\r\ncountry, to emigrate, in the absurd hope of finding more constant and\r\nbetter paid employment here than at home. An intelligent American, who\r\nwould not cross the Atlantic, or hardly ascend in a balloon, without\r\npreviously _calculating_ the time and chances of arrival or descent,\r\nand who certainly would do neither without first informing himself as\r\nto every imaginable particular of his ultimate destination, can hardly\r\nconceive the vast necessity of such books. He would, by every means,\r\ngather information from those who had visited in person the destined\r\nland. Not so the common German emigrant. Thousands embark in the belief\r\nthat New-York is some mysterious golden-glowing Indian city, surrounded\r\nby orange groves and palm-trees. In the village of Weinsberg, in\r\nSuabia, several years since, a well-educated student was overheard to\r\nremark of some peasants, \"Tell them that in your country the people\r\nhave two heads, and they'll believe you.\"\r\n\r\nLet us now, by extracts, give our readers an idea of the manner in\r\nwhich Mr. Von Ross describes the land of his birth to the land of his\r\nadoption. The first item of interest is his sketches of the respective\r\ncharacteristics of the Yankee and Southerner.\r\n\r\n\"Superficial observers have spoken of the inhabitant of the Northern\r\nStates as if money were his only aim--as if he were inspired only by\r\nselfishness and avarice--and as if he estimated men by the weight of\r\ntheir purses. But those who regard him closely, and judge otherwise\r\nthan by first appearances, will discover in him a calculating\r\n(_berechnenden_), enterprising, thoroughly practical man, caring\r\nlittle for pleasure, and seeking his recreation (_erholung_) in the\r\ndomestic circle. They will find in him a man who, with iron industry,\r\nfights his way through life, esteeming wealth, it is true--not the\r\ninherited, however, but _the earned_, which testifies to the ability\r\nof its possessor. A man, in fine, who with unbending courage bears\r\nthe blow of destiny, and is thereby only stimulated to new exertions.\r\nThe Southerner, on the contrary, is more _chivalresque_--he lives to\r\nlive. The climate in which he is born has also a material influence\r\nupon his manners, customs, and character: effecting, in reality, the\r\nsame difference which we observe between the cool, reflective, tough\r\nNorth German, and the jovial, genial, easily excited South German,\r\nor Frenchman. We would hardly have deemed it necessary to inform the\r\nreader that in _thus_ sketching the inhabitants of the United States in\r\nlight outlines, we do not include the mixed and Europeanized population\r\nof the Atlantic cities, had we not learned by experience that many\r\ntravellers slightly acquainted only with the Atlantic States and their\r\nvicinity, have from these sketched all North America and its people. He\r\nwho would know the American, must also know the cities of the interior.\r\n\r\n\"If, in addition to these characteristics, we should describe the\r\npersonal and distinctive appearance of the Northerner and Southerner,\r\nwe would say that the first are, generally speaking, large, tall,\r\nand spare--their ladies beautiful and of delicate complexion; while\r\nthe Southerners are broad-shouldered and powerful--the female sex\r\nbeing voluptuously formed and beautiful, but when not subject to the\r\ninfluence of exercise and fresh air of a sallow complexion.\r\n\r\n\"Every North American is--and who has a better right so to _be_--an\r\nenthusiastic _honorer (vereher) of his fatherland_, but he does not\r\nmeasure out by inches the limits of his native land, or bound his\r\npatriotism by the clod on which his cradle rested--for to him the\r\nroar of the Rio del Norte, the thunder-peal of Niagara, and the\r\nmurmur of the Pacific or Atlantic oceans have equally a familiar,\r\nhome-like sound. Nor less than the land of his birth does he esteem\r\nits laws, constitution, and institutions, and regards them in nowise\r\nas oppressive, but as protective. Those laws he made for himself, and\r\nchose himself as their executor. RESPECT FOR THE LAW is to the American\r\nself-respect.\r\n\r\n\"The so often blamed _national pride_ of the American, if not really\r\npraiseworthy, is at least pardonable; for a nation which could rise\r\nlike a single man, and, at every sacrifice, throw off the yoke\r\nof England--a nation which has given birth to such men as GEORGE\r\nWASHINGTON, THOMAS JEFFERSON, BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, and many others whose\r\nnames are mentioned with wonder all over this world--a nation which\r\noccupies the first rank in trade, commerce, and industry, _may_ be\r\nproud, and _must_ be proud, as long as its power is free from sloth and\r\nlethargy.\"\r\n\r\nAnd here we may be permitted to interrupt for an instant our noble\r\nMan of Ross (the reader will observe that he wears the aristocratic\r\n_von_), for the sake of saying a good word over this honest,\r\nhard-fisted go-ahead eulogium of our country. There be those\r\nultra-Europeanized, or _soi-disant_ refinedly educated Americans,\r\nwho will complacently smile at this recapitulation of United States\r\nexcellencies, and if slangily inclined, brand it as \"pea-nut,\" \"stump\r\neloquence,\" and \"Fourth-of-Julyism.\" The sum-total being, that it\r\nis vulgar rhodomontade. With all due respect, we think differently.\r\nLet the reader remember that this is addressed to a German--a\r\n_foreign_--audience, who are greatly in need just at present of a\r\nfew scraps of such oratory as this, were it only to counteract the\r\nmalignant influences of the English tourists, whose works are far more\r\nextensively read in Germany than we imagine. Mrs. Trollope's work on\r\nAmerica, which, at the present day, is regarded only with contempt or\r\nlaughter by the educated in England, has been, and is even yet, read\r\nwith a feeling akin to wonder by the honest simple-hearted Germans. A\r\nwonder indeed so intense, at the marvellous marvels therein narrated,\r\nthat it generally results in inspiring in the mind of the reader\r\ncredulous enough to believe, an intense desire to visit the land of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\n\"In no part of the world are ladies treated with so much respect as in\r\nNorth America. They can make, by land or water, the longest journeys\r\nwithout the apprehension of having their sense of delicacy offended\r\nby hearing an improper expression, and, as far as _public_ opinion is\r\nconcerned, the law allows them privileges greater than they obtain in\r\nany other country. By marriage, the wife enters at once into equal\r\npossession of her husband's property; the simple testimony of a woman\r\nis of the same force as the oath of a man, and the testimony of a woman\r\nwhen confirmed by oath, can only be neutralized by the oaths of three\r\nmen. The ill-treatment of a wife by her husband is severely punished;\r\nbut such cases are as unusual of occurrence as that a woman takes undue\r\nadvantage of her rights. It may moreover be confidently asserted, that\r\nAmerica is the true home of connubial love. The consciousness of her\r\nrights gives the American lady a dignity of manner which admirably\r\nblends with the amiable attractions of her sex. Not a little of the\r\nfascination so peculiar to the ladies of North America is, however,\r\ndue to the circumstance that no woman--not even the poorest--is ever\r\nobliged to perform any task based upon merely physical strength. She\r\nrules at _home_ undisputed; and this is the reason why the poorest\r\nhouse in America is a model of neatness and order.\"\r\n\r\n\"'_Help yourself_' (aid yourself), is a favorite phrase of the\r\nAmerican, and which has given him the character of wanting in charity,\r\nwhile in fact it is nothing but a simple indication of the means\r\nby which every man in sound health can in that country relieve his\r\npoverty. _Work_ in America is neither difficult to obtain, nor is\r\nit hemmed in and oppressed by the regulations and requirements of\r\n_guilds_, unions, and peculiar laws. _Beggars_ and _vagabonds_ find\r\nindeed no favor in his eyes; but unfortunate guiltless poverty\r\ninvariably meets with his warmest aid, as is evidenced by the numerous\r\nhospitals, institutions, &c., which would astonish any one reflecting\r\non the youth of the country. Kindness and hospitality may also be\r\nincluded among his virtues.\r\n\r\n\"From which the reader may justly infer, that beggary and theft are\r\nrare in the United States; and though it may be alleged that such\r\noccurrences are frequent in the large cities, it may be at the same\r\ntime remembered that these are the _rendezvous_ of the scum of all\r\nnations, while on the other hand the fact, that in the country, and\r\neven in the villages, locks are rare on house and stable doors, affords\r\nthe strongest confirmation that America presents by far fewer instances\r\nof robbery than the greater part of Europe.\"\r\n\r\nAfter which, Herr Von Ross indulges in a few attractive remarks on the\r\nfacility of marriage in America, which would, however, prove far less\r\nastonishing to our American, than to his German readers: concluding\r\nwith the following paragraph, which is not devoid of a certain degree\r\nof observation:\r\n\r\n\"Young married couples whose means will not permit them to keep house,\r\npass their first year of wedded life in boarding-houses, by which means\r\nthe facilities to marriage are greatly extended.\"\r\n\r\nThe following passages on our alleged want of sociability identify\r\nus to a certain degree, and to our minds not unpleasantly, with our\r\nEnglish cousins. Of all persons, those to be most pitied or despised\r\nare \"the weak brethren,\" who, devoid of internal or intellectual\r\nresources, or manly self-reliance, declaim against a nation or a\r\nsociety at large because its members, forsooth, do not receive them\r\nwith open arms. The true _citoyen du monde_--the genuine cosmopolite,\r\nnever has occasion to make this complaint against any country. For the\r\nmore a man depends on himself and the less on others for happiness,\r\njust in that proportion will it be his luck to attract sympathy and\r\nsociability when among strangers. Narrow-minded Spaniards, and those\r\nof other nations, _who travel for the express purpose of getting into\r\nfashionable society_, are peculiarly liable to this reproach. Such a\r\nforeigner have we heard, minutely and boringly detailing to a stern\r\ncircle of impregnable natives, the noble and munificent style of\r\nhospitality with which _they_ would be treated, were they visitors\r\nin _his_ fatherland: \"In my contree 'spose you come strangére in one\r\ncittee, a gentleman take you in hees house. In ze morning come one\r\nbuttiful gairl wiz coffees. Zen dey send you one horse carriage for\r\nmake de promenàde. Aftair dinner come buttiful gairls again wiz ticket\r\non silvare waiter for whole opera box! Wat you sink of dat, hey?\"\r\n\"_Think!_\" replied a native, \"why I think that you take great pains to\r\nmake a strange gentleman feel _very uncomfortable_.\" But to return to\r\nour writer.\r\n\r\n\"Strangers who have hastily travelled and superficially examined\r\nAmerica, and those who have judged by the statements of others rather\r\nthan by their own experience, have ascribed to the American a want of\r\nsociability and a stiff and repulsive manner towards strangers. True\r\nit is that in America it is no very easy matter to become intimate\r\nwith a man or establish one's self in his family circle--but he who\r\nhas once attained this point, becomes a home friend in the fullest\r\nsense of the word, and will find hidden beneath the stern, earnest\r\nexterior of the American, a warm heart, and in his conversation a\r\nremarkable degree of familiar confidence. Those who have detected in\r\nthe confident manner and sense of independence which the American\r\nmanifests, any thing approaching to presumption, must assuredly have\r\nbeen the newly arrived, who could not accustom themselves to the idea\r\nthat even laborers should consider that they had with others equal\r\nright to express their opinions. The man, however, who is free from\r\nprejudice will not fail to admire a nation, wherein the poorest is on\r\nan equality with the richest, and where the rich, at least, do not\r\ntake it on themselves to assert their superiority. Seldom, indeed, do\r\nwe find a native American, conscious of his right to equality, giving\r\na stranger (his possible superior in intelligence or education) to\r\nunderstand that he considers himself quite as good as any one--the\r\nright is to him a thing so natural, that it never even occurs to\r\nhim to boast of it. This is, unfortunately, far from being the case\r\nwith the majority of the more ignorant German emigrants, accustomed\r\nin their own country to oppressive laws, and not unfrequently hard\r\ntreatment, yet without learning the orderly conduct which these should\r\nhave taught, and who think that in America they have a right to do as\r\nthey please. The American Germans seem to entertain the opinion that\r\nit is their republican duty, at all times, with or without occasion\r\nor provocation, to give to every man belonging in Europe to the\r\nhigher classes, to understand and feel that the difference of rank\r\nis not recognized--as if indeed, in America far more than in Europe,\r\neducation and culture did not of themselves indicate the rank which\r\na man occupies. These American Germans all nourish the jealousy of\r\ntrade (_Brodneid_) the miserable little hatreds, and the whole range\r\nof German disunity or local enmities, which they brought over with\r\nthem, with a care and zeal worthy of a better cause. Seldom indeed do\r\nwe hear a German there call himself German, he remains as of old a\r\nPrussian, a Bavarian, a Hanoverian, a Hessian, or an Altenburger. Even\r\nthe irritation between North and South Germans still continues, but let\r\none of them only get together so many scraps of English as will barely\r\nrender him intelligible, _then_ he denies his fatherland--Americanizes\r\nboth Christian and surnames--adopts tobacco chewing, and other evil\r\ncustoms of the New World, and draws on himself with full justice the\r\ncontempt of his more sensible fellow-countrymen and the ridicule of the\r\nAmericans. Let no one misunderstand us, we pronounce this hard judgment\r\nnot against the entire German population of North America, but still\r\na great--a very great portion thereof are with the fullest justice\r\nobnoxious to these charges, and he who has lived any time in the German\r\ndistricts of North America, and more particularly among the German, or\r\nGerman descended population of Pennsylvania, will agree with us with\r\nall his heart.\"\r\n\r\nThese are not amiable words, even if merited, but we must still admire\r\nthe energy with which the blow is given. Often have we despised the\r\ncontemptible and weak spirit which could induce so many almost newly\r\narrived Germans to change fine sounding and easily enunciable names,\r\ninto vulgar, snobbish appellatives for which no child would thank\r\nthem. Often have we wondered at the pitiable impertinence with which\r\nignorant Deutschers have taken it upon themselves, in the second\r\nrate American-German journals to abuse our national observance of\r\nthe Sabbath, or our respect for women, and despised the small-minded\r\neagerness with which they caught up any petty disrespect toward\r\nfemales, and cited it complacently as a proof that this noble attribute\r\nwas on the wane in _the land of their adoption_. Often have we been\r\namazed at the readiness with which illiterate rascals, whose ideas of\r\ngovernment or political liberty, were at home bounded by the word:\r\n\"_Polizei_,\" \"_Strafe_,\" \"_Wanderbuch_,\" \"_Zuchthaus_,\" and \"_Fechten_\"\r\ntake it upon themselves to curse, ban and vilify the only land in the\r\nworld where they could find bread or protection. But again, with Mr.\r\nRoss, we earnestly protest that we do _not_ believe that such conduct\r\nor such foolish ingratitude can ever with justice be attributed to any\r\nrespectable or well educated Germans. Some few there have been, indeed,\r\nwho, urged by the selfish stimulant of a desire for popularity, have\r\nthus flattered the prejudices of their more ignorant fellow-countrymen,\r\nbut none who have thus spoken from the heart.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we may remark that if, as has generally been said, we\r\nare a sensitive race, attaching undue importance to the good opinion of\r\nour neighbors, and striving infinitely more than we need to keep up a\r\ngood national reputation, we ought to be much obliged to all who, like\r\nMr. Ross, preach to other countries in their own tongue and with such a\r\npeculiarly distinct enunciation, their candid and unbiased opinion of\r\ntheir native land. What must strike the reader is indeed the remarkably\r\nunembarrassed and independent air with which he addresses his audience,\r\nand the coolness with which, on their own ground, he points out their\r\nown defects, and their general inferiority to the freemen of \"this\r\ngreat and glorious country.\" He tells them that America is a land of\r\nhard work--a church-going, Sabbath-keeping, God-fearing, moral land,\r\nfor which they must prepare themselves; and no Methodist ever assured\r\nhis flock of his solemn conviction that they were all irreclaimable\r\nsinners, with greater earnestness than Mr. Ross announces to his\r\npublic, in the plainest terms, that the great majority of the German\r\nemigrants to America are a pack of graceless, narrow-minded, ignorant,\r\nfatherland-denying knaves; ending with an earnest appeal to all whom\r\nit may concern, or are therein informed, to know if they do not with\r\nheart and soul (_aus vollum Flerzen_) coincide with him in these\r\nviews. But the American reader who for an instant imagines that Mr.\r\nRoss will lose either popularity or reputation among his auditors,\r\nis decidedly mistaken. Accustomed as we are to regard with nervous\r\nanxiety the slightest opinion of the most insignificant foreigner\r\nregarding our country, and to raise high very tornadoes of indignation\r\nagainst such writers as have abused our own manners and customs, we\r\ncan hardly conceive that an author after \"_giving it_\" to his readers\r\nin such a remarkably hot-and-heavy style, and, to make all perfectly\r\nintelligible, concluding with the assurance that it is from his very\r\nheart, can still proceed quietly, editing a paper, keeping up his list,\r\nand remaining unmobbed.\r\n\r\nBut we trust that the day is not distant when foreigners will no\r\nlonger be able to taunt us with undue sensitiveness. So rapidly have\r\nwe of late years increased in power, in wealth, in influence, that\r\nour conviction of our own might has not kept pace with its growth.\r\nLike the young giant in Rabelais, we have lain in our cradle without\r\nan attempt to break the chain. But with the consciousness of our vast\r\nand immovable moral and political superiority (a consciousness which\r\ndespite the good self-opinion so generally attributed to Americans,\r\nhas hitherto scarce dawned on us), will come a quiet disregard of the\r\nunited abuse and laughter of all Europe. A Dickens may _then_ issue\r\nhis \"Notes\"--a Marryatt, publish his \"Diary\"--without attracting the\r\nattention or anger of the American press from Maine to Mexico.\r\n\r\nAnd why need such works irritate our entire public _now_? Nay, we\r\nbelieve the period of our extravagant sensibility to foreign opinions\r\nmust at length be considered as past, and that hereafter we shall be\r\nmore in peril of excess of recklessness and bravado. The effect of this\r\nloss of a national characteristic we shall not here speculate upon. But\r\na brief period will be necessary for its illustration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGONDOLETTAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n            A RECOLLECTION OF MENDELSSHON'S \"SONGS WITHOUT\r\n                                WORDS.\"\r\n\r\n            WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n                           BY ALICE B.

It is very rare; the\r\nonly copy I know of, in this country, is the one with which I have been\r\nkindly furnished by my friend Mr. Campbell, the Deputy Librarian at the\r\nHague.\r\n\r\n[2] The substance of this interesting article was read by Mr. Brodhead\r\nat the last meeting of the Historical Society.--_Ed. International._\r\n\r\nIt purports to be a conversation between ten Dutch interlocutors,\r\nrespecting the trade of the Netherlands West India Company. The chief\r\nspeaker, is a Dutch \"schipper,\" who had been in New Netherland. In\r\nthe course of his remarks, he gives many very interesting and novel\r\ndetails, concerning the two directors, Kieft and Stuyvesant, and their\r\nrespective administrations. As some of these particulars have never\r\nbefore been known to our historians, I propose to translate a few of\r\nthe most interesting. It is very evident, however, that the narrator\r\nwas not a mere schipper of a merchant vessel. He was intimately\r\nacquainted with the details of the local politics of New Netherland;\r\nand evidently was personally unfriendly both to Kieft and Stuyvesant.\r\nFrom internal evidence, and for various other reasons, I have been\r\nled to believe that this little work was prepared by or under the\r\nsuperintendence of Cornelius Melyn, who had been one of the foremost\r\nand most consistent advocates of the popular cause under Kieft, and who\r\nsuffered gross injustice from the tyrannical and oppressive conduct of\r\nStuyvesant. The title-page of the tract states that it was \"prepared\r\nand compiled from divers true and veritable memorials, by 'I. A.,'\" who\r\nis described as G.W.O., perhaps Gezaghebber, or Director of the West\r\nIndia Company. Whoever these initials, I. A., are meant to represent,\r\nthe author seems to have fully adopted the views and expressed the\r\nfeelings of Melyn. While, therefore, some allowance should be made\r\nfor occasional exhibitions of personal bitterness, the statements in\r\nthe Breeden Raedt appear to be entitled to full credit, respecting\r\nthe facts which they relate. Some of these are entirely novel; others\r\nare confirmatory of what we have before known; all of them seem to be\r\nentirely harmonious with the story of New Netherland.\r\n\r\nThe antecedents of director Kieft, (of whom we have heretofore known\r\nlittle or nothing previously to his arrival at Manhattan in 1638), are\r\nthus related: \"William Kieft was born at Amsterdam. From youth he was\r\neducated as a merchant; and, after having taken charge of, or rather\r\nneglected, his own and his master's business, for a certain time, at\r\nRochelle, he happened to fail there. Upon which, according to custom,\r\nhis portrait was stuck upon the gallows there, as several living\r\nwitnesses, who have seen it with their own eyes, can yet testify. This\r\nman, having been for some time out of business, was employed to ransom\r\nseveral Christian prisoners out of Turkey. To such a bankrupt the\r\nmoney was intrusted. He went and freed some, for whom there was the\r\nleast to pay; but the others, whose friends had contributed the most\r\nmoney, he left in bondage. For these, their parents and friends were\r\nonce more obliged to raise funds. This fine brother was appointed by\r\nthe directors, to be Director over the inhabitants and trade of New\r\nNetherland in the year 1637.\"\r\n\r\nThe events of the Indian war in 1643, are referred to with a\r\ndistinctness which leaves little doubt that the narrator was himself,\r\none of the witnesses of them. In these respects, the Breeden Raedt\r\nconfirms the statements of De Vries and other authorities in the\r\nHolland documents at Albany. With respect to the transactions on Long\r\nIsland in 1644, and the civil and religious difficulties which divided\r\nthe people against director Kieft until his successor arrived in 1647,\r\nthe pamphlet exhibits several interesting and novel details.\r\n\r\nStuyvesant is described as \"the son of a clergyman in Friesland, and\r\nwho formerly, at Franiker (the seat of a famous high school, now\r\nextinct), had robbed the daughter of his own landlady. Being caught\r\nin the fact, he had been let off for his father's sake; otherwise it\r\nwould perhaps have been there, that he must have paid the penalty of\r\nhis first offence.\" On his arrival in New Netherland, Stuyvesant is\r\ndescribed as conducting himself as arrogantly as the \"Grand Duke of\r\nMoscovy,\" and as promptly taking the side of his predecessor Keift,\r\nagainst Melyn and Kuyter, the leaders of the popular party. In this,\r\nthe Breeden Raedt confirms our official accounts. The two patriots\r\nwere tried, convicted, and sentenced to be fined, and transported to\r\nHolland. They were sent as prisoners on board the ship Princess, in\r\nwhich the late director Kieft, and Dominie Everardus Bogardus, the\r\nfirst clergyman in New Netherland also embarked. The ship struck on\r\nthe English coast, \"where this ungodly Kieft seeing death before his\r\neyes, sighing very deeply, dubiously addressed both these (Kuyter and\r\nMelyn): 'Friends, I have done you wrong, can you forgive me?' The ship\r\nbeing broken into eight fragments, drove the whole night in the water.\r\nBy daybreak, the greater part (of passengers) were drowned. Cornelius\r\nMelyn lost his son. Dominie Bogardus, Kieft, Captain John De Vries,\r\nand a great number of people were drowned. There was swallowed up a\r\ngreat treasure with Kieft, for the ship was returning with more than\r\nfour hundred thousand guilders. Joachim Petersen Kuyter remained alone\r\non one of the fragments of the ship, upon which there was a piece of\r\ncannon sticking out of a port, with which he was saved at daylight. He\r\nhad taken it for a man and had spoken to it, but receiving no answer\r\nthought he was dead. In the end, he was thrown on shore with it, to\r\nthe great astonishment of the English, who came down to the strand by\r\nthousands, and who set up the piece of cannon as a lasting memorial.\r\nMelyn floating on his back in the sea, fell in with others who were\r\nclinging to a part of the wreck, and was driven on a sand bank, which\r\nbecame dry with the ebb tide.\" From this place they made their escape\r\nto the shore. Kuyter and Melyn, after saving their lives, became most\r\nsolicitous to secure their papers, which were to serve for their\r\ndefence in Holland against the sentences which had been pronounced on\r\nthem in New Netherland. After three days' labor, they fished up a box\r\ncontaining these valued papers. With these they proceeded to Amsterdam,\r\nand laid their case before the States General, which granted them an\r\nappeal, and meanwhile suspended Stuyvesant's sentence.\r\n\r\nAfter describing the escape of the \"patriots,\" Kuyter and Melyn, and\r\ntheir safe arrival in Holland with their papers, the Breeden Raedt\r\ncontinues its review of the Provincial administration, and gives some\r\nparticulars respecting the chief officers and public affairs in New\r\nNetherland, to be found no where else. The narrative is brought down to\r\nAugust, 1649, at which time Melyn, who had returned to New Netherland,\r\nseems to have embarked a second time for Holland, to bring his case\r\nagain before the States General. He appears to have sailed in the\r\nsame vessel which conveyed Van der Donck, Couwenhoven, and Bont, the\r\ndelegates who had been commissioned to carry over the \"Vertoogh,\" or\r\nremonstrance of the commonalty of New Netherland, against Stuyvesant's\r\narbitrary government. The Breeden Raedt appears to have been printed\r\nsoon after Melyn's return to the Fatherland. As it contains very severe\r\nreflections upon official persons in the Province, and as it was an\r\nanonymous tract, it was perhaps judged prudent to publish it with the\r\nimprint of Antwerp. I think, however, that it was actually printed in\r\nHolland. The Breeden Raedt was one of the earliest, if not the very\r\nearliest separate pamphlet respecting New Netherland. It was followed\r\nin 1650, by the Vertoogh; in 1651, by Hartger's description; and in\r\n1655, by Van der Donck's larger work, and by De Vries's Journal printed\r\nat Alckmaer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN AUTUMN BALLAD.\r\n\r\n\r\n            WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n                          BY W.

But this is less a consequence of\r\nthe subject than of the authorship. Any thing from the hand of Carlyle\r\nis sure of a large audience, but he has hitherto done nothing in which\r\nhis personality was likely to be so much involved as in this life of\r\nhis friend \"ARCHÆUS.\" We copy from the London _Spectator_ the following\r\nreviewal of it:\r\n\r\n    \"The domain of political economy is not unlimited; the laws of\r\n    supply and demand are not the only or the strongest forces at\r\n    work in nature. Here is a man whom the world would have been\r\n    well content to leave quiet in his early grave by the sea-shore\r\n    in the sweetest of English islands; to leave him there to the\r\n    soft melodies of the warm wind and the gentle rain, and the\r\n    pious visits now and then of those who knew and loved him\r\n    when his eye was bright and his voice eloquent with sparkling\r\n    thoughts and warm affections. He had done nothing that the\r\n    public cared for; had left no traces on the sands of Time that\r\n    the next tide would not have effaced. But he lived amongst men\r\n    who write books, amongst some of the very best of such; and two\r\n    of the foremost of them loved him so well, that they could not\r\n    let his memory die,--thought that the positive actual results\r\n    of his life made known to the public were but faint indications\r\n    of the power that lay in him though sorely foiled and baffled,\r\n    and that he in his individual spiritual progress typified\r\n    better than most the struggle that the age is passing through,\r\n    its processes, and its results. But the two men, though united\r\n    in affection for Sterling, were so different in other respects,\r\n    that the memorial raised by the one could scarcely fail to be\r\n    unsatisfactory to the other. Archdeacon Hare, the author of\r\n    the earlier biography, is a man of encyclopoedic knowledge,--a\r\n    profound classical scholar, the most learned and philosophical\r\n    of modern English theologians, at once accurate and wide in his\r\n    acquaintance with European history and literature. And this\r\n    large survey of the forms under which the men of the past have\r\n    thought and acted, has not led in him to an indifference to all\r\n    forms, but rather to a keener sense of the organic vitality\r\n    of forms, especially of national institutions, whether civil\r\n    or ecclesiastical polities, states or churches. Moreover,\r\n    apart from this general characteristic, which would lead to an\r\n    intellectual and practical reverence for the institutions of\r\n    his own land, and a hesitating caution in the introduction of\r\n    constitutional changes, Mr. Hare is an English churchman of no\r\n    ordinary cast. He has passed from the region of traditional\r\n    belief, has skirted the bogs and quicksands of doubt and\r\n    disbelief, and has found firm footing where alone it seems\r\n    possible, in a revelation whose letter is colored by the\r\n    human media through which it has passed, and in a faith whose\r\n    highest mysteries are not only harmonious with but necessary\r\n    complements to the truths of reason. The English Church is to\r\n    him the purest embodiment of his religious idea, as the English\r\n    constitution was to him, in common with Niebuhr, Coleridge,\r\n    and other great thinkers, of the idea of a state. Such a man\r\n    could not write a life like Sterling's without feeling that his\r\n    relation to Christianity and the Church was the great fact for\r\n    him as for all of us; and that the change in him, from hearty\r\n    acceptance of Christian doctrine and church organization to\r\n    a rejection of the former and something very like contempt\r\n    for the latter, needed explanation. That explanation he has\r\n    sought in the overthrow of the balance of Sterling's life\r\n    through repeated attacks of illness, which shut him out from\r\n    practical duties, and threw him entirely upon speculation,\r\n    thereby disproportionately developing the negative side of\r\n    him, already too strong from early defects of education: and\r\n    few persons will, we should think, be found to deny Mr. Hare's\r\n    general position, that the pursuit of speculative philosophy\r\n    as the business of life has this tendency; Mr. Carlyle, we\r\n    should have supposed least of all men. But a special cause\r\n    interferes with Mr. Carlyle's recognition of the principle as\r\n    applicable to Sterling. Christianity, as understood commonly\r\n    perhaps everywhere, except, it may be, at Weimar and Chelsea,\r\n    and church formulas certainly as understood everywhere, he\r\n    is in the habit of classing under a category which in his\r\n    hands has become an extensive one--that of _shams_. He calls\r\n    them by various forcible but ugly names,--as \"old clothes,\"\r\n    \"spectral inanities,\" \"gibbering phantoms,\" or, with plainer\r\n    meaning, \"huge unveracities and unrealities.\" That Sterling at\r\n    any time of his life accepted these for \"eternal verities\" he\r\n    cannot consider a step from the \"no\" to the \"yes,\" nor their\r\n    repudiation as a step backwards from the \"yes\" to the \"no.\" Let\r\n    him speak for himself. He is commenting on Sterling's entry\r\n    into orders as Mr. Hare's curate at Hurstmonceaux:\r\n\r\n    \"Concerning this attempt of Sterling's to find sanctuary in\r\n    the old Church, and desperately grasp the hem of her garment\r\n    in such manner, there will at present be many opinions; and\r\n    mine must be recorded here in flat reproval of it, in mere\r\n    pitying condemnation of it, as a rash, false, unwise and\r\n    unpermitted step. Nay, among the evil lessons of his time to\r\n    poor Sterling, I cannot but account this the worst; properly\r\n    indeed, as we may say, the apotheosis, the solemn apology and\r\n    consecration, of all the evil lessons that were in it to him.\r\n    Alas! if we did remember the divine and awful nature of God's\r\n    Truth, and had not so forgotten it as poor doomed creatures\r\n    never did before,--should we, durst we in our most audacious\r\n    moments, think of wedding it to the world's untruth, which is\r\n    also, like all untruths, the devil's? Only in the world's last\r\n    lethargy can such things be done, and accounted safe and pious!\r\n    Fools! 'Do you think the living God is a buzzard idol,' sternly\r\n    asks Milton, 'that you dare address Him in this manner?' Such\r\n    darkness, thick sluggish clouds of cowardice and oblivious\r\n    baseness, have accumulated on us; thickening as if towards the\r\n    eternal sleep! It is not now known, what never needed proof\r\n    or statement before, that Religion is not a doubt; that it is\r\n    a certainty,--or else a mockery and horror. That none or all\r\n    of the many things we are in doubt about, and need to have\r\n    demonstrated and rendered probable, can by any alchemy be made\r\n    a 'Religion' for us; but are and must continue a baleful, quiet\r\n    or unquiet, Hypocrisy for us; and bring--_salvation_, do we\r\n    fancy? I think it is another thing they will bring; and are, on\r\n    all hands, visibly bringing, this good while!----\"\r\n\r\nHerein consists the whole difference between Hare and Carlyle in their\r\nviews of Sterling's career. They looked at it from such opposite points\r\nthat what is the zenith to one is the nadir to the other. What Sterling\r\nhimself thought of it, was strikingly expressed to his brother, Captain\r\nAnthony Sterling, by a comparison, of his case \"to that of a young lady\r\nwho has tragically lost her lover, and is willing to be half-hoodwinked\r\ninto a convent, or in any noble or quasi-noble way to escape from\r\na world which has become intolerable.\" The truth seems to be, that\r\nSterling went into orders under the combined influence of remorse for\r\nthe share he had inadvertently had in causing the disastrous fate of a\r\nnear relative (Mr. Boyd, who was shot with Torrijos in Spain), and of\r\na gradual disenchantment from trust in mere political schemes for the\r\nregeneration of mankind,--a disease more common to the genial young\r\nmen of his time than of ours. That while in the exercise of his duties\r\nas a parish-priest he was energetic, useful, and happy, the evidence\r\nin Mr. Hare's book is fully sufficient to show. It is impossible to\r\nsay whether his scepticism would have come upon him had he continued\r\nin that active career; but it is certainly a gratuitous supposition of\r\nMr. Carlyle that the ill-health which put an end to it was only the\r\noutward and ostensible cause of its termination, and does not appear\r\nto be borne out by a single letter or expression of Sterling's own.\r\nIndeed, for years after he left Hurstmonceaux, he seemed to continue as\r\nfirm in his attachment to Christianity as when he was there; though,\r\non the other hand, it may well be doubted whether a man of Sterling's\r\nintellect, who would surrender his beliefs to Strauss's _Leben Jesu_,\r\nis likely in the present day to keep them under any conceivable\r\ncircumstances. We think that Mr. Hare on the one hand has attributed\r\ntoo exclusive an influence to Sterling's forced inactivity, and Mr.\r\nCarlyle has certainly not taken it sufficiently into account as a\r\ndetermining cause of his skepticism.\r\n\r\n[3] The Life of John Sterling. By Thomas Carlyle. Published by Chapman\r\n& Hall. [Boston, republished by Ticknor, Reed & Fields, 1851.]\r\n\r\nBut whatever subject Mr. Carlyle takes up, and whether he be right or\r\nwrong in his opinions, he is sure to write an interesting book. He is\r\nnever wearisome, and whether his tale have been twice told or not, he\r\nclothes it by his original treatment with an attractive charm that few\r\nwriters can lend even to an entirely new subject. The maxim of the\r\nauthor of _Modern Antiquity_, that\r\n\r\n    \"True genius is the ray that flings\r\n    A novel light o'er common things,\"\r\n\r\nhas seldom been better illustrated than by this life of Sterling. The\r\nfacts are most of them neither new nor of a nature in themselves to\r\nexcite any very strong interest, but the details of the life are told\r\nwith such simplicity, and yet with such constant reference to the grand\r\neducational process which they collectively make up, that one seems\r\nlistening to a narrative by Sterling's guardian angel, loving enough to\r\nsympathize in the smallest minutiæ, and wise enough to see in each of\r\nthem the greatness of the crowning result. Nor is this impression in\r\nthe least impaired by the insignificance of the sum total of Sterling's\r\nactual achievements. For had they been tenfold greater than they were,\r\nthey would have been as nothing in the presence of that which Mr.\r\nCarlyle looks to as the soul's great achievement--heroic nobleness of\r\nstruggle and a calm abiding of the issue. After noticing the purity of\r\nSterling's character, and his conformity to \"the so-called moralities,\"\r\nhis biographer goes on to say:\r\n\r\n    \"In clear and perfect fidelity to Truth wherever found, in\r\n    childlike and soldierlike, pious and valiant loyalty to the\r\n    Highest, and what of good and evil that might send him,--he\r\n    excelled among good men. The joys and the sorrows of his lot he\r\n    took with true simplicity and acquiescence. Like a true son,\r\n    not like a miserable mutinous rebel, he comported himself in\r\n    this Universe. Extremity of distress--and surely his fervid\r\n    temper had enough of contradiction in this world,--could not\r\n    tempt him into impatience at any time. By no chance did you\r\n    ever hear from him a whisper of those mean repinings, miserable\r\n    arraignings and questionings of the Eternal Power, such as\r\n    weak souls even well disposed will sometimes give way to in\r\n    the pressure of their despair; to the like of this he never\r\n    yielded, or showed the least tendency to yield;--which surely\r\n    was well on his part. For the Eternal Power, I still remark,\r\n    will not answer the like of this, but silently and terribly\r\n    accounts it impious, blasphemous, and damnable, and now as\r\n    heretofore will visit it as such. Not a rebel but a son, I\r\n    said; willing to suffer when Heaven said, Thou shalt;--and\r\n    withal, what is perhaps rarer in such a combination, willing to\r\n    rejoice also, and right cheerily taking the good that was sent,\r\n    whensoever or in whatever form it came.\r\n\r\n    \"A pious soul we may justly call him; devoutly submissive to\r\n    the will of the Supreme in all things: the highest and sole\r\n    essential form which Religion can assume in man, and without\r\n    which all forms of religion are a mockery and a delusion in\r\n    man.\"\r\n\r\nEvery one not personally acquainted with Sterling will feel that\r\nthe great interest of the book is in the light thrown by it on Mr.\r\nCarlyle's own belief. For good or evil, Mr. Carlyle is a power in the\r\ncountry; and those who watch eagerly the signs of the times have their\r\neyes fixed upon him. What he would have us leave is plain enough,\r\nand that too with all haste, as a sinking ship that will else carry\r\nus--state, church, and sacred property--down along with it. But whither\r\nwould he have us fly? Is there firm land, be it ever so distant? or is\r\nthe wild waste of waters, seething, warring round as far as eye can\r\nreach, our only hope? the pilot-stars, shining fitfully through the\r\nparting of the storm-clouds, our only guidance? There are hearts on\r\nthis land almost broken, whose old traditional beliefs, serving them\r\nat least as moral supports, Mr. Carlyle and teachers like him have\r\nundermined. Some betake themselves to literature, as Sterling did; some\r\nfill up the void with the excitement of politics; others feebly bemoan\r\ntheir irreparable loss, and wear an outward seeming of universal irony\r\nand sarcasm. Mr. Carlyle has no right, no man has any right, to weaken\r\nor destroy a faith which he cannot or will not replace with a loftier.\r\nWe have no hesitation in saying, that the language which Mr. Carlyle\r\nis in the habit of employing towards the religion of England and of\r\nEurope is unjustifiable. He ought to have said nothing, or he ought to\r\nhave said more. Scraps of verse from Goethe, and declamations, however\r\nbrilliantly they may be phrased, are but a poor compensation for the\r\nslightest obscuring of \"the hope of immortality brought to light by\r\nthe gospel,\" and by it conveyed to the hut of the poorest man, to\r\nawaken, his crushed intelligence and lighten the load of his misery.\r\nMr. Carlyle slights, after his contemptuous fashion, the poetry of his\r\ncontemporaries: one of them has uttered in song some practical wisdom\r\nwhich he would do well to heed:\r\n\r\n    \"O thou that after toil and storm\r\n      May'st seem to have reached a purer air,\r\n      Whose faith has centre everywhere,\r\n    Nor cares to fix itself to form,\r\n\r\n    \"Leave thou thy sister, when she prays,\r\n      Her early heaven, her happy views;\r\n      Nor thou with shadowed hint confuse\r\n    A life that leads melodious days.\r\n\r\n    \"Her faith through form is pure as thine,\r\n      Her hands are quicker unto good.\r\n      Oh, sacred be the flesh and blood\r\n    To which she links a truth divine!\r\n\r\n    \"See thou, that countest reason ripe\r\n      In holding by the law within,\r\n      Thou fail not in a world of sin,\r\n    And even for want of such a type.\"\r\n\r\nThis life of Sterling will be useful to the class whose beliefs\r\nhave given way before Mr. Carlyle's destroying energies; because it\r\nfurnishes hints, not to be mistaken though not obtrusive, as to the\r\nextent to which they must be prepared to go if they would really be\r\nhis disciples. If the path has in its very dangers an attraction for\r\nsome, while others are shudderingly repelled, in either case the result\r\nis desirable, as it is the absence of certainty which causes the pain\r\nand paralyzes the power of action. At any rate, the doctrines of this\r\nteacher must be so much more intelligible to the mass when applied,\r\nas they are here, in commentary upon a life all whose details are\r\nfamiliar, because it is the life of a contemporary and a countryman,\r\nthat all who read must inevitably be impressed with that great lesson\r\nof the philosophic poet--\r\n\r\n    \"The intellectual power through words and things\r\n    Goes sounding on, _a dim and perilous way_.\"\r\n\r\nThough John Sterling is of course the principal figure in the\r\ncomposition, and Mr. Carlyle's treatment the great attraction of the\r\nbook, yet the figures in the background will be those to make most\r\nimpression on the general reader. Coleridge stands there in striking\r\nbut caricatured likeness; and even his most devoted admirers will not\r\nbe sorry to see a portrait of their master by such a hand: and all\r\nwill curiously observe the contrast between the sarcastic bitterness\r\nwhich colors the drawing of the philosophic Christian, and the kindly\r\nallowance through which the character of John Sterling's father, the\r\nfamous \"Thunderer\" of the _Times_, is delineated. We half suspect that\r\nColeridge would have appeared to Mr. Carlyle a much greater man, if he\r\nhad allowed him to declaim--\"Harpocrates-Stentor,\" as Sterling calls\r\nhim--with trumpet voice and for time unlimited on the divine virtues of\r\nSilence. There are besides, as in all Mr. Carlyle's works, passages of\r\nwise thought expressed in most felicitous language: of which not the\r\nleast important is this advice given to Sterling in reference to his\r\npoetic aspirations:\r\n\r\n    \"You can speak with supreme excellence; sing with considerable\r\n    excellence you never can. And the Age itself, does it not,\r\n    beyond most ages, demand and require clear speech; an Age\r\n    incapable of being sung to, in any but a trivial manner, till\r\n    these convulsive agonies and wild revolutionary overturnings\r\n    readjust themselves? Intelligible word of command, not musical\r\n    psalmody and fiddling, is possible in this fell storm of\r\n    battle. Beyond all ages, our Age admonishes whatsoever thinking\r\n    or writing man it has: Oh speak to me, some wise intelligible\r\n    speech; your wise meaning, in the shortest and clearest way;\r\n    behold, I am dying for want of wise meaning, and insight into\r\n    the devouring fact: speak, if you have any wisdom! As to song\r\n    so-called, and your fiddling talent,--even if you have one,\r\n    much more if you have none,--we will talk of that a couple of\r\n    centuries hence, when things are calmer again. Homer shall be\r\n    thrice welcome; but only when Troy is _taken_: alas, while the\r\n    siege lasts, and battle's fury rages every where, what can I do\r\n    with the Homer? I want Achilleus and Odysseus, and am enraged\r\n    to see them trying to be Homers!--\"\r\n\r\nThese bricks from Babylon convey but scanty intimation of the varied\r\ninterest of the book. However the readers of it may differ from its\r\nopinions, they cannot but find, even in Mr. Carlyle's misjudgments and\r\nprejudices, ample matter for serious reflection: for if he misjudges,\r\nit is generally because he is looking too intently at a single truth,\r\nor a single side of a truth; and such misjudgments are more suggestive\r\nthan the completest propositions of a less earnest, keen-sighted, and\r\nimpassioned thinker. He is indeed more a prophet than a logician or\r\na man of science. And one lesson we may all learn from this, as from\r\neverything he writes,--and it is a lesson that interferes with no\r\ncreed,--that honesty of purpose, and resoluteness to do and to say the\r\nthing we believe to be the true thing, will give heart to a man's life,\r\nwhen all ordinary motives to action and all ordinary supports of energy\r\nhave failed like a rotten reed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONGS OF THE CASCADE.\r\n\r\n\r\n            WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n                           BY A.

N. Reynolds, ten or fifteen years ago, in a paper\r\nfor the _Knickerbocker_, entitled _Mocha Dick_. We received a copy\r\nwhen it was too late to review it ourselves for this number of the\r\n_International_, and therefore make use of a notice of it which we find\r\nin the London _Spectator_:\r\n\r\n\"This sea novel is a singular medley of naval observation, magazine\r\narticle writing, satiric reflection upon the conventionalisms of\r\ncivilized life, and rhapsody run mad. So far as the nautical parts are\r\nappropriate and unmixed, the portraiture is truthful and interesting.\r\nSome of the satire, especially in the early parts, is biting and\r\nreckless. The chapter-spinning is various in character; now powerful\r\nfrom the vigorous and fertile fancy of the author, now little more than\r\nempty though sounding phrases. The rhapsody belongs to wordmongering\r\nwhere ideas are the staple; where it takes the shape of narrative or\r\ndramatic fiction, it is phantasmal--an attempted description of what\r\nis impossible in nature and without probability in art; it repels the\r\nreader instead of attracting him.\r\n\r\n[4] The Whale. By Herman Melville, Author of \"Typee,\" \"Omoo,\"\r\n\"Redburn,\" \"Mardi,\" \"White Jacket.\" In three volumes. Published by\r\nBentley.\r\n\r\n[Moby Dick, or the Whale: By Herman Melville: 1 vol. 12mo. New-York,\r\nHarper & Brothers.]\r\n\r\n\"The elements of the story are a South Sea whaling voyage, narrated\r\nby Ishmael, one of the crew of the ship Pequod, from Nantucket. Its\r\n'probable' portions consist of the usual sea matter in that branch of\r\nthe industrial marine; embracing the preparations for departure, the\r\nvoyage, the chase and capture of whale, with the economy of cutting\r\nup, &c., and the peculiar discipline of the service. This matter is\r\nexpanded by a variety of digressions on the nature and characteristics\r\nof the sperm whale, the history of the fishery, and similar things,\r\nin which a little knowledge is made the excuse for a vast many words.\r\nThe voyage is introduced by several chapters in which life in American\r\nseaports is rather broadly depicted.\r\n\r\n\"The 'marvellous' injures the book by disjointing the narrative, as\r\nwell as by its inherent want of interest, at least as managed by Mr.\r\nMelville. In the superstition of some whalers, (grounded upon the\r\nmalicious foresight which occasionally characterizes the attacks of\r\nthe sperm fish upon the boats sent to capture it,) there is a _white_\r\nwhale which possesses supernatural power. To capture or even to hurt\r\nit is beyond the art of man; the skill of the whaler is useless; the\r\nharpoon does not wound it; it exhibits a contemptuous strategy in its\r\nattacks upon the boats of its pursuers; and happy is the vessel were\r\nonly loss of limb, or of a single life, attends its chase. Ahab, the\r\nmaster of the Pequod--a mariner of long experience, stern resolve, and\r\nindomitable courage, the high hero of romance, in short, transferred\r\nto a whale-ship--has lost his leg in a contest with the white whale.\r\nInstead of daunting Ahab, the loss exasperates him; and by long\r\nbrooding over it his reason becomes shaken. In this condition, he\r\nundertakes the voyage; making the chase of his fishy antagonist the\r\nsole abject of his thoughts, and, so far as he can without exciting\r\novert insubordination among his officers, the object of his proceedings.\r\n\r\n\"Such a groundwork is hardly natural enough for a regular-built novel,\r\nthough it might form a tale, if properly managed. But Mr. Melville's\r\nmysteries provoke wonder at the author rather than terror at the\r\ncreation; the soliloquies and dialogues of Ahab, in which the author\r\nattempts delineating the wild imaginings of monomania, and exhibiting\r\nsome profoundly speculative views of things in general, induce\r\nweariness or skipping; while the whole scheme mars, as we have said,\r\nthe nautical continuity of story--greatly assisted by various chapters\r\nof a bookmaking kind.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the earliest chapters are the best although they contain\r\nlittle adventure. Their topics are fresher to English readers than\r\nthe whale-chase, and they have more direct satire. One of the leading\r\npersonages in the voyage is Queequeg, a South Sea Islander, that\r\nIshmael falls in with at New-Bedford, and with whom he forms a bosom\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\n\"Queequeg was a native of Kokovoko, an island far away to the West and\r\nSouth. It is not down in any map; true places never are.\r\n\r\n\"While yet a new-hatched savage, running wild about his native\r\nwoodlands in a grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he\r\nwere a green sapling,--even then, in Queequeg's ambitious soul lurked\r\na strong desire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen\r\nwhaler or two. His father was a high chief, a king; his uncle a high\r\npriest; and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of\r\nunconquerable warriors. There was excellent blood in his veins--royal\r\nstuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he\r\nnourished in his untutored youth.\r\n\r\n\"A Sag Harbour ship visited his father's bay; and Queequeg sought a\r\npassage to Christian lands. But the ship having her full complement of\r\nseamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his father's influence\r\ncould prevail. But Queequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled\r\noff to a distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when\r\nshe quitted the island. On one side was a coral reef; on the other\r\na low tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets, that grew out\r\ninto the water. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets,\r\nwith its prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand;\r\nand when the ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out--gained\r\nher side--with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his\r\ncanoe--climbed up the chains--and throwing himself at full length upon\r\nthe deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and swore not to let it go though\r\nhacked in pieces.\r\n\r\n\"In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard--suspended\r\na cutlass over his naked wrists: Queequeg was the son of a king,\r\nand Queequeg budged not. Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and\r\nhis wild desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented,\r\nand told him he might make himself at home. But this fine young\r\nsavage--this sea Prince of Whales--never saw the captain's cabin. They\r\nput him down among the sailors, and made a whaleman of him. But, like\r\nthe Czar Peter content to toil in the ship-yards of foreign cities,\r\nQueequeg disdained no seeming ignominy, if thereby he might haply gain\r\nthe power of enlightening his untutored countrymen. For at bottom--so\r\nhe told me--he was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the\r\nChristians the arts whereby to make his people still happier than they\r\nwere, and more than that, still better than they were. But, alas! the\r\npractices of whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be\r\nboth miserable and wicked, infinitely more so than all his father's\r\nheathens. Arrived at last in old Sag Harbour, and seeing what the\r\nsailors did there, and then going on to Nantucket, and seeing how they\r\nspent their wages in that place also, poor Queequeg gave it up for\r\nlost. Thought he, it's a wicked world in all meridians: I'll die a\r\nPagan.\r\n\r\n\"The strongest point of the book is its 'characters.' Ahab, indeed,\r\nis a melodramatic exaggeration, and Ishmael is little more than a\r\nmouthpiece; but the harpooners, the mates, and several of the seamen,\r\nare truthful portraitures of the sailor as modified by the whaling\r\nservice. The persons ashore are equally good, though they are soon lost\r\nsight of. The two Quaker owners are the author's means for a hit at the\r\nreligious hypocrisies. Captain Bildad, an old sea-dog, has got rid of\r\nevery thing pertaining to the meeting-house save an occasional 'thou'\r\nand 'thee.' Captain Peleg, in American phrase, 'professes religion.'\r\nThe following extract exhibits the two men when Ishmael is shipped:\r\n\r\n    \"I began to think that it was high time to settle with myself\r\n    at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage. I\r\n    was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no\r\n    wages, but all hands, including the captain, received certain\r\n    shares of the profits, called _lays_; and that these lays\r\n    were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to\r\n    the respective duties of the ship's company. I was also aware\r\n    that, being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be\r\n    very large: but, considering that I was used to the sea, could\r\n    steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt\r\n    that, from all I had heard, I should be offered at least the\r\n    two hundred and seventy-fifth lay--that is, the two hundred and\r\n    seventy-fifth part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage,\r\n    whatever that might eventually amount to. And though the two\r\n    hundred and seventy-fifth lay was what they called a rather\r\n    _long lay_, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a\r\n    lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would\r\n    wear out on it, not to speak of my three years' beef and\r\n    board, for which I would not have to pay one stiver.\r\n\r\n    \"It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate\r\n    a princely fortune: and so it was, a very poor way indeed.\r\n    But I am one of those that never take on about princely\r\n    fortunes, and am quite content if the world is ready to board\r\n    and lodge me while I am putting up at this grim sign of the\r\n    Thunder-cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the two hundred\r\n    and seventy-fifth lay would be about the fair thing, but would\r\n    not have been surprised had I been offered the two hundredth,\r\n    considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.\r\n\r\n    \"But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful\r\n    about receiving a generous share of the profits, was this:\r\n    ashore, I had heard something of both Captain Peleg and his\r\n    unaccountable old crony Bildad; how that they, being the\r\n    principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the other and\r\n    more in considerable and scattered owners left nearly the whole\r\n    management of the ship's affairs to these two. And I did not\r\n    know but that the stingy old Bildad might have a deal to say\r\n    about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board\r\n    the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his\r\n    Bible, as if at his own fireside. Now, while Peleg was vainly\r\n    trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my\r\n    no small surprise, considering that he was such an interested\r\n    party in these proceedings--Bildad never heeded us, but went\r\n    on mumbling to himself out of his book, '_Lay_ not up for\r\n    yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth--'\r\n\r\n    \"'Well, Captain Bildad,' interrupted Peleg, 'what d'ye\r\n    say--what lay shall we give this young man?'\r\n\r\n    \"'Thou knowest best,' was the sepulchral reply; 'the seven\r\n    hundred and seventy-seventh wouldn't be too much--would\r\n    it--'where moth and rust do corrupt, but _lay_--'\r\n\r\n    \"Lay indeed, thought I, and such a lay!--the seven hundred and\r\n    seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I,\r\n    for one, shall not _lay_ up many _lays_ here below, where moth\r\n    and rust do corrupt. It was an exceedingly _long lay_ that,\r\n    indeed; and though from the magnitude of the figure it might\r\n    at first deceive a landsman, yet the slightest consideration\r\n    will show that, though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a\r\n    pretty large number, yet when you come to make a _teenth_\r\n    of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and\r\n    seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than\r\n    seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons. And so I\r\n    thought at the time.\r\n\r\n    \"'Why, b---- t your eyes, Bildad!' cried Peleg, 'thou dost not\r\n    want to swindle this young man! he must have more than that?'\r\n\r\n    \"'Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,' again said Bildad,\r\n    without lifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling--'for where\r\n    your treasure is, there will your heart be also.'\r\n\r\n    \"'I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,' said\r\n    Peleg; 'do ye hear that, Bildad? The three hundredth lay, I\r\n    say.'\r\n\r\n    \"Bildad laid down his book, and, turning solemnly towards\r\n    him, said, 'Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but\r\n    thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of\r\n    this ship--widows and orphans, many of them; and that, if we\r\n    too abundantly reward the labors of this young man, we may be\r\n    taking the bread from those widows and those orphans. The seven\r\n    hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.'\r\n\r\n    \"'Thou Bildad!' roared Peleg, starting up, and clattering about\r\n    the cabin, 'B---- t ye, Captain Bildad; if I had followed thy\r\n    advice in these matters, I would afore now had a conscience to\r\n    lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest\r\n    ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn.'\r\n\r\n    \"'Captain Peleg,' said Bildad steadily, 'thy conscience may be\r\n    drawing ten inches of water or ten fathoms--I can't tell; but\r\n    as thou art still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly\r\n    fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one, and will in the\r\n    end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg,'\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a canon with some critics that nothing should be introduced into\r\na novel which it is physically impossible for the writer to have known:\r\nthus, he must not describe the conversation of miners in a pit if they\r\n_all_ perish. Mr. Melville hardly steers clear of this rule, and he\r\ncontinually violates another, by beginning in the autobiographical form\r\nand changing _ad libitum_ into the narrative. His catastrophe overrides\r\nall rule: not only is Ahab, with his boat's-crew, destroyed in his last\r\ndesperate attack upon the white whale, but the Pequod herself sinks\r\nwith all on board into the depths of the illimitable ocean. Such is the\r\ngo-ahead method.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STORY WITHOUT A NAME[5]\r\n\r\n\r\n            WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE\r\n\r\n                        BY G. P. R. JAMES, ESQ.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nSir Philip Hastings, I have said, was reading a Greek book when Mr.\r\nShort entered the library. His face was grave, and very stern; but all\r\ntraces of the terrible agitation with which he had quited the side of\r\nhis wife's death-bed, were now gone from his face. He hardly looked\r\nup when the surgeon entered. He seemed not only reading, but absorbed\r\nby what he read. Mr. Short thought the paroxysm of grief was passed,\r\nand that the mind of Sir Philip Hastings, settling down into a calm\r\nmelancholy, was seeking its habitual relief in books. He knew, as every\r\nmedical man must know, the various whimsical resources to which the\r\nheart of man flies, as if for refuge, in moments of great affliction.\r\nThe trifles with which some will occupy themselves--the intense\r\nabstraction for which others will labor--the imaginations, the visions,\r\nthe fancies to which others again will apply, not for consolation, not\r\nfor comfort; but for escape from the one dark predominant idea. He said\r\na few words to Sir Philip then, of a kindly but somewhat commonplace\r\ncharacter, and the baronet looked up, gazing at him across the\r\ncandles which stood upon the library table. Had Mr. Short's attention\r\nbeen particularly called to Sir Philip's countenance, he would have\r\nperceived at once, that the pupils of the eyes were strangely and\r\nunnaturally contracted, and that from time to time a certain nervous\r\ntwitching of the muscles curled the lip, and indented the cheek. But he\r\ndid not remark these facts: he merely saw that Sir Philip was reading:\r\nthat he had recovered his calmness; and he judged that that which might\r\nbe strange in other men, might not be strange in him. In regard to what\r\nhe believed the great cause of Sir Philip's grief, his wife's death,\r\nhe thought it better to say nothing; but he naturally concluded that\r\na father would be anxious to hear of a daughter's health under such\r\ncircumstances, and therefore he told him that Emily was better and more\r\ncomposed.\r\n\r\n[5] Concluded from page 499.\r\n\r\nEntered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1850, by G. P. R.\r\nJames, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States\r\nfor the Southern District of New-York.\r\n\r\nSir Philip made a slight, but impatient motion of the hand, but Mr.\r\nShort went on to say, \"As she was so severely and terribly affected,\r\nSir Philip, I have given Mistress Emily a composing draught, which has\r\nalready had the intended effect of throwing her into profound slumber.\r\nIt will insure her, I think, at least six, if not seven hours of calm\r\nrepose, and I trust she will rise better able to bear her grief than\r\nshe would be now, were she conscious of it.\"\r\n\r\nSir Philip muttered something between his teeth which the surgeon\r\ndid not hear, and Mr. Short proceeded, saying, \"Will you permit me\r\nto suggest, Sir Philip, that it would be better for you too, my dear\r\nsir, to take something which would counteract the depressing effect of\r\nsorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you, sir, I thank you,\" replied Sir Philip, laying his\r\nhand upon the book; \"I have no need. The mind under suffering seeks\r\nmedicines for the mind. The body is not affected. It is well--too well.\r\nHere is my doctor;\" and he raised his hand and let it fall upon the\r\nbook again.\r\n\r\n\"Well then, I will leave you for to-night, Sir Philip,\" said the\r\nsurgeon; \"to-morrow I must intrude upon you on business of great\r\nimportance. I will now take my leave.\"\r\n\r\nSir Philip rose ceremoniously from his chair and bowed his head; gazing\r\nupon the surgeon as he left the room and shut the door, with a keen,\r\ncunning, watchful look from under his overhanging eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" he said, when the surgeon had left the room, \"he thought to\r\ncatch me--to find out what I intended to do--slumber!--calm, tranquil\r\nrepose--so near a murdered mother! God of heaven!\" and he bent down his\r\nhead till his forehead touched the pages of the book, and remained with\r\nhis face thus concealed for several minutes.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remarked that not one person, with a single exception, to\r\nwhom the circumstances of Lady Hastings' death were known, even dreamed\r\nof suspecting Emily. They all knew her, comprehended her character,\r\nloved her, had faith in her, except her own unhappy father. But with\r\nhim, if the death of his unhappy wife were terrible, his suspicions\r\nof his daughter were a thousand fold more so. To his distorted vision\r\na multitude of circumstances brought proof all powerful. \"She has\r\ntried to destroy her father,\" he thought, \"and she has not scrupled\r\nto destroy her mother. In the one case there seemed no object. In the\r\nother there was the great object of revenge, with others perhaps more\r\nmean, but not less potent. Try her cause what way I will, the same\r\nresult appears. The mother opposes the daughter's marriage to the man\r\nshe loves--threatens to frustrate the dearest wish of her heart--and\r\nnothing but death will satisfy her. This is the end then of all these\r\nreveries--these alternate fits of gloom and levity. The ill balanced\r\nmind has lost its equipoise, and all has given way to passion. But what\r\nmust I do--oh God! what must I do?\"\r\n\r\nHis thoughts are here given, not exactly as they presented themselves;\r\nfor they were more vague, confused, and disjointed; but such was\r\nthe sum and substance of them. He raised his head from the book and\r\nlooked up, and after thinking for a moment or two he said, \"This\r\nJosephus--this Jew--gives numerous instances, if I remember right, of\r\njustice done by fathers upon their children--ay, and by the express\r\ncommand of God. The priest of the Most High was punished for yielding\r\nto human weakness in the case of his sons. The warrior Jephtha spared\r\nnot his best beloved. What does the Roman teach? Not to show pity to\r\nthose the nearest to us by blood, the closest in affection, where\r\njustice demands unwavering execution. It must be so. There is but the\r\nchoice left, to give her over to hands of strangers, to add public\r\nshame, and public punishment to that which justice demands, or to do\r\nthat myself which they must inevitably do. She must die--such a monster\r\nmust not remain upon the earth. She has plotted against her father's\r\nlife--she has colleagued with his fraudulent enemies--she has betrayed\r\nthe heart that fondly trusted her--she has visited secretly the haunts\r\nof a low, vulgar ruffian--she has aided and abetted those who have\r\nplundered her own parents--she has ended by the murder of the mother\r\nwho so fondly loved her. I--I am bound, by every duty to society, to\r\ndeliver it from one, who for my curse, and its bane, I brought into the\r\nworld. She must be put to death; and no hand but mine must do it.\"\r\n\r\nHe gazed gloomily down upon the table for several minutes, and then\r\npaced the room rapidly with agony in every line of his face. He wrung\r\nhis hands hard together. He lifted up his eyes towards heaven, and\r\noften, often, he cried out, \"Oh God! Oh God! Is there no hope?--no\r\ndoubt?--no opening for pause or hesitation?\"\r\n\r\n\"None, none, none,\" he said at length, and sank down into his chair\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nHis eye wandered round the room, as if seeking some object he could not\r\nsee, and then he murmured, \"So beautiful--so young--so engaging--just\r\neighteen summers; and yet such a load of crime!\"\r\n\r\nHe bent his head again, and a few drops of agony fell from his eyes\r\nupon the table. Then clasping his forehead tight with his hand, he\r\nremained for several minutes thoughtful and silent. He seemed to grow\r\ncalmer; but it was a deceitful seeming; and there was a wild, unnatural\r\nlight in his eyes which, notwithstanding all the apparent shrewdness of\r\nhis reasoning--the seeming connection and clearness of his argument,\r\nwould have shown to those expert in such matters, that there was\r\nsomething not right within the brain.\r\n\r\nAt length he said to himself in a whisper, as if he was afraid that\r\nsome one should hear him, \"She sleeps--the man said she sleeps--now is\r\nthe time--I must not hesitate--I must not falter--now is the time!\" and\r\nhe rose and approached the door.\r\n\r\nOnce, he stopped for a moment--once, doubt and irresolution took\r\npossession of him. But then he cast them off, and moved on again.\r\n\r\nWith a slow step, but firm and noiseless tread, he crossed the hall and\r\nmounted the stairs. No one saw him: the servants were scattered: there\r\nwas no one to oppose his progress, or to say, \"Forbear!\"\r\n\r\nHe reached his daughter's room, opened the door quietly, went in, and\r\nclosed it. Then he gazed eagerly around. The curtains were withdrawn:\r\nhis fair, sweet child lay sleeping calmly as an infant. He could see\r\nall around. Father and child were there. There was no one else.\r\n\r\nStill he gazed around, seeking perhaps for something with which to do\r\nthe fatal deed! His eye rested on a packet of papers upon the table. It\r\ncontained those which Marlow had left with poor gentle Emily to justify\r\nher to her father in case of need.\r\n\r\nOh, would he but take them up! Would he but read the words within!\r\n\r\nHe turns away--he steals toward the bed!\r\n\r\nDrop the curtain! I can write no more.\r\n\r\nEmily is gone!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Short, the surgeon, left the presence of Sir Philip Hastings,\r\nhe found the butler seated in an arm-chair in the hall, cogitating\r\nsadly over all the lamentable events of the day. He was an old servant\r\nof the family, and full of that personal interest in every member of it\r\nwhich now, alas, in these times of improvement and utilitarianism (or\r\nas it should be called, selfishness reduced to rule), when it seems to\r\nbe the great object of every one to bring men down to the level of a\r\nmere machine, is no longer, or very rarely, met with. He rose as soon\r\nas the surgeon appeared, and inquired eagerly after his poor master. \"I\r\nam afraid he is touched here, sir,\" he said, laying his finger on his\r\nforehead. \"He has not been at all right ever since he came back from\r\nLondon, and I am sure, when he came down to-night, calling out in such\r\na way about gathering herbs, I thought he had gone clean crazy.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has become quite calm and composed now,\" replied Mr. Short; \"though\r\nof course he is very sad: but as I can do no good by staying with\r\nhim, I must go down to the farm for my horse, and ride away where my\r\npresence is immediately wanted.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have brought your horse up from the farm, sir,\" said the butler.\r\n\"It is in the stable-yard.\"\r\n\r\nThither Mr. Short immediately proceeded, mounted, and rode away. When\r\nhe had gone about five miles, or perhaps a little more, he perceived\r\nthat two horsemen were approaching him rapidly, and he looked sharp\r\ntowards them, thinking they might be Mr. Atkinson and the groom. As\r\nthey came near, the outlines of the figures showed him that such was\r\nnot the case; but the foremost of the two pulled up suddenly as he was\r\npassing, and Marlow's voice exclaimed, \"Is that Mr. Short?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, yes, Mr. Marlow,\" replied the surgeon. \"I am very glad\r\nindeed you have come; for there has been terrible work this day at the\r\nhouse of poor Sir Philip Hastings. Lady Hastings is no more, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard the whole sad history,\" replied Marlow, \"and am riding as\r\nfast as possible to see what can be done for Sir Philip, and my poor\r\nEmily. I only stopped to tell you that Mrs. Hazleton has been taken,\r\nthe vial of medicine found upon her, and that she has boldly confessed\r\nthe fact of having poisoned poor Lady Hastings. You will find her and\r\nAtkinson, the high constable, at the house of Mrs. Warmington.--Good\r\nnight, Mr. Short; good night;\" and Marlow spurred on again.\r\n\r\nThe delay had been very short, but it was fatal.\r\n\r\nWhen Marlow reached the front entrance of the court, he threw his rein\r\nto the groom, and without the ceremony of ringing, entered the house.\r\nThere was a lamp burning in the hall, which was vacant; but Marlow\r\nheard a step upon the great staircase, and looked up. A dark shadowy\r\nfigure was coming staggering down, and as it entered the sphere of\r\nthe light in the hall, Marlow recognized the form, rather than the\r\nfeatures, of Sir Philip Hastings. His face was ashy pale: not a trace\r\nof color was discernible in any part: the very lips were white; and the\r\ngray hair stood ragged and wild upon his head. His haggard and sunken\r\neye fell upon Marlow; but he was passing onward to the library, as if\r\nhe did not know him, tottering and reeling like a drunken man, when\r\nMarlow, very much shocked, stopped him, exclaiming, \"Good God, Sir\r\nPhilip, do you no know me?\"\r\n\r\nThe unhappy man started, turned round and grasped him tightly by the\r\nwrist, saying in a hoarse whisper, and looking over his shoulder\r\ntowards the staircase, \"Do not go there, do not go there--come\r\nhither--you do not know what has happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do, indeed, Sir Philip,\" replied Marlow in a soothing tone, \"I have\r\nheard----\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no, no!\" said Sir Philip Hastings. \"No one knows but I--there\r\nwas no one there--I did it all myself.--Come hither, I say!\" and he\r\ndrew Marlow on towards the library.\r\n\r\n\"He has lost his senses,\" thought Marlow. \"I must try and soothe him\r\nbefore I see my poor Emily. I will try and turn his mind to other\r\nthings;\" and, suffering himself to be led forward, he entered the\r\nlibrary with Sir Philip Hastings, who instantly cast himself into a\r\nchair, and pressed his hands before his eyes.\r\n\r\nMarlow stood and gazed at him for a moment in silent compassion, and\r\nthen he said, \"Take comfort, Sir Philip. Take comfort. I bring you\r\na great store of news; and what I have to tell will require great\r\nbodily and mental exertions from you, to deal with all the painful\r\ncircumstances in which you are placed. I have followed out every thread\r\nof the shameful conspiracy against you--not a turning of the whole\r\nrascally scheme is undiscovered.\"\r\n\r\n\"She had her share in that too,\" said Sir Philip, looking up in his\r\nface, with a wild, uncertain sort of questioning look.\r\n\r\n\"I know it,\" replied Marlow, thinking he spoke of Mrs. Hazleton, \"She\r\nwas the prime mover in it all.\"\r\n\r\nSir Philip wrung his hands tight, one within the other, murmuring \"Oh,\r\nGod; oh, God!\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" continued Marlow, \"she will soon expiate her crimes; for she\r\nhas been taken, and proofs of her guilt found upon her, so strong and\r\nconvincing, that she did not think fit even to conceal the fact, but\r\nconfessed her crime at once.\"\r\n\r\nSir Philip started, and grasped both the arms of the chair in which he\r\nsat, tight in his thin white hands, gazing at Marlow with a look of\r\nbewildered horror that cannot be described. Marlow went on, however,\r\nsaying, \"I had previously told her, indeed, that I had discovered\r\nall her dark and treacherous schemes--how she had labored to make\r\nthis whole family miserable--how she had attempted to blacken the\r\ncharacter of my dear Emily--imitated her handwriting--induced you to\r\nmisunderstand her whole conduct, and thrown dark hints and suspicions\r\nin your way. She knew that she could not escape this charge, even if\r\nshe could conceal her guilt of to-day, and she confessed the whole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who--who--who?\" cried Sir Philip Hastings, almost in a scream. \"Of\r\nwhom are you talking, man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of Mrs. Hazleton,\" replied Marlow. \"Were you not speaking of her?\"\r\n\r\nSir Philip Hastings stretched forth his hands, as if to push him\r\nfarther from him; but his only reply was a deep groan, and, after a\r\nmoment's pause, Marlow proceeded, \"I thought you were speaking of\r\nher--of her whose task it has been, ever since poor Emily's ill-starred\r\nvisit to her house, to calumniate and wrong that dear innocent girl--to\r\nmake you think her guilty of bitter indiscretions, if not great\r\ncrimes--who, more than any one, aided to wrong you, and who now openly\r\navows that she placed the poison in your poor wife's room in order to\r\ndestroy her.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I have killed her!--and I have killed her!\" cried Sir Philip\r\nHastings, rising up erect and tall--\"and I have killed her!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good God, whom?\" exclaimed Marlow, with his heart beating as if it\r\nwould burst through his side. \"Whom do you mean, sir?\"\r\n\r\nSir Philip remained silent for a moment, pressing his hands tight upon\r\nhis temples, and then answered in a slow, solemn voice, \"Your Emily--my\r\nEmily--my own sweet--\" but he did not finish the sentence; for ere the\r\nlast words could be uttered, he fell forward on the floor like a dead\r\nman.\r\n\r\nFor an instant, stupified and horror-struck, Marlow remained\r\nmotionless, hardly comprehending, hardly believing what he had heard.\r\nThe next instant, however, he rushed out of the library, and found the\r\nbutler with the late Lady Hastings' maid, passing through the back of\r\nthe house towards the front staircase.\r\n\r\n\"Which is Emily's room?\" he cried,--\"Which is Emily's room?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is asleep, sir,\" said the maid.\r\n\r\n\"Which is her room?\" cried Marlow, vehemently. \"He is mad--he is\r\nmad--your master is mad--he says he has killed her. Which is her room?\"\r\nand he darted up the staircase.\r\n\r\n\"The third on the right, sir,\" cried the butler, following with the\r\nmaid, as fast as possible; and Marlow darted towards the door.\r\n\r\nA fit of trembling, however, seized him as he laid his hand upon the\r\nlock. \"He must have exaggerated,\" he said to himself. \"He has been\r\nunkind--harsh--he calls that killing her--I will open it gently,\" and\r\nhe and the two servants entered it nearly together.\r\n\r\nAll was quiet. All was still. The light was burning on the table. There\r\nwas a large heavy pillow cast down by the side of the bed, and the bed\r\ncoverings were in some disorder.\r\n\r\nNo need of such a stealthy pace, Marlow! You may tread firm and boldly.\r\nEven your beloved step will not wake her. The body sleeps till the\r\nday of judgment. The spirit has gone where the wicked cease from\r\ntroubling, and the weary are at rest.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful face was calm and tranquil; though beneath each of\r\nthe closed eyes was a deep bluish mark, and the lips had lost their\r\nredness. The fair delicate hands grasped the bed-clothes tightly,\r\nand the whole position of the figure showed that death had not taken\r\nplace without a convulsive struggle. Marlow tried, with trembling\r\nhands, to unclasp the fingers from the bed-clothes, and though he\r\ncould not do it, he fancied he felt warmth in the palms of the hands.\r\nA momentary gleam of hope came upon him. More assistance was called:\r\nevery effort that could be suggested was made; but it was all in vain.\r\nConsciousness--breath--life--could never be restored. There was not a\r\ndry eye amongst all those around, when the young lover, giving up the\r\nhopeless task, cast himself on his knees by the bedside, and pressed\r\nhis face upon the dead hand of her whom he had loved so well.\r\n\r\nJust at that moment the voice of Sir Philip Hastings was heard below\r\nsinging a stanza of some light song. It was the most horrible sound\r\nthat ever was heard!\r\n\r\nTwo of the servants ran down in haste, and the sight of the living was\r\nas terrible as that of the dead. Philip Hastings had recovered from\r\nhis fit without assistance, had raised himself, and was now walking\r\nabout the room with the same sort of zigzag, tottering step with which\r\nhe had met Marlow on his return. A stream of blood from a wound which\r\nhe had inflicted on his forehead when he fell, was still pouring down\r\nhis face, rendering its deathlike paleness only the more ghastly. His\r\nmouth was slightly drawn aside, giving a strange sinister expression\r\nto his countenance; but from his eyes, once so full of thought and\r\nintellect, every trace of reason had vanished. He held his hands before\r\nhim, and the fingers of the one beat time upon the back of the other to\r\nthe air that he was singing, and which he continued to sing even after\r\nthe entrance of the servants. He uttered not a word to them on their\r\nappearance: he took not the slightest notice of them till the butler,\r\nseeing his condition, took him by the arm, and asked if he had not\r\nbetter go to bed.\r\n\r\nThen, Sir Philip attempted to answer, but his words when spoken were\r\nindistinct as well as confused, and it became evident that he had a\r\nstroke of palsy. The servants knew hardly what to do. Marlow they did\r\nnot dare to disturb in his deep grief: the surgeon was by this time far\r\naway: their mistress, and her fair unhappy daughter were dead: their\r\nmaster had become an idiot. It was the greatest possible relief to them\r\nwhen they beheld Mr. Dixwell the clergyman enter the library. Some boy\r\nemployed about the stables or the kitchen, had carried down a vague\r\ntale of the horrors to the Rectory; and the good clergyman, though\r\nexhausted with all the fatigues and anxiety of the day, had hurried\r\ndown at once to see what could be done for the survivors of that doomed\r\nfamily. He comprehended the situation of Sir Philip Hastings in a\r\nmoment; but he put many questions to the butler as to what preceded\r\nthe terrible event, the effects of which he beheld. The old servant\r\nanswered little. To most of the questions he merely shook his head\r\nsadly; but that mute reply was sufficient; and Mr. Dixwell, taking Sir\r\nPhilip by the hand, said, \"You had better retire to rest, sir--you are\r\nnot well.\"\r\n\r\nSir Philip Hastings gave an unmeaning smile, but followed the clergyman\r\nmildly, and having seen him to a bedroom, and left him in the hands of\r\nhis servants, Mr. Dixwell turned his step towards the chamber of poor\r\nEmily.\r\n\r\nMarlow had risen from his knees; but was still standing by the bedside\r\nwith his arms folded on his chest. His face was stern and sorrowful;\r\nbut perfectly calm.\r\n\r\nMr. Dixwell approached quietly, and in a melancholy tone, addressed\r\nto him some words of consolation--commonplace enough indeed, but well\r\nintended.\r\n\r\nMarlow laid his hand upon the clergyman's arm, and pointed to Emily's\r\nbeautiful but ghastly face. He only added, \"In vain!--Do what is\r\nneedful--Do what is right--I am incapable;\" and leaving the room, he\r\ndescended to the library, where he closed the door, and remained in\r\nsilence and solitude till day broke on the following morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nMrs. Warmington became a person of some importance with the people\r\nof Hartwell. All thoughts were turned towards her house. Everybody\r\nwished they could get in and see and hear more; for the news had spread\r\nrapidly and wide, colored and distorted; but yet falling far short\r\nof the whole terrible truth. When Mr. Short himself arrived in town,\r\nhe found three other magistrates had already assembled, and that Mr.\r\nAtkinson and Sir Philip Hastings' groom, John, were already giving them\r\nsome desultory and informal information as to the apprehension of Mr.\r\nHazleton and its causes. The first consideration after his appearance\r\namongst them, was what was to be done with the prisoner; for one of the\r\njustices--a gentleman of old family in the county, who had not much\r\nliked the appointment of the surgeon to the bench, and had generally\r\nfound motives for differing in opinion with him ever since--objected\r\nto leaving Mrs. Hazleton, even for the night, in any other place than\r\nthe common jail. The more merciful opinion of the majority, however,\r\nprevailed. Atkinson gave every assurance that the constable whom he\r\nhad placed in charge of the lady was perfectly to be depended upon,\r\nand that the room in which she was locked up, was too high to admit\r\nthe possibility of escape. Thus it was determined that Mrs. Hazleton\r\nshould be left where she was for the night, and brought before the\r\nmagistrates for examination at an early hour on the following morning.\r\n\r\nEven after this decision was come to, however, the conversation or\r\nconsultation, if it may be so called, was prolonged for some time in a\r\ngossiping, idle sort of way. Gentlemen sat upon the edge of the table\r\nwith their hats on, or leaned against the mantelpiece, beating their\r\nboots with their riding-whips, and some marvelled, and some inquired,\r\nand some expounded the law with the dignity and confidence, if not with\r\nthe sagacity and learning of a Judge. They were still engaged in this\r\ndiscussion when the news of Emily's death was brought to Hartwell,\r\nand produced a painful and terrible sensation in the breasts of the\r\nlightest and most careless of those present. The man who conveyed the\r\nintelligence brought also a summons to Mr. Short to return immediately\r\nto Sir Philip Hastings, and only waiting to get a fresh horse, the\r\nsurgeon set out upon his return with a very sad and sorrowful heart. He\r\nwould not disturb Mr. Marlow; though he was informed that he was in the\r\nlibrary; but he remained with Sir Philip Hastings himself during the\r\ngreater part of the night, and only set out for his own house to take a\r\nlittle repose before the meeting of the magistrates, some quarter of an\r\nhour before the first dawn of day.\r\n\r\nFull of painful thoughts he rode on at a quick pace, till the yellow\r\nand russet hues of the morning began to appear in the east. He then\r\nslackened his pace a little, and naturally, as he approached the house\r\nof Mrs. Warmington, he raised his eye towards the windows of the room\r\nin which he knew that the beautiful demon, who had produced so much\r\nmisery to others and herself, had been imprisoned.\r\n\r\nMr. Short was riding on; but suddenly a sound met his ear, and as his\r\neyes ran down the building from the windows above, to a small plot\r\nof grass which the lady of the house called the lawn, he drew up his\r\nhorse, and rode sharply up to the gate.\r\n\r\nBut it is time now to turn to Mrs. Hazleton. Lodged in the upper\r\nchamber which had been decided upon as the one fittest for their\r\npurpose, by Mr. Atkinson and the rest, with the constable from Hartwell\r\ndomiciled in the ante-room, and the door between locked, Mrs. Hazleton\r\ngave herself up to despair; for her state of mind well deserved that\r\nname, although her feelings were very different from those which are\r\ncommonly designated by that name. Surely to feel that every earthly\r\nhope has passed away--to see that further struggle for any object of\r\ndesire is vain--to know that the struggles which have already taken\r\nplace have been fruitless--to feel that their objects have been base,\r\nunworthy, criminal--to perceive no gleam of light on either side of\r\nthe tomb--to have the present a wilderness, the future an abyss, the\r\npast and its memories a hell--surely this is despair! It matters not\r\nwith what firmness, or what fierceness it may be borne: it matters not\r\nwhat fiery passions, what sturdy resolutions, what weak regrets, what\r\nagonizing fears, mingle with the state. This is despair! and such was\r\nthe feeling of Mrs. Hazleton. She saw vast opportunities, a splendid\r\nposition in society, wealth, beauty, wit, mind, accomplishments, all\r\nthrown away, and for the gratification of base passions exchanged for\r\ndisgrace, and crime, and a horrible death. It was a bad bargain; but\r\nshe felt she had played her whole for revenge and had lost; and she\r\nabode the issue resolutely.\r\n\r\nAll these advantages which I have enumerated, and many more, Mrs.\r\nHazleton had possessed; but she wanted two things which are absolutely\r\nnecessary to human happiness and human virtue--heart and principle. The\r\none she never could have obtained; for by nature she was heartless. The\r\nother might have been bestowed upon her by her parents. But they had\r\nfailed to do so; for their own proper principles had been too scanty\r\nfor them to bestow any on their daughter. Yet, strange to say, the lack\r\nof heart somewhat mitigated the intensity of the lady's sufferings now.\r\nShe felt not her situation as bitterly as other persons with a greater\r\nportion of sensibility would inevitably have done. She had so trained\r\nherself to resist all small emotions, that they had in reality become\r\nobliterated. Fiery passions she could feel; for the earthquake rends\r\nthe granite which the chisel will not touch, and these affected her now\r\nas much as ever.\r\n\r\nAt that very moment, as she sat there, with her head resting on her\r\nhand, what is the meaning of that stern, knitted brow, that fixed,\r\nsteadfast gaze forward, that tight compression of the lips and teeth?\r\nAt that moment Nero's wish was in the bosom of Mrs. Hazleton. Could\r\nshe have slaughtered half the human race to blot out all evidence of\r\nher crimes, and to escape the grinning shame which she knew awaited\r\nher, she would have done it without remorse. Other feelings, too, were\r\npresent. A sense of anger at herself for having suffered herself to\r\nbe in the slightest degree moved or agitated by any thing that had\r\noccurred; a determined effort, too, was there--I will not call it\r\na struggle--to regain entire command of herself--to be as calm, as\r\ngraceful, as self-possessed, as dignified as when in high prosperity\r\nwith unsullied fame. It might be, in a certain sense, playing a part,\r\nand doubtless the celebrated Madame Tiquet did the same; but she was\r\nplaying a part for her own eyes, as well as those of others. She\r\nresolved to be firm, and she was firm. \"Death,\" she said, \"is before\r\nme: for that I am prepared. It cannot agitate a nerve, or make a limb\r\nshake. All other evils are trifles compared with this. Why then should\r\nI suffer them to affect me in the least? No, no, they shall not see me\r\nquail!\"\r\n\r\nAfter she had thus thought for some two hours, gaining more and more\r\nself-command every moment, as she turned and returned all the points\r\nof her situation in her own mind, and viewed them in every different\r\naspect, she rose to retire to rest, lay down, and tried to sleep. At\r\nfirst importunate thought troubled her. The same kind of ideas went\r\non--the same reasonings upon them--and slumber for more than one hour\r\nwould not visit her eyelids. But she was a very resolute woman, and\r\nat length she determined that she would not think: she would banish\r\nthought altogether; she would not let the mind rest for one moment upon\r\nany subject whatsoever; and she succeeded. The absence of thought is\r\nsleep; and she slept; but resolution ended where sleep begun, and the\r\nimages she had banished waking, returned to the mind in slumber. Her\r\nrest was troubled. Growing fancies seemed to come thick upon her mind;\r\nthough the eyes remained closed, the features were agitated; the lips\r\nmoved. Sometimes she laughed; sometimes she moaned piteously; sometimes\r\ntears found their way through her closed eyelids; and sobs struggled in\r\nher bosom.\r\n\r\nAt length, between three and four o'clock in the morning, Mrs. Hazleton\r\nrose up in bed. She opened her eyes, too; but there was a dull glassy\r\nlook about them--a fixed leaden stare, not natural to her waking hours.\r\nSlowly she got out of bed, approached the table, took up a candle\r\nwhich she had left burning there, and which was now nearly down to the\r\nsocket, and walked straight to the door, saying aloud, \"Very dark--very\r\ndark--every thing is dark.\"\r\n\r\nShe tried the door, but found it locked; and the constable slept on.\r\nShe then returned to the table, seated herself, and for some five or\r\nten minutes continued to twist her long hair round her fingers. She\r\nthen rose again, and went straight to the window, threw it up, and\r\nseemed to look out. \"Chilly--chilly,\" she said. \"I must walk to warm\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\nThe sill of the window was somewhat high, but that was no obstacle; for\r\nthere was a chair near, and Mrs. Hazleton placed it for herself with as\r\nmuch care as if she had been wide awake. When this was done she stepped\r\nlightly upon it, and put her knee upon the window-sill, raised herself\r\nsuddenly upright, and struck her head sharply against the upper part of\r\nthe window. It is probable that the blow woke her, but at all events it\r\ndestroyed her balance, and she fell forward at once out of the window.\r\n\r\nThere was a loud shriek, and then a deep groan. But the constable slept\r\non, and no one knew the fate that had befallen her 'till Mr. Short, the\r\nsurgeon, passing the house, was attracted to the spot where she had\r\nfallen, by a moan, and the sight of a white object lying beneath the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nA loud ringing of the bell, and knocking at the door, soon roused the\r\ninhabitants of the house, and the mangled form of Mrs. Hazleton was\r\ncarried in and stretched upon a bed. She was not dead; and although\r\nalmost every bone was broken, except the skull, and the terrible\r\ninjuries she had received precluded all possibility of recovery, she\r\nregained her senses before three o'clock of the same day, and continued\r\nto linger for somewhat more than a fortnight in agonies both of mind\r\nand body, too terrible to be described. With the rapid, though gradual\r\nweakening of the corporeal frame, the powers of the mind became\r\nenfeebled--the vigorous resolution failed--the self-command abandoned\r\nher. Half an hour's death she could have borne with stoical firmness,\r\nbut a fortnight's was too much. The thoughts she could shut out in\r\nvigorous health, forced themselves upon her as she lay there like a\r\ncrushed worm, and the tortures of hell got hold upon her, long before\r\nthe spirit departed. Yet a sparkle of the old spirit showed itself\r\neven to her last hour. That she was conscious of an eternity, that\r\nshe was convinced of after judgment, of the reward of good, and of\r\nthe punishment of evil, that she believed in a God, a hell, a heaven,\r\nthere can be no doubt--indeed her words more than once implied it--and\r\nthe anguish of mind under which she seemed to writhe proved it. But\r\nyet, she refused all religious consolation; expressed no penitence:\r\nno sorrow for what she had done, and scoffed at the surgeon when he\r\nhinted that repentance might avail her even then. It seemed that, as\r\nwith the earthly future, she had made up her mind at once, when first\r\ndetected, to meet her fate boldly; so with the judgment of the immortal\r\nfuture, she was resolute to encounter it unbending. When urged, nearly\r\nat her last hour, to show some repentance, she replied in the weak and\r\nfaltering voice of death, but in as determined a tone as ever, \"It\r\nis all trash. An hour's repentance could do no good even if I could\r\nrepent. But I do not. Nobody does repent. They regret their failure,\r\nare terrified by their punishment; but they and I would do exactly the\r\nsame again if we hoped for success and impunity. Talk to me no more of\r\nit. I do not wish to think of hell till it has hold upon me, if that\r\nshould ever be.\"\r\n\r\nShe said no more from that moment forward, and in about an hour after,\r\nher spirit went to meet the fate she had so boldly dared.\r\n\r\nBut few persons remain to be noticed in this concluding chapter, and\r\nwith regard to their after history, the imagination of the reader might\r\nperhaps be left to deal, without further information. A few words,\r\nhowever, may be said, merely to give a clue to their after fate.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution of Mr. Shanks, the attorney, was carried on but\r\nlanguidly, and it is certain that he was not convicted of the higher\r\noffence of forgery. On some charge, however, it would seem he was\r\nsentenced to two years imprisonment, and the last that is heard of him,\r\nshows him blacking shoes at the inn in Carrington, then a very old man,\r\nin the reign of George the First.\r\n\r\nSir Philip Hastings never recovered his senses, nor did he seem to have\r\nany recollection of the horrible events with which his earthly history\r\nmay be said to have closed; but his life was not far extended. For\r\nabout six months he continued in the same lamentable state in which\r\nwe have last depicted him, sometimes singing, sometimes laughing, and\r\nsometimes absorbed in deep melancholy. At the end of that period,\r\nanother paralytic stroke left him in a state of complete fatuity, from\r\nwhich in two years he was relieved by death.\r\n\r\nIf the reader will look into the annals of the reign of Queen Anne he\r\nwill find frequent mention in the campaigns of Marlborough and Eugene,\r\nof a Major, a Colonel, and a General Marlow. They were all the same\r\nperson; and they will find that officer often reported as severely\r\nwounded. I cannot trace his history much farther; but the genealogies\r\nof those times show, that in 1712, one Earl of Launceston died at the\r\nage of eighty-seven, and was succeeded by the eighth Earl, who only\r\nsurvived three years, and the title with him became extinct, as it\r\nis particularly marked that he died unmarried. As this last of the\r\nrace is distinguished by the title of Lieutenant-General, the Earl of\r\nLaunceston, there can be no doubt that this was the lover and promised\r\nhusband of poor Emily Hastings.\r\n\r\nIt is a sad tale, and rarely perhaps has any such tragedy darkened\r\nthe page of domestic history in England. A whole family were swept\r\naway, and most of those connected with them, in a very short space\r\nof time; but it is not the number of deaths within that period that\r\ngives its gloominess to the page--for every domestic history is little\r\nbut a record of deaths--but the circumstances. Youth, beauty, virtue,\r\ngentleness, kindness, honor, integrity, punctilious rectitude: reason,\r\nenergy, wisdom, sometimes, nay often, have no effect as a screen, from\r\nmisfortune, sorrow, and death. Were this world all, what a frightful\r\nchaos would human life be. But the very sorrows and adversities of the\r\ngood, prove that there is a life beyond, where all will be made even.\r\n\r\n                               THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      From Bentley's Miscellany.\r\n\r\nCALCUTTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are in Calcutta four colleges established by Government, besides\r\nnumerous other institutions for the diffusion of learning. Education,\r\nindeed, is very general in the metropolis, and there are but few, even\r\namong the natives, making any pretensions to respectability, who have\r\nnot some acquaintance with European literature. I have heard as pure\r\nEnglish spoken by Hindoos in Calcutta as by men of rank in London, and\r\npieces from our poets recited by a lad of color with a correctness of\r\ndiction and eloquence that would have done credit to any of our youth\r\nat home. Go where you will in Calcutta, enter the narrowest streets\r\nand the most obscure alleys, and you will find pedagogues engaged in\r\nteaching Pinnock or Goldsmith to the children, and ragged urchins of\r\nthree or four years old shouting in concert, B-l-a, bla; c-l-a, cla.\r\nAnd then turn your eyes in an opposite direction; look at the wealthy\r\nand the noble of mature age, enter their houses, and what will you\r\nsee and hear? You will see their dwellings furnished and their tables\r\nlaid out in _English_ style; you will see them possessed of libraries\r\ncomposed of the best works of the most approved _English_ authors;\r\nyou will see _English_ newspapers regularly filed; you will see them\r\ncorresponding in _English_ with their friends and connections; and you\r\nwill hear them conversing on the topics of the day or their own private\r\naffairs in the _English_ tongue. A person who had never travelled\r\nbeyond the metropolis would be apt, on seeing all this, to exclaim,\r\n\"The people will soon be thoroughly Anglicised!\" But it is all confined\r\nto Calcutta, and even there is rather, perhaps, the result of a wish to\r\noutshine, than of a desire to improve.\r\n\r\nA Mechanics' Institute was a few years since established in Calcutta.\r\nInstitutions of this kind are particularly required in India, where\r\nthe national systems of agriculture, commerce, mechanics, science,\r\nliterature, and philosophy are so wretched; where prejudice and\r\nsuperstition impede improvement, and sloth and ignorance have had so\r\nlong a reign. It is surely the duty of those who seek affluence in\r\nthat country to encourage them, and thus endeavor to benefit the land\r\nfrom whose resources they expect to gain it. But, in spite of the old\r\nadage, \"What's in a name?\" the fate of this institution proved that\r\nthere is something very important in the nomenclature of a thing. The\r\ntitle \"Mechanic\" is in a manner _despised_ by the European community\r\nof Calcutta and their Euratian brethren; and so long as the Institute\r\ncontinued to bear the title which distinguished it as dedicated to\r\nsuch, notwithstanding the plainness with which it exhibited its claims\r\nto support as an institution calculated to disseminate a correct and\r\npractical knowledge of science, and a familiar acquaintance with\r\nthe fine arts throughout the empire, and by the improvements such a\r\nknowledge would induce ulteriorly to promote the interests of all\r\nconnected with India; notwithstanding appeals to the press, public\r\nlectures and private solicitations; notwithstanding the most brilliant\r\nspeeches of the most eloquent orators (among whom may be particularly\r\nmentioned Mr. George Thompson), it languished for want of support,\r\ngradually decayed, and seemed about to yield up the ghost. It was\r\nat last suggested, that though the expedients above alluded to had\r\nfailed to stay the progress of disease, or invigorate the system,\r\none, powerful as a galvanic battery, yet remained to be tried, a new\r\nnomenclature. It was proposed that the vulgar title of \"Mechanics'\r\nInstitute\" should be thrown off, and the elegant and euphonious one of\r\n\"The Lyceum\" adopted. This was done; and wonderful was the effect. The\r\nyoung and tender tree revived in an instant, refreshing streams of cash\r\nwere poured in abundance upon its roots; the very nobles of the land\r\ncame forward to tend it, and now it flourishes and blooms, and promises\r\nere long to produce a rich abundance of fruit. Still it is in reality\r\nthe same as before in all but its name.\r\n\r\nI have alluded to Mr. George Thompson. His arrival in India in 1843\r\nwas greeted by all classes of the community with joy. All had heard of\r\nhis eloquence and his ability, of the interest he had exhibited in the\r\naffairs of, and his design in visiting, India, and therefore hailed him\r\nas the champion of her interests. Hindoo and Mussulman flocked eagerly\r\naround the standard he raised as a patriot leader, listened to his\r\naddresses, and, as he enlarged on their rights and wrongs (so far as he\r\nknew them) felt discontent, hatred to the rulers of their country, and\r\nbold resolutions to free it from their tyranny, rising within them. The\r\npress lauded and flattered him; invitations overwhelmed him; patriotic\r\nsocieties rose from nonentity at his presence; and his person and\r\ncharacter were themes of inquiry and constant disquisition; imitative\r\nwould-be orators sprang up in multitudes, and poured forth torrents\r\nof anger and abuse against Government, and all was excitement, all\r\nradicalism. Suddenly the man on whom the eyes of the people were fixed\r\nas their instructor and guide left the metropolis, and when he again\r\nappeared in it, did so in the character of ambassador from the Great\r\nMogul. With what abuse he then met, let the periodicals of the day\r\ntestify. \"Where now,\" it was asked, \"are his magniloquent professions\r\nof philanthropy, his self-devotedness, and his zeal in the cause of\r\nIndia?\"\r\n\r\nIn India, as in England, the public appetite for the drama seems to\r\nhave been satiated. There is a very elegant theatre in Calcutta, but\r\nit is now closed. It languished for want of support, though several\r\ntalented performers were attached to it. Mrs. Leach, its founder and\r\ngreatest ornament, was an exquisite actress. A Miss Cowley and a Miss\r\nBaxter, too, were both superior and elegant actresses. The latter\r\npreserved the theatre to the community on a former occasion, when it\r\nseemed about to fall. A circumstance, as true as it is laughable,\r\nconnected with this theatre, occurred in 1841. Two ladies, engaged in\r\nEngland for it, and sent out, were actually entered among the \"imports\r\nmanifest\" for the port of Calcutta, as goods consigned to the manager\r\nof the playhouse!\r\n\r\nThe newspaper is as necessary an adjunct to the breakfast table in\r\nCalcutta as it is in London. The military man looks eagerly for\r\naccounts from the north-west; turns to the lists of promotions and\r\nstaff appointments, and forgets not to cast his eye at the obituary;\r\nthe civilian searches for the advertisements which announce fresh\r\narrivals of horses from Persia, Burmah, and Arabia; spinsters' and\r\noilmen's stores from England; and wines and fruits from France; just\r\nglancing at the drafts of laws about to be enacted, and conning over\r\nthe programme of the next races; and the merchant studies the accounts\r\nrelative to indigo, sugar, and saltpetre. But the greatest excitement\r\nprevails when the mail from England is due. How eagerly is it looked\r\nfor, and when it arrives, how are its contents scanned and analyzed!\r\n\r\nThere are six English newspapers published in Calcutta and its\r\nneighborhood. The editors are all men of experience and talent, who\r\nknow how to suit the appetites of their customers. An English reader,\r\nhowever, taking up one of our Indian newspapers, would think it a very\r\ndull affair, for he would find one-third of it editorial and local\r\nnews, another third advertisements, and the remainder, extracts from\r\nthe London magazines. Now this is what just suits the Anglo-Indians.\r\nThe advertisements tell them what to do with their money, the residue\r\ninforms them of what is going on, and gives them the very pith of\r\nliterature without putting them to the trouble of cutting it from the\r\ncrust.\r\n\r\nThe Indian press has been stigmatized in England as a \"licentious,\" a\r\n\"rascally,\" and an \"unscrupulous\" one. This is very far from being the\r\ncase. It has its faults, but they are not of such a kind. Indeed, it\r\nseems to me, that in point of purity, honesty, and morality, it may\r\nchallenge comparison with the press of Great Britain itself, and most\r\ndecidedly it possesses a powerful influence with the executive. It has\r\nbeen the means, within the last few years, of causing the abolition\r\nof lotteries, the appointment of deputy magistrates, and many other\r\nmeasures tending to the moralization and welfare of the country. It\r\nscans and fearlessly criticises the acts of Government; it shows a\r\nspirit of active benevolence in pleading the cause of the injured, to\r\nwhatever class they may belong; and proves itself impartially just.\r\n\r\nIn addition to newspapers several magazines and other periodicals\r\nare published in Calcutta. The whole of the periodical publications\r\namount in number to forty. A Quarterly Review has lately been added to\r\nthose, and also a Magazine, the intended publication of which, and its\r\ncharacter, were announced in so curious a manner, that I shall copy\r\nthe advertisement at full length for the benefit of the reader: \"In\r\nthe press, and will be published on the 1st of July, and continued\r\nmonthly, a new periodical, entitled, The British India Magazine,\r\nand Daily and Monthly Treasury, a most useful Writing and Reading\r\nTable Manual of Reference, Memoranda, Expenditure, and Literature,\r\nto which is added a Precis of the News of the past month, Political,\r\nFashionable, Social, Commercial, Humorous, and Scientific. It is\r\nequally adapted for ladies in general, as for Gentlemen of the Civil,\r\nMilitary, and Uncovenanted Services, Members of the Legal and Medical\r\nProfessions, Merchants, Indigo and Sugar Planters, and Planters'\r\nAssistants, Captains and Officers of Ships, Clerks in Mercantile\r\nHouses, &c., or in fact, for all Persons by whom due order and\r\nregularity in the expenditure of their Time and Income is considered an\r\nobject worthy of notice. It is compiled upon a method perfectly novel\r\nin the annals of the Press, be it American, Asiatic, or European, and\r\nmay be had (per dak) in all parts of British India.\"\r\n\r\nThere, dear reader, match that in Europe, if you can! \"Why this is\r\na real Vade Mecum; and, mark you! a _most_ useful one--one equally\r\nadapted for ladies in general as for gentlemen, or in fact for _all_\r\npersons.\" Doubtless it will have a prodigious circulation as soon as\r\nits merits are fully known. I have not met with any one who has read it.\r\n\r\nBooks published in India, whatever may be their nature, seldom repay\r\nthe cost of print and paper. Even the Calcutta newspapers have between\r\nthem all no more than three or four thousand subscribers, and yet our\r\ncountrymen there read a great deal. But the works which have emanated\r\nfrom the pens of Anglo-Indian writers have in general been so dull and\r\nspiritless, that the community has learned to regard all such with\r\nindifference; and as the booksellers regularly supply the newest and\r\nbest European productions, these inferior viands are almost entirely\r\nneglected. An annual has once or twice been published, but did not meet\r\nwith sufficient patronage to allow of its being regularly continued.\r\n\r\nThe police of India has always been inefficient. Robberies committed\r\nunder the very noses of the watchmen are common. When they should be\r\non the look-out, they are found sleeping, and when they are awake are\r\ncareless and negligent. The worst of them in all India are to be found\r\nin its great metropolis; in Calcutta, indeed, they seem to possess\r\nno honesty or fidelity, and often turn out greater rogues than those\r\nthey bring to justice. Policemen in the confidence of the European\r\nauthorities have before now been discovered to be at the head of\r\nparties of Thugs, to whom they have thus had the means of communicating\r\nall necessary intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe native _employés_ in our courts of justice are equally corrupt.\r\nEvery Hindoo and Mussulman who has occasion to resort to these courts,\r\ntakes with him a bribe, knowing that unless he does so, it will be\r\nall but impossible for him to obtain a fair and impartial hearing.\r\nThe _omlah_ who should decline a bribe, would be accounted a fool by\r\nhis fellow officials. And so some of them make fortunes; _e. g._, a\r\n_sheristader_ at one of our civil courts, who had been only ten years\r\nin that office, on a salary of one hundred rupees a month, and with\r\nno other income save a trifling share in a small patrimonial estate,\r\nmanaged, a short time back, to purchase landed property to the value of\r\nfifty thousand rupees.\r\n\r\nEnter a criminal court, whether the deponent swear by the water of\r\nthe Ganges held in his hand, or by the Koran laid on his head, or by\r\nlicking off salt from a sword, or by placing a milk-jug on his back,\r\nor any other mode practised among them, you will find that perjury and\r\nthe grossest exaggeration are with him far more common than truth. If\r\nhe has received a light box or a gentle kick, he will make oath that he\r\nhas been half murdered; and if he has been robbed of an article worth\r\ntwenty rupees, will swear its value was a hundred!\r\n\r\nA judge has seldom a more conflicting mass of evidence before him\r\non which to decide the merits of a case, than he has who seeks by\r\ninvestigating the principles and conduct of this people to form an\r\nopinion of their general character. It seems to me that, as a nation,\r\nthere is no other people so profligate, so licentious and avaricious,\r\nso addicted to lying, dishonesty, procrastination, gossip, and\r\nperpetual egotism, so servile, so litigious, and so filthy; and no\r\nother so barren of nearly every good quality. Their code of morality,\r\nto judge from their practice, is a huge mass of every thing bad,\r\nmingled with a few almost imperceptible grains of some things that are\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nIn India, when we look around us and see the fertility of the earth,\r\nthe abundance of grain and fruit it produces, we feel astonished that\r\nthose engaged in agriculture should be, as they really are, almost\r\ndestitute of a bare subsistence. The Irish peasantry are rarely so\r\nbadly off as those of Hindostan. Inquiry shows us this is the result of\r\na system prevailing throughout the country, the oppression of the ryots\r\nby the Zemindars. Yes, it is not the taxes, which are comparatively\r\nlight, that cause this evil, but the exactions of the rich natives\r\nfrom the poor ones. The peasantry have no money, they require advances\r\nto enable them to cultivate, these are granted to them at the most\r\nexorbitant rate of usury by the landlords, and as the one party never\r\ngets out of debt, so the other never ceases its extortions.\r\n\r\nThus the poor are kept poor. The personal property of a peasant seldom\r\nexceeds three or four shillings in value. His wardrobe consists of a\r\npiece of coarse cloth, just large enough to gird round his body, a\r\nsimilar piece thrown across the shoulders, and a skull-cap or turban,\r\nmade of long strips of the same material. And as for his household\r\ngoods, a few drinking vessels, an earthen jar, an iron plate, and a\r\nrickety bedstead comprise in general the whole.\r\n\r\nVery little attention is paid in Calcutta, or anywhere else in India,\r\nto home politics. Indeed they are never discussed at table. Let a man\r\nhave been ever so violent a Tory or zealous a Whig, six months in India\r\nwill generally find him, so far as his discourse can testify, neuter.\r\nOne reason of this is, that if he should attempt to introduce political\r\nsubjects in conversation, he would not be listened to. It is only when\r\nIndia and Indian interests are concerned, that even a powerful debate\r\nin the House meets with the slightest attention. Theatricals, races,\r\nretiring funds, public characters, civil and military appointments,\r\nthese, and such like subjects, form the ordinary topics of discourse.\r\nAnd you may always know when a man has lived any time in India,\r\nfor a little of the Eastern spice is sure to be found in all his\r\nconversation. He cannot conceal it.\r\n\r\nAn anecdote was one day related to me, which exemplifies the sad\r\ncondition of those habitual consumers of opium, many of whom are to\r\nbe found among the natives. A Hindoo gentleman, who was accustomed\r\nto indulge in it, being about to remove to a distant and almost\r\nuninhabited province, in which he knew it would be difficult to\r\nprocure opium, laid in a large quantity of it to take with him, and\r\nmade arrangements for having more regularly forwarded. Soon after his\r\narrival at his destination, one of his servants decamped, robbing him\r\nof a large amount in money, and a variety of other articles, among\r\nwhich his entire stock of opium was included. The period at which he\r\nexpected his first auxiliary supply was yet distant; but he immediately\r\nsent for a quantity to his agent; as this however did not arrive for a\r\nconsiderable time, he was at a loss for his usual stimulant, pined away\r\nin a few days for want of it, and in less than a fortnight died.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous low chop-houses and taverns in Calcutta, to which\r\nour poorer countrymen resort, and these are the nests of profligacy and\r\nlicentiousness. Impositions too, of the grossest and most atrocious\r\nnature, are practised by the proprietors of some, on those who frequent\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhile in the country I made one of a small party at an annual festival,\r\ngiven by the native officers of a Government establishment in the\r\nneighborhood. The worthy _baboo_, who was at the head of the concern,\r\nhad resolved to prepare for the half-dozen Europeans whom he expected\r\nto honor the feast with their presence, two things, of which most\r\n_Feringees_ approve, viz., a _pillau_ and a bottle of brandy. Being a\r\nHindoo, however, he had substituted pieces of cheese for meat in the\r\nstew, thinking, no doubt, that it would make but little difference to\r\nus. Of course, we could not touch it; but we did not mind its loss, as\r\nthe _aqua vitæ_ yet remained. The master of the ceremonies, however,\r\nhad forgotten to provide a corkscrew. In this emergency one of our\r\nnumber offered to save the trouble of sending for one by knocking\r\noff the neck of the bottle with the butt of his riding-whip. This he\r\nattempted, but, missing his aim, broke the bottle and spilt all the\r\nliquor. It was too late to send for more, and, as we did not find any\r\nthing else to our relish, we came away after all, much to the vexation\r\nof our host, without having tasted either bit or drop.\r\n\r\nHow different in the effects they produce on the heart, and in the\r\nsentiments they awaken, are the various seasons of the year in India to\r\nthe same in our native land. How sweetly speaks the changing year to\r\nthe minds of the unsophisticated and innocent of England's children!\r\nAre their hearts oppressed by misfortune? with the spring they revive,\r\nand, like nature, shake off the torpor into which, overcome by their\r\nsorrows, they were sinking, while Hope, with the flowers, buds once\r\nmore sweetly forth. The summer sun brings with it cheerfulness and\r\njoy; hearts and hopes together expand; they watch, with anxiety and\r\npleasure, the ripening of the dainty fruits, which promise in autumn to\r\nreplenish their board; they sport in the new-mown and perfume-exhaling\r\nfields; they bathe in the clear, unruffled stream, and feel convinced\r\nthat earth has not yet been despoiled by sin of all its charms, that\r\nthere are pursuits at once pure and delightful, that man is not made\r\nto mourn but to rejoice, and that in nature, the beneficence of the\r\nDeity is demonstrated. Even stern winter has something pleasant in his\r\ncountenance, and is kind enough to make them sometimes long for his\r\nreturn while enjoying the smiles of seasons more congenial; for they\r\nwith rapture anticipate a meeting with the friends whom he assembles;\r\nthe sweet congratulations, the merry tales, the laughter-exciting\r\nsongs, which will then burst forth from affectionate and happy hearts,\r\nand make the blazing hearth a scene of unalloyed ecstasy. But it is not\r\nthus in the arid and joyless East. We watch the approach of spring with\r\napprehension, for it brings in its train disease and death; we shrink,\r\nand seek in the mountains a refuge from the fiery temper and scorching\r\nbreath of summer; autumn's gloom makes all nature distasteful to us;\r\nand winter, though it affords a temporary relief from pain, is totally\r\nunproductive of pleasure.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of his Indian career, the military officer in the\r\nHon. Company's service, finds that nearly all the labor, though but a\r\nsmall share of the honor or profit, of sustaining our hardly-earned\r\nreputation, falls on his shoulders, and on those of his comrades. The\r\nhonor is almost entirely engrossed, and what little falls to his share\r\nis entirely eclipsed by that allotted to his superiors in rank; the\r\nincome he derives from his position is insignificant when compared\r\nwith that of his contemporaries of the civil service. The civilian, it\r\nis well known, has a far better chance of making a fortune in twenty,\r\nthan the soldier in forty years. From the period of his arrival in\r\nthe country, until after having studied and passed an examination\r\nin the Hindee and Persian languages, he is reported qualified for\r\nthe public service, and receives an appointment; the former enjoys a\r\nsalary superior to that which is paid to the latter as the allowance\r\nof an ensign or cornet. The military man cannot obtain any staff\r\nemploy which affords an augmentation of pay until he shows himself\r\nwell qualified in the native languages. Then again, the civilian, if\r\nhe manifest any ability, may, in ten or twelve years, rise to a high\r\nand lucrative post; whereas the poor scarlet-coated hero, unless he\r\nhave the good fortune to get a quarter-master, or interpreter-ship, or\r\nto be appointed an aid-de-camp, has to vegetate on two hundred rupees\r\n_per mensem_, for some thirteen or fourteen years, when he may receive\r\nan additional hundred with a lieutenancy. Supposing him, however, to\r\nhave obtained a good snug berth, his income will be a trifle when\r\ncompared with that of the civilian, who escaped from the school-bench\r\nat the same time as himself, while he is always exposed to changes and\r\ninconveniences of which the latter knows nothing. But the sub has one\r\ncomfort amidst all this: \"In due time,\" thinks he, \"I may hope to be a\r\ngeneral.\"\r\n\r\n                    \"Hope told a flattering tale,\"\r\n\r\nis, however, the exclamation of many an old veteran in his declining\r\nyears; and still oftener is it the sorrowful evidence of those who\r\nlive to mourn over the early extinction of even the most brilliant\r\nprospects entertained by youthful relatives, who have fallen a prey to\r\nthe inclemencies of a climate which their constitutions were unfitted\r\nto sustain.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, fortunes are not now-a-days made, even by the most\r\n_fortunate_ of our countrymen, so easily as they were some fifty,\r\nor even thirty years ago. Nor are we even worthy of comparison with\r\nthe natives of India in this respect. On the station of Cawnpore are\r\nnow residing the two sons of a man who, report says, was nothing\r\nmore than a common _bobarchee_, or cook, in the household of the\r\nlate king of Lucknow, but who, by his skill in spicing wine, and\r\nmanufacturing peculiarly delicious draughts of an inebriating nature,\r\nattracted the notice of his majesty, a man of licentious and depraved\r\nhabits, accounted an orthodox Mussulman, but exceedingly fond of\r\nthe bottle. The monarch having tasted a sample of his _bobarchee's_\r\nelixir, to reward his skill and encourage his merit, presented him\r\nwith a situation near the royal person, and as, while holding this\r\nappointment, he continued to afford him the highest satisfaction,\r\nadvanced him step by step, and at length, on a vacancy occurring, as a\r\nmark of his especial favor, gave him the post of prime minister.\r\n\r\nThis office he continued to hold until his master's decease; and in\r\nthe mean time obtained so great an influence with the monarch that his\r\nmajesty is said to have been little better than an automaton, whose\r\nmovements were regulated by his hand. His chief object, like that of\r\nall his countrymen, being to amass wealth, he tyrannized over the\r\npeople, and left no stone unturned beneath which he deemed it possible\r\nthat wealth might be discovered. One mode of \"raising the wind\" was\r\nfrequently practised by him. A merchant, or other rich man, having just\r\ncompleted the erection of a large and magnificent abode, in which to\r\nspend luxuriously the remainder of his days, the minister would forward\r\nto him an official dispatch, intimating that the spot on which he had\r\nbuilt must be immediately cleared for state purposes, and that no\r\ncompensation would be given him.\r\n\r\nAstonished and perplexed at such a notice from an authority it was\r\nuseless to dispute, the unfortunate victim would, perhaps, endeavor, by\r\npointing out some other eligible spot for the presumed purpose of the\r\ngovernment, and offering a _muzzur_ of, it may be, ten thousand rupees,\r\nto avert the threatened calamity; but to no purpose, for the wily man,\r\nwho had risen from the office of a slave to the highest post under the\r\ncrown, would at first accept of no terms. The petitioner, therefore,\r\nturned away in despair, and went back to his house, to which, after a\r\nfew hours, an emissary of the minister would follow him with a message,\r\nintimating that should any thing worthy his acceptance be presented to\r\nthe premier in his private character, he would use his influence with\r\nthe king to have the order revoked. Elated with this apparent chance of\r\nescape, the unlucky individual thus destined to be \"squeezed\" would,\r\nperhaps, offer a sum larger than the minister had anticipated. But\r\neven this was sure to be indignantly refused, and not until the victim\r\nhad been visited over and over again, and no hope of any larger offer\r\nremained, would the bribe be accepted. Thus, and by a variety of other\r\nmeans, the _bobarchee_ gathered a vast amount of wealth. On the death\r\nof the monarch who had so blindly favored and elevated him, he fared\r\nbut poorly, however, for the new king threw him into prison. It was now\r\n_his_ turn to bribe, and a timely present of fifty lacs of rupees to an\r\ninfluential person procured his release. Even then he had an immense\r\nfortune remaining, and thinking it best to secure both his person and\r\nhis money against further annoyance and depredation, he left Lucknow,\r\nand settled down in our dominions.\r\n\r\nWhile residing in Calcutta, I was brought into frequent contact with\r\nindividuals belonging to the Eurasian or half-caste population, and as\r\ncomparatively little is known of this class of people in England, I\r\nshall here make a few remarks on their character.\r\n\r\nThey are generally the descendants of European fathers by native\r\nmothers. The great majority of them are of Portuguese, many of British,\r\nand some of French extraction. Altogether they form a community by\r\nthemselves, as distinct from the European society around them as\r\nfrom the Hindoos and Mahommedans. They do not travel; here they live\r\nand multiply, marrying generally among themselves. As they are daily\r\nincreasing in number, they will, of course, in time become so numerous\r\nas to consider themselves a nation, and to demand a place in history.\r\nShould such, however, be the case, I do not think they will occupy a\r\nvery high position in the scale of nations. Great talent (I will not\r\nmention _genius_) and sterling abilities seem very scarce amongst them.\r\nThey devote no attention to the cultivation of the arts, they manifest\r\nno zeal in the pursuits of science, no independence, no brotherly\r\nfeeling towards each other. The females, at best, receive but a\r\nsuperficial education, it generally extending only to reading, writing,\r\nand the mechanical performance of music, dancing, and ornamental\r\nneedlework, and in none of these do they show any extraordinary skill.\r\nAs girls they are flirts and coquettes; as women they are vain, idle,\r\nand slovenly.\r\n\r\nLet me be candid, however. I have found among the Eurasians men\r\npossessing a versatility of talent that would do honor to any\r\nof our own countrymen, and females adorned with every grace and\r\naccomplishment. But such characters are very, _very_ scarce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        From Sharpe's Magazine\r\n\r\nREVOLUTIONS OF RUSSIA\r\n\r\nTHE ACCESSION OF NICHOLAS I., 1825.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  FROM THE FRENCH OF ALEXANDER DUMAS.\r\n\r\nThe death of the Emperor Alexander placed the inhabitants of his\r\nempire in mourning; for the grief and loyalty of the lower classes\r\nwere sincere, and their attachment to his person almost idolatrous in\r\nits character. The public feeling was increased by the prospect of\r\nthe reign of an unpopular sovereign afflicted with mental malady, and\r\ndevoid of courtesy.\r\n\r\nAs for the Grand-duke Nicholas, no one thought of him, but the Russian\r\npeople dreaded the accession of Constantine, whom they considered their\r\nsovereign in right of his primogeniture. In no country in the world\r\nhas this natural law been so repeatedly broken. Every person in Russia\r\nwas aware that the heir-presumptive had purchased his marriage with a\r\nPolish lady, the object of his ardent affections, by the resignation\r\nof his claims to the succession, but that he would abide by that act\r\nseemed a conjecture too improbable to be entertained by any one.\r\nConstantine was nevertheless sincere when he abandoned his rights, and\r\nhe hastened to assure his next brother that he was so, by his youngest\r\nbrother the Grand-duke Michael, through whom he forwarded a letter\r\nconfirming his resignation of the throne, and acknowledging his next\r\nbrother as his sovereign. The courier from St. Petersburg crossed the\r\nGrand-duke Michael, and brought letters from Nicholas acknowledging\r\nConstantine as his Emperor, and urging him to ascend the throne. The\r\nwife of Constantine joined her entreaties to those of the next heir,\r\nand with rare devotion offered to resign her consort rather than that\r\nshould give up the empire for her. Constantine, over whose mental\r\nagonies the soothing influence of the fair Pole possessed a magical\r\npower, continued firm in his resolution to remain in the condition of\r\na subject, and he adhered to the determination he had expressed in the\r\nimportant document of which the Grand-duke Michael was the bearer, and\r\nwhich is here subjoined:\r\n\r\n\"MY VERY DEAR BROTHER,--I received yesterday, with feelings of profound\r\nsorrow, intelligence of the death of our adored sovereign, and my\r\nbenefactor, the Emperor Alexander. In hastening to assure you of the\r\npainful feelings this misfortune has excited in my mind, I do only\r\nmy duty in announcing to you that I have forwarded to her Imperial\r\nMajesty, our august mother, a letter, in which I declare, that in\r\nconsequence of the rescript I obtained from the late Emperor, bearing\r\ndate February the 2d, 1822, permitting my renunciation of the throne,\r\nit is now my unalterable determination to give up to you all my rights\r\nto the Empire of Russia. I entreated, at the same time, our beloved\r\nmother, to make this declaration public, that the same may be put into\r\nimmediate execution. After this declaration, I regard it as a sacred\r\nduty to beseech your Imperial Majesty to receive the first from me,\r\nthe oath of fidelity and submission, and to permit me to say that I do\r\nnot aspire to any other title or dignity than that of Czarowitz, with\r\nwhich my august father deigned to honor my services. My solo happiness,\r\nhereafter, will consist in giving your Imperial Majesty continual\r\nproofs of my unbounded devotion and respect for your person, of which\r\nthirty years of constant and zealous service to the Emperors, my father\r\nand brother, are the pledge, in which sentiments I wish to serve your\r\nImperial Majesty, and your successors, until the end of my life, in my\r\npresent situation and functions.\r\n\r\n  \"I am, with the most profound respect,\r\n                                                \"CONSTANTINE.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the receipt of the dispatches which followed this letter, the\r\nGrand-duke, called to reign over a vast Empire, by the repeated\r\nabdication of his brother of the rights of primogeniture, no longer\r\nhesitated,--he published the former correspondence between the Emperor\r\nAlexander and the Grand-duke Constantine, with the document already\r\nquoted upon the 25th of December, 1825, and fixed the morrow for his\r\nrecognition as their sovereign by his people.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of St. Petersburg, relieved from their dread of a\r\nsecond Paul by the abdication of the heir-presumptive, began to\r\nreflect with hope upon the promise which the talents and pure moral\r\ncharacter of their new sovereign afforded them. The handsomest and\r\nbravest man in his dominions, his fine person attracted attention, and\r\nhis reserved manners excited awe. His grave carriage, his downcast\r\nlook, only raised to penetrate to the soul the man who ventured to\r\nobserve him, with a glance which compelled him to know and reverence\r\nhis master--his haughty manner of interrogation, so unlike the suavity\r\nof Alexander, or the bluntness of Constantine, had isolated him from\r\nthe rest of the imperial family, and centred him in the bosom of his\r\nown domestic circle. The Russian people, feeling their need of a guide,\r\nat once comprehended that the cold dignity of this prince concealed an\r\nindomitable will, and that, if they themselves had not chosen their new\r\nsovereign, God had considered their need, and given to the Russians,\r\nwho were at once too polished and too barbarous, a man who would grasp\r\nthe sceptre in an iron hand covered with a velvet glove.\r\n\r\nThe morrow, though considered as a day of joy and festivity, was\r\npreceded by some rumors that, like the breath of an approaching\r\ntempest, gave warning that some great national crisis was at hand. It\r\nwas whispered in the evening of the 25th that the abdication of the\r\nCzarowitz was a forgery, and that Constantine, then exercising the\r\nauthority of Viceroy of Poland, was on full march for St. Petersburg\r\nwith an army to claim the empire as his birthright. In addition to this\r\nstartling rumor, it was said that several regiments, and among them\r\nthat of Moscow, had determined to take the oath to no Russian prince\r\nbut Constantine; and the words, \"Let Nicholas live, but let Constantine\r\nreign,\" were heard at intervals in the streets as an intimation of the\r\nstate of the military pulse.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the conspiracy which had disturbed the last days of the\r\nEmperor Alexander was about to raise its head, and seize upon the\r\nGreat-Duke Constantine's name as its rallying point. This Prince, who\r\nhad passed his life with the army, was beloved by the soldiers, and\r\nthe conspirators, who understood little of the character of their\r\nnew sovereign, supposed the revolt of the regiments stationed in St.\r\nPetersburg would compel him to resign his recently acquired rights.\r\nThey would then summon Constantine to receive the empire, and with it\r\nthe constitution they had prepared. If he refused to accept it, they\r\nintended to imprison him and the rest of the imperial family. They\r\nwould then establish a republic, an oligarchy in which the despotism of\r\nthe many would replace the despotism of one. Such was the design of a\r\nparty composed of military aristocrats, who, bolder than the murderers\r\nof Paul, dared, by open force and secret fraud, to contest the throne\r\nof Russia with its new sovereign. The soldiers, devoted to Constantine,\r\nthey designed to make their blind instruments in a conspiracy of which\r\nthat Prince was not the real object, but their own aggrandisement.\r\n\r\nFaithful to their plans, the Prince Stah---- and the two Bes---- went\r\nto the barracks of the 2d, 3d, 5th and 6th companies of the Regiment of\r\nMoscow, whom they knew to be devoted to Constantine. The Prince then\r\ninformed these men that they were deceived respecting the abdication\r\nof the Czarowitz, and pointed out Alexander B---- to their attention,\r\nwhom he affirmed had been sent from Warsaw to warn them against taking\r\nthe oath to the Grand-duke Nicholas. The address of Alexander B----,\r\nconfirming this astounding communication, excited a great sensation\r\namong the troops, of which the Prince took advantage by ordering\r\nthem to load and present. At that instant the Aide-de-camp Verighny\r\nand Major-General Fredericks, who commanded the grenadiers, having\r\nthe charge of the flag, came to invite the officers to visit the\r\ncolonel of the regiment. Prince Stah----, who believed the favorable\r\nmoment was come, ordered the soldiers to repulse the grenadiers with\r\n_coup-de-crosses_, and to take away their flag, at the same time\r\nthrowing himself upon Major-General Fredericks, whom B----, on the\r\nother side, menaced with a pistol, with the stock of which he felled\r\nhim to the earth; then, turning upon Major Schenshine, commander of\r\nthe brigade, who ran to the assistance of his colleague, he knocked\r\nhim down in a moment, and flinging himself among the grenadiers,\r\nsuccessively wounded Grenadier Krassoffski, Colonel Khavosschinski,\r\nand Subaltern Moussieff; and cutting his way to the flag, seized and\r\nelevated it with a loud and triumphant hurrah. To that cry, and to the\r\nsight of the blood so boldly shed to win the flag, the greater part\r\nof the regiment replied, \"Long live Constantine! down with Nicholas!\"\r\nPrince Stah----, followed by four hundred men whom he had seduced from\r\ntheir duty, then marched, with drums beating, to the Admiralty quarter.\r\n\r\nAt the gate of the winter palace, the aide-de-camp, the bearer of the\r\nnews of the revolt, encountered another officer, who brought tidings\r\nfrom the barracks of the grenadier corps of equally alarming import.\r\nWhen that regiment were preparing to take the oath of fidelity to the\r\nEmperor Nicholas, the sub-lieutenant Kojenikoff threw himself before\r\nthe advanced-guard, exclaiming, \"It is not to the Grand-duke Nicholas\r\nwe ought to make oath, but to the Emperor Constantine.\" He was told\r\nthat the Czarowitz had abdicated in his next brother's favor. \"It is\r\nfalse,\" was his reply; \"totally false; he is on the march for St.\r\nPetersburg to reward the faithful and punish the guilty.\"\r\n\r\nThe regiment, notwithstanding these outcries, continued its march,\r\ntook the oath of allegiance to the new sovereign, and returned into\r\nquarters, without showing any disposition resembling revolt. At\r\ndinner-time Lieutenant Suthoff, who had taken the pledge of obedience\r\nwith the rest, entered at that moment, and addressed himself to his\r\nown company in a manner calculated to excite their attention: \"My\r\nfriends, we were wrong to obey the order; the other regiments are in\r\nopen revolt; they have refused to take the oath, and are at this moment\r\nin the Place of the Senate;--put on your uniforms, arm, come on, and\r\nfollow me; I have your pay in my pocket, which I am ready to distribute\r\nwithout waiting for the ceremony of an order.\"\r\n\r\n\"But is what you say quite true?\" cried many voices.\r\n\r\n\"Stay, here is Lieutenant Panoff,--like myself, one of your best\r\nfriends,--ask him.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friends,\" remarked Panoff, anticipating their question, \"you all\r\nknow that Constantine is your only lawful emperor, and that they wish\r\nto dethrone him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Live Constantine!\" replied the soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"Live Nicholas!\" exclaimed Colonel Sturler, the commander of the\r\nregiment, throwing himself courageously into the hall. \"They are\r\ndeceiving you, my friends; the Czarowitz has really abdicated, and you\r\nhave now no other emperor than the Grand-duke Nicholas. Live Nicholas!\"\r\n\r\n\"Live Constantine!\" responded the soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"You are mistaken, soldiers; you are about to take a fatal step; you\r\nare deceived,\" again shouted the colonel.\r\n\r\n\"Comrades, do not abandon me; follow me,\" cried Panoff; \"let those who\r\nare for Constantine, unite with me in the cry, 'Long live Constantine!'\"\r\n\r\nMore than three parts of those present joined in the cry of \"Long live\r\nConstantine!\"\r\n\r\n\"To the Admiralty! to the Admiralty!\" said Panoff, drawing his sword;\r\n\"follow me, soldiers, follow me.\"\r\n\r\nWith a wild hurrah two hundred soldiers followed their leader to the\r\nplace he indicated, whither, though by a different route, the insurgent\r\nportion of the Regiment of Moscow had already preceded them.\r\n\r\nMilarodowich, the military governor of St. Petersburg, a cavalry\r\ngeneral, whose splendid charges on the field had gained him the\r\nappellation of the Russian Murat, was by this time at the palace, to\r\ncommunicate to his new sovereign the dispositions he had made for the\r\ndefence of his throne and the capital. He had directed the troops upon\r\nwhose fidelity he thought he could rely, to march to the winter palace.\r\nThe first battalion of the regiment Preobrajenski, three regiments of\r\nthe guard Paulowski, and the battalion of the Sapper and Miners, were\r\nthose he considered fit for this important service.\r\n\r\nThe emperor saw then that the mutiny was more general than he\r\nanticipated; he therefore sent by Major-general Meidhart, to carry\r\norders to the Semenowski guard to repress the mutineers, and to the\r\nhorse-guards, to hold themselves in readiness to mount. He went down\r\nhimself to the corps of chief guards of the winter palace, where the\r\nregiment of Finland guards were at that time on duty, and ordered\r\nthem to load their muskets and invest the principal avenues of the\r\npalace. At that very moment tumultuous sounds interrupted the voice\r\nof the sovereign, occasioned by the approach of the third and sixth\r\ncompanies of the Regiment of Moscow, headed by Prince Stah----, and\r\nthe two B----, with the captured flag proudly displayed to the wind,\r\nand drums beating, to the ominous cry of \"Long live Constantine! Down\r\nwith Nicholas!\" The rebel troops debouched on the Admiralty Square,\r\nbut whether they thought themselves not sufficiently strong, or that\r\nthey dreaded facing majesty with these treasonable demonstrations,\r\nthey did not march upon the winter palace, but took up their position\r\nagainst the senate, where they were immediately joined by the grenadier\r\ncorps, and sixty men in frocks with pistols in their hands, who mingled\r\nthemselves among the rebel soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe emperor at this crisis appeared from under one of the arches of\r\nthe palace, approached the grating, and threw a rapid glance on his\r\nrevolted subjects. He was paler than usual, but was composed and calm.\r\nIt was whispered that he had resolved to die as became a Christian\r\nemperor, and that he had confessed and received absolution of the\r\nChurch, before he took leave of his family. Every eye was fixed upon\r\nhim, when the hard gallop of a squadron of cuirassiers was heard on the\r\nside of the marble palace; it was the horse-guards, headed by Count\r\nOrloff, one of the bravest and most faithful friends of the emperor.\r\nBefore him the gates expanded; he leaped from his charger, while\r\nthe regiment ranged itself before the palace. The roll of the drums\r\nannounced instantly the approach of the grenadiers of Preobrajenski,\r\nwhich arrived in battalions. They entered the court of the palace,\r\nwhere they found the emperor with the empress, and their eldest son,\r\nthe little Grand-duke Alexander; behind them were ranged the Chevalier\r\nguard, who formed an angle with the cuirassiers, leaving between them\r\nan open space, which was quickly filled up by the artillery. The\r\nrevolted regiments regarded these military dispositions with apparent\r\ncarelessness, while their cries of \"Long live Constantine!\" \"Down with\r\nNicholas!\" evidently proved that they expected, and waited there for\r\nreinforcements.\r\n\r\nWhile affairs were in this state at the palace, the Grand-duke Michael,\r\nat the barracks, was opposing his personal influence to the flood-tide\r\nof rebellion. Some happy results had followed these attempts, and the\r\nbold resolution taken by Count Lieven, captain of the sixth company\r\nof the Regiment of Moscow, who arrived in time to shut the gates\r\nagainst the battalion, then about to join their rebel comrades. Placing\r\nhimself before the soldiers, he drew his sword, and swore on his\r\nhonor to pass the weapon through the body of the first man who should\r\nmake a seditious movement to re-open them. At this threat, a young\r\nsub-lieutenant advanced, pistol in hand, towards Count Lieven, with the\r\nevident intention of blowing out his brains. The count, with admirable\r\npresence of mind, struck the officer a blow with the pummel of his\r\nsword, which made the instrument leap from his hands; the lieutenant\r\ntook up the pistol and once more took aim at the count. The young\r\nnobleman crossed his arms, and confronted the mutinous officer, while\r\nthe regiment, mute and motionless, looked on like the seconds of this\r\nsingular duel. The lieutenant drew back a few steps, followed by the\r\nheroic count, who offered him his unarmed breast as if in defiance of\r\nhis attempt. The lieutenant fired, but the ball took no effect: that\r\nit did not strike that generous breast appeared miraculous. Some one\r\nknocked at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Who is there?\" asked many voices.\r\n\r\n\"His Imperial Highness the Grand-duke Michael,\" replied those without.\r\n\r\nSome instants of profound silence followed this announcement. Count\r\nLieven availed himself of the general stupefaction to open the door, no\r\nperson attempting to prevent that action.\r\n\r\nThe Grand-duke entered on horseback, followed by the officers of\r\nordnance.\r\n\r\n\"What means this inaction at a moment of danger?\" asked the Grand-duke.\r\n\"Am I among traitors or loyal soldiers?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are in the midst of the most faithful of your regiments,\" replied\r\nthe Count, \"of which your Imperial Highness shall have immediate\r\nproof.\" Then raising his drawn sword, he cried, \"Long live the Emperor\r\nNicholas!\"\r\n\r\n\"Long live the Emperor Nicholas!\" shouted the soldiers with one voice.\r\n\r\nThe young sub-lieutenant attempted to speak, but Count Lieven stopped\r\nhim by touching his arm. \"Silence, sir; I shall not mention what has\r\npassed; and you will ruin yourself by the utterance of a syllable.\"\r\n\r\nHis magnanimity awed and convinced the disloyal officer.\r\n\r\n\"Lieven, I confide to you the conduct of this regiment,\" remarked the\r\nGrand-duke emphatically.\r\n\r\n\"I will answer for its loyalty with my life, your Imperial Highness,\"\r\nreplied the Count.\r\n\r\nThe Grand-duke departed, and on his rounds, if he received no\r\nenthusiastic greeting, at least found what he sought, obedience to the\r\nauthority of the Emperor Nicholas.\r\n\r\nReinforcements came in on every side; the Sappers and Miners drew up in\r\norder of battle, before the palace of the Hermitage; the rest of the\r\nRegiment of Moscow, rescued from the stain of rebellion by the courage\r\nand address of Count Lieven, now proudly debouched by the Perspective\r\nof Niewski. The sight of these troops gave a delusive hope to the\r\nrevolted, who, believing them to be on their side, greeted them with\r\nloud cheers; but they were instantly undeceived, for the new-comers\r\nranged themselves along the Hotel of the Tribunals, facing the palace,\r\nand with the Cuirassiers, Artillery, and Chevalier guards, inclosed the\r\nrevolted in a circle of steel.\r\n\r\nA moment after, they heard the chant of the priests. It was the\r\nPatriarch, who came out of the church of Casan, followed by all his\r\nclergy, and preceded by the holy banners. He now commanded the revolted\r\n\"in the name of heaven, to return to their duty.\" The soldiers, for\r\nthe first time perhaps in their lives, regarded with contempt the\r\npictures which they had been accustomed from infancy to regard with\r\nsuperstitious veneration, and they desired the Patriarch \"to let them\r\nalone, since if heavenly things belonged to the priestly jurisdiction,\r\nthey could take care of those of earth.\" The Patriarch continued his\r\ninjunctions to obedience, notwithstanding this discouraging rebuff,\r\nbut the Emperor ordered him to desist and retire. Nicholas himself was\r\nresolved to make one effort to bring back these rebels to their duty.\r\n\r\nThose who surrounded the Emperor wished to prevent him from risking his\r\nperson, but he boldly replied, \"It is my game that is playing, and it\r\nis but fair play on my part to set my life on the stake.\"\r\n\r\nHe ordered the gate to be opened, but scarcely had he been obeyed,\r\nbefore the Grand-duke Michael approached him, and whispered in his\r\near that that part of the Regiment Preobrajenski by which he was\r\nthen surrounded, had made common cause with the rebels, and that\r\nthe Prince T., their commander, whose absence he had remarked with\r\nastonishment, was at the head of the conspiracy. Nicholas remembered\r\nthat four-and-twenty years before the same regiment had kept guard\r\nbefore the red palace, while its Colonel, Prince Talitzen, strangled\r\nthe Emperor Paul, his father.\r\n\r\nHis situation was terrible, but he did not even change countenance; he\r\nonly showed that he had formed a desperate resolution. In an instant he\r\nturned and gave his orders to one of his generals, \"Bring me hither the\r\nGrand-duke.\"\r\n\r\nThe general returned with the young prince: the Emperor raised the boy\r\nin his arms, and advancing to the grenadiers, said, \"Soldiers, if I am\r\nkilled, behold your sovereign. Open your ranks; I confide him to your\r\nloyalty.\"\r\n\r\nA long, loud hurrah, a cry of enthusiasm that came from the very heart\r\nof these suspected soldiers, reëchoed to that of the Emperor, whose\r\nmagnanimous confidence had won their admiration. The most guilty among\r\nthem dropped their weapons and opened their arms to receive the heir\r\nof the Empire. The imperial pledge was placed with colors in the midst\r\nof the regiment, a guarded and sacred asylum for honor and innocence.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor mounted his horse and went out of the gate, where he was\r\nmet by his generals, who implored him not to go any further, as the\r\nrebels openly avowed their intention of killing their sovereign, and\r\ntheir arms were loaded. The Emperor made a sign to them with his\r\nhand to leave him a free passage, and forbidding them to accompany\r\nhim, spurred his horse and galloped forward till he arrived within\r\npistol-shot. \"Soldiers,\" cried he, \"I am told that you wish to kill me.\r\nIs that true? If it is, here I am!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, while the Emperor sat on horseback, remaining like\r\nan equestrian statue between the two bodies of troops. Twice the word\r\nfire was heard among the rebel ranks, and twice some feeling of respect\r\nto the dauntless courage of the sovereign restrained the execution of\r\nthe order; but at the third command some muskets loaded with ball were\r\ndischarged, which whistled past the Emperor without striking him, but\r\nwounded, at a hundred paces behind him, Colonel Velho and many soldiers.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the Grand-duke Michael and Count Milarodowich galloped\r\ntowards the Emperor, the regiment of cuirassiers and those of the\r\nChevalier guards made a forward movement--the artillerymen were about\r\nto apply their matches to the cannon.\r\n\r\n\"Halt,\" cried the Emperor. All obeyed. \"General,\" said he to Count\r\nMilarodowich, \"go to these unfortunate men and endeavor to bring them\r\nto their allegiance.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count and the Grand-duke Michael rode forward, but the rebels\r\nreceived them with a shower of ball, accompanied by their war-cry,\r\n\"Live Constantine!\"\r\n\r\n\"Soldiers,\" cried the Count, who was conspicuous alike by his fine\r\nmartial figure and splendid uniform covered with orders; \"soldiers,\r\nbehold this sabre,\" and he flourished above his head a magnificent\r\nTurkish one, the hilt of which was set with jewels, and advancing with\r\nit to the front ranks of the rebels, he continued, \"This sabre was\r\ngiven me by his Imperial Highness the Czarowitz, and on my honor, I\r\nwill make oath upon its blade, that you have been deceived, that the\r\nCzarowitz has abdicated the imperial crown, and that your real and\r\nlegitimate sovereign is the Emperor Nicholas.\"\r\n\r\nCries of \"Live Constantine!\" and the report of a pistol were the\r\nreplies given by the revolted to the address of the Count, whose action\r\nwith the sword arm had left his side exposed to the enemy. He was seen\r\nto reel in the saddle. Another pistol was aimed at the Grand-duke\r\nMichael, but the soldiers of the Marine, though included in the revolt,\r\nseized the arm of the assassin.\r\n\r\nCount Orloff and the cuirassiers faced the heavy fire of the musketry,\r\nand enveloped in their ranks the wounded Milarodowich, the Grand-duke\r\nMichael and the Emperor Nicholas, whom they carried off by force to the\r\npalace.\r\n\r\nThe Count, wounded to death, sat his horse with difficulty, and the\r\nmoment he arrived at the palace, fell into the arms of those who\r\nsurrounded him.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, notwithstanding the late unfortunate attempt, still wished\r\nto make one last endeavor to bring back the revolted, but while he\r\nwas issuing orders to that effect, the Grand-duke Michael seized the\r\nmatch: \"Fire,\" cried he, \"fire upon the assassins.\" At that moment four\r\ncannons opened upon the rebels, and paid with usury the deaths they\r\nhad sent into the loyal ranks of the imperialists. Before the voice\r\nof the Emperor could stop the slaughter, a second discharge followed\r\nthe first. The effect of these volleys within reach of pistol-shot was\r\nterrible. More than sixty men of the grenadier corps of the Regiment\r\nof Moscow and the Marine guards fell; the rebel troops fled, some by\r\nthe street Galernain, some by the English quay or by the bridge Isaac,\r\nothers across the frozen waters of the Neva, then a plain of ice, but\r\nall were hotly pursued by the Chevalier guards at full gallop.\r\n\r\nThat evening Count Milarodowich, who was struggling with the agonies\r\nof death, expressed a wish to see the bullet which had given him his\r\nmortal wound. The chirurgeon, who had successfully traced and extracted\r\nthe ball, put it into his patient's hand. The expiring warrior\r\ncarefully examined the missive, its weight, and form, and found it\r\ndeficient in calibre. \"I am satisfied,\" said he, \"that ball was aimed\r\nby no soldier.\" Five minutes after these words, he breathed his last.\r\nHe then paid the debt of nature, the only debt he ever paid in his\r\nlife. Handsome, valiant, the finest horseman in the army, and the idol\r\nof his own soldiers, the Russian Murat lost his life by the hand of\r\na Russian, but not of a Russian soldier. The rival of the _cidevant_\r\nKing of Naples loved display in every shape; but the field of battle,\r\nat the head of his cavalry, was the theatre on which he best loved to\r\nexhibit his martial form, splendid horsemanship, and daring courage.\r\nThe gaming-table found him as reckless of his fortune as the field\r\nof his life, and the bravest cavalry general in the Russian service\r\nwas a ruined gamester, loaded with debts which his death acquitted by\r\nleaving him insolvent. In paying the debt of nature Count Milarodowich\r\nsurrendered his only personal possession.\r\n\r\nThe next day, at nine o'clock in the morning, while the population of\r\nhis capital was yet uncertain whether the rebellion was effectually\r\ncrushed, Nicholas, Emperor of Russia, gave his hand to the Empress\r\nto assist her into a droski which stood before the gates of the\r\nwinter-palace, and drove through the streets of St. Petersburg. He\r\nstopped before the barracks as if to offer his bold bosom to the\r\nbullet or the steel of the assassin. The sight of his fine countenance,\r\nshadowed by the floating plumes of his military hat, far from exciting\r\ntreasonable demonstrations, awakened lively expressions of loyalty and\r\ndevotion to his person, and cries of \"Long live Nicholas!\" greeted his\r\nfortunate rashness. The Russian people knew and recognized in him a\r\nbrave man and great sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe trial of the chief conspirators took place under the shadow of\r\nnight and secrecy; they were brought from all parts of the empire to\r\nSt. Petersburg. The sentence, but not the examination of the guilty,\r\nalone was made public; eighty persons were condemned to death, or\r\nlife-long exile in Siberia. The most powerful, according to the custom\r\nof Russia, increased the population of Siberia; among these we find\r\nthe name of Prince T.: his wife, with rare devotion, petitioned and\r\nobtained from the Emperor permission to accompany her husband to that\r\ndreary land of woe and crime. The decimation of the disloyal but\r\nseduced regiments was an act of severe military justice that astonished\r\nEurope, but secured the tranquillity of Russia. The son of the Emperor\r\nPaul, whose life and death had been the stake of the military contest\r\nof December, 1825, might be better excused than any other man for that\r\ntremendous sentence. He had been fired upon by his own soldiers while\r\nunarmed and confiding his person to their generosity; his brother,\r\nand his plenipotentiary, Count Milarodowich, had been aimed at by\r\nassassins, and the Count had died of his wound.\r\n\r\nA flash of magnanimity enlightened this cloud of severity. In the list\r\nof conspirators the Emperor remarked the name of Suwarrow, a name\r\ndear to Russia and associated with her victories. He chose to examine\r\nthis young man, the grandson of the great field-marshal, himself.\r\nHis countenance and manner, unusually gentle, seemed to inspire\r\nconfidence. The questions he asked this lieutenant only required a\r\nsimple affirmative or denial, and they were not of a nature to elicit\r\na confession of guilt. \"Gentlemen, you see and hear,\" remarked the\r\nEmperor to his council, \"it is as I have told you, a Suwarrow cannot\r\nbe a rebel,\" and he acquitted the prisoner, and gave him a captain's\r\ncommission and sent him back to his regiment; but unfortunately for the\r\nconspirators, this lieutenant was the only person who bore that favored\r\nname. All were not Suwarrows.\r\n\r\nIt was remarked that those who were executed uttered these words\r\nas their last legacy to posterity, \"Live Russia! Live Liberty! our\r\navengers are at hand!\" Their war-cry of \"Live Constantine!\" false to\r\ntheir hearts, was not repeated by lips which the presence of death had\r\nrendered then the echo of truth.\r\n\r\nThe funeral pomp of the widowed Empress Elizabeth, whose remains were\r\nbrought for interment to St. Petersburg in this same month of December,\r\nturned the thoughts of its inhabitants from these scenes of civil\r\nstrife and the executions that followed them, to a Princess, whom for\r\ntwenty-four years they had regarded as a link between the human and\r\nangelic natures. The memory of these events seemed buried in that\r\nsepulchre, which the tears of a grateful people had consecrated to the\r\nremembrance of the consort of the deceased Emperor Alexander.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                From Nimrod's Bacchanalia Memorabilia.\r\n\r\nDRINKING EXPERIENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pleasure imparted by wine to me is great, but very short-lived:\r\nit appears to mount, as it were, to a crisis; after which it somewhat\r\nrapidly declines. In fact, it does not enliven me beyond a certain\r\npitch. It then ceases its charms; doubtless, because my stomach, the\r\ncentre of all sympathy, feels oppressed by it. I grow dull, my head\r\naches, I am inclined for sleep, and wish for bed.--But it does not\r\nrob me of self-possession, nor incline me to wrangle or quarrel. On\r\nthe contrary, it excites my love, not my hatred, and greatly expands\r\nmy heart. I have granted many a favor, and promised many more, by the\r\ninspiration of the jolly god. I have shaken hands with, sworn eternal\r\nfriendship for, many a man, and made love to many a woman, for whom,\r\nvulgarly speaking, I cared not a rush. In short, I have a hundred times\r\nmade a fool of myself by talking, boasting--not lying, for I have ever\r\nheld that low vice in abhorrence--and occasionally laid wagers, and\r\nmatched horses, without a chance of winning. But, as I have already\r\nstated, I never was so overcome by wine as not to know where I was, and\r\nwhat I said. In fact, it never had the power to make me forget that I\r\nwas born a gentleman; and I am happy in the reflection, that I have\r\ntravelled thus far through life without having been once called upon to\r\nmake an apology for an insult given, either when drunk or sober; nor to\r\ndemand but two, and those were the result of excess in wine. One was\r\ntendered to me on the first dawn of returning reason; the other, I am\r\nsorry to say, at the pistol's mouth. But the events I am alluding to\r\noccurred many years back, when, as a well-known sporting old earl of\r\nthe last century said of himself, \"the devil was very strong in me.\"\r\n\r\nI never was drunk, from drinking spirits, more than twice, which was\r\nwith very strong brandy and water. Now he that praises drunkenness\r\nis a sot convicted on his own evidence; but were I to drink for what\r\nis called drinking's sake--that is, to acquire an artificial state\r\nof pleasurable excitement--brandy should be the liquor I should fly\r\nto to secure it. The \"divine luxuries of opium\" I never yet tasted;\r\nbut the powers of wine upon me are, comparatively with brandy, truly\r\ninsignificant. At the period I am alluding to, it not only appeared\r\nto afford me a sure panacea for all evils, past, present, and to\r\ncome, but to open unlimited prospects of future bliss. I felt as if I\r\nwere possessed of more than human powers, and that there was nothing\r\nI willed I could not do. In short, it eventually made me mad; and,\r\non each occasion, I nearly lost my life, together with my senses.\r\nOn the one, I attempted to go to sea, by moonlight, in a small open\r\nboat, without either rudder or sail, and in the current of a strong\r\ntide running out of a Welsh bay; on the other, although more than two\r\nhundred miles distant from it, I got upon a coachbox to go to London,\r\nin my evening dress; and did \"go,\" till I tumbled off it into the road.\r\nTo the latter excursion I was no doubt indebted to my early propensity\r\nto driving coaches; but having at no time of my life had a fancy for\r\nthe sea, I owed my intended aquatic trip to a member of the yacht club,\r\nwho was my partner in the debauch. Death, says Johnson, is more than\r\nusually unwelcome to a rich man; and as my friend is possessed of ten\r\nthousand a year, he was by no means a fit subject to be mangled by\r\nWelsh crabs. Had we, however, accomplished our purpose in unmooring the\r\nboat, we should never have been heard of in this world any more. The\r\nday would have come upon us both \"unawares.\"\r\n\r\nTo return to wine. The effect of wine is generally supposed to\r\ninvigorate the understanding, and to stimulate the mental powers--of\r\npoets, especially. Thus Horace asks Bacchus whither he is about to\r\ntransport him? But by the words \"_tui plenum_,\" I think he must have\r\nmeant full, not of his wine, but of his divinity, without the aid\r\nof which he felt himself unequal to pen a panegyric upon Octavius.\r\nNow, were I to say that it is in the power of wine to sink me below\r\nmortality--in other words, to make a brute of me--I should certainly\r\ngo beyond my tether; but I can safely assert that, if I were a\r\npoet, so far from realizing Horace's expectations of it, it would\r\nlead me _down_, not up, the hill. In fact, when under its immediate\r\ninfluence--I do not mean drunk, but \"pretty considerably sprung,\" as\r\nthe term is--I can scarcely indite a common letter. It appears to\r\nstultify my ordinary capacities. I must, however, admit that, on the\r\nfirst waking after a plentiful allowance of good wine, some bright\r\nthoughts have come across my mind, and, when not lost by an intervening\r\nnap, have been found worthy of being noted down, and now and then made\r\nserviceable. It would indeed be an act of ingratitude to the jolly god,\r\nwere I to omit the fact, that I once did rise from my bed, at four\r\no'clock in the morning, after having sacrificed largely the overnight,\r\nand wrote the best thing I ever did write; at least, so said a certain\r\nlearned sergeant, who now wears a silk gown, and who told me he would\r\nhave given five hundred pounds to have been the author of it. But it\r\nnever saw the light. It was a satire; and \"_Nulla venenato litera mixta\r\njoco est_,\" has ever been, and shall ever continue to be, my motto. I\r\nwish not to dip my pen in gall.\r\n\r\nI have found wine, taken to excess for only a few days, to depress\r\nthe mind more than the body; that is to say, when, as a friend of\r\nmine expresses himself, \"the _animus_ is flown;\" and I once heard\r\nthis natural effect of over-mental excitement admirably illustrated\r\nby a very illiterate coachman of the old school. \"Was Jem drunk when\r\nhe upset his coach the other night?\" was a question I put to one of\r\nthis fraternity some years back, when drinking to excess with them was\r\nthe order of both day and night. \"Why, sir,\" he replied, \"he warn't\r\ndrunk, nor he warn't sober; _the liquor was a-dying in him, and he was\r\nstupid_.\" Now, this strongly resembles my own case. Had I to write\r\nfor a prize, and that prize were immortality, I would not depend much\r\nupon the assistance of Bacchus. I would rather rely on my own natural\r\npowers, gently stimulated by wine when they flagged.\r\n\r\nIn all ages of the world, however, clever men, and poets especially,\r\nhave been more or less addicted to drinking to excess. The austere\r\nCato, the voluptuous Cæsar, were each given to what Seneca calls the\r\n_intemperantia bibendi_--notwithstanding which, according to Seneca,\r\nthe wisdom of the former received no blemish from this cause. His\r\ndaughter, indeed, admitted that it softened the rigor of her father's\r\nvirtues. Titus, the delight of human kind, sat late after his dinner:\r\nhis brother, Domitian, the tyrant and fly-tormentor, never later than\r\nthe setting sun. The influence of wine upon poets has long since been\r\nproverbial. Poetry, in fact, has been called the wine of the mind;\r\nand wine, like love, makes poets. The old Greeks drank and sang; and\r\nAnacreon would not have been Anacreon, but for the inspiring juice\r\nof the grape, as he himself tells us in his celebrated hymn to the\r\nfull-blown rose--\r\n\r\n    \"Crown me, and instant, god of wine,\r\n    Strains from my lyre shall reach thy shrine.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, the first prize contended for by poets was a cask of wine;\r\nand the Bacchic hymn was called \"The Hymn of the Cask.\" Horace, in\r\nfact, pronounces a water-drinking poet to be little worth--even the\r\nsprings of Castalia will not avail; but after his bottle of Falernian,\r\nhe boldly asserts, in his ode to Bacchus, in which he wishes to soap\r\nCæsar, that no daring was then too great for his muse.\r\n\r\nBoth Homer and Horace must have liked wine, and experience on occasions\r\nits good effects, or they would not have been the authors of such\r\nglowing panegyrics upon it. It is true the latter is moral in the\r\nmidst of his gayety, uniting the wisdom of the philosopher with the\r\nplayfulness of the poet; still, and notwithstanding he preaches up\r\nmoderation in desires, as the chief source of human happiness, he\r\nmust have been _secretly_ attached to the Epicurean school, in our\r\nacceptation of that term. We may, I think, glean this from various\r\npassages of his several works, and especially from the compliment he\r\npays Tibullus on the knowledge he displays of the _savoir vivre_ at his\r\nown house and table. Again, although in his ode to Apollo he wished\r\nus to believe he did not like it, the one to his Cask is an incentive\r\nto _drinking_. In another to Telephus, he himself gets \"as drunk as\r\na lord;\" and had a pretty good bousing match on his escape from the\r\ntree, as well as at his party on Cæsar's birth-day. Then how does he\r\npromise to welcome Macænas when he came to sup with him? _To take a\r\nhundred bumpers with him for friendship's sake!_ Neither is this all.\r\nNotwithstanding his telling his friend that his wine was not such as\r\n_he_ ought to drink, it is evident he did not \"think small beer of it\"\r\nhimself. He notes its age, seals the casks with his own hands, and taps\r\na fresh one on any very memorable occasion. In short, but for a bodily\r\ninfirmity to which he was subject, there is little doubt but he would\r\nhave been one of the jolly dogs of his own day. At all events, as has\r\nbeen elegantly said of him, \"he tuned his harp to pleasure, and to easy\r\ntemper of his own soul.\"\r\n\r\nHow happens it, it may be asked, that not a single Grecian has ascended\r\nParnassus for so many ages back, and that the vocal hills of Arcadia\r\nno longer resound to the Doric reed? There are, we know, several\r\nreasons given for this, such as a despotic government, alteration in\r\nthe language, &c., &c.; but the most powerful cause of the literary\r\ndegeneracy of this once justly celebrated people is, doubtless, in the\r\nsubstitution of the enervating luxuries of coffee, tobacco, and opium,\r\nfor the invigorating powers of good wine. It was not so in Anacreon's\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to the eminently gifted men of later times. Sir Richard\r\nSteele spent half his hours in a tavern. In fact, he may be said to\r\nhave measured time by the bottle; as on being sent for by his wife,\r\nhe returned for answer that \"he would be with her in half a bottle.\"\r\nThe like may be said of Savage; and Addison was as dull as an alderman\r\ntill he was three parts drunk. Neither would he stop at that point.\r\nIt is on record of him that he once drank till he vomited in the\r\ncompany of Voltaire; which called forth the cutting remark, that the\r\nonly good thing that came out of his mouth, in Voltaire's presence,\r\nwas the wine that had gone into it. It is also recorded of Pitt, but\r\nI cannot vouch for the truth of it, that two bottles of port wine per\r\ndiem was his usual allowance, and that it was to _potens Bacchus_ he\r\nwas indebted for the almost superhuman labor he went through during\r\nhis short, but actively employed life. His friend and colleague, Harry\r\nDundas, a clever man also in his way, went the pace with him over the\r\nmahogany; and the joke about the Speaker in his chair, after they had\r\ndined together, cannot be forgotten. Pitt could see no Speaker; but\r\nhis friend, like Horace with the candle, saw two. Sheridan, latterly,\r\nwithout wine, was a driveller. He sacrificed to it talents such as no\r\nman I ever heard or read of possessed, for no subject appeared to be\r\nbeyond his reach. I knew him when I was a boy, and thought him then\r\nsomething more than human. The learned Porson would get drunk in a\r\npothouse--so would Robert Burns, the poet; and Byron drank brandy and\r\nwater by bucketsful. Fox was a thirsty soul, and drank far too much\r\nwine for either a politician or a play-man; yet, like Nestor over\r\nthe bowl, he was always great. But a contemporary of his, likewise a\r\ngreat play-man and a clever fellow, out-heroded Herod. He estimated\r\nhis losses in hogsheads of claret; and it was humorously said of John\r\nTaylor--for such was his name--that, after a certain hour of the night,\r\n\"he could not be removed _without a permit_, as he had more than a\r\ndozen of claret on board.\" Two of the finest actors that ever graced\r\nthe British stage could scarcely be kept sober enough to perform their\r\nparts: But enough of this. Wine taken in excess is the bane of talent.\r\nLike fire upon incense, it may cause rich fumes to escape; but the\r\ndregs and refuse, when the sacrifice is ended, are little worth. By a\r\nlong continuance, indeed, in any vicious indulgence, the mind, like\r\nthe body, is reduced to a state of atrophy; and knowledge, like food,\r\npasses through it without adding to its strength. But repeated vinous\r\nintoxication soonest unfits a man for either mental or bodily exertion.\r\nEqually with the effect of violent love, so powerfully set forth by the\r\npoet Lucretius, it creates an indolence and listlessness which damps\r\nall noble pursuits, as well as a neglect of all useful affairs--\r\n\r\n    \"Labitur interea res et vadimonia fiunt;\r\n    Languent officia, atque ægrotat fama vacillans.\"\r\n\r\nThere are countries--half civilised ones, of course--in which\r\nintoxication is esteemed the greatest of human pleasures; and\r\nLord Bacon thought it only second to love. Much of the folly of\r\ndrunkenness, however, in the middle and upper orders of society,\r\nproceeds from a laudable desire to exercise in the extreme the rites\r\nof hospitality. To the \"honest pride of hospitality,\" as Byron calls\r\nit, many a man who hates drinking, has given many a slice of his\r\nperhaps already shaken constitution. And here is really something\r\nlike an excuse. Independently of the making welcome our friends, and\r\nseeing ourselves surrounded by them under our own roof, being one of\r\nthe first among the ordinary comforts of life, hospitality has ever\r\nbeen considered a primary social duty. The best definition of real\r\nhospitality is given by Cicero, who admits that there is nothing that\r\ncontributes more effectually to the happiness of human life than\r\nsociety,--distinguishing from the sensual gratification of the palate,\r\nthe pleasing relaxation of the mind, which he says is best produced\r\nby the freedom of social converse, always most agreeable at the table.\r\nNeither does he appear to be an enemy to a cheerful glass; and we must\r\nadmire the definition he gives of drinking parties. \"The Greeks,\" says\r\nhe, \"call them by a word which signifies computations, whereas we more\r\nemphatically denominate them convivial meetings; intimating thereby,\r\nthat it is in a communication of this nature that life is most truly\r\nenjoyed.\" That Cicero, however, was temperate, may be concluded by the\r\nfact of his having written when past his sixtieth year his celebrated\r\nPhilippies, in which his powers of reasoning are more vigorous, and his\r\nlanguage more touching, than in any of his former and younger orations.\r\nHe used wine in moderation; and it is thus that it answers the ends of\r\nProvidence. It then exhilarates and strengthens the mind, as well as\r\nthe body, and, like the bloom on the female cheek, beautifies it, and\r\nshows health.\r\n\r\nThere are said to be three modes of bearing the ills of life,\r\nindifference, philosophy, and religion; and many add--the bottle. But\r\nthe effect of wine on grief is of a doubtful nature. It may deaden\r\nthe pang for a while, but it will return on the morrow with redoubled\r\nforce, and with the powers of the sufferer less equal to contend with\r\nit. Nevertheless, the maxim of Anacreon, that \"when Bacchus enters our\r\ncares sleep,\" is in part true; and a temporary oblivion of care and\r\ndisappointment is generally produced by an agreeable party and good\r\ncheer. And thus is Shakespeare justified in calling wine the merry\r\ncheerer of the human heart, as well as others who have asserted that it\r\nnot only creates pleasure, but mitigates pain. For the latter purpose,\r\nindeed, it was formerly given to condemned malefactors, previously to\r\ntheir suffering; \"Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish,\"\r\nsays the author of the book of Proverbs, \"and wine unto them that be of\r\nheavy hearts. _Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his\r\nmisery no more._\"\r\n\r\nIf a tranquil mind and freedom from pain make up the sum of a happy\r\nlife, how great is the value of this cordial drop, and how thankful\r\nshould we be for it! How sacred and profane writers agree in the\r\nessential qualities of the pure juice, especially in the relief of\r\nwretchedness. \"See the blind beggar dance, the cripple sing,\" is no\r\nexaggeration of its power in lessening anguish from past misfortunes,\r\nor present ills; but in the following translation of a fragment of\r\nBacchylides, we see what rays of brightness it can throw over our\r\nfuture prospects:\r\n\r\n    \"Thirsty comrade! would'st thou know\r\n    All the raptures that do flow\r\n    From those sweet compulsive rules\r\n    Of our ancient drinking schools?\r\n    First, the precious draught shall raise\r\n    Amorous thoughts in giddy maze,\r\n    Mingling Bacchus' present treasure\r\n    With the hopes of higher pleasure.\r\n    Next, shall chase through empty air\r\n    All th' intolerant hosts of care;\r\n    Give thee conquest, riches, power;\r\n    Bid thee scale the guarded tower;\r\n    Bid thee reign o'er land and sea\r\n    With unquestioned sov'reignty.\r\n    Thou thy palace shall behold,\r\n    Bright with ivory and gold;\r\n    While each ship that ploughs the main,\r\n    Filled with Egypt's choicest grain,\r\n    Shall unload her ponderous store,\r\n    Thirsty comrade, at thy door.\"\r\n\r\nYet guided by my own experience, of the various effects of wine on the\r\nmind, I cannot go quite the length of some of its panegyrists. So far,\r\nindeed, from thinking with Ovid that it takes even the wrinkles out of\r\nthe face, I am more inclined to believe that it adds to their number by\r\nthe excitement that it creates; and although the festive pleasures of\r\nthe table, in addition to the society of friends, may cheer the heart,\r\nand even irradiate gloom, the talisman is not there by which the cause\r\nmay be reached, and the pain destroyed, beyond the hour.\r\n\r\n    \"Though gay companions o'er the bowl\r\n      Dispel awhile the sense of ill;\r\n    Though pleasure fires the madd'ning soul,\r\n      The heart--the heart is lonely still.\"\r\n\r\nNo--although I fear I am about to speak without experience now--it is\r\nmy opinion, that neither the resources of the philosopher, nor the\r\nconsolations of religion, nor conscious worth, unaccompanied by native\r\nfortitude and energy of mind, are of much avail against real grief. Why\r\nthey should not be, is no business of mine to inquire; nor would it be\r\nbecoming me to question the designs of Providence. But this much I may\r\naffirm without fear of offence,--Human life is prudently chequered with\r\ngood and evil; and the most likely way to enjoy it, is to make the best\r\nof the one while the other is away.\r\n\r\nThe powerful influence of wine on society is estimated by Dr. Johnson,\r\nin the _Rambler_: \"In the bottle,\" says he, \"discontent seeks for\r\ncomfort, cowardice for courage, and bashfulness for confidence.\"\r\nNothing is more true than this; although it sometimes happens that the\r\nfirst is looked for in vain, the second proves false, and the latter\r\nexceeds its bounds. The union of sensual and intellectual enjoyment,\r\nhowever, is requisite to complete the happiness of \"the double\r\nanimal\"--the perfect man; and as all mankind are not philosophers,\r\nmuch less abstract ones, after-dinner conversation would generally\r\nbe flat without the genial influence of good wine. Indeed, the wit\r\nof the wittiest man, and the most agreeable companion I ever sat\r\ndown with, appeared to rise in brilliancy with every glass he drank;\r\nand when, to use an expression of his own, he felt himself \"vinously\r\ninclined,\"--that is to say, when he had what Cicero calls the \"_furor\r\nvinolentus_\" upon him, there were no bounds to his humorous sallies.\r\n\r\nUpon old men wine is generally well bestowed.\r\n\r\n    \"----Give me a bowl of wine;\r\n    I have not that alacrity of spirit\r\n    Nor cheer of mind that I was wont to have,\"\r\n\r\nexclaims the bold King Richard; and I once heard a fine old sportsman,\r\nand very worthy man, declare, after a bottle of good port, that he\r\nwould not exchange the present--his eightieth year--for the gayest he\r\nhad ever spent.\r\n\r\nLuckily for the credit of the human race--although Cleopatra hunted\r\nand _drank_ with Antony--there has been, in all ages of the world, a\r\nsense of shame attached to the vice of drunkenness in women, having any\r\npretensions to character, as something contrary to their more refined\r\nnature. By the ancient Roman laws it was punishable even by death; and\r\nwe find that even the abandoned women who celebrated the Bacchanalia\r\nwere ashamed to do so, except under the disguise of masks.\r\n\r\nTo the credit of the present age, drunkenness in women is not a\r\ncommon failing; but when they once yield to the vice, they have less\r\nmoderation in the indulgence of it than men have. That such was the\r\ncase in other ages and countries, may be gleaned from a passage in\r\na comic play-writer, contemporary with Plato, which has been thus\r\naccurately rendered:\r\n\r\n    \"Remark how wisely ancient art provides,\r\n    The broad-brimmed cup, with flat expanded sides;\r\n    A cup contrived for _man's_ discreeter use,\r\n    And sober potions of the generous juice.\r\n    But _woman's_ more ambitious, thirsty soul\r\n    Soon long'd to revel in the plenteous bowl;\r\n    Deep and capacious as the swelling hold\r\n    Of some stout bark, she shaped the hollow mould;\r\n    Then, turning out a vessel like a tun,\r\n    Simpering, exclaimed--_Observe, I drink but one_.\"\r\n\r\nTo return to the effect of wine on the ruder sex. Next to a smoky\r\nhouse and a scolding wife, it is the greatest trial of the temper\r\nto which that of man is exposed. In fact, it is a test by which it\r\nmay be proved; and the advice of Horace is excellent, _not to choose\r\na friend till we have put him to this test_. Addison is likewise\r\nhappy in his remark on this point. \"Wine,\" says he, \"is not to be\r\ndrunk by all who can swallow;\" and truer words were never written.\r\nIt has an extraordinary effect upon low and uncultivated minds; as\r\nwas exemplified in late times, when war prices and abundance of money\r\nplaced it within the reach of the English commonalty. Rows and broils,\r\nwith marked insolence towards superiors, were the concomitant results.\r\nNeither is the observation of Pliny a whit less just. He says truth\r\nis vulgarly and _properly_ attributed to wine; and I am decidedly of\r\nhis opinion. In fact, our English term, \"disguised in liquor,\" is\r\nimproperly used; inasmuch as a blackguard when drunk is in his nature a\r\nblackguard when sober. The tongue, says the Bible, is at all times an\r\nunruly member; but when under the influence of wine, it is still more\r\napt to run riot. Then, again, drunken men are given to \"err in vision\r\nand stumble in judgment,\" and to put constructions upon words which\r\nthey were not intended to convey. When we sacrifice to Bacchus, we are\r\nnot favored by Mercury; and the well-known adage of \"wine in, wit out,\"\r\nis but an abbreviation of the equally well proved axiom, that wine\r\nraises the imagination, but depresses the judgment.\r\n\r\nNeither is the highly bred gentleman, if much addicted to intoxication,\r\nquite safe to be admitted into close friendship, inasmuch as he renders\r\nhimself, by the practice, unworthy of confidence. Wine so unlocks the\r\ncabinet of the heart, that it is easily looked into when we are off our\r\nguard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        From an article in the \"Home Book of the Picturesque,\"\r\n                    just published by G. P. Putnam.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN AND EUROPEAN SCENERY COMPARED.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY J. FENIMORE COOPER.\r\n\r\nThe great distinction between American and European scenery, as a\r\nwhole, is to be found in the greater want of finish in the former than\r\nin the latter, and to the greater superfluity of works of art in the\r\nold world than in the new. Nature has certainly made some differences,\r\nthough there are large portions of continental Europe that, without\r\ntheir artificial accessories, might well pass for districts in our\r\nown region; and which forcibly remind the traveller of his native\r\nhome. As a whole, it must be admitted that Europe offers to the senses\r\nsublimer views and certainly grander, than are to be found within our\r\nown borders, unless we resort to the Rocky Mountains, and the ranges in\r\nCalifornia and New Mexico.\r\n\r\nIn musing on these subjects, the mind of the untravelled American\r\nnaturally turns first towards England. He has pictured to himself\r\nlandscapes and scenery on which are impressed the teeming history of\r\nthe past. We shall endeavour to point out the leading distinctions\r\nbetween the scenery of England and that of America, therefore, as the\r\ncourse that will probably be most acceptable to the reader.\r\n\r\nThe prevalent characteristic of the English landscape is its air of\r\nsnugness and comfort. In these respects it differs entirely from its\r\nneighbor, France. The English, no doubt, have a great deal of poverty\r\nand squalid misery among them. But it is kept surprisingly out of the\r\nordinary view. Most of it, indeed, is to be found in the towns, and\r\neven in them it is concealed in out of the way places and streets\r\nseldom entered by the stranger.\r\n\r\nThere are places in America, more especially in the vicinities of\r\nthe large towns, that have a strong resemblance to the more crowded\r\nportions of England, though the hedge is usually wanting and the stone\r\nwall is more in favor among ourselves than it appears ever to have been\r\namong our ancestors. The great abundance of wood, in this country,\r\ntoo, gives us the rail and the board for our fences, objects which the\r\nlovers of the picturesque would gladly see supplanted by the brier and\r\nthe thorn. All that part of Staten Island, which lies nearest to the\r\nquarantine ground, has a marked resemblance to what we should term\r\nsuburban English landscape. The neighborhoods of most of the old towns\r\nin the northern States, have more or less of the same character; it\r\nbeing natural that the descendants of Englishmen should have preserved\r\nas many of the usages of their forefathers as were practicable. We\r\nknow of no portion of this country that bears any marked resemblance\r\nto the prevalent characteristics of an ordinary French landscape. In\r\nFrance there are two great distinctive features that seem to divide the\r\nmaterials of the views between them. One is that of a bald nakedness\r\nof formal _grandes routes_, systematically lined with trees, a total\r\nabsence of farm-houses, fences, hedges, and walls, little or no forest,\r\nexcept in particular places, scarcely any pieces of detached woods, and\r\na husbandry that is remarkable for its stiffness and formality. The\r\nfields of a French acclivity, when the grain is ripe, or ripening, have\r\na strong resemblance to an ordinary Manchester pattern-card, in which\r\nthe different cloths, varying in color, are placed under the eye at one\r\nglance. The effect of this is not pleasing. The lines being straight\r\nand the fields exhibiting none of the freedom of nature. Stiffness\r\nand formality, indeed, impair the beauty of nine-tenths of the French\r\nlandscapes; though as a whole the country is considered fine, and is\r\ncertainly very productive. The other distinctive feature to which we\r\nallude is of a directly contrary character, being remarkable for the\r\naffluence of its objects. It often occurs in that country that the\r\ntraveller finds himself on a height that commands a view of great\r\nextent, which is literally covered with _bourgs_ or small towns and\r\nvillages. This occurs particularly in Normandy, in the vicinity of\r\nParis and as one approaches the Loire. In such places it is no unusual\r\nthing for the eye to embrace, as it might be in a single view, some\r\nforty or fifty cold, grave-looking, chiselled _bourgs_ and villages,\r\nalmost invariably erected in stone. The effect is not unpleasant,\r\nfor the subdued color of the buildings has a tendency to soften the\r\nlandscape and to render the whole solemn and imposing. We can recall\r\nmany of these scenes that have left indelible impressions on the mind,\r\nand which, if not positively beautiful in a rural sense, are very\r\nremarkable. That from the heights of Montmorenci, near Paris, is one of\r\nthem; and there is another, from the hill of St. Catharine, near Rouen,\r\nthat is quite as extraordinary.\r\n\r\nThe greater natural freedom that exists in an ordinary American\r\nlandscape, and the abundance of detached fragments of wood, often\r\nrender the views of this country strikingly beautiful when they are of\r\nsufficient extent to conceal the want of finish in the details, which\r\nrequire time and long-continued labor to accomplish. In this particular\r\nwe conceive that the older portions of the United States offer to the\r\neye a general outline of view that may well claim to be even of a\r\nhigher cast, than most of the scenery of the old world.\r\n\r\nThere is one great charm, however, that it must be confessed is nearly\r\nwanting among us. We allude to the coast. Our own is, with scarcely\r\nan exception, low, monotonous and tame. It wants Alpine rocks, bold\r\npromontories, visible heights inland, and all those other glorious\r\naccessories of the sort that render the coast of the Mediterranean the\r\nwonder of the world. It is usual for the American to dilate on the size\r\nof his bays and rivers, but objects like these require corresponding\r\nelevation in the land. Admirable as is the bay of New-York for the\r\npurposes of commerce, it holds but a very subordinate place as a\r\nlandscape among the other havens of the world. The comparison with\r\nNaples that has so often been made, is singularly unjust, there not\r\nbeing two bays of any extent to be found, that are really less alike\r\nthan these. It was never our good fortune to see Constantinople or Rio\r\nde Janeiro, the two noblest and most remarkable scenes of this kind,\r\nas we have understood, known to the traveller. But we much question\r\nif either will endure the test of rigid and severe examination better\r\nthan the celebrated Gulf of Napoli. The color of the water, alone, is\r\na peculiar beauty of all the Mediterranean bays: it is the blue of\r\nthe deep sea, carried home to the very rocks of the coast. In this\r\nrespect, the shores of America, also, have less claim to beauty than\r\nthose of Europe, generally. The waters are green, the certain sign of\r\ntheir being shallow. Similar tints prevail in the narrow seas between\r\nHolland and England. The name of Holland recalls a land, however, that\r\nis even lower than any portion of our own with which we are acquainted.\r\nThere are large districts in Holland that are actually below the level\r\nof the high tides of the sea. This country is a proof how much time,\r\ncivilization, and persevering industry, may add even to the interest\r\nof a landscape. While the tameness of the American coast has so little\r\nto relieve it or to give it character, in Holland it becomes the\r\nsource of wonder and admiration. The sight of vast meadows, villages,\r\nfarm-houses, churches, and other works of art, actually lying below the\r\nlevel of the adjacent canals, and the neighboring seas, wakes in the\r\nmind a species of reverence for human industry. This feeling becomes\r\nblended with the views, and it is scarcely possible to gaze upon a\r\nDutch landscape without seeing, at the same time, ample pages from\r\nthe history of the country and the character of its people. On this\r\nside of the ocean, there are no such peculiarities. Time, numbers, and\r\nlabor, are yet wanting to supply the defects of nature, and we must be\r\ncontent, for a while, with the less teeming pictures drawn in our youth\r\nand comparative simplicity.\r\n\r\nOn the American coast the prevailing character is less marked at the\r\nnorthward and eastward than at the southward. At some future day, the\r\nEverglades of Florida may have a certain resemblance to Holland. They\r\nare the lowest land, we believe, in any part of this country.\r\n\r\nTaking into the account the climate and its productions, the adjacent\r\nmountains, the most picturesque outlines of the lakes, and the works\r\nof art which embellish the whole, we think that most lovers of natural\r\nscenery would prefer that around the lakes of Como and Maggiore to\r\nthat of any other place familiarly known to the traveller. Como is\r\nordinarily conceived to carry off the palm in Europe, and it is not\r\nprobable that the great mountains of the East or any part of the Andes,\r\ncan assemble as many objects of grandeur, sweetness, magnificence and\r\nart, as are to be found in this region. Of course, our own country has\r\nnothing of the sort to compare with it. The Rocky Mountains, and the\r\nother great ranges in the recent accession of territory, must possess\r\nmany noble views, especially as one proceeds south; but the accessories\r\nare necessarily wanting, for a union of art and nature can alone render\r\nscenery perfect.\r\n\r\nIn the way of the wild, the terrific, and the grand, nature is\r\nsufficient of herself: but Niagara is scarcely more imposing than\r\nshe is now rendered lovely by the works of man. It is true that the\r\ncelebrated cataract has a marked sweetness of expression, if we may use\r\nsuch a term, that singularly softens its magnificence, and now that men\r\nare becoming more familiar with its mysteries, and penetrating into\r\nits very mists, by means of a small steamboat, the admirer of nature\r\ndiscovers a character different from that which first strikes the\r\nsenses.\r\n\r\nWe regard it as hypercritical to speak of the want of Alpine scenery\r\naround Niagara. On what scale must the mountains be moulded to bear\r\na just comparison, in this view of the matter, with the grandeur of\r\nthe cataract! The Alps, the Andes, and the Himmalaya, would scarcely\r\nsuffice to furnish materials necessary to produce the contrast, on any\r\nmeasurement now known to the world. In fact the accessories, except as\r\nthey are blended with the Falls themselves, as in the wonderful gorge\r\nthrough which the river rushes, in an almost fathomless torrent, as\r\nif frightened at its own terrific leap; the Whirlpool, and all that\r\nproperly belongs to the stream, from the commencement of the Rapids,\r\nor, to be more exact, from the placid, lake-like scenery above these\r\nRapids, down to the point where the waters of this mighty strait are\r\npoured into the bosom of the Ontario, strike us as being in singular\r\nharmony with the views of the Cataract itself.\r\n\r\nThe Americans may well boast of their waterfalls, and of their lakes,\r\nnotwithstanding the admitted superiority of upper Italy and Switzerland\r\nin connection with the highest classes of the latter. They form objects\r\nof interest over a vast surface of territory, and greatly relieve the\r\nmonotony of the inland views. We do not now allude to the five great\r\nlakes, which resemble seas and offer very much the same assemblage\r\nof objects to the eye; but to those of greatly inferior extent, that\r\nare sparkling over so much of the surface of the northern states. The\r\neast, and New-York in particular, abound in them, though farther west\r\nthe lover of the picturesque must be content to receive the prairie\r\nin their stead. It would be a great mistake, however, to attempt to\r\ncompare any of these lakes with the finest of the old world; though\r\nmany of them are very lovely and all contribute to embellish the\r\nscenery. Lake George itself could not occupy more than a fourth or\r\nfifth position in a justly graduated scale of the lakes of Christendom;\r\nthough certainly very charming to the eye, and of singular variety\r\nin its aspects. In one particular, indeed, this lake has scarcely an\r\nequal. We allude to its islands, which are said to equal the number of\r\nthe days in the year. Points, promontories, and headlands are scarcely\r\never substitutes for islands, which add inexpressibly to the effect of\r\nall water-views.\r\n\r\nIt has been a question among the admirers of natural scenery, whether\r\nthe presence or absence of detached farm-houses, of trees, hedges,\r\nwalls and fences, most contribute to the effect of any inland view.\r\nAs these are three great points of distinction between the continent\r\nof Europe and our own country, we shall pause a moment to examine\r\nthe subject a little more in detail. When the towns and villages are\r\nsufficiently numerous to catch the attention of the eye, and there are\r\noccasional fragments of forest in sight, one does not so much miss the\r\nabsence of that appearance of comfort and animated beauty that the\r\nother style of embellishment so eminently possesses. A great deal,\r\nhowever, depends, as respects these particulars, on the nature of the\r\narchitecture and the color of the buildings and fences. It is only in\r\nvery particular places and under very dull lights, that the contrast\r\nbetween white and green is agreeable. A fence that looks as if it were\r\ncovered with clothes hung out to dry, does very little towards aiding\r\nthe picturesque. And he who endeavors to improve his taste in these\r\nparticulars, will not fail to discover in time that a range of country\r\nwhich gives up its objects, chiselled and distinct, but sober, and\r\nsometimes sombre, will eventually take stronger hold of his fancy than\r\none that is glittering with the fruits of the paint and the whitewash\r\nbrushes. We are never dissatisfied with the natural tints of stone,\r\nfor the mind readily submits to the ordering of nature; and though one\r\ncolor may be preferred to another, each and all are acceptable in their\r\nproper places. Thus, a marble structure is expected to be white, and\r\nas such, if the building be of suitable dimensions and proportions,\r\nescapes our criticism, on account of its richness and uses. The same\r\nmay be said of other hues, when not artificial; but we think that most\r\nadmirers of nature, as they come to cultivate their tastes, settle down\r\ninto a preference for the gray and subdued over all the brighter tints\r\nthat art can produce. In this particular, then, we give the preference\r\nto the effects of European scenery, over that of this country, where\r\nwood is so much used for the purposes of building, and where the\r\nfashion has long been to color it with white. A better taste, however,\r\nor what we esteem as such, is beginning to prevail, and houses in towns\r\nand villages are now not unfrequently, even painted in subdued colors.\r\nWe regard the effect as an improvement, though to our taste no hue, in\r\nits artificial objects, so embellishes a landscape as the solemn color\r\nof the more sober, and less meretricious looking stones.\r\n\r\nWe believe that a structure of white, with green blinds, is almost\r\npeculiar to this country. In the most propitious situations, and under\r\nthe happiest circumstances, the colors are unquestionably unsuited\r\nto architecture, which, like statuary, should have but one tint. If,\r\nhowever, it be deemed essential to the flaunting tastes of the mistress\r\nof some mansion, to cause the hues of the edifice in which she resides\r\nto be as gay as her _toilette_, we earnestly protest against the bright\r\ngreen that is occasionally introduced for such purposes. There is a\r\ngraver tint, of the same color, that entirely changes the expression of\r\na dwelling. Place two of these houses in close proximity, and scarcely\r\nan intellectual being would pass them, without saying that the owner of\r\nthe one was much superior to the owner of the other in all that marks\r\nthe civilized man. Put a third structure in the immediate vicinity of\r\nthese two, that should have but one color on its surface, including its\r\nblinds, and we think that nine persons in ten, except the very vulgar\r\nand uninstructed, would at once jump to the conclusion that the owner\r\nof this habitation was in tastes and refinement superior to both his\r\nneighbors. A great improvement, however, in rural as well as in town\r\narchitecture, is now in the course of introduction throughout all the\r\nnorthern states. More attention is paid to the picturesque than was\r\nformerly the case, and the effects are becoming as numerous as they are\r\npleasing. We should particularize New Haven, as one of those towns that\r\nhas been thus embellished of late years, and there are other places of\r\nnearly equal size that might be mentioned as having the same claims\r\nto an improved taste. But to return to the great distinctive features\r\nbetween an ordinary American landscape and a similar scene in Europe.\r\nOf the artificial accessories it is scarcely necessary to say any more.\r\nOne does not expect to meet with a ruined castle or abbey, or even\r\nfortress, in America; nor, on the other hand, does the traveller look\r\nfor the forests of America, or that abundance of wood which gives to\r\nnearly every farm a sufficiency for all the common wants of life, on\r\nthe plains and heights of the old world. Wood there certainly is, and\r\npossibly enough to meet the ordinary wants of the different countries,\r\nbut it is generally in the hands of the governments or the great\r\nproprietors, and takes the aspect of forests of greater or less size\r\nthat are well cared for, cleared and trimmed like the grounds of a park.\r\n\r\nGermany has, we think, in some respects a strong resemblance to the\r\nviews of America. It is not so much wanting in detached copses and\r\nsmaller plantations of trees as the countries farther south and east\r\nof it, while it has less of the naked aspect in general that is so\r\nremarkable in France. Detached buildings occur more frequently in\r\nGermany than in France especially, and we might add also in Spain. The\r\nreader will remember that it is a prevalent usage throughout Europe,\r\nwith the exception of the British Islands, Holland, and here and there\r\na province in other countries, for the rural population to dwell in\r\nvillages. This practice gives to the German landscape, in particular,\r\na species of resemblance to what is ordinarily termed park scenery,\r\nthough it is necessarily wanting in much of that expression which\r\ncharacterizes the embellishments that properly belong to the latter.\r\nWith us this resemblance is often even stronger, in consequence of the\r\ncareless graces of nature and the great affluence of detached woods.\r\nThe distinguishing feature existing in the farm-house, fences and\r\noutbuildings. Of a cloudy day, a distant view in America often bears\r\nthis likeness to the park, in a very marked degree, for then the graces\r\nof the scene are visible to the eye, while the defects of the details\r\nare too remote to be detected.\r\n\r\nThe mountain scenery of the United States, though wanting in grandeur,\r\nand in that wild sublimity which ordinarily belongs to a granite\r\nformation, is not without attractions that are singularly its own.\r\nThe great abundance of forest, the arable qualities of the soil, and\r\nthe peculiar blending of what may be termed the agricultural and\r\nthe savage, unite to produce landscapes of extraordinary beauty and\r\ngracefulness. Vast regions of country possessing this character are to\r\nbe found in almost all the old states, for after quitting the coast for\r\na greater or less distance, varying from one to two hundred miles, the\r\nranges of the Alleghanies interpose between the monotonous districts\r\nof the Atlantic shores and the great plains of the west. We are of\r\nopinion that as civilization advances, and the husbandman has brought\r\nhis lands to the highest state of cultivation, there will be a line of\r\nmountain scenery extending from Maine to Georgia, in a north and south\r\ndirection, and possessing a general width of from one to two hundred\r\nmiles, from east to west, that will scarcely have a parallel in any\r\nother quarter of the world, in those sylvan upland landscapes, which,\r\nwhile they are wanting in the sublimity of the Alpine regions, share so\r\nlargely in the striking and effective.\r\n\r\nIt is usual for the American to boast of his rivers, not only for their\r\nsize and usefulness, but for their beauties. A thousand streams, that\r\nin older regions would have been rendered memorable, ages since, by\r\nthe poet, the painter, art in every form, and the events of a teeming\r\nhistory, flow within the limits of the United States still unsung,\r\nand nearly unknown. As yet, something is ordinarily wanting, in the\r\nway of finish, along the banks of these inferior water-courses. But\r\noccasionally, in places where art has, as it might be, accidentally\r\nassisted nature, they come into the landscape with the most pleasing\r\ninfluence on its charms. In this respect, the peculiarity of the\r\ncountry is rather in a want of uniformity than in any want of material.\r\nTo us, it would seem that all the northern states of America, at least,\r\nare far better watered than common, and that consequently they possess\r\nmore of this species of beauty. As for the great streams, the largest,\r\nperhaps, have the least claims to high character in this respect in\r\nboth the old and the new world. The Rhine is an exception, however, for\r\nit would be difficult to find another river of equal length and with\r\nthe same flow of water, that possesses the same diversity of character\r\nor one so peculiar. At its source it descends from the high glaciers of\r\nthe Alps a number of howling brooks, which forcing their way through\r\nthe upper valleys, unite below in a straggling, rapid, but shallow\r\nstream, that finds its way into the lake of Constance, out of which\r\nit issues a compact, rapid river, imposing by its volume of water,\r\nrather than by its breadth, or any other advantage. Its cataracts, so\r\ncelebrated in the old world, can scarcely claim to be the equal of the\r\nCohoes, or many others of the secondary falls of this country, though\r\nthe Rhine has always an abundance of water, which the Mohawk has not.\r\nOn quitting Switzerland, this remarkable stream assumes many aspects,\r\nand decorates, beyond a doubt, as much landscape scenery as falls to\r\nthe share of any other stream in the known world. We do not think it,\r\nhowever, in its best parts, equal to the Hudson in its whole length,\r\nthough the characters of these two rivers are so very different as\r\nscarcely to admit of a fair comparison. Perhaps the most remarkable\r\nfeature of the Rhine is its termination, for after embellishing and\r\nserving the purposes of such an extent of country in the very heart\r\nof Europe, it disappears, as it might be, in a number of straggling,\r\nuninteresting, turbid waters, among the marshes of Holland. This is a\r\nvery different exit from that which characterizes the majestic flow of\r\nthe Hudson into the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nEngland has no great rivers to boast of, though she has a few of\r\nsingular claims to notice, on account of the great flow of the tides\r\nand the vast amount of commerce that they bear on the bosom. The\r\nThames, so renowned in history, is as uninteresting as possible, until\r\nit passes above the bridges of London, where it becomes an ordinary\r\npretty sylvan stream.\r\n\r\nThe Seine, another river, familiar in name, at least, to every reader,\r\nhas much higher claims than its neighbor of the British Islands, in\r\nthe way of natural beauty. This stream, from Rouen to the Channel,\r\nis not without some very fine scenery, as well as possessing a very\r\nvariant and interesting character, with both natural and artificial\r\naccessories, to say nothing of the historical, that draw largely on the\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nItaly has many rivers that are celebrated in song or story, but not\r\none, we think, that should rank high, on the ground of landscape\r\nbeauty. Most of her streams are so dependent on the melting of the\r\nsnows in the Apennines and Alps, as to be either howling torrents,\r\nor meagre, straggling pools. The Arno, the Po, the Adige, the Tiber,\r\nand all the other rivers of that peninsula, are obnoxious to these\r\nobjections. Even the Tiber, which is navigable as high as Rome, for\r\nvessels of a light draft, is either a tranquil thread, or one of those\r\nnoisy, turbid streams that overflow their banks and often appear at a\r\nloss to know in which direction to pour their waters.\r\n\r\nThe day is not distant, when America must possess a vast extent of\r\nterritory of a character directly the reverse of that we have described\r\nin our mountain scenery, but which, nevertheless, will not be without\r\na certain magnificence from its extent, productions and fertility. We\r\nallude to the great plains of the West; those which lie between the\r\nbases of the Alleghanies and the semi-sterile steppes that are known\r\nin this part of the world as the great prairies. Lombardy, teeming as\r\nshe is, with population, vines, and all the productions of a fertile\r\nsoil, in the possession of millions, sinks into insignificance before\r\nthe vast plains that are destined to be her rivals in this quarter of\r\nthe world. Perhaps New-York alone could furnish nearly as much of this\r\ncharacter of country as is to be found in Upper Italy; for, stretching\r\nfrom the shores of Ontario towards the southern ranges of uplands,\r\nand as far east as Utica, is spread to the eye a vast extent of the\r\nmost fertile plain, slightly relieved in places with a rolling surface\r\nof very respectable claims to natural beauty. We question if greater\r\nfertility is to be found in any part of the world, than is met with in\r\nthe region last mentioned, though drainage and the other works of an\r\nadvanced state of husbandry, are still much wanting to bring forth both\r\nits fertility and its beauties.\r\n\r\nNew-York, indeed, in the way of scenery, has very high claims to\r\nvariety, gracefulness, and even grandeur, among the mountains of the\r\ncounties bordering on Champlain. By grandeur, however, let there be no\r\nmistake, by receiving the term in any other than a limited sense. Any\r\nwell delineated view of a high-class Swiss scene, must at once convince\r\neven the most provincial mind among us that nothing of the sort is to\r\nbe found in America, east of the Rocky mountains. Nevertheless, the\r\nAdirondack has claims to a wild grandeur, which, if it do not approach\r\nmagnificence, is of a character to impress a region with the seal of\r\na very noble nature. The lovers of the picturesque sustain a great\r\nloss by means of the numerous lines of railroads that have recently\r\ncome into existence. This is true of both Europe and America. In the\r\ncourse of time, it will be found that every where a country presents\r\nits best face towards its thoroughfares. Every thing that depends on\r\nart, naturally takes this aspect, for men are as likely to put on\r\ntheir best appearance along a wayside in the country as on the streets\r\nof a town. All that has been done, therefore, in past ages, in these\r\nparticulars, is being deranged and in some instances deformed by the\r\nnecessity of preserving levels, and avoiding the more valuable portions\r\nof a country, in order to diminish expense. Thus villages and towns\r\nare no longer entered by their finest passages, producing the best\r\neffects; but the traveller is apt to find his view limited by ranges\r\nof sheds, out-houses, and other deformities of that nature. Here and\r\nthere, some work of art, compelled by necessity, furnishes a relief to\r\nthis deformity. But on the whole, the recent system of railroads has\r\nas yet done very little towards adding much to the picturesque for the\r\nbenefit of the traveller. Here and there is to be found an exception,\r\nhowever, to this rule; portions of the Erie railroad, and the whole\r\nof the Hudson River, as well as that along the Rhine, necessarily\r\npossessing the advantage of sharing in the sublimity and grace through\r\nwhich they pass. Time will, of course, remedy the defects of the whole\r\narrangement; and a new front will be presented, as it may be, to the\r\ntraveller throughout the civilized world. Whether human ingenuity will\r\nyet succeed in inventing substitutes for the smoke and other unpleasant\r\nappliances of a railroad train, remains to be seen; but we think few\r\nwill be disposed to differ from us, when we say that in our view of\r\nthe matter this great improvement of modern intercourse has done very\r\nlittle towards the embellishment of a country in the way of landscapes.\r\nThe graceful winding curvatures of the old highways, the acclivities\r\nand declivities, the copses, meadows and woods, the half-hidden church,\r\nnestling among the leaves of its elms and pines, the neat and secluded\r\nhamlet, the farm-house, with all its comforts and sober arrangements,\r\nso disposed as to greet the eye of the passenger, will long be\r\nhopelessly looked for by him who flies through those scenes, which,\r\nlike a picture placed in a false light, no longer reflects the genius\r\nand skill of the artist.\r\n\r\nThe old world enjoys an advantage as regards the picturesque and\r\npleasing, in connection with its towns, that is wholly unknown, unless\r\nit may be in the way of exception, among ourselves. The necessity, in\r\nthe middle ages, of building for defence, and the want of artillery\r\nbefore the invention of gunpowder, contributed to the construction\r\nof military works for the protection of the towns in Europe, that\r\nstill remain, owing to their durable materials, often producing some\r\nof the finest effects that the imagination could invent to embellish\r\na picture. Nothing of the sort, of course, is to be met with here,\r\nfor we have no castles, have never felt the necessity of fortified\r\ntowns, and had no existence at the period when works of this nature\r\ncame within the ordinary appliances of society. On the contrary,\r\nthe utilitarian spirit of the day labors to erase every inequality\r\nfrom the surface of the American town, substituting convenience for\r\nappearance. It is probable there is no one who, in the end, would not\r\ngive a preference to these new improvements for a permanent residence;\r\nbut it is not to be denied that so far as the landscape is concerned,\r\nthe customs of the middle ages constructed much the most picturesque\r\nand striking collections of human habitations. Indeed, it is scarcely\r\npossible for the mind to conceive of objects of this nature, that are\r\nthrown together with finer effects, than are to be met with among the\r\nmountainous regions, in particular, of Europe. We illustrate one or\r\ntwo that are to be met with in the Apennines, and the Alps, and even\r\nin Germany, as proofs of what we say. The eye, of itself, will teach\r\nthe reader, that Richmond and Boston, and Washington and Baltimore,\r\nand half-a-dozen other American towns that do possess more or less of\r\nan unequal surface, must yield the palm to those gloriously beautiful\r\nobjects of the old world. When it is remembered, too, how much time has\r\nmultiplied these last, it can be seen that there are large districts\r\nin the mountain regions of the other hemisphere, that enjoy this\r\nsuperiority over us, if superiority it can be called, to possess the\r\npicturesque, at the expense of the convenient. The imagination can\r\nscarcely equal the pictures of this nature that often meet the eye in\r\nthe southern countries of Europe. Villages, with the chiselled outlines\r\nof castles, gray, sombre, but distinct, are often seen, perched on the\r\nsummits of rocky heights, or adhering, as it might be, to their sides,\r\nin situations that are frequently even appalling, and which invariably\r\nlend a character of peculiar beauty to the view. There are parts\r\nof Europe in which the traveller encounters these objects in great\r\nnumbers, and if an American, they never fail to attract his attention,\r\nas the wigwam and the bark canoe, and the prairie with lines of bisons,\r\nwould catch the eye of a wayfarer from the old world. To these humbler\r\nmountain pictures, must be added many a castle and strong-hold, of\r\nroyal or semi-royal origin, that are met with on the summits of\r\nabrupt and rocky eminences farther north. Germany has many of these\r\nstrong-holds, which are kept up to the present day, and which are found\r\nto be useful as places of security, as they are certainly peculiar and\r\ninteresting in the landscape.\r\n\r\nIt has often been said by scientific writers, that this country affords\r\nmany signs of an origin more recent than the surface of Europe. The\r\nproofs cited are the greater depths of the ravines wrought by the\r\naction of the waters following the courses of the torrents, and the\r\ngreater and general aspect of antiquity that is impressed on natural\r\nobjects in the other hemisphere. This theory, however, has met with a\r\ndistinguished opponent in our own time. Without entering at all into\r\nthe merits of this controversy, we shall admit that to the ordinary eye\r\nAmerica generally is impressed with an air of freshness, youthfulness,\r\nand in many instances, to use a coarse but expressive term, rawness,\r\nthat are seldom, if ever, met with in Europe. It might perhaps be easy\r\nto account for this by the labors of man, alone, though we think that\r\nnatural objects contribute their full share towards deepening the\r\npicture. We know of no mountain summits on this side of the Atlantic\r\nthat wear the hoary hues of hundreds that are seen on the other side\r\nof the water; and nearly everywhere in this country that the eye rests\r\non a mountain-top, it encounters a rounded outline of no very decided\r\ntints, unless, indeed, it may actually encounter verdure. To our eye,\r\nthis character of youthfulness is very strongly perceptible throughout\r\nthose portions of the republic with which we are personally acquainted,\r\nand we say this without reference to the recent settlements, which\r\nnecessarily partake of this character, but to the oldest and most\r\nfinished of our own landscapes. The banks of the Hudson, for instance,\r\nhave not the impress of time as strongly marked on their heights and\r\nheadlands, and bays, and even mountains, as the banks of the Rhine; and\r\nwe have often even fancied that this distinguishing feature between\r\nthe old and new worlds is to be traced on nearly every object of\r\nnature or art. Doubtless the latter has been the principal agent in\r\nproducing these effects; but it is undeniable that they form a leading\r\npoint of distinction in the general character of the scenery of the\r\ntwo continents. As for England, it has a shorn and shaven aspect that\r\nreminds one of the husbandman in his Sunday's attire; for we have seen\r\nthat island in February, when, owing to the great quantity of its grain\r\nand the prevalent humidity of the atmosphere, it really appeared to us\r\nto possess more verdure than it did in the subsequent July and August.\r\n\r\nThere is one feature in European scenery, generally, more prevalent,\r\nhowever, in Catholic than in other countries, to which we must allude\r\nbefore we close. The bourg, or town, with its gray castellated\r\noutlines, and possibly with walls of the middle ages, is, almost\r\ninvariably, clustered around the high, pointed roofs and solemn towers\r\nof the church. With us, how different is the effect! Half a dozen\r\nill-shaped, and yet pretending cupolas, and other ambitious objects,\r\nhalf the time in painted wood, just peer above the village, while\r\nthe most aspiring roof is almost invariably that of the tavern. It\r\nmay be easy enough to account for this difference, and to offer a\r\nsufficient apology for its existence. But to the observant lover of\r\nthe picturesque the effect is not only unpleasant but often repulsive.\r\nNo one of ordinary liberality would wish to interfere with freedom of\r\nconscience in order to obtain fine landscapes; but this is one of the\r\nhundred instances in which the thoughtful man finds reason to regret\r\nthat the church, as it exists among us, is not really more Catholic.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, we concede to Europe much the noblest scenery, in its\r\nAlps, Pyrenees, and Apennines; in its objects of art, as a matter of\r\ncourse; in all those effects which depend on time and association, in\r\nits monuments, and in this impress of the past which may be said to be\r\nreflected in its countenance; while we claim for America the freshness\r\nof a most promising youth, and a species of natural radiance that\r\ncarries the mind with reverence to the source of all that is glorious\r\naround us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   From the United Service Magazine\r\n\r\nA BULL FIGHT AT RONDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ride from Gibraltar to San Roque is familiar to all the inhabitants\r\nof the rock, and notwithstanding that the soil, the natives, and their\r\ncostume vary much from similar objects in England, and that the plants\r\nand scenery are totally of a foreign character, yet from the number\r\nof English people on the road, one finds it difficult to believe\r\none's-self in Spain until on the other side of San Roque.\r\n\r\nThis last small town is prettily situated on a hill, about five miles\r\nfrom Gibraltar. On passing the drawbridge which crosses the ditch\r\nat the Landport point, we got on the isthmus which traverses the\r\ninundation, situated at the North Front of this isolated fortress, and\r\nwhich is the only avenue of access or egress. The approach to this\r\nis also guarded by two strong outposts. The last of these, called\r\nthe old North Front, furnishes sentries which guard the intermediate\r\nposts between it and the Spanish lines. On arriving at the end of the\r\nisthmus, we crossed a place which is called the Neutral ground, and\r\nreached a small village garrisoned by a wing of a Spanish regiment,\r\nwho are there stationed to intercept smugglers. On leaving the village\r\nthere is no regular road, but those wishing to proceed to Spain have\r\nto ride or walk by the shore for a distance of about two miles, until\r\nthey reach a plain, which is crossed by a road leading to a small\r\nvillage called Campo. This place is often resorted to by the gentry of\r\nGibraltar, who find it much cooler during summer than their residences\r\nin the streets of the town. After passing this village, which had\r\ncertainly little of interest about it, we rode by a circuitous road,\r\ngenerally hedged on each side by plants of the cactus and aloes, and\r\nbut little wooded, till we reached San Roque.\r\n\r\nHere we saw in miniature what may be called a specimen of a Spanish\r\ntown; the windows at the lower story of the houses barred with cages\r\nof iron called _regas_, which completely obstruct all entrance by that\r\nmode, rendering them in fact like jails. The streets paved with large\r\nstones, quite dry, and disposed so irregularly as to make them the most\r\ndisagreeable to ride in that I ever witnessed. Then there was the small\r\nalameda, with its walks, and trees quite neat and regular; where the\r\nbeauties of the rural town paced with their mantillas and fans: on the\r\nother side was a barrack, which contained a Spanish regiment, who were\r\ndrilling and exercising when we arrived. These were swarthy-looking\r\nfellows, mostly young and undersized.\r\n\r\nAs we rode away from the town we descended by a rugged stony road,\r\nwhich was very rough, and in some places nearly precipitous. Our party\r\nconsisted of four officers besides myself, two mules containing our\r\nclothes and provisions, and a guide and servant on horseback. We got\r\npacked up in panniers all the loose beer and cold meat, tea, coffee,\r\nsugar, biscuit, sausages, hams, and other edibles which we should\r\nrequire for a week's consumption, and did not find that we had at all\r\nexceeded our computation, for with the exception of eggs, fowls, milk,\r\nbutter, chocolate, and indifferent wine, we could get nothing in the\r\nway of eating and drinking at the different villages we stopped at. Our\r\ncavalcade was consequently delayed very much by being obliged to keep\r\nwith the mules. We went along this very rough and rugged stony track,\r\nwhich could scarcely be called a road, for about two miles; we then\r\ncrossed some hills. The country for about three miles from San Roque\r\nwas quite open.\r\n\r\nHere it was that we arrived at a mountain pass, which was very thickly\r\nplanted on each side with brushwood, shrubs, and fern. So thick and\r\nimpervious was the cover for those who might choose to lie in ambush,\r\nthat a band of many men, at least amounting to sixty, might have rested\r\nconcealed quite close to the path which we rode on. I am not disposed\r\nto be credulous relative to stories which travellers tell on the\r\nsubject of hairbreadth escapes and adventures; but, certainly in this\r\ncountry, more than any in Europe, there is presented a more continuous\r\nseries of scenes which one's fancy might suppose calculated to be the\r\nresort of outlawed marauders or wandering bandits. I had heard numerous\r\naccounts of parties having been waylaid, and of the danger consequent\r\nupon travelling in Spain, and the disposition of the country people is\r\nso prone to exaggerate, that every day adds a fresh instance to the\r\ncatalogue of incidents which those who listen to them hear recorded.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the scenery which we were passing through was such as to\r\nrecall to our mind the spirited groups of Salvator Rosa's coloring, or\r\nthe sketches so graphically described by Cervantes or Le Sage.\r\n\r\nWe had not ridden further than a few yards when two men rushed from\r\nthe cover with their firelocks to their shoulders, and called out\r\n\"Alto, alto.\" Their action, their dress, the tone which they used\r\nmade me conclude that they were bandits, and I rode up to one of our\r\nparty, the only one who was armed (who carried a pair of pistols in\r\nhis saddlebags), and asked him to lend me one of them. He had not time\r\nto answer before one of the men approached me with his firelock to his\r\nshoulder, and said, in Spanish, \"I can hit a sombrero at two hundred\r\nyards distance.\" Another of our party advised me to answer him civilly,\r\nfor, he said, \"I see four men from different quarters who have their\r\nfirelocks levelled at you.\" On this I demanded of him if he wanted\r\nmoney, or wished for something to drink. He seemed more indignant\r\nat this supposition, and informed us that he and his party were\r\ncarbineros or revenue officers, who were stationed there to intercept\r\nany smugglers who might be proceeding into Spain. He said that he would\r\nbe obliged in any case to detain our mules, and that from what I had\r\nsaid he should be obliged to keep us prisoners until he heard from\r\nthe Governor at Algeciras. Then the rest of his party all made their\r\nappearance, each of them armed with firelock and pistols, and having\r\nwith them the mules belonging to one of the parties of officers who had\r\nbeen going to Ronda. After a deal of altercation, we rode back with\r\nthem and decided upon the plan of sending two of our party to Algeciras\r\nto the Governor, to ask him relative to the state of the case. It was\r\nvexatious being delayed, but there was no help for it.\r\n\r\nWhen the two officers started we were about twelve miles from\r\nAlgeciras. We then rode through a wild country much wooded with shrubs,\r\ngroves of oleanders, orange groves, hedges of grapes, and other\r\nexotics, which are so rare and so much prized at home, and, crossing\r\ntwo rivers, we reached the sea beach at some distance from Algeciras.\r\nThe mode of crossing the river was by large movable boats which had\r\npullies attached to their frames on deck, and ropes which were fastened\r\nto the beams on shore at one end, and at the other to some leathern\r\nthongs which the men fastened to their shoulders, and towing them on\r\nboard, soon passed the boat over from one bank to the other. When we\r\nwere on the beach, the leader of the party of carbineros fired his\r\npiece at a gull which passed and wounded him, but the bird, who was\r\nhit in the wing, rested on the water.\r\n\r\nWe did not ride far before our two friends returned, and heartily\r\nwelcome they were. They produced a paper signed by the Governor, a\r\nSpanish General at Algeciras, which ordered our instant liberation;\r\nthey said that he was very indignant when he heard of our capture. The\r\nleader of the party of carbineros on this was satisfied, and gave up\r\nthe pistols which he had captured from the officer who carried them,\r\nand bid us farewell. We then had to ride to San Roque, and on our way\r\nback, had much amusement in talking over our adventure. I was certainly\r\nvery glad that we had offered no resistance to these people; but had we\r\nleft our mules in their charge it would have been most inconvenient,\r\nand in fact I think scarcely safe. The party which preceded us had\r\nreason to be very thankful, for by our means they obtained safe\r\ncarriage for their mules, which they would not have seen for some days,\r\nhad it not been for our having come up with them. So we were obliged\r\nto take up our quarters for that night at the inn at San Roque, which\r\nwas a nice clean place, and kept by an Englishman and his wife. It is\r\naltogether much more like an English house in its accommodation than\r\na Spanish one, which, it is needless to add, is speaking much in its\r\npraise. In the evening at dinner the principal topic of conversation\r\nwas this adventure of ours, and we heard some accounts of the modes of\r\ntravelling in Spain, and the direful amount of smuggling which exists\r\nbetween its confines and Gibraltar, from an old inhabitant of the rock.\r\nHe told us a story of his having been stopped, and having his horse\r\ntaken from him, and being obliged to walk a number of miles. He never\r\nsaw the horse again, and never heard a word of the robbers who stopped\r\nhim, and yet he said that it happened at about six miles distance from\r\nSan Roque.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the weather was certainly beautiful, and numerous\r\nparties came in from Gibraltar, to breakfast at San Roque, previous to\r\ntheir long ride to Gaucin, a distance of thirty miles. The merriment\r\nthat prevailed, the novelty of the expected scenes, the beauty of the\r\nwild romantic country they were about to enter, the good spirits and\r\nfreedom of manners of all, made every party seem exhilarated and happy.\r\nSome were dressed in the style of the Spanish Majos, and armed with\r\npistols and daggers. The generality wore light jackets, sashes, and\r\ntrousers: also the sombrero was very much in use. The Spanish masta,\r\nthat most useful appendage to a traveller's equipment, was over most of\r\nthe saddles. We were all enabled to rest confident in the assurance of\r\nnot being molested or waylaid upon the road, as, being the regular day\r\nfor visitors to proceed to Ronda, the authorities had posted soldiers\r\nin different parts of the road. We came up with and passed many groups\r\nof Spaniards. The men were dressed with short jackets, sometimes laced,\r\nand having a vast number of small buttons, large red sash, leggings\r\nwith rows of buttons all the way down on each side, and boltinas or\r\nleathern hose worn open. They all wore the sombrero, and most of them\r\nwere armed with firelocks, slung from their shoulders. The colored\r\nmantas, as usual, were strapped on the saddles, in order to render the\r\nriding easy, to serve as a cloak in the event of rain, and to answer\r\nfor bed-clothes on their arrival at the Fonda, where they were going to\r\nsleep. The ladies of the Spanish parties were mounted either on mules\r\nor barricos seated on cushions, which were strapped on pads, placed\r\non the animals with two cross sticks on the shoulder and two on its\r\ncrupper. The ladies all wore mantillas, and with the exception of the\r\nnumber of petticoats which they invariably wear, their dress did not\r\nvary much from that of English country people. We passed through a\r\nbroken hilly country until we reached the cork-wood--that forest which\r\nstretches for about ten miles from east to west, a most picturesque\r\nspot, composed principally of cork-trees and some orange groves. At\r\nabout ten miles from San Roque we arrived at the Bocea de Leones,\r\nthat most dangerous pass, where the country was wild and the scenery\r\nromantic. There were stationed here some Spanish cavalry who guarded\r\nthe pass. They were all fine able-bodied men, mounted on strong black\r\nhorses; they wore blue double-breasted coats, buff belts, jack-boots,\r\nand large cocked hats. Past the cork-wood the country was broken and\r\nhilly, thickly planted with shrubs and evergreens; reeds and brushwood\r\nwere also numerous. After this we got into a valley which was well\r\ncultivated, and the plantations lay thickly studded with oleanders and\r\nwild roses, and we saw frequently a white plant resembling the myrtle.\r\nThe grounds had a gay and fresh appearance. When we were passing one of\r\nthe fields where the laborers were at work we saw the curious manner in\r\nwhich the lower order of Spaniards eat--their mess of _gaypacho_ was\r\nin a large bowl, which was placed in the centre of a circle formed by\r\nabout sixty men, and each supplied with a spoon; they then dipped the\r\nspoon into this capacious bowl, one after another, in regular routine,\r\nuntil the food was finished.\r\n\r\nWe crossed about twelve different streams in going through this valley,\r\nand soon after passing the last, we came to an orange grove, through\r\nwhich the ride was agreeable. The delicious fruit was in abundance,\r\nloading the trees on each side of the way, when we arrived at the\r\nfoot of the hill on which Gaucin is situated, and had an ascent of\r\nnearly three miles, which was winding and rugged before we reached the\r\nroad leading into the town. The difficulty of the road, the nearly\r\nimpassable ascent of the cliffs, the circuitous track of the route,\r\nmade it a matter of surprise to us that a town such as this we were\r\napproaching should have been built on a site where the supply of almost\r\nany articles of merchandise was so inconvenient. Groups of hundreds of\r\nchildren lined the passes calling out to us incessantly, \"Oh tio om\r\ncherito.\" We entered the town and were long before we could accommodate\r\nourselves with a night's lodging, which however at last we managed to\r\nprocure at the private house of a man who called himself a captain in\r\nthe Spanish army. It was very uncomfortable, although perhaps the best\r\nthat could be had in the town, and they charged exorbitantly. The town\r\nis most picturesquely situated upon a lofty height. After our long\r\nride, which was over such a rough and broken country, we did not feel\r\nmuch disposed to saunter about, but as the evening was far advanced we\r\nstayed within doors. We procured merely the means of cooking, and milk,\r\neggs, and fowl; but the people made themselves very agreeable, and we\r\nhad great amusement and laughter. We set off early the next morning and\r\ncommenced by descending the lofty mound upon which the town is built,\r\nby as tortuous and harassing a path as that by which we approached it.\r\nHowever, after we had proceeded about two miles a vista of as romantic\r\nand pleasing a kind as any I had ever seen in any other country opened\r\nbefore me. In the continuous range of hills which lined the road, the\r\nvineyards covered both the sides and tops for several miles around, and\r\nthe valleys in the distance were thickly planted with chestnut woods:\r\nfurther on, the vast range of the ronda sierra lined the horizon.\r\n\r\nThe outline of these mountains was bold and their scenery grand. Their\r\nsides and summits were studded throughout with towns, embosomed in the\r\nvast woods of chestnuts. They loomed beautiful and picturesque in the\r\ndifferent intervals, and it wanted only water to render it an Elysium\r\nupon earth. After keeping this in view for several miles, and through\r\na narrow and precipitous track, we came to a line of mountain scenery\r\nwhere the hills were altogether barren, except where, far down their\r\nsides, the corn fields were planted, where the road was much worse.\r\nWe saw another town which went by the name of Gaucin also, and had a\r\nlarge redoubt to defend it, on its right flank; then the route circled\r\nround the mountains towards Attogate. We could not take our horses\r\nout of a foot pace, and very often I dismounted to lead mine down the\r\ncraggy rocks. No horses but those shod in the Spanish fashion could\r\nmanage to get through these descents. Towards the entrance of Attogate\r\nit was rather more uneven and dangerous, and I heard that one of the\r\nhorsemen of the party that preceded us had been thrown. We passed\r\nthrough the miserable village, which was as wretched as any thing that\r\nI had ever seen even in Ireland, and went on still by a mountain path,\r\nand round by lofty hills, for about three miles. We then got sight of\r\na very spacious plain, like an immense amphitheatre; to the west and\r\nto the east were the ranges of the Ronda hills, and to the north, as\r\nwe approached, was a precipitous cliff of about two thousand feet in\r\nheight, upon the summit of which was situated the town of Ronda. This\r\nseemed at the distance like a large perpendicular mass of earth. From\r\nthe first place where we viewed it until our entrance to the town, the\r\nroad or path was even more rugged than that which we traversed during\r\nmost part of the day.\r\n\r\nWe entered the old town and passed the remains of many Moorish ruins,\r\nthrough a stony street, with houses built like most of the Spanish\r\nones, and came to a large bridge which crossed a ravine through which\r\nthe river flows. This bridge is at a height of about one thousand feet\r\nfrom the level of the river. We then passed through the plaza and came\r\nto the street where we found a lodging. As the bull fights were not to\r\ncommence until four P.M., the next day, we had a little leisure to look\r\nabout us. In the streets all the crowded shops showed that an unusual\r\ninflux of strangers had come to visit the place. We saw some splendid\r\nhouses; one I particularly remarked, which belonged to the Marquis\r\nde Salvittierra; its lofty gateway of stone covered with devices and\r\nfigures in alto-relievo, reminded me, with the motto inscribed over the\r\nsummit of its arch, of the entrance to an Eastern palace. My companion,\r\nwho was taking a sketch of it, after he had finished his labor was\r\nstanding with me admiring this arch, which had evidently been the work\r\nof the Saracen invaders, when we saw two ladies in mantillas, both\r\ndaughters of the late Marquis, who were walking towards its entrance.\r\nWe told them in Spanish that we were foreigners--Englishmen, who had\r\ncome to Ronda to visit it during the time of the fair, and in place\r\nof being annoyed at our seeming forwardness in thus addressing them,\r\nthey invited us into the house. We went through corridors, futios, and\r\nup the staircase, which was ornamented with some tolerable paintings,\r\nand entered into one of the salas, or large rooms. When we arrived\r\nthe two graceful girls, one of whom was about twenty and the other\r\nabout sixteen, stood with their arms folded before them, and their\r\nhead slightly bowing. They had each large fans in their hands. Their\r\ndress was stylish; their slippers beautiful and small; their black lace\r\nmantillas waving round their hair; their dress completely of black,\r\nmade their figures seem elegant and their countenances interesting.\r\nTheir eyes had the deep languor of the southern aspect, more than\r\nthe playful loveliness which frequently is seen with those of their\r\nage. Their features were regular, and their teeth, which they showed\r\nin smiling to us when we entered, were of dazzling whiteness. I\r\nrecollected the Spanish words used in salutation, viz.: \"A los fies di\r\nusted mi senorita,\" and on hearing it in the foreign accent it was\r\ngreat amusement to them, as they repeated it from one to the other.\r\nWe conversed on various subjects relative to the town, the scenery,\r\nthe approaching feasts, the bull fights, and after a little time took\r\nour leave, charmed with their agreeable and pleasing conversation. All\r\nthe halls, corridors, and chambers of this palace were adorned with\r\npictures, but the rooms were furnished rather scantily, as seems the\r\nSpanish custom.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we went to the Alameda, where we saw numerous groups\r\nof Spanish beauties promenading. Certainly no female figures which I\r\nhave ever met with look better than the Spanish women. Their walk has\r\nbeen often noticed by different writers, and yet I have never read\r\nany description that does it justice. It is not the least like the\r\naffected wriggling gait of the French women or the frigid stride of the\r\nEnglish, but a light, graceful step combining elegance and ease. They\r\nall seem to walk in the same way, and as it forms a great part of their\r\ndaily occupation, it is no wonder that they should excel in it. Their\r\nlanguage of the fans is another peculiarity of the country. I was shown\r\nit by a lady; it is a series of signs by which a lady lets the man who\r\nlooks at her know what her wishes are, either of disdain, reproof, or\r\nencouragement, and is well known and recognized. I should recommend\r\nevery gentleman who wishes to stay in the country to learn it.\r\n\r\nWe met our two charming friends, the Spanish Marquis's daughters, and\r\nwalked with them on the Alameda until it was dark. The grounds are\r\nprettily laid out, and the view from the western height which overlooks\r\nthe precipitous descent which I spoke of, viewed from a distance, is\r\ntruly superb. There the winding stream and the country which bounds it\r\nembrace the foot of the perpendicular declivity.\r\n\r\nThe next day we heard nothing but preparations for the grand show,\r\nwhich was to take place in a circus exactly opposite the lodging we\r\nhad got into. The Spanish cavalry, dressed in yellow coats and large\r\njack-boots, lined the streets and played their band in front of our\r\nwindows. All orders and classes, young and old, dressed in their gayest\r\ncostume, were seen going about the town. The persons who lived in our\r\nhouse, who were a Spanish officer and his family, all got tickets of\r\nadmission which we paid for. The box or partition which we hired, we\r\ntook in common with the officers of another regiment, who had also\r\nridden over from Gibraltar to witness the bull fights.\r\n\r\nThe arena when we entered was surrounded by a concourse of about 1,500\r\npeople, many of whom were ladies, but the majority of the meaner\r\norders. The amphitheatre or plaza, as it is called by the Spaniards,\r\nwas about the same size as that at Milan. The architecture had,\r\nhowever, no resemblance to that of the Italian city. The diameter was\r\nabout 200 feet. Various writers have noticed the interest which the\r\nSpaniards take in these sights; and the multitude which surrounded the\r\namphitheatre, seated either in the boxes or standing in the tiers,\r\nwhich were level with the arena of combat, all seemed eagerly expectant\r\nof the arrival of the different actors in the scene.\r\n\r\nAbout a quarter past four in the afternoon, a trumpet sounded, and on\r\nthe opening of the side doors, five picadors entered, followed at a few\r\npaces by three mules abreast, drawing a pole like a swingle tree, with\r\na chain attached to it. They were mounted each on a sorry, miserable\r\nhack-horse. They were dressed in yellow jackets, covered with beads\r\nof silver and all sorts of ornaments; broad white sombreros, decked\r\nall round with ribbons, yellow chamois leather trowsers, stuffed\r\nout with cork and cotton, and coated inside the leather with iron\r\nplates. After the mules with their car, came the three matadors, in\r\norder. Their dress was perfectly superb; it was a close fitting majos\r\ndress, ornamented with silver lacing and beading. The names of these\r\nmatadors were Montes, Espesa, and Ximenes. The first wore a beautiful\r\nrose-colored tunic, and his hair tied behind with ribbons, and\r\ncrimson-colored leggings, &c. The dress of the second was of the same\r\nform, only varying in color, being all pink. The dress of the third was\r\nalso the same in cut, but of a black color. These three, as well as the\r\nchulos, wore silk stockings. The chulos followed next in succession,\r\nand were dressed similar to the matadors, but not so grandly. They,\r\nas well as the matadors, all carried a large cloth, of silk texture,\r\nwhich was either red, blue, or yellow. The chulos were about five in\r\nnumber. They all advanced across the arena to where the Alcalde was\r\nseated, whilst the trumpets sounded, and as soon as these ceased to\r\nblow, the mules with their car left the arena by the same door as that\r\nby which they arrived, and the remainder of the procession dispersed\r\nto the different parts of the circus. After a lapse of two or three\r\nminutes, the centre door opened, and a furious black bull rushed in\r\nthe most impetuous manner into the circus, and charged the different\r\npicadors. The first was not hurt, but the second and third picador had\r\ntheir horses ripped open. This was really a most revolting sight, for\r\neven after these cruel inflictions upon the poor horses, and when their\r\nentrails were hanging out, the picadors who rode them goaded them still\r\nonwards. The attendants in the circus joined in this act of cruelty. I\r\ndo not think that Byron was far wrong in saying of these sights--\r\n\r\n    \"Such the ungentle sport that oft invites\r\n      The Spanish maid and cheers the Spanish swain.\r\n    Nurtured in blood, betimes, his heart delights\r\n      In vengeance, gloating on another's pain.\"\r\n\r\nThe fourth picador broke his spear in meeting the rushing of this bull.\r\nThe bull bled much from this, and at the fifth charge he ripped up\r\nanother horse. I watched every turn of the \"hearty fight,\" and noted\r\nit in my tablet. Though not quite what I considered in my English ideas\r\nas _sport_, yet it was altogether so novel that I question if I ever\r\njoined in a hunt which gave me greater interest. It would, however, be\r\nextremely unjust to make any comparison between our manly sport and\r\nthis cruel spectacle, or even to mention them in the same breath.\r\n\r\nThe chulos now began at intervals to provoke the bull by advancing\r\ntowards him with their colored cloaks spread, and urging him to follow\r\nthem. Their activity was most remarkable. Whenever the bull approached\r\nthem close, they left their cloaks, and vaulted up the partition. One\r\nof them, whom I saw pressed quite close, jumped clean over the bull's\r\nhead, and many such feats of agility we saw, both at this time and\r\nduring the whole of the exhibition. After several efforts made to\r\nprovoke him, the bull jumped over the wooden partition which separated\r\nthe amphitheatre from the arena, a height of about five feet, called\r\nby the Spaniards the barrero. Of course this caused much terror and\r\nsensation, as many were standing quite close, and the rush was quite\r\nawful: however, after running half round, he jumped into the circus\r\nagain. He then struck a picador, leaped the inclosure, and stayed a\r\nshorter time than at first, when he again jumped out, after several\r\nattempts on the part of the chulos to provoke him, and when he appeared\r\nwearied and fainter from his exertions and from the loss of blood.\r\n\r\nOn this the Alcalde caused the trumpets to sound and the banderilleros\r\ncame in, each carrying two stakes about a yard long and fringed with\r\nshort flags. They ran close to the animal, and plunged these stakes,\r\ncalled banderillos, into the bull's shoulders. Four of these were let\r\nfly and plunged into his flesh, and the trumpets again sounded for\r\nthe matadors to stick him with a sword. Montes undertook this bull,\r\nand drawing a long sword, he stood before him until the bull got near\r\nenough, when he stuck him between the shoulders. The chulos provoked\r\nhim a second time, and Montes again wounded him. The attack of the\r\nchulos was repeated, when Montes planted his sword in the animal's\r\nshoulder, but instantly withdrew it. Twice more the chulos came to\r\nthe attack, and on each occasion the bull's shoulder was laid open by\r\nMontes, but at the sixth onslaught, the matador plunged his sword up\r\nto the hilt in the mangled flesh, and the bull fell. Then entered a\r\nman dressed like a chulo, with a dagger called a puntilla, and which\r\ngave to its owner the designation of a puntillero, and struck it in the\r\nneck of the prostrate animal, which immediately expired. When this was\r\nascertained, the mules who had formed part of the opening procession,\r\nand had then withdrawn, reappeared, and the carcase of the bull was\r\ntied to the swingle tree, and dragged out of the arena.\r\n\r\nSeven other bulls were brought out in succession, and attacked in the\r\nsame manner, with a little variation in the details. The second bull\r\ncharged two picadors, and did them no damage, but in a third charge he\r\nlamed a picador's horse, and received himself a serious gash in the\r\nneck. At a fourth charge he ripped open a horse's bowels, and coming\r\non for the fifth and sixth time, threw the horse of another picador\r\nprostrate, and when he was on the ground, dug his horns into the bowels\r\nof the horse in a most frightful manner. I was never more forcibly\r\nreminded of Homer's description of the wolves, who in their charge\r\nupon the flock, seize with such fiendish fierceness #\"kai enkata panta\r\nlaphyssei.\"#\r\n\r\nThe matador who undertook the third bull had but one eye, and,\r\nto render the combat equal, one of the bull's eyes was blinded,\r\nan expedient worthy of its cruel inventors. I remarked nothing\r\nextraordinary about the baiting or slaughter of this bull, except that\r\none of the chulos, in flying from him, had his clothes torn off, and\r\nnarrowly escaped being gored.\r\n\r\nThe sixth bull was a very strong one. In his charges he disabled two\r\npicadors, both of whom were obliged to be removed from the arena,\r\nand one was perfectly senseless. The infuriated animal then charged\r\na horse, which he killed instantaneously. The mules which I spoke of\r\nbefore, came in, and bore away the horse's carcase. Meanwhile the third\r\nmatador, Ximenes, struck the bull with a sword up to the hilt, and\r\nkilled him. He got his ear as a trophy, which he held up in triumph,\r\nand was saluted with innumerable vivas from the boxes of the Spanish\r\nSenoritas, some of whom wore black, and some white lace mantillas.\r\n\"Lesa lo dey,\" also was shouted loudly, meaning, let him have the bull\r\nfor his courage. As one of the classic writers has it, it turned out\r\n\"Vox populi vox Dei,\" for the hero was awarded the prize.\r\n\r\nThe seventh bull was considered a slow one by the audience, and they\r\ncommenced shouting out \"fuego, fuego.\" So when the banderilleros were\r\ndirected to throw their arrows, they fastened squibs and crackers in\r\nvarious parts of the arrow or banderillo, and, on their exploding, the\r\nfrantic animal went racing round the arena, goaded to madness by the\r\ncrackers, which continued to go off at every step. This bull was given\r\nover to Montes to kill, as a very difficult subject, and the intrepid\r\nmatador made one or two attempts before he succeeded in closing with\r\nhim. The last time he plunged his sword between his shoulders, and the\r\nbull dropped dead.\r\n\r\nThe eighth bull was killed after two thrusts, and then the large\r\nconcourse of people flocked into the circus, and shortly afterwards,\r\nit being 7 o'clock, almost every one proceeded on to the Alameda.\r\nNext morning, the bull fights were resumed, and the sport, if I may\r\ncall it by so mild a name, was considered superior. The matadors were\r\ndifferently dressed, and I remarked that all the picadors' horses were\r\nblindfolded. Montes, the first time of their contact, drove his sword\r\ninto the neck of the first bull, a remarkably fine and very fierce\r\nanimal, and it died in a few seconds afterwards. Four other bulls\r\nfollowed in order, and were all overcome. But the contest of the day\r\nwas with the sixth bull. This savage animal killed a horse at his first\r\ncharge. He then flew at another, and gored its sides in a frightful\r\nmanner, completely lifting the rider off its back. The unfortunate\r\npicador was carried out, apparently dead. The bull then broke a\r\nhorse's forearm, and charging another, ripped it open, though its\r\nrider escaped, and, being mounted afresh, behaved in the most heroic\r\nway, proving, himself, in fact, quite the lion of the day, whose feats\r\nexcited the wonder and the applause of the multitude. He approached the\r\nbox where we were seated, and threw his hat down. Showers of gold and\r\ndollars, amounting I should think to about 80, rewarded his compliments\r\n\"a los Engless.\" He acknowledged this, by saying that our kindness\r\nshould be always remembered. This bull was tormented a long time, and\r\ncertainly the cruelty exhibited was most repulsive. The people quite\r\nexulted in the way they drew out the barbed darts from the creature's\r\nback, and thrust them in again, in every way that could torture him\r\nmost. He was, however, at last killed by Montes, after a number of\r\nthrusts. After he had been struck the third time by Montes, the blood\r\ngushed out from his mouth in torrents, and in about seven seconds he\r\ndied. In the baiting of the eighth bull, the same picador showed his\r\ndexterity. In the third charge which he made, he killed a horse. At\r\nfirst he brought the horse to the ground, and rolled him over as he\r\nwould a cat; then, having dug his horns into his bowels for some time,\r\nat last left him for dead. Two other bulls followed, and with the death\r\nof the last, the spectacle terminated.\r\n\r\nThe third day was appropriated to the exhibition of the first rudiments\r\nof bull-fighting, and was a regular gala for the more youthful portion\r\nof the community. There is no parallel to this practice at present\r\nexisting in any part of Europe. The prize-fighting which till lately\r\nprevailed in England, independent of the heartiness, and emulative\r\ncourage of the combatants, was a barbarism of quite another kind, the\r\nexcitement of which was enhanced by the scope it allowed for gambling.\r\nBut in bull-fighting there is no chance of making money, nor are wagers\r\never laid upon the combatants. The spectacle, in fact, is more like\r\nthe games that took place in imperial Rome, which argue a brutality of\r\nfeeling worthy of those degraded and sensual times.\r\n\r\nThe third day there were no matadors, picadors, or chulos, but to the\r\nyouthful part of the populace, it was one of the most pleasant. The\r\nbulls were allowed to enter, and were chased here and there by the\r\npopulace with sticks. There was a good deal of childish folly and\r\nmountebank frivolity in these exhibitions. After the bull had been\r\ntormented for about twenty minutes, he was allowed to leave the circus,\r\nand they brought in a large tame one, with a bell round his neck, who\r\nwas followed immediately by the young ones. One of the small bulls\r\nwho was baited in this way, jumped over the barrier; but being much\r\nworried, soon jumped back.\r\n\r\nThe people moved about the circus, laughing and running, and seemed\r\nlike schoolboys just allowed out to play, after the hours of study were\r\nfinished. It seemed to me that the reputed gravity of the Spaniards did\r\nnot at all extend to the lower orders, or to the women, whose mirth,\r\nanimation, and playfulness of manner are very striking. The third bull\r\nwas killed, and this one was the only sacrifice to the sanguinary\r\ntastes of the people.\r\n\r\nTwo large, high, basket-like gabions were afterwards brought in, when\r\ntwo men entered them up to the arms, and it was great diversion to the\r\npeople to see the bulls, who were successively led into the arena, and\r\nwhose horns were covered with leather, tossing these baskets about. The\r\nmen who were inside had got banderillos, which they stuck in the bull's\r\nback when he came up to them. This lasted for some time, but at last\r\nthe crowd grew weary of it, and dispersed.\r\n\r\nOn this day, Charpur (who certainly was the hero of the play),\r\nexhibited his dexterity as a chulos in the scene where the bull killing\r\ntook place. One of the novices, who was being educated as a matador,\r\ndrove his sword through the bull's neck, up to the hilt, transfixing a\r\nportion of the flesh, and leaving the blade dangling from it. Charpur\r\nwent up to the bull, and, partly by his cloak and partly by his\r\nmenaces, led him towards the barrera, when he seized hold of his tail,\r\nand holding on by his back, approached his neck, and coolly took the\r\nsword out, which he threw on the ground.\r\n\r\nSuch is the recreation, and such the feats, which are the theme of\r\npraise and topic of conversation amongst the Spanish people, who\r\ndiscourse of it as we do of the races at Ascot or Newmarket, or any\r\nother resort of the men on the turf. But I certainly did not see one\r\nEnglish lady there, notwithstanding the numbers of Spanish mantillas\r\nwhich might have kept them in countenance.\r\n\r\n    \"Yet are Spain's maids no race of Amazons,\r\n    But formed for all the witching arts of love;\r\n    In softness and in firmness far above\r\n    Remoter females, famed for sickening prate.\"\r\n\r\nThis, by what I can learn, is the only remnant of the ancient fights\r\nwhich the Goths must have learned from the Romans; cruel and barbarous\r\nexhibitions, much \"more honored in the breach than in the observance.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day we passed in walking about the town. We entered a church,\r\nwhich was built of soft granite, and the internal structure of which\r\nreminded me of some that I had seen in Florence and Milan. The arches\r\nwere Gothic; the columns that supported the cupolas inside, and the\r\ndifferent domes into which the aisle was divided, were massive and\r\ngrand. The paintings seemed not to be from the hands of masters; and\r\nthe altars, which at a distance seemed so gorgeous, had rather a tinsel\r\nglittering sort of appearance on near approach, such as would be called\r\nfamiliarly \"gingerbread shows\"--but it was very lofty and extensive.\r\n\r\nWe went next to see the old Moorish palace. Here a staircase, very much\r\ndilapidated, led from the interior to the edge of the small river which\r\nruns through the whole of Ronda. The town being divided by a very deep\r\nravine, at the bottom of which the river flows, and which is crossed\r\nby three bridges. Down this staircase, damp, gloomy, and intricate as\r\nit was, we descended, and a guide preceded us with a candle, which,\r\nhowever, scarcely gave us light enough to see our way down the dark and\r\nslippery descent. It was constructed, according to the instruction of\r\nour cicerone, in the year 800, by one of the Moorish kings, who had it\r\nbuilt for the purpose of supplying his palace with water. At the foot\r\nof it we came to a sort of window, which going through, we stepped out\r\nby the river's side. I ought to mention that at intervals we passed\r\nthe remains of large chambers and other vaulted apartments, which must\r\nevidently have been prisons as dark and loathsome as any which Mrs.\r\nRadcliffe, or any other horror-loving romancer, could draw from a\r\nmorbid imagination. We had to return the same way.\r\n\r\nQuitting the palace, we passed through the part of the town which leads\r\nby the Marquis of Salvatierras' house, and went on to the fountain,\r\nwhich springs from the solid rock in the midst of the ravine. We\r\nthen returned homewards. In the evening our fair hostess amused us\r\nwith singing, dancing, and conversation. One night we had a party of\r\nGipsies, or, as they are called, Rectanos, to dance. They are a curious\r\nset of beings, and their habits are as strange as their appearance.\r\nThey, to me, were very plain, and of a brown color; the men very dark,\r\nwith long matted beards. They danced the fandangoe, in which a man and\r\nwoman get up, and moving castanets with their hands, performed such\r\nevolutions as, to speak in the mildest way, would greatly astonish\r\nEnglish spectators. I was much disappointed with it, as I saw nothing\r\ngraceful in their movements. All the time they were figuring and\r\nlifting their limbs, the party seated kept time with their castanets.\r\nAt intervals they sang when they were dancing, which reminded me of the\r\nnautch-girls in India. They would drink nothing except Rosaria, a sort\r\nof stuff distilled from limes, partaking, however, of sweetmeats which\r\nwere handed round to them, and which they relished so much, that they\r\nhad a scramble for them. The dress of the women was very gaudy, and of\r\nvarious colors.\r\n\r\nI did not think much of these people, but I like what I have seen of\r\nthe Spanish ladies very much. Their manners are lively, unaffected,\r\nand pleasing. The night after this, we went to a party which was given\r\nby some officers of another regiment. Here again I had an opportunity\r\nof seeing the manners of the Spanish ladies, which were certainly very\r\npleasing.\r\n\r\nThe next day at 11, we once more mounted our horses, and bidding adieu\r\nto our fair hostess, we left the town, the beauties of which have been\r\namply dilated upon by different writers. We pursued the same route as\r\nthat by which we came, and arrived at Gibraltar a few minutes after the\r\nevening gun gave notice of the time to shut the gates of the fortress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   From Chamber's Edinburgh Journal.\r\n\r\nVAGARIES OF THE IMAGINATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Fancy it burgundy,\" said Boniface of his ale--\"only fancy it, and\r\nit is worth a guinea a quart!\" Boniface was a philosopher: fancy can\r\ndo much more than that. Those who fancy themselves laboring under an\r\naffection of the heart are not slow in verifying the apprehension:\r\nthe uneasy and constant watching of its pulsations soon disturbs the\r\ncirculation, and malady may ensue beyond the power of medicine. Some\r\nphysicians believe that inflammation can be induced in any part of\r\nthe body by a fearful attention being continually directed towards\r\nit; indeed it has been a question with some whether the stigmata (the\r\nmarks of the wounds of our Saviour) may not have been produced on the\r\ndevotee by the influences of an excited imagination. The hypochondriac\r\nhas been known to expire when forced to pass through a door which he\r\nfancied too narrow to admit his person. The story of the criminal who,\r\nunconscious of the arrival of the reprieve, died under the stroke\r\nof a wet handkerchief, believing it to be the axe, is well known.\r\nParacelsus held, \"that there is in man an imagination which really\r\naffects and brings to pass the things that did not before exist; for a\r\nman by imagination willing to move his body moves it in fact, and by\r\nhis imagination and the commerce of invisible powers he may also move\r\nanother body.\" Paracelsus would not have been surprised at the feats\r\nof electro-biology. He exhorts his patients to have \"a good faith, a\r\nstrong imagination, and they shall find the effects.\" \"All doubt,\" he\r\nsays, \"destroys work, and leaves it imperfect in the wise designs of\r\nnature: it is from faith that imagination draws its strength, it is\r\nby faith it becomes complete and realized; he who believeth in nature\r\nwill obtain from nature to the extent of his faith, and let the object\r\nof this faith be real or imaginary, he nevertheless reaps similar\r\nresults--and hence the cause of superstition.\"\r\n\r\nSo early as 1462 Pomponatus of Mantua came to the conclusion, in his\r\nwork on incantation, that all the arts of sorcery and witchcraft\r\nwere the result of natural operations. He conceived that it was not\r\nimprobable that external means, called into action by the soul, might\r\nrelieve our sufferings, and that there did, moreover, exist individuals\r\nendowed with salutary properties; so it might, therefore, be easily\r\nconceived that marvellous effects should be produced by the imagination\r\nand by confidence, more especially when these are reciprocal between\r\nthe patient and the person who assists his recovery. Two years after,\r\nthe same opinion was advanced by Agrippa in Cologne. \"The soul,\" he\r\nsaid, \"if inflamed by a fervent imagination, could dispense health and\r\ndisease, not only in the individual himself, but in other bodies.\"\r\nHowever absurd these opinions may have been considered, or looked on as\r\nenthusiastic, the time has come when they will be gravely examined.\r\n\r\nThat medical professors have at all times believed the imagination\r\nto possess a strange and powerful influence over mind and body is\r\nproved by their writings, by some of their prescriptions, and by their\r\noft-repeated direction in the sick-chamber to divert the patient's\r\nmind from dwelling on his own state and from attending to the symptoms\r\nof his complaint. They consider the reading of medical books which\r\naccurately describe the symptoms of various complaints as likely to\r\nhave an injurious effect, not only on the delicate but on persons in\r\nfull health; and they are conscious how many died during the time of\r\nthe plague and the cholera, not only of these diseases but from the\r\ndread of them, which brought on all the fatal symptoms. So evident was\r\nthe effect produced by the detailed accounts of the cholera in the\r\npublic papers in the year 1849, that it was found absolutely necessary\r\nto restrain the publications on the subject. The illusions under\r\nwhich vast numbers acted and suffered have gone, indeed, to the most\r\nextravagant extent; individuals, not merely single but in communities,\r\nhave actually believed in their own transformation. A nobleman of the\r\ncourt of Louis XIV. fancied himself a dog, and would pop his head out\r\nof the window to bark at the passengers; while the barking disease at\r\nthe camp-meetings of the Methodists of North America has been described\r\nas \"extravagant beyond belief.\" Rollin and Hecquet have recorded a\r\nmalady by which the inmates of an extensive convent near Paris were\r\nattacked simultaneously every day at the same hour, when they believed\r\nthemselves transformed into cats, and a universal mewing was kept up\r\nthroughout the convent for some hours. But of all dreadful forms which\r\nthis strange hallucination took, none was so terrible as that of the\r\nlycanthropy, which at one period spread through Europe; in which the\r\nunhappy sufferers, believing themselves wolves, went prowling round the\r\nforests uttering the most terrific howlings, carrying off lambs from\r\nthe flocks, and gnawing dead bodies in their graves.\r\n\r\nWhile every day's experience adds some new proof of the influence\r\npossessed by the imagination over the body, the supposed effect of\r\ncontagion has become a question of doubt. Lately, at a meeting in\r\nEdinburgh, Professor Dick gave it as his opinion that there was no\r\nsuch thing as hydrophobia in the lower animals: \"what went properly by\r\nthat name was simply an inflammation of the brain; and the disease, in\r\nthe case of human beings, was caused by an over-excited imagination,\r\nworked upon by the popular delusion on the effects of a bite by rabid\r\nanimals.\" The following paragraph from the \"Curiosities of Medicine\"\r\nappears to justify this now common enough opinion:--\"Several persons\r\nhad been bitten by a rabid dog in the Faubourg St. Antoine, and three\r\nof them had died in our hospital. A report, however, was prevalent\r\nthat we kept a mixture which would effectually prevent their fatal\r\ntermination; and no less than six applicants who had been bitten were\r\nserved with a draught of colored water, and in no one instance did\r\nhydrophobia ensue.\"\r\n\r\nA remarkable cure through a similar aid of the imagination took place\r\nin a patient of Dr. Beddoes, who was at that time very sanguine about\r\nthe effect of nitrous acid gas in paralytic cases. Anxious that it\r\nshould be imbibed by one of his patients, he sent an invalid to Sir\r\nHumphry Davy, with a request that he would administer the gas. Sir\r\nHumphry put the bulb of the thermometer under the tongue of the\r\nparalytic, to ascertain the temperature of the body, that he might be\r\nsure whether it would be affected at all by the inhalation of the gas.\r\nThe patient, full of faith from what the enthusiastic physician had\r\nassured him would be the result, and believing that the thermometer was\r\nwhat was to effect the cure, exclaimed at once that he felt better. Sir\r\nHumphry, anxious to see what imagination would do in such a case, did\r\nnot attempt to undeceive the man, but saying that he had done enough\r\nfor him that day, desired him to be with him the next morning. The\r\nthermometer was then applied as it had been the day before, and for\r\nevery day during a fortnight--at the end of which time the patient was\r\nperfectly cured.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is nothing on record more curious of this kind than the\r\ncures unwittingly performed by Chief-Justice Holt. It seems that for\r\na youthful frolic he and his companions had put up at a country inn;\r\nthey, however, found themselves without the means of defraying their\r\nexpenses, and were at a loss to know what they should do in such an\r\nemergency. Holt, however, perceived that the innkeeper's daughter\r\nlooked very ill, and on inquiring what was the matter, learned that she\r\nhad the ague; when, passing himself off for a medical student, he said\r\nthat he had an infallible cure for the complaint. He then collected a\r\nnumber of plants, mixed them up with various ceremonies, and inclosed\r\nthem in parchment, on which he scrawled divers cabalistic characters.\r\nWhen all was completed, he suspended the amulet round the neck of the\r\nyoung woman, and, strange to say, the ague left her and never returned.\r\nThe landlord, grateful for the restoration of his daughter, not only\r\ndeclined receiving any payment from the youths, but pressed them to\r\nremain as long as they pleased. Many years after, when Holt was on the\r\nbench, a woman was brought before him, charged with witchcraft: she was\r\naccused of curing the ague by charms. All she said in defence was, that\r\nshe did possess a ball which was a sovereign remedy in the complaint.\r\nThe charm was produced and handed to the judge, who recognized the very\r\nball which he had himself compounded in his boyish days, when out of\r\nmere fun he had assumed the character of a medical practitioner.\r\n\r\nMany distinguished physicians have candidly confessed that they\r\npreferred confidence to art. Faith in the remedy is often not only half\r\nthe cure, but the whole cure. Madame de Genlis tells of a girl who had\r\nlost the use of her leg for five years, and could only move with the\r\nhelp of crutches, while her back had to be supported: she was in such\r\na pitiable state of weakness, the physicians had pronounced her case\r\nincurable. She, however, took it into her head that if she was taken\r\nto Notre Dame de Liesse she would certainly recover. It was fifteen\r\nleagues from Carlepont where she lived. She was placed in the cart\r\nwhich her father drove, while her sister sat by her supporting her\r\nback. The moment the steeple of Notre Dame de Liesse was in sight she\r\nuttered an exclamation, and said that her leg was getting well. She\r\nalighted from the car without assistance, and no longer requiring the\r\nhelp of crutches, she ran into the church. When she returned home the\r\nvillagers gathered about her, scarcely believing that it was indeed\r\nthe girl who had left them in such a wretched state, now they saw her\r\nrunning and bounding along, no longer a cripple, but as active as any\r\namong them.\r\n\r\nNot less extraordinary are the cures which are effected by some sudden\r\nagitation. An alarm of fire has been known to restore a patient\r\nentirely, or for a time, from a tedious illness: it is no uncommon\r\nthing to hear of the victim of a severe fit of the gout, whose feet\r\nhave been utterly powerless, running nimbly away from some approaching\r\ndanger. Poor Grimaldi in his declining years had almost quite lost the\r\nuse of his limbs owing to the most hopeless debility. As he sat one day\r\nby the bedside of his wife, who was ill, word was brought to him that a\r\nfriend waited below to see him. He got down to the parlor with extreme\r\ndifficulty. His friend was the bearer of heavy news which he dreaded to\r\ncommunicate: it was the death of Grimaldi's son, who, though reckless\r\nand worthless, was fondly loved by the poor father. The intelligence\r\nwas broken as gently as such a sad event could be: but in an instant\r\nGrimaldi sprung from his chair--his lassitude and debility were gone,\r\nhis breathing, which had for a long time been difficult, became\r\nperfectly easy--he was hardly a moment in bounding up the stairs which\r\nbut a quarter of an hour before he had passed with extreme difficulty\r\nin ten minutes; he reached the bedside, and told his wife that their\r\nson was dead; and as she burst into an agony of grief he flung himself\r\ninto a chair, and became instantaneously, as it has been touchingly\r\ndescribed, \"an enfeebled and crippled old man.\"\r\n\r\nThe imagination, which is remarkable for its ungovernable influence,\r\ncomes into action on some occasions periodically with the most precise\r\nregularity. A friend once told us of a young relation who was subject\r\nto nervous attacks: she was spending some time at the seaside for\r\nchange of air, but the evening-gun, fired from the vessel in the bay at\r\neight o'clock, was always the signal for a nervous attack: the instant\r\nthe report was heard she fell back insensible, as if she had been\r\nshot. Those about her endeavored if possible to withdraw her thoughts\r\nfrom the expected moment: at length one evening they succeeded, and\r\nwhile she was engaged in an interesting conversation the evening-gun\r\nwas unnoticed. By and by she asked the hour, and appeared uneasy when\r\nshe found the time had passed. The next evening it was evident that\r\nshe would not let her attention be withdrawn: the gun fired, and she\r\nswooned away; and when revived, another fainting fit succeeded, as if\r\nit were to make up for the omission of the preceding evening! It is\r\ntold of the great tragic actress Clairon, who had been the innocent\r\ncause of the suicide of a man who destroyed himself by a pistol-shot,\r\nthat ever after, at the exact moment when the fatal deed had been\r\nperpetrated--one o'clock in the morning--she heard the shot. If asleep,\r\nit awakened her; if engaged in conversation, it interrupted her; in\r\nsolitude or in company, at home or travelling, in the midst of revelry\r\nor at her devotions, she was sure to hear it to the very moment.\r\n\r\nThe same indelible impression has been made in hundreds of cases, and\r\non persons of every variety of temperament and every pursuit, whether\r\nengaged in business, science or art, or rapt in holy contemplation.\r\nOn one occasion Pascal had been thrown down on a bridge which had\r\nno parapet, and his imagination was so haunted for ever after by\r\nthe danger, that he always fancied himself on the brink of a steep\r\nprecipice overhanging an abyss ready to ingulf him. This illusion\r\nhad taken such possession of his mind that the friends who came to\r\nconverse with him were obliged to place the chairs on which they seated\r\nthemselves between him and the fancied danger. But the effects of\r\nterror are the best known of all the vagaries of the imagination.\r\n\r\nA very remarkable case of the influence of imagination occurred between\r\nsixty and seventy years since in Dublin, connected with the celebrated\r\nfrolics of Dalkey Island. It is said Curran and his gay companions\r\ndelighted to spend a day there, and that with them originated the\r\nfrolic of electing \"a king of Dalkey and the adjacent islands,\" and\r\nappointing his chancellor and all the officers of state. A man in the\r\nmiddle rank of life, universally respected, and remarkable alike for\r\nkindly and generous feelings and a convivial spirit, was unanimously\r\nelected to fill the throne. He entered with his whole heart into all\r\nthe humors of the pastime, in which the citizens of Dublin so long\r\ndelighted. A journal was kept, called the \"Dalkey Gazette,\" in which\r\nall public proceedings were inserted, and it afforded great amusement\r\nto its conductors. But the mock pageantry, the affected loyalty, and\r\nthe pretended homage of his subjects, at length began to excite the\r\nimagination of \"King John,\" as he was called. Fiction at length became\r\nwith him reality, and he fancied himself \"every inch a king.\" His\r\nfamily and friends perceived with dismay and deep sorrow the strange\r\ndelusion which nothing could shake: he would speak on no subject save\r\nthe kingdom of Dalkey and its government, and he loved to dwell on the\r\nvarious projects he had in contemplation for the benefit of his people,\r\nand boasted of his high prerogative: he never could conceive himself\r\ndivested for one moment of his royal powers, and exacted the most\r\nprofound deference to his kingly authority. The last year and a half of\r\nhis life were spent in Swift's hospital for lunatics. He felt his last\r\nhours approaching, but no gleam of returning reason marked the parting\r\nscene: to the very last instant he believed himself a king, and all his\r\ncares and anxieties were for his people. He spoke in high terms of his\r\nchancellor, his attorney-general, and all his officers of state, and of\r\nthe dignitaries of the church: he recommended them to his kingdom, and\r\ntrusted they might all retain the high offices which they now held. He\r\nspoke on the subject with a dignified calmness well becoming the solemn\r\nleave-taking of a monarch; but when he came to speak of the crown he\r\nwas about to relinquish for ever, his feelings were quite overcome, and\r\nthe tears rolled down his cheeks: \"I leave it,\" said he, \"to my people,\r\nand to him whom they may elect as my successor!\" This remarkable scene\r\nis recorded in some of the notices of deaths for the year 1788. The\r\ndelusion, though most painful to his friends, was far from an unhappy\r\none to its victim: his feelings were gratified to the last while\r\nthinking he was occupied with the good of his fellow-creatures--an\r\noccupation best suited to his benevolent disposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         From Household Words.\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH FLOWER GIRL.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was lingering listlessly over a cup of coffee on the Boulevard des\r\nItaliens, in June. At that moment I had neither profound nor useful\r\nresources of thought. I sat simply conscious of the cool air, the blue\r\nsky, the white houses, the lights, and the lions, which combine to\r\nrender that universally pleasant period known as \"after dinner,\" so\r\npeculiarly agreeable in Paris.\r\n\r\nIn this mood my eyes fell upon a pair of orbs fixed intently upon\r\nme. Whether the process was effected by the eyes, or by some pretty\r\nlittle fingers, simply, I cannot say; but, at the same moment, a rose\r\nwas insinuated into my button-hole, a gentle voice addressed me, and\r\nI beheld, in connection with the eyes, the fingers, and the voice, a\r\ngirl. She carried on her arm a basket of flowers, and was, literally,\r\nnothing more nor less than one of the _Bouquetières_ who fly along the\r\nBoulevards like butterflies, with the difference that they turn their\r\nfavorite flowers to a more practical account.\r\n\r\nFollowing the example of some other distracted _décorés_, who I found\r\nwere sharing my honors, I placed a piece of money--I believe, in my\r\ncase, it was silver--in the hand of the girl; and, receiving about five\r\nhundred times its value, in the shape of a smile and a \"_Merci bien\r\nMonsieur!_\" was again left alone--(\"desolate,\" a Frenchman would have\r\nsaid)--in the crowded and carousing Boulevard.\r\n\r\nTo meet a perambulating and persuasive _Bouquetière_ who places a\r\nflower in your coat and waits for a pecuniary acknowledgment, is\r\nscarcely a rare adventure in Paris; but I was interested--unaccountably\r\nso--in this young girl: her whole manner and bearing was so different\r\nand distinct from all others of her calling. Without any of that\r\nappearance which, in England, we are accustomed to call \"theatrical,\"\r\nshe was such a being as we can scarcely believe in out of a ballet.\r\nNot, however, that her attire departed--except, perhaps, in a certain\r\ncoquettish simplicity--from the conventional mode: its only decorations\r\nseemed to be ribbons, which also gave a character to the little cap\r\nthat perched itself with such apparent insecurity upon her head. Living\r\na life that seemed one long summer's day--one floral _fête_--with a\r\nmeans of existence that seemed so frail and immaterial--she conveyed an\r\nimpression of _unreality_. She might be likened to a Nymph, or a Naiad,\r\nbut for the certain something that brought you back to the theatre,\r\nintoxicating the senses, at once, with the strange, indescribable\r\nfascinations of hot chandeliers--close and perfumed air--footlights,\r\nand fiddlers.\r\n\r\nEvening after evening I saw the same girl--generally at the same\r\nplace--and, it may be readily imagined, became one of the most constant\r\nof her _clientelle_. I learned, too, as many facts relating to her as\r\ncould be learned where most was mystery. Her peculiar and persuasive\r\nmode of disposing of her flowers (a mode which has since become worse\r\nthan vulgarized by bad imitators) was originally her own graceful\r\ninstinct--or whim, if you will. It was something new and natural, and\r\namused many, while it displeased none. The sternest of stockbrokers,\r\neven, could not choose but be decorated. Accordingly, this new Nydia\r\nof Thessaly went out with her basket one day, awoke next morning, and\r\nfound herself famous.\r\n\r\nMeantime there was much discussion, and more mystification, as to who\r\nthis Queen of Flowers could be--where she lived--and so forth. Nothing\r\nwas known of her except her name--Hermance. More than one adventurous\r\nstudent--you may guess I am stating the number within bounds--traced\r\nher steps for hour after hour, till night set in--in vain. Her flowers\r\ndisposed of, she was generally joined by an old man, respectably clad,\r\nwhose arm she took with a certain confidence, that sufficiently marked\r\nhim as a parent or protector; and the two always contrived sooner or\r\nlater, in some mysterious manner, to disappear.\r\n\r\nAfter all stratagems have failed, it generally occurs to people to\r\nask a direct question. But this in the present case was impossible.\r\nHermance was never seen except in very public places--often in\r\ncrowds--and to exchange twenty consecutive words with her, was\r\nconsidered a most fortunate feat. Notwithstanding, too, her strange,\r\nwild way of gaining her livelihood, there was a certain dignity in her\r\nmanner which sufficed to cool the too curious.\r\n\r\nAs for the directors of the theatres, they exhibited a most appropriate\r\namount of madness on her account; and I believe that at several of the\r\ntheatres, Hermance might have commanded her own terms. But only one of\r\nthese miserable men succeeded in making a tangible proposal, and he\r\nwas treated with most glorious contempt. There was, indeed, something\r\ndoubly dramatic in the _Bouquetière's_ disdain of the drama. She who\r\n_lived_ a romance could never descend to act one. She would rather be\r\nRosalind than Rachel. She refused the part of Cerito, and chose to be\r\nan Alma on her own account.\r\n\r\nIt may be supposed that where there was so much mystery, imagination\r\nwould not be idle. To have believed all the conflicting stories\r\nabout Hermance, would be to come to the conclusion that she was\r\nthe stolen child of noble parents, brought up by an _ouvrier_; but\r\nthat somehow her father was a tailor of dissolute habits, who lived\r\na contented life of continual drunkenness, on the profits of his\r\ndaughter's industry;--that her mother was a deceased duchess--but,\r\non the other hand, as alive, and carried on the flourishing business\r\nof a _blanchisseuse_. As for the private life of the young lady\r\nherself, it was reflected in such a magic mirror of such contradictory\r\nimpossibilities, in the delicate discussion held upon the subject, that\r\none had no choice but disbelieve every thing.\r\n\r\nOne day a new impulse was given to this gossip by the appearance of\r\nthe _Bouquetière_ in a startling hat of some expensive straw, and of a\r\nmake bordering on the ostentatious. It could not be doubted that the\r\nprofits of her light labors were sufficient to enable her to multiply\r\nsuch finery to almost any extent, had she chosen; but in Paris the\r\nadoption of a bonnet or a hat, in contradistinction to the little cap\r\nof the _grisette_, is considered an assumption of a superior grade,\r\nand unless warranted by the \"position\" of the wearer, is resented\r\nas an impertinence. In Paris, indeed, there are only two classes of\r\nwomen--those with bonnets and those without; and these stand in the\r\nsame relation to one another, as the two great classes into which the\r\nworld may be divided--the powers that be, and the powers that want to\r\nbe. Under these circumstances, it may be supposed that the surmises\r\nwere many and marvellous. The little _Bouquetière_ was becoming\r\nproud--becoming a lady;--but how? why? and above all--where? Curiosity\r\nwas never more rampant, and scandal never more inventive.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I saw nothing in any of these appearances worthy, in\r\nthemselves, of a second thought; nothing could have destroyed the\r\nstrong and strange interest which I had taken in the girl; and it\r\nwould have required something more potent than a straw hat--however\r\ncoquettish in crown, and audacious in brim--to have shaken my belief in\r\nher truth and goodness. Her presence, for the accustomed few minutes,\r\nin the afternoon or evening, became to me--I will not say a necessity,\r\nbut certainly a habit; and a habit is sufficiently despotic when\r\n\r\n    \"A fair face and a tender voice have made me\"--\r\n\r\nI will not say \"mad and blind,\" as the remainder of the line would\r\ninsinuate--but most deliciously in my senses, and most luxuriously wide\r\nawake! But to come to the catastrophe--\r\n\r\n    \"One morn we missed _her_ in the accustomed spot\"--\r\n\r\nNot only, indeed, from \"accustomed\" and probable spots, but from\r\nunaccustomed, improbable, and even impossible spots--all of which\r\nwere duly searched--was she missed. In short, she was not to be found\r\nat all. All was amazement on the Boulevards. Hardened old _flaneurs_\r\nturned pale under their rouge, and some of the younger ones went about\r\nwith drooping moustaches, which, for want of the _cire_, had fallen\r\ninto the \"yellow leaf.\"\r\n\r\nA few days sufficed, however, for the cure of these sentimentalists.\r\nA clever little monkey at the Hippodrome, and a gentleman who stood\r\non his head while he ate his dinner, became the immediate objects of\r\ninterest, and Hermance seemed to be forgotten. I was one of the few who\r\nretained any hope of finding her, and my wanderings for that purpose,\r\nwithout any guide, clue, information, or indication, seem to me now\r\nsomething absurd. In the course of my walks, I met an old man, who\r\nwas pointed out to me as her father--met him frequently, alone. The\r\nexpression of his face was quite sufficient to assure me that he was on\r\nthe same mission--and with about as much chance of success as myself.\r\nOnce I tried to speak to him; but he turned aside, and avoided me with\r\na manner that there could be no mistaking. This surprised me, for I had\r\nno reason to suppose that he had ever seen my face before.\r\n\r\nA paragraph in one of the newspapers at last threw some light on the\r\nmatter. The _Bouquetière_ had never been so friendless or unprotected\r\nas people had supposed. In all her wanderings she was accompanied, or\r\nrather followed, by her father; whenever she stopped, then he stopped\r\nalso; and never was he distant more than a dozen yards. I wonder that\r\nhe was not recognised by hundreds, but I conclude he made some change\r\nin his attire or appearance, from time to time. One morning this\r\nstrange pair were proceeding on their ramble as usual, when passing\r\nthrough a rather secluded street, the _Bouquetière_ made a sudden bound\r\nfrom the pavement, sprung into a post-chaise, the door of which stood\r\nopen, and was immediately whirled away, as fast as four horses could\r\ntear--leaving the old man alone with his despair, and the basket of\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nThree months have passed away since the disappearance of the\r\n_Bouquetière_; but only a few days since I found myself one evening\r\nvery dull at one of those \"brilliant receptions,\" for which Paris is so\r\nfamous. I was making for the door, with a view to an early departure,\r\nwhen my hostess detained me, for the purpose of presenting to me a\r\nlady who was monopolizing all the admiration of the evening--she was\r\nthe newly-married bride of a young German Baron of great wealth,\r\nand noted for a certain wild kind of genius, and utter scorn of\r\nconventionalities. The next instant I found myself introduced to a pair\r\nof eyes that could never be mistaken. I dropped into a vacant chair by\r\ntheir side, and entered into conversation. The Baronne observed that\r\nshe had met me before, but could not remember where, and in the same\r\nbreath asked me if I was a lover of flowers.\r\n\r\nI muttered something about loving beauty in any shape, and admired a\r\nbouquet which she held in her hand.\r\n\r\nThe Baronne selected a flower, and asked me if it was not a peculiarly\r\nfine specimen. I assented; and the flower, not being redemanded, I did\r\nnot return it. The conversation changed to other subjects, and shortly\r\nafterwards the Baronne took her leave with her husband. They left Paris\r\nnext day for the Baron's family estate, and I have never seen them\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nI learned subsequently that some strange stories had obtained\r\ncirculation respecting the previous life of the Baronne. Whatever they\r\nwere, it is very certain that this or some other reason has made the\r\nprofession of _Bouquetière_ most inconveniently popular in Paris. Young\r\nladies of all ages that can, with any degree of courtesy, be included\r\nin that category, and of all degrees of beauty short of the hunch-back,\r\nmay be seen in all directions intruding their flowers with fatal\r\npertinacity upon inoffensive loungers, and making war upon button-holes\r\nthat never did them any harm. The youngest of young girls, I find, are\r\nbeing trained to the calling, who are all destined, I suppose, to marry\r\ndistinguished foreigners from some distant and facetious country.\r\n\r\nI should have mentioned before, that a friend calling upon me the\r\nmorning after my meeting with the Baronne, saw the flower which she had\r\nplaced in my hand standing in a glass of water on the table. An idea\r\nstruck me: \"Do you know anything of the language of flowers?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Something,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"What, then, is the meaning of this?\"\r\n\r\n\"SECRECY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          From the Antheneum\r\n\r\nTHE THREE ERAS OF OTTOMAN HISTORY[6]\r\n\r\n\r\nSo much has been said and written of late respecting the decline and\r\ndecrepitude of the Ottoman Empire, that most persons believe that\r\nthere is nothing to prevent a Russian army from marching up to the\r\ngates of Constantinople, and taking possession of the city, except\r\nthe resistance which might be offered by the other powers of Europe\r\nto such an extension of the Russian dominions. Many of our readers\r\nwill therefore be surprised to learn that the army of the Sultan is at\r\npresent in a more efficient state than it has been for the last two\r\ncenturies; and that in the event of a war breaking out between Russia\r\nand Turkey, the latter would probably be able to resist, single-handed,\r\nthe attacks of her formidable and ambitions neighbor. This is the\r\nview which Mr. Skene endeavors to establish in the pamphlet before\r\nus; and from information which we have ourselves received from other\r\nquarters, we entirely agree with the conclusion to which Mr. Skene\r\nhas come,--that \"the power of conquest, possessed by the only state\r\nwith which there appears the slightest possibility of a rupture taking\r\nplace, is in general as notoriously exaggerated as that of defence on\r\nthe part of Turkey is commonly undervalued.\" To enable the reader to\r\nobtain an accurate idea of the present condition of the Ottoman army,\r\nMr. Skene gives a brief but able review of its history. He divides\r\nhis narrative into three eras: the first contains an account of the\r\nmilitary history of Turkey till the destruction of the Janissaries in\r\n1825; the second comprises the period of transition, which followed the\r\ndestruction of the Janissaries; and the third comprehends the formation\r\nof the Nizam, or the regular army of the present day. The annals of the\r\nfirst of these eras are, in fact, the history of the Turkish conquests,\r\nand of the decline of the empire.\r\n\r\n[6] _The Three Eras of Ottoman History; a Political Essay on the late\r\nReforms of Turkey, considered principally as affecting her Position in\r\nthe event of a War taking place._ By J. H. SKENE, Esq. Chapman & Hall.\r\n\r\n\"Through the Janissaries Turkey rose--by them she was about to fall;\r\nand without the Nizam, or regular army of Sultan Abdul Medjid, which\r\nexists as a consequence of the destruction of the Janissaries, she\r\nwould never have had any chance of rising again, or even of saving her\r\npolitical independence.\"\r\n\r\nThe Janissaries were organized by Sultan Orkhan in the fourteenth\r\ncentury. They bore the title of _Yenitsheri_, or New Troops, in\r\ncontradistinction to the previous armies, which had been raised\r\nby levies of irregular troops, as occasion required. They were a\r\nwell-disciplined body of troops, and they constituted the principal\r\nforce of the empire. It was to their valor and efficiency that the\r\nTurkish empire owed its existence; and they were almost uniformly\r\nsuccessful in all the great battles which they fought till their defeat\r\nby Montecuculi at St. Gothard, in 1664. This defeat was the forerunner\r\nof a long series of disasters.\r\n\r\n\"Their career of conquest was over, and it was a career altogether\r\nwithout a parallel in history. Generation after generation had advanced\r\nwithout ever retrograding a single step. A vast empire had arisen out\r\nof the hereditary valor and systematic discipline of a portion of the\r\narmy. It was not the creation of the military genius of an individual\r\nlike that of Alexander the Great or Napoleon Buonaparte, but it was\r\nthe result of a successful organization, assisted by the inherent\r\nbravery of the Turkish race, which enabled their sultans to follow up\r\nfrom father to son the ambitious scheme of the founder of the dynasty.\r\nBut, at the close of that era of conquest, the organization of the\r\nJanissaries had become corrupt, the prestige of almost invariable good\r\nfortune had disappeared, and their internal discipline was declining\r\nfast, while their indomitable valor had degenerated into overweening\r\npride, seditious turbulence towards the government, and cruel tyranny\r\nover the population.\"\r\n\r\nTowards the end of last century the insubordination and tyranny of the\r\nJanissaries had reached their highest point. The dispersion of this\r\nformidable body had become absolutely necessary for the salvation of\r\nthe Ottoman empire; and it was at length effected by Sultan Mahmoud II..\r\n\r\n\"The value of the Janissaries as a regular army had been sufficiently\r\ntested, and the time had now arrived when Sultan Mahmoud II. judged it\r\nexpedient to cut the Gordian knot. He issued a proclamation, obliging\r\nall his troops to submit anew to the discipline which they had cast off\r\nfor more than a century and a half. The Janissaries refused obedience.\r\nThe Sultan unfolded the Sacred Standard of the Empire, and placing\r\nhimself, with his only son and heir, beside it, he appealed to the\r\npatriotism of those around him. He drew his dagger, and said, in a loud\r\nvoice,\r\n\r\n\"'Do my subjects wish to save the Empire from the humiliation of\r\nyielding to a band of seditious miscreants, or do they prefer that I\r\nshould put an end to that Empire by here stabbing my son and myself\r\nin order to rescue it from the disgrace of being trampled upon by\r\ntraitors?'\r\n\r\n\"He then ordered that the standard should be planted on the Atmeidan,\r\nor Hippodrome; crowds of people, from the highest to the lowest class\r\nof society, headed by the _Ullema_, or magistrates, and the _Softa_,\r\nor students, assembled round the standard, and, having heard what the\r\nSultan had said from those whom he had addressed, the mob, excited by\r\nenthusiasm, hurried away to carry the alarm through the town. All who\r\npossessed or could procure arms prepared them, and rushed to attack\r\nthe barracks of the Janissaries. The corps of artillery, having torn\r\noff the badges, which were also worn by those abhorred regiments, that\r\nall appearance of fellowship with them might at once be destroyed,\r\ncommenced the onslaught. Three hours, with 4000 artillerymen and\r\nstudents, incited by that resolute will, which had foreseen and\r\nprovided for every possible casualty during eighteen years of apparent\r\nsubmission to the tyranny of a _caste_, sufficed to annihilate the\r\nmilitary ascendancy which had once made the sovereigns of Europe\r\ntremble abroad, as it had the sultans at home. The attack, however,\r\nwas directed against only one side of the square, and the other three,\r\nas well as the neighboring gate of the town, were purposely left open,\r\nwith the view that those of the Janissaries who did not wish to resist\r\nthe Sultan's order might escape unharmed; and quarter was given to all\r\nwho chose to submit. Similar orders having been simultaneously sent to\r\nevery part of the empire where Janissaries were stationed, the same\r\nconditions were offered to 150,000 individuals affiliated to the corps.\r\nOf these only 3600 refused them, and they were the most incorrigible\r\nof the chiefs. Having been made prisoners they were tried by a regular\r\ncourt of justice, and it was only necessary to prove their identity\r\nin order to condemn them, as the Sultan had carefully compiled the\r\nproofs of their respective crimes during many years. Eighteen hundred\r\nof them were executed, of whom 600 at Constantinople, 1200 being put\r\nto death in the provinces; and the remainder were exiled. Although it\r\nmust have been an appalling sight to behold those 600 corpses lying on\r\nthe Atmeidan, one cannot help admiring the patriotism elicited on that\r\noccasion; when the Janissaries perceived it, they were stupified by the\r\nunexpected excitement of the people; and many fled, fully convinced\r\nof the impossibility of resisting those over whom they had hitherto\r\ndomineered with impunity.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sultan now set himself to replace the Janissaries by other regular\r\ntroops; but Russian ambition did not give him time to organize a new\r\narmy, and he was obliged to fight with his young and undisciplined\r\nrecruits against the \"veteran warrior-slaves of the Czar.\" The Ottoman\r\narmy was accordingly defeated; and the war was brought to a close by\r\nthe disastrous treaty of Adrianople. His successor, the present sultan,\r\nAbdul Medjid, has been more fortunate. He has enjoyed several years of\r\npeace, which have enabled him to form a powerful and well-disciplined\r\narmy, of which Mr. Skene gives us a valuable and interesting account.\r\nIt was established at the beginning of the year 1842:\r\n\r\n\"It is divided into six separate armies, called _Ordu_ in Turkish. Each\r\nof these consists of two services, the Active, or _Nizamia_, and the\r\nReserve, or _Rédiff_. The former contains two corps, under the command\r\nof their respective lieutenant-generals (_Férik_); and the latter, also\r\ntwo corps, commanded in time of peace by a brigadier (_Liva_); the\r\nwhole _Ordu_ being under the orders of a field-marshal (_Mushir_). The\r\ngeneral staff of each army is composed of a commander-in-chief, two\r\nlieutenant-generals, three brigadiers of infantry, one of whom commands\r\nthe reserve, two brigadiers of cavalry, and one brigadier of artillery.\r\nIn each corps there are three regiments of infantry, two of cavalry,\r\nand one of artillery, with thirty-three guns. The total strength of\r\nthese twelve regiments of the active force is 30,000 men, but it is\r\ndiminished in time of peace by furlough to an effective strength of\r\nabout 25,000 men in three of the six armies, and of 15,000 in the other\r\nthree, in consequence of the recruiting system being as yet incomplete\r\nin its application all over the Turkish Empire. The whole establishment\r\nof this branch amounts, therefore, to 180,000 men, belonging to the\r\nactive service, but its effective strength is at present 123,000. The\r\nreserve of four of the six armies consists in eleven regiments--six\r\nof infantry, four of cavalry, and one of artillery; composing a force\r\nof 212,000 effective soldiers, while the other two armies have not\r\nyet their reserve of soldiers who have served five years. In time of\r\nwar, however, the reserve would form two corps of 25,000 men in each\r\narmy; giving a total of 300,000 when this establishment shall have\r\nbeen completed. The two services, therefore, as they now stand, form\r\nan effective force of 335,000 men; and when their full strength shall\r\nhave been filled up it will amount to 480,000. Besides these six armies\r\nthere are four detached corps; one in the Island of Crete, consisting\r\nof three regiments of infantry and one of cavalry, in all 11,000 men;\r\nanother in the pashalik of Tripoli in Africa, composed of one regiment\r\nof infantry and one of cavalry, about 5,000 strong; a third at Tunis of\r\nthe same strength; and a fourth, which is the central artillery corps,\r\nformed of a brigade of sappers and miners with engineer officers,\r\nthe veteran artillery brigade, and the permanent artillery garrisons\r\nof the fortresses on the Hellespont, the Bosphorus, the Danube, in\r\nSerbia, on the Adriatic, the coast of Asia Minor, in the islands of the\r\nArchipelago, and on the southern shores of the Black Sea; in all 9,000\r\nmen. These four corps raise the effective strength of the standing\r\narmy to 365,000 men. Besides this addition, another augmentation of\r\n32,000 men will be realized by the submission of Bosnia and Northern\r\nAlbania to the new system; and a further increase of 40,000 men, whom\r\nSerbia has engaged to furnish, may be calculated, as well as 18,000\r\nmen serving in Egypt, who are destined to reinforce the reserve of the\r\nfifth army. The marines, sailors, and workmen, enrolled in brigades,\r\namount to 34,000 men; and the police force, picketed all over the\r\nEmpire, is nearly 30,000 strong. The grand total of armed men at the\r\ndisposal of Turkey, in the event of her existing resources being called\r\ninto play, may, therefore, be quoted at no less than 664,000 men,\r\nwithout having recourse to occasional levies, which are more easily and\r\nefficiently realized in Turkey than in any other country.\"\r\n\r\nThe service is popular; the troops are well paid, and their material\r\ncomforts are well provided for:\r\n\r\n\"The rations consist of meat, bread, rice, and vegetables in abundance\r\nevery day, besides butter or oil to cook them with.... The military\r\nhospitals might serve as a pattern of cleanliness to the first armies\r\nof the world, and the medical officers are now perfectly efficient,\r\nsome of them having studied at European universities, others\r\nhaving become proficients in their art at the medical college of\r\nConstantinople, and a few being foreigners. The health of the troops\r\nis consequently excellent; so much so, that on one occasion when 50\r\nmen out of 3450 were in hospital, it appeared so alarming to the staff\r\nof the garrison that a general consultation was held to decide on what\r\nsteps should be taken to oppose the progress of the sickness. One man\r\nin every seventy is no unusual occurrence in the hospitals of the\r\nBritish army; and as for the Russians, they thought little of 12,000\r\nwho died at Bucharest in 1829, 10,000 at Varna, and 6000 at Adrianople.\r\nThe Turkish clothing is excellent; it is strong and warm.\"\r\n\r\nRespecting their probable efficiency in the field, Mr. Skene remarks:\r\n\r\n\"In their evolutions the Turkish soldiers are rapid, especially the\r\ncavalry and artillery, whose horses are excellent; but there may\r\nperhaps be some room for improvement in their steadiness. It has been\r\nremarked of late at Bucharest, where the Turkish and Russian armies\r\nof occupations have their head-quarters, and are consequently often\r\nreviewed, that the latter were infinitely slower than the former,\r\nand that their light infantry drill was far inferior to that of the\r\nTurks, but when moving in line or open column, the Russians, stiff\r\nas planks and dreading the lash, kept their distances and dressing\r\nsomewhat better than the Turks. It may be added in illustration of the\r\nrespective solicitude of the two armies for the health of the men,\r\nthat, after one of these field days, three hundred Russians went to the\r\nhospital in consequence of exposure to the sun, and one hundred and\r\nsixty of them died, while there has not been a single instance of the\r\nkind amongst the Turkish troops.\r\n\r\n\"With such an army as this, formed by a nation whose inherent bravery\r\nhas never been impugned even by its most prejudiced detractors, it will\r\nreadily be allowed that, were the campaign of 1829 against the Russians\r\nto be fought over again now, the result would be very different,\r\nconsidering how many years the regular troops of the Sultan have been\r\nin training, and also how undeniably the Russian army has been falling\r\noff, for it was not then to be compared with what it had been in 1815,\r\nand it is not now equal to what it was in 1829.\"\r\n\r\nThe reserve of the army is organized in the following manner:\r\n\r\n\"The reserve of the Turkish army is organized in a peculiar manner.\r\nIt is composed of soldiers who have already served five years in the\r\nactive force, and who are allowed to remain in their native provinces\r\non furlough, and without pay, for seven years more, during which they\r\nassemble for one month of each year at the local head-quarters of their\r\nregiment, for the purpose of being drilled; and they then receive their\r\npay, as well as when they are called into active service in time of\r\nwar. This measure, which was dictated by a spirit of economy, has been\r\neminently successful, inasmuch as a considerable additional force is\r\nthus placed at the Sultan's command, without its being a continual\r\nburden to the State; and the efficiency of that force has been fully\r\ndemonstrated of late, when an army of 62,000 men was assembled by\r\nTurkey in the space of six weeks, on the occasion of the interruption\r\nof her amicable relations with Russia and Austria on account of the\r\nHungarian refugees. In another month, 200,000 men of the _Rédiff_\r\nmight have been collected at Constantinople had they been required;\r\nand it furnished matter for astonishment to the many foreigners in\r\nthat capital to behold a thoroughly drilled and disciplined army\r\nthus extemporized in a camp, to which a number of mere peasants in\r\nappearance had been seen flocking from their villages.\r\n\r\n\"This system is rendered still more complete by the practice of\r\nrecruiting regiments from the same districts, in order that, when\r\ntheir five years of active service shall have elapsed, the soldiers\r\nmay remain together: and the confusion occasioned by embodying\r\npensioners in other countries is avoided in Turkey, where the officers,\r\nnon-commissioned officers, staff, and rank and file of a regiment\r\ncontinue united, whether on active service or as forming a part of the\r\nreserve. They are engaged in agricultural pursuits, or in trade, during\r\ntheir seven years of furlough, being periodically mustered for military\r\nexercise, and always ready to move in a body on any point where\r\nreinforcements may be necessary, while a salutary feeling of _esprit de\r\ncorps_ is maintained by making such regiment a separate and distinct\r\nbody of men, raised in the same locality, and most of its members being\r\npersonally known to each other.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Skene does not give us any information respecting the skill and\r\nability of the superior officers. On this point we must confess we are\r\nnot without apprehensions; for however excellent and efficient the\r\ntroops of the line may be, their valor and discipline will be thrown\r\naway, if the higher officers--which we suspect to be the case--are\r\ninferior to those in the Russian service.\r\n\r\nThe threats of Austria give all this subject importance. Honest\r\nChristendom for the first time cries, God for the Turk!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Adventures of a Soldier in Mexico,\" in the\r\nUnited Service Magazine.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPTAIN AND THE NEGRO.\r\n\r\n\r\nA rather ludicrous circumstance, which occurred while we lay at\r\nNewport, helped to enliven the usual monotony of a ship's deck while in\r\nharbor. A comical sort of a fellow, of the name of Morris, belonging to\r\none of the companies on board, who used to sing Nigger songs, and who,\r\nbeing a very good mimic, could act the Nigger admirably, resolved to\r\nturn his talents to account by assuming the character while in harbor,\r\nand passing himself off among his comrades, except a few who were in\r\nhis confidence, as a black cook belonging to the ship--his twofold\r\nmotive for thus \"working the dodge,\" as he styled it, being partly the\r\nfun he expected from the mystification of the men and officers, and\r\npartly that he might be allowed to bring whisky into the ship, there\r\nbeing no hindrance to the ship's crew bringing goods on board, as our\r\nsentries could not interfere with them. Borrowing, therefore, an old\r\npair of canvas trousers, a Guernsey shirt, and tarpaulin hat from a\r\nsailor, and thoroughly engraining his face and hands with the sooty\r\ncomposition requisite to give him the true Ethiopian complexion, he\r\nbecame quite invulnerable to detection by his coat of darkness. In\r\nthis disguise, he rolled about the deck during the whole forenoon in a\r\npartial state of intoxication, and came and went between the vessel\r\nand shore, carrying baskets and parcels of suspicious import with the\r\nmost perfect impunity. Towards evening, he began to sing snatches of\r\nNigger songs, varying the exhibition with a \"flare-up\" jawing match\r\nwith some of the soldiers, in the sort of gibberish and broken English\r\nso peculiar to the woolly-headed sons of Ham. This comedy afforded\r\nconsiderable amusement, especially to those of his comrades in the\r\nsecret of his disguise. As he was dexterous in the tongue fence of\r\nthose encounters of rude wit, and knowing the chinks in the armor of\r\nhis opponents, he was sometimes able, by a seemingly careless though\r\ncunning thrust, to administer a sickener to their vanity, which was\r\nthe more galling as seeming to come from a dirty and half-drunken\r\nNigger. \"Ah, soger,\" he would say to some poor fellow whom he saw\r\ncasting a longing eye towards the busy thoroughfares of the city;\r\n\"captain not let you go ashore, eh? Too bad, eh? much sooner be black\r\nship's cook than soger.\" \"What's that you say, you Nigger?\" would most\r\nprobably be the reply of the soldier, not being in the best temper, and\r\nrather indignant at the idea of being an object of commiseration to a\r\nNigger. \"Who you call Nigger, eh? Nigger yourself, sar, more Nigger,\r\na good sight, than ship's cook, sar; ship's cook go shore when he\r\nplease, and get drunk like gentleman, sar; you a white soger Nigger,\r\nme black ship's cook Nigger--dat all de difference.\" Then, as if in\r\nsoliloquy, in a deprecatory tone, \"Eh! by Jorze, boff poor Niggers;\r\nsoger mos' as 'specable as colored Nigger when he keep heself sober\r\nand behave 'screetly, like color gemman.\" Stung and irritated by the\r\nmock sympathy of the Nigger, the soldier would now be for taking a\r\nsummary revenge out of his ignoble carcase, when some of the darkey's\r\nfriends would interpose, declaring that he was a good fellow, and they\r\nwould not see him ill-used. In the mean time, Morris was supposed\r\nby the orderly-sergeant of his company to be absent in town, and as\r\nsuch reported to the captain. Thus far, all had gone on swimmingly;\r\nbut there was a bit of a rather unpleasant surprise preparing for\r\nhim as the _denouement_ to this farce, which he had acted with so\r\nmuch success, which had probably not entered into his conception of\r\nthe character, but mightily increased the dramatic effect of the\r\nrepresentation as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe captain of his company, who was a bit of a humorist, either having\r\ndetected the masquerader himself, or having been informed by some\r\nbusy person of the strange metamorphosis which one of his men had\r\nundergone, it occurred to him that he had an opportunity of giving him\r\na taste of Nigger discipline, that might make him feel more vividly the\r\ncharacter he had been representing with so much applause. Sauntering,\r\naccordingly, along the deck, with his hands behind him, until he\r\narrived opposite the circle where Morris was exhibiting his antics,\r\nhe deliberately stepped forward and seized him by the collar, and,\r\npulling out a raw cowhide from behind his back, he began to vigorously\r\nbelabor poor darkey's shoulders. \"O Lor, massa! O Golly! What you trike\r\npoor debil for? What hell dis?\" shouted Morris, who had no idea that\r\nhe was discovered, and was willing to submit to a moderate degree of\r\nchastisement rather than drop his disguise at that particular juncture.\r\n\"You infernal grinning scoundrel,\" cries the captain, still vigorously\r\napplying the cowhide, \"I have been watching you quarrelling with and\r\naggravating my men all this afternoon; what do you mean, you black\r\nrascal, eh? Curse your ugly black countenance, I'll beat you to a\r\njelly, you scoundrel.\" As he still continued his discipline with the\r\ncowhide, showing no symptoms of speedily leaving off, Morris, who was\r\nsmarting with pain, at last began to think more of preserving his skin\r\nthan his incognito, and called out lustily, \"Captain! I say--stop! I\r\nam no Nigger--I am a soldier!\" At this there was a general burst of\r\nlaughter from the soldiers, who crowded round, and seemed to enjoy\r\nthe scene amazingly; those who did not know that Morris was actually\r\na soldier laughing still more obstreperously at the seeming absurdity\r\nof the Nigger's assertion. The captain, though evidently tickled,\r\nseemed in no hurry to let him go. \"Do you hear the impudence of the\r\nblack rascal? he says he is a soldier!\" said the captain, addressing\r\nthe men who were standing round. \"There, does he look like a soldier!\"\r\nhe continued, as he turned him round for inspection. \"Go along, you\r\nblack rascal, and don't let me catch you among my men again, or I will\r\ncertainly serve you out with a few more of the same sort.\" So saying,\r\nand administering a few parting salutations of the cowhide as he\r\nreleased him, the captain walked off, chuckling to himself at the joke,\r\nwhich I saw him relating afterwards to some of his brother officers,\r\nto their infinite mirth, if one might judge from the peals of laughter\r\nwhich his story elicited. In the mean time, Morris was fain to get\r\nrid of his Nigger character as quickly as possible: and having, with\r\nthe aid of warm water and soap, effected this, he made his appearance\r\non deck, and reported himself as having been asleep in the hold when\r\nthe roll was called. This the sergeant reported to the captain, who,\r\nsatisfied, it is probable, with the punishment he had administered with\r\nthe cowhide, affected to believe his statement, and sent him word by\r\nthe sergeant to take better care in future.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Holland was on his death-bed, his friend, George Selwyn,\r\ncalling to inquire how his lordship was, left his card.

A TRAVELLER'S STORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  I.\r\n\r\nThe dawn of a fine October morning, in 1817, was just breaking when\r\nthe Paris diligence of Messrs. Lafitte and Co. took the opportunity of\r\nbreaking also. That of the former, however, was as glorious as that\r\nof the latter was disastrous. I had been rambling during the summer\r\nmonths through that most interesting country; the volcanic district of\r\nAuvergne had laved both my inward and my outward man in most of the\r\ncelebrated waters which abound in that neighborhood, and was on my\r\nreturn to Paris, where I expected to find the friends with whom I had\r\ntravelled from England, and hoped to travel back again. It was then\r\nwith a light heart that I had, on the preceding evening, jumped into\r\nthe _coupée_ of the luckless vehicle at the little town of Gannât,\r\ncongratulating myself, firstly, on my good luck in finding a vacant\r\nplace at all, and secondly, on that place being in the _coupée_, and\r\nlastly, and most especially, on there being only one other passenger\r\ntherein, whereby, as all travellers by diligence are aware, I was\r\nspared the uncomfortable task of performing bodkin all the way to\r\nParis, and could take mine ease in mine own corner. When all prudential\r\narrangements for the night, such as air cushion disposed at back, and\r\ncloak drawn over knees, were duly made, I began to take a survey of my\r\nfellow-traveller, who had greeted me on my entrance with much civility,\r\nbut the light did not enable me to do more than perceive that he was a\r\nvenerable-looking old gentleman, whose white locks escaped from under\r\nhis travelling cap, and descended on his shoulders in great profusion.\r\nHis manners, however, were so courteous and dignified, that I, at once,\r\nrecognized in him a specimen of that now well-nigh obsolete race the\r\n_ancienne noblesse_. After sundry inquiries and observations on the\r\ncountry through which we were travelling, and divers speculations as to\r\nthe period at which our journey might possibly end, my fellow-traveller\r\nturned to the topic of the battle of Waterloo, then a recent event.\r\n\"Now,\" thought I, \"for a quarrel.\" But no; though he felt for the\r\ntarnished glory of the French arms, he felt yet more for the old\r\nfamily, and bore me no ill-will for being one of that nation by whose\r\nefforts they had been restored, and the Corsican usurper expelled.\r\nFrom these he reverted to the \"good old days\" of Louis XV., to whose\r\nbody of Gardes du Corps he had formerly, it seemed, had the honor of\r\nbelonging, he related many anecdotes of that period, and was especially\r\nprosy about the ceremonies observed at the court of that dissolute and\r\n_bien-aimé_ monarch. It was during a long story of this sort that I\r\nfell into a sound sleep, from which I was awakened by a loud crash, a\r\npretty considerable thump on the head, and a heavy weight pressing on\r\nmy chest, for all which phenomena, though startling at first, I was\r\nquickly able satisfactorily to account. The crash was caused by the\r\nponderous diligence coming into sudden and violent collision with the\r\nground; the thump by the same sort of rude contact between my head and\r\nthe roof thereof; whilst the weight which I felt so oppressive was\r\nthe body of my fellow-traveller, lying upon me in a state of complete\r\ninsensibility, and bleeding profusely. Freeing myself as gently as I\r\ncould from the apparently lifeless mass, I managed to get the window\r\ndown, and creep through the somewhat-narrow aperture, when the cause\r\nand full extent of the accident was intelligible enough. The iron arm\r\nof the axle of the near hind wheel had broken off short, and such\r\nwas the weight of luggage and packages of all kinds and descriptions\r\nstowed away on the roof, that, going, as I understand we were, at, for\r\na French diligence in those days, a rapid pace, the shock had been\r\nsufficient to completely capsize us. Sudden and severe, however, as\r\nthe shock had been, the lives and limbs of the passengers had escaped\r\nwithout loss or material damage; those in the interior being too\r\nclosely packed for any very violent collision with each other, and the\r\nthree individuals in the cabriolet, of whom the _conducteur_ was one,\r\nbeing pitched clean, I do not mean any reference to their persons, but\r\nto their mode of projection, into a ploughed field by the roadside,\r\nwhere they lay sprawling, and _sacréing_ and _mondieuing_, in the most\r\npiteous and guttural tones imaginable, though none appeared to have\r\nsufficient excuse for the unearthly noises he made from any actual hurt\r\nhe had sustained. I was, however, too anxious to afford help to my\r\ncompanion in the _coupée_, to ascertain very minutely their condition,\r\neven had I been able to obtain an answer to my inquiries, where all\r\ninsisted on talking at once and at the top of their voices, and in\r\na tone and with a vehemence which, in any other country, would have\r\nseemed a prelude to nothing short of a battle royal. Seeing, however,\r\na peasant, _en blouse_, standing hard by, leaning on his spade, and\r\nlooking quietly on, I concluded he was not one of the passengers,\r\nand might consequently be of some use. Accordingly I hailed him, and\r\nafter some irresolute gestures, he came up to me, when I explained,\r\nrather by dragging him to the door of the carriage than by any verbal\r\ncommunications, which would probably have failed, for what purpose I\r\nwanted his assistance. Having opened the door of the carriage, I looked\r\nin. There lay my unfortunate companion, \"his silver skin laced with his\r\ngolden blood,\" still insensible and somewhat cramped, it is true, but\r\nnot in so uncomfortable a position as might, under the circumstances,\r\nhave been expected, seeing that I had propped him up as well as I\r\ncould, before I made my own exit, with my air cushion, and that of the\r\nseat he had occupied. Being a tall and heavy man, to get him righted\r\nand out was a work of no small difficulty; however, our united efforts\r\nwere at last successful, and the poor sufferer was laid on the turf by\r\nthe roadside, on a couch formed of cushions, great-coats, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nMy assistant, who, I must say, now exhibited all the alacrity I could\r\nwish, and more handiness than I had expected from him, ran for water,\r\nwhilst I proceeded to examine my unlucky friend's wounds. He exhibited\r\nan ugly gash on the head, from which had flowed the stream of blood\r\nwhich had so disfigured his venerable locks. His left shoulder, too,\r\nI found was dislocated. By the plentiful application of cold water to\r\nhis head and temples, and of some hartshorn, which I happened to have\r\nabout me, to his nostrils, I at length succeeded in restoring him to\r\nconsciousness, of which the first symptoms he gave was to glare upon me\r\nwith an expression of terror and alarm, and exclaiming, in accents of\r\ndeep despair, \"Hah! blood!--more blood!\" He uttered a piercing shriek,\r\nand again relapsed into syncope. Thus assured, however, that he still\r\nlived, the present moment seemed so favorable for the reduction of the\r\ndislocated limb, that I set to work forthwith, and, with the assistance\r\nof my friendly _paysan_, quickly divested him of his coat, and having\r\nplaced him in a proper position, instantly slipped the joint into\r\nthe socket, and bound it with my neckcloth. The snap recalled him to\r\nsense, and by the help of a little brandy from my travelling flask,\r\nhe was completely restored. Still he surveyed me with a terrified\r\nlook, for which I could not well account, until I discovered that my\r\nface and dress were stained with the blood which had flowed from his\r\nwound whilst he lay upon me in the carriage. I hastened to remove what\r\nI conceived to be the cause of his anxious looks, by assuring him I\r\nhad received no injury whatever except a slight contusion not worth\r\nmentioning, and that the blood, which I washed off in his presence,\r\nwas his own. The next consideration was--what was to be done? To stay\r\nwhere we were was out of the question; no sort of public conveyance\r\nwould pass that way _en route_ to Paris until the second morning at\r\nthe same hour. My companion's wound required dressing, and I wanted\r\nmy breakfast, for the sharp air of the morning had so quickened my\r\nappetite, that the thoughts of my disaster were fast fading away\r\nbefore the vision of _café au lait_ and a _biftek_. The realization of\r\nthis pleasing prospect became the more probable when I learnt that we\r\nwere not more than a short league from the town of Moulins, whither I\r\ninstantly dispatched my trusty _paysan_, whose faculties and movements\r\nwere much quickened by the promise of a five-franc piece when he\r\nreturned with some sort of vehicle to convey us into the town. During\r\nhis absence, which lasted two mortal hours, I had abundant time to\r\nconsider and contemplate the person and demeanor of the individuals\r\nwhom chance had thus thrown in my way, and, as it were, upon my\r\ncharity. The former still exhibited sufficient traces of manly beauty\r\nto show that, in his youth, he had been strikingly handsome, whilst the\r\nlatter spoke the accomplished and high-bred gentleman in the truest and\r\nleast hackneyed acceptation of the word. Being now perfectly himself\r\nagain, he listened with much interest to such account of our accident\r\nas I was able to give, and, ascertaining from his bandaged head and\r\nshoulder the nature and extent of my services to him, his gratitude was\r\nexpressed in the warmest terms.\r\n\r\n\"I am the last of an ancient house,\" said he, \"and but for you should\r\nhave died on the road like a dog. I am the Marquis de Marigny, pray\r\ntell me to whom I am under so much obligation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, sir,\" said I, \"my name is D----, by profession a physician, and,\r\nat a pinch, a tolerable surgeon, and I never so congratulated myself\r\non my slender knowledge of this branch of the healing art as on the\r\npresent occasion.\"\r\n\r\nFurther conversation was interrupted by the arrival of the _paysan_\r\nwith a sort of rickety cabriolet, drawn by so small a horse, decorated\r\nwith so large a collar, and covered with such a profusion of trappings,\r\nthat, until he drew up beside us, and I could clearly distinguish the\r\nanimal's four legs, I was not quite sure that the vehicle did not\r\nprogress by some locomotive power of its own.\r\n\r\nHaving roused the _conducteur_, whom we found fast asleep amidst a\r\npile of disorganized packages, we selected our respective baggage,\r\nand, having secured it as well as we could on and about the cabriolet,\r\nI took an affectionate leave of the good _paysan_, and, mounting by\r\nthe side of my venerable companion, handled the ribbons and started.\r\nOur diminutive steed however required no great skill in coachmanship,\r\nnor any persuasion to get home again as quickly as the weight behind\r\nhim would permit, so that we soon arrived at the town where, our\r\narrival being expected, we found mine host of the Hôtel d'Allier and\r\nhis _domestiques_ on the alert; and, by the time I had made a hasty\r\ntoilette, a good breakfast, to which I did ample justice, was on the\r\ntable. Our meal being ended, and my companion complaining of a good\r\ndeal of pain, I set forth in search of an apothecary's shop, where I\r\nprocured the necessary materials; and his hurts having been properly\r\ndressed and bandaged, I advised him to go to bed and seek the repose he\r\nso much needed till dinner time. In the mean time I amused myself by\r\nwriting some letters and in strolling through and about the environs\r\nof this neat and lively town, which the pen of Sterne has rendered\r\nclassic ground. The evening was spent in my friend's bedroom, as he\r\nwas not well enough to join the party in the _salon_. Nevertheless he\r\nwas in good spirits, and very communicative; informed me that he was\r\nthe younger son of a noble family in Dauphiny, but that by the death\r\nof his elder brother, many years since, he had succeeded to the title\r\nand family estate, to which he had been paying a farewell visit when\r\nI joined him at Gannât. These family histories and sundry interesting\r\nanecdotes of the days of Louis XV. and XVI. so animated the old man,\r\nthat I, fearing the excitement in his present condition, thought it\r\nprudent to plead fatigue and retire to rest.\r\n\r\nBefore we parted, however, for the night, he made me promise that I\r\nwould not desert him on the morrow if he should not be able to travel,\r\nbut that I would accompany him to Paris, and take up my quarters with\r\nhim during my stay in that capital. The next morning I found him,\r\nthough much better, yet still unfit for a continuous journey of any\r\nlength. With the assistance, therefore, of our host, we engaged a\r\n_voiturier_ who, for a certain sum, agreed to take us to Paris by such\r\neasy stages as we might direct and find agreeable. To describe the road\r\nfrom Moulins to Paris would be to write a guide-book; suffice it to\r\nsay, that the weather was delightful, and my companion, who not only\r\nbore the journey well, but seemed to derive both health and spirits\r\nfrom this easy mode of travelling, was altogether the must amusing\r\ncompanion I had ever happened to meet with; insomuch, that I almost\r\nregretted, when we pulled up at the Barrière d'Italie on entering the\r\ngay capital of France, that our journey was at an end. We arrived\r\nabout four o'clock P. M., and drove straight to the Place Beauveau,\r\nwhere, without his order to the driver to stop, I should not have\r\nfailed to pitch upon his residence, so perfectly was it in keeping with\r\nthe appearance and character of its venerable owner. There prevailed\r\nthroughout the same air of antiquity; we were admitted by an ancient\r\nporter and received by another elderly domestic, well-nigh as venerable\r\nand aristocratic in his appearance as the master, who expressed in\r\naffectionate, yet respectful terms, the lively satisfaction he felt on\r\nagain beholding his _cher marquis_, whose arrival he had been expecting\r\nfor some days, and manifested the most touching anxiety when he saw the\r\ntraces, and heard a brief account of the accident which had befallen\r\nhim. My friend, having most courteously and cordially welcomed me to\r\nhis house, consigned me to the care of Antoine, as this ancient serving\r\nman was called, and by whom I was conducted to a suite of apartments,\r\n_au seconde_ it is true, but most comfortably and tastefully furnished\r\nin the Louis-Quatorze style of decoration. The walls were hung with\r\ntapestry, relieved at intervals by splendid mirrors and tables of\r\nrare marbles, whilst a bed, with green silk hangings, worthy of, and\r\napparently coeval with, Anne of Austria herself, promised me a night of\r\nluxurious repose.\r\n\r\nHaving, with Antoine's assistance, unpacked and arranged my wardrobe,\r\nI proceeded to dress for dinner, and my operations were scarcely\r\nconcluded ere he knocked at my door and announced that it was served.\r\nI immediately followed him down stairs to a spacious and well-lighted\r\n_salon_, where my friend awaited me. The repast to which we sat down\r\ngave me a very exalted opinion of the _savoir faire_ of my friend's\r\n_chef_. There was no _rosbif_, no _plomboudin_, no clumsy attempt\r\nat imitation of the English _cuisine_, out of compliment to me; all\r\nwas French, and all was perfect--the soup pure and restoring--the\r\n_côtellettes magnifiques_, and the _vol au vent superbe_. The Champagne\r\nwas _frappé_ to the minute, the Chambertin shed its _bouquet_, and the\r\nBordeaux of rare quality. Mine host ate and drank sparingly, but he did\r\nthe honors of his table in a manner so courteous, yet so jovial withal,\r\nthat our dinner was a protracted one, and it was late ere we retired\r\nto coffee in his library, an oblong room of noble dimensions, and so\r\nfurnished that it would have been called comfortable even in England,\r\nand elegant every where. The sides were covered with bookcases, whose\r\nshelves contained the best German, French, and Italian authors, and\r\na much larger assortment of English works than is usually found in a\r\nforeigner's collection. The ends were hung with some choice specimens\r\nof the old masters, and one or two of the modern French school, whilst\r\nhere and there on marble tables, or pedestals, stood some exquisite\r\npieces of sculpture, which showed to the greatest advantage under\r\nthe soft light of three lamps of the purest alabaster, which hung\r\nsuspended from the ceiling; in short, the aspect of the whole apartment\r\nproclaimed the owner to be a man of wealth, taste and literature.\r\n\r\nAmongst the pictures, I observed that a large one, which hung alone\r\nover the mantlepiece, was covered by a black crape veil or curtain.\r\nThis, of course, excited my curiosity; but as my friend, in describing\r\nthe others, never in any way alluded to it, I felt that inquiry was\r\nimpossible. In fact, he always contrived, or appeared to contrive, to\r\ndivert my attention when he perceived me looking in that direction.\r\n\r\n\"You see, sir,\" said he, \"that I do in some measure cultivate English\r\nliterature. I have read the works of most of your best writers, and\r\nflatter myself that I can almost taste and appreciate the beauties\r\nof your great poet Shakspeare. I have seen, too, your Siddons give\r\nvitality and form to the sublime conceptions of his genius. Her _Queen\r\nKatharine_ was noble, her _Constance_ touching, and her _Lady Macbeth_\r\nterrible. I shall _never_,\" continued he, in a low tone, and as if\r\ntalking to himself, \"_never_ forget it; it recalled too _vividly_,\" and\r\nhere, methought, his eye glanced at the veiled picture, when, suddenly\r\nstarting up, he fetched from one of the shelves the volume containing\r\nthat play, and read aloud some passages with a power and effect that\r\nquite surprised me. I was about to compliment him on the correctness\r\nof his conception and the force of his elocution, but he waived his\r\nhand, as if pained by the images produced on his mind by the scene\r\nhe had just read, hastily restored the book to its shelf, and turned\r\nthe conversation to some topic of the day, which, with other trivial\r\nmatter, occupied us till I proposed to retire. Shaking my hand warmly,\r\nmy friend jocularly expressed his hope that, \"as I had less on my\r\nconscience than Lady Macbeth, so I should rest better,\" and we parted\r\nfor the night.\r\n\r\nSleep, however, I could not, though my body was weary and my couch\r\nsoft. My mind had been strongly and strangely excited, as well by my\r\nhost's impassioned recital of Macbeth, as by the crape-clad picture,\r\nand I could not help fancying that there was some mysterious connection\r\nbetween it and the play. Thus I lay watching the flickering light\r\nemitted by the embers of my wood-fire, which was now fast dying away on\r\nthe hearth, until the pendule on the chimney-piece announced in silver\r\ntones that it was _three_ o'clock.\r\n\r\n\"I can endure this no longer,\" exclaimed I, \"see that picture I must\r\nand will. Every soul in the house is now buried in sleep; why should I\r\nnot steal down to the library and gratify my indomitable curiosity? If\r\nit be a breach of hospitality, it is surely a venial one? What can the\r\nold gentleman expect, if he will thus tantalize his guests?\"\r\n\r\nWhilst I thus reasoned with myself, I was busily employed in wrapping\r\nmy _robe de chambre_ about my person and in lighting my candle, and\r\nin one minute, I stood before the object of my waking dreams, and in\r\nanother the light was raised to its proper level and the crape thrown\r\nback; when, instead of some scene of blood, which my heated imagination\r\nhad conjured up, there stood revealed before my wondering eyes the\r\nportrait of one of the loveliest women I ever beheld. The head, set\r\ngracefully on exquisitely turned shoulders, exhibited a countenance in\r\nwhich sweetness and intelligence were intimately blended. The features,\r\nthough not what is termed regular, were most harmonious, and gave me\r\na clearer idea of Lord Byron's \"the mind, the music breathing from\r\nher face,\" than I had ever had before. Her dark chestnut hair, parted\r\nMadonnawise on her pale and thoughtful brow, fell in rich clusters down\r\nan ivory neck, and finally rested on a bosom \"firm as a maiden's, as\r\na matron's full.\" But it was the eyes that chiefly riveted my gaze.\r\nDeep and clear as one of Ruysdael's lakes, they seemed to reflect in\r\ntheir limpid mirror every surrounding object. At the first glance\r\ntheir expression was that of softness; but on fixing mine upon them as\r\nI did, in all the intensity of admiration, they seemed gradually to\r\nassume so stern an aspect, as if reproving my impertinent curiosity,\r\nthat I fairly quailed beneath their glance. Whilst I thus stood, rooted\r\nas it were to the spot, and lost in mingled feelings of admiration\r\nand wonder, not unmixed with a certain sensation of awe, a hand laid\r\ngently on my shoulder caused me to start round, and I beheld my friend\r\nstanding beside me. I was about to mutter some apology, but he stopped\r\nme, saying, \"It was my fault, I do not blame you. I ought to have known\r\nthat that veiled picture would excite your curiosity, and I ought not\r\nto have brought you here unless I was prepared to gratify it. But\r\nreturn to bed, and to-morrow you shall know my history and that of the\r\npicture now before you. I never yet imparted it to mortal ear, but as\r\nit will interest, and may possibly be useful to you in afterlife, you\r\nshall have it, as some return for the services you have rendered me.\r\nGood night.\" So saying he waived his hand in a friendly but somewhat\r\nauthoritative manner, and I betook myself to my apartment, a good deal\r\nabashed and ashamed of my adventure.\r\n\r\nIt was late the next morning when Antoine, presenting himself at my\r\nbedside, broke my slumbers, and with them the current of a dream of\r\nwhich the picture and the occurrences of the past night formed the\r\nbasis. He informed me he had just dressed his master, and tendered me\r\nthe like service, which, however, I declined, and proceeded, unaided\r\nand alone, to dress with all expedition. My friend received me in the\r\n_salon_, where we had dined the preceding day, with his usual benignant\r\nsmile; but it was easy to perceive that his night had not been passed\r\nin sleep. He looked languid and out of spirits, and our breakfast was\r\na somewhat silent one. When it was over, he sat awhile lost in deep\r\nthought, but at length, as if by sudden effort, he arose and took me by\r\nthe arm, saying, \"Allons, M.D., let us adjourn to the library, where I\r\nwill unburden my mind, and perform the promise of last night.\"\r\n\r\nThe picture was still uncovered, and we were no sooner seated than, as\r\nif fearing his resolution might give way, he immediately began thus:\r\n\r\nIn the year 1770 I had, as I have already informed you, the honor\r\nof belonging to that distinguished body the Gardes du Corps, and\r\nthough my duty required my almost constant presence at Versailles, I,\r\nnevertheless, had a lodging in this house, which is now mine. I had at\r\nthat time but little prospect of ever possessing a house of my own, and\r\ncould not always pay my rent for the room I then occupied therein. My\r\nfamily, of which I was the youngest, was rich, but I was poor, and have\r\noften gone without a dinner, because I had not wherewithal to pay for\r\none. I fell into debt, which my brother promised, some day or other,\r\nto pay; or I might, perhaps, get a rich wife, for we men of fashion,\r\nwhilst youth and good looks lasted, thought ourselves fairly entitled\r\nto use the folly of wealthy old dowagers as an instrument placed in\r\nour hands by Providence to enable us to revenge ourselves on Fortune\r\nfor her cruelty in making us younger sons. \"Remember,\" my father used\r\nto say to me, \"that there is nothing on which our good or ill-fate in\r\nlife so much depends as on women; we are in their hands; they manage\r\nus as they please; and it is the gentlest and the meekest who rule us\r\nthe most effectually.\" I, however, led a gay and thoughtless life, and\r\nnever troubled myself to inquire what influence, good or evil, women\r\nmight have on my future life. I had three occupations which took up all\r\nmy time--the ordinary routine of duty at Versailles; to pay assiduous\r\ncourt to the Prince de Beauveau, who honored me with his patronage, and\r\nfor which reason I chose my lodgings as near as I could to his hotel;\r\nand last, though not least, there was Mademoiselle Zephirine, _première\r\ndansuese_ at the Theatre Audinet. You smile, Mr. D., but recollect that\r\nI am now speaking of more than forty years ago. Ah! it was then no\r\nslight affair to keep a mistress, I assure you; for, though not allowed\r\nto hear one's name, she was to be openly acknowledged and as openly\r\nfought for when there was occasion. I had, for instance, to call out an\r\nofficer in the Swiss Guards, for presuming to say that Zephirine had\r\nfailed in one of her favorite and most admired _pas_. The Princess de\r\nBeauveau knew of the connection, and did not disapprove; so I practiced\r\nall the fashionable dances of the day, that I might qualify myself to\r\nappear as the partner of Zephirine at the public balls in Paris and at\r\nthe _fêtes champêtres_ at Versailles, where we danced on the verdant\r\ncarpet of the mossy turf. Zephirine had all the accomplishments and\r\ntastes that take the fancy of a sprig of fashion of that period; she\r\nfenced and rode beautifully; loved champagne suppers, and doted on all\r\nthe costly fineries of Madame Bertia's splendid show-room. In short,\r\nI ruined myself with so little thought and so much pleasure that I\r\nbelieved myself to be in love, and was quite sure that Mademoiselle\r\nwas as warmly attached to me; when, one evening, she came into my room\r\nhere,--this very room, my dear Mr. D., where we are now sitting, still\r\nattired in her theatrical costume, and with the stage paint not yet\r\nrubbed off her pretty face.\r\n\r\n\"Chevalier,\" said she, \"take care of yourself, your creditors are about\r\nto pounce upon you--yes, to arrest you. I learnt the fact not five\r\nminutes ago from an attorney's clerk, who makes love to my maid, and I\r\ncame in to--\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I sufficiently thank you, dearest,\" said I; \"and so for me you\r\nbrave even a prison, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, not exactly,\" replied she. \"You see, Chevalier, you have no\r\nlonger either cash or credit, and I should be a burden to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, at first I had thoughts of sharing your fallen fortunes, but a\r\nMonsieur Edmond, the son of an East India Director, has advised me to\r\nabandon my intention and accompany him to England; 'twill be a saving\r\nto you, and we are going to start immediately; our travelling-carriage\r\nwaits. Goodby, my dear chevalier,--_au revoir_!\"\r\n\r\nWith that she made a _pirouette_, and in three bounds was out of the\r\nroom. I ran, I flew, but Zephirine was too nimble for me, and I reached\r\nthe street just in time to see her jump lightly into the carriage of\r\nthe rich Englishman, and drive off at a gallop. To follow them--to\r\novertake the ravisher and force him to resign his prey, was my first\r\nimpulse; but, alas! I had no money, nor the means of borrowing any,\r\nand stood, moreover, in need of the kind intervention of the Prince de\r\nBeauveau between me and my importunate creditors. There was nothing\r\nfor it, therefore, but to digest the affront as well as I could. When\r\nmy mind became somewhat calmer, and I had pretty well got over the\r\njeers of my acquaintance, I began to ask myself if I had really loved\r\nZephirine, and if there had not been more vanity than passion in all\r\nthe follies she had led me to commit? The response was, that I had\r\n_not_ been in love with her, nor she with me. We both loved a jolly,\r\nrackety life--that was all; she was too flighty for affection, and I\r\ntoo dissipated for serious attachment. Besides, a man rarely allows\r\nhis whole mind and thoughts to be entirely engrossed by any woman; he\r\ncourts distraction in the variety of other occupations and tastes; all\r\npursuits, all channels of employment, are open to him; and if he be a\r\nsoldier, he is exposed to so many vicissitudes and dangers, and meets\r\nwith so many adventures, that all the passions are brought into play,\r\nand each in its turn so blunts and weakens the influence of the other\r\nthat none makes any durable impression. He abandons without scruple, a\r\nbeloved mistress for a wealthy wife, and speaks of it openly without\r\nshame or reserve, whilst a woman would blush at the bare idea of such\r\nan act. Woman's love lives on self-denial, grows by sacrifices, and\r\nexpands under the pressure of misfortune. I do not say that such is the\r\nlove of all women, but it is of that chosen few with whose feelings it\r\nis dangerous to trifle, and who are not to be cast off with impunity. I\r\nhave dwelt the more at length on my connection with Zephirine, because\r\nher name will re-appear in the course of the history of my first _real_\r\nlove. I was, however (continued M. de Marigny), more cut up by my\r\nmisfortune than I cared to confess, and had thoughts of quitting my\r\nlodgings in the Place Beauveau, and of having no other residence than\r\nthe barracks of the Gardes du Corps at Versailles, when one evening,\r\nat about eleven o'clock, as I was returning home, pondering upon the\r\nurgent importunities of my creditors, and my brother's slackness in\r\ncarrying into effect his promises and good intention towards me, I\r\nheard piercing shrieks proceeding from the very place whither I was\r\ngoing, and from the spot where it is crossed by a narrow street which\r\nleads into the Champs Elysées, then, neither paved, nor, as now,\r\nornamented by good houses on each side. I need hardly add that this\r\nstreet was as dark as pitch, whilst even the place itself was only\r\ndimly lighted by the flickering gleam of the one poor lamp which hung\r\nbefore the hotel of M. le Prince de Beauveau. I drew my sword, and ran\r\ntowards the spot whence the cries proceeded, but had scarcely gone\r\ntwenty yards before I stumbled over a lifeless body. I stretched out my\r\nhands, and caught by the arm a fainting female, who at the same moment,\r\nseemed to come to herself only to redouble her cries and lamentations.\r\n\r\n\"Help! help!\" cried she, in a voice choked by tears.\r\n\r\n\"Here is help, madame,\" said I; \"what is the matter--tell me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Help! they have slain this unhappy gentleman by my side.\"\r\n\r\nMy lodging being close by I ran and shook the great gate by repeated\r\nknocking, until I roused the porter and my own servant, cried murder,\r\nand, as at that hour of the night many of the inmates were not yet gone\r\nto bed, a light was soon procured, and all hastened to the scene of\r\nthe murder. There we found, stretched in a pool of blood, a young and\r\nhandsome female, her face whiter than the kerchief which encircled her\r\nblood-stained neck, her ears torn, her hands wounded, and close beside\r\nher the dead body of a man, somewhat older than herself, and which the\r\nneighbors speedily recognized as that of M. de Fosseux, a gentleman\r\nof some distinction at the bar, and who lived in the Place Beauveau,\r\nright opposite to my house. A general cry of horror burst from us\r\nall. The victim had been stabbed to the heart by a strong and steady\r\nhand, and the dagger--the instrument with which the crime had been\r\nperpetrated--had dropt from the wound, and was bathed in blood.\r\n\r\n\"There were two of them,\" cried the young lady, sobbing; \"one seized my\r\nhands, tore the ear-rings from my ears, and snatched my necklace from\r\nmy neck, whilst the other stabbed M. de Fosseux, who fell without a\r\ngroan. Ah! if they had but been content only to rob us!\"\r\n\r\nThen were the lamentations of the unhappy lady renewed, and she fell\r\ninto repeated swoons, from which she was recalled only to weep more and\r\nmore bitterly. We raised her up and carried her to her own house, or\r\nrather to that of M. de Fosseux, whither we also carried him, and sent\r\nfor a surgeon; but his help was useless; M. de Fosseux had long ceased\r\nto breathe. On receiving information of the occurrence, a lieutenant\r\nof police came instantly, and very speedily and satisfactorily decided\r\non a very evident fact, namely, that the sole object of the assassins\r\nhad been plunder, for M. de Fosseux had been robbed of his watch,\r\nhis purse, a valuable ring, the mark of which was still visible on\r\none of his fingers, and a pair of diamond buckles. Having satisfied\r\nhimself on this point, the officer next proceeded to the apartment\r\nof the young lady, whom he interrogated most strictly as to all the\r\ndetails and circumstances attending the commission of the deed. She\r\nreplied to all his questions with much self-possession, and the most\r\nexact precision--\"stated her name to be Eugenie d'Ermay, by birth a\r\ngentlewoman, and a native of Poitou; twenty-five years of age, and\r\nan orphan, without any private fortune; and,\" added she, casting her\r\neyes on the ground, \"I have lived for seven years with M. de Fosseux,\r\nwithout the sanction of the marriage tie.\" He, her sole protector, and\r\nthe only friend to whom she could look on leaving the convent where she\r\nhad been educated, had also been her seducer; but he introduced her to\r\nsociety and to the families of his friends, and that very evening they\r\nhad been supping with Madame la Comtesse de T----, and were returning\r\non foot, when, close to their own door, the above tragical event took\r\nplace. As to the deed itself, all had been effected with the utmost\r\nrapidity. Two men whom they had for some time observed to be following\r\nthem, suddenly rushed upon them--one of the two had seized her and held\r\nher fast, whilst he stripped her of her trinkets; the other laid hold\r\nof M. de Fosseux, had struck him a too sure and fatal blow, and robbed\r\nhim with a dispatch and address which showed an experienced hand; all\r\nthis had been but the work of an instant, and the two assassins had\r\nfled towards the Champs Elysées with such speed that they were already\r\nfar beyond pursuit before the unhappy lady suspected that he whom she\r\nloved was at all hurt, much less that he was killed.\r\n\r\n\"Did you observe,\" asked the police officer, \"if one of the men was\r\ntall and strongly made and had red hair, and the other short and\r\nhigh-shouldered?\"\r\n\r\nMademoiselle d'Ermay could not answer these questions; she felt\r\ncertain, however, that the man, who had killed M. de Fosseux was\r\ntall, and her impression was confirmed by the fact of the blow having\r\nevidently been struck from above downwards. There were at that time\r\nin Paris two highwaymen, one of whom was called Pierre le Mauvais,\r\nand the other Guillaume le Bossu. These worthies were the theme of\r\nmarket-places and wine-shops, and as every robbery and murder committed\r\nin the capital was attributed to them, this was of course laid at their\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nWhilst listening attentively to this examination, and marking the\r\nprofound grief of Eugenie--her deathlike paleness and her silent\r\ndespair--I could not but pity M. de Fosseux, whom cruel fate had thus\r\nsevered at the early age of thirty-two, not only from life, but from so\r\nyoung and lovely a companion. As Mademoiselle d'Ermay had mentioned\r\nthe name of the Comtesse de T----, the officer of police called upon\r\nthis lady in order to ascertain the truth of the statement as to her\r\nsupper party, and found it to be perfectly correct. The comtesse, as\r\nsoon as she heard of the sad event, hastened to assure Mademoiselle\r\nd'Ermay of her sympathy by every demonstration of kindness and\r\naffection, and, determined not to leave her in a house now become one\r\nof mourning, with the corpse of M. de Fosseux for her sole companion,\r\ninsisted on taking her instantly to her own. Mademoiselle d'Ermay\r\nconsented on one condition, namely, that she should be permitted once\r\nmore to look on him who had been the only object she had loved on\r\nearth. I was present at this last scene of this sad drama. Mademoiselle\r\nd'Ermay said nothing, but throwing herself on her knees by the side of\r\nthe bed on which they had laid M. de Fosseux, her hands convulsively\r\nclasped together and her head sunk on her breast, she was absorbed for\r\nsome minutes in fervent prayer, when, suddenly rising and turning to\r\nMadame de T----, she said, \"I am ready, madame.\" She then immediately\r\nquitted the house in that silence which is the surest sign of profound\r\naffliction, and having seen her safely conveyed to Madame de T---- 's,\r\nI took my leave.\r\n\r\nOn reaching my own abode, I fell into a reverie in which I could not\r\nhelp contrasting the attachment of such a woman as Mademoiselle d'Ermay\r\nwith the light and heartless nature of my connection with Zephirine.\r\nYet all my feelings revolted at the odious comparison. What? could I\r\nfor a moment, even in thought, place a young lady of good family, well\r\neducated, and whom the arts of a seducer, under the guise of a friend,\r\nhad betrayed into her first and only error--could I for an instant\r\nallow myself to place her in the same class with an opera-dancer? I\r\nhated myself for the very thought, which could never have suggested\r\nitself but to one who had never known any other sort of tie than such\r\nas had bound me to Zephirine--who had never been loved, nor ever felt\r\nthe genuine passion. I slept not that night, nor did I wish to sleep;\r\nmy mind was too fully occupied in recalling every movement, every\r\ngesture, every word that fell from the lips of Mademoiselle d'Ermay;\r\nher gentle countenance, her angelic look, and that brow so fair and\r\nso open, whose polished surface even terror the most appalling had\r\nnot been able to ruffle. Still I was not in love with her; I merely\r\ntried to recall her features, which the darkness of the night and the\r\nuncertain glimmer of candles had not enabled me to see and examine so\r\nperfectly as I could have wished. However, I promised myself better\r\nsuccess the next day, when I resolved to observe her with the closest\r\nattention, although I felt that in so doing I was rashly exposing\r\nmyself to that undefinable and seducing something which hung around her\r\nlike a charm.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nIt was, perhaps, the consciousness of the wish formed overnight that\r\ndetermined me to see Mademoiselle d'Ermay. Neither had I any desire to\r\nresist its power, but rather to feel it and succumb, for I was well\r\nassured, that if such a one could be won, she was worth winning. I\r\nshuddered when I reflected how few hours had elapsed since she had been\r\nexposed to the dagger of an assassin, and could not conceive how it had\r\nhappened that till that time I had never seen Mademoiselle d'Ermay,\r\nthough she was living close by me.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the family of M. de Fosseux caused seals to be placed\r\non all the property of the deceased, and with some difficulty allowed\r\nthe unfortunate lady to take away her clothes and some few trinkets,\r\nand a small sum of money, which beyond dispute was her own, it being\r\nfound in a desk on which her name was engraved, and of which she had\r\nthe key. That the family of M. de Fosseux should look upon her with no\r\nfriendly eye was, perhaps, natural enough. However, in a few days, the\r\nheir-at-law of the deceased waited upon her, and said,\r\n\r\n\"Mademoiselle, M. de Fosseux having been cut off thus suddenly, has\r\nleft no will; had he been able to foresee his death, there can be no\r\ndoubt that he would not have forgotten to make due provision for you;\r\nit therefore devolves on me, as a duty, to supply that defect, and to\r\nfulfil his intentions.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" replied Mademoiselle d'Ermay, \"I never asked anything from\r\nM. de Fosseux, nor ever expected anything; our connection was free\r\nfrom all pecuniary considerations, present or future; excuse me from\r\naccepting any thing.\"\r\n\r\nIn this refusal Mademoiselle d'Ermay was immovable. But to return to\r\nmyself. The next day I ventured to call on Mademoiselle d'Ermay, was\r\nadmitted, and became thoroughly aware how necessary was this second\r\ninterview, and better light to a due conception of her beauty. I have\r\nsaid beauty, but she was, in fact, what might be called lovely rather\r\nthan beautiful, sweetness being the leading characteristic of her\r\ncountenance, across which, calm and innocent as it was, an expression\r\nof archness would occasionally flit and vanish again into one of\r\nsoftness and repose. An acute physiognomist, perhaps, might have been\r\nled to suspect, from the form of the mouth and the compression of the\r\nlips, that the repose of Mademoiselle d'Ermay's features was the result\r\nof a strong will and a haughty spirit rather than a natural quality. Be\r\nthat as it may, to eyes untutored in that science this slight symptom\r\nwas not visible, and had no existence; whilst the simplicity and\r\nmodesty of her demeanor, and the perfect propriety of all her actions,\r\nwon every heart. Her grief was sincere, and her tears unaffected,\r\nyet she did not wear mourning for M. de Fosseux; and whilst none\r\ndoubted that she deeply regretted him, all applauded the good taste\r\nwhich restrained her from rendering her situation yet more remarked by\r\nassuming the outward trappings of woe.\r\n\r\nSome few days after the events of which I have just been speaking,\r\nMademoiselle d'Ermay hired a small room on the sixth floor in this very\r\nhouse. When I heard (continued M. de Marigny) that the woman who for\r\nthe last ten days had never been absent from my thoughts was living\r\nunder the same roof with myself, I experienced a sensation of pleasure,\r\nwhich was only alloyed by the necessity I was under of setting out that\r\nvery night for Versailles, whither my duty called me, and would detain\r\nme for some time. I was even on the point of resigning my commission;\r\nand but for the Prince de Beauveau, I really believe I should have\r\nadded this to the already pretty long list of my follies. Mere chance,\r\nhowever, enabled me to make my stay at Versailles serviceable to my\r\npassion, for, I must confess it, I loved Mademoiselle d'Ermay. I\r\nhappened one day to meet, in one of the ante-rooms of the palace, the\r\nComtesse de T----, who having an intimate friend amongst the queen's\r\nladies of honor, often came to Versailles. I seized the opportunity\r\nto ask her a multitude of questions about Mademoiselle d'Ermay, and\r\nascertained the following facts:\r\n\r\nMademoiselle d'Ermay, though originally of Poitou, was born at Noyou;\r\nher father, a man of rank, having spent his fortune at court, emigrated\r\nto America, leaving a young wife and his daughter Eugenie, then only\r\nsix years old, with very slender means of support. Death, ere long,\r\nbereft the daughter of her mother's care, when an old aunt brought\r\nher desolate condition under the notice of the Archbishop of Paris,\r\nby whose recommendation and influence she was placed in a convent\r\nin this capital, and received the usual education of a nun, which,\r\nthough it failed to stifle generous feelings in her bosom, it taught\r\nher to conceal them. Trained to keep the secrets of others she became\r\nimpenetrable as to her own, and hid a proud and resolved spirit under\r\nthe meekest possible exterior. Mistress of herself, her calmness and\r\npresence of mind never for an instant forsook her.\r\n\r\n\"You have seen,\" continued Madame de T----, \"how far Mademoiselle\r\nd'Ermay carries disinterestedness, and may thence infer how faithful\r\nand devoted a friend she is capable of being; but,\" added she, \"I have\r\na notion she _could_ be a most implacable foe.\r\n\r\n\"The superior of the convent where she was educated was a relation\r\nof M. de Fosseux, who often visited her, and thus had opportunities\r\nof seeing her youthful charge, and of ascertaining how much she was\r\nneglected and even ill-treated. Touched with compassion for her forlorn\r\ncondition, and smitten by her beauty, he found means of communicating\r\nwith her, avowed his sentiments, and won her heart. Nothing was easier\r\nthan to elope from the convent, as M. de Fosseux proposed; but the\r\nyoung lady at once rejected so romantic a mode of proceeding, and went\r\nto the superior and simply demanded her liberty. It might have been\r\nexpected that she would be asked what she was about to do, and whether\r\nshe was going; but as the old aunt had ceased to pay for her board, and\r\nEugenie was therefore a burden on the establishment, they allowed her\r\nto depart unquestioned. She immediately repaired to the house of M. de\r\nFosseux, and their connection was one of unmixed happiness until the\r\nlate fatal accident dissolved it. I have now told you all I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, madame,\" said I, \"your friend is, in fact, penniless?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say,\" answered the comtesse; \"it is a point on which Eugenie\r\nis obstinately silent; she has refused to stay with me, and I think she\r\nhas had too much experience of convent life ever to go there again; but\r\nI believe she has some secret but honorable resource which affords her\r\na decent maintenance. I have already told you that her father went to\r\nAmerica, where he died, and his daughter probably got whatever he left\r\nbehind him.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as I was off duty at Versailles I hastened back to Paris; and\r\nthe first thing I did on reaching my old lodging was to mount to the\r\nsixth floor, and present myself to Mademoiselle d'Ermay. I found her\r\noccupying three small rooms, one of which served her for kitchen, and\r\nthe one in which she received me was simply, and would have appeared\r\npoorly, furnished, but for the exquisite cleanliness and neatness,\r\nwhich gave it an air of elegance. After due inquiries concerning her\r\nhealth, I proceeded to congratulate myself on my good fortune in having\r\nthe happiness to be under the same roof; begged she would command my\r\nservices in any way in which they could be useful, and then hastened to\r\nchange the subject, for I saw refusal trembling on her lips.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry,\" said I, \"to see you in such apartments as these.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are quite consistent, sir,\" said she, \"with my slender means and\r\nthe state of my mind.\"\r\n\r\nI cast my eyes towards the window; she understood me, and, bursting\r\ninto tears, withdrew into the adjoining room to hide her emotion. In\r\nfact, from this window not only the Place de Beauveau and the house of\r\nM. de Fosseux, but even the windows of his apartments, were visible.\r\nIn a few minutes she reappeared, perfectly calm, with a serene and\r\neven smiling countenance. Never have I known a woman who had so much\r\ncommand over herself, or whose composure lent her such a charm. To see\r\nher and resist her sway was beyond the powers of mortal man, and I\r\nquitted her presence deeply in love, and resolved to leave no means\r\nuntried to gain her affections. At the same time I was quite aware that\r\nI could not hope for success under a considerable length of time, even\r\nif she had not really loved M. de Fosseux. To make a woman forget a\r\nfaithless lover is an easy task; to render her fickle, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, is an enterprise in which many succeed; but to efface\r\nthe recollection of so bloody a catastrophe, whilst pressing my suit\r\nin perhaps the self-same well-remembered words and expressions of its\r\nlamented victim, seemed so all but hopeless an undertaking, that it\r\nrequired the stimulus of the most ardent passion not to shrink from\r\nit in despair. I had, however, some chances in my favor; I was young,\r\nthough some years older than Mademoiselle d'Ermay; and as time has now\r\nshorn me of personal attractions, I may perhaps be allowed to boast\r\nthat I was considered a good-looking fellow; finally, in the eyes of\r\nsuch a woman as I then loved, I had one special recommendation--I\r\nwas poor. Now Mademoiselle d'Ermay, though caring little for the\r\nconventional rules of society, was scrupulous to the last degree in all\r\nthat related to sentiment, generosity and disinterestedness, insomuch\r\nthat the only circumstance which annoyed her in her connexion with\r\nM. de Fosseux was, that he was rich. All she required was the like\r\nabsolute devotion as that which she herself rendered. It was to such\r\na woman as this that, three months after the death of, M. de Fosseux,\r\nI hazarded a declaration of my passion. That I really felt what I so\r\nwarmly and so earnestly avowed, it required not a woman's sagacity to\r\nperceive. I had given up all my favorite amusements--no more riding\r\nand driving, no more evenings at the theatre, no more supper parties.\r\nI had become pale and thin, and felt assured that Mademoiselle d'Ermay\r\nwas at no loss to what cause to attribute such a change in my person\r\nand pursuits; neither did she affect to doubt the reality of a passion\r\nof which the proofs were so evident, nor did she attempt to deny that\r\nthe human heart was not made for eternal sorrow, or that time could not\r\nheal its deepest wounds, but she pleaded the very peculiar position in\r\nwhich her lot had placed her.\r\n\r\n\"Chevalier,\" said she, \"do not, I pray you, press me to return your\r\npassion. Love can no more find entrance into my bosom, and you know its\r\ndire consequences if it could: it is fatal--it is mortal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Banish,\" said I, in return, \"such sad recollections. Why regard\r\nyourself as the cause of an unhappy event to which you yourself had so\r\nnearly fallen a victim? I can understand your repugnance hereafter to\r\nwear, or to see worn by your friends, diamonds, or such valuables as\r\ntempt the plunderer, but to renounce love at your age, and with your\r\nbeauty, that were indeed too much, especially when you have inspired\r\nsuch a passion as mine; and oh! consider the difficulties, the trials,\r\nthe dangers inseparable from your present position, and tell me if,\r\ninstead of rejecting, you ought not, on the contrary, to seek some\r\none to whom you may look for assistance, and on whom you may rely for\r\nsupport?\"\r\n\r\nMademoiselle d'Ermay acknowledged all this to be true; nevertheless\r\nshe hesitated. At length, however, by dint of love and perseverance, I\r\nsucceeded in weakening her objections, and in satisfying her scruples,\r\nand she consented to receive my addresses. She even confessed that I\r\nwas not indifferent to her; but when with expressions of love I mingled\r\npromises and oaths of eternal fidelity.\r\n\r\n\"Have a care,\" said she. \"I ask nothing; I require nothing; but\r\npromises are, in my eyes, sacred matters. You are lavish of oaths--if I\r\naccept them, I shall look on them as binding. Is there not some ancient\r\npoet who says that \"Jove laughs at lovers' perjuries?\" I am more severe\r\nthan Jove. I give you fair warning, M. le Chevalier.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is the lover,\" added M. de Marigny, \"who, under like\r\ncircumstances, does not redouble all the oaths his mistress seems to\r\ndoubt? Where is he who would hesitate to swear that he is the most\r\ntruthful and constant of men? Who would not vow _eternal_ love to\r\n_such_ a woman?\"\r\n\r\nMy old friend here raised his hands and his eyes to the picture before\r\nus, and remained for some moments in an attitude of deep and silent\r\nadmiration. At length he slowly withdrew both, and with a deep sigh\r\nresumed his narration.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle d'Ermay consented, but reluctantly, and with the ill grace\r\nof a woman who yields in spite of herself; however she did yield,\r\nand quitted her apartments on the sixth floor for mine on the first.\r\nFrom that moment, my friend, I knew the bliss of being loved, and\r\nloved too without jealousy or quarrels, but with a sweet, constant,\r\nand equable flow of affection which I had not hitherto believed to be\r\npossible. No thought of the past, no anxiety for the future, seemed to\r\nhave any place in Eugenie's mind; but happy in the conviction of my\r\nlove, she manifested towards me as much attachment and even passion as\r\nshe had exhibited hesitation and reserve on consenting to my wishes.\r\nNever, by any chance, did she allude to past events, nor did the name\r\nof M. de Fosseux ever escape her lips. I was proud of my conquest;\r\nprouder of the passion I had inspired--a passion which she did not\r\nfeign, but feel. There was no pouting, no jealous freaks, none of\r\nthose ebullitions of temper which so disturb the peace and harmony of\r\neven the most attached couples: she was always in the same mood; her\r\ncountenance always serene, her words always sweet and soothing; nay,\r\nmore, my circumstances were, as I have told you, embarrassed; and I was\r\nso deeply in debt, that I owed even the freedom of my person to the\r\ninterposition of the Prince de Beauveau, when Mademoiselle d'Ermay\r\nundertook the management of my affairs, called on my creditors in\r\nperson, examined their claims, obtained time for payment, struck out\r\nusurious demands; and, when my brother at length thought proper to come\r\nto my aid, paid the stipulated sums to each with such business-like\r\naccuracy, that my creditors gave me no further trouble, and in a\r\nvery short space of time I was completely free from all claims and\r\nincumbrances. She held that a gentleman's word should be his bond,\r\nand that no other security ought to be necessary or required. When I\r\nreflected on the change which had taken place in the course of my life,\r\nand on the growing ascendancy which Eugenie exercised over me, and\r\nwhen I saw my foolish fancies and ill-formed plans give way, as they\r\ncontinually did, before the influence of her firm and well-regulated\r\nmind, I blushed to think how poor a figure I made, and what a mere\r\npuppet I was in the hands of a clever but imperious woman. Far from\r\nseeing love in all the care she bestowed upon me, I saw only a spirit\r\nof domination which hurt my pride. Even Zephirine, the opera-dancer,\r\ndeceiving and abandoning me as she did at the very moment when I was\r\nharassed by debts contracted for and by her, had less deeply wounded my\r\nself-love than did Mademoiselle d'Ermay in thus devoting herself to my\r\ninterests. Such is man! vain and ungrateful! Such, however, were her\r\npowers of fascination, that I could not help loving her, and whilst I\r\nthus yielded to her sway, I had, as you see, this one secret feeling in\r\nmy bosom which I could not impart to her. How soon was I to be guilty\r\nof other wrongs towards her! My elder brother died, and I became the\r\nhead of the family. I became rich, too, and might also lawfully claim\r\nthe title of marquis instead of that of chevalier. Will you believe\r\nthat I said nothing of all this to Mademoiselle d'Ermay? I sighed for\r\nliberty; I wanted to enjoy my accession of fortune without her privity,\r\nand to spend my money unrestrained by her good sense and unchecked by\r\nher prudence. I went secretly to my agent and gave him instruction as\r\nto my affairs, and all without saying one word to the woman who, till\r\nthat moment, had known my most secret thoughts, and was accustomed to\r\nread my very looks. I thought of the figure my fortune would enable me\r\nto make at the gaming table, which Mademoiselle d'Ermay had prevailed\r\non me to give up, and in all those pleasures which a Garde du Corps\r\nof fortune can enjoy with his comrades. For these purposes it was\r\nnecessary that I should resume my duty, from which I had been absent on\r\nleave for nearly a whole year, and I announced my intention accordingly.\r\n\r\n\"You choose your time ill,\" said Eugenie, in a quiet tone; \"if you\r\nresume service you must be less with me, and it is not prudent to quit\r\nthe citadel at the very time it is attacked.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I asked an explanation of these last words, this was (continued\r\nM. de Marigny), the substance of what she told me; and, that you may\r\nunderstand their import, I must tell you, that before the year 1789,\r\nthe higher classes of our clergy were composed of the younger sons\r\nof noble families, who were in the receipt of large incomes from the\r\nChurch; and the bishops and canons of those days, endowed as they were\r\nwith fat livings and rich abbeys, did not think themselves at all\r\ncalled upon to reside on their several preferments, but lived in Paris\r\nand about the court, where their course of life was not always strictly\r\nevangelical. One of them, whose name I shall not mention, as it is\r\nnot material to my story, had remarked Mademoiselle d'Ermay. What had\r\nparticularly taken his fancy, as he said in a letter which Eugenie put\r\ninto my hands, was her youthful and ingenuous countenance, her retiring\r\nmanners, her love of seclusion, and her modest yet animated style\r\nof conversation. He made her splendid offers, to which he attached\r\nthis one condition only, namely, that their intercourse should be a\r\nprofound secret; and, he added, that in leaving me she would, moreover,\r\nsilence the scandalous reports which had so long been circulated to her\r\ndisadvantage.\r\n\r\n\"It was Tartuffe,\" said M. de Marigny, with a bitter laugh; \"trying\r\nto wean Elmire from the gallants of the court, by offering her love\r\nwithout scandal, and pleasure without danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" said Eugenie, when she showed me this letter, \"that even\r\nif I were free to accept an offer, and this right reverend gentleman\r\npleased me, I could never stoop to such a mere bargaining as this; but\r\nI love you, my friend, and you alone, and I show you this letter only\r\nbecause we have no secrets from each other.\"\r\n\r\nThus, at the very moment when she was sacrificing for my sake an ample\r\nand secure provision, I, on my part, was concealing from her my new and\r\naltered position in life; yet at the same time I knew she had nothing,\r\nfor her father was not dead, as Madame de T. supposed, and had never\r\nsent her a single _sou_. I was on the point of confessing all; but\r\nfalse shame restrained me, and I set off for Versailles. I was like a\r\nman who vainly endeavors to break his bonds.\r\n\r\nWhen I quitted Eugenie and galloped through the Champs Elysées and up\r\nto the quarters of my troop I breathed freely. I felt I was at liberty;\r\nbut twenty-four hours had hardly elapsed ere I grew weary of this same\r\nliberty and longed to see Eugenie again, and to resume that yoke of\r\nwhich I was ashamed I knew not why, for it was easy, and had become\r\nnecessary to me. What would have become of me if Eugenie had accepted\r\nthe offers of that libertine priest and left me! So in the middle of\r\nthe night I mounted my horse and went back to Paris. I found her, as\r\nusual, thinking of me, and hoping, if not expecting, my speedy return.\r\nI then took to play, but its chances failed to excite me. I suffered\r\nmyself to be dragged out to those supper parties which I had once found\r\nso pleasant, but it was only to cast my eyes round the circle in search\r\nof _her_, and when they found her not, nor ever rested on a face so\r\nbeaming as hers, weariness soon crept over me, and I found the dishes\r\ntasteless, the wine vapid, and the conversation dull.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while, I had reached that period of life at which ambition\r\nbecomes a ruling passion, and mine was to be rich. Without rendering\r\nme avaricious, Mademoiselle d'Ermay had taught me to know the value\r\nof money. I had known poverty and endured most of its attendant\r\nprivations, and I was now in the possession of a large and unexpected\r\nfortune, but I wanted more. Just at this time I received a letter from\r\nmy mother.\r\n\r\nM. de Marigny here paused for a moment and appeared lost in thought;\r\nhe was like a man who hesitates to finish the story he has begun, and\r\nwho, having disclosed one half of his secret, has some misgiving as to\r\ntelling the other half, when, suddenly seizing my hand and looking me\r\nfull in the face.\r\n\r\n\"Sir!\" said he, in a tone of voice so solemn that it sent the blood\r\nback to my heart, and caused my not very weak nerves to tremble; \"I\r\nwas considering whether I ought not to require you to swear that you\r\nwill never reveal to any mortal ear what I am about to relate (the\r\nperspiration stood in large drops on his venerable forehead); but 'tis\r\nno matter--I have begun and I will finish--my story may be useful as a\r\nlesson and a warning to others.\"\r\n\r\nHe went on.\r\n\r\nMy mother suggested, that as the period of mourning for my brother\r\nwas over (alas! wishing to conceal that event from Eugenie I had not\r\nworn any), it was time to look into the affairs of a family of which\r\nI was now become the head. She advised me to resign my commission in\r\nthe Gardes du Corps as an idle sort of life without any chance of\r\npromotion, and, as if she had read my thoughts, added, that I had\r\nnothing to do but to enjoy my wealth and at the same time increase\r\nit, for which there was a ready mode and present opportunity. It was\r\nthis. She had selected for my brother the best match in the county--the\r\nmarriage was fixed, the settlements agreed upon, and the contract\r\ndrawn, when his death deranged all; why should not I carry into effect\r\nso well-formed and advantageous a plan? The young lady in question\r\nhad known but little of my brother; she had no attachment to him, and\r\nmerely married him because her family wished it. She was, moreover,\r\nyoung, pretty, and very rich. My mother urged me to quit Paris without\r\ndelay, and come and secure a match which would double my fortune. Being\r\nthirty years of age, and completely my own master, I did not consider\r\nobedience, especially in such a matter, a duty I owed to the commands\r\neven of a mother; but I saw in the proposal an opportunity which might\r\nnever again offer of breaking bonds which every day became tighter,\r\nand more and more wounded my pride. Besides, the _money_, the _money_\r\ntempted me. \"Why,\" said I to myself, \"should I not be able to love\r\nthis pretty girl whom they propose I should marry? She is, perhaps,\r\neven handsomer than Mademoiselle d'Ermay; and who knows but she may\r\nlove as well, and without subjecting me to that sort of sway I feel\r\nso onerous?\" I reflected, too, on the false position in which I was\r\nplaced. I lived with a mistress, of whom I was not the first lover, but\r\nonly the second. Nevertheless, I knew Mademoiselle d'Ermay's character\r\nso well, was so fully assured of her inviolate fidelity, and still\r\nfelt so much attached to her, that I could not make up my mind one way\r\nor the other, and was in a most lamentable state of indecision. I had\r\nwithout much difficulty thus far concealed from her the death of my\r\nbrother; but if I absented myself and went into Dauphiné, though only\r\njust to look at the lady proposed for my wife, she would guess all,\r\nand, on my return, my contemplated abandonment would be repaid by her\r\ntaking leave of me for ever. Some plausible pretext for leaving her\r\nwas therefore necessary--a mission, or something of the sort, from\r\ngovernment, on business in the north of France, whilst I hastened to\r\nthe south, and tried to find in the love beaming from other eyes a\r\nrelease from that which had hitherto chained me to Paris. The absolute\r\nnecessity of concealing this new secret made me a totally different man\r\nto what I was wont to be. I became moody and abstracted; and, whilst\r\nbrooding in silence over my own thoughts, and fondly fancying that I\r\nnever betrayed myself by even a gesture or hasty word, Mademoiselle\r\nd'Ermay had divined the whole, and was tracking with unerring sagacity,\r\nand into the inmost recesses of my soul, all my wavering resolves. She\r\nsaw my timid spirit halting between herself and a rich wife, whilst\r\nharboring, perchance, some vague fancy for change. For so it is; we\r\nare never content with that which we have, but we want more, or we\r\nwant something else, and are always wanting to be happy in some other\r\nway than that in which we are so. Eugenie, herself impenetrable,\r\nread my heart as if a book; yet she lavished upon me the same tokens\r\nof affection, and always received me with the same sweet and calm\r\ndemeanor. At length, one day, when I was in my study, debating with\r\nmyself how and where I should answer my mother's letter, Mademoiselle\r\nd'Ermay entered, every feature of her sweet round face elongated and\r\nsharpened and fixed in frightful rigidity; her soft eyes glared, her\r\nrosy lips were bloodless. I thought she was suddenly seized by illness,\r\nor that some cruel accident had affected her reason. She appeared to\r\nstagger, and I was rising from my seat to support her, when her hand,\r\nlaid on my shoulder, pressed me back again into my chair. The skirt of\r\nher dress was turned up as high as her waist, and within its folds her\r\nclenched hands held something which, at each movement she made, sounded\r\nlike the small stones in a child's rattle.\r\n\r\n\"Is it you, Eugenie?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is I. Do not you know me? _I_ am not changed; _I_ am still the\r\nsame.\"\r\n\r\nSo she said; but it was no longer the same woman. Her very voice was\r\naltered, a Gorgon, a Megæra stood before me.\r\n\r\n\"Eugenie! Eugenie!\" cried I.\r\n\r\nShe looked at me steadfastly, and as though the innermost thoughts of\r\nmy mind were written on my forehead; and the first words she uttered\r\nfully apprised me that she knew one of my secrets.\r\n\r\n\"M. le Marquis,\" said she: she knew my brother was dead. \"M. le\r\nMarquis,\" she continued, in hoarse accents; \"listen to me. I have never\r\nmentioned M. de Fosseux to you, and you do not know his story. I must\r\ntell it you. I was the inmate of a convent, young and fair, unhappy\r\nit is true, but pure of heart and discreet in conduct. I might, like\r\nmy companions, have taken the veil and passed my life in a cloister,\r\nwithout either pain or pleasure. M. de Fosseux saw me, and fell in love\r\nwith me. You can never know what pains he took, what arts he practised\r\nto seduce me, for I was then a virtuous girl, and my reputation, was\r\nwithout spot; and though I do not reproach myself for what I have\r\ndone--yet I well know that in the world I have judges more severe than\r\nmy own conscience.\"\r\n\r\nI made a second attempt to rise; not that I at all foresaw what was\r\ncoming, but merely for the purpose of saying a few words to calm her,\r\nbut she promptly shut my mouth by fiercely commanding me to listen.\r\n\r\n\"So pressing were his instances, so solemn his oaths, that they\r\nconvinced me of the violence and sincerity of his passion. I listened\r\nand believed, and he prevailed. Yes, M. le Marquis, I believed his\r\noaths of fidelity. I loved him; not so well as I love you; still I\r\nloved him. Alas, marquis! I ask you, for you know well, be it pride or\r\nbe it self-devotion, what have I ever required in return for my love?\r\nNothing but a steadfast observance of the faith pledged to me, and you\r\nhave not now to learn how I have kept that which I myself plighted. I\r\nask no contract; I demand no guarantee. I live upon the present without\r\none thought of the past, or one anxiety for the future, confiding in\r\nthe _honor_ of the man I love with a feeling of security, which is at\r\nonce my joy and my pride; faithful, I never asked but for faith; and,\r\npoor as I am, have I not rejected offers to be rich? Thus much then\r\nhave I done for you and for M. de Fosseux; but M. de Fosseux deceived\r\nme; he ceased to love me, he was in treaty for a wealthy bride, and,\r\ncowardly as perfidious, heaped upon me the outward signs and tokens of\r\na love he no longer felt; and why? Because he wished not to abandon me\r\ntill the last moment--because he wished to deceive me until he could no\r\nlonger wear a mask. This, marquis, was what M. de Fosseux intended to\r\ndo, and this was what he would have done had he lived one week longer.\r\nI knew the name of his betrothed; and I knew the amount of the dowry to\r\nwhich the cupidity of my lover was about to sacrifice me. Now, marquis,\r\nwhat did such perfidy deserve? What was a woman to do who had asked\r\nnothing, exacted nothing, and to whom so much had been promised? Her\r\nprospects blasted and her honor lost--a cherished inmate of your home,\r\nwhilst the fancy lasts; but appetite once satiated, turned out without\r\none----. This the return for all her constancy and devotion: disgrace,\r\nbase desertion, and, as if injury were not enough, you add mockery and\r\ninsult, by smiling in her face whilst you are preparing to pierce her\r\nto the heart.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst thus speaking (continued M. de Marigny), the looks of\r\nMademoiselle d'Ermay assumed a yet more fierce expression, her voice\r\nbecame hoarser, her gestures more violent, and, with her increased\r\nagitation, whatever she had folded up in her dress returned a yet more\r\nalarming sound.\r\n\r\nAs for me, frightened, appalled, my hands trembling, and my forehead\r\nbathed in a cold sweat, I attempted to mutter something, I knew not\r\nwhat. No, never did Clairon, nor Dusmenil, nor your Siddons, whom I had\r\nseen some years before in England, so freeze my blood in the deepest\r\ntragedy. Struck by the resemblance between my own conduct and that of\r\nM. de Fosseux, I at length exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"Eugenie! Eugenie! of whom are you speaking? What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of whom am I speaking? Of M. de Fosseux to be sure. What other man\r\ncould be capable of a similar crime--of such base perfidy? Do you\r\nimagine it to be possible that there can be in the world two men so\r\nheartless--so utterly devoid of honor?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Eugenie,\" exclaimed I again; \"No! I will never abandon\r\nyou--_never_----\"\r\n\r\n\"And who is talking of _you_, marquis?\" retorted she sharply; \"I am\r\nspeaking of M. de Fosseux.\"\r\n\r\nI could not believe my eyes; my ears, too, nay all my senses seemed in\r\ncombination to deceive me. I would have given all I was worth for some\r\nof the servants to enter and dissolve the spell.\r\n\r\n\"I am speaking to you of M. de Fosseux,\" repeated she. \"Do you\r\nremember, marquis, the day--or rather the night--on which we met for\r\nthe first time? _That_ man dead at my feet--myself stretched in the\r\ngory mire of the Place Beauveau--the dagger yet in the dead man's\r\nbreast--the blood with which I was covered--my cries, my tears, my\r\nbruised neck, my torn ears, my story of two robbers, my swoons, my\r\nsobs.... Do you remember all this, marquis? Well, then, 'TWAS I--'TWAS\r\nI, I tell you!\"\r\n\r\nAt these last words I uttered a loud cry, and was about to rush out of\r\nthe room, but she held me fast.\r\n\r\n\"'Twas I, I tell you; _alone_ I struck the traitor, and here are my\r\nproofs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Saying this, she opened her hands, and shook her dress, when brilliant\r\nbuckles, a necklace of rubies, diamond rings, and a gold watch, rolled\r\nglittering on the floor, and seemed to hem me in on all sides with\r\ntheir sparkling points, whilst in the midst of these bloody relics lay\r\na letter, which I instantly recognized as my mother's!\r\n\r\n\"Mr. D----,\" said the old man to me--who was motionless, and scarcely\r\ndared to draw my breath--\"I have been an old soldier, and, thank God!\r\nwas never looked upon as a coward; many is the time I have boldly faced\r\ndanger, and have, too, exposed my life through mere fool-hardiness; but\r\na man may have courage, yet not all kinds of courage; I was frightened,\r\nMr. D----; the blood rushed to my head, my hair stood on end, my\r\ntemples throbbed audibly, and I fell senseless on the floor.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I came to myself (continued M. de Marigny) I found myself in bed;\r\na copious bleeding had removed all immediate danger, and I seemed as\r\nthough awaking out of a troubled sleep, in which I had been haunted by\r\nsome fearful dream. Mademoiselle d'Ermay was at my side, with her sweet\r\ncountenance, her words of love, and her tender and affectionate looks,\r\nand held both my hands in hers. Tears were stealing down her fair\r\ncheeks, and as soon as I opened my eyes she threw herself into my arms.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! chevalier,\" said she, \"what an alarm you have caused me! Cruel\r\nman! to go into your own room without saying you were ill, and remain\r\nthere alone and without help! Oh, my friend! however troublesome you\r\nmay think me, I will never leave you again--I will follow you even\r\ninto your study; but, my dear chevalier, I hope you will believe me in\r\nfuture.\"\r\n\r\nBelieve you! (exclaimed I) starting up. She laid me down again, and\r\nreplaced my head on the pillow. Ah! said she to herself, there is still\r\nsome delirium here; and then, addressing me.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my chevalier, _believe_ me. What has been my advice to you for\r\nthese several days past? Has it not been to lose a little blood this\r\nspring time?--yet you would not be prevailed on to follow it. Your\r\nphysician himself says that one bleeding would have saved you your\r\nillness, and me my fright. I do hope, chevalier, you will be more\r\ndocile next spring.\"\r\n\r\nI shut my eyes, and essayed to retrace in thought all the circumstances\r\nof the scene under which I had so recently sunk. Though my head was\r\nconfused, and my body weak, I recalled every thing present and past. My\r\nmemory carried me back to the Place Beauveau--again I saw the features\r\nof M. de Fosseux pale in death, and Mademoiselle d'Ermay's look of\r\ndespair. Moreover, as a principal witness in the unhappy business,\r\nhaving been the first person who arrived at the spot where the murder\r\nwas committed, I was examined by the magistrate, and had read over\r\nMademoiselle d'Ermay's deposition, in which she had described the\r\nseveral articles of the stolen jewelry with the greatest accuracy. I\r\nthen mentally compared this careful and exact description, as given\r\nin the said deposition, with the articles which Eugenie had thrown\r\ndown before me, and I seemed to see and recognize them all: a gold\r\nenamelled watch, a necklace of rubies, diamond ear-rings, rings set in\r\nbrilliants, and ... my mother's letter! I had hidden that letter in a\r\nsecret drawer in my desk, which the maker of it had shown me alone how\r\nto open, and he was dead before I knew Eugenie; yet that letter had\r\nfallen at my feet! I saw the black seal, and thought I read the address\r\nin my mother's handwriting. It was impossible I could have dreamt all\r\nthis! Another idea dwelt painfully on my mind: I have already told\r\nyou the murder of M. de Fosseux was generally attributed to two men\r\nof desperate character, Pierre le Mauvais and Guillaume le Bossu. The\r\npolice had diligently followed this scent, and, after tracing them to\r\nvarious haunts, at last succeeded in capturing both; but they proved,\r\nmost clearly and incontestably, that they were both at Ronen on the\r\nnight of the murder, and all the other researches of the police had\r\nbeen in vain. Knowing all these circumstances as I did, they now\r\nrecurred to my mind in such force as to bring on a fresh attack and\r\nanother fit, which had obliged them again to call in my surgeon. What\r\nhe found it necessary to do I know not; I only know that the result was\r\nlong doubtful, and that nothing could equal the sorrow and assiduous\r\ncare of Mademoiselle d'Ermay so long as that doubt lasted. At length\r\nI came to myself.... She was at the foot of my bed, and in that sort\r\nof half-sleep which will sometimes overtake even the most wakeful\r\nand indefatigable nurses. I but partly opened my eyes, and carefully\r\navoided making the slightest noise or movement. Her head rested on\r\none of her hands, leaving somewhat more than the side-face and her\r\nfair cheek, now blanched by anxiety and watching, and the beautiful\r\nhair that hung in clustering curls over her white forehead, open to my\r\nview. Sleep often betrays our most secret thoughts, and the stuff of\r\nwhich dreams are made is sometimes revealed by involuntary movements.\r\nI narrowly watched her countenance; but no, there was nothing--she\r\nslept as calmly as a child. \"_She! she!_\" said I to myself--\"_she_\r\ncommit a murder! Could that white and delicate hand grasp a poniard,\r\nand strike the man she loved a deadly blow, and that too in the middle\r\nof the night, and in the open street? Why, the most practised villain,\r\nthe commonest stabber, is not so sure of his aim as to be certain that\r\nhis victim will fall without uttering one cry, and expire without\r\nknowing the hand that slays him; and that Eugenie should dare to feel\r\nmore confidence in herself than such men do! and that she should\r\nnever exhibit any symptoms of remorse! That I, who was so constantly\r\nwith her, should never by any chance have detected any signs of a\r\nguilty conscience! never have found her low-spirited or absorbed in\r\nthought!\" ... But I had seen her in my study--I had heard her terrible\r\nconfession--the rattling of the jewelry as it fell from her dress on\r\nthe floor, still sounded in my ears! Perhaps, however, I had dreamt all\r\nthis--perhaps this cruel vision, this horrible phantasmagoria, instead\r\nof being the cause, had been the first symptom of my disorder? If so,\r\nfrom what source had my imagination drawn these bloody horrors? How\r\nhad my heart and mind been able to engender such frightful calumnies\r\nagainst the best of women? True, I was thinking of emancipating\r\nmyself from Eugenie's yoke, and of leaving her, in order to marry\r\nadvantageously; but even whilst I was planning our separation I did\r\njustice to the angelic sweetness of her nature; and so far was I from\r\nsupposing her capable of committing a crime, that I thought with regret\r\nof how many good and noble qualities I was about to deprive myself the\r\ncontemplation and example in leaving her.\r\n\r\nSome days before the occurrence I have just narrated (added M.\r\nde Marigny), one of my servants cut himself in moving a piece of\r\nfurniture, and Eugenie, who happened to be present, nearly fainted at\r\nthe sight of the blood; and when I joked her about her weakness, the\r\nwound not being at all serious, \"Chevalier,\" said she, \"do not laugh\r\nat me; you know I cannot bear to see even a chicken killed.\" I had,\r\nindeed, remarked that, though in housekeeping affairs she was always\r\nactive and vigilant, she never went into the kitchen. I was in a\r\ndreadful state of uncertainty, for, in spite of all my reasonings on\r\nthe subject, there was still the fact--I _had_ seen her--I _had_ heard\r\nher; it was _herself_ beyond all doubt. Twice had her hand, pressing on\r\nmy shoulder, pushed me back into my chair. The more I tried to banish\r\nthese recollections, the more they crowded upon me; and whilst thus\r\ntortured by these anxious speculations, I made a hasty movement as she\r\nawoke.\r\n\r\n\"You then, of course,\" said I, interrupting his narrative for a moment,\r\n\"demanded an explanation of her terrible confession?\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible, my good friend,\" replied he; \"I was by no means sure of my\r\nown sanity, and Mademoiselle d'Ermay would have treated such a demand\r\nas the ravings of delirium.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very ill, my dearest chevalier,\" said she; \"your mind has\r\noften wandered since yesterday, and as the dreams of a sick man\r\ncommonly take their color from his waking thoughts, I have discovered,\r\nwhilst listening to the indistinct mutterings which fell from you\r\nin sleep, that there is one sore place in your heart. You love me,\r\nchevalier, truly and sincerely. I know you do,--but you are jealous!\"\r\n\r\n\"Jealous!\" cried I, in a feeble voice.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--but of the past; you have no doubt of my feelings towards you\r\nnow,--you do me that justice; but you are afraid that I loved M. de\r\nFosseux yet better.\"\r\n\r\n\"M. de Fosseux! M. de Fosseux! for God's sake, Eugenie, do not\r\npronounce that name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? Since yesterday it has been continually in your mouth, and you\r\nhave scarcely ever ceased to utter it and speak of him with bitterness.\r\nAh! my friend, let the dead rest in peace: you must have observed that\r\nfrom the first moment of our connection, I never mentioned or alluded\r\nto M. de Fosseux,--you must have made me forget him. Oh! believe me,\r\nmy chevalier, I swear--and you know how sacred I hold an oath--I never\r\nloved M. de Fosseux as I love you. Do not then allow such painful\r\nfancies to harass you; think how happy we are--as happy as it is\r\npossible to be in this world,--so happy that every body envies us.\"\r\n\r\nIn saying this, her lovely face lighted up with a heavenly smile,\r\nexpressive of love and contentment; and if a small but almost\r\nimperceptible cloud did rest for an instant on her calm brow, it was\r\neasily accounted for by her anxiety for me. At length one morning I\r\nawoke, and, not without a certain degree of satisfaction, perceived\r\nthat I was alone. She was not there. I rang the bell, and a servant\r\ncame.\r\n\r\n\"Your mistress?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mademoiselle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, mademoiselle; where is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mademoiselle is at church; it is Sunday,\" answered the servant.\r\n\r\nShe was attending divine service at the church of St. Roch, as she\r\nnever failed to do both on Sundays and saints' days.\r\n\r\nI dismissed the servant, rose hastily, threw on my dressing-gown, and,\r\nwith unsteady step, hurried to the desk in which I had locked up my\r\nmother's letter. The desk was untouched. At the very part of it where\r\nthe drawer was so skilfully contrived, and of which I alone possessed\r\nthe secret, there were some grains of dust, clearly proving that the\r\nmysterious spring had not been touched for a long time. I opened it,\r\nand there lay my mother's letter, exactly as I had, with my own hands,\r\nplaced it! Astonished and confounded, I went to Mademoiselle d'Ermay's\r\nroom. Her keys were on her dressing-table; _she_ had neither suspicions\r\nnor secrets! I searched every where, turned every thing topsy-turvy.\r\nNot a hole nor corner did I omit to rummage; and I shuddered the while,\r\nfor I was every moment expecting to find the watch, the rubies, and the\r\ndiamonds which I had seen, or fancied that I saw, scattered before me\r\non the floor of my study. But no, there was nothing of the sort. Was\r\nit, then, a dream--a frightful illusion, and the mere forerunner of my\r\nillness? By some strange contradiction, or some magnetic power which a\r\nstrong will exercises over a feeble one, I felt that I loved Eugenie\r\na hundred times better than ever, and crawled back again to my bed,\r\nconvinced that I had been mistaken, and the victim of a fearful dream.\r\nI then considered the case in another point of view, and asked myself\r\nwhether, even supposing Mademoiselle d'Ermay to be guilty, she had not\r\nsome excuse for her crime? What could be more base and dishonorable\r\nthan to abandon so fond and devoted a woman? Had not M. de Fosseux\r\ndeserved his fate? And I, who had entertained the same design, and had\r\nbeen on the point of committing the very same act of treachery, and for\r\nthe very same vile motive of adding to an already large fortune, what\r\nwas _I_, then? Had she meant to give me an awful warning of the fate\r\nwhich awaited me if I proved as faithless as M. de Fosseux? I was lost\r\nin conjectures. There was, perhaps, one way of extricating myself from\r\nthis labyrinth, or, at least, of throwing some light on the darkness\r\nby which I was surrounded. I might ascertain from the family of M. de\r\nFosseux if at the time of his death he was engaged to be married. I,\r\nhowever, rejected this idea; for, whether it proceeded from love or\r\nfrom infirmity of purpose, I preferred darkness to light, and blindness\r\nto perfect vision. \"Yes,\" said I to myself, \"I have dreamt it all; my\r\nimagination has mixed up M. de Fosseux with the wrong I was myself\r\nabout to inflict, and, whilst meditating a crime, I have also imagined\r\nits cruel punishment. Truly, I have had a shocking dream!\"\r\n\r\nMy reflections had led me thus far, when Mademoiselle d'Ermay returned\r\nfrom church. She came and took her accustomed place at my bedside.\r\n\r\n\"Eugenie,\" said I, \"I have much to tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not talk, chevalier; you are still too weak for conversation.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Eugenie, I am better. My head is clear, and my delirium past; so\r\nlisten. In the first place, my brother is dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Accept my condolences, and allow me to congratulate you on your\r\naccession to wealth and a higher title.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear friend,\" said I again, \"my mother has written to me. She\r\nrequires me to do two things; one is to go for a time to my estate\r\nin Dauphiné, and the other to get married. Surely, then, this is the\r\nauspicious moment to obtain the sanction of the Church to our union?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, marquis,\" she answered, quietly, \"for the king and\r\nqueen\" (Louis XV. was dead), \"and especially the Princess Elizabeth,\r\nhis majesty's sister, are very strait in their notions, and might\r\notherwise possibly look coldly upon you when you are presented.\"\r\n\r\nWithin a week we were married.\r\n\r\n\"She became your wife?\" exclaimed I.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I am still in mourning for her, and shall continue to wear it\r\nto the end of my life.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no change in our domestic arrangements; all went on as usual,\r\nexcept that my friends and acquaintance, and my people, instead of\r\ncalling Eugenie Mademoiselle, addressed her as Madame la Marquise. In\r\nthe world my marriage was not blamed; on the contrary, it was approved.\r\nIt was an event which every body seemed to have expected, and, taking\r\nplace, as it did as soon as I became rich, was voted to be alike\r\nhonorable to Mademoiselle d'Ermay and myself. I must tell you a trait\r\nwhich will enable you to judge how my wife--for so I must now call\r\nher--interested herself in the events of my former life. A few days\r\nafter our marriage she said to me,\r\n\r\n\"My dear marquis, I used formerly to go sometimes to the theatre of\r\nAudinet--did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, marquise, often.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was at that time a young _danseuse_ on those boards who\r\nattracted my attention: she was called, I believe, Zephirine; do you\r\nremember her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had forgotten her, marquise, and but for your recalling her to my\r\nmind I should never have thought of her again.\"\r\n\r\n\"She was a giddy girl, I understand,\" continued she, \"and from\r\nmere love of change left Paris and France some years ago with a\r\nwealthy Englishman, through whose indulgence and her own indolence\r\nshe neglected her dancing--a talent soon lost without constant\r\npractice--and she has grown fat and lost her agility. The Englishman\r\nhas become tired of her and turned her off, and she cannot get an\r\nengagement even in London; would you now be so kind as to make her some\r\nsmall allowance?\"\r\n\r\nI did so, and my wife would never listen to the confession I begged\r\nher to hear. I then took my wife into Dauphiné, and presented her to\r\nmy mother, who at first received her very coldly, as I expected--for\r\nthis marriage had marred all her plans--but she was soon so won by the\r\nunvarying sweetness of her temper, and the irresistible fascination\r\nof her manners, that she conceived the warmest affection for her,\r\nand no mother-in-law ever loved a daughter better. My good fortune\r\nexcited some jealousy, and the beauty of my wife much admiration. A\r\ngentleman in the neighborhood fell in love with her, and was bold\r\nenough to declare his passion; she instantly, and without the smallest\r\nhesitation, informed me of the insult she had received, and I, as\r\npromptly, decided on calling him out; a resolution which Eugenie at\r\nfirst opposed, but on my insisting that as I had in former days fought\r\nfor a mistress I could not do less for a wife, she said, \"Go, then, and\r\navenge me; if you fall, I will not survive you.\"\r\n\r\nMy antagonist was severely wounded; and this proof of spirit obtained\r\nme the more credit in my neighborhood, as my cause was so just. The\r\nrevolution broke out whilst we were in Dauphiné, and I wished to return\r\nwithout delay to Paris; but my wife dissuaded me. \"You are no longer\r\nin the army,\" said she; \"you left it when you married me, and you\r\ntherefore owe no personal service to the king; stay here, where you may\r\nperhaps be useful to others, and certainly so to yourself.\"\r\n\r\nI followed counsels which had long since become the only guide of my\r\nwill, and it was well I did so, for we passed in peace and retirement\r\nthat period which was so fatal to our aristocracy; and when the storm\r\nwas over, \"Now,\" said she, \"let us go to Paris.\"\r\n\r\nHere we lived in the enjoyment of happiness which nothing ever alloyed,\r\nand of a mutual affection which age neither cooled nor impaired. Thus,\r\nyou see, my friend (continued M. de Marigny), I have been led through\r\nlife by my wife; but she strewed the path with flowers, whilst the\r\ncircumstance which, as it were, compelled me to marry her saved me from\r\nthe commission of a base and unworthy act, for which I should never\r\nhave ceased to reproach myself, and which would have rendered my life\r\nmiserable. Yes, all has been for the best.\r\n\r\n\"You mean by that,\" said I, \"that you have had sufficient strength of\r\nmind to control your imagination and to become thoroughly convinced\r\nthat preceding events were the mere dream of a delirious man?\"\r\n\r\nWait awhile (quietly pursued M. de Marigny). Two years ago, my wife was\r\nseized by sudden and severe illness; she had up to that moment enjoyed\r\ninvariable good health, and though she was upwards of fifty, her smile\r\nretained all its sweetness, and her countenance was as serene as ever.\r\nWhen she found herself unable to leave her bed, she gave herself up for\r\nlost.\r\n\r\n\"I feel that I shall die, my dear friend,\" said she to me one day, \"and\r\nI have some few requests to make of you; you will not marry again--will\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\nAt these words I burst into tears, and poured forth again all my former\r\noaths, and which, considering our long attachment and my advanced age,\r\nit was no longer difficult to keep.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said she, \"you will never give your name to another woman;\r\nI feel sure of that. What I wish is, that you should retire to your\r\nestate in Dauphiné, and there, in peace and tranquillity, end your days\r\nwhere your father and mother died and are buried; and, that you may\r\nhave no inducement to remain in Paris or ever return to it, sell your\r\nhouse; and then, having no interest in the capital, you will find it\r\nthe more easy to perform what I have now requested, and what I feel\r\nassured you will promise me to do.\"\r\n\r\nI promised all she required; and in so doing it appeared to me that I\r\nwas adopting the wisest and most prudent course. There was, moreover,\r\nin the idea of going to die amidst the tombs of my ancestors and of\r\nmingling my ashes with theirs, a feeling of piety which melted me to\r\ntears. Eugenie, once feeling assured that her last wishes would be\r\nobeyed, asked for the attendance of a priest, and died with the same\r\ncourage and composure as had marked her whole life.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said her confessor to me, \"God is just and merciful. He pardons\r\nthe repentant sinner--your wife is a saint in heaven.\"\r\n\r\nI will not attempt to describe my grief, my despair, and the state of\r\nutter loneliness into which this sad bereavement plunged me: I have\r\nother matters to talk of. When Eugenie was no more I had no longer any\r\nwill but my own to consult; and though deeply regretting the absence\r\nof that sway I had been so long accustomed to, I nevertheless followed\r\ninclinations which were no longer controlled. It was a feeling of piety\r\nwhich had first made me promise to retire into Dauphiné, and it was\r\nnow a similar feeling which determined me to remain where I was. Why\r\nshould I go and die amidst ancestral tombs? Why make it a point of duty\r\nto mix my ashes with theirs? I lost my father when I was a mere child;\r\nI scarcely remembered him; and I had lived very little with my mother,\r\nwhereas, my whole life had been spent with Eugenie. It was therefore\r\nnear her that I ought to end my days, and in her grave that I ought to\r\nfind my final resting place; nor could I understand how it was that she\r\nhad not expressed a wish to that effect, and I persuaded myself that if\r\nshe could now see me she would approve of the change in my resolution.\r\nWhen I had once made up my mind to remain in Paris, it was no longer\r\nrequisite or convenient to sell my house; and to tell you the truth,\r\nI was very desirous to keep it. I had inhabited it from my youth; I\r\nhad improved and embellished it, and it recalled to my remembrance the\r\nonly woman that I had ever sincerely loved. My whole life had been\r\nspent in it; in it had been acted the whole drama of my existence, and\r\nthere was not a corner nor a piece of furniture in it which did not\r\nawaken some thought or recollection. I resolved then to live and die\r\nin Paris. But, my friend, though our dwellings of brick and mortar are\r\nmore durable than those of our own mortal clay, they, nevertheless,\r\nfrom time to time require repair, or they would fall into a state of\r\nutter dilapidation. Several months ago, my people told me that some\r\ntiling was wanted to the roof, and that the flooring of the rooms on\r\nthe sixth story was sadly out of condition. These were the rooms of\r\nwhich Mademoiselle d'Ermay had been the last occupier; in fact, my wife\r\nhad always taken to herself these three rooms which she had occupied in\r\nher poverty, and the keys of them remained in the hands of my people\r\ntill after that my grief had somewhat subsided. I wished to revisit the\r\nscene of my wooing, and the hallowed spot where Eugenie had responded\r\nto my passion. My first visit was made alone, and I gave way without\r\nrestraint to the feelings which the scene was calculated to excite.\r\nOn this occasion, however, I went up with the workmen. Time, and the\r\ndampness of a room always kept closed, had almost entirely destroyed\r\nthe flooring. They set to work in my presence, and scarcely had they\r\nraised up the mouldy boards and decayed joists, than I saw diamonds\r\nglitter, and rubies, and gold--those dreadful jewels which had caused\r\nme so much terror and such a severe illness--there they were, the very\r\nsame....\r\n\r\n\"Great God!\" cried I; \"then she _had_ killed M. de Fosseux!!!\"\r\n\r\nThe old man NODDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         From Household Words.\r\n\r\nTHE SPENDTHRIFT'S DAUGHTER. IN SIX CHAPTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FIRST.\r\n\r\n\"Frugality is a virtue which will contribute continually and most\r\nessentially to your comfort. Without it, it is impossible that you\r\nshould do well; and we know not how much, or how soon, it may be\r\nneeded.\"\r\n\r\nSo writes Southey to his son, Cuthbert, just then starting at Oxford.\r\n\r\nThe proposition might have been expanded from the particular to the\r\nuniversal. Southey might have said, that in no condition of life, from\r\nthat of her who sitteth upon the throne, to that of the handmaiden who\r\ngrindeth behind the mill, can frugality--in other words, system and\r\nself-denial as regards the expenditure of money--be dispensed with.\r\nSelf-denial and diligent attention in the management of this great\r\ntalent are necessary in all.\r\n\r\nNo one of the gifts of Providence appears to the casual observer to be\r\nbestowed with less regard to individual merit than wealth. It would\r\nalmost seem, as an old divine has written, as if God would mark his\r\ncontempt of mere material riches by the hands into which he suffers\r\nthem to fall. Although, fall where they will, and on whom they will,\r\none thing is certain;--that they will prove but a delusive snare to\r\nthose who know not how to order them;--when to husband, and when to\r\nspare; when to spend, or when to bestow.\r\n\r\nThese reflections arose from a story with which, not long ago, I became\r\nacquainted. A common tale enough--one among a thousand illustrations of\r\nwhat Butler affirms to be the indispensable condition upon which it has\r\npleased our Creator that we should hold our being:--that of controlling\r\nour own actions; either by prudence to pass our days in ease and quiet;\r\nor, by rashness, ungoverned passion, wilfulness, or negligence, to make\r\nourselves miserable.\r\n\r\nHe is sitting on the bottom stone of a magnificent flight of steps,\r\nwhich lead up to a handsome door, situated in the centre of a large\r\nmany-windowed house, which, fronted with handsome iron rails round\r\nthe area, is built of fine brick, and ornamented with abundance of\r\nstone-work, in cornices and architraves. This house stands in one of\r\nthe best streets in the neighborhood of Grosvenor Square.\r\n\r\nHe is clothed in garments that once were fashionable; but now are\r\ndiscolored with much wear and long exposure to wind and weather; so\r\nmuch so, that, in several places, they are falling into tatters. His\r\nface--the features of which are very finely cut, and still bear the\r\ntraces of a once very remarkable beauty--is wan, attenuated, and\r\nbegrimed with dust, dirt, and neglect. His eyes are haggard; his hair\r\ndusty and dishevelled--his beard ragged and untrimmed.\r\n\r\nHe is the picture of physical decay, and of the lowest depths of\r\nmoral degradation. He sits there upon the stone, sometimes watching\r\nthe street-sweeper--a little tattered boy cheerily whistling over his\r\nwork--now and then casting up his eyes at the closed windows of the\r\nhandsome house, upon which the beams of the rising sun are beginning\r\nto shine; but to shine in vain at present; for it is only about six\r\no'clock in the morning, and life has not yet begun to stir within the\r\nmansion.\r\n\r\nHis cheek rests upon his thin, withered, and unwashed hand, as he casts\r\nhis eyes first upwards, then downwards, then slowly, and with a sort of\r\ngloomy indifference, around.\r\n\r\nHe looks upward. Is it towards the sky; where the great lord of\r\nearthly light--type of that more Glorious Sun which should arise \"with\r\nhealing on its wings\"--is diffusing the cheering effulgence of the\r\ndawn, calling forth the fresh and wholesome airs of the morning, and\r\nliterally chasing away the noisome spirits of the night? Is he looking\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nNo; he is no seeker of the light; he feels not its blessed influence;\r\nhe heeds not the sweet fresh rising of the morning as it breathes over\r\nthe polluted city, and pours, for a few short moments, its fresh,\r\ncrisp, cheering airs into the closest and most noisome of her quarters.\r\nHe cares not for that delicious brightness which gives to the vast town\r\na pure and peculiar clearness for a few half hours, whilst all the\r\nworld are asleep, and the streets are yet guiltless of sin and sea-coal.\r\n\r\nWhat has light; the pure breath of the morning; the white rays of the\r\nearly sun; and the soft, quiet, and refreshing stillness of the hour,\r\nto do with him? He only lifts up his eyes to examine a house: he only\r\ncasts them around to observe what goes on in the streets; he is of the\r\nearth, earthy,--the sacred odor exists not for him.\r\n\r\nYet, in the deep melancholy, the expression of harrowing regret with\r\nwhich he _did_ look up at that house--even in the very depths of his\r\nmoral degradation and suffering--the seeds of better things might be\r\ngerminating. Who shall say? He has sounded the very base-string of\r\nmisery: he touches ground at last--that may be something.\r\n\r\nThe sparrows chirped in the rays of the sun, and the little sweeper\r\nwhistled away. Different figures began sparingly to appear, and one\r\nby one crept out; objects of strange aspect who seem to come, one\r\nknows not whence;--the old clothes-man, with his low and sullen\r\ncroak; country carts; milk-men, rattling their cans against area\r\nrails; butcher-boys swinging their trays. Presently were heard,\r\nimmediately below where the man was sitting, the sounds of awakening\r\nlife;--unlocking of doors, opening of windows, the pert voices of the\r\nwomen servants, and the surly responses of the men; shutters above\r\nbegan to be unfolded, and the eyes of the large house gradually to\r\nopen. The man watched them--his head resting still upon his hand,\r\nand his face turned upwards--until, at length, the hall-door opened,\r\ndisplaying a handsome vestibule, and a staircase gay with painting and\r\nguilding. A housemaid issued forth to shake the door-mat.\r\n\r\nThen he arose and slowly moved away; every now and then casting a\r\nwistful glance backwards at the house, until he turned the corner, and\r\nit was lost to his sight.\r\n\r\nThus he left a place which once had been his own.\r\n\r\nWith his head bent downwards, he walked slowly on; not properly\r\npursuing his way--for he had no way nor object to pursue--but\r\ncontinuing his way, as if he had, like a ball once set in motion, no\r\nmotive to stand still. He looked neither to the right nor to the left;\r\nyet seemed mechanically to direct his footsteps towards the north. At\r\nlength, he slowly entered one of the larger streets in the neighborhood\r\nof Portland Place. His attention was excited by a bustle at the door\r\nof one of the houses, and he looked up. There was a funeral at a house\r\nwhich stood in this street a little detached from the others. The\r\nplumes were white. It was the funeral of an unmarried person. Why did\r\nhis heart quiver? Why did he make a sudden pause? Had he never seen a\r\nfuneral with white plumes before in his life?\r\n\r\nWas it by some mysterious sympathy of nature that this reckless,\r\ncareless, fallen man--who had looked at the effigies of death, and\r\nat death itself, hundreds and hundreds of times, with negligent\r\nunconcern--shuddered and turned pale, as if smitten to the heart by\r\nsome unanticipated horror?\r\n\r\nI cannot tell. All I know is, that, struck with a sudden invincible\r\nterror, impelled by a strange but dreadful curiosity, he staggered,\r\nrather than walked forward; supporting himself as he went against the\r\niron rails, and thus reached the steps of the house just as the coffin\r\nwas being carried down.\r\n\r\nAmong the many many gifts once possessed, and all misused, was one of\r\nthe longest, clearest, and quickest sights that I ever remember to have\r\nheard of. His forlorn eye glanced upon the coffin; it read:\r\n\r\n                          \"ELLA WINSTANLEY,\r\n                          Died June 29, 18..\r\n                          Aged Twenty-three.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he staggered. The rails could no longer support him. He sank down\r\nupon the flagstones.\r\n\r\nThe men engaged about the funeral lifted the poor ragged creature\r\nup. A mere common beggar, they thought; and they were about to call\r\na policeman, and bid him take charge of him; when a lady, who was\r\nstanding at the dining-room window of the house, opened it, and asked\r\nwhat was the matter?\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, Ma'am,\" said the undertaker's man; \"but this here gent\r\nhas fallen down, as I take it, in a fit, or something of the sort.\r\nPoliceman, hadn't you best get a stretcher, and carry him to the\r\nworkhouse or to the hospital?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the lady, \"better bring him in here. Mr. Pearson is in the\r\nhouse, and can bleed him, or do what is necessary.\"\r\n\r\nUpon which the insensible man was carefully lifted and carried by two\r\nor three of the men up the steps. At the door of the hall they were\r\nmet by the lady who had appeared at the window. She was evidently a\r\ngentlewoman by her dress and manners. She was arrayed very simply. Her\r\ngray hair was folded smoothly under her bonnet-cap; her black silk\r\ncloak still hung upon her shoulders; her bonnet rested upon a pole\r\nscreen in the dining-room. It seemed by this that she was not a regular\r\ninhabitant of the house in which she exercised authority. Nothing could\r\nbe more gentle and kind than the expression of her calm, but firm\r\ncountenance; but upon it the lines of sorrow, or of years, were deeply\r\ntraced. She was, evidently, one who had not passed through the world\r\nwithout her own portion of suffering; but she seemed to have suffered\r\nherself, only the more intimately to commiserate the suffering of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThey laid the stranger upon the sofa in the dining-room; and, at the\r\nlady's desire, sent for Mr. Pearson, who was the house apothecary.\r\nWhilst waiting for him, she stood with her eyes fixed upon the face of\r\nthe stranger; and, as she did so, curiosity, wonder, doubt, conviction,\r\nand astonishment were painted in succession upon her face.\r\n\r\nVery soon Mr. Pearson appeared, and advised the usual remedy of\r\nbleeding. The lady walked to the window, and stood there, watching the\r\nproceedings of those without, until the arrangements of a very simple\r\nfuneral were terminated, and the little procession, which attended the\r\nyoung Ella Winstanley to her untimely grave, gradually moved on, and\r\ndisappeared at the turning of the street.\r\n\r\nThe countenance of the lady, as she returned to the sofa, showed that\r\nshe had been very much moved by the sight.\r\n\r\nHaving been bled, the stranger opened his eyes; which now, as he lay\r\nthere, extended upon the sofa, displayed a gloomy but remarkable\r\nbeauty--a beauty, however, arising rather from their form and color,\r\nthan from their expression, which was more painful than interesting.\r\nAgain the lady fixed her eyes upon his face, and again she shuddered,\r\nand half turned away. Pity, disgust, and regret, were mingled in her\r\ngesture.\r\n\r\nThe stranger's eyes followed her, with a dreamy and unsettled look. He\r\nseemed to be as mazed with wonder as she was.\r\n\r\nShe turned again, as if to satisfy her doubts. His eyes met hers; and,\r\nas they did so, recollection seemed to be restored.\r\n\r\n\"Where am I, and what is it?\" he muttered.\r\n\r\n\"You are where you will be taken good care of until you are able to be\r\nremoved,\" said the lady. \"Is there any one you would wish to have sent\r\nfor?\"\r\n\r\nThe man did not speak.\r\n\r\n\"Any one you would wish to be sent for?\" she repeated.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Any thing more you would wish to have done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\nHe lay silent for some time, with his eyes still fixed upon her.\r\n\r\nAt last he said, \"Tell me where I am?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where you are welcome to be until you can gather strength enough to\r\nproceed to the place to which you were going when this attack seized\r\nyou. And that was--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nowhere. But what house is this?\"\r\n\r\n\"A house only destined for the reception of ladies,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"Ladies! what ladies?\"\r\n\r\n\"The sick who have no other home.\"\r\n\r\n\"A house of charity, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Partly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that one--that one--that young creature, whose funeral--Do you\r\nknow her? any thing about _her_--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered the lady, with gravity, approaching to severity, \"I do\r\nknow _much_ about her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why--why did she come here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because she was friendless and deserted; poor, sick, and\r\nmiserable. She had given up what little money she had to supply the\r\nwants--perhaps--who knows?--the vices of another. Happily there were\r\nfound those who would befriend her.\"\r\n\r\n\"And she accepted the charity; she received the alms?\"\r\n\r\n\"She had learned to submit herself to the will of God.\"\r\n\r\nHe shut his teeth together with a something between bitterness and\r\ncontempt at these last words, and turned his head away.\r\n\r\n\"You are her father?\" said the lady.\r\n\r\n\"I am--\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you are a very wretched man,\" she added.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he replied, \"I am most miserable.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are one who have reaped from seeds, which might have produced a\r\nrich harvest of happiness, nothing but black and blighted misery.\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke with unusual severity, for her soul recoiled at his aspect:\r\nshe saw nothing in it to soften her feelings of indignation.\r\n\r\n\"I have lived,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"How! as others of my temper have lived. It was not my fault that I\r\nwas born with an invincible passion for enjoyment. I did not make\r\nmyself. If pleasure be but the forerunner of satiety--if life be\r\nbut a cheat--if delight be but the precursor of misery--a delusion\r\nof flattering lies,--_I_ did not arrange the system. Why was virtue\r\nmade so hard, and self-indulgence so enticing? I did not contrive the\r\nscheme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such excuses,\" the lady replied, \"the honest consciousness within us\r\nrejects; such as your own inner conscience at the very moment you utter\r\nthem disclaims. She who is gone--a broken-hearted victim of another's\r\nerrors--hoped better things when she exhausted almost her last breath\r\nin prayers for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prayers!\" in a tone that spoke volumes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, prayers.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is become of my other daughter?--I want to go to _her_.\"\r\n\r\n\"She died, I believe, about twelve months ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I am alone in the world?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have no children now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to turn me out into the street?\" he suddenly asked,\r\nafter a short silence.\r\n\r\n\"The rules of this house--which is dedicated to the assistance of sick\r\nand helpless women--will not admit of your remaining.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going. You will hear of me next as one past recovery; picked up\r\nout of some kennel by the police. You would have done better not to\r\nhave restored me. I should have died quietly.\"\r\n\r\n\"But without repentance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Repentance!\" he said fiercely. \"Repent while my whole soul is writhing\r\nwith agony? Ella! Ella! if I could only have kept my Ella, she would\r\nhave tended me--she would have soothed me--she would have worked for\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the lady, \"she would have done this, and much more--but God\r\nhas taken her; has rescued her from your heartless selfishness.\" To\r\nherself she added--for her heart was glowing with indignation--\"Even in\r\nthis supreme moment, he thinks of nothing but of himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"She would have been more gentle with me than you are,\" he said, with\r\na half-reproachful sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes--she would have felt only for you--_I_ happen to feel for\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which I never did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never--\"\r\n\r\n\"You say true,\" said he, musing.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE SECOND.\r\n\r\n\"Julian Winstanley----\"\r\n\r\n\"He who won the steeple-chase yesterday? Who, in the name of goodness,\r\nis Julian Winstanley? A name of some pretension; yet nobody seems to\r\nknow where he came from.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh dear, that is quite a mistake. I beg your pardon--_everybody_ knows\r\nwhere he came from. This bird of gay plumage was hatched in a dusky\r\nhole and corner of the city; where his grandfather made a fabulous\r\nfortune by gambling in the funds.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is as handsome a young fellow as ever was hatched from a muckworm.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a careless, dashing prodigal, whatever else; and I never look at\r\nhim without thinking of Hogarth's picture of the 'Miser's Heir.' What\r\nsay you to him, Blake, with your considering face? Come, out with your\r\nwisdom! You can make a sermon out of a stone, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"May be so. A stone might furnish matter for discourse, as well as\r\nother things; but I am not in the humor for preaching to-day. I can't\r\nhelp being sorry for the scapegrace.\"\r\n\r\n\"So like you, Contradiction! Sorry for him! And, pray, what\r\nfor?--_because_ he is the handsomest, most aristocratical-looking\r\nperson one almost ever met with--_because_ he is really clever, and\r\ncan do whatever he pleases in no time (might have taken a double-first\r\nat Oxford easily, Penrose says, if he would)--or _because_ he has got\r\ncountless heaps of gold at his banker's; and nobody to ask him a why or\r\na wherefore; may do, in all things, just what he likes--or _because_ he\r\ncan drink like a fish, dance like Vestris, ride like Chiffney; be up\r\nall night and about all day, and never tire, be never out of spirits,\r\nnever dull? Harry Blake! Who'll come and hear Harry Blake? He is going\r\nto give his reasons, why a man who has every good thing of the world is\r\nmost especially to be pitied.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going to do no such thing. The reasons are too obvious. I deal\r\nnot in truisms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, all I know is, that he won the steeple-chase yesterday, and\r\nto-day he beat Pincent, the champion, at billiards. To-morrow he goes\r\nto the ball at Bicester; and see if he does not beat us all at dancing\r\nthere, and bear away the belle, whoever the belle may be--though the\r\nblood of a stockbroker does run in his veins.\"\r\n\r\n\"His blood may be as good as another's, for aught I know,\" said the\r\nphilosopher; \"but I doubt whether the rearing be.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the blood, depend upon it. Blake, you are quite right,\" said a\r\npale, affected young man, who stood by, and was grandson to an earl;\r\n\"the blood--these upstarts are vulgar, irremediably, do what they will.\"\r\n\r\n\"That not quite,\" said Harry Blake. \"I have seen as great cubs as ever\r\nwalked behind a plough-tail who would call cousins with the Conqueror,\r\nWarndale. But a something there is of difference after all; and, in\r\nmy opinion, it lies in the tradition. Wealth and distinction are like\r\nold wine, the better for keeping. Time adds a value, mellows, gives\r\na certain body--an inappreciable something. Newly-acquired wealth\r\nand distinction is like new wine--trashy. I rather pity the man who\r\npossesses them, _therefore_.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I do not\"--\"And I do not,\"--and \"A fig for your philosophy!\"\r\nresounded from all sides of the table.\r\n\r\nThe philosopher looked on with his quiet smile, and added:\r\n\r\n\"I do not mean to say that I should pity any of those here present\r\nin such a case, for we all know, by experience, that new wine, in\r\nany quantity, has no effect upon them; never renders their heads\r\nunsteady--was never known to do so. But you must allow me to pity\r\nJulian Winstanley; for I think his wits are somewhat straying, and I\r\nfear that he has already mounted upon that high horse which gallops\r\ndown the road to ruin.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so away they all went to the ball at Bicester that night. Most\r\nof them were somewhat more elaborately dressed than the occasion\r\nrequired. Julian Winstanley was, undoubtedly. It had been his mother's\r\ninjunction, never to spare expense in any thing that regarded his\r\ntoilette; and dutifully he obeyed it.\r\n\r\nI am not going to give you a description of his dress. Fancy every\r\nthing most expensive; fancy, as far as a natural good taste would\r\nallow, every habiliment chosen with reference to its costliness; and\r\nbehold him waltzing with a very pretty girl, who is, upon her side,\r\nexquisitely dressed also. She wears the fairest of white tulles, and\r\nthe richest of white satins, and has a bouquet of the flowers from\r\nthe choicest of French artists in her bosom, and another negligently\r\nthrown across her robe. Hair of remarkable beauty, arranged in a way to\r\ndisplay its profusion, and the very expensive ornaments with which it\r\nis adorned.\r\n\r\nAlthough the young lady--who is the daughter of a very fashionable\r\nand extravagant man, celebrated in the hunting and racing world--is\r\nwell known to be portionless, yet she is the object of general\r\nattraction;--a thing to be noted as not what usually happens to young\r\nladies without sixpences, in these expensive times. But it is the\r\ncaprice of fashion, and fashion is all-powerful. So Julian, who is\r\nonly starting in the career of extravagance, and in its golden age\r\nof restless profusion, and far removed, as yet, from that iron age\r\nwhich usually succeeds it--namely, that of selfish covetousness--is\r\nquite prepared to cast himself at her feet--which with a little good\r\nmanagement of her and her mother's, he soon actually did. Having, as\r\nyet, more money in his pocket than he knew how to get through, he was\r\nexceedingly pleased with what he had done, and not a little proud in\r\ndue time to incarcerate this fair creature in solitary grandeur within\r\nhis carriage, whilst he and his boon companions rejoiced outside.\r\n\r\nThe connections formed by his marriage occasioned additional incentives\r\nto expense. Introduced into a more elevated circle than he had as\r\nyet moved in, and impelled by the evil ambition of outshining every\r\none with whom he associated, Winstanley soon found innumerable new\r\nopportunities for spending money. He became a prey to imaginary\r\nnecessities. His carriages, his horses, his villas and their furniture,\r\nhis dinners, his wines, his yachts;--her _fêtes_ in the morning and her\r\nballs in the evening, her gardens (which were for ever changing), her\r\ndelicate health, which required the constant excitement of continental\r\ntravel, and yachting excursions;--the dress of both; the wild\r\nextravagance of every thing,--I leave you to picture to yourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE THIRD.\r\n\r\nWhat is five thousand a year, when a man spends six? Make it ten, and\r\nhe will spend twelve. There is an old story I have heard my mother\r\ntell:--\r\n\r\nA man had a legacy left him, so large, that upon the strength of it\r\nhe was enabled to change his plan of life. He sat down and calculated\r\nthe style in which it would henceforward become him to live. His\r\narrangement of income and expenditure would have been perfect, only\r\nthat the income fell short a certain, not very large, sum. This was\r\na sad business. A few hundreds more, and he would have been quite at\r\nease--he had them not--he began to feel rather poor. A letter arrives\r\nfrom his man of business. There has been a mistake; the legacy is of\r\ntwice the amount it had been at first stated at. How will it become\r\nhim to live now? That is easily settled--he has only to double all his\r\nexpenses. Alas! And he remains twice as poor as he was before.\r\n\r\nThere is no limit to extravagance--it is a bottomless chasm which is\r\nnot to be filled.\r\n\r\nThe income does not exactly suffice--and no man ought to exceed his\r\nincome. True, but there are unexpected expenses--things that perhaps\r\nmay never recur. The prudent man economizes something else; the\r\nimprudent man goes to his capital. He unlocks that sacred door of which\r\nhe holds the enchanted key in his hand--and ruin rushes out upon him as\r\na flood.\r\n\r\nJulian soon began to touch upon his capital. It was but in small sums\r\nat first, and yet it is astonishing how rich and easy (for the time) it\r\nmade him feel. A thousand or two thus added to a man's income makes all\r\nmighty smooth, and the consequent diminution of his future revenue is a\r\ntrifle, not felt, and not worth thinking of. Desires increase with the\r\nmeans to gratify them. He who takes a thousand or two from his capital,\r\nsoon finds it necessary to take more. Income diminishes as desires gain\r\nstrength; the habit of indulgence grows as the means to gratify it\r\ndecline.\r\n\r\nWhat with borrowing, and giving bills, and drawing larger bills to pay\r\nthe former bills when they became due, Julian and his wife had, by\r\nthe nineteenth year of their marriage, eaten out the whole core and\r\nmarrow of their fortunes. The edifice now stood, to all appearance, as\r\nsplendid as ever--but it had become a house of cards over a bottomless\r\npit.\r\n\r\nAnd yet they had children; they had not wanted those best incentives to\r\na better course. Their possessions in this way were not very numerous;\r\npeople of this description have seldom overflowing nurseries; the\r\nmother is usually too fine a lady to look after her children herself.\r\nShe is contented with hiring some head nurse, taking her on trust from\r\nsome other young woman as heedless and negligent of her duties as\r\nherself; and to her tender mercies she leaves her babies.\r\n\r\nSuch a nurse had lorded it in Mrs. Winstanley's family; an ill-governed\r\nfamily in every respect, where each servant, from the highest to the\r\nlowest, measured his or her consequence by the money which was spent\r\nor wasted. Under this nurse's care two lovely boys had died in their\r\ninfancy. One little girl had tumbled somewhere or in some way--or had\r\nbeen made to stand too long in the corner when she was naughty, or to\r\nwalk too far when she was tired, or what. I know not. All I know, is,\r\nthere was some internal injury, the cause of which no medical man who\r\nwas consulted could detect. The other, and only remaining child, was\r\na fine, handsome, spirited girl, of whom Mrs. Nurse thought proper\r\nto be excessively proud and fond. And how were these little children\r\neducated? Educated is an inappropriate word. There was no capacity for\r\neducation on the part of Nurse; but Mr. and Mrs. Winstanley, though\r\ntheir dinners were just as numerous and profuse as ever, saw not the\r\nslightest necessity, whilst the little girls were young, for the\r\nadditional expense of any better governess; and Mrs. Nurse was left to\r\ngive all the elementary instruction that was thought needful--a task\r\nwhich she undertook with alacrity; having become somewhat apprehensive,\r\nnow the two little boys were dead and the two young ladies getting\r\nbigger, that she might be superseded.\r\n\r\nHer teaching consisted, first in shaking and scolding Miss Clementina,\r\nand keeping her, with her poor aching hip, prisoner in her chair\r\ntill she had learned, a lesson--which, for want of comprehending the\r\nabsurdly long words of which it seemed purposely composed, it was\r\nalmost impossible she should learn; and secondly, in laughing at Miss\r\nElla's odd blunders as she read, and telling her every word as it\r\noccurred, before she had time to pronounce it.\r\n\r\nAs for religion, morality, or knowledge of right and wrong, Mrs. Nurse\r\nthought too little about such things herself to impart them to others.\r\nI suppose she taught the children to say their prayers; but I am sure\r\nI know no more than the mother did, whether it was so or no. Sometimes\r\nthe children were taken to stare about them in church; but not often,\r\nfor Mrs. Winstanley was in the habit of fulfilling the commandment very\r\nliterally, and making Sunday a day of rest. Commonly she spent the\r\nforenoon in bed; only getting up in time to dress for a dinner party\r\nwhich Mr. Winstanley made an especial point of having on that day. He,\r\nas yet, paid this trifling respect to it; he abstained from going on\r\nSunday evening to a certain club which he frequented, to play cards, or\r\nroulette, for unknown sums.\r\n\r\nThe elder of these children grew up, suffering, and spiritless; the\r\nyounger was proud, insolent, overbearing, and tyrannical--as much so\r\nas such a little creature could be. They were fast growing up into all\r\nthis, and would have been confirmed in it, had not an accident arrested\r\nthe fearful progress.\r\n\r\nSpoiled, flattered, allowed to indulge every evil temper with impunity,\r\nElla's faults were numberless; more especially to her helpless sister,\r\nwhose languid health and feeble spirits excited little sympathy, and\r\nwhose complaints seemed to irritate her.\r\n\r\n\"I declare you _are_ the most tiresome, tormenting thing, sitting there\r\nlooking as miserable as ever you can, and with that whining voice of\r\nyours, enough to drive one mad. Why _can't_ you brighten up a little,\r\nand come and play? You really _shall_ come and play, I want to play!\r\nNurse! O! she's not there! Do _make_ Clementina come and play.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't, Ella! don't tease me so; pray don't! My hip hurts me; I can't.\r\nDo let me alone, pray.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense. You make such a fuss about your hip! I don't believe any\r\nthing's the matter with it; only you're so ill-natured, you _never_\r\nwill do any thing I ask. Nurse, I say,\" as the door opened, \"do make\r\nher.--O, it's only Matty! Matty, where's Nurse?\"\r\n\r\n\"She's just stepped out, Miss, and told me to come, and stay in the\r\nday-room with you till she was back.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Matty, the new maid, hired but a day or two before, came in with\r\nher sewing in her hand, and sat down quietly to her work at the window.\r\n\r\n\"Matty!\" cried Ella, imperiously, \"don't sit there, looking so stupid;\r\nbut come and make this tiresome girl play with me. There she sits,\r\nmooning over the fire. If Nurse were here, she'd soon have her up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't, pray, Matty,\" as Matty was rising from her chair. \"Pray, don't.\r\nI'll go and play; but indeed, indeed, it hurts me very much to move\r\nto-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! Make her get up, Matty, You must mind me, Matty; you came\r\nhere to mind me; so do as you are bid, you ugly thing.\"\r\n\r\nMatty indeed merited the title of ugly. She was rather tall, but of a\r\nmost ungainly figure, with long bony limbs, ill put together. It was\r\ndifficult to say what the features of her face might have been: they\r\nwere so crumpled, and scarred, and seamed. Not a feature had been\r\nleft uninjured, except her eyes: and they were remarkable both for\r\nintelligence and softness.\r\n\r\nShe put down her work and went up to Clementina, saying, \"What ails\r\nyou, Miss? I hope it isn't true that you feign sickness not to play\r\nwith your sister?\"\r\n\r\nThe poor girl looked up, and her eyes were filled with tears. \"Feign! I\r\nwish I did!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then your hip _does_ hurt you?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure it does. So badly! At night, sometimes, when I'm in\r\nbed--so, so badly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you know that, Miss Ella?\"\r\n\r\n\"Know it! Why, who does not know it? She's always talking of it; but,\r\nfor my part, I don't believe it's half so bad as she pretends.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't pretend, Ella; you are always saying that. How cruel you are\r\nto set Nurse against me, by always saying I pretend.\"\r\n\r\nThus it went on for a minute or two, whilst Matty stood silently by,\r\nher eyes wandering from one sister to the other.\r\n\r\nAt last she sighed, and said, \"If it had pleased God to spare me my\r\nsister, I wouldn't have served _her_ so.\"\r\n\r\nElla turned at this, and lifting up her eyes, measured Matty from head\r\nto foot with indignant contempt. It would seem as if she thought it\r\nalmost too great a presumption in one so humble to have more care for a\r\nsister than she had.\r\n\r\n\"Who cares how such as _you_ serve their sisters?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is One who cares!\" said Matty.\r\n\r\nClementina looked at Matty with puzzled wonder as she spoke. Ella\r\nhaughtily turned away, saying, \"I should like, for my part, to hear who\r\nthis important _one_ is, that you mention with such a strange emphasis.\r\nSome mighty fine personage, no doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Clementina! Miss Clementina! only hear how shocking your sister\r\ntalks. Do stop her!\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop me! I should like to see her, or any one, attempting to stop\r\nme. And why, pray--and what, pray, am I saying so mighty bad, Mrs.\r\nMatty? You? A charity girl? I heard Nurse say, but yesterday, that\r\nshe wondered her mistress would put up with such rubbish, and that\r\nshe loathed the very look of you, for you put her in mind of the Blue\r\nCoat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank God,\" returned Matty, mildly, \"that he raised up that\r\ngreat charity for me, and many perishing like me, and saved us from\r\nwickedness, and taught us to know His holy name. For He looks alike on\r\nrich and poor, and will judge both you and me, young lady.\"\r\n\r\nBoth girls were a little awe-stricken at this speech.\r\n\r\nBut Ella soon recovered herself, and said, \"she hated to hear people\r\ntalk like Methodists.\"\r\n\r\n\"What _are_ you talking about, Matty?\" asked Clementina, gently; \"I\r\ndon't quite understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not understand!--why, sure--heart alive!--it can't be as you are\r\nignorant of who made and keeps you and all of us! Sure! Sure!\" Matty\r\nkept repeating in a tone of much distress, \"I can't believe my own\r\nears.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose we know about all that,\" said Ella, haughtily.\r\n\r\n_She_ to teach her!--the child of charity to presume to insinuate a\r\nwant in her! The idea was intolerable.\r\n\r\nShe went and sat down at a table at some little distance, and pretended\r\nto be busy playing with her bird, whose golden cage stood upon it;\r\nbut, as she did so, she listened in spite of herself to the following\r\nconversation, passing between Clementina and Matty.\r\n\r\n\"I am so uncomfortable,\" the young girl was saying, rather fretfully;\r\n\"I don't know what to do with myself. I try this thing and try that\r\nthing, and nothing gives me any ease or amusement; and I think it very\r\nhard--I can't help thinking it hard--that I should have to suffer every\r\nthing, and Ella, there, nothing; and then, Nurse makes such a favorite\r\nof _her_, and nobody in the wide world cares for me. Oh, I am so\r\nmiserable, sometimes!\"\r\n\r\n\"I used to be like you, once, Miss,\" said Matty.\r\n\r\nAt which Ella gave a contemptuous shrug of the shoulders.\r\n\r\nBut Matty did not regard it; and she went on and said, \"Look at my\r\nface, Miss Clementina; it's very horrid and ugly, I know, and I don't\r\nwonder as Nurse calls me rubbish, and hates to see me in her nice\r\nnursery. Many can't help feeling like that. Do you know how this was\r\ndone?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I suppose small-pox; but it's not like that, for your face is all\r\ncut to pieces. I don't know how it was done.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was done by the dreadful agony of fire. When I was but a little\r\ncreature, living, O Miss! in such a place--five families of there were\r\nin one low, dark, nasty room, and, O Miss! it was like the bad place,\r\nindeed it was--such swearing and blasphemy when the men come home\r\ndrunk, and worse, worse, when the women did so too! Such quarrelling,\r\nand fighting, and cursing, and abusing--and the poor children, knocked\r\nabout at such times anyhow. But my mother never got drunk. She was a\r\npoor feeble creature, and mostly sat at home all day crooning, as they\r\ncall it, by the fire--for they kept a good big fire in winter in the\r\nroom. And then, when father come home he was generally very bad in\r\nliquor, and seeking a quarrel with anything--for something he must have\r\nto quarrel with. Well! One evening--O! I shall never forget it--a cold,\r\nsleety, winter day it was, and the wind rushing up our court, and the\r\nsnow falling thick, and the blackened drops, and great lumps of snow\r\ncoming splashing down, and the foul water oozing in under the doorsill,\r\nand all such a mess; and the poor, tired, or half-drunk creatures\r\ncoming in splashed and dripping, and quarrelling for the nighest places\r\nto the fire, and swearing all the time to make one's hair stand on end;\r\nand father coming in, all wet and bedabbled, and his hat stuck at the\r\ntop of his head, and his cheeks red, and his eyes staring, though he\r\nwas chattering with the cold. Mother was at her place by the fire, and\r\nhe comes up in a rage, like, to turn her out; and she sitting sulky\r\nand wouldn't move; and then there was a quarrel; and he begun to beat\r\nher, and she begun to shriek out and cry, and the women to scream and\r\nscreech. O Miss! in the scuffle--I was but a little thing--somebody\r\nknocks me right into the fire, and my frock was all in a blaze. It\r\nwas but a moment, but it seemed to me such a time!--all in a blaze of\r\nfire! And I remember nothing more of it, hardly, but a great noise, and\r\npouring water over me, and running this way and that. When I come to\r\nmyself, where was I?\"\r\n\r\nElla turned from her bird, and her attention seemed riveted upon the\r\nstory. She forgot her pride and her insolence in the pleasure of\r\nlistening. Clementina seemed hardly to breathe.\r\n\r\n\"It was very bad being burned,\" she said, at last.\r\n\r\n\"Horrible, Miss!\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" cried Ella, impatiently; \"what became of you?\"\r\n\r\n\"When I got out of my daze--for I believe it was some time before I\r\ncame to myself--I was lying on father's knee, and he had made a cradle\r\nfor me, like, of his great strong arms: and his head was bent down, and\r\nhe was a looking at me, and great big hot scalding tears were dropping\r\nfast upon my poor face.\r\n\r\n\"'My poor--poor little woman,' I heard him say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then--for my eyes had escaped--I was aware that there was a beautiful\r\nyoung lady--at least, I thought her more beautiful than the angels of\r\nheaven--standing on the other side of me, right opposite my father, and\r\ndoing something to my poor arms.\"\r\n\r\n\"The lady was very young--seemed scarcely more than a child herself,\r\nthough she was a young married lady. She was beautiful dressed, all in\r\nsnow-white muslin, with white satin sash, and bows to her sleeves, and\r\na white rose in her hair. She had thrown a large bonnet over it--but\r\nnow it was tossed off, and lay with her shawl upon the floor. Bad as\r\nI was--O! in such horrid pain--the sight of that beautiful dear angel\r\nwas like a charm to me; it seemed to chase away the pain. And then she\r\ntouched me so delicately, and spoke so soft and kind! It was music;\r\nheaven's own music was her voice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was she? who could she be?\" cried Ella.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Miss, who should she be, but Mr. Stringer, the apothecary's young\r\nbride, as he had just brought home, and all ready dressed to go out to\r\nher first dinner.\"\r\n\r\nElla turned away contemptuously, with a gesture that expressed \"was\r\nthat all?\"\r\n\r\nClementina said,--\r\n\r\n\"How nice of her to come to a poor little burnt child like you! and\r\ninto such a dreadful place too! But I wonder she came in her best gown!\"\r\n\r\n\"As I heard afterwards, it happened that Mr. Stringer had been sent for\r\nout, and was not come back; and when they ran screeching and screaming\r\nto the shop, crying a child was burnt in the court hard by, and Mr.\r\nStringer was wanted, as there was no one to go but a little mite of\r\na shop-boy--for Mr. Stringer had but just begun business--what does\r\nshe do, but catches up a bottle of stuff for burns, claps her bonnet\r\nover her pretty white rose, throws her shawl on, and, dressed in her\r\nbeautiful new wedding-gown, comes to this horrid den of dirt and\r\nwickedness. She did me up as best she could, and then seeing my poor\r\nfather crying too, and all the people standing round, and yet not a\r\nword to comfort him, she said, very gently and kindly, to him,--\r\n\r\n\"'Pray don't grieve so: she will be better by-and-by, poor dear. Don't\r\ngroan so badly, poor child! You are very sorry for her, poor man--but\r\ndon't take on so.'\r\n\r\n\"But the more she spoke in this kind way, all the more he cried, till\r\nat last he seemed as if he could contain himself no longer, and he\r\ngroaned, and almost roared out.\r\n\r\n\"'Are you the father?' said the young lady. 'Where is the mother?'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh! here--here--here--my precious child, my sweet baby!' cried\r\nmy poor mother--and then went on, 'It was all of you--you big\r\nbrute--you--you pushed your own baby into the red-hot flames, as you\r\nwere atrying to get at me!--yes, my baby--my poor--'\r\n\r\n\"'Don't speak so loud, good woman,' said the young lady, gently. 'Lay\r\nthe child upon the bed,' turning round--'Bless me!--why, there is not a\r\nbed!'\r\n\r\n\"'We are very poor people, ma'am,' a woman began; 'not a penny to bless\r\nourselves with. If you'd please to--'\r\n\r\n\"I remember my father's voice to this day--\r\n\r\n\"'Silence!' he called out, in such a passion, 'would you beg money from\r\nthe lady to spend in more gin? Give 'em nothing, ma'am--give none of us\r\nnothing--only tell me what's to be done to save the poor little thing's\r\nlife.'\r\n\r\n\"She hesitated, turned, and looked round the miserable apartment. Too\r\ntrue, there was not an apology for a bed; there was not even clean\r\nstraw.\r\n\r\n\"'Take her up in your arms,' said she to my father, 'and follow me.'\r\nAnd she stooped and picked up her bonnet, and gathered her great shawl\r\naround her, and stepped out into the rainy, sleety, windy night; and\r\nmy father--for some poor creature had lent an old shawl to throw over\r\nme--took me and carried me after her: and a turn of the alley which led\r\ninto the court, brought us out into the street, where the apothecary's\r\nshop stood. I was carried through, and up two pair of stairs, and into\r\na little mite of a room--but all so clean and nice--and laid, oh! in\r\nsuch a delicious bed--and oh! it felt so comfortable--it soothed me,\r\nlike--and I fell fast asleep.\"\r\n\r\nThe two girls were silent for some time. Ella spoke first.\r\n\r\n\"What a good woman!\" was the remark she made; \"but was she only an\r\napothecary's wife,\" she went on; \"and was her name Stringer? What a\r\nhorrid ugly name! Are you sure it was Stringer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Miss--Stringer and Bullem--that was the name over the shop-door.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! did they keep a shop?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure they did.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long did you stay there?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never went away no more, Miss. When I got better, the lady began to\r\ntalk to me. I was a little mite of a thing, but I was quick enough. She\r\nfound what bad ways I was bringing up in; that I had never once heard\r\nof Our Saviour--not even of my Maker--far from ever hearing of the\r\nBible--or having it read, or being taught to pray, or--\"\r\n\r\nThe two young girls looked at each other, but said nothing. Matty, in\r\nbroken and interrupted sentences, went on:\r\n\r\n\"So she kept me; for she could not bear to send me back to that pit of\r\niniquity in which she had found me. And as I lay in my bed, one day,\r\nand they thought I was asleep, I heard her arguing the point with her\r\nyoung husband--\r\n\r\n\"'Why, child, you cannot pretend to adopt all the poor neglected\r\nchildren in this bad town?' he said.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh no! I know one can do little--little enough: it is but one drop of\r\nwater in the vast ocean--only one little, little drop; but the oyster\r\ntook it into its shell, and it became a pearl. Let me keep this poor\r\nlittle one. I don't mean to be foolish--indeed I don't--I will only\r\nclothe her, and feed her, and send her to the charity school: indeed,\r\nthey will half clothe her there. Do--do, dear John--she is such a\r\nmiserable object! What is she to do? Let her be taught her duty--let\r\nher not be a poor ruined wretch, body and soul at once.'\"\r\n\r\n\"The young lady would have moved a stone with her talking. Her husband\r\nwas not very persuadable; he was not like her. He was rather a\r\ncold-hearted, selfish young man, but he couldn't refuse her; and so,\r\nwhen I got better, I was sent to one of the great charity schools in\r\nthe city, where I learned a deal; but my sweet Mrs. Stringer took a\r\npleasure in teaching me herself, and so I learned a deal more.\"\r\n\r\nEnough of Matty's tale.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stringer, when she devoted such means as she could command to the\r\nrescue of one poor child from the misery in which she was living, and\r\nraised her from deplorable ignorance, as regarded all higher things,\r\nto a knowledge of the supreme and only real good, little thought how\r\nextensive her good deed would prove; and that in providing for the\r\nreligious and moral education of this wretched child, she was preparing\r\nthe means of a religious education--imperfect, yet still in some sort\r\na sound religious education--for two children of wealth and luxury, as\r\nto such things, most entirely destitute. But so it proved--and this was\r\nthe only religious education they either of them could be said ever to\r\nreceive; so utterly, so entirely, were all relations of this nature\r\nforgotten and neglected in this house of profusion, where not one\r\nsingle thing, but the one thing needful could be said to be wanting.\r\n\r\nThe story first beguiled the attention, and then awakened the deep\r\ninterest of the two girls. From this day, a sort of acquaintance arose\r\nwith Matty, which ripened into true affection; for Matty was, in fact,\r\na woman of no common order.\r\n\r\nShe gradually awakened their sympathies with regard to subjects to her\r\nthe most deeply interesting. She led them, not unwilling, in those\r\npaths which are indeed paths of pleasantness and peace. She read the\r\nBible with them, and to them, and she taught them the vital principle\r\nof effectual religion--the need and the faith to pray.\r\n\r\nI want space to follow the course of these influences upon the soul.\r\nImperfect they were. Such a teacher could not lead them very far; but\r\nshe brought them on Our Saviour's way. And though much remained of\r\nwrong, inexperienced and unconverted--the change was as from darkness\r\nto light.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FOURTH.\r\n\r\nAnd now several years have elapsed, and these two girls are grown up to\r\nbe two beautiful young women. They had been taken out of the nursery\r\nwhen it was time to be thinking seriously of accomplishments; and\r\nthe reign of Mrs. Nurse had closed. She was superseded by a regular\r\ngoverness--a foreigner. A French lady was chosen to undertake the task\r\nof forming two English girls to become English wives and mothers. The\r\nFrench lady did well all that she was required to do; for neither Mr.\r\nnor Mrs. Winstanley desired that their beautiful daughters should\r\nreceive any thing approaching to what is usually called a solid\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nMrs. Winstanley had not ten ideas beyond the arrangement of a party,\r\nand the keeping of good society. As for Julian Winstanley himself, he\r\ndetested reflection, abhorred every thing approaching to seriousness,\r\nonly desired to get through life as brilliantly and as thoughtlessly as\r\nhe could.\r\n\r\nHe was not much at home; but when at home he required to be constantly\r\namused, or he found home intolerable. It was not long before his\r\ndaughters discovered this.\r\n\r\nTill they were what is called introduced, these fair girls passed\r\ntheir time secluded in the school-room, and saw very little of their\r\nparents; but when they were once brought out, and when Mademoiselle was\r\ndismissed and they lived in the drawing-room, they were soon initiated.\r\n\r\nThe plan of life was one not unusual among married people of a certain\r\nclass. A large and splendidly furnished house, in a fashionable square\r\nin London, was _home_--at which about six months of every year were\r\npassed; the remaining six being spent either in travelling, or at\r\nwatering-places, or at some hired house in the country. They lived as\r\na privileged order, severed, as by a gulf impassable, from the lowest\r\norders around them, and in little communication with the highest. The\r\nlast condition was not of much importance, but the other was fatal.\r\n\r\nWhat can grow out of such a life, that is really wholesome and good?\r\nMany, many residents in London, escape this mischief. They have broken\r\ndown the wall of separation which used to hide the very existence\r\nof want and misery and sin from the happier and the better; and the\r\nobscure dwellings of the London poor have their visiting angels, as\r\nwell as those in the country. But a great many families still neglect\r\nthis weighty duty, and live without thought of such things.\r\n\r\nMrs. Winstanley had led the regular party-going London life for the\r\nlast sixteen or seventeen years. She was beginning to get rather tired\r\nof it, when the new excitement arose of having to \"bring out\" her\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\nThis bringing out of her daughters became an excuse for all kinds of\r\namusing changes and improvements. Her receiving-rooms had to be newly\r\nfurnished, a new open carriage to be bought, the Queen's drawing-rooms\r\nto be attended with more assiduity than ever.\r\n\r\nThe girls were two lovely creatures; they seemed to excuse, if any\r\nthing could, the expenses thus incurred on their behalf. So said the\r\nmother, and so thought the father. The love he felt for his daughters\r\nwas perhaps the only tender feeling he had ever experienced in his\r\nlife; for, in general, he might be said to love nothing, not even\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIt might have been the dawn of a better life, this well-spring of pure\r\naffections, could he have worthily indulged them. But neither his own\r\nnor his wife's habits admitted of that.\r\n\r\nMrs. Winstanley would have thought it a disgrace if she had been one\r\nsingle evening disengaged whilst they were in London. Even in the dead\r\nwinter she managed to keep up the ball; what with little parties and\r\nconcerts, the opera, the French plays, and so forth, she contrived to\r\nescape the horror of a domestic evening. As for Mr. Winstanley, he\r\nseldom or never dined at home; except when there was a dinner-party. He\r\nspent his evenings at his clubs, engaged--he too well knew how.\r\n\r\nThe two girls presented a striking contrast to each other.\r\nClementina was fair and delicate, with soft hair, and those tender\r\nblue eyes, which to me are the most charming of all eyes. Ella\r\nwas a noble creature; a figure and form the most perfect that I\r\never beheld--features of matchless symmetry--eyes dark, large, and\r\nlustrous--hair in floods of rich brown waves--a hand that was a model,\r\nfrom which statuaries contested to be allowed to copy--and a spirit,\r\nenergy, and feeling in her gestures and countenance, that won your\r\nheart before you were aware.\r\n\r\nIt was upon her that Julian Winstanley doted. The other girl he\r\nthought, and called, a sweet girl, but his Ella was his darling.\r\nNothing was too good for Ella; nothing was to be spared that could\r\nplease or adorn Ella. To ride with her in the Park; to visit the box\r\nwhere she sat at the opera; sometimes in a party to hear her sing;\r\nseemed to give him a new pleasure.\r\n\r\nYet there was nothing in all this, unhappily, to rouse him to a better\r\nlife; to break the chain of evil habits in which he was involved.\r\nElla was a child of this world; an impetuous, proud, haughty beauty;\r\na contemptuous disregarder of the weak, the wanting, and, above all,\r\nthe low, or the ugly;--living for the day, as her father lived for the\r\nday--she for the day of vanity and pleasure; he for the day of vanity\r\nand sin. There was that difference, indeed, and it was a vast one; but\r\nhe did not feel it.\r\n\r\nThere was no pure and holy influence of a higher and nobler life,\r\ndiffused from the beautiful being. She was no angel of light. She was\r\nmerely, to all appearance, a very fine, fashionable girl.\r\n\r\nAnd Clementina, in her gentleness and softness, was little more. The\r\ngood seed which Matty had sown, had fructified at first, but the briars\r\nand thorns were gathering fast around it. The pleasures of life were\r\nchoking it up. It was in danger of being altogether lost.\r\n\r\nMatty had long been gone. She had married a respectable tradesman, and\r\nwas in a flourishing, though small, way of business. She would have\r\nbeen altogether forgotten long ago, only that she would not suffer\r\nthis. She found herself still welcomed when she did come; for both the\r\ngirls loved her, and she perfectly adored them. So she came, bringing\r\nher little offerings, from time to time--little matters such as she\r\ndealt in, in her shop--humble, but, for her sake, welcome. These two\r\ngirls had both hearts. Where they got them I don't know.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FIFTH.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Ella! Ella!--what's the use of your turning your head from\r\nme?--Why, I can see you are coloring crimson--as if I had no eyes! Oh!\r\nhe _is_ charming, is not he?\"\r\n\r\n\"How tiresome you can be, Clementina! I am sure I don't care. No,\r\nnot.... Besides, he's your flirt, not mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he? I wish he were! But I know better. He loves you, Ella; and\r\nwhat's more, you love him. And if _you_ don't know it--which perhaps\r\nyou don't--_I_ do, and _he_ does.\"\r\n\r\n\"_He_ does!--I like that!--_he_ does!--Upon my word! _I_ like him, and\r\n_he_ knows it! I do no such thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take care what you say. Walls have ears.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pooh!--nonsense! And if they have, I tell you I don't care.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't?--you are sure you don't? Oh, very well! If that be really\r\nso, then I had better keep my message to myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Message!--what message?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know a man does not like to be refused; and so, if you really\r\ndo _not_ care for him, why, I had better hold my peace. He is\r\nyoung, and he is volatile enough.... And, indeed, I have wondered,\r\nElla, sometimes, how you ever came to take a fancy to him; but I am\r\nforgetting. It was my mistake. You never _have_ taken a fancy to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"How you do run on!\" she said, taking the last rose out of her hair;\r\nfor she was standing before the glass, undoing her braids; the\r\nsisters, having dismissed their attendant, that they might have a\r\ncomfortable chat together. And then the hair came all tumbling over her\r\nshoulders, and upon her white muslin dressing-gown, and she looked most\r\nbeautiful--half pleasant, half angry--as she turned round; and, trying\r\nto frown with her eyes, whilst her lips smiled, said--\r\n\r\n\"Cle., you _are_ the most intolerable girl in the world.\"\r\n\r\nCle. smiled, looked down, and said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"You may as well tell me, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I won't, unless you will be a true girl--own what you ought to\r\nown--say what you ought to say--that you do not _quite_ hate him. You\r\nreally may say that--and then we will see about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hate him! Did I say I hated him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Or, pretended you did. Or, that he was indifferent to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well; I don't hate him, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then come here, and sit down by me, and I will tell you that Lionel\r\nloves you, and adores you--and all that. Very easily said. But far more\r\nthan that--and with great difficulty said--he wishes to make you his\r\nwife!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah me!\"--and again the color flashed into her face, and such an\r\nexpression was visible in her eyes!\r\n\r\nSuddenly she threw her arms around her sister, and embraced her\r\ntenderly.\r\n\r\n\"You dear, dear girl,\" she whispered--\"Oh, I am so--so happy! But tell\r\nme--tell me--all, from the beginning. Lionel!--is it possible?\"\r\n\r\n\"You thought we were very busy talking together to-night, at Mrs.\r\nWhite's ball, didn't you?--You were a little jealous, were you not, you\r\nsilly thing? Ah, my Ella! My proud--proud Ella! To have made such a\r\ntumble into love!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!--how you talk! But tell me all he said. Every single word of\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\n\"He said he loved you more than his life, and all that sort of thing;\r\nand that I must tell you so to-night; and, if you would give him the\r\nleast atom of encouragement, I was to take no notice, and he would\r\nspeak to papa and mamma immediately; but, if you hated him as much as I\r\nsaid I was sure you did....\"\r\n\r\n\"How could you say such a stupid thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought that was what I ought to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"How foolish you are, Cle.! Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, in _that_ case, I was to write. Shall I write?\"\r\n\r\nShe did not write.\r\n\r\nAnd from this time the existence of Ella was changed.\r\n\r\nShe loved, with all the fervor and energy of her nature; and life took\r\nat once a new color. True love is of the infinite. None can have deeply\r\nloved--when or how in other respects it may have been--but they have\r\nentered into the unseen world; have breathed a new breath of life; have\r\ntasted of the true existence.\r\n\r\nWhat is often called love, may do nothing of all this--but I am\r\nspeaking of _true_ love.\r\n\r\nLionel seemed at that time scarcely worthy of the passion he had\r\ninspired. Yet he had many excellent qualities. He was warm-hearted,\r\ngenerous to excess, had good parts, a brilliant way of talking, and was\r\na favorite with all the world.\r\n\r\nHe had not the splendid gifts which nature had bestowed upon Julian\r\nWinstanley. By the side of her father, even in the eyes of Ella, the\r\nbright halo which surrounded her lover would seem somewhat to pale.\r\nThe young man even appeared to feel this, in some degree, himself. He\r\nalways, yet with a certain grace, took the second place, when in her\r\nfather's presence. Ella loved her father, and seemed to like that it\r\nshould be so.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my sister! oh, my friend! what--what shall we do? Oh, misery!\r\nmisery! what is to become of us all?\"\r\n\r\nClementina's eyes were swimming with tears; but she would not give way.\r\nIn passive endurance she excelled her sister.\r\n\r\nShe held her arms clapped closely round her; whilst Ella poured a\r\ntorrent of tears upon her bosom.\r\n\r\n\"My father! my beautiful, clever, indulgent father, that I was so proud\r\nof--that I loved so--who spared nothing upon either of us--alas! alas!\r\nhow little, little did I guess whence the money came!\"\r\n\r\nClementina trembled and shivered as her sister poured forth these\r\npassionate lamentations; but she neither wept nor spoke for some time.\r\nAt last she said:\r\n\r\n\"Ella, I have been uneasy about things for some time. We are young, and\r\nwe have not much experience in the ways of the world; but since our\r\npoor mother died, and I have had in some degree to manage the house, I\r\nhave been every day becoming more uncomfortable.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have?\" said Ella, lifting up her head: \"and you never told me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should I have told you? why should I have disturbed your dream\r\nof happiness, my dear Ella? Besides, I hoped that it concerned me\r\nalone--that things might hold on a little while longer--at least, till\r\nyou were provided for, and safe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Safe! and what was to become of you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not much think of that. I had a firm friend, I knew, in you,\r\nElla; and then, lately, since mamma's death; since you have been\r\nengaged to dear Lionel, and I have been much alone, I have thought\r\nof old things--old things that good Matty used to talk about. I have\r\nbeen endeavoring to look beyond myself, and this world; and it has\r\nstrengthened me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are an excellent creature, Cle.!\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"But, my father! what is to be done? Can any thing be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my love. I fear nothing can be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"He loves me!\" said Ella, raising up her head again, her eyes beaming\r\nwith a new hope. \"I will try--I will venture. It is perhaps great\r\npresumption in a child; but my father loves me, and I love him....\"\r\n\r\nAgain Clementina shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"You are so faint-hearted--you are so discouraging. You give up every\r\nthing without an attempt to save yourself or others. That is your way!\"\r\ncried Ella, with her own impetuosity, and some of her old injustice.\r\nThen, seeing sorrow and pain working upon her sister's face as she\r\nspoke thus, she stopped herself, and cried--\"Oh! I am a brute--worse\r\nthan a brute--to say this. Dear Cle., forgive me; but don't, pray don't\r\ndiscourage me, when I want all my courage. I will go--I will go this\r\nmoment, and speak to my father....\"\r\n\r\nClementina pressed her sister's hand as she started up to go. She\r\nfeared the effort would be vain,--vain as those she had herself made;\r\nyet there was no knowing. Ella was so beautiful, so correct, so\r\neloquent, so prevailing!\r\n\r\nShe followed her with her eyes, to the door, with feelings of mingled\r\nhope and apprehension.\r\n\r\nDown the splendid stairs, with their gilded balustrades, and carpets\r\nof the richest hue and texture, rushed the impetuous Ella. Through\r\nthe hall--all marbles and guilding--and her hand was upon the lock of\r\nthe library door. She was about to turn it, without reflection: but a\r\nsudden fear of intruding came over her--she paused and knocked.\r\n\r\n\"Who is there?\" exclaimed an irritated voice from within; \"go away--I\r\ncan see no one just now.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is I, papa--Ella; pray let me come in.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she opened the door.\r\n\r\nHe was standing in the middle of the lofty and magnificent apartment,\r\nwhich was adorned on every side with pictures in gorgeous frames; with\r\nbusts, vases, and highly ornamented bookcases fitted with splendidly\r\nbound books--seldom, if ever, opened. His pale, wan, haggard face\r\nand degraded figure, formed a fearful contrast to the splendid scene\r\naround him, showing like a mockery of his misery. A small table, richly\r\ninlaid, stood beside him; in one hand he held a delicate cup of fine\r\nchina; in the other, a small chemist's phial.\r\n\r\nHe started as she entered, and turned to her an angry and confused\r\ncountenance, now rapidly suffused with a deep crimson flush; but, as if\r\nelectrified by a sudden and horrid suspicion, she rushed forward, and\r\nimpetuously seized his shaking arm.\r\n\r\nThe cup fell to the floor, and was broken to atoms; but he clenched the\r\nphial still faster in his trembling hand, as he angrily uttered the\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"How dare you come in here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! papa--papa!\"--she had lost all other terror before that of\r\nhorrible suspicion which had seized her--\"what are you about? what is\r\nthat?\" stretching out her arms passionately, and endeavouring to wrench\r\nthe phial from his fingers.\r\n\r\n\"What are you about? what do you mean?\" he cried, endeavouring to\r\nextricate his hand. \"Let me alone--leave me alone! what are you about?\r\nBe quiet, I say, or by....\" And with the disengaged hand he tore her\r\nfingers from his, and thrust her violently away.\r\n\r\nShe staggered, and fell, but caught herself upon her knees, and\r\nflinging her arms round his, lifted up her earnest imploring face,\r\ncrying, \"Father--father! papa-papa! for my sake--for your sake--for all\r\nour sakes; oh, give it me! give it to me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Give you what? what do you mean? what are you thinking about?\"\r\nendeavouring to escape from her clasping arms. \"Have done, and let me\r\nalone. Will you have done? will you let me alone?\" fiercely, angrily\r\nendeavoring again to push her away.\r\n\r\n\"No! never--never--never! till you give me--\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"That!\"\r\n\r\n\"That!\" he cried. Then as if recollecting himself, he endeavored, as\r\nit seemed, to master his agitation, and said more calmly, \"Let me\r\nbe, Ella! and if it will be any satisfaction to you, I will thrust\r\nthe bottle into the fire. But, you foolish girl, what do you gain by\r\nclosing one exit, when there are open ten thousand as good?\"\r\n\r\nDisengaging himself from her relaxing arms, he walked up to the\r\nfire-place, and thrust the phial between the bars. It broke as he did\r\nso, and there was a strong smell of bitter almonds. She had risen\r\nfrom her knees. She followed him, and again laid that hand upon his\r\narm--that soft, fair hand, of whose beauty he was wont to be so\r\nproud. It trembled violently now; but as if impelled with unwonted\r\ncourage, and an energy inspired by the occasion, she ventured upon that\r\nwhich it was long since anyone ever had presumed to offer to Julian\r\nWinstanley--upon a plain-spoken remonstrance.\r\n\r\n\"Papa,\" she said, \"promise me that you will never--never--never\r\nagain----\"\r\n\r\n\"Do what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Make an attempt upon your life--if I must speak out,\" she said, with a\r\nspirit that astonished him.\r\n\r\n\"Attempt my life? What should I attempt my life for?\" said he, and\r\nhe glanced round the scene of luxury which surrounded him. He was\r\ncontinuing, in a tone of irony--but it would not do. He sank upon a\r\nsofa, and covering his face with his hands, groaned--\"Yes--yes, Ella!\r\nall you say is true. I am a wretch who is unworthy to--and more--who\r\n_will_ not live.\" He burst forth at last with a loud voice; and his\r\nhands falling from his face, displayed a countenance dark with a sort\r\nof resolute despair. \"No--no--no!--death, death!--annihilation--and\r\nforgetfulness! Why did you come in to interrupt me, girl?\" he added,\r\nroughly seizing her by the arm.\r\n\r\n\"Because--I know not--something--Oh! it was the good God, surely, who\r\nimpelled me,\" she cried, bursting into tears. \"Oh, papa! papa! Do not!\r\ndo not! Think of us all--your girls--Cle. and I. You used to love us,\r\npapa----\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what has happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--no. I believe you have lost a great deal of money at cards.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cards--was it? Let it be. It may as well be cards. Yes, child, I\r\n_have_ lost a large sum of money at cards--and more,\" he added, setting\r\nhis teeth, and speaking in a sort of hissing whisper--\"more than I can\r\nexactly pay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, papa! don't say so. Consider--only look round you. Surely you have\r\nthe means to pay! We can sell--we can make any sacrifice--any sacrifice\r\non earth to pay. Only think, there are all these things. There is all\r\nthe plate--my mother's diamonds--there is----\"\r\n\r\nHe let her run on a little while; then, in a cool, almost mocking tone,\r\nhe said--\r\n\r\n\"I have given a bill of sale for all that, long ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"A bill of sale! What is a bill of sale?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well! It's a thing which passes one man's property into the hands of\r\nanother man, to make what he can of it. And the poor dupe who took my\r\nbill of sale, took it for twice as much as the things would really\r\nbring; but the rascal thought he had no alternative. I was a fool to\r\ngive it to him, for the dice were loaded. If it were the last word I\r\nhad to speak, I would say it--the dice were loaded----\"\r\n\r\n\"But--but----\"\r\n\r\n\"What! you want to hear all about it, do you? Well it's a bad business.\r\nI thought I had a right to a run of luck--after all my ill fortune. I\r\ncalculated the chances; they were overwhelmingly in my favor. I staked\r\nmy zero against another man's thousands--never mind how many--and I\r\nlost, and have only my zero to offer in payment. That is to say, my\r\nnote of hand; and how much do you think that is worth, my girl? I would\r\nrather--I would rather,\" he added, passionately, changing his tone of\r\nlevity for one of the bitterest despair--\"I would rather be dead--dead,\r\ndead--than----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, papa! papa! say it not! say it not! It is real. Such things are\r\nnot mere words. They are real, father, father!--Die! You must not die.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have little cause to wish to die,\" he said, relapsing again into a\r\nsort of gloomy carelessness; \"so that I could see any other way out of\r\nit. To be sure, one might run--one might play the part of a cowardly,\r\ndishonorable rascal, and run for it, Ella, if you like that better.\r\nBetween suicide and the escapade of a defaulter, there is not much to\r\nchoose; but I will do as you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would not willingly choose your dishonor,\" said she, shuddering;\r\n\"but between the dishonor of the one course or the other, there seems\r\nlittle to choose. Only--only--if you lived, in time you might be able\r\nto pay. Men have lived, and labored, until they have paid all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Live and labor--very like me! Live, and labor, until I have paid\r\nall--extremely like me! Lower a mountain by spadefuls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even spadefuls,\" she said; her understanding and her heart seemed\r\nboth suddenly ripened in this fearful extremity--\"even spadefuls at\r\na time have done something--have lowered mountains, where there was\r\ndetermination and perseverance.\r\n\r\n\"But suppose there was neither. Suppose there was neither courage, nor\r\ngoodness, nor determination, nor perseverance. Suppose the man had\r\nlived a life of indolent self-indulgence, until, squeeze him as you\r\nwould, there was not one drop of virtue left in him. Crush him, as fate\r\nis crushing me at this moment; and I tell you, you will get nothing out\r\nof him. Nothing--nothing. He is more worthless than the most degraded\r\nbeast. Better to die as a beast, and go where the beasts go.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned ghastly pale at this terrible speech--but, \"No,\" she\r\nfaltered out--\"no--no!\"\r\n\r\n\"You will not have me die, then?\" he said, pursuing the same heartless\r\ntone; but it was forced, if that were any excuse for him. \"Then you\r\nprefer the other scheme? I thought, he went on, \"to have supped with\r\nPluto to-night; but you prefer that it should be on board an American\r\nsteamer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" she gasped, rather than uttered.\r\n\r\n\"You do--you are sure you do?\" said he, suddenly assuming a tone of\r\ngreater seriousness. \"You wish, Ella, to preserve this worthless life?\r\nHave you considered at what expense?\"\r\n\r\n\"Expense! How! Who could think of that?\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! not the expense of money, child--at the expense of the little\r\nthing called 'honor.' Listen to me, Ella,\"--and again he took her arm,\r\nand turned her poor distracted face, to his. \"You see I am ready to\r\ndie--at least, was ready to die--but I have no wish to die. Worthless\r\nas this wretched life of mine it, it has its excitements, and its\r\nenjoyments, to me. When I made up my mind to end it, I assure you,\r\nchild, I did the one only generous thing I ever was guilty of in my\r\nlife; for I did it for you girls' sakes, as much or more than for my\r\nown. Suicide, some think a wicked thing--I don't. How I got my life, I\r\ndon't know; the power of getting rid of it is mine, and I hold myself\r\nat liberty to make use of it or not, at my own good pleasure. As for\r\nmy ever living to pay my debt, it's folly to talk of it. I have not,\r\nand never shall acquire, the means. I have neither the virtue nor the\r\nindustry. I tell you, I am utterly good for nothing. I am a rascal--a\r\nscoundrel, and a despicable knave. I played for a large sum--meaning to\r\ntake it if I won it--and not being able to pay, I lost it--and that, I\r\nhave still sense of honor enough left to call a rascally proceeding.\r\nNow there is one way, and one way only, of cancelling all this in the\r\neye of the world. When a man destroys himself, the world is sorry for\r\nhim--half inclined to forgive him--to say the least of it, absolves\r\nhis family. But--if he turn tail--and sneak away to America, and has\r\nso little sense\"--he went on, passionately and earnestly--\"of all that\r\nis noble, and faithful, and honorable, that he can bear to drag on a\r\ndisgraced, contemptible existence, like a mean, pitiful, cowardly,\r\nselfish wretch, as he is--why, then--then--he is utterly blasted,\r\nand blackened over with infamy! Nobody feels for him, nobody pities\r\nhim--the world speaks out, and curses the rascal as heartily as he\r\ndeserves--and all his family perish with him. Now, Ella, choose which\r\nyou will.\"\r\n\r\n\"I choose America,\" she said with firmness.\r\n\r\n\"And how am I to got to America? and how am I to live there when I am\r\nthere? To be sure, there are your mother's diamonds,\" he added.\r\n\r\n\"Those are included in the bill of sale. Did you not say so?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps I did. But if a man is to live, he must have something\r\nto live upon. If he is to take flight, he must have wings to fly with.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will provide both.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am of age. What I have--which was not your gift--is at least my own.\r\nLionel has been generous; I have the means to pay your passage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye--Lionel! But afterwards, how am I to live? He will not\r\nlike--no man would like--to have to maintain a wife's father, and that\r\nman a defaulter too. You should think of that, Ella.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do! I will never ask him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then who is to maintain me? I tell you, I shall never manage to do it\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will.\"\r\n\r\n\"My poor child!\" he cried--one short touch of nature had reached him at\r\nlast--\"what are you talking of?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope, and believe, that I shall be able to do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I stood with my household gods shattered around me,\" is the energetic\r\nexpression of that erring man, who had brought the fell catastrophe\r\nupon himself.\r\n\r\nAnd so stood Ella now--in the centre of her own sitting-room, like some\r\nnoble figure of ruin and despair; yet with a light, the light divine,\r\nkindling in an eye cast upward.\r\n\r\nYes! all her household gods--all the idols she had too dearly loved\r\nand cherished, were shattered around her, and she felt that she stood\r\nalone, to confront the dreadful fate which had involved all she loved.\r\n\r\nWhat a spectacle presented itself to her imagination, as drearily she\r\nlooked round! On one side, defaced and disfigured, soiled, degraded,\r\nwas the once beautiful and animated figure of her father,--the man so\r\nbrilliant, and to her so splendid a specimen of what human nature, in\r\nthe full affluence of nature's finest gifts, might be. Upon another\r\nside her lover!--her husband! who was to have been her heart's best\r\ntreasure! who never was to be hers now. No! upon that her high spirit\r\nhad at once resolved; never. Impoverished and degraded, as she felt\r\nherself to be, never would she be Lionel's wife. The name which would,\r\nin a few hours' time, be blackened by irremediable dishonor, should\r\nnever be linked to his. One swell of tender feeling, and it was over!\r\nAll that is wrong, and all that is right, in woman's pride, had risen\r\nin arms at once against this.\r\n\r\nThe last figure that presented itself, was that of her delicate and\r\ngentle sister. But here there was comfort. Clementina was of a most\r\nfrail and susceptible temperament, and eminently formed to suffer\r\nseverely from adverse external circumstances; but she had a true and\r\nfaithful heart; and if to Ella she would be obliged to cling for\r\nsupport, she would give consolation in return.\r\n\r\nElla looked upward--she looked up to God!\r\n\r\nThat holy name was not a stranger to her lips. It had been once, until\r\nthe child of charity had taught the rich man's daughter some little\r\nknowledge of it. But such ideas had never been thoroughly realized by\r\nher mind; and now, when in the extremity of her destitution, she looked\r\nup--when, \"out of the depths she cried unto Him,\"--alas! He seemed so\r\nfar, far off, and her distresses were so terribly near!\r\n\r\nYet even then, imperfect as all was, a beginning was made. The thick\r\ndarkness of her soul seemed a little broken,--communion with the\r\nbetter and higher world was at least begun. There was a light--dim\r\nand shadowy--but still a light. There was a strength, vacillating and\r\nuncertain, but still a strength, coming over her soul.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE SIXTH.\r\n\r\nAnd now that wretched man, broken with disease and misery, sat there,\r\nwith the lady, who, patient and pitying even to the worst of her\r\nfellow-creatures, had been moved by the sincerity of his distress. The\r\nextremity of his misery had raised so much compassion in her heart, as\r\nto overcome the resentment and indignation which she had at first felt,\r\non recognizing him.\r\n\r\nHe had entreated her to tell him every thing she knew of the fate of\r\none whom he had that morning followed to the grave. For wretched as\r\nwas his attire, defiled with dirt, and worn with travel, he had left\r\nthe house, and had followed, a tearless, but heartbroken mourner, the\r\nsimple procession which attended the once lovely and glorious creature\r\nwhom he had called daughter to her resting-place.\r\n\r\nHe had stood by, at her funeral, whilst ill-taught children stared and\r\nscoffed, until the busy mercenaries had pushed and elbowed him aside.\r\nHe had seen his best and loveliest one consigned, ashes to ashes, dust\r\nto dust; he had waited quietly until all had dispersed, and every one\r\nwas gone home. He had no home--and he yet stood by, and watched the\r\nsexton completing his work and cheerfully whistling as he proceeded\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nFor it was now a gleaming bright day, and the sun had burst forth,\r\nand beamed upon the lofty tower of the church-steeple. It gilded the\r\nchurch-vane and weathercock; it sparkled from the windows of the houses\r\naround the graveyard; it glistened on the lowly graves.\r\n\r\nCheerfulness was around him, for the bright sun of heaven cheers and\r\nennobles every thing upon which his beams fall. And there was a soft\r\nwind, too, which stirred among the leaves of a few poplars, that stood\r\nhard by, whispering sweet secrets of nature, even in that dismal spot.\r\n\r\nHe stood there, motionless and tearless, until the sexton had finished\r\nhis task, had shouldered his spade, and, still whistling, had walked\r\naway. Then he sat down upon the little mound, and hid his face in his\r\nhands. He sat there for some time--for a long, long time--and then\r\nslowly arose, and with feeble and uncertain steps retraced the way he\r\nhad come, and found himself at the door of the handsome house, whence\r\nhe had followed the funeral in the morning.\r\n\r\nHe made his way to the lady, who happened to be still there, and who\r\nnow (as I have said), indignation having yielded to compassion, was\r\nprepared to satisfy the yearning anxiety he had expressed to hear all\r\nshe could tell him of his once proud and beautiful child.\r\n\r\n\"You know where you are, and what I am, and what I and the other ladies\r\nwhom you have seen with me employ ourselves upon when we come here.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said, looking round. \"It never struck me to inquire, or even\r\nto reflect upon what I saw.\"\r\n\r\n\"This house is a kind of hospital.\"\r\n\r\nHe started--and a faint flush passed over his face.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"it was natural--as things had gone on--a consequence\r\ninevitable. Then she died at last in the hospital?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly that--as you would interpret the word. This house is,\r\nindeed, a species of hospital; it is intended as a refuge for the\r\nsick and dying, who have nowhere else to go; but it does not exactly\r\nresemble an ordinary hospital. In the first place, the services\r\nperformed are not altogether gratuitous; in the second, every\r\npatient has a room to herself. We are only women, except the medical\r\nattendants: and we admit none but women--and those women of a higher\r\nclass, of gentle breeding, and refined habits, who have fallen into\r\npoverty, and yet who have not been hardened in their sensations by\r\nhabits, so as that the edge of privation is blunted; or what, perhaps,\r\nis still more difficult to bear, that painful sense of publicity\r\nunfelt, which renders shelter in an ordinary hospital a source of\r\nsuffering to them--which--God be thanked!--it does not necessarily\r\nprove to those for whom such places of refuge were intended. This house\r\nwould have been more justly called an asylum than a hospital, for it is\r\nintended as a shelter for the sick and destitute; but yet those who are\r\nreceived into it are expected to contribute to their own support.\"\r\n\r\nHe made no answer to this explanation. After all, it, interested\r\nhim little now to know that his Ella had not been a mere object of\r\nthe charity which is extended to paupers. His pride had died within\r\nhim, for his nature had been much changed; but, only as such natures\r\nchange. His faults had withered away, but no good qualities seemed as\r\nyet to burst forth to flourish in their stead. The soul had been so\r\nutterly ruined and devastated, the portion of living waters had been so\r\ncompletely dried up, that he seemed merely to have lost the inclination\r\nto do wrong--that was all.\r\n\r\n\"We are a small party of friends,\" the lady went on; \"some of us in the\r\nheyday of prosperity, but who, amid all the triumphs of youth, wealth,\r\nand beauty, have not quite forgotten the poor, the sick, and the\r\nmiserable: others, who, like myself, are fallen into the yellow leaf of\r\nlife--whose years cannot of necessity be many--may be very few--and who\r\nwould fain do something in the great vineyard before they are called\r\naway. It is our practice for some of us to visit this place every day,\r\nto see our patients, attend to their wants and comforts, and, where it\r\nis desired, administer by our conversation such helps and solace as\r\nwe can. I come here pretty often, for I am not one who is very much\r\noccupied upon this earth; and, as I love to sit with the sufferers, and\r\nam more aged than the majority of them, they seem to lean upon me a\r\ngood deal. They love to have me with them; and many of the younger ones\r\nhave treated me with a confidence, which has excited, I can scarcely\r\nsay whether more satisfaction or pain.\"\r\n\r\nHe still spoke not, but listened with deep attention.\r\n\r\n\"A few months ago,\" she continued, \"the matron of the establishment\r\ncame to me one morning, and said that a young lady had been received\r\nhere some days ago, whom she wished me very much to visit. I had\r\nbut the day before returned from an excursion into the country, and\r\nhad been absent from my post about a fortnight. I asked, at whose\r\nrecommendation the patient had been received. She said--that of Lady\r\nR., but that Lady R. knew nothing about her. It was at the earnest\r\nsolicitation of the wife of the baker who supplied her family with\r\nbread, that Lady R. had given the order; the woman, who was a very\r\nplain sort of person, but highly respectable in her way, having assured\r\nher that it was a case of the most urgent necessity: that the young\r\nlady was utterly penniless and destitute, and in an almost hopeless\r\nstate of health. She had brought on a decline by over-exertion to\r\nmaintain a sick sister, and pay some debts of that sister's, which she\r\nthought herself bound in honor to discharge--'and other expenses,' she\r\nadded, somewhat mysteriously,--promising that she would advance the\r\nrequired guinea a week; for, as for the young lady, she did not believe\r\nthat she had five shillings left in the world.\"\r\n\r\nHe struck his hand flat at the top of his head, and held it there,\r\nleaning his elbow upon the table, so that his arm covered in part\r\nhis face, which was painfully contracted; but he neither spoke, nor\r\ngroaned, nor even sighed.\r\n\r\n\"I went up to the young lady's room immediately. Our rooms are each\r\nprovided with a single bed, a sofa, an easy chair, a table, and\r\nsuch other requisites as make a chamber at once a bedroom and a\r\nsitting-room.\r\n\r\n\"The matron knocked gently at the door; but no one answered it; she\r\ntherefore gently turned the handle of the lock, and we went in.\r\n\r\n\"The window was open. Hers looked upon those green trees you see at\r\nthe back of the house, and the fresh air came pleasantly in: but it\r\nseemed unheeded by the sufferer. She was clothed in a long white\r\nsleeping-gown. One arm was thrown above her head; her hair had gotten\r\nfrom her comb, and fell in waves and curls of the utmost beauty and\r\nluxuriance almost to her feet. She lay with her face upward, resting\r\nupon the back of her head, almost as motionless as a corpse: her\r\nfeatures were fixed; her eyes rested upon the top of the bed. She\r\nseemed lost in thought. Never in my life have I seen any thing so\r\nsupremely beautiful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ella--Ella!\" he just muttered.\r\n\r\n\"When we approached the side of the bed, she first perceived us, gave\r\na little start, glanced at the matron, and then, with a look of rather\r\ndispleased surprise at me--\r\n\r\n\"'I beg your pardon if I intrude upon you,' I said. 'Mrs. Penrose asked\r\nme to pay you a visit. I am but just returned from the country. I spend\r\na good deal of my time when in town with the sick ladies here, and they\r\nseem to like to have me; but if you do not I will go away directly.'\r\n\r\n\"She made an impatient and half-contemptuous motion of the head as\r\nI used the words 'sick ladies;' but she fixed her large, lustrous\r\neyes upon me as I went on speaking--saying nothing, however, when I\r\nconcluded, but keeping those large dark eyes fixed upon my face.\r\n\r\n\"'Shall I go?' I said, after a little time thus spent.\r\n\r\n\"She made a gesture as if to stop me--but without moving those large\r\nmournful eyes, in which I could see that tears were slowly gathering.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Penrose had already left the room. I said no more; but took a\r\nchair, sat down by the bedside, and laid mine upon her thin, fevered,\r\nbut most exquisitely-formed hand.\r\n\r\n\"I gave a gentle, gentle pressure; it was faintly, very faintly\r\nreturned; and then the tears, which had so slowly gathered into her\r\neyes, fell in a few large drops over her faded cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"'This is lonely, desolate work, do what we will,' I said, as a sort\r\nof answer to these few large tears, falling so quietly and still, and\r\nwithout convulsion of features--the tears of a strong but softened\r\nmind. 'To be sick, and without familiar faces--to be sick and among\r\nstrangers--is a sorrowful, sorrowful thing--but we do our best.'\r\n\r\n\"'O, you are good--very good,' she said.\r\n\r\n\"'There is nothing _I_ feel so much myself as this destitution of\r\nthe heart; solitude in sickness is to me almost more than I can\r\nbear; and, therefore, it is, perhaps, that I am almost troublesome\r\nin offering my society to those here who have not many friends and\r\nvisitors--especially to the young. I can bear solitude myself better\r\nnow, badly as I do bear it, than when I was young. Society seems, to\r\nthe young, like the vital air upon which they exist.'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, perhaps so,' she said, after musing a little--'yes. So long\r\nas there was one near me whom I loved, I could get on--better or\r\nworse--but I could get on. But she is gone. Others whom I have loved\r\nare far--far away. The solitude of the heart! yes, that kills one at\r\nlast.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then will you try to make a friend of me? A new friend can never be\r\nlike an old friend. Yet, when the old wine is drawn down to the dregs,\r\nwe accept the new, although we still say the old is better.'\r\n\r\n\"'How very kindly you speak to me! You have none of the pride of\r\ncompassion,' she said, fixing her lovely eyes, filled with an earnest,\r\nintelligent expression, full upon mine. 'You will not humble me, whilst\r\nyou serve me.'\r\n\r\n\"'Humble you! My dear young lady! That, I hope, indeed, would be far\r\nfrom me--from every one of us.'\r\n\r\n\"'I dare say so--as you say it. I have seen none of the ladies, only\r\nthe matron, Mrs. Penrose, and a friend of mine, to whom I owe much;\r\nbut they are both so inferior to myself in habits and education, that\r\nI don't think they could humble me if they tried. The insolence of my\r\ninferiors, I can defy--the condescensions of my superiors, are what I\r\ndread.'\r\n\r\n\"I saw in this little speech something that opened to me, as I thought,\r\none side of her character. All the notice of it, however, which I took,\r\nwas to say, 'We must not exact too much from each other. A person may\r\nhave a very single-hearted and sincere desire to serve us, and yet be\r\nsomewhat awkward in conferring benefits. We must not be unreasonable.\r\nWhere people do their best to be kind, we must accept the will for the\r\ndeed, and besides....'\r\n\r\n\"'You mean to say that benefits may be _accepted_ ungraciously,'--and\r\nshe laid her hand upon mine, and pressed it with some fervor. Yes, that\r\nis true. We may, in the pride of our unsubdued and unregulated hearts,\r\nbe captious, exacting and unjust. We may be very, very ungrateful.'\r\n\r\n\"Do I tire you with relating these things?\" said the lady, breaking\r\noff, and addressing the fallen man. \"Shall I pass on to others? Yet\r\nthere are few events to relate. The history of this life of a few\r\nmonths is comprised in conversations. I thought you would probably like\r\nto hear them.\r\n\r\n\"I _do_ like to hear them. I adjure you, solemnly, to omit nothing that\r\nyou can remember of them. She was a noble creature.\" And he burst forth\r\nwith a bitter cry.\r\n\r\n\"She _was_ a noble creature!\r\n\r\n\"I sat with her some time that day, and learned some little of her\r\nhistory; but she was very reserved as to details and explanations. She\r\ntold me that she had once lived in great affluence; but that a sudden\r\nreverse of fortune had ruined her father, who had been obliged to\r\nquit the country; and that she and her sister had found it necessary\r\nimmediately to set about getting their own livelihood. Only one course\r\nwas open to either of them--that of becoming governesses in private\r\nfamilies, or teachers at schools. They had wished to adopt the latter\r\ncourse, which would have enabled them to keep together, but had not\r\nbeen able to provide themselves with situations; so they had been\r\ncompelled to separate.\r\n\r\n\"'My sister,' she said, 'took a situation in London; I was obliged to\r\naccept one that offered in a distant county, so that we were entirely\r\nparted; but in such cases one cannot choose. My dear Clementina's\r\naccomplishments were such as the family in London wanted; mine suited\r\nthose who offered me the place in the country, or I would have\r\nexchanged with her. But it was not to be. Things in this miserable\r\nworld are strangely ordered.'\r\n\r\n\"'For the _best_,' I said, 'when the issues are known.'\r\n\r\n\"'Who shall assure us of that? and when are their issues known?' she\r\nasked, with some bitterness. 'It would need great faith when one\r\nreceives a heavy injury, to believe it was fraught with good, and well\r\nintended.'\r\n\r\n\"'It would, indeed! Yet, we must have that faith. We ought to have\r\nthat faith in Him, the All-wise, Merciful, and Good. We should have\r\nit,--should we not?--whatever appearances might be, in an earthly\r\nfriend of this description.'\r\n\r\n\"'Ah! but we see and know such a friend.'\r\n\r\n\"'We ought to _know_, though we cannot see, that other friend.'\r\n\r\n\"'Ah! well--it is so, I dare say. But, oh, there are moments in life\r\nwhen the cruel blow is so real, and the consolation so illusory!'\r\n\r\n\"'Seems so real--seems so illusory! Ah! my dear young lady, have you\r\ndrank so deep of the cup of sorrow? And have you not found the great,\r\nthe only true reality, at the bottom?'\r\n\r\n\"She had loosed her hold of my hand, and turned her head coldly away,\r\nas I uttered the last speech.\r\n\r\n\"I asked her why she did so.\r\n\r\n\"'Because you talk like all the rest. At ease yourselves, religious\r\nfaith is an easy matter to you. It is easy to give these every-day\r\nreligious consolations, when we have nothing else to give. But they are\r\nthings of a peculiar character. If the soul does not put them within\r\nitself, none upon earth can bestow them. They are only given of God;\r\nand it has not pleased Him to give them to me. No,' she went on, with\r\nmuch emotion. 'If there be light in darkness, it shines not for me. If\r\nout of the depths they call, and He listens, He has not listened to\r\nme. My prayers have been vain, and I have wearied myself with offering\r\nthem. There was no help in them.'\r\n\r\n\"I was grieved and shocked to hear her speak thus. I, however, ventured\r\nto urge my point a little further.\r\n\r\n\"'But you did find help, somewhere?'\r\n\r\n\"'Not such as I wanted; not health and strength to my poor darkened\r\nspirit.'\r\n\r\n\"'And why? Because they sought it not in faith ...'\r\n\r\n\"'Ah! faith! but who can command this faith?'\r\n\r\n\"'Everybody.'\r\n\r\n\"'Everybody! If it has pleased God to darken our understandings so\r\nthat we do not know him at all, it may be as you say. But if we know\r\nhim--not to trust in him--_that_ worst of faith must be our own fault.'\r\n\r\n\"She was silent, and seemed to sink into a reverie, which I would not\r\ndisturb. At last she shook it off, and turning suddenly to me, said,\r\n'Clementina had got nearer this truth than I had, or have. Yes, that\r\nit was--that it must have been--which supported her in circumstances\r\nfar worse than mine. She was patient, composed, resigned, and, in spite\r\nof her natural feebleness, showed a strength which I ever wanted. She\r\nendured better than I do, when she lay low as I do now, and suffered\r\nworse, far worse. How was it?'\r\n\r\n\"'My strength is made perfect in weakness'--'Is not that said?'\r\n\r\n\"Again she fixed her eyes with a searching, earnest expression upon\r\nmine.\r\n\r\n\"'But, tell me,' I continued, 'how it fared with you? I fear badly.'\r\n\r\n\"'Perhaps you are not aware, Madam, how much strength, both of body and\r\nspirit, it requires to make a governess.'\r\n\r\n\"'I think I am aware of it, in good measure.'\r\n\r\n\"'There seems nothing very onerous in the task of teaching children\r\nduring a certain number of hours every day, and living with them\r\nduring the rest. But those who have tried it alone know how irksome,\r\nhow exhausting is the wearisome routine of ungrateful labor. My\r\nsituation was tiresome enough. They were a family of high-spirited\r\nchildren, as wild as the hills in which they had been bred, and whose\r\ngreatest pleasure was to torment their young governess; though I was\r\nrather excited than depressed by our frequent struggles for mastery.\r\nThen the mother, when she did interfere, was sensible and just; and\r\nshe supported me when she thought me right, through every thing. If\r\nshe disapproved, too, I could be hot and unreasonable in my turn,\r\nand she gently told me of my fault in private, so as to never impair\r\nmy authority. She was a wise and excellent woman. A good mother,\r\nand a true friend, even to her governess. But it was different with\r\nClementina. Shut up in London, with a family of cold-hearted, proud\r\nchildren, already spoiled by the world, and never finding it possible\r\nto satisfy an exacting mother, do what she would, the task was soon\r\ntoo hard for her. The more languid her health and spirits became,\r\nthe feebler her voice, the paler her cheek, the greater was the\r\ndissatisfaction of the lady whom she served. When the family doctor was\r\nat last called in, he pronounced her to be in so critical a state of\r\nhealth, that rest and change of air were indispensable. So she left,\r\nwith fifteen pounds--a half-year's salary.\r\n\r\n\"'Consumption had set in when I saw her. What was to become of her? We\r\nknew of no such place as this, then.\r\n\r\n\"'The lady whom I served was kind and considerate. When I came to her\r\nin tears, she bade me fly to my sister, and not return until I had\r\nsettled her somewhere in comfort. But where was that to be? We had not\r\na friend in the world except one. She had been our under nursery-maid.\r\nShe was now a baker's wife; but she had always loved us. She had such a\r\nheart! And she did not fail us now.\r\n\r\n\"'She took my sister home, and insisted upon keeping her. We could not\r\nallow this to be done without offering what compensation we could. My\r\nsister's little purse was reserved for extraordinary expenses; and I\r\ncontrived out of my own salary to pay a little weekly stipend to our\r\ngood Matty. She would not have taken it; but she had a husband, and\r\nupon this point we were resolved.'\r\n\r\n\"Here she paused, and raising her head from her pillow, rested it upon\r\nher hand, and looked round the room with an expression of satisfaction\r\nwhich it gave me great pleasure to see. The little apartment was\r\nplainly furnished enough; but the walls were of a cheerful color, and\r\nthe whole furniture was scrupulously clean. The windows stood open,\r\nlooking upon a space in which a few green trees were growing. The scene\r\nwas more open, airy, and quiet than one can usually obtain in London.\r\nThe air came in fresh and pleasant; the green trees waved and bowed\r\ntheir heads lovingly and soothingly.\r\n\r\n\"'It is not until we are sick that we know the value, that we feel\r\nthe necessity, of these things,' she began again. 'This I may venture\r\nto say for us both. We had been cradled in luxury and elegancies,\r\nsurrounded by every thing that the most lavish expenditure could\r\nbestow. We gave them all up without a sigh. So much unhappiness\r\nhad attended this unblest profusion, that it seemed almost a\r\nrelief--something like an emancipation--to have done with it, and\r\nbe restored at once to simplicity and nature. Whilst our health and\r\nspirits lasted, we both of us took a pleasure in defying superfluity,\r\nin being easy and content upon a pallet bed, and with a crust of\r\nbread and a glass of water; but, oh! when sickness comes--deadly\r\nsickness! The fever, and the languor, and, above all, the frightful\r\nsusceptibility to external influences. When upon the hard bed you\r\ncannot sleep, though sleep is life to the exhausted frame. When\r\nthe coarse food you cannot touch--though your body is sinking for\r\nwant of nourishment--when the aching limbs get sore with the rugged\r\nunyieldingness of that on which they lie--when you languish and sicken\r\nfor fresh air, and are shut up in a little close room in some back\r\nstreet--when you want medicine and care, and can command no services at\r\nall--or of the lowest and most inefficient description--then--O then!\r\nwe feel what it is to want--then we feel what it is to have such an\r\nasylum prepared for us as this. Poor thing! she was not so fortunate as\r\nI have been.'\"\r\n\r\nHere, the broken man who had until now sat listening in what might\r\nalmost be called a sullen attention, suddenly lifted up his head,\r\nlooked round the room where he sat, and through the large cheerful\r\nwindow upon the branches of the trees and the blue unclouded sky; and,\r\nsuddenly, even his heart seemed reached.\r\n\r\nHe rose from his chair, he sat down again, he looked conscious, uneasy,\r\nabashed. It was so long since he had felt or expressed any grateful\r\nor amiable sentiment, that he was almost ashamed of what he now\r\nexperienced, as if it had been a weakness.\r\n\r\n\"Pray have the kindness to go on,\" he said at last.\r\n\r\n\"It was some days before I learned much more of the history of my\r\npoor young invalid, but one day when I came to see her, I found a\r\nvery respectable looking woman, though evidently not belonging to the\r\nhigher class, sitting with her. She was a person whose appearance\r\nwould have been almost repulsive from the deep injuries her face had\r\nreceived--burned when a child, I believe--if it had not been for\r\nthe sense and goodness that pervaded her expression. Her eyes were\r\nsingularly intelligent, sweet, and kind.\r\n\r\n\"I found she was the wife of the baker--she, who had once been\r\nnursery-maid in your family. The only friend the poor young creature\r\nseemed to have left in the world, and the only person from whom she\r\ncould bear, as it afterwards appeared, to receive an obligation. This\r\nexcellent person it was, who advanced the guinea a-week, which the laws\r\nof the institution required should be contributed by a patient.\r\n\r\n\"When she took her leave I followed her, to inquire further particulars\r\nabout my patient. She then told me, that the sister had died about\r\nthree years before, leaving a heavy debt to be discharged by the one\r\nremaining; consisting of her funeral expenses, which were considerable,\r\nthough every thing was conducted with all the simplicity compatible\r\nwith decency; and of the charges of the medical man who had attended\r\nher: a low unprincipled person, who had sent in an enormous bill,\r\nwhich there were no means of checking, and which, nevertheless, the\r\nhigh-spirited sister resolved to pay. But the first thing she did, was\r\nto insure her own life for a certain sum, so as to guard against the\r\nburden under which she herself labored, being in its turn imposed upon\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\"'So, madam,' said the good Mrs. Lacy, with simplicity, 'you must not\r\nthink that the guinea a-week is any thing more than an advance on our\r\npart--there will be money enough to repay us--or my dear Miss Ella\r\nwould never, never have taken it. She would die in the street first,\r\nshe has such a noble spirit of her own. She told me to provide for her\r\nsister's debts,--she had made an arrangement with a publisher to be a\r\nregular contributor to a certain periodical,--she had likewise produced\r\na few rather popular novels. To effect this she had indeed labored\r\nnight and day,--the day with her pupils, half the night with her pen.\r\nShe was strong, but human nature could not support this long; and yet\r\nlabor as she did, she proceeded slowly in clearing away the debt. I\r\ncannot quite account for that,' said Mrs. Lacy, 'she dressed plainly,\r\nshe allowed herself no expense, she made no savings, she paid the\r\ndebt very slowly by small instalments, yet she worked herself into a\r\ndecline. There seemed to be some hidden, insatiable call for money....'\"\r\n\r\nIf the lady who was recounting all this, had looked at her listener at\r\nthat moment, she would have been moved, little as she liked him. A wild\r\nhorror took possession of his countenance--his lips became livid--his\r\ncheek ghastly--he muttered a few inarticulate words between his teeth.\r\nBut she was occupied with her own reflections, and noticed him not.\r\n\r\n\"This could not go on for ever,\" said the lady, presently. \"She was\r\nobliged to throw up her situation; soon afterwards the possibility of\r\nwriting left her; and she was brought here, where I found her.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that it was--that it was, then!\" cried the wretched man. 'O Ella,\r\nmy child!--my child! I was living, in indolence and indifference, upon\r\nher hard-earned labors! I was eating into her life! And when the supply\r\nceased, I--I never knew what it was to have a heart!--I thought she was\r\ntired of ministering to her father's wants, and I came to England to\r\nupbraid her!\"\r\n\r\n\"It was too late. She was gone where the wicked cease from troubling,\r\nand where the weary are at rest,\" said the lady.\r\n\r\n\"You need not--you need not--my heart is hard, but the dagger has\r\npierced it at last. You need not drive in the steel: it has done its\r\nwork,\" he rather gasped than said.\r\n\r\nThe lady felt that she had been too severe. His apparent insensibility\r\nhad, it is true, irritated her almost beyond bearing, after all he had\r\ndone, and after all that had been suffered for his sake.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry if I give you pain. I ought to be sorry for you, not angry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she never mention me?\" he asked, in a tone of agony. \"And there\r\nwas another, on whom her young heart doted, only too fondly. Did she\r\nnever speak of either of us?\"\r\n\r\n\"She spoke of both.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me what she said.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"I pray tell me--I can bear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid I have given you too much pain already. It is over now.\r\nLet it be over. Go home; and may God give you grace at the eleventh\r\nhour, and bring you and yours together again at last!\" she said\r\nfervently, and the tears starting in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I have no home but one; and to that I shall shortly go. But let me\r\nnot depart tormented with a yearning desire to hear all. Tell me; I\r\nask it of you as a favor. What was her state of mind as regarded her\r\nmother--her father--and her lover?\"\r\n\r\n\"God gave her grace to find him at last. The darkness and the\r\ndoubts that had distressed her, gradually disappeared. That grace\r\ntook possession of her heart which the world can neither give nor\r\nunderstand; and all was hope and tranquillity at the last hour.\r\n\r\n\"As she grew worse, her spirit became more and more composed. She told\r\nme so one day. Then she asked me whether I thought she could recover.\r\n\r\n\"I was silent.\r\n\r\n\"She turned pale. Her lips moved as she said, 'Do I understand your\r\nsilence rightly?'\r\n\r\n\"'I am afraid you do.'\r\n\r\n\"She was silent herself for a short time; then she said,\r\n\r\n\"'And so young!'\r\n\r\n\"'It is not for us to know the times and seasons which the Father hath\r\nkept in his own power,' said I.\r\n\r\n\"'But must I--must I die? I am not ashamed to own it,--I did so wish to\r\nlive. Did you never hear that I had a father living?' she asked in so\r\nlow a voice, that it was almost a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes,' I answered.\r\n\r\n\"'Then, you have heard his most unhappy history?'\r\n\r\n\"'Most of it, I believe, I have.'\r\n\r\n\"'He seems to you, I fear, a very--very erring man.'\r\n\r\n\"I was silent.\r\n\r\n\"'There is good in him still,' she cried; 'believe it or not who may,\r\nthere is good in him still.'\r\n\r\n\"And now her tears began to flow fast, as she went on,\r\n\r\n\"'The will of God be done! The will of God be done! But if it had been\r\nHis pleasure, I hoped to have lived! to have had that father home; to\r\nhave joined our two desolate hearts together; to have brought him to\r\nthe knowledge of One whose yoke is easy, and whose burden is light. O,\r\nwas that wish wrong, that it was not granted! O, my father! who shall\r\nseek you out now!'\r\n\r\n\"'Remember,' I said, gently, 'we are in the hands of One, wiser and\r\nmore merciful than ourselves. He would spare, surely, where we would\r\nspare, if it were good it should be so. If means would avail, He\r\nwould provide the means. His work will not stand still because the\r\ninstruments (as we regard things) seem taken away. Your death, dear\r\ngirl, may do more for your father's soul than your life could ever have\r\ndone.'\"\r\n\r\nAnd now, he bowed his head--humbly--and he covered his face with his\r\nhands, and the tears ran through his fingers.\r\n\r\n\"Thus,\" the lady went on, \"I comforted her, as I could; and she died:\r\nwith her last breath commending her father to the mercy of God.\r\n\r\n\"Her lover was dear--but not dearer than her father. She told me that\r\nhistory one day. How she had loved; how devotedly, how passionately.\r\nBut that when her name was disgraced, she had resolved never to unite\r\nit with his. She had withdrawn herself; she had done it in a way such\r\nas she believed would displease him. 'I thought he would feel it less\r\nif he were angry,' she said. 'I often wished in my desolation _I_ could\r\nfeel angry.' She told me his name; and I promised to make inquiries. I\r\nhad fortunately the opportunity. I had the pleasure to tell her, that\r\nhe had made the greatest efforts to find her out, but in vain; that\r\nhe had remained unmarried and constant to her memory: that what had\r\nhappened had given a new turn to his character. Habits of dissipation,\r\nwhich had been gradually acquiring power over him, had been entirely\r\nbroken through. He had accepted an office in a distant colony, where he\r\nwas leading a most useful and meritorious life. Never shall I forget\r\nthe glow of joy that illuminated her face when I told her so. She\r\nlooked already as if she had entered into the higher and more glorious\r\nexistence!\r\n\r\n\"'I shall not see him again,' said she; 'but you will write to him\r\nand tell him all. You will say that I died true and blest, because he\r\nwas what he was; and that I bade him a fond adieu, until we should\r\nmeet again in a better world. For, O! we shall meet again; I have a\r\ntestimony within, which shall not deceive me!'\r\n\r\n\"She then reverted to her father.\r\n\r\n\"'He will come back,' she said; 'you will see that he will come back,\r\nand he will inquire what is become of me--why his child has forgotten\r\nhim and is silent. It will be the silence and forgetfulness of the\r\ngrave. Perhaps he will come back as he went; his heart yet unchanged:\r\ndefying and despairing. Tell him _not_--be patient, with him, good\r\nkind friend, for my sake. There is good in him:--good he knows not of,\r\nhimself; that nobody knows of, but his loving child, and the God who\r\nmade him--weak and erring as he is. Tell him, he must no more be weak\r\nand erring; tell him there is forgiveness for all who will return at\r\nlast, but that forgiveness supposes newness of life. Tell him--\"\r\n\r\nThe sentence was unfinished by the lady, for he who listened fell\r\nprostrate on his face upon the floor.\r\n\r\nThey raised him up; but his heart seemed broken. He neither moved\r\nnor spoke. Life, however, was not extinct; for in this condition he\r\nremained many days.\r\n\r\nThey could not keep him where he was, for this benevolent institution\r\nwas strictly devoted to women of the more refined orders. He was\r\ncarried to a Hospital. There was nowhere else to carry him.\r\n\r\nSeven days he lay without speaking; but not absolutely senseless. The\r\nspirit within him was at work. In his worst days he had never wanted\r\nenergy. His heart was ever strong for good or for bad. What passed\r\nwithin him, in those seven days, was between his soul and the Highest.\r\nHe came out of his death-trance an altered creature.\r\n\r\nThe once handsome, dashing, profane, luxurious Julian Winstanley,\r\nlooked now a very old, old man. Quite gray, very thin, and stooping\r\nmuch. From that time, he continued to earn his bread honestly, as\r\nan attendant in the very hospital where he had been recovered. He\r\nhad a little room to himself, and it was filled with certain simple\r\ntreasures, hallowed by his recollections.\r\n\r\nHis patient and tender attendance upon the sick, his assiduous\r\ndischarge of all his duties, was beyond praise.\r\n\r\nOne day, a man who had risen to a very high post in one of our\r\ncolonies, came to visit him. The two were long together. When, they\r\nparted, it was evident that both had wept much.\r\n\r\nThe old man, after that, faded rapidly. One morning they found him\r\ndead in bed. His hands were clasped together, as if he had departed in\r\nthe act of prayer. He lies buried in a neighboring churchyard, under a\r\nsimple mound of earth, such as covers the humblest and the poorest.\r\n\r\nHe had left behind him a scrap of paper, earnestly imploring that so it\r\nmight be. So it was. May God forgive us all!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY NOVEL: OR, VARIETIES IN ENGLISH LIFE.[7]\r\n\r\n\r\n                     BY SIR EDWARD BULWER LYTTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII.--INITIAL CHAPTER.--THE ABUSE OF INTELLECT.\r\n\r\nThere is at present so vehement a flourish of trumpets, and so\r\nprodigious a roll of the drum, whenever we are called upon to throw\r\nup our hats, and cry \"Huzza\" to the \"March of Enlightenment,\" that,\r\nout of that very spirit of contradiction natural to all rational\r\nanimals, one is tempted to stop one's ears, and say, \"Gently, gently;\r\nLIGHT is noiseless; how comes 'Enlightenment' to make such a clatter?\r\nMeanwhile if it be not impertinent, pray, where is enlightenment\r\nmarching to?\" Ask that question of any six of the loudest bawlers\r\nin the procession, and I'll wager ten-pence to California that you\r\nget six very unsatisfactory answers. One respectable gentleman, who,\r\nto our great astonishment, insists upon calling himself a \"slave,\"\r\nbut has a remarkably free way of expressing his opinions, will\r\nreply--\"Enlightenment is marching towards the nine points of the\r\nCharter.\" Another with his hair _à la jeune France_, who has taken a\r\nfancy to his friend's wife, and is rather embarrassed with his own,\r\nasserts that Enlightenment is proceeding towards the Rights of Women,\r\nthe reign of Social Love, and the annihilation of Tyrannical Prejudice.\r\nA third, who has the air of a man well to do in the middle class, more\r\nmodest in his hopes, because he neither wishes to have his head broken\r\nby his errand-boy, nor his wife carried off to an Agapemone by his\r\napprentice, does not take Enlightenment a step farther than a siege\r\non Debrett, and a cannonade on the Budget. Illiberal man! the march\r\nthat he swells will soon trample _him_ under foot. No one fares so ill\r\nin a crowd, as the man who is wedged in the middle. A fourth, looking\r\nwild and dreamy, as if he had come out of the cave of Trophonius, and\r\nwho is a mesmerizer and a mystic, thinks Enlightenment is in full\r\ncareer towards the good old days of alchemists and necromancers. A\r\nfifth, whom one might take for a Quaker, asserts that the march of\r\nEnlightenment is a crusade for universal philanthropy, vegetable diet,\r\nand the perpetuation of peace, by means of speeches, which certainly\r\ndo produce a very contrary effect from the Philippics of Demosthenes!\r\nThe sixth--(good fellow, without a rag on his back)--does not care a\r\nstraw where the march goes. He can't be worse off than he is; and it\r\nis quite immaterial to him whether he goes to the dog-star above, or\r\nthe bottomless pit below. I say nothing, however, against the march,\r\nwhile we take it altogether. Whatever happens, one is in good company;\r\nand though I am somewhat indolent by nature, and would rather stay at\r\nhome with Locke and Burke, (dull dogs though they were,) than have my\r\nthoughts set off helter-skelter with those cursed trumpets and drums,\r\nblown and dub-a-dubbed by fellows that I vow to heaven I would not\r\ntrust with a five-pound note--still, if I must march, I must; and so\r\ndeuce take the hindmost. But when it comes to individual marchers upon\r\ntheir own account--privateers and condottieri of Enlightenment--who\r\nhave filled their pockets with lucifer-matches, and have a sublime\r\ncontempt for their neighbours' barns and hay-ricks, I don't see why I\r\nshould throw myself into the seventh heaven of admiration and ecstasy.\r\n\r\n[7] Continued from page 550.\r\n\r\nIf those who are eternally rhapsodizing on the celestial blessings\r\nthat are to follow Enlightenment, Universal Knowledge, and so forth,\r\nwould just take their eyes out of their pockets, and look about\r\nthem, I would respectfully inquire if they have never met any very\r\nknowing and enlightened gentleman, whose acquaintance is by no means\r\ndesirable. If not, they are monstrous lucky. Every man must judge by\r\nhis own experience; and the worst rogues I have ever encountered were\r\namazingly well-informed, clever fellows! From dunderheads and dunces\r\nwe can protect ourselves; but from your sharp-witted gentleman, all\r\nenlightenment and no prejudice, we have but to cry, \"Heaven defend us!\"\r\nIt is true, that the rogue (let him be ever so enlightened) usually\r\ncomes to no good himself, (though not before he has done harm enough to\r\nhis neighbors.) But that only shows that the world wants something else\r\nin those it rewards, besides intelligence _per se_ and in the abstract;\r\nand is much too old a world to allow any Jack Horner to pick out its\r\nplums for his own personal gratification. Hence a man of very moderate\r\nintelligence, who believes in God, suffers his heart to beat with human\r\nsympathies, and keeps his eyes off your strong-box, will perhaps gain a\r\nvast deal more power than knowledge ever gives to a rogue.\r\n\r\nWherefore, though I anticipate an outcry against me on the part of the\r\nblockheads, who, strange to say, are the most credulous idolaters of\r\nenlightenment, and, if knowledge were power, would rot on a dunghill;\r\nyet, nevertheless, I think all really enlightened men will agree with\r\nme, that when one falls in with detached sharpshooters from the general\r\nmarch of enlightenment, it is no reason to make ourselves a target,\r\nbecause enlightenment has furnished them with a gun. It has, doubtless,\r\nbeen already remarked by the judicious reader, that of the numerous\r\ncharacters introduced into this work, the larger portion belong to that\r\nspecies which we call INTELLECTUAL--that through them are analyzed\r\nand developed human intellect, in various forms and directions. So\r\nthat this History, rightly considered, is a kind of humble, familiar\r\nEpic, or, if you prefer it, a long Serio-Comedy, upon the varieties of\r\nEnglish Life in this our Century, set in movement by the intelligences\r\nmost prevalent. And where more ordinary and less refined types of\r\nthe species round and complete the survey of our passing generation,\r\nthey will often suggest, by contrast, the deficiencies which mere\r\nintellectual culture leaves in the human being. Certainly I have no\r\nspite against intellect and enlightenment. Heaven forbid I should be\r\nsuch a Goth. I am only the advocate for common sense and fair play. I\r\ndon't think an able man necessarily an angel; but I think if his heart\r\nmatch his head, and both proceed in the Great March under the divine\r\nOriflamme, he goes as near to the angel as humanity will permit; if\r\nnot, if he has but a penn'orth of heart to a pound of brains, I say,\r\n\"_Bon jour, mon ange?_ I see not the starry upward wings, but the\r\ngrovelling cloven-hoof.\" I'd rather be obfuscated by the Squire of\r\nHazeldean, than enlightened by Randal Leslie. Every man to his taste.\r\nBut intellect itself (not in the philosophical, but the ordinary sense\r\nof the term) is rarely, if ever, one completed harmonious agency; it is\r\nnot one faculty, but a compound of many, some of which are often at war\r\nwith each other, and mar the concord of the whole. Few of us but have\r\nsome predominant faculty, in itself a strength; but which (usurping\r\nunseasonably dominion over the rest) shares the lot of all tyranny,\r\nhowever brilliant, and leaves the empire weak against disaffection\r\nwithin, and invasion from without. Hence intellect maybe perverted\r\nin a man of evil disposition, and sometimes merely wasted in a man\r\nof excellent impulses, for want of the necessary discipline, or of a\r\nstrong ruling motive. I doubt if there be one person in the world, who\r\nhas attained a high reputation for talent, who has not met somebody\r\nmuch cleverer than himself, which said somebody has never obtained any\r\nreputation at all! Men, like Audley Egerton, are constantly seen in the\r\ngreat positions of life; while men, like Harley l'Estrange, who could\r\nhave beaten them hollow in any thing equally striven for by both, float\r\naway down the stream, and, unless some sudden stimulant arouse the\r\ndreamy energies, vanish out of sight into silent graves. If Hamlet and\r\nPolonius were living now, Polonius would have a much better chance of\r\nbeing Chancellor of the Exchequer, though Hamlet would unquestionably\r\nbe a much more intellectual character. What would become of Hamlet?\r\nHeaven knows! Dr. Arnold said, from his experience of a school, that\r\nthe difference between one man and another was not mere ability--it was\r\nenergy. There is a great deal of truth in that saying.\r\n\r\nSubmitting these hints to the judgment and penetration of the\r\nsagacious, I enter on the fresh division of this work, and see\r\nalready Randal Leslie gnawing his lip on the back ground. The German\r\npoet observes, that the Cow of Isis is to some the divine symbol of\r\nknowledge, to others but the milch cow, only regarded for the pounds of\r\nbutter she will yield. O tendency of our age, to look on Isis as the\r\nmilch cow! O prostitution of the grandest desires to the basest uses!\r\nGaze on the goddess, Randal Leslie, and get ready thy churn and thy\r\nscales. Let us see what the butter will fetch in the market.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nA new reign has commenced. There has been a general election; the\r\nunpopularity of the Administration has been apparent at the hustings.\r\nAudley Egerton, hitherto returned by vast majorities, has barely\r\nescaped defeat--thanks to a majority of five. The expenses of his\r\nelection are said to have been prodigious. \"But who can stand against\r\nsuch wealth as Egerton's--no doubt backed, too, by the Treasury purse?\"\r\nsaid the defeated candidate. It is towards the close of October; London\r\nis already full; Parliament will meet in less than a fortnight.\r\n\r\nIn one of the principal apartments of that hotel in which foreigners\r\nmay discover what is meant by English comfort, and the price which\r\nforeigners must pay for it, there sat two persons, side by side,\r\nengaged in close conversation. The one was a female, in whose pale\r\nclear complexion and raven hair--in whose eyes, vivid with a power\r\nof expression rarely bestowed on the beauties of the north, we\r\nrecognize Beatrice, Marchesa di Negra. Undeniably handsome as was\r\nthe Italian lady, her companion, though a man, and far advanced\r\ninto middle age, was yet more remarkable for personal advantages.\r\nThere was a strong family likeness between the two; but there was\r\nalso a striking contrast in air, manner, and all that stamps on the\r\nphysiognomy the idiosyncrasies of character. There was something\r\nof gravity, of earnestness and passion, in Beatrice's countenance\r\nwhen carefully examined; her smile at times might be false, but it\r\nwas rarely ironical, never cynical. Her gestures, though graceful,\r\nwere unrestrained and frequent. You could see she was a daughter of\r\nthe south. Her companion, on the contrary, preserved on the fair\r\nsmooth face, to which years had given scarcely a line or wrinkle,\r\nsomething that might have passed, at first glance for the levity and\r\nthoughtlessness of a gay and youthful nature; but the smile, though\r\nexquisitely polished, took at times the derision of a sneer. In his\r\nmanners he was as composed and as free from gesture as an Englishman.\r\nHis hair was of that red brown with which the Italian painters produce\r\nsuch marvellous effects of color; and if here and there a silver thread\r\ngleamed through the locks it was lost at once amidst their luxuriance.\r\nHis eyes were light, and his complexion though without much color, was\r\nsingularly transparent. His beauty, indeed, would have been rather\r\nwomanly than masculine, but for the height and sinewy spareness of a\r\nframe in which muscular strength was rather adorned than concealed\r\nby an admirable elegance of proportion. You would never have guessed\r\nthis man to be an Italian; more likely you would have supposed him a\r\nParisian. He conversed in French, his dress was of French fashion, his\r\nmode of thought seemed French. Not that he was like the Frenchmen of\r\nthe present day--an animal, either rude or reserved; but your ideal of\r\nthe _Marquis_ of the old _régime_--the _roué_ of the Regency.\r\n\r\nItalian, however, he was, and of a race renowned in Italian history.\r\nBut as if ashamed of his country and his birth, he affected to be\r\na citizen of the world. Heaven help the world if it hold only such\r\ncitizens!\r\n\r\n\"But, Giulio,\" said Beatrice di Negra, speaking in Italian, \"even\r\ngranting that you discover this girl, can you suppose that her father\r\nwill ever consent to your alliance? Surely you know too well the nature\r\nof your kinsman?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Tu te trompes, ma soeur_,\" replied Giulio Franzini, Count di\r\nPeschiera, in French as usual--\"_tu te trompes_; I knew it before he\r\nhad gone through exile and penury. How can I know it now? But comfort\r\nyourself, my too anxious Beatrice, I shall not care for his consent\r\ntill I have made sure of his daughter's.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how win that in despite of the father?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Eh, mordieu?_\" interrupted the Count, with true French gayety; \"what\r\nwould become of all the comedies ever written, if marriages were not\r\nmade in despite of the father? Look you,\" he resumed, with a very\r\nslight compression of his lip, and a still slighter movement in his\r\nchair; \"look you, this is no question of ifs and buts--it is a question\r\nof must and shall--a question of existence to you and to me. When\r\nDanton was condemned to the guillotine, he said, flinging a pellet of\r\nbread at the nose of his respectable judge--'_Mon individu sera bientôt\r\ndans le néant_'--My patrimony is there already! I am loaded with debts.\r\nI see before me, on the one side, ruin or suicide; on the other side,\r\nwedlock and wealth.\"\r\n\r\n\"But from those vast possessions which you have been permitted to enjoy\r\nso long, have you really saved nothing against the time when they might\r\nbe reclaimed at your hands?\"\r\n\r\n\"My sister,\" replied the Count, \"do I look like a man who saved?\r\nBesides, when the Austrian Emperor, unwilling to raise from his\r\nLombard domains a name and a house so illustrious as our kinsman's,\r\nand desirous, while punishing that kinsman's rebellion, to reward\r\nmy adherence, forbore the peremptory confiscation of those vast\r\npossessions at which my mouth waters while we speak, but, annexing\r\nthem to the Crown during pleasure, allowed me, as the next of male\r\nkin, to retain the revenues of one-half for the same very indefinite\r\nperiod--had I not every reason to suppose, that, before long, I could\r\nso influence his Majesty or his minister, as to obtain a decree\r\nthat might transfer the whole, unconditionally and absolutely, to\r\nmyself? And methinks I should have done so, but for this accursed,\r\nintermeddling English Milord, who has never ceased to besiege the court\r\nor the minister with alleged extenuations of our cousin's rebellion,\r\nand proofless assertions that I shared it in order to entangle my\r\nkinsman, and betrayed it in order to profit by his spoils. So that,\r\nat last, in return for all my services, and in answer to all my\r\nclaims, I received from the minister himself this cold reply: 'Count\r\nof Peschiera, your aid was important, and your reward has been large.\r\nThat reward, it would not be for your honor to extend, and justify the\r\nill opinion of your Italian countrymen by formally appropriating to\r\nyourself all that was forfeited by the treason you denounced. A name so\r\nnoble as yours should be dearer to you than fortune itself.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Giulio,\" cried Beatrice, her face lighting up, changed in its\r\nwhole character; \"those were words that might make the demon that\r\ntempts to avarice fly from your breast in shame.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count opened his eyes in great amaze; then he glanced round the\r\nroom and said, quietly:\r\n\r\n\"Nobody else hears you, my dear Beatrice, talk common sense. Heroics\r\nsound well in mixed society; but there is nothing less suited to the\r\ntone of a family conversation.\"\r\n\r\nMadame di Negra bent down her head abashed, and that sudden change\r\nin the expression of her countenance, which had seemed to betray\r\nsusceptibility to generous emotion, faded as suddenly away.\r\n\r\n\"But still,\" she said coldly, \"you enjoy one-half of those ample\r\nrevenues--why talk, then, of suicide and ruin?\"\r\n\r\n\"I enjoy them at the pleasure of the crown; and what if it be the\r\npleasure of the crown to recall our cousin, and reinstate him in his\r\npossessions?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a _probability_, then, of that pardon? When you first\r\nemployed me in your researches, you only thought there was a\r\n_possibility_.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a great probability of it, and therefore I am here. I\r\nlearned some little time since that the question of such recall had\r\nbeen suggested by the Emperor, and discussed in Council. The danger\r\nto the State, which might arise from our cousin's wealth, his alleged\r\nabilities--(abilities! bah!)--and his popular name, deferred any\r\ndecision on the point; and, indeed, the difficulty of dealing with\r\nmyself must have embarrassed the ministry. But it is a mere question\r\nof time. He cannot long remain excluded from the general amnesty,\r\nalready extended to the other refugees. The person who gave me this\r\ninformation is high in power, and friendly to myself; and he added a\r\npiece of advice, on which I acted. 'It was intimated,' said he, 'by one\r\nof the partisans of your kinsman, that the exile could give a hostage\r\nfor his loyalty in the person of his daughter and heiress; that she\r\nhad arrived at marriageable age; that if she were to wed, with the\r\nEmperor's consent, some one whose attachment to the Austrian crown was\r\nunquestionable, there would be a guarantee both for the faith of the\r\nfather, and for the transmission of so important a heritage to safe\r\nand loyal hands. Why not' (continued my friend) 'apply to the Emperor\r\nfor his consent to that alliance for yourself?--you, on whom he can\r\ndepend;--you who, if the daughter should die, would be the legal heir\r\nto those lands?' On that hint I spoke.\"\r\n\r\n\"You saw the Emperor?\"\r\n\r\n\"And after combating the unjust prepossessions against me, I stated,\r\nthat so far from my cousin having any fair cause of resentment against\r\nme, when all was duly explained to him, I did not doubt that he would\r\nwillingly give me the hand of his child.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did?\" cried the Marchesa, amazed.\r\n\r\n\"And,\" continued the Count imperturbably, as he smoothed, with careless\r\nhand, the snowy plaits of his shirt front--\"and that I should thus\r\nhave the happiness of becoming myself the guarantee of my kinsman's\r\nloyalty--the agent for the restoration of his honors, while, in the\r\neyes of the envious and malignant, I should clear up my own name from\r\nall suspicion that I had wronged him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the Emperor consented?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Pardieu_, my dear sister. What else could his majesty do? My\r\nproposition smoothed every obstacle, and reconciled policy with mercy.\r\nIt remains, therefore, only to find out, what has hitherto baffled all\r\nour researches, the retreat of our dear kinsfolk, and to make myself a\r\nwelcome lover to the demoiselle. There is some disparity of years, I\r\nown; but--unless your sex and my glass flatter me overmuch--I am still\r\na match for many a gallant of five-and-twenty.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count said this with so charming a smile, and looked so\r\npre-eminently handsome, that he carried off the coxcombry of the words\r\nas gracefully as if they had been spoken by some dazzling hero of the\r\ngrand old comedy of Parisian life.\r\n\r\nThen interlacing his fingers, and lightly leaning his hands, thus\r\nclasped, upon his sister's shoulder, he looked into her face, and said\r\nslowly--\"And now, my sister, for some gentle but deserved reproach.\r\nHave you not sadly failed me in the task I imposed on your regard for\r\nmy interests? Is it not some years since you first came to England\r\non the mission of discovering these worthy relatives of ours? Did I\r\nnot entreat you to seduce into your toils the man whom I knew to be\r\nmy enemy, and was indubitably acquainted with our cousin's retreat--a\r\nsecret he has hitherto locked within his bosom? Did you not tell me,\r\nthat though he was then in England, you could find no occasion even to\r\nmeet him, but that you had obtained the friendship of the statesman to\r\nwhom I directed your attention, as his most intimate associate? And yet\r\nyou, whose charms are usually so irresistible, learn nothing from the\r\nstatesman, as you see nothing of _Milord_. Nay, baffled and misled, you\r\nactually supposed that the quarry has taken refuge in France. You go\r\nthither--you pretend to search the capital--the provinces, Switzerland,\r\n_que sais-je_?--all in vain,--though--_foi de gentilhomme_--your police\r\ncost me dearly,--you return to England--the same chase, and the same\r\nresult. _Palsambleu, ma soeur_, I do too much credit to your talents\r\nnot to question your zeal. In a word have you been in earnest--or have\r\nyou not had some womanly pleasure in amusing yourself and abusing my\r\ntrust?\"\r\n\r\n\"Giulio,\" answered Beatrice sadly, \"you know the influence you have\r\nexercised over my character and my fate. Your reproaches are not just.\r\nI made such inquiries as were in my power, and I have now cause to\r\nbelieve that I know one who is possessed of this secret, and can guide\r\nus to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you do!\" exclaimed the Count. Beatrice did not heed the\r\nexclamation, but hurried on.\r\n\r\n\"But grant that my heart shrunk from the task you imposed on me, would\r\nit not have been natural? When I first came to England, you informed\r\nme that your object in discovering the exiles was one which I could\r\nhonestly aid. You naturally desired first to know if the daughter\r\nlived; if not, you were the heir. If she did, you assured me you\r\ndesired to effect, through my mediation, some liberal compromise with\r\nAlphonso, by which you would have sought to obtain his restoration,\r\nprovided he would leave you for life in possession of the grant you\r\nhold from the crown. While these were your objects, I did my best,\r\nineffectual as it was, to obtain the information required.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what made me lose so important though so ineffectual an ally?\"\r\nasked the Count, still smiling; but a gleam that belied the smile shot\r\nfrom his eye.\r\n\r\n\"What! when you bade me receive and co-operate with the miserable\r\nspies--the false Italians--whom you sent over, and seek to entangle\r\nthis poor exile, when found in some rash correspondence, to be revealed\r\nto the court; when you sought to seduce the daughter of the Count\r\nof Peschiera, the descendant of those who had ruled in Italy, into\r\nthe informer, the corrupter, and the traitress! No, Giulio--then I\r\nrecoiled; and then, fearful of your own sway over me, I retreated into\r\nFrance. I have answered you frankly.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count removed his hands from the shoulders on which they had\r\nreclined so cordially.\r\n\r\n\"And this,\" said he, \"is your wisdom, and this your gratitude.\r\nYou, whose fortunes are bound up in mine--you, who subsist on my\r\nbounty--you, who--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold,\" cried the Marchesa, rising, and with a burst of emotion, as\r\nif stung to the utmost, and breaking into revolt from the tyranny of\r\nyears--\"Hold--gratitude! bounty! Brother, brother--what, indeed, do I\r\nowe to you? The shame and the misery of a life. While yet a child, you\r\ncondemned me to marry against my will--against my heart--against my\r\nprayers--and laughed at my tears when I knelt to you for mercy. I was\r\npure then, Giulio--pure and innocent as the flowers in my virgin crown.\r\nAnd now--now--\"\r\n\r\nBeatrice stopped abruptly, and clasped her hands before her face.\r\n\r\n\"Now you upbraid me,\" said the Count, unruffled by her sudden passion,\r\n\"because I gave you in marriage to a man young and noble?\"\r\n\r\n\"Old in vices and mean of soul! The marriage I forgave you. You had the\r\nright, according to the customs of our country, to dispose of my hand.\r\nBut I forgave you not the consolations that you whispered in the ear of\r\na wretched and insulted wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me the remark,\" replied the Count, with a courtly bend of his\r\nhead, \"but those consolations were also conformable to the customs of\r\nour country, and I was not aware till now that you had wholly disdained\r\nthem. And,\" continued the Count, \"you were not so long a wife that the\r\ngall of the chain should smart still. You were soon left a widow--free,\r\nchildless, young, beautiful.\"\r\n\r\n\"And penniless.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, Di Negra was a gambler, and very unlucky; no fault of mine. I\r\ncould neither keep the cards from his hands, nor advise him how to play\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"And my own portion? Oh, Giulio, I knew but at his death why you had\r\ncondemned me to that renegade Genoese. He owed you money, and, against\r\nhonor, and I believe against law, you had accepted my fortune in\r\ndischarge of the debt.\"\r\n\r\n\"He had no other way to discharge it--a debt of honor must be paid--old\r\nstories these. \"What matters? Since then my purse has been open to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, not as your sister, but your instrument--your spy! Yes, your\r\npurse has been open--with a niggard hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Un peu de conscience, ma chère_, you are so extravagant. But come, be\r\nplain. What would you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would be free from you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is, you would form some second marriage with one of these rich\r\nisland lords. _Ma foi_, I respect your ambition.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not so high. I aim but to escape from slavery--to be placed\r\nbeyond dishonorable temptation. I desire,\" cried Beatrice with\r\nincreased emotion, \"I desire to re-enter the life of woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eno'!\" said the Count with a visible impatience, \"is there anything\r\nin the attainment of your object that should render you indifferent to\r\nmine? You desire to marry, if I comprehend you right. And to marry, as\r\nbecomes you, you should bring to your husband not debts, but a dowry.\r\nBe it so. I will restore the portion that I saved from the spendthrift\r\nclutch of the Genoese--the moment that it is mine to bestow--- the\r\nmoment that I am husband to my kinsman's heiress. And now, Beatrice,\r\nyou imply that my former notions revolted your conscience; my present\r\nplan should content it; for by this marriage shall our kinsman regain\r\nhis country, and repossess, at least, half his lands. And if I am not\r\nan excellent husband to the demoiselle, it will be her own fault. I\r\nhave sown my wild oats. _Je suis bon prince_, when I have things a\r\nlittle my own way. It is my hope and my intention, and certainly it\r\nwill be my interest, to become _digne époux et irréproachable pire de\r\nfamille_. I speak lightly--'tis my way. I mean seriously. The little\r\ngirl will be very happy with me, and I shall succeed in soothing all\r\nresentment her father may retain. Will you aid me then--yes or no? Aid\r\nme, and you shall indeed be free. The magician will release the fair\r\nspirit he has bound to his will. Aid me not, _ma chère_, and mark,\r\nI do not threaten--I do but warn--aid me not; grant that I become a\r\nbeggar, and ask yourself what is to become of you--still young, still\r\nbeautiful, and still penniless? Nay, worse than penniless; you have\r\ndone me the honor (and here the Count, looking on the table, drew a\r\nletter from a portfolio, emblazoned with his arms and coronet), you\r\nhave done me the honor to consult me as to your debts.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will restore my fortune?\" said the Marchesa, irresolutely--and\r\naverting her head from an odious schedule of figures.\r\n\r\n\"When my own, with your aid, is secured.\"\r\n\r\n\"But do you not overrate the value of my aid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly,\" said the Count, with a caressing suavity--and he kissed his\r\nsister's forehead. \"Possibly; but by my honor, I wish to repair to you\r\nany wrong, real or supposed, I may have done you in past times. I wish\r\nto find again my own dear sister. I may overvalue your aid, but not the\r\naffection from which it comes. Let us be friends, _cara Beatrice Mia_,\"\r\nadded the Count, for the first time employing Italian words.\r\n\r\nThe Marchesa laid her head on his shoulder, and her tears flowed\r\nsoftly. Evidently this man had great influence over her--and evidently,\r\nwhatever her cause for complaint, her affection for him was still\r\nsisterly and strong. A nature with fine flashes of generosity, spirit,\r\nhonor, and passion, was hers--but uncultured, unguided--spoilt by\r\nthe worst social examples--easily led into wrong--not always aware\r\nwhere the wrong was--letting affections good or bad whisper away her\r\nconscience or blind her reason. Such women are often far more dangerous\r\nwhen induced to wrong, than those who are thoroughly abandoned--such\r\nwomen are the accomplices men like the Count of Peschiera most desire\r\nto obtain.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Giulio,\" said Beatrice, after a pause, and looking up at him\r\nthrough her tears, \"when you speak to me thus, you know you can do with\r\nme what you will. Fatherless and motherless, whom had my childhood to\r\nlove and obey but you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear Beatrice,\" murmured the Count tenderly--and he again kissed her\r\nforehead. \"So,\" he continued more carelessly--\"so the reconciliation\r\nis effected, and our interests and our hearts re-allied. Now, alas! to\r\ndescend to business. You say that you know some one whom you believe to\r\nbe acquainted with the lurking-place of my father-in-law--that is to\r\nbe!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so. You remind me that I have an appointment with him this\r\nday: it is near the hour--I must leave you.\"\r\n\r\n\"To learn the secret?--Quick--quick. I have no fear of your success, if\r\nit is by his heart that you lead him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mistake; on his heart I have no hold. But he has a friend who\r\nloves me, and honorably, and whose cause he pleads. I think here that\r\nI have some means to control or persuade him. If not--ah, he is of a\r\ncharacter that perplexes me in all but his worldly ambition; and how\r\ncan we foreigners influence him through _that_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he poor, or is he extravagant?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not extravagant, and not positively poor, but dependent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we have him,\" said the Count composedly. \"If his assistance he\r\nworth buying, we can bid high for it. _Sur mon âme_, I never yet knew\r\nmoney fail with any man who was both worldly and dependent. I put him\r\nand myself in your hands.\"\r\n\r\nThus saying, the Count opened the door, and conducted his sister with\r\nformal politeness to her carriage. He then returned, reseated himself,\r\nand mused in silence. As he did so, the muscles of his countenance\r\nrelaxed. The levity of the Frenchman fled from his visage, and in\r\nhis eye, as it gazed abstractedly into space, there was that steady\r\ndepth so remarkable in the old portraits of Florentine diplomatist or\r\nVenetian oligarch. Thus seen, there was in that face, despite all its\r\nbeauty, something that would have awed back even the fond gaze of love;\r\nsomething hard, collected, inscrutable, remorseless; but this change\r\nof countenance did not last long. Evidently thought, though intense\r\nfor the moment, was not habitual to the man. Evidently he had lived\r\nthe life which takes all things lightly--so he rose with a look of\r\nfatigue, shook and stretched himself, as if to cast off, or grow out\r\nof, an unwelcome and irksome mood. An hour afterwards, the Count of\r\nPeschiera was charming all eyes, and pleasing all ears, in the saloon\r\nof a high-born beauty, whose acquaintance he had made at Vienna, and\r\nwhose charms, according to that old and never-truth-speaking oracle,\r\nPolite Scandal, were now said to have attracted to London the brilliant\r\nforeigner.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nThe Marchesa regained her house, which was in Curzon street, and\r\nwithdrew to her own room, to readjust her dress, and remove from her\r\ncountenance all traces of the tears she had shed.\r\n\r\nHalf-an-hour afterwards she was seated in her drawing-room, composed\r\nand calm; nor, seeing her then, could you have guessed that she was\r\ncapable of so much emotion and so much weakness. In that stately\r\nexterior, in that quiet attitude, in that elaborate and finished\r\nelegance which comes alike from the arts of the toilet and the\r\nconventional repose of rank, you could see but the woman of the world\r\nand the great lady.\r\n\r\nA knock at the door was heard, and in a few moments there entered a\r\nvisitor, with the easy familiarity of intimate acquaintance--a young\r\nman, but with none of the bloom of youth. His hair, fine as a woman's,\r\nwas thin and scanty, but it fell low over the forehead, and concealed\r\nthat noblest of our human features. \"A gentleman,\" says Apuleius,\r\n\"ought, if he can, to wear his whole mind on his forehead.\"[8] The\r\nyoung visitor would never have committed so frank an imprudence. His\r\ncheek was pale, and in his step and in his movements there was a\r\nlanguor that spoke of fatigued nerves or delicate health. But the light\r\nof the eye and the tone of the voice were those of a mental temperament\r\ncontrolling the bodily--vigorous and energetic. For the rest, his\r\ngeneral appearance was distinguished by a refinement alike intellectual\r\nand social. Once seen, you would not easily forget him. And the reader\r\nno doubt already recognizes Randal Leslie. His salutation, as I before\r\nsaid, was that of intimate familiarity; yet it was given and replied\r\nto with that unreserved openness which denotes the absence of a more\r\ntender sentiment.\r\n\r\n[8] I must be pardoned for annexing the original, since it loses much\r\nby translation:--\"Hominem liberum et magnificum debere, si queat, in\r\nprimori fronte, animum gestare.\"\r\n\r\nSeating himself by the Marchesa's side, Randal began first to converse\r\non the fashionable topics and gossip of the day; but it was observable,\r\nthat, while he extracted from her the current anecdote and scandal\r\nof the great world, neither anecdote nor scandal did he communicate\r\nin return. Randal Leslie had already learned the art not to commit\r\nhimself, nor to have quoted against him one ill-natured remark upon the\r\neminent. Nothing more injures the man who would rise beyond the fame\r\nof the _salons_, than to be considered backbiter and gossip; \"yet it\r\nis always useful,\" thought Randal Leslie, \"to know the foibles--the\r\nsmall social and private springs by which the great are moved. Critical\r\noccasions may arise in which such knowledge may be power.\" And hence,\r\nperhaps, (besides a more private motive, soon to be perceived,) Randal\r\ndid not consider his time thrown away in cultivating Madame di Negra's\r\nfriendship. For despite much that was whispered against her, she had\r\nsucceeded in dispelling the coldness with which she had at first been\r\nreceived in the London circles. Her beauty, her grace, and her high\r\nbirth, had raised her into fashion, and the homage of men of the first\r\nstation, while it perhaps injured her reputation as a woman, added to\r\nher celebrity as fine lady. So much do we cold English, prudes though\r\nwe be, forgive to the foreigner what we avenge on the native.\r\n\r\nSliding at last from these general topics into very well-bred and\r\nelegant personal compliment, and reciting various eulogies, which Lord\r\nthis and the Duke of that had passed on the Marchesa's charms, Randal\r\nlaid his hand on hers, with the license of admitted friendship, and\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\"But since you have deigned to confide in me, since when (happily\r\nfor me, and with a generosity which no coquette could have been\r\ncapable) you, in good time, repressed into friendship feelings that\r\nmight else have ripened into those you are formed to inspire and\r\ndisdain to return, you told me with your charming smile, 'Let no one\r\nspeak to me of love who does not offer me his hand, and with it the\r\nmeans to supply tastes that I fear are terribly extravagant;'--since\r\nthus you allowed me to divine your natural objects, and upon that\r\nunderstanding our intimacy has been founded, you will pardon me for\r\nsaying that the admiration you excite amongst the _grands seigneurs_\r\nI have named, only serves to defeat your own purpose, and scare away\r\nadmirers less brilliant, but more in earnest. Most of these gentlemen\r\nare unfortunately married; and they who are not belong to those\r\nmembers of our aristocracy who, in marriage, seek more than beauty and\r\nwit--namely, connections to strengthen their political station, or\r\nwealth to redeem a mortgage and sustain a title.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Mr. Leslie,\" replied the Marchesa--and a certain sadness might\r\nbe detected in the tone of the voice and the droop of the eye--\"I have\r\nlived long enough in the real world to appreciate the baseness and the\r\nfalsehood of most of those sentiments which take the noblest names. I\r\nsee through the hearts of the admirers you parade before me, and know\r\nthat not one of them would shelter with his ermine the woman to whom he\r\ntalks of his heart. Ah,\" continued Beatrice, with a softness of which\r\nshe was unconscious, but which might have been extremely dangerous to\r\nyouth less steeled and self-guarded than was Randal Leslie's--\"ah,\r\nI am less ambitious than you suppose. I have dreamed of a friend, a\r\ncompanion, a protector, with feelings still fresh, undebased by the\r\nlow round of vulgar dissipation and mean pleasures--of a heart so new,\r\nthat it might restore my own to what it was in its happy spring. I have\r\nseen in your country some marriages, the mere contemplation of which\r\nhas filled my eyes with delicious tears. I have learned in England to\r\nknow the value of home. And with such a heart as I describe, and such a\r\nhome, I could forget that I ever knew a less pure ambition.\"\r\n\r\n\"This language does not surprise me,\" said Randal; \"yet it does not\r\nharmonize with your former answer to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"To you,\" repeated Beatrice smiling, and regaining her lighter manner;\r\n\"to you--true. But I never had the vanity to think that your affection\r\nfor me could bear the sacrifices it would cost you in marriage; that\r\nyou, with your ambition, could bound your dreams of happiness to home.\r\nAnd then, too,\" said she, raising her head, and with a certain grave\r\npride in her air--\"and _then_, I could not have consented to share my\r\nfate with one whom my poverty would cripple. I could not listen to my\r\nheart, if it had beat for a lover without fortune, for to him I could\r\nthen have brought but a burden, and betrayed him into a union with\r\npoverty and debt. Now it may be different. Now I may have the dowry\r\nthat befits my birth. And now I may be free to choose according to my\r\nheart as woman, not according to my necessities, as one poor, harassed,\r\nand despairing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said Randal, interested and drawing still closer towards his fair\r\ncompanion--\"ah, I congratulate you sincerely; you have cause, then, to\r\nthink that you shall be--rich?\"\r\n\r\nThe Marchesa paused before she answered, and during that pause Randal\r\nrelaxed the web of the scheme which he had been secretly weaving, and\r\nrapidly considered whether, if Beatrice di Negra would indeed be rich,\r\nshe might answer to himself as a wife; and in what way, if so, he had\r\nbest change his tone from that of friendship into that of love. While\r\nthus reflecting, Beatrice answered--\r\n\r\n\"Not rich for an Englishwoman; for an Italian, yes. My fortune should\r\nbe half a million--\"\r\n\r\n\"Half a million!\" cried Randal, and with difficulty he restrained\r\nhimself from falling at her feet in adoration.\r\n\r\n\"Of francs!\" continued the Marchesa.\r\n\r\n\"Francs! Ah,\" said Randal, with a long-drawn breath, and recovering\r\nfrom his sudden enthusiasm, \"about twenty thousand pounds!--eight\r\nhundred a-year at four per cent. A very handsome portion,\r\ncertainly--(Genteel poverty! he murmured to himself. What an escape\r\nI have had! but I see--I see. This will smooth all difficulties in\r\nthe way of my better and earlier project. I see)--a very handsome\r\nportion,\" he repeated aloud--\"not for a _grand seigneur_, indeed, but\r\nstill for a gentleman of birth and expectations worthy of your choice,\r\nif ambition be not your first object. Ah, while you spoke with such\r\nendearing eloquence of feelings that were fresh, of a heart that was\r\nnew, of the happy English home, you might guess that my thoughts ran to\r\nmy friend who loves you so devotedly, and who so realizes your ideal.\r\nProvidentially, with us, happy marriages and happy homes are found not\r\nin the gay circles of London fashion, but at the hearths of our rural\r\nnobility--our untitled country gentlemen. And who, amongst all your\r\nadorers, can offer you a lot so really enviable as the one whom, I see\r\nby your blush, you already guess that I refer to?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did I blush?\" said the Marchesa, with a silvery laugh. \"Nay, I think\r\nthat your zeal for your friend misled you. But I will own frankly, I\r\nhave been touched by his honest ingenuous love--so evident, yet rather\r\nlooked than spoken. I have contrasted the love that honors me with the\r\nsuitors that seek to degrade; more I cannot say. For though I grant\r\nthat your friend is handsome, high-spirited, and generous, still he is\r\nnot what--\"\r\n\r\n\"You mistake, believe me,\" interrupted Randal. \"You shall not finish\r\nyour sentence. He is all that you do not yet suppose him; for his\r\nshyness, and his very love, his very respect for your superiority, do\r\nnot allow his mind and his nature to appear to advantage. You, it is\r\ntrue, have a taste for letters and poetry rare among your countrywomen.\r\nHe has not at present--few men have. But what Cimon would not be\r\nrefined by so fair an Iphigenia? Such frivolities as he now shows\r\nbelong but to youth and inexperience of life. Happy the brother who\r\ncould see his sister the wife of Frank Hazeldean.\"\r\n\r\nThe Marchesa leant her cheek on her hand in silence. To her, marriage\r\nwas more than it usually seems to dreaming maiden or to disconsolate\r\nwidow. So had the strong desire to escape from the control of her\r\nunprincipled and remorseless brother grown a part of her very soul--so\r\nhad whatever was best and highest in her very mixed and complex\r\ncharacter been galled and outraged by her friendless and exposed\r\nposition, the equivocal worship rendered to her beauty, the various\r\ndebasements to which pecuniary embarrassments had subjected her--(not\r\nwithout design on the part of the count, who, though grasping, was not\r\nmiserly, and who by precarious and seemingly capricious gifts at one\r\ntime, and refusals of all aid at another, had involved her in debt in\r\norder to retain his hold on her)--so utterly painful and humiliating to\r\na woman of her pride and her birth was the station that she held in the\r\nworld--that in marriage she saw liberty, life, honor, self-redemption;\r\nand these thoughts, while they compelled her to co-operate with the\r\nschemes, by which the count, on securing to himself a bride, was to\r\nbestow on herself a dower, also disposed her now to receive with favour\r\nRandal Leslie's pleadings on behalf of his friend.\r\n\r\nThe advocate saw that he had made an impression, and with the\r\nmarvellous skill which his knowledge of those natures that engaged\r\nhis study bestowed on his intelligence, he continued to improve his\r\ncause by such representations as were likely to be most effective.\r\nWith what admirable tact he avoided panegyric of Frank as the mere\r\nindividual, and drew him rather as the type, the ideal of what a woman\r\nin Beatrice's position might desire, in the safety, peace, and honor\r\nof a home, in the trust, and constancy, and honest confiding love of\r\nits partner! He did not paint an Elysium; he described a haven; he did\r\nnot glowingly delineate a hero of romance--he soberly portrayed that\r\nRepresentative of the Respectable and the Real which a woman turns to\r\nwhen romance begins to seem to her but delusion. Verily, if you could\r\nhave looked into the heart of the person he addressed, and heard him\r\nspeak, you would have cried admiringly, \"Knowledge _is_ power; and this\r\nman, if as able on a larger field of action, should play no mean part\r\nin the history of his time.\"\r\n\r\nSlowly Beatrice roused herself from the reveries which crept over her\r\nas he spoke--slowly, and with a deep sigh, and said--\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, grant all you say; at least before I can listen to so\r\nhonorable a love, I must be relieved from the base and sordid pressure\r\nthat weighs on me. I cannot say to the man who woos me, 'Will you pay\r\nthe debts of the daughter of Franzini, and the widow of di Negra?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, your debts, surely, make so slight a portion of your dowry.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the dowry has to be secured;\" and here, turning the tables upon\r\nher companion, as the apt proverb expresses it, Madame di Negra\r\nextended her hand to Randal, and said in her most winning accents, \"You\r\nare, then, truly and sincerely my friend?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you doubt it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I prove that I do not, for I ask your assistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mine? How?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen; my brother has arrived in London--\"\r\n\r\n\"I see that arrival announced in the papers.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he comes, empowered by the consent of the Emperor, to ask the hand\r\nof a relation and countrywoman of his; an alliance that will heal long\r\nfamily dissensions, and add to his own fortunes those of an heiress.\r\nMy brother, like myself, has been extravagant. The dowry which by law\r\nhe still owes me it would distress him to pay till this marriage be\r\nassured.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" said Randal. \"But how can I aid this marriage?\"\r\n\r\n\"By assisting us to discover the bride. She, with her father, sought\r\nrefuge and concealment in England.\"\r\n\r\n\"The father had, then, taken part in some political disaffections, and\r\nwas proscribed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly so; and so well has he concealed himself that he has baffled\r\nall our efforts to discover his retreat. My brother can obtain him his\r\npardon in cementing this alliance--\"\r\n\r\n\"Proceed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah Randal, Randal, is this the frankness of friendship? You know\r\nthat I have before sought to obtain the secret of our relation's\r\nretreat--sought in vain to obtain it from Mr. Egerton, who assuredly\r\nknows it--\"\r\n\r\n\"But who communicates no secrets to living man,\" said Randal, almost\r\nbitterly; \"who, close and compact as iron, is as little malleable to me\r\nas to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me. I know you so well that I believe you could attain to any\r\nsecret you sought earnestly to acquire. Nay, more, I believe that you\r\nknow already that secret which I ask you to share with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What on earth makes you think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"When, some weeks ago you asked me to describe the personal appearance\r\nand manners of the exile, which I did partly from the recollections\r\nof my childhood, partly from the description given to me by others,\r\nI could not but notice your countenance, and remark its change; in\r\nspite,\" said the Marchesa, smiling, and watching Randal while she\r\nspoke--\"in spite of your habitual self-command. And when I pressed\r\nyou to own that you had actually seen some one who tallied with that\r\ndescription, your denial did not deceive me. Still more, when returning\r\nrecently, of your own accord, to the subject, you questioned me so\r\nshrewdly as to my motives in seeking the clue to our refugees, and I\r\ndid not then answer you satisfactorily, I could detect--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha, ha,\" interrupted Randal, with the low soft laugh by which\r\noccasionally he infringed upon Lord Chesterfield's recommendations to\r\nshun a merriment so natural as to be ill-bred,--\"ha, ha, you have the\r\nfault of all observers too minute and refined. But even granting that\r\nI may have seen some Italian exiles, (which is likely enough,) what\r\ncould be more simple than my seeking to compare your description with\r\ntheir appearance; and granting that I might suspect some one amongst\r\nthem to be the man you search for, what more simple, also, than that\r\nI should desire to know if you meant him harm or good in discovering\r\nhis 'whereabout?' For ill,\" added Randal, with an air of prudery, \"ill\r\nwould it become me to betray, even to friendship, the retreat of one\r\nwho would hide from persecution; and even if I did so--for honor itself\r\nis a weak safeguard against your fascinations--such indiscretion might\r\nbe fatal to my future career.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you not say that Egerton knows the secret, yet will not\r\ncommunicate?--and is he a man who would ever forgive in me an\r\nimprudence that committed himself? My dear friend, I will tell you\r\nmore. When Audley Egerton first noticed my growing intimacy with you,\r\nhe said, with his usual dryness of counsel, 'Randal, I do not ask you\r\nto discontinue acquaintance with Madame di Negra--for an acquaintance\r\nwith women like her forms the manners and refines the intellect; but\r\ncharming women are dangerous, and Madame di Negra is--a charming woman.\"\r\n\r\nThe Marchesa's face flushed. Randal resumed: \"'Your fair acquaintance'\r\n(I am still quoting Egerton) 'seeks to discover the home of a\r\ncountryman of hers. She suspects that I know it. She may try to learn\r\nit through you. Accident may possibly give you the information she\r\nrequires. Beware how you betray it. By one such weakness I should judge\r\nof your general character. He from whom a woman can extract a secret\r\nwill never be fit for public life.' Therefore, my dear Marchesa, even\r\nsupposing that I possess this secret, you would be no true friend of\r\nmine to ask me to reveal what would imperil all my prospects. For as\r\nyet,\" added Randal, with a gloomy shade on his brow,--\"as yet I do not\r\nstand alone and erect--I _lean_;--I am dependent.\"\r\n\r\n\"There may be a way,\" replied Madame di Negra, persisting, \"to\r\ncommunicate this intelligence, without the possibility of Mr. Egerton's\r\ntracing our discovery to yourself; and, though I will not press you\r\nfurther, I add this--you urge me to accept your friend's hand; you seem\r\ninterested in the success of his suit, and you plead it with a warmth\r\nthat shows how much you regard what you suppose is his happiness;\r\nI will never accept his hand till I can do so without blush for my\r\npenury--till my dowry is secured, and that can only be by my brother's\r\nunion with the exile's daughter. For your friend's sake, therefore,\r\nthink well how you can aid me in the first step to that alliance. The\r\nyoung lady once discovered, and my brother has no fear for the success\r\nof his suit.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you would marry Frank if the dower was secured?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your arguments in his favor seem irresistible,\" replied Beatrice,\r\nlooking down.\r\n\r\nA flash went from Randal's eyes, and he mused a few moments.\r\n\r\nThen slowly rising, and drawing on his gloves, he said--\r\n\r\n\"Well, at least you so far reconcile my honor towards aiding your\r\nresearch, that you now inform me that you mean no ill to the exile.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ill!--the restoration to fortune, honors, his native land.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you so far enlist my heart on your side, that you inspire me with\r\nthe hope to contribute to the happiness of two friends whom I dearly\r\nlove. I will therefore diligently seek to ascertain if, among the\r\nrefugees I have met with, lurk those whom you seek; and if so I will\r\nthoughtfully consider how to give you the clue. Meanwhile, not one\r\nincautious word to Egerton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Trust me--I am a woman of the world.\"\r\n\r\nRandal now had gained the door. He paused, and renewed carelessly--\r\n\r\n\"This young lady must be heiress to great wealth, to induce a young man\r\nof your brother's rank to take so much pains to discover her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Her wealth _will_ be vast,\" replied the Marchesa; \"and if any thing\r\nfrom wealth or influence in a foreign state could be permitted to prove\r\nmy brother's gratitude--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, fie,\" interrupted Randal, and approaching Madame di Negra, he\r\nlifted her hand to his lips, and said gallantly.\r\n\r\n\"This is reward enough to your _preux chevalier_.\"\r\n\r\nWith those words he took his leave.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is always safe to call an assailer of morality licentious, though\r\nmany of its defenders be not virtuous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthors and Books.\r\n\r\n\r\nA pendant to Professor Creasy's _Decisive Battles_ has been issued at\r\nStuttgart, under the title of _Grundzüge einer Einleitung zum Studium\r\nder Kriegsgeschichte_ (Outlines of an Introduction to the History of\r\nWar). The author divides his work into two parts: the first extending\r\nfrom 550 B.C. to A.D. 1350; the second, from 1350 to 1850; and each of\r\nthese parts he arranges in three periods. In the first period (550 to\r\n250 B.C.), he finds that the controlling part in war must be attributed\r\nto distinguished and leading individualities; in the second (250 to\r\n50 B.C.), that the dominant element was the political and national,\r\nespecially the peculiar constitution and nationality of the Romans;\r\nthe third (50 B.C. to 1350 A.D.), is remarkable for the number and\r\nvariety of warlike events, and the gradual decline of the system used\r\nin prosecuting wars; in the fourth (A.D. 1350 to 1650), the art of\r\nwar was greatly advanced, especially in respect to technical science,\r\nfortifications, &c.; in the fifth (1650 to 1790), this progress\r\ncontinued, and tactics were greatly improved as well as strategy; the\r\nsixth period (1790 to 1850), is remarkable for the rapid development\r\nof every branch of warlike art and science, both theoretical and\r\npractical. These conclusions are arrived at after a spirited historical\r\nreview of the different periods. This introduction the author promises\r\nto follow up with a complete work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn interesting correspondence of the period of the thirty years' war\r\nhas been discovered by M. Welchoff, Councillor of State, in an old\r\ntravelling trunk in the archives of the Aulic chamber of Celle, in\r\nHanover, that did not appear to have been opened since the papers were\r\ndeposited. It comes down to the date of the battle of Breitenfeld, and\r\nincludes letters from Pappenheim, Gustavus Adolphus, and other leaders\r\nof the time, with the rough draughts of the letters of Duke George of\r\nBrunswick, Luneberg, to whom the whole collection probably belonged.\r\nA similar discovery was lately made by M. Dudik, commissioned by the\r\ngovernment of Austria to search the libraries of Sweden for material of\r\nthis kind, in Stockholm and Upsal. The history of the thirty years' war\r\nhas therefore to be rewritten.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Albion and Erin_, is the title of a little volume, containing the\r\nchoicest songs of Moore, Byron, Burns, Shelley, Campbell, and Thompson,\r\nwith selections from Percy's Reliques, each piece being accompanied by\r\na faithful and elegant translation into German, printed on the opposite\r\npage. For American students of German, or German students of English,\r\nnothing better could be desired. (Sold by Rudolph Garrigue, Astor\r\nHouse.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe thirteenth meeting of the Association of German Philologists,\r\nTeachers and Orientalists, was opened at Erlangen on the 1st of\r\nOctober, and continued four days, about one hundred and eighty\r\nmembers being present. Böckh of Berlin, Thiersch, Halm and Spengel of\r\nMunich, Gerlach of Basle, Grotefend of Hanover, Krüger of Brunswick,\r\nwere among the most distinguished _gelehrten_. There was even one\r\nmember from Russia in the person of Prof. Vater of Kasan. Austria\r\nand Electoral Hesse were not represented. Professor Döderlein was\r\npresident, and Professor Nagelsbach vice-president. The president\r\nopened the general session with a discourse upon the position and value\r\nof modern philology. In the meeting of October 2d, Wocher of Ehrinegn\r\nread an essay on phonology, or the essential significance of sounds;\r\nand Beyer of Erlangen, another on an antique statue in the Munich\r\ncollection which had been supposed to represent Leukothea, but which he\r\ndemonstrated to be Charitas. In the exercises of the third and fourth\r\nday were included an essay by Böckh on a Greek inscription, one by\r\nDöderlein on an ode of Horace, one by Nagelsbach on a passage of the\r\nIliad, and one by Gerlach on a subject from Roman antiquities. The\r\nwhole, however interesting to advanced scholars, had little to attract\r\nor satisfy the mass of intelligent persons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe third volume of G. WEIL'S _Geschichte der Chalifen_ (History of the\r\nCalifs), has appeared in Germany, where the second was published three\r\nyears since. This volume brings the history down into the period of\r\nthe crusades, and gives us the exact life of men of such proportions\r\nas Haroun Alrashid, and Saladin. In ordinary cases when history enters\r\nthe field where romance has achieved its most brilliant successes, it\r\nmust be written with the utmost power not to seem pale and lifeless by\r\ncontrast, but here the simplest narrative would have all the charm of\r\nfancy. For the rest Mr. Weil is fully equal to his subject; and throws\r\na flood of light upon its more recondite features. His work is an\r\ninvaluable addition to our means of knowing the history and natives of\r\nthe Orient.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Die Deutschen in Böhmen_ (The Germans in Bohemia), is pleasant reading\r\nfor those who like to study the manners and peculiarities of foreign\r\ncountries in some detail. It also has its value for the political\r\nstudent who would make himself acquainted with the intermixtures and\r\nrelations of the different races in Central Europe. It treats the\r\nsubject in its geographical, statistical, economical and historical\r\nbearings, as well as in respect to manners, customs, and modes of life.\r\n(Prague, 1851.)\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to the Messrs. Westermann, of this city, for the ninth\r\nand tenth parts of Dr. ANDREE'S admirable work, entitled, _Amerika_,\r\nof which we have before spoken at length. These parts conclude the\r\nfirst volume, of 810 octavo pages, printed with an elegance which,\r\namong us, is not generally attributed to German books. This volume\r\nis devoted to North America, and these two parts, are divided into\r\nchapters upon:--the New England States; the Middle States; the Southern\r\nAtlantic States; the South on the Gulf of Mexico; the Western Slave\r\nStates; the Non-slaveholding, West and North; the Far West, and the\r\nPacific Coast. Each state and territory is treated with extreme\r\nclearness and comprehensiveness, and with a correctness that seems\r\nastonishing, when we consider that the book was written in Germany.\r\nThis volume is dedicated to Dr. Hermann E. Ludewig, of this city, in\r\nthree or four pages, giving an account of the motives which induced\r\nDr. Andree to write the work; we translate the dedicatory paragraph:\r\n\"This book, honored sir, I dedicate to you. The literature of North\r\nAmerican history is greatly indebted to your valuable labors; for\r\nthese ten years no small part of your time has been devotedly spent\r\nin disinterestedly aiding, by advice and assistance, our emigrating\r\ncountrymen on their arrival in New-York. In your new country, which you\r\nunderstand so keenly and so profoundly, you are still a cultivator of\r\nGerman science, holding your old fatherland in appropriate honor. You\r\nare in America a worthy and most estimable representative of German\r\nculture and German integrity. Receive friendly this inscription, and\r\nthe cordial greetings I send you beyond the sea!\" We trust the other\r\nvolumes of this work may speedily appear: the second will be upon\r\nMexico and Central America, and the third upon South America.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSPINOZA'S _Tractatus Politicus_ is the subject of a work recently\r\npublished at Dessau, by J. E. HORN. The author defends Spinoza's\r\npolitical ideas as of a practical nature, and not at all connected with\r\nthe analogous theories of modern German metaphysicians. The work is the\r\nresult of much thought, and of all the industry which seems to belong\r\nto every scholar of Germany.\r\n\r\nAnother work on Spinoza, is by Professor ZIMMERMANN of Olmütz, and is\r\nentitled, _Uber einige logische Fehler der spinozistischen Ethik_. It\r\nattempts to prove at length that the syllogistic method of the great\r\nJew can only be correct on the supposition that in substance the idea\r\nand the reality are coincident, which supposition Spinoza himself\r\nexpressly affirms. The radical fault of this method, according to the\r\nProfessor, is the application of mathematical demonstration to things\r\nnot susceptible thereof. On the whole this publication adds little to\r\nthe treasures of philosophy.\r\n\r\nAnother, and a valuable contribution, to the almost infinite Goethean\r\nliterature, has appeared in Germany, in the second volume of J. W.\r\nSCHAFER'S life of the great poet. It begins with the year 1786, and\r\ncomes down to the death of the modern Shakespeare. Its materials are\r\ndrawn from the writings of Goethe himself, and from the published\r\nletters and memoirs upon separate portions of his life. The Italian\r\nJourney is the subject of a special disquisition. Goethe's political\r\nopinions are also discussed in connection with his behavior during\r\nthe war of independence. Finally, we have the man in his old age,\r\nwhen his leading feature of character is said to be universality of\r\nmental activity. The style of the book is clear and condensed, and its\r\nfairness and impartiality a subject of laudation.\r\n\r\nA third volume of GOETHE'S _Correspondence with Madame von Stein_\r\nhas been published in Germany. It is no less interesting than the\r\npreceding, whether as a collection of letters, or as a revelation\r\nof the character and private history of the greatest man in German\r\nliterature. The assertion that Goethe was really a man of cold and\r\nheartless nature, and that the warmth of feeling and freshness of\r\nsentiment displayed in his poems was merely fictitious, is entirely\r\nrefuted by this correspondence.\r\n\r\nA collection of poems, by WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, the son of the great\r\npoet, was published by Cotta, of Stuttgart, in October last. We\r\nhave not seen the book, but the publisher's advertisement is quite\r\napologetic, and indicates that the name of the father has not insured\r\nthe inheritance of his genius.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA new work entitled _Das Brittische Reich in Europe_ (The British\r\nEmpire in Europe), has just appeared at Leipzig, in which the progress\r\nand power of England are compared with those of the United States. The\r\nauthor, Herr MEIDINGER, is an admirer of the present policy of England,\r\nand exhibits at length the statistics of the advance made by the\r\ncountry under that policy. A statistical survey of the religious and\r\nmoral condition of Ireland, which forms a part of the work, has also\r\nbeen printed as a separate book.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStudents of middle-age antiquities may find a bone to gnaw in _Dat Spil\r\nfan der Upstandinge_ (The Play of the Resurrection), just published\r\nwith annotations by Herr ETTMULLER at Quedlinburg. This is said to\r\nbe greatly superior to the mass of the religious dramas of the time;\r\nit has a genuine unity and is not disfigured by the admixture of\r\nbuffoonery with the awful realities of New Testament history. It is in\r\nthe Low German dialect, and dates from the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA good history of French literature has been published in German by\r\nProfessor KREYSIG of Elbing. It is designed for a schoolbook, and\r\nevinces both learning and fairness.\r\n\r\nA valuable contribution to German history has been brought out at\r\nBerlin, by KURD VON SCHÖZER, under the title of _Die Hansa und der\r\nDeutsche Ritterorden in den Ostseeländen_ (The Hanseatic League and\r\nthe German Knighthood in the Baltic provinces). The author has not\r\nmerely exhausted the old chronicles of his subject in the archives and\r\nlibraries of Germany, but has wrought up his materials into a living\r\nnarrative, full of romantic interest as well as historical instruction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA Catholic writer, Count EICHENDORFF, has published, at Leipzig, _Der\r\nDeutsche Roman des 18ten Jahrhunderts_ (German Romance in the 18th\r\ncentury), in which the subject of romance literature is treated in its\r\nrelation to Christianity, but not in a thorough or profound manner,\r\nand with too much dogmatism, and apparent prejudice. His idea is, that\r\nthere is no Christianity outside of the Catholic Church, and that all\r\nnovels which are not Catholic are unchristian.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMADAME BLAZE DE BURY has just published at Bremen, in Germany, a\r\nnovel, entitled, _Falkenburg_, which was issued at the same time in\r\nEnglish by Colburn, in London. The German copy is the work of the\r\nauthoress herself. She resides, at Paris, as the wife of the well-known\r\n_littérateur_, Henri Blaze. This novel is certainly a cosmopolitan\r\nproduction--written as it is, in German, by an Englishwoman, married to\r\na Frenchman, and residing at Paris.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe history of religious organizations is enriched by Professor\r\nRICHTER'S _Geschichte der Evangelischen Kirchenverfassung in\r\nDeutschland_ (History of the Constitution of the Evangelical Church in\r\nGermany), which has just appeared at Leipzig. The work is highly, and,\r\nwe doubt not, very justly commended.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn elaborate _Life of Sir Robert Peel_, with a collection of his\r\nspeeches, has been published in German, by Herr KUNZEL. It is a warm\r\ntribute of admiration for the English statesman, and for that process\r\nof very gradual reform by which England is distinguished. (Brunswick, 2\r\nvols.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. ZIMMERMANN, whose excellent history of the Peasants' War deserves\r\nto be better known to English readers, has just published, at\r\nDarmstadt, a history of the English Revolution, which he dedicates to\r\nall parties of the German people, and which we doubt not all parties\r\nmay profitably study.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA history of Norway has been published at Leipzig, in a neat little\r\nvolume. It brings the narrative of that country down to the present\r\ntime, dividing it into seven periods, and giving a succinct account of\r\neach. The history of Andreas Faye serves as the basis of this work.\r\n\r\nWe gave in these pages, a few months since, an account of the labors\r\nand sufferings of the Hungarian traveller and ethnographer REGULY, who\r\nspent ten painful years among the Finnish tribes of Northern Europe and\r\nAsia, with a view to ascertain the ancient of the Magyars. Reguly is\r\nnow hard at work at Pesth arranging for publication the immense mass\r\nof materials gathered on this long expedition, and meanwhile another\r\nsavan, John Jerney, has just published in two heavy quartos the result\r\nof a journey he made for the same purpose during 1844 and '45, in\r\nSouthern Russia. His work is interesting rather from its information\r\non collateral subjects than because he has cleared up the main problem\r\nwhich his explorations had in view. His conclusion is that the Magyars\r\nare of Parthian origin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the present attention to recent Magyar history, a useful aid may be\r\nfound in _Ungarn's Politische Charaktere_ (The Political Notabilities\r\nof Hungary), just published at Mayence. It contains the biography of\r\nforty-eight different persons. Its author is a warm admirer of Kossuth\r\nand his policy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA collection of the speeches, proclamations, &c., of that sentimental\r\ntyrant, Frederick William IV. of Prussia, has just been published at\r\nBerlin. It includes all the productions of his Majesty from March 6,\r\n1848, to May 31, 1851, and will be useful to trunk-makers and future\r\nhistorians.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the present interest attaching to Arctic voyages, SCHUNDT'S _Bilder\r\naus dem Norden_ (Pictures from the North), collected in a journey\r\ntoward the North Pole, in the year 1850, is worth looking into. (Jena,\r\n1851.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProf. J. E. KOPP has published, at Vienna, a volume of documents on the\r\nhistory of the Swiss Confederation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe success in Europe of General BEM'S plan of teaching history and\r\nan exact chronology, attracted the attention of intelligent friends\r\nof education in Massachusetts, at whose suggestion Miss E. P. PEABODY\r\nhas prepared a system of the same sort for American schools. The plan\r\nwas not one superseding the necessity of study, but guiding it, and\r\nrendering it effective. It requires a very careful attention, which\r\nmay be slighted either by scholar or teacher. It saves time, indeed,\r\nby rewarding labor, and by making the everlasting review of the ground\r\nunnecessary, fostering by means of the senses what is attained. Miss\r\nPeabody, in the appendix to the tables of chronology which form\r\nthe manual of this system, has aimed to give some general hints to\r\nteachers, opening out before them a more generous method of studying\r\nhistory than has been usual in our schools and colleges.\r\n\r\nThe French democrats and socialists bring out this year the usual\r\nvariety of Almanacs for the propagation of their doctrines among\r\nthe people. The _Almanach du Travail_ contains articles by Agricole\r\nPerdiguier, cabinet-maker and representative in the National Assembly;\r\nM. Perdiguier is understood to be the original hero of George Sand's\r\n_Compagnons du Tour de France_; several other well-known literary and\r\npolitical characters also contribute; the publication of the work\r\nis the enterprise of an association of printers and engravers. The\r\n_Almanach du Village_ is published by the _Propagande Démocratique\r\nEuropéene_; its editor is M. Joigneaux, a representative, and Pierre\r\nDupont, the democratic poet, is among the contributors. The _Almanach\r\nPopulaire de la France_ is a more elaborate publication, and boasts\r\na larger circle of writers; Pascal Duprat, Alphonse Esquiros, André\r\nCochut, Fr. Arago, and Victor Schoelcher, are among them. The _Almanach\r\ndes Opprimés_, by Hippolyte Magen, is a Voltairian production, devoted\r\nto ridiculing the Catholic clergy and the saints of the calender in a\r\nstyle of utter irreverence for their sacred character, and even for\r\ntheir integrity and respectability as individuals. The _Répubilique du\r\nPeuple_ is simply a democratic almanac, but its ability is remarkable.\r\nArago, the astronomer Carnot, who possibly will be the candidate of the\r\ndemocratic party for President, Colonel Charras, Michel (de Bourges),\r\nAlphonse Karr, and others of the old moderate republican party are\r\ncontributors. It is adorned with neat engravings; among them is a\r\nportrait of Dupont, the poet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA well-known publicist, M. CROCE-SPINELLI, has just issued at Paris an\r\nessay on popular government, under the title of _L'Arche Populaire_. It\r\ntreats principally of the French constitution, whose faults are said\r\nto be--1st, that it confides too much in aristocracy and too little in\r\ndemocracy; 2d, that the legislature may render itself independent of\r\nthe people by whom it is elected, and betray their interests: 3d, that\r\nthe authority of the President is too great, and is even dangerous to\r\nthe development of democratic ideas and forces. The author concludes\r\nhis work with the plan of a constitution which he thinks will be free\r\nfrom these defects.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe ASIATIC SOCIETY of Paris announces the publication of a collection\r\nof Oriental works, with French translations, without commentaries, but\r\nwith very copious indexes. The majority will be Arabic, and, with few\r\nexceptions, hitherto unknown to Occidental students generally. The\r\nprices will be made very low, it is hoped not higher than those of\r\nordinary French books. This will be accomplished by introducing them\r\nas text-books into the schools in Algiers, Egypt, and Constantinople,\r\nwhere French is taught, and thus securing a large sale.\r\n\r\nA publication worthy of the utmost praise is the _Revue de\r\nl'Architecture et des Travaux Publiques_, published at Paris, under\r\nthe editorial care of M. CESAR DALY, one of the most learned and\r\naccomplished architects in Europe. This review, which is now in its\r\nninth year, is issued monthly, with the utmost elegance both of\r\ntypography and engravings. The number for October contains articles\r\non the following subjects:--the preservation and restoration of the\r\nCathedrals of France, the Church of St. Paul at Nismes, Stereochromy,\r\nthe Museum at St. Petersburg, Chinese Monuments discovered in Ireland,\r\nthe Public Garden and Swimming School at Bordeaux, &c., &c.; it has\r\nfour large engravings. The work treats every branch, historic and\r\npractical, of architecture and engineering, and should be in the hands\r\nof every architect and engineer, and in the library of every man of\r\ntaste whose leisure and meditations lead him to the study of the\r\nbeautiful and useful arts. It may be procured in Paris at the low rate\r\nof 40 francs a-year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA book well suited to the times is Dr. FIGUIER'S _Exposition et\r\nHistoire des principales Découvertes Modernes_, which has just appeared\r\nat Paris in two small volumes. It treats of photography, the serial\r\nand magnetic telegraphs, etherization, galvanoplasty and chemical\r\ngilding, aërostatics, lighting by gas, Leverrier's planet, gunpowder,\r\nand gun-cotton. With respect to the glory of discovering photography,\r\nDr. Figuier restores it to M. Niepce, of Chalon-sur-Saone, proving that\r\nhe originated the conception, and that Daguerre did nothing more than\r\nperfect the process. Singularly enough, M. Figuier omits the steamboat\r\nand railroad from the discoveries whose history he so carefully and\r\nconscientiously records, but even with these omissions his work is\r\nvaluable and interesting both to the savan and the ordinary reader.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe editors of the _Revue des Deux Mondes_, at Paris, have made up a\r\nvery useful manual of the history of the year 1850, under the title of\r\n_Annuaire des Deux Mondes_, which is sold by Balliére, in Broadway.\r\nIt contains an account of the political events, the international\r\nrelations and diplomacy, the administration, commerce, and finances,\r\nand the periodical press and literature of every country which\r\npossesses those products of civilization. The constitutions and affairs\r\nof Italy, Denmark, Germany, France, Belgium, Switzerland, Spain,\r\nPortugal, England, Norway, Sweden, Russia, Turkey, Greece, United\r\nStates, Mexico, the South American Republics, and even of the African\r\nand Asiatic races, are discussed with moderation and an effort for\r\nimpartiality, which is laudable, if not always successful. The most\r\nrecent statistics are given with reference to every country; and, as a\r\nbook of reference, it will be found very useful.\r\n\r\nThe _Calvin Translation Society_, which for the last ten years has been\r\nissuing, at irregular intervals, a complete and very handsome edition\r\nof CALVIN'S works, in English--to make about fifty octavo volumes--will\r\nhave to add to them a new collection of his _Letters_. It appears that\r\nthe government of Louis Philippe committed the preparation of the\r\nUnpublished Letters of the great Reformer to Professor BONNETT, who\r\nhad been dismissed from the College of Nismes for speaking too highly\r\nof Luther. He travelled in France and Switzerland, at the expense of\r\nthe Government, in order to collect the letters. After the revolution,\r\nthe influence of the Catholic clergy was such that the new minister\r\nof Public Instruction found a thousand difficulties in the way of\r\naccepting the labor of M. Bonnett, and the subject was finally referred\r\nto a committee, who reported in favor of the publication; yet, to\r\nsplit the difference with the clergy, they, on pretence of a saving\r\nof expenses, ordered that some of the less important letters should\r\nbe omitted, and that the Latin and French letters should be published\r\ntogether in the same volume. The number of Calvin's unpublished letters\r\nin the collection is 497; of these 190 are in French, and 307 in Latin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe aged LACRETELLE, who of late years has lived in retirement near\r\nMacon, reposing upon his fame as an historian, appeared recently at the\r\nAcademy in that city, on the day when the prizes of the Agricultural\r\nSociety were distributed, and delivered an oration, marked by the\r\nenergy and force of youth, but not by its hopefulness. He is now\r\neighty-five years old; and on this occasion, was particularly severe\r\nagainst the communists and socialists, who, he thought, were bent on\r\ndestroying every thing good, and upsetting the world. This was uttered\r\nwith a point and bitterness that did no discredit to the censor of the\r\npress under both the Empire and the Restoration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. ROMAIN CORUNT has commenced, in _La Presse_, a series of Critical\r\nStudies on Socialism, which M. Girardin introduces with a special\r\neditorial, and which promises to be valuable. It was not originally\r\ndesigned for publication, but to satisfy its author's curiosity as to\r\nthe ideas and aims of the revolution of 1848. He has accordingly gone\r\nanalytically through the writings of all the socialist schools. He\r\ncommences his exposition with Auguste Comte.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA FRENCH publisher advertises the memoirs of the celebrated actress\r\nMademoiselle MARS, who died at a great age some half dozen years ago.\r\nLike those of Pompadour, Crequi, Dubarri, Fouche, Robespierre, and many\r\nothers, they will undoubtedly turn out to be a fabrication by some\r\ningenious literary trickster, yet it is probable that they will be\r\namusing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe five academies of the Institute of France held their annual meeting\r\non the 25th of October. M. de Tocqueville presiding. In opening the\r\nmeeting, the chairman delivered a discourse, which is praised as\r\npossessing \"a great conciseness and an exquisite sense.\" Its topic was\r\nthe aim of this annual reunion of the five divisions of the Institute.\r\nThe Volney prize, which had been competed for by ten different works,\r\nwas awarded to Dr. STEINTHAL, for a manuscript treatise, written\r\nin German, called _A Comparative Exposition of a Family of Negro\r\nLanguages, in its Phonetic and Psychological Aspects_. This family of\r\nlanguages is that spoken by the Yoloffs and Bambaras. This prize is\r\nsimply 1200 francs; it was established by the famous Volney, with a\r\nview to aid in the formation of a universal language. An equal prize\r\nwas also awarded by the Institute to Dr. M. S. MUNK, for his work on\r\n_Sundry Hebrew Grammarians of the Tenth Century_; and an honorable\r\nmention to Dr. LORENZ DIEFFENBACH, for his _Comparative Dictionary of\r\nthe Gothic Language_. These three gentlemen are Germans, and it is not\r\nsurprising that they should thus carry off the honors where the field\r\nof competition is philology. After the prizes had been announced, a\r\nmemoir on the Physical Constitution of the Sun and the Stars, by M.\r\nArago, of the Academy of Sciences, was read; then a biographical notice\r\nof Denon, by M. de Pastoret, of the Academy of Fine Arts. M. Wallon\r\nnext read a fragment on the right of asylum awarded to runaway slaves\r\nin antiquity, and attempted to prove that a similar disposition to help\r\nsuch fugitives exists in the United States at the present day. Finally,\r\na poem, sent by M. Ampere, was read, and received with a great deal of\r\napplause.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn interesting work on the war in the Vendée, in 1793, is now published\r\nat Paris, by M. FRANÇOIS GRILLE, himself a native of the region, and\r\nan eye-witness of some of the most terrible scenes of that sanguinary\r\nstruggle. He is a republican, and naturally takes a somewhat different\r\nview from that of Madame de la Rochejaquelin's Memoirs. Indeed, he\r\ncorrects explicitly several geographical and historical errors into\r\nwhich she has fallen. He writes with vivacity and clearness, and has\r\nmade a conscientious study of a great variety of materials hitherto\r\nunused. The first volume of the book has alone appeared: the others\r\nwill follow with all possible expedition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. FRANCIS LACOMBE is the author of a newly-published _Histoire de la\r\nBourgeoisie de Paris_, from its origin to the present day. The subject\r\nis one of great interest, and M. Lacombe has well employed the most\r\nextensive materials in treating it. His work extends to three pretty\r\nlarge octavo volumes. (Paris, 1851.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the autumn of 1849, the French government formed from among the\r\nmembers of the Institute, a commission whose duty was to select from\r\nthe reports and communications made to the government by scientific\r\ntravellers, what should appear of value to the world at large, for\r\npublication at the public expense, in monthly parts, under the title\r\nof _Archives des Missions Scientifiques et Littéraires_. The work was\r\nat once commenced and the volume for 1850 is completed; of the volume\r\nfor 1851, not more than three or four parts have yet appeared. In this\r\nvolume are reports by Emil Burnouf on the Propylae, the Pnyx and the\r\nCopaic Lake; by M. Bendit of a Journey among the Grecian Islands; by\r\nLottin de Leval of an expedition to the Peninsula of Sinai to take\r\nimpressions of the inscriptions in the valleys of Sinai and Serval; by\r\nM.H. Revier of an excursion in Algeria to collect Roman inscriptions;\r\nM. Battier de Bourville has an interesting account of the result of an\r\nexpedition from Benghazi on the coast of Tripoli, to Cyrene, where he\r\nmade some excavations and dug up several fine statues and remarkable\r\ninscriptions; M. Ducouret repeats at length the story of tailed men\r\nin the interior of Africa, but his veracity is uncommonly doubtful,\r\nand his previous travels in countries more familiar have been utterly\r\nfruitless; Mariette's report of his journey to Egypt, in which he\r\ndiscovered the Serapeum of Memphis, is particularly interesting. He is\r\na man of uncommon energy and persistence, and almost lost his life in\r\nthe affair. He was sick four weeks with fevers and ophthalmia, in the\r\ndesert, where the Egyptian officials refused him water and provisions,\r\nso that the wonder is he did not die. The Assembly has voted 30,000\r\nfrancs to dig out the Serapeum, which was covered with sand in Pliny's\r\ntime, and will now be found exactly in its antique condition. Mariette\r\nis now there, and at the last advices had excavated five hundred\r\ndifferent objects in bronze besides twelve sphinxes in granite. Very\r\nmany travellers have been sent out to collect documents bearing upon\r\nthe history of France, and a full account of their labors is contained\r\nin this volume. M. de Maslatire has been twice to Cyprus to obtain\r\nmaterials for the history of French rule in that island, and the\r\nresult will presently appear in two quarto volumes at the cost of the\r\ntreasury. Several travellers have been sent to England for documents\r\non French history, where it seems they are almost inexhaustibly\r\nabundant, especially those that relate to the middle ages. The reports\r\nof M. Descloiseaux, who was sent to Iceland to study its geological\r\nformation; of M. Visquenel who went to Asiatic Turkey to examine the\r\nsoil and products; of MM. Milne, Edwards and Quatrefages, who went to\r\nSicily to examine the molluscs and annelids of the neighboring seas;\r\nand of Dr. Grange, who was sent throughout Europe to study cretinism\r\nand goitre, are very valuable scientifically. Dr. Grange finds the\r\ncause of those diseases in water containing magnesia, but no iodine.\r\n\r\nThese travels are undertaken by means of a fund provided for that\r\npurpose by the government. The plan of each expedition is first\r\nsubmitted to the Institute and approved. In case of very expensive\r\nundertakings, like the excavation of the Serapeum, or the expedition\r\nlately sent to Babylon, a special appropriation is obtained from the\r\nAssembly. The _Archives_ are published neatly, with the necessary\r\nengravings, at twelve francs a year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe mystery hanging over the interior of Africa is rapidly dissipating\r\nbefore the zeal of the many explorers whose efforts are now devoted to\r\ntraversing the centre of that continent, and, before many years have\r\npassed, there is reason to suppose, this sole remaining geographical\r\nand ethnographic problem will be fully solved. The English expeditions\r\nfrom the Cape of Good Hope, the German missionaries on the eastern\r\ncoast, with their journeys into the highlands in the south of\r\nAbyssinia, the explorations of the English on the gold coast and up\r\nthe Niger, those of the French starting from Senegal and Algiers, the\r\ntravels of Knoblecher and others on the upper Nile, with the journeys\r\nof Richardson, Barth, and Overweg, must soon make us acquainted with\r\nthe principal facts that have so long been the object of general\r\ncuriosity, if not of exaggerated expectation. Something is also to be\r\nanticipated from the aid of Mohammedan travellers, of whom there are a\r\ngreat number scattered over the interior of the continent in search of\r\nadventures or with a view to make fortunes. One of these has published,\r\nin Arabic, two works containing his experiences and observations in\r\nDarfur and Waday, both of which have been translated into French by\r\nM. Perron. The second has just appeared at Paris under the title of\r\n_Voyage au Ouaday par Cheykh Mohammed Ibn Omar al Tunisi_, and is\r\nespecially valuable, as Waday is a country about which we have before\r\nhad little, if any, positive information. It lies south of the great\r\ndesert between Timbuctoo and Darfur, and is an extensive country. It\r\nis so far advanced out of the merely savage state, as to have a sort\r\nof administration, an army, and a kind of general regulations for\r\ncommerce, which it owes to the influence of Islamism, and to a great\r\nman called Sabun, who lived quite recently, or yet lives, as the chief\r\nruler of the land. The principal trade is in slaves, who are stolen\r\nin forays among the neighboring tribes on the south, and sold to\r\ncaravans going north to Fezzan, or east to Darfur; the other articles\r\nof commerce are ivory, skins, and ostrich feathers. The introduction of\r\nIslamism has put an end to human sacrifices, and rendered the tyranny\r\nof the rulers less bloody, but in other respects it has produced little\r\nsocial improvement.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic writers are generally, in Continental Europe,\r\ndemanding the suppression of the liberty of discussion, and a\r\nre-establishment of the Inquisition. Mr. BLANC ST. BONNET, one of the\r\nmost conspicuous writers of his party, demands that every species of\r\nfree thought be discountenanced, and M. BARBEY D'AUREVILLY, in _Les\r\nProphètes du Passé_, declares that the evil corrupting society is the\r\npest Liberty; that the church made a fatal error in not burning Luther\r\nin lieu of burning his books; and he concludes that the Inquisition is\r\na \"logical necessity\" in every well-constituted state.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Journal des Débats_ publishes a long review from the pen of\r\nM. GARDIN DE TASSY, of the _Translation of two unpublished Arabic\r\nDocuments_, issued last year by our countryman EDWARD E. SALISBURY,\r\nof Boston. M. de Tassy says: \"We must not suppose that in the United\r\nStates every body is so absorbed in commerce that nothing else can\r\npossibly be attended to. Science and letters are cultivated with\r\nsuccess, and there are learned men there who rival those of Europe.\"\r\nThe _Translation_ and its author are warmly praised.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. DE SAULCY is about to publish at Paris his travels in Palestine,\r\nwith thirty large engravings of the ancient monuments about Jerusalem,\r\nand thirty of those about the Dead Sea. The so-called Graves of the\r\nKings will be the subject of thorough discussion. It is also said that\r\none of them will be reconstructed in the Louvre upon his plan, and a\r\nsarcophagus cover, which he brought with him, used for the purpose. He\r\nhas also a Moabitic bas-relief in black basalt: he bought it of the\r\nArabs on the Dead Sea. If it be indeed what he supposes, it is the only\r\nrelic of the sort existing in Europe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nABBADIE, one of the Ethiopian travellers of that name, who has lately\r\nbeen so much assailed by other savants as a narrator of his adventures,\r\nis superintending the cutting of a complete font of Ethiopic letters,\r\nat Paris, to be used in printing some two hundred and fifty Ethiopian\r\nmanuscripts. They will form four printed volumes, and are said to be\r\namong the most beautiful specimens of chirography ever seen. The other\r\nbrother has gone back to Abyssinia again, to resume his geographical\r\nand scientific researches.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are a great number of French missionaries in Asia and Africa, but\r\ntheir contributions to literature are trifling, compared with those\r\nof the English, American, and German. Bishop PALLEGOIX, in Siam, has\r\nlately published a Siamese grammar, in Latin, and promises a Lexicon\r\nof the same language. This, and the Cochin-Chinese Lexicon of Bishop\r\nTabert, are the only works of the kind, by French missionaries, which\r\nwe can recall for several years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Westminster Review_, as we have before intimated, has passed into\r\nthe hands of the infidel party of England, and it becomes necessary to\r\nwarn the public who subscribe for it in the series of republications\r\nby Mr Scott, of its character, and to urge Mr. Scott to select some\r\nother periodical in its place, if it is necessary for the completion\r\nof his contracts to reprint a certain number of such works. There are\r\na considerable number of charlatans in England and in this country\r\nwho, without the natural capacities or the learning necessary to\r\ndistinction in any legitimate intellectual pursuits, clothe themselves\r\nin the cast-off and forgotten draperies of French scepticism, and\r\nchallenge admiration for the bravery displayed in mocking God, and\r\nridiculing the most profoundly reasoned and firmly settled convictions\r\nof mankind. It is becoming fashionable among our young and imperfectly\r\neducated magazine and newspaper writers to \"pity the weakness\" which\r\nreceives the Christian religion as it was held by our fathers. The\r\ndrivel of which the veriest fools were made ashamed half a century ago,\r\nis revived as if it were a new and immortal flowering of philosophy.\r\nBy the wise and thoughtful this sort of stuff is regarded with just\r\ncontempt, and with confidence that though it may exist for a while as\r\nscum upon the surface, it will before long sink with kindred filth\r\nto the bottom of the stream. The _Westminster Review_, failing of an\r\nadequate support, was about to be discontinued, when John Chapman,\r\nthe infidel publisher, bought it, and John Stuart Mill was engaged\r\nto be its editor. We hope the respectable portion of the American\r\njournals will make haste to disclose its present character; that\r\nChristian parents will no longer receive it into their houses; and that\r\nthe characteristic dishonesty of attempting to smuggle writings of\r\nphilosophical quacks and mountebanks under a once reputable name, will\r\nhave its appropriate reward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf ROBERT BURNS, a grandson of the great poet, who has recently\r\nhad some difficulties with the Rajah Sir James Brooke, the London\r\n_Examiner_ says, that he is an adventurous traveller; that he has\r\nmastered two of the languages of Borneo; that he has penetrated farther\r\ninto that great and little-known island than any other European; that\r\nhe has written by far the best and most authentic account of it in the\r\n_Journal of the Archipelago_, that has ever been given to the public.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe several volumes of essays, entitled, _Companions of my Solitude,\r\nFriends in Council, Essays Written during the Intervals of Business_,\r\n&c., are now announced to be by a Mr. HELPS. Most of them have been\r\nrepublished in this country, and much read here. They are agreeable and\r\nsensible, but without any very original or striking qualities to give\r\nthem a permanent place in literature.\r\n\r\nAmong the English announcements made in the last month are, _Personal\r\nRecollections of Mary Russell Mitford_ and _Anecdotes of Her Literary\r\nAcquaintances; Memoirs of the Marquis of Rockingham_, from original\r\nletters and documents, by the Earl of ALBEMARLE; several new books on\r\nthe war in Affghanistan; _The Convent and the Harem_, by the Countess\r\nPISANI; _Pictures of Life in Mexico_, by R.

DAVIS; _Sketches of English Literature_, by Mrs. C. L. BALFOUR;\r\n_Symbols and Emblems of Early and Midiæval Christian Art_, by LOUISA\r\nTWINING; a new work by Dr. LAYARD, entitled _Fresh Discoveries at\r\nNineveh, and Researches at Babylon_; a new work by Sir FRANCIS HEAD,\r\nwith the facetious title, _All my Eye; Some Account of the Danes and\r\nNorthmen, in England, Scotland, and Ireland_, by J.

WORSAAE, of\r\nCopenhagen; _An Illustrated Classical Mythology and Biography_, by Dr.\r\nWILLIAM SMITH; _Buenos Ayres and the Provinces of the Rio de la Plata_,\r\nby Sir WOODBINE PARISH; and two new volumes of GROTE'S _History of\r\nGreece_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe English Dissenters have recently established a new college. It\r\nis the result of a union of three existing similar institutions, at\r\npresent belonging to the Independents--namely, Coward, Homerton, and\r\nCheshunt Colleges; and it is anticipated, from such a concentration of\r\nNonconformist resources and energies, that the standard of learning\r\namong them will be raised still higher than it is at present, though it\r\nis not now below that in the established church, which, controlling the\r\ngreat universities, is pleased not to admit that a man may understand\r\nGreek or Mathematics unless he subscribes to the thirty-nine articles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSIR CHARLES LYELL, lately, in an _Address to the Geological Society_,\r\ndemolished again the paltry affair which for some time has constituted\r\nthe main artillery of the atheists, _The Vestiges of Creation_; and\r\n_The Leader_ thereupon declares that, \"In proportion as any branch of\r\ninquiry rises out of mere _details_ into the _higher generalizations_\r\nwhich alone constitute science, we find our scientific men, with rare\r\nexceptions, _pitiably incompetent_.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"CHRISTOPHER NORTH\" (Professor Wilson), has been compelled by ill\r\nhealth to make arrangements for dispensing with the delivery of his\r\nlectures on moral philosophy in the University of Edinburgh, at the\r\nensuing session. The great poet, philosopher, critic, sportsman, and\r\nhumorist, is in the sixty-third year of his age.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Evening Book_, by Mrs. KIRKLAND (Charles Scribner), is a very\r\ntasteful volume, consisting of some of the cleverest compositions of\r\none of our very cleverest literary women, well known as Mrs. Mary\r\nClavers, the prose poetess, and pen-painter of Western life. From\r\nour first acquaintance with Mary Clavers, in the world of print, we\r\nhave admired, almost equally, her frank independence of word and\r\nthought, her free and fearless love of truth, her facility in vivid and\r\nlife-like portraiture, and her natural strain of good-natured humor.\r\nBut most of all we have admired her, for that she is \"an 'author,' _yet\r\na woman too_!\" a consummation indeed devoutly to be wished; inasmuch as\r\nit seems to us, that we are fast falling upon days which will induce\r\nthe grave spectator, looking upon the ladies and gentlemen of _Young\r\nNew-York_, the former in the rostrum, the latter in the ball-room, to\r\nexclaim with the Persian King at Salamis, \"All our men have become\r\nwomen, and our women _men_.\" This, however, can never be predicated of\r\nour friend of \"the New Home;\" and yet, shall we confess it, we like\r\nher better far in the broad west than on the Broad _pavé_; better in\r\nthe solitude of the great woods than on the society of great cities;\r\nbetter in the log school-house, than in the tumultuous streets--in a\r\nword, better as the chronicler of the doings of the west, than as the\r\ncritic of the goings-on in the east! So long as she adheres to the\r\nformer, she is ever entertaining, ever instructive, ever humorous,\r\never lively, ever true; but when she comes to deal with the problems\r\nof society, when she dives into the mysteries of _caste_, and tempts\r\nthe difficulties which lie in the way of those who would reconcile\r\npolitical equality with social intercourse, we fear that she will not\r\nonly be found herself going astray, but--what is far worse--becoming\r\na blind guide to others. We are led to these remarks especially by a\r\ncertain article on \"Streets and Servants, at home and abroad,\" the\r\ntendency of which we fully believe--though we are sure it was honestly\r\nwritten, and beneficently intended--to be positively dangerous and\r\ninjurious to the very class for whose advantage it is intended.\r\n\r\nHerein we find our fair friend discoursing thus of the female servants\r\nof America:\r\n\r\n    \"Perhaps, if we could make up our minds to treat our servants\r\n    as fellow-citizens now, the time when they would be disposed to\r\n    shake off our service might be deferred.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again--\r\n\r\n    \"Would it be dangerous to recognize the soul of a chambermaid?\r\n    Would it not be apt to make her a better one, and longer\r\n    content with the broom and duster, if we consulted her\r\n    feelings, expressed an interest in her welfare, and saved\r\n    her pride as much as possible? At present, it seems to be\r\n    supposed that in the agreement as to wages, a certain amount of\r\n    contumely is bargained for,\" &c., &c.\r\n\r\nNow this is quite unworthy of Mrs. Kirkland's good sense; it is very\r\nobjectionable and injurious at this moment--when tens of thousands of\r\nAmerican girls are daily all but starving on the wretched pittance\r\nwhich they can earn at the literally starving prices of the shops;\r\ndaily falling into vice and infamy in order to avoid actual starvation;\r\nwho might be comfortably lodged, comfortably clad, comfortably fed,\r\nand well paid, in as many kindly and Christian families, if they\r\ncould but condescend from their ruinous false pride, and brook to\r\nbecome servants. Worst of all, it is not _true_. In no country on\r\nearth are servants so well looked to, not only as to wants but as to\r\ncomforts, as in this. In no other are their labors so light, their\r\nliberties so large, their remuneration so liberal, their feelings\r\nso freely consulted--nay, in many cases, their whims so foolishly\r\nindulged. To no contumely, that we can perceive, are they subjected;\r\nbut we suppose that Mrs. Kirkland regards their non-admission to\r\nour tables, our conversational _reunions_, or our ballrooms, as the\r\ncrowning contumely--quite forgetful that the restraint of what to\r\nrefined, educated, and highly-bred persons are habits, would be to\r\nthe servant-girl bonds and fetters of intolerable restraint--that her\r\ninability to mix in our conversation, to see with our eyes, taste with\r\nour tastes, and understand with our cultivated intellects, would render\r\nour society far more insufferable and annoying to her than her presence\r\ncould be to us; in a word, that, but for the false pride of being\r\n_one of the company_, our drawing-room would be far more a place of\r\npunishment to her, than her kitchen to us.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, in these United States, all this talk about independence\r\nand servitude is absurd. No man on earth is, or ever will be,\r\nindependent of some other man. Every man is, in some sort or other, the\r\nservant of some other man. The rich man is dependent on his colored\r\nbarber, or his colored _boots_, for his comfort, as the barber or the\r\nboots is on him for his wages; and perhaps the rich man would be worse\r\nput to it by the absence of the boots, than the boots by the absence of\r\nthe rich man. Generally, we believe, the higher we are in position, the\r\nmore masters we have to serve, and the less considerate; and we have\r\nlittle doubt that even our brilliant and gentle authoress herself has\r\nmore and less amiable behests to obey, than ever fell to the lot of the\r\nindependent help, who \"_thought she heard her yell_.\"\r\n\r\nWe have dwelt longer on this point than its weight or merit, as regards\r\nthe volume, of which it occupies but a page, would seem to justify; and\r\nwe have done so not ill-naturedly, to pick out the one tare from the\r\nload of wheat, but merely to controvert what we consider a dangerous\r\nsocial fallacy, which is growing and gaining virulence and vigor under\r\nfalse treatment, and producing serious detriment to a large class\r\nof our population. The volume itself is, as we have observed, an\r\nentertaining, an instructive, emphatically a good one; and its getting\r\nup and embellishment reflect as much credit on the publishers, as its\r\ncontents on the author. It is one of the most beautiful, and deserves\r\nto be one of the most popular, gift-books of the season.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the most agreeable republications of the season we may cite\r\nMrs. LEE'S _Luther and his Times_, the _Life and Times of Cranmer_,\r\nand the _Historical Sketches of the Old Painters_, recently issued in\r\nthe Family Library of Willis Hazard, of Philadelphia. _Luther and his\r\nTimes_ appears at an appropriate period, considering the great number\r\nof works relating to the Reformer which have been written in England\r\nand on the continent: scarce any of which, however, are superior\r\nto this, either in accuracy or general interest. As an appropriate\r\ncompanion to it we have Cranmer--a plain, straightforward, and withal\r\nextremely attractive account of the Reformation in England. With\r\nregard to the relative excellence of these, we incline to the Luther.\r\nThe simplicity and singleness of style which characterize Mrs. Lee's\r\nbiography of Cranmer, would render it peculiarly the property of\r\nthe young, were it not that the great amount of valuable historical\r\ninformation which it contains, as well as the fact that so little\r\nis generally known relative to the early history of the English\r\nReformation, commend it equally to the perusal of older and graver\r\nstudents. But in the Luther, we have, in the best sense, a _literary_\r\nwork, one in which ease of style, an almost romantic interest and\r\naccurate research, combine to invest it with that variety of excellence\r\nwhich the public taste at the present day requires of the historian\r\nand biographer. The works are neatly got up, with fair illustrations.\r\nIn the same series we also find an illustrated edition of _The Vicar\r\nof Wakefield_. A curious proof of the exquisite simplicity and beauty\r\nof style which characterize this work, may be found in the fact, that\r\nthroughout Germany, Scandinavia, and Italy, no English work is so well\r\nknown or so extensively used in the study of our language.\r\n\r\nFew American works have conferred on their writers a more respectable\r\nreputation than Mrs. LEE'S _Historical Sketches of the Old Painters_.\r\nWhen we reflect on the important _rôle_ which a knowledge of Art plays\r\nin a modern education, and that the time is evidently not distant when\r\nthe _Æsthetics_ will form as essential a portion of school courses as\r\nFrench or Algebra, we cannot be too grateful to one who has prepared\r\nsuch an eminently practical yet agreeable introduction to such studies.\r\nTo the general reader who lacks the time or patience to work his way\r\nthrough the interminable works of Vasari, Kugler, or Lanzi, and who can\r\nbe satisfied with an account of the most eminent painters, narrated in\r\na concise yet highly interesting manner, this work must be invaluable.\r\n\r\nWe have looked over an edition of YOUNG'S _Night Thoughts_, edited by\r\nJAMES ROBERT BOYD, and published by Mr. Scribner. It reminds us of\r\nthat edition of Milton, by some eastern gentleman (there is a copy in\r\nthe Harvard College library), in which \"the versification is somewhat\r\nimproved, and for better effect a few new figures are put in here and\r\nthere.\" Except that memorable specimen of editorial silliness and\r\nsacrilege, we must confess--nay, we gladly confess--that we have never\r\nseen or heard of any thing worse than this very handsomely printed\r\nedition of Young's _Night Thoughts_. As the respectable publisher of it\r\nmust have supposed Mr. Boyd possessed of some qualifications for the\r\ntask undertaken by him, we will be a little more particular than is\r\nour wont, and convince him, and convince that part of the public which\r\nreads this magazine, that Mr. Boyd's edition of Young is an unendurable\r\nimposition. Dr. Young was a writer of singular naturalness of feeling\r\nand simplicity of style. As has frequently been observed of his works,\r\nlacking the romantic passion and fiery impulse which would commend them\r\nmost to the tastes of middle life, they are the chosen companions of\r\nyouth and age. There has scarcely ever been a poet who so little needed\r\nannotation; his \"great argument,\" indeed, sometimes might be more\r\neasily apprehended if a little simplified by a clear-headed schoolman,\r\nbut his verbal transparency is such that he needs, in this respect, no\r\ntinkering whatever. Yet Mr. Boyd makes nearly half his book of notes,\r\nand of notes, too, in which the great purpose of the poem is never\r\ntouched--notes composed of mere platitudes, as useless, meaningless,\r\nand ridiculous, as would be the repetition of Swift's \"nonsense verses\"\r\nin the margin of every page. We copy at random a few examples:\r\n\r\n    I wake: how happy they who wake no more!\r\n\r\n    NOTE. \"_I wake._\" This expression suggested to the poet the\r\n    expressive contrast, \"How happy they who wake no more.\"\r\n\r\n    A mind that fain would wander from its woe.\r\n\r\n    NOTE. _Fain_: gladly.\r\n\r\n    Teach my best reason, reason; my best will\r\n    Teach rectitude.\r\n\r\n    NOTE. _Teach_, &c. Teach my best reason what is reasonable:\r\n    cause the best actings of my intellectual powers to be more\r\n    strictly conformed to what is reasonable, true, and fit.\r\n\r\n                  We take no note of Time\r\n    But from its loss: to give it then a tongue.\r\n\r\n    NOTE. _To give it then a tongue._ To cause time to speak to us!\r\n\r\n    Here teems with revolutions every hour.\r\n\r\n    NOTE. _Here_, &c. On this earth every hour teems with\r\n    revolutions!\r\n\r\n    I would not damp, but to secure, thy joys.\r\n\r\n    NOTE. _But to secure_, &c. But with a view to secure thy joys!\r\n\r\n    No moment, but in purchase of its worth.\r\n\r\n    NOTE. _Of its worth_: Of something equally valuable!\r\n\r\n    Nature, in zeal for human amity.\r\n\r\n    NOTE. _In zeal for human amity_: In the exercise of zeal for\r\n    encouraging human friendship!\r\n\r\nAnd so on through all the book--scarcely any thing but these miserable\r\npuerilities. There cannot be a child in the world to whom the poet's\r\nmeaning would not be as plain from the text, as from such notes. In\r\nother cases, where the author is perfectly plain to nearly the meanest\r\napprehensions, Mr. Boyd himself cannot understand him; for instance:\r\n\r\n    While o'er my limbs sleep's soft dominion spread,\r\n    What though my soul fantastic measures trod\r\n    O'er fairy fields, or mourned along the gloom\r\n    Of pathless woods, or, down the craggy steep\r\n    Hurl'd headlong, swam with pain the mantled flood.\r\n\r\nThe obvious idea in these last lines is, that, hurled down into a\r\npool, battlemented, or _mantled_ about, he swam with pain, seeing no\r\negress up the craggy or precipitous rocks: a use of the word \"mantled,\"\r\nwhich is justified by instances in many of the best ancient and modern\r\nwriters. But Mr. Boyd reduces the lines to the poorest stuff by the\r\nfollowing\r\n\r\n    NOTE. _Mantled_: Expanded, spread out, as a mantle.\r\n\r\nAn instance of his prosaic feebleness occurs on page 86.\r\n\r\n    Thought, busy thought, too busy for my peace.\r\n    Through the dark postern of long time elapsed,\r\n    Led softly, by the stillness of the night....\r\n    In quest of wretchedness perversely strays,\r\n    And finds all desert now, and meets the ghosts\r\n    Of my departed joys, a numerous train.\r\n\r\n    NOTE. _Ghosts of my departed days_: The bare recollection of\r\n    them!\r\n\r\nThis is a new exhibition of the \"art of sinking.\" The whole commentary\r\nsuggests the idea of making a noble poem contemptible, by covering it\r\nover with diminutive conceits and bungling impertinences.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"INJUSTICE TO THE SOUTH,\" is everywhere a fruitful subject of\r\ndiscussion. In politics, in religion, in letters, our friends beyond\r\nWashington will not believe us in the North capable of treating them\r\nwith fairness. In literature we have constantly heard it alleged that\r\nsuccess should never be dreamed of by an author who had the misfortune\r\nto be born the wrong side of Mason and Dixon's line. The superstition\r\nis not without its uses. It affords abundant consolation to a vast\r\nnumber of young gentleman whose books produce no profits. Yet we are\r\ninclined to believe it is altogether without any foundation in reason;\r\nthat _The Scarlet Letter_ would have been as popular from Charleston\r\nas from Concord. We have an amusing illustration of the feeling on\r\nthis point, in the last _Southern Literary Messenger_. The amiable and\r\neminently accomplished editor of that work counts among his personal\r\nfriends as many northern gentlemen as have had ever opportunity to know\r\nhim, yet he honestly believes us incapable of appreciating the genius\r\nof a poet from one of the tobacco, sugar, or cotton states. Introducing\r\nsome pretty verses entitled _The Marriage of the Sun and Moon_, \"by the\r\nlate H. S. Ellenwood, of North Carolina,\" into his last number, he says:\r\n\r\n    \"Had the gifted author been a native of Massachusetts, his\r\n    name would be familiar as household words; as it is, we doubt\r\n    whether one in ten of our readers has ever heard of it.\"\r\n\r\nHe _was_ a native of Massachusetts. His original name was Small, and he\r\nwas born in Salem, in the year of grace 1790; at sixteen apprenticed\r\nto J. T. Buckingham, of Boston; at twenty-one had his name changed\r\nto H. S. Ellenwood; in 1820 emigrated to North Carolina; and on the\r\n2d of April, 1843, he died, in Wilmington, in that state, having\r\njust established there the _Daily Advertiser_. We suspect that, in\r\nliterature at least, all charges of \"injustice to the South,\" are as\r\nill founded as this.\r\n\r\nThe _American Gift Books_ for the present season surpass any hitherto\r\npublished, both as regards literature and art. The _Home Book of the\r\nPicturesque_, published by Mr. Putnam, is the finest combination of\r\nall needful qualities for such a work, that has ever appeared in the\r\nEnglish language. The late Fenimore Cooper (of whose admirable article\r\nwe publish a large portion in preceding pages), Miss Susan Fenimore\r\nCooper, Washington Irving, W. C. Bryant, N. P. Willis, Alfred B.\r\nStreet, Bayard Taylor, and Dr. Bethune, are among the contributors, and\r\nDurand, Huntington, Cole, Cropsey, &c., furnish pictures, from the most\r\nstriking, beautiful, and least-known scenery in America. The publishers\r\nof the world do not this year furnish a volume more admirable. The\r\n_Book of Home Beauty_, containing exquisitely engraved portraits of\r\nsome of the most distinguished women in American society, by Charles\r\nMartin, with letter-press by Mrs. Kirkland, is another fine quarto;\r\nand _The Memorial_, an octavo, written by Nathanael Hawthorne, N. P.\r\nWillis, G. P. R. James, R. B. Kimball, Dr. Mayo, W. G. Simms, Mrs.\r\nHewitt, Mrs. Oakes Smith, and others, is very much above any \"Keepsake\"\r\nor \"Souvenir\" ever before printed in England or in America.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have new volumes of Poems, by Messrs. LONGFELLOW, BAYARD TAYLOR, and\r\nR. H. STODDARD, from the press of Ticknor, Reed, and Fields, of which\r\nappropriate notices are deferred until the next month.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMESSRS. APPLETON have a series of works, equally remarkable for\r\ntypographical and pictorial magnificence and literary interest.\r\n_Christmas with the Poets_ is admitted to be, on the whole, the most\r\nadmirably executed production of the printing press; _The Women of\r\nEarly Christianity_, written by eminent authors, and edited by the Rev.\r\nMr. Spencer, presents attractively the domestic romance of religious\r\nhistory, with seventeen very excellent engravings, making an imperial\r\noctavo, in the style of that remarkably popular series, the _Women of\r\nthe Bible_, the _Women of the Old and New Testament_, and _Our Saviour\r\nwith Prophets and Apostles_, all of which are now published in styles\r\nto suit the cabinet of art, the drawing-room table, or the library.\r\nAnother very interesting and richly illustrated work from this house\r\nis _The Land of Bondage_, by Dr. Wainwright, corresponding with the\r\nsame author's splendid volume, _The Pathways and Abiding Places of\r\nOur Lord_. The Appletons also publish for the coming holidays Mrs.\r\nJameson's most successful work, the _Beauties of the Court of Charles\r\nthe Second_, with twenty-one finely engraved portraits, and _The Queens\r\nof England_, by Agnes Strickland, with eighteen portraits--a work of\r\nwhich the fame is as extensive as a love of art or an admiration of\r\nwoman; and _Lyrics of the Heart_, a very finely illustrated collection\r\nof the poems of Alaric A. Watts. The other illustrated works from\r\nthis house are enumerated in the advertising pages at the end of this\r\nmagazine, to which we ask attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fine Arts.\r\n\r\n\r\nA series of four compositions representing the Seasons, by CALAME,\r\na Swiss artist, is highly praised in the _Grenzboten_, as something\r\naltogether original and superior to the technical traditions of the\r\nschools. They were painted for a Russian gentleman, and were exhibited\r\nfor a short time in Berlin. Spring is an Italian or Grecian landscape\r\nof the antique world, and the time is morning; Summer is a German scene\r\nand the time noon; Autumn is from the lake country of Switzerland and\r\nthe time late afternoon; Winter is a late evening scene with moonlight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. HARDING'S noble full-length of _Daniel Webster_--the best work of\r\nits class ever engraved in this country--may now be purchased at two\r\ndollars and a half per copy, of Sherman & Adriance, Astor House.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe celebrated _Portrait of Bishop White_, painted by Henry Inman, and\r\nengraved in London, by Wagstaff, is now published from the original\r\nplate, by Andrews and Meeser, of Philadelphia, at three dollars per\r\ncopy.

Several other historical\r\nsculptures are in preparation for the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHistorical Review of the Month.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of November the state election in New York resulted in the\r\nchoice of all but two of the democratic candidates, and the defeat of\r\nthe whigs on the great question respecting the canals. The closeness\r\nof the vote may be inferred from the majorities: For _Controller_,\r\nWright over Patterson 527; _Secretary of State_, Randall over Forsyth\r\n1420; _Treasurer_, Cook (whig) over Welch, 64; _Attorney General_,\r\nChatfield over Ullmann, 294; _Canal Commissioner_, Fitzhugh (whig)\r\nover Wheaton, 745; _State Engineer_, McAlpine over Seymour, 2390.\r\nIn New Jersey, on the same day, a large majority of the legislature\r\nwas elected by the democrats. In Delaware, on the same day, it was\r\ndetermined to hold a convention for revising the constitution of the\r\nstate, by 2,129 majority. In Louisiana, on the 3d, the whigs carried\r\nthe legislature, and gained one member of Congress (Moore over Morse).\r\nIn Wisconsin the whigs have elected Farwell, their candidate for\r\nGovernor, and a majority of the legislature. Maryland, on the 5th, the\r\nentire democratic ticket, for comptroller, register, &c., was elected,\r\nwith a majority of the legislature. In Michigan, the same day, the\r\ndemocrats, as usual, carried nearly every thing. In Massachusetts,\r\non the 10th, there was a failure to elect a governor, but numerous\r\nvacancies to be filled in the legislature, it is supposed at this time\r\n(20th), will enable the whigs to succeed in that body. The vote was the\r\nlargest ever thrown in the State. In Mississippi, Mr. Foote's majority\r\nis about 1500. In Tennessee, ex-Governor James C. Jones (whig), was\r\nelected to the United States Senate on the 14th. In Georgia, the new\r\nlegislature assembled on the 3d, Governor Cobb was inaugurated on the\r\n5th, and Mr. Toombs, now representative in Congress, was chosen United\r\nStates Senator on the 10th. He is a Southern Rights Whig Unionist, and\r\nsucceeds Mr. Burrien.\r\n\r\nA correspondence has taken place between the Spanish minister at\r\nWashington and the Secretary of State, which, it is understood, assures\r\na settlement of the difficulties arising from the invasion of Cuba; but\r\nadditional discontent has been occasioned by the arrest, imprisonment,\r\ntrial, and sentence (on the 12th of November), at Havana, of an\r\nAmerican citizen, John G. Thrasher, for \"disloyalty,\" to eight years\r\nhard labor in a Spanish fortress. Mr. Thrasher is a native of Maine,\r\nand had been for several years editor of the _Faro Industrial_, at\r\nHavana.\r\n\r\nJudge Kane, in the Circuit Court of Pennsylvania, has given his\r\ndecision in the Telegraph Case, sustaining Morse's pretensions\r\nthroughout, and against Bain. The decision is in favor of Morse on\r\nall points, and establishes that he is solely entitled to the art of\r\ninstantaneously recording messages at a distance. The case will now go\r\nto the Supreme Court, with probably the same result.\r\n\r\nThe great Methodist Episcopal Church case was decided on the 11th of\r\nNovember, in the United States District Court, in favor of the Southern\r\nclaimants. The sum in dispute was $750,000--being the amount at which\r\nthe Book Concern of the Society is estimated--and the decision gives to\r\nthe Methodist Church South its proportion of this property.\r\n\r\nIn the United States District Court, at Philadelphia, on the 7th\r\nNovember, the Grand Jury presented seventy-eight indictments against\r\nthirty-nine of the participants in the riot at Christiana. Each of the\r\naccused is charged with high treason.\r\n\r\nEfforts for the separation of California into new states are vigorously\r\nprosecuted. The latest intelligence from the mines is favorable. Oregon\r\nwill probably come into the Union as two states.\r\n\r\nThere have been a great number of fatal accidents in the last few\r\nweeks, of which we can give but the results in loss of lives:\r\n\r\n                                                                _Lives._\r\n  Propeller Henry Clay, lost on Lake Erie, October 23,                30\r\n  Steamer Buckeye run into a sloop, Lake Erie, same day,               3\r\n  Steamer William Penn, off Cape Cod, struck sloop, same day,          4\r\n  Ship Oregon, sunk at sea lat. 36-1/2, long. 69-1/2, October 27,      3\r\n  Schooner Christiana, capsized, Lake Ontario, about the same time,    9\r\n  Schooner William Penn, lost about the same time,        _Entire crew._\r\n  Embankment fell in at Spencerport, N.

After two days'\r\ndisturbance, the affair was adjusted, and order restored.\r\n\r\nIn Mexico, for the present, the insurrection of Caravajal has failed,\r\nand the siege of Matamoras has been abandoned. In New Grenada the\r\nJesuit revolt under Borrero has been put down and Borrero captured.\r\nFrom Buenos Ayres we learn that General Oribe has been overthrown, and\r\nthat Rosas is in the utmost danger, but the results of recent important\r\nevents there are not yet well understood.\r\n\r\nLittle has occurred in Great Britain, of much importance, except the\r\ndemonstrations occasioned by the arrival of Kossuth, at Southampton,\r\non the 23d of October. The Hungarian chief has been received with\r\nunparalleled enthusiasm in Southampton, London, Manchester, and\r\nelsewhere, and in many long and powerful speeches has vindicated his\r\ngreat reputation for wisdom and for honest devotion to the liberties\r\nof his country. He was to leave England in the steamer Washington, for\r\nNew-York, on the 14th November, and will probably have arrived here\r\nbefore this paragraph is published. In the United States a triumph even\r\nmore enthusiastic than that in England awaits him. The Caffre war in\r\nSouth Africa is still extending, and the British forces have obtained,\r\nin no case, decided or important advantages.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Europe is more than ever concentrated on France.\r\nLouis Napoleon, who had deprived the nation of the right of suffrage,\r\nin despair of reëlection by any other means finally determined on the\r\nabrogation of the restricting law of the 31st of May; his ministers\r\nresigned; after a considerable period a new ministry, with little\r\nweight of personal character, was formed; and on the 4th of November\r\nthe new session of the French Legislative Assembly was opened in Paris,\r\nto receive the President's Message, and at once to vote down its\r\ncardinal recommendations. The world watching with deep interest that\r\nconflict of the factions in France which must be brought to a close\r\nwith the present term of her unscrupulous ruler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent Deaths.\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHIBALD ALEXANDER, D.D., LL. D., late Professor of Theology in the\r\nSeminary of the Presbyterian Church at Princeton, in New Jersey, was\r\nborn on the 17th of April, 1772, on the banks of a small tributary of\r\nthe James River, called South River, and near the western foot of the\r\nBlue Ridge, in that part of Augusta County, Virginia, which has since,\r\nfrom the great natural curiosity it contains, been named Rockbridge.\r\nHe was descended by both parents from Presbyterians of Scotland, who\r\nemigrated first to Ireland, and thence to America. He was educated at\r\nLiberty Hall Academy, which has since become Washington College, under\r\nthe instructions of the founder of that institution, Rev. William\r\nGraham, an able and eminent preacher and professor. Besides Mr. Graham,\r\nhis classical teachers were James Priestly, afterward President of\r\nCumberland College, Tennessee, and Archibald Roane, afterward Governor\r\nof Tennessee. In the summer of 1789, he joined in the full communion\r\nof the church, and commenced the study of theology under Mr. Graham,\r\nwho had a class of six or eight students. He was licensed to preach by\r\nthis Presbytery of Lexington, October 1, 1791, and was ordained on the\r\n5th of May, 1795. Part of the intervening years he spent in itinerant\r\nlabors in Virginia, and in that region which is now Ohio. In the spring\r\nof 1797 he became President of Hampden Sydney College, in the County\r\nof Prince Edward, at the same time being pastor of the churches of\r\nBriery and Cumberland. He was now but twenty-five years old, and it\r\nmay safely be alleged that there was never won in this country, at so\r\nearly an age, a more brilliant or a purer reputation. His arduous and\r\nresponsible duties were discharged with industry and energy, equal to\r\nhis abilities, until health gave way, and, in the spring of 1801, he\r\nresigned these charges, in well-grounded apprehension of a settled\r\npulmonary consumption. The summer of 1802 was spent by Mr. Alexander\r\nin travelling on horseback through New England, and by this means he\r\nso far recovered his health as to resume the Presidency of the College\r\nand the charge of his parishes. About the same time he was married to\r\nJanette Waddell, second daughter of Rev. Jonas Waddell, D.D., that\r\nremarkable preacher whose blindness and eloquence have been celebrated\r\nby Mr. Wirt in _The British Spy_. In the Autumn of 1806 he received\r\na call from the Third Presbyterian Church, at the corner of Pine and\r\nFourth-sts., in Philadelphia. Though he had declined an invitation to\r\nthe same church ten years before, he accepted this, and thus became\r\na second time the successor of the Rev. John Blair Smith, D.D. He\r\ncontinued at this post until, in the spring of 1812, he was summoned\r\nby the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church to be the first\r\nProfessor in the Theological Seminary then just founded at Princeton.\r\nThis chair, we believe, he occupied until his death--until within a\r\nfew weeks, at least, discharging all its honorable duties. It is a\r\npleasing fact that the first two Professors in this Institution were\r\nassociated in its service nearly forty years. During this period a\r\nlarge number of clergymen have proceeded from the seminary, and it has\r\nnow not far from one hundred and fifty students. It is important to\r\nobserve that it has no connection with the College of New Jersey, at\r\nthe same place. The eminent usefulness of Dr. Alexander is not to be\r\nmeasured by the long and wise discharge of his duties as a professor.\r\nHe was a voluminous, very able and popular writer. In addition to\r\noccasional sermons and discourses, and numerous smaller treatises, he\r\nwrote constantly for _The Princeton Review_, a quarterly miscellany\r\nof literature, and theological and general learning, of the highest\r\ncharacter, which is now in the twenty-seventh year of its publication.\r\nHis work on _The Evidences of the Christian Religion_ has passed\r\nthrough numerous editions in Great Britain as well as in America,\r\nand this, as well as his _Treatise on the Canon of Scripture_, which\r\nhas also been republished abroad, we believe, has appeared in two or\r\nthree other languages. The substance of the latter has, however, been\r\nincorporated with more recent editions of the former, under the title\r\nof _Evidences of the Authenticity, Inspiration and Canonical Authority\r\nof the Holy Scriptures_, of which a fifth edition--the last we have\r\nseen--was published in Philadelphia in 1847. Among his other works are\r\n_Thoughts on Religion; a Compend of Bible Truth_; and a _History of\r\nColonization on the Western Coast of Africa_--the last an octavo volume\r\nof more than six hundred pages, published in Philadelphia in 1846. His\r\nprincipal writings, however, have been on practical religion and on the\r\nHistory and Biography of the Church, and these for the most part have\r\nbeen published anonymously. Dr. Alexander was the father of six sons,\r\nof whom three are clergymen. The eldest, James W. Alexander, D.D., for\r\nseveral years Professor in the College of New Jersey, and sometime\r\nPastor of the Duane-street Church in this city, is a fine scholar and\r\nan able preacher, and has enrolled himself among the benefactors of\r\nthe people by many writings of the highest practical value designed\r\nto elevate the condition of the laboring classes to the true dignity\r\nof citizenship and a Christian life. Another is Rev. Joseph Addison\r\nAlexander, D.D., Professor of Oriental Literature in the Theological\r\nSeminary at Princeton, and author of the well-known works on the\r\nEarlier and the Later Prophecies of Isaiah. He is generally regarded as\r\none of the most profound and sagacious scholars of the present age. The\r\nlate venerable Professor was undoubtedly one of those who, by the union\r\nof a most Christian spirit and a faultless life to great abilities,\r\nhave been deserving of the praise of doing most for the advancement of\r\ntrue religion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDR. J. KEARNEY ROGERS, for a long time one of the most able and\r\nrespected physicians and surgeons of New-York, died on the 9th of\r\nNovember. He was born in New-York in 1793, graduated at Princeton in\r\n1811, studied medicine in Edinburgh, London, and Paris, and returning\r\nto New York was the friend and associate of Dr. Post, Dr. Hossack, Dr.\r\nFrancis, Dr. Delafield, and other eminent members of his profession,\r\nin establishing medical and surgical institutions, &c. He has left no\r\nwritings in print or MS. for the public.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Rev. WILLIAM CROSWELL, D.D., Rector of the Church of the Advent,\r\nin Boston, died in that city very suddenly, on the evening of Sunday,\r\nNovember 9, having preached and administered the sacrament of baptism\r\nduring the day. Dr. Croswell was born in New-Haven, Connecticut, on\r\nthe 7th of November, 1804, was the son of the Rev. Dr. Croswell of\r\nthat city, and was educated at Yale College, where he was graduated\r\nin the summer of 1824. He was subsequently, for two years, associated\r\nwith Dr. DOANE, now Bishop of New Jersey, in the editorship of the\r\n_Episcopal Watchman_ at Hartford, after which he removed to Boston, and\r\nwas for several years minister of Christ's Church, in that city. He\r\nthen became rector of St. Peter's, in Auburn, New York, and at length\r\nreturned to Boston, where his numerous warm friends gladly welcomed his\r\nsettlement as minister of the Church of the Advent. Dr. Croswell was a\r\nscholar, and possessed a fine taste in literature, with very unusual\r\npowers as a writer. Among his poems, are many of remarkable grace and\r\nsweetness, and a few evincing a happy vein of satire. His poems are\r\nnearly all religious, and Bishop DOANE, in a note to his edition of\r\nKeble's \"Christian Year,\" remarks that \"he has more unwritten poetry in\r\nhim\" than any man he knows. We hope Bishop Doane will commemorate his\r\nfriendship, and the genius and virtues of Dr. Croswell, in a memoir,\r\nand collection of his works.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDR. GRANVILLE SHARPE PATTISON, an eminent teacher of anatomy, died\r\nin New York, after a short illness, on the 12th of November, in the\r\nsixty-first year of his age. He was born near Glasgow, in Scotland,\r\nwhere his father was a cotton spinner, and was educated in that city,\r\nstudying surgery under the late eminent Professor John Burns. On\r\nobtaining his degree, he commenced the practice of his profession in\r\nGlasgow, with prospects of eminent success, and soon became one of the\r\nsurgeons of the Andersonian Institution, and a lecturer on anatomy. An\r\nunfortunate domestic affair, of which the details may be learned from\r\nthe report of a trial which resulted in the divorce of Prof. Andrew\r\nUre from his wife, in 1819, caused Dr. Pattison to come to the United\r\nStates. He settled in Baltimore, where he resumed his profession as\r\na lecturer on anatomy; and, going afterwards to England, he became a\r\nprofessor in the medical school connected with the London University.\r\nHe continued but a short time in England, and on returning to this\r\ncountry he accepted the place of Professor of Anatomy in the Jefferson\r\nMedical College in Philadelphia, which he filled successfully until\r\n1840, when he was made Professor of Anatomy in the Medical School\r\nconnected with the New-York University--an office which he held until\r\nhis death, having delivered his last lecture but a week before that\r\nevent. Dr. Pattison was a man of fine social qualities, and was one\r\nof the best lecturers in this country. His published writings display\r\nthe best capacities for his vocation--are shrewd, judicious, and\r\nhappily delivered--but for the most part fragmentary. His editions of\r\nCruveilhier's _Anatomy of the Human Body_, Mase's _Anatomical Atlas_,\r\nand other works, are well known, and he wrote many important papers in\r\nthe American Medical Recorder, besides several pamphlets of a personal\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. STEPHENS, the author of \"Martinuzzi,\" and the \"Manuscripts of\r\nErdely,\" died on the 8th of October, in Camden-town. He was in his\r\nfifty-first year, and, in early life, had produced several tragic\r\ndramas that commanded the attention of critics, both foreign and\r\nnative. Schlegel abroad, and \"minor Beddoes\" at home, praised his\r\ntragedies of \"Montezuma\" and the \"Vampire;\" and, at a later period, his\r\n\"Gertrude and Beatrice\" excited, among the few who take an interest in\r\ndramatic poetry, great admiration. His last work consisted of \"Dramas\r\nfor the Stage,\" in two volumes, but it was only privately circulated.\r\nMr. Stephens' dramatic poetry was distinguished by intense passion and\r\nfervor; but at the early part of his career, he lacked the constructive\r\npower. Finding that the stage monopoly, so long existing, was an\r\neffectual bar to the higher original drama being produced, he joined,\r\nabout the year 1841, a guild of zealous literary young men, who were\r\nbent on doing something towards theatrical reform. Mrs. Warner and\r\nMr. Phelps united themselves to these dramatic aspirants; and the\r\nresult was, that the Lyceum Theatre was taken for a month, for the\r\nperformance of a new five-act tragedy, notwithstanding the existing\r\nlaw to the contrary. The tragedy was licensed as an opera in three\r\nacts, and was at length acted with some of the songs retained. This\r\nretention of musical irrelevancies, in obedience to the law, while it\r\nmade the law itself absurd, could not fail of injuring the drama in\r\nwhich they were introduced; and, had its merits not been extraordinary,\r\n\"Martinuzzi,\" under such circumstances, could not have lived a single\r\nnight. As it was, it struggled through the month, making partisans\r\nto the experiment, though at the sacrifice of the author's means\r\nand feelings. Mr. Stephens accepted the martyrdom freely, and went\r\nthrough it nobly, for the sake of the cause which to his death he held\r\nsacred. Moreover, he would have continued the contest, but that he was\r\nstrongly advised to the contrary by Mr. Sheridan Knowles, and Mr. John\r\nA. Heraud, the latter of whom had been actively engaged in getting up\r\n\"Martinuzzi,\" but thought that sufficient demonstration had been made.\r\nIn this he was right, as it subsequently proved; for, shortly after,\r\nin conjunction with Mr. Edward Mayhew and some other gentlemen, he was\r\na party to the drawing up, in committee, of a bill for the liberation\r\nof the stage, the draft of which was forwarded to Sir Robert Peel, who\r\nplaced it in the hands of Lord Mahon, by whom it was carried through\r\nParliament; and thus every theatre was enabled legally to perform the\r\nShakspearian and five-act drama. Mr. George Stephens himself, sick of\r\ndramatic disappointment, turned his ardent mind into a new channel, and\r\nbecame involved in railway speculations, and in them lost his fortune.\r\nHis latter days were accordingly passed in narrow circumstances,\r\naccompanied with physical prostration quite deplorable. They who had\r\nbenefited by his exertions, neglected him. His love for the drama and\r\npower of composition remained uninjured, but encouragement attached\r\nitself to younger candidates. His high principle, determined courage,\r\npersonal pride and fortitude, however, continued with him to the last;\r\nand as he was a pious and religious man, he bore suffering and neglect\r\nnot only with patience, but with confidence that the good cause in\r\nwhich he had labored would ultimately prosper.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe celebrated missionary CHARLES GUTZLAFF, of whom we gave an\r\ninteresting account in the _International_ last year (vol. i. 317),\r\ndied at Canton on the 9th of August, in the forty-eighth year of his\r\nage. He was born on the 8th of July, 1803, at Pyritz, in the Prussian\r\nprovince of Pomerania, of parents whose very moderate circumstances\r\nprevented them from affording him the education requisite for a\r\nChristian missionary, to become which was his most anxious desire.\r\nAfter attending for some time the schools of his native town, he was\r\nsent to Stettin as an apprentice to a belt-maker. There he composed\r\na short poem, in which he expressed his strong religious feelings,\r\nwith his hitherto unavailing wishes respecting his career in life,\r\nand which he presented to the king of Prussia, on occasion of a visit\r\npaid by the latter to Stettin, in 1821. The effect of this step was to\r\nprocure his admission as a pupil into the missionary institution at\r\nBerlin. Such was the progress which he made in his studies, that only\r\ntwo years afterwards, in the spring of the year 1823, he was judged\r\nto be sufficiently qualified for the object he had in view. He was\r\nsent to the Dutch Missionary Society at Rotterdam, which appointed him\r\nto be one of their missionaries to the East. But becoming more than\r\never sensible of the arduousness of the functions he had undertaken\r\nto perform, he did not venture to embark for his destination until\r\nthe month of August, 1826, having devoted himself, in the mean time,\r\nto a further diligent preparation for future usefulness. The first\r\nmissionary ground assigned him was in the island of Java. He took up\r\nhis residence at Batavia, where he married an English woman who was\r\npossessed of considerable property, and where, by mingling with the\r\nChinese inhabitants, in the course of two years he acquired so skilful\r\na use of their language, and became so intimately acquainted with their\r\nmodes of life and intercourse with each other, as to be adopted by them\r\ninto one of their families, and to have a Chinese name assigned to him.\r\nThe circumstances just mentioned produced an important change in his\r\nplans. In the possession, as he now was, of a pecuniary independence,\r\nhe resolved to break off his connection with the Dutch missionary\r\nsociety, and to proceed to China, to preach the gospel to the Chinese\r\nin their own country, to the extent that he might be allowed to do so.\r\nIn the first place, however, he accompanied an English missionary,\r\nnamed Tomlin, to Siam, in the summer of 1828. This journey occupied\r\nGutzlaff for a period of upwards of three years. Besides laboring\r\ndiligently in his vocation as a Christian minister, he composed,\r\nwhile residing at Bankok, a Siamese grammar, and, in conjunction with\r\nTomlin, translated the New Testament into the Siamese language. He next\r\nproceeded to China, where, associating himself with Morrison, Medhurst,\r\nand other European missionaries, he selected Macao for his principal\r\nstation. He established schools, distributed religious tracts among\r\nthe people, assisted in a new translation of the Bible into Chinese,\r\nco-operated with Morrison in founding a society for the diffusion of\r\nuseful knowledge in China, published a Chinese Monthly Magazine, and\r\nyet did not neglect, at Macao, and in various excursions made from\r\nthat place, the preaching of Christianity to the inhabitants. All this\r\nwent on without any hindrance, until Gutzlaff excited the suspicion\r\nof the Chinese authorities of his labors being in some way connected\r\nwith the interested views of the English traders; and, in consequence,\r\nan attempt made by him in May, 1835, to penetrate into the province\r\nof Fokien, proved altogether unsuccessful. The printing of Chinese\r\nbooks of a Christian character was now forbidden; the distribution of\r\nsuch books was obliged to be suspended; and it became necessary to\r\nremove the printing presses from Macao to Singapore. Thus restricted\r\nin his missionary sphere, Gutzlaff felt himself the more at liberty to\r\naccompany the British expedition against China, and to be exceedingly\r\nserviceable to it by his intimate acquaintance with the language and\r\ncustoms of the Chinese. He was also an active agent in bringing about\r\nthe treaty of peace, concluded between the contending parties in 1842.\r\n\r\nHis literary labors have had an almost incredible extent and variety.\r\nHe himself gives the following enumeration of his writings: \"In\r\nDutch I have written: a History of our Mission and of Distinguished\r\nMissionaries, and an appeal for support of the Missionary Work;\r\nin German: Sketches of the Minor Prophets; in Latin: the Life of\r\nour Savior; in English: Sketches of Chinese History; China Opened;\r\nLife of Kanghe, together with a great number of articles on the\r\nReligion, History, Philosophy, Literature and Laws of the Chinese;\r\nin Siamese: a Translation of the New Testament, with the Psalms,\r\nand an English-Siamese Dictionary, English Cambodian Dictionary and\r\nEnglish-Laos Dictionary. These works I left to my successors to\r\nfinish, but with the exception of the Siamese Dictionary they have\r\nadded nothing to them. In Cochin-Chinese: a Complete Dictionary of\r\nCochin-Chinese-English and English-Cochin-Chinese; this work is not\r\nyet printed. In Chinese: Forty Tracts, along with three editions of\r\nthe Life of our Savior; a Translation of the New Testament, the third\r\nedition of which I have carried through the press. Of the Translations\r\nof the Old Testament, the Prophets and the two first books of Moses\r\nare completed. In this language I have also written The Chinese\r\nScientific Monthly Review, a History of England, a History of the Jews,\r\na Universal History and Geography, on Commerce, a Short Account of the\r\nBritish Empire and its Inhabitants, as well as a number of smaller\r\narticles. In Japanese: a Translation of the New Testament, and of the\r\nfirst book of Moses, two tracts, and several scientific pamphlets. The\r\nonly paper to which I now send communications is the Hong-Kong Gazette,\r\nthe whole Chinese department of which I have undertaken. Till 1842 I\r\nwrote for the Chinese Archives.\"\r\n\r\nThe last year Mr. Gutzlaff spent in Europe, and he had recently\r\ncompleted some important works, to be added to the above list,\r\nrespecting Chinese affairs and civilization, one of which is a life\r\nof the late Chinese Emperor, with whom the missionary appears to have\r\nhad a more intimate personal acquaintance than was ever yielded to\r\nany other European. The family of Mr. Gutzlaff lately travelled some\r\ntime in the United States, where they were well received in religious\r\ncircles, and Mr. Gutzlaff himself felt some disappointment that\r\nunlooked-for duties in Germany prevented him from extending his tour to\r\nthe Churches and Universities of this country. A careful investigation\r\nwill show that his long and faithful labors have had a powerful\r\ninfluence in favor of Christianity in China.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe once powerful and celebrated Don MANUEL GODOY, Prince of the Peace,\r\nDuke of Alcudia, &c., died in Paris on the 4th of October. He was born\r\nat Badejoz, of a noble family, in 1767, at seventeen years of age he\r\nentered the Royal Guards, and being soon after taken into high favor\r\nby the queen Maria Louisa, of Parma, he became at the end of the last\r\nand beginning of the present century, a prominent actor in the most\r\nimportant political events of Spain, of which country, for a time, he\r\nwas Minister and absolute ruler. His conduct was the proximate cause of\r\nthe Spanish war with Napoleon. Prince Ferdinand (afterwards Ferdinand\r\nVII.), tired of the thraldom in which he was kept by his mother and her\r\nMinister, applied for protection to Napoleon; and Godoy, discovering\r\nthat he had done so, accused him of a conspiracy to dethrone his\r\nfather. This led to the most scandalous scenes. A revolt broke out\r\nat Aranjuez, and Godoy nearly lost his life. Charles IV. abdicated,\r\nand Ferdinand assumed the sceptre, but the Imperial ruler of France\r\nwould not permit him to hold it. Napoleon took the crown of Spain\r\nfor his own family, and the terrible Peninsular war was the result.\r\nThe consequence, meanwhile, to Godoy, was the loss of his wealth and\r\nhonors, and his residence in foreign lands for nearly the remainder of\r\nhis life. In 1847 the Spanish Minister published a decree, authorizing\r\nGodoy, by his inferior title of Duke of Alcudia, to return to Spain;\r\nand ordering that a certain portion of his once vast property should be\r\nrestored. The latter part of the decree was acted upon, however, in the\r\nsame manner as such restitution's are generally made in Spain. The only\r\nincome of Godoy continued to be an allowance by one of his children.\r\nWhatever may have been the conduct of this singular politician half a\r\ncentury ago, those who knew him in his old age could not but admire\r\nin him a fine specimen of the Castilian gentleman. To the very last\r\nhe was remarkable for the elegance of his manners, and high-bred\r\ncourtesy. In conversation he was most agreeable. The world, too, should\r\nbe charitable to his memory. Years of embarrassment, exile, poverty,\r\nand obscurity, have done much to atone for the faults committed in a\r\ntime of sudden and intoxicating exaltation, and of unbounded power by\r\nhim who was then a Prince, Prime Minister, and despot of Spain, but\r\nwho has died, with the weight of eighty-seven years upon him, a quiet,\r\ninoffensive, and forgotten man, in a retired lodging at Paris.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGEORGE BAKER, the historian of Northamptonshire, was born and brought\r\nup at Northampton. To him and his gifted sister, Miss Baker, his\r\nnative country is deeply indebted. Mr. Baker produced his learned\r\nand comprehensive _History of Northamptonshire_, at great expense of\r\nmoney and time, and at great loss to himself. The book ranks in the\r\nvery first grade of topographical literature, and is remarkable for\r\nthe perfection of its genealogical details. Unfortunately, the work is\r\nleft unfinished, owing to the ill health of its author and his want of\r\nfunds.

In 1835, he assisted in the\r\nestablishment of the Swedish Missionary Society, on which occasion\r\nhe fraternized with the Methodists at Stockholm. He also addressed a\r\nletter to the Evangelical Alliance, at its last meeting, regretting\r\nhis inability to attend. He has left to the University of Upsal\r\nhis library, consisting of upwards of 34,000 volumes, and his rich\r\ncollection of coins and medals, and of Scandinavian antiquities. This\r\nis the fourth library bequeathed to the University of Upsal within\r\nthe space of a year, adding to its book-shelves no fewer than 115,000\r\nvolumes. The entire number of volumes possessed by the University is\r\nnow said to be 288,000, 11,000 of these being in manuscript.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe theatrical architect, dramatic writer, and novelist, SAMUEL\r\nBEASELEY, died suddenly, on the 23d of October, at his residence,\r\nTonbridge Castle, Kent, in his sixty-sixth year, of apoplexy.

D., of London, was a native of Monmouth,\r\nand became a distinguished student and a fellow of of Oriel College,\r\nOxford. On a particular occasion, he happened to attract the attention\r\nof Lord Liverpool, then Premier, who, after inquiring, presented\r\nhim with the living of St. Giles-in-the-fields. This cure he filled\r\nactively and ably. To the stall in St. Paul's he was, without his\r\nasking, presented by the late Sir Robert Peel, \"to mark,\" as the\r\nMinister said, \"his sense of Mr. Tyler's exertions in the cause of\r\neducation at Oxford, and of his exemplary discharge of his onerous\r\nduties at St. Giles's.\" As an author, Mr. Tyler gained some celebrity.\r\nHis _Life of King Henry V._ attracted much attention.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEMMA MARTIN, a woman well known as a writer, and as an exemplar of\r\nSocialism, died on the 8th of October, at Finchley Common, near London,\r\nin the 39th year of her age. The London _Leader_, the organ of the\r\nBritish Socialists, says, that, \"allied to a husband (found in the\r\nreligious circle in which she was reared in Bristol) whose company it\r\nwas a humiliation to endure, she ultimately, even when she was the\r\nmother of three children, refused to continue to submit to it. This,\r\nthough afterwards made a reproach to her, was so justifiable, that even\r\nher religious friends found no fault with it. After much struggling\r\nto support her children unaided, she was united to another husband\r\n(Mr. Joshua Hopkins), her former one yet living. Though no marriage\r\nceremony was performed, or could be performed (such is the moral state\r\nof our law, which denies divorce to all who are wronged, if they happen\r\nto be also indigent), yet no affection was ever purer, no union ever\r\nmore honorable to both parties, and the whole range of priest-made\r\nmarriages never included one to which happiness belonged more surely,\r\nand upon which respect could dwell more truly. Our first knowledge of\r\nMrs. Martin,\" continues the _Leader_, \"was as an opponent of Socialism,\r\nagainst which she delivered public lectures. But as soon as she saw\r\nintellectual truth in it, she paused in her opposition to it. Long and\r\nserious was the conflict the change in her convictions caused her; but\r\nher native love of truth prevailed, and she came over to the advocacy\r\nof that she had so resolutely and ably assailed. And none who ever\r\noffered us alliance, rendered us greater service, or did it at greater\r\ncost. Beautiful in expression, quick in wit, strong in will, eloquent\r\nin speech, coherent in conviction, and of stainless character, she\r\nwas incomparable among public women. She was one of the few among the\r\nearly advocates of English Socialism who saw _that the conflict against\r\nreligion_ could not be confined to an attack on forms of faith--to a\r\nmere comparison of creeds; and she attached only secondary importance\r\nto the _abuses_ of Christianity, where she saw that _the whole_ was\r\nan abuse of history, of reason, and of morality. Thus she was cut off\r\nfrom all hope or sympathy from her former connections, and she met\r\nwith but limited friendships among her new allies. She saw further\r\nthan any around her what the new communism would end in. She saw that\r\nit would establish the healthy despotism of the affections, in lieu of\r\nthe factitious tyrannies of custom and Parliament. The nature of her\r\nopinions, which arose in conviction and not in antagonism, will best be\r\nseen in two passages from her writings, at two remarkable periods of\r\nher life. In 1835, she wrote in the _Bristol Literary Magazine_, which\r\nshe edited:--\r\n\r\n    \"'Infidelity is the effusion of weak minds, and the resource\r\n    of guilty ones. Like the desolating Simoom of the desert, it\r\n    withers every thing within its reach; and as soon as it has\r\n    prostrated the morality of the individual, it invades the civil\r\n    rights of society.'\r\n\r\n\"In 1844, in the seventh of her _Weekly Addresses to the Inhabitants of\r\nLondon_, of which it was the thirty-sixth thousand issued, she said:--\r\n\r\n    \"'When Christianity arose, it gathered to its standard the\r\n    polished Greek, the restless Roman, the barbarous Saxon; but it\r\n    was suited only to the age in which it grew. It had anathemas\r\n    for the bitter-hearted to hurl at those they chose to designate\r\n    God's enemies. It had promises for the hopeful, cautions\r\n    for the prudent, charity for the good. It was all things to\r\n    all men. It became the grand leader of the ascetic to the\r\n    convent--of the chivalrous to the crusade--of the cruel to the\r\n    Star Chamber--of the scholar to the secret midnight cell, there\r\n    to feed on knowledge, but not to impart it. But at length its\r\n    contentional doctrines bade men look elsewhere for _peace_--for\r\n    some less equivocal morality, some clearer doctrines, some\r\n    surer truth.'\r\n\r\n\"In this belief she lived, worked, taught, and in this belief she\r\ndied. And in passing to the kingdom of the inscrutable future, whose\r\ncredentials could she better take than those she had won by her\r\ncourage and truthfulness? Could she take Pagan, Buddhist, Mahommedan,\r\nChristian, or some morose sectarian shade; credentials soiled with\r\nage, torn in strifes, stained with blood?... Will any who calumniate\r\nthe last hours of Freethinkers utter the pious fraud over this narrow\r\nbed, and the memory of Emma Martin be distorted, as have been those\r\nof Voltaire and our own Paine? Does the apparition of these outrages\r\nglare upon this grave--outrages too ignoble to notice, too painful\r\nto recognize? Heed them not--believe them not. Let not the Christian\r\ninsult her whom only the grave has vanquished. Let him not utter the\r\nword of triumph over the dead, before whom living his coward tongue\r\nwould falter. Let his manliness teach him truth if his creed has failed\r\nto teach him courtesy. As a worker for human improvement, Mrs. Martin\r\nwas as indefatigable as efficient. From the time when she published\r\nher _Exiles of Piedmont_, to the issue of her essay on _God's Gifts\r\nand Man's Duties_, and later still, she wrote with ardor, always\r\nmanifesting force of personal thought, and what is more unusual in the\r\nwritings of women--strength and brevity of expression. Her lectures\r\nwere always distinguished by the _instruction_ they conveyed, and the\r\nearnestness with which they were delivered. In courage of advocacy and\r\nthoroughness of view, no woman except Frances Wright is to be compared\r\nwith her; and only one, whose name is an affectionate household word\r\nin our land (greater, indeed, in order of power), resembles Mrs.\r\nMartin in largeness and sameness of speculation, and the capacity to\r\ntreat womanly and social questions. Mrs. Martin had a strength of will\r\nwhich rules in all spheres, but ever chastened by womanly feeling. Her\r\naffectionate nature as much astonished those who knew her in private,\r\nas her resolution often astonished those who knew her in public.\r\nIndeed, she was the most womanly woman of all the advocates of \"Woman's\r\nRights.\" Her assertion of her claim to interfere in public affairs\r\nwas but a means of winning security from outrage for the domestic\r\naffections. She would send the mother into the world--not in the\r\ndesertion of motherly duties, but to learn there what motherly duties\r\nare--not to submit in ignorance to suckle slaves, but to learn how to\r\nrear free men and intelligent and pure women.\"\r\n\r\nWe have copied thus much of the _Leader's_ obituary of Mrs. Martin,\r\nbecause a certain unpremeditated boldness in it admits the reader to\r\ninstructive facts in the theory and practice of the party to which she\r\nbelonged.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYAR MOHAMMED, the celebrated Vizier of Herat, is reported to have died\r\non the 4th June last. He was one of the most intriguing princes in\r\nAsia. Everybody must remember him during the few years which preceded\r\nthe occupation of Affghanistan by the English. He always managed to\r\nkeep on the friendliest terms with them and more than one mission was\r\nsent to his court from India.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe well-known composer of ballads, &c., ALEXANDER LEE, died near\r\nLondon, suddenly on the 8th of October. He was a son of the once\r\nnotorious boxer, Henry Lee, and was married to the late popular singer,\r\nMrs. Waylett. He at one period was lessee of Drury Lane Theatre, in\r\npartnership with Captain Polhill. He had been Musical Director of the\r\nOlympic and Strand Theatres, of Vauxhall Gardens, &c. He wrote the\r\nmusic for the _Invincibles_, which had such a run, with Madame Vestris\r\nin the chief part, at Covent Garden, and afterwards at the American\r\nTheatres. To name his ballads would occupy a large space, for a more\r\nprolific song-writer never existed. We may mention, however, amongst\r\nhis works, _The Soldier's Tear_; _Away, away to the mountain's brow_;\r\n_Come where the aspens quiver_; _I'll be no submissive wife_; _Rise,\r\ngentle moon_; _Kate Kearney_; _Come dwell with me_; _Pretty star of\r\nnight_; _I've plucked the fairest flower_; _Bird of love_; _Meet me in\r\nthe willow glen_; _I'm o'er young to marry yet_; _Wha wad na fight for\r\nCharlie_; _When the dew is on the grass_; _Down where the blue bells_,\r\n&c. Many of these compositions will perpetuate the name of Alexander\r\nLee as a composer of the English school of simple and unaffected\r\nmelody. We are inclined to believe, more of his songs than those of any\r\nother composer are known in the United States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPRINCE FREDERICK WILLIAM CHARLES, OF PRUSSIA, died at Berlin on the\r\n28th September. He was a brother of the late Frederick William the\r\nThird, uncle of the present King, and the youngest legitimate son of\r\nFrederick William the Second. He was born at Potsdam on the 3d of July,\r\n1783. He served actively in the army during the war with France, which\r\nterminated so disastrously at the battle of Jena. He was also present\r\nat the battles of Katzbach and Leipsic, and subsequently at Waterloo\r\ncommanded the reserve cavalry of the fourth corps of the Prussians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGentlemen's and Ladies' Fashions for December.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the fashionable world of this country we have at length the\r\nlong-expected \"hat of the future,\" from the ingenious artist GENIN,\r\nwho appears to be the only American who brings to the manufacture of\r\nhats an inventive faculty. It is likely that these hats will gradually\r\ntake the place of the funnel and stove-pipe styles which have been so\r\nlong in vogue. They are made of fine material, are light, pliable,\r\ndurable, and have the more important merit of elegant and picturesque\r\nappearance. They are indifferently styled the _Union Hat_, and the\r\n_Grandison Hat_--the last name referring to the ideal of Queen Anne's\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is much doubted whether any of the changes made in gentlemen's\r\ncostume in the last half century are improvements, and there are very\r\nfew persons of taste who will approve the hat of the last few years\r\nmore than that worn in the good old times of General Washington, when\r\nthe three-cornered chapeau began to give place to such hats its are\r\nrepresented in our illustration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe next is somewhat more in vogue, at least for younger men, and\r\nfor the opera and the theatre. It sets off a fine-looking face\r\nadvantageously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe last is better suited for travelling or hunting.\r\n\r\nIn Ladies' Fashions, there are some novelties, though comparatively\r\nfew of a kind to attract a large degree of attention. We select for\r\nillustration in the first place--\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_Close Under-sleeve._--This sleeve will be found to be of a very\r\ndesirable form by ladies who object to the open sleeves, as it combines\r\nthe elegant effect of the latter with the comfort of the close sleeve.\r\nIt may be made either in muslin or net, and is cut as a bishop's\r\nsleeve, the fulness being confined on a band at the wrist. Two broad\r\nfrills of lace or needlework are attached to the lower part of the\r\nsleeve. These frills are open in front of the arm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_Under-sleeve of Lace._--This sleeve is intended to be worn for evening\r\ndress. The double row of vandyked lace forming the trimming should drop\r\nbelow the sleeve of the dress, under which the lace sleeve is to be\r\nworn.\r\n\r\nAmong the most striking and beautiful articles in the way of Mantillas,\r\nis the _Talma_, represented in the following engraving. The capuche\r\nis formed on the model of those worn by the celebrated monks of St.\r\nFrancis, and the _tout ensemble_ is very graceful and beautiful. The\r\nentire design is very well exhibited in the illustration. The Talmas\r\nare made of velvet, silk, satin, and fine cloth. They have been\r\nintroduced in New-York by Mr. Bulpin, of Broadway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe jacket and waistcoat described in our last have a certain currency,\r\nbut are not likely to be universally adopted. The above costumes, from\r\nthe latest _modes_ received from Paris, are in the main conservative,\r\nand the engraving is so distinctive that the figures scarcely need\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nBlack now becomes indispensable in the toilettes of ladies of fashion;\r\nformerly it was exclusively reserved for days of mourning, A black\r\ndress does not interfere with the robes of varied colors, and the\r\nmaterials are rich and in good taste. Jet, in fringes or lace, is worn\r\nwith all materials. Upon moire or satin, deep flounces of chantilly or\r\n_ruches_ of lace, placed _en tablier_, are much worn; taffetas flounces\r\nare cut and stamped in patterns, or covered with narrow velvets\r\nimitating embroidery. For mantelets, and every species of outside\r\ngarments, black will more generally perhaps than ever before prevail;\r\nand rich furs will have their old prominence for trimming, particularly\r\nfor garments of velvet. Fine and heavy plushes are also being rather\r\nlargely manufactured for such purposes.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely any change perceptible in the shape of bonnets, most\r\nof the new ones being of the form which has been generally worn for\r\nsome time; yet there is a slight modification of that shape in bonnets\r\nmade expressly for the winter. The front is somewhat less wide and\r\nopen, and the bavolet, being rather narrower, droops less at the back\r\nof the head. Of the various materials likely to be employed for bonnets\r\nduring the coming winter, none will be more fashionable than velvet.\r\nAmong the velvet bonnets we notice one of violet-colored velvet trimmed\r\nwith bows of the same, intermingled with black lace and jet beads. The\r\ninside trimming consists of velvet pansies, of the natural color of\r\nthe flowers, having yellow centres. With the flowers are combined a\r\nfew loops of velvet ribbon of a rich yellow tint, matching the centre\r\nof the flowers. Another bonnet, composed of dark blue therry velvet,\r\nis trimmed with ribbon, striped with blue and orange. This bonnet is\r\nornamented in the inside with white flowers.\r\n\r\nA Russian winter riding habit is described as very simple but costly,\r\nhaving a bonnet or hat of sables or other furs, setting on the head\r\nvery much like a chancellor's full wig, and secured by a richly gemmed\r\nbracelet under the chin. The close coat, and light and flowing mantle\r\nnearly concealing it, are of black or other dark-colored velvet. This\r\nwill be in vogue probably only in the intensest severity of the cold\r\nseason. Black cloth, embroidered, is used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Transcriber's Notes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Simple spelling, grammar, and typographical errors\r\n    were corrected.\r\n\r\n    Italics markup is enclosed in _underscores_.\r\n\r\n    Greek text has been transliterated and enclosed in #number signs#.\r\n\r\n    On p. 683 the author's name is given as Pisistratus Caxton.\r\n    However, the contents list the author as Sir Edward Bulwer\r\n    Lytton.
