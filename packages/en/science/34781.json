The Author has used various resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia:\r\n\r\n\"DR JOHN ALBERT LEACH (19 March 1870 - 3 October 1929) was an\r\nornithologist, teacher and headmaster in the state of Victoria,\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nLeach was born in Ballarat, Victoria and educated at Creswick Grammar\r\nSchool (where he was dux), Melbourne Training College (1890) and the\r\nUniversity of Melbourne, where he graduated B.Sc. in 1904, M.Sc. in\r\n1906 and in 1912 obtained his doctorate for research in ornithology.\r\n\r\nLeach was a regular writer and broadcaster on natural history subjects\r\nand introduced it into the school curriculum. He was President of the\r\nRoyal Australasian Ornithologists Union (RAOU) 1922-1924 and Editor of\r\nits journal The Emu 1914-1924 and 1928-1929. He was a member of the\r\nBritish Ornithologists Union and a corresponding fellow of the\r\nAmerican Ornithologists Union. Leach was also member of the Field\r\nNaturalists Club of Victoria. He was instrumental in founding the\r\nGould League of Bird Lovers in 1909 with Jessie McMichael. He is best\r\nknown as the author of An Australian Bird Book, the first edition of\r\nwhich was published in 1911, and of Australian Nature Studies in 1922.\r\nHe also part-authored a series of Federal Geography books, and worked\r\non the Official Checklist of the Birds of Australia second and revised\r\nedition, published by the RAOU in September 1926.\r\n\r\nLeach had been preparing two books before his death, one of these was\r\na collection of weekly radio broadcasts he made on 3LO in the mid\r\n1920s....\r\n\r\nAmong his contributions to ornithology was the relationship between\r\nthe Australian Magpie, butcherbirds and currawongs in the family\r\nCracticidae, now sunk as a subfamily into Artamidae.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book is a field guide. The pages were divided vertically, with\r\nthe tabular matter on the top half, and the Lecture on the bottom half\r\nof the page.\r\n\r\nThe ebook has been re-arranged so that the separate parts have a\r\nsmoother flow. The top parts of the pages have been left intact, but\r\nthe bottom parts have been collected together and moved, so that the\r\nLecture text for each ORDER precedes the tabular listing and\r\ndescriptions for that ORDER.\r\n\r\nThe only exception is for ORDER XXI.\r\n\r\nORDER XXI.--Perching-Birds--contains 11,500 species, more than\r\nthree-fifths of the world's 19,000 birds. It has been arranged into\r\nsets of suitable groups of FAMILIES, to make it easier to access.\r\n\r\n==== has been used to separate the Lecture from the Tabular matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom \"PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.\":\r\n\r\n\"In response to requests from beginners, a table has been added on\r\npage 190. This table shows the page on which a bird of a certain size\r\nmay be found.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the page numbers are an integral part of the field guide, and\r\nnecessary for the identification of birds seen in the field, in flight,\r\nor found dead, they have been inserted into the tabular section, as\r\n[Page xx].\r\n\r\nSometimes a page has contained the end entries of one ORDER, or one\r\nFamily, and the beginning entries of the next. In these few instances\r\n(e.g. [Page 18a] and [Page 18b]; [Page 188a] and [Page 188b]), it may\r\nbe necessary for the reader to search both sections of the page.\r\n\r\nFor birds mentioned in the Lecture, it would be necessary to search by\r\nbird name.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAMES RECENTLY AMENDED (located after the INTRODUCTION).\r\n\r\nIt seems important to have these new names available, so they have\r\nbeen added to (e.g.)\r\n\r\n=20 Slate-breasted Rail= ....\r\n\r\nas [~20 _Rallus pectoralis._]\r\n\r\nso:\r\n\r\n=20 Slate-breasted Rail= (Short-toed), Lewin Water-Rail,\r\n    _Eulabeornis (Hypotaenidia) brachypus_, A., T., Auckland Is.\r\n    =vt.

Rural sights to them had hitherto been sights of trim meadows\r\nbordered by neat hedgerows, of well-cultivated fields and comfortable\r\nfarmsteads, or of stately homes set in fair gardens and far-reaching\r\nparks of magnificently-spreading trees. What wonder, then, that they\r\nwere at first almost repelled by the strangeness and unfamiliarity\r\nof their new surroundings! How could eyes accustomed to the decided\r\ngreens and to the somewhat monotonous shapeliness of the trees in\r\nan English summer landscape find beauty all at once in the delicate,\r\nelusive tints of the gum trees, or in the wonderfully decorative lines\r\nof their scanty boughs and light foliage shown clear against a bright\r\nsky? And so a land which is eminently a land of color, where\r\nthe ever-present eucalypts give in their leaves every shade from\r\nblue-grays to darkest greens; where the tender shoots show brilliantly\r\nin bright crimson, or duller russets, or bright coppery-gold;\r\nand where tall, slender stems change slowly through a harmony of\r\nsalmon-pinks and pearl-grays, has been called a drab-colored land.\r\nEven now, the beauty of the gum tree is not sufficiently appreciated\r\nby Australians, and we see all too few specimens in our suburban\r\ngardens. For an appreciation of the decorative effect of our young\r\nblue gums, we must go to the Riviera or to English conservatories.\r\n\r\nAustralia has suffered greatly from phrase-makers. There is still much\r\npopular belief that our trees are shadeless, our rivers are waterless,\r\nour flowers are scentless, our birds are songless. Oddities in our\r\nflora and fauna have attracted the notice of superficial observers,\r\nand a preference for epigrammatic perfection, rather than for\r\ntruthful generalization, has produced an abundance of neatly-expressed\r\nhalf-truths, which have been copied into popular literature, and even\r\ninto school books. Our English-bred poet, Gordon, writes of lands--\r\n\r\n  \"Where bright blossoms are scentless,\r\n  And songless, bright birds.\"\r\n\r\nand these lines are remembered better than his description in the same\r\npoem of Spring--\r\n\r\n  \"When the wattle gold trembles\r\n    'Twixt shadow and shine,\r\n  When each dew-laden air draught resembles\r\n    A long draught of wine.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true that we have scentless, bright blossoms; but Australia\r\nis the home of the richly-perfumed wattle, and the boronia, with\r\nits never-cloying fragrance; while there is, perhaps, no forest more\r\nodorous than a forest of eucalypts. It is true, too, that we have\r\nbright birds that have no excellence in song; but it is also true\r\nthat, in this favored land, there is a far greater proportion than\r\nusual of fine song-birds.\r\n\r\nThe first generations of Australians were not taught to love\r\nAustralian things. We \"learned from our wistful mothers to call Old\r\nEngland home.\" Our school books and our story books were made in Great\r\nBritain for British boys and girls, and naturally they stressed what\r\nwas of interest to these boys and girls. We read much about the beauty\r\nof the songs of the Lark, and the Thrush, and the Nightingale, but we\r\nfound no printed authority for the belief that our Magpie is one of\r\nthe great song-birds of the world; we read of the wonderful powers\r\nof the American Mocking-Bird, and did not know that our beautiful\r\nLyrebird is a finer mimic; we learned by heart Barry Cornwall's\r\nwell-known poem on \"The Storm Petrel,\" and did not know that one of\r\nthe most interesting of Petrel rookeries is near the harbor gate\r\nof Melbourne; and I remember well a lesson I heard as a boy on the\r\nmigration of birds, in which the teacher took all of his illustrations\r\nfrom his boyish experiences in the South of England, and gave us no\r\nidea that the annual migration of our familiar Australian birds to\r\nfar-off Siberia is a much more wonderful thing.\r\n\r\nBut all this is being rapidly changed. In the elementary schools\r\nNature-study is steadily improving, and children are being given an\r\neye for, and an interest in, the world of Nature around them. Our\r\nschool books are now written from the Australian standpoint, and more\r\nuse can, therefore, be made of the child's everyday experience. Field\r\nNaturalists' clubs are doing much to extend the area of specialized\r\nNature-study, and their members are giving valuable assistance to the\r\nschools by taking part in the programs for Arbor Day, Bird Day, and\r\nthe like. The growing interest in the Australian fauna and flora\r\nis further evidenced by the frequent reservations by Government of\r\ndesirable areas as national parks and sanctuaries for the preservation\r\nof Australian types. Last, but not least, is the production by capable\r\nNature students of special books on some form of Nature-study, such as\r\nthis Bird Book by Mr. Leach.\r\n\r\nTo our parents, Australia was a stranger land, and they were\r\nsojourners here. Though they lived here, they did not get close enough\r\nto it to appreciate fully its natural beauty and its charm. To us,\r\nand especially to our children, children of Australian-born parents,\r\nchildren whose bones were made in Australia, the place is home. To\r\nthem Nature makes a direct appeal, strengthened by those most powerful\r\nof all associations, those gathered in childhood, when the foundations\r\nof their minds were laid. The English boy, out on a breezy down, may\r\nfeel an exaltation of soul on hearing a Skylark raining down a flood\r\nof delicious melody from far up at heaven's gate, but his joy is no\r\nwhit greater than his who hears, in the dewy freshness of the early\r\nmorning, the carol of the Magpie ringing out over an Australian plain.\r\nTo those who live in countries where the winter is long and bitter,\r\nany sign that the genial time of flowers is at hand is very welcome.\r\nAll over the countryside the first call of the Cuckoo, spring's\r\nharbinger, arouses the keenest delight in expectant listeners. This\r\ndelight is, however, more than mere delight in the bird's song. And to\r\nthose brought up with it year by year there comes a time when the call\r\nof the Cuckoo stirs something deep down below the surface of ordinary\r\nemotion. It is the resultant of multitudes of childhood experiences\r\nand of associations with song and story. I first heard the Cuckoo in\r\nEpping Forest one delicious May evening four years ago. It charmed me,\r\nbut my delight was almost wholly that of association. All the English\r\npoetry I knew was at the back of the bird's song. Here in Australia\r\nwe have no sharply-defined seasons, yet I find myself every spring\r\nlistening eagerly for the first plaintive, insistent call of the\r\nPallid Cuckoo. For me his song marks another milestone passed.\r\n\r\nMarcus Clarke wrote of the Laughing Jackasses as bursting into\r\n\"horrible peals of semi-human laughter.\" But then Marcus Clarke was\r\nEnglish-bred, and did not come to Australia till he was eighteen years\r\nold. It makes all the difference in our appreciation of bird or tree\r\nor flower to have known it as a boy. I venture to think no latter-day\r\nAustralian who has grown up with our Kookaburra can have any but\r\nthe kindliest of feelings for this feathered comedian. For myself, I\r\nconfess that I find his laughter infectious, and innumerable times he\r\nhas provoked me into an outburst as hearty and as mirthful as his own.\r\nMore than half of our pleasure is due to the fact that the bird is\r\n\r\n  \"The same that in my schoolboy days I listened to.\"\r\n\r\nand to such a one we can say--\r\n\r\n  \"I can listen to thee yet,\r\n    Can lie upon the plain\r\n  And listen, till I do beget\r\n    That golden time again.\"\r\n\r\nIt is time that we Australians fought against the generally received\r\nopinion that the dominant note of our scenery is weird melancholy.\r\nThis is the note sounded mainly by those who were bred elsewhere, who\r\ncame to us with other associations and other traditions, and sojourned\r\namong us. It will not be the opinion of the native-born when they find\r\nappropriate speech.\r\n\r\n  \"Whence doth the mournful keynote start?\r\n  From the pure depths of Nature's heart?\r\n  Or, from the heart of him who sings,\r\n  And deems his hand upon the strings,\r\n      Is Nature's own?\"\r\n\r\nThis little book should do much to popularize bird-study and to spread\r\na knowledge of our common birds among our people. I hope devoutly that\r\nan effort will be made to give them suitable names. We should give\r\nthem names a poet or a child can use. A Chaucer poring lovingly over\r\nhis favorite flower, the daisy, could call it by a name which is\r\nitself full of poetry. Even the unimaginative clown, Nick Bottom,\r\ncould sing of\r\n\r\n  \"The Ouzel Cock, so black of hue,\r\n    With orange-tawny bill,\r\n  The Throstle with his note so true,\r\n    The Wren with little quill,\r\n  The Finch, the Sparrow, and the Lark,\r\n    The plain-song Cuckoo gray.\"\r\n\r\nAnd a Burns can invoke the Throstle in lines as musical as the song of\r\nthe bird itself--\"And thou mellow mavis, that hails the night-fa'.\"\r\n\r\nBut how shall an Australian bard sing of \"The Red-rumped Acanthiza,\"\r\nor of that delightful songster, \"The Rufous-breasted Thickhead\"?\r\nAustralian Nature-poetry will be handicapped until our children give\r\nnames like \"Bobolink,\" and \"Chickadee,\" and \"Whip-poor-will,\" and\r\n\"Jacky Winter,\" to our birds.\r\n\r\n\"Oriel,\" in the _Argus_, some time ago, showed how hard it is to write\r\nof love's young dream in Australian verse.\r\n\r\n  \"Sweetheart, we watched the evening sky grow pale,\r\n    And drowsy sweetness stole away our senses,\r\n  While ran adown the swamp the Pectoral Rail,\r\n    The shy Hypotaenidia philippinensis.\r\n\r\n  \"How sweet a thing is love! Sweet as the rose,\r\n    Fragrant as flowers, fair as the sunlight beaming!\r\n  Only the Sooty Oyster-Catcher knows\r\n    How sweet to us, as there we lingered dreaming.\r\n\r\n  \"Dear, all the secret's ours. The Sharp-tailed Stint\r\n    Spied, but he will not tell--though you and I\r\n  Paid Cupid's debts from Love's own golden mint,\r\n    While Yellow-Bellied Shrike-Tits fluttered nigh.\r\n\r\n  \"The Honey-eaters heard; the Fuscous--yea,\r\n    The Warty-faced, the Lunulated, too;\r\n  But this kind feathered tribe will never say\r\n    What words you said to me, or I to you.\r\n\r\n  \"The golden bloom was glorious in the furze,\r\n    And gentle twittering came from out the copses;\r\n  It was the Carinated Flycatchers,\r\n    Or else the black Monarcha melanopsis.\r\n\r\n  \"That day our troth we plighted--blissful hour,\r\n    Beginning of a joy a whole life long!\r\n  And while the wide world seemed to be in flower,\r\n    The Chestnut-rumped Ground-Wren burst forth in song.\"\r\n\r\nIt surely would not be amiss if the Bird Observers' Clubs throughout\r\nAustralia, and the Royal Australasian Ornithologists' Union, enlisted\r\nthe aid of the State Education Departments, and endeavored to find out\r\nwhat names the children use for the birds of their district. Executive\r\ncommittees upon bird names are good; but a good name is not evoked by\r\narguments in committee. It ofttimes comes from the happy inspiration\r\nof some child who loves the bird. At present the names given by\r\nclassifiers are often an offence. A few evenings ago I was charmed\r\nwith an unaccustomed song coming from out a big pittosporum tree in\r\nmy garden at Kew. I took careful note of the little warbler, and then\r\nconsulted Mr. Leach's _Descriptive List_. Judge of my satisfaction\r\nwhen I found that my little friend was \"The Striated Field Wren or\r\nStink Bird\"!\r\n\r\nThe Australian boy is responding splendidly to the Nature-study\r\nmovement. Bird observers tell me that shy native birds, formerly\r\nunknown near the haunts of men, are making their appearance,\r\nfeeling safer now from molestation. Nest hunting for the sake of egg\r\nspoliation is happily becoming rarer, although children are developing\r\nkeener eyes for nests. To-day every country school has its nests\r\nunder loving observation for the purposes of bird-study and of\r\nbird-protection. Walt Whitman might have been describing many a\r\nVictorian school boy when he wrote--\r\n\r\n  \"And every day the he-bird, to and fro, near at hand,\r\n  And every day the she-bird, crouched on her nest, silent, with bright eyes,\r\n  And every day, I, a curious boy, never too close, never disturbing them,\r\n  Cautiously peering, absorbing, translating.\"\r\n\r\nThis loving study must bear good fruit. If we believe the scientific\r\nmen, Australia is, _par excellence_, the land of birds, song-birds,\r\nplumage-birds, and birds of wonderful interest, such as the Satin\r\nBower Bird. The collection of Australian birds in our National Museum\r\nat Melbourne is certainly one of the finest sights of the city, and it\r\nshould be studied by all who wish to know how favored this continent\r\nis in bird distribution. But we must get to know and to love our\r\nfeathered friends. Mr. Leach in his lecture has dwelt sufficiently on\r\nthe economic and scientific value of bird-study. Let me enter a plea\r\nfor bird-study as a source of aesthetic pleasure. Before our Australian\r\nbirds can be to us what the Thrush and the Blackbird and the Linnet\r\nand the Lark and the Nightingale are to the British boy, we must have\r\na wealth of association around them from song and story. And this\r\nassociation must grow up with us from childhood if it is to make\r\nthe strongest appeal to us. It can rarely be acquired in later life.\r\nBritish birds owe much to the poets for the charm that surrounds them.\r\nWhen I heard the Nightingale in England, although I had no association\r\nwith it gathered from my boyhood's days, I heard more than the bird's\r\nsong. I was listening to Keats and Wordsworth and Shakespeare as well.\r\nThere is something very fine in the thought that such bird songs go on\r\nfor ever, that these immortal birds are \"not made for death,\" that\r\n\r\n  \"The voice I hear this passing night was heard\r\n  In ancient days by emperor and clown:\r\n  Perhaps the self-same song that found a path\r\n  Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,\r\n  She stood in tears amid the alien corn.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nightingale's song, as a bird song, I thought disappointing.\r\nI remember having the same feeling with regard to the Thrush and\r\nBlackbird. The charm of their songs is largely in the associations\r\nthey evoke. Our city children are now growing up in familiarity with\r\nthese two birds, which are becoming as common in our gardens as in\r\nEngland. And wherever they go they carry so much that is fine in\r\nliterature with them. But there has not yet been time for our native\r\nbirds to endear themselves to us. And so we hear only their song. Wise\r\nShakespeare says--\r\n\r\n  \"How many things by season seasoned are\r\n  To their right praise and true perfection.\"\r\n\r\n *      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n  \"The Nightingale, if she should sing by day,\r\n  When every goose is cackling, would be thought\r\n  No better a musician than the Wren.\"\r\n\r\nHe knows that to the song of the bird must be its appropriate setting,\r\nand that when Nature has done her part there is still much to be\r\nsupplied by ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe outlook is, however, a hopeful one. Nature-study is bringing our\r\nboys and girls into kindlier relationships with our birds; suitable\r\npopular names will be forthcoming for them; our poets will sing of\r\nthem; our nursery rhymes and our children's tales will tell of them;\r\nand the time will come when even the birds now trying so hard to\r\nsing their way into our hearts, while cursed with the names of\r\n\"Rufous-breasted Thickhead\" and \"Striated Field Wren or Stink Bird,\"\r\nwill mean to an Australian what \"the Throstle with his note so true\"\r\nand \"the Wren with little quill\" do to an Englishman.\r\n\r\nMr. Leach's valuable little book is a powerful contribution to this\r\nmuch-to-be-desired result.\r\n\r\n  FRANK TATE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAMES RECENTLY AMENDED\r\n\r\nBy Gregory Mathews.\r\n\r\n_The following were not included in the text._\r\n\r\nThe numbers 70, 74, and so on refer to the numbers of the birds.\r\n\r\n   20 _Rallus pectoralis._\r\n   65-66 _Genus Thalasseus._\r\n   70 _Sterna fuscata._\r\n   74 _Catharacta._\r\n   75 _Catharacta parasitica._\r\n   76 _Morinella interpres._\r\n   80 _Lobibyx novae hollandiae._\r\n   82 _Squatarola squatarola._\r\n   83-89 _Genus Charadrius._\r\n   90 _Hypsibates_\r\n   95 _Numenius minutus._\r\n   96 _Limosa baueri._\r\n   97 _Limosa melanuroides._\r\n   98 _Tringa hypoleuca._\r\n   99 _Tringa nebularia._\r\n  100 _Arenaria leucophaea._\r\n  101 _Erolia ruficollis._\r\n  102 _Erolia aurita._\r\n  103 _Erolia ferruginea._\r\n  104 _Canutus canutus._\r\n  105 _Canutus magnus._\r\n  110 _Choriotis australis._\r\n  111 _Mathewsia rubicunda._\r\n  114 _Egatheus falcinellus._\r\n  117 _Egretta plumifera._\r\n  118 _Egretta timoriensis._\r\n  121 _Egretta nigripes._\r\n  122 _Demigretta sacra._\r\n  124 _Ixobrychus pusillus._\r\n  126 _Chenopis atrata._\r\n  132 _Tadorna tadornoides._\r\n  134 _Nettion castaneum._\r\n  139 _Nyroca australis._\r\n  140 _Oxyura australis._\r\n  142-146 _Genus, Carbo._\r\n  157 _Astur cirrhocephalus._\r\n  171 _Ieracidea berigora._\r\n  172 _Ieracidea orientalis._\r\n  179-183 _Genus, Tyto._\r\n  185-187 _Genus, Glossopsitta._\r\n  191 _Genus, Callocephalon._\r\n  192-194 _Genus, Cacatoees._\r\n  195 _Licmetis tenuirostris._\r\n  196 _Calopsitta novae-hollandiae._\r\n  198 _Polytelis anthopeplus._\r\n  208 _Neophema chrysostoma._\r\n  213 _Lathamus discolor._\r\n  225 _Eurostopodus albigularis._\r\n  228 _Apus pacificus._\r\n  229 _Cuculus pallidus._\r\n  232 _Misocalius palliolatus._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis little volume is intended as a pocket book for field use, so\r\nthat the many teachers, nature-students, nature-lovers, schoolboys,\r\nschoolgirls, and boy scouts, who like to \"_see_ what they _look at_,\"\r\nmay be able to name the birds they meet.\r\n\r\nThe first step towards knowing the birds is a _desire_ to know them;\r\nthis will grow if a person is interested; so our first business, as\r\nin all nature-study work, is to arouse _interest_. Interest follows at\r\nonce, as we have often found, if a person realizes that what is about\r\nhim or her is worthy of study.\r\n\r\nTo arouse this necessary interest, a lecture on Australian birds is\r\ngiven in such a form that it may be repeated, if desired.\r\n\r\nThe second requisite is a handy descriptive list of the birds that are\r\nlikely to be seen. This has been written in simple language, so that\r\nthe schoolboy and non-expert can use it.\r\n\r\nThus, our aims are two:--\r\n\r\n    1. To show that Australian birds are of interest.\r\n\r\n    2. To supply, in a convenient form, a list of the birds which\r\n    are likely to be seen, and the marks by means of which they\r\n    may be identified.\r\n\r\nThis little book contains illustrations and descriptions of--\r\n\r\n  100% of the birds found in Victoria.\r\n  92.5% .. .. .. .. .. .. .. South Australia.\r\n  87.3% .. .. .. .. .. .. .. Tasmania.\r\n  82.5% .. .. .. .. .. .. .. New South Wales.\r\n  78.16%.. .. .. .. .. .. .. W. Australia (S. and C.).\r\n  78.15%.. .. .. .. .. .. .. Queensland.\r\n\r\nThe balance of those found in each of the other States is made up\r\nmainly of birds closely related to those of which illustrations are\r\ngiven, or of very rare birds restricted to a small area.\r\n\r\nThe families of the birds of the world have been included, so that the\r\nobserver can see where the bird he is observing is placed amongst the\r\nworld's birds. He will also be enabled to place near its Australian\r\nrelatives birds he reads about. The Australian birds only are grouped\r\nin orders.\r\n\r\nMr. H. Wilson, Nature-study Lecturer, Training College, superintended\r\nthe painting of the birds, and saw the book through the press.\r\n\r\n_A Hand-List of Birds_: Dr. Sharpe; and _A Hand-List of the Birds\r\nof Australasia_: Gregory M. Mathews, have been followed for\r\nclassification and distribution.\r\n\r\nBut for the interest of the Minister of Education, the Hon. A. A.\r\nBillson, and the Director, Mr. F. Tate, M.A., I.S.O., this little\r\nbook would not have been possible. Further, Mr. Billson suggested the\r\ncolored illustrations, while Mr. Tate has written the introduction,\r\nread the proof-sheets and assisted at all stages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn response to requests from beginners, a table has been added on page\r\n190. This table shows the page on which a bird of a certain size may\r\nbe found.\r\n\r\nPending the completion by the Royal Australasian Ornithologists' Union\r\nof its official _Check-list of the Birds of Australia_, the scientific\r\nnames have been left as in the first edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\nWhere one number is placed over another at the left side of the page,\r\nthe lower number denotes the number of species of that genus found in\r\nthe world; the upper denotes the number of species found in Australia\r\nand Tasmania.\r\n\r\nThe number at the right side of the page is the length of the bird in\r\ninches (from the tip of bill to the tip of tail).\r\n\r\nThe families of birds known are numbered consecutively, thus, F. 11,\r\nF. 12, and so on. The number after a family name denotes the number of\r\nspecies recorded from Australia and Tasmania. The distribution of\r\nthe species of each family amongst the six zoogeographical regions is\r\nshown thus:\r\n\r\n    F. 17. COLUMBIDAE (2), WOOD PIGEONS, Passenger-Pigeon, Rock-Dove,\r\n    119 sp.--41(40)A., 25(17)O., 18(10)P., 19(17)E., 4(0)Nc., 24(20)Nl.\r\n\r\nThis should read: Family number 17 of the world's birds, COLUMBIDAE\r\n(two of which are found in Australia and Tasmania) contains the Wood\r\nPigeons, including the Passenger-Pigeon (of North America) and the\r\nRock-Dove (of Europe). It comprises 119 species, of which 41 are found\r\nin the Australian Region, 40 of them being confined to this region;\r\n25 are found in the Oriental Region, 17 being confined to it; 18 are\r\nfound in the Palaearctic Region, 10 of which are not found outside\r\nthe region; 19 have been recorded from the Ethiopian Region, 17\r\nbeing peculiar to that region; 4 have been recorded from the Nearctic\r\nRegion, none of which is restricted to the region; 24 have been\r\nrecorded from the Neotropical Region, 20 being peculiar to it.\r\n\r\nThe name in black type is the name accepted by the Australasian\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science in 1898, and amended by the\r\n\"names\" sub-committee of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists' Union,\r\n1911.

Thus there are herbivorous, carnivorous, and insectivorous\r\nmarsupials. Owing, probably, to the advent of Bats--true flying\r\nmammals--at, possibly, a comparatively early time, the marsupial was\r\nbeaten in the air, and so a true flying form was not evolved, though\r\nthe so-called \"Flying Phalanger\" is some distance on the way.\r\n\r\nAs regards the other group of flying animals--birds--Australia is even\r\nof greater interest, for here are found unique archaic forms of life,\r\nsuch as the Emu, Cassowary, Mound-Builders, and Lyre-Birds, and\r\n\"every widely-spread family of birds but two is represented; the only\r\nwidely-spread families of birds totally absent from Australia\r\nare Woodpeckers and Vultures.\" Woodpeckers, however, have crossed\r\nWallace's line into Celebes and adjacent islands, and may yet reach\r\nAustralia naturally.\r\n\r\nFurther, many well-known birds, such as Pigeons, Parrots, and\r\nKingfishers, reach their highest development in the Australian region,\r\nand, more important still, the whole bird world seems to reach its\r\nculminating point in this wonderland. It is a factor adding to the\r\ninterest of Australia's fauna that three of the four families placed\r\nat the head of the bird world in the natural system of classification\r\nadopted by ornithologists, and used by Dr. Sharpe in his just recently\r\ncompleted _Hand-List of Birds_, should be absolutely confined to the\r\nAustralian Continent and adjacent islands. Thus Australia can justly\r\nclaim to be the most highly developed of regions, so far as birds\r\nare concerned, for Bower-Birds, Birds of Paradise, and Bell-Magpies\r\n(_Streperas_) are peculiar, while the penultimate family--the Crow\r\nfamily--is shared with the other regions of the world.\r\n\r\nThus, with regard to birds, the term \"fossil continent\" applied to\r\nAustralia is not appropriate, as it is but partly true.\r\n\r\nSince the birds native to Australia are so interesting in themselves,\r\nand are so varied in kind, Australians should know, love, and\r\njealously protect these beautiful creatures. Strict regulations should\r\nbe framed to prevent the exploitation of Nature's gifts by those who\r\ndestroy useful or precious and rare birds for the sake of gain. Even\r\ncollectors, who, under the guise of scientific work, collect eggs, and\r\nkill birds to trade in their skins, should be supervized.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the different groups of birds. Living birds were\r\nformerly divided into two sub-classes--(1) _Ratitae_ (Lat., _ratis_, a\r\nraft), and (2) _Carinatae_ (Lat., _carina_, a keel). The first is\r\nthe small group of flightless, running birds, made up of five living\r\nbirds, all inhabiting southern lands. These are the Emu and Cassowary\r\nof Australia, the Ostrich of South Africa, the Rhea or South American\r\nOstrich, and the Kiwi or Apteryx of New Zealand. Taken together with\r\nother evidence, all pointing in the same way, these birds have led\r\nscientists to think of a great southern land mass connecting the\r\nsouthern lands, for the Emu did not fly here, nor did the Rhea fly\r\nto South America, but they must have reached their present home by a\r\nland-bridge not necessarily complete at any one time. As these birds\r\ndo not fly, they have no big wing-muscles, and so do not need the\r\nridge of bone down the breast. Thus they belong to the sub-class, the\r\nmembers of which have a raft-like breast bone. The other living birds\r\nwere placed in the sub-class the members of which have a keel on the\r\nbreast bone for the attachment of the wing-muscles.\r\n\r\nRecently, however, Pycraft, a leading ornithologist, has proposed to\r\nbase the division into sub-classes on the characters of the bones of\r\nthe palate instead of those of the breast-bone. Thus, he places the\r\nsixth family of birds--the Tinamous, of South America--with the ratite\r\nbirds, to form his primitive group--_Palaeognathae_ (\"old jaw\"), while\r\nthe members of the old sub-class _Carinatae_, minus the Tinamous,\r\nconstitute his second division, the _Neognathae_ (\"new jaw\").\r\n\r\nMr. Gregory Mathews, the first part of whose projected great work\r\non Australian Birds has just come to hand, has followed Dr. Bowdler\r\nSharpe in accepting this classification, so we must follow too, as\r\nMathews' work will probably be our standard for years to come. The\r\nlarge number of Australian birds belonging to this second sub-class is\r\nnow divided into 20 orders, which with the Emu order, make a total of\r\n21 orders of birds represented in Australia.\r\n\r\nNow, let us consider the birds in each order. The best-known member\r\nof the first Australian order is the Emu, a bird well known to all,\r\nthough, unfortunately, becoming very rare, so that few persons in the\r\nsettled districts now enjoy the privilege of seeing an Emu in a wild\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n  [Page 12]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]]\r\n\r\n    CLASS.--AVES.--BIRDS.\r\n\r\n    Sub-Class I.--Palaeognathae.\r\n\r\n    Ratitae and Tinamidae.\r\n\r\n    F. 1. _Rheidae_, Rhea, 3 sp.

Quail are also\r\nincluded here; so are Pheasants. The absence of Pheasants from\r\nAustralia is more than compensated for by the presence of the\r\nMound-Builders. These marvellous birds, Brush Turkeys and Mallee-Fowl,\r\nretain the reptilian characteristic of not sitting on their eggs. Thus\r\nthe young have never known their parents. The eggs are laid in a huge\r\nmound of sand and earth, which contains rotting vegetation. The\r\nheat of decomposition in this remarkable natural incubator, is quite\r\nsufficient to hatch the eggs. The young are born fully feathered, able\r\nto run at once, and able to fly the day they leave the mound. Contrast\r\ntheir stage of development with that of a pigeon born naked, blind,\r\nand helpless, and that of a chick born clothed with down and able to\r\nrun about. There is an interesting connexion between the size of\r\nan egg and the state of development of the young bird at birth. The\r\npigeon lays a relatively small egg, so the young pigeon does not\r\ndevelop far in the egg, and requires much maternal care. The hen's egg\r\nis larger, and the chick is more fully developed. The Mallee-Hen's egg\r\nis enormous, and so the young can develop much further before birth.\r\nThis bird, unfortunately, is doomed to early extinction, for the\r\nfox has discovered the rich store of food in the eggs, and country\r\ndwellers have also discovered that they are delicate in flavor, and\r\nare good food. It is hoped that the scrubby western end of Kangaroo\r\nIsland, where foxes are unknown, will prove a suitable sanctuary\r\nfor them. These birds, which rank among Nature's wonders, are almost\r\nconfined to the Australian region. One is found in Borneo and the\r\nPhilippines, while a second is confined to the distant Nicobar\r\nIslands. Twenty-six live in Australia and its neighboring islands. One\r\nof these has spread across Wallace's line to the small Kangean Island,\r\nnear Java. The Stubble Quail, a member of the Pheasant family, is\r\nnearly identical with the British Quail. Mathews and Campbell make the\r\nKing Quail a sub-species of the Chinese Quail.\r\n\r\nQuail are favorite sporting birds, but when one considers that they\r\nare worth about 9d. each as table or game birds, and that sportsmen\r\nfound at Birregurra, that the crops of Quail were full of crickets,\r\nand at Kerang the Quail contained numbers of a species of weevil, it\r\nis doubtful if it is wise policy to shoot this insect-eating bird.\r\nAlthough it may be worth a few pence as a table bird; it is worth many\r\nshillings as a pest destroyer.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n  [Page 13]\r\n\r\n    ORDER II.--GALLIFORMES.\r\n\r\n    F. 7.

Only the last species of this Bustard Quail family,\r\nthe Australian Plain Wanderer has the hind toe. The females of this\r\norder of birds do the fighting.\r\n\r\nIn Quail, the rule often observed amongst birds that the male is\r\nlarger and more beautiful than the female may be reversed, for here\r\nthe female is sometimes larger and the more conspicuously colored. In\r\nassociation with this reversal of color and size, the domestic habits\r\nare changed, for, in some species at least, the female sits on\r\nthe eggs but a very short time; the male then finishes the task of\r\nincubating, and brings up and educates the young family. Meantime, the\r\nfemale has found another mate and another clutch of eggs is left to\r\nthe care of the male.\r\n\r\nIn birds having both sexes the same color each bird usually does its\r\nshare of domestic work, sitting on the eggs, feeding the young, etc.\r\nWhere the male is more brightly colored, he, as a rule, does not\r\nsit on the eggs, for he would be visible to a bird of prey sailing\r\noverhead, and so would probably be killed and the eggs taken. The\r\ngreat naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace, thus regards the quiet\r\ncoloration of most female birds as a protection during the nesting\r\nseason. The gaudy coloration of many male birds has been explained by\r\nDarwin as being due to sexual selection, the female choosing as a mate\r\nthe most gaily colored or most attractive bird.\r\n\r\nThough the sitting bird is usually protectively colored, it was our\r\ngood fortune, on a Summer School excursion, attended by His Excellency\r\nthe Governor (Sir Thomas Gibson-Carmichael), a keen Nature-lover,\r\nand the Director of Education (Mr. F. Tate), to find the\r\ngorgeously-colored male Golden-breasted Whistler (Thickhead) sitting\r\non the eggs in full daylight. It was noted, however, that the open\r\nnest was unusually well protected by an overhead bushy branch.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n[Page 15]\r\n\r\n    ORDER III.--TURNICIFORMES, HEMIPODES.\r\n\r\n    F. 14.

The Australian region is the great stronghold of these often\r\nbeautiful birds. It is only in this region that members of each of the\r\nfive families of living Pigeons are found. Two of the five families\r\nare peculiar to the region, and nearly half the kinds of Pigeons known\r\nare found here. The finest and largest of all Pigeons are the large\r\nCrowned Pigeons of New Guinea. Unfortunately, the heads of these\r\nPigeons are much in demand for millinery. Would that fashionable women\r\nknew the cruelty and devastation wrought by such fashions!\r\n\r\nAmongst the most beautiful of Pigeons are, as Dr. Newton remarked,\r\nthe common Bronzewing Pigeons of Australia and Tasmania. The lovely\r\nFruit-Pigeons of East Australian scrubs are, perhaps, the most\r\nbeautiful of all, so it will readily be seen how fortunate we are with\r\nregard to these birds.\r\n\r\nThe fine large Wonga-Wonga Pigeon is becoming rare. Its flesh is\r\nwhite, so Gould named it _Leucosarcia_ (white flesh). It has been\r\nproposed to introduce this bird into Europe to breed for table\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n  [Page 16]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: [12] [12^A] [13] [14] [15] [16]]\r\n\r\n    ORDER IV.--COLUMBIFORMES, PIGEONS, DOVES.\r\n\r\n    F. 16.

Nl.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\nThe birds of Order V. are amongst the successes in the struggle\r\nfor existence, for they are found the world over.\r\n\r\nThe Landrailor Corn-Crake, the Little Crake, Spotted Crake, Moor-Hen,\r\nPurple Gallinule, and the lobed-toed Coot, of other countries, are\r\nrepresented by similar birds here.\r\n\r\nThey are largely swamp-dwellers, and conditions about swamps\r\napparently do not vary much from continent to continent. There is a\r\nfull supply of vegetable and animal food, and there is good shelter\r\nin the thick reed-beds. The smaller members of the family are seldom\r\nseen, for they skulk amongst the reeds, and seldom show themselves.\r\n\r\nMany of these birds are long-toed, and are beautifully adapted for\r\nlife about the soft mud and floating vegetation of lagoons and swamps.\r\nThough the feet are not webbed, several of these swamp-dwellers swim\r\nwell. Thus the Little Crake is an expert swimmer and diver.\r\n\r\nThere is one Australian bird not represented in other countries.\r\nThis is the handsome, bantam-like Black-tailed Native-Hen. At long\r\nintervals the birds appear in thousands, and, being largely vegetable\r\nfeeders, they have sometimes done considerable damage to crops.\r\n\r\nDuring one such irruption in 1846, the birds invaded the streets of\r\nAdelaide. Others invaded the Geraldton district, and even reached\r\nPerth in 1886. Northern Victoria was visited in 1909.\r\n\r\nSome of the members of this group are known to all; indeed, when you\r\nhave finished reading this lecture, I expect to have created in your\r\nmind an idea that bird study is very simple--that you know at least\r\none of each of the groups of birds. One further advantage of bird\r\nstudy is that so few birds are found in any district. Thus, only 880\r\nbirds have ever been recorded from Australia, whereas there are over\r\n9,000 kinds of native flowering plants, not to mention non-flowering\r\nplants. In very few districts could a list of 100 different kinds of\r\nbirds be compiled in one year.\r\n\r\nAgain, while it is impossible to talk popularly of native plants,\r\nbecause they have no common names, that does not apply to birds, for\r\nbird-lovers have given a simple name to each bird. Even children,\r\ntherefore, can talk definitely and exactly about the different kinds.\r\nThis is a great advantage. Again, as birds are living, moving, loving,\r\nand beautiful animals, they have always been favorite objects of\r\nstudy, and so we know more about them than about any other division of\r\nthe animal kingdom. Thus you will, I hope, find that you know far more\r\nabout the subject than you at first thought.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n  [Page 18b]\r\n\r\n    ORDER V.--RALLIFORMES.\r\n\r\n    F. 22.

Bird names often reflect some habit, e.g.,\r\nScratchers, Cooers. So Grebes are often called Divers. But the Divers\r\nof the ornithologist are Northern Hemisphere birds, placed in the next\r\nfamily (25).\r\n\r\nThere is a widespread tradition to the effect that Grebes wait for the\r\nflash of the cap, and then dive before the bullet can reach them. They\r\nare, indeed, remarkably active in the water, but are absurd on land.\r\nTheir legs are set so far back that it is almost impossible for them\r\nto walk. Their toes are not webbed, but are broadly lobed.\r\n\r\nThe Great Crested Grebe is identical with the British bird, for it is\r\nfound all through the Eastern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThis is a remarkable distribution, when we consider that the bird,\r\nby reason of its very small wings, is a poor flyer, and is almost\r\nhelpless on land. Such a wide distribution of a creature possessing\r\npoor means of locomotion indicates that the animal must have existed\r\nfor a long time, so that it has been able to gradually extend its\r\nrange. Thus we conclude it is an ancient form.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n  [Page 24]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34]]\r\n\r\n    ORDER VI.--PODICIPEDIDIFORMES.\r\n\r\n    F. 24.

As so much\r\nhas been said about Penguins by Lieutenant Shackleton's party, they\r\nhave caught the popular fancy, and people are much interested in them.\r\nMany Australians do not know that three Penguins are found on their\r\nown coast. It was one of the sights of the 1910 Summer School at\r\nPortsea to sit on the balcony and watch the Penguins chasing their\r\nprey in the clear waters in front. Their wings are paddles, being\r\nflattened and devoid of quills. The wings are not folded, but are\r\ncarried hanging awkwardly at the side.\r\n\r\nDuring the interest aroused by Peary's expedition to the North Pole,\r\nan illustrated weekly paper published a cartoon, which showed the\r\nAmerican Eagle sitting on the North Pole and reading a proclamation to\r\nan audience of Penguins. One thing is unfortunate about this--Penguins\r\nare unknown in the Northern Hemisphere. Indeed, they support the\r\ngeographer in his contention that, while the Pacific Ocean is very\r\nancient, the Atlantic Ocean has been formed much more recently, for\r\nPenguins are found up the Pacific even to the Galapagos Is. on the\r\nEquator, but have not spread into the Atlantic Ocean beyond Tristan da\r\nCunha, at the extreme South.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n  [Page 25b]\r\n\r\n    ORDER VII.--SPHENISCIFORMES.\r\n\r\n    F. 26.

Indeed, many of them do not go near\r\nland except to breed. Then they usually repair to small lonely islands\r\noften with bold precipitous shores.\r\n\r\nOcean birds are readily divisible into four families. The first\r\nis made up of the 25 Storm-Petrels; the second of the 75 Petrels,\r\nShearwaters, Fulmars, and Dove-Petrels; the third family comprises\r\nonly the three small southern Diving-Petrels; while the fourth\r\ncontains the nineteen noble Albatrosses.\r\n\r\nThough Storm-Petrels and Petrels of various kinds may be seen in the\r\nNorthern Hemisphere, yet the Southern Hemisphere, with its enormous\r\nexpanse of water, is the headquarters of these birds.\r\n\r\nThe dainty, tiny Storm-Petrels, fearlessly tripping over the mountain\r\nbillows in times of great danger to the sailor, were considered birds\r\nof ill-omen. Their peculiar flight possibly helped this idea. Gould\r\nclosely studied them and other ocean birds during his voyages on\r\nsailing ships. He describes them as \"fluttering over the glassy\r\nsurface of the ocean during calms with an easy butterfly-like motion\r\nof the wings, and buffeting and breasting with equal vigor the crests\r\nof the loftiest waves of the storm; at one moment descending into\r\ntheir deep troughs, and, at the next, rising with the utmost alertness\r\nto their highest point, apparently from an impulse communicated as\r\nmuch by striking the surface of the water with its webbed feet as by\r\nthe action of the wings.\"\r\n\r\nThis habit of \"walking\" on the sea is said to be responsible for the\r\nname \"Petrel,\" which is associated with Saint Peter, who, of old,\r\nwalked on the waters. Sailors call them Mother Carey's Chickens.\r\n\r\nThe largest Australian Storm-Petrel is the Whitefaced Storm-Petrel,\r\nwhose scientific name, _Pelagodroma_, means \"open sea wanderer.\"\r\nIt has been recorded even from the North Atlantic and Britain. Many\r\nthousands of these birds still nest on Mud Island, a sandbank just\r\ninside Port Phillip Heads. The presence there of a true ocean wanderer\r\nis a valuable piece of evidence to support the geographer in his claim\r\nthat Port Phillip Bay once had a wide opening, which has been almost\r\nclosed by the drift of sand across its mouth. The Storm-Petrels have\r\nprobably nested there for many, many centuries. Long may they continue\r\nto do so! They hurt no one, and they are a feature of interest to all\r\ninterested in the flora and fauna of Australia, and to natural history\r\nstudents and Nature-lovers in general.\r\n\r\nThe Shackleton expedition met the Wilson (Yellow-webbed) Storm-Petrel,\r\nin considerable numbers, far south. Two specimens were presented by\r\nLieutenant Shackleton to the National Museum, Melbourne. However,\r\nrecently our Museum received, through the agency of two schoolboys,\r\na specimen that is valued even more highly, for it is Australian.\r\n\r\nThe boys, on their way to the Marshaltown State School (Mr. H. B.\r\nWilliamson, H.T.), found a bird near a fence about nine miles inland.\r\nIt had evidently been killed by flying into the fence in the dark.\r\nUsing the _Bird-List_, the boys discovered that it was a Yellow-webbed\r\nStorm-Petrel, a truly pelagic bird, as its name, _Oceanites oceanicus_\r\nindicates. Mr. Williamson, to show that the _List_ was of assistance,\r\neven to boys, in identifying birds they had never heard of before,\r\nleft the bird at the Continuation School, Geelong. Here it was\r\nrecognized as a valuable specimen, and was at once sent to Mr.\r\nKershaw, curator of the National Museum. It is now in the Australian\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nThe true Petrels are very numerous in kinds and individuals. Darwin\r\nthought that the most numerous of birds was a Petrel. One of great\r\ninterest is the \"Mutton-Bird,\" or Short-tailed Petrel. This romantic\r\nbird breeds by the million on Cape Woolamai and other places about\r\nBass Strait.\r\n\r\nJust as the mallee farmer is dependent on his annual wheat harvest,\r\nso the remarkable colony of people living on Cape Barren Island is\r\nentirely dependent on the annual Mutton-Bird harvest. They claim\r\nto take about a million and a half birds each year. The number is\r\nprobably much exaggerated, for Littler, in his valuable _Birds of\r\nTasmania_, gives the number as 555,000 for 1909, valued at about\r\nL4000. Bass and Flinders were glad to replenish their stores with\r\nyoung Mutton-Birds. Flinders calculated that one flock of these birds\r\nhe met in Bass Strait contained 132,000,000 birds. They lay but one\r\negg, so one would expect the Petrel to be long-lived. We found a\r\nclosely-similar bird nesting on Mast Head Island, Capricorn Group.\r\n\r\nThe three southern Diving Petrels, forming the next family, are much\r\nsmaller than the common Petrels. They are expert divers, and are\r\nfound mainly in the far South.\r\n\r\nThe mighty Albatross, with its enormous wing-span of possibly up to\r\n14 feet, is also largely a southern bird. That this bird has spread to\r\nthe North Pacific Ocean, but has not yet penetrated any distance into\r\nthe Atlantic, is another piece of evidence as to the age of these two\r\noceans. The Pacific Ocean is a very ancient depression, while the\r\nAtlantic is much younger, and has been formed since the lands which\r\nborder its shores. The Black-browed Albatross, however, was once seen\r\nin England. Probably this bird might have been carried north on board\r\nship, and then set free again. Fossil bones of Albatrosses have been\r\nfound in France and England. Their remarkable power of wheeling round\r\nand round a vessel, with no perceptible movement of the wing, has\r\nexcited much interest and controversy.\r\n\r\nMr. Froude, in his _Oceana_, has given a vivid description of this\r\nflight. The Albatross \"wheels in circles round and round and for ever\r\nround the ship--now far behind, now sweeping past in a long, rapid\r\ncurve, like a perfect skater on an untouched field of ice. There is no\r\neffort; watch as closely as you will, you rarely or never see a stroke\r\nof the mighty pinion. The flight is generally near the water, often\r\nclose to it. You lose sight of the bird as he disappears in the hollow\r\nbetween the waves, and catch him again as he rises over the crest; but\r\nhow he rises, and whence comes the propelling force, are to the\r\neye inexplicable; he alters merely the angle at which the wings are\r\ninclined....\"\r\n\r\nGould considered that many of these birds circumnavigate the globe\r\nmany times. They follow ships for days together.\r\n\r\nAlbatrosses are sometimes caught by those on board ship. One means\r\nof protection employed by these birds is to discharge a considerable\r\nquantity of oily matter at an intruder. This has led sailors to\r\ndeclare that the bird is \"seasick.\" Some claim that this is not done\r\nfor protection, but is due to fright.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Australasian Ornithologists' Union, when on a trip\r\nin the _Manawatu_ to the Bass Strait Islands found it tantalizing\r\nto see the beautiful Shy Albatrosses sitting on their nests on the\r\nprecipitous granite Albatross Rock, and be unable to land owing to the\r\nrough sea that was running. We waited a second and a third day, in the\r\nshelter of Chimney Corner, Three Hummocks Island, but finally had to\r\ndepart with but a distant acquaintance with this fine bird. When they\r\nreturn to nest the succeeding year, the parents drive last year's\r\nbrood off the island. Does the young live on its fat all through the\r\ncold, rough winter, or do the parents return at intervals to feed it?\r\nSome recent records by a French party on one of these lonely nesting\r\nislands show that in some cases, at least, the parents do feed the\r\nyoung at night during their long wait. The sitting bird is fed by\r\nher mate. He opens his mouth, and she inserts her bill, and chooses a\r\ndainty for herself.\r\n\r\n_A Monograph of the Petrels_, by F.

There are four chief\r\nkinds of these--Terns (Sea-Swallows), including Noddy Terns, Gulls,\r\nthe remarkable northern Skimmers, which skim along the surface with\r\nthe lengthened end of the lower mandible in the water, and the bold\r\nsea-pirates, Skuas. Fifty-seven Terns and Noddies are found throughout\r\nthe world. Of these, twenty-one have been recorded from Australian\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nBeing powerful flyers, it is not surprising to find that several of\r\nthe Australian Terns are really Old-World, and even New-World, forms\r\ntoo. Thus the Whiskered (Marsh) Tern is also British. The Caspian,\r\nGull-billed, and Bridled (Brown-winged) Terns are British and\r\nAmerican, while the Sooty Tern is found in all tropical and\r\nsub-tropical seas. It is one of the famous birds of the world, for\r\nit is the \"egg bird\" of sailors. It retires in large companies to\r\nlow scrubby islands to breed. Here it lays a single egg on the bare\r\nground. Sailors, tired of ship's fare, often visit these \"rookeries.\"\r\nGould quotes a record of one party which took 1500 dozen eggs on\r\none small island in Torres Strait. Spanish eggers from Havanah take\r\ncargoes, which are disposed of at 25 cents per gallon.\r\n\r\nThe Wide-Awake Fair, of Ascension Island, is a famous annual event\r\nin natural history. A similar scene has been described by Mr. A. W.\r\nMilligan, the well-known West Australian ornithologist, on the Houtman\r\nAbrolhos Island, west of Western Australia. Here acres of the ground\r\nwere covered by birds sitting on their nests. The question is, does\r\neach find its own nest when it returns to sit? Mr. Milligan settled\r\nthis in the affirmative by tying a piece of string to a sitting bird\r\nand then letting it take flight. It found its own egg, and resumed its\r\nwork. It is noteworthy that no two of the million eggs are similarly\r\nmarked, and this puzzling variation in marking probably assists each\r\nbird to recognize its own egg.\r\n\r\nOne of the daintiest of these birds is the Fairy Tern, which was\r\ncommon on Mud Island while the 1909 Summer School was being held.\r\nObedient to the call of the mother bird, which hovered threateningly\r\noverhead, the mottled and striped young one squatted on the shelly\r\nsand beach while bird-lovers hunted around for the material for a\r\nphotograph. At length the dark eye revealed the beautifully-protected\r\nyoung bird.\r\n\r\nAs the camera was being fixed, a different call from the mother caused\r\nthe young one to run away. Three or four naturalists tried to catch\r\nthe active little bird, which stopped for a moment and disgorged two\r\nwhole small fish, with which its mother had evidently but recently fed\r\nit. Eventually a good picture was obtained. These Terns nest singly,\r\nthough others nest in large companies. They obtain fish by diving into\r\nthe sea. It was interesting, on a Nature-study excursion, to watch the\r\nCrested Terns diving frequently into the sea above a shoal of small\r\nfish at Sandringham.\r\n\r\nWe found the Noddies breeding in thousands on Mast Head Island, in the\r\nCapricorn Group. They built a small platform of leaves, or seaweed,\r\nhigh or low, on every possible nesting site on the great _Pisonia_\r\ntrees. In fact, there is an interesting kind of partnership between\r\nthe bird and the tree. The fruits of the _Pisonia_ have bands of\r\nsticky glands, which adhere to the plumage of the birds. After a\r\ntime the fruits fall off, possibly on another island, and so this\r\ninteresting tree is spread throughout these small coral sandbanks\r\nand islets. The birds are sometimes so loaded and clogged with these\r\nfruits that they are incapable of flight. Surely here is a wonderful\r\npartnership between the tree-frequenting Noddy and the forest tree\r\nthat provides shelter and nesting places for it. It is, indeed, a\r\nmarvellous method of seed dispersal.\r\n\r\nThe number of ocean birds breeding on these tiny island-paradises\r\nis amazing. Minute Mast Head Island is a place free of all pests--no\r\nflies, no mosquitoes, no ticks, no snakes, nor prickly plants, but\r\na deep shady forest of giant _Pisonia_ trees, sometimes covered with\r\ncreepers and lianas, and fringed with pretty flowering shrubs, fig\r\ntrees, and long green grass, and surrounded, above spring-tide level,\r\nby a fringe of graceful Horse-tail Sheoaks (Casuarinas). We calculated\r\nthat over 100,000 birds bred annually on this 100-acre sandbank, no\r\npoint of which rose 10 feet above spring-tide level. The graceful\r\nWhite-capped Noddies already mentioned nested high and low on the\r\ntrees and shrubs. Petrels in thousands burrowed in the sand under the\r\ngiant _Pisonias_, which are so thickly foliaged that not enough\r\nlight penetrates to enable undergrowth to flourish, so the sand was\r\npractically bare in the centre of the island. Reef Herons nested\r\nlow on spreading branches or interlacing roots. Silver Gulls and\r\nOyster-catchers nested on the ground, within about a yard of the\r\nspring-tide mark; Doves, Silver-eyes, Bell-Magpies (_Streperas_),\r\nCaterpillar-eaters, Kingfishers, and other land birds nested in the\r\ntrees, while the White-bellied Sea-Eagle (almost a fac-simile of the\r\nBald Eagle of America) had his nest overlooking all, on the highest\r\ntree on the island. The Frigate Birds were not nesting on Mast Head\r\nIsland, but they roosted each night in the tall Sheoaks at the water's\r\nedge. It was a treat, in the late afternoon, to see these glorious\r\nbirds winding up their invisible staircase into the vast void of upper\r\nair. Gloriously and calmly they sailed up and up, until the merest\r\nspeck only could be seen. Of corals, turtles, and other marvels we may\r\nnot speak here. The migrating wading-birds had just reached the island\r\nafter their long journey from Siberian Tundras. Some were so poor\r\nthat we caught Sandpipers by hand. Flocks of Turnstone, Golden Plover,\r\nGodwits, Curlew, and other wading-birds were there, possibly only\r\nresting before continuing their journey to the South. It was indeed\r\na privilege to live on such a spot for nine days and to see Nature in\r\nsome of her most interesting phases.\r\n\r\nThe two Australian Seagulls illustrate the \"law of representatives\" so\r\noften referred to by Gould. It is strange how often a closely similar\r\nrepresentative of a Northern bird is found in Australia. Thus the big\r\nPacific Gull is the representative of the large Gull of Europe, though\r\nits peculiar deepened and orange-colored bill is distinctive. It does\r\nnot gain its beautiful white and black plumage until it is three or\r\nmore years old, being brown in the first year, and brown and white in\r\nthe second year.\r\n\r\nThe Silver Gull is known to all. Though a dainty-looking bird, it has\r\na bad character. It is worse than any bird of prey for stealing eggs\r\nand young birds, for let a gannet or other nesting bird but leave the\r\nnest for a moment, and Gulls quickly rob it of its contents. They are\r\nscavengers, and eagerly follow a steamer at lunch-time to gather the\r\nscraps. An interesting sight of Currie Harbor, King Island, is to see\r\nthe large company of Seagulls nesting undisturbed on a tiny, bare,\r\nrocky islet close to the pier.\r\n\r\nIt was noted that, whenever the Noddies were disturbed, and rose,\r\nprotesting loudly, the Gulls immediately gathered and hovered over\r\nthe trees containing Noddies' nests. Evidently they were looking for\r\nunprotected eggs.\r\n\r\nPlaced in the next family are the seven robber Gulls or sea\r\npirates--Skuas. We read of these birds in the old _Royal Readers_,\r\nbut few recognized them when they followed us to the Summer School\r\nof 1910. They also followed our afternoon-tea cruise to South Channel\r\nfort, and played their usual game of compelling the Seagulls to give\r\nup the scraps they had gathered. The Robber Gull, or Skua, of Victoria\r\nis, strange to say, identical with the Skua of England. The one that\r\nfollowed the s.s. _Lady Loch_ to the Summer School is better known in\r\nEngland as the Arctic Gull or Richardson Skua. It breeds in the far\r\nNorth, so it is a great traveller.\r\n\r\nOne interesting fact about these birds is that they show two sets of\r\nplumage. Thus, while each bird, as it gets older, usually changes its\r\nimmature and almost uniform dusky plumage for a white under-surface,\r\nan incomplete white collar, and a blackish cap, yet some retain the\r\ndusky plumage throughout life. This is a good example of \"dimorphism,\"\r\nas it is termed. Usually, instead of picking up their own prey, they\r\nwatch until some other bird has captured a meal, and then they rapidly\r\npursue it and cause it to disgorge. They do not skim over the waves\r\nlike Petrels, but show a heavy, labored flight, varied by a short\r\nsoar. As the two centre tail feathers project beyond the rest, the\r\nbirds can be readily identified as they follow a steamer for tit-bits.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n  [Page 34]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69]]\r\n\r\n    ORDER IX.--LARIFORMES.\r\n\r\n    F. 32.

Stolen fish.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\nThe fifty Australian birds included in the important order of Waders\r\nare remarkably like such birds found inhabiting other regions of the\r\nglobe, shore conditions apparently being somewhat similar the world\r\nover. It is interesting to note that thirteen of the forty-four\r\nAustralian members of this family of Plover-like birds are also found\r\nin Britain, and that most of the others are direct representatives\r\nof closely-related birds found in other Countries. No less than\r\ntwenty-eight of these birds are merely visitors here, for they breed\r\naway in the far North. Many even nest within the Arctic Circle, in\r\nSiberia, for it is a rule that a migrating bird nests in the colder\r\nof the two countries visited. Strictly, these twenty-eight species are\r\nSiberian, or at least northern, forms, and not Australian birds.\r\n\r\nMany members of this group undergo a seasonal change of plumage\r\nwhen breeding time comes. As they spend this season in the Northern\r\nHemisphere, we do not see them in their brilliant colors, but in\r\nquiet, mottled browns and grays.\r\n\r\nSome are \"accidental\" visitors to Australia. Possibly they find their\r\nway here by getting mixed with a company of allied birds on their\r\nannual journey south. Thus the Common (British) Sandpiper is a very\r\nrare bird here, though it retains its British name--Common Sandpiper.\r\nSimilarly, other European and American birds have been recorded, and\r\nthe number of these far-wandering birds recorded from Australia\r\nis likely to be still further increased. The stout, short-legged\r\nTurnstone is the most cosmopolitan of birds. Breeding in Siberia, so\r\nwidely does it roam, that it has visited almost every shore in\r\nthe world, where, true to name, it turns the stones in search of\r\nsandhoppers.\r\n\r\nThe two \"Oyster-catchers\"--\"Redbills\"--are representatives of similar\r\nbirds found almost the world over. Their deepened, flat bill is said\r\nto serve as a pick-axe to force open oysters and mussels. We found one\r\nor two pairs on almost every shore we visited about Bass Strait, on\r\nEyre Peninsula, and on the Barrier Reef.\r\n\r\nThe two common Plovers--the Spurwing and Black-breasted--do not\r\nmigrate, so we see them in brighter colors. Still, though bright\r\nwhen noticed, they are yet wonderfully protected, as they stand quite\r\nstill. I felt great astonishment on finding that I had driven,\r\nnear Lake Tyrrell, into the midst of a company of over a thousand\r\nBlack-breasted Plovers, not noticed until the eye picked out one and\r\nthen another. It recalled to mind the scene in the _Lady of the Lake_,\r\nwhen Fitz James found the hillside alive with Roderick Dhu's warriors.\r\n\r\nThe White-headed Stilt, or Long-legged Plover, is one of five species\r\nspread throughout the world. Some people have pretended to pity the\r\nStilt for being one of Nature's misfits, but surely they never saw the\r\nbird in a state of nature enjoying life, and gaining an easy living on\r\nshallow tidal flats, its long legs being a beautiful adaptation to the\r\nenvironment in which it lives.\r\n\r\nThe Banded Stilt is a purely Australian bird, and has no\r\nrepresentative in other countries. These and some other shore-birds\r\nlive about tidal flats, and get their food in the soft mud. Their long\r\nbill is often flexible, and the tip is sometimes well supplied with\r\nnerves, so that it is sensitive. The bird can thus detect, in the soft\r\nmud, any animal that would serve for food. It can then open its bill\r\nenough to catch the animal without trouble. The Avocet's bill is\r\nsharply curved upwards, and is one of the most remarkable of such\r\norgans. The Australian Avocet is one species of a cosmopolitan genus.\r\n\r\nSome of the Dottrels live on the dry, open plains of the interior;\r\nothers frequent the beaches and shores.\r\n\r\nWhen a bird of prey appears, these plain-living birds squat quite\r\nflat, placing even the head flat on the ground. They thus escape\r\ndetection, for the protective coloring of these birds and of their\r\neggs is marvellous. The story of how a photograph of a Dottrel's nest\r\nwas obtained is of value to teachers, for it will remind us that it\r\nis not well to neglect the three R's, and that Nature-study alone\r\nwill not give a complete education. Three bird-lovers spent some time\r\ntrying to find this nest, while the parent birds flew noisily around.\r\nSuspecting at last that the birds' knowledge of numbers was probably\r\ndeficient, the three hid behind a log. Two then walked away. The birds\r\nimmediately returned to the nest, and a valuable photograph was the\r\nresult. A training in Nature-study, valuable as it undoubtedly is, is\r\nthus not all of our work.\r\n\r\nThe Painted Snipe breeds in Australia, but the Australian Snipe breeds\r\nin Japan, so it, properly speaking, is not an Australian bird. Think\r\nof the journey twice a year! Six of these wading-birds even visit New\r\nZealand each year. How do they find their way there, across a gap\r\nof over 1000 miles, without any land whatever? Inherited memory is\r\nstrong, but how did the first batches find their way? Their annual\r\njourney supports the geographer in his surmise that Australia at no\r\nvery distant date extended very much farther to the east. Indeed,\r\nthese birds almost certainly follow the old coast of the Australian\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nSnipe, some Plovers, Dottrels, Curlews (Sea), Whimbrels, Godwits, &c.,\r\nthus go to the North each year to partake of the abundant banquet\r\nof fruits, &c., preserved in the great ice chamber of the North.\r\nNumberless flocks of birds follow up the melting ice, and so nest\r\nunmolested on the great tundras and plains of Siberia. They wear their\r\nbright wedding dress in the far North, and are known here only in the\r\nquiet mottled browns and grays. In autumn these birds depart. They\r\ntravel mostly at night, to avoid Birds of Prey, and so are seldom\r\nseen, though they may be heard calling as they pass high overhead.\r\nThey are occasionally seen with the aid of telescopes as they pass\r\nacross the face of the moon.\r\n\r\nThe Pratincole, or Swallow-Plover, is a representative of an Old-World\r\nfamily. Its long wings and long legs denote a rapid runner and a rapid\r\nflyer, so that it has little trouble in catching its insect food,\r\neither in the air or on the ground.\r\n\r\nOur inland Stone-Curlew has a call very similar to that of the sea\r\n(true) Curlew, but it has a short, straight bill, instead of a long,\r\narched bill. The proper name of the land Curlew is the Southern\r\nStone-Curlew or Stone-Plover. It is the only Australian bird that\r\nseems to have the power of varying the color of its eggs. If the eggs\r\nare laid in grass, they are greenish; if amongst ironstone, the eggs\r\nare reddish-brown; if on sand, the eggs are tawny; and so on. Other\r\nground-laying birds seem to pick out the soil that matches the\r\ncolor of their eggs, and lay there only. Possibly local races of the\r\nSouthern Stone-Curlew keep to the one class of country. However, the\r\neggs do match the surroundings, and the birds nest on different kinds\r\nof soil and rock.\r\n\r\nIn Family 42, the only Australian bird is the Australian Bustard, our\r\nrepresentative of a widely-spread family, a member of which formerly\r\nbred in Great Britain. It is the well-known \"Wild Turkey.\" As it is a\r\ngood table bird, it is generally shot on sight. This is a mistake,\r\nas it is (as Mr. C. French, Government Entomologist, has pointed out)\r\nworth many times its table value as an insect destroyer. None of the\r\nfamily has spread to America. As no Bustard occurs in the regions\r\nbetween Australia and India, this bird supplies a good example of\r\nwhat is known to zoo-geographers as \"discontinuous distribution.\"\r\n\"Discontinuous distribution,\" as applied to land animals, _e.g._,\r\nmarsupials found in America and Australia, ratite birds in South\r\nAmerica, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, or the tapir,\r\nfound in Central America and Malaysia, implies a land connexion (not\r\nnecessarily complete at any one period) to allow of the gradual spread\r\nof the animals. Of course, as flying birds can pass easily from one\r\nregion to another, \"discontinuous distribution,\" as applied to them,\r\ncannot have so much importance attached to it as indicating previous\r\nland connexions.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n  [Page 42]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82]]\r\n\r\n    ORDER X.--CHARADRIIFORMES.\r\n\r\n    F. 34. _Chionididae_, Sheathbills, Kelp-Pigeons, 3 sp.--2(2)E.\r\n    1(1)Nl.\r\n\r\n    F. 35. _Thinocorythidae_, Seed-Snipe, Seed-Plover, 5 sp.

The great Gould said: \"Its presence adds greatly to the\r\ninterest of the scenery.\" Would that more Australians thought so!\r\n\r\nCranes are amongst the best of flyers. They are said to fly sometimes\r\nat a height of from three and a half to five miles, and have been\r\nseen to cross lofty mountains in Central Asia without increasing\r\ntheir altitude. Perhaps because of its inappropriate name--Native\r\nCompanion--some have proposed to regard this bird as the typical\r\nAustralian bird, but it is not so. In fact, it is our one\r\nrepresentative of an almost world-wide group.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n  [Page 52]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: [111] [112] [113] [114] [115]]\r\n\r\n    ORDER XI.--GRUIFORMES.\r\n\r\n    F. 43.

Australia has representatives of the Ibises, Spoonbills,\r\nStorks, Herons, Egrets, Night Herons, and Bitterns, so well known in\r\nevery part of the world.\r\n\r\nAmongst the world's birds, few are better known than the Ibis. This\r\nbird was so highly prized by the ancient Egyptians as to be considered\r\nsacred, and they thought enough of it to embalm it. As Egypt depended\r\non the overflow of the Nile for food supply, and as this overflow was\r\nheralded by the arrival of the migratory Ibis from the South, it was\r\nnatural for the Egyptians to connect the rise of the river with this\r\nbird, and thus look for its approach. Again, the Ibis is an insect\r\ndestroyer, and, as Egypt was subject to plagues of grasshoppers, it\r\nundoubtedly rendered as valuable service there as it does here. This\r\nis another reason that has been assigned for the esteem in which this\r\nvaluable bird was held. However, it is now almost unknown in Egypt.\r\n\r\nIn Australia we have three Ibises. One, the Sacred Ibis, or White\r\nIbis, is practically identical with the Sacred Ibis of Egypt. Our\r\nsecond Ibis is the even more valuable Straw-necked Ibis, which extends\r\nits labors to plains and pastures, while the Sacred Ibis is rarely\r\nseen except on swampy lands. The Straw-necked Ibis is restricted to\r\nAustralia. It seems to be increasing in numbers, for I have seen small\r\nand large flocks in many parts of the Eastern States recently. It has\r\nan insatiable appetite for grasshoppers and other insects. This bird\r\nis a valuable asset to Australia, and yet thoughtless farmers used\r\nto shoot it. Mr. Le Souef and Dr. C. Ryan came upon a flock of Ibises\r\nbreeding in Riverina. They estimated the flock to contain 240,000\r\nbirds. They found that each bird shot contained on the average 2000\r\nyoung grasshoppers. Think of it; 480,000,000 grasshoppers a day! Where\r\nare those birds now, when needed to stem a locust plague? We have to\r\npay the price of our folly in destroying valuable birds. A third Ibis\r\nis identical with the little Glossy Ibis of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe six Spoonbills are found throughout the world except in New\r\nZealand and the northern parts of North America. They used to breed\r\nin England before man's selfishness and stupidity destroyed them and\r\ntheir nesting-places. They breed at present in the Murray swamps.\r\n\r\nThe Australian Stork--the Jabiru--does not come to the Southern\r\nparts of Australia, but breeds on the Queensland coast. It is\r\na quaint-shaped, though beautifully-colored, bird. Its large,\r\nawkward-looking bill has a slight curve upwards.\r\n\r\nNow come those beautiful birds, the Egrets. Man's cupidity and\r\nselfishness, and woman's desire for ornament, seem to have doomed\r\nthese birds to total extermination, for the plume trade, which is\r\nresponsible for some of the \"most abominable cruelty practised in\r\nthe animal world,\" is a war of extermination. Egrets are shy, and are\r\napproachable only in the breeding season. At that time they are, in\r\nobedience to parental instincts, brave in defence of their young. It\r\nis just then that the plume-hunters visit the rookeries and shoot the\r\nparents, leaving the helpless, almost fully-fledged, young to die in\r\nthe nest, so high overhead. And all for what? Could anyone who has\r\nseen the devastated nests, with the famished bodies of the fledglings\r\nrotting in the sun, ever take pleasure in Egret plumes decking the\r\nhead of a sister or wife? Women of refinement and tender heart will\r\nrefuse to wear the proceeds of human cruelty. Those engaged in the\r\ntrade resort to the mean trick of calling the plumes \"Osprey plumes.\"\r\nNow, the Osprey is a Fish-Hawk, and so possibly of little use to the\r\nland-dweller, but these plumes grow on the back and neck of a valuable\r\ninsect destroyer. The extent of this trade is appalling. At one plume\r\nsale, held in London on 4th August, 1909, the breeding plumes of\r\n24,000 birds were offered for sale. Think of it! The slow starvation\r\nof 40,000 nestlings, the death of 64,000 birds, to provide the plumes\r\nfor one day's sale. No, ladies, if you consider you are in need of\r\nornament, wear ostrich plumes and pheasants' feathers, for these\r\ndo not involve the death of a bird, but rather the reverse, for the\r\ngreater the demand for these feathers, the more birds will be bred;\r\nbut spare the Egret.\r\n\r\nThe Reef Heron is found on beaches from the Bay of Bengal to New\r\nZealand. It has given scientists much trouble, for it has a pure-white\r\nform and a dark slaty-gray form. We found and photographed the nests\r\non Mast Head and Heron Islands. This was a prize, for no photograph\r\nof a Reef Heron's nest had been published previously. As soon as the\r\nfalling tide exposed the reef round the island, Reef Herons, Gulls,\r\nPlovers, Dottrels, and Terns, went out to have their next meal.\r\n\r\nThe \"Blue Crane\" of the country dwellers is the \"White-fronted\r\nHeron\" of the bird-lover. \"Fronted\" in a bird name refers only to\r\nthe forehead. Herons are valuable birds to the grazier, farmer,\r\nand irrigationist, for, in addition to insects and snails, they eat\r\nyabbies (fresh-water crayfish), which bore into the banks and bed of\r\nirrigation channels, and so cause much loss of water by soakage.\r\n\r\nDistinguished from these birds mainly by its nocturnal habit is\r\nthe interesting Nankeen Night Heron, our one representative of a\r\npractically cosmopolitan genus. Our one Night Heron hides on a leafy\r\nbough asleep during the daytime. About dusk he sets off to a swamp.\r\n\r\nThe Australian Bittern, also our one representative of a cosmopolitan\r\ngenus, skulks in a bed of reeds. Hence it is seldom seen. Its loud,\r\ndismal, booming note probably assisted in the formation of the Bunyip\r\nlegends of the blacks. I saw more Bitterns in a recent trip down the\r\nBrisbane than I ever saw before.\r\n\r\nAt breeding time these birds assemble in very large companies, and\r\ntheir nesting-places are called heronries or rookeries. The chief\r\nrookeries here are in the Riverina, where the great annual overflow of\r\nthat fine river, the Murray, converts the country into a great series\r\nof lakes and swamps. Here water animals live in large numbers, and\r\nthousands of birds take advantage of this abundant food supply to nest\r\nthere in the enormous redgums.\r\n\r\nEach bird is the close relative of a similar bird in Europe, so that\r\nwhat is read concerning Herons and Egrets there, applies equally to\r\nour members of this widely-distributed family. Eating grasshoppers\r\nand other insects in great numbers, they are friends of the farmer and\r\ngrazier. Destroying yabbies and other burrowing water animals, they\r\nare valuable allies of the irrigationist, and it is decidedly bad\r\npolicy to shoot one.\r\n\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n  [Page 53]\r\n\r\n    ORDER XII.--ARDEIFORMES.\r\n\r\n    F. 50.

A \"black\" swan was an\r\n\"impossibility,\" so this bird was one of the strongest factors\r\nin establishing Australia's reputation as a land of paradoxes and\r\ncontradictions.\r\n\r\nThe Black Swan is well known outside Australia, as it is common\r\nin every park and garden in Europe. Gould feared that it would be\r\nexterminated here, but fortunately Australians are now learning to\r\nappreciate their own land, and there is no danger of such a calamity.\r\n\r\nEight species of Swans are known to occur all over the world with the\r\nexception of New Zealand and Africa.\r\n\r\nIn the next sub-family there is but one bird--the Semipalmated Goose\r\nof Australia. This bird, better known as the Magpie Goose, has its\r\nfeet but half-webbed, hence its specific name, _semipalmata_. It is\r\ngetting rare, though I heard of six near Colac recently.\r\n\r\nAgain, the only living representative of the next sub-family is the\r\nCape Barren Goose, which is common in city gardens in Adelaide. It\r\nis also becoming rare. It is found only in Tasmania, the Bass Strait\r\nIslands, and Southern Australia. We visited its nesting place near\r\nFlinders Island. It is a very pugnacious bird, so it is difficult to\r\nkeep with other birds.\r\n\r\nAfter the Goose sub-family comes the group which includes our\r\n\"Wood Duck,\" or, as it is called, the Maned Goose, for its bill is\r\ngoose-like. It is a common bird in Australia. Two allied genera are\r\nfound in South America and North-east Africa respectively.\r\n\r\nIn the next sub-family come the domestic Ducks and most of the wild\r\nDucks of Australia. This group is often referred to as the \"Freshwater\r\nor River Ducks.\"\r\n\r\nFirst come two kinds of Whistling Ducks--so called on account of their\r\nwhistling note uttered while flying. These are rare Ducks, one of\r\nwhich is found as far as India; the other is occasionally seen in\r\nNew Zealand, as well as in Australia. The Sheldrake, or Shieldrake\r\n(Mountain Duck) is the largest Australian Duck, and one of the most\r\nhandsome of the sub-family. It is nowhere very plentiful, though one\r\nor more pairs appear in most suitable localities. As it is unfit for\r\nthe table, it should be spared as an ornament to the landscape.\r\n\r\nThe Black Duck is very similar to the common wild Duck (Mallard) of\r\nEngland. Our Black Duck does not change color with the season, nor is\r\nthe male different in color from the female.\r\n\r\nThe Australian Teal is closely similar to the Teal of Europe. It is a\r\ngrass feeder, and is a good table bird. The female is very different\r\nfrom the male. It is impossible to distinguish the male Gray Teal from\r\nthe female Teal when in the free state. Mr. Keartland (ex-President of\r\nthe Field Naturalist Club, and ornithologist to the Horn and Calvert\r\nexploring expeditions) has shown that there is a big difference in\r\nweight. The male of the smaller Gray Teal is not brightly colored like\r\nthe male Chestnut-breasted Teal.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable Shoveller comes next. It is closely similar to the\r\nEnglish Shoveller. Strange that this name was first used for the\r\nSpoonbill. The Shovellers are found the world over. The males are very\r\nbrightly colored in the nesting season.\r\n\r\nUnlike most other birds, Swans and Ducks lose the whole of their wing\r\nfeathers at once when moulting, so that for a short time they cannot\r\nfly. As a protection, the gaudy ones acquire a quiet, inconspicuous\r\ncoloration for a time, so that the male is said to get an \"eclipse\r\nplumage.\" Many other birds get a bright dress for the breeding season\r\nonly, but the male Duck wears his bright dress for the whole year,\r\nexcept in the moulting period. It is then \"eclipsed,\" with the\r\ncorresponding advantage that he is protected from his many enemies at\r\na time when he is most helpless.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable Pink-eared Duck has no close relative. It has a small\r\npink spot between the eye and ear, and so is called pink-eyed or\r\npink-eared. It is found only in Australia. The female is similar in\r\ncolor to the male. The name Wigeon, or Widgeon, sometimes applied to\r\nthis Duck, properly belongs to another of the fresh-water Ducks which\r\nis not found in Australia. Hence, this name should not be used for our\r\nbird.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiar Australian Duck is the Freckled Duck. It is a\r\nvery rare bird. One taken on the ornithologists' excursion to Eyre\r\nPeninsula was considered a prize. So far as is known, it does not\r\nchange color with the season, nor has the male or female the usual\r\nbright metallic patch seen on the wing of a Duck.\r\n\r\nThe \"Salt-water Ducks\" form the next sub-family. These Ducks, though,\r\nare not always true to name, for they are not confined to the salt\r\nwater. The Victorian representative is the well-known White-eyed\r\nDuck, or Hardhead. This Duck was common on the Botanic Gardens\r\nLake, Melbourne, until it was emptied some time ago. Thus, our\r\none \"Salt-water Duck\" was often seen on fresh water. In the same\r\nsub-family come the Eider-Ducks of Iceland and the Logger-head,\r\nRacehorse, or Steamer Duck, of Magellan Straits, which is said to lose\r\nthe power of flight on reaching maturity after the first moult. Thus\r\nthe life-history tells us that this bird is a degenerate form, and\r\nnot a primitive flightless form, for it has evidently descended from\r\nflying ancestors. It uses its wings to row itself along at great\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nThe ninth sub-family of this group of swimming birds contains two\r\nnative Ducks. The Blue-billed Duck, the first of these, is \"especially\r\nadapted for immersion and for obtaining its food from the bottom of\r\nthe water rather than on its surface.\" It was thought by Gould to be\r\nconfined to the coastal lagoons of Western Australia, but it has since\r\nbeen recorded from inland in Victoria, and four specimens have been\r\ntaken in Tasmania. It remains under the water for a considerable time,\r\nand, if hunted, flaps along the surface with its short wings, but\r\nhesitates to exercise its \"feeble grebe-like flight.\"\r\n\r\nSome writers declare that the large Musk Duck is the most remarkable\r\nof the many remarkable birds of Australia. It is the only known\r\nspecies of the genus, and is \"singularly different from every other\r\nmember of the Duck family,\" as Gould points out. Gould further says\r\nthat \"this extraordinary bird reminds one of the Cormorants. Like many\r\nother of these antipodean forms, it must be regarded as an anomaly.\"\r\nThe male has a lengthened, stiff, and leather-like appendage under the\r\nbill. The female is without this pouch, and is but half the size\r\nof the male. A pair is often to be seen on a sheltered bay or on an\r\ninland dam, and yet this bird has very feeble powers of flight. It is\r\ndifficult to cause one to take to flight. Mr. A. J. Campbell summed\r\nup an instructive discussion on this point in the columns of _The\r\nAustralasian_ by concluding that Musk Ducks can fly, though they do so\r\nalmost entirely at night.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n  [Page 62]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: [126] [127] [128] [129] [130]]\r\n\r\n    ORDER XIII.--ANSERIFORMES.\r\n\r\n    F. 58.

Frogs, shellfish, shrimps.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\nThere are six families of birds included in Order XIV.--the\r\nTotally-webbed Swimmers. All four toes are joined by a web. Ducks\r\nhave three toes only joined by the web, the hind toe being free.\r\nRepresentatives of the six families are found in Australia. These\r\nbirds are fishers _par excellence_.\r\n\r\nIn the first family come the well-known Cormorants or Shags, birds\r\nfound in almost every country in the world. Forty-two species are\r\nknown, of which five occur in Australia.\r\n\r\nThe large Black Cormorant is the common Black Cormorant of Britain.\r\nIt has a very extensive range over North America, Greenland, Europe,\r\nAfrica, Asia, and Australia.\r\n\r\nThe little Black Cormorant is found in Australia, from the Moluccas to\r\nBorneo, and in New Zealand. Indeed, New Zealand is the stronghold of\r\nCormorants, as it possesses many species.\r\n\r\nThe White-breasted and Pied Cormorants are so closely similar that\r\npossibly they will yet prove to be one species. Each is glistening\r\nwhite below, and jet black above. The bill is said to be longer in the\r\nPied Cormorant, and the patch of naked skin near the eye is yellow,\r\nwhereas, in the White-breasted Cormorant, this patch is said to be\r\nblackish or purplish. The Little Cormorant is also black and white.\r\nIts throat and upper chest are yellow.\r\n\r\nMr. Mattingley, C.M.Z.S., and others claim that the Cormorant, by\r\nfeeding its young on yabbies, which, they say, prey on fish eggs,\r\nsaves many more fish in the young stage than it ever eats in the adult\r\nstage, and hence it is really \"a friend\" of the anglers and fish. One\r\nthing is certain--fish were formerly much more abundant, and so were\r\nCormorants. Anglers, collect evidence, and balance good with evil.\r\nCormorants have a long, narrow bill, with a strongly-hooked tip. They\r\nare such expert fishers that in China they are much used to catch\r\nfish. Some will probably be surprised to learn that this custom\r\nformerly held in England, for the \"Master of the Cormorants\" was once\r\none of the officers of the Royal household.\r\n\r\nSome Cormorants nest in company in the Murray swamps, while others\r\nretire to a rocky island, such as Storehouse Island, east of Flinders\r\nIsland, to breed.\r\n\r\nThese birds are expert swimmers and divers, so that one of the common\r\nnames for them is \"Diver,\" but the true Divers, as already pointed\r\nout, are Northern Hemisphere birds, and are placed in Family 25.\r\n\r\nThe Darter, or Snake Bird, is practically identical with the\r\nWater-Turkey of the United States. Sometimes, when alarmed, it\r\nsubmerges its body, leaving the head and neck exposed. It swims\r\nrapidly in this position. Four of these birds are known, and they are\r\nspread over America, Africa, Madagascar, Southern Asia, New Guinea,\r\nAustralia, and New Zealand. The Darter was frequently seen on a recent\r\ntrip to Enoggera Reservoir, the storage basin for Brisbane. The long,\r\nstiletto-like bill is used to impale its prey, while the flexible neck\r\nassists the spearing operation.\r\n\r\nThe next family contains the famous \"Boobies\" of sailors--the stupid\r\nGannets, or Solan Geese, that were too stupid to escape from danger.\r\nGould says our Gannet out-boobies the Booby, for he landed on a flat\r\nrock and secured five specimens by hand before the rest shuffled over\r\nthe edge of the cliff and took flight. The Australian bird can scarcely\r\nbe distinguished from its British cousin. It is common in Australian\r\nseas, where it can be seen diving for fish or flying swiftly round\r\nlooking for prey. There is a large Gannet rookery on Cat Island, east\r\nof Flinders Island, where probably 4000 pairs of these fine birds nest\r\neach year. This was visited by a party of ornithologists in the\r\n_Manawatu_ in 1908.\r\n\r\nThe famous Frigate-Bird we read of in the old school readers was\r\ntwice taken in Port Phillip Bay. It is the best of flyers, as it can\r\n\"breakfast on the Senegal (Africa), and dine on the Amazon.\" The\r\ntwo Frigate-Birds are common in Australian tropical seas. As already\r\nmentioned we met the Frigate Bird on Mast Head Island. Its wings are\r\nlong, the forked tail also is long, but the legs and feet are very\r\nsmall. It is a creature of the air, and gets its living by compelling\r\nhard-working sea-birds to disgorge their prey.\r\n\r\nThe last bird in this varied Order is the Pelican. Our Australian\r\nPelican is one of the largest of its tribe. Its enormous pouch\r\ndistinguishes it at once. The ten Pelicans are practically world-wide\r\nin their distribution. On the trip of the _Manawatu_ last year round\r\nthe islands of Bass Strait, we visited the Pelicans' nesting-place on\r\nPenguin Island. This bird is practically identical with the \"Pelican\r\nof the wilderness\" mentioned in Holy Writ. The Pelican enjoys a\r\nreputation for maternal care of her offspring; indeed, she was said to\r\nfeed the young with her own blood. This was probably due to the fact\r\nthat one species of Pelican has a blood-red tip to the bill.\r\nYoung Pelicans have not the long bill or the pouch. Thus this bird\r\nillustrates the truth of the statement that each animal in its\r\ndevelopment climbs its own ancestral tree, or, to say it in another\r\nform, each animal in its development recapitulates the life-history\r\nof the race. The Pelican has evidently descended from birds that\r\npossessed a short bill.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n  [Page 68]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: [142] [143] [144] [145] [146]]\r\n\r\n    ORDER XIV.--PELICANIFORMES.\r\n\r\n    F. 59.

The largest of flying birds.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\nThe well-known Birds of Prey, so keen of eye, so rapid of flight,\r\nso fearless in courage, and so matchless in fight, have spread over\r\nalmost the whole known world. The Eagles of one land are, therefore,\r\nmuch like the Eagles of another. The Harriers of England are\r\npractically identical with the Harriers of Australia and New Zealand,\r\nand, in fact, of almost any other land. The Falcon, so famous in\r\nmediaeval times, is practically identical with the Falcon of Australia\r\nand Tasmania. The Australian Fish Hawk is the universal Fish Hawk\r\nor Osprey, for there is probably but one Osprey, having an almost\r\nworld-wide range. The naming of these birds, though, has been a\r\nstumbling-block to us. To Australians they are all Hawks--even our\r\ngigantic and glorious Eagle has been reduced to the ignominious level\r\nof an \"Eaglehawk,\" though our male Eagle is the largest male Eagle\r\nknown, outrivalling, as it does, both the Bald Eagle of America and\r\nthe Golden Eagle of Europe. A source of confusion, too, has arisen\r\nfrom the introduction of so many of our popular names from America,\r\nThus, the Gum-tree (Eucalypt) is not a Gum, the 'Possum is not the\r\ncarnivorous Opossum of America, the Goanna is not the equivalent of\r\nthe vegetarian American Iguana; the \"Wild Cat\" is not a Cat, nor is\r\nthe \"Native Bear\" a Bear, nor even remotely related to one, nor is\r\nthe Kestrel a Sparrowhawk. It is an American error in popular naming,\r\nwhich has given us the Kestrel as the equivalent of the American\r\nSparrowhawk, while the Sparrowhawk of the ornithologist is the\r\nequivalent of the Sparrowhawk of Britain.\r\n\r\nIn one respect, we are unfortunate in this new land. No mass of\r\nassociation and tradition has yet had time to crystallize about our\r\nnative animals and plants. Our poets have not been able to sing of our\r\nbirds for want of names and knowledge. Little has been done beyond\r\nthe giving and frequent altering of scientific names, and the\r\nmisapplication of names of animals and plants living in other lands to\r\noften totally different animals and plants here, so that confusion\r\nhas reigned supreme. However, in bird matters, at least, we are on\r\na better footing, for the bird-lovers have provided a common, and in\r\nmost cases an appropriate, name for each bird.\r\n\r\nThe American Bobolink and Chickadee are famous birds, chiefly on\r\naccount of an appropriate name; so is the British Cuckoo, while its\r\neven more noisy, more common, and practically identical Australian\r\ncousin is still unknown, or rather was until recently. The\r\nintroduction of Bird Day has already produced gratifying results. We\r\nneed good descriptive names for our varied and beautiful birds--more\r\nchildren's and poets' names, and less of the deadly formal\r\n\"Yellow-vented Parrakeet,\" \"Blue-bellied Lorikeet,\" and \"Warty-faced\r\nHoneyeater\" for some of the most glorious of the world's birds.\r\n\r\nThe old Order _Raptores_--birds of prey--included Hawks and Eagles,\r\nand Owls. These are now placed in two orders as \"Diurnal Birds of\r\nPrey\"--Hawks, and \"Nocturnal Birds of Prey\"--Owls. They all seize prey\r\nwith the very well-developed talons, and not with the bill. Hence\r\nthey were called _Raptores_--seizing birds. They use these talons when\r\nflying, and do not catch prey in scrub, or very close to the ground,\r\nunless in a clear space.\r\n\r\nThe two Harriers are typically Ground Hawks. The name is said to be\r\nderived from the habit these birds are said to possess of _harrying_\r\nbirds. They are generally called \"Swamp Hawks,\" and may frequently be\r\nseen flying low over bushes, to beat birds out.\r\n\r\nThe Goshawks--_i.e._, Goosehawks--possibly received their name by\r\nconfusion, as possibly a Falcon to hunt Geese was kept in olden days,\r\nbut probably it was not this bird. Three of these birds are rare.\r\nThe White Goshawk is a fine bird, and is confined to Australia and\r\nTasmania. The Australian Goshawk is said to be the only troublesome\r\nHawk to the poultry farmer, and he bears a bad name generally. The\r\nLesser Goshawk is a casual visitor in the Eastern States.\r\n\r\nThe Sparrowhawk of the ornithologist is much feared by small birds. He\r\nlurks in ambush, suddenly flashes out upon his prey, and is away\r\nwith it instantly. The male is one of the smallest of Hawks. It is\r\nan almost universal rule in this order of birds that the females are\r\nlarger, often much larger, than the males, and that there are several\r\nchanges of plumage before the adult plumage is finally donned, so it\r\nis often a matter of difficulty to determine exactly the name of one\r\nof these birds.\r\n\r\nEagles are found the world over except in New Zealand. Our Eagle has\r\nthe honor of being, as already stated, the largest Eagle in the world.\r\nIt is also of undoubted courage, as its specific name, _audax_ (bold)\r\nwould lead one to suppose. It is, further, Gould says, of a \"far more\r\npleasing and elegant contour\" than the Golden Eagle, the \"pride and\r\npest of the parish.\" Whoever heard of an Australian who was proud of\r\nhis Eagle, though it is something to be proud of? Let our noble bird\r\nappear near a house, and there is a rush for a gun. On Eyre Peninsula\r\nwe found the Eagles fed their young on rabbits, a serious pest in\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nThe equivalent of our Sea Eagle is the White-headed or Bald Eagle of\r\nAmerica, the female of which is the same length as the male of our\r\nEagle, 38 inches. Many of these glorious Sea Eagles were floating,\r\nwith their peculiar butterfly-like flight, over the Brisbane River,\r\nand added much to our enjoyment of a recent bird excursion there. We\r\nfound one nest on each island in the Capricorn Group. On Mast Head\r\nIsland the nest was in a tree about 60 feet high. On tiny Erskine\r\nIsland, where there were no big trees, it was built on the ground,\r\nthough it had been added to until it is now over 6 feet high. The\r\nfully-feathered dark-brown young bird sat on the edge of the nest, and\r\nformed a good photographic subject. Eagles were ruthlessly slaughtered\r\nin the British Isles. There is a shadow of an excuse there, perhaps,\r\nwith their game preserves, where rabbits and birds are bred for\r\nsporting purposes. These reasons do not exist here. But it is pleasing\r\nto find on record that, even there, \"Lord Breadalbane, who died in\r\n1862, thought that the spectacle of a soaring Eagle was a fitting\r\nadjunct to the grandeur of the Argyllshire mountain scenery, and a\r\ngood equivalent for the occasional loss of a lamb.\"\r\n\r\nThough the Sea Eagle lives mainly on fish and refuse cast up by the\r\nsea, it is pitiful to read that, though this interesting, picturesque,\r\nand valuable bird was once common, not one is left on the mainland\r\nof Scotland. Could blind, unreasoning slaughter do more? Why kill a\r\nharmless bird? But it is not only harmless; it is of distinct value\r\nin its sphere in Nature. Hawks altogether are misunderstood and\r\nmisjudged. It is doubtful if it pays a farmer, aye, even a poultry\r\nfarmer, to shoot Hawks. They might steal a few chickens, but they\r\ndo not live on them. They live mainly on rabbits, mice, rats, and\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nThe Whistling Eagle whistles while flying about in the fine large\r\nflight-houses of the Adelaide Zoological Gardens. One fine specimen\r\naccompanied the Federal trawler _Endeavour_ down Gladstone Harbor, but\r\nnot far from shore, for it returned when we headed for the open ocean\r\nand the fairyland of the Great Barrier Reef.\r\n\r\nKites used to be excessively common about many English towns, where\r\nthey acted as scavengers. The introduction of the shot-gun has\r\nexterminated them. They are world-wide in distribution, so what\r\nyou read about European Kites will fit Australian Kites. They are,\r\nperhaps, the most graceful of flyers, gliding, soaring, hovering,\r\nand performing all sorts of aerial evolutions. The toy kites of our\r\nchildhood were suggested by the flight of these once common birds.\r\nNow, alas! they are very rarely seen. Being mainly insectivorous, they\r\nare invaluable birds, and we can ill spare them in this country, where\r\ninsect life is so abnormally prolific.\r\n\r\nThe Black-breasted Buzzard is the third largest of our Diurnal Birds\r\nof Prey. It is a rare visitor in Southern Australia, but in seasons of\r\ndrought it comes down from Central Australia.\r\n\r\nThe Falcon, which our ancestors trained for hawking, is almost\r\nidentical with our Falcon, while our Little Falcon is, for its size,\r\nthe \"boldest and swiftest of all birds of prey,\" for it has been\r\nobserved to decapitate a flying Duck with a blow of the edge of its\r\nwing. In Brisbane we had the pleasure of spending an interesting\r\nafternoon with Mr. J. Bell, who formerly practised falconry with\r\ntrained Australian Falcons.\r\n\r\nThe Kestrel of Australia is almost identical with the Kestrel of\r\nEurope. You must have noticed with interest its habit of hovering. One\r\nincident of the 1909 Ornithologists' Congress will show that, even\r\nin the midst of a crowded city like Adelaide, it is possible for\r\nscientific work in ornithology to be done. While the Director of\r\nEducation, Mr. A. Williams, Mr. Le Souef (ex-Pres., A.O.U.), Mr. A.\r\nJ. Campbell (Pres., A.O.U.), Mr. Robert Hall (Vice-Pres., A.O.U.), and\r\nmyself were walking from the Education Office to Grote Street School,\r\na Kestrel was seen on the grass in a small square. The members of\r\nthe party were astonished to see the Kestrel rise carrying a\r\nbird, possibly a Sparrow, in its talons. Now, the interest of this\r\nobservation is that most of our ornithologists were prepared to state\r\nthat the Kestrel is entirely insectivorous, and never touches small\r\nbirds. However, an observation in the heart of Adelaide is of value\r\nin this matter of scientific interest. This bird, unfortunately,\r\nis generally called the Sparrowhawk, a name which belongs to a much\r\nbolder Australian bird of prey (No. 157), which does eat small birds.\r\n\r\nKestrels are very fond of mice, and would, if allowed, spend time\r\nprotecting the farmer's haystacks, but if a Kestrel comes near the\r\nfarmhouse the gun is at once produced, and so the farmer loses the\r\nservices of one of his best friends.\r\n\r\nJeffries and other Nature-lovers have written on the marvellous\r\npowers of hovering possessed by these birds. In fact, the Kestrel is\r\nfrequently called the Windhover. In Australia Kestrels frequently nest\r\nin a hollow tree, but do not lay the usual white egg.\r\n\r\nThe Osprey is another example of bad naming. The word is said to be a\r\ncorruption of Ossifrage, the \"bone-breaker.\" As it feeds on fish,\r\nit has no big bones to break. It is spread from \"Alaska to Brazil,\r\nLapland to Natal, Japan to Tasmania, and even out to the Pacific\r\nIsles,\" and it may be the same bird throughout, though Dr. Sharpe\r\nhas allowed three species in the \"_Handlist of Birds_.\" \"_The A.O.U.\r\nCheck-list of North American Birds_, 1910,\" however, recognizes the\r\nNorth American bird as a sub-species only, so it is possible the\r\nAustralian bird will be also listed as a sub-species when the Royal\r\nAustralasian Ornithologists' Union adopts its check-list in Sydney\r\nthis year. These birds eat living fish, which they catch by plunging\r\ninto the sea. Occasionally they drive their talons into too big a\r\nfish, and, not being able to withdraw them, are drowned.\r\n\r\nFlinders, in his journal, wrote about the enormous nests he met on\r\nrocky points, and considered they were built by a great \"Dinornis.\"\r\n\r\nThe Osprey and the White-bellied Sea Eagle, however, build on rocky\r\npoints if no trees are available, and add to the nest each year. It\r\nis interesting to read in the Western Australian Year Book article\r\non birds that the Government has placed an Osprey's nest in the\r\ncave district, \"under the protection of the Cave Warden.\" A pleasing\r\ninterest is growing in Australian nature in its many forms.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n  [Page 72]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: [151] [152] [153] [154] [155] [156]]\r\n\r\n    ORDER XV.--ACCIPITRIFORMES, DIURNAL BIRDS OF PREY.\r\n\r\n    F. 66. _Serpentariidae_, Secretary-Bird, 2 sp.

The different\r\nkinds of Owls are so closely similar that there are many disputes as\r\nto their classification, and it is not likely that we shall ever be\r\nable to recognize in the living, free state all the species recognized\r\nby scientists.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I was much interested at the Adelaide Museum to see our\r\nleading ornithologists fail to pick out the skins of two English Barn\r\nOwls when they were placed with three Australian Lesser Masked Owls,\r\nand yet ornithologists give our birds such widely-different names that\r\nliterature is useless to us. These names have seriously hampered the\r\npopularization of bird-study in Australia. If ornithologists, with\r\nskins in hand, cannot separate them, what is the use of manufacturing\r\nspecies?\r\n\r\nAs Owls are active late in the afternoon or at night, there has\r\nalways been a certain amount of mystery regarding them, and, speaking\r\ngenerally, the ordinary observer knows little of them. Two of the\r\nAustralian birds have forced themselves on our notice to some extent.\r\nThe Powerful Owl, the largest of our Owls, has alarmed many by means\r\nof its blood-curdling screeches heard in quiet forest gullies.\r\n\r\nThe Boobook Owl, though not often seen, calls \"Mopoke,\" which sounded\r\nlike \"Boobook\" to the aboriginal ear, but became \"Cuckoo\"--the\r\nbest-loved bird-call of their far-distant home to the ears of the\r\nhomesick first white residents. And was it not, they asked, what one\r\nmight expect in a country where Christmas came at the wrong time\r\nof the year, where the trees were always green, and shed their bark\r\ninstead of their leaves--where the leaves grew vertically, instead\r\nof horizontally, and so gave no shade--was it not natural that the\r\nCuckoo, a day bird in England, should become a night bird in this land\r\nof paradoxes and contradictions? Thus Australia's reputation was added\r\nto even by the Boobook Owl.\r\n\r\nConfusion was caused, for, when daylight came, and the Frogmouth was\r\nseen sitting in the tree, the Frogmouth was supposed to be responsible\r\nfor the frequent calls of the previous night. However, some reliable\r\nobservers, notably Mr. C. H. McLennan, \"Mallee Bird,\" and Mr. T. H.\r\nTregellas, claim that the Frogmouth does call \"Mopoke'\" occasionally,\r\nbut the Boobook Owl is the bird that is responsible for the frequent\r\n\"Mopoke\" on calm evenings.\r\n\r\nThe Owls are divided into two families. The members of the first\r\nfamily--the Owls Proper, or Hawk-Owls--have the facial disc almost\r\nabsent, while in the second family the facial disc is complete. In\r\neach, the eyes are directly obliquely forward, and, since they are not\r\ncapable of much movement, the bird turns its head from side to side.\r\nThough mainly nocturnal, Owls are sometimes seen hunting for their\r\nprey by day. As they feed mostly on mice, rats, and insects, they are\r\nvery valuable birds. The feathers are very soft, with a weak central\r\naxis, so that no sound is made when flying. They are thus able to\r\napproach their prey without giving warning. The Powerful Owl well\r\ndeserves its name, as it possesses great strength, and is a formidable\r\nenemy if wounded. However, Owls are, fortunately, seldom shot at.\r\n\r\nLike Hawks, Owls catch their prey with and carry it in their feet,\r\nunless the feet are required for climbing. One peculiarity of the feet\r\nis that the bird can reverse one toe, so that it can have three toes\r\nin front and one behind, like most birds, or two in front and two\r\nbehind, like Parrots and Cuckoos.\r\n\r\nAlthough not so strong of flight as the Diurnal Birds of Prey (_e.g._,\r\nHawks), Owls have managed to spread throughout the world, so that\r\nthey are found even in New Zealand. The different kinds are not easily\r\nseparated, so most people are satisfied when they have classed a\r\nbird as an Owl, though you will probably want to divide them into two\r\ngroups--the Owls Proper and the Barn Owls.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n  [Page 85]\r\n\r\n    ORDER XVI--STRIGIFORMES, NOCTURNAL BIRDS OF PREY, OWLS.\r\n\r\n    F. 70.

In addition, there are some groups\r\nwhich are found in other continents, but which reach their highest\r\ndevelopment here. Conspicuous amongst these are Parrots and Cockatoos.\r\nAustralians are so accustomed to see these beautiful birds on every\r\ncountry road, and in cages outside their houses, that they do not\r\nappreciate their beauty or their interest, for \"familiarity breeds\r\ncontempt,\" even with bird life.\r\n\r\nWhen one reflects that no figure of a Parrot is found in ancient\r\nEgyptian art, and that no Parrot is mentioned in the Bible, then\r\none begins to understand the interest of Europeans in these \"spoilt\r\nchildren\" of the animal world, the \"monkeys of the bird world,\" and\r\n\"the cream of the Australian avifauna.\"\r\n\r\nTheir tameness, their affection, their entertaining habits, and their\r\nremarkable powers of speech, all help to render Parrots the favorites\r\namongst birds. The brilliance of their plumage, their intelligence,\r\nand their longevity excite wonder, for Parrots have been known to live\r\n100 years in captivity. Presumably, they would live even longer in a\r\nstate of nature. Humboldt recorded, as quoted in Newton's \"Dictionary\r\nof Birds,\" \"that in South America he met with a venerable bird, which\r\nremained the sole possessor of a literally dead language, the\r\nwhole tribe of Indians, Atures by name, who spoke it, having become\r\nextinct.\"\r\n\r\nAustralians will perhaps be surprised to learn that there are no\r\nParrots or Cockatoos in Europe, and none in Asia, excepting India,\r\nnone in Africa north of the Tropic of Cancer, and only two in North\r\nAmerica, and that one of these is rapidly becoming extinct, and\r\nthat Africa and India are poor in Parrots. Thus South America and\r\nAustralasia alone are left as the lands that contain these interesting\r\nbirds in any number. While South America contains the largest\r\nParrots--the Macaws--all the South American species belong to\r\none family. In the Australian region six families of Parrots are\r\nrepresented. Four of them are confined to the region, while but one\r\nspecies of the fifth family (Cockatoos) is found outside the region.\r\n\r\nThe Brush-tongued Parrots, or \"Lorikeets,\" are a purely Australian\r\nfamily. Some of these are very common at times in flowering eucalypts,\r\neven in the public gardens and streets. The Blue Mountain Parrot, very\r\ncommon at times, is a giant of the family. It has been described as\r\na \"noble bird, gorgeously apparelled.\" Its vernacular name of\r\nBlue-bellied Lorikeet has been altered to Blue Mountain Lorikeet.\r\nWe found these birds nesting in the big sugar-gums bordering Warunda\r\nCreek, Eyre Peninsula. They keenly and noisily resented our curiosity,\r\nand screeched much as we tried to discover them amongst the green\r\nfoliage. Though so gaudy, they were picked out with difficulty.\r\nThis bird was very troublesome in my garden at Bengworden, near\r\nthe Gippsland Lakes, where, when the apples were about the size of\r\nmarbles, they tore them to pieces to get the developing \"pips.\" In\r\ncommon with the other members of the family, they have a swift, direct\r\nflight, and screech much when flying. The \"Green Keets,\" generally\r\ncalled \"Green Leeks,\" which are so very numerous at times, are often\r\naccompanied by two other Lorikeets, the Little and Purple-crowned\r\nLorikeets. These green birds hang, head down, among the eucalyptus\r\nleaves, and brush up the honey from the flowers with their brush\r\ntongue. They follow the flowering of the eucalypts from district to\r\ndistrict, and since the eucalypts flower at irregular intervals, these\r\nbirds are not so regular in their movements as Swifts, Snipe, Curlews,\r\nCuckoos, and other migratory birds. For this reason the birds may be\r\nabsent from a district for some years, and then suddenly appear again\r\nin great numbers.\r\n\r\nCockatoos are almost confined to the Australian region. This includes\r\nthe islands north-west of Australia out to Wallace's line, passing\r\nbetween Celebes and the Philippine Islands, Celebes and Borneo, and\r\nbetween the small islands of Lombok and Bali, east of Java. These\r\nislands, though but fifteen miles apart, \"differ far more from each\r\nother in their birds and quadrupeds than do England and Japan. The\r\nbirds of the one are extremely unlike those of the other.\" Another\r\nauthority says that the faunas of Bali and Lombok are more unlike\r\nthan those of South America and Africa. Bali has Woodpeckers, Barbets,\r\nBulbuls, and Black and White Magpie-Robins, none of which is found\r\nin Lombok, where we find Screaming Cockatoos, Friar-birds, and other\r\nHoney-eaters, and the strange mound-building Megapodes and numerous\r\nother remarkable birds. This narrow strait is over 1000 fathoms in\r\ndepth, and is probably one of the most ancient and most permanent\r\ndividing lines in the world. Instead of being united to Asia, it is\r\nprobable that Australia has been more recently joined to New Zealand,\r\nSouth America, and South Africa. Only one Cockatoo transgresses\r\nWallace's line to the west, and that is found in the Philippine\r\nIslands; evidently it has spread there from the adjacent part of the\r\nAustralian region.\r\n\r\nThe sombre, slow-flying Black Cockatoo is the largest of all\r\nCockatoos. It is seen fairly often in small companies, especially on\r\nwattles and eucalypts, the wood of which it tears to pieces with its\r\npowerful bill to get the insect larvae feeding there. It is a valuable\r\nforest-saving bird.\r\n\r\nThe Glossy or Leach Black Cockatoo is named after Dr. Leach, who did a\r\ngreat amount of work on Australian animals about 100 years ago. It is\r\na rare bird, and may readily be distinguished by its smaller size and\r\nmore glossy plumage.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar gray Gang-gang Cockatoos are common in parts of the\r\nforest country. The male is easily recognized by his red head and\r\ncrest. I occasionally see these interesting birds in the big eucalypt\r\nforests of Gippsland. I was surprised to discover that, in South\r\nGippsland, it is generally called the Galah, a name which belongs to\r\nquite a different bird (194).\r\n\r\nThe screeching, fussy White Cockatoo, with its delicate sulphur crest,\r\nis well known. Many country dwellers enjoy the privilege of often\r\nseeing these snowy-white birds almost covering a dead tree. They\r\nare favorites as pets, and live to a good old age. They render good\r\nservice at times by digging up and eating grasshoppers' eggs, though\r\nthey do damage to maize and other crops. As they post sentinels, they\r\nare difficult birds to approach.\r\n\r\nThe Pink Cockatoo (Major Mitchell) is unfortunately becoming rare. It\r\nwas fairly common when I taught in a Mallee school, near where Hopetoun\r\nnow is. It has been described as \"quite the most beautiful of all the\r\nCockatoos, being a harmony of delicate rose-pink and white, with a\r\nhandsome crest of acuminate feathers barred in crimson, yellow, and\r\nwhite.\" It does not take kindly to captivity. It nested in the smaller\r\n\"spouts\" of the green \"box-trees\" in the \"box-flats\" and swamps about\r\nthe Goyura School, south of Lake Corrong.\r\n\r\nWhat is more glorious than a mob of Rose-breasted Cockatoos\r\n(Galahs), 500 strong, airing their beauties and graces as they take a\r\nconstitutional before retiring for the night? Probably no other kind\r\nof bird shows better company-flying than Galahs; now one sheet of\r\na delicate gray lavender, and the next instant a flash of brilliant\r\nsalmon-pink, as the whole company turns and wheels, obedient to some\r\ncommand or signal unperceived by us; again, the sun lights up the\r\npale-pink crests and gray backs, as they turn once more and wheel,\r\nscreeching, to continue their evolutions further afield. It is a sight\r\nthat lingers in the memory. They are charming pets, and some talk\r\nwell. Their beauty adds charm to our almost perfectly level great\r\ninland plains.\r\n\r\nThe delicately-colored and friendly Cockatoo Parrot, with its\r\nimmovable crest, takes a sub-family to itself. It migrates from the\r\nNorth, and, in a dry year, may even reach the South Coast. In 1908\r\nsome of these birds reached Colac, in Southern Victoria. They are\r\nfavorite aviary birds, and thousands have been exported.\r\n\r\nIn the true Parrot family, Australia is strongly represented by many\r\nbeautiful birds. The first is the Barraband Parrakeet of Gould, and\r\nthe Green Leek of some ornithologists. As the name Green Leek is\r\npractically in universal use for the Musk Lorikeet (Green Keet) of the\r\nornithologist, it seems desirable to sink an inappropriate name into\r\na synonym, and use the earlier name, Superb Parrot, for it is a\r\nbeautiful bird. Sad to say, it has become exceedingly rare, though Mr.\r\nA. W. Milligan informed me, a few days ago, that he saw six fly into\r\nsome pines at Black Rock one day this month (January, 1911).\r\n\r\nThe Rock Pebble, or Smoker, of the country dweller, formally called\r\nthe Black-tailed Parrot, is a fine bird. His tail, however, is not\r\nreally black, but is strongly iridescent. He nested in numbers, at\r\nthe beginning of the nineties, in the dead box-trees in Lake Corrong.\r\nAfter an early tea, we frequently went over to the lake and watched\r\nthe birds feeding their young. No longer do they inhabit that\r\ndistrict, which has been completely cleared and placed under\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nThe big King Parrot is a \"showy, noble species,\" and is still common\r\nin parts, especially the moist forest districts.\r\n\r\nThe members of the next group form a sub-family--the\r\nBroad-tails--confined to Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, and the\r\nPacific Islands. Judging by their names, they must be amongst the most\r\nbeautiful of birds. The best known is the common Rosella, often\r\nquoted in European books as one of the most beautiful of birds.\r\nIts scientific name is eximius, which means excellent. Indeed, the\r\nscientific names of Australian parrots give a good indication of\r\ntheir place amongst the glories of the bird world. The cousin of the\r\nRosella--the large blue-winged and blue-cheeked Crimson Parrot--is\r\nwell named elegans; a grass parrot is also elegans, then follow\r\nsplendidus, splendida, and pulchella, while that great ornithologist,\r\nGould, has conferred the honor of pulcherrimus on another Australian\r\nparrot. These names, given by scientists, will show Australians in\r\nwhat high esteem these birds, so common with us, are held by observers\r\nfrom other lands.\r\n\r\nThe Crimson Parrot, previously mentioned, is, I think, becoming\r\ncommon, for I have lately seen it flying about in towns, notably in\r\nthe Botanic Gardens, Melbourne, the Zoological Gardens, Melbourne, and\r\nthe school yard at Wangaratta.\r\n\r\nThe Yellow Parrakeet, with its blue cheeks, is a \"harmony in blue and\r\ncanary yellow, and is an exceedingly lovely bird.\" It is unfortunately\r\nrare.\r\n\r\nThe next bird is one of our well-known cage pets--the beautiful\r\nRingneck--the Mallee Parrot. It flies ahead of one along the\r\nhalf-chain strip of scrub left on mallee roads, and is a feature of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe next group contains some inland parrots. The \"Bulloak,\" or \"Blue\r\nBonnet,\" is a beautiful bird, and is common on inland plains. It has\r\na brownish-olive back and a gray chest. The bright, blue cheeks,\r\nforehead, and shoulder, red abdomen, and light yellow base to tail\r\npresent a striking appearance. Its vernacular name--Yellow-vented\r\nParrakeet--has now been altered to Blue Bonnet Parrot.\r\n\r\nThe Many-colored Parrot, with its large yellow shoulder patch, is a\r\nglory. It is, indeed, difficult to imagine a more beautiful bird as\r\nit flies about in the bright Mallee sunshine. The Red-backed Parrot is\r\nthe common \"Grass Parrot\" of country dwellers. Large flocks of these\r\nbirds are to be seen on the inland plains. The female is much plainer\r\nthan her gaudy mate. This is unusual amongst parrots; for, as the work\r\nof sitting on the eggs is done in a hollow tree under good shelter,\r\nthere is apparently no reason why the female should be plainer than\r\nthe male, and in most parrots she is equally pretty.\r\n\r\nThe brownish female offers a strong contrast to her more brightly\r\ncoloured mate, which is immediately distinguished by the large red\r\npatch on the back. (The Many-colored Parrot has a much smaller red\r\npatch on the back, near the base of the tail.)\r\n\r\nThe seven small Grass-Parrots (_Neophemas_) are amongst the most\r\nbeautiful of parrots. These birds have become so rare that the South\r\nAustralian Government has wisely placed them on the totally-protected\r\nlist. Bird trappers formerly exported numbers to Europe each year.\r\nThese rare Parrots are said to be worth about L7 each as cage birds.\r\n\r\nWe found the rare Rock Parrot nesting in the edges and hollows of\r\na tiny travertine-limestone island (Goat Island) in an inlet at the\r\neastern end of the Great Australian Bight. The eggs were laid on the\r\nbare earth, often within two or three feet of high-tide mark. The\r\nwhole island was less than an acre in extent, and at no point was ten\r\nfeet above high-tide level. Many similar islands on the Australian\r\ncoast have not yet been explored ornithologically, so we do not know\r\nwhat matters of interest are awaiting us.\r\n\r\nThe next bird, the Swift-flying Lorikeet, is a honey feeder, like the\r\nfirst four Parrots (Lorikeets) mentioned. It is often found with\r\nthem, and was common all the winter, and is common now in a clump\r\nof flowering gums outside the Melbourne Cricket Ground. It has given\r\nscientists much trouble as to its correct name and position. It can\r\nbe distinguished from the \"Green Keets\" by having scarlet under the\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful and affectionate little Budgerigar (Warbling Grass\r\nParrot), or Love Bird, has many names. It is migratory, and sometimes\r\nappears in thousands, though it may not be seen again for years. It is\r\na favorite cage bird, and breeds as freely as caged canaries, so it is\r\nwell-known in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe last two Parrots are ground birds, which never perch or climb.\r\nIt was feared that the Ground Parrot was extinct, but it is seen\r\noccasionally in the National Park at Wilson's Promontory. The Night\r\nParrot is better called the Western Ground Parrot. It is found amongst\r\nthe Spinifex (_Triodia_) scrub of the interior.\r\n\r\nThough Parrots are essentially \"climbers,\" having the suitable\r\narrangement of two toes in front and two behind, it is interesting to\r\nlearn of these two Australian Parrots which cannot perch or climb. The\r\nParrot's foot is of interest, further, in so far as it is used as a\r\nhand, and the food is held in it while being eaten. The powerful bill\r\nnot only serves to reduce its food to powder, but also assists in\r\nclimbing. It is sometimes amusing to note the \"absurd caution,\" and\r\ngreat deliberation with which a parrot climbs down in his cage to pick\r\nup some dainty.\r\n\r\nPossessing no less than 76 kinds of Parrots and Cockatoos, Australians\r\nshould be alive to their privileges as contrasted with the dwellers of\r\nnorthern lands, where Parrots do not live. They should insist on the\r\nproper protection of these beautiful and wonderful birds.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n  [Page 88]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: [184] [185] [186] [187] [188]]\r\n\r\n    ORDER XVII.--PSITTACIFORMES.\r\n\r\n    F. 72. _Nestoridae_, Nestor, Kaka, Kea, 4 sp.

A. (N.Z.).\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\nAustralia is well represented in Order XVIII.--Picarian Birds. The\r\nTawny Frogmouth is one of \"the most peculiar,\" and is the \"ugliest of\r\nbirds.\" On account of its wide mouth, it is called the Frogmouth, and\r\non account of the confusion connecting it with the Boobook Owl, which\r\ncalls \"Mopoke,\" this bird is also called the \"Mopoke\" (see p. 85).\r\nIt so closely mimics a broken branch during the day that it is seldom\r\nseen, though it is fairly common.\r\n\r\nGould bears eloquent testimony to the value of Australian birds in\r\ngeneral, and the _Podargus_ in particular, when he says: \"In no other\r\ncountry is there a greater proportion of insectivorous birds, and\r\ncertainly none in which nocturnal species such as the Podargi are more\r\nnumerous.\"\r\n\r\nThe Australian Roller (Dollar-Bird) has the family beauty, and has a\r\nwhite circular patch on each wing, which shows clearly when the wing\r\nis expanded during flight. At the Tallangatta excursion a pair was\r\nworking even after dusk near the schoolground. Flying from the topmost\r\ndead branch, one bird suddenly closed its wings, and cut queer antics\r\nin the air. After flying a considerable distance, it returned to its\r\nformer perch, and the mate set off. On the return of the mate the\r\nfirst set off again, and so on. With their disagreeable, rough \"treek\r\ntreek,\" and peculiar antics, they are conspicuous birds. It is our one\r\nrepresentative of a family most strongly developed in Africa.\r\n\r\nWhile Kingfishers are cosmopolitan (world-wide in distribution), yet\r\nthe Australian region contains far more of these beautiful birds than\r\nany other region. They are famous in legend and story, and we owe to\r\nthem the expression, \"halcyon days\" (Gr. _alkuon_, a Kingfisher).\r\n\r\nThe great terrestrial Kingfishers, of which Australia has three\r\nspecies--the fourth being confined to New Guinea--are amongst the\r\navine curiosities of Australia. Few birds are more famous than the\r\nLaughing Kingfisher (Jackass), first, on account of his gigantic\r\nsize--hence his specific name, _gigas_--and, secondly, because of\r\nhis laugh, which brightens many a gloomy, misty day in lonely country\r\ndistricts. Homesick travellers from foreign lands could only hear\r\nevil spirits laughing at their trials and loneliness, but, just as\r\nmountains, once thought ugly, are now considered beautiful, so\r\nother thoughts are now associated with the laugh of our remarkable\r\nAustralian Kingfisher.\r\n\r\nTrue to the law of representatives, Australia presents us with a\r\nbeautiful representative of the Old World family of Bee-eaters. A\r\nwriter has well said that there are \"few so beautiful, and none so\r\ngraceful.\" Its scientific name, _ornatus_, shows that our bird stands\r\nwell amongst its fellows. One kind occasionally visits England (about\r\nthirty records in the last hundred years).\r\n\r\nIn the same order come the Goatsuckers, or Nightjars, wide-mouthed,\r\nswift-flying, insectivorous birds, which have an almost cosmopolitan\r\nrange, being absent only from New Zealand and the Polynesian Islands.\r\nThese Owl-like birds have very long wings, thus indicating their rapid\r\nflight. They are very valuable insect destroyers, though they are\r\nsometimes called \"Night Hawks,\" and are shot by people who foolishly\r\nshoot hawks. Many destructive insects fly only at night, and these\r\nnight-flying birds are a necessity to maintain the balance of Nature.\r\n\r\nSwifts are cosmopolitan birds. One Swiftlet is world-famous on account\r\nof its saliva-built nest, which is the edible swallows' nest we used\r\nto read about. This bird occasionally visits Queensland. Two of the\r\nAustralian birds breed in Japan. They are essentially creatures of\r\nthe air; their long, pointed wings, shown much longer than the tail,\r\nindicate great speed. Gould said that a Swift might be hawking for\r\ninsects over Victoria one hour, and over Tasmania the next hour; that\r\nis, it can cross Bass Strait in an hour. The spines at the end of\r\nthe short tail feathers are thought to assist as a prop when the bird\r\nsettles on a wall or a cliff face. In some Swifts the four toes point\r\nforward; this helps also in cliff clinging. Though so common in the\r\nupper air, Swifts have not, in Victoria, been recorded as having been\r\nseen to alight.\r\n\r\nMost birds have hollow bones which are filled with air. It was claimed\r\nby those who like to find a use for everything that this was an\r\nobvious adaptation for purposes of flight, but when one reflects that,\r\nin some of the Ostrich and Emu group, the members of which never fly,\r\nthe bones are strongly \"pneumatic,\" while in Terns and Swifts, and\r\nsome other flying birds, the bones are solid, one must hesitate before\r\ngeneralizing even about such an apparently obvious matter. Swifts are\r\nin no way related to Swallows, but are close to Humming Birds, which\r\nare born with a wide, Swift-like mouth.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n  [Page 104]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: [217] [218] [219] [220] [221] [222]]\r\n\r\n    ORDER XVIII.--CORACIIFORMES, PICARIAN BIRDS.\r\n\r\n    F. 78. _Steatornithidae_, Oil-Bird, Guacharo, 1 sp.

To dwellers in lands with a dreary winter, the Cuckoo\r\nheralds the spring, so its call is most welcome. Then, too, the\r\nmysteries connected with its upbringing have proved of interest to\r\nall Nature and bird lovers. Its call, \"Cuckoo,\" aptly described as the\r\n\"most imitable of bird calls,\" has also assisted in making the bird a\r\nfavorite.\r\n\r\nThe Pallid Cuckoo belongs to the same genus as the well-known Cuckoo\r\nof England. It also resembles that bird in appearance. Its note,\r\nhowever, is quite different. At times it seems to be endeavoring to\r\nrun up a chromatic scale, so, in some districts, it is called the\r\nScale Bird. At other times, after three running notes, it repeats one\r\nnote strongly. So persistent is it in calling that it is called in\r\nplaces the Brain-fever Bird. Last September, in Castlemaine, it called\r\nall night in the street trees. Few, however, seemed to notice it, and\r\nfewer still knew what was uttering the persistent call.\r\n\r\nPossibly other birds recognize the Cuckoo as an enemy, or possibly its\r\nremarkable superficial resemblance to a Hawk causes birds to chase it.\r\nHowever, in some cases, possibly, the male Cuckoo does not object to\r\nbeing chased. He draws the birds away, while the female Cuckoo quietly\r\nplaces an egg in a convenient nest, and retires unmolested.\r\n\r\nThe Fan-tailed or Ash-colored Cuckoo is not so conspicuous, as it\r\nkeeps to more secluded places, and is a solitary bird. Its flight is\r\nheavy and labored. It also has a habit of elevating and lowering\r\nits tail several times both before and after flight. Its frequent,\r\nplaintive, trilling note often reveals its presence, which would\r\notherwise be overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe Brush Cuckoo is rare. In fact, considerable difficulty was\r\nexperienced in obtaining a specimen for the photograph above, as\r\nthere was no named specimen in the National Museum. Thanks to Messrs.\r\nKershaw and French, the difficulty was at last overcome.\r\n\r\nThe Bronze Cuckoos are very similar. They will be immediately\r\nrecognized by the under-surface barred brown and white, and the\r\ngolden-green or bronze lustre of the dark back. The New Zealand\r\nBronze-Cuckoo migrates from N.E. Australia and New Guinea. Apparently\r\nit sometimes migrates down the East Coast, instead of to New Zealand.\r\n\r\nThe Narrow-billed Bronze Cuckoo has a narrower bill, and the centre\r\ntail feathers are brownish-chestnut at the base. While the birds are\r\nso similar, their eggs are quite unlike. The Bronze Cuckoo lays a\r\nbronze egg, generally in dome-shaped or covered nests. It is\r\nsometimes found in Tits' nests. The Narrow-billed Bronze Cuckoo has a\r\nred-speckled egg, which is placed often in an open or cup-shaped nest.\r\n\r\nThe last Cuckoo--the Channel-bill--is one of the largest of Cuckoos.\r\nIt is a northern bird, which very rarely reaches the southern part of\r\nthe continent. Its large bill is characteristic. Its tail is large,\r\nand often spread out fanwise, thus giving a majestic appearance to\r\nthe bird. Its call is not pleasing, as it is described by Gould as a\r\n\"frightful scream,\" and again as consisting of \"awful notes.\" It lays\r\nits eggs sometimes in the nest of a Sparrowhawk (not Kestrel), or in\r\nthe nest of a Magpie, Bell-Magpie (_Strepera_), or even of a Crow. It\r\nappears with the first flood-waters, and follows the rivers from the\r\nGulf of Carpentaria watershed down to Cooper's Creek and Lake Eyre.\r\n\r\nOne large Australian Cuckoo builds its own nest, and rears its own\r\nyoung. This bird, however, does not visit Southern Australia.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the interest of their habits and life history, Cuckoos\r\nare amongst the most valuable of insectivorous birds. Few birds will\r\neat the vine caterpillar or hairy caterpillar. The Cuckoos, however,\r\nare very fond of these, and so should be encouraged. They do no harm\r\nto anything we need.\r\n\r\n    ====\r\n\r\n  [Page 108]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: [229] [230] [231] [232]]\r\n\r\n    ORDER XIX.--COCCYGES.\r\n\r\n    F. 95. _Musophagidae_, Plantain-eaters, Touracos, 35 sp.

O. The only family\r\n    of birds restricted to the Oriental Region.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting birds in the world is the Lyre Bird, whose\r\nbeautiful tail, alas, often brings early death to its rightful owner.\r\nThere are three species of these birds, found only in the mountainous\r\nparts of South-eastern Australia, and as far as Wide Bay, in Southern\r\nQueensland. Two of the species are found in New South Wales and\r\nSouthern Queensland, while the third is found in Victoria. Though\r\nthese beautiful birds are supposed to be protected, hundreds of their\r\ntails are sold annually in London.\r\n\r\nThe Lyre Bird is responsible for the statement that Australia\r\npossesses \"Wrens as large as peacocks,\" whereas most Wrens are very\r\nsmall. However, the Lyre Bird is not now classed with Wrens. In all\r\nits ways, the Lyre Bird is of interest. Its dancing mounds, its large\r\ndomed nest, containing but one egg, and its remarkable mimicking\r\npowers have frequently been written about. Dr. Sharpe has lately\r\nplaced the Lyre Birds in an Order by themselves--Order XX.\r\n\r\nGould considered the Lyre Bird the most shy of birds, for he spent\r\ndays in the forest gullies surrounded by them, but though he was\r\nentertained by their many and varied calls, he caught no sight of a\r\nbird. The wonderful tail is not attained until the male bird is four\r\nyears old. It is unique, and is the most beautiful tail ornament worn\r\nby any bird. Dr. Newton hoped that \"so remarkable a form as the Lyre\r\nBird, the nearly sole survivor, apparently, of a very ancient race\r\nof beings, will not be allowed to become extinct--its almost certain\r\nfate, so far as can be judged--without many more observations of its\r\nmanners being made, and fuller details of them placed on record.\"\r\nAustralians please note. You alone can assist by collecting facts and\r\nrecording reliable observations. Bird-lovers hope that the Lyre\r\nBird will be successfully established in the National Park, Wilson's\r\nPromontory, where some have already been placed, and so be preserved\r\nfor future generations. Its large, domed nest is usually placed on the\r\nground, and the large single egg (or the young one) is often taken by\r\nthe fox. Further, its natural haunts--dense forest scrubs--are\r\nbeing rapidly cleared, so that the bird is doomed, except in special\r\nsanctuaries.\r\n\r\nThe Lyre Bird is now generally acknowledged to be the prince of\r\nmocking birds. It mimics clearly all bush noises, the chopping of\r\ntrees, sawing of logs, barking of dogs, clucking of hens, the singing\r\nof native birds. Its dancing mounds are interesting. Near one of\r\nthese mounds, on the Upper Snowy River, in the wild cherry scrub, we\r\nobserved a nest at a height of about thirty feet from the ground.\r\n\r\nAustralians! you owe it to mankind in general to see that the\r\nprotection supposed to be given to the Lyre Bird is a reality.\r\nRecently, after passing a lady much bedecked with Bird of Paradise\r\nplumes, I thought it was fortunate the Lyre Bird's tail was too large\r\nfor a lady's hat. Imagine my surprise when, at the next street corner\r\n(Collins and Spring Streets), I met a lady with a Lyre Bird's tail\r\nstuck through her head-dress. However, I have seen no other tail used\r\nfor such a purpose.\r\n\r\nIn America the Audubon Society has done splendid work by disseminating\r\nknowledge about American birds, and arousing public interest in the\r\nvalue of birds. There, also, thorough scientific investigation has\r\nbeen made of the value of insect-eating and seed-eating birds. It has\r\nbeen stated, as the result of full research, that one wild pigeon,\r\nin whose crop over 7000 weed seeds were found, was as efficacious in\r\ndestroying weeds as two farm laborers.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that no less an agricultural authority than\r\nProfessor Gilruth, of the Veterinary School, Melbourne University, has\r\ngiven it as his deliberate opinion that the Australian farmer would\r\nfind life impossible without the aid of the detested Sparrow as a weed\r\ndestroyer. This is the judgment of a man whose opinion is worthy of\r\nserious consideration.\r\n\r\nIt is open to serious doubt if it pays commercially to kill\r\nindiscriminately any kind of bird found on this continent. It may,\r\nof course, happen that one individual bird has learnt where to get an\r\neasy food supply at the expense of a farmer or orchardist. Such a bird\r\ncould be kept away. To kill birds at all times, because of the damage\r\ndone by a few at a particular time, is foolish.\r\n\r\nOn the lines of the American Audubon Society, the Gould League of Bird\r\nLovers has recently been established. Just as Audubon was the great\r\nfather of American ornithology, so \"John Gould, the bird man,\" was the\r\nfather of Australian ornithology. Hence his name has been associated\r\nwith this movement to save our birds. The movement is progressing by\r\nleaps and bounds.\r\n\r\nThe Victorian branch has a very large body of members, about 40,000\r\ncertificates having already been issued to adults and children.\r\nTasmania has a branch in full operation. In South Australia bird clubs\r\nare doing excellent work, especially amongst the young people, and\r\nQueensland and New South Wales bird-lovers have taken active steps\r\nto develop the movement in their States. A Bird Day, by order of the\r\nMinister of Education, Hon. A. A. Billson, and the Director, Mr.\r\nF. Tate, was observed in Victorian schools in 1909 and 1910, with\r\ngratifying results. Bird-nesting, for the collection of eggs, has\r\npractically wholly disappeared from our schools, while at most country\r\nschools native birds can be seen nesting on the school grounds, the\r\nchildren keeping observation notes of nesting and feeding habits of\r\nthe birds as part of their work in Nature-study. What study is of\r\ngreater economic importance to this wealthy, though occasionally\r\ninsect-troubled, land?\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n  [Page 112]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: [237]]\r\n\r\n\r\n    ORDER XX.--MENURIFORMES, LYRE-BIRDS.\r\n\r\n    F. 104.

As Perching-Birds\r\n(_Passeres_) are still undergoing evolution, connecting links still\r\nlive, so that it is very difficult to divide the Perching Birds\r\ninto well-defined families. Sharpe has divided them into sixty-one\r\nfamilies, but, for several of these, no exact characters that exclude\r\nother birds can be assigned, so that some of these, at least, are \"not\r\nworthy of family rank.\" However, Sharpe's classification represents\r\nthe latest thought of scientists on this difficult matter, so it must\r\nbe adopted here.\r\n\r\nThis large order of birds is divided into two sub-orders:--\r\n\r\n1. Songless Perching-Birds, made up mainly of South American\r\nbirds, though two families are included that are represented in the\r\nAustralian region--_viz._, Pittas (_Pittidae_) and New Zealand Wrens\r\n(_Xenicidae_).\r\n\r\n2. Song-Birds.\r\n\r\nBirds of the second division are again divided into two:--A.: Abnormal\r\nSong-Birds. B.: Normal Song-Birds.\r\n\r\nThe first group, Abnormal Song-Birds, comprises only the two\r\nremarkable Scrub-Birds (_Atrichornithidae_) of Australia. One of these\r\ninhabits West Australian scrubs only, while the other inhabits East\r\nAustralian (Richmond River) scrubs only.\r\n\r\nThe breast bone and the muscles of the voice apparatus are unusual.\r\nThese birds are about the size of a thrush, and form \"one of the most\r\ncurious ornithological types of the many furnished by that country\"\r\n(Australia).\r\n\r\nSo far, no female bird has been examined, and little is known about\r\nthese remarkable, noisy, scrub-haunting birds.\r\n\r\nThe remaining forty-eight \"families\" of birds belong to the Normal\r\nSong-Birds. It is interesting to note that Australia contains\r\nrepresentatives of twenty-nine families of Song-Birds. Representatives\r\nof but nineteen families have been recorded from Britain. The Indian\r\nEmpire, including Burmah and Ceylon, contains representatives of\r\ntwenty-two families, North America, also, of twenty-two families,\r\nwhile in South America twenty-three families are represented in this\r\nhighest division of birds.\r\n\r\nAgain, while only 89 Song-Birds have been recorded as permanent\r\nresidents of, or regular visitors to, Britain, almost 500 species of\r\nSong-Birds have, so far, been recorded from Australia and Tasmania.\r\nOf these, 157 have been recorded from Victoria, and are illustrated in\r\nthis volume. And yet, we are told, this is a land of songless birds.\r\n\r\nSwallows have always attracted much notice, perhaps, because of their\r\nairy play when enjoying themselves after their long migration flight.\r\nIt is very difficult to realize that Cuvier and most scientists of\r\none hundred years ago believed that Swallows hibernated by burying\r\nthemselves in the mud in the bottom of lakes and pools. It is\r\ninteresting to note, in Gilbert White's _Natural History of Selborne_,\r\nthe growing doubt concerning this belief; but, as it was supported by\r\napparently good authority, he is cautious. Fuller observation shows\r\nthat there are well-marked lines of migration, so that the European\r\nSwallow migrates sometimes even as far as South Africa, and the\r\nSwallows of North Asia are said to migrate even to Australia. However,\r\nin our winterless clime, migration is not complete, and this year\r\n(1910) there was probably little migration of Swallows. As Swallows\r\nare such rapid fliers, and spend much of their time on the wing, it is\r\nnot a matter of surprise to find that they have spread the world over,\r\nexcept to New Zealand, though Tree Swallows are said to reach even\r\nthat distant land occasionally.\r\n\r\nThe Australian members of the Swallow family present very different\r\nnesting habits. While the Welcome Swallow builds the well-known\r\ncup-like mud nest, the rare White-backed Swallow drills a two-inch\r\nhole into a bank for two or three feet, and there builds its nest. The\r\nTree Martin (Swallow), on the other hand, makes no nest, but lays its\r\neggs on leaves placed on the rotten wood in the hollow of a tree. The\r\nFairy Martin builds a long, bottle-shaped mud flask, under a bridge,\r\nor a ledge, and so is sometimes called the Bottle or Retort Swallow.\r\nWood-Swallows and Swifts do not belong to the Swallow family.\r\n\r\nThe Flycatcher family is a large one, nearly 700 species being\r\naccepted by Dr. Sharpe. More than half of these are restricted to the\r\nAustralian region.\r\n\r\nThe Brown Flycatcher is almost as common as the Willie Wagtail (Black\r\nand White Fantail). The white feather on each side of the tail is a\r\nvaluable guide, though the Groundlark also has this. So often does it\r\nsit on fence posts looking at the passer-by that it has been called\r\nthe \"Post-Sitter.\" Its Sydney name, Jacky Winter, is less formal than\r\nBrown Flycatcher--a name which is already in use for another bird.\r\n\r\nThe Robin Redbreast of Britain is regarded with affection by all\r\nEnglish children. That feeling has been transferred to the externally\r\nslightly similar \"Robin Redbreasts\" of this country, though they are\r\nnot at all related to the British Robins. Redbreast is really the name\r\nof the English bird, and Robin is perhaps a term of endearment added\r\nto the name Redbreast. While the British bird has a rufous breast, the\r\nAustralian birds have a scarlet breast, and are much handsomer birds.\r\nThe British Robin is now placed in the Thrush family.\r\n\r\nOnce given to members of this family, the name Robin has been adopted\r\nfor related birds that have no red--_e.g._, the black and white Hooded\r\nRobin, and the Tasmanian Dusky Robin. The Shrike Robins belong to the\r\nShrike family, so they need not be mentioned here. The Scrub Robin of\r\nthe inland dry scrubs belongs to the same family as the Coachwhip Bird\r\nand the Babbler.\r\n\r\nThe Fantails and some, at least, of the Flycatchers proper are known\r\nto all. Who does not know and admire the plucky, though fussy Black\r\nand White Fantail (Willie Wagtail), as it drives a cat or a dog away\r\nfrom the vicinity of its nest, or as it waits impatiently about the\r\nmouth of a grazing cow or horse, or as it expresses its opinion of\r\nitself in the melodious \"sweet, pretty creature,\" heard even late on\r\nmoonlight nights? The friendly White-shafted Fantail is almost as\r\nwell known, as it flits about a camp or catches flies near some\r\nwater-course.\r\n\r\nAt the Summer School, a Fantail spent some time each day in the\r\ndining-tent. The beautiful Rufous Fantail is just as tame, but is not\r\nquite so common. The nests of the White-shafted and Rufous Fantails\r\nare things of beauty. The long wine-glass stem is said by some to\r\nserve to drain the water away down from the nest, or as a means of\r\ncarrying the eye down from the nest itself, so that it is seldom\r\nseen, or as a balance, so that the nest is not tilted too far in windy\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nThe Scissors Grinder, or Restless Flycatcher, is very much like a\r\nBlack and White Fantail, but the throat is white, while that of the\r\nFantail is black. The Grinder is often mentioned in popular books on\r\nbird-life, on account of its peculiar scissors-grinding note uttered\r\nwhile hovering in search of insects.\r\n\r\n(continued below)\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n  [Page 113]\r\n\r\n    ORDER XXI.--PASSERIFORMES, PERCHING BIRDS.\r\n\r\n    F. 105. _Pteroptochidae_, Tapaculos, Tilt-birds, 31 sp.

(continued)\r\n\r\nMore than half the species of birds making up the family of\r\nCaterpillar-eaters are restricted to the Australian region.\r\n\r\nThe common Black-faced Cuckoo-Shrike has many names. Leatherhead, Blue\r\nPigeon, and Blue Jay are amongst the most common, and all are\r\nwrong. The Leatherhead is a Honey-eater, and is better known as the\r\nFriar-Bird. The Cuckoo-Shrike is not a Pigeon, but is a perching bird;\r\nnor is it a Jay, which is a Northern Hemisphere bird, a member of the\r\nCrow family.\r\n\r\nThe Black-faced Cuckoo-Shrike is partly migratory, being stationary\r\nin the northern parts of its range, but migratory in the south. It\r\noccasionally reaches New Zealand. These birds undergo many changes of\r\nplumage before assuming the adult dress. The Little Cuckoo-Shrike,\r\nin particular, has several plumage phases, the throat and neck being\r\nblack in the young, but gray in the adult. Its Cuckoo-like flight\r\nundoubtedly suggested part of the name. When young males are unlike\r\nthe adult males, they usually resemble the female. Here, however, the\r\nadults of both sexes are similar.\r\n\r\nThe male White-shouldered Caterpillar-eater resembles a Hooded Robin\r\n(249). It is supposed to be shy, but at the Tallangatta excursion,\r\ntwo pairs were attending to domestic duties in the school ground and\r\nsurprised all by their fine musical performances. The male called\r\n\"Peter, Peter,\" or some syllabize it \"Pretty Joey,\" and then broke\r\ninto a trilling song that fully equalled any canary performance I have\r\nheard. This was repeated frequently during the day. The female seemed\r\nto have a creak in her note, which, however, was musical. The bill is\r\nslender in this species.\r\n\r\nThe Jardine Caterpillar-eater is rare and very shy. It keeps to the\r\ntopmost branches of lofty trees. The male is dark blue-gray and black,\r\nand has a strong bill. The brown female is quite dissimilar, her\r\nwhitish under surface being crossed with numerous brown arrow-head\r\nmarkings.\r\n\r\nThe Cuckoo-Shrikes and Caterpillar-eaters are, like the Cuckoos, very\r\nfond of caterpillars, and so should receive all the protection we can\r\ngive them.\r\n\r\n(continued below)\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n  [Page 126]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: [261] [262] [263] [264] [265] [265^A]]\r\n\r\n    F. 120.

(continued)\r\n\r\nThe family _Timeliidae_ is an ill-defined one, the members of which\r\nare mostly ground birds, or, at least, spend a good deal of time on\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nThe Spotted and Chestnut-backed Ground-Birds are rare and are very\r\nquiet and shy as they run back under the shade of a bush. Thus,\r\nthey are seldom seen, though they are very beautiful in their\r\nrichly-spotted plumage. Driving along mallee roads, one sometimes sees\r\nthese birds make a short, quick run to cover. A good name is required\r\nfor them. Ground-Bird is not very definite.\r\n\r\nThe rich brown Pilot Bird rarely flies, but keeps low down in the\r\ndense tangles and undergrowths in country like that about Ferntree\r\nGully. It must be patiently waited for, as it is very shy.\r\nIt, apparently, values its services highly, for it often calls\r\n\"A-guinea-a-week.\"\r\n\r\nThe larger Scrub-Robin which lives only in the interior flies little,\r\nbut, as shown in the figure, it has long legs, suitable for running.\r\nIts color is not the dark-brown suitable for dark scrubs, but is the\r\nlight-brown which matches the dead mallee twigs lying so thickly on\r\nthe ground under the scrub. We met the Scrub-Robin on Eyre Peninsula,\r\nbut it was difficult to get a second look at it. Almost as rare are\r\nthe closely-similar Chestnut-rumped and Red-rumped Ground-Wrens. Few\r\nwill see these birds, as they live only in the drier parts.\r\n\r\nThat interesting bird--the Coachwhip Bird--is far more often heard\r\nthan seen. Along the densely-scrubbed creeks of Eastern Australia,\r\nthe interesting whip-crack of this bird is very often heard. An exact\r\nrepresentative lives in West Australian scrubs. I was surprised\r\nto hear, in several places lately, the Rufous-breasted Whistler\r\n(Thickhead) called the Coachwhip Bird. It has been found that both\r\nbirds take part in the peculiar call which has a loud crack very like\r\nthat of a whip. This bird dwells in the dense eastern scrubs, and uses\r\nits short wings but little for flight. It was seen, however, recently\r\nat Sandringham, a few miles from Melbourne.\r\n\r\nThe Australian Babblers are of interest from all points of view. Their\r\nhabits are peculiar; their calls are varied and usually pleasant, and\r\ntheir large domed stick nests are common objects along a country road.\r\nUsually seen in companies of from four to a dozen, these birds work\r\nenergetically and systematically. They are entirely insectivorous, and\r\nso are of great value economically. They are tame, as I have watched a\r\nflock at work in the gardens in the middle of a town such as Dunolly.\r\nThey occasionally visit orchards and attack the codlin moth pupae.\r\nThey are said never to squabble, and so are called \"Happy Family\"\r\nor \"Happy Jacks.\" Their names, however, are many. The commonest is,\r\nperhaps, \"Catbird.\" There is a \"Catbird,\" a Bower-Bird, in Queensland,\r\nso the use of that name should be discouraged. Babblers sometimes\r\nmake six or seven nests, laying only in one. The others are said to\r\nbe shelter nests, or possibly play nests.\r\n\r\nThat pleasing songster--the White-browed Field-Wren--is uniformly\r\nstreaked with black both above and below. It is fairly common, but is\r\nnot often seen unless looked for. Dogs will follow the scent of this\r\nbird, as they do that of a quail; so it is sometimes called the\r\nStink-Bird by sportsmen.\r\n\r\nNow we come to two of the four native Skylarks. Who has not, while\r\nlying on his back on the grass enjoying a rest in the warm sunshine,\r\nfelt pleasure at the beautiful song of the Rufous Song-Lark as\r\nit soars singing away so high overhead? The British Skylark often\r\nreceives the credit for the harmony of our four Skylarks. Two belong\r\nto this family, and two come later with the Larks and Pipits. One\r\nis larger and darker on the breast, hence the name Black-breasted\r\nSong-Lark. I saw many of these birds, when examining the glacial\r\ndeposits at Hallet's Cove, near Adelaide. As there was a continuous\r\nchorus of these fine songsters above the crops, the reason for the\r\nname Harvest Birds was apparent.\r\n\r\nThe Thrush family (_Turdidae_) includes the British Song-Thrush,\r\nBlackbird, Nightingale, and many other famous songsters, The\r\nAustralian Mountain-Thrush is larger and more prettily marked, but is\r\nnot such a good songster as its European cousin--the Song-Thrush. It,\r\nhowever, has one of its calls closely similar to one of the calls of\r\nits more famous relative. It is a quiet, shy bird, though I walked\r\nwithin five feet of one this morning as it was busy digging up worms\r\non the lawn in the Melbourne Botanic Gardens. I left it at work\r\npleased that my presence had caused no feeling of fear in so beautiful\r\nand so shy a bird. Its beautiful moss-covered nest is built even\r\nso early as July. It flies little, preferring to keep near the dark\r\nscrubs, especially the tea-tree scrub along the coast.\r\n\r\nThe Song-Thrush and Blackbird have been successfully introduced,\r\nand they are common in suburban gardens. Their delightful song makes\r\nricher the lives of busy city dwellers, though their attentions to\r\nsoft fruits are not always appreciated. For sweetness and fulness\r\nof notes, however, these introduced birds cannot compare with our\r\nHarmonious Shrike-Thrush (315), deservedly named _harmonica_ by\r\nLatham, a British ornithologist. The call of the latter bird, however,\r\nis not so continuous as that of the introduced birds.\r\n\r\nThe four Australian birds known as Chats take the next sub-family\r\nto themselves. The common Chat is known as a \"Tang,\" \"Nun,\" and\r\n\"Tin-tac.\" While the White-fronted Chat is very common in the South,\r\nthe beautiful Crimson-breasted Chat, with its crimson cap and pure\r\nwhite throat, and the Orange-fronted Chat, are found mostly in the dry\r\ninterior, where they are known as Salt-bush Canaries. A good common\r\nname is urgently required for this Australian sub-family of birds.\r\nNorth calls them Nuns; but that name is preoccupied, and is suitable\r\nonly for one of them. I was much interested last week (January, 1911)\r\nto see a male White-fronted Chat feeding a fully-fledged young Bronze\r\nCuckoo. Two female Sparrows were also in attendance, one of which\r\nfed the Cuckoo three times while I was observing it. A female Bronze\r\nCuckoo sat for some time by the young one, but did not interfere, or\r\noffer to feed it. The Chat returned the fifth time for the purpose of\r\nfeeding the young Cuckoo, when the passing of a motor-car broke up the\r\nparty. The young Cuckoo flew across the road and some distance on to\r\na bush, where it resumed its constant wheezing whine. It is unusual to\r\nfind birds so far apart as a Finch, like the Sparrow and a member of\r\nthe Thrush family, like the Chat, feeding the one young Cuckoo.\r\n\r\n(continued below)\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n  [Page 128]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: [266] [267] [268] [269] [270] [271] [272]]\r\n\r\n    F. 122.

One migratory species crosses Behring Strait each\r\nyear to summer in Alaska.\r\n\r\nAs no less than 79 Australian small birds have been grouped in this\r\nfamily, it is of considerable importance to our bird lovers. At\r\nthe head of the family, we have an exact representative of the\r\nReed-Warbler of Europe in the delightful plain-brown songster which\r\ncharms all who frequent river sides. Its song is \"louder and more\r\nmelodious than that of any of its European relations except\" the\r\nReed-Warbler. It is a welcome spring visitor, and can be heard on any\r\nspring or summer day in the Botanic Gardens, or in any reed bed by\r\nstream or lake.\r\n\r\nThe next bird is the Australian representative of the Fantail-Warblers\r\n(_Cisticola_). These birds are related to the Tailor-Bird.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written of the Tailor-Bird of India which so cleverly\r\nsews leaves together to enclose its nest, but few know we have a bird\r\nthat does similar work when building its nest. Dr. Sharpe has decided\r\nthat our bird is identical with an Indian species, so we must take the\r\nIndian name--Golden-headed Fantail-Warbler. This bird moults twice\r\na year. At the autumn moult, it obtains a long tail and a streaked\r\ncrown. The four Australian species described by Gould are now known\r\nto be but different forms of the one species which undergoes seasonal\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nSpeckled Jack, the Speckled Warbler (Little Field-Wren), is a tame\r\nlittle bird with a pleasing song. Its chocolate-colored egg used to\r\nbe much valued in the days when schoolboys collected eggs. It walks\r\ninstead of hopping.\r\n\r\nThe Yellow-tailed Tit-Warbler (_Acanthiza_) is a member of an\r\nAustralian genus, which has been split up into 27 species, all of\r\nwhich, except a New Guinea form, are restricted to Australia. Some are\r\npleasing songsters. The two-storied nest of the Yellow-tail is well\r\nknown and is peculiar. What is the use of the upper nest--for the male\r\nto rest in, to delude the cuckoo, or what?\r\n\r\nThese birds are not Tits (_Paridae_). They have been called Thornbills\r\nby Mr. A. J. North. The name Tit-Warbler has been adopted by the\r\n\"names\" sub-committee of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists'\r\nUnion, pending the completion of the Australian Check-List. The common\r\nWhite-browed Scrub-Wren is not a Wren, but is a Warbler. He is the\r\nbest known of the genus, though even he is seldom seen. His dark-brown\r\ncolor leads one to suspect a dark scrub as his dwelling place. Though\r\ncommon in places, he is seldom noticed, but if you sit down in a quiet\r\nscrubby corner, his inquisitiveness will often impel him to run almost\r\nover your feet. Some light spots on the shoulder and the white eyebrow\r\nwill assist you in identifying him. His mouse-like run further assists\r\nin identification.\r\n\r\nAmongst the glories of the bird world, the Superb-Warbler stands high.\r\nHis beautiful enamel-blue and black costume, and his cheery, fussy\r\nsong justify his name. He is generally accompanied by four or five\r\nplain-colored mates, and is said to lose his beautiful coat of blue\r\neach autumn, but the balance of evidence now seems to be with\r\nMr. Keartland and Dr. Horne, who claim that he gets the permanent\r\nbeautiful coat late in life (that is, when three or four years old),\r\nand does not lose it afterwards, except for a few days at moulting\r\ntime. But, being so conspicuous, he soon falls a prey to one of his\r\nnumerous enemies, of whom the small boy with a pea-rifle is probably\r\nthe worst. I, too frequently, hear of these enemies of their country\r\nbeing caught with three or four of these lovely little birds in their\r\npossession. However, Bird Day in the schools did much good, and the\r\nnext generation of boy will probably have less of the savage in him.\r\n\r\nThe Emu-Wren, which has tail feathers like Emu feathers, is easily\r\nrecognized if seen. It is difficult to cause it to fly out of the\r\nrushes round a swamp. The Bristle-Birds are Australian, and are fairly\r\ncommon in some dense scrubs.\r\n\r\nGrass-Wrens are not Wrens, but are placed in the Warbler family. They\r\nare Central Australian birds. They seldom fly, but \"progress like a\r\nrubber ball\" with great swiftness. They are of the light tawny color\r\nthat so well matches desert sands. It is very difficult to get a\r\nsecond look at one, as it hides in the grass and scrub, and almost\r\nrefuses to be flushed. Sometimes it nearly allows itself to be walked\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nFourteen of the 17 members of the Wood-Swallow family are confined\r\nto the Australian region. The White-rumped Wood-Swallow extends from\r\nAustralia through the islands to the Andaman Islands; another kind\r\nis found in India, Ceylon, and Burma. Some kinds are migratory. They\r\nappear suddenly in great companies, build a flimsy, careless nest in\r\nany spot high or low, and soon have the young on the wing. They are\r\nthe \"Blue-Birds,\" \"Summer-Birds,\" or \"Martins\" of our youth. Some of\r\nthese birds have the remarkable habit of hanging in a cluster similar\r\nto a great swarm of bees. Like Honey-eaters, they take honey from the\r\nflowering eucalypts. The street trees of Bendigo were alive with these\r\nbirds in May, 1909. The Sordid Wood-Swallow is partly migratory, and\r\nlives in small companies. Most towns in Southern Australia have a\r\ncompany of these birds in the neighborhood. One such company lives in\r\nthe Domain, near the entrance to the Botanic Gardens, Melbourne.\r\n\r\nThese tame woodland birds, admirable in their graceful wheeling and\r\nfloating flight, destroy numbers of destructive insects. Occasionally,\r\na company has discovered that a good food supply can easily be\r\nobtained close to a beehive. Thus rarely they do a slight amount of\r\nharm, but the balance is overwhelmingly in their favor.\r\n\r\n(continued below)\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n    F. 127.

E. (Madagascar).\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\nOrder XXI. (continued)\r\n\r\nFamily 132--Wood-Shrikes--contains two of the best known of Australian\r\nbirds, for they are to be found about almost every town and city, as\r\nwell as in the country. The well-known Magpie-Lark has but one close\r\ncousin in the world, a New Guinea bird. Its mud nest is familiar to\r\ncountry boys. It is notable that, excepting Swallows, only two other\r\nAustralian birds build a mud nest. These birds, the Apostle-Bird and\r\nthe White-winged Chough, are mentioned later. Its dainty, well-kept\r\nplumage renders the Magpie-Lark one of the most graceful of birds. Its\r\nflight is \"unlike that of any bird known to me.\" (Gould.) \"It flies in\r\na straight line, with a heavy, flapping motion of the wings.\" Its\r\nloud call is responsible for the name of Pee-wee, a common name for\r\na European Plover; its black and white coloring for the vernacular\r\nname--Magpie-Lark.\r\n\r\nThis bird is of great value, as it consumes large quantities of pond\r\nsnails, the necessary host of the early stages of the liver fluke.\r\nExterminate the pond snails, and immediately the liver fluke is\r\ncompletely destroyed, and all future loss from its ravages is saved\r\nto the pastoralists. In 1846, fluke caused a loss of L10,000,000\r\nin England alone, so it is a serious pest, and may yet prove a very\r\nexpensive one to Australia.\r\n\r\nThis bird's scientific position is disputed. It has been classed with\r\nCrows and with Thrushes. Gould placed it by itself. Dr. Sharpe has,\r\nhowever, placed it in the family _Prionopidae_. Its vocal organs are\r\nanomalous, and it may be that its position is not finally settled yet.\r\n\r\nPlaced by Sharpe in the same family are the Shrike-Thrushes, strictly\r\nAustralian birds. The glorious \"powerful swelling notes\" of our common\r\nbird caused Latham to bestow the well-deserved name _harmonica_ on it.\r\nYet there are some who talk of Australia as a land of songless birds.\r\nThis falsehood seems to have had its origin in a note written by\r\nCaley, who, about 1825, collected near Sydney, for the Linnean Society\r\nof London. As quoted by North, he said, \"They (Superb-Warblers) are\r\ngood songsters, and, I may say, almost the only ones in the colony.\"\r\nFortunately, the Harmonious Shrike-Thrush is becoming common and tame\r\nabout school grounds and most towns. It is occasionally to be heard in\r\nthe Melbourne Botanic Gardens.\r\n\r\nFamily 134 contains the famous Shrikes, those birds which are said\r\nto keep a butcher's shop. Not being \"birds of prey,\" they do not hold\r\ntheir prey in their feet, so they fasten it in the fork of a tree, or\r\non a thorn. Then they proceed to eat it, or leave it until they are\r\nhungry. Our Shrike or Butcher-Bird has the same habit.\r\n\r\nThe Australian Butcher-Bird has a rich, mellow, flute-like note, which\r\nis more frequently heard in autumn. Some consider his one of the best\r\nof bird-notes. His strongly-hooked bill renders him a terror to small\r\nbirds, including caged Canaries.\r\n\r\nThat glorious songster, the Australian Magpie, is placed in this\r\nfamily. These Australian songsters are now divided into five\r\nclosely-similar species, all possessing the same rich carol. The\r\nTasmanian bird was formerly called the \"Organ-Bird.\" This Australian\r\nmusician is responsible for the European epigram of \"white Crows that\r\nsing.\" These birds are not Crows, nor are they white, but they _sing_,\r\nso that Alfred Russel Wallace has declared that no European songbird\r\ncan equal them. Gould found it impossible to describe their \"carol,\"\r\nand regretted that \"his readers could not,\" as he had done, \"listen to\r\nthe birds in their native wilds.\" Their early morning carol lives\r\nin the memory. The Australian Magpie is not related to the European\r\nMagpie, which is a member of the Crow family (164), but is a glorified\r\nButcher-Bird. However, it would be a difficult matter to displace the\r\nname magpie for the Australian bird.\r\n\r\nIn the same family, though in the next sub-family, are some peculiar\r\nAustralian birds. The two Shrike-Tits are found one in Eastern\r\nAustralia and the other in Western Australia. Gould said feelingly--he\r\nwas nipped by one--that \"no bird of its size has stronger mandibles.\"\r\nIt is to be seen in the Melbourne Botanic Gardens, tearing off bark as\r\nit seeks for insects.\r\n\r\nThe Crested Bell-Bird is restricted to Australia. Being a perfect\r\nventriloquist, it is very difficult to locate it. Some of its\r\nnotes are bell-like, and have misled those seeking horses. I met it\r\nfrequently in the Mallee and in the Maryborough and Ararat districts.\r\nIt often hopped out on to the road on frosty mornings. It is one of\r\nAustralia's singular and interesting birds.\r\n\r\nThose badly-named, but often attractive, songsters--the Thickheads\r\n(now called Whistlers)--are placed next. Eighty-eight of these birds\r\nare known from the Australian region, though but twenty occur in\r\nAustralia itself and Tasmania. On account of the difficulty of\r\nskinning these birds, they were given the name _Pachycephala_. It is\r\nunfortunate that the literal translation--thick head--was the name\r\nused by bird people for these beautiful singers. It is now proposed to\r\nchange the name to Whistler. Strange to say, we have not heard a good\r\nlocal name for these attractive and often gorgeous birds.\r\n\r\nTo complete this interesting sub-family, we have the Yellow-breasted\r\nShrike-Robin--a confiding favorite, found in most dark scrubs. Its\r\nsingle, often-repeated, piping note is responsible for its name,\r\n_Eopsaltria_, \"Psalm of the Dawn.\" This delightful forest-dweller\r\nfrequently perches sideways on a sapling. Six kinds are known from\r\nAustralia, and two more from adjacent islands.\r\n\r\n(continued below)\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n  [Page 148]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: [314] [314^A] [315] [316] [317] [318] [319]]\r\n\r\n    F. 132.

(continued)\r\n\r\nIn Family 135--Titmice or Tits--Australia has but five\r\nrepresentatives--the peculiar Wedgebill, \"Kitty-lin-tof,\" and the four\r\nAustralian \"Whitefaces.\" The Whiteface is \"lively, with sweet chirping\r\nnotes.\" Its former scientific name (_Xerophila_) means \"dry lover,\"\r\nfor it is found mainly in the drier parts.\r\n\r\nThe European Tits belong to this family, so it is not desirable to use\r\nthe name \"Tit\" for the Australian birds of the genus _Acanthiza_, for\r\nthey belong to the Warbler family (_Sylviidae_), and not to the Tit\r\nfamily (_Paridae_).\r\n\r\nThe Nuthatches of the Old World and America are represented by\r\nclosely-related birds, with somewhat similar habits, in Australia.\r\nThese run spirally down a tree-trunk, searching every crack or piece\r\nof bark. Eight of these birds occur in Australia. Latham called them\r\nNuthatches. It is now proposed to return to this name, as it is used\r\nfor the British, Indian, and North American birds of this family\r\n(_Sittidae_).\r\n\r\nThe male Black-capped Nuthatch (Tree-runner) is true to name, but the\r\nfemale has the head and hind-neck black, instead of a black cap only.\r\nNuthatches are not found in Tasmania. Possibly Bass Strait was formed\r\nbefore they reached Southern Victoria. Thus bird-study supports the\r\ngeographer and ethnologist when they declare that Bass Strait is of\r\ncomparatively remote formation. As the Tasmanian blacks were ignorant\r\nof boats, they evidently reached Tasmania before Bass Strait was\r\nformed. They are a more primitive type than the Australian blacks, who\r\nwere improved by later influxes of more highly-developed Caucasians.\r\n\r\nMany country dwellers will not admit that there is no Woodpecker in\r\nAustralia, but it is a fact, nevertheless. Our so-called \"Woodpecker\"\r\nis the Tree-Creeper. It never chisels mortice-holes in a tree to get\r\nout a grub, as the true Woodpecker does. These birds occur all over\r\nthe continent, and are often to be seen alighting on the side of a\r\ntree or fence post and then running up spirally to the top. They soon\r\nfly off to another tree, alighting lower than the place they started\r\nfrom. The bright-brown band on the wing is conspicuous as they fly.\r\nTheir lively notes brighten a country drive.\r\n\r\nThe White-eye is one of a large genus, for no less than 157 species\r\nhave been accepted by Dr. Sharpe. However, one of the rarest of these\r\nwas a Victorian species. It was based on one specimen, a female, taken\r\nat Marong, near Bendigo. It was said to be slightly different from the\r\ncommon White-eye. Hence Dr. Horne, of Clifton Hill, one of our most\r\nenthusiastic bird-lovers, created a new species, and named it in honor\r\nof his niece, Miss Bowie, who is a favorite with all the birds in\r\nDr. Horne's extensive aviaries. White-eyes are found from Africa\r\nand Madagascar to India and Japan, and from Australia out past New\r\nZealand.\r\n\r\nOur common White-eye is one of the interesting birds of the world at\r\nthe present time, for it is showing that man is not the only animal\r\nwith a colonizing instinct. It was unknown in New Zealand until, in\r\n1856, it was first recorded. The Maoris, keen Nature-students,\r\nwho have a name for every native animal and plant, called it the\r\n\"Stranger.\" Its presence has been accounted for by some authorities as\r\nbeing due to the fierce winds that accompanied Black Thursday having\r\nblown it over from Australia. However, not satisfied with spreading\r\nthroughout New Zealand until it is said to be the commonest bird\r\nthere, it has spread out to Chatham Island, and a flock was reported\r\nrecently a considerable distance from the coast, apparently looking\r\nfor fresh fields, or rather islands, to colonize. It is a well-known\r\ncity dweller. Though it destroys grapes and other soft fruits, it also\r\nso completely destroys aphides that it is appropriately called the\r\nBlight-Bird. Again, the balance is strongly in its favor, for it is\r\nprobably but taking fair toll of that which will probably not have\r\nreached maturity but for its labors, and the laborer, even if a bird,\r\nis worthy of his hire.\r\n\r\nA bird's color usually affords it protection from its natural enemies.\r\nThese are mainly birds of prey flying overhead. Thus, speaking\r\ngenerally, protective coloration applies only to the upper surface,\r\nso that a white throat or under surface does not necessarily render a\r\nbird conspicuous to its natural enemies.\r\n\r\nAgain, a bird may be very conspicuous when seen away from its natural\r\nsurroundings, but the concealment may be perfect under natural\r\nconditions. It has been already mentioned that the gorgeous Blue\r\nMountain Lorikeet was very difficult to discern in its native\r\nsugar-gums. A tiger is said to be invisible at a distance of ten yards\r\nin a jungle; the black stripes being similar to the shadows of the\r\nbamboos, and the light bands to the sunlight between the vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe White-eye and Tree-Creepers just noticed may be considered\r\nprotectively colored, for they are difficult to see in a tree. Still,\r\nthe brown patch on the wing of the Tree-Creeper is conspicuous as it\r\nflies. Alfred Russel Wallace, the great evolutionist, supplied a\r\ngood explanation, when he regarded bright wing bands, white rump,\r\nand white-tipped tail, as \"warning colors.\" An enemy is, perchance,\r\nperceived by a bird. This individual flies away quietly; others see\r\nthe bright wing patch disappear, and they seek shelter as quickly and\r\nquietly as possible. This is often a great advantage, for, in many\r\ncases, all reach safety, possibly, before the enemy has seen one of\r\nthem. If the first bird had given an alarming call, it would have\r\nwarned the enemy too.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that these bright markings on the upper surface are,\r\nusually, not visible when the bird is at rest. The white wing patch\r\nfolds in, the white rump is covered, while, in a white-tipped tail,\r\nit is usual for the two centre feathers to be plain throughout (see\r\nillustrations of species 313 and 329). The tail is folded, and the\r\nwhite tips are covered by the two non-white centre feathers. The\r\nintroduced Indian Turtle-Dove, common about nearly every city in\r\nAustralia, shows the spread-out, white-tipped tail splendidly when\r\nflying. The bird itself is barely visible if it settles in the shade\r\nor on the soil. The Indian Myna, a city bird, has both white wing-patch\r\nand white-tipped tail.\r\n\r\nThis explanation is also applied to other wild animals; thus many Deer\r\nhave the white patch on the hind quarters. Other Deer, seeing this\r\nwarning signal displayed in flight, immediately make for safety.\r\nSimilarly, Wallace has explained the white tail of a Rabbit.\r\n\r\nThe Skunk also has this white patch on the hind quarters, but here a\r\ndifferent explanation is required, for the Skunk does not trouble\r\nto run away when a possible enemy appears. The bright color is here\r\nregarded as an \"advertizing color.\" The Skunk has other means of\r\nprotection, and he is labelled dangerous or objectionable, just as our\r\none poisonous Spider is plainly labelled dangerous by means of a red\r\nstripe. An inexperienced enemy may rush at the Skunk, but the means\r\nof protection enjoyed by it effectively protects it, and the enemy\r\nretires.\r\n\r\nIt is a rule recognized by collectors that conspicuous animals have\r\ngenerally some effective means of protection, and they are best left\r\nalone, or at least taken with caution. This is readily understood when\r\nit is considered that a young, inexperienced chicken will rush at a\r\nbrightly-colored caterpillar. He then retires, endeavoring to get rid\r\nof the objectionable taste. For the future, he avoids brightly-colored\r\nanimals. Thus the bright color is an obvious advantage to its\r\npossessor, as it saves a dangerous peck. It is also an advantage to\r\nits enemies, for it saves them an unpleasant experience. We are told\r\nthe Parrot is the only bird with a sense of taste, but it seems that\r\nthe chicken possesses one also.\r\n\r\nStill another phase of color is shown by Diamond-Birds, where three\r\nspecies have a yellow spot, a red spot, or an orange spot respectively\r\non the wing. It is also shown by the Red-breasted Robins. One has\r\na white forehead, one a white cap, and the third a red cap. These\r\ncolored patches are considered to be recognition marks, so that a bird\r\ncan recognize its mate, or a bird of its own kind, readily and with\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\nThat rarely-seen, but beautiful, bird, the Mistletoe-Swallow, is\r\nfairly common. From several points of view, it is of great interest.\r\nRanging from India, through Malaysia, to Australia, it did not reach\r\nTasmania. Possibly Bass Strait was formed before this bird reached\r\nSouthern Victoria. Interesting, also, is the fact that no mistletoe is\r\nfound in Tasmania. This bird is closely associated with the mistletoe,\r\nfor, wherever you find it, you find the mistletoe. It furnishes\r\nanother example of those interesting partnerships between animals and\r\nplants. It is not related to Swallows, but while it sits on a bough,\r\nits external form somewhat resembles that of a Swallow. Its nest\r\nis one of the most beautiful of all nests--a finely-felted, domed\r\nstructure, often suspended in a clump of mistletoe. This bird has a\r\nlong-continued, pretty, animated song, which is seldom heard, for\r\nit is low, and, as the bird is high in the tree-tops, it might be\r\ninaudible; but the main reason is probably that our ears are not\r\nattuned to pick out these fine songs. It is said that Tyndall found\r\nthe insects on the Alps almost deafening, while his companions heard\r\nnothing. So it is with the high-pitched call of a Bat. Have you heard\r\none? Few have.\r\n\r\nThe Mistletoe-Swallow should be called the Australian Flower-Pecker,\r\nfor it is our one representative of a large genus, best developed in\r\nthe Indian Region.\r\n\r\nPlaced at present in Family 141 with the little Mistletoe-Bird are the\r\nDiamond-Birds of Australia, the plumage of our common kind of which is\r\n\"so variegated and beautiful as to render description impossible.\"\r\n\r\nThe Diamond-Birds are restricted to Australia. Though they are found\r\nmainly in high tree-tops, whence they prettily and continuously call\r\n\"wit-e-chu\" and \"wit-loo,\" some usually nest in a bank of earth. The\r\nbank of a dam, the side of a creek, and the earth suspended on the\r\nroots of a fallen tree are favorite places. Some people find the\r\ncontinuous, musical note annoying, and have named the Diamond-Bird the\r\nHeadache-Bird. Others find it entertaining, and syllabize it as \"Sweet\r\nDick,\" or \"Sleep, Baby.\"\r\n\r\nThree of these birds are recognized by a small, bright spot on the\r\nside of the wing. In one this spot is said to be red, in another it is\r\norange, and in the third yellow. However, Gould said the young of the\r\nRed-tipped had the orange tip, and later investigation seems to be\r\nsupporting his view, for the Orange-tipped is possibly not a\r\ndifferent species, but only a phase of the Red-tipped. One of our bird\r\nobservers, Mr. F. Wilson, has lately recorded finding the nest of\r\na pair of Pardalotes, of which one was red-tipped and the other\r\norange-tipped. The Yellow-tipped is said to be the commonest bird\r\nin Tasmania. These birds are plentifully spotted, \"spotted like the\r\npard,\" hence the name Pardalote, Panther-Bird, or Diamond-Bird.\r\n\r\n(continued below)\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n  [Page 153]\r\n\r\n    F. 135.

(continued)\r\n\r\nThe most characteristic family of birds of the Australian region is\r\nthe Honey-eaters. Flowering eucalypts and other myrtaceous plants,\r\nwith their honey-bearing flowers and usually inedible fruits, are\r\nthe characteristic Australian trees; so are these birds, depending so\r\nlargely on the honey of these brilliant flowers and the insects which\r\nvisit them, the characteristic Australian birds. The Honey-eaters form\r\na very large family, and are found throughout the Australian region\r\nas far as New Zealand and away to the Sandwich Islands, which,\r\nzoologically, belong to Australia. Strange it is that only one species\r\nshould have spread to the west across Wallace's line to the island of\r\nBali. These birds are provided with a brush tongue, which is used in\r\nbrushing up honey from the flowers. They have usually a long, slender,\r\ncurved bill, suitable for exploring flowers. Their feet are well\r\ndeveloped and strong, for they are used while hanging in all sorts\r\nof positions as the flowers are explored. No less than eighty-eight\r\nHoney-eaters are found in Australia, but they are often restricted to\r\nvery limited areas, so that no district would contain many kinds of\r\nthese birds. Many are well known, though not by the name Honey-eater.\r\nWho does not know the harsh note of the Wattle-Bird (Wattled\r\nHoney-eater)? Again, who does not often meet the Noisy Miner\r\n(Garrulous Honey-eater), a bird that makes such a fuss when a snake\r\nappears that he is sometimes called the Snake-Bird? Is there a city\r\nboy who does not know the Greenie (White-plumed Honey-eater)? Some of\r\nthe Honey-eaters are amongst the most beautiful of birds.\r\n\r\nThe Regent (Warty-faced) Honey-eater is a glory, and is often figured\r\nin British books as one of the world's beautiful birds.\r\n\r\nThe Helmeted Honey-eater is very rare, and is probably confined to the\r\ndeep forests of Gippsland. It is one of the most splendid of\r\nHoney-eaters.\r\n\r\nThat active city-dweller, the Greenie, is found in almost every large\r\neucalypt that happens to be in flower. It is pugnacious. As it busily\r\nbrushes honey from the flowers, or catches an insect on the wing, the\r\nwhite ear plume can be seen. Otherwise, it has not conspicuous colors.\r\nIts lively call of \"chick-oo-wee\" adds something to life for the busy\r\ncity toiler.\r\n\r\nNow come the Miners. The Noisy Miner is known to nearly everyone. It\r\nis a common visitor to school grounds at lunch time, and is a noisy\r\nbird that is little loved by sportsmen, for it persists in alarming\r\nall game within reach. A second Miner is famous as the Bell-Bird,\r\nbetter Bell-Miner. The tinkling notes, \"like silver bells from a\r\ndistant shrine,\" must be heard in a deep fern gully to be appreciated\r\nfully. The green birds are seldom seen. Kendall has immortalized this\r\nbird in his beautiful poem, \"Bell-Birds.\"\r\n\r\nThe Wattle-Bird is known to all. It is a pugnacious bird, and has a\r\nrough, disagreeable note. It has a small wattle of naked red flesh\r\nhanging at the side of the neck, hence the name. The bold, pugnacious\r\nBrush Wattle-Bird is not so well known, though its notes are even\r\nmore remarkable. Both birds to-day are common in the Melbourne Botanic\r\nGardens on the flowering plants in the \"Australian\" section.\r\n\r\nThe Spiny-cheeked Honey-eater is said to be a rare bird, but there is\r\nprobably not a park about Melbourne but has some of these at present,\r\nas well as all through the winter. It is somewhat similar in build\r\nand habits to the Wattle-Birds, but is an elegant and attractive bird,\r\nwith many peculiar notes.\r\n\r\nThe Blue-eye (Blue-faced Honey-eater) is a conspicuous bird in country\r\ndistricts. He is noisy, and is handsomely attired. His nesting habits\r\nare peculiar, for he often builds in the deserted nest of a Babbler.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable Friar-Bird has a naked, dark-blue head, and is an\r\n\"impudent and daring\" bird, that does not hesitate to steal fruit. Its\r\nloud call has been variously interpreted as \"Four o'clock,\" \"Pimlico,\"\r\nor \"Tobacco-box.\" This bird has a hump on its long curved bill. The\r\nYellow-throated Friar-Bird, when young, has yellow on the end of the\r\nthroat feathers, and has no hump on the bill. It is a summer visitor\r\nto Southern Australia.\r\n\r\nThe well-known Ground-Lark, or Australian Pipit, is the Australian\r\nrepresentative of the cosmopolitan family (147) of Pipits. Even New\r\nZealand has its representative of this family. The Wagtails of\r\nBritain and North America belong to this family, whereas the so-called\r\nAustralian Wagtail is a flycatcher. Like the other members of its\r\nfamily, our Ground-Lark, or Pipit, sometimes sings beautifully as it\r\nsoars.\r\n\r\nThe Skylark of Britain comes in the next family (the _Alaudidae_),\r\nwhich is almost cosmopolitan. This beautiful songster, singing at\r\nHeaven's gate, pours forth a flood of melody. The man who has these\r\ndelightful songsters on open land near his home is indeed fortunate.\r\nAustralia has its representative of this family--the Bush-Lark, a bird\r\nso remarkably like the Australian Pipit in external appearance that\r\nit is well-nigh impossible to distinguish them in the field. The\r\nBush-Lark, however, is \"shorter, plumper, and has a stouter bill.\" It\r\nfurther has a peculiar, greatly undulating flight. It mounts up, then\r\nsinks, then mounts, and so on alternately, \"singing all the time very\r\nmelodiously, but with a weaker strain than that favorite bird\" (the\r\nBritish Skylark).\r\n\r\nFour introduced Finches have succeeded in establishing themselves\r\nin Southern Australia. The Greenfinch is spreading, though slowly. A\r\nspecimen was recently sent in from Horsham, in Western Victoria.\r\nThe Goldfinch, \"one of the prettiest birds in Britain,\" is spreading\r\nrapidly. It is often to be seen on thistles, for it destroys their\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\nThe Tree-Sparrow is rare as yet, but the House-Sparrow is already a\r\nserious pest, though probably he has not been valued highly enough as\r\na weed destroyer. However, it was a pity early colonists did not take\r\nnotice of Gould's protests and warnings, for possibly the greatest\r\nharm introduced birds do is the displacing of native birds.\r\n\r\n(continued below)\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n  [Page 168]\r\n\r\n    F. 144.

(continued)\r\n\r\nGould placed the Australian Finches in the same family as the\r\nSparrow--the _Fringillidae_--which includes also the Linnet and the\r\ncage Canary. Most writers now put them in with the Weaver-Birds or\r\nWeaver Finches (family _Ploceidae_). Twenty-three Finches have been\r\nrecorded from Australia. All have the well-known Finch bill, adapted\r\nfor shelling seeds, and all are seed-eaters, though some occasionally\r\ntake insects in addition.\r\n\r\nThe Spotted-sided Finch is true to name, as a glance at the\r\nillustration shows. The rare Fire-tail is beautifully and closely\r\nbanded below, while the Chestnut-eared Finch is banded on the throat\r\nand chest. The Plum-headed Finch has a deep crimson forehead, and is\r\nbanded below.\r\n\r\nThe Red-browed Finch is often called the \"Firetail,\" for it has the\r\nred rump as well as the red brow and bill, but the under surface is\r\nnot banded. These birds usually build a very large nest, which has\r\nbeen compared to a \"stocking hung by the toe, while the eggs are laid\r\nin the heel, and entrance is gained through the leg.\"\r\n\r\nThe introduced Starling has firmly established itself, and is\r\nextending its range rapidly. Incredible numbers gather at lagoon-sides\r\nto roost in the reed-beds.\r\n\r\nThis bird is a favorite with farmers and graziers, but orchardists\r\nview its rapid increase with alarm. It is possible, as Mr. C. French,\r\nGovernment Entomologist, has pointed out, that the Starling will yet\r\nprove a more expensive pest than the Rabbit.\r\n\r\nStarlings, at least, upset the balance of nature, for, by occupying\r\nall available nesting sites, early and late, they displace the native\r\nbirds. Kingfishers, Parrots, and other birds that nest in hollows are\r\nthus being driven away from their old haunts.\r\n\r\nThe Australian Oriole is a member of the family of true Orioles. The\r\nFig-Birds of Queensland towns are closely related. The members of\r\nthis family are restricted to the Eastern Hemisphere. Our Oriole is an\r\ninteresting migrant which visits even cities. Its beautiful hanging,\r\ncup-shaped nest woven amongst the twigs at the end of a leafy bough\r\nis a clever piece of work. Its note is melodious and varied. It often\r\ncalls \"o-ree-ee-o-ole.\" It is also fond of mimicking other birds.\r\n\r\nThe Baltimore Oriole, or Golden Robin, is properly not an Oriole, but\r\ncomes in a related family--the _Icteridae_--which contains American\r\nbirds somewhat similar to Orioles. The Australian bird, as shown by\r\nthe colored illustration, has not the conspicuous golden and black\r\nplumage of the European bird.\r\n\r\nThe Spangled Drongo is the Australian representative of a family\r\nof birds spread from Africa, Madagascar, and India up to Japan, and\r\nthrough the islands to Australia. They are a characteristic feature of\r\nIndian ornithology, for they are found everywhere in that country.\r\nThe one Australian bird is a migrant, and seldom reaches Southern\r\nAustralia. Like other Drongos, it is a glossy black, has a long,\r\nforked tail, is a good mimic of other birds' calls, and is also a\r\nvicious fighter. It is exceedingly active, and has a disagreeably\r\nharsh, cackling, and creaking whistle. It will drive away even hawks\r\nand crows.\r\n\r\nAfter the Shining Starlings of Queensland, come the\r\nmarvellously-beautiful Birds of Paradise--\"God's Birds.\"\r\n\r\nThese unique birds are found only in New Guinea, Papuan Islands,\r\nMolucca Islands, and the rich, tropical coast scrubs of Eastern\r\nAustralia. One, the Riflebird, is found even down to North-Eastern New\r\nSouth Wales.\r\n\r\nThe Federal and State Governments are doing excellent work in\r\nprotecting our beautiful birds, and are giving what seems to be a\r\nreally efficient protection, so that some of our birds which possess\r\nthe fatal gift of beauty in an extreme degree will probably survive\r\nfor some time yet. Collectors as well as plume-hunters should be\r\ncompelled to keep hands off our exquisite birds.\r\n\r\n(continued below)\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n    F. 154.

North, C.M.B.O.U., the ornithologist of the Australian\r\nMuseum, Sydney, and one of the greatest of living Australian\r\nornithologists, has declared that \"without exception, the\r\nbower-building birds of Australia are the most extraordinary and\r\ninteresting group of birds found in the world.\"\r\n\r\nThese wonderful birds construct, apart from their nests,\r\nplay-houses--structures that \"are perfectly anomalous in the\r\narchitecture of birds.\" Gould considered the accounts of the\r\n\"extraordinary habits\" of the Bower Birds \"as some of the valuable and\r\ninteresting portions\" of his work. Though the bird was known before\r\nGould's time, its \"extraordinary habits had never been brought\r\nbefore the scientific world until I (Gould) had the gratification of\r\npublishing an account of them after my return from Australia.\"\r\n\r\nThis month I had the gratification of seeing the Satin Bower Birds\r\nplaying about a perfect bower within one chain of a country school,\r\nand within one yard of a busy roadside. The birds have quite made\r\nfriends with the school children. They have helped themselves to the\r\nblue flowers from the school garden, pieces of blue paper, and even\r\na blue hair ribbon, besides blue parrot's feathers. These are used to\r\ndecorate this very interesting playhouse.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Satin Bower Birds are mainly fruit-eaters, and so\r\nwill possibly do some damage, but they are amongst the wonders of the\r\nworld, and it is hoped all will hesitate to shoot them, \"for their\r\nhighly-decorated halls of assembly must be regarded as the most\r\nwonderful instances of bird-architecture yet discovered.\" The male\r\ngets his beautiful blue-black coat after he is seven years old.\r\n\r\nMany of the schools of South Gippsland can show Satin Bower-Birds\r\nregularly in attendance at lunch-time to gather the crusts. We have\r\ndestroyed their native fruits, and should submit to some slight\r\nloss to enable young Australians to become familiar with the \"most\r\ninteresting group of birds\" in the world.\r\n\r\n(continued below)\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n  [Page 187b]\r\n\r\n    F. 163.

(continued)\r\n\r\nThe members of the Crow Family--the _Corvidae_--were considered the\r\nmost highly-developed of birds--the most highly organized, so far as\r\nstructure was concerned, and the most intelligent. However, Sharpe has\r\nerected the seven Australian Bell-Magpies (_Streperas_) into a family\r\nwhich, in his _Hand-List of Birds_ is placed at the top of the bird\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nIn the Crow Family many well-known birds are placed. The Jays,\r\nMagpie, Daws, Rooks, and Nutcrackers of Europe are not represented\r\nin Australia. The Crows and the Raven, however, are represented by\r\nclosely-related birds.\r\n\r\nIt is important to tell the difference between the Australian Crow and\r\nthe Australian Raven, for, we are told, the Crow is all that is good,\r\nwhile the Raven is the reverse.\r\n\r\nThe ornithologists say it is easy to tell the difference. Just examine\r\nthe down, say, on the neck. It is white in the Crow, but dusky in\r\nthe Raven. Unfortunately, the birds will not always wait to permit an\r\nexamination of the down.\r\n\r\nThe eye is often mentioned, but hazel-eyed birds have become white-eyed.\r\nHowever, the Raven has lanceolate feathers on the neck, and a rougher,\r\nunmusical voice.\r\n\r\nThe Raven seems the more common bird, though most people will tell you\r\nthere are no Ravens in their district.\r\n\r\nThe Apostle-Bird (Gray Jumper), and the White-winged Chough are two\r\nof Australia's \"anomalous birds.\" Both go in flocks, so each has been\r\ncalled the \"Twelve Apostles.\" However, the name has become attached to\r\nthe Gray Jumper.\r\n\r\nThe White-winged Chough has no close relative in the world; possibly,\r\nthe Chough that nests in the cliffs of Cornwall is nearest to it.\r\n\r\nThe Bell-Magpies (_Streperas_), perhaps better known as Black or Gray\r\nMagpies, are now receiving much notice, because of their position\r\nat the head of the bird-world. They are restricted to Australia,\r\nTasmania, and Lord Howe Island. A good name is required for these\r\nbirds, for, of course, they are not Magpies, though they have a\r\nwhite-tipped tail, and there is usually white in the wing, and about\r\nthe base of the tail. They are fine, large birds, with a variety of\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\n(continued below)\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\n  [Page 188b]\r\n\r\n    F. 164.

Realize that you live in a land favored far beyond most\r\nas regards birds, and that you have a duty to perform in preserving as\r\nmany as possible of these unique, interesting, and valuable forms\r\nfor posterity. Teachers! Your influence is more potent than all the\r\nlegislation. Bird lovers already freely acknowledge the fundamental\r\nchange that has come over the schoolboy since the introduction of\r\nnature-study, and they look to you with confidence to extend greatly\r\nthe good work of cultivating an interest and a pride in\r\nthings Australian, for this interest will eradicate the once\r\nalmost-universal, but now rapidly-disappearing, desire for slaughter\r\nof anything wearing a feather.\r\n\r\nIf women could be persuaded to come in line with the once destructive\r\nschoolboy in this respect, the bird lover and the well-wisher of his\r\ncountry would have further cause for gratification, and our beautiful\r\nbirds a further enjoyment of a useful, indeed, often a necessary life,\r\none necessary to the welfare of the agriculturist and the pastoralist,\r\nas well as of all dwellers in this fair, sunny land of ours.\r\n\r\nAustralians! Your wonderful Lyre-Birds, your marvellous Bower-Birds,\r\nyour gorgeous Birds of Paradise, your Mound-Builders, your flute-noted\r\nMagpies, your charming Whistlers, your beautiful and intelligent\r\nCockatoos, your glorious Parrots--the pets of the bird world--your\r\nSuperb-Warblers, your varied, valuable, and attractive Honey-eaters,\r\nand your giant Laughing-Kingfisher are here for your enjoyment and\r\nappreciation. No other people has your privilege of knowing these\r\nbirds in their native state. On the other hand, you enjoy most of the\r\nprivileges of dwellers in other lands, in addition to your own, for\r\n\"every widely-spread family of birds but two is found in Australia.\r\nThe only notable absentees are Vultures and Woodpeckers.\" Be proud\r\nof your heritage, and pass it on uninjured.
