In the words\r\nof the poet--\r\n\r\n    “Where rolls the deep, there grew the tree;\r\n       O Earth, what changes hast thou seen!\r\n       There, where the long street roars, hath been\r\n     The silence of the central sea.”\r\n\r\nIt has been thought desirable that the present edition of the work\r\nshould undergo a thorough revision by a practical geologist, a task\r\nwhich Mr. H. W. Bristow has performed. Mr. Bristow has however confined\r\nhimself to such alterations as were necessary to secure accuracy in the\r\nstatement of facts, and such additions as were necessary to represent\r\nmore precisely the existing state of scientific opinion. Many points\r\nwhich are more or less inferential and therefore matters of individual\r\nopinion, and especially those on which M. Figuier bases his\r\nspeculations, have been left in their original form, in preference to\r\nmaking modifications which would wholly change the character of the\r\nbook. In a work whose purpose is to give the general reader a summarised\r\naccount of the results at which science has arrived, and of the method\r\nof reasoning regarding the facts on which these generalisations rest, it\r\nwould be out of place, as well as ineffective, to obscure general\r\nstatements with those limitations which caution imposes on the\r\nscientific investigator.\r\n\r\nIn the original work the Author had naturally enough drawn most of his\r\nfacts from French localities; in the translation these are mostly\r\npreserved, but others drawn from British Geology have been added, either\r\nfrom the translator’s own knowledge, or from the works of well-known\r\nBritish writers. It was considered desirable, for similar reasons, to\r\nenlarge upon the opinions of British geologists, to whom the French work\r\nscarcely does justice, considering the extent to which the science is\r\nindebted to them for its elucidation.\r\n\r\nIn the original work the chapter on Eruptive Rocks comes at the end of\r\nthe work, but, as the work proceeded, so many unexplained allusions to\r\nthat chapter were found that it seemed more logical, and more in\r\naccordance with chronological order, if the expression may be used, to\r\nplace that chapter at the beginning.\r\n\r\nA new edition of the French work having appeared in the early part of\r\n1866, to which the Author contributed a chapter on Metamorphic Rocks, a\r\ntranslation of it is appended to the chapter on Eruptive Rocks.\r\n\r\nA chapter on the Rhætic (or Penarth) beds has been inserted (amongst\r\nmuch other original matter), the stratigraphical importance of that\r\nseries having been recognised since the publication of the First\r\nEdition.\r\n\r\nIn the present Edition the text has been again thoroughly revised by Mr.\r\nBristow, and many important additions made, the result of the recent\r\ninvestigations of himself and his colleagues of the Geological Survey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE\r\n  WORLD BEFORE THE DELUGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe observer who glances over a rich and fertile plain, watered by\r\nrivers and streams which have, during a long series of ages, pursued the\r\nsame uniform and tranquil course; the traveller who contemplates the\r\nwalls and monuments of a great city, the first founding of which is lost\r\nin the night of ages, testifying, apparently, to the unchangeableness of\r\nthings and places; the naturalist who examines a mountain or other\r\nlocality, and finds the hills and valleys and other accidents of the\r\nsoil in the very spot and condition in which they are described by\r\nhistory and tradition--none of these observers would at first suspect\r\nthat any serious change had ever occurred to disturb the surface of the\r\nglobe. Nevertheless, the earth has not always presented the calm aspect\r\nof stability which it now exhibits; it has had its convulsions, and its\r\nphysical revolutions, whose story we are about to trace. The earth, like\r\nthe body of an animal, is wasted, as the philosophical Hutton tells us,\r\nat the same time that it is repaired. It has a state of growth and\r\naugmentation; it has another state, which is that of diminution and\r\ndecay: it is destroyed in one part to be renewed in another; and the\r\noperations by which the renewal is accomplished are as evident to the\r\nscientific eye as those by which it is destroyed. A thousand causes,\r\naqueous, igneous, and atmospheric, are continually at work modifying the\r\nexternal form of the earth, wearing down the older portions of its\r\nsurface, and reconstructing newer out of the older; so that in many\r\nparts of the world denudation has taken place to the extent of many\r\nthousand feet. Buried in the depths of the soil, for example, in one of\r\nthose vast excavations which the intrepidity of the miner has dug in\r\nsearch of coal or other minerals, there are numerous phenomena which\r\nstrike the mind of the inquirer, and carry their own conclusions with\r\nthem. A striking increase of temperature in these subterranean places\r\nis one of the most remarkable of these. It is found that the temperature\r\nof the earth rises one degree for every sixty or seventy feet of descent\r\nfrom its surface. Again: if the mine be examined vertically, it is found\r\nto consist of a series of layers or beds, sometimes horizontal, but more\r\nfrequently inclined, upright, or contorted and undulating--even folded\r\nback upon themselves. Then, instances are numerous where horizontal and\r\nparallel beds have been penetrated, and traversed vertically or\r\nobliquely by veins of ores or minerals totally different in their\r\nappearance and nature from the surrounding rocks. All these undulations\r\nand varying inclinations of strata are indications that some powerful\r\ncause, some violent mechanical action, has intervened to produce them.\r\nFinally, if the interior of the beds be examined more minutely--if,\r\narmed with the miner’s pick and hammer, the rock is carefully broken\r\nup--it is not impossible that the very first efforts at mining may be\r\nrewarded by the discovery of some fossilised organic form no longer\r\nfound in the living state. The remains of plants and animals belonging\r\nto the earlier ages of the world, are, in fact, very common; entire\r\nstrata are sometimes formed of them; and in some localities the rocks\r\ncan scarcely be disturbed without yielding fragments of bones and\r\nshells, or the impressions of fossilised animals and vegetables--the\r\nburied remains of extinct creations.\r\n\r\nThese bones--these remains of animals or vegetables which the hammer of\r\nthe geologist has torn from the rock--belong possibly to some organism\r\nwhich no longer any where exists: it may not be identical with any\r\nanimal or plant living in our times: but it is evident that these\r\nbeings, whose remains are now so deeply buried, have not always been so\r\ncovered; they once lived on the surface of the earth as plants and\r\nanimals do in our days, for their organisation is essentially the same.\r\nThe beds in which they now repose must, then, in older times have formed\r\nthe surface of the earth; and the presence of these fossils proves that\r\nthe earth has suffered great mutations at some former period of its\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nGeology explains to us the various transformations which the earth has\r\npassed through before it arrived at its present condition. We can\r\ndetermine, with its help, the comparative epoch to which any beds\r\nbelong, as well as the order in which others have been superimposed upon\r\nthem. Considering that the stratigraphical crust of the earth with which\r\nthe geologist has to deal may be some ten miles thick, and that it has\r\nbeen deposited in distinct layers in a definite order of succession, the\r\ndates or epochs of each formation may well be approached with hesitation\r\nand caution.\r\n\r\nDr. Hutton, the earliest of our philosophical geologists, eloquently\r\nobserves, in his “Theory of the Earth,” that the solid earth is\r\neverywhere wasted at the surface. The summits of the mountains are\r\nnecessarily degraded. The solid and weighty materials of these mountains\r\nhave everywhere been carried through the valleys by the force of running\r\nwater. The soil which is produced in the destruction of the solid earth\r\nis gradually transported by the moving waters, and is as constantly\r\nsupplying vegetation with its necessary aid. This drifted soil is at\r\nlast deposited upon some coast, where it forms a fertile country. But\r\nthe billows of the ocean again agitate the loose material upon the\r\nshore, wearing away the coast with endless repetitions of this act of\r\npower and imparted force; the solid portion of our earth, thus sapped to\r\nits foundations, is carried away into the deep and sunk again at the\r\nbottom of the sea whence it had originated, and from which sooner or\r\nlater it will again make its appearance. We are thus led to see a\r\ncirculation of destruction and renewal in the matter of which the globe\r\nis formed, and a system of beautiful economy in the works of Nature.\r\nAgain, discriminating between the ordinary and scientific observer, the\r\nsame writer remarks, that it is not given to common observation to see\r\nthe operation of physical causes. The shepherd thinks the mountain on\r\nwhich he feeds his flock has always been there. The inhabitant of the\r\nvalley cultivates the soil as his fathers did before him, and thinks the\r\nsoil coeval with the valley or the mountain. But the scientific observer\r\nlooks into the chain of physical events, sees the great changes that\r\nhave been made, and foresees others that must follow from the continued\r\noperation of like natural causes. For, as Pythagoras taught 2,350 years\r\nago, “the minerals and the rocks, the islands and the continents, the\r\nrivers and the seas, and all organic Nature, are perpetually changing;\r\nthere is nothing stationary on earth.” To note these changes--to\r\ndecipher the records of this system of waste and reconstruction, to\r\ntrace the physical history of the earth--is the province of GEOLOGY,\r\nwhich, the latest of all modern sciences, is that which has been\r\nmodified most profoundly and most rapidly. In short, resting as it does\r\non observation, it has been modified and transformed according to every\r\nseries of facts recorded; but while many of the facts of geology admit\r\nof easy and obvious demonstration, it is far otherwise with the\r\ninferences which have been based upon them, which are mostly\r\nhypothetical, and in many instances from their very nature incapable of\r\nproof. Its applications are numerous and varied, projecting new and\r\nuseful lights upon many other sciences. Here we ask of it the teachings\r\nwhich serve to explain the origin of the globe--the evidence it\r\nfurnishes of the progressive formation of the different rocks and\r\nmineral masses of which the earth is composed--the description and\r\nrestoration of the several species of animals and vegetables which have\r\nexisted, have died and become extinct, and which form, in the language\r\nof naturalists, the _Fauna_ and _Flora_ of the ancient world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn order to explain the origin of the earth, and the cause of its\r\nvarious revolutions, modern geologists invoke three orders of facts, or\r\nfundamental considerations:\r\n\r\n    I. The hypothesis of the original incandescence of the globe.\r\n\r\n    II. The consideration of fossils.\r\n\r\n    III. The successive deposition of the sedimentary rocks.\r\n\r\nAs a corollary to these, the hypothesis of the upheaval of the earth’s\r\ncrust follows--upheavals having produced local revolutions. The result\r\nof these upheavals has been to superimpose new materials upon the older\r\nrocks, introducing extraneous rocks called _Eruptive_, beneath, upon,\r\nand amongst preceding deposits, in such a manner as to change their\r\nnature in divers ways. Whence is derived a third class of rocks called\r\n_Metamorphic_ or altered _rocks_, our knowledge of which is of\r\ncomparatively recent date.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSILS.\r\n\r\nThe name of _Fossil_ (from _fossilis_, dug up) is given to all organised\r\nbodies, animal or vegetable, buried naturally in the terrestrial strata,\r\nand more or less petrified, that is, converted into stone. Fossils of\r\nthe older formations are remains of organisms which, so far as species\r\nis concerned, are quite extinct; and only those of recent formations\r\nbelong to genera living in our days. These fossil remains have neither\r\nthe beauty nor the elegance of most living species, being mutilated,\r\ndiscoloured, and often almost shapeless; they are, therefore,\r\ninteresting only in the eyes of the observer who would interrogate them,\r\nand who seeks to reconstruct, with their assistance, the Fauna and Flora\r\nof past ages. Nevertheless, the light they throw upon the past history\r\nof the earth is of the most satisfactory description, and the science of\r\nfossils, or palæontology, is now an important branch of geological\r\ninquiry. Fossil shells, in the more recent deposits, are found scarcely\r\naltered; in some cases only an impression of the external form is\r\nleft--sometimes an entire cast of the shell, exterior and interior. In\r\nother cases the shell has left a perfect impression of its form in the\r\nsurrounding mud, and has then been dissolved and washed away, leaving\r\nonly its mould. This mould, again, has sometimes been filled up by\r\ncalcareous spar, silica, or pyrites, and an exact cast of the original\r\nshell has thus been obtained. Petrified wood is also of very common\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nThese remains of an earlier creation had long been known to the curious,\r\nand classed as _freaks of Nature_, for so we find them described in the\r\nworks of the ancient philosophers who wrote on natural history, and in\r\nthe few treatises on the subject which the Middle Ages have bequeathed\r\nto us. Fossil bones, especially those of elephants, were known to the\r\nancients, giving rise to all sorts of legends and fabulous histories:\r\nthe tradition which attributed to Achilles, to Ajax, and to other heroes\r\nof the Trojan war, a height of twenty feet, is attributable, no doubt,\r\nto the discovery of the bones of elephants near their tombs. In the time\r\nof Pericles we are assured that in the tomb of Ajax a _patella_, or\r\nknee-bone of that hero, was found, which was as large as a dinner-plate.\r\nThis was probably only the patella of a fossil elephant.\r\n\r\nThe uses to which fossils are applied by the geologist are--First, to\r\nascertain the relative age of the formations in which they occur;\r\nsecondly, the conditions under which these were deposited. The age of\r\nthe formation is determined by a comparison of the fossils it contains\r\nwith others of ascertained date; the conditions under which the rocks\r\nwere deposited, whether marine, lacustrine, or terrestrial, are readily\r\ninferred from the nature of the fossils. The great artist, Leonardo da\r\nVinci, was the first to comprehend the real meaning of fossils, and\r\nBernard Palissy had the glory of being the first modern writer to\r\nproclaim the true character of the fossilised remains which are met\r\nwith, in such numbers, in certain formations, both in France and Italy,\r\nparticularly in those of Touraine, where they had come more especially\r\nunder his notice. In his work on “Waters and Fountains,” published in\r\n1580, he maintains that the _figured stones_, as fossils were then\r\ncalled, were the remains of organised beings preserved at the bottom of\r\nthe sea. But the existence of marine shells upon the summits of\r\nmountains had already arrested the attention of ancient authors. Witness\r\nOvid, who in Book XV. of the “Metamorphoses” tells us he had seen land\r\nformed at the expense of the sea, and marine shells lying dead far from\r\nthe ocean; and more than that, an ancient anchor had been found on the\r\nvery summit of a mountain.\r\n\r\n            “Vidi factas ex æquore terras,\r\n    Et procul a pelago conchæ jacuere marinæ,\r\n    Et vetus inventa est in montibus anchora summis.”\r\n\r\nOv., _Met._, Book xv.\r\n\r\nThe Danish geologist Steno, who published his principal works in Italy\r\nabout the middle of the seventeenth century, had deeply studied the\r\nfossil shells discovered in that country. The Italian painter Scilla\r\nproduced in 1670 a Latin treatise on the fossils of Calabria, in which\r\nhe established the organic nature of fossil shells.\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth century gave birth to two very opposite theories as to\r\nthe origin of our globe--namely, the _Plutonian_ or igneous, and the\r\n_Neptunian_ or aqueous theory. The Italian geologists gave a marked\r\nimpulse to the study of fossils, and the name of Vallisneri[1] may be\r\ncited as the author to whom science is indebted for the earliest account\r\nof the marine deposits of Italy, and of the most characteristic organic\r\nremains which they contain. Lazzaro Moro[2] continued the studies of\r\nVallisneri, and the monk Gemerelli reduced to a complete system the\r\nideas of these two geologists, endeavouring to explain all the phenomena\r\nas Vallisneri had wished, “without violence, without fiction, without\r\nmiracles.” Marselli and Donati both studied in a very scientific manner\r\nthe fossil shells of Italy, and in particular those of the Adriatic,\r\nrecognising the fact that they affected in their beds a regular and\r\nconstant order of superposition.[3]\r\n\r\n  [1] Dei corpi marini, &c., 1721.\r\n\r\n  [2] Sui crostaccei ed altri corpi marini che sè trovano sui monti,\r\n      1740.\r\n\r\n  [3] Consult Lyell’s “Principles of Geology” and the sixth edition of\r\n      the “Elements,” with much new matter, for further information\r\n      relative to the study of fossils during the last two centuries.\r\n\r\nIn France the celebrated Buffon gave, by his eloquent writings, great\r\npopularity to the notions of the Italian naturalists concerning the\r\norigin of fossil remains. In his admirable “Époques de la Nature” he\r\nsought to prove that the shells found in great quantities buried in the\r\nsoil, and even on the tops of mountains, belonged, in reality, to\r\nspecies not living in our days. But this idea was too novel not to find\r\nobjectors: it counted among its adversaries the bold philosopher who\r\nmight have been expected to adopt it with most ardour. Voltaire\r\nattacked, with his jesting and biting criticism, the doctrines of the\r\nillustrious innovator. Buffon insisted, reasonably enough, that the\r\npresence of shells on the summit of the Alps was a proof that the sea\r\nhad at one time occupied that position. But Voltaire asserted that the\r\nshells found on the Alps and Apennines had been thrown there by pilgrims\r\nreturning from Rome. Buffon might have replied to his opponent, by\r\npointing out whole mountains formed by the accumulation of these shells.\r\nHe might have sent him to the Pyrenees, where shells of marine origin\r\ncover immense areas to a height of 6,600 feet above the present\r\nsea-level. But his genius was averse to controversy; and the philosopher\r\nof Ferney himself put an end to a discussion in which, perhaps, he would\r\nnot have had the best of the argument. “I have no wish,” he wrote, “to\r\nembroil myself with Monsieur Buffon about shells.”\r\n\r\nIt was reserved for the genius of George Cuvier to draw from the study\r\nof fossils the most wonderful results: it is the study of these remains,\r\nin short, which, in conjunction with mineralogy, constitutes in these\r\ndays positive geology. “It is to fossils,” says the great Cuvier, “that\r\nwe owe the discovery of the true theory of the earth; without them we\r\nshould not have dreamed, perhaps, that the globe was formed at\r\nsuccessive epochs, and by a series of different operations. They alone,\r\nin short, tell us with certainty that the globe has not always had the\r\nsame envelope; we cannot resist the conviction that they must have lived\r\non the surface of the earth before being buried in its depths. It is\r\nonly by analogy that we have extended to the primary formations the\r\ndirect conclusions which fossils furnish us with in respect to the\r\nsecondary formations; and if we had only unfossiliferous rocks to\r\nexamine, no one could maintain that the earth was not formed all at\r\nonce.”[4]\r\n\r\n  [4] “Ossements Fossiles” (4to), vol. i., p. 29.\r\n\r\nThe method adopted by Cuvier for the reconstruction and restoration of\r\nthe fossil animals found in the plaster-quarries of Montmartre, at the\r\ngates of Paris, has served as a model for all succeeding naturalists;\r\nlet us listen, then, to his exposition of the vast problem whose\r\nsolution he proposed to himself. “In my work on fossil bones,” he says,\r\n“I propose to ascertain to what animals the osseous fragments belong; it\r\nis seeking to traverse a road on which we have as yet only ventured a\r\nfew steps. An antiquary of a new kind, it seemed to me necessary to\r\nlearn both to restore these monuments of past revolutions, and to\r\ndecipher their meaning. I had to gather and bring together in their\r\nprimitive order the fragments of which they are composed; to reconstruct\r\nthe ancient beings to which these fragments belonged; to reproduce them\r\nin their proportions and with their characteristics; to compare them,\r\nfinally, with others now living on the surface of the globe: an art at\r\npresent little known, and which supposes a science scarcely touched upon\r\nas yet, namely, that of the laws which preside over the co-existence of\r\nthe forms of the several parts in organised beings. I must, then,\r\nprepare myself for these researches by others, still more extended, upon\r\nexisting animals. A general review of actual creation could alone give a\r\ncharacter of demonstration to my account of these ancient inhabitants\r\nof the world; but it ought, at the same time, to give me a great\r\ncollection of laws, and of relations not less demonstrable, thus forming\r\na body of new laws to which the whole animal kingdom could not fail to\r\nfind itself subject.”[5]\r\n\r\n  [5] “Ossements Fossiles” (4to), vol. i., pp. 1, 2.\r\n\r\n“When the sight of a few bones inspired me, more than twenty years ago,\r\nwith the idea of applying the general laws of comparative anatomy to the\r\nreconstruction and determination of fossil species; when I began to\r\nperceive that these species were not quite perfectly represented by\r\nthose of our days, which resembled them the most--I no longer doubted\r\nthat I trod upon a soil filled with spoils more extraordinary than any I\r\nhad yet seen, and that I was destined to bring to light entire races\r\nunknown to the present world, and which had been buried for incalculable\r\nages at great depths in the earth.\r\n\r\n“I had not yet given any attention to the published notices of these\r\nbones, by naturalists who made no pretension to the recognition of their\r\nspecies. To M. Vaurin, however, I owe the first intimation of the\r\nexistence of these bones, with which the gypsum-quarries swarm. Some\r\nspecimens which he brought me one day struck me with astonishment; I\r\nlearned, with all the interest the discovery could inspire me with, that\r\nthis industrious and zealous collector had already furnished some of\r\nthem to other collectors. Received by these amateurs with politeness, I\r\nfound in their collections much to confirm my hopes and heighten my\r\ncuriosity. From that time I searched in all the quarries with great care\r\nfor other bones, offering such rewards to the workmen as might awaken\r\ntheir attention. I soon got together more than had ever been previously\r\ncollected, and after a few years I had nothing to desire in the shape of\r\nmaterials. But it was otherwise with their arrangement, and with the\r\nreconstruction of the skeleton, which could alone lead to any just idea\r\nof the species.\r\n\r\n“From the first moment of discovery I perceived that, in these remains,\r\nthe species were numerous. Soon afterwards I saw that they belonged to\r\nmany genera, and that the species of the different genera were nearly\r\nthe same size, so that size was likely rather to hinder than aid me.\r\nMine was the case of a man to whom had been given at random the\r\nmutilated and imperfect remains of some hundreds of skeletons belonging\r\nto twenty sorts of animals; it was necessary that each bone should find\r\nitself alongside that to which it ought to be connected: it was almost\r\nlike a small resurrection, and I had not at my disposal the\r\nall-powerful trumpet; but I had the immutable laws prescribed to living\r\nbeings as my guide; and at the voice of the anatomist each bone and each\r\npart of a bone took its place. I have not expressions with which to\r\ndescribe the pleasure I experienced in finding that, as soon as I\r\ndiscovered the character of a bone, all the consequences of the\r\ncharacter, more or less foreseen, developed themselves in succession:\r\nthe feet were found conformable to what the teeth announced; the teeth\r\nto that announced by the feet; the bones of the legs, of the thighs, all\r\nthose which ought to reunite these two extreme parts, were found to\r\nagree as I expected; in a word, each species was reproduced, so to\r\nspeak, from only one of its elements.”[6]\r\n\r\n  [6] “Ossements Fossiles,” vol. iv. (4to), p. 32.\r\n\r\nWhile the Baron Cuvier was thus zealously prosecuting his inquiries in\r\nFrance, assisted by many eminent fellow-labourers, what was the state of\r\ngeological science in the British Islands? About that same time, Dr.\r\nWilliam Smith, better known as “the father of English geology,” was\r\npreparing, unaided, the first geological map of this country. Dr. Smith\r\nwas a native of Wiltshire, and a canal engineer in Somersetshire; his\r\npursuits, therefore, brought him in the midst of these hieroglyphics of\r\nNature. It was his practice, when travelling professionally, during many\r\nyears to consult masons, miners, wagoners, and agriculturists. He\r\nexamined the soil; and in the course of his inquiries he came to the\r\nconclusion that the earth was not all of the same age; that the rocks\r\nwere arranged in layers, or strata, superimposed on each other in a\r\ncertain definite order, and that the strata, when of the same age, could\r\nbe identified by means of their organic remains. In 1794 he formed the\r\nplan of his geological map, showing the superposition of the various\r\nbeds; for a quarter of a century did he pursue his self-allotted task,\r\nwhich was at last completed, and in 1801 was published, being the first\r\nattempt to construct a stratigraphical map.\r\n\r\nTaking the men in the order of the objects of their investigation,\r\nrather than in chronological order, brings before us the patient and\r\nsagacious investigator to whom we are indebted for our knowledge of the\r\nSilurian system. For many years a vast assemblage of broken and\r\ncontorted beds had been observed on the borders of North Wales,\r\nstretching away to the east as far as Worcestershire, and to the south\r\ninto Gloucester, now rising into mountains, now sinking into valleys.\r\nThe ablest geologists considered them as a mere labyrinth of ruins,\r\nwhose order of succession and distinctive organic remains were entirely\r\nunknown, “But a man came,” as M. Esquiros eloquently writes, “who threw\r\nlight upon this sublime confusion of elements.” Sir Roderick Impey\r\nMurchison, then a young President of the Geological Society, had his\r\nattention directed, as he himself informs us, to some of these beds on\r\nthe banks of the Wye. After seven years of unremitting labour, he was\r\nrewarded by success. He established the fact that these sedimentary\r\nrocks, penetrated here and there by eruptive masses of igneous origin,\r\nformed a unique system, to which he gave the name of _Silurian_, because\r\nthe rocks which he considered the most typical of the whole were most\r\nfully developed, charged with peculiar organic remains, in the land of\r\nthe ancient Silures, who so bravely opposed the Roman invaders of their\r\ncountry. Many investigators have followed in Sir Roderick’s steps, but\r\nfew men have so nobly earned the honours and fame with which his name is\r\nassociated.\r\n\r\nThe success which attended Sir R. Murchison’s investigations soon\r\nattracted the attention of other geologists. Professor Sedgwick examined\r\nthe older slaty strata, and succeeded in proving the position of the\r\nCambrian rocks to be at the base of the Silurian. Still it was reserved\r\nfor Sir William Logan, the Director of the Canadian Geological Survey,\r\nto establish the fact that immense masses of gneissic formation lay at\r\nthe base of the Cambrian; and, by subsequent investigations, Sir\r\nRoderick Murchison satisfied himself that this formation was not\r\nconfined to Canada, but was identical with the rocks termed by him\r\nFundamental Gneiss, which exist in enormous masses on the west coast of\r\nScotland, and which he proved to be the oldest stratified rocks in the\r\nBritish Isles. Subsequently he demonstrated the existence of these same\r\nLaurentian rocks in Bohemia and Bavaria, far beneath the Silurian rocks\r\nof Barrande.\r\n\r\nWhile Murchison and Sedgwick were prosecuting their inquiries into the\r\nSilurian rocks, Hugh Miller and many others had their attention occupied\r\nwith the Old Red Sandstone--the Devonian of Sedgwick and\r\nMurchison--which immediately overlies them. After a youth passed in\r\nwandering among the woods and rocks of his native Cromarty, the day came\r\nwhen Miller found himself twenty years of age, and, for the time, a\r\nworkman in a quarry. A hard fate he thought it at the time, but to him\r\nit was the road to fame and success in life. The quarry in which he\r\nlaboured was at the bottom of a bay formed by the mouth of a river\r\nopening to the south, a clear current of water on one side, as he\r\nvividly described it, and a thick wood on the other. In this silent\r\nspot, in the remote Highlands, a curious fossil fish of the Old Red\r\nSandstone was revealed to him; its appearance struck him with\r\nastonishment; a fellow-workman named a spot where many such monuments of\r\na former world were scattered about; he visited the place, and became a\r\ngeologist and the historian of the “Old Red.” And what strange fantastic\r\nforms did it afterwards fall to his lot to describe! “The figures on a\r\nChina vase or Egyptian obelisk,” he says, “differ less from the real\r\nrepresentation of the objects than the fossil fishes of the ‘Old Red’\r\ndiffer from the living forms which now swim in our seas.”\r\n\r\nThe _Carboniferous Limestone_, which underlies the coal, the\r\n_Coal-measures_ themselves, the _New Red Sandstone_, the _Lias_, and the\r\n_Chalk_, have in their turn found their historians; but it would be\r\nforeign to our object to dwell further here on these particular branches\r\nof the subject.\r\n\r\nSome few of the fossilised beings referred to resemble species still\r\nfound living, but the greater part belong to species which have become\r\naltogether extinct. These fossil remains may constitute natural\r\nfamilies, none of the genera of which have survived. Such is the\r\n_Pterodactyle_ among Pterosaurian reptiles; the _Ammonite_ among\r\nMollusca; the _Ichthyosaurus_ and the _Plesiosaurus_ among the\r\nEnaliosaurian reptiles. At other times there are only extinct genera,\r\nbelonging to families of which there are still some genera now living,\r\nas the genus _Palæoniscus_ among fishes. Finally, in Tertiary deposits,\r\nwe meet with some extinct species belonging to genera of our existing\r\nfauna: the _Mammoth_, for example, of the youngest Tertiary deposits, is\r\nan extinct species of the genus elephant.\r\n\r\nSome fossils are terrestrial, like the gigantic Irish stag, _Cervus\r\nMegaceros_, the snail or _Helix_; fluviatile or lacustrine, like the\r\n_Planorbis_, the _Lymnæa_, the _Physa_, and the _Unio_; marine, or\r\ninhabiting the sea exclusively, as the Cowry (_Cypræa_), and the Oyster,\r\n(_Ostrea_).\r\n\r\nFossils are sometimes preserved in their natural state, or are but very\r\nslightly changed. Such is the state of some of the bones extracted from\r\nthe more recent caves; such, also, is the condition of the insects found\r\nenclosed in the fossil resins in which they have been preserved from\r\ndecomposition; and certain shells, found in recent and even in old\r\nformations, such as the Jurassic and Cretaceous strata--in some of which\r\nthe shells retain their colours, as well as their brilliant pearly\r\nlustre or nacre. At Trouville, in Normandy, in the Kimeridge strata,\r\nmagnificent _Ammonites_ are found in the clay and marl, all brilliant\r\nwith the colours of mother-of-pearl. In the Cretaceous beds at\r\nMachéroménil, some species of _Ancyloceras_ and _Hamites_ are found\r\nstill covered with a nacre, displaying brilliant reflections of blue,\r\ngreen, and red, and retaining an admirable lustre. At Glos, near\r\nLiseaux, in the Coral Rag, not only the _Ammonites_, but the _Trigoniæ_\r\nand _Aviculæ_ have preserved all their brilliant nacre. Sometimes these\r\nremains are much changed, the organic matter having entirely\r\ndisappeared; it sometimes happens also, though rarely, that they become\r\npetrified, that is to say, the external form is preserved, but the\r\noriginal organic elements have wholly disappeared, and have been\r\nreplaced by foreign mineral substances--generally by silica or by\r\ncarbonate of lime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Labyrinthodon pachygnathus and footmarks.]\r\n\r\nGeology also enables us to draw very important conclusions from certain\r\nfossil remains whose true nature was long misunderstood, and which,\r\nunder the name of _coprolites_, had given rise to much controversial\r\ndiscussion. Coprolites are the petrified excrements of extinct fossil\r\nanimals. The study of these singular remains has thrown unexpected light\r\non the habits and physiological organisation of some of the great\r\nantediluvian animals. Their examination has revealed the scales and\r\nteeth of fishes, thus enabling us to determine the kind of food in which\r\nthe animals of the ancient world indulged: for example, the coprolites\r\nof the great marine reptile which bears the name of _Ichthyosaurus_\r\ncontain the bones of other animals, together with the remains of the\r\nvertebræ, or of the phalanges (paddle-bones) of other Ichthyosauri;\r\nshowing that this animal habitually fed on the flesh of its own species,\r\nas many fishes, especially the more voracious ones, do in our days.\r\n\r\nThe imprints left upon mud or sand, which time has hardened and\r\ntransformed into sandstone, furnish to the geologist another series of\r\nvaluable indications. The reptiles of the ancient world, the turtles in\r\nparticular, have left upon the sands, which time has transformed into\r\nblocks of stone, impressions which evidently represent the exact moulds\r\nof the feet of those animals. These impressions have, sometimes, been\r\nsufficient for naturalists to determine to what species the animal\r\nbelonged which thus left its impress on the wet ground. Some of these\r\nexhibit tracks to which we shall have occasion to refer; others present\r\ntraces of the footprints of the great reptile known as the\r\n_Labyrinthodon_ or _Cheirotherium_, whose footmarks slightly resemble\r\nthe impression made by the human hand (Fig. 1). Another well-known\r\nimpression, which has been left upon the sandstone of Corncockle Moor,\r\nin Dumfriesshire, is supposed to be the impress of the foot of some\r\ngreat fossil Turtle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Impressions of rain-drops.]\r\n\r\nWe may be permitted to offer a short remark on this subject. The\r\nhistorian and antiquary may traverse the battle-fields of the Greeks and\r\nRomans, and search in vain for traces of those conquerors, whose armies\r\nravaged the world. Time, which has overthrown the monuments of their\r\nvictories, has also effaced the marks of their footsteps; and of the\r\nmany millions of men whose invasions have spread desolation throughout\r\nEurope, not even a trace of a footprint is left. Those reptiles, on the\r\nother hand, which crawled thousands of ages ago on the surface of our\r\nplanet when it was still in its infancy, have impressed on the soil\r\nindelible proofs of their existence. Hannibal and his legions, the\r\nbarbarians and their savage hordes, have passed over the land without\r\nleaving a material mark of their passage; while the poor turtle, which\r\ndragged itself along the silent shores of the primitive seas, has\r\nbequeathed to learned posterity the image and impression of a part of\r\nits body. These imprints may be perceived as distinctly on the rocks, as\r\nthe traces left on moist sand or in newly-fallen snow by some animal\r\nwalking under our own eyes. What grave reflections should be awakened\r\nwithin us at the sight of these blocks of hardened earth, which thus\r\ncarry back our thoughts to the early ages of the world! and how\r\ninsignificant seem the discoveries of the archæologist who throws\r\nhimself into ecstacies before some piece of Greek or Etruscan pottery,\r\nwhen compared with these veritable antiquities of the earth!\r\n\r\nThe palæontologist (from παλαιος “ancient,” οντος “being,” λογος\r\n“discourse”), who occupies himself with the study of animated beings\r\nwhich have lived on the earth, takes careful account also of the sort of\r\nmoulds left by organised bodies in the fine sediment which has enveloped\r\nthem after death. Many organic beings have left no trace of their\r\nexistence in Nature, except their impressions, which we find perfectly\r\npreserved in the sandstone and limestone, in marl or clay, and in the\r\ncoal-measures; and these moulds are sufficient to tell us the kind to\r\nwhich the living animals belonged. We shall, no doubt, astonish our\r\nreaders when we tell them that there are blocks of sandstone with\r\ndistinct impressions of drops of rain which had fallen upon sea-shores\r\nof the ancient world. The impressions of these rain-drops, made upon the\r\nsands, were preserved by desiccation; and these same sands, being\r\ntransformed by subsequent hardening into solid and coherent sandstones,\r\ntheir impressions have been thus preserved to the present day. Fig. 2\r\nrepresents impressions of this kind upon the sandstone of Connecticut\r\nriver in America, which have been reproduced from the block itself by\r\nphotography. In a depression of the granitic rocks of Massachusetts and\r\nConnecticut, the red sandstone occupies an area of a hundred and fifty\r\nmiles in length from north to south, and from five to ten miles in\r\nbreadth. “On some shales of the finest texture,” says Sir Charles Lyell,\r\n“impressions of rain-drops may be seen, and casts of them in the\r\nargillaceous sandstones.” The same impressions occur in the recent red\r\nmud of the Bay of Fundy. In addition to these, the undulations left by\r\nthe passage of the waters of the sea, over the sands of the primitive\r\nworld, are preserved by the same physical agency. Traces of undulations\r\nof this kind have been found in the neighbourhood of Boulogne-sur-Mer,\r\nand elsewhere. Similar phenomena occur in a still more striking manner\r\nin some sandstone-quarries worked at Chalindrey (Haute-Marne). The\r\nstrata there present traces of the same kind over a large area, and\r\nalong with them impressions of the excrements of marine worms. One may\r\nalmost imagine oneself to be standing on the sea-shore while the tide is\r\nebbing.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL AND NEBULAR HYPOTHESES OF THE GLOBE.\r\n\r\nAmong the innumerable hypotheses which human ingenuity has framed to\r\nexplain the phenomena which surround the globe, the two which have found\r\nmost ready acceptance have been termed respectively the CHEMICAL, and\r\nthe NEBULAR or mechanical hypothesis. By the first the solid crust is\r\nsupposed to have contained abundance of potassium, sodium, calcium,\r\nmagnesium, and other metallic elements. The percolating waters, coming\r\nin contact with these substances, produce combinations resulting in the\r\nconversion of the metals into their oxides--potash, soda, lime, and\r\nmagnesia--all of which enter largely into the composition of volcanic\r\nrocks. The second hypothesis involves the idea of an original\r\nincandescent mass of vapour, succeeded by a great and still existing\r\ncentral fire.\r\n\r\nThis idea of a great central fire is a very ancient hypothesis: admitted\r\nby Descartes, developed by Leibnitz, and advocated by Buffon, it is\r\nsupposed to account for many phenomena otherwise inexplicable; and it is\r\nconfirmed by a crowd of facts, and adopted, or at least not opposed, by\r\nthe leading authorities of the age. Dr. Buckland makes it the basis of\r\nhis Bridgewater treatise. Herschel, Hind, Murchison, Lyell, Phillips,\r\nand other leading English astronomers and geologists give a cautious\r\nadhesion to the doctrine. The following are some of the principal\r\narguments adduced in support of the hypothesis, for, in the nature of\r\nthe proofs it admits of, it can be no more.\r\n\r\nWhen we descend into the interior of a mine, it is found that the\r\ntemperature rises in an appreciable manner, and that it increases with\r\nthe depth below the surface.\r\n\r\nThe high temperature of the waters in Artesian wells when these are very\r\ndeep, testifies to a great heat of the interior of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe thermal waters which issue from the earth--of which the temperature\r\nsometimes rises to 100° Centigrade and upwards--as, for instance, the\r\nGeysers of Iceland--furnish another proof in support of the hypothesis.\r\n\r\nModern volcanoes are said to be a visible demonstration of the existence\r\nof central heat. The heated gases, the liquid lava, the flames which\r\nescape from their craters, all tend to prove sufficiently that the\r\ninterior of the globe has a temperature prodigiously elevated as\r\ncompared with that at its surface.\r\n\r\nThe disengagement of gases and burning vapours through the accidental\r\nfissures in the crust, which accompany earthquakes, still further tends\r\nto establish the existence of a great heat in the interior of the globe.\r\n\r\nWe have already said that the temperature of the globe increases about\r\none degree for every sixty or seventy feet of depth beneath its surface.\r\nThe correctness of this observation has been verified in a great number\r\nof instances--indeed, to the greatest depth to which man has penetrated,\r\nand been able to make use of the thermometer. Now, as we know exactly\r\nthe length of the radius of the terrestrial sphere, it has been\r\ncalculated from this progression of temperature, supposing it to be\r\nregular and uniform, that the centre of the globe ought to have at the\r\npresent time a mean temperature of 195,000° Centigrade. No matter could\r\npreserve its solid state at this excessive temperature; it follows,\r\nthen, that the centre of the globe, and all parts near the centre, must\r\nbe in a permanent state of fluidity.\r\n\r\nThe works of Werner, of Hutton, of Leopold von Buch, of Humboldt, of\r\nCordier, W. Hopkins, Buckland, and some other English philosophers, have\r\nreduced this hypothesis to a theory, on which has been based, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, the whole science of modern geology; although,\r\nproperly speaking, and in the popular acceptation of the term, that\r\nscience only deals with the solid crust of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe nebular theory thus embraces the whole solar system, and, by\r\nanalogy, the universe. It assumes that the SUN was originally a mass of\r\nincandescent matter, that vast body being brought into a state of\r\nevolution by the action of laws to which the Creator, in His divine\r\nwisdom, has subjected all matter. In consequence of its immense\r\nexpansion and attenuation, the exterior zone of vapour, expanding beyond\r\nthe sphere of attraction, is supposed to have been thrown off by\r\ncentrifugal force. This zone of vapour, which may be supposed at one\r\ntime to have resembled the rings of Saturn, would in time break up into\r\nseveral masses, and these masses coalescing into globes, would (by the\r\ngreater power of attraction which they would assume as consolidated\r\nbodies) revolve round the sun, and, from mechanical considerations,\r\nwould also revolve with a rotary motion on their own axes.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine is applied to all the planets, and assumes each to have\r\nbeen in a state of incandescent vapour, with a central incandescent\r\nnucleus. As the cooling went on, each of these bodies may be supposed to\r\nhave thrown off similar masses of vapour, which, by the operation of the\r\nsame laws, would assume the rotary state, and, as satellites, revolve\r\nround the parent planet. Such, in brief, was the grand conception of\r\nLaplace; and surely it detracts nothing from our notions of the\r\nomnipotence of the Creator that it initiates the creation step by step,\r\nand under the laws to which matter is subjected, rather than by the\r\ndirect fiat of the Almighty. The hypothesis assumes that as the vaporous\r\nmass cooled by the radiation of heat into space, the particles of matter\r\nwould approximate and solidify.\r\n\r\nThat the figure of the earth is such as a very large mass of matter in a\r\nstate of fluidity would assume from a state of rotation, seems to be\r\nadmitted, thus corroborating the speculations of Leibnitz, that the\r\nearth is to be looked on as a heated fluid globe, cooled, and still\r\ncooling at the surface, by radiation of its superfluous heat into space.\r\nMr. W. Hopkins[7] has put forth some strong but simple reasons in\r\nsupport of a different theory; although he does not attempt to solve the\r\nproblem, but leaves the reader to form his own conclusions. As far as we\r\nhave been able to follow his reasoning we gather from it that:--\r\n\r\n  [7] See _Phil. Transactions_, 1839-40-42; also, _Quarterly Journal of\r\n      the Geological Society_, vol. viii., p. 56.\r\n\r\nIf the earth were a fluid mass cooled by radiation, the cooled parts\r\nwould, by the laws of circulating fluids, descend towards the centre,\r\nand be replaced on the surface by matter at a higher temperature.\r\n\r\nThe consolidation of such a mass would, therefore, be accompanied by a\r\nstruggle for superiority between pressure and temperature, both of which\r\nwould be at their maximum at the centre of the mass.\r\n\r\nAt the surface, it would be a question of rapidity of cooling, by\r\nradiation, as compared with the internal condition--for comparing which\r\nrelations we are without data; but on the result of which depends\r\nwhether such a body would most rapidly solidify at the surface by\r\nradiation, or at the centre by pressure.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the first would be solidification at the surface, followed\r\nby condensation at the centre through pressure. There would thus be two\r\nmasses, a spherical fluid nucleus, and a spherical shell or envelope,\r\nwith a large zone of semi-fluid, pasty matter between, continually\r\nchanging its temperature as its outer or inner surface became converted\r\nto the solid state.\r\n\r\nIf pressure, on the other hand, gained the victory, the centre would\r\nsolidify before the circulation of the heated matter had ceased; and the\r\nsolidifying process would proceed through a large portion of the globe,\r\nand even approach the surface before that would become solid. In other\r\nwords, solidification would proceed from the centre until the\r\ndiminishing power of pressure was balanced by radiation, when the\r\ngradual abstraction of heat would allow the particles to approximate and\r\nbecome solid.\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial sphere may thus be a solid indurated mass at the centre,\r\nwith a solid stony crust at the surface, and a shifting viscous, but\r\ndaily-decreasing, mass between the two; a supposition which the\r\ndiminished and diminishing frequency and magnitude of volcanic and other\r\neruptive convulsions seem to render not improbable.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that amongst the various hypotheses of which\r\nthe cosmogony of the world has been the object, a literal acceptation of\r\nthe scriptural account finds no defenders among men of science. “Why,”\r\nasks one of these writers,[8] after some scornful remarks upon the\r\ngeologists and their science--“why an omnipotent Creator should have\r\ncalled into being a gaseous-granite nebulous world, only to have to cool\r\nit down again, consisting as it does of an endless variety of\r\nsubstances, should even have been supposed to be originally constituted\r\nof the matter of granite alone, for nothing else was provided by the\r\ntheory, nobody can rationally explain. How the earth’s centre now could\r\nbe liquid fire with its surface solid and cold and its seas not boiling\r\ncaldrons, has never been attempted to be accounted for. How educated\r\ngentlemen, engaged in scientific investigations, ever came to accept\r\nsuch a monstrously stupid mass of absurdities as deductions of\r\n‘science,’ and put them in comparison with the rational account of the\r\ncreation given by Moses, is more difficult to understand than even this\r\nvague theory itself, which it is impossible to describe.\r\n\r\n  [8] “Fresh Springs of Truth.” R. Griffin and Co.\r\n\r\n“Of the first creation of the chaotic world,” the same writer goes on to\r\nsay, “or the material elements, before they were shaped into their\r\npresent forms, we can scarce have the most vague conception. All our\r\nexperience relates to their existing conditions. But knowing somewhat of\r\nthe variety of the constituent elements and their distinct properties,\r\nby which they manifest their existence to us, we cannot conceive of\r\ntheir creation without presupposing a Divine wisdom, and--if I may say\r\nso, with all reverence, and only to suit our human notions--a Divine\r\ningenuity,” and he follows for six days the operations as described by\r\nMoses, with a running comment. When light is created, the conception of\r\nthe work becomes simpler to our minds. Its least manifestation would\r\nsuffice at once to dispel darkness, and yet how marvellous is the light!\r\nIn the second day’s work the firmament of heaven is opened; the expanse\r\nof the air between the heavens and the earth, dividing the waters above\r\nfrom the waters below, is the work recorded as performed. Not till the\r\nthird day commence the first geological operations. The waters of the\r\nearth are gathered together into seas, and the dry land is made to\r\nappear. It is now that we can imagine that the formation of the primary\r\nstrata commenced, while by some of the internal forces of matter the\r\nearth was elevated and stood above the waters.\r\n\r\nImmediately the dry land is raised above and separated from the waters\r\nthe fiat goes forth, “Let the earth _bring forth_ grass, and herb and\r\ntree;” vegetable life begins to exist, and the world is first decorated\r\nwith its beauteous flora, with all its exquisite variety of forms and\r\nbrilliancy of colouring, with which not even Solomon in all his glory\r\ncan compare. In like manner, on the sixth day the earth is commanded to\r\nbring forth land-animals--the living creature “after his kind,” cattle\r\nand creeping thing, and beast of the earth, “after his kind;” and last\r\nof all, but on the same day, man is created, and made the chief and\r\nmonarch of God’s other living creatures--for that is “man’s place in\r\nNature.” “Let us now see,” he continues, “how this history came to be\r\ndiscredited by the opposition of a falsely so-called ‘science’ of\r\ngeology, that, while spared by our theologians, has since pulled itself\r\nto pieces. The first step in the false inductions geology made arose\r\nfrom the rash deduction, that the order in which the fossil remains of\r\norganic being were found deposited in the various strata necessarily\r\ndetermined the order of their creation; and the next error arose from\r\nblindly rushing to rash conclusions, and hasty generalisation from a\r\nvery limited number of facts, and the most imperfect investigations.\r\nThere were also (and, indeed, are still) some wild dogmatisms as to the\r\ntime necessary to produce certain geologic formations; but the\r\nabsurdities of science culminated when it adopted from Laplace the\r\nirrational and unintelligible theory of a _natural_ origin for the world\r\nfrom a nebula of gaseous granite, intensely hot, and supposed to be\r\ngradually cooled while gyrating senselessly in space.”\r\n\r\nIn this paper the writer does not attempt to deal with the various\r\nphenomena of volcanoes, earthquakes, hot springs, and other matters\r\nwhich are usually considered as proofs of great internal heat. Mr. Evan\r\nHopkins, C.E., F.G.S., is more precise if less eloquent. He shows that,\r\nin tropical countries, plains of gravel may in a day be converted into\r\nlagoons and marshes; that by the fall of an avalanche rivers have been\r\nblocked up, which, bursting their banks, have covered many square miles\r\nof fertile country with several feet of mud, sand, and gravel. “Two\r\nthousand four hundred years ago,” he says, “Nineveh flourished in all\r\nits grandeur, yet it is now buried in oblivion, and its site overwhelmed\r\nwith sand. Look at old Tyre, once the queen of cities and mistress of\r\nthe sea. She was in all her pride two thousand four hundred and forty\r\nyears ago. We now see but a bare rock in the sea, on which fishermen\r\nspread their nets! A thousand years ago, according to Icelandic\r\nhistories, Greenland was a fertile land in the south, and supported a\r\nlarge population. Iceland at that period was covered with forests of\r\nbirch and fir, and the inhabitants cultivated barley and other grain. We\r\nmay, therefore, conclude, with these facts before us, that there is no\r\nnecessity to assign myriads of ages to terrestrial changes, as assumed\r\nby geologists, as they can be accounted for by means of alterations\r\neffected during a few thousand years, for the surface of the earth is\r\never changing.\r\n\r\n“Grant geological speculators,” Mr. Hopkins continues, “a few millions\r\nof centuries, with a command over the agencies of Nature to be brought\r\ninto operation when and how they please, and they think they can form a\r\nworld with every variety of rock and vegetation, and even transform a\r\nworm into a man! Yet the wisest of our philosophers would be puzzled if\r\ncalled upon to explain why fluids become spheres, as dew-drops; why\r\ncarbonate of lime acquires in solidifying from a liquid the figure of an\r\nobtuse rhomboihedron, silica of a six-sided prism; and why oxygen and\r\nhydrogen gases produce both _fire_ and _water_. And what do they gain,”\r\nhe proceeds to ask, “by carrying back the history of the world to these\r\nmyriads of centuries? Do they, by the extension of the period to\r\ninfinity, explain how the ‘_Original_’ materials were created? But,” he\r\nadds, “geologists are by no means agreed in their assumed geological\r\nperiods! The so-called glacial period has been computed by some to be\r\nequal to about eighty-three thousand years, and by others at even as\r\nmuch as twelve hundred and eighty millions of years! Were we to ask for\r\na _demonstrative proof_ of any given deposit being more than four or\r\nfive thousand years old, they could not give it. Where is Babylon, the\r\nglory of the kingdoms? Look at Thebes, and behold its colossal columns,\r\nstatues, temples, obelisks, and palaces desolated; and yet those great\r\ncities flourished within the last three thousand years. Even Pompeii and\r\nHerculaneum were all but lost to history! What,” he asks after these\r\nbrief allusions to the past--“what, as a matter of fact, have geologists\r\ndiscovered, as regards the great terrestrial changes, more than was\r\nknown to Pythagoras and the ancient philosophers who taught, two\r\nthousand three hundred and fifty years ago, ‘that the surface of the\r\nearth was ever changing--solid land converted into sea, sea changed into\r\ndry land, marine shells lying far distant from the deep, valleys\r\nexcavated by running water, and floods washing down hills into the\r\nsea?’”\r\n\r\nIn reference to the argument of the vast antiquity of the earth, founded\r\non elevation of coasts at a given rate of upheaval, he adduces many\r\nfacts to show that upheavals of equal extent have occurred almost within\r\nthe memory of man. Two hundred and fifty years ago Sir Francis Drake,\r\nwith his fleet, sailed into Albemarle Sound through Roanoke Outlet,\r\nwhich is now a sand-bank above the reach of the highest tides. Only\r\nseventy years ago it was navigable by vessels drawing twelve feet of\r\nwater. The whole American coast, both on the Atlantic and Pacific, have\r\nundergone great changes within the last hundred years. The coast of\r\nSouth America has, in some places, been upheaved twenty feet in the last\r\ncentury; in others, a few hundred miles distant, it has been depressed\r\nto an equal extent. A transverse section from Rio Santa Cruz to the base\r\nof the Cordilleras, and another in the Rio Negro, in Patagonia, showed\r\nthat the whole sedimentary series is of recent origin. Scattered over\r\nthe whole at various heights above the sea, from thirteen hundred feet\r\ndownwards, are found recent shells of _littoral_ species of the\r\nneighbouring coast--denoting upheavals which might have been effected\r\nduring the last three thousand years.\r\n\r\nComing nearer home, he shows that in 1538 the whole coast of Pozzuoli,\r\nnear Naples, was raised twenty feet in a single night. Then, with regard\r\nto more compact crystalline or semi-crystalline rocks, no reliable\r\nopinion can be formed on mere inspection. Two blocks of marble may\r\nappear precisely alike, though formed at different periods. A crystal of\r\ncarbonate of lime, formed in a few years, would be found quite perfect,\r\nand as compact as a crystal formed during many centuries. Nothing can be\r\ndeduced from the process of petrifaction and crystallisation, unless\r\nthey enclose relics of a known period. At San Filippo, a solid mass of\r\nlimestone thirty feet thick has been formed in about twenty years. A\r\nhard stratum of travertine a foot thick is obtained, from these thermal\r\nsprings, in the course of four months. Nor can geologists demonstrate\r\nthat the Amiens deposits, in which the flint-implements occur, are more\r\nthan three or four thousand years old.\r\n\r\nThe causes of these changes and mutations are referred by some persons\r\nto floods, or to pre-Adamite convulsions, whereas the cause is in\r\nconstant operation; they are due to an invisible and subtle power which\r\npervades the air, the ocean, and the rocks below--in which all are\r\nwrapped and permeated--which is universally present, namely,\r\nmagnetism--a power always in operation, always in a state of activity\r\nand tension. It has an attractive power towards the surface of the\r\nearth, as well as a directive action from pole to pole. “It is, indeed,”\r\nhe adds, emphatically, “the _terrestrial gravitation_. Magnetic needles\r\nfreely suspended show its meridional or directive polar force, and that\r\nthe force converges at two opposite parts, which are bounded by the\r\nAntarctic and Arctic circles.”\r\n\r\nThis polar force, like a stream, is constantly moving from pole to pole;\r\nand experiment proves that this movement is from the South Pole to the\r\nNorth. “Hence the various terrestrial substances, solids and fluids,\r\nthrough which this subtle and universal power permeates, are controlled,\r\npropelled, and modified over the entire surface of our globe, commencing\r\nat the south and dissolving at the north. Thus, all terrestrial matter\r\nmoves towards the Arctic region, and finally disappears by dissolution\r\nand absorption, to be renewed again and again in the Antarctic Sea to\r\nthe end of time.”\r\n\r\nIn order to prove that the north polar basin is the receptacle of the\r\nfinal dissolution of all terrestrial substances, Mr. Hopkins quotes the\r\nGulf Stream. Bottles, tropical plants, and wrecks cast into the sea in\r\nthe South Atlantic, are carried to Greenland in a comparatively short\r\ntime. The great _tidal_ waves commence at the fountain-head in the\r\nAntarctic circle, impinge against the south coast of Tierra del Fuego,\r\nNew Zealand, and Tasmania, and are then propelled northward in a series\r\nof undulations. The South Atlantic stream, after doubling the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, moves towards the Guinea coast, bends towards the Caribbean\r\nSea, producing the trade winds; again leaves Florida as the Gulf Stream,\r\nand washes the coasts of Greenland and Norway, and finally reaches the\r\nnorth polar basin.\r\n\r\nAgain the great polar force shows itself in the arrangement of the\r\nmineral structure below. In all the primary rocks in every quarter of\r\nthe globe where they have been examined, its action is recognised in\r\ngiving to the crystalline masses--granites and their laminated\r\nelongations--a polar grain and vertical cleavage. “Had it been possible\r\nto see our globe stripped of its sedimentary deposits and its oceanic\r\ncovering, we should see it like a gigantic melon, with a uniform grain\r\nextending from pole to pole.” This structure appears to give polarity to\r\nearthquakes--thermal waters and earthquakes--which are all traceable in\r\nthe direction of the polar grain or cleavage from north to south.\r\n\r\nIn England, for instance, thermal and saline springs are traceable from\r\nBath, through Cheltenham, to Dudley. In Central France, mineral springs\r\noccur in lines, more or less, north and south. All the known\r\nsalt-springs in South America occur in meridional bands. Springs of\r\nchloride of sodium in the Eastern Cordilleras stretch from Pinceima to\r\nthe Llanoes de Meta, a distance of 200 miles. The most productive\r\nmetalliferous deposits are found in meridional bands. The watery\r\nvolcanoes in South America are generally situated along the lines of the\r\nmeridional splits and the secondary eruptive pores on the transverse\r\nfractures. The sudden ruptures arising locally from increasing tension\r\nof the polar force, and the rapid expansion of the generated gases,\r\nproduce a vibratory jar in the rocky structure below, which being\r\npropagated along the planes of the polar cleavage, gives rise to great\r\nsuperficial oscillations, and thus causes earthquakes and subterranean\r\nthunder for thousands of miles, from south to north.\r\n\r\nIn 1797, the district round the volcano of Tunguraqua in Quito, during\r\none of the great meridional shocks, experienced an undulating movement,\r\nwhich lasted upwards of four minutes, and this was propagated to the\r\nshores of the Caribbean Sea.\r\n\r\nAll these movements demonstrated, according to Mr. Hopkins, that the\r\nland as well as the ocean moves from the south pole and north pole, and\r\nthat the magnetic power has a tendency to proceed from pole to pole in a\r\n_spiral_ path from south-east to north-west, a movement which produces\r\nan apparent change in the equinoxes, or the outer section of the plane\r\nof the ecliptic with the equator, a phenomenon known to astronomers as\r\nthe precession of the equinoxes.\r\n\r\nSuch is a very brief summary of the arguments by which Mr. Evan Hopkins\r\nmaintains the literal correctness of the Mosaic account of the creation,\r\nand attempts to show that all the facts discovered by geologists may\r\nhave occurred in the ages included in the Mosaic chronology.\r\n\r\nThat the mysterious power of terrestrial magnetism can perform all that\r\nhe claims for it, we can perhaps admit. But how does this explain the\r\nsuccession of Silurian, Old Red Sandstone, Carboniferous and other\r\nstrata, up to the Tertiary deposits, with their fossils, each differing\r\nin character from those of the preceding series? That these were\r\nsuccessive creations admits of no doubt, and while it is undeniable that\r\nthe fiat of the Creator could readily produce all these phenomena, it\r\nmay reasonably be asked if it is probable that all these myriads of\r\norganic beings, whose remains serve as records of their existence, were\r\ncreated only to be immediately destroyed.\r\n\r\nAgain, does not the author of the “Principles of Terrestrial Physics”\r\nprove too much? He admits that 3,000 years ago the climate of England\r\nwas tropical: he does not deny that a subsequent period of intense cold\r\nintervened, 2,550 years ago. He admits historical records, and 2,350\r\nyears ago Pythagoras constructed his cosmography of the world, which has\r\nnever been seriously impugned; and yet he has no suspicion that\r\ncountries so near to his own had changed their climates first from\r\ntropical to glacial, and back again to a temperate zone. It is not\r\nreasonable to believe this parable.\r\n\r\nThe school of philosophy generally considered to be the most advanced in\r\nmodern science has yet another view of cosmogony, of which we venture to\r\ngive a brief outline. Space is infinite, says the exponent of this\r\nsystem,[9] for wherever in imagination we erect a boundary, we are\r\ncompelled to think of space as existing beyond it. The starry heavens\r\nproclaim that it is not entirely void; but the question remains, are the\r\nvast regions which surround the stars, and across which light is\r\npropagated, absolutely empty? No. Modern science, while it rejects the\r\nnotion of the luminiferous particles of the old philosophy, has cogent\r\nproofs of the existence of a luminiferous ether with definite mechanical\r\nproperties. It is infinitely more attenuated, but more solid than gas.\r\nIt resembles jelly rather than air, and if not co-extensive with space,\r\nit extends as far as the most distant star the telescope reveals to us;\r\nit is the vehicle of their light in fact; it takes up their molecular\r\ntremors and conveys them with inconceivable rapidity to our organs of\r\nvision. The splendour of the firmament at night is due to this\r\nvibration. If this ether has a boundary, masses of ponderable matter may\r\nexist beyond it, but they could emit no light. Dark suns may burn there,\r\nmetals may be heated to fusion in invisible furnaces, planets may be\r\nmolten amid intense darkness; for the loss of heat being simply the\r\nabstraction of molecular motion by the ether, where this medium is\r\nabsent no cooling could take place.\r\n\r\n  [9] Professor Tyndall in _Fortnightly Review_.\r\n\r\nThis, however, does not concern us; as far as our knowledge of space\r\nextends, we are to conceive of it as the holder of this luminiferous\r\nether, through which the fixed stars are interspersed at enormous\r\ndistances apart. Associated with our planet we have a group of dark\r\nplanetary masses revolving at various distances around it, each rotating\r\non its axis; and, connected with them, their moons. Was space furnished\r\nat once, by the fiat of Omnipotence, with these burning orbs? The man of\r\nscience should give no answer to this question: but he has better\r\nmaterials to guide him than anybody else, and can clearly show that the\r\npresent state of things _may_ be derivative. He can perhaps assign\r\nreasons which render it probable that it _is derivative_. The law of\r\ngravitation enunciated by Newton is, that every particle of matter in\r\nthe universe attracts every other particle with a force which diminishes\r\nas the square of the distance increases. Under this law a stone falls to\r\nthe ground, and heat is produced by the shock; meteors plunge into the\r\natmosphere and become incandescent; showers of such doubtless fall\r\nincessantly upon the sun, and were it stopped in its orbit, the earth\r\nwould rush towards the sun, developing heat in the collision (according\r\nto the calculations of MM. Joule, Mayer, Helmholtz, and Thomson), equal\r\nto the combustion of five thousand worlds of solid coal. In the\r\nattraction of gravity, therefore, acting upon this luminous matter, we\r\nhave a source of heat more powerful than could be derived from any\r\nterrestrial combustion.\r\n\r\nTo the above conception of space we must add that of its being in a\r\ncontinual state of tremor. The sources of vibration are the ponderable\r\nmasses of the universe. Our own planet is an aggregate of solids,\r\nliquids, and gases. On closer examination, these are found to be\r\ncomposed of still more elementary parts: the water of our rivers is\r\nformed by the union, in definite proportions, of two gases, oxygen and\r\nhydrogen. So, likewise, our chalk hills are formed by a combination of\r\ncarbon, oxygen, and calcium; elements which in definite proportions form\r\nchalk. The flint found within that chalk is compounded of oxygen and\r\nsilicon, and our ordinary clay is for the most part formed by a union\r\nof silicon, oxygen, and aluminum. By far the greater part of the earthy\r\ncrust is thus compounded of a few elementary substances.\r\n\r\nSuch is Professor Tyndall’s view of the universe, rising incidentally\r\nout of his theory of heat, his main object being to elucidate his theory\r\nof heat and light.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODIFICATIONS OF THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of the hypothesis of central heat, it is admitted that\r\nour planet has been agitated by a series of local disturbances; that is\r\nto say, by ruptures of its solid crust occurring at more or less distant\r\nintervals. These partial revolutions at the surface are supposed to have\r\nbeen produced, as we shall have occasion to explain, by upheavals or\r\ndepressions of the solid crust, resulting from the fluidity of the\r\ncentral parts, and by the cooling down of the external crust of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nAlmost all bodies, in passing from a liquid to a solid state, are\r\ndiminished in size in the process. In molten metals which resume the\r\nsolid state by cooling, this diminution amounts to about a tenth of\r\ntheir volume; but the decrease in size is not equal throughout the whole\r\nmass. Hence, as a result of the solidification of the internal parts of\r\nthe globe, the outer envelope would be too large; and would no longer\r\nfit the inner sphere, which had contracted in cooling. Cracks and\r\nhollows occur under such circumstances, even in small masses, and the\r\neffect of converting such a vast body as the earth from a liquid, or\r\nrather molten condition, to a solid state, may be imagined. As the\r\ninterior became solid and concrete by cooling, furrows, corrugations,\r\nand depressions in the external crust of the globe would occur, causing\r\ngreat inequalities in its surface; producing, in short, what are now\r\ncalled _chains of mountains_.\r\n\r\nAt other times, in lieu of furrows and irregularities, the solid crust\r\nhas become ruptured, producing fissures and fractures in the outer\r\nenvelope, sometimes of immense extent. The liquid substances contained\r\nin the interior of the globe, with or without the action of the gases\r\nthey enclose, escape through these openings; and, accumulating on the\r\nsurface, become, on cooling and consolidating, _mountains_ of various\r\nheights.\r\n\r\nIt would also happen, and always from the same cause, namely, from the\r\ninternal contraction caused by the unequal cooling of the globe, that\r\nminor fissures would be formed in the earth’s crust; incandescent liquid\r\nmatter would be afterwards injected into these fissures, filling them\r\nup, and forming in the rocky crust those long narrow lines of foreign\r\nsubstances which we call _dykes_.\r\n\r\nFinally, it would occasionally happen, that in place of molten matter,\r\nsuch as granite or metalliferous compounds, escaping through these\r\nfractures and fissures in the globe, actual rivers of boiling water,\r\nabundantly charged with various mineral salts (that is to say, with\r\nsilicates, and with calcareous and magnesian compounds), would also\r\nescape, since the elements of water would be abundant in the\r\nincandescent mass. Added to these the chemical and mechanical action of\r\nthe atmosphere, of rain, rivers, and the sea, have all a tendency to\r\ndestroy the hardest rocks. The mineral salts and other foreign\r\nsubstances, entering into combination with those already present in the\r\nwaters of the sea, and separating at a subsequent period from these\r\nwaters, would be thrown down, and thus constitute extensive\r\ndeposits--that is to say, _sedimentary formations_. These became, on\r\nconsolidation, the _sedimentary rocks_.\r\n\r\nThe furrows, corrugations, and fractures in the terrestrial crust, which\r\nso changed the aspect of the surface, and for the time displaced the\r\nsea-basins, would be followed by periods of calm. During these periods,\r\nthe débris, torn by the movement of the waters from certain points of\r\nthe land, would be transported to other parts of the globe by the\r\noceanic currents. These accumulated heterogeneous materials, when\r\ndeposited at a later period, would ultimately constitute\r\nformations--that is, _transported or drifted rocks_.\r\n\r\nWe have ventured to explain some of the theories by which it is sought\r\nto explain the cosmography of the world. But our readers must understand\r\nthat all such speculations are, of necessity, purely hypothetical.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the preceding considerations we shall divide the\r\nmineral substances of which the earth is composed into three general\r\ngroups, under the following heads:--\r\n\r\n1. _Eruptive Rocks._--Crystalline, like the second, but formed at all\r\ngeological periods by the irruption or intrusion of the liquid matter\r\noccupying the interior of our globe through all the pre-existing rocks.\r\n\r\n2. _Crystalline Rocks._--That portion of the terrestrial crust which was\r\nprimarily liquid, owing to the heat of the globe, but which solidified\r\nat the period of its first cooling down; forming the masses known as\r\nFundamental Gneiss, and Laurentian, &c.\r\n\r\n3. _Sedimentary Rocks._--Consisting of various mineral substances\r\ndeposited by the water of the sea, such as silica, the carbonates of\r\nlime and magnesia, &c.\r\n\r\nThe mineral masses which constitute the _sedimentary rocks_ form beds,\r\nor _strata_, having among themselves a constant order of superposition\r\nwhich indicates their relative age. The mineral structure of these beds,\r\nand the remains of the organised beings they contain, impress on them\r\ncharacters which enable us to distinguish each bed from that which\r\nprecedes and follows it.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow, however, that all these beds are met with, regularly\r\nsuperimposed, over the whole surface of the globe; under such\r\ncircumstances geology would be a very simple science, only requiring the\r\nuse of the eyes. In consequence of the frequent eruptions of granite,\r\nporphyry, serpentine, trachyte, basalt, and lava, these beds are often\r\nbroken, cut off, and replaced by others.\r\n\r\n_Denudation_ has been another fruitful source of change. Professor\r\nRamsay[10] shows, in the “Memoirs of the Geological Survey,” that beds\r\nonce existed above a great part of the Mendip Hills to the extent of at\r\nleast 6,000 feet, which have been removed by the denuding agency of the\r\nsea; while in South Wales and the adjacent country, a series of\r\nPalaeozoic rocks, eleven thousand feet in thickness, has been removed by\r\nthe action of water. In fact, every foot of the earth now forming the\r\ndry land is supposed to have been at one time under water--to have\r\nemerged, and to have been again submerged, and subjected to the\r\ndestructive action of the ocean. At certain points a whole series of\r\nsedimentary deposits, and often several of them, have been removed by\r\nthis cause, known by geologists as _Denudation_. The regular series of\r\nrock formations are, in fact, rarely found in unbroken order. It is only\r\nby combining the collected observations of the geologists of all\r\ncountries, that we are enabled to arrange, according to their relative\r\nages, the several beds composing the solid terrestrial crust as they\r\noccur in the following Table, which proceeds from the surface towards\r\nthe centre, in descending order:--\r\n\r\n  [10] “Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Great Britain,” vol. i., p.\r\n       297.\r\n\r\nORDER OF STRATIFICATION.\r\n\r\n  Quaternary Epoch        Modern Period.\r\n\r\n                        { Pliocene Period.\r\n  Tertiary Epoch        { Miocene Period.\r\n                        { Eocene Period.\r\n\r\n                        { Cretaceous Rocks.\r\n  Secondary Epoch       { Jurassic Rocks.\r\n                        { Triassic Rocks.\r\n\r\n                        { Permian Rocks.\r\n  Primary Epoch         { Carboniferous Rocks.\r\n                        { Devonian Rocks.\r\n                        { Silurian Rocks.\r\n\r\n  Metamorphic Series    { Cambrian Rocks.\r\n                        { Fundamental Gneiss, or Laurentian.\r\n\r\nUnder these heads we propose to examine the successive transformations\r\nto which the earth has been subjected in reaching its present condition;\r\nin other words, we propose, both from an historical and descriptive\r\npoint of view, to take a survey of the several _epochs_ which can be\r\ndistinguished in the gradual formation of the earth, corresponding with\r\nthe formation of the great groups of rocks enumerated in the preceding\r\ntable. We shall describe the living creatures which have peopled the\r\nearth at each of these epochs, and which have disappeared, from causes\r\nwhich we shall also endeavour to trace. We shall describe the plants\r\nbelonging to each great phase in the history of the globe. At the same\r\ntime, we shall not pass over entirely in silence the rocks deposited by\r\nthe waters, or thrown up by eruption during these periods; we propose,\r\nalso, to give a summary of the mineralogical characters and of the\r\nfossils characteristic of, or peculiar to each formation. What we\r\npropose, in short, is to give a history of the formation of the globe,\r\nand a description of the principal rocks which actually compose it; and\r\nto take also a rapid glance at the several generations of animals and\r\nplants which have succeeded and replaced each other on the earth, from\r\nthe very beginning of organic life up to the time of man’s appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERUPTIVE ROCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing is more difficult than to write a chronological history of the\r\nrevolutions and changes to which the earth has been subjected during the\r\nages which preceded the historic times. The phenomena which have\r\nconcurred to fashion its enormous mass, and to give to it its present\r\nform and structure, are so numerous, so varied, and sometimes so nearly\r\nsimultaneous in their action, that the records defy the powers of\r\nobservation to separate them. The deposition of the sedimentary rocks\r\nhas been subject to interruption during all ages of the world. Violent\r\nigneous eruptions have penetrated the sedimentary beds, elevating them\r\nin some places, depressing them in others, and in all cases disturbing\r\ntheir order of superposition, and ejecting masses of crystalline rocks\r\nfrom the incandescent centre to the surface. Amidst these perturbations,\r\nsometimes stretching over a vast extent of country, anything like a\r\nrigorous chronological record becomes impossible, for the phenomena are\r\nso continuous and complex that it is no longer possible to distinguish\r\nthe fundamental from the accidental and secondary causes.\r\n\r\nIn order to render the subject somewhat clearer, the great facts\r\nrelative to the progressive formation of the terrestrial globe are\r\ndivided into epochs, during which the sedimentary rocks were formed in\r\ndue order in the seas of the ancient world, the mud and sand in which\r\nwere deposited day by day. Again, even where the line of demarcation is\r\nclearest between one formation and another, it must not be supposed\r\nthere is any sharply defined line of separation between them. On the\r\ncontrary, one system gradually merges into that which succeeds it. The\r\nrocks and fossils of the one gradually disappear, to be succeeded by\r\nthose of the overlying series in the regular order of succession. The\r\nnewly-made strata became the cemetery of the myriads of beings which\r\nlived and died in the bosom of the ocean. The rocks thus deposited were\r\ncalled _Neptunian_ by the older geologists.\r\n\r\nBut while the seas of each epoch were thus building up, grain by grain,\r\nand bed by bed, the new formation out of the ruins of the older, other\r\ninfluences were at work, sometimes, to all appearance, impeding\r\nsometimes advancing, the great work. The _Plutonic rocks_--the _igneous\r\nor eruptive rocks_ of modern geology, as we have seen above, were the\r\ngreat disturbing agents, and these disturbances occur in every age of\r\nthe earth’s history. We shall have occasion to speak of these eruptive\r\nformations while describing the phenomena of the several epochs. But it\r\nis thought that the narrative will be made clearer and more instructive\r\nby grouping this class of phenomena into one chapter, which we place at\r\nthe commencement, inasmuch as the constant reference to the eruptive\r\nrocks will thus be rendered more intelligible. To these are now added\r\nthe section “Metamorphic Rocks,” from the fifth edition of the French\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe rocks which issued from the centre of the earth in a state of fusion\r\nare found associated or interstratified with masses of every epoch, more\r\nespecially with those of the more ancient strata. The formations which\r\nthese rocks have originated possess great interest; first, because they\r\nenter into the composition of the terrestrial crust; secondly, because\r\nthey have impressed on its surface, in the course of their eruption,\r\nsome of the characteristics of its configuration and structure; finally,\r\nbecause, by their means, the metals which are the objects of human\r\nindustry have been brought nearer to the surface. According to the order\r\nof their appearance, or as nearly so as can be ascertained, we shall\r\nclass the eruptive rocks in two groups:--\r\n\r\nI. The _Volcanic Rocks_, of comparatively recent origin, which have\r\ngiven rise to a succession of trachytes, basalts, and modern lavas.\r\nThese, being of looser texture, are presumed to have cooled more rapidly\r\nthan the Plutonic rocks, and at or near the surface.\r\n\r\nII. The _Plutonic Rocks_, of older date, which are exemplified in the\r\nvarious kinds of granites, the syenites, the protogines, porphyries, &c.\r\nThese differ from the volcanic rocks in their more compact crystalline\r\nstructure, in the absence of tufa, as well as of pores and cavities;\r\nfrom which it is inferred that they were formed at considerable depths\r\nin the earth, and that they have cooled and crystallised slowly under\r\ngreat pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLUTONIC ERUPTIONS.\r\n\r\nThe great eruptions of _ancient granite_ are supposed to have occurred\r\nduring the primary epoch, and chiefly in the carboniferous period. They\r\npresent themselves sometimes in considerable masses, for the earth’s\r\ncrust being still thin and permeable, it was prepared as it were for\r\nabsorbing the granite masses. In consequence of its weak cohesion, the\r\nprimitive crust of the globe would be rent and penetrated in all\r\ndirections, as represented in the following section of Cape Wrath, in\r\nSutherlandshire, in which the veins of granite ramify in a very\r\nirregular manner across the gneiss and hornblende-schist, there\r\nassociated with it. (Fig. 3.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Veins of granite traversing the gneiss of Cape\r\nWrath.]\r\n\r\nGranite, when it is sound, furnishes a fine building-stone, but we must\r\nnot suppose that it deserves that character of extreme hardness with\r\nwhich the poets have gratuitously gifted it. Its granular texture\r\nrenders it unfit for road-stone, where it gets crushed too quickly to\r\ndust. With his hammer the geologist easily shapes his specimens; and in\r\nthe Russian War, at the bombardment of Bomarsund, the shot from our\r\nships demonstrated that ramparts of granite could be as easily\r\ndemolished as those constructed of limestone.\r\n\r\nThe component minerals of granite are felspar, quartz, and mica, in\r\nvarying proportions; felspar being generally the predominant ingredient,\r\nand quartz more plentiful than mica--the whole being united into a\r\nconfusedly granular or crystalline mass. Occasionally it passes\r\ninsensibly from fine to coarse-grained granite, and the finer grained is\r\neven sometimes found embedded in the more coarsely granular variety:\r\nsometimes it assumes a porphyritic texture. Porphyritic granite is a\r\nvariety of granite, the components of which--quartz, felspar, and\r\nmica--are set in a non-crystallised paste, uniting the mass in a manner\r\nwhich will be familiar to many of our readers who may have seen the\r\ngranite of the Land’s End, in Cornwall. Alongside these orthoclase\r\ncrystals, quartz is implanted, usually in grains of irregular shape,\r\nmore rarely crystallised, and seldom in the form of perfect crystals. To\r\nthese ingredients are added thin scales or small hexagonal plates and\r\ncrystals of white, brown, black, or greenish-coloured mica. Finally, the\r\nname of _quartziferous porphyry_ is reserved for those varieties which\r\npresent crystals of quartz; the other varieties are simply called\r\n_porphyritic granite_. _True_ porphyry presents a paste essentially\r\ncomposed of compact felspar, in which the crystals of orthoclase--that\r\nis, felspar with a potash base--are abundantly disseminated, and\r\nsometimes with great regularity.\r\n\r\nGranite is supposed to have been “formed at considerable depths in the\r\nearth, where it has cooled and crystallised slowly under great pressure,\r\nwhere the contained gases could not expand.”[11] “The influence,” says\r\nLyell, “of subterranean heat may extend downwards from the crater of\r\nevery active volcano to a great depth below, perhaps several miles or\r\nleagues, and the effects which are produced deep in the bowels of the\r\nearth may, or rather must, be distinct; so that volcanic and plutonic\r\nrocks, each different in texture, and sometimes even in composition, may\r\noriginate simultaneously, the one at the surface, the other far beneath\r\nit.” Other views, however, of its origin are not unknown to science:\r\nProfessor Ramsay and some other geologists consider granite to be\r\nmetamorphic. “For my own part,” says the Professor, “I believe that in\r\none sense it is an igneous rock; that is to say, that it has been\r\ncompletely fused. But in another sense it is a metamorphic rock, partly\r\nbecause it is impossible in many cases to draw any definite line between\r\ngneiss and granite, for they pass into each other by insensible\r\ngradations; and granite frequently _occupies the space that ought to be\r\nfilled with gneiss_, were it not that the gneiss has been entirely\r\nfused. I believe therefore that granite and its allies are simply the\r\neffect of the extreme of metamorphism, brought about by great heat with\r\npresence of water. In other words, when the metamorphism has been so\r\ngreat that all traces of the semi-crystalline laminated structure have\r\ndisappeared, a more perfect crystallisation has taken place.”[12] It is\r\nobvious that the very result on which the Professor founds his theory,\r\nnamely, the difficulty “in many cases,” of drawing a line between the\r\ngranite and the gneiss, would be produced by the sudden injection of the\r\nfluid minerals into gneiss, composed of the same materials. Moreover, it\r\nis only in some cases that the difficulty exists; in many others the\r\nline of separation is definable enough.[13]\r\n\r\n  [11] Lyell’s “Elements of Geology,” p. 694.\r\n\r\n  [12] “Physical Geology and Geography of Great Britain,” by A. C.\r\n       Ramsay, p. 38, 2nd ed.\r\n\r\n  [13] At the same time it may be safely assumed (as Professor Ramsay\r\n       believes to be the case) that granite in most cases is a\r\n       metamorphic rock; yet are there many instances in which it may\r\n       with greater truth be considered as a true plutonic rock.\r\n\r\nThe granitic rock called _Syenite_, in which a part of the mica is\r\nreplaced by hornblende or amphibole, has to all appearance been erupted\r\nto the surface subsequently to the granite, and very often alongside of\r\nit. Thus the two extremities of the Vosges, towards Belfort and\r\nStrasburg, are eminently syenitic, while the intermediate part, towards\r\nColmar, is as markedly granitic. In the Lyonnais, the southern region is\r\ngranitic; the northern region, from Arbresle, is in great part syenitic.\r\nSyenite also makes its appearance in the Limousin.\r\n\r\nSyenite, into which rose-coloured felspar often enters, forms a\r\nbeautiful rock, because the green or nearly black hornblende heightens,\r\nby contrast, the effect of its colour. This rock is a valuable adjunct\r\nfor architectural ornament; it is that out of which the ancient\r\nEgyptians shaped many of their monumental columns, sphinxes, and\r\nsarcophagi; the most perfect type of it is found in Egypt, not far from\r\nthe city of Syene, from which it derives its name. The obelisk of Luxor\r\nnow in Paris, several of the Egyptian obelisks in Rome, and the\r\ncelebrated sphinxes, of which copies may be seen in front of the\r\nEgyptian Court at the Crystal Palace, the pedestal of the statue of\r\nPeter the Great at St. Petersburg, and the facing of the sub-basement of\r\nthe column in the Place Vendôme in Paris, are of this stone, of which\r\nthere are quarries in the neighbourhood of Plancher-les-Mines in the\r\nVosges.\r\n\r\nSyenite disintegrates more readily than granite, and it contains\r\nindurated nodular concretions, which often remain in the form of large\r\nspherical balls, in the midst of the débris resulting from\r\ndisintegration of the mass. It remains to be added that syenitic masses\r\nare often very variable as regards their composition; the hornblende is\r\nsometimes wanting, in which case we can only recognise an ancient\r\ngranite. In other instances the hornblende predominates to such a\r\ndegree, that a large or small-grained _diorite_, or greenstone, results.\r\nThe geologist should be prepared to observe these transitions, which are\r\napt to lead him into error if passed over without being noticed.\r\n\r\n_Protogine_ is a talcose granite, composed of felspar, quartz, and talc\r\nor _chlorite_, or decomposed mica, which take the place of the usual\r\nmica. Excessively variable in its texture, protogine passes from the\r\nmost perfect granitic aspect to that of a porphyry, in such a manner as\r\nto present continual subjects of uncertainty, rendering it very\r\ndifficult to determine its geological age. Nevertheless, it is supposed\r\nto have come to the surface before and during the coal-period; in short,\r\nat Creusot, protogine covers the coal-fields so completely, that it is\r\nnecessary to sink the pits through the protogine, in order to penetrate\r\nto the coal, and the rock has so manifestly acted on the coal-measure\r\nstrata, as to have contorted and metamorphosed them. Something analogous\r\nto this manifests itself near Mont Blanc, where the colossal mass which\r\npredominates in that chain, and the peaks which belong to it, consist of\r\nprotogine. But as no such action can be perceived in the overlying rocks\r\nof the Triassic period, it may be assumed that at the time of the\r\ndeposition of the New Red Sandstone the protoginous eruptions had\r\nceased.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to add, however, that if the protogine rises in such\r\nbold pinnacles round Mont Blanc, the circumstance only applies to the\r\nmore elevated parts of the mountain, and is influenced by the excessive\r\nrigour of the seasons, which demolishes and continually wears away all\r\nthe parts of the rock which have been decomposed by atmospheric agency.\r\nWhere protogine occurs in milder climates--around Creusot, and at\r\nPierre-sur-Autre, in the Forez chain, for instance--the mountains show\r\nnone of the scarped and bristling peaks exhibited in the chain of Mont\r\nBlanc. Only single isolated masses occasionally form _rocking-stones_,\r\nso called because, resting with a convex base upon a pedestal also\r\nconvex, but in a contrary way, it is easy to move these naturally\r\nbalanced blocks, although from their vast size it would require very\r\nconsiderable force to displace them. This tendency to fashion themselves\r\ninto rounded or ellipsoidal forms belongs, also, to other granitic\r\nrocks, and even to some of the variegated sandstones. The rocking-stones\r\nhave often given rise to legends and popular myths.\r\n\r\nThe great eruptions of granite, protogine, and porphyry took place,\r\naccording to M. Fournet, during the carboniferous period, for\r\nporphyritic pebbles are found in the conglomerates of the Coal-measure\r\nperiod. “The granite of Dartmoor, in Devonshire,” says Lyell,[14] “was\r\nformerly supposed to be one of the most ancient of the plutonic rocks,\r\nbut it is now ascertained to be posterior in date to the culm-measures\r\nof that county, which from their position, and as containing true\r\ncoal-plants, are regarded by Professor Sedgwick and Sir R. Murchison as\r\nmembers of the true Carboniferous series. This granite, like the\r\nsyenitic granite of Christiana, has broken through the stratified\r\nformations without much changing their strike. Hence, on the north-west\r\nside of Dartmoor, the successive members of the Culm-measures abut\r\nagainst the granite, and become metamorphic as they approach. The\r\ngranite of Cornwall is probably of the same date, and therefore as\r\nmodern as the Carboniferous strata, if not newer.”\r\n\r\n  [14] “Elements of Geology,” p. 716, 6th edition.\r\n\r\nThe _ancient granites_ show themselves in France in the Vosges, in\r\nAuvergne, at Espinouse in Languedoc, at Plan-de-la-Tour in Provence, in\r\nthe chain of the Cévennes, at Mont Pilat near Lyons, and in the southern\r\npart of the Lyonnaise chain. They rarely impart boldness or grandeur to\r\nthe landscape, as might be expected from their crystallised texture and\r\nhardness; for having been exposed to the effects of atmospheric changes\r\nfrom the earliest times of the earth’s consolidation, the rocks have\r\nbecome greatly worn away and rounded in the outlines of their masses. It\r\nis only when recent dislocations have broken them up that they assume a\r\npicturesque character.\r\n\r\nThe Christiania granite alluded to above was at one time thought to have\r\nbelonged to the Silurian period. But, in 1813, Von Buch announced that\r\nthe strata in question consisted of limestones containing orthoceratites\r\nand trilobites; the shales and limestone being only penetrated by\r\ngranite-veins, and altered for a considerable distance from the point of\r\ncontact.[15] The same granite is found to penetrate the ancient gneiss\r\nof the country on which the fossiliferous beds rest--unconformably, as\r\nthe geologists say; that is, they rest on the edges of the gneiss, from\r\nwhich other stratified deposits had been washed away, leaving the gneiss\r\ndenuded before the sedimentary beds were deposited. “Between the origin,\r\ntherefore, of the gneiss and the granite,”[16] says Lyell, “there\r\nintervened, first, the period when the strata of gneiss were denuded;\r\nsecondly, the period of the deposition of the Silurian deposits. Yet\r\nthe granite produced after this long interval is often so intimately\r\nblended with the ancient gneiss at the point of the junction, that it is\r\nimpossible to draw any other than an arbitrary line of separation\r\nbetween them; and where this is not the case, tortuous veins of granite\r\npass freely through gneiss, ending sometimes in threads, as if the older\r\nrock had offered no resistance to their passage.” From this example Sir\r\nCharles concludes that it is impossible to conjecture whether certain\r\ngranites, which send veins into gneiss and other metamorphic rocks, have\r\nbeen so injected while the gneiss was scarcely solidified, or at some\r\ntime during the Secondary or Tertiary period. As it is, no single mass\r\nof granite can be pointed out more ancient than the oldest known\r\nfossiliferous deposits; no Lower Cambrian stratum is known to rest\r\nimmediately on granite; no pebbles of granite are found in the\r\nconglomerates of the Lower Cambrian. On the contrary, granite is usually\r\nfound, as in the case of Dartmoor, in immediate contact with primary\r\nformations, with every sign of elevation subsequent to their deposition.\r\nPorphyritic pebbles are found in the Coal-measures; porpyhries continue\r\nduring the Triassic period; since, in some parts of Germany, veins of\r\nporphyry are found traversing the New Red Sandstone, or _grès bigarré_\r\nof French geologists. Syenites have especially reacted upon the Silurian\r\ndeposits and other old sedimentary rocks, up to those of the Lower\r\nCarboniferous period.\r\n\r\n  [15] “Elements of Geology,” p. 717.\r\n\r\n  [16] Ibid, p. 718.\r\n\r\nThe term porphyry is usually applied to a rock with a paste or base of\r\ncompact felspar, in which felspathic crystals of various sizes assume\r\ntheir natural form. The variety of their mineralogical characters, the\r\nadmirable polish which can be given to them, and which renders them\r\neminently useful for ornamentation, give to the porphyries an artistic\r\nand industrial importance, which would be greatly enhanced if the\r\ndifficulty of working such a hard material did not render the price so\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\nThe porphyries possess various degrees of hardness and compactness. When\r\na fine dark-red colour--which contrasts well with the white of the\r\nfelspar--is combined with hardness, a magnificent stone is the result,\r\nsusceptible of taking a polish, and fit for any kind of ornamental work;\r\nfor the decoration of buildings, for the construction of vases, columns,\r\n&c. The red Egyptian porphyry, called _Rosso antico_, was particularly\r\nsought after by the ancients, who made sepulchres, baths, and obelisks\r\nof it. The grandest known mass of this kind of porphyry is the Obelisk\r\nof Sextus V. at Rome. In the Museum of the Louvre, in Paris, some\r\nmagnificent basins and statues, made of the same stone, may also be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nIn spite of its compact texture porphyry disintegrates, like other\r\nrocks, when exposed to air and water. One of the sphinxes transported\r\nfrom Egypt to Paris, being accidentally placed under a gutter of the\r\nLouvre, soon began to exhibit signs of exfoliation, notwithstanding it\r\nhad remained sound for ages under the climate of Egypt. In this country,\r\nand even in France, where the climate is much drier, the porphyries\r\nfrequently decompose so as to become scarcely recognisable. They crop\r\nout in various parts of France, but are only abundant in the\r\nnorth-eastern part of the central plateau, and in some parts of the\r\nsouth. They form mountains of a conical form, presenting, nearly always,\r\nconsiderable depressions on their flanks. In the Vosges they attain a\r\nheight of from three to four thousand feet.\r\n\r\nThe _Serpentine_ rocks are a sort of compact _talc_, which owe their\r\nsoapy texture and greasy feel to silicate of magnesia. Their softness\r\npermits of their being turned in a lathe and fashioned into vessels of\r\nvarious forms. Even stoves are constructed of this substance, which\r\nbears heat well. The serpentine quarried on the banks of Lake Como,\r\nwhich bears the name of pierre ollaire, or pot-stone, is excellently\r\nadapted for this purpose. Serpentine shows itself in the Vosges, in the\r\nLimousin, in the Lyonnais, and in the Var; it occupies an immense tract\r\nin the Alps, as well as in the Apennines. Mona marble is an example of\r\nserpentine; and the Lizard Point, Cornwall, is a mass of it. A portion\r\nof the stratified rocks of Tuscany, and also those of the Island of\r\nElba, have been upheaved and overturned by eruptions of it.\r\n\r\nAs for the British Islands, plutonic rocks are extensively developed in\r\nScotland, where the Cambrian and Silurian rocks, often of gneissic\r\ncharacter--associated here and there with great bosses of granite and\r\nsyenite--form by far the greater part of the region known as the\r\nHighlands. In the Isle of Arran a circular mass of coarse-grained\r\ngranite protrudes through the schists of the northern part of the\r\nisland; while, in the southern part, a finer-grained granite and veins\r\nof porphyry and coarse-grained granite have broken through the\r\nstratified rocks.[17] In Devonshire and Cornwall there are four great\r\nbosses of granite; in the southern parts of Cornwall the mineral axis is\r\ndefined by a line drawn through the centre of the several bosses from\r\nsouth-west to north-east; but in the north of Cornwall, and extending\r\ninto Devonshire, it strikes nearly east and west. The great granite\r\nmass in Cornwall lies on the moors north of St. Austell, and indicates\r\nthe existence of more than one disturbing force. “There was an elevating\r\nforce,” says Professor Sedgwick,[18] “protruding from the St. Austell\r\ngranite; and, if I interpret the phenomena correctly, there was a\r\ncontemporaneous elevating force acting from the south; and between these\r\ntwo forces, the beds, now spread over the surface from the St. Austell\r\ngranite to the Dodman and Narehead, were broken, contorted, and placed\r\nin their present disturbed position. Some great disturbing forces,” he\r\nobserves, “have modified the symmetry of this part of Cornwall,\r\naffecting,” he believes, “the whole transverse section of the country\r\nfrom the headlands near Fowey to those south of Padstow.” This great\r\ngranite-axis was upheaved in a line commencing at the west end of\r\nCornwall, rising through the slate-rocks of the older Devonian group,\r\ncontinuing in association with them as far as the boss north of St.\r\nAustell, producing much confusion in the stratified masses; the\r\ngranite-mass between St. Clear and Camelford rose between the deposition\r\nof the Petherwin and that of the Plymouth group; lastly, the Dartmoor\r\ngranite rose, partially moving the adjacent slates in such a manner that\r\nits north end abuts against and tilts up the base of the Culm-trough,\r\nmineralising the great Culm-limestone, while on the south it does the\r\nsame to the base of the Plymouth slates. These facts prove that the\r\ngranite of Dartmoor, which was formerly thought to be the most ancient\r\nof the Plutonic rocks, is of a date subsequent to the Culm-measures of\r\nDevonshire, which are now regarded as forming part of the true\r\ncarboniferous series.\r\n\r\n  [17] “Geology of the Island of Arran,” by Andrew C. Ramsay. “Geology\r\n       of Arran and Clydesdale,” by James Bryce.\r\n\r\n  [18] See _Quarterly Journal of Geological Society_, vol. viii., pp. 9\r\n       and 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLCANIC ROCKS.\r\n\r\nConsidered as a whole, the volcanic rocks may be grouped into three\r\ndistinct formations, which we shall notice in the following order, which\r\nis that of their relative antiquity, namely:--1. _Trachytic_; 2.\r\n_Basaltic_; 3. _Volcanic or Lava formations_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--A peak of the Cantal chain.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRACHYTIC FORMATIONS.\r\n\r\n_Trachyte_ (derived from τραχυς, rough), having a coarse, cellular\r\nappearance, and a rough and gritty feel, belongs to the class of\r\nvolcanic rocks. The eruptions of trachyte seem to have commenced towards\r\nthe middle of the Tertiary period, and to have continued up to its\r\nclose. The trachytes present considerable analogy in their composition\r\nto the felspathic porphyries, but their mineralogical characters are\r\ndifferent. Their texture is porous; they form a white, grey, black,\r\nsometimes yellowish matrix, in which, as a rule, felspar predominates,\r\ntogether with disseminated crystals of felspar, some hornblende or\r\naugite, and dark-coloured mica. In its external appearance trachyte is\r\nvery variable. It forms the three most elevated mountain ranges of\r\nCentral France; the groups of Cantal and Mont Dore, and the chain of the\r\nVelay (Puy-de-Dôme).[19]\r\n\r\n  [19] For full information in reference to the rocks and geology of\r\n       this part of France, the reader is referred to the masterly work\r\n       on “The Geology and Extinct Volcanoes of Central France,” by G.\r\n       Poulett Scrope, 2nd edition, 1858.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I.--Peak of Sancy in the Mont Dore group, Auvergne.]\r\n\r\nThe igneous group of Cantal may be described as a series of lofty\r\nsummits, ranged around a large cavity, which was at one period probably\r\na volcanic crater, the circular base of which occupies an area of nearly\r\nfifteen leagues in diameter. The strictly trachytic portion of the group\r\nrises in the centre, and is composed of high mountains, throwing off\r\nspurs, which gradually decrease in height, and terminate in plateaux\r\nmore or less inclined. These central mountains attain a height varying\r\nbetween 4,500 and 5,500 feet above the level of the sea. A scaly or\r\nschistose variety of trachyte, called _phonolite_, or clinkstone (from\r\nthe ringing metallic sound it emits when struck with the hammer), with\r\nan unusual proportion of felspar, or, according to Gmelin, composed of\r\nfelspar and zeolite, forms the steep trachytic escarpments at the\r\ncentre, which enclose the principal valleys; their abrupt peaks giving a\r\nremarkably picturesque appearance to the landscape. In the engraving on\r\np. 40 (Fig. 4) the slaty, laminated character of the clinkstone is well\r\nrepresented in one of the phonolitic peaks of the Cantal group. The\r\ngroup at Mont Dore consists of seven or eight rocky summits, occupying a\r\ncircuit of about five leagues in diameter. The massive trachytic rock,\r\nof which this mountainous mass is chiefly formed, has an average\r\nthickness of 1,200 to 2,600 feet; comprehending over that range\r\nprodigious layers of scoriæ, pumiceous conglomerates, and detritus,\r\ninterstratified with beds of trachyte and basalt, bearing the signs of\r\nan igneous origin, tufa forming the base; and between them occur layers\r\nof lignite, or imperfectly mineralised woody fibre, the whole being\r\nsuperimposed on a primitive plateau of about 3,250 feet in height.\r\nScored and furrowed out by deep valleys, the viscous mass was gradually\r\nupheaved, until in the needle-like Pic de Sancy (PLATE I.), a pyramidal\r\nrock of porphyritic trachyte, which is the loftiest point of Mont Dore,\r\nit attains the height of 6,258 feet. The Pic de Sancy, represented on\r\npage 40 (Fig. 4), gives an excellent idea of the general appearance of\r\nthe trachytic mountains of Mont Dore.\r\n\r\nUpon the same plateau with Mont Dore, and about seven miles north of its\r\nlast slopes, the trachytic formation is repeated in four rounded\r\ndomes--those of Puy-de-Dôme, Sarcouï, Clierzou, and Le Grand Suchet. The\r\nPuy-de-Dôme, one of the most remarkable volcanic domes in Auvergne,\r\npresents another fine and very striking example of an eruptive trachytic\r\nrock. The rock here assumes a peculiar mineral character, which has\r\ncaused the name of _domite_ to be given to it.\r\n\r\nThe chain of the Velay forms a zone, composed of independent plateaux\r\nand peaks, which forms upon the horizon a long and strangely\r\nintersected ridge. The bareness of the mountains, their forms--pointed\r\nor rounded, sometimes terminating in scarped plateaux--give to the whole\r\nlandscape an appearance at once picturesque and characteristic. The peak\r\nof Le Mezen, which rises 5,820 feet above the sea, forms the culminating\r\npoint of the chain. The phonolites of which it consists have been\r\nerupted from fissures which present themselves at a great number of\r\npoints, ranging from north-north-west to south-south-east.\r\n\r\nOn the banks of the Rhine and in Hungary the trachytic formation\r\npresents itself in features identical with those which indicate it in\r\nFrance. In America it is principally represented by some immense cones,\r\nsuperposed in the chain of the Andes; the colossal Chimborazo being one\r\nof those trachytic cones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: II.--Mountain and basaltic crater of La Coupe d’Ayzac, in\r\nthe Vivarais.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Theoretical view of a basaltic plateau.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Basalt in prismatic columns.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBASALTIC FORMATIONS.\r\n\r\nBasaltic eruptions seem to have occurred during the Secondary and\r\nTertiary periods. Basalt, according to Dr. Daubeny,[20] in its more\r\nstrict sense, “is composed of an intimate mixture of augite with a\r\nzeolitic mineral, which appears to have been formed out of labradorite\r\n(felspar of Labrador), by the addition of water--the presence of water\r\nbeing in all _zeolites_ the cause of that bubbling-up under the\r\nblow-pipe to which they owe their appellation.” M. Delesse and other\r\nmineralogists are of opinion that the idea of augite being the\r\nprevailing mineral in basalt, must be abandoned; and that although its\r\npresence gives the rock its distinctive character, as compared with\r\ntrachytic and most other trap rocks, still the principal element in\r\ntheir composition is felspar. Basalt, a lava consisting essentially of\r\naugite, labradorite (or nepheline) and magnetic iron-ore is the rock\r\nwhich predominates in this formation. It contains a smaller quantity of\r\nsilica than the trachyte, and a larger proportion of lime and magnesia.\r\nHence, independent of the iron in its composition, it is heavier in\r\nproportion, as it contains more or less silica. Some varieties of basalt\r\ncontain very large quantities of olivine, a mineral of an olive-green\r\ncolour, with a chemical composition differing but slightly from\r\nserpentine. Both basalts and trachyte contain more soda and less silica\r\nin their composition than granites; some of the basalts are highly\r\nfusible, the alkaline matter and lime in their composition acting as a\r\nflux to the silica. There are examples of basalt existing in\r\nwell-defined flows, which still adhere to craters visible at the present\r\nday, and with regard to the igneous origin of which there can be no\r\ndoubt. One of the most striking examples of a basaltic cone is furnished\r\nby the mountain or crater of La Coupe d’Ayzac, in the Vivarais, in the\r\nsouth of France. PLATE II., on the opposite page, gives an accurate\r\nrepresentation of this curious basaltic flow. The remnants of the stream\r\nof liquefied basalt which once flowed down the flank of the hill may\r\nstill be seen adhering in vast masses to the granite rocks on both sides\r\nof a narrow valley where the river Volant has cut across the lava and\r\nleft a pavement or causeway, forming an assemblage of upright prismatic\r\ncolumns, fitted together with geometrical symmetry; the whole resting on\r\na base of gneiss. Basaltic eruptions sometimes form a plateau, as\r\nrepresented in Fig. 5, where the process of formation is shown\r\ntheoretically and in a manner which renders further explanation\r\nunnecessary. Many of these basaltic table-lands form plateaux of very\r\nconsiderable extent and thickness; others form fragments of the same,\r\nmore or less dislocated; others, again, present themselves in isolated\r\nknolls, far removed from similar formations. In short, basaltic rocks\r\npresent themselves in veins or dykes, more or less, in most countries,\r\nof which Central France and the banks of the Rhine offer many striking\r\nexamples. These veins present very evident proofs that the matter has\r\nbeen introduced from below, and in a manner which could only result from\r\ninjection from the interior to the exterior of the earth. Such are the\r\nproofs presented by the basaltic veins of Villeneuve-de-Berg, which\r\nterminate in slender filaments, sometimes bifurcated, which gradually\r\nlose themselves in the rock which they traverse. In several parts of the\r\nnorth of Ireland, chalk-formations with flints are traversed by basaltic\r\ndykes, the chalk being converted into granular marble near the basalt,\r\nthe change sometimes extending eight or ten feet from the wall of the\r\ndyke, and being greatest near the surface of contact. In the Island of\r\nRathlin, the walls of basalt traverse the chalk in three veins or dykes;\r\nthe central one a foot thick, that on the right twenty feet, and on the\r\nleft thirty-three feet thick, and all, according to Buckland and\r\nConybeare, within the breadth of ninety feet.\r\n\r\n  [20] “Volcanoes,” 2nd ed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Basaltic Causeway, on the banks of the river\r\nVolant, in the Ardèche.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking characteristics of basalt is the prismatic and\r\ncolumnar structure which it often assumes; the lava being homogeneous\r\nand of very fine grain, the laws which determine the direction of the\r\nfissures or divisional planes consolidated from a molten to a solid\r\nstate, become here very manifest--these are always at right angles to\r\nthe surfaces of the rock through which the heat of the fused mass\r\nescaped. The basaltic rocks have been at all times remarkable for this\r\npicturesque arrangement of their parts. They usually present columns of\r\nregular prisms, having generally six, often five, and sometimes four,\r\nseven, or even three sides, whose disposition is always perpendicular to\r\nthe cooling surfaces. These are often divided transversely, as in Fig.\r\n6, at nearly equal distances, like the joints of a wall, composed of\r\nregularly arranged, equal-sided pieces adhering together, and frequently\r\nextending over a more or less considerable space. The name of Giant’s\r\nCauseway has been given, from time immemorial, to these curious columnar\r\nstructures of basalt. In France, in the Vivarais and in the Velay, there\r\nare many such basaltic causeways. That of which Fig. 7 is a sketch lies\r\non the banks of the river Volant, where it flows into the Ardèche.\r\nIreland has always been celebrated for its Giant’s Causeway, which\r\nextends over the whole of the northern part of Antrim, covering all the\r\npre-existing strata of Chalk, Greensand, and Permian formations; the\r\nprismatic columns extend for miles along the cliffs, projecting into the\r\nsea at the point specially designated the Giant’s Causeway.\r\n\r\nThese columnar formations vary considerably in length and diameter.\r\nMcCulloch mentions some in Skye, which “are about four hundred feet\r\nhigh; others in Morven not exceeding an inch (vol. ii. p. 137). In\r\ndiameter those of Ailsa Craig measure nine feet, and those of Morven an\r\ninch or less.” Fingal’s Cave, in the Isle of Staffa, is renowned among\r\nbasaltic rocks, although it was scarcely known on the mainland a century\r\nago, when Sir Joseph Banks heard of it accidentally, and was the first\r\nto visit and describe it. Fingal’s Cave has been hollowed out, by the\r\nsea, through a gallery of immense prismatic columns of trap, which are\r\ncontinually beaten by the waves. The columns are usually upright, but\r\nsometimes they are curved and slightly inclined. Fig. 8 is a view of the\r\nbasaltic grotto of Staffa.\r\n\r\nGrottoes are sometimes formed by basaltic eruptions on land, followed by\r\ntheir separation into regular columns. The Grotto of Cheeses, at\r\nBertrich-Baden, between Trèves and Coblentz, is a remarkable example of\r\nthis kind, being so called because its columns are formed of round, and\r\nusually flattened, stones placed one above the other in such a manner as\r\nto resemble a pile of cheeses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Basaltic cavern of Staffa--exterior.]\r\n\r\nIf we consider that in basalt-flows the lower part is compact, and often\r\ndivided into prismatic columns, while the upper part is porous,\r\ncellular, scoriaceous, and irregularly divided--that the points of\r\nseparation on which they rest are small beds presenting fragments of the\r\nporous stony concretions known under the name of _Lapilli_--that the\r\nlower portions of these masses present a multitude of points which\r\npenetrate the rocks on which they repose, thereby denoting that some\r\nfluid matter had moulded itself into its crevices--that the neighbouring\r\nrocks are often calcined to a considerable thickness, and the included\r\nvegetable remains carbonised--no doubt can exist as to the igneous\r\norigin of basaltic rocks. When it reached the surface through certain\r\nopenings, the fluid basalt spread itself, flowing, as it were, over the\r\nhorizontal surface of the ground; for if it had flowed upon inclined\r\nsurfaces it could not have preserved the uniform surface and constant\r\nthickness which it generally exhibits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: III.--Extinct volcanoes forming the Puy-de-Dôme Chain.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLCANIC OR LAVA FORMATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe _lava_ formations comprehend both extinct and active volcanoes. “The\r\nterm,” says Lyell, “has a somewhat vague signification, having been\r\napplied to all melted matter observed to flow in streams from volcanic\r\nvents. When this matter consolidates in the open air, the upper part is\r\nusually scoriaceous, and the mass becomes more and more stony as we\r\ndescend, or in proportion as it has consolidated more slowly and under\r\ngreater pressure.”[21]\r\n\r\n  [21] “Elements of Geology,” p. 596.\r\n\r\nThe formation of extinct volcanoes is represented in France by the\r\nvolcanoes situated in the ancient provinces of Auvergne, Velay, and the\r\nVivarais, but principally by nearly seventy volcanic cones of various\r\nsizes and of the height of from 500 to 1,000 feet, composed of loose\r\nscoriæ, lava, and pozzuolana, arranged upon a granitic table-land, about\r\ntwelve miles wide, which overlooks the town of Clermont-Ferrand, and\r\nwhich seem to have been produced along a longitudinal fracture in the\r\nearth’s crust, running in a direction from north to south. It is a range\r\nof volcanic hills, the “chain of _Puys_” nearly twenty miles in length,\r\nby two in breadth. By its cellular and porous structure, which is also\r\ngranular and crystalline, the felspathic or pyroxenic lava which flowed\r\nfrom these volcanoes is readily distinguishable from the analogous lavas\r\nwhich belong to the basaltic or trachytic formations. Their surface is\r\nirregular, and bristles with asperities, formed by heaped-up angular\r\nblocks.\r\n\r\nThe volcanoes of the chain of _Puys_, represented on opposite page (PL.\r\nIII.) are so perfectly preserved, their lava is so frequently superposed\r\non sheets of basalt, and presents a composition and texture so distinct,\r\nthat there is no difficulty in establishing the fact that they are\r\nposterior to the basaltic formation, and of very recent age.\r\nNevertheless, they do not appear to belong to the historic ages, for no\r\ntradition attests their eruption. Lyell places these eruptions in the\r\nLower Miocene period, and their greatest activity in the Upper Miocene\r\nand Pliocene eras. “Extinct quadrupeds of those eras,” he says,\r\n“belonging to the genera mastodon, rhinoceros, and others, were buried\r\nin ashes and beds of alluvial sand and gravel, which owe their\r\npreservation to overspreading sheets of lava.”[22]\r\n\r\n  [22] Ibid, p. 677.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Section of a volcano in action.]\r\n\r\nAll volcanic phenomena can be explained by the theory we have already\r\nindicated, of fractures in the solid crust of the globe resulting from\r\nits cooling. The various phenomena which existing volcanoes present to\r\nus are, as Humboldt has said, “the result of every action exercised by\r\nthe interior of a planet on its external crust.”[23] We designate as\r\nvolcanoes all conduits which establish a permanent communication between\r\nthe interior of the earth and its surface--a conduit which gives passage\r\nat intervals to eruptions of _lava_, and in Fig. 9 we have represented,\r\nin an ideal section, the geological mode of action of volcanic\r\neruptions. The volcanoes on the surface of the globe, known to be in an\r\noccasional state of activity, number about three hundred, and these may\r\nbe divided into two classes: the _isolated_ or _central_, and the\r\n_linear_ or those volcanoes which belong to a _series_.[24]\r\n\r\n  [23] “Cosmos,” vol. i., p. 25. Bohn.\r\n\r\n  [24] “Cosmos,” vol. i., p. 237.\r\n\r\nThe first are active volcanoes, around which there may be established\r\nmany secondary active mouths of eruption, always in connection with some\r\nprincipal crater. The second are disposed like the chimneys of furnaces,\r\nalong fissures extending over considerable distances. Twenty, thirty,\r\nand even a greater number of volcanic cones may rise above one such rent\r\nin the earth’s crust, the direction of which will be indicated by their\r\nlinear course. The Peak of Teneriffe is an instance of a central\r\nvolcano; the long rampart-like chain of the Andes, presents, from the\r\nsouth of Chili to the north-west coast of America, one of the grandest\r\ninstances of a continental volcanic chain; the remarkable range of\r\nvolcanoes in the province of Quito belong to the latter class. Darwin\r\nrelates that on the 19th of March, 1835, the attention of a sentry was\r\ncalled to something like a large star which gradually increased in size\r\ntill about three o’clock, when it presented a very magnificent\r\nspectacle. “By the aid of a glass, dark objects, in constant succession,\r\nwere seen in the midst of a great glare of red light, to be thrown up\r\nand to fall down. The light was sufficient to cast on the water a long\r\nbright reflection--it was the volcano of Osorno in action.” Mr. Darwin\r\nwas afterwards assured that Aconcagua, in Chili, 480 miles to the north,\r\nwas in action on the same night, and that the great eruption of\r\nCoseguina (2,700 miles north of Aconcagua), accompanied by an earthquake\r\nfelt over 1,000 miles, also occurred within six hours of this same time;\r\nand yet Coseguina had been dormant for six-and-twenty years, and\r\nAconcagua most rarely shows any signs of action.[25] It is also stated\r\nby Professor Dove that in the year 1835 the ashes discharged from the\r\nmountain of Coseguina were carried 700 miles, and that the roaring noise\r\nof the eruption was heard at San Salvador, a distance of 1,000 miles.\r\n\r\n  [25] Darwin’s “Journal,” p. 291, 2nd edition.\r\n\r\nIn the sea the _series_ of volcanoes show themselves in groups of\r\nislands disposed in longitudinal series.\r\n\r\nAmong these may be ranged the volcanic series of Sunda, which, according\r\nto the accounts of the matter ejected and the violence of the eruptions,\r\nseem to be among the most remarkable on the globe; the series of the\r\nMoluccas and of the Philippines; those of Japan; of the Marianne\r\nIslands; of Chili; of the double series of volcanic summits near Quito,\r\nthose of the Antilles, Guatemala, and Mexico.\r\n\r\nAmong the central, or isolated volcanoes, we may class those of the\r\nLipari Islands, which have _Stromboli_, in permanent activity, for\r\ntheir centre; _Etna_, _Vesuvius_, the volcanoes of the _Azores_, of the\r\n_Canaries_, of the _Cape de Verde_, of the _Galapagos_ Islands, the\r\n_Sandwich_ Islands, the _Marquesas_, the _Society_ Islands, the\r\n_Friendly_ Islands, _Bourbon_, and, finally, _Ararat_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Existing crater of Vesuvius.]\r\n\r\nThe mouths of volcanic chimneys are, almost always, situated near the\r\nsummit of a more or less isolated conical mountain; they usually consist\r\nof an opening in the form of a funnel, which is called the _crater_, and\r\nwhich descends into the interior of the volcanic chimney. But in the\r\ncourse of ages the crater becomes extended and enlarged, until, in some\r\nof the older volcanoes, it has attained almost incredible dimensions. In\r\n1822 the crater of Vesuvius was 2,000 feet deep, and of a very\r\nconsiderable circumference. The crater of Kilauea, in the Sandwich\r\nIslands group, is an immense chasm 1,000 feet deep, with an outer\r\ncircle no less than from two to three miles in diameter, in which lava\r\nis usually seen, Mr. Dana tells us, to boil up at the bottom of a lake,\r\nthe level of which varies continually according to the active or\r\nquiescent state of the volcano. The cone which supports these craters,\r\nand which is designated the _cone of ejection_, is composed for the most\r\npart of lava or _scoriæ_, the products of eruption. Many volcanoes\r\nconsist only of a _cone of scoriæ_. Such is that of Barren Isle, in the\r\nBay of Bengal. Others, on the contrary, present a very small cone,\r\nnotwithstanding the considerable height of the volcanic chain. As an\r\nexample we may mention the new crater of Vesuvius, which was produced in\r\n1829 within the former crater (Fig. 10).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--Fissures near Locarno.]\r\n\r\nThe frequency and intensity of the eruptions bear no relation to the\r\ndimensions of the volcanic mountain. The eruption of a volcano is\r\nusually announced by a subterranean noise, accompanied by shocks,\r\nquivering of the ground, and sometimes by actual earthquakes. The noise,\r\nwhich usually proceeds from a great depth, makes itself heard, sometimes\r\nover a great extent of country, and resembles a well-sustained fire of\r\nartillery, accompanied by the rattle of musketry. Sometimes it is like\r\nthe heavy rolling of subterranean thunder. Fissures are frequently\r\nproduced during the eruptions, extending over a considerable radius, as\r\nrepresented in the woodcut on page 57 of the fissures of Locarno (Fig.\r\n11), where they present a singular appearance; the clefts radiating from\r\na centre in all directions, not unlike the starred fracture in a cracked\r\npane of glass. The eruption begins with a strong shock, which shakes the\r\nwhole interior of the mountain; masses of heated vapour and fluids begin\r\nto ascend, revealing themselves in some cases by the melting of the snow\r\nupon the flanks of the cone of ejection; while simultaneously with the\r\nfinal shock, which overcomes the last resistance opposed by the solid\r\ncrust of the ground, a considerable body of gas, and more especially of\r\nsteam, escapes from the mouth of the crater.\r\n\r\nThe steam, it is important to remark, is essentially the cause of the\r\nterrible mechanical effects which accompany volcanic eruptions.\r\nGranitic, porphyritic, trachytic, and sometimes even basaltic matters,\r\nhave reached the surface without producing any of those violent\r\nexplosions or ejections of rocks and stones which accompany modern\r\nvolcanic eruptions; the older granites, porphyries, trachytes, and\r\nbasalts were discharged without violence, because steam did not\r\naccompany those melted rocks--a sufficient proof of the comparative calm\r\nwhich attended the ancient as compared with modern eruptions. Well\r\nestablished by scientific observations, this is a fact which enables us\r\nto explain the cause of the tremendous mechanical effects attending\r\nmodern volcanic eruptions, contrasted with the more tranquil eruptions\r\nof earlier times.\r\n\r\nDuring the first moments of a volcanic eruption, the accumulated masses\r\nof stones and ashes, which fill the crater, are shot up into the sky by\r\nthe suddenly and powerfully developed elasticity of the steam. This\r\nsteam, which has been disengaged by the heat of the fluid lava, assumes\r\nthe form of great rounded bubbles, which are evolved into the air to a\r\ngreat height above the crater, where they expand as they rise, in clouds\r\nof dazzling whiteness, assuming that appearance which Pliny the Younger\r\ncompared to a stone pine rising over Vesuvius. The masses of clouds\r\nfinally condense and follow the direction of the wind.\r\n\r\nThese volcanic clouds are grey or black, according to the quantity of\r\n_ashes_, that is, of pulverulent matter or dust, mixed with watery\r\nvapour, which they convey. In some eruptions it has been observed that\r\nthese clouds, on descending to the surface of the soil, spread around an\r\nodour of hydrochloric or sulphuric acid, and traces of both these acids\r\nare found in the rain which proceeds from the condensation of these\r\nclouds.\r\n\r\nThe fleecy clouds of vapour which issue from the volcanoes are streaked\r\nwith lightning, followed by continuous peals of thunder; in condensing,\r\nthey discharge disastrous showers, which sweep the sides of the\r\nmountain. Many eruptions, known as _mud volcanoes_, and _watery\r\nvolcanoes_, are nothing more than these heavy rains, carrying down with\r\nthem showers of ashes, stones, and scoriæ, more or less mixed with\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nPassing on to the phenomena of which the crater is the scene at the time\r\nof an eruption, it is stated that at first there is an incessant rise\r\nand fall of the lava which fills the interior of the crater. This double\r\nmovement is often interrupted by violent explosions of gas. The crater\r\nof Kilauea, in the Island of Hawaii, contains a lake of molten matter\r\n1,600 feet broad, which is subject to such a double movement of\r\nelevation and depression. Each of the vaporous bubbles as it issues from\r\nthe crater presses the molten lava upwards, till it rises and bursts\r\nwith great force at the surface. A portion of the lava, half-cooled and\r\nreduced to scoriæ, is thus projected upwards, and the several fragments\r\nare hurled violently in all directions, like those of a shell at the\r\nmoment when it bursts.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of the fragments being thrown vertically into the\r\nair, fall back into the crater again. Many accumulating on the edge of\r\nthe opening add more and more to the height of the cone of eruption. The\r\nlighter and smaller fragments, as well as the fine ashes, are drawn\r\nupwards by the spiral vapours, and sometimes transported by the winds\r\nover almost incredible distances.\r\n\r\nIn 1794 the ashes from Vesuvius were carried as far as the extremity of\r\nCalabria. In 1812 the volcanic ashes of Saint Vincent, in the Antilles,\r\nwere carried eastward as far as Barbadoes, spreading such obscurity over\r\nthe island, that, in open day, passengers could not see their way.\r\nFinally, some of the masses of molten lava are shot singly into the air\r\nduring an eruption with a rapid rotatory motion, which causes them to\r\nassume the rounded shape in which they are known by the name of\r\n_volcanic bombs_.\r\n\r\nWe have already remarked that the lava, which in a fluid state fills the\r\ncrater and the internal vent or chimney of the volcano, is forced\r\nupwards by gaseous fluids, and by the steam which has been generated\r\nfrom the water, entangled with the lava. In some cases the mechanical\r\nforce of this vapour is so great as to drive the lava over the edge of\r\nthe crater, when it forms a fiery torrent, spreading over the sides of\r\nthe mountain. This only happens in the case of volcanoes of\r\ninconsiderable height; in lofty volcanoes it is not unusual for the lava\r\nthus to force an outlet for itself near the base of the mountain,\r\nthrough which the fiery stream discharges itself over the surrounding\r\ncountry. In such circumstances the lava cools somewhat rapidly; it\r\nbecomes hard and presents a scoriaceous crust on the surface, while the\r\nvapour escapes in jets of steam through the interstices. But under this\r\nsuperficial crust the lava retains its fluid state, cooling slowly in\r\nthe interior of the mass, while the thickening stream moves sluggishly\r\nalong, impeded in its progress by the fragments of rock which this\r\nburning river drives before it.\r\n\r\nThe rate at which a current of lava moves along depends upon its mass,\r\nupon its degree of fluidity, and upon the inclination of the ground. It\r\nhas been stated that certain streams of lava have traversed more than\r\n3,000 yards in an hour; but the rate at which they travel is usually\r\nmuch less, a man on foot being often able to outstrip them. These\r\nstreams, also, vary greatly in dimensions. The most considerable stream\r\nof lava from Etna had, in some parts, a thickness of nearly 120 feet,\r\nwith a breadth of a geographical mile and a half. The largest\r\nlava-stream which has been recorded issued from the Skaptár Jokul, in\r\nIceland, in 1783. It formed two currents, whose extremities were twenty\r\nleagues apart, and which from time to time presented a breadth of from\r\nseven to fifteen miles and a thickness of 650 feet.\r\n\r\nA peculiar effect, and which only simulates volcanic activity, is\r\nobservable in localities where _mud volcanoes_ exist. Volcanoes of this\r\nclass are for the most part conical hills of low elevation, with a\r\nhollow or depression at the centre, from which they discharge the mud\r\nwhich is forced upwards by gas and steam. The temperature of the ejected\r\nmatter is only slightly elevated. The mud, generally of a greyish\r\ncolour, with the odour of petroleum, is subject to the same alternating\r\nmovements which have been already ascribed to the fluid lava of\r\nvolcanoes, properly so called. The gases which force out this liquid\r\nmud, mixed with salts, gypsum, naphtha, sulphur, sometimes even of\r\nammonia, are usually carburetted hydrogen and carbonic acid. Everything\r\nleads to the conclusion that these compounds proceed, at least in great\r\npart, from the reaction produced between the various elements of the\r\nsubsoil under the influence of infiltrating water between bituminous\r\nmarls, complex carbonates, and probably carbonic acid, derived from\r\nacidulated springs. M. Fournet saw in Languedoc, near Roujan, traces of\r\nsome of these formations; and not far from that neighbourhood is the\r\nbituminous spring of Gabian.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IV.--Mud volcano at Turbaco, South America.]\r\n\r\nMud volcanoes, or _salses_, exist in rather numerous localities. Several\r\nare found in the neighbourhood of Modena. There are some in Sicily,\r\nbetween Aragona and Girgenti. Pallas observed them in the Crimea--in the\r\npeninsula of Kertch, and in the Isle of Tamàn. Von Humboldt has\r\ndescribed and figured a group of them in the province of Cartagena, in\r\nSouth America. Finally, they have been observed in the Island of\r\nTrinidad and in Hindostan. In 1797 an eruption of mud ejected from\r\nTunguragua, in Quito, filled a valley 1,000 feet wide to a depth of 600\r\nfeet. On the opposite page is represented the mud volcano of Turbaco, in\r\nthe province of Cartagena (PLATE IV.), which is described and figured by\r\nVon Humboldt in his “Voyage to the Equatorial Regions of America.”\r\n\r\nIn certain countries we find small hillocks of argillaceous formation,\r\nresulting from ancient discharges of mud volcanoes, from which all\r\ndisengagement of gas, water, and mud has long ceased. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, the phenomenon returns and resumes its interrupted course with\r\ngreat violence. Slight shocks of earthquakes are then felt; blocks of\r\ndried earth are projected from the ancient crater, and new waves of mud\r\nflow over its edge, and spread over the neighbouring ground.\r\n\r\nTo return to ordinary volcanoes, that is to say, those which eject lava.\r\nAt the end of a lava-flow, when the violence of the volcanic action\r\nbegins to subside, the discharge from the crater is confined to the\r\ndisengagement of vaporous gases, mixed with steam, which make their\r\nescape in more or less abundance through a multitude of fissures in the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe great number of volcanoes which have thus become extinct form what\r\nare called _solfataras_. The sulphuretted hydrogen, which is given out\r\nthrough the fissures in the ground, is decomposed by contact with the\r\nair, water being formed by the action of the oxygen of the atmosphere,\r\nand sulphur deposited in considerable quantities on the walls of the\r\ncrater, and in the cracks of the ground. Such is the geological source\r\nof the sulphur which is collected at Pozzuoli, near Naples, and in many\r\nother similar regions--a substance which plays a most important part in\r\nthe industrial occupations of the world. It is, in fact, from sulphur\r\nextracted from the ground about the mouths of extinct volcanoes, that is\r\nto say from the products of _solfataras_, that sulphuric acid is\r\nfrequently made--sulphuric acid being the fundamental agent, one of the\r\nmost powerful elements, of the manufacturing productions of both worlds.\r\n\r\nThe last phase of volcanic activity is the disengagement of carbonic\r\nacid gas without any increase of temperature. In places where these\r\ncontinued emanations of carbonic acid gas manifest themselves, the\r\nexistence of ancient volcanoes may be recognised, of which these\r\ndischarges are the closing phenomenon. This is seen in a most remarkable\r\nmanner in Auvergne, where there are a multitude of acidulated springs,\r\nthat is to say, springs charged with carbonic acid. During the time when\r\nhe was opening the mines of Pontgibaud, M. Fournet had to contend with\r\nemanations which sometimes exhibited themselves with explosive power.\r\nJets of water were thrown to great heights in the galleries, roaring\r\nwith the noise of steam when escaping from the boiler of a locomotive\r\nengine. The water which filled an abandoned mine-shaft was, on two\r\nseparate occasions, upheaved with great violence--half emptying the\r\npit--while vast volumes of the gas overspread the whole valley,\r\nsuffocating a horse and a flock of geese. The miners were compelled to\r\nfly in all haste at the moment when the gas burst forth, holding\r\nthemselves as upright as possible, to avoid plunging their heads into\r\nthe carbonic acid gas, which, from its low specific gravity, was now\r\nfilling the lower parts of the galleries. It represented on a small\r\nscale the effect of the _Grotto del Cane_, which excites such surprise\r\namong the ignorant near Naples; passing, also, for one of the marvels of\r\nNature all over the world. M. Fournet states that all the minute\r\nfissures of the metalliferous gneiss near Clermont are quite saturated\r\nwith free carbonic acid gas, which rises plentifully from the soil\r\nthere, as well as in many parts of the surrounding country. The\r\ncomponents of the gneiss, with the exception of the quartz, are softened\r\nby it; and fresh combinations of the acid with lime, iron, and manganese\r\nare continually taking place. In short, long after volcanoes have become\r\nextinct, hot springs, charged with mineral ingredients, continue to flow\r\nin the same area.\r\n\r\nThe same facts as those of the _Grotto del Cane_ manifest themselves\r\nwith even greater intensity in Java, in the so-called Valley of Poison,\r\nwhich is an object of terror to the natives. In this celebrated valley\r\nthe ground is said to be covered with skeletons and carcases of tigers,\r\ngoats, stags, birds, and even of human beings; for asphyxia or\r\nsuffocation, it seems, strikes all living things which venture into this\r\ndesolate place. In the same island a stream of sulphurous water, as\r\nwhite as milk, issues from the crater of Mount Idienne, on the east\r\ncoast; and on one occasion, as cited by Nozet in the _Journal de\r\nGéologie_, a great body of hot water, charged with sulphuric acid, was\r\ndischarged from the same volcano, inundating and destroying all the\r\nvegetation of a large tract of country by its noxious fumes and\r\npoisonous properties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: V.--Great Geyser of Iceland.]\r\n\r\nIt is known that the alkaline waters of Plombières, in the Vosges, have\r\na temperature of 160° Fahr. For 2,000 years, according to Daubrée,\r\nthrough beds of concrete, of lime, brick, and sandstone, these hot\r\nwaters have percolated until they have originated calcareous spar,\r\naragonite, and fluor spar, together with siliceous minerals, such as\r\nopal, which are found filling the interstices of the bricks and mortar.\r\nFrom these and other similar statements, “we are led,” says Sir Charles\r\nLyell,[26] “to infer that when in the bowels of the earth there are\r\nlarge volumes of molten matter, containing heated water and various\r\nacids, under enormous pressure, these subterraneous fluid masses will\r\ngradually part with their heat by the escape of steam and various gases\r\nthrough fissures producing hot springs, or by the passage of the same\r\nthrough the pores of the overlying and injected rocks.” “Although,” he\r\nadds,[27] “we can only study the phenomena as exhibited at the surface,\r\nit is clear that the gaseous fluids must have made their way through the\r\nwhole thickness of the porous or fissured rocks, which intervene between\r\nthe subterraneous reservoirs of gas and the external air. The extent,\r\ntherefore, of the earth’s crust which the vapours have permeated, and\r\nare now permeating, may be thousands of fathoms in thickness, and their\r\nheating and modifying influence may be spread throughout the whole of\r\nthis solid mass.”\r\n\r\n  [26] “Elements of Geology,” p. 732.\r\n\r\n  [27] Ibid, p. 733.\r\n\r\nThe fountains of boiling water, known under the name of _Geysers_, are\r\nanother emanation connected with ancient craters. They are either\r\ncontinuous or intermittent. In Iceland we find great numbers of these\r\ngushing springs--in fact, the island is one entire mass of eruptive\r\nrock. Nearly all the volcanoes are situated upon a broad band of\r\ntrachyte, which traverses the island from south-west to north-east. It\r\nis traversed by immense fissures, and covered with masses of lava, such\r\nas no other country presents. The volcanic action, in short, goes on\r\nwith such energy that certain paroxysms of Mount Hecla have lasted for\r\nsix years without interruption. But the Great Geyser, represented on the\r\nopposite page (PLATE V.), is, perhaps, even more an object of curiosity.\r\nThis water-volcano projects a column of boiling water, eight yards in\r\ndiameter, charged with silica, to the height, it has been said, of about\r\n150 feet, depositing vast quantities of silica as it cools after\r\nreaching the earth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe volcanoes in actual activity are, as we have said, very numerous,\r\nbeing more than 200 in number, scattered over the whole surface of the\r\nglobe, but mostly occurring in tropical regions. The island of Java\r\nalone contains about fifty, which have been mapped and described by Dr.\r\nJunghahn. Those best known are Vesuvius, near Naples; Etna, in Sicily;\r\nand Stromboli, in the Lipari Islands. A rapid sketch of a few of these\r\nmay interest the reader.\r\n\r\nVesuvius is of all volcanoes that which has been most closely studied;\r\nit is, so to speak, the classical volcano. Few persons are ignorant of\r\nthe fact that it opened--after a period of quiescence extending beyond\r\nthe memory of living man--in the year 79 of our era. This eruption cost\r\nthe elder Pliny his life, who fell a sacrifice to his desire to witness\r\none of the most imposing of natural phenomena. After many mutations the\r\npresent crater of Vesuvius consists of a cone, surrounded on the side\r\nopposite the sea by a semicircular crest, composed of pumiceous matter,\r\nforeign to Vesuvius properly speaking, for we believe that Mount\r\nVesuvius was originally the mountain to which the name of _Somma_ is now\r\ngiven. The cone which now bears the name of Vesuvius was probably formed\r\nduring the celebrated eruption of 79, which buried under its showers of\r\npumiceous ashes the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. This cone\r\nterminates in a crater, the shape of which has undergone many changes,\r\nand which has, since its origin, thrown out eruptions of a varied\r\ncharacter, together with streams of lava. In our days the eruptions of\r\nVesuvius have only been separated by intervals of a few years.\r\n\r\nThe Lipari Isles contain the volcano of Stromboli, which is continually\r\nin a state of ignition, and forms the natural lighthouse of the\r\nTyrrhenian Sea; such it was when Homer mentioned it, such it was before\r\nold Homer’s time, and such it still appears in our days. Its eruptions\r\nare incessant. The crater whence they issue is not situated on the\r\nsummit of the cone, but upon one of its sides, at nearly two-thirds of\r\nits height. It is in part filled with fluid lava, which is continually\r\nsubjected to alternate elevation and depression--a movement provoked by\r\nthe ebullition and ascension of bubbles of steam which rise to the\r\nsurface, projecting upwards a tall column of ashes. During the night\r\nthese clouds of vapour shine with a magnificent red reflection, which\r\nlights up the whole isle and the surrounding sea with a lurid glow.\r\n\r\nSituated on the eastern coast of Sicily, Etna appears, at the first\r\nglance, to have a much more simple structure than Vesuvius. Its slopes\r\nare less steep, more uniform on all sides; its vast base nearly\r\nrepresents the form of a buckler. The lower portion of Etna, or the\r\ncultivated region of the mountain, has an inclination of about three\r\ndegrees. The middle, or forest region, is steeper, and has an\r\ninclination of about eight degrees. The mountain terminates in a cone\r\nof an elliptical form of thirty-two degrees of inclination, which bears\r\nin the middle, above a nearly horizontal terrace, the cone of eruption\r\nwith its circular crater. The crater is 10,874 feet high. It gives out\r\nno lava, but only vomits forth gas and vapour, the streams of lava\r\nissuing from sixteen smaller cones which have been formed on the slopes\r\nof the mountain. The observer may, by looking at the summit, convince\r\nhimself that these cones are disposed in rays, and are based upon clefts\r\nor fissures which converge towards the crater as towards a centre.\r\n\r\nBut the most extraordinary display of volcanic phenomena occurs in the\r\nPacific Ocean, in the Sandwich Islands, and in Java. Mauna Loa and Mauna\r\nKea, in Hawaii, are huge flattened cones, 14,000 feet high. According to\r\nMr. Dana, these lofty, featureless hills sometimes throw out successive\r\nstreams of lava, not very far below their summits, often two miles in\r\nbreadth and six-and-twenty in length; and that not from one vent, but in\r\nevery direction, from the apex of the cone down slopes varying from four\r\nto eight degrees of inclination. The lateral crater of Kilauea, on the\r\nflank of Mauna Loa, is from 3,000 to 4,000 feet above the level of the\r\nsea--an immense chasm 1,000 feet deep, with an outer circuit two to\r\nthree miles in diameter. At the bottom lava is seen to boil up in a\r\nmolten lake, the level of which rises or falls according to the active\r\nor quiescent state of the volcano; but in place of overflowing, the\r\ncolumn of melted rock, when the pressure becomes excessive, forces a\r\npassage through subterranean communications leading to the sea. One of\r\nthese outbursts, which took place at an ancient wooded crater six miles\r\neast of Kilauea, was observed by Mr. Coan, a missionary, in June, 1840.\r\nAnother indication of the subterranean progress of the lava took place a\r\nmile or two beyond this, in which the fiery flood spread itself over\r\nfifty acres of land, and then found its way underground for several\r\nmiles further, to reappear at the bottom of a second ancient wooded\r\ncrater which it partly filled up.[28]\r\n\r\n  [28] Lyell’s “Elements of Geology,” p. 617.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic mountains of Java constitute the highest peaks of a\r\nmountain-range running through the island from east to west, on which\r\nDr. Junghahn described and mapped forty-six conical eminences, ranging\r\nfrom 4,000 to 11,000 feet high. At the top of many of the loftiest of\r\nthese Dr. Junghahn found the active cones and craters of small size, and\r\nsurrounded by a plain of ashes and sand, which he calls the “old crater\r\nwall,” sometimes exceeding 1,000 feet in vertical height, and many of\r\nthe semicircular walls enclosing large cavities or _calderas_, four\r\ngeographical miles in diameter. From the highest parts of many of these\r\nhollows rivers flow, which, in the course of ages, have cut out deep\r\nvalleys in the mountain’s side.[29]\r\n\r\n  [29] Lyell’s “Elements of Geology,” p. 620.\r\n\r\nTo this rapid sketch of actually existing volcanic phenomena we may add\r\na brief notice of submarine volcanoes. If these are known to us only in\r\nsmall numbers, the circumstance is explained by the fact that their\r\nappearance above the bosom of the sea is almost invariably followed by a\r\nmore or less complete disappearance; at the same time such very striking\r\nand visible phenomena afford a sufficient proof of the continued\r\npersistence of volcanic action beneath the bed of the sea-basin. At\r\nvarious times islands have suddenly appeared, amid the ocean, at points\r\nwhere the navigator had not before noticed them. In this manner we have\r\nwitnessed the island called Graham’s, Ferdinanda, or Julia, which\r\nsuddenly appeared off the south-west coast Sicily in 1831, and was swept\r\naway by the waves two months afterwards.[30] At several periods also,\r\nand notably in 1811, new islands were formed in the Azores, which raised\r\nthemselves above the waves by repeated efforts all round the islands,\r\nand at many other points.\r\n\r\n  [30] Ibid, p. 620.\r\n\r\nThe island which appeared in 1796 ten leagues from the northern point of\r\nUnalaska, one of the Aleutian group of islands, is specially remarkable.\r\nWe first see a column of smoke issuing from the bosom of the ocean,\r\nafterwards a black point appears, from which bundles of fiery sparks\r\nseem to rise over the surface of the sea. During the many months that\r\nthese phenomena continue, the island increases in breadth and in height.\r\nFinally smoke only is seen; at the end of four years, even this last\r\ntrace of volcanic convulsion altogether ceases. The island continued,\r\nnevertheless, to enlarge and to increase in height, and in 1806 it\r\nformed a cone, surmounted by four other smaller ones.\r\n\r\nIn the space comprised between the isles of Santorin, Tharasia, and\r\nAspronisi, in the Mediterranean, there arose, 160 years before our era,\r\nthe island of _Hyera_, which was enlarged by the upheaval of islets on\r\nits margin during the years 19, 726, and 1427. Again, in 1773,\r\nMicra-Kameni, and in 1707, Nea-Kameni, made their appearance. These\r\nislands increased in size successively in 1709, in 1711, in 1712.\r\nAccording to ancient writers, Santorin, Tharasia, and Aspronisi, made\r\ntheir appearance many ages before the Christian era, at the termination\r\nof earthquakes of great violence.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETAMORPHIC ROCKS.\r\n\r\nThe rocks composing the terrestrial crust have not always remained in\r\ntheir original state. They have frequently undergone changes which have\r\naltogether modified their properties, physical and chemical.\r\n\r\nWhen they present these characteristics, we term them _Metamorphic\r\nRocks_. The phenomena which belong to this subject are at once important\r\nand new, and have lately much attracted the attention of geologists. We\r\nshall best enlighten our readers on the metamorphism of rocks, if we\r\ntreat of it under the heads of _special_ and _general_ metamorphism.\r\n\r\nWhen a mass of eruptive rock penetrates the terrestrial crust it\r\nsubjects the rocks through which it passes to a special metamorphism--to\r\nthe effects of _heat_ produced by _contact_. Such effects may almost\r\nalways be observed near the margin of masses of eruptive rock, and they\r\nare attributable either to the communicated heat of the eruptive rock\r\nitself, or to the disengagement of gases, of steam, or of mineral and\r\nthermal waters, which have accompanied its eruption. The effects vary\r\nnot only with the rock ejected, but even with the nature of the rock\r\nsurrounding it.\r\n\r\nIn the case of volcanic lava ejected in a molten state, for instance,\r\nthe modifications it effects on the surrounding rock are very\r\ncharacteristic. Its structure becomes prismatic, full of cracks, often\r\ncellular and scoriaceous. Wood and other combustibles touched by the\r\nlava are consumed or partially carbonised. Limestone assumes a granular\r\nand crystalline texture. Siliceous rocks are transformed, not only into\r\nquartz like glass, but they also combine with various bases, and yield\r\nvitreous and cellular silicates. It is nearly the same with argillaceous\r\nrocks, which adhere together, and frequently take the colour of red\r\nbricks.\r\n\r\nThe surrounding rock is frequently impregnated with specular iron-ore,\r\nand penetrated with hydrochloric or sulphuric acid, and by divers salts\r\nformed from these acids.\r\n\r\nAt a certain distance from the place of contact with the lava, the\r\naction of water aided by heat produces silica, carbonate of lime,\r\naragonite, zeolite, and various other minerals.\r\n\r\nFrom immediate contact with the lava, then, the metamorphic rocks denote\r\nthe action of a very strong heat. They bear evident traces of\r\ncalcination, of softening, and even of fusion. When they present\r\nthemselves as hydrosilicates and carbonates, the silica and associated\r\nminerals are most frequently at some distance from the points of\r\ncontact; and the formation of these minerals is probably due to the\r\ncombination of water and heat, although this last ceases to be the\r\nprincipal agent.\r\n\r\nThe hydrated volcanic rocks, such as the basalts and trappean rocks in\r\ngeneral, continue to produce effects of metamorphism, in which heat\r\noperates, although its influence is inconsiderable, water being much the\r\nmore powerful agent. The metamorphosis which is observable in the\r\nstructure and mineralogical composition of neighbouring rocks is as\r\nfollows:--The structure of separation becomes fragmentary, columnar, or\r\nmany-sided, and even prismatic. It becomes especially prismatic in\r\ncombustibles, in sandstones, in argillaceous formations, in felspathic\r\nrocks, and even in limestones. Prisms are formed perpendicular to the\r\nsurface of contact, their length sometimes exceeding six feet. Most\r\ncommonly they still contain water or volatile matter. These characters\r\nmay be observed at the junction of the basalts which has been ejected\r\nupon the argillaceous strata near Clermont in Auvergne, at Polignac, and\r\nin the neighbourhood of Le Puy-en-Velay.\r\n\r\nIf the vein of Basalt or Trap has traversed a bed of coal or of lignite,\r\nwe find the combustible strongly _metamorphosed_ at the point of\r\ncontact. Sometimes it becomes cellular and is changed into _coke_. This\r\nis especially the case in the coal-basin of Brassac. But more frequently\r\nthe coal has lost all, or part of, its bituminous and volatile\r\nmatter--it has been metamorphosed into anthracite--as an example we may\r\nquote the lignite of Mont Meisner.\r\n\r\nAgain, in some exceptional cases, the combustible may even be changed\r\ninto graphite near to its junction with Trap. This is observed at the\r\ncoal-mine of New Cumnock in Ayrshire.\r\n\r\nWhen near its junction with a _trappean_ rock, a combustible has been\r\nmetamorphosed into _coke_ or anthracite, it is also frequently\r\nimpregnated by hydrated oxide of iron, by clay, foliated carbonate of\r\nlime, iron pyrites, and by various mineral veins. It may happen that the\r\ncombustible has been reduced to a pulverulent state, in which case it is\r\nunfit for use. Such is the case in a coal-mine at Newcastle, where the\r\ncoal lies within thirty yards of a dyke of Trap.\r\n\r\nWhen Basalt and Trap have been ejected through limestone rock, the\r\nlatter becomes more or less altered. Near the points of contact, the\r\nmetamorphism which they have undergone is revealed by the change of\r\ncolour and aspect, which is exhibited all around the vein, often also by\r\nthe development of a crystalline structure. Limestone becomes granular\r\nand saccharoid--it is changed into marble. The most remarkable instance\r\nof this metamorphism is the Carrara marble, a non-fossiliferous\r\nlimestone of the Oolite series, which has been altered and the fossils\r\ndestroyed; so that the marble of these celebrated quarries, once\r\nsupposed to have been formed before the creation of organic beings, is\r\nnow shown to be an altered limestone of the Oolitic period, and the\r\nunderlying crystalline schists are sandstones and shales of secondary\r\nage modified by plutonic action.\r\n\r\nThe action of basalt upon limestone is observable at Villeneuve de Berg,\r\nin Auvergne; but still more in the neighbourhood of Belfast, where we\r\nmay see the Chalk changed into saccharoid limestone near to its contact\r\nwith the Trap. Sometimes the metamorphism extends many feet from the\r\npoint of contact; nay, more than that, some zeolites and other minerals\r\nseem to be developed in the crystallised limestone.\r\n\r\nWhen sandstone is found in contact with trappean rock, it presents\r\nunequivocal traces of metamorphism; it loses its reddish colour and\r\nbecomes white, grey, green, or black; parallel veins may be detected\r\nwhich give it a jaspideous structure; it separates into prisms\r\nperpendicular to the walls of the injected veins, when it assumes a\r\nbrilliant and vitreous lustre. Sometimes it is even also found\r\npenetrated by zeolites, a family of minerals which melt before the\r\nblowpipe with considerable ebullition. The mottled sandstones of\r\nGermany, which are traversed by veins of basalt, often exhibit\r\nmetamorphism, particularly at Wildenstern, in Würtemberg.\r\n\r\nArgillaceous rocks, like all others, are subject to metamorphism when\r\nthey come in contact with eruptive trappean rocks. In these\r\ncircumstances they change colour and assume a varied or prismatic\r\nstructure; at the same time their hardness increases, and they become\r\nlithoidal or stony in structure. They may also become cellular--form\r\nzeolites in their cavities with foliated carbonate of lime, as well as\r\nminerals which commonly occur in amygdaloid. Sometimes even the fissures\r\nare coated by the metallic minerals, and the other minerals which\r\naccompany them in their metalliferous beds. Generally they lose a part\r\nof their water and of their carbonic acid. In other circumstances they\r\ncombine with oxide of iron and the alkalies. This has been asserted, for\r\nexample, at Essey, in the department of the Meurthe, where a very\r\nargillaceous sandstone is found, charged with jasper porcellanite, near\r\nto the junction of the rock with a vein of basalt.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have spoken only of the metamorphosis the result of volcanic\r\naction. A few words will suffice to acquaint the reader with the\r\nmetamorphism exercised by the porphyries and granites. By contact with\r\ngranite, we find coal changed into anthracite or graphite. It is\r\nimportant to note, however, that coal has seldom been metamorphosed into\r\ncoke. As to the limestone, it is sometimes, as we have seen, transformed\r\ninto marble; we even find in its interior divers minerals, notably\r\nsilicates with a calcareous base, such as garnets, pyroxene, hornblende,\r\n&c. The sandstones and clay-slates have alike been altered.\r\n\r\nThe surrounding deposit and the eruptive rock are both frequently\r\nimpregnated with quartz, carbonate of lime, sulphate of baryta,\r\nfluorides, and, in a word, with the whole tribe of metalliferous\r\nminerals, which present themselves, besides, with the characteristics\r\nwhich are common to them in the veins.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL METAMORPHISM.\r\n\r\nSedimentary rocks sometimes exhibit all the symptoms of metamorphism\r\nwhere there is no evidence of direct eruptive action, and that upon a\r\nscale much grander than in the case of special metamorphism. It is\r\nobservable over whole regions, in which it has modified and altered\r\nsimultaneously all the surrounding rocks. This state of things is called\r\ngeneral, or normal, metamorphism. The fundamental gneiss, which covers\r\nsuch a vast extent of country, is the most striking instance known of\r\ngeneral metamorphism. It was first described by Sir W. E. Logan,\r\nDirector of the Canadian Geological Survey, who estimates its thickness\r\nat 30,000 feet. The Laurentian Gneiss is a term which is used by\r\ngeologists to designate those metamorphic rocks which are known to be\r\nolder than the Cambrian system. They are parts of the old pre-Cambrian\r\ncontinents which lie at the base of the great American continent,\r\nScandinavia, the Hebrides, &c.; and which are largely developed on the\r\nwest coast of Scotland. In order to give the reader some idea of this\r\nmetamorphism, we shall endeavour to trace its effects in rocks of the\r\nsame nature, indicating the characters successively presented by the\r\nrocks according to the intensity of the metamorphism to which they have\r\nbeen subjected.\r\n\r\nCombustibles, which have a special composition, totally different from\r\nall other rocks, are obviously the first objects of examination. When we\r\ndescend in the series of sedimentary deposits, the combustibles are\r\nobserved completely to change their characters. From the _peat_ which is\r\nthe product of our own epoch, we pass to _lignite_, to _coal_, to\r\n_anthracite_, and even to _graphite_; and find that their density\r\nincreases, varying up to at least double. Hydrogen, nitrogen, and,\r\nabove all, oxygen, diminish rapidly. Volatile and bituminous matters\r\ndecrease, while carbon undergoes a proportionate increase.\r\n\r\nThis metamorphism of the combustible minerals, which takes place in\r\ndeposits of different ages, may also be observed even in the same bed.\r\nFor instance, in the coal formations of America, which extend to the\r\nwest of the Alleghany mountains, the Coal-measures contain a certain\r\nproportion of volatile matter, which goes on diminishing in proportion\r\nas we approach the granite rocks; this proportion rises to fifty per\r\ncent. upon the Ohio, but it falls to forty upon the Manon-Gahela, and\r\neven to sixteen in the Alleghanies. Finally, in the regions where the\r\nstrata have been most disturbed, in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, the\r\ncoal has been metamorphosed into anthracite and even into graphite or\r\nplumbago.\r\n\r\nLimestone is one of the rocks upon which we can most easily follow the\r\neffects of general metamorphism. When it has not been modified, it is\r\nusually found in sedimentary rocks in the state of compact limestone, of\r\ncoarse limestone, or of earthy limestone such as chalk. But let us\r\nconsider it in the mountains, especially in mountains which are at the\r\nsame time granitic, such as the Pyrenees, the Vosges, and the Alps. We\r\nshall then see its characters completely modified. In the long and deep\r\nvalleys of the Alps, for example, we can follow the alterations of the\r\nlimestone for many leagues, the beds losing more and more their\r\nregularity in proportion as we approach the central chain, until they\r\nlose themselves in solitary pinnacles and projections enclosed in\r\ncrystalline schists or granitic rocks. Towards the upper regions of the\r\nAlps the limestone divides itself into pseudo-regular fragments, it is\r\nmore strongly cemented, more compact, more sonorous; its colour becomes\r\npaler, and it passes from black to grey by the gradual disappearance of\r\norganic and bituminous matter with which it has been impregnated, at the\r\nsame time its crystalline structure increases in a manner scarcely\r\nperceptible. It may even be observed to be metamorphosed into an\r\naggregate of microscopic crystals, and finally to pass into a white\r\nsaccharoid limestone.\r\n\r\nThis metamorphism is produced without any decomposition of the\r\nlimestone; it has rather been softened and half melted by the heat, that\r\nis, rendered plastic, so to speak, for we find in it fossils still\r\nrecognisable, and among these, notably, some Ammonites and Belemnites,\r\nthe presence of which enables us to state that it is the greyish-black\r\nJurassic limestone, which has been transformed into white saccharoid or\r\ngranular limestone. If the limestone subjected to this transformation\r\nwere perfectly pure, it would simply take a crystalline structure; but\r\nit is generally mixed with sand and various argillaceous matters, which\r\nhave been deposited along with it, matters which go to form new\r\nminerals. These new minerals, however, are not disseminated by chance;\r\nthey develop themselves in the direction of the lamination, so to speak,\r\nof the limestone, and in its fissures, in such a manner that they\r\npresent themselves in nodules, seams, and sometimes in veins.\r\n\r\nAmong the principal minerals of the saccharoid limestone we may mention\r\ngraphite, quartz, some very varied silicates, such as andalusite,\r\ndisthene, serpentine, talc, garnet, augite, hornblende, epidote,\r\nchlorite, the micas, the felspars; finally, spinel, corundum, phosphate\r\nof lime, oxide of iron and oligiste, iron pyrites, &c. Besides these,\r\nvarious minerals in veins figure among those which exist more commonly\r\nin the saccharoid limestone.\r\n\r\nWhen metamorphic limestone is sufficiently pure, it is employed as\r\nstatuary marble. Such is the geological origin of Carrara marble, which\r\nis quarried in the Apuan Alps on a great scale; such, also, was the\r\nmarble of Paros and Antiparos, still so celebrated for its purity. On\r\nexamination, however, with the lens the Carrara marble exhibits blackish\r\nveins and spangles of graphite; the finest blocks, also, frequently\r\ncontain nodules of ironstone, which are lined with perfectly limpid\r\ncrystals of quartz. These accidental defects are very annoying to the\r\nsculptor, for they are very minute, and nothing on the exterior of the\r\nblock betrays their existence. In the marble of Paros, even when it is\r\nstrongly translucent, specks of mica are often found. In the ancient\r\nquarries the nodules are so numerous as to have hindered their being\r\nworked, up even to the present time.\r\n\r\nWhen the mica which occurs in granular limestone takes a green colour\r\nand forms veins, it constitutes the Cipoline marble, which is found in\r\nCorsica, and in the Val Godemar in the Alps. Some white marbles are\r\nquarried in France, chiefly at Loubie, at Sost, at Saint-Béat in the\r\nPyrenees, and at Chippal in the Vosges. In our country, and especially\r\nin Ireland, there are numerous quarries of marble, veined and coloured\r\nof every hue, but none of a purity suitable for the finest statuary\r\npurposes. All these marbles are only metamorphosed limestones.\r\n\r\nThe white marbles employed almost all over the world are those of\r\nCarrara. They result from the metamorphism of limestone of the Lias.\r\nThey have not been penetrated by the eruptive rocks, but they have been\r\nsubjected upon a great scale to a general metamorphism, to which their\r\ncrystalline structure may be attributed.\r\n\r\nIt is easily understood that the calcareous strata have not undergone\r\nsuch an energetic metamorphism without the beds of sandstone and clay,\r\nassociated with them, having also undergone some modification of the\r\nsame kind. The siliceous beds accompanying the saccharoid limestone\r\nhave, in short, a character of their own. They are formed of small\r\ngrains of transparent quartz more or less cemented one to the other in a\r\nmanner strongly resembling those of the saccharoid limestone. Between\r\nthese grains are usually developed some lamellæ of mica of brilliant and\r\nsilky lustre, of which the colour is white, red, or green; in a word, it\r\nhas produced a _quartzite_. Some veins of quartz frequently traverse\r\nthis quartzite in all directions. Independent of the mica, it may\r\ncontain, besides, the different minerals already mentioned as occurring\r\nin the limestone, and particularly silicates--such as disthene,\r\nandalusite, staurotide, garnet, and hornblende.\r\n\r\nThe argillaceous beds present a series of metamorphisms analogous to the\r\npreceding. We can follow them readily through all their gradations when\r\nwe direct our attention towards such granitic masses as those which\r\nconstitute the Alps, Pyrenees, the Bretagne Mountains, or our own\r\nGrampians. The schists may perhaps be considered the first step towards\r\nthe metamorphism of certain argillaceous rocks; in fact, the schists are\r\nnot susceptible of mixing with water like clay; they become stony, and\r\nacquire a much greater density, but their chief characteristic is a\r\nfoliated structure.\r\n\r\nExperiment proves that when we subject a substance to a great pressure a\r\nfoliated structure is produced in a direction perpendicular to that in\r\nwhich the pressure is exercised. Everything leads us, therefore, to\r\nbelieve that pressure is the principal cause of the schistous texture,\r\nand of the foliation of clay-slates, the most characteristic variety of\r\nwhich is the roofing-slate which is quarried so extensively in North\r\nWales, in Cumberland, and various parts of Scotland in the British\r\nIslands; in the Ardennes; and in the neighbourhood of Angers, in France.\r\n\r\nIn some localities the slate becomes siliceous and is charged with\r\ncrystals of felspar. Nevertheless, it still presents itself in parallel\r\nbeds, and contains the same fossil remains still in a recognisable\r\nstate. For example, in the neighbourhood of Thann, in the Vosges,\r\ncertain vegetable imprints are perfectly preserved in the metamorphic\r\nschist, and in their midst are developed some crystals of felspar.\r\n\r\nMica-schist, which is formed of layers of quartz and mica, is found\r\nhabitually associated with rocks which have taken a crystalline\r\nstructure, proceeding evidently from an energetic metamorphism of beds\r\noriginally argillaceous. Chiastolite, disthene, staurotide, hornblende,\r\nand other minerals are found in it. Mica-schists occur extensively in\r\nBrittany, in the Vosges, in the Pyrenees. In all cases, as we approach\r\nthe masses of granite, in these regions, the crystalline structure\r\nbecomes more and more marked.\r\n\r\nIn describing the various facts relating to the metamorphism of rocks,\r\nwe have said little of the causes which have produced it. The causes\r\nare, indeed, in the region of hypothesis, and somewhat mysterious.\r\n\r\nIn what concerns special metamorphism, the cause is supposed to admit of\r\neasy explanation--it is heat. When a rock is ejected from the interior\r\nof the earth in a state of igneous fusion, we comprehend readily enough\r\nthat the strata, which it traverses, should sustain alterations due to\r\nthe influence of heat, and varying with its intensity. This is clear\r\nenough in the case of _lava_. On the other hand, as water always exists\r\nin the interior of the earth’s crust, and as this water must be at a\r\nvery high temperature in the neighbourhood of volcanic fires, it\r\ncontributes, no doubt, largely to the metamorphism. If the rocks have\r\nnot been ejected in a state of fusion, it is evidently water, with the\r\ndifferent mineral substances it holds in solution, which is the chief\r\nactor in the special metamorphism which is produced.\r\n\r\nIn general metamorphism, water appears still to be the principal agent.\r\nAs it is infiltered through the various beds it will modify their\r\ncomposition, either by dissolving certain substances, or by introducing\r\ninto the metalliferous deposits certain new substances, such as may be\r\nseen forming, even under our eyes, in mineral springs. This has tended\r\nto render the sedimentary deposits plastic, and has permitted the\r\ndevelopment of that crystalline structure, which is one of the principal\r\ncharacteristics of metamorphic rocks. This action has been seconded by\r\nother causes, notably by heat and pressure, which would have an immense\r\nincrease of power and energy when metamorphism takes place at a great\r\ndepth beneath the surface. Dr. Holl, in an able paper descriptive of the\r\ngeology of the Malvern Hills, read before the Geological Society in\r\nFebruary, 1865, adopts this hypothesis as explanatory of the vast\r\nphenomena which are there displayed. After describing the position of\r\nthis interesting and strangely-mingled range of rocks, he adds: “These\r\nmetamorphic rocks are for the most part highly inclined, and often in a\r\nposition nearly vertical. Their disturbance and metamorphism, their\r\nbeing traversed by granitic veins, and still later their invasion by\r\ntrap-dykes and their subsequent elevation above the sea-level, were all\r\nevents which must have occupied no inconsiderable period, even of\r\ngeological time. I presume,” he adds, “that it will not be maintained\r\nin the present day that the metamorphism of rocks over areas of any but\r\nvery moderate extent is due to the intrusion of veins and erupted\r\nmasses. The insufficiency of such agency becomes the more obvious when\r\nwe consider the slight effects produced by even tolerably extensive\r\noutbursts, such as the Dartmoor granite; while in the case of the\r\nMalverns there is an absence of any local cause whatever. The more\r\nprobable explanation in the case of these larger areas is, that they\r\nwere faulted down, or otherwise depressed, so as to be brought within\r\nthe influence of the earth’s internal heat, and this is the more likely\r\nas they belong to an epoch when the crust is believed to have been\r\nthinner.” When it is considered that, according to the doctrine of\r\nmodern geology, the Laurentian rocks, or their equivalents, lie at the\r\nbase of all the sedimentary deposits; that this, like other systems of\r\nstratified rocks, was deposited in the form of sand, mud, and clay, to\r\nthe thickness of 30,000 feet; and that over an area embracing\r\nScandinavia, the Hebrides, great part of Scotland, and England as far\r\nsouth as the Malverns, besides a large proportion of the American\r\ncontinent, with certain forms of animal life, as recent investigations\r\ndemonstrate--can the mind of man realise any other cause by which this\r\nvast extent of metamorphism could have been produced?\r\n\r\nElectric and galvanic currents, circulating in the stratified crust, are\r\nnot to be overlooked. The experiments of Mr. R. W. Fox and Mr. Robert\r\nHunt suggest that, in passing long-continued galvanic currents through\r\nmasses of moistened clay, there is a tendency to produce cleavage and a\r\nsemi-crystalline arrangement of the particles of matter.[31]\r\n\r\n  [31] Report of the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society for 1837. Robert\r\n       Hunt, in “Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Great Britain,”\r\n       vol. i., p. 433.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe theory which has been developed, and which considers the earth as an\r\nextinct sun, as a star cooled down from its original heated condition,\r\nas a nebula, or luminous cloud, which has passed from the gaseous to the\r\nsolid state--this fine conception, which unites so brilliantly the\r\nkindred sciences of astronomy and geology, belongs to the French\r\nmathematician, Laplace, the immortal author of the “Mécanique Céleste.”\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of Laplace assigns to the sun, and to all bodies which\r\ngravitate in what Descartes calls his _tourbillon_, a common origin. “In\r\nthe primitive state in which we must suppose the sun to be,” he says,\r\n“it resembles one of those nebulæ which the telescope reveals to us,\r\nconsisting of a more or less brilliant central _nucleus_, surrounded by\r\nluminous clouds, which clouds, condensing at the surface, become\r\ntransformed into a star.”\r\n\r\nIt has been calculated that the centre of the earth has a temperature of\r\nabout 195,000° Cent., a degree of heat which surpasses all that the\r\nimagination can conceive. We can have no difficulty in admitting that,\r\nat a heat so excessive, all the substances which now enter into the\r\ncomposition of the globe would be reduced to the state of gas or vapour.\r\nOur planet, then, must have been originally an aggregation of aëriform\r\nfluids--a mass of matter entirely gaseous; and if we reflect that\r\nsubstances in their gaseous state occupy a volume eighteen hundred times\r\nlarger than when solid, we shall have some conception of the enormous\r\nvolume of this gaseous mass. It would be as large as the sun, which is\r\nfourteen hundred thousand times larger than the terrestrial sphere. In\r\nFig. 12 we have attempted to give an idea of the vast difference of\r\nvolume between the earth in its present solid state and in its primitive\r\ngaseous condition. One of the globes, A, represents the former, B the\r\nlatter. It is simply a comparison of size, which is made the more\r\nstrikingly apparent by means of these geometrical figures--one the\r\ntwentieth part of an inch in diameter, the other two inches and three\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VI.--The Earth circulating in space in the state of a\r\ngaseous star.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Comparative volume of the earth in the gaseous\r\nand solid state.]\r\n\r\nAt this excessive temperature the gaseous mass, which we have described,\r\nwould shine in space as the sun does at the present day; and with the\r\nsame brilliancy as that with which, to our eyes, the fixed stars and\r\nplanets shine in the serenity of night, as represented on the opposite\r\npage (PLATE VI.). Circulating round the sun in obedience to the laws of\r\nuniversal gravitation, this incandescent gaseous mass was necessarily\r\nregulated by the laws which govern other material substances. As it got\r\ncooler it gradually transferred part of its warmth to the glacial\r\nregions of the inter-planetary spaces, in the midst of which it traced\r\nthe line of its flaming orbit. Consequent on its continual cooling (but\r\nat the end of a period of time of which it would be impossible, even\r\napproximately, to fix the duration), the star, originally gaseous, would\r\nattain a liquid state. It would then be considerably diminished in\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\nThe laws of mechanics teach us that liquid bodies, when in a state of\r\nrotation, assume a spherical form; it is one of the laws of their being,\r\nemanating from the Creator, and is due to the force of attraction. Thus\r\nthe Earth takes the spheroidal form, belonging to it, in common with the\r\ngreater number of the celestial bodies.\r\n\r\nThe Earth is subject to two distinct movements; namely, a movement of\r\ntranslation round the sun, and a movement of rotation on its own\r\naxis--the latter a uniform movement, which produces the regular\r\nalternations of days and nights. Mechanics have also established the\r\nfact, which is confirmed by experiment, that a fluid mass in motion\r\nproduces (as the result of the variation of the centrifugal force on its\r\ndifferent diameters), a swelling towards the equatorial diameter of the\r\nsphere, and a flattening at the poles or extremities of its axis. It is\r\nin consequence of this law, that the Earth, when it was in a liquid\r\nstate, became swollen at the equator, and depressed at its two poles;\r\nand that it has passed from its primitive spherical form to the\r\nspheroidal--that is, has become flattened at each of its polar\r\nextremities, and has assumed its present shape of an oblate spheroid.\r\n\r\nThis bulging at the equator and flattening towards the poles afford the\r\nmost direct proofs, that can be adduced, of the original liquid state of\r\nour planet. A solid and non-elastic sphere--a stone ball, for\r\nexample--might turn for ages upon its axis, and its form would sustain\r\nno change; but a fluid ball, or one of a pasty consistence, would swell\r\nout towards the middle, and, in the same proportion, become flattened at\r\nthe extremities of its axis. It was upon this principle, namely, by\r\nadmitting the primitive fluidity of the globe, that Newton announced _à\r\npriori_ the bulging of the globe at the equator and its flattening at\r\nthe poles; and he even calculated the amount of this depression. The\r\nactual measurement, both of this expansion and flattening, by\r\nMaupertuis, Clairaut, Camus, and Lemonnier, in 1736, proved how exact\r\nthe calculations of the great geometrican were. Those gentlemen,\r\ntogether with the Abbé Outhier, were sent into Lapland by the Academy of\r\nSciences; the Swedish astronomer, Celsius, accompanied them, and\r\nfurnished them with the best instruments for measuring and surveying. At\r\nthe same time the Academy sent Bouguer and Condamine to the equatorial\r\nregions of South America. The measurements taken in both these regions\r\nestablished the existence of the equatorial expansion and the polar\r\ndepression, as Newton had estimated it to be in his calculations.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow, as a consequence of the partial cooling down of the\r\nterrestrial mass, that all the gaseous substances composing it should\r\npass into a liquid state; some of these might remain in the state of gas\r\nor vapour, and form round the terrestrial spheroid an outer envelope or\r\n_atmosphere_ (from the Greek words ατμος, _vapour_, and σφαιρα,\r\n_sphere_). But we should form a very inexact idea of the atmosphere\r\nwhich surrounded the globe, at this remote period, if we compared it\r\nwith that which surrounds it now. The extent of the gaseous matter which\r\nenveloped the primitive earth must have been immense; it doubtless\r\nextended to the moon. It included, in short, in the state of vapour, the\r\nenormous body of water which, as such, now constitutes our existing\r\nseas, added to all the other substances which preserve their gaseous\r\nstate at the temperature then exhibited by the incandescent earth; and\r\nit is certainly no exaggeration to place this temperature at 2,000°\r\nCentigrade. The atmosphere would participate in this temperature; and\r\nacted on by such excessive heat, the pressure that it would exert on the\r\nEarth would be infinitely greater than that which it exercises at the\r\npresent time. To the gases which form the component parts of the present\r\natmospheric air--namely, nitrogen, oxygen, and carbonic acid--to\r\nenormous masses of watery vapour, must be added vast quantities of\r\nmineral substances, metallic or earthy, reduced to a gaseous state, and\r\nmaintained in that state by the temperature of this gigantic furnace.\r\nThe metals, the chlorides--metallic, alkaline, and earthy--sulphur, the\r\nsulphides, and even the silicates of alumina and lime; all, at this\r\ntemperature, would exist in a vaporous form in the atmosphere\r\nsurrounding the primitive globe.\r\n\r\nIt is to be inferred that, under these circumstances, the different\r\nsubstances composing this atmosphere would be ranged round the globe in\r\nthe order of their respective densities; the first layer--that nearest\r\nto the surface of the globe--being formed of the heavier vapours, such\r\nas those of the metals, of iron, platinum, and copper, mixed doubtless\r\nwith clouds of fine metallic dust produced by the partial condensation\r\nof their vapours. This first and heaviest zone, and the thickest also,\r\nwould be quite opaque, although the surface of the earth was still at a\r\nred heat. Above it would come the more vaporisable substances, such as\r\nthe metallic and alkaline chlorides, particularly the chloride of sodium\r\nor common salt, sulphur and phosphorus, with all the volatile\r\ncombinations of these substances. The upper zone would contain matter\r\nstill more easily converted into vapour, such as water (steam), together\r\nwith others naturally gaseous, as oxygen, nitrogen, and carbonic acid.\r\nThis order of superposition, however, would not always be preserved. In\r\nspite of their differences of density, these three atmospheric layers\r\nwould often become mixed, producing formidable storms and violent\r\nebullitions; frequently throwing down, rending, upheaving, and\r\nconfounding these incandescent zones.\r\n\r\nAs to the globe itself, without being so much agitated as its hot and\r\nshifting atmosphere, it would be no less subject to perpetual tempests,\r\noccasioned by the thousand chemical actions which took place in its\r\nmolten mass. On the other hand, the electricity resulting from these\r\npowerful chemical actions, operating on such a vast scale, would induce\r\nfrightful electric detonations, thunder adding to the horror of this\r\nprimitive scene, which no imagination, no human pencil could trace, and\r\nwhich constitutes that gloomy and disastrous chaos of which the\r\nlegendary history of every ancient race has transmitted the tradition.\r\nIn this manner would our globe circulate in space, carrying in its train\r\nthe flaming streaks of its multiple atmosphere, unfitted, as yet, for\r\nliving beings, and impenetrable to the rays of the sun, around which it\r\ndescribed its vast orbit.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the planetary regions is infinitely low; according to\r\nLaplace it cannot be estimated at less than 100° below zero. The glacial\r\nregions traversed in its course by the incandescent globe would\r\nnecessarily cool it, at first superficially, when it would assume a\r\npasty consistence. It must not be forgotten that the earth, on account\r\nof its liquid state, would be obedient in all its mass to the action of\r\nflux and reflux, which proceeds from the attraction of the sun and moon,\r\nbut to which the sea alone is now subject. This action, to which all its\r\nliquid and movable particles were subject, would singularly accelerate\r\nthe commencement of the solidification of the terrestrial mass. It would\r\nthus gradually assume that sort of consistence which iron attains, when\r\nit is first withdrawn from the furnace, in the process of puddling.\r\n\r\nAs the earth cooled, beds of concrete substances would necessarily be\r\nformed, which, floating at first in isolated masses on the surface of\r\nthe semi-fluid matter, would in course of time come together,\r\nconsolidate, and form continuous banks; just as we see with the ice of\r\nthe present Polar Seas, which, when brought in contact by the agitation\r\nof the waves, coalesces and forms icebergs, more or less movable. By\r\nextending this phenomenon to the whole surface of the globe, the\r\nsolidification of its entire surface would be produced. A solid, but\r\nstill thin and fragile crust, would thus envelop the whole earth,\r\nenclosing entirely its still fluid interior. The entire consolidation\r\nwould necessarily be a much slower process--one which, according to the\r\nreceived hypothesis, is very far from being completed at the present\r\ntime; for it is estimated that the actual thickness of the earth’s crust\r\ndoes not exceed thirty miles, while the mean radius or distance from the\r\ncentre of the terrestrial sphere, approaches 4,000 miles, the mean\r\ndiameter being 7,912·409 miles; so that the portion of our planet,\r\nsupposed to be solidified, represents only a very small fraction of its\r\ntotal mass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Relative volumes of the solid crust and liquid\r\nmass of the globe.]\r\n\r\nWe say thirty miles, for such is the ordinary estimated thickness of the\r\nearth’s crust, usually admitted by savants; and the following is the\r\nprocess by which this result has been obtained.\r\n\r\nWe know that the temperature of the earth increases one degree\r\nCentigrade for every hundred feet of descent. This result has been\r\nborne out by a great number of measurements, made in many of the mines\r\nof France, in the tin mines of Cornwall, in the mines of the Erzgeberge,\r\nof the Ural, of Scotland, and, above all, in the soundings effected in\r\nthe Artesian wells of Grenelle and Passy, near Paris, of St. André de\r\nIregny, and at a great number of other points.\r\n\r\nThe greatest depth to which miners have hitherto penetrated is about 973\r\nyards, which has been reached in a boring executed in Monderf, in the\r\nGrand Duchy of Luxembourg. At Neusalzwerk, near Minden, in Prussia,\r\nanother boring has been carried to the depth of 760 yards. In the\r\ncoal-mines of Monkwearmouth the pits have been sunk 525 yards, and at\r\nDukinfield 717 yards. The mean of the thermometic observations made, at\r\nall these points, leads to the conclusion that the temperature increases\r\nabout one degree Fahrenheit for every sixty feet (English) of descent\r\nafter the first hundred.\r\n\r\nIn admitting that this law of temperature exists for all depths of the\r\nearth’s crust, we arrive at the conclusion that, at a depth of from\r\ntwenty-five to thirty-five miles--which is only about five times the\r\nheight of the highest mountains--the most refractory matter would be in\r\na state of fusion. According to M. Mitscherlich, the flame of hydrogen,\r\nburning in free air, acquires a temperature of 1,560° Centigrade. In\r\nthis flame platinum would be in a state of fusion. Granite melts at a\r\nlower temperature than soft iron, that is at about 1,300°; while silver\r\nmelts at 1,023°. In imagining an increase of temperature equal to one\r\ndegree for every hundred feet of descent, the temperature at twenty-five\r\nmiles will be 1,420° C. or 2,925° F.; thirty miles below the surface\r\nthere will be a probable temperature of 1,584° C. or 3,630° F.; it\r\nfollows, if these arguments be admitted, and the calculation correct,\r\nthat the thickness of the solid crust of the globe does not much exceed\r\nthirty miles.\r\n\r\nThis result, which gives to the terrestrial crust a thickness equal to\r\n1/190 of the earth’s diameter, has nothing, it is true, of absolute\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\nProf. W. Hopkins, F.R.S., an eminent mathematician, has much insisted\r\nupon the fact, that the conductibility of granite rocks, for heat, is\r\nmuch greater than that of sedimentary rocks; and he argues that in the\r\nlower stratum of the earth the temperature increases much more slowly\r\nthan it does nearer the surface. This consideration has led Mr. Hopkins\r\nto estimate the probable thickness of the earth’s solid crust at a\r\nminimum of 200 miles.\r\n\r\nIn support of this estimate Mr. Hopkins puts forward another argument,\r\nbased upon the precession of the equinoxes. We know that the terrestrial\r\naxis, instead of always preserving the same direction in space,\r\nrevolves in a cone round the pole of the ecliptic. Our globe, it is\r\ncalculated, will accomplish its revolution in about 25,000 years. In\r\nabout this period it will return to its original position. This\r\nbalancing, which has been compared to that of a top when about to cease\r\nspinning, produces the movement known as the _precession of the\r\nequinoxes_. It is due to the attraction which the sun and moon exercise\r\nupon the swelling equatorial of the globe. This attraction would act\r\nvery differently upon a globe entirely solid, and upon one with a liquid\r\ninterior, covered by a comparatively thin crust. Mr. Hopkins subjected\r\nthis curious problem to mathematical analysis, and he calculated that\r\nthe precession of the equinoxes, observed by astronomers, could only be\r\nexplained by admitting that the solid shell of the earth could not be\r\nless than from about 800 to 1,000 miles in thickness.\r\n\r\nIn his researches on the _rigidity of the earth_, Sir William Thomson\r\nfinds that the phenomena of precession and nutation require that the\r\nearth, if not solid to the core, must be nearly so; and that no\r\ncontinuous liquid vesicle at all approaching 6,000 miles in diameter can\r\npossibly exist in the earth’s interior, without rendering the phenomena\r\nin question very sensibly different from what they are.\r\n\r\nThe calculations of Mr. Hennessey are in direct opposition to those of\r\nSir William Thomson, and show that the earth’s crust cannot be less than\r\neighteen miles, or more than 600 miles in thickness.\r\n\r\nAdmitting, for the present, that the terrestrial crust is only thirty\r\nmiles in thickness, we can express in a familiar, but very intelligible\r\nfashion, the actual relation between the dimensions of the liquid\r\nnucleus and the solid crust of the earth. If we imagine the earth to be\r\nan orange, a tolerably thick sheet of paper applied to its surface will\r\nthen represent, approximately, the thickness of the solid crust which\r\nnow envelopes the globe. Fig. 13 will enable us to appreciate this fact\r\nstill more correctly. The terrestrial sphere having a mean diameter of\r\n7,912 miles, or a mean radius of 3,956 miles, and a solid crust about\r\nthirty miles thick, which is 1/260 of the diameter, or 1/130 of the\r\nradius, the engraving may be presumed to represent these proportions\r\nwith sufficient accuracy.\r\n\r\nTo determine, even approximately, the time such a vast body would take\r\nin cooling, so as to permit of the formation of a solid crust, or to fix\r\nthe duration of the transformations which we are describing, would be an\r\nimpossible task.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Formation of primitive granitic mountains.]\r\n\r\nThe first terrestrial crust formed, as indicated, would be incapable of\r\nresisting the waves of the ocean of internal fire, which would be\r\ndepressed and raised up at its daily flux and reflux in obedience to\r\nthe attraction of the sun and moon. Who can trace, even in imagination,\r\nthe fearful rendings, the gigantic inundations, which would result from\r\nthese movements! Who would dare to paint the sublime horrors of these\r\nfirst mysterious convulsions of the globe! Amid torrents of molten\r\nmatter, mixed with gases, upheaving and piercing the scarcely\r\nconsolidated crust, large crevices would be opened, and through these\r\ngaping cracks waves of liquid granite would be ejected, and then left to\r\ncool and consolidate on the surface. Fig. 14 represents the formation of\r\na primitive granitic mountain, by the eruption of the internal granitic\r\nmatter which forces its way to the surface through a fracture in the\r\ncrust. In some of these mountains, Ben Nevis for example, three\r\ndifferent stages of the eruption can be traced. “Ben Nevis, now the\r\nundoubted monarch of the Scottish mountains,” says Nicol, “shows well\r\nthe diverse age and relations of igneous rocks. The Great Moor from\r\nInverlochy and Fort William to the foot of the hill is gneiss. Breaking\r\nthrough, and partly resting on the gneiss is granite, forming the lower\r\ntwo-thirds of the mountain up to the small tarn on the shoulder of the\r\nhill. Higher still is the huge prism of porphyry, rising steep and\r\nrugged all around.” In this manner would the first mountains be formed.\r\nIn this way, also, might some metallic veins be ejected through the\r\nsmaller openings, true injections of eruptive matter produced from the\r\ninterior of the globe, traversing the primitive rocks and constituting\r\nthe precious depository of metals, such as copper, zinc, antimony, and\r\nlead. Fig. 15 represents the internal structure of some of these\r\nmetallic veins. In this case the fracture is only a fissure in the rock,\r\nwhich soon became filled with injected matter, often of different kinds,\r\nwhich in crystallising would completely fill the hollow of this cleft,\r\nor crack; but sometimes forming cavities or geodes as a result of the\r\ncontraction of the mass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Metallic veins.]\r\n\r\nBut some eruptions of granitic and other substances, ejected from the\r\ninterior, never reach the surface at all. In such cases the clefts and\r\ncrevices--longitudinal or oblique--are filled, but the fissures in the\r\ncrust do not themselves extend to the surface. Fig. 16 represents an\r\neruption of granite through a mass of sedimentary rock--the granite\r\nejected from the centre fills all the clefts and fractures, but it has\r\nnot been sufficiently powerful to force its way to the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--Eruption of granite.]\r\n\r\nOn the surface of the earth, then, which would be at first smooth and\r\nunbroken, there were formed, from the very beginning, swelling\r\neminences, hollows, foldings, corrugations, and crevices, which would\r\nmaterially alter its original aspect; its arid and burning surface\r\nbristled with rugged protuberances, or was traversed by enormous\r\nfissures and cracks. Nevertheless, as the globe continued to cool, a\r\ntime arrived when its temperature became insufficient to maintain, in a\r\nstate of vapour, the vast masses of water which floated in the\r\natmosphere. These vapours would pass into the liquid state, and then the\r\nfirst rain fell upon the earth. Let us here remark that these were\r\nveritable rains of boiling water; for in consequence of the very\r\nconsiderable pressure of the atmosphere, water would be condensed and\r\nbecome liquid at a temperature much above 100° Centigrade (212° Fahr.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VII.--Condensation and rainfall on the primitive globe.]\r\n\r\nThe first drop of water, which fell upon the still heated terrestrial\r\nsphere, marked a new period in its evolution--a period the mechanical\r\nand chemical effects of which it is important to analyse. The contact of\r\nthe condensed water with the consolidated surface of the globe opens up\r\na series of modifications of which science may undertake the examination\r\nwith a degree of confidence, or at least with more positive elements of\r\nappreciation than any we possess for the period of chaos; some of the\r\nfeatures of which we have attempted to represent, leaving of necessity\r\nmuch to the imagination, and for the reader to interpret after his own\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nThe first water which fell, in the liquid state, upon the slightly\r\ncooled surface of the earth would be rapidly converted into steam by the\r\nelevation of its temperature. Thus, rendered much lighter than the\r\nsurrounding atmosphere, these vapours would rise to the utmost limits of\r\nthe atmosphere, where they would become condensed afresh, in consequence\r\nof their radiation towards the glacial regions of space; condensing\r\nagain, they would re-descend to the earth in a liquid state, to\r\nre-ascend as vapour and fall in a state of condensation. But all these\r\nchanges, in the physical condition of the water, could only be\r\nmaintained by withdrawing a very considerable amount of heat from the\r\nsurface of the globe, whose cooling would be greatly hastened by these\r\ncontinual alternations of heat and cold; its heat would thus become\r\ngradually dissipated and lost in the regions of celestial space.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon extending itself by degrees to the whole mass of watery\r\nvapour existing in the atmosphere, the waters covered the earth in\r\nincreasing quantities; and as the conversion of all liquids into vapour\r\nis provocative of a notable disengagement of electricity, a vast\r\nquantity of electric fluid necessarily resulted from the conversion of\r\nsuch large masses of water into vapour. Bursts of thunder, and bright\r\nflashes of lightning were the necessary accompaniments of this\r\nextraordinary struggle of the elements--a state of things which M.\r\nMaurando has attempted to represent on the opposite page (PLATE VII.).\r\n\r\nHow long did this struggle for supremacy between fire and water, with\r\nthe incessant noise of thunder, continue? All that can be said in reply\r\nis, that a time came when water was triumphant. After having covered\r\nvast areas on the surface of the earth, it finally occupied and entirely\r\ncovered the whole surface; for there is good reason to believe that at a\r\ncertain epoch, at the commencement, so to speak, of its evolution; the\r\nearth was covered by water over its whole extent. The ocean was\r\nuniversal. From this moment our globe entered on a regular series of\r\nrevolutions, interrupted only by the outbreaks of the internal fires\r\nwhich were concealed beneath its still imperfectly consolidated crust.\r\n\r\n“At the early periods in which the materials of the ancient crystalline\r\nschists were accumulated, it cannot be doubted that the chemical\r\nprocesses which generated silicates were much more active than in more\r\nrecent times. The heat of the earth’s crust was probably then far\r\ngreater than at present, while a high temperature prevailed at\r\ncomparatively small depths, and thermal waters abounded. A denser\r\natmosphere, charged with carbonic acid gas, must also have contributed\r\nto maintain, at the earth’s surface, a greater degree of heat, though\r\none not incompatible with the existence of organic life.\r\n\r\n“These conditions must have favoured many chemical processes, which in\r\nlater times have nearly ceased to operate. Hence we find that\r\nsubsequently to the eozoic times, silicated rocks of clearly marked\r\nchemical origin are comparatively rare.”[32]\r\n\r\n  [32] “Address to the American Association for the Advancement of\r\n       Science,” by Thomas Sterry Hunt, LL.D., p. 56. 1871.\r\n\r\nIn order to comprehend the complex action, now mechanical, now chemical,\r\nwhich the waters, still in a heated state, exercised on the solid crust,\r\nlet us consider what were the components of this crust. The rocks which\r\nformed its first _stratum_--the framework of the earth, the foundation\r\nupon which all others repose--may be presumed to have been a compound\r\nwhich, in varying proportions, forms granite and gneiss, and has\r\nlatterly been designated by geologists Laurentian.\r\n\r\nWhat is this gneiss, this granite, speaking of it with reference to its\r\nmineralogical character? It is a combination of silicates, with a base\r\nof alumina, potash, soda, and sometimes lime--_quartz_, _felspar_, and\r\n_mica_ form, by their simple aggregation, _granite_--it is thus a\r\nternary combination, or composed of three minerals.\r\n\r\n_Quartz_, the most abundant of all minerals, is silica more or less pure\r\nand often crystallised. _Felspar_ is a crystalline or crystallised\r\nmineral, composed of _silicate_ of alumina, potash, soda, or lime;\r\npotash-felspar is called _orthoclase_, soda-felspar _albite_,\r\nlime-felspar _anorthite_. _Mica_ is a silicate of alumina and potash,\r\ncontaining magnesia and oxide of iron; it takes its name from the Latin\r\n_micare_, to shine or glitter.\r\n\r\n_Granite_ (from the Italian _grano_, being granular in its structure)\r\nis, then, a compound rock, formed of felspar, quartz, and mica, and the\r\nthree constituent minerals are more or less crystalline. _Gneiss_ is a\r\nschistose variety of granite, and composed of the same minerals; the\r\nonly difference between the two rocks (whatever may be their difference\r\nof origin) being that the constituent minerals, instead of being\r\nconfusedly aggregated, as in granite, assume a foliated texture in\r\ngneiss. This foliated structure leads sometimes to gneiss being called\r\n_stratified granite_. “The term gneiss originated with the Freiberg\r\nminers, who from ancient times have used it to designate the rock in\r\nwhich their veins of silver-ore were found.”[33]\r\n\r\n  [33] Cotta’s “Rocks Classified and Described,” by P. H. Lawrence, p.\r\n       232.\r\n\r\nThe felspar, which enters into the composition of granite, is a mineral\r\nthat is easily decomposed by water, either cold or boiling, or by the\r\nwater of springs rich in carbonic acid. The chemical action of carbonic\r\nacid and water, and the action (at once chemical and mechanical) of the\r\nhot water in the primitive seas, powerfully modified the granitic rocks\r\nwhich lay beneath them. The warm rains which fell upon the\r\nmountain-peaks and granitic pinnacles, the torrents of rain which fell\r\nupon the slopes or in the valleys, dissolved the several alkaline\r\nsilicates which constitute felspar and mica, and swept them away to form\r\nelsewhere strata of clay and sand; thus were the first modifications in\r\nthe primitive rocks produced by the united action of air and water, and\r\nthus were the first sedimentary rocks deposited from the oceanic waters.\r\n\r\nThe argillaceous deposits produced by this decomposition of the\r\nfelspathic and micaceous rocks would participate in the still heated\r\ntemperature of the globe--would be again subjected to long continued\r\nheat; and when they became cool again, they would assume, by a kind of\r\nsemi-crystallisation, that parallel structure which is called foliation.\r\nAll foliated rocks, then, are metamorphic, and the result of a\r\nmetamorphic action to which sedimentary strata (and even some eruptive\r\nrocks) have been subjected subsequently to their deposition and\r\nconsolidation, and which has produced a re-arrangement of their\r\ncomponent mineral particles, and frequently, if not always, of their\r\nchemical elements also.\r\n\r\nIn this manner would the first beds of crystalline _schist_, such as\r\nmica-schist, be formed, probably out of sandy and clayey muds, or\r\narenaceous and argillaceous shales.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this first phase of its existence, the terrestrial globe\r\nwas, then, covered, over nearly its whole surface, with hot and muddy\r\nwater, forming extensive but shallow seas. A few islands, raising their\r\ngranitic peaks here and there, would form a sort of archipelago,\r\nsurrounded by seas filled with earthy matter in suspension. During a\r\nlong series of ages the solid crust of the globe went on increasing in\r\nthickness, as the process of solidification of the underlying liquid\r\nmatter nearest to the surface proceeded. This state of tranquillity\r\ncould not last long. The solid portion of the globe had not yet attained\r\nsufficient consistency to resist the pressure of the gases and boiling\r\nliquids which it covered and compressed with its elastic crust. The\r\nwaves of this internal sea triumphed, more than once, over the feeble\r\nresistances which were opposed to it, making enormous dislocations and\r\nbreaches in the ground--immense upheavals of the solid crust raising the\r\nbeds of the seas far above their previous levels--and thus mountains\r\narose out of the ocean, not now exclusively granitic, but composed,\r\nbesides, of those schistose rocks which have been deposited under water,\r\nafter long suspension in the muddy seas.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the Earth, as it continued to cool, would also\r\ncontract; and this process of contraction, as we have already explained,\r\nwas another cause of dislocation at the surface, producing either\r\nconsiderable ruptures or simple fissures in the continuity of the crust.\r\nThese fissures would be filled, at a subsequent period, by jets of the\r\nmolten matter occupying the interior of the globe--by _eruptive\r\ngranite_, that is to say--or by various mineral compounds; they also\r\nopened a passage to those torrents of heated water charged with mineral\r\nsalts, with silica, the bicarbonates of lime and magnesia, which,\r\nmingling with the waters of the vast primitive ocean, were deposited at\r\nthe bottom of the seas, thus helping to increase the mass of the mineral\r\nsubstances composing the solid portion of the globe.\r\n\r\nThese eruptions of granitic or metallic matter--these vast discharges of\r\nmineral waters through the fractured surface--would be of frequent\r\noccurrence during the primitive epoch we are contemplating. It should\r\nnot, therefore, be a matter for surprise to find the more ancient rocks\r\nalmost always fractured, reduced in dimensions by faults and\r\ncontortions, and often traversed by veins containing metals or their\r\noxides, such as the oxides of copper and tin; or their sulphides, such\r\nas those of lead, of antimony, or of iron--which are now the object of\r\nthe miner’s art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIMARY EPOCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the terrible tempests of the primitive period--after these great\r\ndisturbances of the mineral kingdom--Nature would seem to have gathered\r\nherself together, in sublime silence, in order to proceed to the grand\r\nmystery of the creation of living beings.\r\n\r\nDuring the primitive epoch the temperature of the earth was too high to\r\nadmit the appearance of life on its surface. The darkness of thickest\r\nnight shrouded this cradle of the world; the atmosphere probably was so\r\ncharged with vapours of various kinds, that the sun’s rays were\r\npowerless to pierce its opacity. Upon this heated surface, and in this\r\nperpetual night, organic life could not manifest itself. No plant, no\r\nanimal, then, could exist upon the silent earth. In the seas of this\r\nepoch, therefore, only unfossiliferous strata were deposited.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, our planet continued to be subjected to a gradual\r\nrefrigeration on the one hand, and, on the other, continuous rains were\r\npurifying its atmosphere. From this time, then, the sun’s rays, being\r\nless obscured, could reach its surface, and, under their beneficent\r\ninfluence, life was not slow in disclosing itself. “Without light,” said\r\nthe illustrious Lavoisier, “Nature was without life; it was dead and\r\ninanimate. A benevolent God, in bestowing light, has spread on the\r\nsurface of the earth organisation, sentiment, and thought.” We begin,\r\naccordingly, to see upon the earth--the temperature of which was nearly\r\nthat of our equatorial zone--a few plants and a few animals make their\r\nappearance. These first generations of life will be replaced by others\r\nof a higher organisation, until at the last stage of the creation, man,\r\nendowed with the supreme attribute which we call intelligence, will\r\nappear upon the earth. “The word _progress_, which we think peculiar to\r\nhumanity, and even to modern times,” said Albert Gaudry, in a lecture on\r\nthe animals of the ancient world, delivered in 1863, “was pronounced by\r\nthe Deity on the day when he created the first living organism.”\r\n\r\nDid plants precede animals? We know not; but such would appear to have\r\nbeen the order of creation. It is certain that in the sediment of the\r\noldest seas, and in the vestiges which remain to us of the earliest ages\r\nof organic life on the globe, that is to say, in the argillaceous\r\nschists, we find both plants and animals of advanced organisation. But,\r\non the other hand, during the greater part of the primary\r\nepoch--especially during the Carboniferous age--the plants are\r\nparticularly numerous, and terrestrial animals scarcely show themselves;\r\nthis would lead us to the conclusion that plants preceded animals. It\r\nmay be remarked, besides, that from their cellular nature, and their\r\nlooser tissues composed of elements readily affected by the air, the\r\nfirst plants could be easily destroyed without leaving any material\r\nvestiges; from which it may be concluded, that, in those primitive\r\ntimes, an immense number of plants existed, no traces of which now\r\nremain to us.\r\n\r\nWe have stated that, during the earlier ages of our globe, the waters\r\ncovered a great part of its surface; and it is in them that we find the\r\nfirst appearance of life. When the waters had become sufficiently cool\r\nto allow of the existence of organised beings, creation was developed,\r\nand advanced with great energy; for it manifested itself by the\r\nappearance of numerous and very different species of animals and plants.\r\n\r\nOne of the most ancient groups of organic remains are the Brachiopoda, a\r\ngroup of Mollusca, particularly typified by the genus Lingula, a species\r\nof which still exist in the present seas; the Trilobites (Fig. 17), a\r\nfamily of Crustaceans, especially characteristic of this period; then\r\ncome Productas, Terebratulæ, and Orthoceratites--other genera of\r\nMollusca. The Corals, which appeared at an early period, seem to have\r\nlived in all ages, and survive to the present day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--Paradoxides Bohemicus--Bohemia.]\r\n\r\nContemporaneously with these animals, plants of inferior organisation\r\nhave left their impressions upon the schists; these are Algæ (aquatic\r\nplants, Fig. 28). As the continents enlarged, plants of a higher type\r\nmade their appearance--the Equisetaceæ, herbaceous Ferns, and other\r\nplants. These we shall have occasion to specify when noticing the\r\nperiods which constitute the Primary Epoch, and which consists of the\r\nfollowing periods: the Carboniferous, the Old Red Sandstone, and\r\nDevonian, the Silurian, and the Cambrian.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRIAN PERIOD.\r\n\r\nThe researches of geologists have discovered but scanty traces of\r\norganic remains in the rocks which form the base of this system in\r\nEngland. _Arenicolites_, or worm-tracks and burrows, have been found in\r\nShropshire, by Mr. Salter, to occur in countless numbers through a mile\r\nof thickness in the Longmynd rocks; and others were discovered by the\r\nlate Dr. Kinahan in Wicklow. In Ireland, in the picturesque tract of\r\nBray Head, on the south and east coasts of Dublin, we find, in slaty\r\nbeds of the same age as the Longmynd rocks, a peculiar zoophyte, which\r\nhas been named by Edward Forbes _Oldhamia_, after its discoverer, Dr.\r\nOldham, Superintendent of the Geological Survey of India. This fossil\r\nrepresents one of the earliest inhabitants of the ocean, which then\r\ncovered the greater part of the British Isles. “In the hard, purplish,\r\nand schistose rocks of Bray Head,” says Dr. Kinahan,[34] “as well as\r\nother parts of Ireland which are recognised as Cambrian rocks, markings\r\nof a very peculiar character are found. They occur in masses, and are\r\nrecognised as hydrozoic animal assemblages. They have regularity of\r\nform, abundant, but not universal, occurrence in beds, and permanence of\r\ncharacter even when the beds are at a distance from each other, and\r\ndissimilar in chemical and physical character.” In the course of his\r\ninvestigations, Dr. Kinahan discovered at least four species of\r\nOldhamia, which he has described and figured.\r\n\r\n  [34] Trans. Roy. Irish Acad., vol. xxiii., p. 556.\r\n\r\nThe Cambrian rocks consist of the Llanberis slates of Llanberis and\r\nPenrhyn in North Wales, which, with their associated sandy strata,\r\nattain a thickness of about 3,000 feet, and the Barmouth and Harlech\r\nSandstones. In the Longmynd hills of Shropshire these last beds attain a\r\nthickness of 6,000 feet; and in some parts of Merionethshire they are of\r\nstill greater thickness.\r\n\r\nNeither in North Wales, nor in the Longmynd, do the Cambrian rocks\r\nafford any indications of life, except annelide-tracks and burrows. From\r\nthis circumstance, together with general absence of Mollusca in these\r\nstrata, and the sudden appearance of numerous shells and trilobites in\r\nthe succeeding Lingula Flags, a change of conditions seems to have\r\nensued at the close of the Cambrian period.\r\n\r\nBelieving that the red colour of rocks is frequently connected with\r\ntheir deposition in inland waters, Professor Ramsay conceives it to be\r\npossible, that the absence of marine mollusca in the Cambrian rocks may\r\nbe due to the same cause that produced their absence in the Old Red\r\nSandstone, and that the presence of sun-cracks and rain-pittings in the\r\nLongmynd beds is a corroboration of this suggestion.[35]\r\n\r\n  [35] “On the Red Rocks of England,” by A.

The term “Silurian”\r\nwas given by the illustrious Murchison to the epoch which now occupies\r\nour attention, because the system of rocks formed by the marine\r\nsediments, during the period in question, form large tracts of country\r\nin Shropshire and Wales, a region formerly peopled by the _Silures_, a\r\nCeltic race who fought gloriously against the Romans, under Caractacus\r\nor Caradoc, the British king of those tracts. The reader may find the\r\nnomenclature strange, as applied to the vast range of rocks which it\r\nrepresents in all parts of the Old and New World, but it indicates, with\r\nsufficient exactness, the particular region in our own country in which\r\nthe system typically prevails--reasons which led to the term being\r\nadopted, even at a time when its vast geographical extent was not\r\nsuspected.\r\n\r\nOn this subject, and on the principles which have guided geologists in\r\ntheir classification of rocks, Professor Sedgwick remarks in one of his\r\npapers in the _Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society_: “In every\r\ncountry,” he says,[36] “which is not made out by reference to a\r\npre-existing type, our first labour is that of determining the physical\r\ngroups, and establishing their relations by natural sections. The labour\r\nnext in order is the determination of the fossils found in the\r\nsuccessive physical groups; and, as a matter of fact, the natural groups\r\nof fossils are generally found to be nearly co-ordinate with the\r\nphysical groups--each successive group resulting from certain conditions\r\nwhich have modified the distribution of organic types. In the third\r\nplace comes the collective arrangement of the groups into systems, or\r\ngroups of a higher order. The establishment of the Silurian system is an\r\nadmirable example of this whole process. The groups called Caradoc,\r\nWenlock, Ludlow, &c., were physical groups determined by good natural\r\nsections. The successive groups of fossils were determined by the\r\nsections; and the sections, as the representatives of physical groups,\r\nwere hardly at all modified by any consideration of the fossils, for\r\nthese two distinct views of the natural history of such groups led to\r\nco-ordinate results. Then followed the collective view of the whole\r\nseries, and the establishment of a nomenclature. Not only the whole\r\nseries (considered as a distinct system), but every subordinate group\r\nwas defined by a geographical name, referring us to a local type within\r\nthe limits of Siluria; in this respect adopting the principle of\r\ngrouping and nomenclature applied by W. Smith to our secondary rocks. At\r\nthe same time, the older slate rocks of Wales (inferior to the system of\r\nSiluria), were called _Cambrian_, and soon afterwards the next great\r\ncollective group of rocks (superior to the system of Siluria) was called\r\n_Devonian_. In this way was established a perfect congruity of language.\r\nIt was geographical in principle, and it represented the actual\r\ndevelopment of all our older rocks, which gave to it its true value and\r\nmeaning.” The period, then, for the purposes of scientific description,\r\nmay be divided into three sub-periods--the Upper and Lower Silurian, and\r\nthe Cambrian.\r\n\r\n  [36] _Quart.

(Buckland.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--_a_, Side view of the left eye of the above,\r\nmagnified, (Buckland.) _b_, Magnified view of a portion of the eye of\r\nCalymene macrophthalmus. (Hœninghaus.)]\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of the Silurian period, of which we give an ideal\r\nview opposite (PLATE VIII.), are supposed to have been shallow seas of\r\ngreat extent, with barren submarine reefs and isolated rocks rising here\r\nand there out of the water, covered with Algæ, and frequented by various\r\nMollusca and articulated animals. The earliest traces of vegetation\r\nbelong to the _Thallogens_, flowerless plants of the class Algæ (Fig.\r\n28), without leaves or stems, which are found among the Lower Silurian\r\nrocks. To these succeed other plants, according to Dr. Hooker, belonging\r\nto the Lycopodiaceæ (Fig. 28), the seeds of which are found sparingly in\r\nthe Upper Ludlow beds. Among animals, the _Orthoceratites_ led a\r\npredacious life in the Silurian seas. Their organisation indicates that\r\nthey preyed upon other animals, pursuing them into the deepest abysses,\r\nand strangling them in the embrace of their long arms. The _Trilobites_,\r\na remarkable group of Crustacea, possessing simple and reticulated\r\ncompound eyes, also highly characterise this period (Figs. 17 to 20);\r\npresenting at one period or other of their existence 1,677 species, 224\r\nof which are met with in Great Britain and Ireland, as we are taught by\r\nthe “Thesaurus Siluricus.”[37] Add to this a sun, struggling to\r\npenetrate the dense atmosphere of the primitive world, and yielding a\r\ndim and imperfect light to the first created beings as they left the\r\nhand of the Creator, organisms often rudimentary, but at other times\r\nsufficiently advanced to indicate a progress towards more perfect\r\ncreations. Such is the picture which the artist has attempted to\r\nportray.\r\n\r\n  [37] “The Flora and Fauna of the Silurian Period,” by John T. Bigsby,\r\n       M.A., F.G.S. 4to, 1868.\r\n\r\nThe elaborate and highly valuable “Thesaurus Siluricus” contains the\r\nnames of 8,997 species of fossil remains, but it probably does not tell\r\nus of one-tenth part of the Silurian life still lying buried in rocks of\r\nthat age in various parts of the world. A rich field is here offered to\r\nthe geological explorer.[38]\r\n\r\n  [38] Ibid, p. vi.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOWER SILURIAN.\r\n\r\nThe Silurian rocks have been estimated by Sir Roderick Murchison to\r\noccupy, altogether, an area of about 7,600 square miles in England and\r\nWales, 18,420 square miles in Scotland, and nearly 7,000 square miles in\r\nIreland. Thus, as regards the British Isles, the Silurian rocks rise to\r\nthe surface over nearly 33,000 square miles.\r\n\r\nThe Silurian rocks have been traced from Cumberland to the Land’s End,\r\nat the southern extremity of England. They lie at the base of the\r\nsouthern Highlands of Scotland, from the North Channel to the North Sea,\r\nand they range along the entire western coast of that country. In a\r\nwesterly direction they extended to the sea, where the mountains of\r\nWales--the Alps of the great chain--would stand out in bold relief, some\r\nof them facing the sea, others in detached groups; some clothed with a\r\nstunted vegetation, others naked and desolate; all of them wild and\r\npicturesque. But an interest surpassing all others belongs to these\r\nmountains. They are amongst the most ancient sedimentary rocks which\r\nexist on our globe, a page of the book in which is written the history\r\nof the antiquities of Great Britain--in fine, of the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20. Ogygia Guettardi. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nIn Shropshire and Wales three zones of Silurian life have been\r\nestablished. In rocks of three different ages _Graptolites_ have left\r\nthe trace of their existence. Another fossil characteristic of these\r\nancient rocks is the _Lingula_. This shell is horny or slightly\r\ncalcareous, which has probably been one cause of its preservation. The\r\nfamily to which the Lingula belongs is so abundant in the rocks of the\r\nWelsh mountains, that Sir R. Murchison has used it to designate a\r\ngeological era. These Lingula-flags mark the beginning of the first\r\nSilurian strata.\r\n\r\nIn the Lower Llandovery beds, which mark the close of the period, other\r\nfossils present themselves, thus greatly augmenting the forms of life in\r\nthe Lower Silurian rocks. These are cœlenterata, articulata, and\r\nmollusca. They mark, however, only a very ephemeral passage over the\r\nglobe, and soon disappear altogether.\r\n\r\nThe vertebrated animals are only represented by rare Fishes, and it is\r\nonly on reaching the Upper Ludlow rocks, and specially in those beds\r\nwhich pass upward into the Old Red Sandstone, that the remains have been\r\nfound of fishes--the most ancient beings of their class.\r\n\r\nThe class of Crustaceans, of which the lobster, shrimp, and the crab of\r\nour days are the representatives, was that which predominated in this\r\nepoch of animal life. Their forms were most singular, and different from\r\nthose of all existing Crustaceans. They consisted mainly of the\r\n_Trilobites_, a family which became entirely extinct at the close of the\r\nCarboniferous epoch, but in whose nicely-jointed shell the armourer of\r\nthe middle ages might have found all his contrivances anticipated, with\r\nnot a few besides which he has failed to discover. The head presents, in\r\ngeneral, the form of an oval buckler; the body is composed of a series\r\nof articulations, or rings, as represented in Fig. 20; the anterior\r\nportion carrying the eyes, which in some are reticulated, like those of\r\nmany insects (Figs. 18 and 19); the mouth was placed forward and beneath\r\nthe head. Many of these Crustaceans could roll themselves into balls,\r\nlike the wood-louse (Figs. 23 and 25). They swam on their backs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--Lituites cornu-arietis. One-third natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Hemicosmites pyriformis. One-third natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nDuring the middle and later Silurian ages, whole rocks were formed\r\nalmost exclusively of their remains; during the Devonian period they\r\nseem to have gradually died out, almost disappearing in the\r\nCarboniferous age, and being only represented by one doubtful species in\r\nthe Permian rocks of North America. The Trilobites are unique as a\r\nfamily, marking with certainty the rocks in which they occur; “and yet,”\r\nsays Hugh Miller, “how admirably do they exhibit the articulated type of\r\nbeing, and illustrate that unity of design which pervades all Nature,\r\namid its endless diversity!” Among other beings which have left their\r\ntraces in the Silurian strata is _Nereites Cambriensis_, a species of\r\nannelide, whose articulations are very distinctly marked in the ancient\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nBesides the Trilobites, many orders of Mollusca were numerously\r\nrepresented in the Silurian seas. As Sir R. Murchison has observed, no\r\nzoological feature in the Upper Silurian rocks is more striking than the\r\ngreat increase and profusion of Cephalopods, many of them of great size,\r\nwhich appear in strata of the age immediately antecedent to the dawn of\r\nvertebrated life. Among the Cephalopods we have _Gyroceras_ and\r\n_Lituites cornu-arietis_ (Fig. 21), whose living representatives are the\r\nNautilus and Cuttlefish of every sea. The genus _Bellerophon_ (Figs. 54\r\nand 56), with many others, represented the Gasteropods, and like the\r\nliving carinaria sailed freely over the sea by means of its fleshy\r\nparts. The Gasteropods, with the Lamellibranchs, of which the Oyster is\r\na living type, and the Brachiopods, whose congeners may still be\r\ndetected in the _Terebratula_ of our Highland lochs and bays, and the\r\n_Lingulæ_ of the southern hemisphere, were all then represented. The\r\nLamellibranchiata are without a head, and almost entirely destitute of\r\npower of locomotion. Among the Echinodermata we may cite the\r\n_Hemiscosmites_, of which _H. pyriformis_ (Fig. 22) may be considered an\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of the Lower Silurian age in France are found in Languedoc, in\r\nthe environs of Neffiez and of Bédarrieux. They occupy, also, great part\r\nof Brittany. They occur in Bohemia, also in Spain, Russia, and in the\r\nNew World. Limestones, sandstones, and schists (slates of Angers) form\r\nthe chief part of this series. The Cambrian slates are largely\r\nrepresented in Canada and the United States.\r\n\r\n                          LOWER SILURIAN GROUP.\r\n\r\n  Formation.          Prevailing Rocks.

Among others, _Calymene\r\nBlumenbachii_ (Fig. 23), some _Cephalopoda_, and _Brachiopoda_, among\r\nwhich last may be named _Pentamerus Knightii_, _Orthis_, &c., and some\r\nCorals, as _Halysites catenularius_ (Fig. 26), or the chain coral.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--Calymene Blumenbachii partially rolled up.]\r\n\r\nThe Trilobites, we have already said, were able to coil themselves into\r\na ball, like the wood-louse, doubtless as a means of defence. In Fig.\r\n23, one of these creatures, _Calymene Blumenbachii_, is represented in\r\nthat form, coiled upon itself. (See also _Illænus Barriensis_, Fig. 25.)\r\n\r\nCrustaceans of a very strange form, and in no respects resembling the\r\nTrilobites, have been met with in the Silurian rocks of England and\r\nAmerica--the _Pterygotus_ (Fig. 27) and the _Eurypterus_, (Fig. 24).\r\nThey are supposed to have been the inhabitants of fresh water. They were\r\ncalled “Seraphim” by the Scotch quarrymen, from the winged form and\r\nfeather-like ornamentation upon the thoracic appendage, the part most\r\nusually met with. Agassiz figured them in his work on the ‘Fossil\r\nFishes of the Old Red Sandstone,’ but, subsequently recognising their\r\ncrustacean character, removed them from the Class of Fishes, and placed\r\nthem with the _Pœcilipod Crustacea_. The _Eurypteridæ_ and _Pterygoti_\r\nin England almost exclusively belong to the passage beds--the Downton\r\nsandstone and the Upper Ludlow rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.--Eurypterus remipes. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nAmong the marine plants which have been found in the rocks corresponding\r\nwith this sub-period are some species of Algæ, and others belonging to\r\nthe Lycopodiaceæ, which become still more abundant in the Old Red\r\nSandstone and Carboniferous Periods. Fig. 28 represents some examples of\r\nthe impressions they have left.\r\n\r\nThe seas were, evidently, abundantly inhabited at the end of the Upper\r\nSilurian period, for naturalists have examined nearly 1,500 species\r\nbelonging to these beds, and the number of British species, classified\r\nand arranged for public inspection in our museums cannot be much short\r\nof that number.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.--Illænus Barriensis.--Dudley, Walsall.]\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the Upper Silurian sub-period, the argillaceous\r\nbeds pass upwards into more sandy and shore-like deposits, in which the\r\nmost ancient known fossil Fishes occur, and then usher us into the first\r\ngreat ichthyic period of the Old Red Sandstone, or Devonian, so well\r\nmarked by its fossil fishes in Britain, Russia, and North America. The\r\nso-called fish-bones have been the subject of considerable doubt.\r\nBetween the Upper Ludlow rocks opposite Downton Castle and the next\r\noverlying stratum, there occurs a thin bed of soft earthy shale, and\r\nfine, soft, yellowish greenstone, immediately overlying the Ludlow rock:\r\njust below this a remarkable fish-deposit occurs, called the Ludlow\r\nbone-bed, because the bones of animals are found in this stratum in\r\ngreat quantities. Old Drayton treats these bones as a great marvel:--\r\n\r\n                    “With strange and sundry tales\r\n    Of all their wondrous things; and not the least in Wales,\r\n    Of that prodigious spring (him neighbouring as he past),\r\n    That little fishes’ bones continually doth cast.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLYOLBION.\r\n\r\nAbove the yellow beds, or Downton sandstone, as they are called, organic\r\nremains are extensively diffused through the argillaceous strata, which\r\nhave yielded fragments of fishes’ bones (being the earliest trace yet\r\nfound of vertebrate life), with seeds and land-plants, the latter\r\nclearly indicating the neighbourhood of land, and the poverty of\r\nnumbers and the small size of the shells, a change of condition in the\r\nnature of the waters in which they lived. “It was the central part\r\nonly,” says Sir R. Murchison, “of this band, or a ginger-bread-coloured\r\nlayer of a thickness of three or four inches, and dwindling away to a\r\nquarter of an inch, exhibiting, when my attention was first directed to\r\nit, a matted mass of bony fragments, for the most part of small size and\r\nof very peculiar character. Some of the fragments of fish are of a\r\nmahogany hue, but others of so brilliant a black that when first\r\ndiscovered they conveyed the impression that the bed was a heap of\r\nbroken beetles.”[39]\r\n\r\n  [39] “Siluria,” p. 148.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.--Halysites catenularius.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.--Pterygotus bilobatus.]\r\n\r\nThe fragments thus discovered were, after examination on the spot,\r\nsupposed to be those of fishes, but, upon further investigation, many of\r\nthem were found to belong to Crustaceans. The ichthyic nature of some of\r\nthem is, however, now well established.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.--Plants of the Palæozoic Epoch.--1 and 2, Algæ;\r\n3 and 4, Lycopods.]\r\n\r\nSilurian Rocks are found in France in the departments of La Manche,\r\nCalvados, and of the Sarthe, and in Languedoc the Silurian formation has\r\noccupied the attention of Messrs. Graff and Fournet, who have traced\r\nalong the base of the Espinouse, the green, primordial chlorite-schists,\r\nsurmounted by clay-slates, which become more and more pure as the\r\ndistance from the masses of granite and gneiss increases, and the valley\r\nof the Jour is approached. Upon these last the Silurian system rests,\r\nsinking towards the plain under Secondary and Tertiary formations. In\r\nGreat Britain, Silurian strata are found enormously developed in the\r\nWest and South Highlands of Scotland, on the western slopes of the\r\nPennine chain and the mountains of Wales, and in the adjoining counties\r\nof Shropshire--their most typical region--and Worcestershire. In Spain;\r\nin Germany (on the banks of the Rhine); in Bohemia--where, also, they\r\nare largely developed, especially in the neighbourhood of Prague--in\r\nSweden, where they compose the entire island of Gothland; in Norway; in\r\nRussia, especially in the Ural Mountains; and in America, in the\r\nneighbourhood of New York, and half way across the continent--in all\r\nthese countries they are more or less developed.\r\n\r\nWe may add, as a general characteristic of the Silurian system as a\r\nwhole, that of all formations it is the most disturbed. In the countries\r\nwhere it prevails, it only appears as fragments which have escaped\r\ndestruction amid the numerous changes that have affected it during the\r\nearlier ages of the world. The beds, originally horizontal, are turned\r\nup, contorted, folded over, and sometimes become even vertical, as in\r\nthe slates of Angers, Llanberis, and Ireleth. D’Orbigny found the\r\nSilurian beds with their fossils in the American Andes, at the height of\r\n16,000 feet above the level of the sea. What vast upheavals must have\r\nbeen necessary to elevate these fossils to such a height!\r\n\r\nIn the Silurian period the sea still occupied the earth almost entirely;\r\nit covered the greater part of Europe: all the area comprised between\r\nSpain and the Ural was under water. In France only two islands had\r\nemerged from the primordial ocean. One of them was formed of the\r\ngranitic rocks of what are now Brittany and La Vendée; the other\r\nconstituted the great central plateau, and consisted of the same rocks.\r\nThe northern parts of Norway, Sweden, and of Russian Lapland formed a\r\nvast continental surface. In America the emerged lands were more\r\nextensive. In North America an island extended over eighteen degrees of\r\nlatitude, in the part now called New Britain. In South America, in the\r\nPacific, Chili formed one elongated island. Upon the Atlantic, a portion\r\nof Brazil, to the extent of twenty degrees of latitude, was raised above\r\nwater. Finally, in the equatorial regions, Guiana formed a later island\r\nin the vast ocean which still covered most other parts of the New World.\r\n\r\nThere is, perhaps, no scene of greater geological confusion than that\r\npresented by the western flanks of the Pennine chain. A line drawn\r\nlongitudinally from about three degrees west of Greenwich, would include\r\non its western side Cross Fell, in Cumberland, and the greater part of\r\nthe Silurian rocks belonging to the Cambrian system, in which the\r\nCambrian and Lower Silurian rocks are now well determined; while the\r\nupper series are so metamorphosed by eruptive granite and the effects of\r\ndenudation, as to be scarcely recognisable. “With the rare exception of\r\na seaweed and a zoophyte,” says the author of ‘Siluria,’ “not a trace of\r\na fossil has been detected in the thousands of feet of strata, with\r\ninterpolated igneous matter, which intervene between the slates of\r\nSkiddaw and the Coniston limestone, with its overlying flags; at that\r\nzone only do we begin to find anything like a fauna: here, judging from\r\nits fossils, we find representations of the Caradoc and Bala rocks.”\r\nThis much-disturbed district Professor Sedgwick, after several years\r\ndevoted to its study, has attempted to reconstruct, the following being\r\na brief summary of his arguments. The region consists of:--\r\n\r\nI. Beds of mudstone and sandstone, deposited in an ancient sea,\r\napparently without the calcareous matter necessary to the existence of\r\nshells and corals, and with numerous traces of organic forms of Silurian\r\nage--these were the elements of the Skiddaw slates.\r\n\r\nII. Plutonic rocks were, for many ages, poured out among the aqueous\r\nsedimentary deposits; the beds were broken up and re-cemented--plutonic\r\nsilt and other finely comminuted matter were deposited along with the\r\nigneous rocks: the process was again and again repeated, till a deep sea\r\nwas filled up with a formation many thousands of feet thick by the\r\nmaterials forming the middle Cambrian rocks.\r\n\r\nIII. A period of comparative repose followed. Beds of shells and bands\r\nof coral were formed upon the more ancient rocks, interrupted with beds\r\nof sand and mud; processes many times repeated: and thus, in a long\r\nsuccession of ages, were the deposits of the upper series completed.\r\n\r\nIV. Towards the end of the period, mountain-masses and eruptive rocks\r\nwere pushed up through the older deposits. After many revolutions, all\r\nthe divisions of the slate-series were upheaved and contorted by\r\nmovements which did not affect the newer formations.\r\n\r\nV. The conglomerates of the Old Red Sandstone were now spread out by the\r\nbeating of an ancient surf, continued through many ages, against the\r\nupheaved and broken slates.\r\n\r\nVI. Another period of comparative repose followed: the coral-reefs of\r\nthe mountain limestone, and the whole carboniferous series, were formed,\r\nbut not without any oscillations between the land and sea-levels.\r\n\r\nVII. An age of disruption and violence succeeded, marked by the\r\ndiscordant position of the rocks, and by the conglomerate of the New Red\r\nSandstone. At the beginning of this period the great north and south\r\n“Craven fault,” which rent off the eastern calcareous mountains from the\r\nold slates, was formed. Soon afterwards the disruption of the great\r\n“Pennine fault,” which ranges from the foot of Stanmore to the coast of\r\nNorth Cumberland, occurred, lifting up the terrace of Cross Fell above\r\nthe plain of the Eden. About the same time some of the north and south\r\nfissures, which now form the valleys leading into Morecambe Bay, may\r\nhave been formed.\r\n\r\nVIII. The more tranquil period of the New Red Sandstone now dawns, but\r\nhere our facts fail us on the skirts of the Lake Mountains.\r\n\r\nIX. Thousands of ages rolled away during the Secondary and Tertiary\r\nperiods, in which we can trace no movement. But the powers of Nature are\r\nnever still: during this age of apparent repose many a fissure may have\r\nstarted into an open chasm, many a valley been scooped out upon the\r\nlines of “fault.”\r\n\r\nX. Close to the historic times we have evidence of new disruptions and\r\nviolence, and of vast changes of level between land and sea. Ancient\r\nvalleys probably opened out anew or extended, and fresh ones formed in\r\nthe changes of the oceanic level. Cracks among the strata may now have\r\nbecome open fissures, vertical escarpments formed by unequal elevations\r\nalong the lines of fault; and subsidence may have given rise to many of\r\nthe tarns and lakes of the district.\r\n\r\nSuch is the picture which one of our most eminent geologists gives as\r\nthe probable process by which this region has attained its present\r\nappearance, after he had devoted years of study and observation to its\r\npeculiarities; and his description of one spot applies in its general\r\nscope to the whole district. At the close of the Silurian period our\r\nisland was probably an archipelago, ranging over ten degrees of\r\nlatitude, like many of the island groups now found in the great Pacific\r\nOcean; the old gneissic hills of the western coast of Scotland,\r\nculminating in the granite range of Ben Nevis, and stretching to the\r\nsouthern Grampians, forming the nucleus of one island group; the south\r\nHighlands of Scotland, ranging from the Lammermoor hills, another; the\r\nPennine chain and the Malvern hills, the third, and most easterly group;\r\nthe Shropshire and Welsh mountains, a fourth; and Devon and Cornwall\r\nstretching far to the south and west. The basis of the calculation\r\nbeing, that every spot of this island lying now at a lower elevation\r\nthan 800 feet above the sea, was under water at the close of the\r\nSilurian period, except in those instances where depression by\r\nsubsidence has since occurred.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another element to be considered, which cannot be\r\nbetter stated than in the picturesque language of M. Esquiros, an\r\neminent French writer, who has given much attention to British geology.\r\n“The Silurian mountains,” he says, “ruins in themselves, contain other\r\nruins. In the bosom of the Longmynd rocks, geologists discover\r\nconglomerates of rounded stones which bear no resemblance to any rocks\r\nnow near them. These stones consequently prove the existence of rocks\r\nmore ancient still; they are fragments of other mountains, of other\r\nshores, perhaps even of continents, broken up, destroyed, and crumbled\r\nby earlier seas. There is, then, little hope of one discovering the\r\norigin of life on the globe, since this page of the Genesis of the facts\r\nhas been torn. For some years geologists loved to rest their eyes, in\r\nthis long night of ages, upon an ideal limit beyond which plants and\r\nanimals would begin to appear. Now, this line of demarcation between the\r\nrocks which are without vestiges of organised beings, and those which\r\ncontain fossils, is nearly effaced among the surrounding ruins. On the\r\nhorizon of the primitive world we see vaguely indicated a series of\r\nother worlds which have altogether disappeared; perhaps it is necessary\r\nto resign ourselves to the fact that the dawn of life is lost in this\r\nsilent epoch, where age succeeds age, till they are clothed in the garb\r\nof eternity. The river of creation is like the Nile, which, as Bossuet\r\nsays, hides its head--a figure of speech which time has falsified--but\r\nthe endless speculations opened up by these and similar considerations\r\nled Lyell to say, ‘Here I am almost prepared to believe in the ancient\r\nexistence of the Atlantis of Plato.’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.--Ischadites Kœnigii. Upper Ludlow Rocks.]\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--For accurate representations of the typical fossils of\r\n    the Palæozoic strata of Britain, the reader may consult, with\r\n    advantage, the carefully executed “Figures of Characteristic\r\n    British Fossils,” by W. H. Baily, F.G.S. (Van Voorst).\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD RED SANDSTONE AND DEVONIAN PERIOD.\r\n\r\nAnother great period in the Earth’s history opens on us--the Devonian or\r\n“Old Red Sandstone,” so called, because the formation is very clearly\r\ndisplayed over a great extent of country in the county of Devon. The\r\nname was first proposed by Murchison and Sedgwick, in 1837, for these\r\nstrata, which had previously been referred to the “transition” or\r\nSilurian series.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances which marked the passage of the uppermost Silurian\r\nrocks into Old Red Sandstone seem to have been:--First, a shallowing of\r\nthe sea, followed by a gradual alteration in the physical geography of\r\nthe district, so that the area became changed into a series of mingled\r\nfresh and brackish lagoons, which, finally, by continued terrestrial\r\nchanges, were converted into a great fresh-water lake; or, if we take\r\nthe whole of Britain and lands beyond, into a series of lakes.[40]\r\n\r\n  [40] “On the Red Rocks of England,” by A. C. Ramsay. _Quart. Jour.\r\n       Geol. Soc._, vol. xxvii., p. 243.\r\n\r\nMr. Godwin Austen has, also, stated his opinion that the Old Red\r\nSandstone, as distinct from the Devonian rocks, was of lacustrine\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nThe absence of marine shells helps to this conclusion, and the nearest\r\nliving analogues of some of the fishes are found in the fresh water of\r\nAfrica and North America. Even the occurrence in the Devonian rocks of\r\nDevonshire and Russia of some Old Red Sandstone fishes along with marine\r\nshells, merely proves that some of them were fitted to live in either\r\nfresh or salt water, like various existing fishes. At the present day\r\nanimals that are commonly supposed to be essentially marine, are\r\noccasionally found inhabiting fresh water, as is the case in some of the\r\nlakes of Sweden, where it is said marine crustacea are found. Mr.\r\nAlexander Murray also states that in the inland fresh-water lakes of\r\nNewfoundland seals are common, living there without even visiting the\r\nsea. And the same is the case in Lake Baikal, in Central Asia.\r\n\r\nThe red colour of the Old Red Sandstone of England and Scotland, and the\r\ntotal absence of fossils, except in the very uppermost beds, are\r\nconsidered by Professor Ramsay to indicate that the strata were\r\ndeposited in inland waters. These fossils are terrestrial ferns,\r\n_Adiantites_ (Pecopteris) _Hibernicus_, and a fresh-water shell, _Anodon\r\nJukesii_, together with the fish _Glyptolepis_.[41]\r\n\r\n  [41] “On the Red Rocks of England,” by A. C. Ramsay. _Quart. Jour.\r\n       Geol. Soc._, vol. xxvii., p. 247.\r\n\r\nThe rocks deposited during the Devonian period exhibit some species of\r\nanimals and plants of a much more complex organisation than those which\r\nhad previously made their appearance. We have seen, during the Silurian\r\nepoch, organisms appearing of very simple type; namely, zoophytes,\r\narticulated and molluscous animals, with algæ and lycopods, among\r\nplants. We shall see, as the globe grows older, that organisation\r\nbecomes more complex. Vertebrated animals, represented by numerous\r\nFishes, succeed Zoophytes, Trilobites, and Molluscs. Soon afterwards\r\nReptiles appear, then Birds and Mammals; until the time comes when man,\r\nHis supreme and last work, issues from the hands of the Creator, to be\r\nking of all the earth--man, who has for the sign of his superiority,\r\nintelligence--that celestial gift, the emanation from God.\r\n\r\nVast inland seas, or lakes covered with a few islets, form the ideal of\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone period. Upon the rocks of these islets the\r\nmollusca and articulata of the period exhibit themselves, as represented\r\non the opposite page (PLATE IX.). Stranded on the shore we see\r\narmour-coated Fishes of strange forms. A group of plants\r\n(_Asterophyllites_) covers one of the islets, associated with plants\r\nnearly herbaceous, resembling mosses, though the true mosses did not\r\nappear till a much later period. _Encrinites_ and _Lituites_ occupy the\r\nrocks in the foreground of the left hand.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation is still simple in its development, for forest-trees seem\r\naltogether wanting. The Asterophyllites, with tall and slender stems,\r\nrise singly to a considerable height. Cryptogams, of which our mushrooms\r\nconvey some idea, would form the chief part of this primitive\r\nvegetation; but in consequence of the softness of their tissues, their\r\nwant of consistence, and the absence of much woody fibre, these earlier\r\nplants have come down to us only in a fragmentary state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IX.--Ideal Landscape of the Devonian Period.]\r\n\r\nThe plants belonging to the Devonian period differ much from the\r\nvegetation of the present day. They resembled both mosses and lycopods,\r\nwhich are flowerless cryptogamic plants of a low organisation. The\r\nLycopods are herbaceous plants, playing only a secondary part in the\r\nvegetation of the globe; but in the earlier ages of organic creation\r\nthey were the predominant forms in the vegetable kingdom, both as to\r\nindividual size and the number and variety of their species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.--Plants of the Devonian Epoch. 1. Algæ. 2.\r\nZostera. 3. Psilophyton, natural size.]\r\n\r\nIn the woodcut (Fig. 30) we have represented three species of aquatic\r\nplants belonging to the Devonian period; they are--1, _Fucoids_ (or\r\n_Algæ_); 2, _Zostera_; 3, _Psilophyton_. The Fucoid closely resembles\r\nits modern ally; but with the first indications of terrestrial\r\nvegetation we pass from the _Thallogens_, to which the _Algæ_ belong\r\n(plants of simple organisation, without flower or stem), to the\r\n_Acrogens_, which throw out their leaves and branches at the extremity,\r\nand bear in the axils of their leaves minute circular cases, which form\r\nthe receptacles of their spore-like seeds. “If we stand,” says Hugh\r\nMiller, “on the outer edge of one of those iron-bound shores of the\r\nWestern Highlands, where rock and skerries are crowned with sea-weeds;\r\nthe long cylindrical lines of _chorda-filum_, many feet in length, lying\r\naslant in the tideway; long shaggy bunches of _Fucus serratus_ and _F.\r\nnodosus_ drooping from the sides of the rock; the flat ledges bristling\r\nwith the stiff cartilaginous many-cleft fronds of at least two species\r\nof _Chondrus_; now, in the thickly-spread Fucoids of this Highland scene\r\nwe have a not very improbable representation of the Thallogenous\r\nvegetation. If we add to this rocky tract, so rich in Fucoids, a\r\nsubmarine meadow of pale shelly sand, covered by a deep-green swathe of\r\n_Zosteræ_, with jointed root and slim flowers, unfurnished with petals,\r\nit would be more representative still.”\r\n\r\nLet us now take a glance at the animals belonging to this period.\r\n\r\nThe class of Fishes seem to have held the first rank and importance in\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone _fauna_; but their structure was very different\r\nfrom that of existing fishes: they were provided with a sort of cuirass,\r\nand from the nature of the scales were called _Ganoid_ fishes. Numerous\r\nfragments of these curious fishes are now found in geological\r\ncollections; they are of strange forms, some being completely covered\r\nwith a cuirass of many pieces, and others furnished with wing-like\r\npectoral fins, as in _Pterichthys_.\r\n\r\nLet any one picture to himself the surprise he would feel should he, on\r\ntaking his first lesson in geology, and on first breaking a stone--a\r\npebble, for instance, exhibiting every external sign of a water-worn\r\nsurface--find, to appropriate Archdeacon Paley’s illustration, a watch,\r\nor any other delicate piece of mechanism, in its centre. Now, this,\r\nthirty years ago, is exactly the kind of surprise that Hugh Miller\r\nexperienced in the sandstone quarry opened in a lofty wall of cliff\r\noverhanging the northern shore of the Moray Frith. He had picked up a\r\nnodular mass of blue Lias-limestone, which he laid open by a stroke of\r\nthe hammer, when, behold! an exquisitely shaped Ammonite was displayed\r\nbefore him. It is not surprising that henceforth the half-mason,\r\nhalf-sailor, and poet, became a geologist. He sought for information,\r\nand found it; he found that the rocks among which he laboured swarmed\r\nwith the relics of a former age. He pursued his investigations, and\r\nfound, while working in this zone of strata all around the coast, that a\r\ncertain class of fossils abounded; but that in a higher zone these\r\nfamiliar forms disappeared, and others made their appearance.\r\n\r\nHe read and learned that in other lands--lands of more recent\r\nformation--strange forms of animal life had been discovered; forms which\r\nin their turn had disappeared, to be succeeded by others, more in\r\naccordance with beings now living. He came to know that he was\r\nsurrounded, in his native mountains, by the sedimentary deposits of\r\nother ages; he became alive to the fact that these grand mountain ranges\r\nhad been built up grain by grain in the bed of the ocean, and the\r\nmountains had been subsequently raised to their present level by the\r\nupheaval of one part of its bed, or by the subsidence of another. The\r\nyoung geologist now ceased to wonder that each bed, or series of beds,\r\nshould contain in its bosom records of its own epoch; it seemed to him\r\nas if it had been the object of the Creator to furnish the inquirer with\r\nrecords of His wisdom and power, which could not be misinterpreted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.--Fishes of the Devonian Epoch. 1. Coccosteus,\r\none-third natural size. 2. Pterichthys, one-fourth natural size. 3.\r\nCephalaspis, one-fourth natural size.]\r\n\r\nAmong the Fishes of Old Red Sandstone, the _Coccosteus_ (Fig. 31, No. 1)\r\nwas only partially cased in a defensive armour; the upper part of the\r\nbody down to the fins was defended by scales. _Pterichthys_ (No. 2), a\r\nstrange form, with a very small head, furnished with two powerful\r\npaddles, or arms, like wings, and a mouth placed far behind the nose,\r\nwas entirely covered with scales. The _Cephalaspis_ (No. 3), which has a\r\nconsiderable outward resemblance to some fishes of the present time, was\r\nnevertheless mail-clad, only on the anterior part of the body.\r\n\r\nOther fishes were provided with no such cuirass, properly so called, but\r\nwere protected by strong resisting scales, enveloping the whole body.\r\nSuch were the _Acanthodes_ (1), the _Climatius_ (2), and the\r\n_Diplacanthus_ (3), represented in Fig. 32.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.--Fishes of the Devonian epoch. 1. Acanthodes. 2.\r\nClimatius. 3. Diplacanthus.]\r\n\r\nAmong the organic beings of the Devonian rocks we find worm-like\r\nanimals, such as the _Annelides_, protected by an external shell, and\r\nwhich at the present day are probably represented by the _Serpulæ_.\r\nAmong Crustaceans the _Trilobites_ are still somewhat numerous,\r\nespecially in the middle rocks of the period. We also find there many\r\ndifferent groups of Mollusca, of which the _Brachiopoda_ form more than\r\none-half. We may say of this period that it is the reign of\r\nBrachiopoda; in it they assumed extraordinary forms, and the number of\r\ntheir species was very great. Among the most curious we may instance the\r\nenormous _Stringocephalus Burtini_, _Davidsonia Verneuilli_, _Uncites\r\ngryphus_, and _Calceola Sandalina_, shells of singular and fantastic\r\nshape, differing entirely from all known forms. Amongst the most\r\ncharacteristic of these Mollusca, _Atrypa reticularis_ (Fig. 33) holds\r\nthe first rank, with _Spirifera concentrica_, _Leptæna Murchisoni_, and\r\n_Productus subaculeatus_. Among the Cephalopoda we have _Clymenia\r\nSedgwickii_ (Fig. 34), including the _Goniatites_, illustrating the\r\nAmmonites, which so distinctly characterise the Secondary epoch, but\r\nwhich were only foreshadowed in the Devonian period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.--Atrypa reticularis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.--Clymenia Sedgwickii.]\r\n\r\nAmong the Radiata of this epoch, the order Crinoidea are abundantly\r\nrepresented. We give as an example _Cupressocrinus crassus_ (Fig. 35).\r\nThe Encrinites, under which name the whole of these animals are\r\nsometimes included, lived attached to rocky places and in deep water, as\r\nthey now do in the Caribbean sea.\r\n\r\nThe Encrinites, as we have seen, were represented during the Silurian\r\nperiod in a simple genus, _Hemicosmites_, but they greatly increased in\r\nnumbers in the seas of the Devonian period. They diminish in numbers, as\r\nwe retire from that geological age; until those forms, which were so\r\nnumerous and varied in the earliest seas, are now only represented by\r\ntwo genera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.--Cupressocrinus crassus.]\r\n\r\nThe Old Red Sandstone rocks are composed of schists, sandstone, and\r\nlimestones. The line of demarcation between the Silurian rocks and those\r\nwhich succeed them may be followed, in many places, by the eye; but, on\r\na closer examination, the exact limits of the two systems become more\r\ndifficult to fix. The beds of the one system pass into the other by a\r\ngradual passage, for Nature rarely admits of violent contrasts, and\r\nshows few sudden transitions. By-and-by, however, the change becomes\r\nvery decided, and the contrast between the dark grey masses at the base\r\nand the superincumbent yellow and red rocks become sufficiently\r\nstriking. In fact, the uppermost beds of the Silurian rocks are the\r\npassage-beds of the overlying system, consisting of flagstones,\r\noccasionally reddish, and called in some districts “tile-stones.” Over\r\nthese lie the Old Red Sandstone conglomerate, the Caithness flags, and\r\nthe great superincumbent mass which forms the upper portion of the\r\nsystem. Though less abrupt than the eruptive and Silurian mountains, the\r\nOld Red Sandstone scenery is, nevertheless, distinguished by its\r\nimposing outline, assuming bold and lofty escarpments in the Vans of\r\nBrecon, in Grongar Hill, near Caermarthen, and in the Black Mountain of\r\nMonmouthshire, in the centre of a landscape which, wood, rock, and river\r\ncombine to render perfect. But it is in the north of Scotland where this\r\nrock assumes its grandest aspect, wrapping its mantle round the loftiest\r\nmountains, and rising out of the sea in rugged and fantastic masses, as\r\nfar north as the Orkneys. In Devon and Cornwall, where the rocks are of\r\na calcareous, and sometimes schistose or slaty character, they are\r\nsufficiently extensive to have given a name to the series, which is\r\nrecognised all over the world.\r\n\r\nIn Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Shropshire, Gloucestershire, and South\r\nWales, the Old Red Sandstone is largely developed, and sometimes attains\r\nthe thickness of from 8,000 to 10,000 feet, divided into: 1.\r\nConglomerate; 2. Brown stone, with _Eurypterus_; 3. Marl and cornstones,\r\nwith irregular courses of concrete limestone, in which are spines of\r\nFishes and remains of _Cephalaspis_ and _Pteraspis_; 4. Thin\r\nolive-coloured shales and sandstone, intercalated with beds of red marl,\r\ncontaining _Cephalaspis_ and _Auchenaspis_. In Scotland, south of the\r\nGrampians, a yellow sandstone occupies the base of the system;\r\nconglomerate, red shales, sandstone and cornstones, containing\r\n_Holoptychius_ and _Cephalaspis_, and the Arbroath paving-stone,\r\ncontaining what Agassiz recognised as a huge Crustacean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.--Trinucleus Lloydii. (Llandeilo Flags.)]\r\n\r\nSome of the phenomena connected with the older rocks of Devonshire are\r\ndifficult to unravel. The Devonian, it is now understood, is the\r\nequivalent, in another area, of the Old Red Sandstone, and in Cornwall\r\nand Devonshire lie directly on the Silurian strata, while elsewhere the\r\nfossils of the Upper Silurian are almost identical with those in the\r\nDevonian beds. The late Professor Jukes, with some other geologists, was\r\nof opinion that the Devonian rocks of Devonshire only represented the\r\nOld Red Sandstone of Scotland and South Wales in part; the Upper\r\nDevonian rocks lying between the acknowledged Old Red Sandstone and the\r\nCulm-measures being the representatives of the lower carboniferous rocks\r\nof Ireland.\r\n\r\nMr. Etheridge, on the other hand, in an elaborate memoir upon the same\r\nsubject, has endeavoured to prove that the Devonian and Old Red\r\nSandstone, though contemporaneous in point of time, were deposited in\r\ndifferent areas and under widely different conditions--the one strictly\r\nmarine, the other altogether fresh-water--or, perhaps, partly\r\nfresh-water and partly estuarine. This supposition is strongly supported\r\nby his researches into the mollusca of the Devonian system, and also by\r\nthe fish-remains of the Devonian and Old Red Sandstone of Scotland and\r\nthe West of England and Wales.[42] The difficulty of drawing a\r\nsharply-defined line of demarcation between different systems is\r\nsufficient to dispel the idea which has sometimes been entertained that\r\nspecial _faunæ_ were created and annihilated in the mass at the close of\r\neach epoch. There was no close: each epoch disappears or merges into\r\nthat which succeeds it, and with it the animals belonging to it, much as\r\nwe have seen them disappear from our own fauna almost within recent\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n  [42] For fuller details on this subject, see J. B. Jukes’ “Manual of\r\n       Geology,” 3rd ed., p. 762. Also, R. Etheridge, _Quart. Journ.\r\n       Geol. Soc._, vol. 23, p. 251.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARBONIFEROUS PERIOD.\r\n\r\nIn the history of our globe the Carboniferous period succeeds to the\r\nDevonian. It is in the formations of this latter epoch that we find the\r\nfossil fuel which has done so much to enrich and civilise the world in\r\nour own age. This period divides itself into two great sub-periods: 1.\r\nThe _Coal-measures_; and 2. The _Carboniferous Limestone_. The first, a\r\nperiod which gave rise to the great deposits of coal; the second, to\r\nmost important marine deposits, most frequently underlying the\r\ncoal-fields in England, Belgium, France, and America.\r\n\r\nThe limestone-mountains which form the base of the whole system, attain\r\nin places, according to Professor Phillips, a thickness of 2,500 feet.\r\nThey are of marine origin, as is apparent by the multitude of fossils\r\nthey contain of Zoophytes, Radiata, Cephalopoda, and Fishes. But the\r\nchief characteristic of this epoch is its strictly terrestrial\r\nflora--remains of plants now become as common as they were rare in all\r\nprevious formations, announcing a great increase of dry land. In older\r\ngeological times the present site of our island was covered by a sea of\r\nunlimited extent; we now approach a time when it was a forest, or,\r\nrather, an innumerable group of islands, and marshes covered with\r\nforests, which spread over the surface of the clusters of islands which\r\nthickly studded the sea of the period.\r\n\r\nThe monuments of this era of profuse vegetation reveal themselves in the\r\nprecious Coal-measures of England and Scotland. These give us some idea\r\nof the rich verdure which covered the surface of the earth, newly risen\r\nfrom the bosom of its parent waves. It was the paradise of terrestrial\r\nvegetation. The grand _Sigillaria_, the _Stigmaria_, and other fern-like\r\nplants, were especially typical of this age, and formed the woods, which\r\nwere left to grow undisturbed; for as yet no living Mammals seem to have\r\nappeared; everything indicates a uniformly warm, humid temperature, the\r\nonly climate in which the gigantic ferns of the Coal-measures could have\r\nattained their magnitude. In Fig. 37 the reader has a restoration of the\r\narborescent and herbaceous Ferns of the period. Conifers have been\r\nfound of this period with concentric rings, but these rings are more\r\nslightly marked than in existing trees of the same family, from which\r\nit is reasonable to assume that the seasonal changes were less marked\r\nthan they are with us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.--Ferns restored. 1 and 2. Arborescent Ferns. 3\r\nand 4. Herbaceous Ferns.]\r\n\r\nEverything announces that the time occupied in the deposition of the\r\nCarboniferous Limestone was one of vast duration. Professor Phillips\r\ncalculates that, at the ordinary rate of progress, it would require\r\n122,400 years to produce only sixty feet of coal. Geologists believe,\r\nmoreover, that the upper coal-measures, where bed has been deposited\r\nupon bed, for ages upon ages, were accumulated under conditions of\r\ncomparative tranquillity, but that the end of this period was marked by\r\nviolent convulsions--by ruptures of the terrestrial crust, when the\r\ncarboniferous rocks were upturned, contorted, dislocated by faults, and\r\nsubsequently partially denuded, and thus appear now in depressions or\r\nbasin-shaped concavities; and that upon this deranged and disturbed\r\nfoundation a fourth geological system, called Permian, was constructed.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental character of the period we are about to study is the\r\nimmense development of a vegetation which then covered much of the\r\nglobe. The great thickness of the rocks which now represent the period\r\nin question, the variety of changes which are observed in these rocks\r\nwherever they are met with, lead to the conclusion that this phase in\r\nthe Earth’s history involved a long succession of time.\r\n\r\nCoal, as we shall find, is composed of the mineralised remains of the\r\nvegetation which flourished in remote ages of the world. Buried under an\r\nenormous thickness of rocks, it has been preserved to our days, after\r\nbeing modified in its inward nature and external aspect. Having lost a\r\nportion of its elementary constituents, it has become transformed into a\r\nspecies of carbon, impregnated with those bituminous substances which\r\nare the ordinary products of the slow decomposition of vegetable matter.\r\n\r\nThus, coal, which supplies our manufactures and our furnaces, which is\r\nthe fundamental agent of our productive and economic industry--the coal\r\nwhich warms our houses and furnishes the gas which lights our streets\r\nand dwellings--is the substance of the plants which formed the forests,\r\nthe vegetation, and the marshes of the ancient world, at a period too\r\ndistant for human chronology to calculate with anything like precision.\r\nWe shall not say--with some persons, who believe that all in Nature was\r\nmade with reference to man, and who thus form a very imperfect idea of\r\nthe vast immensity of creation--that the vegetables of the ancient world\r\nhave lived and multiplied only, some day, to prepare for man the agents\r\nof his economic and industrial occupations. We shall rather direct the\r\nattention of our young readers to the powers of modern science, which\r\ncan thus, after such a prodigious interval of time, trace the precise\r\norigin, and state with the utmost exactness, the genera and species of\r\nplants, of which there are now no identical representatives existing on\r\nthe face of the earth.\r\n\r\nLet us pause for a moment, and consider the general characters which\r\nbelonged to our planet during the Carboniferous period. Heat--though not\r\nnecessarily excessive heat--and extreme humidity were then the\r\nattributes of its atmosphere. The modern allies of the species which\r\nformed its vegetation are now only found under the burning latitudes of\r\nthe tropics; and the enormous dimensions in which we find them in the\r\nfossil state prove, on the other hand, that the atmosphere was saturated\r\nwith moisture. Dr. Livingstone tells us that continual rains, added to\r\nintense heat, are the climatic characteristic of Equatorial Africa,\r\nwhere the vigorous and tufted vegetation flourishes which is so\r\ndelightful to the eye.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable circumstance that conditions of equable and warm\r\nclimate, combined with humidity, do not seem to have been limited to any\r\none part of the globe, but the temperature of the whole globe seems to\r\nhave been nearly the same in very different latitudes. From the\r\nEquatorial regions up to Melville Island, in the Arctic Ocean, where in\r\nour days eternal frost prevails--from Spitzbergen to the centre of\r\nAfrica, the carboniferous flora is identically the same. When nearly the\r\nsame plants are found in Greenland and Guinea; when the same species,\r\nnow extinct, are met with of equal development at the equator as at the\r\npole, we cannot but admit that at this epoch the temperature of the\r\nglobe was nearly alike everywhere. What we now call _climate_ was\r\nunknown in these geological times. There seems to have been then only\r\none climate over the whole globe. It was at a subsequent period, that\r\nis, in later Tertiary times, that the cold began to make itself felt at\r\nthe terrestrial poles. Whence, then, proceeded this general superficial\r\nwarmth, which we now regard with so much surprise? It was a consequence\r\nof the greater or nearer influence of the interior heat of the globe.\r\nThe earth was still so hot in itself, that the heat which reached it\r\nfrom the sun may have been inappreciable.\r\n\r\nAnother hypothesis, which has been advanced with much less certainty\r\nthan the preceding, relates to the chemical composition of the air\r\nduring the Carboniferous period. Seeing the enormous mass of vegetation\r\nwhich then covered the globe, and extended from one pole to the other;\r\nconsidering, also, the great proportion of carbon and hydrogen which\r\nexists in the bituminous matter of coal, it has been thought, and not\r\nwithout reason, that the atmosphere of the period might be richer in\r\ncarbonic acid than the atmosphere of the present day. It has even been\r\nthought that the small number of (especially air-breathing) animals,\r\nwhich then lived, might be accounted for by the presence of a greater\r\nproportion of carbonic acid gas in the atmosphere than is the case in\r\nour own times. This, however, is pure assumption, totally deficient in\r\nproof. Nothing proves that the atmosphere of the period in question was\r\nricher in carbonic acid than is the case now. Since we are only able,\r\nthen, to offer vague conjectures on this subject, we cannot profess with\r\nany confidence to entertain the opinion that the atmospheric air of the\r\nCarboniferous period contained more carbonic acid gas than that which we\r\nnow breathe. What we can remark, with certainty, as a striking\r\ncharacteristic of the vegetation of the globe during this phase of its\r\nhistory, was the prodigious development which it assumed. The Ferns,\r\nwhich in our days and in our climate, are most commonly only small\r\nperennial plants, in the Carboniferous age sometimes presented\r\nthemselves under lofty and even magnificent forms.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows those marsh-plants with hollow, channelled, and\r\narticulated cylindrical stems; whose joints are furnished with a\r\nmembranous, denticulated sheath, and which bear the vulgar name of\r\n“mare’s-tail;” their fructification forming a sort of catkin composed of\r\nmany rings of scales, carrying on their lower surface sacs full of\r\n_spores_ or seeds. These humble _Equiseta_ were represented during the\r\nCoal-period by herbaceous trees from twenty to thirty feet high and four\r\nto six inches in diameter. Their trunks, channelled longitudinally, and\r\ndivided transversely by lines of articulation, have been preserved to\r\nus: they bear the name of _Calamites_. The engraving (Fig. 38)\r\nrepresents one of these gigantic mare’s-tails, or Calamites, of the\r\nCoal-period, restored under the directions of M. Eugene Deslongchamps.\r\nIt is represented with its fronds of leaves, and its organs of\r\nfructification. They seem to have grown by means of an underground stem,\r\nwhile new buds issued from the ground at intervals, as represented in\r\nthe engraving.\r\n\r\nThe _Lycopods_ of our age are humble plants, scarcely a yard in height,\r\nand most commonly creepers; but the Lycopodiaceæ of the ancient world\r\nwere trees of eighty or ninety feet in height. It was the\r\n_Lepidodendrons_ which filled the forests. Their leaves were sometimes\r\ntwenty inches long, and their trunks a yard in diameter. Such are the\r\ndimensions of some specimens of _Lepidodendron carinatum_ which have\r\nbeen found. Another Lycopod of this period, the _Lomatophloyos\r\ncrassicaule_, attained dimensions still more colossal. The _Sigillarias_\r\nsometimes exceeded 100 feet in height. Herbaceous Ferns were also\r\nexceedingly abundant, and grew beneath the shade of these gigantic\r\ntrees. It was the combination of these lofty trees with such shrubs (if\r\nwe may so call them), which formed the forests of the Carboniferous\r\nperiod. The trunks of two of the gigantic trees, which flourished in the\r\nforests of the Carboniferous period, are represented in Figs. 39 and 40,\r\nreduced respectively to one-fifth and one-tenth the natural size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.--Calamite restored. Thirty to forty feet high.]\r\n\r\nWhat could be more surprising than the aspect of this exuberant\r\nvegetation!--these immense Sigillarias, which reigned over the forest!\r\nthese Lepidodendrons, with flexible and slender stems! these\r\nLomatophloyos, which present themselves as _herbaceous_ trees of\r\ngigantic height, furnished with verdant leaflets! these Calamites, forty\r\nfeet high! these elegant arborescent Ferns, with airy foliage, as\r\nfinely cut as the most delicate lace! Nothing at the present day can\r\nconvey to us an idea of the prodigious and immense extent of\r\nnever-changing verdure which clothed the earth, from pole to pole, under\r\nthe high temperature which everywhere prevailed over the whole\r\nterrestrial globe. In the depths of these inextricable forests parasitic\r\nplants were suspended from the trunks of the great trees, in tufts or\r\ngarlands, like the wild vines of our tropical forests. They were nearly\r\nall pretty, fern-like plants--_Sphenopteris_, _Hymenophyllites_, &c.;\r\nthey attached themselves to the stems of the great trees, like the\r\norchids and _Bromeliaceæ_ of our times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.--Trunk of Calamites. One-fifth natural size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.--Trunk of Sigillaria. One-tenth natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe margin of the waters would also be covered with various plants with\r\nlight and whorled leaves, belonging, perhaps, to the Dicotyledons;\r\n_Annularia fertilis_, _Sphenophyllites_, and _Asterophyllites_.\r\n\r\nHow this vegetation, so imposing, both on account of the dimensions of\r\nthe individual trees and the immense space which they occupied, so\r\nsplendid in its aspect, and yet so simple in its organisation, must have\r\ndiffered from that which now embellishes the earth and charms our eyes!\r\nIt certainly possessed the advantage of size and rapid growth; but how\r\npoor it was in species--how uniform in appearance! No flowers yet\r\nadorned the foliage or varied the tints of the forests. Eternal verdure\r\nclothed the branches of the Ferns, the Lycopods, and Equiseta, which\r\ncomposed to a great extent the vegetation of the age. The forests\r\npresented an innumerable collection of individuals, but very few\r\nspecies, and all belonging to the lower types of vegetation. No fruit\r\nappeared fit for nourishment; none would seem to have been on the\r\nbranches. Suffice it to say that few terrestrial animals seem to have\r\nexisted yet; animal life was apparently almost wholly confined to the\r\nsea, while the vegetable kingdom occupied the land, which at a later\r\nperiod was more thickly inhabited by air-breathing animals. Probably a\r\nfew winged insects (some coleoptera, orthoptera, and neuroptera) gave\r\nanimation to the air while exhibiting their variegated colours; and it\r\nwas not impossible but that many pulmoniferous mollusca (such as\r\nland-snails) lived at the same time.\r\n\r\nBut, we might ask, for what eyes, for whose thoughts, for whose wants,\r\ndid the solitary forests grow? For whom these majestic and extensive\r\nshades? For whom these sublime sights? What mysterious beings\r\ncontemplated these marvels? A question which cannot be solved, and one\r\nbefore which we are overwhelmed, and our powerless reason is silent; its\r\nsolution rests with Him who said, “Before the world was, I am!”\r\n\r\nThe vegetation which covered the numerous islands of the Carboniferous\r\nsea consisted, then, of Ferns, of Equisetaceæ, of Lycopodiaceæ, and\r\ndicotyledonous Gymnosperms. The Annularia and Sigillariæ belong to\r\nfamilies of the last-named class, which are now completely extinct.\r\n\r\nThe _Annulariæ_ were small plants which floated on the surface of\r\nfresh-water lakes and ponds; their leaves were verticillate, that is,\r\narranged in a great number of whorls, at each articulation of the stem\r\nwith the branches. The _Sigillariæ_ were, on the contrary, great trees,\r\nconsisting of a simple trunk, surmounted with a bunch or panicle of\r\nslender drooping leaves, with the bark often channelled, and displaying\r\nimpressions or scars of the old leaves, which, from their resemblance to\r\na seal, _sigillum_, gave origin to their name. Fig. 41 represents the\r\nbark of one of these Sigillariæ, which is often met with in coal-mines.\r\n\r\nThe _Stigmariæ_ (Fig. 42), according to palæontologists, were roots of\r\nSigillariæ, with a subterranean fructification; all that is known of\r\nthem is the long roots which carry the reproductive organs, and in some\r\ncases are as much as sixteen feet long. These were suspected by\r\nBrongniart, on botanical grounds, to be the roots of Sigillaria, and\r\nrecent discoveries have confirmed this impression. Sir Charles Lyell, in\r\ncompany with Dr. Dawson, examined several erect _Sigillariæ_ in the\r\nsea-cliffs of the South Joggins in Nova Scotia, and found that from the\r\nlower extremities of the trunk they sent out _Stigmariæ_ as roots, which\r\ndivided into four parts, and these again threw out eight continuations,\r\neach of which again divided into pairs. Twenty-one specimens of\r\nSigillaria have been described by Dr. Dawson from the Coal-measures of\r\nNova Scotia; but the differences in the markings in different parts of\r\nthe same tree are so great, that Dr. Dawson regards the greater part of\r\nthe recognised species of _Sigillariæ_ as merely provisional.[43]\r\n\r\n  [43] _Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._, vol. xxii., p. 129.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.--Sigillaria lævigata. One-third natural size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.--Stigmaria. One-tenth natural size.]\r\n\r\nTwo other gigantic trees grew in the forests of this period: these were\r\n_Lepidodendron carinatum_ and _Lomatophloyos crassicaule_, both\r\nbelonging to the family of Lycopodiaceæ, which now includes only very\r\nsmall species. The trunk of the Lomatophloyos threw out numerous\r\nbranches, which terminated in thick tufts of linear and fleshy leaves.\r\n\r\nThe _Lepidodendrons_, of which there are about forty known species, have\r\ncylindrical bifurcated branches; that is, the branches were evolved in\r\npairs, or were _dichotomous_ to the top. The extremities of the branches\r\nwere terminated by a fructification in the form of a cone, formed of\r\nlinear scales, to which the name of _Lepidostrobus_ (Fig. 45) has been\r\ngiven. Nevertheless, many of these branches were sterile, and terminated\r\nsimply in fronds (elongated leaves). In many of the coal-fields fossil\r\ncones have been found, to which this name has been given by earlier\r\npalæontologists. They sometimes form the nucleus of nodular,\r\nconcretionary balls of clay-ironstone, and are well preserved, having a\r\nconical axis, surrounded by scales compactly imbricated. The opinion of\r\nBrongniart is now generally adopted, that they are the fruit of the\r\nLepidodendron. At Coalbrookdale, and elsewhere, these have been found as\r\nterminal tips of a branch of a well-characterised Lepidodendron. Both\r\nHooker and Brongniart place them with the Lycopods, having cones with\r\nsimilar spores and sporangia, like that family. Most of them were large\r\ntrees. One tree of _L. Sternbergii_, nearly fifty feet long, was found\r\nin the Jarrow Colliery, near Newcastle, lying in the shale parallel to\r\nthe plane of stratification. Fragments of others found in the same shale\r\nindicated, by the size of the rhomboidal scars which covered them, a\r\nstill greater size. Lepidodendron Sternbergii (Fig. 43) is represented\r\nas it is found beneath the shales in the collieries of Swina, in\r\nBohemia. Fig. 46 represents a portion of a branch of _L. elegans_\r\nfurnished with leaves. M. Eugene Deslongchamps has drawn the restoration\r\nof the Lepidodendron Sternbergii, represented in Fig. 47, which is shown\r\nentire in Fig. 44, with its stem, its branches, fronds, and organs of\r\nfructification. The Ferns composed a great part of the vegetation of the\r\nCoal-measure period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.--Lepidodendron Sternbergii.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.--Lepidodendron Sternbergii restored. Forty feet\r\nhigh.]\r\n\r\nThe Ferns differ chiefly in some of the details of the leaf.\r\n_Pecopteris_, for instance (Fig. 48), have the leaves once, twice, or\r\nthrice pinnatifid with the leaflets adhering either by their whole base\r\nor by the centre only; the midrib running through to the point.\r\n_Neuropteris_ (Fig. 49) has leaves divided like Pecopteris, but the\r\nmidrib does not reach the apex of the leaflets, but divides right and\r\nleft into veins. _Odontopteris_ (Fig. 51) has pinnatifid leaves, like\r\nthe last, but its leaflets adhere by their whole base to the stalk.\r\n_Lonchopteris_ (Fig. 50) has the leaves several times pinnatifid, the\r\nleaflets more or less united to one another, and the veins reticulated.\r\nAmong the most numerous species of forms of the Coal-measure period was\r\n_Sphenopteris artemisiæfolia_ (Fig. 52), of which a magnified leaf is\r\nrepresented. Sphenopteris has twice or thrice pinnatifid leaves, the\r\nleaflets narrow at the base, and the veins generally arranged as if they\r\nradiated from the base; the leaflets are frequently wedge-shaped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.--Lepidostrobus variabilis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.--Lepidodendron elegans.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCARBONIFEROUS LIMESTONE. (SUB-PERIOD.)\r\n\r\nThe seas of this epoch included an immense number of Zoophytes, nearly\r\n400 species of Mollusca, and a few Crustaceans and Fishes. Among the\r\nFishes, _Psammodus_ and _Coccosteus_, whose massive teeth inserted in\r\nthe palate were suitable for grinding; and the _Holoptychius_ and\r\n_Megalichthys_, are the most important. The Mollusca are chiefly\r\nBrachiopods of great size. The Productæ attained here exceptional\r\ndevelopment, _Producta Martini_ (Fig. 53), _P. semi-reticulata_ and _P.\r\ngigantea_, being the most remarkable. Spirifers, also, were equally\r\nabundant, as _Spirifera trigonalis_ and _S. glabra_. In _Terebratula\r\nhastata_ the coloured bands, which adorned the shell of the living\r\nanimal, have been preserved to us. The _Bellerophon_, whose convoluted\r\nshell in some respects resembles the Nautilus of our present seas, but\r\nwithout its chambered shell, were then represented by many species,\r\namong others by _Bellerophon costatus_ (Fig. 54), and _B. hiulcus_ (Fig.\r\n56). Again, among the Cephalopods, we find the _Orthoceras_ (Fig. 57),\r\nwhich resembled a straight Nautilus; and Goniatites (_Goniatites\r\nevolutus_, Fig. 55), a chambered shell allied to the Ammonite, which\r\nappeared in great numbers during the Secondary epoch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.--Lepidodendron Sternbergii.]\r\n\r\nCrustaceans are rare in the Carboniferous Limestone strata; the genus\r\nPhillipsia is the last of the Trilobites, all of which became extinct at\r\nthe close of this period. As to the Zoophytes, they consist chiefly of\r\nCrinoids and Corals. The Crinoids were represented by the genera\r\n_Platycrinus_ and _Cyathocrinus_. We also have in these rocks many\r\nPolyzoa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.--Pecopteris lonchitica, a little magnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.--Neuropteris gigantea.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.--Lonchopteris Bricii.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.--Odontopteris Brardii.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.--Sphenopteris artemisiæfolia, magnified.]\r\n\r\nAmong the corals of the period, we may include the genera\r\n_Lithostrotion_ and _Lonsdalea_, of which _Lithostrotion basaltiforme_\r\n(Fig. 58), and _Lonsdalea floriformis_ (Fig. 59), are respectively the\r\nrepresentatives, with _Amplexus coralloïdes_. Among the Polyzoa are the\r\ngenera _Fenestrella_ and _Polypora_. Lastly, to these we may add a group\r\nof animals which will play a very important part and become abundantly\r\nrepresented in the beds of later geological periods, but which already\r\nabounded in the seas of the Carboniferous period. We speak of the\r\n_Foraminifera_ (Fig. 60), microscopic animals, which clustered either in\r\none body, or divided into segments, and covered with a calcareous,\r\nmany-chambered shell, as in Fig. 60, _Fusulina cylindrica_. These little\r\ncreatures, which, during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, formed\r\nenormous banks and entire masses of rock, began to make their\r\nappearance in the period which now engages our attention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.--Producta Martini. One-third nat. size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.--Bellerophon costatus. Half nat. size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.--Goniatites evolutus. Nat. size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.--Bellerophon hiulcus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.--Orthoceras laterale.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.--Lithostrotion basaltiforme.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.--Lonsdalea floriformis.]\r\n\r\nThe plate opposite (PLATE X.) is a representation of an ideal aquarium,\r\nin which some of the more prominent species, which inhabited the seas\r\nduring the period of the Carboniferous Limestone, are represented. On\r\nthe right is a tribe of corals, with reflections of dazzling white: the\r\nspecies represented are, nearest the edge, the _Lasmocyathus_, the\r\n_Chætetes_, and the _Ptylopora_. The Mollusc which occupies the\r\nextremity of the elongated and conical tube in the shape of a sabre is\r\nan _Aploceras_. It seems to prepare the way for the Ammonite; for if\r\nthis elongated shell were coiled round itself it would resemble the\r\nAmmonite and Nautilus. In the centre of the foreground we have\r\n_Bellerophon hiulcus_ (Fig. 56), the _Nautilus Koninckii_, and a\r\n_Producta_, with the numerous spines which surround the shell. (See Fig.\r\n62.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.--Foraminifera of the Mountain Limestone, forming\r\nthe centre of an oolitic grain. Power 120.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61.--Foraminifera of the Chalk, obtained by brushing\r\nit in water. Power 120.]\r\n\r\nOn the left are other corals: the _Cyathophyllum_ with straight\r\ncylindrical stems; some Encrinites (_Cyathocrinus_ and _Platycrinus_)\r\nwound round the trunk of a tree, or with their flexible stem floating in\r\nthe water. Some Fishes, _Amblypterus_, move about amongst these\r\ncreatures, the greater number of which are immovably attached, like\r\nplants, to the rock on which they grow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: X.--Ideal view of marine life in the Carboniferous\r\nPeriod.]\r\n\r\nIn addition, this engraving shows us a series of islets, rising out\r\nof a tranquil sea. One of these is occupied by a forest, in which a\r\ndistant view is presented of the general forms of the grand vegetation\r\nof the period.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is of importance to know the rocks formed by marine deposits during\r\nthe era of the Carboniferous Limestone, inasmuch as they include coal,\r\nthough in much smaller quantities than in the succeeding sub-period of\r\nthe true coal-deposit. They consist essentially of a compact limestone,\r\nof a greyish-blue, and even black colour. The blow of the hammer causes\r\nthem to exhale a somewhat fetid odour, which is owing to decomposed\r\norganic matter--the modified substance of the molluscs and zoophytes--of\r\nwhich it is to so great an extent composed, and whose remains are still\r\neasily recognised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62.--Producta horrida. Half natural size.]\r\n\r\nIn the north of England, and many other parts of the British Islands,\r\nthe Carboniferous Limestone forms, as we have seen, lofty\r\nmountain-masses, to which the term _Mountain Limestone_ is sometimes\r\napplied.\r\n\r\nIn Derbyshire the formation constitutes rugged, lofty, and\r\nfantastically-shaped mountains, whose summits mingle with the clouds,\r\nwhile its picturesque character appears here, as well as farther north,\r\nin the _dales_ or valleys, where rich meadows, through which the\r\nmountain streams force their way, seem to be closed abruptly by masses\r\nof rock, rising above them like the grey ruins of some ancient tower;\r\nwhile the mountain bases are pierced with caverns, and their sides\r\ncovered with mosses and ferns, for the growth of which the limestone is\r\nparticularly favourable.\r\n\r\nThe formation is _metalliferous_, and yields rich veins of lead-ore in\r\nDerbyshire, Cumberland, and other counties of Great Britain. The rock is\r\nfound in Russia, in the north of France, and in Belgium, where it\r\nfurnishes the common marbles, known as Flanders marble (_Marbre de\r\nFlandres_ and _M. de petit granit_). These marbles are also quarried in\r\nother localities, such as Regneville (La Manche), either for the\r\nmanufacture of lime or for ornamental stonework; one of the varieties\r\nquarried at Regneville, being black, with large yellow veins, is very\r\npretty.\r\n\r\nIn France, the _Carboniferous Limestone_, with its sandstones and\r\nconglomerates, schists and limestones, is largely developed in the\r\nVosges, in the Lyonnais, and in Languedoc, often in contact with\r\nsyenites and porphyries, and other igneous rocks, by which it has been\r\npenetrated and disturbed, and even _metamorphosed_ in many ways, by\r\nreason of the various kinds of rocks of which it is composed. In the\r\nUnited States the Carboniferous Limestone formation occupies a somewhat\r\ngrand position in the rear of the Alleghanies. It is also found forming\r\nconsiderable ranges in our Australian colonies.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of their age, as compared with the Secondary and Tertiary\r\nlimestones, the Carboniferous rocks are generally more marked and varied\r\nin character. The valley of the Meuse, from Namur to Chockier, above\r\nLiège, is cut out of this formation; and many of our readers will\r\nremember with delight the picturesque character of the scenery,\r\nespecially that of the left bank of the celebrated river in question.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOAL MEASURES. (SUB-PERIOD.)\r\n\r\nThis terrestrial period is characterised, in a remarkable manner, by the\r\nabundance and strangeness of the vegetation which then covered the\r\nislands and continents of the whole globe. Upon all points of the earth,\r\nas we have said, this flora presented a striking uniformity. In\r\ncomparing it with the vegetation of the present day, the learned French\r\nbotanist, M. Brongniart, who has given particular attention to the flora\r\nof the Coal-measures, has arrived at the conclusion that it presented\r\nconsiderable analogy with that of the islands of the equatorial and\r\ntorrid zone, in which a maritime climate and elevated temperature exist\r\nin the highest degree. It is believed that islands were very numerous at\r\nthis period; that, in short, the dry land formed a sort of vast\r\narchipelago upon the general ocean, of no great depth, the islands being\r\nconnected together and formed into continents as they gradually emerged\r\nfrom the ocean.\r\n\r\nThis flora, then, consists of great trees, and also of many smaller\r\nplants, which would form a close, thick turf, or sod, when partially\r\nburied in marshes of almost unlimited extent. M. Brongniart indicates,\r\nas characterising the period, 500 species of plants belonging to\r\nfamilies which we have already seen making their first appearance in the\r\nDevonian period, but which now attain a prodigious development. The\r\nordinary dicotyledons and monocotyledons--that is, plants having seeds\r\nwith two lobes in germinating, and plants having one seed-lobe--are\r\nalmost entirely absent; the cryptogamic, or flowerless plants,\r\npredominate; especially Ferns, Lycopodiaceæ and Equisetaceæ--but of\r\nforms insulated and actually extinct in these same families. A few\r\ndicotyledonous gymnosperms, or naked-seed plants forming genera of\r\nConifers, have completely disappeared, not only from the present flora,\r\nbut since the close of the period under consideration, there being no\r\ntrace of them in the succeeding Permian flora. Such is a general view of\r\nthe features most characteristic of the Coal period, and of the Primary\r\nepoch in general. It differs, altogether and absolutely, from that of\r\nthe present day; the climatic condition of these remote ages of the\r\nglobe, however, enables us to comprehend the characteristics which\r\ndistinguish its vegetation. A damp atmosphere, of an equable rather than\r\nan intense heat like that of the tropics, a soft light veiled by\r\npermanent fogs, were favourable to the growth of this peculiar\r\nvegetation, of which we search in vain for anything strictly analogous\r\nin our own days. The nearest approach to the climate and vegetation\r\nproper to the geological period which now occupies our attention, would\r\nprobably be found in certain islands, or on the littoral of the Pacific\r\nOcean--the island of Chloë, for example, where it rains during 300 days\r\nin the year, and where the light of the sun is shut out by perpetual\r\nfogs; where arborescent Ferns form forests, beneath whose shade grow\r\nherbaceous Ferns, which rise three feet and upwards above a marshy soil;\r\nwhich gives shelter also to a mass of cryptogamic plants, greatly\r\nresembling, in its main features, the flora of the Coal-measures. This\r\nflora was, as we have said, uniform and poor in its botanic genera,\r\ncompared to the abundance and variety of the flora of the present time;\r\nbut the few families of plants, which existed then, included many more\r\nspecies than are now produced in the same countries. The fossil Ferns of\r\nthe coal-series in Europe, for instance, comprehend about 300 species,\r\nwhile all Europe now only produces fifty. The gymnosperms, which now\r\nmuster only twenty-five species in Europe, then numbered more than 120.\r\n\r\nIt will simplify the classification of the flora of the Carboniferous\r\nepoch if we give a tabular arrangement adopted by the best\r\nauthorities:--\r\n\r\n      Dr. Lindley.

They are preserved as striated,\r\njointed, cylindrical, or compressed stems, with fluted channels or\r\nfurrows at their sides, and sometimes surrounded by a bituminous\r\ncoating, the remains of a cortical integument. They were originally\r\nhollow, but the cavity is usually filled up with a substance into which\r\nthey themselves have been converted. They were divided into joints or\r\nsegments, and when broken across at their articulations they show a\r\nnumber of striæ, originating in the furrows of the sides, and turning\r\ninwards towards the centre of the stem. It is not known whether this\r\nstructure was connected with an imperfect diaphragm stretched across the\r\nhollow of the stem at each joint, or merely represented the ends of\r\nwoody plates of which the solid part of the stem is composed. Their\r\nextremities have been discovered to taper gradually to a point, as\r\nrepresented in _C. cannæformis_ (Fig. 64), or to end abruptly, the\r\nintervals becoming shorter and smaller. The obtuse point is now found to\r\nbe the root. Calamites are regarded as Equisetaceous plants; later\r\nbotanists consider that they belong to an extinct family of plants.\r\n_Sigillariæ_ are the most abundant of all plants in the coal formation,\r\nand were those principally concerned in the accumulation of the mineral\r\nfuel of the Coal-measures. Not a mine is opened, nor a heap of shale\r\nthrown out, but there occur fragments of its stem, marked externally\r\nwith small rounded impressions, and in the centre slight tubercles, with\r\na quincuncial arrangement. From the tubercles arise long ribbon-shaped\r\nbodies, which have been traced in some instances to the length of twenty\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63.--Sphenophyllum restored.]\r\n\r\nIn the family of the Sigillarias we have already presented the bark of\r\n_S. lævigata_, at page 138; on page 157 we give a drawing of the bark of\r\n_S. reniformis_, one-third the natural size (Fig. 65).\r\n\r\nIn the family of the Asterophyllites, the leaf of _A. foliosa_ (Fig.\r\n66); and the foliage of _Annularia orifolia_ (Fig. 67) are remarkable.\r\nIn addition to these, we present, in Fig. 63, a restoration of one of\r\nthese Asterophyllites, the _Sphenophyllum_, after M. Eugene\r\nDeslongchamps. This herbaceous tree, like the Calamites, would present\r\nthe appearance of an immense asparagus, twenty-five to thirty feet high.\r\nIt is represented here with its branches and _fronds_, which bear some\r\nresemblance to the leaves of the ginkgo. The bud, as represented in the\r\nfigure, is terminal, and not axillary, as in some of the Calamites.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64.--Calamites cannæformis. One-third natural size.]\r\n\r\nIf, during the Coal-period, the vegetable kingdom had reached its\r\nmaximum, the animal kingdom, on the contrary, was poorly represented.\r\nSome remains have been found, both in America and Germany, consisting of\r\nportions of the skeleton and the impressions of the footsteps of a\r\nReptile, which has received the name of Archegosaurus. In Fig. 68 is\r\nrepresented the head and neck of _Archegosaurus minor_, found in 1847 in\r\nthe coal-basin of Saarbruck between Strasbourg and Trèves. Among the\r\nanimals of this period we find a few Fishes, analogous to those of the\r\nDevonian formation. These are the _Holoptychius_ and _Megalichthys_,\r\nhaving jaw-bones armed with enormous teeth. Scales of _Pygopterus_\r\nhave been found in the Northumberland Coal-shale at Newsham Colliery,\r\nand also in the Staffordshire Coal-shale. Some winged insects would\r\nprobably join this slender group of living beings. It may then be said\r\nwith truth that the immense forests and marshy plains, crowded with\r\ntrees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants, which formed on the innumerable\r\nisles of the period a thick and tufted sward, were almost destitute of\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XI.--Ideal view of a marshy forest of the Coal Period.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65.--Sigillaria reniformis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66.--Asterophyllites foliosa.]\r\n\r\nOn the opposite page (PL. XI.) M. Riou has attempted, under the\r\ndirections of M. Deslongchamps, to reproduce the aspect of Nature during\r\nthe period. A marsh and forest of the Coal-period are here represented,\r\nwith a short and thick vegetation, a sort of grass composed of\r\nherbaceous Fern and mare’s-tail. Several trees of forest-height raise\r\ntheir heads above this lacustrine vegetation.\r\n\r\nOn the left are seen the naked trunk of a _Lepidodendron_ and a\r\n_Sigillaria_, an arborescent Fern rising between the two trunks. At the\r\nfoot of these great trees an herbaceous Fern and a _Stigmaria_ appear,\r\nwhose long ramification of roots, provided with reproductive spores,\r\nextend to the water. On the right is the naked trunk of another\r\n_Sigillaria_, a tree whose foliage is altogether unknown, a\r\n_Sphenophyllum_, and a _Conifer_. It is difficult to describe with\r\nprecision the species of this last family, the impressions of which are,\r\nnevertheless, very abundant in the Coal-measures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67.--Annularia orifolia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68.--Head and neck of Archegosaurus minor.]\r\n\r\nIn front of this group we see two trunks broken and overthrown. These\r\nare a _Lepidodendron_ and _Sigillaria_, mingling with a heap of\r\nvegetable débris in course of decomposition, from which a rich humus\r\nwill be formed, upon which new generations of plants will soon develop\r\nthemselves. Some herbaceous Ferns and buds of _Calamites_ rise out of\r\nthe waters of the marsh.\r\n\r\nA few Fishes belonging to the period swim on the surface of the water,\r\nand the aquatic reptile _Archegosaurus_ shows its long and pointed\r\nhead--the only part of the animal which has hitherto been discovered\r\n(Fig. 68). A _Stigmaria_ extends its roots into the water, and the\r\npretty _Asterophyllites_, with its finely-cut stems, rises above it in\r\nthe foreground.\r\n\r\nA forest, composed of _Lepidodendra_ and _Calamites_, forms the\r\nbackground to the picture.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF BEDS OF COAL.\r\n\r\nCoal, as we have said, is only the result of a partial decomposition of\r\nthe plants which covered the earth during a geological period of immense\r\nduration. No one, now, has any doubt that this is its origin. In\r\ncoal-mines it is not unusual to find fragments of the very plants whose\r\ntrunks and leaves characterise the Coal-measures, or Carboniferous era.\r\nImmense trunks of trees have also been met with in the middle of a seam\r\nof coal. In the coal-mines of Treuil,[44] at St. Etienne, for instance,\r\nvertical trunks of fossil trees, resembling bamboos or large Equiseta,\r\nare not only mixed with the coal, but stand erect, traversing the\r\noverlying beds of micaceous sandstone in the manner represented in the\r\nengraving, which has been reproduced from a drawing by M. Ad. Brongniart\r\n(Fig. 69).\r\n\r\n  [44] “Elements of Geology,” p. 480.\r\n\r\nIn England it is the same; entire trees are found lying across the\r\ncoal-beds. Sir Charles Lyell tells us[45] that in Parkfield Colliery,\r\nSouth Staffordshire, there was discovered in 1854, upon a surface of\r\nabout a quarter of an acre, a bed of coal which has furnished as many as\r\nseventy-three stumps of trees with their roots attached, some of the\r\nformer measuring more than eight feet in circumference; their roots\r\nformed part of a seam of coal ten inches thick, resting on a layer of\r\nclay two inches thick, under which was a second forest resting on a band\r\nof coal from two to five feet thick. Underneath this, again, was a third\r\nforest, with large stumps of _Lepidodendra_, _Calamites_, and other\r\ntrees.[46]\r\n\r\n  [45] Ibid, p. 479.\r\n\r\n  [46] Ibid, p. 479.\r\n\r\nIn the lofty cliffs of the South Joggins, in the Bay of Fundy, in Nova\r\nScotia, Sir Charles Lyell found in one portion of the coal-field 1,500\r\nfeet thick, as many as sixty-eight different surfaces, presenting\r\nevident traces of as many old soils of forests, where the trunks of the\r\ntrees were still furnished with roots.[47]\r\n\r\n  [47] Ibid, p. 483.\r\n\r\nWe will endeavour to establish here the true geological origin of coal,\r\nin order that no doubt may exist in the minds of our readers on a\r\nsubject of such importance. In order to explain the presence of coal in\r\nthe depths of the earth, there are only two possible hypotheses. This\r\nvegetable débris may either result from the burying of plants brought\r\nfrom afar and transported by river or maritime currents, forming immense\r\nrafts, which may have grounded in different places and been covered\r\nsubsequently by sedimentary deposits; or the trees may have grown on the\r\nspot where they perished, and where they are now found. Let us examine\r\neach of these theories.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69.--Treuil coal-mine, at St. Etienne.]\r\n\r\nCan the coal-beds result from the transport by water, and burial\r\nunderground, of immense rafts formed of the trunks of trees? The\r\nhypothesis has against it the enormous height which must be conceded to\r\nthe raft, in order to form coal-seams as thick as some of those which\r\nare worked in our collieries. If we take into consideration the specific\r\ngravity of wood, and the amount of carbon it contains, we find that the\r\ncoal-deposits can only be about seven-hundredths of the volume of the\r\noriginal wood and other vegetable materials from which they are formed.\r\nIf we take into account, besides, the numerous voids necessarily arising\r\nfrom the loose packing of the materials forming the supposed raft, as\r\ncompared with the compactness of coal, this may fairly be reduced to\r\nfive-hundredths. A bed of coal, for instance, sixteen feet thick, would\r\nhave required a raft 310 feet high for its formation. These\r\naccumulations of wood could never have arranged themselves with\r\nsufficient regularity to form those well-stratified coal-beds,\r\nmaintaining a uniform thickness over many miles, and that are seen in\r\nmost coal-fields to lie one above another in succession, separated by\r\nbeds of sandstone or shale. And even admitting the possibility of a slow\r\nand gradual accumulation of vegetable débris, like that which reaches\r\nthe mouth of a river, would not the plants in that case be buried in\r\ngreat quantities of mud and earth? Now, in most of our coal-beds the\r\nproportion of earthy matter does not exceed fifteen per cent. of the\r\nentire mass. If we bear in mind, finally, the remarkable parallelism\r\nexisting in the stratification of the coal-formation, and the state of\r\npreservation in which the impressions of the most delicate vegetable\r\nforms are discovered, it will, we think, be proved to demonstration,\r\nthat those coal-seams have been formed in perfect tranquillity. We are,\r\nthen, forced to the conclusion that coal results from the mineralisation\r\nof plants which has taken place on the spot; that is to say, in the very\r\nplace where the plants lived and died.\r\n\r\nIt was suggested long ago by Bakewell, from the occurrence of the same\r\npeculiar kind of fireclay under each bed of coal, that it was the soil\r\nproper for the production of those plants from which coal has been\r\nformed.[48]\r\n\r\n  [48] “Introduction to Geology,” by Robert Bakewell, 5th ed., p. 179.\r\n       1838.\r\n\r\nIt has, also, been pointed out by Sir William Logan, as the result of\r\nhis observations in the South Wales coal-field, and afterwards by Sir\r\nHenry De la Beche, and subsequently confirmed by the observations of Sir\r\nCharles Lyell in America, that not only in this country, but in the\r\ncoal-fields of Nova Scotia, the United States, &c., every layer of true\r\ncoal is co-extensive with and invariably underlaid by a marked stratum\r\nof arenaceous clay of greater or less thickness, which, from its\r\nposition relatively to the coal has been long known to coal-miners,\r\namong other terms, by the name of _under-clay_.\r\n\r\nThe clay-beds, “which vary in thickness from a few inches to more than\r\nten feet, are penetrated in all directions by a confused and tangled\r\ncollection of the roots and leaves, as they may be, of the _Stigmaria\r\nficoides_, these being frequently traceable to the main stem\r\n(_Sigillaria_), which varies in diameter from about two inches to half a\r\nfoot. The main stems are noticed as occurring nearer the top than the\r\nbottom of the bed, as usually of considerable length, the leaves or\r\nroots radiating from them in a tortuous irregular course to considerable\r\ndistances, and as so mingled with the under-clay that it is not possible\r\nto cut out a cubic foot of it which does not contain portions of the\r\nplant.” (Logan “On the Characters of the Beds of Clay immediately below\r\nthe Coal-seams of South Wales,” Geol. Transactions, Second Series, vol.\r\nvi., pp. 491-2. An account of these beds had previously been published\r\nby Mr. Logan in the Annual Report of the Royal Institution of South\r\nWales for 1839.)\r\n\r\nFrom the circumstance of the main stem of the Sigillaria, of which the\r\n_Stigmaria ficoides_ have been traced to be merely a continuation, it\r\nwas inferred by the above-mentioned authors, and has subsequently been\r\ngenerally recognised as probably the truth, that the roots found in the\r\nunderclay are merely those of the plant (_Sigillaria_), the stem of\r\nwhich is met with in the overlying coal-beds--in fact, that the\r\n_Stigmaria ficoides_ is only the root of the _Sigillaria_, and not a\r\ndistinct plant, as was once supposed to be the case.\r\n\r\nThis being granted, it is a natural inference to suppose that the\r\npresent indurated under-clay is only another condition of that soft,\r\nsilty soil, or of that finely levigated muddy sediment--most likely of\r\nstill and shallow water--in which the vegetation grew, the remains of\r\nwhich were afterwards carbonised and converted into coal.[49]\r\n\r\n  [49] For the opinions respecting the _Stigmaria ficoides_, see a\r\n       Memoir on “The Formation of the Rocks in South Wales and\r\n       South-Western England,” by Sir Henry T. De la Beche, F.R.S., in\r\n       the “Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Great Britain,” vol. i.,\r\n       p. 149.\r\n\r\nIn order thoroughly to comprehend the phenomena of the transformation\r\ninto coal of the forests and of the herbaceous plants which filled the\r\nmarshes and swamps of the ancient world, there is another consideration\r\nto be presented. During the coal-period, the terrestrial crust was\r\nsubjected to alternate movements of elevation and depression of the\r\ninternal liquid mass, under the impulse of the solar and lunar\r\nattractions to which they would be subject, as our seas are now, giving\r\nrise to a sort of subterranean tide, operating at intervals, more or\r\nless widely apart, upon the weaker parts of the crust, and producing\r\nconsiderable subsidences of the ground. It might, perhaps, happen that,\r\nin consequence of a subsidence produced in such a manner, the vegetation\r\nof the coal-period would be submerged, and the shrubs and plants which\r\ncovered the surface of the earth would finally become buried under\r\nwater. After this submergence new forests sprung up in the same place.\r\nOwing to another submergence, the second forests were depressed in their\r\nturn, and again covered by water. It is probably by a series of\r\nrepetitions of this double phenomenon--this submergence of whole regions\r\nof forest, and the development upon the same site of new growths of\r\nvegetation--that the enormous accumulations of semi-decomposed plants,\r\nwhich constitute the Coal-measures, have been formed in a long series of\r\nages.\r\n\r\nBut, has coal been produced from the larger plants only--for example,\r\nfrom the great forest-trees of the period, such as the Lepidodendra,\r\nSigillariæ, Calamites, and Sphenophylla? That is scarcely probable, for\r\nmany coal-deposits contain no vestiges of the great trees of the period,\r\nbut only of Ferns and other herbaceous plants of small size. It is,\r\ntherefore, presumable that the larger vegetation has been almost\r\nunconnected with the formation of coal, or, at least, that it has played\r\na minor part in its production. In all probability there existed in the\r\ncoal-period, as at the present time, two distinct kinds of vegetation:\r\none formed of lofty forest-trees, growing on the higher grounds; the\r\nother, herbaceous and aquatic plants, growing on marshy plains. It is\r\nthe latter kind of vegetation, probably, which has mostly furnished the\r\nmaterial for the coal; in the same way that marsh-plants have, during\r\nhistoric times and up to the present day, supplied our existing peat,\r\nwhich may be regarded as a sort of contemporaneous incipient coal.\r\n\r\nTo what modification has the vegetation of the ancient world been\r\nsubjected to attain that carbonised state, which constitutes coal? The\r\nsubmerged plants would, at first, be a light, spongy mass, in all\r\nrespects resembling the peat-moss of our moors and marshes. While under\r\nwater, and afterwards, when covered with sediment, these vegetable\r\nmasses underwent a partial decomposition--a moist, putrefactive\r\nfermentation, accompanied by the production of much carburetted hydrogen\r\nand carbonic acid gas. In this way, the hydrogen escaping in the form of\r\ncarburetted hydrogen, and the oxygen in the form of carbonic acid gas,\r\nthe carbon became more concentrated, and coal was ultimately formed.\r\nThis emission of carburetted hydrogen gas would, probably, continue\r\nafter the peat-beds were buried beneath the strata which were deposited\r\nand accumulated upon them. The mere weight and pressure of the\r\nsuperincumbent mass, continued at an increasing ratio during a long\r\nseries of ages, have given to the coal its density and compact state.\r\n\r\nThe heat emanating from the interior of the globe would, also, exercise\r\na great influence upon the final result. It is to these two causes--that\r\nis to say, to pressure and to the central heat--that we may attribute\r\nthe differences which exist in the mineral characters of various kinds\r\nof coal. The inferior beds are _drier_ and more compact than the upper\r\nones; or less bituminous, because their mineralisation has been\r\ncompleted under the influence of a higher temperature, and at the same\r\ntime under a greater pressure.\r\n\r\nAn experiment, attempted for the first time in 1833, at Sain-Bel,\r\nafterwards repeated by M. Cagniard de la Tour, and completed at\r\nSaint-Etienne by M. Baroulier in 1858, fully demonstrates the process by\r\nwhich coal was formed. These gentlemen succeeded in producing a very\r\ncompact coal artificially, by subjecting wood and other vegetable\r\nsubstances to the double influence of heat and pressure combined.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus employed for this experiment by M. Baroulier, at\r\nSaint-Etienne, allowed the exposure of the strongly compressed vegetable\r\nmatter enveloped in moist clay, to the influence of a long-continued\r\ntemperature of from 200° to 300° Centigrade. This apparatus, without\r\nbeing absolutely closed, offered obstacles to the escape of gases or\r\nvapours in such a manner that the decomposition of the organic matters\r\ntook place in the medium saturated with moisture, and under a pressure\r\nwhich prevented the escape of the elements of which it was composed. By\r\nplacing in these conditions the sawdust of various kinds of wood,\r\nproducts were obtained which resembled in many respects, sometimes\r\nbrilliant shining coal, and at others a dull coal. These differences,\r\nmoreover, varied with the conditions of the experiment and the nature of\r\nthe wood employed; thus explaining the striped appearance of coal when\r\ncomposed alternately of shining and dull veins.\r\n\r\nWhen the stems and leaves of ferns are compressed between beds of clay\r\nor pozzuolana, they are decomposed by the pressure only, and form on\r\nthese blocks a carbonaceous layer, and impressions bearing a close\r\nresemblance to those which blocks of coal frequently exhibit. These\r\nlast-mentioned experiments, which were first made by Dr. Tyndall, leave\r\nno room for doubt that coal has been formed from the plants of the\r\nancient world.\r\n\r\nPassing from these speculations to the Coal-measures:--\r\n\r\nThis formation is composed of a succession of beds, of various\r\nthicknesses, consisting of sandstones or gritstones, of clays and\r\nshales, sometimes so bituminous as to be inflammable--and passing, in\r\nshort, into an imperfect kind of _coal_. These rocks are interstratified\r\nwith each other in such a manner that they may consist of many\r\nalterations. Carbonate of protoxide of iron (clay-ironstone) may also\r\nbe considered a constituent of this formation; its extensive\r\ndissemination in connection with coal in some parts of Great Britain has\r\nbeen of immense advantage to the ironworks of this country, in many\r\nparts of which blast-furnaces for the manufacture of iron rise by\r\nhundreds alongside of the coal-pits from which they are fed. In France,\r\nas is frequently the case in England, this argillaceous iron-ore only\r\noccurs in nodules or lenticular masses, much interrupted; so that it\r\nbecomes necessary in that country, as in this, to find other ores of\r\niron to supply the wants of the foundries. Fig. 70 gives an idea of the\r\nordinary arrangement of the coal-beds, one of which is seen\r\ninterstratified between two parallel and nearly horizontal beds of\r\nargillaceous shale, containing nodules of clay iron-ore--a disposition\r\nvery common in English collieries. The coal-basin of Aveyron, in France,\r\npresents an analogous mode of occurrence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70.--Stratification of coal-beds.]\r\n\r\nThe frequent presence of carbonate of iron in the coal-measures is a\r\nmost fortunate circumstance for mining industry. When the miner finds,\r\nin the same spot, the ore of iron and the fuel required for smelting it,\r\narrangements for working them can be established under the most\r\nfavourable conditions. Such is the case in the coal-fields of Great\r\nBritain, and also in France to a less extent--that is to say, only at\r\nSaint-Etienne and Alais.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the Coal-measures, in various parts of the world, may be\r\nbriefly and approximately stated as follows:--\r\n\r\nESTIMATED AREA OF THE COAL-MEASURES OF THE WORLD.\r\n\r\n                                                         Square Miles.\r\n\r\n  United States                                220,166 }    420,166\r\n        „       Lignites and inferior Coals    200,000 }\r\n  British Possessions in North America                        2,200\r\n  Great Britain                                               3,000\r\n  France                                                      2,000\r\n  Belgium                                                       468\r\n  Rhenish Prussia and Saarbrück                               1,550\r\n  Westphalia                                                    400\r\n  Bohemia                                                       620\r\n  Saxony                                                         66\r\n  The Asturias, in Spain                                        310\r\n  Russia                                                     11,000\r\n  Islands of the Pacific and Indian Ocean                   Unknown.\r\n\r\nThe American continent, then, contains much more extensive coal-fields\r\nthan Europe; it possesses very nearly two square miles of coal-fields\r\nfor every five miles of its surface; but it must be added that these\r\nimmense fields of coal have not, hitherto, been productive in proportion\r\nto their extent. The following Table represents the annual produce of\r\nthe collieries of America and Europe:--\r\n\r\n                                           Tons.\r\n\r\n  British Islands        (in 1870)      110,431,192\r\n  United States                          14,593,659\r\n  Belgium                (in 1870)       13,697,118\r\n  France                 (in 1864)       10,000,000\r\n    „                    (in 1866)       11,807,142\r\n  Prussia                (in 1864)       21,197,266\r\n  Nassau                 (in 1864)        2,345,459\r\n  Netherlands            (in 1864)           24,815\r\n  Austria                (in 1864)        4,589,014\r\n  Spain                                     500,000\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the United States holds a secondary place as a\r\ncoal-producing country; raising one-eleventh part of the out-put of the\r\nwhole of Europe, and about one-eighth part of the quantity produced by\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nThe Coal-measures of England and Scotland cover a large area; and\r\nattempts have been made to estimate the quantity of fuel they contain.\r\nThe estimate made by the Royal Commission on the coal in the United\r\nKingdom may be considered as the nearest; and, in this Report, lately\r\npublished, it is stated that in the ascertained coal-fields of the\r\nUnited Kingdom there is an aggregate quantity of 146,480,000,000 tons of\r\ncoal, which may be reasonably expected to be available for use. In the\r\ncoal-field of South Wales, ascertained by actual measurement to attain\r\nthe extraordinary thickness of 11,000 feet of Coal-measures, there are\r\n100 different seams of coal, affording an aggregate thickness of 120\r\nfeet, mostly in thin beds, but varying from six inches to more than ten\r\nfeet. Professor J. Phillips estimates the thickness of the coal-bearing\r\nstrata of the north of England at 3,000 feet; but these, in common with\r\nall other coal-fields, contain, along with many beds of the mineral in a\r\nmore or less pure state, interstratified beds of sandstones, shales, and\r\nlimestone; the real coal-seams, to the number of twenty or thirty, not\r\nexceeding sixty feet in thickness in the aggregate. The Scottish\r\nCoal-measures have a thickness of 3,000 feet, with similar\r\nintercalations of other carboniferous rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71.--Contortions of Coal-beds.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72.--Cycas circinalis (living form).]\r\n\r\nThe coal-basin of Belgium and of the north of France forms a nearly\r\ncontinuous zone from Liége, Namur, Charleroi, and Mons, to Valenciennes,\r\nDouai, and Béthune. The beds of coal there are from fifty to one hundred\r\nand ten in number, and their thickness varies from ten inches to six\r\nfeet. Some coal-fields which are situated beneath the Secondary\r\nformations of the centre and south of France possess beds fewer in\r\nnumber, but individually thicker and less regularly stratified. The two\r\nbasins of the Saône-et-Loire, the principal mines of which are at\r\nCreuzot, Blanzy, Montchanin, and Epinac, only contain ten beds; but some\r\nof these (as at Montchanin) attain 30, 100, and even 130 feet in\r\nthickness. The coal-basin of the Loire is that which contains the\r\ngreatest total thickness of coal-beds: the seams there are twenty-five\r\nin number. After those of the North--of the Saône-et-Loire and of the\r\nLoire--the principal basins in France are those of the Allier, where\r\nvery important beds are worked at Commentry and Bezenet; the basin of\r\nBrassac, which commences at the confluence of the Allier and the\r\nAlagnon; the basin of the Aveyron, known by the collieries of\r\nDecazeville and Aubin; the basin of the Gard, and of Grand’-Combe.\r\nBesides these principal basins, there are a great many others of\r\nscarcely less importance, which yield annually to France from six to\r\nseven million tons of coal.\r\n\r\nThe seams of coal are rarely found in the horizontal position in which\r\ntheir original formation took place. They have been since much crumpled\r\nand distorted, forced into basin-shaped cavities, with minor\r\nundulations, and affected by numerous flexures and other disturbances.\r\nThey are frequently found broken up and distorted by faults, and even\r\nfolded back on themselves into zigzag forms, as represented in the\r\nengraving (Fig. 71, p. 167), which is a mode of occurrence common in all\r\nthe Coal-measures of Somersetshire and in the basins of Belgium and the\r\nnorth of France. Vertical pits, sunk on coal which has been subjected to\r\nthis kind of contortion and disturbance, sometimes traverse the same\r\nbeds many times.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERMIAN PERIOD.\r\n\r\nThe name “Permian” was proposed by Sir Roderick I. Murchison, in the\r\nyear 1841, for certain deposits which are now known to terminate upwards\r\nthe great primeval or Palæozoic Series.[50]\r\n\r\n  [50] See “Siluria,” p. 14. _Philosophical Mag._, 3rd series, vol.\r\n       xix., p. 419.\r\n\r\nThis natural group consists, in descending order, in Germany, of the\r\nZechstein, the Kupfer-schiefer, Roth-liegende, &c. In England it is\r\nusually divided into Magnesian Limestone or Zechstein, with subordinate\r\nMarl-slate or Kupfer-schiefer, and Rothliegende. The chief calcareous\r\nmember of this group of strata is termed in Germany the “Zechstein,” in\r\nEngland the “Magnesian Limestone;” but, as magnesian limestones have\r\nbeen produced at many geological periods, and as the German Zechstein is\r\nonly a part of a group, the other members of which are known as\r\n“Kupfer-schiefer” (“copper-slate”), “Roth-todt-liegende” (the “Lower New\r\nRed” of English geologists), &c., it was manifest that a single name for\r\nthe whole was much needed. Finding, in his examination of Russia in\r\nEurope, that this group was a great and united physical series of marls,\r\nlimestones, sandstones, and conglomerates, occupying a region much\r\nlarger than France, and of which the Government of Perm formed a central\r\npart, Sir Roderick proposed that the name of Permian, now in general\r\nuse, should be thereto applied.\r\n\r\nExtended researches have shown, from the character of its embedded\r\norganic remains, that it is closely allied to, but distinct from, the\r\ncarboniferous strata below it, and is entirely distinct from the\r\noverlying Trias, or New Red Sandstone, which forms the base of the great\r\nseries of the Secondary rocks.\r\n\r\nGeology is, however, not only indebted to Sir Roderick Murchison for\r\nthis classification and nomenclature, but also to him, in conjunction\r\nwith Professor Sedgwick, for the name “_Devonian_,” as an equivalent to\r\n“Old Red Sandstone;” whilst every geologist knows that Sir R. Murchison\r\nis the sole author of the SILURIAN SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XII.--Ideal landscape of the Permian Period.]\r\n\r\nThe Permian rocks have of late years assumed great interest,\r\nparticularly in England, in consequence of the evidence their correct\r\ndetermination affords with regard to the probable extent, beneath them,\r\nof the coal-bearing strata which they overlie and conceal; thus tending\r\nto throw a light upon the duration of our coal-fields, one of the most\r\nimportant questions of the day in connection with our industrial\r\nresources and national prosperity.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite page an ideal view of the earth during the Permian\r\nperiod is represented (PL. XII.). In the background, on the right, is\r\nseen a series of syenitic and porphyritic domes, recently thrown up;\r\nwhile a mass of steam and vapour rises in columns from the midst of the\r\nsea, resulting from the heat given out by the porphyries and syenites.\r\nHaving attained a certain height in the cooler atmosphere, the columns\r\nof steam become condensed and fall in torrents of rain. The evaporation\r\nof water in such vast masses being necessarily accompanied by an\r\nenormous disengagement of electricity, this imposing scene of the\r\nprimitive world is illuminated by brilliant flashes of lightning,\r\naccompanied by reverberating peals of thunder. In the foreground, on the\r\nright, rise groups of Tree-ferns, Lepidodendra, and Walchias, of the\r\npreceding period. On the sea-shore, and left exposed by the retiring\r\ntide, are Molluscs and Zoophytes peculiar to the period, such as\r\n_Producta_, _Spirifera_, and _Encrinites_; pretty plants--the\r\n_Asterophyllites_--which we have noticed in our description of the\r\nCarboniferous age, are growing at the water’s edge, not far from the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nDuring the Permian period the species of plants and animals were nearly\r\nthe same as those already described as belonging to the Carboniferous\r\nperiod. Footprints of reptilian animals have been found in the Permian\r\nbeds near Kenilworth, in the red sandstones of that age in the Vale of\r\nEden, and in the sandstones of Corncockle Moor, and other parts of\r\nDumfriesshire. These footprints, together with the occurrence of\r\ncurrent-markings or ripplings, sun-cracks, and the pittings of\r\nrain-drops impressed on the surfaces of the beds, indicate that they\r\nwere made upon damp surfaces, which afterwards became dried by the sun\r\nbefore the flooded waters covered them with fresh deposits of sediment,\r\nin the way that now happens during variations of the seasons in many\r\nsalt lakes.[51] M. Ad. Brongniart has described the forms of the Permian\r\nflora as being intermediate between those of the Carboniferous period\r\nand of that which succeeds it.\r\n\r\n  [51] A. C. Ramsay, “On the Red Rocks of England.” _Quart. Jour. Geol.\r\n       Soc._, vol. xxvii., p. 246.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Permian flora indicates a climate similar to that which\r\nprevailed during the Carboniferous period, it has been pointed out by\r\nProfessor Ramsay, as long ago as 1855, that the Permian breccia of\r\nShropshire, Worcestershire, &c., affords strong proofs of being the\r\nresult of direct glacial action, and of the consequent existence at the\r\nperiod of glaciers and icebergs.\r\n\r\nThat such a state of things is not inconsistent with the prevalence of a\r\nmoist, equable, and temperate climate, necessary for the preservation of\r\na luxuriant flora like that of the period in question, is shown in New\r\nZealand; where, with a climate and vegetation approximating to those of\r\nthe Carboniferous period, there are also glaciers at the present day in\r\nthe southern island.\r\n\r\nProfessor King has published a valuable memoir on the Permian fossils of\r\nEngland, in the Proceedings of the Palæontographical Society, in which\r\nthe following Table is given (in descending order) of the Permian system\r\nof the North of England, as compared with that of Thuringia:--\r\n\r\n    NORTH OF ENGLAND.

Lower sandstones, and }  6. Todteliegende       { gypsum and white\r\n  sands of various colours }                         { salt.\r\n\r\nAt the base of the system lies a band of _lower sandstone_ (No. 6) of\r\nvarious colours, separating the Magnesian Limestone from the coal in\r\nYorkshire and Durham; sometimes associated with red marl and gypsum, but\r\nwith the same obscure relations in all these beds which usually attend\r\nthe close of one series and the commencement of another; the imbedded\r\nplants being, in some cases, stated to be identical with those of the\r\nCarboniferous series. In Thuringia the _Rothliegende_, or _red-lyer_, a\r\ngreat deposit of red sandstone and conglomerate, associated with\r\nporphyry, basaltic trap, and amygdaloid, lies at the base of the system.\r\nAmong the fossils of this age are the silicified trunks of Tree-ferns\r\n(_Psaronius_), the bark of which is surrounded by dense masses of\r\nair-roots, which often double or quadruple the diameter of the original\r\nstem; in this respect bearing a strong resemblance to the living\r\narborescent ferns of New Zealand.\r\n\r\nThe marl-slate (No. 5) consists of hard calcareous shales,\r\nmarl-slates, and thin-bedded limestone, the whole nearly thirty\r\nfeet thick in Durham, and yielding many fine specimens of Ganoid and\r\nPlacoid fishes--_Palæoniscus_, _Pygopterus_, _Cœlacanthus_, and\r\n_Platysomus_--genera which all belong to the Carboniferous system, and\r\nwhich Professor King thinks probably lived at no great distance from the\r\nshore; but the Permian species of the marl-slate of England are\r\nidentical with those of the copper-slate of Thuringia. Agassiz was the\r\nfirst to point out a remarkable peculiarity in the forms of the fishes\r\nwhich lived before and after this period. In most living fishes the\r\ntrunk seems to terminate in the middle of the root of the tail, whose\r\nfree margin is “homocercal” (even-tail), that is, either rounded, or, if\r\nforked, divided into two equal lobes. In Palæoniscus, and most Palæozoic\r\nfishes, the axis of the body is continued into the upper lobe of the\r\ntail, which is thus rendered unsymmetrical, as in the living sharks and\r\nsturgeons. The latter form, which Agassiz termed “heterocercal”\r\n(unequal-tail) is only in a very general way distinctive of Palæozoic\r\nfishes, since this asymmetry exists, though in a minor degree, in many\r\nliving genera besides those just mentioned. The compact limestone (No.\r\n4) is rich in Polyzoa. The fossiliferous limestone (No. 3), Mr. King\r\nconsiders, is a deep-water formation, from the numerous Polyzoa which it\r\ncontains. One of these, _Fenestella retiformis_, found in the Permian\r\nrocks of England and Germany, sometimes measures eight inches in width.\r\n\r\nMany species of Mollusca, and especially Brachiopoda, appear in the\r\nPermian seas of this age, _Spirifera_ and _Producta_ being the most\r\ncharacteristic.\r\n\r\nOther shells now occur, which have not been observed in strata newer\r\nthan the Permian. _Strophalosia_ (Fig. 73) is abundantly represented in\r\nthe Permian rocks of Germany, Russia, and England, and much more\r\nsparingly in the yellow magnesian limestone, accompanied by _Spirifera\r\nundulata_, &c. _S. Schlotheimii_ is widely disseminated both in England,\r\nGermany, and Russia, with _Lingula Credneri_, and other Palæozoic\r\nBrachiopoda. Here also we note the first appearance of the Oyster, but\r\nstill in small numbers. _Fenestella_ represents the Polyzoa. _Schizodus_\r\nhas been found by Mr. Binney in the Upper Red Permian Marls of\r\nManchester; but no shells of any kind have hitherto been met with in the\r\nRothliegende of Lancashire, or in the Vale of Eden.\r\n\r\nThe brecciated limestone (No. 2) and the concretionary masses (No. 1)\r\noverlying it (although Professor King has attempted to separate them)\r\nare considered by Professor Sedgwick as different forms of the same\r\nrock. They contain no foreign elements, but seem to be composed of\r\nfragments of the underlying limestone, No. 3. Some of the angular masses\r\nat Tynemouth cliff are two feet in diameter, and none of them are\r\nwater-worn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73.--Strophalosia Morrisiana.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74.--Cyrtoceras depressum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75.--Walchia Schlotheimii.]\r\n\r\nThe crystalline or concretionary limestone (No. 1) formation is seen\r\nupon the coast of Durham and Yorkshire, between the Wear and the Tees;\r\nand Mr. King thinks that the character of the shells and the absence of\r\ncorals indicate a deposit formed in shallow water.\r\n\r\nThe plants also found in some of the Permian strata indicate the\r\nneighbourhood of land. These are land species, and chiefly of genera\r\ncommon in the Coal-measures. Fragments of supposed coniferous wood\r\n(generally silicified) are occasionally met with in the Permian red beds\r\nof many parts of England.\r\n\r\nAmong the Ferns characteristic of the period may be mentioned\r\n_Sphenopteris dichotoma_ and _S. Artemisiæfolia_; _Pecopteris\r\nlonchitica_ and _Neuropteris gigantea_, figured on pp. 143, 144. “If we\r\nare,” says Lyell, “to draw a line between the Secondary and Primary\r\nfossiliferous strata, it must be run through the middle of what was once\r\ncalled the ‘New Red.’ The inferior half of this group will rank as\r\nPrimary or Palæozoic, while its upper member will form the base of the\r\nSecondary or Mesozoic series.”[52] Among the _Equiseta_ of the Permian\r\nformation of Saxony, Colonel Von Gutbier found _Calamites gigas_ and\r\nsixty species of fossil plants, most of them Ferns, forty of which have\r\nnot been found elsewhere. Among these are several species of _Walchia_,\r\na genus of Conifers, of which an example is given in Fig. 75.\r\n\r\n  [52] “Elements of Geology,” p. 456.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76.--Trigonocarpum Nöggerathii.]\r\n\r\nIn their stems, leaves, and cones, they bear some resemblance to the\r\n_Araucarias_, which have been introduced from North America into our\r\npleasure-grounds during the last half-century.\r\n\r\nAmong the genera enumerated by Colonel Von Gutbier are some fruits\r\ncalled _Cardiocarpon_, and _Asterophyllites_ and _Annularia_, so\r\ncharacteristic of the Carboniferous age. The Lepidodendron is also\r\ncommon to the Permian rocks of Saxony, Russia, and Thuringia; also the\r\n_Nöggerathia_, a family of large trees, intermediate between Cycads\r\n(Fig. 72) and the Conifers. The fruit of one of these is represented in\r\nFig 76.\r\n\r\nPERMIAN ROCKS.--We now give a sketch of the physiognomy of the earth in\r\nPermian times. Of what do the beds consist? What is the extent, and what\r\nis the mineralogical constitution of the rocks deposited in the seas of\r\nthe period? The Permian formation consists of three members, which are\r\nin descending order--\r\n\r\n1. Upper Permian sandstone, or Grès des Vosges; 2. Magnesian Limestone,\r\nor Zechstein; 3. Lower Red Sandstone, Marl-slate or Kupferschiefer, and\r\nRothliegende.\r\n\r\nThe _grès des Vosges_, usually of a red colour, and from 300 to 450 feet\r\nthick, composes all the southern part of the Vosges Mountains, where it\r\nforms frequent level summits, which are evidences of an ancient plain\r\nthat has been acted on by running water. It only contains a few\r\nvegetable remains.\r\n\r\nThe _Magnesian Limestone_, Pierre de mine, or Zechstein, so called in\r\nconsequence of the numerous metalliferous deposits met with in its\r\ndiverse beds, presents in France only a few insignificant fragments; but\r\nin Germany and England it attains the thickness of 450 feet. It is\r\ncomposed of a diversified mass of Magnesian Limestone, generally of a\r\nyellow colour, but sometimes red and brown, and bituminous clay, the\r\nlast black and fetid. The subordinate rocks consist of marl, gypsum, and\r\ninflammable bituminous schists. The beds of marl slate are remarkable\r\nfor the numbers of peculiar fossil fishes which they contain; and from\r\nthe occurrence of small proportions of argentiferous grey copper-ore,\r\nmet with in the bituminous shales which are worked in the district of\r\nMansfeld, in Thuringia--the latter are called _Kupferschiefer_ in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nThe _Lower Red Sandstone_, which attains a thickness of from 300 to 600\r\nfeet, is found over great part of Germany, in the Vosges, and in\r\nEngland. Its fossil remains are few and rare; they include silicified\r\ntrunks of Conifers, some impressions of Ferns, and Calamites.\r\n\r\nIn England the Permian strata, to a great extent, consist of red\r\nsandstones and marls; and the Magnesian Limestone of the northern\r\ncounties is also, though to a less degree, associated with red marls.\r\n\r\nIn Lancashire thin beds of Magnesian Limestone are interstratified with\r\nred marls in the upper Permian strata, beneath which there are soft Red\r\nSandstones, estimated by Mr. Hull to be about 1,500 feet thick. These\r\nare supposed to represent the Rothliegende, and no shells of any kind\r\nhave been found in them. The upper Permian beds, however, contain a few\r\nMagnesian Limestone species, such as _Gervillia antiqua_, _Pleurophorus\r\ncostatus_, _Schizodus obscurus_, and some others, but all small and\r\ndwarfed.\r\n\r\nThe coal-fields of North and South Staffordshire, Tamworth, Coalbrook\r\nDale, and of the Forest of Wyre, are partly bordered by Permian rocks,\r\nwhich lie unconformably on the Coal-measures; as is the case, also, in\r\nthe immediate neighbourhood of Manchester, where they skirt the borders\r\nof the main coal-field, and consist of the Lower Red Sandstone, resting\r\nunconformably on different parts of the Coal-measures, and overlaid by\r\nthe pebble-beds of the Trias.\r\n\r\nAt Stockport the Permian strata are stated by Mr. Hull to be more than\r\n1,500 feet thick.\r\n\r\nIn Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, and Derbyshire, the Permian strata are\r\nstated by Mr. Aveline to be divided into two chief groups: the\r\nRoth-liegende, of no great thickness, and the Magnesian Limestone\r\nseries; the latter being the largest and most important member of the\r\nPermian series in the northern counties of England. The Magnesian\r\nLimestone consists there of two great bands, separated by marls and\r\nsandstone, and quarried for building and for lime. In Derbyshire and\r\nYorkshire the magnesian limestone, under the name of Dolomite, forms an\r\nexcellent building-stone, which has been used in the construction of the\r\nHouses of Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn the midland counties and on the borders of Wales, the Permian section\r\nis different from that of Nottinghamshire and the North of England. The\r\nMagnesian Limestones are absent, and the rocks consist principally of\r\ndark-red marl, brown and red sandstones, and calcareous conglomerates\r\nand breccias, which are almost entirely unfossiliferous. In\r\nWarwickshire, where they rest conformably on the Coal-measures, they\r\noccupy a very considerable tract of country, and are of very great\r\nthickness, being estimated by Mr. Howell to be 2,000 feet thick.\r\n\r\nIn the east of England the Magnesian Limestone contains a numerous\r\nmarine fauna, but much restricted when compared with that of the\r\nCarboniferous period. The shells of the former are all small and dwarfed\r\nin size when compared with their congeners of Carboniferous times, when\r\nsuch there are, and in this respect, and the small number of genera,\r\nthey resemble the living mollusca of the still less numerous fauna of\r\nthe Caspian Sea.\r\n\r\nBesides the poverty and small size of the mollusca, the later strata of\r\nthe true Magnesian Limestone seem to afford strong indications that they\r\nmay have been deposited in a great inland salt-lake subject to\r\nevaporation.\r\n\r\nThe absence of fossils in much of the formation may be partly accounted\r\nfor by its deposition in great measure from solution, and the\r\nuncongenial nature of the waters of a salt-lake may account for the\r\npoverty-stricken character of the whole molluscan fauna.\r\n\r\nThe red colouring-matter of the Permian sandstones and marls is\r\nconsidered, by Professor Ramsay, to be due to carbonate of iron\r\nintroduced into the waters, and afterwards precipitated as peroxide\r\nthrough the oxidising action of the air and the escape of the carbonic\r\nacid which held it in solution. This circumstance of the red colour of\r\nthe Permian beds affords an indication that the red Permian strata were\r\ndeposited in inland waters unconnected with the main ocean, which waters\r\nmay have been salt or fresh as the case may be.\r\n\r\n“The Magnesian Limestone series of the east of England may, possibly,\r\nhave been connected directly with an open sea at the commencement of the\r\ndeposition of these strata, whatever its subsequent history may have\r\nbeen; for the fish of the marl strata have generically strong affinities\r\nwith those of Carboniferous age, some of which were truly marine, while\r\nothers certainly penetrated shallow lagoons bordered by peaty\r\nflats.”[53]\r\n\r\n  [53] “On the Red Rocks of England,” by A. C. Ramsay. _Quart. Jour.\r\n       Geol. Soc._, vol. xxvii., p. 246.\r\n\r\nThere is indisputable evidence that the Permian ocean covered an immense\r\narea of the globe. In the Permian period this ocean extended from\r\nIreland to the Ural mountains, and probably to Spitzbergen, with its\r\nnorthern boundary defined by the Carboniferous, Devonian, Silurian, and\r\nIgneous regions of Scotland, Scandinavia, and Northern Russia; and its\r\nsouthern boundaries apparently stretching far into the south of Europe\r\n(King). The chain of the Vosges, stretching across Rhenish Bavaria, the\r\nGrand Duchy of Baden, as far as Saxony and Silesia, would be under\r\nwater. They would communicate with the ocean, which covered all the\r\nmidland and western counties of England and part of Russia. In other\r\nparts of Europe the continent has varied very little since the preceding\r\nDevonian and Carboniferous ages. In France the central plateaux would\r\nform a great island, which extended towards the south, probably as far\r\nas the foot of the Pyrenees; another island would consist of the mass of\r\nBrittany. In Russia the continent would have extended itself\r\nconsiderably towards the east; finally, it is probable that, at the end\r\nof the Carboniferous period, the Belgian continent would stretch from\r\nthe Departments of the Pas-de-Calais and Du Nord, in France, and would\r\nextend up to and beyond the Rhine.\r\n\r\nIn England, the Silurian archipelago, now filled up and occupied by\r\ndeposits of the Devonian and Carboniferous systems, would be covered\r\nwith carboniferous vegetation; dry land would now extend, almost without\r\ninterruption, from Cape Wrath to the Land’s End; but, on its eastern\r\nshore, the great mass of the region now lying less than three degrees\r\nwest of Greenwich would, in a general sense, be under water, or form\r\nislands rising out of the sea. Alphonse Esquiros thus eloquently closes\r\nthe chapter of his work in which he treats of this formation in England:\r\n“We have seen seas, vast watery deserts, become populated; we have seen\r\nthe birth of the first land and its increase; ages succeeding each\r\nother, and Nature in its progress advancing among ruins; the ancient\r\ninhabitants of the sea, or at least their spoils, have been raised to\r\nthe summit of lofty mountains. In the midst of these vast cemeteries of\r\nthe primitive world we have met with the remains of millions of beings;\r\nentire species sacrificed to the development of life. Here terminates\r\nthe first mass of facts constituting the infancy of the British Islands.\r\nBut great changes are still to produce themselves on this portion of the\r\nearth’s surface.”\r\n\r\nHaving thus described the _Primary Epoch_, it may be useful, before\r\nentering on what is termed by geologists the _Secondary Epoch_, to\r\nglance backwards at the facts which we have had under consideration.\r\n\r\nIn this Primary period plants and animals appear for the first time\r\nupon the surface of the cooling globe. We have said that the seas of the\r\nepoch were then dominated by the fishes known as _Ganoids_ (from γανος,\r\n_glitter_), from the brilliant polish of the enamelled scales which\r\ncovered their bodies, sometimes in a very complicated and fantastic\r\nmanner; the _Trilobites_ are curious Crustaceans, which appear and\r\naltogether disappear in the Primary epoch; an immense quantity of\r\nMollusca, Cephalopoda, and Brachiopoda; the _Encrinites_, animals of\r\ncurious organisation, which form some of the most graceful ornaments of\r\nour Palæontological collections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77.--Lithostrotion. (Fossil Coral.)]\r\n\r\nBut, among all these beings, those which prevailed--those which were\r\ntruly the kings of the organic world--were the Fishes, and, above all,\r\nthe _Ganoids_, which have left no animated being behind them of similar\r\norganisation. Furnished with a sort of defensive armour, they seem to\r\nhave received from Nature this means of protection to ensure their\r\nexistence, and permit them to triumph over all the influences which\r\nthreatened them with destruction in the seas of the ancient world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78.--Rhyncholites, upper, side, and internal views.\r\n1, Side view (Muschelkalk of Luneville); 2, Upper view (same locality);\r\n3, Upper view (Lias of Lyme Regis); 4, Calcareous point of an under\r\nmandible, internal view, from Luneville. (Buckland.)]\r\n\r\nIn the Primary epoch the living creation was in its infancy. No Mammals\r\nthen roamed the forests; no bird had yet displayed its wings. Without\r\nMammals, therefore, there was no maternal instinct; none of the soft\r\naffections which are, with animals, as it were, the precursors of\r\nintelligence. Without birds, also, there could be no songs in the air.\r\nFishes, Mollusca, and Crustacea silently ploughed their way in the\r\ndepths of the sea, and the immovable Crinoid lived there. On the land we\r\nonly find a few marsh-frequenting Reptiles, of small size--forerunners\r\nof those monstrous Saurians which make their appearance in the Secondary\r\nepoch.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of the Primary epoch is chiefly of inferior organisation.\r\nWith a few plants of a higher order, that is to say, Dicotyledons,\r\nCalamites, Sigillarias, it was the Cryptogamia (also several species of\r\nFerns, the Lepidodendra, Lycopodiaceæ, and the Equisetaceæ, and some\r\ndoubtfully allied forms, termed Nöggerathia), then at their maximum of\r\ndevelopment, which formed the great mass of the vegetation.\r\n\r\nLet us also consider, in this short analysis, that during the epoch\r\nunder consideration, what we call _climate_ may not have existed. The\r\nsame animals and the same plants then lived in the polar regions as at\r\nthe equator. Since we find, in the Primary formations of the icy regions\r\nof Spitzbergen and Melville Islands, nearly the same fossils which we\r\nmeet with in these same rocks in the torrid zone, we must conclude that\r\nthe temperature at this epoch was uniform all over the globe, and that\r\nthe heat of the earth itself was sufficiently high to render\r\ninappreciable the calorific influence of the sun.\r\n\r\nDuring this same period the progressive cooling of the earth occasioned\r\nfrequent ruptures and dislocations of the ground; the terrestrial crust,\r\nin opening, afforded a passage for the rocks called _igneous_, such as\r\ngranite, afterwards to the porphyries and syenites, which poured slowly\r\nthrough these immense fissures, and formed mountains of granite and\r\nporphyry, or simple clefts, which subsequently became filled with oxides\r\nand metallic sulphides, forming what are now designated metallic veins.\r\nThe great mountain-range of Ben Nevis offers a striking example of the\r\nfirst of these phenomena; through the granite base a distinct natural\r\nsection can be traced of porphyry ejected through the granite, and of\r\nsyenite through the porphyry. These geological commotions (which\r\noccasioned, not over the whole extent of the earth, but only in certain\r\nplaces, great movements of the surface) would appear to have been more\r\nfrequent at the close of the Primary epoch; during the interval which\r\nforms the passage between the Primary and Secondary epochs; that is to\r\nsay, between the Permian and the Triassic periods. The phenomena of\r\neruptions, and the character of the rocks called eruptive, are treated\r\nof in a former chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79. _a_, Pentacrinites Briareus, reduced; _b_, the\r\nsame from the Lias of Lyme Regis; natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe convulsions and disturbances by which the surface of the earth was\r\nagitated did not extend, let it be noted, over the whole of its\r\ncircumference; the effects were partial and local. It would, then, be\r\nwrong to affirm, as is asserted by many modern geologists, that the\r\ndislocations of the crust and the agitations of the surface of the\r\nglobe extended to both hemispheres, resulting in the destruction of all\r\nliving creatures. The Fauna and Flora of the Permian period did not\r\ndiffer essentially from the Fauna and Flora of the Coal-measures, which\r\nshows that no general revolution occurred to disturb the entire globe\r\nbetween these two epochs. Here, then, as in all analogous cases, it is\r\nunnecessary to recur to any general cataclysm to explain the passage\r\nfrom one epoch to another. Have we not, almost in our our own day, seen\r\ncertain species of animals die out and disappear, without the least\r\ngeological revolution? Without speaking of the Beaver, which abounded\r\ntwo centuries ago on the banks of the Rhône, and in the Cévennes, which\r\nstill lived at Paris in the little river Bièvre in the middle ages, its\r\nexistence being now unknown in these latitudes, although it is still\r\nfound in America and other countries, we could cite many examples of\r\nanimals which have become extinct in times by no means remote from our\r\nown. Such are the _Dinornis_ and the _Epyornis_, colossal birds of New\r\nZealand and Madagascar, and the _Dodo_, which lived in the Isle of\r\nFrance in 1626. _Ursus spelæus_, _Cervus Megaceros_, _Bos primigenius_,\r\nare species of Bear, Deer, and Ox which were contemporary with man, but\r\nhave now become extinct. In France we no longer know the gigantic\r\nwood-stag, figured by the Romans on their monuments, and which they had\r\nbrought from England for the fine quality of its flesh. The Erymanthean\r\nboar, so widely dispersed during the ancient historical period, no\r\nlonger exists among our living races, any more than the Crocodiles\r\n_lacunosus_ and _laciniatus_ found by Geoffroy St.-Hilaire in the\r\ncatacombs of ancient Egypt. Many races of animals figured in the mosaics\r\nof Palestrina, engraved and painted along with species now actually\r\nexisting, are no longer found living in our days any more than are the\r\nLions with curly manes, which formerly existed in Syria, and perhaps\r\neven in Thessaly and the northern parts of Greece. From what happens in\r\nour own time, we may infer what has taken place in times antecedent to\r\nthe appearance of man; and the idea of successive cataclysms of the\r\nglobe, must be restrained within bounds. Must we imagine a series of\r\ngeological revolutions to account for the disappearance of animals which\r\nhave evidently become extinct in a natural way? What has come to pass in\r\nour days, it is reasonable to conclude, may have taken place in the\r\ntimes anterior to the appearance of man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80.--Terebellaria ramosissima. (Recent Coral.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECONDARY EPOCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the _Primary Epoch_ our globe would appear to have been chiefly\r\nappropriated to beings which lived in the waters--above all, to the\r\nCrustaceans and Fishes; during the _Secondary Epoch_ Reptiles seem to\r\nhave been its prevailing inhabitants. Animals of this class assumed\r\nastonishing dimensions, and would seem to have multiplied in a most\r\nsingular manner; they were, apparently, the kings of the earth. At the\r\nsame time, however, that the animal kingdom thus developed itself, the\r\nvegetation lost much of its importance.\r\n\r\nGeologists have agreed among themselves to divide the Secondary epoch\r\ninto three periods: 1, the _Cretaceous_; 2, the _Jurassic_; 3, the\r\n_Triassic_--a division which it is convenient to adopt.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIASSIC, OR NEW RED PERIOD.\r\n\r\nThis period has received the name of Triassic because the rocks of which\r\nit is composed, which are more fully developed in Germany than either in\r\nEngland or France, were called the Trias (or Triple Group), by German\r\nwriters, from its division into three groups, as follows, in descending\r\norder:--\r\n\r\n        ENGLAND.

Hull to be the general\r\nsuccession of the Triassic formation in the midland and north-western\r\ncounties of England, where it attains its greatest vertical development,\r\nthinning away in the direction of the mouth of the Thames:--\r\n\r\n                                                  Foreign Equivalents.\r\n                                                  --------------------\r\n    / NEW RED MARL.

The curious Crustaceans which we have described under the name of\r\n_Trilobites_ have disappeared; the molluscous Cephalopods and\r\nBrachiopods are here few in number, as are the Ganoid and Placoid\r\nFishes, whose existence also seems to have terminated during this\r\nperiod, and vegetation has undergone analogous changes. The cryptogamic\r\nplants, which reached their maximum in the Primary epoch, become now\r\nless numerous, while the Conifers experienced a certain extension. Some\r\nkinds of terrestrial animals have disappeared, but they are replaced by\r\ngenera as numerous as new. For the first time the Turtle appears in the\r\nbosom of the sea, and on the borders of lakes. The Saurian reptiles\r\nacquire a great development; they prepare the way for those enormous\r\nSaurians, which appear in the following period, whose skeletons present\r\nsuch vast proportions, and such a strange aspect, as to strike with\r\nastonishment all who contemplate their gigantic, and, so to speak,\r\nawe-inspiring remains.\r\n\r\nThe _Variegated Sandstone_, or Bunter, contains many vegetable, but few\r\nanimal, remains, although we constantly find imprints of the footsteps\r\nof the Labyrinthodon.\r\n\r\nThe lowest Bunter formation shows itself in France, in the Pyrenees,\r\naround the central plateau in the Var, and upon both flanks of the\r\nVosges mountains. It is represented in south-western and central\r\nGermany, in Belgium, in Switzerland, in Sardinia, in Spain, in Poland,\r\nin the Tyrol, in Bohemia, in Moravia, and in Russia. M. D’Orbigny\r\nstates, from his own observation, that it covers vast surfaces in the\r\nmountainous regions of Bolivia, in South America. It is recognised in\r\nthe United States, in Columbia, in the Great Antilles, and in Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe Bunter in France is reduced to the variegated sandstone, except\r\naround the Vosges, in the Var, and the Black Forest, where it is\r\naccompanied by the Muschelkalk. In Germany it furnishes building-stone\r\nof excellent quality; many great edifices, in particular the cathedrals,\r\nso much admired on the Rhine--such, for example, as those of Strasbourg\r\nand Fribourg--are constructed of this stone, the sombre tints of which\r\nsingularly relieve the grandeur and majesty of the Gothic architecture.\r\nWhole cities in Germany are built of the brownish-red stones drawn from\r\nits mottled sandstone quarries. In England, in Scotland, and in Ireland\r\nthis formation extends from north to south through the whole length of\r\nthe country. “This old land,” says Professor Ramsay,[54] “consisted in\r\ngreat part of what we now know as Wales, and the adjacent counties of\r\nHereford, Monmouth, and Shropshire; of part of Devon and Cornwall,\r\nCumberland, the Pennine chain, and all the mountainous parts of\r\nScotland. Around old Wales, and part of Cumberland, and probably all\r\nround and over great part of Devon and Cornwall, the New Red Sandstone\r\nwas deposited. Part, at least, of this oldest of the Secondary rocks was\r\nformed of the material of the older Palæozoic strata, that had then\r\nrisen above the surface of the water. The New Red Sandstone series\r\nconsists in its lower members of beds of red sandstone and conglomerate,\r\nmore than 1,000 feet thick, and above them are placed red and green\r\nmarls, chiefly red, which in Germany are called the Keuper strata, and\r\nin England the New Red Marl. These formations range from the mouth of\r\nthe Mersey, round the borders of Wales, to the estuary of the Severn,\r\neastwards into Warwickshire, and thence northwards into Yorkshire and\r\nNorthumberland, along the eastern border of the Magnesian Limestone.\r\nThey also form the bottom of the valley of the Eden, and skirt\r\nCumberland on the west; in the centre of England the unequal hardness of\r\nits sub-divisions sometimes giving rise to minor escarpments,\r\noverlooking plains and undulating grounds of softer strata.”\r\n\r\n  [54] “The Physical Geography and Geology of Great Britain,” 2nd ed.,\r\n       p. 60.\r\n\r\n“Different members of the group rest in England, in some region or\r\nother,” says Lyell, “on almost every principal member of the Palæozoic\r\nseries, on Cambrian, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian\r\nrocks; and there is evidence everywhere of disturbance, contortion,\r\npartial upheaval into land, and vast denudations which the older rocks\r\nunderwent before and during the deposition of the successive strata of\r\nthe New Red Sandstone group.” (“Elements of Geology,” p. 439.)\r\n\r\nThe _Muschelkalk_ consists of beds of compact limestone, often greyish,\r\nsometimes black, alternating with marl and clay, and commonly containing\r\nsuch numbers of shells that the name of shelly limestone (_Muschelkalk_)\r\nhas been given to the formation by the Germans. The beds are sometimes\r\nmagnesian, especially in the lower strata, which contain deposits of\r\ngypsum and rock-salt.\r\n\r\nThe seas of this sub-period, which is named after the innumerable masses\r\nof shells inclosed in the rocks which it represents, included, besides\r\ngreat numbers of Mollusca, Saurian Reptiles of twelve different genera,\r\nsome Turtles, and six new genera of Fishes clothed with a cuirass. Let\r\nus pause at the Mollusca which peopled the Triassic seas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81.--Ceratites nodosus. (Muschelkalk.)]\r\n\r\nAmong the shells characteristic of the Muschelkalk period, we mention\r\n_Natica Gaillardoti_, _Rostellaria antiqua_, _Lima striata_, _Avicula\r\nsocialis_, _Terebratula vulgaris_, _Turbonilla dubia_, _Myophoria\r\nvulgaris_, _Nautilus hexagonalis_, and _Ceratites nodosus_. The\r\n_Ceratites_, of which a species is here represented (Fig. 81), form a\r\ngenus closely allied to the _Ammonites_, which seem to have played such\r\nan important part in the ancient seas, but which have no existence in\r\nthose of our era, either in species or even in genus. This Ceratite is\r\nfound in the Muschelkalk of Germany, a formation which has no equivalent\r\nin England, but which is a compact greyish limestone underlying the\r\nsaliferous rocks in Germany, and including beds of dolomite with gypsum\r\nand rock-salt.\r\n\r\nThe _Mytilus_ or _Mussel_, which properly belonged to this age, are\r\nacephalous (or headless) Molluscs with elongated triangular shells, of\r\nwhich there are many species found in our existing seas. _Lima_,\r\n_Myophoria_, _Posidonia_, and _Avicula_, are acephalous Molluscs of the\r\nsame period. The two genera _Natica_ and _Rostellaria_ belong to the\r\nGasteropoda, and are abundant in the Muschelkalk in France, Germany, and\r\nPoland.\r\n\r\nAmong the Echinoderms belonging to this period may be mentioned\r\n_Encrinus moniliformis_ and _E. liliiformis_, or _lily encrinite_ (Fig.\r\n82), whose remains, constituting in some localities whole beds of rock,\r\nshow the slow progress with which this zoophyte formed beds of limestone\r\nin the clear seas of the period. To these may be added, among the\r\nMollusca, _Avicula subcostata_ and _Myophoria vulgaris_.\r\n\r\nIn the Muschelkalk are found the skull and teeth of _Placodus gigas_, a\r\nreptile which was originally placed by Agassiz among the class of\r\nFishes; but more perfect specimens have satisfied Professor Owen that it\r\nwas a Saurian Reptile.\r\n\r\nIt may be added, that the presence of a few genera, peculiar to the\r\nPrimary epoch, which entirely disappeared during the sub-period, and\r\nthe appearance for the first time of some other animals peculiar to the\r\nJurassic period, give to the Muschelkalk fauna the appearance of being\r\none of passage from one period to the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82.--Encrinus liliiformis.]\r\n\r\nThe seas, then, contained a few Reptiles, probably inhabitants of the\r\nbanks of rivers, as _Phytosaurus_, _Capitosaurus_, &c., and sundry\r\nFishes, as _Sphœrodus_ and _Pycnodus_. In this sub-period we shall say\r\nnothing of the Land-Turtles, which for the first time now appear; but,\r\nwe should note, that at the Bunter period a gigantic Reptile appears, on\r\nwhich the opinions of geologists were for a long while at variance. In\r\nthe argillaceous rocks of the Muschelkalk period imprints of the foot of\r\nsome animal were discovered in the sandstones of Storeton Hill, in\r\nCheshire, and in the New Red Sandstone of parts of Warwickshire, as well\r\nas in Thuringia, and Hesseburg in Saxony, which very much resembled the\r\nimpression that might be made in soft clay by the outstretched fingers\r\nand thumb of a human hand. These traces were made by a species of\r\nReptile furnished with four feet, the two fore-feet being much broader\r\nthan the hinder two. The head, pelvis, and scapula only of this\r\nstrange-looking animal have been found, but these are considered to have\r\nbelonged to a gigantic air-breathing reptile closely connected with the\r\nBatrachians. It is thought that the head was not naked, but protected by\r\na bony cushion; that its jaws were armed with conical teeth, of great\r\nstrength and of a complicated structure. This curious and\r\nuncouth-looking creature, of which the woodcut Fig. 83 is a restoration,\r\nhas been named the _Cheirotherium_, or _Labyrinthodon_, from the\r\ncomplicated arrangement of the cementing layer of the teeth. (See also\r\nFig. 1, p. 12.)\r\n\r\nAnother Reptile of great dimensions--which would seem to have been\r\nintended to prepare the way for the appearance of the enormous Saurians\r\nwhich present themselves in the Jurassic period--was the _Nothosaurus_,\r\na species of marine Crocodile, of which a restoration has been attempted\r\nin PLATE XIII. opposite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XIII.--Ideal Landscape of the Muschelkalk Sub-period.]\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed, from certain impressions which appear in the\r\nKeuper sandstones of the Connecticut river in North America, that\r\nBirds made their appearance in the period which now occupies us; the\r\nflags on which these occur by thousands show the tracks of an animal of\r\ngreat size (some 20 inches long and 4½ feet apart), presenting the\r\nimpression of three toes, like some of the Struthionidæ or Ostriches,\r\naccompanied by raindrops. No remains of the skeletons of birds have been\r\nmet with in rocks of this period, and the footprints in question are all\r\nthat can be alleged in support of the hypothesis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83.--Labyrinthodon restored. One-twentieth natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nM. Ad. Brongniart places the commencement of dicotyledonous gymnosperm\r\nplants in this age. The characteristics of this Flora consist in\r\nnumerous Ferns, constituting genera now extinct, such as _Anomopteris_\r\nand _Crematopteris_. The true _Equiseta_ are rare in it. The Calamites,\r\nor, rather, the _Calamodendra_, abound. The gymnosperms are represented\r\nby the genera _Conifer_, _Voltzia_, and _Haidingera_, of which both\r\nspecies and individuals are very numerous in the formation of this\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nAmong the species of plants which characterise this formation, we may\r\nmention _Neuropteris elegans_, _Calamites arenaceus_, _Voltzia\r\nheterophylla_, _Haidingera speciosa_. The _Haidingera_, belonging to the\r\ntribe of _Abietinæ_, were plants with large leaves, analogous to those\r\nof our _Damara_, growing close together, and nearly imbricated, as in\r\nthe _Araucaria_. Their fruit, which are cones with rounded scales, are\r\nimbricated, and have only a single seed, thus bearing out the strong\r\nresemblance which has been traced between these fossil plants, and the\r\nDamara.\r\n\r\nThe _Voltzias_ (Fig. 84), which seem to have formed the greater part of\r\nthe forests were a genus of Cupressinaceæ, now extinct, which are well\r\ncharacterised among the fossil Conifers of the period. The alternate\r\nspiral leaves, forming five to eight rows sessile, that is, sitting\r\nclose to the branch and drooping, have much in them analogous to the\r\n_Cryptomerias_. Their fruit was an oblong cone with scales, loosely\r\nimbricated, cuneiform or wedge-shaped, and, commonly, composed of from\r\nthree to five obtuse lobes. In Fig. 84 we have a part of the stem, a\r\nbranch with leaves and cone. In his “Botanic Geography,” M. Lecoq thus\r\ndescribes the vegetation of the ancient world in the first period of the\r\nTriassic age: “While the variegated sandstone and mottled clays were\r\nbeing slowly deposited in regular beds by the waters, magnificent Ferns\r\nstill exhibited their light and elegantly-carved leaves. Divers\r\n_Protopteris_ and majestic _Neuropteris_ associated themselves in\r\nextensive forests, where vegetated also the _Crematopteris typica_ of\r\nSchimper, the _Anomopteris Mongeotii_ of Brongniart, and the pretty\r\n_Trichomanites myriophyllum_ (Göppert). The Conifers of this epoch\r\nattain a very considerable development, and would form graceful forests\r\nof green trees. Elegant monocotyledons, representing the forms of\r\ntropical countries, seem to show themselves for the first time, the\r\n_Yuccites Vogesiacus_ of Schimper constituted groups at once thickly\r\nserried and of great extent.\r\n\r\n“A family, hitherto doubtful, appears under the elegant form of\r\n_Nilssonia Hogardi_, Schimp.; _Ctenis Hogardi_, Brongn. It is still seen\r\nin the _Zamites Vogesiacus_, Schimp.; and the group of the Cycads\r\nsharing at once in the organisation of the Conifers and the elegance of\r\nthe Palms, now decorate the earth, which reveals in these new forms its\r\nvast fecundity. (See Fig. 72, p. 168.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84.--Branch and cone of Voltzia restored.]\r\n\r\n“Of the herbaceous plants which formed the undergrowth of the forests,\r\nor which luxuriated in its cool marshes, the most remarkable is the\r\n_Ætheophyllum speciosum_, Schimp. Their organisation approximates to\r\nthe Lycopodiaceæ and Thyphaceæ, the _Ætheophyllum stipulare_, Brongn.,\r\nand the curious _Schizoneura paradoxa_, Schimp. Thus we can trace the\r\ncommencement of the reign of the Dicotyledons with naked seeds, which\r\nafterwards become so widely disseminated, in a few Angiosperms, composed\r\nprincipally of two families, the Conifers and Cycadeaceæ, still\r\nrepresented in the existing vegetation. The former, very abundant at\r\nfirst, associated themselves with the cellular Cryptogams, which still\r\nabound, although they are decreasing, then with the Cycadeaceæ, which\r\npresent themselves slowly, but will soon be observed to take a large\r\npart in the brilliant harmonies of the vegetable kingdom.”\r\n\r\nThe engraving at page 191 (PLATE XIII.) gives an idealised picture of\r\nthe plants and animals of the period. The reader must imagine himself\r\ntransported to the shores of the Muschelkalk sea at a moment when its\r\nwaves are agitated by a violent but passing storm. The reflux of the\r\ntide exposes some of the aquatic animals of the period. Some fine\r\nEncrinites are seen, with their long flexible stems, and a few Mytili\r\nand Terebratulæ. The Reptile which occupies the rocks, and prepares to\r\nthrow itself on its prey, is the _Nothosaurus_. Not far from it are\r\nother reptiles, its congeners, but of a smaller species. Upon the dune\r\non the shore is a fine group of the trees of the period, that is, of\r\n_Haidingeras_, with large trunks, with drooping branches and foliage, of\r\nwhich the cedars of our own age give some idea. The elegant _Voltzias_\r\nare seen in the second plane of this curtain of verdure. The Reptiles\r\nwhich lived in these primitive forests, and which would give to it so\r\nstrange a character, are represented by the _Labyrinthodon_, which\r\ndescends towards the sea on the right, leaving upon the sandy shore\r\nthose curious tracks which have been so wonderfully preserved to our\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThe footprints of the reptilian animals of this period prove that they\r\nwalked over moist surfaces; and, if these surfaces had been simply left\r\nby a retiring tide, they would generally have been obliterated by the\r\nreturning flood, in the same manner that is seen every day on our own\r\nsandy shores. It seems more likely that the surfaces, on which fossil\r\nfootprints are now found, were left bare by the summer evaporation of a\r\nlake; that these surfaces were afterwards dried by the sun, and the\r\nfootprints hardened, so as to ensure their preservation, before the\r\nrising waters brought by flooded muddy rivers again submerged the low\r\nflat shores and deposited new layers of salt, just as they do at the\r\npresent day round the Dead Sea and the Salt Lake of Utah.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XIV.--Ideal Landscape of the Keuper Sub-period.]\r\n\r\n\r\nKEUPER SUB-PERIOD.\r\n\r\nThe formation which characterises the Keuper, or saliferous period, is\r\nof moderate extent, and derives the latter name from the salt deposits\r\nit contains.\r\n\r\nThese rocks consist of a vast number of argillaceous and marly beds,\r\nvariously coloured, but chiefly red, with tints of yellow and green.\r\nThese are the colours which gave the name of _variegatea_ (Poikilitic)\r\nto the series. The beds of red marl often alternate with sandstones,\r\nwhich are also variegated in colour. As subordinate rocks, we find in\r\nthis formation some deposits of a poor pyritic coal and of gypsum. But\r\nwhat especially characterises the formation are the important deposits\r\nof rock-salt which are included in it. The saliferous beds, often\r\ntwenty-five to forty feet thick, alternate with beds of clay, the whole\r\nattaining a thickness of 160 yards. In Germany in Würtemberg, in France\r\nat Vic, at Dieuze, and at Château-Salins, the rock-salt of the\r\nsaliferous formation has become an important branch of industry. In the\r\nJura, salt is extracted from the water charged with chlorides, which\r\nissues from this formation.\r\n\r\nSome of these deposits are situated at great depths, and cannot be\r\nreached without very considerable labour. The salt-mines of Wieliczka,\r\nin Poland, for example, can be procured on the surface, or by galleries\r\nof little depth, because the deposit belongs to the Tertiary period; but\r\nthe deposits of salt, in the Triassic age, lie so much deeper, as to be\r\nonly approachable by a regular process of mining by galleries, and the\r\nordinary mode of reaching the salt is by digging pits, which are\r\nafterwards filled with water. This water, charged with the salt, is then\r\npumped up into troughs, where it is evaporated, and the crystallised\r\nmineral obtained.\r\n\r\nWhat is the origin of the great deposits of marine salt which occur in\r\nthis formation, and which always alternate with thin beds of clay or\r\nmarl? We can only attribute them to the evaporation of vast quantities\r\nof sea-water introduced into depressions, cavities, or gulfs, which the\r\nsandy dunes afterwards separated from the great open sea. In PLATE XIV.\r\nan attempt is made to represent the natural fact, which must have been\r\nof frequent recurrence during the saliferous period, to form the\r\nconsiderable masses of rock-salt which are now found in the rocks of the\r\nperiod. On the right is the sea, with a dune of considerable extent,\r\nseparating it from a tranquil basin of smooth water. At intervals, and\r\nfrom various causes, the sea, clearing the dune, enters and fills the\r\nbasin. We may even suppose that a gulf exists here which, at one time,\r\ncommunicated with the sea; the winds having raised this sandy dune, the\r\ngulf becomes transformed, by degrees, into a basin or back-water, closed\r\non all sides. However that may be, it is pretty certain that if the\r\nwaters of the sea were once shut up in this basin, with an argillaceous\r\nbottom and without any opening, evaporation from the effects of solar\r\nheat would take place, and a bed of salt would be the result of this\r\nevaporation, mixed with other mineral salts which accompany chloride of\r\nsodium in sea-water, such as sulphate of magnesia, chloride of\r\npotassium, &c. This bed of salt, left by the evaporation of the water,\r\nwould soon receive an argillaceous covering from the clay and silt\r\nsuspended in the muddy water of the basin, thus forming a first\r\nalternation of salt and of clay or marl. The sea making fresh breaches\r\nacross the barriers, the same process took place with a similar result,\r\nuntil the basin was filled up. By the regular and tranquil repetition of\r\nthis phenomenon, continued during a long succession of ages, this\r\nabundant deposit of rock-salt has been formed, which occupies so\r\nimportant a position in the Secondary rocks.\r\n\r\nThere is in the delta of the Indus a singular region, called the Runn of\r\nCutch, which extends over an area of 7,000 square miles, which is\r\nneither land nor sea, but is under water during the monsoons, and in the\r\ndry season is incrusted, here and there, with salt about an inch thick,\r\nthe result of evaporation. Dry land has been largely increased here,\r\nduring the present century, by subsidence of the waters and upheavals by\r\nearthquakes. “That successive layers of salt may have been thrown down\r\none upon the other on many thousand square miles, in such a region, is\r\nundeniable,” says Lyell. “The supply of brine from the ocean is as\r\ninexhaustible as the supply of heat from the sun. The only assumption\r\nrequired to enable us to explain the great thickness of salt in such an\r\narea, is the continuance for an indefinite period of a subsidence, the\r\ncountry preserving all the time a general approach to horizontally.” The\r\nobservations of Mr. Darwin on the atolls of the Pacific, prove that such\r\na continuous subsidence is probable. Hugh Miller, after ably discussing\r\nvarious spots of earth where, as in the Runn of Cutch, evaporation and\r\ndeposit take place, adds: “If we suppose that, instead of a barrier of\r\nlava, sand-bars were raised by the surf on a flat arenaceous coast,\r\nduring a slow and equable sinking of the surface, the waters of the\r\nouter gulf might occasionally topple over the bar and supply a fresh\r\nbrine when the first stock had been exhausted by evaporation.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Ramsay has pointed out that both the sandstones and marls of\r\nthe Triassic epoch were formed in lakes. In the latter part of this\r\nepoch, he is of opinion, that the Keuper marls of the British Isles were\r\ndeposited in a large lake, or lakes, which were fresh or brackish at\r\nfirst, but afterwards salt and without outlets to the sea; and that the\r\nsame was occasionally the case with regard to other portions of northern\r\nEurope and its adjoining seas.\r\n\r\nBy the silting up of such lakes with sediment, and the gradual\r\nevaporation of their waters under favourable conditions, such as\r\nincreased heat and diminished rainfall--where the lakes might cease to\r\nhave an outflow into the sea and the loss of water by evaporation would\r\nexceed the amount flowing into them--the salt or salts contained in\r\nsolution would, by degrees, become concentrated and finally\r\nprecipitated. In this way the great deposits of rock-salt and gypsum,\r\ncommon in the Keuper formation, may be accounted for.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, by increase of rainfall or decrease of heat, and sinking\r\nof the district, the waters became comparatively less salt again; and a\r\nrecurrence of such conditions lasted until the close of the Keuper\r\nperiod, when a partial influx of the sea took place, and the Rhætic beds\r\nof England were deposited.\r\n\r\nThe red colour of the New Red Sandstones and marls is caused by peroxide\r\nof iron, which may also have been carried into the lakes in solution, as\r\na carbonate, and afterwards converted into peroxide by contact with air,\r\nand precipitated as a thin pellicle upon the sedimentary grains of sandy\r\nmud, of which the Triassic beds more or less consist. Professor Ramsay\r\nfurther considers that all the red-coloured strata of England, including\r\nthe Permian, Old Red Sandstone, and even the Old Cambrian formation,\r\nwere deposited in lakes or inland waters.[55]\r\n\r\n  [55] A. C. Ramsay, _Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._, vol. 27, p. 191.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is little to be said of the animals which belong to the Saliferous\r\nperiod. They are nearly the same as those of the Muschelkalk, &c.\r\n\r\nAmong the most abundant of the shells belonging to the upper Trias, in\r\nall the countries where it has been examined, are the _Avicula,\r\nCardium_, and _Pecten_, one of which is given in Fig. 85. Foraminifera\r\nare numerous in the Keuper marls. The remains of land-plants, and the\r\npeculiarities of some of the reptiles of the Keuper period, tend to\r\nconfirm the opinion of Professor Ramsay, that the strata were deposited\r\nin inland salt-lakes.\r\n\r\nIn the Keuper period the islands and continents presented few\r\nmountains; they were intersected here and there by large lakes, with\r\nflat and uniform banks. The vegetation on their shores was very\r\nabundant, and we possess its remains in great numbers. The Keuper Flora\r\nwas very analogous to those of the Lias and Oolite, and consisted of\r\nFerns, Equisetaceæ, Cycads, Conifers, and a few plants, which M. Ad.\r\nBrongniart classes among the dubious monocotyledons. Among the Ferns may\r\nbe quoted many species of _Sphenopteris_ or _Pecopteris_. Among them,\r\n_Pecopteris Stuttgartiensis_, a tree with channelled trunk, which rises\r\nto a considerable height without throwing out branches, and terminates\r\nin a crown of leaves finely cut and with long petioles; the _Equisetites\r\ncolumnaris_, a great Equisetum analogous to the horse-tails of our age,\r\nbut of infinitely larger dimensions, its long fluted trunk, surmounted\r\nby an elongated fructification, towering over all the other trees of the\r\nmarshy soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 85.--Pecten orbicularis.]\r\n\r\nThe _Pterophyllum Jägeri_ and _P. Münsteri_ represented the Cycads, the\r\n_Taxodites Münsterianus_ represented the Conifers, and, finally, the\r\ntrunk of the Calamites was covered with a creeping plant, having\r\nelliptical leaves, with a re-curving nervature borne upon its long\r\npetioles, and the fruit disposed in bunches; this is the _Preissleria\r\nantiqua_, a doubtful monocotyledon, according to Brongniart, but M.\r\nUnger places it in the family of _Smilax_, of which it will thus be the\r\nearliest representative. The same botanist classes with the canes a\r\nmarsh-plant very common in this period, the _Palæoxyris Münsteri_, which\r\nBrongniart classes with the _Preissleria_ among his doubtful\r\nMonocotyledons.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of the latter part of the Triassic period is thus\r\ncharacterised by Lecoq, in his “Botanical Geography”: “The cellular\r\n_Cryptogameæ_ predominate in this as they do in the Carboniferous epoch,\r\nbut the species have changed, and many of the genera also are different;\r\nthe _Cladephlebis_, the _Sphenopteris_, the _Coniopteris_, and\r\n_Pecopteris_ predominate over the others in the number of species. The\r\nEquisetaceæ are more developed than in any other formation. One of the\r\nfinest species, the _Calamites arenaceus_ of Brongniart, must have\r\nformed great forests. The fluted trunks resemble immense columns,\r\nterminating at the summit in leafy branches, disposed in graceful\r\nverticillated tufts, foreshadowing the elegant forms of _Equisetum\r\nsylvaticum_. Growing alongside of these were a curious Equisetum and\r\nsingular Equisetites, a species of which last, _E. columnaris_, raised\r\nits herbaceous stem, with its sterile articulations, to a great height.\r\n\r\n“What a singular aspect these ancient rocks would present, if we add to\r\nthem the forest-trees _Pterophyllum_ and the _Zamites_ of the fine\r\nfamily of Cycadeaceæ, and the Conifers, which seem to have made their\r\nappearance in the humid soil at the same time!\r\n\r\n“It is during this epoch, while yet under the reign of the\r\ndicotyledonous angiosperms, that we discover the first true\r\nmonocotyledons. The _Preissleria antiqua_, with its long petals,\r\ndrooping and creeping round the old trunks, its bunches of\r\nbright-coloured berries like the _Smilax_ of our own age, to which\r\nfamily it appears to have belonged. Besides, the Triassic marshes gave\r\nbirth to tufts of _Palæoxyris Münsteri_, a cane-like species of the\r\nGramineæ, which, in all probability, cheered the otherwise gloomy shore.\r\n\r\n“During this long period the earth preserved its primitive vegetation;\r\nnew forms are slowly introduced, and they multiply slowly. But if our\r\npresent types of vegetation are deficient in these distant epochs, we\r\nought to recognise also that the plants which in our days represent the\r\nvegetation of the primitive world are often shorn of their grandeur. Our\r\nEquisetaceæ and Lycopodiaceæ are but poor representatives of the\r\nLepidodendrons; the Calamites and Asterophyllites had already run their\r\nrace before the epoch of which we write.”\r\n\r\nThe principal features of Triassic vegetation are represented in PLATE\r\nXIV., page 198. On the cliff, on the left of the ideal landscape, the\r\ngraceful stems and lofty trees are groups of _Calamites arenaceus_;\r\nbelow are the great “horse-tails” of the epoch, _Equisetum columnare_, a\r\nslender tapering species, of soft and pulpy consistence, which, rising\r\nerect, would give a peculiar physiognomy to the solitary shore.\r\n\r\nThe Keuper formation presents itself in Europe at many points, and it\r\nis not difficult to trace its course. In France it appears in the\r\ndepartment of the Indre, of the Cher, of the Allier, of the Nièvre, of\r\nthe Saône-et-Loire; upon the western slopes of the Jura its outliers\r\ncrop out near Poligny and Salins, upon the western slopes of the Vosges;\r\nin the Doubs it shows itself; then it skirts the Muschelkalk area in the\r\nHaute-Marne; in the Vosges it assumes large proportions in the Meurthe\r\nat Luneville and Dieuze; in the Moselle it extends northward to\r\nBouzonville; and on the Rhine to the east of Luxembourg as far as\r\nDockendorf. Some traces of it show themselves upon the eastern slopes of\r\nthe Vosges, on the lower Rhine.\r\n\r\nIt appears again in Switzerland and in Germany, in the canton of Basle,\r\nin Argovia, in the Grand Duchy of Würtemberg, in the Tyrol, and in\r\nAustria, where it gives its name to the city of Salzburg.\r\n\r\nIn the British Islands the Keuper formation commences in the eastern\r\nparts of Devonshire, and a band, more or less regular, extends into\r\nSomersetshire, through Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, Warwick,\r\nLeicestershire, Nottinghamshire, to the banks of the Tees, in Yorkshire,\r\nwith a bed, independent of all the others in Cheshire, which extends\r\ninto Lancashire. “At Nantwich, in the upper Trias of Cheshire,” Sir\r\nCharles Lyell states, “two beds of salt, in great part unmixed with\r\nearthy matter, attain the thickness of 90 or 100 feet. The upper surface\r\nof the highest bed is very uneven, forming cones and irregular figures.\r\nBetween the two masses there intervenes a bed of indurated clay\r\ntraversed by veins of salt. The highest bed thins off towards the\r\nsouth-west, losing fifteen feet of its thickness in the course of a\r\nmile, according to Mr. Ormerod. The horizontal extent of these beds is\r\nnot exactly known, but the area containing saliferous clay and\r\nsandstones is supposed to exceed 150 miles in diameter, while the total\r\nthickness of the Trias in the same region is estimated by Mr. Ormerod at\r\n1,700 feet. Ripple-marked sandstones and the footprints of animals are\r\nobserved at so many levels, that we may safely assume the whole area to\r\nhave undergone a slow and gradual depression during the formation of the\r\nNew Red Sandstone.”\r\n\r\nNot to mention the importance of salt as a source of health, it is in\r\nGreat Britain, and, indeed, all over the world where the saliferous\r\nrocks exist, a most important branch of industry. The quantity of the\r\nmineral produced in England, from all sources, is between 5,000 and\r\n6,000 tons annually, and the population engaged in producing the\r\nmineral, from sources supposed to be inexhaustible, is upwards of\r\n12,000.\r\n\r\nThe lower Keuper sandstones, which lie at the base of the series of red\r\nmarls, frequently give rise to springs, and are in consequence called\r\n“water-stones,” in Lancashire and Cheshire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86.--Productus Martini.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87.--Patella vulgata.\r\n\r\n(Living.)]\r\n\r\nIf the Keuper formation is poor in organic remains in France, it is by\r\nno means so on the other side of the Alps. In the Tyrol, and in the\r\nremarkable beds of Saint Cassian, Aussec, and Hallstadt, the rocks are\r\nmade up of an immense number of marine fossils, among them Cephalopods,\r\nCeratites, and Ammonites of peculiar form. The Orthoceras, which we have\r\nseen abounding in the Silurian period, and continued during the deposit\r\nof the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, appears here for the last\r\ntime. We still find here a great number of Gasteropods and of\r\nLamellibranchs of the most varied form. Sea Urchins--corals of elegant\r\nform--appear to have occupied, on the other side of the Alps, the same\r\nseas which in France and Germany seem to have been nearly destitute of\r\nanimals. Some beds are literally formed of accumulated shells belonging\r\nto the genus _Avicula_; but these last-mentioned deposits are to be\r\nconsidered as more properly belonging to the Rhætic or Penarth strata,\r\ninto which the New Red or Keuper Marl gradually passes upwards, and\r\nwhich are more fully described at page 207.\r\n\r\nIn following the grand mountainous slopes of the Alps and Carpathians we\r\ndiscover the saliferous rocks by this remarkable accumulation of\r\nAviculæ. The same facies presents itself under identical conditions in\r\nSyria, in India, in New Caledonia, in New Zealand, and in Australia. It\r\nis not the least curious part of this period, that it presents, on one\r\nside of the site of the Alps, which were not yet raised, an immense\r\naccumulation of sediment, charged with gypsum, rock-salt, &c., without\r\norganic remains; while beyond, a region presents itself equally\r\nremarkable for the extraordinary accumulation of the remains of marine\r\nMollusca. Among these were _Myophoria lineata_, which is often\r\nconfounded with Trigonia, and _Stellispongia variabilis_.\r\n\r\nFrance at this period was still the skeleton of what it has since\r\nbecome. A map of that country represents the metamorphic rocks occupying\r\nthe site of the Alps, the Cévennes, and the Puy-de-Dôme, the country\r\nround Nantes, and the Islands of Brittany. The Primary rocks reach the\r\nfoot of the Pyrenees, the Cotentin, the Vosges, and the Eifel Mountains.\r\nSome bands of coal stretch away from Valenciennes to the Rhine, and on\r\nthe north of the Vosges, these mountains themselves being chiefly\r\ncomposed of Triassic rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHÆTIC, OR PENARTH SUB-PERIOD.\r\n\r\nThe attention of geologists has been directed within the last few years,\r\nmore especially, to a series of deposits which intervene between the New\r\nRed Marl of the Trias, and the blue argillaceous limestones and shales\r\nof the Lower Lias. The first-mentioned beds, although they attain no\r\ngreat thickness in this country, nevertheless form a well-defined and\r\npersistent zone of strata between the unfossiliferous Triassic marls and\r\nthe lower Liassic limestone with _Ostrea Liassica_ and _Ammonites\r\nplanorbis_, _A. angulatus_ and _A. Bucklandi_; being everywhere\r\ncharacterised by the presence of the same groups of organic remains, and\r\nthe same general lithological character of the beds. These last may be\r\ndescribed as consisting of three sub-divisions, the lowermost composed\r\nof alternations of marls, clays, and marly limestones in the lower part,\r\nforming a gradual passage downwards into the New Red Marls upon which\r\nthey repose. 2. A middle group of black, thinly laminated or paper-like\r\nshales, with thin layers of indurated limestone, and crowded in places\r\nwith _Pecten Valoniensis_, _Cardium Rhæticum_, _Avicula contorta_, and\r\nother characteristic shells, as well as by the presence, nearly always,\r\nof a remarkable bed, which is commonly known as the “Bone-bed.” This\r\nthin band of stone, which is so well known at Aust, Axmouth,\r\nWestbury-on-Severn, and elsewhere, is a brecciated or conglomerated band\r\nof variable thickness which, sometimes a sandstone and sometimes a\r\nlimestone, is always more or less composed of the teeth, scales, and\r\nbones of numerous genera of Fishes and Saurians, together with their\r\nfossilised excrement, which will be more fully and subsequently\r\ndescribed under the name of Coprolites, under the Liassic period.\r\n\r\nThe molar tooth of a small predaceous fossil mammal of the Microlestes\r\nfamily (μικρος, _little_; ληστης, _beast_), whose nearest living\r\nrepresentative appears to be some of the Hypsiprymnidæ or Kangaroo Rats,\r\nhas been found by Mr. Dawkins in some grey marls underlying the bone-bed\r\non the sea-shore at Watchett, in Somersetshire; affording the earliest\r\nknown trace of a fossil mammal in the Secondary rocks. Several small\r\nteeth belonging to the genus Microlestes have also been discovered by\r\nMr. Charles Moore in a breccia of Rhætic age, filling a fissure\r\ntraversing Carboniferous Limestone near Frome; and in addition to the\r\ndiscovery of the remains of Microlestes, those of a mammal more closely\r\nallied to the Marsupials than any other order, have been met with at\r\nDiegerloch, south-east of Stuttgart, in a remarkable bone-breccia, which\r\nalso yielded coprolites and numerous traces of fishes and reptiles.\r\n\r\nThe uppermost sub-division includes certain beds of white and\r\ncream-coloured limestone, resembling in appearance the smooth fracture\r\nand closeness of texture of the lithographic limestone of Solenhofen,\r\nand which, known to geologists and quarrymen under the name “white\r\nlias,” given to it by Dr. William Smith, was formerly always considered\r\nto belong to, and was included in, the Lias proper. The most remarkable\r\nbed in this zone is one of only a few inches in thickness, but it has\r\nlong been known to collectors, and sought after under the name of Cotham\r\nMarble or Landscape Stone, the latter name having reference to the\r\ncurious dendritic markings which make their appearance on breaking the\r\nstone at right angles to its bedding, bearing a singular resemblance to\r\na landscape with trees, water, &c.; while the first name is that derived\r\nfrom its occurrence abundantly at Cotham, in the suburbs of Bristol,\r\nwhere the stone was originally found and noticed.\r\n\r\nThis band of stone is interesting in another respect, because it\r\nsometimes shows by its uneven, eroded, and water-worn upper surface,\r\nthat an interval took place soon after it had been deposited, when the\r\nnewly-formed stone became partially dissolved, eroded, or worn away by\r\nwater, before the stratum next in succession was deposited upon it. The\r\nsame phenomenon is displayed, in a more marked degree, in the uppermost\r\nlimestone or “white lias” bed of the series, which not only shows an\r\neroded surface, but the holes made by boring Molluscs, exactly as is\r\nproduced at the present day by the same class of animals, which excavate\r\nholes in the rocks between high and low-water marks, to serve for their\r\ndwelling-places, and as a protection from the waves to their somewhat\r\ndelicate shells.\r\n\r\nThe “White Lias” of Smith is the equivalent of the Koessen beds which\r\nimmediately underlie the Lower Lias of the Swabian Jura, and have been\r\ntraced for a hundred miles, from Geneva to the environs of Vienna; and,\r\nalso, of the Upper St. Cassian beds, which are so called from their\r\noccurrence at St. Cassian in the Austrian Alps.\r\n\r\nThe general character of the series of strata just described, is that\r\nof a deposit formed in tolerably shallow water. In the Alps of Lombardy\r\nand the Tyrol, in Luxembourg, in France, and, in fact, throughout nearly\r\nthe whole of Europe, they form a sort of fringe in the margin of the\r\nTriassic sea; and, although of comparatively inconsiderable thickness in\r\nEngland, they become highly developed in Lombardy, &c., to an enormous\r\nthickness, and constitute the great mass of the Rhætian Alps and a\r\nconsiderable part of the well-known beds of St. Cassian, and Hallstadt\r\nin the Austrian Alps. (See page 205.)\r\n\r\nThe Rhætic beds of Europe were, as a whole, formed under very different\r\nconditions in different areas. The thickness of the strata and the large\r\nand well-developed fauna (chiefly Mollusca) indicate that the Rhætic\r\nstrata of Lombardy, and other parts of the south and east of Europe,\r\nwere deposited in a broad open ocean. On the other hand, the\r\ncomparatively thin beds of this age in England and north-western Europe,\r\nthe fauna of which, besides being poor in genera and species, consists\r\nof small and dwarfed forms, point to the conclusion that they were in\r\ngreat part deposited in shallow seas and in estuaries, or in lagoons, or\r\nin occasional salt lakes, under conditions which lasted for a long\r\nperiod.[56]\r\n\r\n  [56] See A. C. Ramsay, “On the Physical Relations of the New Red Marl,\r\n       Rhætic Beds, and Lower Lias,” _Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._, vol. 27,\r\n       p. 189.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the importance they assume in Lombardy (the ancient\r\nRhætia), the name “Rhætic Beds” has been given to these strata by Mr.\r\nCharles Moore; Dr. Thomas Wright has proposed the designation “Avicula\r\nContorta Zone,” from the plentiful occurrence of that shell in the black\r\nshales forming the well-marked middle zone, and which is everywhere\r\npresent where this group of beds is found; Jules Martin and others have\r\nproposed the term “Infra-lias,” or “Infra-liassic strata;” while the\r\nname “Penarth Beds” has been assigned to these deposits in this country\r\nby Mr. H. W. Bristow, at the suggestion of Sir Roderick Murchison, in\r\nconsequence of their conspicuous appearance and well-exposed sections in\r\nthe bold headlands and cliffs of that locality, in the British Channel,\r\nwest of Cardiff.\r\n\r\nA fuller description of these beds will be found in the Reports of the\r\nBath Meeting of the British Association (1864), by Mr. Bristow; also in\r\ncommunications to the _Geological Magazine_, for 1864, by MM. Bristow\r\nand Dawkins;[57] in papers read before the Geological Society by Dr.\r\nThomas Wright,[58] Mr. Charles Moore,[59] and Mr. Ralph Tate,[60] as\r\nprinted in their _Quarterly Journal_; and by Mr. Etheridge, in the\r\nTransactions of the Cotteswold Natural History Club for 1865-66. The\r\nlimits of the Penarth Beds have also been lately accurately laid down by\r\nMr. Bristow in the map of the Geological Survey over the district\r\ncomprised between Bath, Bristol, and the Severn; and elaborately\r\ndetailed typical sections of most of the localities in England, where\r\nthese beds occur, have been constructed by MM. Bristow, Etheridge, and\r\nWoodward, of the Geological Survey of Great Britain, which, when\r\npublished, will greatly add to our knowledge of this remarkable and\r\ninteresting series of deposits.\r\n\r\n  [57] _Quart.

The\r\nJurassic period presents a very striking assemblage of characteristics,\r\nboth in its vegetation and in the animal remains which belong to it;\r\nmany genera of animals existing in the preceding age have disappeared,\r\nnew genera have replaced them, comprising a very specially organised\r\ngroup, containing not less than 4,000 species.\r\n\r\nThe Jurassic period is sub-divided into two sub-periods: those of the\r\n_Lias_ and the _Oolite_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIAS\r\n\r\nis an English provincial name given to an argillaceous limestone, which,\r\nwith marl and clay, forms the base of the Jurassic formation, and passes\r\nalmost imperceptibly into the Lower Oolite in some places, where the\r\nMarlstone of the Lias partakes of the mineral character, as well as the\r\nfossil remains of the Lower Oolite; and it is sometimes treated of as\r\nbelonging to that formation. “Nevertheless, the Lias may be traced\r\nthroughout a great part of Europe as a separate and independent group,\r\nof considerable thickness, varying from 500 to 1,000 feet, containing\r\nmany peculiar fossils, and having a very uniform lithological\r\naspect.”[61] The rocks which represent the Liassic period form the base\r\nof the Jurassic system, and have a mean thickness of about 1,200 feet.\r\nIn the inferior part we find argillaceous sandstones, which are called\r\nthe sandstones of the Lias, and comprehend the greater part of the\r\n_Quadersandstein_, or building-stone of the Germans, above which comes\r\ncompact limestone, argillaceous, bluish, and yellowish; finally, the\r\nformation terminates in the marlstones which are sometimes sandy, and\r\noccasionally bituminous.\r\n\r\n  [61] Lyell, “Elements of Geology,” p. 413.\r\n\r\nThe Lias, in England, is generally in three groups: 1, the upper, clays\r\nand shales, underlying sands; 2, the middle, lias or marlstone; and 3,\r\nthe lower, clays and limestone; but these have been again\r\nsub-divided--the last into six zones, each marked by its own peculiar\r\nspecies of Ammonites; the second into three zones; the third consists of\r\nclay, shale, and argillaceous limestone. For the purposes of description\r\nwe shall, therefore, divide the Lias into these three groups:--\r\n\r\n1. _Upper Lias Clay_, consists of blue clay, or shale, containing\r\nnodular bands of claystones at the base, crowded with _Ammonites\r\nserpentinus_, _A. bifrons_, _Belemnites_, &c.\r\n\r\n2. The _Middle Lias_, commonly known as the Marlstone, is surmounted by\r\na bed of oolitic ironstone, largely worked in Leicestershire and in the\r\nnorth of England as a valuable ore of iron. The underlying marls and\r\nsands, the latter of which become somewhat argillaceous below, form beds\r\nfrom 200 to 300 feet thick in Dorsetshire and Gloucestershire; the\r\nfossils are _Ammonites margaritaceus_, _A. spinatus_, _Belemnites\r\ntripartitus_. The upper rock-beds, especially the bed of ironstone on\r\nthe top, is generally remarkably rich in fossils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88.--Gryphæa incurva.]\r\n\r\n3. _Lower Lias_ (averaging from 600 to 900 feet in thickness) consists,\r\nin the lower part, of thin layers of bluish argillaceous limestone,\r\nalternating with shales and clays; the whole overlaid by the blue clay\r\nof which the lower member of the Liassic group usually consists. This\r\nmember of the series is well developed in Yorkshire, at Lyme Regis and\r\nCharmouth in Dorsetshire, and generally over the South-West and Midland\r\nCounties of England. _Gryphæa incurva_ (Fig. 88), with sandy bands,\r\noccurs at the base, in addition to which we find _Ammonites planorbis\r\nBucklandi_, _A. Ostrea liassica_, _Lima gigantea_, _Ammonites\r\nBucklandi_, &c., in the lower limestones and shales.\r\n\r\nAbove the clay are yellow sands from 100 to 200 feet thick, underlying\r\nthe limestone of the Inferior Oolite. These sands were, until lately,\r\nconsidered to belong to the latter formation--as they undoubtedly do\r\nphysically--until they were shown, by Dr. Thomas Wright, of Cheltenham,\r\nto be more nearly allied, by their fossils, to the Lias below than to\r\nthe Inferior Oolite above, into which they form the passage-beds.\r\n\r\nIn France the Lias abounds in the Calvados, in Burgundy, Lorraine,\r\nNormandy, and the Lyonnais. In the Vosges and Luxembourg, M. Elie de\r\nBeaumont states that the Lias containing _Gryphæa incurva_ and _Lima\r\ngigantea_, and some other marine fossils, becomes arenaceous; and around\r\nthe Harz mountains, in Westphalia and Bavaria, in its lower parts the\r\nformation is sandy, and is sometimes a good building-stone.\r\n\r\n“In England the Lias constitutes,” says Professor Ramsay, “a\r\nwell-defined belt of strata, running continuously from Lyme Regis, on\r\nthe south-west, through the whole of England, to Yorkshire on the\r\nnorth-east, and is an extensive series of alternating beds of clay,\r\nshale, and limestone, with occasional layers of jet in the upper part.\r\nThe unequal hardness of the clays and limestones of the Liassic strata\r\ncauses some of its members to stand out in the distinct minor\r\nescarpments, often facing the west and north-west. The Marlstone forms\r\nthe most prominent of these, and overlooks the broad meadows of the\r\nlower Lias-clay, that form much of the centre of England.” In Scotland\r\nthere are few traces of the Lias. Zoophytes, Mollusca, and Fishes of a\r\npeculiar organisation, but, above all, Reptiles of extraordinary size\r\nand structure gave to the sea of the Liassic period an interest and\r\nfeatures quite peculiar. Well might Cuvier exclaim, when the drawings of\r\nthe Plesiosaurus were sent to him: “Truly this is altogether the most\r\nmonstrous animal that has yet been dug out of the ruins of a former\r\nworld!” In the whole of the English Lias there are about 243 genera, and\r\n467 species of fossils. The whole series has been divided into zones\r\ncharacterised by particular Ammonites, which are found to be limited to\r\nthem, at least locally.\r\n\r\nAmong the Echinodermata belonging to the Lias we may cite _Asterias\r\nlumbricalis_ and _Palæocoma Furstembergii_, which constitutes a genus\r\nnot dissimilar to the star-fishes, of which its radiated form reminds\r\nus. The Pentacrinites, of which _Pentacrinites Briareus_ is a type,\r\nornaments many collections by its elegant form, and is represented in\r\nFigs. 79 and 89. It belongs to the order of Crinoidea, which is\r\nrepresented at the present time by a single living species, _Pentacrinus\r\ncaput-Medusæ_, one of the rare and delicate Zoophytes of the Caribbean\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nOysters (_Ostrea_) made their appearance in the Muschelkalk of the last\r\nperiod, but only in a small number of species; they increased greatly in\r\nimportance in the Liassic seas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89.--Pentacrinites Briareus. Half natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe _Ammonites_, a curious genus of Cephalopoda, which made their first\r\nappearance in small numbers towards the close of the preceding Triassic\r\nperiod, become quite special in the Secondary epoch, with the close of\r\nwhich they disappear altogether. They were very abundant in the Jurassic\r\nperiod, and, as we have already said, each zone is characterised by its\r\npeculiar species. The name is taken from the resemblance of the shell to\r\nthe ram’s-horn ornaments which decorated the front of the temple of\r\nJupiter Ammon and the bas-reliefs and statues of that pagan deity. They\r\nwere Cephalopodous Mollusca with circular shells, rolled upon themselves\r\nsymmetrically in the same plane, and divided into a series of chambers.\r\nThe animal only occupied the outer chamber of the shell; all the others\r\nwere empty. A siphon or tube issuing from the first chamber traversed\r\nall the others in succession, as is seen in all the Ammonites and\r\nNautili. This tube enabled the animal to rise to the surface, or to sink\r\nto the bottom, for the Ammonite could fill the chambers with water at\r\npleasure, or empty them, thus rendering itself lighter or heavier as\r\noccasion required. The Nautilus of our seas is provided with the same\r\ncurious organisation, and reminds us forcibly of the Ammonites of\r\ngeological times.\r\n\r\nShells are the only traces which remain of the Ammonites. We have no\r\nexact knowledge of the animal which occupied and built them. The attempt\r\nat restoration, as exhibited in Fig. 91, will probably convey a fair\r\nidea of the Ammonite when living. We assume that it resembled the\r\nNautilus of modern times. What a curious aspect these early seas must\r\nhave presented, covered by myriads of these Molluscs of all sizes,\r\nswimming about in eager pursuit of their prey!\r\n\r\nThe Ammonites of the Jurassic age present themselves in a great variety\r\nof forms and sizes; some of them of great beauty. _Ammonites bifrons_,\r\n_A. Noditianus_, _A. bisulcatus_, _A. Turneri_ (Fig. 90), and _A.\r\nmargaritatus_, are forms characteristic of the Lias.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90.--Ammonites Turneri, from the Lower Lias.]\r\n\r\nThe _Belemnites_, molluscous Cephalopods of a very curious organisation,\r\nappeared in great numbers, and for the first time, in the Jurassic seas.\r\nOf this Mollusc we only possess the fossilised internal “bone,”\r\nanalogous to that of the modern cuttle-fish and the calamary of the\r\npresent seas. This simple relic is very far from giving us an exact idea\r\nof what the animal was to which the name of Belemnite has been given\r\n(from Βελεμνον, _a dart_) from their supposed resemblance to the head of\r\na javelin. The slender cylindrical bone, the only vestige remaining to\r\nus, was merely the internal skeleton of the animal. When first\r\ndiscovered they were called, by the vulgar, “Thunder-stones” and\r\n“Ladies’ fingers.” They were, at last, inferred to be the shelly\r\nprocesses of some sort of ancient cuttle-fish. Unlike the Ammonite,\r\nwhich floated on the surface and sunk to the bottom at pleasure, the\r\nBelemnite, it has been thought, swam nearer the bottom of the sea, and\r\nseized its prey from below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 91.--Ammonite restored.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92.--Belemnite restored.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 92 is given a restoration of the living Belemnite, by Dr.\r\nBuckland and Professor Owen, in which the terminal part of the animal is\r\nmarked in a slightly darker tint, to indicate the place of the bone\r\nwhich alone represents in our days this fossilised being. A sufficiently\r\nexact idea of this Mollusc may be arrived at from the existing\r\ncuttle-fish. Like the cuttle-fish, the Belemnite secreted a black\r\nliquid, a sort of ink or sepia; and the bag containing the ink has\r\nfrequently been found in a fossilised state, with the ink dried up, and\r\nelaborate drawings have been made with this fossil pigment.\r\n\r\nThe beaks, or horny mandibles of the mouth, which the Belemnite\r\npossessed in common with the other naked Cephalopoda, are represented in\r\nFig. 78, p. 181.\r\n\r\nAs Sir H. De la Beche has pointed out, the destruction of the animals\r\nwhose remains are known to us by the name of Belemnites was exceedingly\r\ngreat when the upper part of the Lias of Lyme Regis was deposited.\r\nMultitudes seem to have perished almost simultaneously, and millions are\r\nentombed in a bed beneath Golden Cap, a lofty cliff between Lyme Regis\r\nand Bridport Harbour, as well as in the upper Lias generally.[62]\r\n\r\n  [62] De la Beche’s “Geological Manual,” 3rd ed., p. 447.\r\n\r\nAmong the Belemnites characteristic of the Liassic period may be cited\r\n_B. acutus_ (Fig. 93), _B. pistiliformis_, and _B. sulcatus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 93.--Belemnites acutus.]\r\n\r\nThe seas of the period contained a great number of the fishes called\r\n_Ganoids_; which are so called from the splendour of the hard and\r\nenamelled scales, which formed a sort of defensive armour to protect\r\ntheir bodies. _Lepidotus gigas_ was a fish of great size belonging to\r\nthis age. A smaller fish was the _Tetragonolepis_, or _Æchmodus Buchii_.\r\nThe _Acrodus nobilis_, of which the teeth are still preserved, and\r\npopularly known by the name of _fossil leeches_, was a fish of which an\r\nentire skeleton has never been met with. Neither are we better informed\r\nas to the _Hybodus reticulatus_. The bony spines, which form the\r\nanterior part of the dorsal fin of this fish, had long been an object of\r\ncuriosity to geologists, under the general name of _Ichthyodorulites_,\r\nbefore they were known to be fragments of the fin of the _Hybodus_. The\r\nIchthyodorulites were supposed by some naturalists to be the jaw of some\r\nanimal--by others, weapons like those of the living _Balistes_ or\r\n_Silurus_; but Agassiz has shown them to be neither the one nor the\r\nother, but bony spines on the fin, like those of the living genera of\r\n_Cestracions_ and _Chimæras_, in both of which the concave face is armed\r\nwith small spines like those of the _Hybodus_. The spines were simply\r\nimbedded in the flesh, and attached to it by strong muscles. “They\r\nserved,” says Dr. Buckland, “as in the _Chimæra_, to raise and depress\r\nthe fin, their action resembling that of a movable mast lowering\r\nbackward.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94.--Ichthyosaurus communis.]\r\n\r\nLet us hasten to say, however, that these are not the beings that\r\ncharacterised the age, and were the salient features of the generation\r\nof animals which existed during the Jurassic period. These\r\ndistinguishing features are found in the enormous reptiles with lizard’s\r\nhead, crocodile’s conical teeth, the trunk and tail of a quadruped,\r\nwhale-like paddles, and the double-concave vertebræ of fishes; and this\r\nstrange form, on such a gigantic scale that even their inanimate remains\r\nare examined with a curiosity not unmixed with awe. The country round\r\nLyme Regis, in Dorsetshire, has long been celebrated for the curious\r\nfossils discovered in its quarries, and preserved in the muddy\r\naccumulations of the sea of the Liassic period. The country is\r\nhilly--“up one hill and down another,” is a pretty correct provincial\r\ndescription of the walk from Bridport to Lyme Regis--where some of the\r\nmost frightful creatures the living world has probably ever beheld,\r\nsleep the sleep of stones. The quarries of Lyme Regis form the cemetery\r\nof the Ichthyosauri; the sepulchre where lie interred these dragons of\r\nthe ancient seas.\r\n\r\nIn 1811 a country girl, who made her precarious living by picking up\r\nfossils for which the neighbourhood was famous, was pursuing her\r\navocation, hammer in hand, when she perceived some bones projecting a\r\nlittle out of the cliff. Finding, on examination, that it was part of a\r\nlarge skeleton, she cleared away the rubbish, and laid bare the whole\r\ncreature imbedded in the block of stone. She hired workmen to dig out\r\nthe block of Lias in which it was buried. In this manner was the first\r\nof these monsters brought to light: “a monster some thirty feet long,\r\nwith jaws nearly a fathom in length, and huge saucer-eyes; which have\r\nsince been found so perfect, that the petrified lenses have been split\r\noff and used as magnifiers,” as a writer in _All the Year Round_ assures\r\nus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95.--Head of Ichthyosaurus platydon.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 95 the head of _I. platydon_ is represented. As in the Saurians,\r\nthe openings of the nostrils are situated near the anterior angle of the\r\norbits of the eyes, while those of the Crocodile are near the snout;\r\nbut, on the other hand, in its osteology and its mode of dentition it\r\nnearly resembles the Crocodile; the teeth are pointed and conical--not,\r\nhowever, set in deep or separate sockets, but only implanted in a long\r\nand deep continuous groove hollowed in the bones of the jaw. These\r\nstrong jaws have an enormous opening; for, in some instances, they have\r\nbeen found eight feet in length and armed with 160 teeth. Let us add\r\nthat teeth lost through the voracity of the animal, or in contests with\r\nother animals, could be renewed many times; for, at the inner side of\r\nthe base of every old tooth, there is always the bony germ of a new one.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of this marine monster were much larger than those of any\r\nanimal now living; in volume they frequently exceed the human head, and\r\ntheir structure was one of their most remarkable peculiarities. In front\r\nof the sclerotic coat or capsule of the eye there is an annular series\r\nof thin bony plates, surrounding the pupil. This structure, which is now\r\nonly met with in the eyes of certain turtles, tortoises, and lizards,\r\nand in those of many birds, could be used so as to increase or diminish\r\nthe curvature of the transparent cornea, and thus increase or diminish\r\nthe magnifying power, according to the requirements of the\r\nanimal--performing the office, in short, of a telescope or microscope at\r\npleasure. The eyes of the Ichthyosaurus were, then, an optical apparatus\r\nof wonderful power and of singular perfection, enabling the animal, by\r\ntheir power of adaptation and intensity of vision, to see its prey far\r\nand near, and to pursue it in the darkness and in the depths of the sea.\r\nThe curious arrangement of bony plates we have described furnished,\r\nbesides, to its globular eye, the power necessary to bear the pressure\r\nof a considerable weight of water, as well as the violence of the waves,\r\nwhen the animal came to the surface to breathe, and raised its head\r\nabove the waves. This magnificent specimen of the fish-lizard, or\r\nIchthyosaurus, as it was named by Dr. Ure, now forms part of the\r\ntreasures of the British Museum.\r\n\r\nAt no period in the earth’s history have Reptiles occupied so important\r\na place as they did in the Jurassic period. Nature seems to have wished\r\nto bring this class of animals to the highest state of development. The\r\ngreat Reptiles of the Lias are as complicated in their structure as the\r\nMammals which appeared at a later period. They probably lived, for the\r\nmost part, by fishing in shallow creeks and bays defended from heavy\r\nbreakers, or in the open sea; but they seem to have sought the shore\r\nfrom time to time; they crawled along the beach, covered with a soft\r\nskin, perhaps not unlike some of our Cetaceæ. The Ichthyosaurus, from\r\nits form and strength, may have braved the waves of the sea as the\r\nporpoise does now. Its destructiveness and voracity must have been\r\nprodigious, for Dr. Buckland describes a specimen which had between its\r\nribs, in the place where the stomach might be supposed to have been\r\nplaced, the skeleton of a smaller one--a proof that this monster, not\r\ncontent with preying on its weaker neighbours, was in the habit of\r\ndevouring its own kind. In the same waters lived the Plesiosaurus, with\r\nlong neck and form more strange than that of the Ichthyosaurus; and\r\nthese potentates of the seas were warmed by the same sun and tenanted\r\nthe same banks, in the midst of a vegetation not unlike that which the\r\nclimate of Africa now produces.\r\n\r\nThe great Saurians in the Lias of Lyme Regis seem to have suffered a\r\nsomewhat sudden death, partly in consequence of a series of small\r\ncatastrophes suddenly destroying the animals then existing in particular\r\nspots. “In general the bones are not scattered about, and in a detached\r\nstate, as would happen if the dead animal had descended to the bottom of\r\nthe sea, to be decomposed, or devoured piecemeal, as, indeed, might also\r\nhappen if the creature floated for a time on the surface, one animal\r\ndevouring one part, and another carrying off a different portion; on the\r\ncontrary, the bones of the skeleton, though frequently compressed, as\r\nmust arise from the enormous pressure to which they have so long been\r\nsubjected, are tolerably connected, frequently in perfect, or nearly\r\nperfect, order, as if prepared by the anatomist. The skin, moreover, may\r\nsometimes be traced, and the compressed contents of the intestines may\r\nat times be also observed--all tending to show that the animals were\r\nsuddenly destroyed, and as suddenly preserved.”[63]\r\n\r\n  [63] “Geological Manual,” by H. T. De la Beche, 3rd ed., p. 346.\r\n\r\nThese strange and gigantic Saurians seem almost to disappear during the\r\nsucceeding geological periods; for, although they have been discovered\r\nas low down as the Trias in Germany, and as high up as the Chalk in\r\nEngland, they only appear as stragglers in these epochs; so, too, the\r\nReptiles, the existing Saurians are, as it were, only the shadowy,\r\nfeeble representatives of these powerful races of the ancient world.\r\n\r\nConfining ourselves to well-established facts, we shall consider in some\r\ndetail the best known of these fossil reptiles--the _Ichthyosaurus_,\r\n_Plesiosaurus_, and _Pterodactyle_.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary creature which bears the name of _Ichthyosaurus_ (from\r\nthe Greek words Ιχθυς σαυρος, signifying fish-lizard), presents certain\r\ndispositions and organic arrangements which are met with dispersed in\r\ncertain classes of animals now living, but they never seem to be again\r\nreunited in any single individual. It possesses, as Cuvier says, the\r\nsnout of a dolphin, the head of a lizard, the jaws and teeth of a\r\ncrocodile, the vertebræ of a fish, the head and sternum of a lizard, the\r\npaddles like those of a whale, and the trunk and tail of a quadruped.\r\n\r\nBayle appears to have furnished the best idea of the Ichthyosaurus by\r\ndescribing it as the Whale of the Saurians--the Cetacean of the\r\nprimitive seas. It was, in fact, an animal exclusively marine; which, on\r\nshore, would rest motionless like an inert mass. Its whale-like paddles,\r\nand fish-like vertebræ, the length of the tail and other parts of its\r\nstructure, prove that its habits were aquatic; as the remains of fishes\r\nand reptiles, and the form of its teeth, show that it was carnivorous.\r\nLike the Whale, also, the Ichthyosaurus breathed atmospheric air; so\r\nthat it was under the necessity of coming frequently to the surface of\r\nthe water, like that inhabitant of the deep. We can even believe, with\r\nBayle, that it was provided, like the Whale, with vents or blowers,\r\nthrough which it ejected, in columns into the air, the water it had\r\nswallowed.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the Ichthyosaurus varied with the species, of which\r\nfive are known and described. These are _Ichthyosaurus communis_, _I.\r\nplatydon_, _I. intermedius_, _I. tenuirostris_, and _I. Cuvierii_, the\r\nlargest being more than thirty feet in length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96.--Ichthyosaurus platydon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97.--Lower jaw of Ichthyosaurus. (Dr. Buckland.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98.--Skeleton of Ichthyosaurus.\r\n\r\nContaining teeth and bones of Fishes in a coprolitic form. One-fifteenth\r\nnatural size.]\r\n\r\nThe short, thick neck of the Ichthyosaurus supported a capacious head,\r\nand was continued backwards, from behind the eyes, in a column composed\r\nof more than a hundred vertebræ. The animal being adapted, like the\r\nwhale, for rapid movement through the water, its vertebræ had none of\r\nthe invariable solidity of those of the Lizard or Crocodile, but rather\r\nthe structure and lightness of those of Fishes. The section of these\r\nvertebræ presents two hollow cones, connected only by their summits to\r\nthe centre of the vertebræ, which would permit of the utmost flexibility\r\nof movement. The ribs extended along the entire length of the vertebral\r\ncolumn, from the head to the pelvis. The bones of the sternum, or that\r\npart of the frame which supported the paddles, present the same\r\ncombinations with those of the sternum in the Ornithorhynchus, or\r\nDuck-billed Platypus, of New Holland, an animal which presents the\r\nsingular combination of a mammalian furred quadruped having the bill of\r\na duck and webbed feet; which dived to the bottom of the water in search\r\nof its food, and returned to the surface to breathe the air. In this\r\nphenomenon of living Nature the Creator seems to have repeated, in our\r\ndays, the organic arrangements which he had originally provided for the\r\nIchthyosaurus.\r\n\r\nIn order that the animal should be able to move with rapidity in the\r\nwater, both its anterior and posterior members were converted into fins\r\nor paddles. The anterior fins were half as large again as the posterior.\r\nIn some species each paddle was made up of nearly a hundred bones, of\r\npolygonal form, and disposed in series representing the phalanges of the\r\nfingers. This hand, jointed at the arm, bears resemblance, in\r\nosteological construction, to the paddles, without distinct fingers, of\r\nthe Porpoise and the Whale. A specimen of the posterior fin of _I.\r\ncommunis_, discovered at Barrow-on-Soar, in Leicestershire, in 1840, by\r\nSir Philip Egerton, exhibited on its posterior margin the remains of\r\ncartilaginous rays, which bifurcated as they approached the edge, like\r\nthose in the fins of a fish. “It had previously been supposed,” says\r\nProfessor Owen, “that the locomotive organs were enveloped, while\r\nliving, in a smooth integument, like that of the turtle and porpoise,\r\nwhich has no other support than is afforded by the bones and ligaments\r\nwithin; but it now appears that the fin was much larger, expanding far\r\nbeyond the osseous frame-work, and deviating widely in its fish-like\r\nrays from the ordinary reptilian type.” The Professor believes that,\r\nbesides the fore-paddles, these stiff-necked Saurians were furnished at\r\nthe end of the tail with a fin to assist them in turning, not placed\r\nhorizontally, as in the whale, but vertically, forming a powerful\r\ninstrument of progression and motion. It is obvious that the\r\nIchthyosaurus was an animal powerfully armed for offence and defence. We\r\ncannot say, with certainty, whether the skin was smooth, like that of\r\nthe whale or lizard, or covered with scales, like the great reptiles of\r\nour own age. Nevertheless, as the scales of the Fishes and the cuirass\r\nand horny armour of other Reptiles of the Lias are preserved, and as no\r\nsuch defensive scales have been found belonging to the Ichthyosaurus, it\r\nis probable that the skin was naked and smooth. The tail, composed of\r\nfrom eighty to eighty-five vertebræ, was provided with large and long\r\npaddles, arranged vertically as in the Whale.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to see to what a degree of perfection has been carried, in\r\nour days, the knowledge of the antediluvian animals, their habits, and\r\ntheir economy. Fig. 98 represents the skeleton of an Ichthyosaurus found\r\nin the Lias of Lyme Regis, which still retains in its abdominal cavity\r\ncoprolites, that is to say, the residue of digestion. The soft parts of\r\nthe intestinal canal have disappeared, but the _fæces_ themselves are\r\npreserved, and their examination informs us as to the alimentary\r\nregimen of this animal which has perished from the earth many thousands,\r\nperhaps millions, of years. Mary Anning, to whom we owe many of the\r\ndiscoveries made in the neighbourhood of Lyme Regis, her native place,\r\nhad in her collection an enormous coprolite of the Ichthyosaurus. This\r\ncoprolite (Fig. 99) contained some bones and scales of Fishes, and of\r\ndivers Reptiles, well enough preserved to have their species identified.\r\nIt only remains to be added that, among the bones, those of the\r\nIchthyosaurus were often found, especially those of young individuals.\r\nThe presence of the undigested remains of vertebræ and other bones of\r\nanimals of its own species in the coprolites of the Ichthyosaurus\r\nproves, as we have already had occasion to remark, that this great\r\nSaurian must have been a most voracious monster, since it habitually\r\ndevoured not only fish, but individuals of its own race--the smaller\r\nbecoming the prey of the larger. The structure of the jaw of the\r\nIchthyosaurus leads us to believe that the animal swallowed its prey\r\nwithout dividing it. Its stomach and intestines must, then, have formed\r\na sort of pouch of great volume, filling entirely the abdominal cavity,\r\nand corresponding in extent to the great development of the teeth and\r\njaws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 99.--Coprolite, enclosing bones of small\r\nIchthyosaurus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 100.--Coprolite of Ichthyosaurus.]\r\n\r\nThe perfection with which its contents have been preserved in the\r\nfossilised coprolites, furnishes indirect proofs that the intestinal\r\ncanal of the Ichthyosaurus resembled closely that of the shark and the\r\ndog-fish--fishes essentially voracious and destructive, which have the\r\nintestinal canal spirally convoluted, an arrangement which is exactly\r\nthat indicated in some of the coprolites of the Ichthyosaurus, as is\r\nevident from the impressions which the folds of the intestine have left\r\non the coprolite, of which Fig. 100 is a representation. In the cliffs\r\nnear Lyme Regis coprolites are abundant in the Liassic formation, and\r\nhave been found disseminated through the shales and limestones along\r\nmany miles of that coast.\r\n\r\nWhat an admirable privilege of science, which is able, by an examination\r\nof the simplest parts in the organisation of beings which lived ages\r\nago, to give to our minds such solid teachings and such true enjoyments!\r\n“When we discover,” says Dr. Buckland, “in the body of an Ichthyosaurus\r\nthe food which it has engulfed an instant before its death, when the\r\nintervals between its sides present themselves still filled with the\r\nremains of fishes which it had swallowed some ten thousand years ago, or\r\na time even twice as great, all these immense intervals vanish, time\r\ndisappears, and we find ourselves, so to speak, thrown into immediate\r\ncontact with events which took place in epochs immeasurably distant, as\r\nif we occupied ourselves with the affairs of the previous day.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 101.--Skull of Plesiosaurus restored. (Conybeare.)\r\n\r\n_a_, profile; _b_, seen from above.]\r\n\r\nThe name of _Plesiosaurus_ (from the Greek words πλησιος, _near_, and\r\nσαυρος, _lizard_) reminds us that this animal, though presenting many\r\npeculiarities of general structure, is allied by its organisation to the\r\nSaurian or Lizard family, and, consequently, to the Ichthyosaurus.\r\n\r\nThe Plesiosaurus presents, in its organic structure, the most curious\r\nassemblage we have met with among the organic vestiges of the ancient\r\nworld. The Plesiosaurus was a marine, air-breathing, carnivorous\r\nreptile, combining the characters of the head of a Lizard, the teeth of\r\na Crocodile, a neck of excessive length resembling that of a Swan, the\r\nribs of a Chameleon, a body of moderate size, and a very short tail,\r\nand, finally, four paddles resembling those of a Whale. Let us bestow a\r\nglance upon the remains of this strange animal which the earth has\r\nrevealed, and which science has restored to us.\r\n\r\nThe head of the Plesiosaurus presents a combination of the characters\r\nbelonging to the Ichthyosaurus, the Crocodile, and the Lizard. Its\r\nenormously long neck comprises a greater number of vertebræ than the\r\nneck of either the Camel, the Giraffe, or even the Swan, which of all\r\nthe feathered race has the longest neck in comparison to the rest of the\r\nbody. And it is to be remarked, that, contrary to what obtains in the\r\nMammals, where the vertebræ of the neck are always seven, the vertebræ\r\nin birds increase in number with the length of the neck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 102.--Skeleton of Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus\r\nrestored. (Conybeare principally.)]\r\n\r\nThe body is cylindrical and rounded, like that of the great marine\r\nTurtles. It was, doubtless, naked, _i.e._, not protected with the scales\r\nor carapace with which some authors have invested it; for no traces of\r\nsuch coverings have been found near any of the skeletons which have been\r\nhitherto discovered. The dorsal vertebræ are attached to each other by\r\nnearly plane surfaces like those of terrestrial quadrupeds, a mode of\r\narrangement which must have deprived the whole of its vertebral column\r\nof much of its flexibility. Each pair of ribs surrounded the body with a\r\ncomplete girdle, formed of five pieces, as in the Chameleon and Iguana;\r\nwhence, no doubt, as with the Chameleon, great facilities existed for\r\nthe contraction and dilatation of the lungs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 103.--Sternum and pelvis of Plesiosaurus. Pub.,\r\npubis; Isch., ischium; Il., ilium.]\r\n\r\nThe breast, the pelvis, and the bones of the anterior and posterior\r\nextremities furnished an apparatus which permitted the Plesiosaurus,\r\nlike the Ichthyosaurus and existing Cetaceans, to sink in the water and\r\nreturn to the surface at pleasure (Fig. 103). Prof. Owen, in his “Report\r\non British Reptiles,” characterises them as air-breathing and\r\ncold-blooded animals; the proof that they respired atmospheric air\r\nimmediately, being found in the position and structure of the nasal\r\npassages, and the bony mechanism of the thoracic duct and abdominal\r\ncavity. In the first, the size and position of the external nostrils\r\n(Fig. 102), combined with the structure of the paddles, indicate a\r\nstriking analogy between the extinct Saurians and the Cetaceans,\r\noffering, as the Professor observes, “a beautiful example of the\r\nadaptation of structure to the peculiar exigencies of species.” While\r\nthe evidence that they were cold-blooded animals is found in the\r\nflexible or unanchylosed condition of the osseous pieces of the occiput\r\nand other cranial bones of the lower jaw, and of the vertebral column;\r\nfrom which the Professor draws the conclusion that the heart was adapted\r\nfor transmitting a part only of the blood through the respiratory\r\norgans; the absence of the ball-and-socket articulations of the bones of\r\nthe vertebræ, the position of the nostrils near the summit of the head,\r\nthe numerous short and flat digital bones, which must have been\r\nenveloped in a simple undivided integumentary sheath, forming in both\r\nfore and hind extremities a paddle closely resembling that of the living\r\nCetacea. The paddles are larger and more powerful than those of the\r\nIchthyosaurus, to compensate for the slight assistance the animal\r\nderived from the tail. The latter--shorter, as compared with the length\r\nof the rest of the body, than in the Ichthyosaurus--was more calculated\r\nto act the part of a rudder, in directing the course of the animal\r\nthrough the water, than as a powerful organ of propulsion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 104.--Remains of Plesiosaurus macrocephalus.\r\nOne-twelfth natural size.]\r\n\r\nSuch were the strange combinations of form and structure in the\r\nPlesiosaurus and Ichthyosaurus--genera of animals whose remains have,\r\nafter an interment extending to unknown thousands of years, been\r\nrevealed to light and submitted to examination; nay, rebuilt, bone by\r\nbone, until we have the complete skeletons before us, and the habits of\r\nthe animals described, as if they had been observed in life. Conybeare\r\nthus speaks of the supposed habits of these extinct forms, which he had\r\nbuilt up from scanty materials: “That the Plesiosaurus was aquatic is\r\nevident from the form of its paddles; that it was marine is equally so,\r\nfrom the remains with which it is universally associated; that it may\r\nhave occasionally visited the shore, the resemblance of its extremities\r\nto the turtle may lead us to conjecture; its motion, however, must have\r\nbeen very awkward on land; its long neck must have impeded its progress\r\nthrough the water, presenting a striking contrast to the organisation\r\nwhich so admirably fits the Ichthyosaurus for cutting through the waves.\r\nMay it not, therefore, be concluded that it swam on or near the surface,\r\narching back its long neck like the swan, and occasionally darting it\r\ndown at the fish which happened to float within its reach? It may,\r\nperhaps, have lurked in shallow water along the coasts, concealed among\r\nthe sea-weeds, and, raising its nostrils to the surface from a\r\nconsiderable depth, may have found a secure retreat from the assaults of\r\ndangerous enemies, while the length and flexibility of its neck may have\r\ncompensated for the want of strength in its jaws, and incapacity for\r\nswift motion through the water, by the suddenness and agility of the\r\nattack they enabled it to make on every animal fitted to become its\r\nprey.”\r\n\r\nThe Plesiosaurus was first described by the Rev. W. D. Conybeare and Sir\r\nHenry De la Beche, in the “Geological Society’s Transactions” for 1821,\r\nand a restoration of _P. dolichodeirus_, the most common of these\r\nfossils, appeared in the same work for 1824. The first specimen was\r\ndiscovered, as the Ichthyosaurus had been previously, in the Lias of\r\nLyme Regis; since then other individuals and species have been found in\r\nthe same geological formation in various parts of England, Ireland,\r\nFrance, and Germany, and with such variations of structure that\r\nProfessor Owen has felt himself justified in recording sixteen distinct\r\nspecies, of which we have represented _P. dolichodeirus_ (Fig. 102), as\r\nrestored by Conybeare, and _P. macrocephalus_ (Fig. 104), with its\r\nskeleton, as moulded from the limestone of Lyme Regis, which has been\r\nplaced in the Palæontological Gallery of the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XV.--Ideal scene of the Lias with Ichthyosaurus and\r\nPlesiosaurus.]\r\n\r\nThe Plesiosaurus was scarcely so large as the Ichthyosaurus. The\r\nspecimen of _I. platydon_ in the British Museum probably belonged to an\r\nanimal four-and-twenty feet long, and some are said to indicate thirty\r\nfeet, while there are species of Plesiosauri measuring eighteen and\r\ntwenty, the largest known specimen of _Plesiosaurus Cramptoni_ found in\r\nthe lias of Yorkshire, and now in the Museum of the Royal Society of\r\nDublin, being twenty-two feet four inches in length. On the opposite\r\npage (PLATE XV.) an attempt is made to represent these grand reptiles of\r\nthe Lias in their native element, and as they lived.\r\n\r\nCuvier says of the Plesiosaurus, “that it presents the most monstrous\r\nassemblage of characteristics that has been met with among the races of\r\nthe ancient world.” This expression should not be understood in a\r\nliteral sense; there are no monsters in Nature; in no living creature\r\nare the laws of organisation ever positively infringed; and it is more\r\nin accordance with the general perfection of creation to see in an\r\norganisation so special, in a structure which differs so notably from\r\nthat of the animals of our own days, the simple development of a type,\r\nand sometimes also the introduction of beings, and successive changes in\r\ntheir structure. We shall see, in examining the curious series of\r\nanimals of the ancient world, that the organisation and physiological\r\nfunctions go on improving unceasingly, and that each of the extinct\r\ngenera which preceded the appearance of man, present, for each organ,\r\nmodifications which always tend towards greater perfection. The fins of\r\nthe fishes of Devonian seas become the paddles of the Ichthyosauri and\r\nof the Plesiosauri; these, in their turn, become the membranous foot of\r\nthe Pterodactyle, and, finally, the wing of the bird. Afterwards comes\r\nthe articulated fore-foot of the terrestrial mammalia, which, after\r\nattaining remarkable perfection in the hand of the ape, becomes,\r\nfinally, the arm and hand of man, an instrument of wonderful delicacy\r\nand power, belonging to an enlightened being gifted with the divine\r\nattribute of reason! Let us, then, dismiss any idea of monstrosity with\r\nregard to these antediluvian animals; let us learn, on the contrary, to\r\nrecognise, with admiration, the divine proofs of design which they\r\ndisplay, and in their organisation to see only the handiwork of the\r\nCreator.\r\n\r\nAnother strange inhabitant of the ancient world, the _Pterodactylus_\r\n(from πτερον, _a wing_, and δακτυλος, _a finger_), discovered in 1828,\r\nmade Cuvier pronounce it to be incontestably the most extraordinary of\r\nall the extinct animals which had come under his consideration; and such\r\nas, if we saw them restored to life, would appear most strange and\r\ndissimilar to anything that now exists. In size and general form, and in\r\nthe disposition and character of its wings, this fossil genus, according\r\nto Cuvier, somewhat resembled our modern bats and vampyres, but had its\r\nbeak elongated like the bill of a woodcock, and armed with teeth like\r\nthe snout of a crocodile; its vertebræ, ribs, pelvis, legs, and feet\r\nresembled those of a lizard; its three anterior fingers terminated in\r\nlong hooked claws like that on the fore-finger of the bat; and over its\r\nbody was a covering, neither composed of feathers as in the bird, nor of\r\nhair as in the bat, but probably a naked skin; in short, it was a\r\nmonster resembling nothing that has ever been heard of upon earth,\r\nexcept the dragons of romance and heraldry. Moreover, it was probably\r\nnoctivagous and insectivorous, and in both these points resembled the\r\nbat; but differed from it in having the most important bones in its body\r\nconstructed after the manner of those of reptiles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 105.--Pterodactylus crassirostris.]\r\n\r\n“Thus, like Milton’s fiend, all-qualified for all services and all\r\nelements, the creature was a fit companion for the kindred reptiles that\r\nswarmed in the seas, or crawled on the shores, of a turbulent planet:\r\n\r\n    “The Fiend,\r\n    O’er bog, or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,\r\n    With head, hands, wings, or feet, pursues his way,\r\n    And sinks, or swims, or wades, or creeps, or flies.\r\n\r\n_Paradise Lost_, Book II., line 947.\r\n\r\n“With flocks of such-like creatures flying in the air, and shoals of\r\nIchthyosauri and Plesiosauri swarming in the ocean, and gigantic\r\nCrocodiles and Tortoises crawling on the shores of primæval lakes and\r\nrivers--air, sea, and land must have been strangely tenanted in these\r\nearly periods of our infant world.”[64]\r\n\r\n  [64] Professor Buckland on the Pterodactylus. “Trans. Geol. Soc.,” 2nd\r\n       series, vol. iii., p. 217.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 106.--Pterodactylus brevirostris.]\r\n\r\nThe strange structure of this animal gave rise to most contradictory\r\nopinions from the earlier naturalists. One supposed it to be a bird,\r\nanother a bat, and others a flying reptile. Cuvier was the first to\r\ndetect the truth, and to prove, from its organisation, that the animal\r\nwas a Saurian. “Behold,” he says, “an animal which in its osteology,\r\nfrom its teeth to the end of its claws, presents all the characters of\r\nthe Saurians; nor can we doubt that their characteristics existed in its\r\ninteguments and softer parts, in its scales, its circulation, its\r\ngenerative organs: it was at the same time provided with the means of\r\nflight; but when stationary it could not have made much use of its\r\nanterior extremities, even if it did not keep them always folded as\r\nbirds fold their wings. It might, it is true, use its small anterior\r\nfingers to suspend itself from the branches of trees; but when at rest\r\nit must have been generally on its hind feet, like the birds again, and\r\nlike them it must have carried its neck half-erect and curved backwards,\r\nso that its enormous head should not disturb its equilibrium.” This\r\ndiversity of opinion need not very much surprise us after all, for, with\r\nthe body and tail of an ordinary mammal, it had the form of a bird in\r\nits head and the length of its neck, of the bat in the structure and\r\nproportion of its wings, and of a reptile in the smallness of its head\r\nand in its beak, armed with at least sixty equal sharp-pointed teeth,\r\ndiffering little in form and size.\r\n\r\nDr. Buckland describes eight distinct species, varying in size from a\r\nsnipe to a cormorant. Of these, _P. crassirostris_ (Fig. 105) and _P.\r\nbrevirostris_ (Fig. 106), were both discovered in the Lias of\r\nSolenhofen. _P. macronyx_ belongs to the Lias of Lyme Regis.\r\n\r\nThe Pterodactyle was, then, a reptile provided with wings somewhat\r\nresembling those of Bats, and formed, as in that Mammal, of a membrane\r\nwhich connected the body with the excessively elongated phalanges of the\r\nfourth finger, which served to expand the membrane that answered the\r\npurposes of a wing. The Pterodactyle of the Liassic period was, as we\r\nhave seen, an animal of small size; the largest species in the older\r\nLias beds did not exceed ten or twelve inches in length, or the size of\r\na raven, while the later forms found fossil in the Greensand and Wealden\r\nbeds must have measured more than sixteen feet between the tips of the\r\nexpanded wings. On the other hand, its head was of enormous dimensions\r\ncompared with the rest of the body. We cannot admit, therefore, that\r\nthis animal could really fly, and, like a bird, beat the air. The\r\nmembranous appendage which connected its long finger with its body was\r\nrather a parachute than a wing. It served to moderate the velocity of\r\nits descent when it dropped on its prey from a height. Essentially a\r\nclimber, it could only raise itself by climbing up tall trees or rocks,\r\nafter the manner of lizards, and throw itself thence to the ground, or\r\nupon the lower branches, by making use of its natural parachute.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary position of the Pterodactyle was probably upon its two hind\r\nfeet, the lower extremities being adapted for standing and moving on the\r\nground, after the manner of birds. Habitually, perhaps, it perched on\r\ntrees; it could creep, or climb along rocks and cliffs, or suspend\r\nitself from trees, with the assistance of its claws and feet, after the\r\nmanner of existing Bats. It is even probable, Dr. Buckland thought, that\r\nit had the power of swimming and diving, so common to reptiles, and\r\npossessed by the Vampyre Bat of the island of Bonin. It is believed that\r\nthe smaller species lived upon insects, and the larger preyed upon\r\nfishes, upon which it could throw itself like the sea-gull.\r\n\r\nThe most startling feature in the organisation of this animal is the\r\nstrange combination of two powerful wings attached to the body of a\r\nreptile. The imagination of the poets long dwelt on such a combination;\r\nthe _Dragon_ was a creation of their fancy, and it played a great part\r\nin fable and in pagan mythology. The Dragon, or flying reptile,\r\nbreathing fire and poisoning the air with his fiery breath, had,\r\naccording to the fable, disputed with man the possession of the earth.\r\nGods and demigods claimed, among their most famous exploits, the glory\r\nof having vanquished this powerful and redoubtable monster.\r\n\r\nAmong the animals of our epoch, only a single reptile is found provided\r\nwith wings, or digital appendages analogous to the membranous wings of\r\nthe bats, and which can be compared to the Pterodactyle. This is called\r\nthe _Dragon_, one of the Draconidæ, a family of Saurians, which has been\r\ndescribed by Daudin, as distinguished by the first six ribs, instead of\r\nhooping round the abdomen, extending in nearly a straight line, and\r\nsustaining a prolongation of skin which forms a sort of wing analogous\r\nto that of the Pterodactyle. Independent of the four feet, this wing\r\nsustains the animal, like a parachute, as it leaps from branch to\r\nbranch; but the creature has no power to beat the air with it as birds\r\ndo when flying. This reptile lives in the forests of the hottest parts\r\nof Africa, and in some isles of the Indian Ocean, especially in Sumatra\r\nand Java. The only known species is that figured at page 238 (Fig. 107),\r\nwhich comes from the East Indies.\r\n\r\nWhat a strange population was that which occupied the earth at this\r\nstage of its history, when the waters were filled with creatures so\r\nextraordinary as those whose history we have traced! Plesiosauri and\r\nIchthyosauri filled the seas, upon the surface of which floated\r\ninnumerable Ammonites in light skiffs, some of them as large as a\r\ngood-sized cart-wheel, while gigantic Turtles and Crocodiles crawled on\r\nthe banks of the rivers and lakes. Only one genus of Mammals had yet\r\nappeared, but no birds; nothing broke the silence of the air, if we\r\nexcept the breathing of the terrestrial reptiles and the flight of\r\nwinged insects.\r\n\r\nThe earth cooled progressively up to the Jurassic period, the rains lost\r\ntheir continuity and abundance, and the pressure of the atmosphere\r\nsensibly diminished. All these circumstances favoured the appearance\r\nand the multiplication of innumerable species of animals, whose singular\r\nforms then showed themselves on the earth. We can scarcely imagine the\r\nprodigious quantity of Molluscs and Zoophytes whose remains lie buried\r\nin the Jurassic rocks, forming entire strata of immense thickness and\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 107.--Draco volans.]\r\n\r\nThe same circumstances concurred to favour the production of plants. If\r\nthe shores and seas of the period received such a terrible aspect from\r\nthe formidable animals we have described, the vegetation which covered\r\nthe land had also its peculiar character and appearance. Nothing that we\r\nknow of in the existing scenery of the globe surpasses the rich\r\nvegetation which decorated the continents of the Jurassic period. A\r\ntemperature still of great elevation, a humid atmosphere, and, we have\r\nno reason to doubt, a brilliant sun, promoted the growth of a luxuriant\r\nvegetation, such as some of the tropical islands, with their burning\r\ntemperature and maritime climate, can only give us an idea of, while it\r\nrecalls some of the Jurassic types of vegetation. The elegant Voltzias\r\nof the Trias had disappeared, but the Horse-tails (_Equiseta_) remained,\r\nwhose slender and delicate stems rose erect in the air with their\r\ngraceful panicles; the gigantic rushes also remained; and though the\r\ntree-ferns had lost their enormous dimensions of the Carboniferous age,\r\nthey still preserved their fine and delicately-cut leaves.\r\n\r\nAlongside these vegetable families, which passed upwards from the\r\npreceding age, an entire family--the Cycads (Fig. 72, p. 168)--appear\r\nfor the first time. They soon became numerous in genera, such as\r\nZamites, Pterophyllum (Williamsonia), and Nilssonia. Among the species\r\nwhich characterise this age, we may cite the following, arranging them\r\nin families:--\r\n\r\n  FERNS.                    CYCADS.                   CONIFERS.\r\n\r\n  Odontopteris cycadea.    Zamites distans.           Taxodites.\r\n  Taumopteris Munsteri.    Zamites heterophyllus.     Pinites.\r\n  Camptopteris crenata.    Zamites gracilis.\r\n                           Pterophyllum dubium.\r\n                           Nilssonia contigua.\r\n                           Nilssonia elegantissima.\r\n                           Nilssonia Sternbergii.\r\n\r\nThe _Zamites_ seem to be forerunners of the Palms, which make their\r\nappearance in the following epoch; they were trees of elegant\r\nappearance, closely resembling the existing Zamias, which are trees of\r\ntropical America, and especially of the West India Islands; they were so\r\nnumerous in species and in individuals that they seem to have formed, of\r\nthemselves alone, one half of the forests during the period which\r\nengages our attention. The number of their fossilised species exceeds\r\nthat of the living species. The trunk of the Zamites, simple and covered\r\nwith scars left by the old leaves, supports a thick crown of leaves more\r\nthan six feet in length, disposed in fan-like shape, arising from a\r\ncommon centre.\r\n\r\nThe _Pterophyllum_ (Williamsonia), formed great trees, of considerable\r\nelevation, and covered with large pinnated leaves from top to bottom.\r\nTheir leaves, thin and membranous, were furnished with leaflets\r\ntruncated at the summit and traversed by fine nervures, not convergent,\r\nbut abutting on the terminal truncated edge.\r\n\r\nThe _Nilssonia_, finally, were Cycadeaceæ resembling the Pterophyllum,\r\nbut with thick and coriaceous leaves, and short leaflets contiguous to,\r\nand in part attached to the base; they were obtuse or nearly truncated\r\nat the summit, and would present nervures arched or confluent towards\r\nthat summit.\r\n\r\nThe essential characters of the vegetation during the Liassic sub-period\r\nwere:--1. The great predominance of the Cycadeaceæ, thus continuing the\r\ndevelopment which commenced in the previous period, expanding into\r\nnumerous genera belonging both to this family and that of the _Zamites_\r\nand _Nilssonia_; 2. The existence among the Ferns of many genera with\r\nreticulated veins or nervures, and under forms of little variation,\r\nwhich scarcely show themselves in the more ancient formations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 108.--Millepora alcicornis.\r\n\r\n(Recent Coral.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XVI.--Ideal Landscape of the Liassic Period.]\r\n\r\nOn the opposite page (PLATE XVI.) is an ideal landscape of the Liassic\r\nperiod; the trees and shrubs characteristic of the age are the elegant\r\nPterophyllum, which appears in the extreme left of the picture, and the\r\nZamites, which are recognisable by their thick and low trunk and\r\nfan-like tuft of foliage. The large horsetail, or Equisetum of this\r\nepoch, mingles with the great Tree-ferns and the Cypress, a Conifer\r\nallied to those of our own age. Among animals, we see the Pterodactyle\r\nspecially represented. One of these reptiles is seen in a state of\r\nrepose, resting on its hind feet. The other is represented, not flying,\r\nafter the manner of a bird, but throwing itself from a rock in order to\r\nseize upon a winged insect, the dragon-fly (_Libellula_), the remains of\r\nwhich have been discovered, associated with the bones of the\r\nPterodactyle, in the lithographic limestone of Pappenheim and\r\nSolenhofen.\r\n\r\n\r\nOOLITIC SUB-PERIOD.\r\n\r\nThis period is so named because many of the limestones entering into the\r\ncomposition of the formations it comprises, consist almost entirely of\r\nan aggregation of rounded concretionary grains resembling, in outward\r\nappearance, the roe or eggs of fishes, and each of which contains a\r\nnucleus of sand, around which concentric layers of calcareous matter\r\nhave accumulated; whence the name, from ωον, _egg_, and λιθος, _stone_.\r\n\r\nThe Oolite series is usually subdivided into three sections, the\r\n_Lower_, _Middle_, and _Upper Oolite_. These rocks form in England a\r\nband some thirty miles broad, ranging across the country from Yorkshire,\r\nin the north-east, to Dorset, in the south-west, but with a great\r\ndiversity of mineral character, which has led to a further subdivision\r\nof the series, founded on the existence of particular strata in the\r\ncentral and south-western counties:--\r\n\r\n     UPPER.                 MIDDLE.            LOWER.\r\n\r\n  1. Purbeck Beds.       1. Coral Rag.      1. Cornbrash.\r\n  2. Portland Stone      2. Oxford Clay.    2. Great Oolite & Forest\r\n     and Sand.                                 Marble.\r\n  3. Kimeridge Clay.                        3. Stonesfield Slate.\r\n                                            4. Fuller’s Earth.\r\n                                            5. Inferior Oolite.\r\n\r\nThe alternations of clay and masses of limestone in the Liassic and\r\nOolite formations impart some marked features to the outline of the\r\nscenery both of France and England: forming broad valleys, separated\r\nfrom each other by ranges of limestone hills of more or less elevation.\r\nIn France, the Jura mountains are composed of the latter; in England,\r\nthe slopes of this formation are more gentle--the valleys are\r\nintersected by brooks, and clothed with a rich vegetation; it forms what\r\nis called a tame landscape, as compared with the wilder grandeur of the\r\nPrimary rocks--it pleases more than it surprises. It yields materials\r\nalso, more useful than some of the older formations, numerous quarries\r\nbeing met with which furnish excellent building-materials, especially\r\naround Bath, where the stone, when first quarried, is soft and easily\r\nworked, but becomes harder on exposure to the air.\r\n\r\nThe annexed section (Fig. 109) will give some idea of the configuration\r\nwhich the stratification assumes, such as may be observed in proceeding\r\nfrom the north-west to the south-east, from Caermarthenshire to the\r\nbanks of the Ouse.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOWER OOLITE FAUNA.\r\n\r\nThe most salient and characteristic feature of this age is, undoubtedly,\r\nthe appearance of animals belonging to the class of Mammals. But the\r\norganisation, quite special, of the first of the Mammalia will certainly\r\nbe a matter of astonishment to the reader, and must satisfy him that\r\nNature proceeded in the creation of animals by successive steps, by\r\ntransitions which, in an almost imperceptible manner, connect the beings\r\nof one age with others more complicated in their organisation. The first\r\nMammals which appeared upon the earth, for example, did not enjoy all\r\nthe organic attributes belonging to the more recent creations of the\r\nclass. In the latter the young are brought forth living, and not from\r\neggs, like Birds, Reptiles, and Fishes. But the former belonged to that\r\norder of animals quite special, and never numerous, the young of which\r\nare transferred in a half-developed state, from the body of the mother\r\nto an external pouch in which they remain until they become perfected;\r\nin short, to marsupial animals. The mother nurses her young during a\r\ncertain time in a sort of pouch external to the body, in the\r\nneighbourhood of the abdomen, and provided with teats to which the young\r\nadhere. After a more or less prolonged sojourn in this pouch, the young\r\nanimal, when sufficiently matured and strong enough to battle with the\r\nworld, emerges from its warm retreat, and enters fully into life and\r\nlight; the process being a sort of middle course between oviparous\r\ngeneration, in which the animals are hatched from eggs after exclusion\r\nfrom the mother’s body, like Birds; and viviparous, in which the animals\r\nare brought forth alive, as in the ordinary Mammals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 109.--General view of the succession of British\r\nstrata, with the elevations they reach above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\n_G_, Granitic rocks; _a_, Gneiss; _b_, Mica-schist; _c_, Skiddaw or\r\nCumbrian Slates; _d_, Snowdon rocks; _e_, Plynlymmon rocks; _f_,\r\nSilurian rocks; _g_, Old Red Sandstone; _h_, Carboniferous Limestone;\r\n_i_, Millstone Grit; _k_, Coal-measures; _l_, Magnesian Limestone; _m_,\r\nNew Red Sandstone; _n_, Lias; _o_, Lower, Middle, and Upper Oolites;\r\n_p_, Greensand; _q_, Chalk; _r_, Tertiary strata.]\r\n\r\nIn standard works on natural history the animals under consideration are\r\nclassed as _mammiferous Didelphæ_. They are brought forth in an\r\nimperfect state, and during their transitional condition are suckled in\r\na pouch supported by bones called _marsupial_, which are attached by\r\ntheir extremities to the pelvis, and serve to support the marsupium,\r\nwhence the animals provided with these provisions for bringing up their\r\nprogeny are called _Marsupial Mammals_. The Opossum, Kangaroo, and\r\nOrnithorhynchus are existing representatives of this group.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 110.--Jaw of Thylacotherium Prevostii.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 111.--Jaw of Phascolotherium.]\r\n\r\nThe name of _Thylacotherium_, or _Amphitherium_, or _Phascolotherium_,\r\nis given to the first of these marsupial Mammals which made their\r\nappearance, whose remains have been discovered in the Lower Oolite, and\r\nin one of its higher stages, namely, that called the _Great Oolite_.\r\nFig. 110 represents the jaw of the first of these animals, and Fig. 111\r\nthe other--both of the natural size. These jaw-bones represent all that\r\nhas been found belonging to these early marsupial animals; and Baron\r\nCuvier and Professor Owen have both decided as to their origin. The\r\nfirst was found in the Stonesfield quarries. The Phascolotherium, also a\r\nStonesfield fossil, was the ornament of Mr. Broderip’s collection. The\r\nanimals which lived on the land during the Lower Oolitic period would be\r\nnearly the same with those of the Liassic. The insects were, perhaps,\r\nmore numerous.\r\n\r\nThe marine fauna included Reptiles, Fishes, Molluscs, and Zoophytes.\r\nAmong the first were the Pterodactyle, and a great Saurian, the\r\nTeleosaurus, belonging to a family which made its appearance in this\r\nage, and which reappears in the following epoch. Among the Fishes, the\r\nGanoids and Ophiopsis predominate. Among the Ammonites, _Ammonites\r\nHumphriesianus_, _A. Herveyii_ (Fig. 112), _A. Brongniarti_, _Nautilus\r\nlineatus_, and many other representatives of the cephalopodous Mollusca.\r\nAmong the Brachiopods are _Terebratula digona_ (Fig. 113) and _T.\r\nspinosa_. Among the Gasteropoda the _Pleurotomaria conoidea_ is\r\nremarkable from its elegant shape and markings, and very unlike any of\r\nthe living _Pleurotoma_ as represented by _P. Babylonia_ (Fig. 114).\r\n_Ostrea Marshii_ and _Lima proboscidea_, which belong to the Acephala,\r\nare fossil Mollusca of this epoch, to which also belong _Entalophora\r\ncellarioides_, _Eschara Ranviliana_, _Bidiastopora cervicornis_; elegant\r\nand characteristic molluscous Polyzoa. We give a representation of two\r\nliving species, as exhibiting the form of these curious beings. (Figs.\r\n115 and 116.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 112.--Ammonites Herveyii.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 113.--Terebratula digona.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 114.--Pleurotoma Babylonia. (Recent.)]\r\n\r\nThe Echinoderms and Polyps appear in great numbers in the deposits of\r\nthe Lower Oolite: _Apiocrinus elegans_, _Hyboclypus gibberulus_,\r\n_Dysaster Endesii_ represent the first; _Montlivaltia caryophyllata_,\r\n_Anabacia orbulites_, _Cryptocœnia bacciformis_, and _Eunomia radiata_\r\nrepresent the second.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 115.--Adeona folifera.\r\n\r\n(Recent Polyzoa.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 116.--Cellaria loriculata.\r\n\r\n(Recent Polyzoa.)]\r\n\r\nThis last and most remarkable species of Zoophyte presents itself in\r\ngreat masses many yards in circumference, and necessitates a long period\r\nof time for its production. This assemblage of little creatures living\r\nunder the waters but only at a small depth beneath the surface, as Mr.\r\nDarwin has demonstrated, has nevertheless produced banks, or rather\r\nislets, of considerable extent, which at one time constituted veritable\r\nreefs rising out of the ocean. These reefs were principally constructed\r\nin the Jurassic period, and their extreme abundance is one of the\r\ncharacteristics of this geological age. The same phenomenon continues in\r\nour day, but by the agency of a new race of zoophytes, which carry on\r\ntheir operations, preparing a new continent, probably, in the _atolls_\r\nof the Pacific Ocean. (See Fig. 108, p. 240.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 117.\r\n\r\n1, Otopteris dubia; 2, Otopteris obtusa; 3,\r\nOtopteris acuminata; 4, Otopteris cuneata.]\r\n\r\nThe flora of the epoch was very rich. The Ferns continue to exist, but\r\ntheir size and bearing were sensibly inferior to what they had been in\r\nthe preceding period. Among them Otopteris, distinguished for its\r\nsimply pinnated leaves, whose leaflets are auriculate at the base: of\r\nthe five species, 1, _O. dubia_; and 2, _O. obtusa_; and 3, _O.\r\nacuminata_; and 4, _O. cuneata_ (Fig. 117), are from the Oolite. In\r\naddition to these we may name _Coniopteris Murrayana_, _Pecopteris\r\nDesnoyersii, Pachypteris lanceolata_, and _Phlebopteris Phillipsii_; and\r\namong the Lycopods, _Lycopodus falcatus_.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of this epoch has a peculiar facies, from the presence of\r\nthe family of the Pandanaceæ, or screw-pines, so remarkable for their\r\naërial roots, and for the magnificent tuft of leaves which terminates\r\ntheir branches. Neither the leaves nor the roots of these plants have,\r\nhowever, been found in the fossil state, but we possess specimens of\r\ntheir large and spherical fruit, which leave no room for doubt as to the\r\nnature of the entire plant.\r\n\r\nThe Cycads were still represented by the _Zamias_, and by many species\r\nof Pterophyllum. The Conifers, that grand family of recent times, to\r\nwhich the pines, firs, and other trees of our northern forests belong,\r\nbegan to occupy an important part in the world’s vegetation from this\r\nepoch. The earliest Conifers belonged to the genera _Thuites_,\r\n_Taxites_, and _Brachyphyllum_. The _Thuites_ were true _Thuyas_,\r\nevergreen trees of the present epoch, with compressed branches, small\r\nimbricated and serrated leaves, somewhat resembling those of the\r\nCypress, but distinguished by many points of special organisation. The\r\n_Taxites_ have been referred, with some doubts, to the Yews. Finally,\r\nthe _Brachyphyllum_ were trees which, according to the characteristics\r\nof their vegetation, seem to have approached nearly to two existing\r\ngenera, the _Arthotaxis_ of Tasmania, and the _Weddringtonias_ of South\r\nAfrica. The leaves of the Brachyphyllum are short and fleshy, with a\r\nlarge and rhomboidal base.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOWER OOLITE ROCKS.\r\n\r\nThe formation which represents the Lower Oolite, and which in England\r\nattains an average thickness of from 500 to 600 feet, forms a very\r\ncomplex system of stratification, which includes the two formations,\r\n_Bajocien_ and _Bathonian_, adopted by M. D’Orbigny and his followers.\r\nThe lowest beds of the _Inferior Oolite_ occur in Normandy, in the Lower\r\nAlps (Basses-Alpes), in the neighbourhoods of Lyons and Neuchatel. They\r\nare remarkable near Bayeux for the variety and beauty of their fossils:\r\nthe rocks are composed principally of limestones--yellowish-brown, or\r\nred, charged with hydrated oxide of iron, often oolitic, and reposing on\r\ncalcareous sands. These deposits are surmounted by alternate layers of\r\nclay and marl, blue or yellow--the well-known _Fuller’s Earth_, which is\r\nso called from its use in the manufacture of woollen fabrics to extract\r\nthe grease from the wool. The second series of the Lower Oolite, which\r\nattains a thickness of from 150 to 200 feet on the coast of Normandy,\r\nand is well developed in the neighbourhood of Caen and in the Jura, has\r\nbeen divided, in Britain, into four formations, in an ascending scale:--\r\n\r\n1. The _Great_ or _Bath Oolite_, which consists principally of a very\r\ncharacteristic, fine-grained, white, soft, and well-developed oolitic\r\nlimestone, at Bath, and also at Caen in Normandy. At the base of the\r\nGreat Oolite the Stonesfield beds occur, in which were found the bones\r\nof the marsupial Mammals, to which we have already alluded; and along\r\nwith them bones of Reptiles, principally Pterodactyles, together with\r\nsome finely-preserved fossil plants, fruits, and insects.\r\n\r\n2. _Bradford Clay_, which is a bluish marl, containing many fine\r\nEncrinites (commonly called stone-lilies), but which had only a local\r\nexistence, appearing to be almost entirely confined to this formation.\r\n“In this case, however,” says Lyell, “it appears that the solid upper\r\nsurface of the ‘Great Oolite’ had supported, for a time, a thick\r\nsubmarine forest of these beautiful Zoophytes, until the clear and still\r\nwater was invaded with a current charged with mud, which threw down the\r\nstone-lilies, and broke most of their stems short off near the point of\r\nattachment. The stumps still remain in their original position.”[65] See\r\nFig. 1, PLATE XIX., p. 261. (Bradford, or Pear, Encrinite.)\r\n\r\n  [65] “Elements of Geology,” p. 399.\r\n\r\n3. _Forest Marble_, which consists of an argillaceous shelly limestone,\r\nabounding in marine fossils, and sandy and quartzose marls, is quarried\r\nin the forest of Wichwood, in Wiltshire, and in the counties of Dorset,\r\nWilts, and Somerset.\r\n\r\n4. The _Cornbrash_ (wheat-lands) consists of beds of rubbly\r\ncream-coloured limestone, which forms a soil particularly favourable to\r\nthe cultivation of cereals; hence its name.[66]\r\n\r\n  [66] See Bristow in Descriptive Catalogue of Rocks, in _Mus. Pract.\r\n       Geol._, p. 134.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 118.--Meandrina Dædalæa.\r\n\r\n_a_, entire figure, reduced; _b_, portion, natural size.\r\n\r\n(Recent Coral.)]\r\n\r\nThe Lower Oolite ranges across the greater part of England, but “attains\r\nits maximum development near Cheltenham, where it can be subdivided, at\r\nleast, into three parts. Passing north, the two lower divisions, each\r\nmore or less characterised by its own fossils, disappear, and the\r\nRagstone north-east of Cheltenham lies directly upon the Lias;\r\napparently as conformably as if it formed its true and immediate\r\nsuccessor, while at Dundry the equivalents of the upper freestones and\r\nragstones (the lower beds being absent) lie directly on the exceedingly\r\nthin sands, which there overlie the Lower Lias. In Dorsetshire, on the\r\ncoast, the series is again perfect, though thin. Near Chipping Norton,\r\nin Oxfordshire, the Inferior Oolite disappears altogether, and the Great\r\nOolite, having first overlapped the Fullers’ Earth, passes across the\r\nInferior Oolite, and in its turn seems to lie on the Upper Lias with a\r\nregularity as perfect as if no formation in the neighbourhood came\r\nbetween them. In Yorkshire the changed type of the Inferior Oolite, the\r\nprevalence of sands, land-plants, and beds of coal, occur in such a\r\nmanner as to leave no doubt of the presence of terrestrial surfaces on\r\nwhich the plants grew, and all these phenomena lead to the conclusion\r\nthat various and considerable oscillations of level took place in the\r\nBritish area during the deposition of the strata, both of the Inferior\r\nOolite and of the formations which immediately succeed it.”[67]\r\n\r\n  [67] President’s Address, by Professor A. C. Ramsay. _Quart. Jour.\r\n       Geol. Soc._, 1864, vol. xx., p. 4.\r\n\r\nThe Inferior Oolite here alluded to is a thin bed of calcareous\r\nfreestone, resting on, and sometimes replaced by yellow sand, which\r\nconstitutes the passage-beds from the Liassic series. The Fullers’ Earth\r\nclay lies between the limestones of the Inferior and Great Oolite, at\r\nthe base of which last lies the Stonesfield slate--a slightly oolitic,\r\nshelly limestone, or flaggy and fissile sandstone, some six feet thick,\r\nrich in organic remains, and ranging through Oxfordshire towards the\r\nnorth-east, into Northamptonshire and Yorkshire. At Colley Weston, in\r\nNorthamptonshire, fossils of _Pecopteris polypodioides_ are found. In\r\nthe Great Oolite formation, near Bath, are many corals, among which the\r\n_Eunomia radiata_ is very conspicuous. The fossil is not unlike the\r\nexisting brain-coral of the tropical seas (Fig. 118). The work of this\r\ncoral seems to have been suddenly stopped by “an invasion,” says Lyell,\r\n“of argillaceous matter, which probably put a sudden stop to the growth\r\nof Bradford Encrinites, and led to their preservation in marine\r\nstrata.”[68] The Cornbrash is, in general, a cream-coloured limestone,\r\nabout forty feet thick, in the south-west of England, and occupying a\r\nconsiderable area in Dorsetshire and North Wilts, as at Cricklade,\r\nMalmesbury, and Chippenham, in the latter county. _Terebratula obovata_\r\nis its characteristic shell, and _Nucleolites clunicularis_, _Lima\r\ngibbosa_, and _Avicula echinata_ occur constantly in great numbers.\r\nWherever it occurs the Cornbrash affords a rich and fertile soil, well\r\nadapted for the growth of wheat, while the Forest Marble, as a soil, is\r\ngenerally poor. The Cornbrash passes downwards into the Forest Marble,\r\nand sometimes, as at Bradford, near Bath, is replaced by clay. This\r\nclay, called the Bradford clay, is almost wholly confined to the county\r\nof Wilts. _Terebratula decussata_ is one of the most characteristic\r\nfossils, but the most common is the Apiocrinites or pear-shaped\r\nencrinite, whose remains in this clay are so perfectly preserved that\r\nthe most minute articulations are often found in their natural\r\npositions. PLATE XIX., p. 261 (Fig. 1), represents an adult attached by\r\na solid base to the rocky bottom on which it grew, whilst the smaller\r\nindividuals show the Encrinite in its young state--one with arms\r\nexpanded, the other with them closed. Ripple-marked slabs of fissile\r\nForest Marble are used as a roofing-slate, and may be traced over a\r\nbroad band of country in Wiltshire and Gloucestershire, separated from\r\neach other by thin seams of clay, in which the undulating ridges of\r\nthe sand are preserved, and even the footmarks of small Crustaceans are\r\nstill visible.\r\n\r\n  [68] “Elements of Geology,” p. 400.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XVII.--Ideal Landscape of the Lower Oolite Period.]\r\n\r\nOn the opposite page (PLATE XVII.) is represented an ideal landscape of\r\nthe period of the Lower Oolite. On the shore are types of the vegetation\r\nof the period. The _Zamites_, with large trunk covered with fan-like\r\nleaves, resembled in form and bearing the existing Zamias of tropical\r\nregions; a _Pterophyllum_, with its stem covered from base to summit\r\nwith its finely-cut feathery leaves; Conifers closely resembling our\r\nCypress, and an arborescent Fern. What distinguishes this sub-period\r\nfrom that of the Lias is a group of magnificent trees, _Pandanus_,\r\nremarkable for their aërial roots, their long leaves, and globular\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nUpon one of the trees of this group the artist has placed the\r\n_Phascolotherium_, not very unlike to our Opossum. It was amongst the\r\nfirst of the Mammalia which appeared in the ancient world. The artist\r\nhas here enlarged the dimensions of the animal in order to show its\r\nform. Let the reader reduce it in imagination one-sixth, for it was not\r\nlarger than an ordinary-sized cat.\r\n\r\nA Crocodile and the fleshless skeleton of the Ichthyosaurus remind us\r\nthat Reptiles still occupied an important place in the animal creation.\r\nA few Insects, especially Dragon-flies, fly about in the air. Ammonites\r\nfloat on the surface of the waves, and the terrible Plesiosaurus, like a\r\ngigantic swan, swims about in the sea. The circular reef of coral, the\r\nwork of ancient Polyps, foreshadows the atolls of the great ocean, for\r\nit was during the Jurassic period that the Polyps of the ancient world\r\nwere most active in the production of coral-reefs and islets.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIDDLE OOLITE.\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial flora of this age was composed of Ferns, Cycads, and\r\nConifers. The first represented by the _Pachypteris microphylla_, the\r\nsecond by _Zamites Moreana_. _Brachyphyllum Moreanum_ and _B. majus_\r\nappear to have been the Conifers most characteristic of the period;\r\nfruits have also been found in the rocks of the period, which appear to\r\nbelong to Palms, but this point is still obscure and doubtful.\r\n\r\nNumerous vestiges of the fauna which animated the period are also\r\nrevealed in the rocks of this age. Certain hemipterous insects appear on\r\nthe earth for the first time, and the Bees among the Hymenoptera,\r\nButterflies among the Lepidoptera, and Dragon-flies among the\r\nNeuroptera. In the bosom of the ocean, or upon its banks, roamed the\r\n_Ichthyosaurus_, _Ceteosaurus_, _Pterodactylus crassirostris_, and the\r\n_Geosaurus_; the latter being very imperfectly known.\r\n\r\nThe Ceteosaurus whose bones have been discovered in the upper beds of\r\nthe Great Oolite at Enslow Rocks, at the Kirtlington Railway Station,\r\nnorth of Oxford, and some other places, was a species of Crocodile\r\nnearly resembling the modern Gavial or Crocodile of the Ganges. This\r\nhuge whale-like reptile has been described by Professor John Phillips as\r\nunmatched in size and strength by any of the largest inhabitants of the\r\nMesozoic land or sea--perhaps the largest animal that ever walked upon\r\nthe earth. A full-grown Ceteosaurus must have been _at least_ fifty feet\r\nlong, ten feet high, and of a proportionate bulk. In its habits it was,\r\nprobably, a marsh-loving or river-side animal, dwelling amidst filicene,\r\ncycadaceous, and coniferous shrubs and trees full of insects and small\r\nmammalia. The one small and imperfect tooth which has been found\r\nresembles that of Iguanodon more than of any other reptile; and it seems\r\nprobable that the Ceteosaurus was nourished by vegetable food, which\r\nabounded in the vicinity of its haunts, and was not obliged to contend\r\nwith the Megalosaurus for a scanty supply of more stimulating diet.[69]\r\n\r\n  [69] For a full account of the Ceteosaurus, see “The Geology of the\r\n       Thames Valley,” by Prof. John Phillips, F.R.S. 1871.\r\n\r\nAnother reptile allied to the Pterodactyle lived in this epoch--the\r\n_Ramphorynchus_, distinguished from the Pterodactyle by a long tail. The\r\nimprints which this curious animal has left upon the sandstone of the\r\nperiod are impressions of its feet and the linear furrow made by its\r\ntail. Like the Pterodactyle, the Ramphorynchus, which was about the size\r\nof a crow, could not precisely fly, but, aided by the wing (a sort of\r\nnatural parachute formed by the membrane connecting the fingers with the\r\nbody), it could throw itself from a height upon its prey. Fig. 119\r\nrepresents a restoration of this animal. The footprints in the soil are\r\nin imitation of those which accompany the remains of the Ramphorynchus\r\nin the Oolitic rocks, and they show the imprints of the anterior and\r\nposterior feet and also the marks made by the tail.\r\n\r\nThis tail was very long, far surpassing in length the rest of the\r\nvertebral column, and consisting of more than thirty vertebræ--which\r\nwere at first short, but rapidly elongate, retain their length for a\r\nconsiderable distance, and then gradually diminish in size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XVIII.--Ideal landscape of the Middle Oolitic Period.]\r\n\r\nAnother genus of Reptiles appears in the Middle Oolite, of which we have\r\nhad a glimpse in the Lias and Great Oolite of the preceding section.\r\nThis is the _Teleosaurus_, which the recent investigations of M. E.\r\nDeslongchamps allow of re-construction. The Teleosaurus enables us to\r\nform a pretty exact idea of these Crocodiles of the ancient seas--these\r\ncuirassed Reptiles, which the German geologist Cotta describes as “the\r\ngreat barons of the kingdom of Neptune, armed to the teeth, and clothed\r\nin an impenetrable panoply; the true filibusters of the primitive seas.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 119.--Ramphorynchus restored. One-quarter natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nThe Teleosaurus resembled the Gavials of India. The former inhabited the\r\nbanks of rivers, perhaps the sea itself; they were longer, more slender,\r\nand more active than the living species; they were about thirty feet in\r\nlength, of which the head may be from three to four feet, with their\r\nenormous jaws sometimes with an opening of six feet, through which they\r\ncould engulf, in the depths of their enormous throat, animals of\r\nconsiderable size.\r\n\r\nThe _Teleosaurus cadomensis_ is represented on the opposite page (PLATE\r\nXVIII.), after the sketch of M. E. Deslongchamps, carrying from the sea\r\nin its mouth a _Geoteuthis_, a species of Calamary of the Oolitic epoch.\r\nThis creature was coated with a cuirass both on the back and belly. In\r\norder to show this peculiarity, a living individual is represented on\r\nthe shore, and a dead one is floating on its back in shallow water,\r\nleaving the ventral cuirass exposed.\r\n\r\nBehind the _Teleosaurus cadomensis_ in the engraving, another Saurian,\r\nthe _Hylæosaurus_, is represented, which makes its appearance in the\r\nCretaceous epoch. We have here adopted the restoration which has been so\r\nably executed by Mr. Waterhouse Hawkins, at the Crystal Palace,\r\nSydenham.\r\n\r\nBesides the numerous Fishes with which the Oolitic seas swarmed, they\r\ncontained some Crustaceans, Cirripedes, and various genera of Mollusca\r\nand Zoophytes. _Eryon arctiformis_, represented in Fig. 119, belongs to\r\nthe class of Crustaceans, of which the spiny lobster is the type. Among\r\nthe Mollusca were some Ammonites, Belemnites, and Oysters, of which many\r\nhundred species have been described. Of these we may mention _Ammonites\r\nrefractus, A. Jason and A. cordatus, Ostrea dilatata, Terebratula\r\ndiphya, Diceras arietena, Belemnites hastatus_, and _B. Puzosianus_. In\r\nsome of the finely-laminated clays the Ammonites are very perfect, but\r\nsomewhat compressed, with the outer lip or margin of the aperture entire\r\n(Fig. 120). Similar prolongations have been noticed in Belemnites found\r\nby Dr. Mantell in the Oxford Clay, near Chippenham.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 120.--Eryon arctiformis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 121.--Perfect Ammonite.]\r\n\r\nAmong the Echinoderms, _Cidaris glandiferus_, _Apiocrinus Roissyanus_,\r\nand _A. rotundus_, the graceful _Saccocoma pectinata_, _Millericrinus\r\nnodotianus_, _Comatula costata_, and _Hemicidaris crenularis_ may be\r\nmentioned; _Apiocrinites rotundus_, figured in PLATE XIX., is a reduced\r\nrestoration: 1, being expanded; _a_, closed; 3, a cross section of\r\nthe upper extremity of the pear-shaped head; 4, a vertical section\r\nshowing the enlargement of the alimentary canal, with the hollow\r\nlenticular spaces which descend through the axis of the column, forming\r\nthe joints, and giving elasticity and flexure to the whole stem, without\r\nrisk of dislocation. _A. rotundus_ is found at Bradford in Wiltshire,\r\nAbbotsbury in Dorset, at Soissons, and Rochelle. This species--known as\r\nthe Bradford Pear-Encrinite--is only found in the strata mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XIX.--Fig. 1.--Apiocrinites rotundus. Fig. 2.--Encrinus\r\nliliiformis.]\r\n\r\nThe Corals of this epoch occur in great abundance. We have already\r\nremarked that these aggregations of Polyps are often met with at a great\r\ndepth in the strata. These small calcareous structures have been formed\r\nin the ancient seas, and the same phenomenon is extending the\r\nterrestrial surface in our days in the seas of Oceania, where reefs and\r\natolls of coral are rising by slow and imperceptible steps, but with no\r\nless certainty. Although their mode of production must always remain to\r\nsome extent a mystery, the investigations of M. Lamaroux, Mr. Charles\r\nDarwin, and M. D’Orbigny have gone a long way towards explaining their\r\noperations; for the Zoophyte in action is an aggregation of these minute\r\nPolyps. Describing what he believes to be a sea-pen, a Zoophyte allied\r\nto _Virgularia Patagonia_, Mr. Darwin says: “It consists of a thin,\r\nstraight, fleshy stem, with alternate rows of polypi on each side, and\r\nsurrounding an elastic stony axis. The stem at one extremity is\r\ntruncate, but at the other is terminated by a vermiform fleshy\r\nappendage. The stony axis which gives strength to the stem, may be\r\ntraced at this extremity into a mere vessel filled with granular matter.\r\nAt low water hundreds of these zoophytes might be seen, projecting like\r\nstubble, with the truncate end upwards, a few inches above the surface\r\nof the muddy sand. When touched or pulled, they drew themselves in\r\nsuddenly, with force, so as nearly or quite to disappear. By this\r\naction, the highly-elastic axis must be bent at the lower extremity,\r\nwhere it is naturally slightly curved; and I imagine it is by this\r\nelasticity alone that the zoophyte is enabled to rise again through the\r\nmud. Each polypus, though closely united to its brethren, has a distinct\r\nmouth, body, and tentacula. Of these polypi, in a large specimen there\r\nmust be many thousands. Yet we see that they act by one movement; that\r\nthey have one central axis, connected with a system of obscure\r\ncirculation.” Such is the brief account given by a very acute observer\r\nof these singular beings. They secrete the calcareous matter held in\r\nsolution in the oceanic waters, and produce the wonderful structures we\r\nhave now under consideration; and these calcareous banks have been in\r\ncourse of formation during many geological ages. They just reach the\r\nlevel of the waters, for the polyps perish as soon as they are so far\r\nabove the surface that neither the waves nor the flow of the tides can\r\nreach them. In the Oolitic rocks these banks are frequently found from\r\ntwelve to fifteen feet thick, and many leagues in length, and\r\npreserving, for the most part, the relative positions which they\r\noccupied in the sea while in course of formation.\r\n\r\nThe rocks which now represent the Middle Oolitic Period are usually\r\ndivided into the _Oxford Clay_, the lower member of which is an\r\narenaceous limestone, known as the _Kellaways Rock_, which in Wiltshire\r\nand other parts of the south-west of England attains a thickness of\r\neight or ten feet, with the impressions of numerous Ammonites, and other\r\nshells. In Yorkshire, around Scarborough, it reaches the thickness of\r\nthirty feet; and forms well-developed beds of bluish-black marl in the\r\ndepartment of Calvados, in France. It is the base of this clay which\r\nforms the soil (_Argile de Dives_) of the valley of the Auge, renowned\r\nfor its rich pasturages and magnificent cattle. The same beds form the\r\nbase of the oddly-shaped but fine rocks of La Manche, which are\r\npopularly known as the _Vaches Noires_ (or black cows)--a locality\r\ncelebrated, also, for its fine Ammonites transformed into pyrites.\r\n\r\nThe _Oxford Clay_ constitutes the base of the hills in the neighbourhood\r\nof Oxford, forming a bed of clay sometimes more than 600 feet thick. It\r\nis found well-developed in France, at Trouville, in the department of\r\nthe Calvados; and at Neuvisy, in the department of the Ardennes, where\r\nit attains a thickness of about 300 feet. It is a bluish, sometimes\r\nwhitish limestone (often argillaceous), and bluish marl. The _Gryphæa\r\ndilatata_ is the most common fossil in the Oxford Clay. The _Coral Rag_\r\nis so called from the fact that the limestone of which it is chiefly\r\ncomposed consists, in part, of an aggregation of considerable masses of\r\npetrified Corals; not unlike those now existing in the Pacific Ocean,\r\nsupposing them to be covered up for ages and fossilised. This coral\r\nstratum extends through the hills of Berkshire and North Wilts, and it\r\noccurs again near Scarborough. In the counties of Dorset, Bedford,\r\nBuckingham, and Cambridge, and some other parts of England, the\r\nlimestone of the Coral Rag disappears and is replaced by clay--in which\r\ncase the Oxford Clay is overlaid directly by the Kimeridge Clay. In\r\nFrance it is found in the departments of the Meuse, of the Yonne, of the\r\nAin, of the Charente Inférieure. In the Alps the _Diceras limestone_ is\r\nregarded, by most geologists, as coeval with the English Coral Rag.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPPER OOLITE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 122.--Bird of Solenhofen (Archæopteryx).]\r\n\r\nSome marsupial Mammals have left their remains in the Upper Oolite as in\r\nthe Lower. They belong to the genus _Sphalacotherium_. Besides the\r\nPlesiosauri and Teleosauri, there still lived in the maritime regions a\r\nCrocodile, the _Macrorhynchus_; and the monstrous _Pœcilopleuron_, with\r\nsharp cutting teeth, one of the most formidable animals of this epoch;\r\nthe _Hylæosaurus_, _Cetiosaurus_, _Stenosaurus_, and _Streptospondylus_,\r\nand among the Turtles, the _Emys_ and _Platemys_. As in the Lower\r\nOolite, so also in the Upper, Insects similar to those by which we are\r\nsurrounded, pursued their flight in the meadows and hovered over the\r\nsurface of the water. Of these, however, too little is known for us to\r\ngive any very precise indication on the subject of their special\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable fact relating to this period is the appearance of\r\nthe first bird. Hitherto the Mammals, and of these only\r\nimperfectly-organised species, namely, the Marsupials, have alone\r\nappeared. It is interesting to witness birds appearing immediately\r\nafter. In the quarries of lithographic stone at Solenhofen, the remains\r\nof a bird, with feet and feathers, have been found, but without the\r\nhead. These curious remains are represented in Fig. 122, in the position\r\nin which they were discovered. The bird is usually designated the Bird\r\nof Solenhofen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 123.\r\n\r\nShell of Physa fontinalis.]\r\n\r\nThe Oolitic seas of this series contained Fishes belonging to the genera\r\n_Asteracanthus_, _Strephodes_, _Lepidotus_, and _Microdon_. The\r\nCephalopodous Mollusca were not numerous, the predominating genera\r\nbelonging to the Lamellibranchs and to the Gasteropods, which lived on\r\nthe shore. The reef-making Madrepores or Corals were more numerous. A\r\nfew Zoophytes in the fossil state testify to the existence of these\r\nextraordinary animals. The fossils characteristic of the fauna of the\r\nperiod include _Ammonites decipiens_ and _A. giganteus_, _Natica\r\nelegans_ and _hemispherica_, _Ostrea deltoidea_ and _O. virgula_,\r\n_Trigonia gibbosa_, _Pholadomya multicostata_ and _P. acuticostata_,\r\n_Terebratula subsella_, and _Hemicidaris Purbeckensis_. Some _Fishes_,\r\n_Turtles_, _Paludina_, _Physa_ (Fig. 123), _Unio_, _Planorbis_ (Fig.\r\n201), and the little crustacean bivalves, the Cypris, constituted the\r\nfresh-water fauna of the period.\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial flora of the period consisted of Ferns, Cycadeaceæ, and\r\nConifers; in the ponds and swamps some Zosteræ. The _Zosteræ_ are\r\nmonocotyledonous plants of the family of the Naïdaceæ, which grow in the\r\nsandy mud of maritime regions, forming there, with their long, narrow,\r\nand ribbon-like leaves, vast prairies of the most beautiful green. At\r\nlow tides these masses of verdure appear somewhat exposed. They would\r\nform a retreat for a great number of marine animals, and afford\r\nnourishment to others.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XX.--Ideal Landscape of the Upper Oolitic Period.]\r\n\r\nOn the opposite page an ideal landscape of the period (PLATE XX.)\r\nrepresents some of the features of the Upper Oolite, especially the\r\nvegetation of the Jurassic period. The _Sphenophyllum_, among the\r\nTree-ferns, is predominant in this vegetation; some _Pandanas_, a few\r\n_Zamites_, and many _Conifers_, but we perceive no Palms. A coral islet\r\nrises out of the sea, having somewhat of the form of the _atolls_ of\r\nOceania, indicating the importance these formations assumed in the\r\nJurassic period. The animals represented are the _Crocodileimus_ of\r\nJourdan, the _Ramphorynchus_, with the imprints which characterise its\r\nfootsteps, and some of the invertebrated animals of the period, as the\r\n_Asteria_, _Comatula_, _Hemicidaris_, _Pteroceras_. Aloft in the air\r\nfloats the bird of Solenhofen, the _Archæopteryx_, which has been\r\nre-constructed from the skeleton, with the exception of the head, which\r\nremains undiscovered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe rocks which represent the Upper Oolite are usually divided into two\r\nseries: 1. The _Purbeck Beds_; 2. The _Portland Stone and Sand_; and 3.\r\nThe _Kimeridge Clay_.\r\n\r\nThe _Kimeridge Clay_, which in many respects bears a remarkable\r\nresemblance to the Oxford Clay, is composed of blue or yellowish\r\nargillaceous beds, which occur in the state of clay and shale\r\n(containing locally beds of bituminous schist, sometimes forming a sort\r\nof earthy impure coal), and several hundred feet in thickness. These\r\nbeds are well developed at Kimeridge, in Dorsetshire, whence the clay\r\ntakes its name. In some parts of Wiltshire the beds of bituminous matter\r\nhave a shaly appearance, but there is an absence of the impressions of\r\nplants which usually accompany the bitumen, derived from the\r\ndecomposition of plants. These rocks, with their characteristic fossils,\r\n_Cardium striatulum_ and _Ostrea deltoidea_, are found throughout\r\nEngland: in France, at Tonnerre, Dept. Yonne; at Havre; at Honfleur; at\r\nMauvage; in the department of the Meuse it is so rich in shells of\r\n_Ostrea deltoidea_ and _O. virgula_, that, “near Clermont in Argonne, a\r\nfew leagues from St. Menehould,” says Lyell,[70] “where these indurated\r\nmarls crop out from beneath the Gault, I have seen them (_Gryphæa\r\nvirgula_) on decomposing leave the surface of every ploughed field\r\nliterally strewed over with this fossil oyster.”\r\n\r\n  [70] “Elements of Geology,” p. 393.\r\n\r\nThe second section of this series consists of the oolitic limestone of\r\nPortland, which is quarried in the Isle of Portland and in the cliffs of\r\nthe Isle of Purbeck in Dorsetshire, and also at Chilmark in the Vale of\r\nWardour, in Wiltshire. In France, the Portland beds are found near\r\nBoulogne, at Cirey-le-Château, Auxerre, and Gray (Haute Saône).\r\n\r\nThe Isle, or rather peninsula of Portland,[71] off the Dorsetshire\r\ncoast, rises considerably above the sea-level, presenting on the side of\r\nthe port a bold line of cliffs, connected with the mainland by the\r\nChesil bank,[72] an extraordinary formation, consisting of a beach of\r\nshingle and pebbles loosely piled on the blue Kimeridge clay, and\r\nstretching ten miles westward along the coast. The quarries are chiefly\r\nsituated in the northerly part of the island. The story told of this\r\nremarkable island is an epitome of the revolutions the surface of the\r\nearth has undergone. The slaty Purbeck beds which overlie the Portland\r\nstone are of a dark-yellowish colour; they are burnt in the\r\nneighbourhood for lime. The next bed is of a whiter and more lively\r\ncolour. It is the stone of which the portico of St. Paul’s and many of\r\nthe houses of London, built in Queen Anne’s time, were constructed. The\r\nbuilding-stone contains fossils exclusively marine. Upon this stratum\r\nrests a bed of limestone formed in lacustrine waters. Finally, upon this\r\nbed rests another deposit of a substance which consists of very\r\nwell-preserved vegetable earth or _humus_, quite analogous to our\r\nvegetable soil, of the thickness of from fifteen to eighteen inches, and\r\nof a blackish colour; it contains a strong proportion of carbonaceous\r\nearth; it abounds in the silicified remains of Conifers and other\r\nplants, analogous to the _Zamia_ and _Cycas_--this soil is known as the\r\n“dirt-bed.” The trunks of great numbers of silicified trees and tropical\r\nplants are found here erect, their roots fixed in the soil, and of\r\nspecies differing from any of our forest trees. “The ruins of a forest\r\nupon the ruins of a sea,” says Esquiros, “the trunks of these trees were\r\npetrified while still growing. The region now occupied by the narrow\r\nchannel and its environs had been at first a sea, in whose bed the\r\nOolitic deposits which now form the Portland stone accumulated: the bed\r\nof the sea gradually rose and emerged from the waves. Upon the land thus\r\nrescued from the deep, plants began to grow; they now constitute with\r\ntheir ruins the soil of the dirt-bed. This soil, with its forest of\r\ntrees, was afterwards plunged again into the waters--not the bitter\r\nwaters of the ocean, but in the fresh waters of a lake formed at the\r\nmouth of some great river.”\r\n\r\n  [71] For details respecting these strata the reader may consult, with\r\n       advantage, the useful handbook to the geology of Weymouth and\r\n       Portland, by Robert Damon.\r\n\r\n  [72] See Bristow and Whitaker “On the Chesil Bank,” _Geol. Mag._, vol.\r\n       vi., p. 433.\r\n\r\nTime passed on, however; a calcareous sediment brought from the interior\r\nby the waters, formed a layer of mud over the dirt-bed; finally, the\r\nwhole region was covered by a succession of calcareous deposits, until\r\nthe day when the Isle of Portland was again revealed to light. “From the\r\nfacts observed,” says Lyell, “we may infer:--1. That those beds of the\r\nUpper Oolite, called the Portland, which are full of marine shells, were\r\noverspread with fluviatile mud, which became dry land, and covered with\r\na forest, throughout a portion of space now occupied by the south of\r\nEngland, the climate being such as to admit of the growth of the _Zamia_\r\nand _Cycas_. 2. This land at length sank down and was submerged with its\r\nforest beneath a body of fresh water from which sediment was thrown down\r\nenveloping fluviatile shells. 3. The regular and uniform preservation of\r\nthis thin bed of black earth over a distance of many miles, shows that\r\nthe change from dry land to the state of a fresh-water lake, or estuary,\r\nwas not accompanied by any violent denudation or rush of water, since\r\nthe loose black earth, together with the trees which lay prostrate on\r\nits surface, must inevitably have been swept away had any such violent\r\ncatastrophe taken place.”[73]\r\n\r\n  [73] “Elements of Geology,” p. 389.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 124.--Geological humus. _a_, Fresh-water calcareous\r\nslate (Purbeck); _b_, Dirt-bed, with roots and stems of trees; _c_,\r\nFresh-water beds; _d_, Portland Stone.]\r\n\r\nThe soil known as the _dirt-bed_ is nearly horizontal in the Isle of\r\nPortland; but we discover it again not far from there in the sea-cliffs\r\nof the Isle of Purbeck, having an inclination of 45°, where the trunks\r\ncontinue perfectly parallel among themselves, affording a fine example\r\nof a change in the position of beds originally horizontal. Fig. 124\r\nrepresents this species of geological _humus_. “Each _dirt-bed_” says\r\nSir Charles Lyell, “may, no doubt, be the memorial of many thousand\r\nyears or centuries, because we find that two or three feet of vegetable\r\nsoil is the only monument which many a tropical forest has left of its\r\nexistence ever since the ground on which it now stands was first covered\r\nwith its shade.”[74]\r\n\r\n  [74] Ibid, p. 391.\r\n\r\nThis bed of vegetable soil is, then, near the summit of that long and\r\ncomplicated series of beds which constitute the Jurassic period; these\r\nruins, still vegetable, remind us forcibly of the coal-beds, for they\r\nare nothing else than a less advanced state of that kind of vegetable\r\nfossilisation which was perfected on such an immense scale, and during\r\nan infinite length of time in the coal period.\r\n\r\nThe Purbeck beds, which are sometimes subdivided into Lower, Middle, and\r\nUpper, are mostly fresh-water formations, intimately connected with the\r\nUpper Portland beds. But there they begin and end, being scarcely\r\nrecognisable except in Dorsetshire, in the sea-cliffs of which they were\r\nfirst studied. They are finely exposed in Durdlestone Bay, near Swanage,\r\nand at Lulworth Cove, on the same coast. The _lower beds_ consist of a\r\npurely fresh-water marl, eighty feet thick, containing shells of\r\n_Cypris_, _Limnæa_, and some _Serpulæ_ in a bed of marl of\r\nbrackish-water origin, and some _Cypris_-bearing shales, strangely\r\nbroken up at the west end of the Isle of Purbeck.\r\n\r\nThe _Middle series_ consists of twelve feet of marine strata known as\r\nthe “cinder-beds,” formed of a vast accumulation of _Ostrea distorta_,\r\nresting on fresh-water strata full of _Cypris fasciculata_, _Planorbis_,\r\nand _Limnæa_, by which this strata has been identified as far inland as\r\nthe vale of Wardour in Wiltshire. Above the cinder-beds are shales and\r\nlimestones, partly of fresh-water and partly of brackish-water origin,\r\nin which are Fishes, many species of Lepidotus, and the crocodilian\r\nreptile, _Macrorhynchus_. On this rests a purely marine deposit, with\r\n_Pecten_, _Avicula_, &c. Above, again, are brackish beds with _Cyrena_,\r\noverlying which is thirty feet of fresh-water limestone, with _Fishes_,\r\n_Turtles_, and _Cyprides_.\r\n\r\nThe _upper beds_ are purely fresh-water strata, about fifty feet thick,\r\ncontaining _Paludina_, _Physa_, _Limnæa_, all very abundant. In these\r\nbeds the Purbeck marble, formerly much used in the ornamental\r\narchitecture of the old English cathedrals, was formerly quarried. (See\r\nNote, page 274.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few words may be added, in explanation of the term _oolite_, applied\r\nto this sub-period of the Jurassic formation. In a great number of rocks\r\nof this series the elements are neither crystalline nor amorphous--they\r\nare, as we have already said, oolitic; that is to say, the mass has the\r\nform of the roe of certain fishes. The question naturally enough arises,\r\nWhence this singular oolitic structure assumed by the components of\r\ncertain rocks? It is asserted that the grinding action of the sea acting\r\nupon the precipitated limestone produces rounded forms analogous to\r\ngrains of sand. This hypothesis may be well founded in some cases. The\r\nmarine sediments which are deposited in some of the warm bays of\r\nTeneriffe are found to take the spheroidal granulated form of the\r\noolite. But these local facts cannot be made to apply to the whole\r\nextent of the oolitic formations. We must, therefore, look further for\r\nan explanation of the phenomena.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted that if the cascades of Tivoli, for example, can give\r\nbirth to the oolitic grains, the same thing happens in the quietest\r\nbasins, that in stalactite-caverns oolitic grains develop themselves,\r\nwhich afterwards, becoming cemented together from the continued, but\r\nvery slow, affluence of the calcareous waters, give rise to certain\r\nkinds of oolitic rocks.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is known that nodules, more or less large, develop\r\nthemselves in marls in consequence of the concentration of the\r\ncalcareous elements, without the possibility of any wearing action of\r\nwater. Now, as there exists every gradation of size between the smallest\r\noolitic grains and the largest concretions, it is reasonable to suppose\r\nthat the oolites are equally the product of concentration.\r\n\r\nFinally, from research to research, it is found that perfectly\r\nconstituted oolites--that is to say, concentric layers, as in the\r\nJurassic limestone--develop themselves in vegetable earth in places\r\nwhere the effects of water in motion is not more admissible than in the\r\npreceding instances.\r\n\r\nThus we arrive at the conclusion, that if Nature sometimes forms\r\ncrystals with perfect terminations in magmas in the course of\r\nsolidification, she gives rise also to spheroidal forms surrounding\r\nvarious centres, which sometimes originate spontaneously, and in other\r\ncases are accumulated round the débris of fossils, or even mere grains\r\nof sand. Nevertheless, all mineral substances are not alike calculated\r\nto produce oolitic rocks; putting aside some particular cases, this\r\nproperty is confined to limestone and oxide of iron.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith regard to the distribution of the Jurassic formation on the\r\nterrestrial globe, it may be stated that the Cotteswold Hills in\r\nEngland, and in France the Jura mountains, are almost entirely composed\r\nof these rocks, the several series of beds being all represented in\r\nthem--this circumstance, in fact, induced Von Humboldt to name the\r\nformation after this latter range. The Upper Lias also exists in the\r\nPyrenees and in the Alps; in Spain; in many parts of Northern Italy; in\r\nRussia, especially in the government of Moscow, and in the Crimea; but\r\nit is in Germany where it occupies the most important place. A thin bed\r\nof oolitic limestone presents, at Solenhofen in Bavaria, a geological\r\nrepository of great celebrity, containing fossil Plants, Fishes,\r\nInsects, Crustaceans, with some Pterodactyles, admirably preserved; it\r\nyielded also some of the earliest of the feathered race. The fine\r\nquarries of lithographic stone at Pappenheim, so celebrated all over\r\nEurope, belong to the Jurassic formation.\r\n\r\nIt has recently been announced that these rocks have been found in\r\nIndia; they contribute largely to the formation of the main mass of the\r\nHimalayas, and to the chain of the Andes in South America; finally, from\r\nrecent investigations, they seem to be present in New Zealand.\r\n\r\nIn England the Lias constitutes a well-defined belt about thirty miles\r\nbroad, extending from Dorsetshire, in the south, to Yorkshire, in the\r\nnorth, formed of alternate beds of clay, shales, and limestone (with\r\nlayers of jet), on the coast near Whitby. It is rich, as we have seen,\r\nin ancient life, and that in the strongest forms imaginable. From the\r\nunequal hardness of the rocks it comprises, it stands out boldly in some\r\nof the minor ranges of hills, adding greatly to the picturesque beauty\r\nof the scenery in the centre of the country. In Scotland the formation\r\noccupies a very limited space.\r\n\r\nA map of the country at the close of the Jurassic period would probably\r\nshow double the extent of dry land in the British Islands, compared with\r\nwhat it displayed as an island in the primordial ocean; but Devon and\r\nCornwall had long risen from the sea, and it is probable that the\r\nJurassic beds of Dorsetshire and France were connected by a tongue of\r\nland running from Cherbourg to the Liassic beds of Dorsetshire, and that\r\nBoulogne, still an island, was similarly connected with the Weald.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 125.--Crioceras Duvallii, Sowerby. A non-involuted\r\nAmmonite. (Neocomian.)]\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--Sections of the Purbeck strata of Dorsetshire have been\r\n    constructed by Mr. Bristow, from actual measurement, in the\r\n    several localities in the Isle of Purbeck, where they are most\r\n    clearly and instructively displayed.\r\n\r\n    These sections, published by the Geological Survey, show in\r\n    detail the beds in their regular and natural order of\r\n    succession, with the thickness, mineral character, and contents,\r\n    as well as the fossils, of each separate bed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRETACEOUS PERIOD.\r\n\r\nThe name _Cretaceous_ (from _creta_, chalk) is given to this epoch in\r\nthe history of our globe because the rocks deposited by the sea, towards\r\nits close, are almost entirely composed of chalk (carbonate of lime).\r\n\r\nCarbonate of lime, however, does not now appear for the first time as a\r\npart of the earth’s crust; we have already seen limestone occurring,\r\namong the terrestrial materials, from the Silurian period; the Jurassic\r\nformation is largely composed of carbonate of lime in many of its beds,\r\nwhich are enormous in number as well as extent; it appears, therefore,\r\nthat in the period called _Cretaceous_ by geologists, carbonate of lime\r\nwas no new substance in the constitution of the globe. If geologists\r\nhave been led to give this name to the period, it is because it accords\r\nbetter than any other with the characteristics of the period; with the\r\nvast accumulations of chalky or earthy limestone in the Paris basin, and\r\nthe beds of so-called Greensand, and Chalk of the same age, so largely\r\ndeveloped in England.\r\n\r\nWe have already endeavoured to establish the origin of lime, in speaking\r\nof the Silurian and Devonian periods, but it may be useful to\r\nrecapitulate the explanation here, even at the risk of repeating\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nWe have said that lime was, in all probability, introduced to the globe\r\nby thermal waters flowing abundantly through the fissures, dislocations,\r\nand fractures in the ground, which were themselves caused by the gradual\r\ncooling of the globe; the central nucleus being the grand reservoir and\r\nsource of the materials which form the solid crust. In the same manner,\r\ntherefore, as the several eruptive substances--such as granites,\r\nporphyries, trachytes, basalts, and lava--have been ejected, so have\r\nthermal waters charged with carbonate of lime, and often accompanied by\r\nsilica, found their way to the surface in great abundance, through the\r\nfissures, fractures, and dislocations in the crust of the earth. We need\r\nonly mention here the Iceland geysers, the springs of Plombières, and\r\nthe well-known thermal springs of Bath and elsewhere in this country.\r\n\r\nBut how comes lime in a state of bicarbonate, dissolved in these\r\nthermal waters, to form rocks? That is what we propose to explain.\r\n\r\nDuring the primary geological periods, thermal waters, as they reached\r\nthe surface, were discharged into the sea and united themselves with the\r\nwaves of the vast primordial ocean, and the waters of the sea became\r\nsensibly calcareous--they contained, it is believed, from one to two per\r\ncent. of lime. The innumerable animals, especially Zoophytes, and\r\nMollusca with solid shells, with which the ancient seas swarmed,\r\nsecreted this lime, out of which they built up their mineral\r\ndwelling--or shell. In this liquid and chemically calcareous medium, the\r\nForaminifera and Polyps of all forms swarmed, forming an innumerable\r\npopulation. Now what became of the bodies of these creatures after\r\ndeath? They were of all sizes, but chiefly microscopic; that is, so\r\nsmall as to be individually all but invisible to the naked eye. The\r\nperishable animal matter disappeared in the bosom of the waters by\r\ndecomposition, but there still remained behind the indestructible\r\ninorganic matter, that is to say, the carbonate of lime forming their\r\ntestaceous covering; these calcareous deposits accumulating in thick\r\nbeds at the bottom of the sea, became compacted into a solid mass, and\r\nformed a series of continuous beds superimposed on each other. These,\r\nincreasing imperceptibly in the course of ages, ultimately formed the\r\nrocks of the _Cretaceous_ period, which we have now under consideration.\r\n\r\nThese statements are not, as the reader might conceive from their\r\nnature, a romantic conception invented to please the imagination of\r\nthose in search of a system--the time is past when geology should be\r\nregarded as the romance of Nature--nor has what we advance at all the\r\ncharacter of an arbitrary conception. One is no doubt struck with\r\nsurprise on learning, for the first time, that all the limestone rocks,\r\nall the calcareous stones employed in the construction of our dwellings,\r\nour cities, our castles and cathedrals, were deposited in the seas of an\r\nearlier world, and are only composed of an aggregation of shells of\r\nMollusca, or fragments of the testaceous coverings of Foraminifera and\r\nother Zoophytes--nay, that they were secreted from the water itself, and\r\nthen assimilated by these minute creatures, and that this would appear\r\nto have been the great object of their creation in such myriads. Whoever\r\nwill take the trouble to observe, and reflect on what he observes, will\r\nfind all his doubts vanish. If chalk be examined with a microscope, it\r\nwill be found to be composed of the remains of numerous Zoophytes, of\r\nminute and divers kinds of shells, and, above all, of Foraminifera, so\r\nsmall that their very minuteness seems to have rendered them\r\nindestructible. A hundred and fifty of these small beings placed end to\r\nend, in a line, will only occupy the space of about one-twelfth part of\r\nan inch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chalk under the Microscope.\r\n\r\nFig. 126.--Chalk of Meudon (magnified).]\r\n\r\nMuch of this curious information was unknown, or at least only\r\nsuspected, when Ehrenberg began his microscopical investigations. From\r\nsmall samples of chalk reduced to powder, placed upon the object-glass,\r\nand examined under the microscope, Ehrenberg prepared the designs which\r\nwe reproduce from his learned micrographical work, in which some of the\r\nelegant forms discovered in the Chalk are illustrated, greatly\r\nmagnified. Fig. 126 represents the chalk of Meudon, in France, in which\r\nammonite-like forms of Foraminifera and others, equally beautiful,\r\nappear. Fig. 127, from the chalk of Gravesend, contains similar objects.\r\nFig. 128 is an example of chalk from the island of Moën, in Denmark;\r\nand Fig. 129, that which is found in the Tertiary rocks of Cattolica, in\r\nSicily. In all these the shells of Ammonites appear, with clusters of\r\nround Foraminifera and other Zoophytes. In two of these engravings\r\n(Figs. 126 and 128), the chalk is represented in two modes--in the upper\r\nhalf, by transparency or transmitted light; in the lower half, the mass\r\nis exhibited by superficial or reflected light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chalk under the Microscope.\r\n\r\nFig. 127.--Chalk of Gravesend. (After Ehrenberg).--Magnified.]\r\n\r\nObservation, then, establishes the truth of the explanation we have\r\ngiven concerning the formation of the chalky or Cretaceous rocks; but\r\nthe question still remains--How did these rocks, originally deposited in\r\nthe sea, become elevated into hills of great height, with bold\r\nescarpments, like those known in England as the North and South Downs?\r\nThe answer to this involves the consideration of other questions which\r\nhave, at present, scarcely got beyond hypothesis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chalk under the Microscope.\r\n\r\nFig. 128.--Chalk of the Isle of Moën, Denmark.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chalk under the Microscope.\r\n\r\nFig. 129.--Chalk of Cattolica, Sicily (magnified).]\r\n\r\nDuring and after the deposition of the Portland and Purbeck beds, the\r\nentire Oolite Series, in the south and centre of England and other\r\nregions, was raised above the sea-level and became dry land. Above these\r\nPurbeck beds, as Professor Ramsay tells us [in the district known as the\r\nWeald], “we have a series of beds of clays, sandstones, and shelly\r\nlimestones, indicating by their fossils that they were deposited in an\r\nestuary where fresh water and occasionally brackish water and marine\r\nconditions prevailed. The Wealden and Purbeck beds indeed represent the\r\ndelta of an immense river which in size may have rivalled the Ganges,\r\nMississippi, Amazon, &c., and whose waters carried down to its mouth the\r\nremains of land-plants, small Mammals, and great terrestrial Reptiles,\r\nand mingled them with the remains of Fishes, Molluscs, and other forms\r\nnative to its waters. I do not say that this immense river was formed\r\nor supplied by the drainage of what we now call Great Britain--I do not\r\nindeed know where this continent lay, but I do know that England formed\r\na part of it, and that in size it must have been larger than Europe, and\r\nwas probably as large as Asia, or the great continent of America.”\r\nSpeaking of the geographical extent of the Wealden, Sir Charles Lyell\r\nsays: “It cannot be accurately laid down, because so much of it is\r\nconcealed beneath the newer marine formations. It has been traced about\r\n200 miles from west to east; from the coast of Dorsetshire to near\r\nBoulogne, in France; and nearly 200 miles from north-west to\r\nsouth-east, from Surrey and Hampshire to Beauvais, in France;”[75] but\r\nhe expresses doubt, supposing the formation to have been continuous, if\r\nthe two areas were contemporaneous, the region having undergone frequent\r\nchanges, the great estuary having altered its form, and even shifted its\r\nplace. Speaking of a hypothetical continent, Sir Charles Lyell says: “If\r\nit be asked where the continent was placed from the ruins of which the\r\nWealden strata were derived, and by the drainage of which a great river\r\nwas fed, we are half tempted to speculate on the former existence of the\r\nAtlantis of Plato. The story of the submergence of an ancient continent,\r\nhowever fabulous in history, must have been true again and again as a\r\ngeological event.”[76]\r\n\r\n  [75] “Elements of Geology,” p. 349.\r\n\r\n  [76] Ibid, p. 350.\r\n\r\nThe proof that the Wealden series were accumulated under fresh-water\r\nconditions and as a river deposit[77] lies partly in the nature of the\r\nstrata, but chiefly in the nature of the organic remains. The fish give\r\nno positive proof, but a number of Crocodilian reptiles give more\r\nconclusive evidence, together with the shells, most of them being of\r\nfresh-water origin, such as Paludina, Planorbis, Lymnæa, Physa, and such\r\nlike, which are found living in many ponds and rivers of the present\r\nday. Now and then we find bands of marine remains, not mixed with\r\nfresh-water deposits, but interstratified with them; showing that at\r\ntimes the mouth and delta of the river had sunk a little, and that it\r\nhad been invaded by the sea; then by gradual change it was lifted up,\r\nand became an extensive fresh-water area. This episode at last comes to\r\nan end by the complete submergence of the Wealden area; and upon these\r\nfresh-water strata a set of marine sands and clays, and upon these again\r\nthick beds of pure white earthy limestone of the Cretaceous period were\r\ndeposited. The lowest of these formations is known as the Lower\r\nGreensand; then followed the clays of the Gault, which were succeeded by\r\nthe Upper Greensand. Then, resting upon the Upper Greensand, comes the\r\nvast mass of Chalk which in England consists of soft white earthy\r\nlimestone, containing, in the upper part, numerous bands of\r\ninterstratified flints, which were mostly sponges originally, that have\r\nsince become silicified and converted into flint. The strata of chalk\r\nwhere thickest are from 1,000 to 1,200 feet in thickness. Their upheaval\r\ninto dry land brought this epoch to an end; the conditions which had\r\ncontributed to its formation ceased in our area, and as the uppermost\r\nmember of the Secondary rocks, it closes the record of Mesozoic times in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n  [77] “The Physical Geology and Geography of Great Britain,” by A. C.\r\n       Ramsay, F.R.S., p. 64.\r\n\r\nLet us add, to remove any remaining doubts, that in the basin of a\r\nmodern European sea--the Baltic--a curious assemblage of phenomena,\r\nbearing on the question, is now in operation. The bed and coast-line of\r\nthe Baltic continue slowly but unceasingly to rise, and have done so for\r\nseveral centuries, in consequence of the constant deposit which takes\r\nplace of calcareous shells, added to the natural accumulations of sand\r\nand mud. The Baltic Sea will certainly be filled up in time by these\r\ndeposits, and this modern phenomenon, which we find in progress, so to\r\nspeak, brings directly under our observation an explanation of the\r\nmanner in which the cretaceous rocks were produced in the ancient world,\r\nmore especially when taken in connection with another branch of the same\r\nsubject to which Sir Charles Lyell called attention, in an address to\r\nthe Geological Society. It appears that just as the northern part of the\r\nScandinavian continent is now rising, and while the middle part south of\r\nStockholm remains unmoved, the southern extremity in Scania is sinking,\r\nor at least has sunk, within the historic period; from which he argues\r\nthat there may have been a slow upheaval in one region, while the\r\nadjoining one was stationary, or in course of submergence.\r\n\r\nAfter these explanations as to the manner in which the cretaceous rocks\r\nwere formed, let us examine into the state of animal and vegetable life\r\nduring this important period in the earth’s history.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable kingdom of this period forms an introduction to the\r\nvegetation of the present time. Placed at the close of the Secondary\r\nepoch, this vegetation prepares us for transition, as it were, to the\r\nvegetation of the Tertiary epoch, which, as we shall see, has a great\r\naffinity with that of our own times.\r\n\r\nThe landscapes of the ancient world have hitherto shown us some species\r\nof plants of forms strange and little known, which are now extinct. But\r\nduring the period whose history we are tracing, the vegetable kingdom\r\nbegins to fashion itself in a less mysterious manner; Palms appear, and\r\namong the regular species we recognise some which differ little from\r\nthose of the tropics of our days. The dicotyledons increase slightly in\r\nnumber amid Ferns and Cycads, which have lost much of their importance\r\nin numbers and size; we observe an obvious increase in the dicotyledons\r\nof our own temperate climate, such as the alder, the wych-elm, the\r\nmaple, and the walnut, &c.\r\n\r\n“As we retire from the times of the primitive creation,” says Lecoq,\r\n“and slowly approach those of our own epoch, the sediments seem to\r\nwithdraw themselves from the polar regions and restrict themselves to\r\nthe temperate or equatorial zones. The great beds of sand and\r\nlimestone, which constitute the Cretaceous formation, announce a state\r\nof things very different from that of the preceding ages. The seasons\r\nare no longer marked by indications of central heat; zones of latitude\r\nalready show signs of their existence.\r\n\r\n“Hitherto two classes of vegetation predominated: the cellular\r\n_Cryptogams_ at first, the dicotyledonous _Gymnosperms_ afterwards; and\r\nin the epoch which we have reached--the transition epoch of\r\nvegetation--the two classes which have reigned heretofore become\r\nenfeebled, and a third, the dicotyledonous _Angiosperms_, timidly take\r\npossession of the earth--they consist at first of a small number of\r\nspecies, and occupy only a small part of the soil, of which they\r\nafterwards take their full share; and in the succeeding periods, as in\r\nour own times, we shall see that their reign is firmly established;\r\nduring the Cretaceous period, in short, we witness the appearance of the\r\nfirst dicotyledonous _Angiosperms_. Some arborescent Ferns still\r\nmaintain their position, and the elegant _Protopteris Singeri_,\r\nPreissl., and P. _Buvigneri_, Brongn., still unfold their light fronds\r\nto the winds of this period. Some _Pecopteri_, differing from the\r\nWealden species, live along with them. Some _Zamites_, _Cycads_, and\r\n_Zamiostrobi_ announce that in the Cretaceous period the temperature was\r\nstill high. New Palms show themselves, and, among others, _Flabellaria\r\nchamæropifolia_ is especially remarkable for the majestic crown at its\r\nsummit.\r\n\r\n“The _Conifers_ have endured better than the _Cycadeæ_; they formed\r\nthen, as now, great forests, where _Damarites_, _Cunninghamias_,\r\n_Araucarias_, _Eleoxylons_, _Abietites_, and _Pinites_ remind us of\r\nnumerous forms still existing, but dispersed all over the earth.\r\n\r\n“From this epoch date the _Comptonias_, attributed to the Myricaceæ;\r\n_Almites Friesii_, Nils., which we consider as one of the Betulaceæ;\r\n_Carpinites arenaceus_, Gœp., which is one of the Cupuliferæ; the\r\n_Salicites_, which are represented to us by the arborescent willows; the\r\nAcerinæ would have their _Acerites cretaceæ_, Nils., and the Juglanditæ,\r\nthe _Juglandites elegans_, Gœp. But the most interesting botanical event\r\nof this period is the appearance of the _Credneria_, with its\r\ntriple-veined leaves, of which no less than eight species have been\r\nfound and described, but whose place in the systems of classification\r\nstill remains uncertain. The _Crednerias_, like the _Salicites_, were\r\ncertainly trees, as were most of the species of this remote epoch.”\r\n\r\nIn the following illustration are represented two of the Palms belonging\r\nto the Cretaceous period, restored from the imprints and fragments of\r\nthe fossil remains left by the trunk and branches in the rocks of the\r\nperiod (Fig. 130.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 130.--Fossil Palms restored.]\r\n\r\nBut if the vegetation of the Cretaceous period exhibits sensible signs\r\nof approximation to that of our present era, we cannot say the same of\r\nthe animal creation. The time has not yet come when Mammals analogous to\r\nthose of our epoch gave animation to the forests, plains, and shores of\r\nthe ancient world; even the Marsupial Mammals, which made their\r\nappearance in the Liassic and Oolitic formations, no longer exist, so\r\nfar as is known, and no others of the class have taken their place. No\r\nclimbing Opossum, with its young ones, appears among the leaves of the\r\nZamites. The earth appears to be still tenanted by Reptiles, which alone\r\nbreak the solitudes of the woods and the silence of the valleys. The\r\nReptiles, which seem to have swarmed in the seas of the Jurassic period,\r\npartook of the crocodilian organisation, and those of this period seem\r\nto bear more resemblance to the Lizards of our day. In this period the\r\nremains of certain forms indicate that they stood on higher legs; they\r\nno longer creep on the earth, and this is apparently the only\r\napproximation which seems to connect them more closely with higher\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nIt is not without surprise that we advert to the immense development,\r\nthe extraordinary dimensions which the Saurian family attained at this\r\nepoch. These animals which, in our days, rarely exceed a yard or so in\r\nlength, attained in the Cretaceous period as much as twenty. The marine\r\nlizard, which we notice under the name of _Mosasaurus_, was then the\r\nscourge of the seas, playing the part of the Ichthyosauri of the\r\nJurassic period; for, from the age of the Lias to that of the Chalk, the\r\nIchthyosauri, the Plesiosauri, and the Teleosauri were, judging from\r\ntheir organisation, the tyrants of the waters. They appear to have\r\nbecome extinct at the close of the Cretaceous period, and to give place\r\nto the _Mosasaurus_, to whom fell the formidable task of keeping within\r\nproper limits the exuberant production of the various tribes of Fishes\r\nand Crustaceans which inhabited the seas. This creature was first\r\ndiscovered in the celebrated rocks of St. Peter’s Mount at Maestricht,\r\non the banks of the Meuse. The skull alone was about four feet in\r\nlength, while the entire skeleton of _Iguanodon Mantelli_, discovered by\r\nDr. Mantell in the Wealden strata, has since been met with in the\r\nHastings beds of Tilgate Forest, measuring, as Professor Owen estimates,\r\nbetween fifty and sixty feet in length. These enormous Saurians\r\ndisappear in their turn, to be replaced in the seas of the Tertiary\r\nepoch by the Cetaceans; and henceforth animal life begins to assume,\r\nmore and more, the appearance it presents in the actually existing\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\nSeeing the great extent of the seas of the Cretaceous period, Fishes\r\nwere necessarily numerous. The pike, salmon, and dory tribes, analogous\r\nto those of our days, lived in the seas of this period; they fled before\r\nthe sharks and voracious dog-fishes, which now appeared in great\r\nnumbers, after just showing themselves in the Oolitic period.\r\n\r\nThe sea was still full of Polyps, Sea-urchins, Crustaceans of various\r\nkinds, and many genera of Mollusca different from those of the Jurassic\r\nperiod; alongside of gigantic Lizards are whole piles of\r\nanimalculæ--those Foraminifera whose remains are scattered in infinite\r\nprofusion in the Chalk, over an enormous area and of immense thickness.\r\nThe calcareous remains of these little beings, incalculable in number,\r\nhave indeed covered, in all probability, a great part of the terrestrial\r\nsurface. It will give a sufficient idea of the importance of the\r\nCretaceous period in connection with these organisms to state that, in\r\nthe rocks of the period, 268 genera of animals, hitherto unknown, and\r\nmore than 5,000 species of special living beings have been found; the\r\nthickness of the rocks formed during the period being enormous. Where is\r\nthe geologist who will venture to estimate the time occupied in creating\r\nand destroying the animated masses of which this formation is at once\r\nboth the cemetery and the monument? For the purposes of description it\r\nwill be convenient to divide the Cretaceous series into lower and upper,\r\naccording to their relative ages and their peculiar fossils.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOWER CRETACEOUS PERIOD.\r\n\r\n  English equivalents.

So that “we can scarcely hesitate,” says Lyell, “to\r\nrefer the whole to one great delta.”[78]\r\n\r\n  [78] Lyell’s “Elements of Geology,” p. 349.\r\n\r\nThe overlying Weald clay crops out from beneath the Lower Greensand in\r\nvarious parts of Kent and Sussex, and again in the Isle of Wight, and in\r\nthe Isle of Purbeck, where it reappears at the base of the chalk.\r\n\r\nThe upper division (or the Weald clay) is, as we have said, of purely\r\nfresh-water origin, and is supposed to have been the estuary of some\r\nvast river which, like the African Quorra, may have formed a delta some\r\nhundreds of miles broad, as suggested by Dr. Dunker and Von Meyer.\r\n\r\nThe Lower Greensand is known, also, as the _Néocomien_, after Neocomium,\r\nthe Latin name of the city of Neufchatel, in Switzerland, where this\r\nformation is largely developed, and where, also, it was first recognised\r\nand established as a distinct formation. Dr. Fitton, in his excellent\r\nmonograph of the Lower Cretaceous formations, gives the following\r\ndescending succession of rocks as observable in many parts of Kent:--\r\n\r\n                                                           Feet.\r\n\r\n  1. Sand, white, yellowish, or brown, with concretions\r\n     of limestone and chert                                     70\r\n  2. Sand, with green matter                             70 to 100\r\n  3. Calcareous stone, called Kentish rag                60 to  80\r\n\r\nThese divisions, which are traceable more or less from the southern part\r\nof the Isle of Wight to Hythe in Kent, present considerable variations.\r\nAt Atherfield, where sixty-three distinct strata, measuring 843 feet,\r\nhave been noticed, the limestone is wholly wanting, and some fossils\r\nrange through the whole series, while others are confined to particular\r\ndivisions; but Prof. E. Forbes states, that when the same conditions are\r\nrepeated in overlying strata the same species reappear; but that changes\r\nof depth, or of the mineral nature of the sea-bottom, the presence or\r\nabsence of lime or of peroxide of iron, the occurrence of a muddy,\r\nsandy, or gravelly bottom, are marked by the absence of certain species,\r\nand the predominance of others.[79]\r\n\r\n  [79] Ibid, p. 340.\r\n\r\nAmong the marine fauna of the Néocomian series the following are the\r\nprincipal. Among the _Acephala_, one of the largest and most abundant\r\nshells of the lower Néocomian, as displayed in the Atherfield section,\r\nis the large _Perna Mulleti_ (Fig. 131).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 131.--Perna Mulleti. One-quarter natural size.\r\n\r\n_a_, exterior; _b_, part of the upper hinge.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 132.--Hamites. One-third natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe _Scaphites_ have a singular boat-shaped form, wound with contiguous\r\nwhorls in one part, which is detached at the last chamber, and projects\r\nin a more or less elongated condition.\r\n\r\n_Hamites_, _Crioceras_, and _Ancyloceras_ have club-like terminations\r\nat both extremities; they may almost be considered as non-involuted\r\nAmmonites with the spiral evolutions disconnected or partially unrolled,\r\nas in the engraving (Figs. 125 and 132). _Ancyloceras Matheronianus_\r\nseems to have had spines projecting from the ridge of each of the\r\nconvolutions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 133.--Shell of Turritella terebra.\r\n\r\n(Living form.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 134.--Turrillites costatus.\r\n\r\n(Chalk.)]\r\n\r\nThe _Toxoceras_ had the shell also curved, and not spiral.\r\n\r\nThe _Baculites_ had the shell differing from all Cephalopods, inasmuch\r\nas it was elongated, conical, perfectly straight, sometimes very\r\nslender, and tapering to a point.\r\n\r\nThe _Turrilites_ have the shell regular, spiral, and _sinistral_; that\r\nis, turning to the left in an oblique spiral of contiguous whorls. The\r\nengraving will convey the idea of their form (Fig. 134).\r\n\r\nAmong others, as examples of form, we append Figs. 133, 135, 136.\r\n\r\nThis analysis of the marine fauna belonging to the Néocomian formation\r\nmight be carried much further, did space permit, or did it promise to be\r\nuseful; but, without illustration, any further merely verbal description\r\nwould be almost valueless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 135--Terebrirostra lyra.\r\n\r\n_a_, back view; _b_, side view.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 136.--Terebratula deformis.]\r\n\r\nNumerous Reptiles, a few Birds, among which are some “Waders,” belong to\r\nthe genera of _Palæornis_ or _Cimoliornis_; new Molluscs in considerable\r\nquantities, and some extremely varied Zoophytes, constitute the rich\r\nfauna of the Lower Chalk. A glance at the more important of these\r\nanimals, which we only know in a few mutilated fragments, is all our\r\nspace allows; they are true medals of the history of our globe, medals,\r\nit is true, half effaced by time, but which consecrate the memory of\r\ndeparted ages.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1832 Dr. Mantell added to the wonderful discoveries he had\r\nmade in the Weald of Sussex, that of the great Lizard-of-the-woods, the\r\n_hylæosaurus_ (ὑλη, _wood_, σαυρος, _lizard_). This discovery was made\r\nin Tilgate forest, near Cuckfield, and the animal appears to have been\r\nfrom twenty to thirty feet in length. The osteological characters\r\npresented by the remains of the Hylæosaurus are described by Dr. Mantell\r\nas affording another example of the blending of the Crocodilian with the\r\nLacertian type of structure; for we have, in the pectoral arch, the\r\nscapula or omoplate of a crocodile associated with the coracoid of a\r\nlizard. Another remarkable feature in these fossils is the presence of\r\nthe large angular bones or spines, which, there is reason to infer,\r\nconstituted a serrated crest along the middle of the back; and the\r\nnumerous small oval dermal bones which appear to have been arranged in\r\nlongitudinal series along each side of the dorsal fringe.\r\n\r\nThe _Megalosaurus_, the earliest appearance of which is among the more\r\nancient beds of the Liassic and Oolitic series, is again found at the\r\nbase of the Cretaceous rocks. It was, as we have seen, an enormous\r\nlizard, borne upon slightly raised feet; its length exceeded forty feet,\r\nand in bulk it was equal to an elephant seven feet high.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 137.--Lower Jaw of the Megalosaurus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 138.--Tooth of Megalosaurus.]\r\n\r\nThe Megalosaurus found in the ferruginous sands of Cuckfield, in Sussex,\r\nin the upper beds of the Hastings Sands, must have been at least sixty\r\nor seventy feet long. Cuvier considered that it partook both of the\r\nstructure of the Iguana and the Monitors, the latter of which belong to\r\nthe Lacertian Reptiles which haunt the banks of the Nile and tropical\r\nIndia. The Megalosaurus was probably an amphibious Saurian. The\r\ncomplicated structure and marvellous arrangement of the teeth prove that\r\nit was essentially carnivorous. It fed probably on other Reptiles of\r\nmoderate size, such as the Crocodiles and Turtles which are found in a\r\nfossil state in the same beds. The jaw represented in Fig. 137 is the\r\nmost important fragment of the animal we possess. It is the lower jaw,\r\nand supports many teeth: it shows that the head terminated in a straight\r\nmuzzle, thin and flat on the sides, like that of the _Gavial_, the\r\nCrocodile of India. The teeth of the Megalosaurus were in perfect accord\r\nwith the destructive functions with which this formidable creature was\r\nendowed. They partake at once of the nature of a knife, sabre, and saw.\r\nVertical at their junction with the jaw, they assume, with the increased\r\nage of the animal, a backward curve, giving them the form of a\r\ngardener’s pruning-knife (Fig. 138; also _c._ Fig. 179). After\r\nmentioning some other particulars, respecting the teeth, Buckland says:\r\n“With teeth constructed so as to cut with the whole of their concave\r\nedge, each movement of the jaws produced the combined effect of a knife\r\nand a saw, at the same time that the point made a first incision like\r\nthat made by a point of a double-cutting sword. The backward curvature\r\ntaken by the teeth at their full growth renders the escape of the prey\r\nwhen once seized impossible. We find here, then, the same arrangements\r\nwhich enable mankind to put in operation many of the instruments which\r\nthey employ.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 139.--Nasal Horn of Iguanodon.\r\n\r\nTwo-thirds natural size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 140.--Ammonites rostratus.\r\n\r\n(Upper Greensand.)]\r\n\r\nThe _Iguanodon_, signifying _Iguana-toothed_ (from the Greek word,\r\nοδους, _tooth_), was more gigantic still than the Megalosaurus; one of\r\nthe most colossal, indeed, of all the Saurians of the ancient world\r\nwhich research has yet exposed to the light of day. Professor Owen and\r\nDr. Mantell were not agreed as to the form of the tail; the former\r\ngentleman assigning it a short tail, which would affect Dr. Mantell’s\r\nestimate of its probable length of fifty or sixty feet; the largest\r\nthigh-bone yet found measures four feet eight inches in length. The form\r\nand disposition of the feet, added to the existence of a bony horn (Fig.\r\n139), on the upper part of the muzzle or snout, almost identifies it as\r\na species with the existing Iguanas, the only Reptile which is known to\r\nbe provided with such a horn upon the nose; there is, therefore, no\r\ndoubt as to the resemblance between these two animals; but while the\r\nlargest of living Iguanas scarcely exceeds a yard in length, its fossil\r\ncongener was probably fifteen or sixteen times that length. It is\r\ndifficult to resist the feeling of astonishment, not to say incredulity,\r\nwhich creeps over one while contemplating so striking a disproportion as\r\nthat which subsists between this being of the ancient world and its ally\r\nof the new.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 141.--Teeth of Iguanodon.\r\n\r\n_a_, young tooth; _b_, _c_, teeth further advanced, and worn.\r\n\r\n(Wealden.)]\r\n\r\nThe Iguanodon carried, as we have said, a horn on its muzzle; the bone\r\nof its thigh, as we have seen, surpassed that of the Elephant in size;\r\nthe form of the bone and feet demonstrates that it was formed for\r\nterrestrial locomotion; and its dental system shows that it was\r\nherbivorous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 142.--Fishes of the Cretaceous period.\r\n\r\n1, Beryx Lewesiensis; 2, Osmeroides Mantelli.]\r\n\r\nThe teeth (Fig. 141), which are the most important and characteristic\r\norgans of the whole animal, are imbedded laterally in grooves, or\r\nsockets, in the dentary bone; there are three or four sockets of\r\nsuccessional teeth on the inner side of the base of the old teeth. The\r\nplace thus occupied by the edges of the teeth, their trenchant and\r\nsaw-like form, their mode of curvature, the points where they become\r\nbroader or narrower which turn them into a species of nippers or\r\nscissors--are all suitable for cutting and tearing the tough vegetable\r\nsubstances which are also found among the remains buried with this\r\ncolossal reptile, a restoration of which is represented in PLATE XXI.,\r\np. 296.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Cretaceous seas contained great numbers of Fishes, among which some\r\nwere remarkable for their strange forms. The _Beryx Lewesiensis_ (1),\r\nand the _Osmeroides Mantelli_ (2) (Fig. 142), are restorations of these\r\ntwo species as they are supposed to have been in life. The _Odontaspis_\r\nis a new genus of Fishes which may be mentioned. _Ammonites rostratus_\r\n(Fig. 140), and _Exogyra conica_ (Fig. 147), are common shells in the\r\nUpper Greensand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXI.--Ideal scene in the Lower Cretaceous Period, with\r\nIguanodon and Megalosaurus.]\r\n\r\nThe seas of the Lower Cretaceous period were remarkable in a zoological\r\npoint of view for the great number of species and the multiplicity of\r\ngeneric forms of molluscous Cephalopods. The Ammonites assume quite\r\ngigantic dimensions; and we find among them new species distinguished by\r\ntheir furrowed transverse spaces, as in the _Hamites_ (Fig. 132). Some\r\nof the _Ancyloceras_ attained the magnitude of six feet, and other\r\ngenera, as the _Scaphites_, the _Toxoceras_, the _Crioceras_ (Fig. 125),\r\nand other Mollusca, unknown till this period, appeared now. Many\r\nEchinoderms, or sea-urchins, and Zoophytes, have enriched these rocks\r\nwith their animal remains, and would give its seas a condition quite\r\npeculiar.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite page an ideal landscape of the period is represented\r\n(PLATE XXI.), in which the Iguanodon and Megalosaurus struggle for the\r\nmastery in the centre of a forest, which enables us also to convey some\r\nidea of the vegetation of the period. Here we note a vegetation at once\r\nexotic and temperate--a flora like that of the tropics, and also\r\nresembling our own. On the left we observe a group of trees, which\r\nresemble the dicotyledonous plants of our forests. The elegant\r\n_Credneria_ is there, whose botanical place is still doubtful, for its\r\nfruit has not been found, although it is believed to have belonged to\r\nplants with two seed-leaves, or dicotyledonous, and the arborescent\r\nAmentaceæ. An entire group of trees, composed of Ferns and Zamites, are\r\nin the background; in the extreme distance are some Palms. We also\r\nrecognise in the picture the alder, the wych-elm, the maple, and the\r\nwalnut-tree, or at least species analogous to these.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Néocomian beds in France are found in Champagne, in the departments\r\nof the Aube, the Yonne, the Haute-Alps, &c. They are largely developed\r\nin Switzerland at Neufchatel, and in Germany.\r\n\r\n1. The Lower Néocomian consists of marls and greyish clay, alternating\r\nwith thin beds of grey limestone. It is very thick, and occurs at\r\nNeufchatel and in the Drôme. The fossils are _Spatangus retusus_,\r\n_Crioceras_ (Fig. 125), _Ammonites Asterianus_, &c.\r\n\r\n2. _Orgonian_ (the limestone of Orgon). This group exists, also, at\r\nAix-les-Bains in Savoy, at Grenoble, and generally in the thick, white,\r\ncalcareous beds which form the precipices of the Drôme. The fossils\r\n_Chama ammonia_, _Pigaulus_, &c.\r\n\r\n3. The _Aptien_ (or Greensand) consists generally of marls and clay. In\r\nFrance it is found in the department of Vaucluse, at Apt (whence the\r\nname Aptien), in the department of the Yonne, and in the Haute-Marne.\r\nFossils, _Ancyloceras Matheronianus_, _Ostrea aquila_, and _Plicatula\r\nplacunea_. These beds consist here of greyish clay, which is used for\r\nmaking tiles; there of bluish argillaceous limestone, in black or\r\nbrownish flags. In the Isle of Wight it becomes a fine sandstone,\r\ngreyish and slightly argillaceous, which at Havre, and in some parts of\r\nthe country of Bray, become well-developed ferruginous sandstones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 143.--Cypris spinigera.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 144.--Cypris Valdensis.]\r\n\r\nWe have noted that the Lower Néocomian formation, although a marine\r\ndeposit, is in some respects the equivalent of the _Weald Clay_, a\r\nfresh-water formation of considerable importance on account of its\r\nfossils. We have seen that it was either formed at the mouth of a great\r\nriver, or the river was sufficiently powerful for the fresh-water\r\ncurrent to be carried out to sea, carrying with it some animals, forming\r\na fluviatile, or lacustrine fauna, on a small scale. These were small\r\nCrustaceans of the genus _Cypris_, with some molluscous Gasteropoda of\r\nthe genera _Melania_, _Paludina_, and acephalous Mollusca of the five\r\ngenera _Cyrena_, _Unio_, _Mytilus_, _Cyclas_, and _Ostrea_. Of these,\r\n_Cypris spinigera_ (Fig. 143) and _Cypris Valdensis_ (Fig. 144) may be\r\nconsidered as among the most characteristic fossils of this local fauna.\r\n\r\nThe Cretaceous series is not interesting for its fossils alone; it\r\npresents also an interesting subject for study in a mineralogical point\r\nof view. The white Chalk, examined under the microscope by Ehrenberg,\r\nshows a curious globiform structure. The green part of its sandstone and\r\nlimestone constitutes very singular compounds. According to the result\r\nof Berthier’s analysis, we must consider them as silicates of iron. The\r\niron shows itself here not in beds, as in the Jurassic rocks, but in\r\nmasses, in a species of pocket in the Orgonian beds. They are usually\r\nhydrates in the state of hematites, accompanied by quantities of ochre\r\nso abundant that they are frequently unworkable. In the south of France\r\nthese veins were mined to a great depth by the ancient monks, who were\r\nthe metallurgists of their age. But for the artist the important\r\nOrgonian beds possess a special interest; their admirable vertical\r\nfractures, their erect perpendicular peaks, each surpassing the other in\r\nboldness, form his finest studies. In the Var, the defiles of Vésubia,\r\nof the Esteron, and Tinéa, are jammed up between walls of peaks, for\r\nmany hundreds of yards, between which there is scarcely room for a\r\nnarrow road by the side of the roaring torrent. “In the Drôme,” says\r\nFournet, “the entrance to the beautiful valley of the Vercors is closed\r\nduring a part of the year, because, in order to enter, it is necessary\r\nto cross the two gullies, the _Great_ and _Little Goulet_, through which\r\nthe waters escape from the valley. Even during the dry season, he who\r\nwould enter the gorge must take a foot-bath.\r\n\r\n“This state of things could not last; and in 1848 it was curious to see\r\nminers suspended on the sides of one of these lateral precipices, some\r\n450 feet above the torrent, and about an equal distance below the summit\r\nof the Chalk. There they began to excavate cavities or niches in the\r\nface of the rock, all placed on the same level, and successively\r\nenlarged. These were united together in such a manner as to form a road\r\npracticable for carriages; now through a gallery, now covered by a\r\ncorbelling, to look over which affords a succession of surprises to the\r\ntraveller.\r\n\r\n“This is not all,” adds M. Fournet: “he who traverses the high plateaux\r\nof the country finds at every step deep diggings in the soil, designated\r\npits or _scialets_, the oldest of which have their sides clothed with a\r\ncurious vegetation, in which the _Aucolin_ predominates; shelter is\r\nfound in these pits from the cutting winds which rage so furiously in\r\nthese elevated regions. Others form a kind of cavern, in which a\r\ntemperature obtains sufficient to freeze water even in the middle of\r\nsummer. These cavities form natural _glaciers_, which we again find upon\r\nsome of the table-lands of the Jura.\r\n\r\n“The cracks and crevasses of the limestone receive the waters produced\r\nby falling rain and melted snow; true to the laws of all fluid bodies,\r\nthey filter through the rocks until they reach the lower and impervious\r\nmarly beds, where they form sheets of water, which in course of time\r\nfind some outlet through which they discharge themselves. In this manner\r\nsubterranean galleries, sometimes of great extent, are formed, in which\r\nare assembled all the marvels which crumbling stalactites, stalagmites,\r\nplacid lakes, and headlong torrents can produce; finally, these waters,\r\nforcing their way through the external orifices, give rise to those fine\r\ncascades which, with the first gushing torrent, form an actual river.”\r\n\r\nThe _Albien_ of Alc. D’Orbigny, which Lyell considers to be the\r\nequivalent of the _Gault_, French authors treat as the “_glauconie_”\r\nformation, the name being drawn from a rock composed of chalk with\r\ngreenish grains of _glauconite_, or silicate of iron, which is often\r\nmixed with the limestone of this formation. The fossils by which it is\r\nidentified are very varied. Among its numerous types, we find\r\nCrustaceans belonging to the genera _Arcania_ and _Corystes_; many new\r\nMollusca, _Buccinum_, _Solen_, _Pterodonta_, _Voluta_, _Chama_, &c.;\r\ngreat numbers of molluscous Brachiopods, forming highly-developed\r\nsubmarine strata; some Echinoderms, unknown up to this period, and\r\nespecially a great number of Zoophytes; some Foraminifera, and many\r\nPolyzoa (Bryozoa). The glauconitic formation consists of two groups of\r\nstrata: the _Gault_ Clay and the _glauconitic_ chalk, or Upper Greensand\r\nand Chloritic Marl.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPPER CRETACEOUS PERIOD.\r\n\r\nDuring this phase of the terrestrial evolutions, the continents, to\r\njudge from the fossilised wood which we meet with in the rocks which now\r\nrepresent it, would be covered with a very rich vegetation, nearly\r\nidentical, indeed, with that which we have described in the preceding\r\nsub-period; according to Adolphe Brongniart, the “age of angiosperms”\r\nhad fairly set in; the Cretaceous flora displays, he considers, a\r\ntransitional character from the Secondary to the Tertiary vegetation;\r\nthat the line between the gymnosperms, or naked-seeded plants, and the\r\nangiosperms, having their seeds enclosed in seed-vessels, runs between\r\nthe Upper and Lower Cretaceous formations. “We can now affirm,” says\r\nLyell, “that these Aix-la-Chapelle plants, called Credneria, flourished\r\nbefore the rich reptilian fauna of the secondary rocks had ceased to\r\nexist. The Ichthyosaurus, Pterodactyle, and Mosasaurus were of coeval\r\ndate with the oak, the walnut, and the fig.”[80]\r\n\r\n  [80] Lyell’s “Elements of Geology,” p. 333.\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial fauna, consisting of some new Reptiles haunting the\r\nbanks of rivers, and Birds of the genus Snipe, have certainly only\r\nreached us in small numbers. The remains of the marine fauna are, on the\r\ncontrary, sufficiently numerous and well preserved to give us a great\r\nidea of its riches, and to enable us to assign to it a characteristic\r\nfacies.\r\n\r\nThe sea of the Upper Cretaceous period bristled with numerous submarine\r\nreefs, occupying a vast extent of its bed--reefs formed of Rudistes\r\n(Lamarck), and of immense quantities of various kinds of corals which\r\nare everywhere associated with them. The Polyps, in short, attain here\r\none of the principal epochs of their existence, and present a remarkable\r\ndevelopment of forms; the same occurs with the Polyzoa (Bryozoa) and\r\nAmorphozoa; while, on the contrary, the reign of the Cephalopods seems\r\nto end. Beautiful types of these ancient reefs have been revealed to us,\r\nand we discover that they have been formed under the influence of\r\nsubmarine currents, which accumulated masses of these animals at certain\r\npoints. Nothing is more curious than this assemblage of\r\n_Rudistes_--still standing erect, isolated or in groups--as may be seen,\r\nfor instance, at the summit of the mountains of the _Cornes_ in the\r\nCorbières, upon the banks of the pond of Berre in Provence, and in the\r\nenvirons of Martigues, at La Cadière, at Figuières, and particularly\r\nabove Beausset, near Toulon.\r\n\r\n“It seems,” says Alcide D’Orbigny, “as if the sea had retired in order\r\nto show us, still intact, the submarine fauna of this period, such as it\r\nwas when in life. There are here enormous groups of _Hippurites_ in\r\ntheir places, surrounded by Polyps, Echinoderms, and Molluscs, which\r\nlived in union in these animal colonies, analogous to those which still\r\nexist in the coral-reefs of the Antilles and Oceania. In order that\r\nthese groups should have been preserved intact, they must first have\r\nbeen covered suddenly by sediment, which, being removed by the action of\r\nthe atmosphere, reveals to us, in their most secret details, this Nature\r\nof the past.”\r\n\r\nIn the Jurassic period we have already met with these isles or reefs\r\nformed by the accumulation of Coral and other Zoophytes; they even\r\nconstituted, at that period, an entire formation called the _Coral-rag_.\r\nThe same phenomenon, reproduced in the Cretaceous seas, gave rise to\r\nsimilar calcareous formations. We need not repeat what we have said\r\nalready on this subject when describing the Jurassic period. The coral\r\nor madrepore isles of the Jurassic epoch and the reefs of Rudistes and\r\nHippurites of the Cretaceous period have the same origin, and the\r\n_atolls_ of Oceania are reproductions in our own day of precisely\r\nsimilar phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe invertebrate animals which characterise the Cretaceous age are among\r\n\r\n    CEPHALOPODA.\r\n\r\n    _Nautilus sublævigatus_ and _N.

We speak of the _Mosasaurus_,\r\nwhich was long known as the great animal of _Maestricht_, because its\r\nremains were found near that city in the most modern of the Cretaceous\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\nIn 1780 a discovery was made in the quarries of Saint Peter’s Rocks,\r\nnear Maestricht, of the head of a great Saurian, which may now be seen\r\nin the Museum of Natural History in Paris. This discovery baffled all\r\nthe science of the naturalists, at a period when the knowledge of these\r\nancient beings was still in its infancy. One saw in it the head of a\r\nCrocodile; another, that of a Whale; memoirs and monographs rained down,\r\nwithout throwing much light on the subject. It required all the efforts\r\nof Adrian Camper, joined to those of the immortal Cuvier, to assign its\r\ntrue zoological place to the Maestricht animal. The controversy over\r\nthis fine fossil engaged the attention of the learned for the remainder\r\nof the last century and far into the present.\r\n\r\nMaestricht is a city of the Netherlands, built on the banks of the\r\nMeuse. At the gates of this city, in the hills which skirt the left or\r\nwestern bank of the river, there rises a solid mass of cretaceous\r\nformation known as Saint Peter’s Rocks. In composition these beds\r\ncorrespond with the Meudon chalk beds, and they contain similar fossils.\r\nThe quarries are about 100 feet deep, consisting in the upper part of\r\ntwenty feet abounding in corals and Polyzoa, succeeded by fifty feet of\r\nsoft yellowish limestone, furnishing a fine building stone, which has\r\nbeen quarried from time immemorial, and extends up to the environs of\r\nLiège; this is succeeded by a few inches of greenish soil with\r\nEncrinites, and then by a very white chalk with layers of flints. The\r\nquarry is filled with marine fossils, often of great size.\r\n\r\nThese fossil remains, naturally enough, attracted the attention of the\r\ncurious, and led many to visit the quarries; but of all the discoveries\r\nwhich attracted attention the greatest interest attached to the gigantic\r\nanimal under consideration. Among those interested by the discovery of\r\nthese strange vestiges was an officer of the garrison of Maestricht,\r\nnamed Drouin. He purchased the bones of the workmen as the pick\r\ndisengaged them from the rock, and concluded by forming a collection in\r\nMaestricht, which was spoken of with admiration. In 1766, the trustees\r\nof the British Museum, hearing of this curiosity, purchased it, and had\r\nit removed to London. Incited by the example of Drouin, Hoffmann, the\r\nsurgeon of the garrison, set about forming a similar collection, and his\r\ncollection soon exceeded that of Drouin’s Museum in riches. It was in\r\n1780 that he purchased of the quarrymen the magnificent fossil head,\r\nexceeding six feet in length, which has since so exercised the sagacity\r\nof naturalists.\r\n\r\nHoffman did not long enjoy the fruits of his precious prize, however;\r\nthe chapter of the church of Maestricht claimed, with more or less\r\nfoundation, certain rights of property; and in spite of all protest, the\r\nhead of the _Crocodile of Maestricht_, as it was already called, passed\r\ninto the hands of the Dean of the Chapter, named Goddin, who enjoyed\r\nthe possession of his antediluvian trophy until an unforeseen incident\r\nchanged the aspect of things. This incident was nothing less than the\r\nbombardment and surrender of Maestricht to the Army of the North under\r\nKleber, in 1794.\r\n\r\nThe Army of the North did not enter upon a campaign to obtain the crania\r\nof Crocodiles, but it had on its staff a savant who was devoted to such\r\npacific conquests. Faujas de Saint-Fond, who was the predecessor of\r\nCordier in the Zoological Chair of the Jardin des Plantes, was attached\r\nto the Army of the North as Scientific Commissioner; and it is suspected\r\nthat, in soliciting this mission, our naturalist had in his eye the\r\nalready famous head of the Crocodile of the Meuse. However that may be,\r\nMaestricht fell into the hands of the French, and Faujas eagerly claimed\r\nthe famous fossil for the French nation, which was packed with the care\r\ndue to a relic numbering so many thousands of ages, and dispatched to\r\nthe Museum of Natural History in Paris. On its arrival, Faujas undertook\r\na labour which, as he thought, was to cover him with glory. He commenced\r\nthe publication of a work entitled “The Mountain of Saint Peter of\r\nMaestricht,” describing all the fossil objects found in the Dutch quarry\r\nthere, especially the _Great Animal_ of Maestricht. He endeavoured to\r\nprove that this animal was a Crocodile.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the glory of Faujas, a Dutch savant had devoted\r\nhimself to the same study. Adrian Camper was the son of a great\r\nanatomist of Leyden, Pierre Camper, who had purchased of the heirs of\r\nthe surgeon Hoffman some parts of the skeleton of the animal found in\r\nthe quarry of Saint Peter. He had even published in the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_ of London, as early as 1786, a memoir, in which the animal\r\nis classed as a Whale. At the death of his father, Adrian Camper\r\nre-examined the skeleton, and in a work which Cuvier quotes with\r\nadmiration, he fixed the ideas which were until then floating about. He\r\nproved that the bones belonged neither to a Fish, nor a Whale, nor to a\r\nCrocodile, but rather to a particular genus of Saurian Reptiles, or\r\nmarine lizards, closely resembling in many important structural\r\ncharacters, existing Monitors and Iguanas, and peculiar to rocks of the\r\nCretaceous period, both in Europe and America. Long before Faujas had\r\nfinished the publication of his work on _La Montagne de Saint-Pierre_\r\nthat of Adrian Camper had appeared, and totally changed the ideas of the\r\nworld on this subject. It did not, however, hinder Faujas from\r\ncontinuing to call his animal the Crocodile of Maestricht. He even\r\nannounced, some time after, that Adrian Camper was also of his opinion.\r\n“Nevertheless,” says Cuvier, “it is as far from the Crocodile as it is\r\nfrom the Iguana; and these two animals differ as much from each other\r\nin their teeth, bones, and viscera, as the ape differs from the cat, or\r\nthe elephant from the horse.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 145.\r\n\r\n_a_, skull of Monitor Niloticus; _b_, under-jaw of same.]\r\n\r\nThe masterly memoir of Cuvier, while confirming all the views of Camper,\r\nhas restored the individuality of this surprising being, which has since\r\nreceived the name of Mosasaurus, that is to say, Saurian or Lizard of\r\nthe Meuse. It appears, from the researches of Camper and Cuvier, that\r\nthis reptile of the ancient world formed an intermediate genus between\r\nthe group of the Lacertilia, which comprehends the Monitors (represented\r\nin Fig. 145), and the ordinary Lizards; and the Lacertilia, whose\r\npalates are armed with teeth, a group which embraces the _Iguana_ and\r\nthe _Anolis_. In respect to the Crocodiles, the Mosasaurus resembles\r\nthem in so far as they all belong to the same class of Reptiles.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a lizard, adapted for living and moving with rapidity at the\r\nbottom of the water, is not readily conceived; but a careful study of\r\nthe skeleton of the Mosasaurus reveals to us the secret of this\r\nanatomical mechanism. The vertebræ of the animal are concave in front\r\nand convex behind; they are attached by means of orbicular or arched\r\narticulations, which permitted it to execute easily movements of flexion\r\nin any direction. From the middle of the back to the extremity of the\r\ntail these vertebræ are deficient in the articular processes which\r\nsupport and strengthen the trunk of terrestrial vertebrated animals:\r\nthey resemble in this respect the vertebræ of the Dolphins; an\r\norganisation necessary to render swimming easy. The tail, compressed\r\nlaterally at the same time that it was thick in a vertical direction,\r\nconstituted a straight rudder, short, solid, and of great power. An\r\narched bone was firmly attached to the body of each caudal vertebra in\r\nthe same manner as in Fishes, for the purpose of giving increased power\r\nto the tail; finally, the extremities of the animal could scarcely be\r\ncalled feet, but rather paddles, like those of the Ichthyosaurus, the\r\nPlesiosaurus, and the Whale. We see in Fig. 146 that the jaws are armed\r\nwith numerous teeth, fixed in their sockets by an osseous base, both\r\nlarge and solid. Moreover, an altogether peculiar dental system occupies\r\nthe vault of the palate, as in the case of certain Serpents and Fishes,\r\nwhere the teeth are directed backwards, like the barb of a hook, thus\r\nopposing themselves to the escape of prey. Such a disposition of the\r\nteeth sufficiently proves the destructive character of this Saurian.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 146.--Head of Mosasaurus Camperi.]\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of this aquatic lizard, estimated at twenty-four feet,\r\nare calculated to excite surprise. But, as we have already seen, the\r\nIchthyosauri and Teleosauri were of great dimensions, as were also the\r\nIguanodon and Megalosaurus, which were ten times the size of living\r\nIguanas. In all these colossal forms we can only see a difference of\r\ndimensions, the aggrandisement of a type; the laws which affected the\r\norganisation of all these beings remain unchanged, they were not errors\r\nof Nature--_monstrosities_, as we are sometimes tempted to call\r\nthem--but simply types, uniform in their structure, and adapted by their\r\ndimensions to the physical conditions with which God had surrounded\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXII.--Ideal Landscape of the Cretaceous Period.]\r\n\r\nIn PLATE XXII. is represented an ideal view of the earth during the\r\n_Upper Cretaceous_ period. In the sea swims the Mosasaurus; Molluscs,\r\nZoophytes, and other animals peculiar to the period are seen on the\r\nshore. The vegetation seems to approach that of our days; it consists of\r\nFerns and Cycadeæ (Pterophyllums), mingled with Palms, Willows, and some\r\ndicotyledons of species analogous to those of our present epoch. Algæ,\r\nthen very abundant, composed the vegetation of the sea-shore.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the terrestrial flora of the Upper Cretaceous period\r\nwas nearly identical with that of the Lower. The marine flora of these\r\ntwo epochs included some Algæ, Confervæ, and Naïadæ, among which may be\r\nnoted the following species: _Confervites fasciculatus_, _Chondrites\r\nMantelli_, _Sargassites Hynghianus_. Among the Naïadæ, _Zosterites\r\nOrbigniana_, _Z. lineata_, and several others.\r\n\r\nThe _Confervæ_ are fossils which may be referred, but with some doubt,\r\nto the filamentous Algæ, which comprehend the great group of the\r\nConfervæ. These plants were formed of simple or branching filaments,\r\ndiversely crossing each other; or subdivided, and presenting traces of\r\ntransverse partitions.\r\n\r\nThe _Chondrites_ are, perhaps, fossil Algæ, with thick, smooth branching\r\nfronds, pinnatifid, or divided into pairs, with smooth cylindrical\r\ndivisions, and resembling _Chondrus_, _Dumontia_, and _Halymenia_ among\r\nliving genera.\r\n\r\nThe _Sargassites_, finally, have been vaguely referred to the genus\r\n_Sargassum_, so abundant in tropical seas. These Algæ are distinguished\r\nby a filiform, branched, or ramose stem, bearing foliaceous appendages,\r\nregular, often petiolate, and altogether like leaves, and globular\r\nvesicles, supported by a small stalk.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe rocks which actually represent the _Upper Cretaceous period_ divide\r\nthemselves naturally into six series; but British and French geologists\r\nmake some distinction: the former dividing them into 1, _Maestricht_ and\r\n_Faxoe_ beds, said not to occur in England; 2, _White Chalk_, with\r\n_flints_; 3, _White Chalk_, without _flint_s; 4, _Chalk Marl_; 5, _Upper\r\nGreensand_; and 6, _Gault_. The latter four are divided by foreign\r\ngeologists into 1, _Turonian_; 2, _Senonian_; 3, _Danian_.\r\n\r\nThe _Gault_ is the lowest member of the Upper Cretaceous group. It\r\nconsists of a bluish-black clay mixed with greensand, which underlies\r\nthe Upper Greensand. Near Cambridge, where the Gault is about 200 feet\r\nthick, a layer of shells, bones, and nodules, called the “Coprolite\r\nBed,” from nine inches to a foot thick, represents the Upper Greensand,\r\nand rests on the top of the Gault Clay. These nodules and fossils are\r\nextensively worked on account of the phosphatic matter they contain, and\r\nwhen ground and converted into superphosphate of lime they furnish a\r\nvery valuable agricultural manure. The Gault attains a thickness of\r\nabout 100 feet on the south-east coast of England. It extends into\r\nDevonshire, Mr. Sharpe considering the Black Down beds of that country\r\nas its equivalents. It shows itself in the Departments of the\r\nPas-de-Calais, the Ardennes, the Meuse, the Aube, the Yonne, the Ain,\r\nthe Calvados, and the Seine-Inférieure. It presents very many distinct\r\nmineral forms, among which two predominate: green sandstone and blackish\r\nor grey clays. It is important to know this formation, for it is at this\r\nlevel that the Artesian waters flow in the wells of Passy and Grenelle,\r\nnear Paris.\r\n\r\nThe _glaucous_ chalk, or Upper Greensand, which is represented typically\r\nin the departments of the Sarthe, of the Charente-Inférieure, of the\r\nYonne and the Var, is composed of quartzose sand, clay, sandstone, and\r\nlimestone. In this formation, at the mouth of the Charente, we find a\r\nremarkable bed, which has been described as a submarine forest. It\r\nconsists of large trees with their branches imbedded horizontally in\r\nvegetable matter, containing kidney-shaped nodules of amber, or\r\nfossilised resin.\r\n\r\nThe _Turonian_ beds are so named because the province of Touraine,\r\nbetween Saumur and Montrichard, possesses the best-developed type of\r\nthis strata. The mineralogical composition of the beds is a fine and\r\ngrey marly chalk, as at Vitry-le-François; of a pure white chalk, with a\r\nvery fine grain, slightly argillaceous, and poor in fossils, in the\r\nDepartments of the Yonne, the Aube, and the Seine-Inférieure; granular\r\ntufaceous chalk, white or yellowish, mixed with spangles of mica, and\r\ncontaining Ammonites, in Touraine and a part of the Department of the\r\nSarthe; white, grey, yellow, or bluish limestone, inclosing Hippurites\r\nand Radiolites. In England the Lower Chalk passes also into Chalk Marl,\r\nwith Ammonites, and then into beds known as the Upper Greensand,\r\ncontaining green particles of glauconite, mixed, in Hampshire and\r\nSurrey, with much calcareous matter. In the Isle of Wight this formation\r\nattains a thickness of 100 feet. The _Senonian_ beds take their name\r\nfrom the ancient _Senones_. The city of Sens is in the centre of the\r\nbest-characterised portion of this formation; Epernay, Meudon, Sens,\r\nVendôme, Royau, Cognac, Saintes, are the typical regions of the\r\nformation in France. In the Paris basin, inclusive of the Tours beds, it\r\nattains a thickness of upwards of 1,500 feet, as was proved by the\r\nsamples brought up, during the sinking of the Artesian well, at\r\nGrenelle, by the borings.\r\n\r\nIn its geographical distribution the Chalk has an immense range; fine\r\nChalk of nearly similar aspect and composition being met with in all\r\ndirections over hundreds of miles, alternating in its lower beds with\r\nlayers of flints. In England the higher beds usually consist of a\r\npure-white calcareous mass, generally too soft for building-stone, but\r\nsometimes passing into a solid rock.\r\n\r\nThe _Danian_ beds, which occupy the summit of the scale in the\r\nCretaceous formation, are finely developed at Maestricht, on the Meuse;\r\nand in the Island of Zeeland, belonging to Denmark; where they are\r\nrepresented by a slightly yellowish, compact limestone, quarried for the\r\nconstruction of the city of Faxoe. It is slightly represented in the\r\nParis basin at Meudon, and Laversines, in the Department of the Oise, by\r\na white and often rubbly limestone known as _pisolitic limestone_. In\r\nthis formation _Ammonites Danicus_ is found. The yellowish sandy\r\nlimestone of Maestricht is referred to the _Danian_ type. Besides\r\nMolluscs, Polyps, and Polyzoa (Bryozoa), this limestone contains remains\r\nof Fishes, Turtles, and Crocodiles. But what has rendered this rock so\r\ncelebrated was that it contained the remains of the _great animal of\r\nMæstricht_, the Mæsasaurus.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the geological period, whose natural physiognomy we have\r\nthus traced, Europe was still far from displaying the configuration\r\nwhich it now presents. A map of the period would represent the great\r\nbasin of Paris (with the exception of a zone of Chalk), the whole of\r\nSwitzerland, the greater part of Spain and Italy, the whole of Belgium,\r\nHolland, Prussia, Hungary, Wallachia, and Northern Russia, as one vast\r\nsheet of water. A band of Jurassic rocks still connected France and\r\nEngland at Cherbourg--which disappeared at a later period, and caused\r\nthe separation of the British Islands from what is now France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 147.--Exogym conica. Upper Greensand and Gault, from\r\nBlackdown Hill.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTERTIARY PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nA new organic creation makes its appearance in the Tertiary period;\r\nnearly all the animal life is changed, and what is most remarkable in\r\nthis new development is the appearance, in larger numbers, of the great\r\nclass of Mammifera.\r\n\r\nDuring the Primary period, Crustaceans and Fishes predominated in the\r\nanimal kingdom; in the Secondary period the earth was assigned to\r\nReptiles; but during the Tertiary period the Mammals were kings of the\r\nearth; nor do these animals appear in small number, or at distant\r\nintervals of time; great numbers of these beings appear to have lived on\r\nthe earth, and at the same moment; many of them being, so to say,\r\nunknown and undescribed.\r\n\r\nIf we except the Marsupials, the first created Mammals would appear to\r\nhave been the Pachyderms, to which the Elephant belongs. This order of\r\nanimals long held the first rank; it was almost the only representative\r\nof the Mammal during the first of the three periods which constitute the\r\nTertiary epoch. In the second and third periods Mammals appear of\r\nspecies which have now become extinct, and which were alike curious from\r\ntheir enormous proportions, and from the singularity of their structure.\r\nOf the species which appeared during the latter part of the epoch, the\r\ngreater number still exist. Among the new Reptiles, some Salamanders, as\r\nlarge as Crocodiles, and not very distinct from existing forms, are\r\nadded to the animal creation during the three periods of the Tertiary\r\nepoch. Chelonians were abundant within the British area during the older\r\nepoch. During the same epoch Birds are present, but in much fewer\r\nnumbers than the Mammalia; here songsters, there birds of prey, in other\r\ncases domestic--or, rather, some appear to wait the yoke and\r\ndomestication from man, the future supreme lord of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe seas were inhabited by a considerable number of beings of all\r\nclasses, and nearly as varied as those now living; but we no longer find\r\nin the Tertiary seas those Ammonites, Belemnites, and Hippurites which\r\npeopled the seas and multiplied with such astonishing profusion during\r\nthe Secondary period. Henceforth the testaceous Mollusca approximate in\r\ntheir forms to those of the present time. The older and newer Tertiary\r\nSeries contain few peculiar genera. But genera now found in warmer\r\nclimates were greatly developed within the British area during the\r\nearlier Tertiary times, and _species_ of cold climates mark the close of\r\nthe later Tertiaries.\r\n\r\nWhat occurs to us, however, as most remarkable in the Tertiary epoch is\r\nthe prodigious increase of animal life; it seems as if it had then\r\nattained its fullest extension. Swarms of testaceous Mollusca of\r\nmicroscopic proportions--Foraminifera and Nummulites--must have\r\ninhabited the seas, crowding together in ranks so serried that the\r\nagglomerated remains of their shells form, in some places, beds hundreds\r\nof feet thick. It is the most extraordinary display which has appeared\r\nin the whole range of creation.\r\n\r\nVegetation during the Tertiary period presents well-defined\r\ncharacteristics. The Tertiary flora approaches, and is sometimes nearly\r\nidentical with, that of our days. The class of dicotyledons shows itself\r\nthere in its fullest development; it is the epoch of flowers. The\r\nsurface of the earth is embellished by the variegated colours of the\r\nflowers and fruits which succeed them. The white spikes of the Gramineæ\r\ndisplay themselves upon the verdant meadows without limit; they seem\r\nprovocative of the increase of Insects, which now singularly multiply.\r\nIn the woods crowded with flowering trees, with rounded tops, like our\r\noak and birch, Birds become more numerous. The atmosphere, purified and\r\ndisembarrassed of the veil of vapour which has hitherto pervaded it, now\r\npermits animals with such delicate pulmonary organs to live and multiply\r\ntheir race.\r\n\r\nDuring the Tertiary period the influence of the central heat may have\r\nceased to make itself felt, in consequence of the increased thickness of\r\nthe terrestrial crust. By the influence of the solar heat, climates\r\nwould be developed in the various latitudes; the temperature of the\r\nearth would still be nearly that of our present tropics, and at this\r\nepoch, also, cold would begin to make itself felt at the poles.\r\n\r\nAbundant rains would, however, continue to pour upon the earth enormous\r\nquantities of water, which would give rise to important rivers; new\r\nlacustrine deposits of fresh water were formed in great numbers; and\r\nrivers, by means of their alluvial deposits, began to form new land. It\r\nis, in short, during the Tertiary epoch that we trace an alternate\r\nsuccession of beds containing organic beings of marine origin, with\r\nothers peculiar to fresh water. It is at the end of this period that\r\ncontinents and seas take their respective places as we now see them,\r\nand that the surface of the earth received its present form.\r\n\r\nThe Tertiary epoch, or series, embraces three very distinct periods, to\r\nwhich the names of _Eocene_, _Miocene_, and _Pliocene_ have been given\r\nby Sir Charles Lyell. The etymology of these names is derived--Eocene,\r\nfrom the Greek ηως, _dawn_, and καινος, _recent_; Miocene, from μειον,\r\n_less_, καινος, _recent_; and Pliocene, from πλειον, _more_, καινος,\r\n_recent_; by which it is simply meant to express, that each of these\r\nperiods contains a minor or greater proportion of recent species (of\r\nTestacea), or is more or less remote from the dawn of life and from the\r\npresent time;[81] the expressions are in one sense forced and incorrect,\r\nbut usage has consecrated them, and they have obtained universal\r\ncurrency in geological language, from their convenience and utility.\r\n\r\n  [81] Lyell’s “Elements of Geology,” p. 187.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 148.--Trigonia margaritacea. (Living form.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EOCENE PERIOD.\r\n\r\nDuring this period _terra firma_ has vastly gained upon the domain of\r\nthe sea; furrowed with streams and rivers, and here and there with great\r\nlakes and ponds, the landscape of this period presented the same curious\r\nmixture which we have noted in the preceding age, that is to say, a\r\ncombination of the vegetation of the primitive ages with one analogous\r\nto that of our own times. Alongside the birch, the walnut, the oak, the\r\nelm, and the alder, rise lofty palm-trees, of species now extinct, such\r\nas _Flabellaria_ and _Palmacites_; with many evergreen trees (Conifers),\r\nfor the most part belonging to genera still existing, as the _firs_, the\r\n_pines_, the _yews_, the _cypresses_, the _junipers_, and the _thuyas_\r\nor tree of life.\r\n\r\nThe _Cupanioides_, among the Sapindaceæ; the _Cucumites_, among the\r\nCucurbitaceæ (species analogous to our bryony), climb the trunks of\r\ngreat trees, and hang in festoons of aerial garlands from their\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nThe Ferns were still represented by the genera _Pecopteris_, by the\r\n_Tæniopteris_, _Asplenium_, _Polypodium_. Of the mosses, some\r\n_Hepaticas_ formed a humble but elegant and lively vegetation alongside\r\nthe terrestrial and frequently ligneous plants which we have noted.\r\n_Equiseta_ and _Charæ_ would still grow in marshy places and on the\r\nborders of rivers and ponds.\r\n\r\nIt is not without some surprise that we observe here certain plants of\r\nour own epoch, which seem to have had the privilege of ornamenting the\r\ngreater watercourses. Among these we may mention the Water Caltrop,\r\n_Trapa natans_, whose fine rosettes of green and dentated leaves float\r\nso gracefully in ornamental ponds, supported by their spindle-shaped\r\npetioles, its fruit a hard coriaceous nut, with four horny spines, known\r\nin France as _water-chestnuts_, which enclose a farinaceous grain not\r\nunpleasant to the taste; the pond-weed, _Potamogeton_, whose leaves form\r\nthick tufts of green, affording food and shelter to the fishes;\r\n_Nympheaceæ_, which spread beside their large round and hollow leaves,\r\nso admirably adapted for floating on the water, now the deep-yellow\r\nflowers of the _Nenuphar_ now the pure white flowers of the _Nymphæa_.\r\nListen to Lecoq, as he describes the vegetation of the period:--“The\r\nLower Tertiary period,” he says, “constantly reminds us of the tropical\r\nlandscapes of the present epoch, in localities where water and heat\r\ntogether impress on vegetation a power and majesty unknown in our\r\nclimates. The Algæ, which have already been observed in the marine\r\nwaters at the close of the Cretaceous period, represented themselves\r\nunder still more varied forms, in the earlier Tertiary deposits, when\r\nthey have been formed in the sea. Hepaticas and Mosses grew in the more\r\nhumid places; many pretty Ferns, as _Pecopteris_, _Tæniopteris_, and the\r\n_Equisetum stellare_ (Pomel) vegetated in cool and humid places. The\r\nfresh waters are crowded with _Naiades_, _Chara_, _Potamogeton_,\r\n_Caulinites_, with _Zosterites_, and with _Halochloris_. Their leaves,\r\nfloating or submerged, like those of our aquatic plants, concealed\r\nlegions of Molluscs whose remains have also reached us.\r\n\r\n“Great numbers of Conifers lived during this period. M. Brongniart\r\nenumerates forty-one different species, which, for the most part, remind\r\nus of living forms with which we are familiar--of Pines, Cypresses,\r\nThuyas, Junipers, Firs, Yews, and Ephedra. Palms mingled with these\r\ngroups of evergreen trees; the _Flabellaria Parisiensis_ of Brongniart,\r\n_F. raphifolia_ of Sternberg, _F. maxima_ of Unger; and some\r\n_Palmacites_, raised their widely-spreading crowns near the magnificent\r\n_Hightea_; Malvaceæ, or _Mallows_, doubtless arborescent, as many among\r\nthem, natives of very hot climates, are in our days.\r\n\r\n“Creeping plants, such as the _Cucumites variabilis_ (Brongn.), and the\r\nnumerous species of _Cupanioïdes_--the one belonging to the\r\nCucurbitaceæ, and the other to the Sapindaceæ--twined their slender\r\nstems round the trunks, doubtless ligneous, of various Leguminaceæ.\r\n\r\n“The family of Betulaceæ of the order Cupuliferæ show the form, then\r\nnew, of _Quercus_, the Oak; the Juglandeæ, and Ulmaceæ mingle with the\r\nProteaceæ, now limited to the southern hemisphere. _Dermatophyllites_,\r\npreserved in amber, seem to have belonged to the family of the Ericineæ,\r\nand _Tropa Arcturæ_ of Unger, of the group Œnothereæ, floated on the\r\nshallow waters in which grew the _Chara_ and the _Potamogeton_.\r\n\r\n“This numerous flora comprises more than 200 known species, of which 143\r\nbelonged to the Dicotyledons, thirty-three to the Monocotyledons, and\r\nthirty-three to the Cryptogams.\r\n\r\n“Trees predominate here as in the preceding period, but the great\r\nnumbers of aquatic plants of the period are quite in accordance with the\r\ngeological facts, which show that the continents and islands were\r\nintersected by extensive lakes and inland seas, while vast marine bays\r\nand arms of the sea penetrated deeply into the land.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 149.--Branch of Eucalyptus restored.]\r\n\r\nIt is moreover a peculiarity of this period that the whole of Europe\r\ncomprehended a great number of those plants which are now confined to\r\nAustralasia, and which give so strange an aspect to that country, which\r\nseems, in its vegetation, as in its animals, to have preserved in its\r\nwarm latitudes the last vestiges of the organic creations peculiar to\r\nthe primitive world. As a type of dicotyledonous trees of the epoch, we\r\npresent here a restored branch of _Eucalyptus_ (Fig. 149), with its\r\nflowers. All the family of the Proteaceæ, which comprehends the\r\n_Banksia_, the _Hakea_, the _Gerilea protea_, existed in Europe during\r\nthe Tertiary period. The family of Mimosas, comprising the _Acacia_ and\r\n_Inga_, which in our age are only natives of the southern hemisphere,\r\nabounded in Europe during the same geological period. A branch of\r\n_Banksia_, with its fructification, taken from impressions discovered in\r\nrocks of the period, is represented in Fig. 150--it is different from\r\nany species of Banksia living in our days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 150.--Fruit-branch of Banksia restored.]\r\n\r\nMammals, Birds, Reptiles, Fishes, Insects, and Molluscs, form the\r\nterrestrial fauna of the Eocene period. In the waters of the lakes,\r\nwhose surfaces are deeply ploughed by the passage of large Pelicans,\r\nlived Molluscs of varied forms, as _Physa_, _Limnæa_, _Planorbis_; and\r\nTurtles swam about, as _Trionyx_ and the _Emides_. Snipes made their\r\nretreat among the reeds which grew on the shore; sea-gulls skimmed the\r\nsurface of the waters or ran upon the sands; owls hid themselves in the\r\ncavernous trunks of old trees; gigantic buzzards hovered in the air,\r\nwatching for their prey; while heavy crocodiles slowly dragged their\r\nunwieldy bodies through the high marshy grasses. All these terrestrial\r\nanimals have been discovered in England or in France, alongside the\r\noverthrown trunks of palm-trees. The temperature of these countries was\r\nthen much higher than it is now. The Mammals which lived under the\r\nlatitudes of Paris and London are only found now in the warmest\r\ncountries of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe Pachyderms (from the Greek παχυς, _thick_, δερμα, _skin_) seem to\r\nhave been amongst the earliest Mammals which appeared in the Eocene\r\nperiod, and they held the first rank from their importance in number of\r\nspecies as well as in size. Let us pause an instant over these\r\nPachyderms. Their predominance over other fossil Mammals, which exceed\r\nconsiderably the number now living, is a fact much insisted on by\r\nCuvier. Among them were a great number of intermediate forms, which we\r\nseek for in vain in existing genera. In fact, the Pachyderms are\r\nseparated, in our days, by intervals of greater extent than we find in\r\nany other mammalian genera; and it is very curious to discover among the\r\nanimals of the ancient world the broken link which connects the chain of\r\nthese beings, which have for their great tomb the plaster-quarries of\r\nParis, Montmartre and Pantin being their latest refuge.\r\n\r\nEach block taken from those quarries encloses some fragment of a bone of\r\nthese Mammals; and how many millions of these bones had been destroyed\r\nbefore attention was directed to the subject! The _Palæotherium_ and the\r\n_Anoplotherium_ were the first of these animals which Cuvier restored;\r\nand subsequent discoveries of other fragments of the same animals have\r\nonly served to confirm what the genius of the great naturalist divined.\r\nHis studies in the quarries of Montmartre gave the signal, as they\r\nbecame the model, for similar researches and restorations of the animals\r\nof the ancient world, all over Europe--researches which, in our age,\r\nhave drawn geology from the state of infancy in which it languished, in\r\nspite of the magnificent and persevering labours of Steno, Werner,\r\nHutton, and Saussure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 151.--Palæotherium magnum restored.]\r\n\r\nThe _Palæotherium_, _Anoplotherium_, and _Xiphodon_ were herbivorous\r\nanimals, which must have lived in great herds. They appear to have been\r\nintermediate, according to their organisation, between the Rhinoceros,\r\nthe Horse, and the Tapir. There seem to have existed many species of\r\nthem, of very different sizes. After the labours of Cuvier, nothing is\r\neasier than to represent the _Palæotherium_ as it lived: the nose\r\nterminating in a muscular fleshy trunk, or rather snout, somewhat like\r\nthat of the Tapir; the eye small, and displaying little intelligence;\r\nthe head enormously large; the body squat, thick, and short; the legs\r\nshort and very stout; the feet supported by three toes, enclosed in a\r\nhoof; the size, that of a large horse. Such was the great Palæotherium,\r\npeaceful flocks of which must have inhabited the valleys of the plateau\r\nwhich surrounds the ancient basin of Paris; in the lacustrine formations\r\nof Orleans and Argenton; in the Tertiary formations of Issil and\r\nPuy-en-Velay, in the department of the Gironde; in the Tertiary\r\nformations near Rome; and in the beds of limestone[82] at the quarries\r\nof Binsted, in the Isle of Wight. Fig. 151 represents the great\r\nPalæotherium, after the design, in outline, given by Cuvier in his work\r\non _fossil bones_.\r\n\r\n  [82] This limestone belongs to the Bembridge beds, and forms part of\r\n       the Fluvio-marine series. See “Survey Memoir on the Geology of\r\n       the Isle of Wight,” by H. W. Bristow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 152.--Skull of Palæotherium magnum.]\r\n\r\nThe discovery and re-arrangement of these and other forms, now swept\r\nfrom the face of the globe, are the noblest triumphs of the great French\r\nzoologist, who gathered them, as we have seen, from heaps of confused\r\nfragments, huddled together pell-mell, comprising the bones of a great\r\nmany species of animals of a former age of the world, all unknown within\r\nthe historic period. The generic characters of Palæotherium give them\r\nforty-four teeth, namely, twelve _molars_, two _canines_, and\r\ntwenty-eight others, three toes, a short proboscis, for the attachment\r\nof which the bones of the nose were shortened, as represented in Fig.\r\n153, leaving a deep notch below them. The molar teeth bear considerable\r\nresemblance to those of the Rhinoceros. In the structure of that part of\r\nthe skull intended to support the short proboscis, and in the feet, the\r\nanimal seems to have resembled the Tapir.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 153.--Skeletons of the Palæotherium magnum (_a_) and\r\nminimum (_b_) restored.]\r\n\r\nThe geological place of the extinct Palæotherium seems to have been in\r\nthe first great fresh-water formation of the Eocene period, where it is\r\nchiefly found with its allies, of which several species have been found\r\nand identified by Cuvier. Dr. Buckland is not singular in thinking that\r\nthey lived and died on the margins of lakes and rivers, as the\r\nRhinoceros and Tapir do now. He is also of opinion that some retired\r\ninto the water to die, and that the dead carcases of others may have\r\nbeen drifted into the deeper parts in seasons of flood.\r\n\r\nThe _Palæotherium_ varied greatly in size, some species being as large\r\nas the Rhinoceros, while others ranged between the size of the Horse and\r\nthat of a Hog or a Roe. The smaller Palæotherium resembled the Tapir.\r\nLess in size than a Goat, with slim and light legs, it must have been\r\nvery common in the north of France, where it would browse on the grass\r\nof the wild prairies. Another species, the _P. minimum_, scarcely\r\nexceeded the Hare in size, and it probably had all the lightness and\r\nagility of that animal. It lived among the bushy thickets of the\r\nenvirons of Paris, in Auvergne, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAll these animals lived upon seeds and fruits, on the green twigs, or\r\nsubterranean stems, and the succulent roots of the plants of the period.\r\nThey generally frequented the neighbourhood of fresh water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 154.--Anoplotherium commune. One-twentieth natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nThe _Anoplotherium_ (from ανοπλος, _defenceless_, θηριον, _animal_), had\r\nthe posterior molar teeth analogous to those of the Rhinoceros, the feet\r\nterminating in two great toes, forming an equally divided hoof, like\r\nthat of the Ox and other Ruminants, and the tarsus of the toes nearly\r\nlike those of the Camel. It was about the size of the Ass; its head was\r\nlight; but what would distinguish it most must have been an enormous\r\ntail of at least three feet in length, and very thick at its junction\r\nwith the body. This tail evidently served it as a rudder and propeller\r\nwhen swimming in the lakes or rivers, which it frequented, not to seize\r\nfish (for it was strictly herbivorous), but in search of roots and stems\r\nof succulent aquatic plants. “Judging from its habits of swimming and\r\ndiving,” says Cuvier, “the Anoplotherium would have the hair smooth,\r\nlike the otter; perhaps its skin was even half naked. It is not likely\r\neither that it had long ears, which would be inconvenient in its aquatic\r\nkind of life; and I am inclined to think that, in this respect, it\r\nresembled the Hippopotamus and other quadrupeds which frequent the water\r\nmuch.” To this description Cuvier had nothing more to add. His memoir\r\nupon the _pachydermatous fossils_ of Montmartre is accompanied by a\r\ndesign in outline of _Anoplotherium commune_, which has been closely\r\nfollowed in Fig. 154.\r\n\r\nThere were species of Anoplotherium of very small size. _A. leporinum_\r\n(or the Hare-Anoplotherium), whose feet are evidently adapted for speed;\r\n_A. minimum_ and _A. obliquum_ were of still smaller dimensions; the\r\nlast, especially, scarcely exceeded the size of a rat. Like the\r\nWater-rats, this species inhabited the banks of brooks and small rivers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 155.--Xiphodon gracile.]\r\n\r\nThe _Xiphodon_ was about three feet in height at the withers, and\r\ngenerally about the size of the Chamois, but lighter in form, and with a\r\nsmaller head. In proportion as the appearance of the _Anoplotherium\r\ncommune_ was heavy and sluggish, so was that of _Xiphodon gracile_\r\ngraceful and active; light and agile as the Gazelle or the Goat, it\r\nwould rapidly run round the marshes and ponds, depasturing on the\r\naromatic herbs of the dry lands, or browsing on the sprouts of the young\r\nshrubs. “Its course,” says Cuvier, in the memoir already quoted, “was\r\nnot embarrassed by a long tail; but, like all active herbivorous\r\nanimals, it was probably timid, and with large and very mobile ears,\r\nlike those of the stag, announcing the slightest approach of danger.\r\nNeither is there any doubt that its body was covered with short smooth\r\nhair; and consequently we only require to know its colour in order to\r\npaint it as it formerly existed in this country, where it has been dug\r\nup after so many ages.” Fig. 155 is a reproduction from the design in\r\noutline with which Cuvier accompanied the description of this animal,\r\nwhich he classes with the Anoplotherium, and which has received in our\r\ndays the name of _Xiphodon gracile_.\r\n\r\nThe gypsum-quarries of the environs of Paris include, moreover, the\r\nremains of other Pachyderms: the _Chæropotamus_, or River-hog (from\r\nχοιρος ποταμος), which has some analogy with the living Pecari, though\r\nmuch larger; the _Adapis_, which reminds us, in its form, of the\r\nHedgehog, of which, however, it was three times the size. It seems to\r\nhave been a link between the Pachyderms and the Insectivorous Carnivora.\r\nThe _Lophiodon_, the size of which varied with the species, from that of\r\nthe Rabbit to that of the Rhinoceros, was still more closely allied to\r\nthe Tapir than to the Anoplotherium; it is found in the lower beds of\r\nthe gypseous formation, that is to say in the “Calcaire Grossier.”\r\n\r\nA Parisian geologist, M. Desnoyers, librarian of the Museum of Natural\r\nHistory there, has discovered in the gypseous beds of the valley of\r\nMontmorency, and elsewhere in the neighbourhood of Paris, as at Pantin,\r\nClichy, and Dammartin, the imprints of the footsteps of some Mammals, of\r\nwhich there seems to be some question, especially with regard to the\r\nAnoplotherium and Palæotherium. Footprints of Turtles, Birds, and even\r\nof Carnivora, sometimes accompany these curious traces, which have a\r\nsort of almond-shape more or less lobed, according to the divisions of\r\nthe hoof of the animal, and which recall to mind completely, in their\r\nmode of production and preservation, those imprints of the steps of the\r\nLabyrinthodon which have been mentioned as occurring in rocks of the\r\nTriassic period. This discovery is interesting, as it furnishes a means\r\nof comparison between the imprints and the animals which have produced\r\nthem. It brings into view, as it were, the material traces left in their\r\nwalks upon the soil by animals now annihilated, but who once occupied\r\nthe mysterious sites of an earlier world. (See Fig. 1, p. 12.)\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to picture in imagination the vast pasturages of the\r\nTertiary period swarming with Herbivora of all sizes. The country now\r\nsurrounding the city of Paris belongs to the period in question, and not\r\nfar from its gates, the woods and plains were crowded with “game” of\r\nwhich the Parisian sportsman little dreams, but which would nevertheless\r\nsingularly animate the earth at this distant epoch. The absence of great\r\nCarnivora explains the rapid increase of the agile and graceful denizens\r\nof the wood, whose race seems to have been so multiplied then, but which\r\nwas ultimately annihilated by the ferocious beasts of prey which\r\nafterwards made their appearance.\r\n\r\nThe same novelty, riches, and variety which distinguished the Mammals of\r\nthe Tertiary period extended to other classes of animals. The class of\r\nBirds, of which we can only name the most remarkable, was represented by\r\nthe curious fossil known as the “_Bird of Montmartre_.” The bones of\r\nother birds have been obtained from Hordwell, as well as the remains of\r\nquadrupeds. Among the latter the _Hyænodon_, supposed to be the oldest\r\nknown example of a true carnivorous animal in the series of British\r\nfossils, and the fossil Bat known as the _Vespertilio Parisiensis_.\r\nAmong Reptiles the Crocodile, which bears the name of Isle of Wight\r\nAlligator, _Crocodilus Toliapicus_. Among the Turtles the _Trionyx_, of\r\nwhich there is a fine specimen in the Museum of Natural History in Paris\r\n(Fig. 156).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 156.--Trionyx, or Turtle, of the Tertiary period.]\r\n\r\nIn the class Fishes we now see the _Pleuronectes_, or flat-fish, of\r\nwhich _Platax altissimus_ and _Rhombus minimus_ are well-known examples.\r\nAmong the Crustaceans we see the earliest crabs. At the same time\r\nmultitudes of new Mollusca make their appearance: _Oliva_, _Triton_,\r\n_Cassis_, _Harpa_, _Crepidula_, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXIII.--Ideal Landscape of the Eocene Period.]\r\n\r\nThe hitherto unknown forms of _Schizaster_ are remarkable among\r\nEchinoderms; the Zoophytes are also abundant, especially the\r\n_Foraminifera_, which seem to make up by their numbers for their\r\ndeficiency in size. It was in this period, in the bosom of its seas, and\r\nfar from shore, that the _Nummulites_ existed, whose calcareous\r\nenvelopes play such a considerable part as the elements of some of the\r\nTertiary formations. The shelly agglomerates of these Protozoan\r\nRhizopods constitute now very important rocks. The Nummulitic limestone\r\nforms, in the chain of the Pyrenees, entire mountains of great height;\r\nin Egypt it forms strata of considerable extent, and it is of these\r\nrocks that the ancient pyramids were built. What an enormous time must\r\nhave been necessary to convert the remains of these little shells into\r\nbeds many hundreds of feet thick! The _Miliola_ were also so abundant in\r\nthe Eocene seas as to constitute the greater part of calcareous\r\nrocks[83] out of which Paris has been built. Agglomerated in this\r\nmanner, these little shells form the continuous beds of limestone which\r\nare quarried for building purposes in the environs of Paris, at\r\nGentilly, Vaugirard, and Châtillon.\r\n\r\n  [83] Similar beds of Miliolite limestone are found in the Middle\r\n       Bagshot beds on the coast of Sussex, off Selsey--the only\r\n       instance in England of the occurrence of such calcareous deposits\r\n       of Middle Eocene age.--H. W. B.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the opposite page we present, in PLATE XXIII., an imaginary landscape\r\nof the Eocene period. We remark amongst its vegetation a mixture of\r\nfossil species with others belonging to the present time. The Alders,\r\nthe Wych-elms, and the Cypresses, mingle with _Flabellaria_; the Palms\r\nof extinct species. A great Bird--a wader, the _Tantalus_--occupies the\r\nprojecting point of a rock on the right; the Turtle (_Trionyx_), floats\r\non the river, in the midst of Nymphæas, Nenuphars, and other aquatic\r\nplants; whilst a herd of Palæotheria, Anoplotheria, and Xiphodon\r\npeacefully browse the grass of the natural meadows of this peaceful\r\noasis.\r\n\r\nWith a general resemblance in their fossils, nothing can be more\r\ndissimilar, on the whole, than the lithological or mineral characters of\r\nthe Eocene deposits of France and England; “those of our own island,”\r\nsays Lyell,[84] “being almost exclusively of mechanical\r\norigin--accumulations of mud, sand, and pebbles; while in the\r\nneighbourhood of Paris we find a great succession of strata composed of\r\nlimestones, some of them siliceous, and of crystalline gypsum and\r\nsiliceous sandstone, and sometimes of pure flint used for millstones.\r\nHence it is by no means an easy task to institute an exact comparison\r\nbetween the various members of the English and French series. It is\r\nclear that, on the sites both of Paris and London, a continual change\r\nwas going on in the fauna and flora by the coming in of new species and\r\nthe dying out of others; and contemporaneous changes of geographical\r\nconditions were also in progress in consequence of the rising and\r\nsinking of the land and bottom of the sea. A particular subdivision,\r\ntherefore, of time was occasionally represented in one area by land, in\r\nanother by an estuary, in a third by sea; and even where the conditions\r\nwere in both areas of a marine character, there was often shallow water\r\nin one, and deep sea in another, producing a want of agreement in the\r\nstate of animal life.” The Eocene rocks, as developed in France and\r\nEngland, may be tabulated as follows, in descending order:--\r\n\r\n  [84] “Elements of Geology,” p. 292.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 English.

Generally variegated, sometimes grey or white, it is\r\nemployed as a potter’s earth in the manufacture of delf-ware.\r\n\r\nIn England the red-mottled clay of the Woolwich and Reading Beds in\r\nHampshire and the Isle of Wight is often seen in contact with the chalk;\r\nbut in the south-eastern part of the London basin, Mr. Prestwich shows\r\nthat the Thanet Sand (consisting of a base of fine, light-coloured sand,\r\nmixed with more or less argillaceous matter) intervenes between the\r\nChalk and the Oldhaven Beds, or in their absence the Woolwich and\r\nReading beds, which lie below the London Clay. The Thanet Sands derive\r\ntheir name from their occurrence in the Isle of Thanet, in Kent, in the\r\neastern part of which county they attain their greatest development.\r\nUnder London and its southern suburbs the Thanet sand is from thirteen\r\nto forty-four feet thick, but it becomes thinner in a westerly\r\ndirection, and does not occur beyond Ealing.[85]\r\n\r\n  [85] “Memoir of the Geological Survey of Great Britain. The Geology of\r\n       Middlesex, &c.;” by W. Whitaker, p. 9.\r\n\r\nThe Woolwich and Reading beds in the Hampshire basin rest immediately on\r\nthe Chalk, and separate it from the overlying London Clay, as may be\r\nseen in the fine exposure of the Tertiary strata in Alum Bay, at the\r\nwestern extremity of the Isle of Wight, and in Studland Bay, on the\r\nwestern side of the Isle of Purbeck, in Dorsetshire.\r\n\r\nIn the London basin the Woolwich and Reading beds also rest on the\r\nChalk, where the Thanet Sands are absent, as is the case, for the most\r\npart, over the area west of Ealing and Leatherhead.\r\n\r\nThe beds in question are very variable in character, but may be\r\ngenerally described as irregular alternations of clays and sands--the\r\nformer mostly red, mottled with white, and from their plastic nature\r\nsuitable for the purposes of the potter; the latter also of various\r\ncolours, but sometimes pure white, and sometimes containing pebbles of\r\nflint.\r\n\r\nThe Woolwich and Reading beds are called after the localities of the\r\nsame names; they are fifty feet thick at Woolwich, and from sixty to\r\nseventy feet at Reading.\r\n\r\nThe Oldhaven beds (so termed by Mr. W. Whitaker from their development\r\nat the place of the same name in Kent) are a local deposit, occurring\r\nbeneath the London Clay on the south side of the London basin, from\r\nCroydon eastward, at the most eastern part of Surrey, and through\r\nKent--in the north-western corner of which county they form some\r\ncomparatively broad tracts. The beds consist of rounded flint pebbles,\r\nin a fine sandy base, or of fine light-coloured sand, and are from\r\neighty to ninety feet thick under London.\r\n\r\nThe London Clay, which has a breadth of twenty miles or more about\r\nLondon, consists of tenacious brown and bluish-grey clay, with layers of\r\nthe nodular concretions, called Septaria, which are well known on the\r\nEssex and Hampshire coasts, where they are collected for making Roman\r\ncement. The London Clay has a maximum thickness of nearly 500 feet. The\r\nfossils of the London Clay are of marine genera, and very plentiful in\r\nsome districts. Taken altogether they seem to indicate a moderate,\r\nrather than a tropical climate, although the Flora is, as far as can be\r\njudged, certainly tropical in its affinities.[86] The number of species\r\nof extinct Turtles obtained from the Isle of Sheppey alone, is stated by\r\nProf. Agassiz to exceed that of all the species of Chelone now known to\r\nexist throughout the globe. Above this great bed lie the Bracklesham and\r\nBagshot beds, which consist of light-yellow sand with an intermediate\r\nlayer of dark-green and brown clay, over which lie the Barton Clay (in\r\nthe Hampshire basin) and the white Upper Bagshot Sands, which are\r\nsucceeded by the Fluvio-marine series comprising the Headon, Bembridge,\r\nand Hempstead series, and consisting of limestones, clays, and marls, of\r\nmarine, brackish, and fresh-water origin.[87] For fuller accounts of the\r\nTertiary strata of England, the reader is recommended to the numerous\r\nexcellent memoirs of Mr. Prestwich, to the memoir “On the Tertiary\r\nFluvio-marine Formations of the Isle of Wight,” by Professor Edward\r\nForbes, and to the memoir “On the Geology of the London Basin,” by Mr.\r\nW. Whitaker.\r\n\r\n  [86] Prestwich. _Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._, vol. x., p. 448.\r\n\r\n  [87] Detailed sections of the whole of the Tertiary strata of the Isle\r\n       of Wight have been constructed by Mr. H. W. Bristow from actual\r\n       measurement of the beds in their regular order of succession, as\r\n       displayed at Hempstead, Whitecliff Bay, Colwell and Tolland’s\r\n       Bays, Headon Hill, and Alum Bay. These sections, published by the\r\n       Geological Survey of Great Britain, show the thickness, mineral\r\n       character, and organic remains found in each stratum, and are\r\n       accompanied by a pamphlet in explanation.\r\n\r\nAt the base of the _Argile Plastique_ of France is a conglomerate of\r\nchalk and of divers calcareous substances, in which have been found at\r\nBas-Meudon some remains of Reptiles, Turtles, Crocodiles, Mammals, and,\r\nmore lately, those of a large Bird, exceeding the Ostrich in size, the\r\n_Gastornis_, which Professor Owen classes among the wading rather than\r\namong aquatic birds. In the Soissonnais there is found, at the same\r\nhorizon, a great mass of lignite, enclosing some shells and bones of the\r\nmost ancient Pachyderm yet discovered, the _Coryphodon_, which resembles\r\nat once both the Anoplotherium and the Pig. The _Sables Inférieurs_, or\r\nBracheux Sands, form a marine bed of great thickness near Beauvais; they\r\nare principally sands, but include beds of calciferous clay and banks of\r\nshelly sandstone, and are considered to be older than the plastic clay\r\nand lignite, and to correspond with the Thanet Sands of England. They\r\nare rich in shells, including many Nummulites. At La Fère, in the\r\nDepartment of the Aisne, a fossil skull of _Arctocyon primævus_,\r\nsupposed to be related both to the Bear and to the Kinkajou, and to be\r\nthe oldest known Tertiary Mammal, was found in a deposit of this age.\r\nThis series seems to have been formed chiefly in fresh water.\r\n\r\nThe _Calcaire grossier_, consisting of marine limestones of various\r\nkinds, and with a coarse, sometimes compact, grain, is suitable for\r\nmason-work. These deposits, which form the most characteristic member\r\nof the Paris basin, naturally divide themselves into three groups of\r\nstrata, characterised, the first, by _Nummulites_; the second by\r\n_Miliolites_; and the third or upper beds by _Cerithia_. The beds are\r\nalso sometimes named Nummulite limestone, Miliolite limestone, and\r\nCerithium limestone. Above these a great mass, generally sandy, is\r\ndeveloped. It is marine at the base, and there are indications of\r\nbrackish water in its upper parts; it is called Beauchamp Sandstone, or\r\nSables Moyens (_Grès de Beauchamp_). These sands are very rich in\r\nshells. The _siliceous limestone_, or lower travertin, is a compact\r\nsiliceous limestone extending over a wide area, and resembles a\r\nprecipitate from mineral waters. The _gypseous_ formation consists of a\r\nlong series of marly and argillaceous beds, of a greyish, green, or\r\nwhite colour, in the intervals between which a thick deposit of gypsum,\r\nor sulphate of lime, is intercalated. This gypsum bed is found in its\r\ngreatest thickness in France at Montmartre and Pantin near Paris. The\r\nformation of this gypsum is probably due to the action of free sulphuric\r\nacid upon the carbonate of lime of the formation; the sulphuric acid\r\nitself being produced by the transformation of the gaseous masses of\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen emanating from volcanic vents, into that acid, by\r\nthe action of air and water. It was, as we have already said, in the\r\ngypsum-quarries of Montmartre that the numerous bones of Palæotherium\r\nand Anoplotherium were found. It is exclusively at this horizon that we\r\nfind the remains of these animals, which seem to have been preceded by\r\nthe _Coryphodon_, and afterwards by the _Lophiodon_; the order of\r\nsuccession in the appearance of these animals is now perfectly\r\nestablished. It may be added that round Paris the Eocene formation, from\r\nits lowest beds to the highest, is composed of beds of plastic clay, of\r\nthe _Calcaire grossier_ with its _Nummulites_, _Miliolites_, and\r\n_Alveolites_, followed by the gypseous formation; the series terminating\r\nin the Fontainebleau Sandstone, remarkable for its thickness and also\r\nfor its fine scenery, as well as for its usefulness in furnishing\r\npaving-stone for the capital. In Provence the same series of rocks are\r\ncontinued, and attain an enormous thickness. This upper part of the\r\nEocene deposit is entirely of lacustrine formation. Grignon has procured\r\nfrom a single spot, where they were embedded in a calcareous sand, no\r\nless than 400 fossils, chiefly formed of comminuted shells, in which,\r\nhowever, were well-preserved species both of marine, terrestrial, and\r\nfresh-water shells. Of the Paris basin, Sir Charles Lyell says: “Nothing\r\nis more striking in this assemblage of fossil testacea than the great\r\nproportion of species referable to the genus _Cerithium_. There occur no\r\nless than 137 species of this genus in the Paris basin, and almost all\r\nof them in the _Calcaire grossier_. Most of the living _Cerithia_ (Figs.\r\n157 and 168) inhabit the sea near the mouths of rivers, where the waters\r\nare brackish; so that their abundance in the marine strata now under\r\nconsideration is in harmony with the hypothesis that the Paris basin\r\nformed a gulf into which several rivers flowed.”[88]\r\n\r\n  [88] “Elements of Geology,” p. 300.\r\n\r\nTo give the reader some idea of the formation, first come the limestones\r\nand lower marls, which contain fine lignite or wood-coal produced from\r\nvegetable matter buried in moist earth, and excluded from all access of\r\nair, a material which is worked in some parts of the south of France as\r\nactively as a coal-mine. In these lignites _Anodon_ and other\r\nfresh-water shells are found.\r\n\r\nFrom the base of Sainte-Victoire to the other side of Aix, we trace a\r\nconglomerate characterised by its red colour, but which dies away in its\r\nprolongation westward. This conglomerate contains land-snails (_Helix_)\r\nof various sizes, mixed with fresh-water shells. Upon this conglomerate,\r\ncomprising therein the marls, rests a thick deposit of limestone with\r\nthe gypsum of Aix and Manosque, which is believed to correspond with\r\nthat of Paris. Some of the beds are remarkably rich in sulphur. The\r\ncalcareous marly laminæ which accompany the gypsum of Aix contain\r\nInsects of various kinds, and Fishes resembling _Lebias cephalotes_.\r\nFinally, the whole terminates at Manosque in a fresh series of marls and\r\nsandstones, alternating with beds of limestone with _Limnæa_ and\r\n_Planorbis_. At the base of this series are found three or four beds of\r\nlignite more inflammable than coal, which also give out a very\r\nsulphurous oil. We may form some estimate of the thickness of this last\r\nstage, if we add that, above the beds of fusible lignite, we may reckon\r\nsixty others of dry lignite, some of them capable of being very\r\nprofitably worked if this part of Provence were provided with more\r\nconvenient roads.\r\n\r\n“The Nummulitic formation, with its characteristic fossils,” says\r\nLyell,[89] “plays a far more conspicuous part than any other Tertiary\r\ngroup in the solid framework of the earth’s crust, whether in Europe,\r\nAsia, or Africa. It often attains a thickness of many thousand feet, and\r\nextends from the Alps to the Carpathians, and is in full force in the\r\nnorth of Africa, as, for example, in Algeria and Morocco. It has been\r\ntraced from Egypt, where it was largely quarried of old for the building\r\nof the Pyramids, into Asia Minor, and across Persia, by Bagdad, to the\r\nmouth of the Indus. It occurs not only in Cutch, but in the mountain\r\nranges which separate Scinde from Persia, and which form the passes\r\nleading to Caboul; and it has been followed still further eastward into\r\nIndia, as far as eastern Bengal and the frontiers of China.”\r\n\r\n  [89] Ibid., p. 305.\r\n\r\n“When we have once arrived at the conclusion,” he adds, “that the\r\nNummulitic formation occupies a middle place in the Eocene series, we\r\nare struck with the comparatively modern date to which some of the\r\ngreatest revolutions in the physical geography of Europe, Asia, and\r\nnorthern Africa must be referred. All the mountain chains, such as the\r\nAlps, Pyrenees, Carpathians, and Himalayas, into the composition of\r\nwhose central and loftiest parts the Nummulitic strata enter bodily,\r\ncould have had no existence till after the Middle Eocene period.”\r\n\r\nThe Eocene strata, Professor Ramsay thinks, extended in their day _much\r\nfurther_ west, “because,” he says, “here, at the extreme edge of the\r\nchalk escarpments, you find outlying fragments of them,” from which he\r\nargues that they were originally deposited all over the Chalk as far as\r\nthese points, but being formed of soft strata they were “denuded”\r\nbackwards.\r\n\r\nThe Beloptera represented in Fig. 195 are curious Belemnite-like\r\norganisms, occurring in Tertiary strata, and evidently the internal bone\r\nof a Cephalopod, having a wing-like projection or process on each side.\r\nAs a genus it holds a place intermediate between the Cuttle-fish and the\r\nBelemnite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 157.--Cerithium telescopium.\r\n\r\n(Living form.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MIOCENE PERIOD.\r\n\r\nThe Miocene formation is not present in England; unless we suppose, with\r\nSir Charles Lyell, that it is represented by the Hempstead beds of the\r\nIsle of Wight.\r\n\r\nIt is on the European continent that we find the most striking\r\ncharacteristics of the Miocene period. In our own islands traces of it\r\nare few and far between. In the Island of Mull certain beds of shale,\r\ninterstratified with basalt and volcanic ash, are described by the Duke\r\nof Argyll as of Miocene date;[90] and Miocene clay is found\r\ninterstratified with bands of imperfect coal at Bovey Tracey. The\r\nvegetation which distinguished the period is a mixture of the vegetable\r\nforms peculiar to the burning climate of the present tropical Africa,\r\nwith such as now grow in temperate Europe, such as Palms, Bamboos,\r\nvarious kinds of Laurels, Combretaceæ (Terminalia), with the grand\r\nLeguminales of warm countries (as _Phaseolites_, _Erythrina_,\r\n_Bauhinia_, _Mimosites_, _Acacia_); Apocyneæ analogous to the genera of\r\nour tropical regions; a _Rubiacea_ altogether tropical (_Steinhauera_)\r\nmingle with some Maples, Walnut-trees, Beeches, Elms, Oaks, and\r\nWych-elms, genera now confined to temperate and even cold countries.\r\n\r\n  [90] _Quarterly Journal of Geol. Soc._, vol. vii., p. 89.\r\n\r\nBesides these, there were, during the Miocene period, mosses, mushrooms,\r\ncharas, fig-trees, plane-trees, poplars, and evergreens. “During the\r\nsecond period of the Tertiary epoch,” says Lecoq, “the Algæ and marine\r\nMonocotyledons were less abundant than in the preceding age; the Ferns\r\nalso diminished, the mass of Conifers were reduced, and the Palms\r\nmultiplied in species. Some of those cited in the preceding period seem\r\nstill to belong to this, and the magnificent _Flabellaria_, with the\r\nfine _Phœnicites_, which we see now for the first time, gave animation\r\nto the landscape. Among the Conifers some new genera appear; among them\r\nwe distinguish _Podocarpens_, a southern form of vegetation of the\r\npresent age. Almost all the arborescent families have their\r\nrepresentatives in the forests of this period, where for the first time\r\ntypes so different are united. The waters are covered with _Nymphæa\r\nArithnæa_ (Brongniart); and with _Myriophyllites capillifolius_ (Unger);\r\n_Culmites animalis_ (Brongniart); and _C. Gœpperti_ (Munster), spring up\r\nin profusion upon their banks, and the grand _Bambusinites sepultana_\r\nthrows the shadow of its long articulated stem across them. Some\r\nanalogous species occupy the banks of the great rivers of the New World;\r\none Umbellifera is even indicated, by Unger, in the _Pimpinellites\r\nzizioides_.\r\n\r\nOf this period date some beds of lignite resulting from the\r\naccumulation, for ages, of all these different trees. It seems that\r\narborescent vegetation had then attained its apogee. Some _Smilacites_\r\ninterlaced like the wild vines with these grand plants, which fell on\r\nthe ground where they grew, from decay; some parts of the earth, even\r\nnow, exhibit these grand scenes of vegetation. They have been described\r\nby travellers who have traversed the tropical regions, where Nature\r\noften displays the utmost luxury, under the screen of clouds which does\r\nnot allow the rays of the sun to reach the earth. M. D’Orbigny cites an\r\ninteresting instance which is much to the point. “I have reached a\r\nzone,” he says (speaking of Rio Chapura in South America), “where it\r\nrains regularly all the year round. We can scarcely perceive the rays of\r\nthe sun, at intervals, through the screen of clouds which almost\r\nconstantly veils it. This circumstance, added to the heat, gives an\r\nextraordinary development to the vegetation. The wild vines fall on all\r\nsides, in garlands, from the loftiest branches of trees whose summits\r\nare lost in the clouds.”\r\n\r\nThe fossil species of this period, to the number of 133, begin to\r\nresemble those which enrich our landscapes. Already tropical plants are\r\nassociated with the vegetables of temperate climates; but they are not\r\nyet the same as existing species. Oaks grow side by side with Palms, the\r\nBirch with Bamboos, Elms with Laurels, the Maples are united to the\r\nCombretaceæ, to the Leguminales, and to the tropical Rubiaceæ. The forms\r\nof the species, belonging to temperate climates, are rather American\r\nthan European.\r\n\r\nThe luxuriance and diversity of the Miocene flora has been employed by a\r\nGerman savant in identifying and classifying the Middle Tertiary or\r\nMiocene strata of Switzerland. We are indebted to Professor Heer, of\r\nZurich, for the restoration of more than 900 species of plants, which he\r\nclassified and illustrated in his “Flora Tertiaria Helvetiæ.” In order\r\nto appreciate the value of the learned Professor’s undertaking, it is\r\nonly necessary to remark that, where Cuvier had to study the position\r\nand character of a bone, the botanist had to study the outline,\r\nnervation, and microscopic structure of a leaf. Like the great French\r\nnaturalist, he had to construct a new science at the very outset of his\r\ngreat work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 158.--Andrias Scheuchzeri.]\r\n\r\nThe Miocene formations of Switzerland are called _Molasse_ (from the\r\nFrench _mol_, soft), a term which is applied to a _soft_, incoherent,\r\ngreenish sandstone, occupying the country between the Alps and the Jura,\r\nand they may be divided into lower, middle, and upper Miocene; the\r\nmiddle one is marine, the other two being fresh-water formations. The\r\nupper fresh-water Molasse is best seen at Œningen, in the Rhine valley,\r\nwhere, according to Sir Roderick Murchison, it ranges ten miles east and\r\nwest from Berlingen, on the right bank, to Waugen and to Œningen, near\r\nStein, on the left bank. In this formation Professor Heer enumerates\r\ntwenty-one beds. No. 1, a bluish-grey marl seven feet thick, without\r\norganic remains, resting on No. 2, limestone, with fossil plants,\r\nincluding leaves of poplar, cinnamon, and pond-weed (_Potamogeton_). No.\r\n3, bituminous rock, with _Mastodon angustidens_. No. 5, two or three\r\ninches thick, containing fossil Fishes. No. 9, the stone in which the\r\nskeleton of the great Salamander _Andrias Scheuchzeri_ (Fig. 158) was\r\nfound. Below this, other strata with Fishes, Tortoises, the great\r\nSalamander, as before, with fresh-water Mussels, and plants. In No. 16,\r\nSir R. Murchison obtained the fossil fox of Œningen, _Galacynus\r\nŒningensis_ (Owen). In these beds Professor Heer had, as early as 1859,\r\ndetermined 475 species of fossil plants, and 900 insects.\r\n\r\nThe plants of the Swiss Miocene period have been obtained from a country\r\nnot one-fifth the size of Switzerland, yet such an abundance of species,\r\nwhich Heer reckons at 3,000, does not exist in any area of equal extent\r\nin Europe. It exceeds in variety, he considers, after making every\r\nallowance for all not having existed at the same time, and from other\r\nconsiderations, the Southern American forests, and rivals such tropical\r\ncountries as Jamaica and Brazil. European plants occupy a secondary\r\nplace, while the evergreen Oaks, Maples, Poplars, and Plane-trees,\r\nRobinias, and Taxodiums of America and the smaller Atlantic islands,\r\noccupy such an important place in the fossil flora that Unger was\r\ninduced to suggest the hypothesis, that, in the Miocene period the\r\npresent basin of the Atlantic was dry land--and this hypothesis has been\r\nably advocated by Heer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial animals which lived in the Miocene period were Mammals,\r\nBirds, and Reptiles. Many new Mammals had appeared since the preceding\r\nperiod; among others, Apes, Cheiropteras (Bats), Carnivora, Marsupials,\r\nRodents, Dogs. Among the first we find _Pithecus antiquus_ and\r\n_Mesopithecus_; the Bats, Dogs, and Coati inhabited Brazil and Guiana;\r\nthe Rats North America; the Genettes, the Marmots, the Squirrels, and\r\nOpossums having some affinity to the Opossums of America. Thrushes,\r\nSparrows, Storks, Flamingoes, and Crows, represent the class Birds.\r\nAmong the Reptiles appear several Snakes, Frogs, and Salamanders. The\r\nlakes and rivers were inhabited by Perches and Shad. But it is among the\r\nMammals that we must seek for the most interesting species of animals of\r\nthis period. They are both numerous and remarkable for their dimensions\r\nand peculiarities of form; but the species which appeared in the Miocene\r\nperiod, as in those which preceded it, are now only known by their\r\nfossil remains and bones.\r\n\r\nThe _Dinotherium_ (Fig. 159), one of the most remarkable of these\r\nanimals, is the largest terrestrial Mammal which has ever lived. For a\r\nlong time we possessed only very imperfect portions of the skeleton of\r\nthis animal, upon the evidence of which Cuvier was induced erroneously\r\nto place it among the Tapirs. The discovery of a lower jaw, nearly\r\nperfect, armed with defensive tusks descending from its lower jaw,\r\ndemonstrated that this hitherto mysterious animal was the type of an\r\naltogether new and singular genus. Nevertheless, as it was known that\r\nthere were some animals of the ancient world in which both jaws were\r\narmed, it was thought for some time that such was the case with the\r\nDinotherium. But in 1836, a head, nearly entire, was found in the\r\nalready celebrated beds at Eppelsheim, in the Grand Duchy of Hesse\r\nDarmstadt. In 1837 this fine fragment was carried to Paris, and exposed\r\nto public view. It was nearly a yard and a half long, and above a yard\r\nwide. The defences, it was found, were enormous, and were carried at the\r\nanterior extremity of the lower maxillary bone, and much curved inwards,\r\nas in the Morse. The molar teeth were in many respects analogous to\r\nthose of the Tapir, and the great suborbital apertures, joined to the\r\nform of the nasal bone, rendered the existence of a proboscis or trunk\r\nvery probable. But the most remarkable bone belonging to the Dinotherium\r\nwhich has yet been found is an omoplate or scapula, which by its form\r\nreminds us of that of the Mole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 159.--Dinotherium.]\r\n\r\nThis colossus of the ancient world, respecting which there has been so\r\nmuch argument, somewhat approaches the Mastodon; it seems to announce\r\nthe appearance of the Elephant; but its dimensions were infinitely\r\ngreater than those of existing Elephants, and superior even to those of\r\nthe Mastodon and of the Mammoth, both fossil Elephants, the remains of\r\nwhich we shall have to describe presently.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 160.--Teeth of Mastodon.]\r\n\r\nFrom its kind of life, and its frugal regimen, this Pachyderm scarcely\r\nmerited the formidable name of Dinotherium which has been bestowed on it\r\nby naturalists (from δεινος, _terrible_, θηριον, _animal_). Its size\r\nwas, no doubt, frightful enough, but its habits seem to have been\r\npeaceful. It is supposed to have inhabited fresh-water lakes, or the\r\nmouths of great rivers and the marshes bordering their banks by\r\npreference. Herbivorous, like the Elephant, it employed its proboscis\r\nprobably in seizing the plants which hung suspended over the waters, or\r\nfloated on their surface. We know that the elephants are very partial to\r\nthe roots of herbaceous plants which grow in flooded plains. The\r\nDinotherium appears to have been organised to satisfy the same tastes.\r\nWith the powerful natural mattock which Nature had supplied him for\r\npenetrating the soil, he would be able to tear from the bed of the\r\nriver, or lake, feculent roots like those of the Nymphæa, or even much\r\nharder ones, for which the mode of articulation of the jaws, and the\r\npowerful muscles intended to move them, as well as the large surface of\r\nthe teeth, so well calculated for grinding, were evidently intended\r\n(Fig. 160).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Mastodon_ was, to all appearance, very nearly of the size and form\r\nof our Elephant--his body, however, being somewhat longer, while his\r\nlimbs, on the contrary, were a little thicker. He had tusks, and very\r\nprobably a trunk, and is chiefly distinguished from the existing\r\nElephant by the form of his molar teeth, which form the most distinctive\r\ncharacter in his organisation. These teeth are nearly rectangular, and\r\npresent on the surface of their crown great conical tuberosities, with\r\nrounded points disposed in pairs to the number of four or five,\r\naccording to the species. Their form is very distinct, and may be easily\r\nrecognised. They do not bear any resemblance to those of the carnivora,\r\nbut are like those of herbivorous animals, and particularly those of the\r\nHippopotamus. The molar teeth are at first sharp and pointed, but when\r\nthe conical points are ground down by mastication, they assume the\r\nappearance presented in Fig. 161. When, from continued grinding, the\r\nconical teat-like points are more deeply worn, they begin to assume the\r\nappearance shown in Fig. 160. In Fig. 162 we represent the head and\r\nlower jaw of the Miocene Mastodon; from which it will appear that the\r\nanimal had two projecting tusks in the lower jaw, corresponding with two\r\nof much larger dimensions which projected from the upper jaw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 161.--Molar teeth of Mastodon, worn.]\r\n\r\nIt was only towards the middle of the last century that the Mastodon\r\nfirst attracted attention in Europe. About the year 1705, it is true,\r\nsome bones of this animal had been found at Albany, now the capital of\r\nNew York, but the discovery attracted little attention. In 1739, a\r\nFrench officer, M. de Longueil, traversed the virgin forests bordering\r\nthe great river Ohio, in order to reach the great river Mississippi, and\r\nthe savages who escorted him accidentally discovered on the borders of a\r\nmarsh various bones, some of which seemed to be those of unknown\r\nanimals. In this turfy marsh, which the natives designated the Great\r\nSalt Lake, in consequence of the many streams charged with salt which\r\nlose themselves in it, herds of wild ruminants still seek its banks,\r\nattracted by the salt--for which they have a great fondness--such being\r\nthe reason probably which had caused the accumulation, at this point, of\r\nthe remains of so large a number of quadrupeds belonging to these remote\r\nages in the history of the globe. M. de Longueil carried some of these\r\nbones with him, and, on his return to France, he presented them to\r\nDaubenton and Buffon; they consisted of a femur, one extremity of a\r\ntusk, and three molar teeth. Daubenton, after mature examination,\r\ndeclared the teeth to be those of a Hippopotamus; the tusk and the\r\ngigantic femur, according to his report, belonged to an Elephant; so\r\nthat they were not even considered to be parts of one and the same\r\nanimal. Buffon did not share this opinion, and he was not long in\r\nconverting Daubenton, as well as other French naturalists, to his views.\r\nBuffon declared that the bones belonged to an Elephant, whose race had\r\nlived only in the primitive ages of the globe. It was then, only, that\r\nthe fundamental notion of extinct species of animals, exclusively\r\npeculiar to ancient ages of the world, began to be entertained for the\r\nfirst time by naturalists--a notion which laid dormant during nearly a\r\ncentury, before it bore the admirable fruits which have since so\r\nenriched the natural sciences and philosophy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 162.--Head of the Mastodon of the Miocene period.\r\n\r\nA, B, the whole head; C, lower jaw.]\r\n\r\nBuffon gave the fossil the name of the _Animal or Elephant of the Ohio_,\r\nbut he deceived himself as to its size, believing it to be from six to\r\neight times the size of our existing Elephant; an estimate which he was\r\nled to make by an erroneous notion with regard to the number of the\r\nElephant’s teeth. The _Animal of the Ohio_ had only four molars, while\r\nBuffon imagined that it might have as many as sixteen, confounding the\r\ngerms, or supplementary teeth, which exist in the young animal, with the\r\npermanent teeth of the adult individual. In reality, however, the\r\nMastodon was not much larger than the existing species of African\r\nElephant.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of this animal had produced a great impression in Europe.\r\nBecoming masters of Canada by the peace of 1763, the English sought\r\neagerly for more of these precious remains. The geographer Croghan\r\ntraversed anew the region of the Great Salt Lake, pointed out by De\r\nLongueil, and found there some bones of the same nature. In 1767 he\r\nforwarded many cases to London, addressing them to divers naturalists.\r\nCollinson, among others, the friend and correspondent of Franklin, who\r\nhad his share in this consignment, took the opportunity of sending a\r\nmolar tooth to Buffon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 163.--Skeleton of Mastodon giganteus.]\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, till 1801 that the remains of the perfect skeleton\r\nwere discovered. An American naturalist, named Peale, was fortunate\r\nenough to get together two nearly complete skeletons of this important\r\nanimal. Having been apprised that many large bones had been found in the\r\nmarly clay on the banks of the Hudson, near Newburg, in the State of New\r\nYork, Mr. Peale proceeded to that locality. In the spring of 1801 a\r\nconsiderable part of one skeleton was found by the farmer who had dug it\r\nout of the ground, but, unfortunately, it was much mutilated by his\r\nawkwardness, and by the precipitancy of the workmen. Having purchased\r\nthese fragments, Mr. Peale sent them on to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 164.--Mastodon restored.]\r\n\r\nIn a marsh, situated five leagues west of the Hudson, the same gentleman\r\ndiscovered, six months after, a second skeleton of the Mastodon,\r\nconsisting of a perfect jaw and a great number of bones. With the bones\r\nthus collected, the naturalist managed to construct two nearly complete\r\nskeletons. One of these still remains in the Museum of Philadelphia; the\r\nother was sent to London, where it was exhibited publicly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 165.--Molar tooth of Mastodon.]\r\n\r\nDiscoveries nearly analogous to these followed, the most curious of\r\nwhich was made in this manner by Mr. Barton, a Professor of the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania. At a depth of six feet in the ground, and\r\nunder a great bank of chalk, bones of the Mastodon were found sufficient\r\nto form a skeleton. One of the teeth found weighed about seventeen\r\npounds (Fig. 165); but the circumstance which made this discovery the\r\nmore remarkable was, that in the middle of the bones, and enveloped in a\r\nkind of sac which was probably the stomach of the animal, a mass of\r\nvegetable matter was discovered, partly bruised, and composed of small\r\nleaves and branches, among which a species of rush has been recognised\r\nwhich is yet common in Virginia. We cannot doubt that these were the\r\nundigested remains of the food, which the animal had browsed on just\r\nbefore its death.\r\n\r\nThe aboriginal natives of North America called the Mastodon the _father\r\nof the ox_. A French officer named Fabri wrote thus to Buffon in 1748.\r\nThe natives of Canada and Louisiana, where these remains are abundant,\r\nspeak of the Mastodon as a fantastic creature which mingles in all their\r\ntraditions and in their ancient national songs. Here is one of these\r\nsongs, which Fabri heard in Canada: “When the great _Manitou_ descended\r\nto the earth, in order to satisfy himself that the creatures he had\r\ncreated were happy, he interrogated all the animals. The bison replied\r\nthat he would be quite contented with his fate in the grassy meadows,\r\nwhere the grass reached his belly, if he were not also compelled to keep\r\nhis eyes constantly turned towards the mountains to catch the first\r\nsight of the _father of oxen_, as he descended, with fury, to devour\r\nhim and his companions.”\r\n\r\nThe Cheyenne Indians have a tradition that these great animals lived in\r\nformer times, conjointly with a race of men whose size was proportionate\r\nto their own, but that the _Great Being_ destroyed both by repeated\r\nstrokes of his terrible thunderbolts.\r\n\r\nThe native Indians of Virginia had another legend. As these gigantic\r\nElephants destroyed all other animals specially created to supply the\r\nwants of the Indians, God, the thunderer, destroyed them; a single one\r\nonly succeeded in escaping. It was “the great male, which presented its\r\nhead to the thunderbolts and shook them off as they fell; but being at\r\nlength wounded in the side, he took to flight towards the great lakes,\r\nwhere he remains hidden to this day.” All these simple fictions prove,\r\nat least, that the Mastodon has lived upon the earth at some not very\r\ndistant period. We shall see, in fact, that it was contemporaneous with\r\nthe Mammoth, which, it is now supposed, may have been co-existent with\r\nthe earlier races of mankind, or only preceded a little the appearance\r\nof man.\r\n\r\nBuffon, as we have said, gave to this great fossil animal the name of\r\nthe Elephant of the Ohio; it has also been called the Mammoth of the\r\nOhio. In England it was received with astonishment. Dr. Hunter showed\r\nclearly enough, from the thigh-bone and the teeth, that it was no\r\nElephant; but having heard of the existence of the Siberian Mammoth, he\r\nat once came to the conclusion that they were bones of that animal. He\r\nthen declared the teeth to be carnivorous, and the idea of a\r\n_carnivorous elephant_ became one of the wonders of the day. Cuvier at\r\nonce dissipated the clouds of doubt which surrounded the subject,\r\npointing out the osteological differences between the several species,\r\nand giving to the American animal the appropriate name of Mastodon (from\r\nμαστος, _a teat_, and οδους, _a tooth_), or teat-like-toothed animal.\r\n\r\nMany bones of the Mastodon have been found in America since that time,\r\nbut remains are rarely met with in Europe, except as fragments--as the\r\nportion of a jaw-bone discovered in the Red Crag near Norwich, which\r\nProfessor Owen has named _Mastodon angustidens_. It was even thought,\r\nfor a long time, with Cuvier, that the Mastodon belonged exclusively to\r\nthe New World; but the discovery of many of the bones mixed with those\r\nof the Mammoth, (_Elephas primigenius_) has dispelled that opinion.\r\nBones of Mastodon have been found in great numbers in the Val d’Arno. In\r\n1858 a magnificent skeleton was discovered at Turin.\r\n\r\nThe form of the teeth of the Mastodon shows that it fed, like the\r\nElephant, on the roots and succulent parts of vegetables; and this is\r\nconfirmed by the curious discovery made in America by Barton. It lived,\r\nno doubt, on the banks of rivers and on moist and marshy lands. Besides\r\nthe great Mastodon of which we have spoken, there existed a Mastodon\r\none-third smaller than the Elephant, and which inhabited nearly all\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThere are some curious historical facts in connection with the remains\r\nof the Mastodon which ought not to be passed over in silence. On the\r\n11th of January, 1613, the workmen in a sand-pit situated near the\r\nCastle of Chaumont, in Dauphiny, between the cities of Montricourt and\r\nSaint-Antoine, on the left bank of the Rhône, found some bones, many of\r\nwhich were broken up by them. These bones belonged to some great fossil\r\nMammal, but the existence of such animals was at that time wholly\r\nunknown. Informed of the discovery, a country surgeon named Mazuyer\r\npurchased the bones, and gave out that he had himself discovered them in\r\na tomb, thirty feet long by fifteen broad, built of bricks, upon which\r\nhe found the inscription TEUTOBOCCHUS REX. He added that, in the same\r\ntomb, he found half a hundred medals bearing the effigy of Marius. This\r\nTeutobocchus was a barbarian king, who invaded Gaul at the head of the\r\nCimbri, and who was vanquished near _Aquæ Sextiæ_ (Aix in Provence) by\r\nMarius, who carried him to Rome to grace his triumphal procession. In\r\nthe notice which he published in confirmation of this story, Mazuyer\r\nreminded the public that, according to the testimony of Roman authors,\r\nthe head of the Teuton king exceeded in dimensions all the trophies\r\nborne upon the lances in the triumph. The skeleton which he exhibited\r\nwas five-and-twenty feet in length and ten broad.\r\n\r\nMazuyer showed the skeleton of the pretended Teutobocchus in all the\r\ncities of France and Germany, and also to Louis XIII., who took great\r\ninterest in contemplating this marvel. It gave rise to a long\r\ncontroversy, or rather an interminable dispute, in which the anatomist\r\nRiolan distinguished himself--arguing against Habicot, a physician,\r\nwhose name is all but forgotten. Riolan attempted to prove that the\r\nbones of the pretended king were those of an Elephant. Numerous\r\npamphlets were exchanged by the two adversaries, in support of their\r\nrespective opinions. We learn also from Gassendi, that a Jesuit of\r\nTournon, named Jacques Tissot, was the author of the notice published by\r\nMazuyer. Gassendi also proves that the pretended medals of Marius were\r\nforgeries, on the ground that they bore Gothic characters. It seems very\r\nstrange that these bones, which are still preserved in the cases of the\r\nMuseum of Natural History in Paris, where anybody may see them, should\r\never have been mistaken, for a single moment, for human remains. The\r\nskeleton of Teutobocchus remained at Bordeaux till 1832, when it was\r\nsent to the Museum of Natural History in Paris, where M. de Blainville\r\ndeclared that it belonged to a Mastodon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 166.--Skeleton of Mesopithecus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 167.--Mesopithecus restored. One-fifth natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nThe Apes made their appearance at this period. In the ossiferous beds\r\nof Sansan M. Lartet discovered the _Dryopithecus_, as well as _Pithecus\r\nantiquus_, but only in imperfect fragments. M. Albert Gaudry was more\r\nfortunate: in the Miocene rocks of Pikermi, in Greece, he discovered the\r\nentire skeleton of _Mesopithecus_, which we present here (Fig. 166),\r\ntogether with the same animal restored (Fig. 167). In its general\r\norganisation it resembles the dog-faced baboon or ape, a piece of\r\ninformation which has guided the artist in the restoration of the\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe seas of the Miocene period were inhabited by great numbers of beings\r\naltogether unknown in earlier formations; we may mention no less than\r\nninety marine genera which appear here for the first time, and some of\r\nwhich have lived down to our epoch. Among these, the molluscous\r\nGasteropods, such as _Conus_, _Turbinella_, _Ranella_, _Murex_ (Fig.\r\n169), and _Dolium_ are the most abundant; with many Lamellibranchiata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 168.--Cerithium plicatum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 169.--Murex Turonensis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 170.--Ostrea longirostris. One quarter natural size.\r\n\r\nLiving form.]\r\n\r\nThe Foraminifera are also represented by new genera, among which are the\r\nBolivina, Polystomella, and Dentritina.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Crustaceans include the genera _Pagurus_ (or the Hermit\r\ncrabs); _Astacus_. (the lobster); and _Portunus_ (or paddling crabs). Of\r\nthe first, it is doubtful if any fossil species have been found; of the\r\nlast, species have been discovered bearing some resemblance to\r\n_Podophthalmus vigil_, as _P. Defrancii_, which only differs from it in\r\nthe absence of the sharp spines which terminate the lateral angles of\r\nthe carapace in the former; while _Portunus leucodon_ (Desmarest) bears\r\nsome analogy to Lupea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXIV.--Ideal Landscape of the Miocene Period.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 171.--Podophthalmus vigil.]\r\n\r\nAn ideal landscape of the Miocene period, which is given on the opposite\r\npage (PLATE XXIV.), represents the Dinotherium lying in the marshy\r\ngrass, the Rhinoceros, the Mastodon, and an Ape of great size, the\r\n_Dryopithecus_, hanging from the branches of a tree. The products of the\r\nvegetable kingdom are, for the greater part, analogous to those of the\r\npresent time. They are remarkable for their abundance, and for their\r\ngraceful and serried vegetation; and still remind us in some respects,\r\nof the vegetation of the Carboniferous period. It is, in fact, a\r\ncontinuation of the characteristics of that period, and from the same\r\ncause, namely, the submersion of land under marshy waters, which has\r\ngiven birth to a sort of coal which is often found in the Miocene\r\nformation, and which we call _lignite_. This imperfect coal does not\r\nquite resemble that of the Carboniferous, or true Coal-measure period,\r\nbecause it is of much more recent date, and because it has not been\r\nsubjected to the same internal heat, accompanied by the same pressure of\r\nsuperincumbent strata, which produced the older coal-beds of the Primary\r\nepoch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 172.--Lupea pelagica.]\r\n\r\nThe _lignites_, which we find in the Miocene, as in the Eocene period,\r\nconstitute, however, a combustible which is worked and utilised in many\r\ncountries, especially in Germany, where it is made in many places to\r\nserve in place of coal. These beds sometimes attain a thickness of above\r\ntwenty yards, but in the environs of Paris they form beds of a few\r\ninches only, which alternate with clays and sands. We cannot doubt that\r\nlignites, like true coal, are the remains of the buried forests of an\r\nancient world; in fact, the substance of the woods of our forests, often\r\nin a state perfectly recognisable, is frequently found in the lignite\r\nbeds; and the studies of modern botanists have demonstrated, that the\r\nspecies of which the lignites are formed, belong to a vegetation\r\nclosely resembling that of Europe in the present day.\r\n\r\nAnother very curious substance is found with the lignite--yellow amber.\r\nIt is the mineralised resin, which flowed from certain extinct\r\npine-trees of the Tertiary epoch; the waves of the Baltic Sea, washing\r\nthe amber out of the deposits of sand and clay in which it lies buried,\r\nthis substance, being very little heavier than water, is thrown by the\r\nwaves upon the shore. For ages the Baltic coast has supplied commerce\r\nwith amber. The Phœnicians ascended its banks to collect this beautiful\r\nfossil resin, which is now chiefly found between Dantzic and Memel,\r\nwhere it is a government monopoly in the hands of contractors, who are\r\nprotected by a law making it theft to gather or conceal it.\r\n\r\nAmber,[91] while it has lost none of its former commercial value, is,\r\nbesides, of much palæontological interest; fossil insects, and other\r\nextraneous bodies, are often found enclosed in the nodules, where they\r\nhave been preserved in all their original colouring and integrity of\r\nform. As the poet says--\r\n\r\n  [91] See Bristow’s “Glossary of Mineralogy,” p. 11.\r\n\r\n    “The things themselves are neither rich nor rare,\r\n     The wonder’s how the devil they got there.”\r\n\r\nThe natural aromatic qualities of the amber combined with exclusion of\r\nair, &c., have embalmed them, and thus transmitted to our times the\r\nsmaller beings and the most delicate organisms of earlier ages.\r\n\r\nThe Miocene rocks, of marine origin, are very imperfectly represented in\r\nthe Paris basin, and their composition changes with the localities. They\r\nare divided into two groups of beds: 1. _Molasse_, or soft clay; 2.\r\n_Faluns_, or shelly marl.\r\n\r\nIn the Paris basin the _Molasse_ presents, at its base, quartzose sands\r\nof great thickness, sometimes pure, sometimes a little argillaceous or\r\nmicaceous. They include beds of sandstone (with some limestone), which\r\nare worked in the quarries of Fontainebleau, d’Orsay, and Montmorency,\r\nfor paving-stone for the streets of Paris and the neighbouring towns.\r\nThis last formation is altogether marine. To these sands and sandstones\r\nsucceeds a fresh-water deposit, formed of a whitish and partly siliceous\r\nlimestone, which forms the ground of the plateau of La Beauce, between\r\nthe valleys of the Seine and the Loire: this is called the _Calcaire de\r\nla Beauce_. It is there mixed with a reddish and more or less sandy\r\nclay, containing small blocks of burrh-stone used for millstones, easily\r\nrecognised by their yellow-ochreous colour, and the numerous cavities\r\nor hollows with which their texture is honeycombed.\r\n\r\nThis grit, or _silex meulier_, is much used in Paris for the arches of\r\ncellars, underground conduits, sewers, &c.\r\n\r\nThe _Faluns_ in the Paris basin consist of divers beds formed of shells\r\nand Corals, almost entirely broken up. In many parts of the country, and\r\nespecially in the environs of Tours and Bordeaux, they are dug out for\r\nmanuring the land. To the Falun series belong the fresh-water marl,\r\nlimestone, and sand, which composed the celebrated mound of Sansan, near\r\nAuch, in the Department of Gers, in which M. Lartet found a considerable\r\nnumber of bones of Turtles, Birds, and especially Mammals, such as\r\n_Mastodon_ and _Dinotherium_, together with a species of long-armed ape,\r\nwhich he named _Pithecus antiquus_, from the circumstance of its\r\naffording the earliest instance of the discovery of the remains of the\r\nquadrumana, or monkey-tribe, in Europe. Isolated masses of Faluns occur,\r\nalso, near the mouth of the Loire and to the south of Tours, and in\r\nBrittany.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 173.--Caryophylla cyathus.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLIOCENE PERIOD.\r\n\r\nThis last period of the Tertiary epoch was marked, in some parts of\r\nEurope, by great movements of the terrestrial crust, always due to the\r\nsame cause--namely, the continual and gradual cooling of the globe. This\r\nleads us to recall what we have repeatedly stated, that this cooling,\r\nduring which the outer zone of the fluid mass passed to the solid state,\r\nproduced irregularities and inequalities in the external surface,\r\nsometimes accompanied by fractures through which the semi-fluid or pasty\r\nmatter poured itself; leading afterwards to the upheaval of mountain\r\nranges through these gaping chasms. Thus, during the Pliocene period,\r\nmany mountains and mountain-chains were formed in Europe by basaltic and\r\nvolcanic eruptions. These upheavals were preceded by sudden and\r\nirregular movements of the elastic mass of the crust--by earthquakes, in\r\nshort--phenomena which have been already sufficiently explained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the nature of the vegetation of the period, as\r\ncompared with that with which we are familiar, let us listen to M.\r\nLecoq: “Arrived, finally,” says that author, “at the last period which\r\npreceded our own epoch--the epoch in which the temperate zones were\r\nstill embellished by tropical forms of vegetation, which were, however,\r\nslowly declining, driven out as it were by a cooling climate and by the\r\ninvasion of more vigorous species--great terrestrial commotions took\r\nplace: mountains are covered with eternal snow; continents now take\r\ntheir present forms; but many great lakes, now dried up, still existed;\r\ngreat rivers flowed majestically through smiling countries, whose\r\nsurface man had not yet come to modify.\r\n\r\n“Two hundred and twelve species compose this rich flora, in which the\r\nFerns of the earlier ages of the world are scarcely indicated, where the\r\nPalms seem to have quite disappeared, and we see forms much more like\r\nthose which are constantly under our observation. The _Culmites\r\narundinaceus_ (Unger) abounds near the water, where also grows the\r\n_Cyperites tertiarius_ (Unger), where floats _Dotamogeton geniculatus_\r\n(Braun), and where we see submerged _Isoctites Brunnii_ (Unger). Great\r\nConifers still form the forests. This fine family has, as we have seen,\r\npassed through every epoch, and still presents us with its elegant forms\r\nand persistent evergreen foliage; _Taxodites_, _Thuyoxylum_,\r\n_Abietites_, _Pinites_, _Eleoxylon_, and _Taxites_ being still the forms\r\nmost abundant in these old natural forests.\r\n\r\n“The predominating character of this period is the abundance of the\r\ngroup of the Amentaceæ; whilst the Conifers are thirty-two in number, of\r\nthe other we reckon fifty-two species, among which are many European\r\ngenera, such as _Alnus_; _Quercus_, the oak; _Salix_, the willow;\r\n_Fagus_, the beech; _Betula_, the birch, &c.\r\n\r\n“The following families constitute the arborescent flora of the period\r\nbesides those already mentioned:--Balsaminaceæ, Lauraceæ, Thymelæaceæ,\r\nSantalaceæ, Cornaceæ, Myrtaceæ, Calycanthaceæ, Pomaceæ, Rosaceæ,\r\nAmygdaleæ, Leguminosæ, Anacardiaceæ, Juglandaceæ, Rhamnaceæ,\r\nCelastrinaceæ, Sapindaceæ, Meliaceæ, Aceraceæ, Tiliaceæ, Magnoliaceæ,\r\nCapparidaceæ, Sapoteaceæ, Styracaceæ, Oleaceæ, Juncaceæ, Ericaceæ.\r\n\r\n“In all these families great numbers of European genera are found, often\r\neven more abundant in species than now. Thus, as Brongniart observes, in\r\nthis flora we reckon fourteen species of Maple; three species of Oak;\r\nand these species proceed from two or three very circumscribed\r\nlocalities, which would not probably, at the present time, represent in\r\na radius of several leagues more than three or four species of these\r\ngenera.”\r\n\r\nAn important difference distinguishes the Pliocene flora, as compared\r\nwith those of preceding epochs, it is the absence of the family of Palms\r\nin the European flora, as noted by Lecoq, which forms such an essential\r\nbotanical feature in the Miocene period. We mention this, because, in\r\nspite of the general analogy which exists between the vegetation of the\r\nPliocene period and that of temperate regions in the present day, it\r\ndoes not appear that there is a single species of the former period\r\nabsolutely identical with any one now growing in Europe. Thus, the\r\nEuropean vegetation, even at the most recent geological epoch, differs\r\nspecifically from the vegetation of our age, although a general\r\nresemblance is observable between the two.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 174.--Skeleton of the Mastodon of Turin.]\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial animals of the Pliocene period present us with a great\r\nnumber of creatures alike remarkable from their proportions and from\r\ntheir structure. The Mammals and the batrachian Reptiles are alike\r\ndeserving of our attention in this epoch. Among the former the Mastodon,\r\nwhich makes its first appearance in the Miocene formations, continues\r\nto be found, but becomes extinct apparently before we reach the upper\r\nbeds. Others present themselves of genera totally unknown till now, some\r\nof them, such as the _Hippopotamus_, the _Camel_, the _Horse_, the _Ox_,\r\nand the _Deer_, surviving to the present day. The fossil horse, of all\r\nanimals, is perhaps that which presents the greatest resemblance to\r\nexisting individuals; but it was small, not exceeding the ass in size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 175.--Head of Rhinoceros tichorhinus, partly\r\nrestored under the direction of Eugene Deslongchamps.]\r\n\r\nThe _Mastodon_, which we have considered in our description of the\r\npreceding period, still existed in Pliocene times; in Fig. 174 the\r\nspecies living in this latter age is represented--it is called the\r\nMastodon of Turin. As we see, it has only two projecting tusks or\r\ndefences in the upper jaw, instead of four, like the American species,\r\nwhich is described in page 343. Other species belonging to this period\r\nare not uncommon; the portion of an upper jaw-bone with a tooth which\r\nwas found in the Norwich Crag at Postwick, near Norwich, Dr. Falconer\r\nhas shown to be a Pliocene species, first observed in Auvergne, and\r\nnamed by Messrs. Croizet and Jobert, its discoverers, _Mastodon\r\nArvernensis_.\r\n\r\nThe _Hippopotamus_, _Tapir_, and _Camel_, which appear during the\r\nPliocene period, present no peculiar characteristics to arrest our\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe Apes begin to abound in species; the Stags were already numerous.\r\n\r\nThe _Rhinoceros_, which made its appearance in the Miocene period,\r\nappears in greater numbers in the Pliocene deposits. The species\r\npeculiar to the Tertiary epoch is _R. tichorhinus_, which is descriptive\r\nof the bony partition which separated its two nostrils, an anatomical\r\narrangement which is not found in our existing species. Two horns\r\nsurmount the nose of this animal, as represented in Fig. 175. Two living\r\nspecies, namely, the Rhinoceros of Africa and Sumatra, have two horns,\r\nbut they are much smaller than those of _R. tichorhinus_. The existing\r\nIndian Rhinoceros has only one horn.\r\n\r\nThe body of _R. tichorhinus_ was covered with very thick hair, and its\r\nskin was without the rough and callous scales which we remark on the\r\nskin of the living African species.\r\n\r\nContemporaneously with this gigantic species there existed a dwarf\r\nspecies about the size of our Hog; and along with it several\r\nintermediate species, whose bones are found in sufficient numbers to\r\nenable us to reconstruct the skeleton. The curvature of the nasal bone\r\nof the fossil Rhinoceros and its gigantic horn have given rise to many\r\ntales and popular legends. The famous bird, the _Roc_, which played so\r\ngreat a part in the fabulous myths of the people of Asia, originated in\r\nthe discovery in the bosom of the earth of the cranium and horns of a\r\nfossil Rhinoceros. The famous dragons of western tradition have a\r\nsimilar origin.\r\n\r\nIn the city of Klagenfurth, in Carinthia, is a fountain on which is\r\nsculptured the head of a monstrous dragon with six feet, and a head\r\nsurmounted by a stout horn. According to the popular tradition still\r\nprevalent at Klagenfurth, this dragon lived in a cave, whence it issued\r\nfrom time to time to frighten and ravage the country. A bold cavalier\r\nkills the dragon, paying with his life for this proof of his courage. It\r\nis the same legend which is current in every country, from that of the\r\nvaliant St. George and the Dragon and of St. Martha, who nearly about\r\nthe same age conquered the fabulous _Tarasque_ of the city of Languedoc,\r\nwhich bears the name of Tarascon.\r\n\r\nBut at Klagenfurth the popular legend has happily found a\r\nmouth-piece--the head of the pretended dragon, killed by the valorous\r\nknight, is preserved in the Hôtel de Ville, and this head has furnished\r\nthe sculptor for his fountain with a model for the head of his statue.\r\nHerr Unger, of Vienna, recognised at a glance the cranium of the fossil\r\nRhinoceros; its discovery in some cave had probably originated the fable\r\nof the knight and the dragon. And all legends are capable of some such\r\nexplanation when we can trace them back to their sources, and reason\r\nupon the circumstances on which they are founded.\r\n\r\nThe traveller Pallas gives a very interesting account of a _Rhinoceros\r\ntichorhinus_ which he saw, with his own eyes, taken out of the ice in\r\nwhich its skin, hair, and flesh had been preserved. It was in December,\r\n1771, that the body of the Rhinoceros was observed buried in the frozen\r\nsand upon the banks of the Viloui, a river which discharges itself into\r\nthe Lena below Yakutsk, in Siberia, in 64° north latitude. “I ought to\r\nspeak,” the learned naturalist says, “of an interesting discovery which\r\nI owe to the Chevalier de Bril. Some Yakouts hunting this winter near\r\nthe Viloui found the body of a large unknown animal. The Sieur Ivan\r\nArgounof, inspector of the Zimovic, had sent on to Irkutsk the head and\r\na fore and hind foot of the animal, all very well preserved.” The Sieur\r\nArgounof, in his report, states that the animal was half buried in the\r\nsand; it measured as it lay three ells and three-quarters Russian in\r\nlength, and he estimated its height at three and a half; the animal,\r\nstill retaining its flesh, was covered with skin which resembled tanned\r\nleather; but it was so decomposed that he could only remove the fore and\r\nhind foot and the head, which he sent to Irkutsk, where Pallas saw them.\r\n“They appeared to me at first glance,” he says, “to belong to a\r\nRhinoceros; the head especially was quite recognisable, since it was\r\ncovered with its leathery skin, and the skin had preserved all its\r\nexternal characters, and many short hairs. The eyelids had even escaped\r\ntotal decay, and in the cranium here and there, under the skin, I\r\nperceived some matter which was evidently the remains of putrefied\r\nflesh. I also remarked in the feet the remains of the tendons and\r\ncartilages where the skin had been removed. The head was without its\r\nhorn, and the feet without hoofs. The place of the horn, and the raised\r\nskin which had surrounded it, and the division which existed in both the\r\nhind and fore feet, were evident proofs of its being a Rhinoceros. In a\r\ndissertation addressed to the Academy of St. Petersburg, I have given a\r\nfull account of this singular discovery. I give there reasons which\r\nprove that a Rhinoceros had penetrated nearly to the Lena, in the most\r\nnorthern regions, and which have led to the discovery of the remains of\r\nother strange animals in Siberia. I shall confine myself here to a\r\ndescription of the country where these curious remains were found, and\r\nto the cause of their long preservation.\r\n\r\n“The country watered by the Viloui is mountainous; all the\r\nstratification of these mountains is horizontal. The beds consist of\r\nselenitic and calcareous schists and beds of clay, mixed with numerous\r\nbeds of pyrites. On the banks of the Viloui we meet with coal much\r\nbroken; probably coal-beds exist higher up near to the river. The brook\r\nKemtendoï skirts a mountain entirely formed of selenite or crystallised\r\nsulphate of lime and of rock-salt, and this mountain of alabaster is\r\nmore than 300 versts (about 200 miles), in ascending the Viloui, from\r\nthe place where the Rhinoceros was found. Opposite to the place we see,\r\nnear the river, a low hill, about a hundred feet high, which, though\r\nsandy, contains some beds of millstone. The body of the Rhinoceros had\r\nbeen buried in coarse gravelly sand near this hill, and the nature of\r\nthe soil, which is always frozen, had preserved it. The soil near the\r\nViloui never thaws to a great depth, for, although the rays of the sun\r\nsoften the soil to the depth of two yards in the more elevated sandy\r\nplaces, in the valleys, where the soil is half sand and half clay, it\r\nremains frozen at the end of summer half an ell below the surface.\r\nWithout this intense cold the skin of the animal and many parts of it\r\nwould long since have perished. The animal could only have been\r\ntransported from some southern country to the frozen north at the epoch\r\nof the Deluge, for the most ancient chronicles speak of no changes of\r\nthe globe more recent, to which we could attribute the deposit of these\r\nremains and of the bones of elephants which are found dispersed all over\r\nSiberia.”[92]\r\n\r\n  [92] “Pallas’s Voyage,” vol. iv., pp. 130-134.\r\n\r\nIn this extract the author refers to a memoir previously published by\r\nhimself, in the “Commentarii” of the Academy of St. Petersburg. This\r\nmemoir, written in Latin, and entitled “Upon some Animals of Siberia,”\r\nhas never been translated. After some general considerations, the author\r\nthus relates the circumstances attending the discovery of the fossil\r\nRhinoceros, with some official documents affirming their correctness,\r\nand the manner in which the facts were brought under his notice by the\r\nGovernor of Irkutsk, General Bril: “The skin and tendons of the head and\r\nfeet still preserved considerable flexibility, imbued as it were with\r\nhumidity from the earth; but the flesh exhaled a fetid ammoniacal odour,\r\nresembling that of a latrine. Compelled to cross the Baïkal Lake before\r\nthe ice broke up, I could neither draw up a sufficiently careful\r\ndescription nor make sketches of the parts of the animal; but I made\r\nthem place the remains, without leaving Irkutsk, upon a furnace, with\r\norders that after my departure they should be dried by slow degrees and\r\nwith the greatest care, continuing the process for some time, because\r\nthe viscous matter which incessantly oozed out could only be dissipated\r\nby great heat. It happened, unfortunately, that during the operation the\r\nposterior part of the upper thigh and the foot were burnt in the\r\noverheated furnace, and they were thrown away; the head and the\r\nextremity of the hind foot only remained intact and undamaged by the\r\nprocess of drying. The odour of the softer parts, which still contained\r\nviscous matter in their interior, was changed by the desiccation into\r\none resembling that of flesh decomposed in the sun.\r\n\r\n“The Rhinoceros to which the members belonged was neither large for its\r\nspecies nor advanced in age, as the bones of the head attest, yet it\r\nwas evidently an adult from the comparison made of the size of the\r\ncranium as compared with that of others of the same species more aged,\r\nwhich were afterwards found in a fossil state in divers parts of\r\nSiberia. The entire length of the head from the upper part of the nape\r\nof the neck to the extremity of the denuded bone of the jaw was thirty\r\ninches; the horns were not with the head, but we could still see evident\r\nvestiges of two horns, the nasal and frontal. The front, unequal and a\r\nlittle protuberant between the orbits, and of a rhomboidal egg-shape, is\r\ndeficient in the skin, and only covered by a light horny membrane,\r\nbristling with straight hairs as hard as horn.\r\n\r\n“The skin which covers the greater part of the head is in the dried\r\nstate, a tenacious, fibrous substance, like curried leather, of a\r\nbrownish-black on the outside and white in the inside; when burnt, it\r\nhad the odour of common leather; the mouth, in the place where the lips\r\nshould have been soft and fleshy, was putrid and much lacerated; the\r\nextremities of the maxillary bone were bare. Upon the left side, which\r\nhad probably been longest exposed to the air, the skin was here and\r\nthere decomposed and rubbed on the surface; nevertheless, the greater\r\npart of the mouth was so well preserved on the right side that the\r\npores, or little holes from which doubtless the hairs had fallen, were\r\nstill visible all over that side, and even in front. In the right side\r\nof the jaw there were still in certain places numerous hairs grouped in\r\ntufts, for the most part rubbed down to the roots, and here and there of\r\ntwo or three lines still retaining their full length. They stand erect,\r\nare stiff, and of an ashy colour, but with one or two black, and a\r\nlittle stiffer than the others, in each bunch.\r\n\r\n“What was most astonishing, however, was the fact that the skin which\r\ncovered the orbits of the eyes, and formed the eyelids, was so well\r\npreserved and so healthy that the openings of the eyelids could be seen,\r\nthough deformed and scarcely penetrable to the finger; the skin which\r\nsurrounded the orbits, though desiccated, formed circular furrows. The\r\ncavities of the eyes were filled with matter, either argillaceous or\r\nanimal, such as still occupied a part of the cavity of the cranium.\r\nUnder the skin the fibres and tendons still remained, and above all the\r\nremains of the temporal muscles; finally, in the throat hung some great\r\nbundles of muscular fibres. The denuded bones were young and less solid\r\nthan in other fossil crania of the same species. The bone which gave\r\nsupport to the nasal horn was not yet attached to the _vomer_; it was\r\nunprovided with articulations like the processes of the young bones. The\r\nextremities of the jaws preserved no vestige either of teeth or\r\nsockets, but they were covered here and there with the remains of the\r\nintegument. The first molar was distant about four inches from the\r\nextreme edge of the jaw.\r\n\r\n“The foot which remains to me, and which, if I am not mistaken, belongs\r\nto the left hind limb, has not only preserved its skin quite intact and\r\nfurnished with hairs, or their roots, as well as the tendons and\r\nligaments of the heel in all their strength, but also the skin itself\r\nquite whole as far as the bend in the knee. The place of the muscles was\r\nfilled with black mud. The extremity of the foot is cloven into three\r\nangles, the bony parts of which, with the periosteum, still remain here\r\nand there; the horny hoofs had been detached. The hairs adhering in many\r\nplaces to the skin were from one to three lines in length, tolerably\r\nstiff and ash-coloured. What remains of it proves that the foot was\r\ncovered with bunches of hair, which hung down.\r\n\r\n“We have never, so far as I know, observed so much hair on any\r\nrhinoceros which has been brought to Europe in our times, as appears to\r\nhave been presented by the head and feet we have described. I leave you\r\nthen to decide if our rhinoceros of the Lena was born or not in the\r\ntemperate climate of Central Asia. In fact, the rhinoceros, as I gather\r\nfrom the relations of travellers, belongs to the forests of Northern\r\nIndia; and it is likely enough that these animals differ in a more hairy\r\nskin from those which live in the burning zones of Africa, just in the\r\nsame way that other animals of a hotter climate are less warmly covered\r\nthan those of the same genera in temperate countries.”[93]\r\n\r\n  [93] “Commentarii Academiæ Petersburgicæ,” p. 3.\r\n\r\nOf all fossil ruminants one of the largest and most singular is the\r\n_Sivatherium_, whose remains have been found in the valley of Murkunda,\r\nin the Sewalik branch of the Sub-Himalayan Mountains. Its name is taken\r\nfrom that of Siva, the Indian deity worshipped in that part of India.\r\n\r\nThe _Sivatherium giganteum_ had a body as bulky as that of an ox, and\r\nbore a sort of resemblance to the living Elk. It combined in itself the\r\ncharacteristics of different kinds of Herbivores, at the same time that\r\nit was marked by individual peculiarities. The massive head possessed\r\nfour deciduous, hollow horns, like the Prongbuck; two front ones\r\nconical, smooth, and rapidly rising to a point, and two hinder ones of\r\nlarger size, and branched, projected forward above the eyes.[94] Thus it\r\ndiffered from the deer, whose solid horns annually drop off, and from\r\nthe antelope tribe, sheep and oxen, whose hollow horns are persistent,\r\nand resembled only one living ruminant, the prongbuck, in having had\r\nhollow horns subject to shedding. Fig. 176 is a representation of the\r\n_Sivatherium_ restored, in so far, at least, as it is possible to do so\r\nin the case of an animal of which only the cranium and a few other bones\r\nhave been discovered.\r\n\r\n  [94] Dr. James Murie, _Geological Magazine_, vol. viii., p. 438.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 176.--Sivatherium restored.]\r\n\r\nAs if to rival these gigantic Mammals, great numbers of Reptiles seem to\r\nhave lived in the Pliocene period, although they are no longer of the\r\nsame importance as in the Secondary epoch. Only one of these, however,\r\nneed occupy our attention, it is the _Salamander_. The living\r\nSalamanders are amphibious Batrachians, with smooth skins, and rarely\r\nattaining the length of twenty inches. The Salamander of the Tertiary\r\nepoch had the dimensions of a Crocodile; and its discovery opens a\r\npregnant page in the history of geology. The skeleton of this Reptile\r\nwas long considered to be that of a human victim of the deluge, and was\r\nspoken of as “_homo diluvii testis_.” It required all the efforts of\r\nCamper and Cuvier to eradicate this error from the minds of the learned,\r\nand probably in the minds of the vulgar it survived them both.\r\n\r\nUpon the left bank of the Rhine, not far from Constance, a little above\r\nStein, and near the village of Œningen, in Switzerland, there are some\r\nfine quarries of schistose limestone. In consequence of their varied\r\nproducts these quarries have often been described by naturalists; they\r\nare of Tertiary age, and were visited, among others, by Horace de\r\nSaussure, by whom they are described in the third volume of his “Voyage\r\ndans les Alpes.”\r\n\r\nIn 1725, a large block of stone was found, incrusted in which a skeleton\r\nwas discovered, remarkably well preserved; and Scheuchzer, a Swiss\r\nnaturalist of some celebrity, who added to his scientific pursuits the\r\nstudy of theology, was called upon to give his opinion as to the nature\r\nof this relic of ancient times. He thought he recognised in the skeleton\r\nthat of a man. In 1726 he published a description of these fossil\r\nremains in the “Philosophical Transactions” of London; and in 1731 he\r\nmade it the subject of a special dissertation, entitled “_Homo diluvii\r\ntestis_”--Man, a witness of the Deluge. This dissertation was\r\naccompanied by an engraving of the skeleton. Scheuchzer returned to the\r\nsubject in another of his works, “Physica Sacra,” saying: “It is certain\r\nthat this schist contains the half, or nearly so, of the skeleton of a\r\nman; that the substance even of the bones, and, what is more, of the\r\nflesh and of parts still softer than the flesh, are there incorporated\r\nin the stone; in a word, it is one of the rarest relics which we have of\r\nthat accursed race which was buried under the waters. The figure shows\r\nus the contour of the frontal bone, the orbits with the openings which\r\ngive passage to the great nerves of the fifth pair. We see there the\r\nremains of the brain, of the sphenoidal bone, of the roots of the nose,\r\na notable fragment of the maxillary bone, and some vestiges of the\r\nliver.”\r\n\r\nAnd our pious author exclaims, this time taking the lyrical form--\r\n\r\n    “Betrübtes Beingerüst von einem altem Sünder\r\n     Erweiche, Stein, das Herz der neuen Bosheitskinder!”\r\n\r\n    “O deplorable skeleton of an accursed ancient,\r\n     Mayst thou soften the hearts of the late children of wickedness!”\r\n\r\nThe reader has before him the fossil of the Œningen schist (Fig. 177).\r\nIt is obviously impossible to see in this skeleton what the enthusiastic\r\nsavant wished to perceive. And we can form an idea from this instance,\r\nof the errors to which a preconceived idea, blindly followed, may\r\nsometimes lead. How a naturalist of such eminence as Scheuchzer could\r\nhave perceived in this enormous head, and in these upper members, the\r\nleast resemblance to the osseous parts of a man is incomprehensible!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 177.--Andrias Scheuchzeri.]\r\n\r\nThe Pre-Adamite “witness of the deluge” made a great noise in Germany,\r\nand no one there dared to dispute the opinion of the Swiss naturalist,\r\nunder his double authority of theologian and savant. This, probably, is\r\nthe reason why Gesner in his “Traité des Pétrifactions,” published in\r\n1758, describes with admiration the fossil of Œningen, which he\r\nattributes, with Scheuchzer, to the _antediluvian man_.\r\n\r\nPierre Camper alone dared to oppose this opinion, which was then\r\nuniversally professed throughout Germany. He went to Œningen in 1787 to\r\nexamine the celebrated fossil animal; he had no difficulty in detecting\r\nthe error into which Scheuchzer had fallen. He recognised at once that\r\nit was a Reptile; but he deceived himself, nevertheless, as to the\r\nfamily to which it belonged; he took it for a Saurian. “A petrified\r\nlizard,” Camper wrote; “could it possibly pass for a man?” It was left\r\nto Cuvier to place in its true family the fossil of Œningen; in a memoir\r\non the subject he demonstrated that this skeleton belonged to one of the\r\namphibious batrachians called Salamanders. “Take,” he says in his\r\nmemoir, “a skeleton of a Salamander and place it alongside the fossil,\r\nwithout allowing yourself to be misled by the difference of size, just\r\nas you could easily do in comparing a drawing of the salamander of the\r\nnatural size with one of the fossil reduced to a sixteenth part of its\r\ndimensions, and everything will be explained in the clearest manner.”\r\n\r\n“I am even persuaded,” adds the great naturalist, in a subsequent\r\nedition of this memoir, “that, if we could re-arrange the fossil and\r\nlook closer into the details, we should find still more numerous proofs\r\nin the articular faces of the vertebræ, in those of the jaws, in the\r\nvestiges of very small teeth, and even in the labyrinth of the ear.” And\r\nhe invited the proprietors or depositaries of the precious fossil to\r\nproceed to such an examination. Cuvier had the gratification of making,\r\npersonally, the investigation he suggested. Finding himself at Haarlem,\r\nhe asked permission of the Director of the Museum to examine the stone\r\nwhich contained the supposed fossil man. The operation was carried on in\r\nthe presence of the director and another naturalist. A drawing of the\r\nskeleton of a Salamander was placed near the fossil by Cuvier, who had\r\nthe satisfaction of recognising, as the stone was chipped away under the\r\nchisel, each of the bones, announced by the drawing, as they made their\r\nappearance. In the natural sciences there are few instances of such\r\ntriumphant results--few demonstrations so satisfactory as this, of the\r\ncertitude of the methods of observation and induction on which\r\npalæontology is based.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the Pliocene period Birds of very numerous species, and which\r\nstill exist, gave animation to the vast solitudes which man had not yet\r\noccupied. Vultures and Eagles, among the rapacious birds; and among\r\nother genera of birds, gulls, swallows, pies, parroquets, pheasants,\r\njungle-fowl, ducks, &c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the marine Pliocene fauna we see, for the first time, aquatic Mammals\r\nor Cetaceans--the _Dolphin_ and _Balæna_ belonging to the period. Very\r\nlittle, however, is known of the fossil species belonging to the two\r\ngenera. Some bones of Dolphins, found in different parts of France,\r\napprise us, however, that the ancient species differed from those of our\r\ndays. The same remark may be made respecting the Narwhal. This Cetacean,\r\nso remarkable for its long tusk, or tooth, in the form of a horn, has\r\nat all times been an object of curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe Whales, whose remains are found in the Pliocene rocks, differ little\r\nfrom those now living. But the observations geologists have been able to\r\nmake upon these gigantic remains of the ancient world are too few to\r\nallow of any very precise conclusion. It is certain, however, that the\r\nfossil differs from the existing Whale in certain characters drawn from\r\nthe bones of the cranium. The discovery of an enormous fragment of a\r\nfossil Whale, made at Paris in 1779, in the cellar of a wine-merchant in\r\nthe Rue Dauphine, created a great sensation. Science pronounced, without\r\nmuch hesitation, on the true origin of these remains; but the public had\r\nsome difficulty in comprehending the existence of a whale in the Rue\r\nDauphine. It was in digging some holes in his cellars that the\r\nwine-merchant made this interesting discovery. His workmen found, under\r\nthe pick, an enormous piece of bone buried in a yellow clay. Its\r\ncomplete extraction caused him a great deal of labour, and presented\r\nmany difficulties. Little interested in making further discoveries, our\r\nwine-merchant contented himself with raising, with the help of a chisel,\r\na portion of the monstrous bone. The piece thus detached weighed 227\r\npounds. It was exhibited in the wine-shop, where large numbers of the\r\ncurious went to see it. Lamanon, a naturalist of that day, who examined\r\nit, conjectured that the bone belonged to the head of a whale. As to the\r\nbone itself, it was purchased for the Teyler Museum, at Haarlem, where\r\nit still remains.\r\n\r\nThere exists in the Museum of Natural History in Paris only a copy of\r\nthe bone of the whale of the Rue Dauphine, which received the name of\r\n_Balænodon Lamanoni_. The examination of this figure by Cuvier led him\r\nto recognise it as a bone belonging to one of the antediluvian Balænæ,\r\nwhich differed not only from the living species, but from all others\r\nknown up to this time.\r\n\r\nSince the days of Lamanon, other bones of Balæna have been discovered in\r\nthe soil in different countries, but the study of these fossils has\r\nalways left something to be desired. In 1806 a fossil Balæna was\r\ndisinterred at Monte-Pulgnasco by M. Cortesi. Another skeleton,\r\nseventy-two feet long, was found on the banks of the river Forth, near\r\nAlloa, in Scotland. In 1816 many bones of this animal were discovered in\r\na little valley formed by a brook running into the Chiavana, one of the\r\naffluents of the Po.\r\n\r\nCuvier has established, among the cetacean fossils, a particular genus,\r\nwhich he designates under the name of _Ziphius_. The animals to which he\r\ngave the name, however, are not identical either with the Whales\r\n(_Balænæ_), the Cachelots or Sperm Whales, or with the Hyperoodons. They\r\nhold, in the order of Cetaceans, the place that the Palæotherium and\r\nAnoplotherium occupy among the Pachyderms, or that which the Megatherium\r\nand Megalonyx occupy in the order of the Edentates. The _Ziphius_ still\r\nlives in the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 178.--Pecten Jacobæus.\r\n\r\n(Living species.)]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe genera of Mollusca, which distinguish this period from all others,\r\nare very numerous. They include the Cardium, Panopæa, Pecten (Fig.\r\n178), Fusus, Murex, Cypræa, Voluta, Chenopus, Buccinum, Nassa, and many\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Pliocene_ series prevails over Norfolk, Suffolk, and Essex, where\r\nit is popularly known as the Crag. In Essex it rests directly on the\r\nLondon Clay. Near Norwich it rests on the Chalk.\r\n\r\nThe _Pliocene rocks_ are divided into lower and upper. The _Older\r\nPliocene_ comprises the White or Coralline Crag, including the Red Crag\r\nof Suffolk, containing marine shells, of which sixty per cent. are of\r\nextinct species. The _Newer Pliocene_ is represented by the\r\nFluvio-marine or Norwich Crag, which last, according to the Rev. Osmond\r\nFisher, is overlaid by Chillesford clay, a very variable and more arctic\r\ndeposit, often passing suddenly into sands without a trace of clay.\r\n\r\nThe Norfolk Forest Bed rests upon the Chillesford clay, when that is not\r\ndenuded.\r\n\r\nA ferruginous bed, rich in mammalian remains, and known as the Elephant\r\nbed, overlies the Forest Bed, of which it is considered by the Rev. John\r\nGunn to be an upper division.\r\n\r\nThe Crag, divided into three portions, is a local deposit of limited\r\nextent. It consists of variable beds of sand, gravel, and marl;\r\nsometimes it is a shelly ferruginous grit, as the Red Crag; at others a\r\nsoft calcareous rock made up of shells and bryozoa, as the Coralline\r\nCrag.\r\n\r\nThe _Coralline Crag_, of very limited extent in this country, ranges\r\nover about twenty miles between the rivers Stour and Alde, with a\r\nbreadth of three or four. It consists of two divisions--an upper one,\r\nformed chiefly of the remains of Bryozoa, and a lower one of\r\nlight-coloured sands, with a profusion of shells. The upper division is\r\nabout thirty-six feet thick at Sudbourne in Suffolk, where it consists\r\nof a series of beds almost entirely composed of comminuted shells and\r\nremains of Bryozoa, forming a soft building-stone. The lower division is\r\nabout forty-seven feet thick at Sutton; making the total thickness of\r\nthe Coralline Crag about eighty-three feet.\r\n\r\nMany of the Coralline Crag Mollusca belong to living species; they are\r\nsupposed to indicate an equable climate free from intense cold--an\r\ninference rendered more probable by the prevalence of northern forms of\r\nshells, such as _Glycimeris_, _Cyprina_, and _Astarte_. The late\r\nProfessor Edward Forbes, to whom science is indebted for so many\r\nphilosophical deductions, points out some remarkable inferences drawn\r\nfrom the fauna of the Pliocene seas.[95] It appears that in the glacial\r\nperiod, which we shall shortly have under consideration, many shells,\r\npreviously established in the temperate zone, retreated southwards, to\r\navoid an uncongenial climate. The Professor gives a list of fifty which\r\ninhabited the British seas while the Coralline and Red Crag were\r\nforming, but which are all wanting in the glacial deposits;[96] from\r\nwhich he infers that they migrated at the approach of the glacial\r\nperiod, and returned again northwards, when the temperate climate was\r\nrestored.[97]\r\n\r\n  [95] Edward Forbes in “Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Great\r\n       Britain,” vol. i., p. 336.\r\n\r\n  [96] For full information on these deposits the reader is referred to\r\n       the “Memoirs on the Structure of the Crag-beds of Norfolk and\r\n       Suffolk,” by J. Prestwich, F.R.S., in the _Quart. Jour. Geol.\r\n       Soc._, vol. xxvii., pp. 115, 325, and 452 (1871). Also to the\r\n       many Papers by the Messrs. Searles Wood published in the _Quar.\r\n       Jour. Geol. Soc._, the _Ann. Nat. Hist._, the _Phil. Mag._, &c.\r\n\r\n  [97] Lyell’s “Elements of Geology,” p. 203.\r\n\r\nIn the Upper or Mammaliferous (or Norwich) Crag, of which there is a\r\ngood exposure in a pit near the asylum at Thorpe, bones of Mammalia are\r\nfound with existing species of shells. The greater number of the\r\nMammalian remains have been supposed, until lately, to be extraneous\r\nfossils; but they are now considered by Mr. Prestwich as truly\r\ncontemporaneous. The peculiar mixture of southern forms of life with\r\nothers of a more northern type lead to the inference that, at this early\r\nperiod, a lowering of temperature began gradually to set in from the\r\nperiod of the Coralline Crag to that of the Forest Bed, which marks the\r\ncommencement of the Glacial Period.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between the Mammaliferous Crag of Norwich and the Red\r\nCrag of Suffolk is purely palæontological, no case of superposition\r\nhaving yet been discovered, and they are now generally considered as\r\ncontemporaneous. Two Proboscidians abundant during the Crag period were\r\nthe _Mastodon Arvernensis_ and the _Elephas meridionalis_. In the Red\r\nCrag the Mastodon is stated by the Rev. John Gunn to be more abundant\r\nthan the Elephant, while in the Norwich beds their proportions are\r\nnearly equal.\r\n\r\nAt or near the base of the Red Crag there is a remarkable accumulation,\r\nvarying in thickness from a few inches to two feet, of bones, teeth, and\r\nphosphatic nodules (called coprolites), which are worked for making\r\nsuperphosphate of lime for agricultural manure.\r\n\r\nThe foreign equivalents of the older Pliocene are found in the\r\n_sub-Apennine strata_. These rocks are sufficiently remarkable in the\r\ncounty of Suffolk, where they consist of a series of marine beds of\r\nquartzose sand, coloured red by ferruginous matter.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the Apennine chain, which forms the backbone, as it\r\nwere, of Italy, throwing out many spurs, the formations on either side,\r\nand on both sides of the Adriatic, are Tertiary strata; they form in\r\nmany cases, low hills lying between the Apennines of Secondary formation\r\nand the sea, the strata generally being a light-brown or bluish marl\r\ncovered with yellow calcareous sand and gravel, with some fossil shells,\r\nwhich, according to Brocchi, are found all over Italy. But this wide\r\nrange includes some older Tertiary formations, as in the strata of the\r\nSuperga near Turin, which are Miocene.\r\n\r\nThe _Antwerp_ Crag, which is of the same age with the Red and Coralline\r\nCrag of Suffolk, forms great accumulations upon divers points of Europe:\r\nat Antwerp in Belgium, at Carentan and Perpignan, and, we believe, in\r\nthe basin of the Rhône, in France. The thickest deposits of this rock\r\nconsist of clay and sand, alternating with marl and arenaceous\r\nlimestone. These constitute the sub-Apennine hills, alluded to above as\r\nextending on both slopes of the Apennines. This deposit occupies the\r\nUpper Val d’Arno, above Florence. Its presence is recognised over a\r\ngreat part of Australia. Finally, the seven hills of Rome are composed,\r\nin part, of marine Tertiary rocks belonging to the Pliocene period.\r\n\r\nIn PLATE XXV. an ideal landscape of the Pliocene period is given under\r\nEuropean latitudes. In the background of the picture, a mountain,\r\nrecently thrown up, reminds us that the period was one of frequent\r\nconvulsions, in which the land was disturbed and upheaved, and mountains\r\nand mountain-ranges made their appearance. The vegetation is nearly\r\nidentical with the present. We see assembled in the foreground the more\r\nimportant animals of the period--the fossil species, as well as those\r\nwhich have survived to the present time.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Pliocene period, and in consequence of the deposits\r\nleft by the seas of the Tertiary epoch, the continent of Europe was\r\nnearly what it is now; few permanent changes have occurred since to\r\ndisturb its general outline. Although the point does not admit of actual\r\nproof, there is strong presumptive evidence that in this period, or in\r\nthat immediately subsequent to it, the entire European area, with some\r\ntrifling exceptions, including the Alps and Apennines, emerged from the\r\ndeep. In Sicily, Newer Pliocene rocks, covering nearly half the surface\r\nof the island, have been raised from 2,000 to 3,000 feet above the level\r\nof the sea. Fossil shells have been observed at the height of 8,000 feet\r\nin the Pyrenees; and, as if to fix the date of upheaval, there are great\r\nmasses of granite which have penetrated the Lias and the Chalk. Fossil\r\nshells of the period are also found at a height of 10,000 feet in the\r\nAlps, at 13,000 feet in the Andes, and at 18,000 feet in the Himalayas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXV.--Ideal Landscape of the Pliocene Period.]\r\n\r\nIn the mountainous regions of the Alps it is always difficult to\r\ndetermine the age of beds, in consequence of the disturbed state of the\r\nstrata; for instance, the lofty chain of the Swiss Jura consists of many\r\nparallel ridges, with intervening longitudinal valleys; the ridges\r\nformed of contorted fossiliferous strata, which are extensive in\r\nproportion to the number and thickness of the formations which have been\r\nexposed on upheaval. The proofs which these regions offer of\r\ncomparatively recent elevation are numerous. In the central Alps,\r\nCretaceous, Oolitic, Liassic, and Eocene strata are found at the\r\nloftiest summits, passing insensibly into metamorphic rocks of granular\r\nlimestone, and into talcose and mica-schists. In the eastern parts of\r\nthe chain the older fossiliferous rocks are recognised in similar\r\npositions, presenting signs of intense Plutonic action. Oolitic and\r\nCretaceous strata have been raised 12,000 feet, Eocene 10,000, and\r\nMiocene 4,000 and 5,000 feet above the level of the sea. Equally\r\nstriking proofs of recent elevation exist in the Apennines; the\r\ncelebrated Carrara marble, once supposed--from its crystalline texture\r\nand the absence of fossils, and from its resting--1. on talcose schists,\r\n2. on quartz and gneiss--to be very ancient, now turns out to be an\r\naltered limestone of the Oolitic series, and the underlying crystalline\r\nrocks to be metamorphosed Secondary sandstones and shales. Had all these\r\nrocks undergone complete metamorphism, another page in the earth’s\r\nhistory would have been obscured. As it is, the proofs of what we state\r\nare found in the gradual approach of the rocks to their unaltered\r\ncondition as the distance from the intrusive rock increases. This\r\nintrusive rock, however, does not always reach the surface, but it\r\nexists below at no great depth, and is observed piercing through the\r\ntalcose gneiss, and passing up into Secondary strata.\r\n\r\nAt the close of this epoch, therefore, there is every probability that\r\nEurope and Asia had pretty nearly attained their present general\r\nconfiguration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUATERNARY EPOCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Quaternary epoch of the history of our globe commences at the close\r\nof the Tertiary epoch, and brings the narrative of its revolutions down\r\nto our own times.\r\n\r\nThe tranquillity of the globe was only disturbed during this era by\r\ncertain cataclysms whose sphere was limited and local, and by an\r\ninterval of cold of very extended duration; the _deluges_ and the\r\n_glacial_ period--these are the two most remarkable peculiarities which\r\ndistinguished this epoch. But the fact which predominates in the\r\nQuaternary epoch, and distinguishes it from all other phases of the\r\nearth’s history is the appearance of man, the culminating and supreme\r\nwork of the Creator of the universe.\r\n\r\nIn this last phase of the history of the earth geology recognises three\r\nchronological divisions:--\r\n\r\n    1. The European Deluges.\r\n\r\n    2. The Glacial Period.\r\n\r\n    3. The creation of man and subsequent Asiatic Deluge.\r\n\r\nBefore describing the three orders of events which occurred in the\r\nQuaternary epoch, we shall present a brief sketch of the organic\r\nkingdoms of Nature, namely, of the animals and vegetables which\r\nflourished at this date, and the new formations which arose. Lyell, and\r\nsome other geologists, designate this the POST-TERTIARY EPOCH, which\r\nthey divide into two subordinate groups.--1. _The Post-Pliocene Period_;\r\n2. _The Recent or Pleistocene Period._\r\n\r\n\r\nPOST-PLIOCENE PERIOD.\r\n\r\nIn the days of Cuvier the Tertiary formations were considered as a mere\r\nchaos of superficial deposits, having no distinct relations to each\r\nother. It was reserved for the English geologists, with Sir Charles\r\nLyell at their head, to throw light upon this obscure page of the\r\nearth’s history; from the study of fossils, science has not only\r\nre-animated the animals, it has re-constructed the theatre of their\r\nexistence. We see the British Islands now a straggling archipelago, and\r\nthen the mouth of a vast river, of which the continent is lost; for,\r\nsays Professor Ramsay, “We are not of necessity to consider Great\r\nBritain as having always been an island; it is an accident that it is an\r\nisland now, and it has been an island many times before.” In the\r\nTertiary epoch we see it surrounded, then, by shallow seas swarming with\r\nnumerous forms of animal life; islands covered with bushy Palms; banks\r\non which Turtles basked in the sun; vast basins of fresh or brackish\r\nwater, in which the tide made itself felt, and which abounded with\r\nvarious species of sharks; rivers in which Crocodiles increased and\r\nmultiplied; woods which sheltered numerous Mammals and some Serpents of\r\nlarge size; fresh-water lakes which received the spoils of numerous\r\nshells. Dry land had increased immensely. Groups of ancient isles we\r\nhave seen united and become continents, with lakes, bays, and perhaps\r\ninland seas. Gigantic Elephants, vastly larger than any now existing,\r\nclose the epoch, and probably usher in the succeeding one; for we are\r\nnot to suppose any sudden break to distinguish one period from another\r\nin Nature, although it is convenient to arrange them so for the purposes\r\nof description. If we may judge from their remains, these animals must\r\nhave existed in great numbers, for it is stated that on the coast of\r\nNorfolk alone the fishermen, in trawling for oysters, dredged up between\r\n1820 and 1833, no less than 2,000 molar teeth of Elephants. If we\r\nconsider how slowly these animals multiply, these quarries of ivory, as\r\nwe may call them, must have required many centuries for their production\r\nand accumulation.\r\n\r\nThe same lakes and rivers were at this time occupied, also, by the\r\nHippopotamus, as large and as formidably armed as that now inhabiting\r\nthe African solitudes; also the two-horned Rhinoceros; and three species\r\nof Bos, one of which was hairy and bore a mane. Some Deer of gigantic\r\nsize, as compared with living species, bounded over the plains. In the\r\nsame savannahs lived the Reindeer, the Stag, a Horse of small size, the\r\nAss, the Bear, and the Roe, for Mammals had succeeded the Ichthyosauri\r\nof a former age. Nevertheless, the epoch had its tyrants also. A Lion,\r\nas large as the largest of the Lions of Africa, hunted its prey in the\r\nBritish jungles. Another animal of the feline race, the _Machairodus_\r\n(Fig. 179), was probably the most ferocious and destructive of\r\nCarnivora; bands of Hyænas and a terrible Bear, surpassing in size that\r\nof the Rocky Mountains, had established themselves in the caverns; two\r\nspecies of Beaver made their appearance on the scene.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 179.--_a_, Tooth of Machairodus, imperfect below,\r\nnatural size; _b_, outline of cast of tooth, perfect, half natural size;\r\n_c_, tooth of Megalosaurus, natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe finding of the remains of most of these animals in caverns was\r\nperhaps among the most interesting discoveries of geology. The discovery\r\nwas first made in the celebrated Kirkdale Cave in Yorkshire, which has\r\nbeen described by Dr. Buckland; and afterwards at Kent’s Hole, near\r\nTorquay. This latter pleasant Devonshire town is built in a creek, shut\r\nout from exposure on all sides except the south. In this creek, hollowed\r\nout of the rocks, is the great fissure or cavern known as Kent’s Hole;\r\nlike that of Kirkdale, it has been under water, from whence, after a\r\nlonger or shorter interval, it emerged, but remained entirely closed\r\ntill the moment when chance led to its discovery. The principal cavern\r\nis 600 feet in length, with many crevices or fissures of smaller extent\r\ntraversing the rock in various directions. A bed of hard stalagmite of\r\nvery ancient formation, which has been again covered with a thin layer\r\nof soil, forms the floor of the cavern, which is a red sandy clay. From\r\nthis bed of red loam or clay was disinterred a mass of fossil bones\r\nbelonging to extinct species of Bear, Lion, Rhinoceros, Reindeer,\r\nBeaver, and Hyæna.\r\n\r\nSuch an assemblage gave rise to all sorts of conjectures. It was\r\ngenerally thought that the dwelling of some beasts of prey had been\r\ndiscovered, which had dragged the carcases of elephants, deer, and\r\nothers into these caves, to devour them at leisure. Others asked if, in\r\nsome cases, instinct did not impel sick animals, or animals broken down\r\nby old age, to seek such places for the purpose of dying in quiet; while\r\nothers, again, suggested that these bones might have been engulfed\r\npell-mell in the hole during some ancient inundation. However that may\r\nbe, the remains discovered in these caves show that all these Mammals\r\nexisted at the close of the Tertiary epoch, and that they all lived in\r\nEngland. What were the causes which led to their extinction?\r\n\r\nIt was the opinion of Cuvier and the early geologists that the ancient\r\nspecies were destroyed in some great and sudden catastrophe, from which\r\nnone made their escape. But recent geologists trace their extinction to\r\nslow, successive, and determinative action due to local causes, the\r\nchief one being the gradual lowering of the temperature. We have seen\r\nthat at the beginning of the Tertiary epoch, in the older Eocene age,\r\npalms, cocoa-nuts, and acacias, resembling those now met with in\r\ncountries more favoured by the sun, grew in our island. The Miocene\r\nflora presents indications of a climate still warm, but less tropical;\r\nand the Pliocene period, which follows, contains remains which announce\r\nan approach to our present climate. In following the vegetable\r\nproductions of the Tertiary epoch, the botanist meets with the floras of\r\nAfrica, South America, and Australia, and finally settles in the flora\r\nof temperate Europe. Many circumstances demonstrate this decreasing\r\ntemperature, until we arrive at what geologists call the _glacial\r\nperiod_--one of the winters of the ancient world.\r\n\r\nBut before entering on the evidences which exist of the glacial era we\r\nshall glance at the picture presented by the animals of the period; the\r\nvegetable products we need not dwell on--it is, in fact, that of our own\r\nera, the flora of temperate regions in our own epoch. The same remark\r\nwould apply to the animals, but for some signal exceptions. In this\r\nepoch Man appears, and some of the Mammals of the last epoch, but of\r\nlarger dimensions, have long disappeared. The more remarkable of these\r\nextinct animals we shall describe, as we have those belonging to\r\nanterior ages. They are not numerous; those of our hemisphere being the\r\nMammoth, _Elephas primigenius_; the Bear, _Ursus spelæus_; gigantic\r\nLion, _Felis spelæa_; Hyæna, _Hyæna spelæa_; Ox, _Bison priscus_, _Bos\r\nprimigenius_; the gigantic Stag, _Cervus megaceros_; to which we may add\r\nthe _Dinornis_ and _Epiornis_, among birds. In America there existed in\r\nthe Quaternary epoch some Edentates of colossal dimensions and of very\r\npeculiar structure, these were _Megatherium_, _Megalonyx_, and\r\n_Mylodon_; we shall pass these animals in review, beginning with those\r\nof our own hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe Mammoth, the skeleton of which is represented in Fig. 180, surpassed\r\nthe largest existing Elephants of the tropics in size, for it was from\r\nsixteen to eighteen feet in height. The teeth, and the size of the\r\nmonstrous tusks, much curved, and with a spiral turn outwards, and which\r\nwere from ten to fifteen feet in length, serve to distinguish the\r\nMammoth from the two Elephants living at the present day, the African\r\nand the Indian. The form of its teeth permits of its being distinguished\r\nfrom its ally, the Mastodon; for while the teeth of the latter have\r\nrough mammillations on their surface, those of the Mammoth, like those\r\nof the living Indian Elephant, have a broad united surface, with regular\r\nfurrowed lines of large curvature. The teeth of the Mammoth are four in\r\nnumber, like the Elephants, two in each jaw when the animal is adult,\r\nits head is elongated, its forehead concave, its jaws curved and\r\ntruncated in front. It has been an easy task, as we shall see, to\r\nrecognise the general form and structure of the Mammoth, even to its\r\nskin. We know beyond a doubt that it was thickly covered with long\r\nshaggy hair, and that a copious mane floated upon its neck and along its\r\nback; its trunk resembled that of the Indian Elephant; its body was\r\nheavy, with a tail naked to the end, which was covered with thick tufty\r\nhair, and its legs were comparatively shorter than those of the latter\r\nanimal, many of the habits of which it nevertheless possessed.\r\nBlumenbach gave it the specific name of _Elephas primigenius_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 180.--Skeleton of the Mammoth, Elephas primigenius.]\r\n\r\nIn all ages, and in almost all countries, chance discoveries have been\r\nmade of fossil bones of elephants in the soil. Pliny has transmitted to\r\nus a tradition, recorded by the historian Theophrastus, who wrote 320\r\nyears before Jesus Christ, of the existence of bones of fossil ivory in\r\nthe soil of Greece, that the bones were sometimes transformed into\r\nstones. “These bones,” the historian gravely tells us, “were both black\r\nand white, and born of the earth.” Some of the elephant’s bones having a\r\nslight resemblance to those of man, they have often been mistaken for\r\nhuman bones. In the earlier historic times these great bones,\r\naccidentally disinterred, have passed as having belonged to some hero or\r\ndemigod; at a later period they were thought to be the bones of giants.\r\nWe have already spoken of the mistake made by the Greeks in taking the\r\npatella of a fossil elephant for the knee-bone of Ajax; in the same\r\nmanner the bones revealed by an earthquake, and attributed by Pliny to a\r\ngiant, belonged, no doubt, to a fossil elephant. To a similar origin we\r\nmay assign the pretended body of Orestes, thirteen feet in length, which\r\nwas discovered at Tegea by the Spartans; those of Asterius, the son of\r\nAjax, discovered in the Isle of Ladea, of ten cubits in length (about\r\neighteen feet), according to Pausanius; finally, such were the great\r\nbones found in the Isle of Rhodes, of which Phlegon of Tralles speaks in\r\nhis “Mundus Subterraneus.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 181.--Tooth of the Mammoth.]\r\n\r\nWe might fill volumes with the history of the remains of pretended\r\ngiants found in ancient tombs. The books, in fact, which exist, formed a\r\nvoluminous literature in the middle ages--entitled _Gigantology_. All\r\nthe facts, more or less real, true or imaginative, may be explained by\r\nthe accidental discovery of the bones of some of these gigantic animals.\r\nWe find in works on Gigantology, the history of a pretended giant,\r\ndiscovered in the 4th century, at Trapani in Sicily, of which Boccaccio\r\nspeaks, and which may be taken for Polyphemus; of another, found in the\r\n16th century, according to Fasellus, near Palermo; others, according to\r\nthe same author, at Melilli between Leontium and Syracuse, Calatrasi and\r\nPetralia, at each of which places the bones of supposed giants were\r\ndisinterred. P. Kircher speaks of three other giants being found in\r\nSicily, of which only the teeth remained perfect.\r\n\r\nIn 1577, a storm having uprooted an oak near the cloisters of Reyden, in\r\nthe Canton of Lucerne, in Switzerland, some large bones were exposed to\r\nview. Seven years after, the celebrated physician and Professor at\r\nBasle, Felix Pläten, being at Lucerne, examined these bones, and\r\ndeclared they could only be those of a giant. The Council of Lucerne\r\nconsented to send the bones to Basle for more minute examination, and\r\nPläten thought himself justified in attributing to the giant a height of\r\nnineteen feet. He designed a human skeleton on this scale, and returned\r\nthe bones with the drawing to Lucerne. In 1706 there only remained of\r\nthese bones a portion of the scapula and a fragment of the wrist bone;\r\nthe anatomist Blumenbach, who saw them at the beginning of the century,\r\neasily recognised in them the bones of an Elephant. Let us not omit to\r\nadd, as a complement to this story, that since the sixteenth century,\r\nthe inhabitants of Lucerne have adopted the image of this fabulous giant\r\nas the supporter of the city arms.\r\n\r\nSpanish history preserves many stories of giants. The supposed tooth of\r\nSt. Christopher, shown at Valence, in the church dedicated to the saint,\r\nwas certainly the molar tooth of a fossil Elephant; and in 1789, the\r\ncanons of St. Vincent carried through the streets in public procession,\r\nto procure rain, the pretended arm of a saint, which was nothing more\r\nthan the femur of an Elephant.\r\n\r\nIn France, in the reign of Charles VII. (1456), some of these bones of\r\nimaginary giants appeared in the bed of the Rhône. A repetition of the\r\nphenomenon occurred near Saint-Peirat, opposite Valence, when the\r\nDauphin, afterwards Louis XI., then residing at the latter place, caused\r\nthe bones to be gathered together and sent to Bourges, where they long\r\nremained objects of public curiosity in the interior of the\r\nSainte-Chapelle. In 1564 a similar discovery took place in the same\r\nneighbourhood. Two peasants observed on the banks of the Rhône, along a\r\nslope, some great bones sticking out of the ground. They carried them to\r\nthe neighbouring village, where they were examined by Cassanion, who\r\nlived at Valence. It was no doubt apropos to this that Cassanion wrote\r\nhis treatise “De Gigantibus.” The description given by the author of a\r\ntooth sufficed, according to Cuvier, to prove that it belonged to an\r\nElephant; it was a foot in length, and weighed eight pounds. It was also\r\non the banks of the Rhône, but in Dauphiny, as we have seen, that the\r\nskeleton of the famous Teutobocchus, of which we have spoken in a\r\nprevious chapter, was found.\r\n\r\nIn 1663 Otto de Guericke, the illustrious inventor of the air-pump,\r\nwitnessed the discovery of the bones of an Elephant, buried in the\r\nshelly limestone, or Muschelkalk. Along with it were found its enormous\r\ntusks, which should have sufficed to establish its zoological origin.\r\nNevertheless they were taken for horns, and the illustrious Leibnitz\r\ncomposed, out of the remains, a strange animal, carrying a horn in the\r\nmiddle of its forehead, and in each jaw a dozen molar teeth a foot long.\r\nHaving fabricated this fantastic animal, Leibnitz named it also--he\r\ncalled it the _fossil unicorn_. In his “Protogæa,” a work remarkable\r\nbesides as the first attempt at a theory of the earth, Leibnitz gave the\r\ndescription and a drawing of this imaginary animal. During more than\r\nthirty years the unicorn of Leibnitz was universally accepted throughout\r\nGermany; and nothing less than the discovery of the entire skeleton of\r\nthe Mammoth in the valley of the Unstrut was required to produce a\r\nchange of opinion. This skeleton was at once recognised by Tinzel,\r\nlibrarian to the Duke of Saxe-Gotha, as that of an Elephant, and was\r\nestablished as such; not, however, without a keen controversy with\r\nadversaries of all kinds.\r\n\r\nIn 1700 a soldier of Würtemberg accidentally observed some bones showing\r\nthemselves projecting out of the earth, in an argillaceous soil, near\r\nthe city of Canstadt, not far from the banks of the Necker. Having\r\naddressed a report to the reigning Duke, the latter caused the place to\r\nbe excavated, which occupied nearly six months. A veritable cemetery of\r\nelephants was discovered, in which were not less than sixty tusks. Those\r\nwhich were entire were preserved; the fragments were abandoned to the\r\ncourt physician, and they became a mere vulgar medicine. In the last\r\ncentury the fossil bones of bears, which were abundant in Germany, were\r\nadministered in that country medicinally, as an absorbent, astringent,\r\nand sudorific. It was then called by the German doctors the _Ebur\r\nfossile_, or _Unicornu fossile_, _Licorn fossil_. The magnificent tusks\r\nof the Mammoth found at Canstadt helped to combat fever and colic. What\r\nan intelligent man this court physician of Würtemberg must have been!\r\n\r\nNumerous discoveries like those we have quoted distinguished the 18th\r\ncentury; but the progress of science has now rendered such mistakes as\r\nwe have had to relate impossible. These bones were at length universally\r\nrecognised as belonging to an Elephant, but erudition now intervened,\r\nand helped to obscure a subject which was otherwise perfectly clear.\r\nSome learned pedant declared that the bones found in Italy and France\r\nwere the remains of the Elephants which Hannibal brought from Carthage\r\nwith the army in his expedition against the Romans. The part of France\r\nwhere the most ancient bones of these Elephants were found is in the\r\nenvirons of the Rhône, and consequently on the route of the Carthaginian\r\ngeneral, and this consideration appeared to these terrible savants to be\r\na particularly triumphant answer to the naturalist’s reasoning. Again,\r\nat a later period, Domitius Ænobarbus conducted the Carthaginian armies,\r\nwhich were followed by a number of Elephants, armed for war. Cuvier\r\nscarcely took the trouble to refute this insignificant objection. It is\r\nmerely necessary to read, in his learned dissertation, of the number of\r\nelephants which could remain to Hannibal when he had entered Gaul.\r\n\r\nBut the best reply that can be made to this strange objection raised by\r\nthe learned, is to show how extensively these fossil bones of Elephants\r\nare scattered, not in Europe only, but over the world--there are few\r\nregions of the globe in which their remains are not found. In the north\r\nof Europe, in Scandinavia, in Ireland, in Belgium, in Germany, in\r\nCentral Europe, in Poland, in Middle Russia, in South Russia, in Greece,\r\nin Italy, in Africa, in Asia, and, as we have seen, in England. In the\r\nNew World remains of the Mammoth are also met with. What is most\r\nsingular is that these remains exist more especially in great numbers in\r\nthe north of Europe, in the frozen regions of Siberia--regions\r\naltogether uninhabitable for the Elephant in our days. “There is not,”\r\nsays Pallas, “in all Asiatic Russia, from the Don to the extremity of\r\nthe promontory of Tchutchis, a stream or river, especially of those\r\nwhich flow in the plains, on the banks of which some bones of Elephants\r\nand other animals foreign to the climate have not been found. But in the\r\nmore elevated regions, the primitive and schistose chains, they are\r\nwanting, as are marine petrifactions. But in the lower slopes and in the\r\ngreat muddy and sandy plains, above all, in places which are swept by\r\nrivers and brooks, they are always found, which proves that we should\r\nnot the less find them throughout the whole extent of the country if we\r\nhad the same means of searching for them.”\r\n\r\nEvery year in the season when thaw takes place, the vast rivers which\r\ndescend to the Frozen Ocean in the north of Siberia sweep down with\r\ntheir waters numerous portions of the banks, and expose to view bones\r\nburied in the soil and in the excavations left by the rushing waters.\r\nCuvier gives a long list of places in Russia in which interesting\r\ndiscoveries have been made of Elephants’ bones; and it is certainly\r\ncurious that the more we advance towards the north in Russia the more\r\nnumerous and extensive do the bone depositories become. In spite of the\r\noft-repeated and undoubted testimony of numerous travellers, we can\r\nscarcely credit the statements made respecting some of the islands of\r\nthe glacial sea near the poles, situated opposite the mouth of the Lena\r\nand of the Indighirka. Here, for example, is an extract from “Billing’s\r\nVoyage” concerning these isles: “The whole island (which is about\r\nthirty-three leagues in length), except three or four small rocky\r\nmountains, is a mixture of ice and sand; and as the shores fall, from\r\nthe heat of the sun’s thawing them, the tusks and bones of the mammont\r\nare found in great abundance. To use Chvoinoff’s own expression, the\r\nisland is formed of the bones of this extraordinary animal, mixed with\r\nthe horns and heads of the buffalo, or something like it, and some horns\r\nof the rhinoceros.”\r\n\r\nNew Siberia and the Lächow Islands off the mouth of the river Lena, are,\r\nfor the most part, only an agglomeration of sand, ice, and Elephants’\r\nteeth. At every tempest the sea casts ashore new quantities of mammoths’\r\ntusks, and the inhabitants of Siberia carry on a profitable commerce in\r\nthis fossil ivory. Every year, during the summer, innumerable\r\nfishermen’s barks direct their course towards this _isle of bones_; and,\r\nduring winter, immense caravans take the same route, all the convoys\r\ndrawn by dogs, returning charged with the tusks of the Mammoth, each\r\nweighing from 150 to 200 pounds. The fossil ivory thus withdrawn from\r\nthe frozen north is imported into China and Europe, where it is employed\r\nfor the same purposes as ordinary ivory, which is furnished, as we know,\r\nby the existing Elephant and Hippopotamus of Africa and Asia.\r\n\r\nThe _Isle of Bones_ has served as a quarry of this valuable material,\r\nfor export to China, for 500 years; and it has been exported to Europe\r\nfor upwards of 100. But the supply from these strange diggings\r\napparently remains practically undiminished. What a number of\r\naccumulated generations of these bones and tusks does not this profusion\r\nimply!\r\n\r\nIt was in Siberia that the fossil Elephant received the name of the\r\n_Mammoth_, and its tusks that of _mammoth horns_. The celebrated Russian\r\nsavant, Pallas, who gave the first systematic description of the\r\nMammoth, asserts that the name is derived from the word _mama_, which in\r\nthe Tartar idiom signifies the _earth_. According to others, the name is\r\nderived from _behemoth_, mentioned in the Book of Job; or from the\r\nepithet _mahemoth_, which the Arabs add to the word “elephant,” to\r\ndesignate one of unusual size. A curious circumstance enough is, that\r\nthis same legend of an animal living exclusively under ground, exists\r\namongst the Chinese. They call it _tien-schu_, and we read, in the\r\ngreat Chinese work on natural history, which was written in the\r\nsixteenth century: “The animal named _tien-schu_, of which we have\r\nalready spoken in the ancient work upon the ceremonial entitled “Lyki”\r\n(a work of the fifth century before Jesus Christ), is called also\r\n_tyn-schu_ or _yn-schu_, that is to say, _the mouse which hides itself_.\r\nIt always lives in subterranean caverns; it resembles a mouse, but is of\r\nthe size of a buffalo or ox. It has no tail; its colour is dark; it is\r\nvery strong, and excavates caverns in places full of rocks, and\r\nforests.” Another writer, quoting the same passage, thus expresses\r\nhimself: “The _tyn-schu_ haunts obscure and unfrequented places. It dies\r\nas soon as it is exposed to the rays of the sun or moon; its feet are\r\nshort in proportion to its size, which causes it to walk badly. Its tail\r\nis a Chinese ell in length. Its eyes are small, and its neck short. It\r\nis very stupid and sluggish. When the inundations of the river\r\n_Tamschuann-tuy_ took place (in 1571), a great many tyn-schu appeared in\r\nthe plain; it fed on the roots of the plant _fu-kia_.”\r\n\r\nThe existence in Russia of the bones and tusks of the Mammoth is\r\nsufficiently confirmed by the following extract from an old Russian\r\ntraveller, Ysbrants Ides, who, in 1692, was sent by Peter the Great as\r\nambassador to the Emperor of China. In the extract which follows, we\r\nremark the very surprising fact of the discovery of a head and foot of\r\nthe Mammoth which had been preserved in ice with all the flesh. “Amongst\r\nthe hills which are situate north-east of the river Kata,” says the\r\ntraveller, “the Mammuts’ tongues and legs are found, as they are also\r\nparticularly on the shores of the river Jenize, Trugan, Mongamsea, Lena,\r\nand near Jakutskoi, even as far as the Frozen Ocean. In the spring, when\r\nthe ice of this river breaks, it is driven in such vast quantities and\r\nwith such force by the high swollen waters, that it frequently carries\r\nvery high banks before it, and breaks off the tops of hills, which,\r\nfalling down, discover these animals whole, or their teeth only, almost\r\nfrozen to the earth, which thaw by degrees. I had a person with me who\r\nhad annually gone out in search of these bones; he told it to me as a\r\nreal truth, that he and his companions found the head of one of these\r\nanimals, which was discovered by the fall of such a frozen piece of\r\nearth. As soon as he opened it, he found the greatest part of the flesh\r\nrotten, but it was not without difficulty that they broke out his teeth,\r\nwhich were placed in the fore-part of his mouth, as those of the\r\nElephants are; they also took some bones out of his head, and afterwards\r\ncame to his fore-foot, which they cut off, and carried part of it to the\r\ncity of Trugan, the circumference of it being as large as that of the\r\nwaist of an ordinary man. The bones of the head appeared somewhat red,\r\nas though they were tinctured with blood.\r\n\r\n“Concerning this animal there are very different reports. The heathens\r\nof Jakuti, Tungusi, and Ostiacki, say that they continually, or at\r\nleast, by reason of the very hard frosts, mostly live under ground,\r\nwhere they go backwards and forwards; to confirm which they tell us,\r\nthat they have often seen the earth heaved up when one of these beasts\r\nwas upon the march, and after he was passed, the place sink in, and\r\nthereby make a deep pit. They further believe, that if this animal comes\r\nso near to the surface of the frozen earth as to smell the air, he\r\nimmediately dies, which they say is the reason that several of them are\r\nfound dead on the high banks of the river, where they unawares came out\r\nof the ground.\r\n\r\n“This is the opinion of the Infidels concerning these beasts, which are\r\nnever seen.\r\n\r\n“But the old Siberian Russians affirm, that the Mammuth is very like the\r\nElephant, with this difference only, that the teeth of the former are\r\nfirmer, and not so straight as those of the latter. They also are of\r\nopinion that there were Elephants in this country before the Deluge,\r\nwhen this climate was warmer, and that their drowned bodies, floating on\r\nthe surface of the water of that flood, were at last washed and forced\r\ninto subterranean cavities; but that after this universal deluge, the\r\nair, which before was warm, was changed to cold, and that these bones\r\nhave lain frozen in the earth ever since, and so are preserved from\r\nputrefaction till they thaw, and come to light, which is no very\r\nunreasonable conjecture, though it is not absolutely necessary that this\r\nclimate should have been warmer before the Flood, since the carcases of\r\nthe drowned elephants were very likely to float from other places\r\nseveral hundred miles distant to this country in the great deluge which\r\ncovered the surface of the whole earth. Some of these teeth, which\r\ndoubtless have lain the whole summer on the shore, are entirely black\r\nand broken, and can never be restored to their former condition. But\r\nthose which are found in good case, are as good as ivory, and are\r\naccordingly transported to all parts of Muscovy, where they are used to\r\nmake combs, and all other such-like things, instead of ivory.\r\n\r\n“The above-mentioned person also told me that he once found two teeth in\r\none head that weighed above twelve Russian pounds, which amount to four\r\nhundred German pounds; so that these animals must of necessity be very\r\nlarge, though a great many lesser teeth are found. By all that I could\r\ngather from the heathens, no person ever saw one of these beasts alive,\r\nor can give any account of its shape; so that all we heard said on this\r\nsubject arises from bare conjecture only.”\r\n\r\nIt is possible this recital may seem suspicious to some readers. We have\r\nourselves felt some difficulty in believing that this head and foot were\r\ntaken from the ice, with the flesh and skin, when we consider that the\r\nanimal to which they belonged has been extinct probably more than ten\r\nthousand years. But the assertion of Ysbrants Ides is confirmed by\r\nrespectable testimony of more recent date. In 1800, a Russian\r\nnaturalist, Gabriel Sarytschew, travelled in northern Siberia. Having\r\narrived in the neighbourhood of the Frozen Ocean, he found upon the\r\nbanks of the Alasœia, which discharges itself into this sea, the entire\r\nbody of a Mammoth enveloped in a mass of ice. The body was in a complete\r\nstate of preservation, for the permanent contact of the ice had kept out\r\nthe air and prevented decomposition. It is well known that at zero and\r\nbelow it, animal substances will not putrefy, so that in our households\r\nwe can preserve all kinds of animal food as long as we can surround them\r\nwith ice; and this is precisely what happened to the Mammoth found by\r\nGabriel Sarytschew in the ice of the Alasœia. The rolling waters had\r\ndisengaged the mass of ice which had imprisoned the monstrous pachyderm\r\nfor thousands of years. The body, in a complete state of preservation\r\nand covered with its flesh as well as its entire hide, to which long\r\nhairs adhered in certain places, found itself, again, nearly erect on\r\nits four feet.\r\n\r\nThe Russian naturalist Adams, in 1806, made a discovery quite as\r\nextraordinary as the preceding. We borrow his account from a paper by\r\nDr. Tilesius in the “Memoirs of the Imperial Academy of Sciences of St.\r\nPetersburg” (vol. v.). In 1799, a Tungusian chief, Ossip Schumachoff,\r\nwhile seeking for mammoth-horns on the banks of the lake Oncoul,\r\nperceived among the blocks of ice a shapeless mass, not at all\r\nresembling the large pieces of floating wood which are commonly found\r\nthere. The following year he noticed that this mass was more disengaged\r\nfrom the blocks of ice, and had two projecting parts, but he was still\r\nunable to make out what it could be. Towards the end of the following\r\nsummer one entire side of the animal and one of his tusks were quite\r\nfree from the ice. But the succeeding summer of 1802, which was less\r\nwarm and more windy than common, caused the Mammoth to remain buried in\r\nthe ice, which had scarcely melted at all. At length, towards the end of\r\nthe fifth year (1803), the ice between the earth and the Mammoth having\r\nmelted faster than the rest, the plane of its support became inclined;\r\nand this enormous mass fell by its own weight on a bank of sand. In the\r\nmonth of March, 1804, Schumachoff cut off the horns (the tusks), which\r\nhe exchanged with the merchant Bultenof for goods of the value of fifty\r\nroubles (not quite eight pounds sterling). It was not till two years\r\nafter this that Mr. Adams, of the St. Petersburg Academy, who was\r\ntravelling with Count Golovkin, sent by the Czar of Russia on an embassy\r\nto China, having been told at Jakutsk of the discovery of an animal of\r\nextraordinary magnitude on the shores of the Frozen Ocean, near the\r\nmouth of the river Lena, betook himself to the place. He found the\r\nMammoth still in the same place, but altogether mutilated. The\r\nJakoutskis of the neighbourhood had cut off the flesh, with which they\r\nfed their dogs; wild beasts, such as white bears, wolves, wolverines,\r\nand foxes, had also fed upon it, and traces of their footsteps were seen\r\naround. The skeleton, almost entirely cleared of its flesh, remained\r\nwhole, with the exception of one fore-leg. The spine of the back, one\r\nscapula, the pelvis, and the other three limbs were still held together\r\nby the ligaments and by parts of the skin; the other scapula was found\r\nnot far off. The head was covered with a dry skin; one of the ears was\r\nfurnished with a tuft of hairs; the balls of the eyes were still\r\ndistinguishable; the brain still occupied the cranium, but seemed dried\r\nup; the point of the lower lip had been gnawed and the upper lip had\r\nbeen destroyed so as to expose the teeth; the neck was furnished with a\r\nlong flowing mane; the skin, of a dark-grey colour, covered with black\r\nhairs and a reddish wool, was so heavy that ten persons found great\r\ndifficulty in transporting it to the shore. There was collected,\r\naccording to Mr. Adams, more than thirty-six pounds’ weight of hair and\r\nwool which the white bears had trod into the ground, while devouring the\r\nflesh. This Mammoth was a male so fat and well fed, according to the\r\nassertion of the Tungusian chief, that its belly hung down below the\r\njoints of its knees. Its tusks were nine feet six inches in length,\r\nmeasured along the curve, and its head without the tusks weighed 414\r\npounds avoirdupois.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams took every care to collect all that remained of this unique\r\nspecimen of an ancient creation, and forwarded the parts to St.\r\nPetersburg, a distance of 11,000 versts (7,330 miles). He succeeded in\r\nre-purchasing what he believed to be the tusks at Jakutsk, and the\r\nEmperor of Russia, who became the owner of this precious relic, paid him\r\n8,000 roubles. The skeleton is deposited in the Museum of the Academy of\r\nSt. Petersburg, and the skin still remains attached to the head and the\r\nfeet. “We have yet to find,” says Cuvier, “any individual equal to\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXVI.--Skeleton of the Mammoth in the St. Petersburg\r\nMuseum.]\r\n\r\nBeside the skeleton of this famous Mammoth there is placed that of an\r\nIndian Elephant, and another Elephant with skin and hair, in order that\r\nthe visitor may have a proper appreciation of the vast proportions of\r\nthe Mammoth, as compared with them. PLATE XXVI., on the opposite page,\r\nrepresents the saloon of the Museum of St. Petersburg, which contains\r\nthese three interesting remains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 182.--Mammoth restored.]\r\n\r\nIn 1860 a great number of bones of the Mammoth, with remains of Hyæna,\r\nHorse, Reindeer, Rhinoceros-megarhinus, and Bison, were found in Belgium\r\nin digging a canal at Lierre, in the province of Antwerp. An entire\r\nskeleton of a young Mammoth, eleven feet six inches high (to the\r\nshoulder), has been reconstructed from these remains by M. Dupont, and\r\nis now placed in the Royal Museum of Natural History in Brussels.[98]\r\n\r\n  [98] H. Woodward, _Geological Magazine_, vol. viii., p. 193.\r\n\r\nWe cannot doubt, after such testimony, of the existence in the frozen\r\nnorth, of the almost entire remains of the Mammoth. The animals seem to\r\nhave perished suddenly; enveloped in ice at the moment of their death,\r\ntheir bodies have been preserved from decomposition by the continued\r\naction of the cold. If we suppose that one of those animals had sunk\r\ninto a marsh which froze soon afterwards, or had fallen accidentally\r\ninto the crevasse of some glacier, it would be easy for us to understand\r\nhow its body, buried immediately under eternal ice, had remained there\r\nfor thousands of years without undergoing decomposition.\r\n\r\nIn Cuvier’s great work on _fossil bones_, he gives a long and minute\r\nenumeration of the various regions of Germany, France, Italy, and other\r\ncountries, which have furnished in our days bones or tusks of the\r\nMammoth. We venture to quote two of these descriptions:--“In October,\r\n1816,” he says, “there was discovered at Seilberg, near Canstadt, in\r\nWürtemberg, near which some remarkable discoveries were made in 1700, a\r\nvery remarkable deposit, which the king, Frederick I., caused to be\r\nexcavated, and its contents collected with the greatest care. We are\r\neven assured that the visit which the prince, in his ardour for all that\r\nwas great, paid to this spot, aggravated the malady of which he died a\r\nfew days after. An officer, Herr Natter, commenced some excavations, and\r\nin four-and-twenty hours discovered twenty-one teeth or fragments of\r\nteeth of elephant, mixed with a great number of bones. The king having\r\nordered him to continue the excavations, on the second day they came\r\nupon a group of thirteen tusks heaped close upon each other, and along\r\nwith them some molar teeth, lying as if they had been packed\r\nartificially. It was on this discovery that the king caused himself to\r\nbe transported thither, and ordered all the surrounding soil to be dug\r\nup, and every object to be carefully preserved in its original position.\r\nThe largest of the tusks, though it had lost its points and its roots,\r\nwas still eight feet long and one foot in diameter. Many isolated tusks\r\nwere also found, with a quantity of molar teeth, from two inches to a\r\nfoot in length, some still adhering to the jaws. All these fragments\r\nwere better preserved than those of 1700, which was attributed to the\r\ndepth of the bed, and, perhaps, to the nature of the soil. The tusks\r\nwere generally much curved. In the same deposit some bones of Horses and\r\nStags were found, together with a quantity of teeth of the Rhinoceros,\r\nand others which were thought to belong to a Bear, and one specimen\r\nwhich was attributed to the Tapir. The place where this discovery was\r\nmade is named Seilberg; it is about 600 paces from the city of Canstadt,\r\nbut on the opposite side of the Necker.\r\n\r\n“All the great river basins of Germany have, like those of the Necker,\r\nyielded fossil bones of the Elephant; those especially abutting on the\r\nRhine are too numerous to be mentioned, nor is Canstadt the only place\r\nin the valley of the Necker where they are found.”\r\n\r\nBut of all parts of Europe, that in which they are found in greatest\r\nnumbers is the valley of the Upper Arno. We find there a perfect\r\ncemetery of Elephants. These bones were at one time so common in this\r\nvalley, that the peasantry employed them, indiscriminately with stones,\r\nin constructing walls and houses. Since they have learned their value,\r\nhowever, they reserve them for sale to travellers.\r\n\r\nThe bones and tusks of the Mammoth are met with in America as well as in\r\nthe Old World, scattered through Canada, Oregon, and the Northern States\r\nas far south as the Gulf of Mexico. Cuvier enumerates several places on\r\nthat continent where their remains are met with, mingled with those of\r\nthe Mastodon. The Russian Lieutenant Kotzebue found them on the north\r\ncoast of America, in the cliffs of frozen mud in Eschsholtz Bay, within\r\nBehring’s Strait, and in other distant parts of the shores of the Arctic\r\nSeas, where they were so common that the sailors burnt many pieces in\r\ntheir fires.\r\n\r\nIt is very strange that the East Indies, that is, one of the only two\r\nregions which is now the home of the Elephant, should be almost the only\r\ncountry in which the fossil bones of these animals have not been\r\ndiscovered. In short, from the preceding enumeration, it appears that,\r\nduring the geological period whose history we are recording the gigantic\r\nMammoth inhabited most regions of the globe. Now-a-days, the only\r\nclimates which are suited for the existing race of Elephants are those\r\nof Africa and India, that is to say, tropical countries; from which we\r\nmust draw the conclusions to which so many other inferences lead, that,\r\nat the epoch in which these animals lived, the temperature of the earth\r\nwas much higher than in our days; or, more probably, the extinct race of\r\nElephants must have been adapted for living in a colder climate than\r\nthat which they now require.\r\n\r\nAmong the antediluvian Carnivora, one of the most formidable seems to\r\nhave been the _Ursus spelæus_, or Cave-bear (Fig. 183). This species\r\nmust have been a fifth, if not a fourth, larger than the Brown Bear of\r\nour days. It was also more squat: some of the skeletons we possess are\r\nfrom nine to ten feet long, and only about six feet high. The _U.\r\nspelæus_ abounded in England, France, Belgium, and Germany; and so\r\nextensively in the latter country, that the teeth of the antediluvian\r\nBear, as we have already stated, formed for a long time part of its\r\nmateria medica, under the name of _fossil licorn_. Fig. 183 represents\r\nthe skull of the Cave-bear.\r\n\r\nAt the same time with the _Ursus spelæus_ another Carnivore, the _Felis\r\nspelæus_, or Cave-lion, lived in Europe. This animal is specifically\r\nidentical with the living Lion of Asia and Africa: but since in these\r\nearly times he had not to contend with the hunter for food, he was, on\r\nthe whole, considerably larger than any Lion now existing on the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 183.--Head of Ursus spelæus.]\r\n\r\nThe Hyænas of our age consist of two species, the striped and the\r\nspotted Hyænas. The last presents considerable conformity in its\r\nstructure with that of the Post-pliocene period, which Cuvier designates\r\nunder the name of the fossil Spotted Hyæna. It seems to have been only a\r\nlittle larger than the existing species. Fig. 184 represents the head of\r\nthe _Hyæna spelæa_, whose remains, with those of others, were found in\r\nthe caves of Kirkdale and Kent’s Hole; the remains of about 300 being\r\nfound in the former. Dr. Buckland satisfied himself, from the quantity\r\nof their dung, that the Hyænas had lived there. In the cave were found\r\nremains of the ox, young elephant, rhinoceros, horse, bear, wolf, hare,\r\nwater-rat, and several birds. All the bones present an appearance of\r\nhaving been broken and gnawed by the teeth of the Hyænas, and they occur\r\nconfusedly mixed in loam or mud, or dispersed through the crust of\r\nstalagmite which covered the contents of the cave.\r\n\r\nThe Horse dates from the Quaternary epoch, if not from the last period\r\nof the Tertiary epoch. Its remains are found in the same rocks with\r\nthose of the Mammoth and the Rhinoceros. It is distinguished from our\r\nexisting Horse only by its size, which was smaller--its remains abound\r\nin the Post-pliocene rocks, not only in Europe, but in America; so that\r\nan aboriginal Horse existed in the New World long before it was carried\r\nthither by the Spaniards, although we know that it was unknown at the\r\ndate of their arrival. “Certainly it is a marvellous fact in the history\r\nof the Mammalia, that in South America, a native horse should have lived\r\nand disappeared, to be succeeded in after ages by the countless herds\r\ndescended from the few introduced with the Spanish colonists!”[99]\r\n\r\n  [99] “Darwin’s Journal,” p. 130.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 184.--Head of Hyæna spelæa.]\r\n\r\nThe Oxen of the period, if not identical with, were at least very near\r\nto our living species. There were three species: the _Bison priscus_,\r\n_B. primigenius_, and _B. Pallasii_; the first with slender legs, with\r\nconvex frontal, broader than it was high, and differing but slightly\r\nfrom the _Aurochs_, except in being taller and by having larger horns.\r\nThe remains of _Bison priscus_ are found in England, France, Italy,\r\nGermany, Russia, and America. _Bison primigenius_ was, according to\r\nCuvier, the source of our domestic cattle. The _Bos Pallasii_ is found\r\nin America and in Siberia, and resembles in many respects the Musk-ox of\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nWhere these great Mammals are found we generally discover the fossil\r\nremains of several species of Deer. The palæontological question as\r\nregards these animals is very obscure, and it is often difficult to\r\ndetermine whether the remains belong to an extinct or an existing\r\nspecies. This doubt does not extend, however, to the gigantic\r\nforest-stag, _Cervus megaceros_, one of the most magnificent of the\r\nantediluvian animals, whose remains are still frequently found in\r\nIreland in the neighbourhood of Dublin; more rarely in France, Germany,\r\nPoland, and Italy. Intermediate between the Fallow-deer and the Elk, the\r\n_Cervus megaceros_ partakes of the Elk in its general proportions and in\r\nthe form of its cranium, but it approaches the Fallow-deer in its size\r\nand in the disposition of its horns. These magnificent appendages,\r\nhowever, while they decorated the head of the animal and gave a most\r\nimposing appearance to it, must have sadly impeded its progress through\r\nthe thick and tangled forests of the ancient world. The length of these\r\nhorns was between nine and ten feet; and they were so divergent that,\r\nmeasured from one extremity to the other, they occupied a space of\r\nbetween three and four yards.\r\n\r\nThe skeleton of the _Cervus megaceros_ is found in the deposits of\r\ncalcareous tufa, which underlie the immense peat moss of Ireland;\r\nsometimes in the turf itself, as near the Curragh in Kildare; in which\r\nposition they sometimes occur in little mounds piled up in a small\r\nspace, and nearly always in the same attitude, the head aloft, the neck\r\nstretched out, the horns reversed and thrown downwards towards the back,\r\nas if the animal, suddenly immersed into marshy ground, had been under\r\nthe necessity of throwing up its head in search of respirable air. In\r\nthe Geological Cabinet of the Sorbonne, at Paris, there is a magnificent\r\nskeleton of _Cervus megaceros_; another belongs to the College of\r\nSurgeons in London; and there is a third at Vienna.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable creatures of the period, however, were the great\r\nEdentates--the Glyptodon, the gigantic Megatherium, the Mylodon and the\r\nMegalonyx. The order of Edentates is more particularly characterised by\r\nthe absence of teeth in the fore part of the mouth. The masticating\r\napparatus of the Edentates consists only of molars, the incisors and\r\ncanine teeth being, with a few exceptions, absent altogether, as the\r\nanimals composing this order feed chiefly on insects or the tender\r\nleaves of plants. The Armadillo, Anteater and Pangolin, are the living\r\nexamples of the order. We may add, as still further characteristics,\r\nlargely developed claws at the extremities of the toes. The order seems\r\nthus to establish itself as a zoological link in the chain between the\r\nhoofed Mammals and the ungulated animals, or those armed with claws.\r\nAll these animals are peculiar to the continent of America.\r\n\r\nThe _Glyptodon_, which appears during the Quaternary period, belonged to\r\nthe family of Armadilloes, and their most remarkable feature was the\r\npresence of a hard, scaly shell, or coat of mail six feet in length, and\r\ncomposed of numerous segments, which covered the entire upper service of\r\nthe animal from the head to the tail. It was, in short, a mammiferous\r\nanimal, which appears to have been enclosed in a shell like that of a\r\nTurtle; it resembled in many respects the _Dasypus_ or Anteater, and had\r\nsixteen teeth in each jaw. These teeth were channelled laterally with\r\ntwo broad and deep grooves, which divided the surface of the molars into\r\nthree parts, whence it was named the Glyptodon. The hind feet were broad\r\nand massive, and evidently designed to support a vast incumbent mass; it\r\npresented phalanges armed with short thick and depressed nails or claws.\r\nThe animal was, as we have said, enveloped in, and protected by, a\r\ncuirass, or solid carapace, composed of plates which, seen from beneath,\r\nappeared to be hexagonal and united by denticulated sutures: above they\r\nrepresented double rosettes. The habitat of _Glyptodon clavipes_ was the\r\npampas of Buenos Ayres, and the banks of an affluent of the Rio Santo,\r\nnear Monte Video; specimens have been found not less than nine feet in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nThe tesselated carapace of the Glyptodon was long thought to belong to\r\nthe Megatherium; but Professor Owen shows, from the anatomical structure\r\nof the two animals, that the cuirass belonged to one of them only,\r\nnamely, the Glyptodon.\r\n\r\nThe _Schistopleuron_ does not differ essentially from the Glyptodon, but\r\nis supposed to have been a different species of the same genus; the\r\nchief difference between the two animals being in the structure of the\r\ntail, which is massive in the first and in the other composed of half a\r\nscore of rings. In other respects the organisation and habits are\r\nsimilar, both being herbivorous, and feeding on roots and vegetables.\r\nFig. 185 represents the _Schistopleuron typus_ restored, and as it\r\nappeared when alive.\r\n\r\nSome of the fossil Tortoises discovered in the sub-Himalayan beds\r\npossessed a carapace twelve feet long by six feet in breadth, which must\r\nhave corresponded to an animal from eighteen to twenty feet in length;\r\nand the bones of the legs were as massive as those of the Rhinoceros.\r\n\r\nThe _Megatherium_, or Animal of Paraguay, as it was called, is, at first\r\nview, the oddest and most remarkable animal we have yet had under\r\nconsideration, where all have been, according to our notions, strange,\r\nextraordinary, and formidable. The animal creation still goes on as if--\r\n\r\n    “Nature made them and then broke the die.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 185.--Schistopleuron typus. One-twentieth natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXVII.--Skeleton of the Megatherium (Clift).]\r\n\r\nIf we cast a glance at the skeleton figured on the opposite page (PLATE\r\nXXVII.), which was found in Paraguay, at Buenos Ayres, in 1788, and\r\nwhich is now placed, in a perfect state of preservation, in the Museum\r\nof Natural History in Madrid, it is impossible to avoid being struck\r\nwith its unusually heavy form, at once awkward as a whole, and ponderous\r\nin most of its parts. It is allied to the existing genus of Sloths,\r\nwhich Buffon tells us is “of all the animal creation that which has\r\nreceived the most vicious organisation--a being to which Nature has\r\nforbidden all enjoyment; which has only been created for hardships and\r\nmisery.” This notion of the romantic Buffon is, however, altogether\r\nincorrect. An attentive examination of the _Animal of_ _Paraguay_\r\nshows that its organisation cannot be considered either odd or awkward\r\nwhen viewed in connection with its mode of life and individual habits.\r\nThe special organisation which renders the movements of the Sloths so\r\nsluggish, and apparently so painful on level ground, gives them, on the\r\nother hand, marvellous assistance when they live in trees, the leaves of\r\nwhich constitute their exclusive food. In the same manner, if we\r\nconsider that the _Megatherium_ was created to burrow in the earth and\r\nfeed upon the roots of trees and shrubs, every organ of its heavy frame\r\nwould appear to be perfectly appropriate to its kind of life, and well\r\nadapted to the special purpose which was assigned to it by the Creator.\r\nWe ought to place the Megatherium between the Sloths and the Anteaters.\r\nLike the first, it usually fed on the branches and leaves of trees; like\r\nthe latter, it burrowed deep in the soil, finding there both food and\r\nshelter. It was as large as an Elephant or Rhinoceros of the largest\r\nspecies. Its body measured twelve or thirteen feet in length, and it was\r\nbetween five and six feet high. The engraving on page 403 (PLATE XXVII.)\r\nwill convey, more accurately than any mere verbal description, an idea\r\nof the form and proportions of the animal.\r\n\r\nThe English reader is chiefly indebted to the zeal and energy of Sir\r\nWoodbine Parish for the materials from which our naturalists have been\r\nenabled to re-construct the history of the Megatherium. The remains\r\ncollected by him were found in the river Salado, which runs through the\r\nflat alluvial plains called Pampas to the south of the city of Buenos\r\nAyres. A succession of three unusually dry seasons had lowered the\r\nwaters to such a degree as to expose part of the pelvis to view, as the\r\nskeleton stood upright in the mud forming the bed of the river. Further\r\ninquiries led to the discovery of the remains of two other skeletons\r\nnear the place where the first had been found; and with them an immense\r\nshell or carapace was met with, most of the bones associated with which\r\ncrumbled to pieces on exposure to the air. The osseous structure of this\r\nenormous animal, as furnished by Mr. Clift, an eminent anatomist of the\r\nday, and under whose superintendence the skeleton was drawn, must have\r\nexceeded fourteen feet in length, and upwards of eight feet in height.\r\nThe deeply shaded parts of the figure show the portions which are\r\ndeficient in the Madrid skeleton.\r\n\r\nCuvier pointed out that the skull very much resembled that of the\r\nSloths, but that the rest of the skeleton bore relationship, partly to\r\nthe Sloths, and partly to the Anteaters.\r\n\r\nThe large bones, which descend from the zygomatic arch along the\r\ncheek-bones, would furnish a powerful means of attaching the motor\r\nmuscles of the jaws. The anterior part of the muzzle is fully developed,\r\nand riddled with holes for the passage of the nerves and vessels which\r\nmust have been there, not for a trunk, which would have been useless to\r\nan animal furnished with a very long neck, but for a snout analogous to\r\nthat of the Tapir.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 186.--Skeleton of Megatherium foreshortened.]\r\n\r\nThe jaw and dental apparatus cannot be exactly stated, because the\r\nnumber of teeth in the lower jaw is not known. The upper jaw, Professor\r\nOwen has shown, contained five molars on each side; and from comparison\r\nand analogy with the _Scelidotherium_ it may be conjectured that the\r\n_Megatherium_ had four on each side of the lower jaw. Being without\r\nincisors or canines, the structure of its eighteen molars proves that it\r\nwas not carnivorous: they each resemble the composite molars of the\r\nElephant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 187.--Bones of the pelvis of the Megatherium.]\r\n\r\nThe vertebræ of the neck (as exhibited in the foreshortened figure (Fig.\r\n186), taken from the work of Pander and D’Alton, and showing nearly a\r\nfront view of the head), as well as the anterior and posterior\r\nextremities of the Madrid skeleton, although powerful, are not to be\r\ncompared in dimensions to those of the other extremity of the body; for\r\nthe head seems to have been relatively light and defenceless. The lumbar\r\nvertebræ increase in a degree corresponding to the enormous enlargement\r\nof the pelvis and the posterior members. The vertebræ of the tail are\r\nenormous, as is seen in Fig. 187, which represents the bones of the\r\npelvis and hind foot, discovered by Sir Woodbine Parish, and now in the\r\nMuseum of the College of Surgeons. If we add to these osseous organs the\r\nmuscles, tendons, and integuments which covered them, we must admit that\r\nthe tail of the _Megatherium_ could not be less than two feet in\r\ndiameter. It is probable that, like the Armadillo, it employed the tail\r\nto assist in supporting the enormous weight of its body; it would also\r\nbe a formidable defensive organ when employed, as is the case with the\r\nPangolins and Crocodiles. The fore-feet would be about three feet long\r\nand one foot broad. They would form a powerful implement for excavating\r\nthe earth, to the greatest depths at which the roots of vegetables\r\npenetrate. The fore-feet rested on the ground to their full length. Thus\r\nsolidly supported by the two hind-feet and the tail, and in advance by\r\none of the fore-feet, the animal could employ the fore-foot left at\r\nliberty in clearing away the earth, in digging up the roots of trees, or\r\nin tearing down the branches; the toes of the fore-feet were, for this\r\npurpose, furnished with large and powerful claws, which lie at an\r\noblique angle relatively to the ground, much like the burrowing talons\r\nof the mole.\r\n\r\nThe solidity and size of the pelvis must have been enormous; its immense\r\niliac bones are nearly at right angles with the vertebral column; their\r\nexternal edges are distant more than a yard and a half from each other\r\nwhen the animal is standing. The femur is three times the thickness of\r\nthe thigh-bone of the Elephant, and the many peculiarities of structure\r\nin this bone appear to have been intended to give solidity to the whole\r\nframe, by means of its short and massive proportions. The two bones of\r\nthe leg are, like the femur, short, thick, and solid; presenting\r\nproportions which we only meet with in the Armadilloes and Anteaters;\r\nburrowing animals with which, as we have said, its two extremities seem\r\nto connect it.\r\n\r\nThe anatomical organisation of these members denotes heavy, slow, and\r\npowerful locomotion, but solid and admirable combinations for supporting\r\nthe weight of an enormous sedentary creature; a sort of excavating\r\nmachine, slow of motion but of incalculable power for its own purposes.\r\nIn short, the _Megatherium_ exceeded in dimensions all existing\r\nEdentates. It had the head and shoulders of the Sloth, the feet and legs\r\ncombined the characteristics of the Anteaters and Sloths, of enormous\r\nsize, since it was at least twelve feet long when full grown, its feet\r\narmed with gigantic claws, and its tail at once a means of supporting\r\nits huge body and an instrument of defence. An animal built with such\r\nmassive proportions could evidently neither creep nor run; its walk\r\nwould be excessively slow. But what necessity was there for rapid\r\nmovement in a being only occupied in burrowing under the earth, seeking\r\nfor roots, and which would consequently rarely change its place? What\r\nneed had it of agility to fly from its enemies, when it could overthrow\r\nthe Crocodile with a sweep of its tail? Secure from the attacks of other\r\nanimals, this robust herbivorous creature, of which Figure 188 is a\r\nrestoration, must have lived peacefully and respected in the solitary\r\npampas of America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 188.--Megatherium restored.]\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause of the extinction of the Megatherium is, probably,\r\nto be found in causes which are still in operation in South America. The\r\nperiod between the years 1827 and 1830 is called the “gran seco,” or\r\nthe great drought, in South America; and according to Darwin, the loss\r\nof cattle in the province of Buenos Ayres alone was calculated at\r\n1,000,000 head. One proprietor at San Pedro, in the middle of the finest\r\npasture-country, had lost 20,000 cattle previously to those years. “I\r\nwas informed by an eyewitness,” he adds, “that the cattle, in herds of\r\nthousands, rushed into the Parana, and, being exhausted by hunger, they\r\nwere unable to crawl up the muddy banks, and thus were drowned. The arm\r\nof the river which runs by San Pedro was so full of putrid carcases,\r\nthat the master of a vessel told me that the smell rendered it quite\r\nimpassable. All the small rivers became highly saline, and this caused\r\nthe death of vast numbers in particular spots; for when an animal drinks\r\nof such water it does not recover. Azara describes the fury of the wild\r\nhorses on a similar occasion: rushing into the marshes, those which\r\narrived first being overwhelmed and crushed by those which\r\nfollowed.”[100] The upright position in which the various specimens of\r\nMegatheria were found indicates some such cause of death; as if the\r\nponderous animal, approaching the banks of the river, when shrunk within\r\nits banks, had been bogged in soft mud, sufficiently adhesive to hold it\r\nthere till it perished.\r\n\r\n  [100] “Journal of Researches,” &c., 2nd ed., p. 133. Charles Darwin.\r\n\r\nLike the Megatherium, the _Mylodon_ closely resembled the Sloth, and it\r\nbelonged exclusively to the New World. Smaller than the Megatherium, it\r\ndiffered from it chiefly in the form of the teeth. These organs\r\npresented only molars with smooth surfaces, indicating that the animal\r\nfed on vegetables, probably the leaves and tender buds of trees. As the\r\nMylodon presents at once hoofs and claws on each foot, it has been\r\nthought that it formed the link between the hoofed, or ungulated animals\r\nand the Edentates. Three species are known, which lived in the pampas of\r\nBuenos Ayres.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of some hints given by the illustrious Washington, Mr.\r\nJefferson, one of his successors as President of the United States,\r\ndiscovered, in a cavern of Western Virginia, the bones of a species of\r\ngigantic Sloth, which he pronounced to be the remains of some\r\ncarnivorous animal. They consisted of a femur, a humerus, an ulna, and\r\nthree claws, with half a dozen other bones of the foot. These bones Mr.\r\nJefferson believed to be analogous to those of the lion. Cuvier saw at\r\nonce the true analogies of the animal. The bones were the remains of a\r\nspecies of gigantic Sloth; the complete skeleton of which was\r\nsubsequently discovered in the Mississippi, in such a perfect state of\r\npreservation that the cartilages, still adhering to the bones, were not\r\ndecomposed. Jefferson called this species the _Megalonyx_. It resembled\r\nin many respects the Sloth. Its size was that of the largest ox; the\r\nmuzzle was pointed; the jaws were armed with cylindrical teeth; the\r\nanterior limbs much longer than the posterior; the articulation of the\r\nfoot oblique to the leg; two great toes, short, and armed with long and\r\nvery powerful claws; the index finger more slender, and armed also with\r\na less powerful claw; the tail strong and solid: such were the salient\r\npoints of the organisation of the _Megalonyx_, whose form was a little\r\nslighter than that of the _Megatherium_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 189.--Mylodon robustus.]\r\n\r\nThe country in which the Megatherium has been found is described by Mr.\r\nDarwin as belonging to the great Pampean formation, which consists\r\npartly of a reddish clay and in part of a highly calcareous marly rock.\r\nNear the coast there are some plains formed from the wreck of the upper\r\nplain, and from mud, gravel, and sand thrown up by the sea during the\r\nslow elevation of the land, as shown by the raised beds of recent\r\nshells. At Punta Alta there is a highly-interesting section of one of\r\nthe later-formed little plains, in which many remains of these gigantic\r\nland-animals have been found. These were, says Mr. Darwin:--“First,\r\nparts of three heads and other bones of the Megatherium, the huge\r\ndimensions of which are expressed by its name. Secondly, the\r\n_Megalonyx_, a great allied animal. Thirdly, the _Scelidotherium_, also\r\nan allied animal, of which I obtained a nearly perfect skeleton: it must\r\nhave been as large as a rhinoceros; in the structure of its head it\r\ncomes, according to Professor Owen, nearest to the Cape Anteater, but in\r\nsome other respects it approaches to the Armadilloes. Fourthly, the\r\n_Mylodon Darwinii_, a closely related genus, of little inferior size.\r\nFifthly, another gigantic edental quadruped. Sixthly, a large animal\r\nwith an osseous coat, in compartments, very like that of an armadillo.\r\nSeventhly, an extinct kind of horse. Eighthly, a tooth of a\r\npachydermatous animal, probably the same with the Macrauchenia, a huge\r\nbeast with a long neck like a camel. Lastly, the Toxodon, perhaps one of\r\nthe strangest animals ever discovered; in size it equalled an Elephant\r\nor Megatherium, but the structure of its teeth, as Professor Owen\r\nstates, proves indisputably that it was intimately related to the\r\nGnawers, the order which, at the present day, includes most of the\r\nsmallest quadrupeds; in many details it is allied to the pachydermata;\r\njudging from the position of its eyes, ears, and nostrils, it was\r\nprobably aquatic, like the Dugong and Manatee, to which it is allied.\r\nHow wonderfully are the different orders--at the present time so well\r\nseparated--blended together in different points in the structure of the\r\nToxodon!”[101]\r\n\r\n  [101] “Journal of Researches,” &c., by Charles Darwin, p. 81.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 190.--Lower jaw of the Mylodon.]\r\n\r\nThe remains on which our knowledge of the _Scelidotherium_ is founded\r\ninclude the cranium, which is nearly entire, with the teeth and part of\r\nthe os hyoides, seven cervical, eight dorsal, and five sacral vertebræ,\r\nboth the scapulæ, and some other bones. The remains of the cranium\r\nindicate that its general form was an elongated slender compressed cone,\r\nbeginning behind by a flattened vertical base, expanding slightly to the\r\ncheek-bone, and thence contracting to the anterior extremity. All these\r\nparts were discovered in their natural relative positions, indicating,\r\nas Mr. Darwin observes, that the gravelly formation in which they were\r\ndiscovered had not been disturbed since its deposition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 191.--Skull of Scelidotherium.]\r\n\r\nThe lower jaw-bone of _Mylodon_, which Mr. Darwin discovered at the base\r\nof the cliff called Punta Alta, in Northern Patagonia, had the teeth\r\nentire on both sides; they are implanted in deep sockets, and only about\r\none-sixth of the last molar projects above the alveolus, but the\r\nproportion of the exposed part increases gradually in the inner teeth\r\n(Fig. 191).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 192.--Dinornis, and Bos.]\r\n\r\n“The habits of life of these Megatheroid animals were a complete puzzle\r\nto naturalists, until Professor Owen solved the problem with remarkable\r\ningenuity. The teeth indicate, by their simple structure, that these\r\nMegatheroid animals lived on vegetable food, and probably on the leaves\r\nand small twigs of trees; their ponderous forms and great strong curved\r\nclaws seem so little adapted for locomotion, that some eminent\r\nnaturalists have actually believed that, like the Sloths, to which they\r\nare intimately related, they subsisted by climbing back downwards, on\r\ntrees, and feeding on the leaves. It was a bold, not to say preposterous\r\nidea to conceive even antediluvian trees with branches strong enough to\r\nbear animals as large as elephants. Professor Owen, with far more\r\nprobability, believes that, instead of climbing on the trees, they\r\npulled the branches down to them, and tore up the smaller ones by the\r\nroots, and so fed on the leaves. The colossal breadth and weight of\r\ntheir hinder quarters, which can hardly be imagined without having been\r\nseen, become, on this view, of obvious service instead of being an\r\nencumbrance; their apparent clumsiness disappears. With their great\r\ntails and their huge heels firmly fixed like a tripod in the ground,\r\nthey could freely exert the full force of their most powerful arms and\r\ngreat claws. The _Mylodon_, moreover, was furnished with a long\r\nextensile tongue, like that of the giraffe, which by one of those\r\nbeautiful provisions of Nature, thus reaches, with the aid of its long\r\nneck, its leafy food.”[102]\r\n\r\n  [102] “Journal of Researches,” &c., by Charles Darwin, 2nd ed., p. 81.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXVIII.--Ideal European Landscape in the Quaternary\r\nEpoch.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo gigantic birds seem to have lived in New Zealand during the\r\nQuaternary epoch. The _Dinornis_, which, if we may judge from the\r\n_tibia_, which is upwards of three feet long, and from its eggs, which\r\nare much larger than those of the Ostrich, must have been of most\r\nextraordinary size for a bird. In Fig. 192 an attempt is made to restore\r\nthis fearfully great bird, the _Dinornis_. As to the _Epiornis_, its\r\neggs only have been found.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite page (PLATE XXVIII.) an attempt is made to represent the\r\nappearance of Europe during the epoch we have under consideration. The\r\nBear is seated at the mouth of its den--the cave (thus reminding us of\r\nthe origin of its name of _Ursus spelæus_), where it gnaws the bones of\r\nthe Elephant. Above the cavern the _Hyæna spelæa_ looks out, with savage\r\neye, for the moment when it will be prudent to dispute possession of\r\nthese remains with its formidable rival. The great Wood-stag, with other\r\ngreat animals of the epoch, occupies the farthest shore of a small lake,\r\nwhere some small hills rise out of a valley crowned with the trees and\r\nshrubs of the period. Mountains, recently upheaved, rise on the distant\r\nhorizon, covered with a mantle of frozen snow, reminding us that the\r\nglacial period is approaching, and has already begun to manifest itself.\r\n\r\nAll these fossil bones, belonging to the great Mammalia which we have\r\nbeen describing, are found in the Quaternary formation; but the most\r\nabundant of all are those of the Elephant and the Horse. The extreme\r\nprofusion of the bones of the Mammoth, crowded into the more recently\r\nformed deposits of the globe, is only surpassed by the prodigious\r\nquantity of the bones of the Horse which are buried in the same beds.\r\nThe singular abundance of the remains of these two animals proves that,\r\nduring the Quaternary epoch, the earth gave nourishment to immense herds\r\nof the Horse and the Elephant. It is probable that from one pole to the\r\nother, from the equator to the two extremities of the axis of the globe,\r\nthe earth must have formed a vast and boundless prairie, while an\r\nimmense carpet of verdure covered its whole surface; and such abundant\r\npastures would be absolutely necessary to sustain these prodigious\r\nnumbers of herbivorous animals of great size.\r\n\r\nThe mind can scarcely realise the immense and verdant plains of this\r\nearlier world, animated by the presence of an infinity of such\r\ninhabitants. In its burning temperature, Pachyderms of monstrous forms,\r\nbut of peaceful habits, traversed the tall vegetation, composed of\r\ngrasses of all sorts. Deer of gigantic size, their heads ornamented with\r\nenormous horns, escorted the heavy herds of the Mammoth; while the\r\nHorse, small in size and compact of form, galloped and frisked round\r\nthese magnificent horizons of verdure which no human eye had yet\r\ncontemplated.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, all was not quiet and tranquil in the landscapes of the\r\nancient world. Voracious and formidable carnivorous animals waged a\r\nbloody war on the inoffensive herds. The Tiger, the Lion, and the\r\nferocious Hyæna; the Bear, and the Jackal, there selected their prey. On\r\nthe opposite page an endeavour is made to represent the great animals\r\namong the Edentates which inhabited the American plains during the\r\nQuaternary epoch (PLATE XXIX). We observe there the Glyptodon, the\r\nMegatherium, the Mylodon, and, along with them, the Mastodon. A small\r\nApe (the Orthopithecus), which first appeared in the Miocene period,\r\noccupies the branch of a tree in the landscape. The vegetation is that\r\nof tropical America at the present time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe deposits of this age, which are of later date than the Crag, and of\r\nearlier date than the Boulder Clay, with its fragments of rocks\r\nfrequently transported from great distances, are classed under the term\r\n“pre-glacial.”\r\n\r\nAfter the deposition of the Forest Bed, which is seen overlying the Crag\r\nfor miles between high and low-water mark, on the shore west of Cromer,\r\nin Norfolk, there was a general reduction of temperature, and a period\r\nof intense cold, known as the “glacial period,” seems to have set in,\r\nduring which a great part of what is now the British Islands was covered\r\nwith a thick coating of ice, and probably united with the Continent.\r\n\r\nAt this time England south of the Bristol Channel (the estuary of the\r\nSevern), and the Thames, appears to have been above water. The northern\r\npart of the country, and the high-ground generally of Britain and\r\nIreland were covered with gliding glaciers, by whose grinding action the\r\nwhole surface became moulded and worn into its present shape, while the\r\nfloating icebergs which broke off at the sea-side from these glaciers,\r\nconveyed away and dropped on the bed of the sea those fragments of rocks\r\nand the gravel and other earthy materials which are now generally\r\nrecognised as glacial accumulations.\r\n\r\nIn all directions, however, proofs are being gradually obtained that,\r\nabout this period, movements of submersion under the sea were in\r\nprogress, all north of the Thames.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXIX.--Ideal American Landscape in the Quaternary\r\nEpoch.]\r\n\r\nRamsay points out indications, first of an intensely cold period, when\r\nland was much more elevated than it is now; then of submergence beneath\r\nthe sea; and, lastly, re-elevation attended by glacial action. “When we\r\nspeak of the vegetation and quadrupeds of Cromer Forest being\r\npre-glacial,” says Lyell, “we merely mean that their formation preceded\r\nthe era of the general submergence of the British Isles beneath the\r\nwaters of the glacial sea. The successive deposits seen in direct\r\nsuperposition on the Norfolk coast,” adds Sir Charles, “imply at first\r\nthe prevalence over a wide area of the Newer Pliocene Sea. Afterwards,\r\nthe bed of the sea was converted into dry land, and underwent several\r\noscillations of level, so as to be, first, dry land supporting a forest;\r\nthen an estuary; then again land; and, finally, a sea near the mouth of\r\na river, till the downward movement became so great as to convert the\r\nwhole area into a sea of considerable depth, in which much floating ice,\r\ncarrying mud, sand, and boulders melted, letting its burthen fall to the\r\nbottom. Finally, over the till with boulders stratified drift was\r\nformed; after which, but not until the total subsidence amounted to more\r\nthan 400 feet, an upward movement began, which re-elevated the whole\r\ncountry, so that the lowest of the terrestrial formations, or the forest\r\nbed, was brought up to nearly its pristine level, in such a manner as to\r\nbe exposed at a low tide. Both the descending and ascending movement\r\nseem to have been very gradual.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 193.--Palæophognos Gesneri. Fossil Toad.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEUROPEAN DELUGES.\r\n\r\nThe Tertiary formations, in many parts of Europe, of more or less\r\nextent, are covered by an accumulation of heterogeneous deposits,\r\nfilling up the valleys, and composed of very various materials,\r\nconsisting mostly of fragments of the neighbouring rocks. The erosions\r\nwhich we remark at the bottoms of the hills, and which have greatly\r\nenlarged already existing valleys; the mounds of gravel accumulated at\r\none point, and which is formed of rolled materials, that is to say, of\r\nfragments of rocks worn smooth and round by continual friction during a\r\nlong period, in which they have been transported from one point to\r\nanother--all these signs indicate that these denudations of the soil,\r\nthese displacements and transport of very heavy bodies to great\r\ndistances, are due to the violent and sudden action of large currents of\r\nwater. An immense wave has been thrown suddenly on the surface of the\r\nearth, making great ravages in its passage, furrowing the earth and\r\ndriving before it débris of all sorts in its disorderly course.\r\nGeologists give the name of _diluvium_ to a formation thus removed and\r\nscattered, which, from its heterogeneous nature, brings under our eyes,\r\nas it were, the rapid passage of an impetuous torrent--a phenomenon\r\nwhich is commonly designated as a _deluge_.\r\n\r\nTo what cause are we to attribute these sudden and apparently temporary\r\ninvasions of the earth’s surface by rapid currents of water? In all\r\nprobability to the upheaval of some vast extent of dry land, to the\r\nformation of some mountain or mountain-range in the neighbourhood of the\r\nsea, or even in the bed of the sea itself. The land suddenly elevated by\r\nan upward movement of the terrestrial crust, or by the formation of\r\nridges and furrows at the surface, has, by its reaction, violently\r\nagitated the waters, that is to say, the more mobile portion of the\r\nglobe. By this new impulse the waters have been thrown with great\r\nviolence over the earth, inundating the plains and valleys, and for the\r\nmoment covering the soil with their furious waves, mingled with the\r\nearth, sand, and mud, of which the devastated districts have been\r\ndenuded by their abrupt invasion. The phenomenon has been sudden but\r\nbrief, like the upheaval of the mountain or chain of mountains, which is\r\npresumed to have been the cause of it; but it was often repeated:\r\nwitness the valleys which occur in every country, especially those in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Lyons and of the Durance. These strata indicate as\r\nmany successive deposits. Besides this, the displacement of blocks of\r\nminerals from their normal position is proof, now perfectly\r\nrecognisable, of this great phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThere have been, doubtless, during the epochs anterior to the Quaternary\r\nperiod of which we write, many deluges such as we are considering.\r\nMountains and chains of mountains, through all the ages we have been\r\ndescribing, were formed by upheaval of the crust into ridges, where it\r\nwas too elastic or too thick to be fractured. Each of these subterranean\r\ncommotions would be provocative of momentary irruptions of the waves.\r\n\r\nBut the visible testimony to this phenomenon--the living proofs of this\r\ndenudation, of this tearing away of the soil, are found nowhere so\r\nstrikingly as in the beds superimposed, far and near, upon the Tertiary\r\nformations, and which bear the geological name of _diluvium_. This term\r\nwas long employed to designate what is now better known as the “boulder”\r\nformation, a glacial deposit which is abundant in Europe north of the\r\n50th, and in America north of the 40th, parallel, and re-appearing again\r\nin the southern hemisphere; but altogether absent in tropical regions.\r\nIt consists of sand and clay, sometimes stratified, mixed with rounded\r\nand angular fragments of rock, generally derived from the same district;\r\nand their origin has generally been ascribed to a series of diluvial\r\nwaves raised by hurricanes, earthquakes, or the sudden upheaval of land\r\nfrom the bed of the sea, which had swept over continents, carrying with\r\nthem vast masses of mud and heavy stones, and forcing these stones over\r\nrocky surfaces so as to polish and impress them with furrows and striæ.\r\nOther circumstances occurred, however, to establish a connection between\r\nthis formation and the glacial drift. The size and number of the erratic\r\nblocks increase as we travel towards the Arctic regions; some intimate\r\nassociation exists, therefore, between this formation and the\r\naccumulations of ice and snow which characterise the approaching glacial\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nAs we have already stated at the beginning of this chapter, there is\r\nvery distinct evidence of two successive deluges in our hemisphere\r\nduring the Quaternary epoch. The two may be distinguished as the\r\n_European Deluge_ and the _Asiatic_. The two European deluges occurred\r\nprior to the appearance of man; the Asiatic deluge happened after that\r\nevent; and the human race, then in the early days of its existence,\r\ncertainly suffered from this cataclysm. In the present chapter we\r\nconfine ourselves to the two cataclysms which overwhelmed Europe in the\r\nQuaternary epoch.\r\n\r\nThe first occurred in the north of Europe, where it was produced by the\r\nupheaval of the mountains of Norway. Commencing in Scandinavia, the wave\r\nspread and carried its ravages into those regions which now constitute\r\nSweden, Norway, European Russia, and the north of Germany, sweeping\r\nbefore it all the loose soil on the surface, and covering the whole of\r\nScandinavia--all the plains and valleys of Northern Europe--with a\r\nmantle of transported soil. As the regions in the midst of which this\r\ngreat mountainous upheaval occurred--as the seas surrounding these vast\r\nspaces were partly frozen and covered with ice, from their elevation and\r\nneighbourhood to the pole--the wave which swept these countries carried\r\nalong with it enormous masses of ice. The shock, produced by the\r\ncollision of these several solid blocks of frozen water, would only\r\ncontribute to increase the extent and intensity of the ravages\r\noccasioned by this violent cataclysm, which is represented in PLATE XXX.\r\n\r\nThe physical proof of this _deluge of the north of Europe_ exists in the\r\naccumulation of unstratified deposits which covers all the plains and\r\nlow grounds of Northern Europe. On and in this deposit are found\r\nnumerous blocks which have received the characteristic and significant\r\nname of erratic blocks, and which are frequently of considerable size.\r\nThese become more characteristic as we ascend to higher latitudes, as in\r\nNorway, Sweden, and Denmark, the southern borders of the Baltic, and in\r\nthe British Islands generally, in all of which countries deposits of\r\nmarine fossil shells occur, which prove the submergence of large areas\r\nof Scandinavia, of the British Isles, and other regions during parts of\r\nthe glacial period. Some of these rocks, characterised as _erratic_, are\r\nof very considerable volume; such, for instance, is the granite block\r\nwhich forms the pedestal of the statue of Peter the Great at St.\r\nPetersburg. This block was found in the interior of Russia, where the\r\nwhole formation is _Permian_, and its presence there can only be\r\nexplained by supposing it to have been transported by some vast iceberg,\r\ncarried by a diluvial current. This hypothesis alone enables us to\r\naccount for another block of granite, weighing about 340 tons, which was\r\nfound on the sandy plains in the north of Prussia, an immense model of\r\nwhich was made for the Berlin Museum. The last of these erratic blocks\r\ndeposited in Germany covers the grave of King Gustavus Adolphus, of\r\nSweden, killed at the battle of Lutzen, in 1632. He was interred beneath\r\nthe rock. Another similar block has been raised in Germany into a\r\nmonument to the geologist Leopold von Buch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXX.--Deluge of the North of Europe.]\r\n\r\nThese erratic blocks which are met with in the plains of Russia, Poland,\r\nand Prussia, and in the eastern parts of England, are composed of rocks\r\nentirely foreign to the region where they are found. They belong to the\r\nprimary rocks of Norway; they have been transported to their present\r\nsites, protected by a covering of ice, by the waters of the northern\r\ndeluge. How vast must have been the impulsive force which could carry\r\nsuch enormous masses across the Baltic, and so far inland as the places\r\nwhere they have been deposited for the surprise of the geologist or the\r\ncontemplation of the thoughtful!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe second European deluge is supposed to have been the result of the\r\nformation and upheaval of the Alps. It has filled with débris and\r\ntransported material the valleys of France, Germany, and Italy over a\r\ncircumference which has the Alps for its centre. The proofs of a great\r\nconvulsion at a comparatively recent geological date are numerous. The\r\nAlps may be from eighty to 100 miles across, and the probabilities are\r\nthat their existence is due, as Sir Charles Lyell supposes, to a\r\nsuccession of unequal movements of upheaval and subsidence; that the\r\nAlpine region had been exposed for countless ages to the action of rain\r\nand rivers, and that the larger valleys were of pre-glacial times, is\r\nhighly probable. In the eastern part of the chain some of the Primary\r\nfossiliferous rocks, as well as Oolitic and Cretaceous rocks, and even\r\nTertiary deposits, are observable; but in the central Alps these\r\ndisappear, and more recent rocks, in some places even Eocene strata,\r\ngraduate into metamorphic rocks, in which Oolitic, Cretaceous, and\r\nEocene strata have been altered into granular marble, gneiss, and other\r\nmetamorphic schists; showing that eruptions continued after the deposit\r\nof the Middle Eocene formations. Again, in the Swiss and Savoy Alps,\r\nOolitic and Cretaceous formations have been elevated to the height of\r\n12,000 feet, and Eocene strata 10,000 feet above the level of the sea;\r\nwhile in the Rothal, in the Bernese Alps, occurs a mass of gneiss 1,000\r\nfeet thick between two strata containing Oolitic fossils.\r\n\r\nBesides these proofs of recent upheaval, we can trace effects of two\r\ndifferent kinds, resulting from the powerful action of masses of water\r\nviolently displaced by this gigantic upheaval. At first broad tracks\r\nhave been hollowed out by the diluvial waves, which have, at these\r\npoints, formed deep valleys. Afterwards these valleys have been filled\r\nup by materials derived from the mountain and transported into the\r\nvalley, these materials consisting of rounded pebbles, argillaceous and\r\nsandy mud, generally calcareous and ferriferous. This double effect is\r\nexhibited, with more or less distinctness, in all the great valleys of\r\nthe centre and south of France. The valley of the Garonne is, in respect\r\nto these phenomena, classic ground, as it were.\r\n\r\nAs we leave the little city of Muret, three successive levels will be\r\nobserved on the left bank of the Garonne. The lowest of the three is\r\nthat of the valley, properly so called; while the loftiest corresponds\r\nto the plateau of Saint-Gaudens. These three levels are distinctly\r\nmarked in the Toulousean country, which illustrates the diluvial\r\nphenomena in a remarkable fashion. The city of Toulouse reposes upon a\r\nslight eminence of diluvial formation. The flat diluvial plateau\r\ncontrasts strongly with the rounded hills of Gascony and Languedoc. They\r\nare essentially constituted of a bed of gravel, formed of rounded or\r\noval pebbles, and again covered with sandy and earthy deposits. The\r\npebbles are principally quartzose, brown or black externally, mixed with\r\nportions of hard “Old Red” and New Red Sandstone. The soft earth which\r\naccompanies the pebbles and gravel is a mixture of argillaceous sand of\r\na red or yellow colour, caused by the oxide of iron which enters into\r\nits composition. In the valley, properly so called, we find the pebbles\r\nagain associated with other minerals which are rare at the higher\r\nlevels. Some teeth of the Mammoth, and _Rhinoceros tichorhinus_, have\r\nbeen found at several points on the borders of this valley.\r\n\r\nThe small valleys, tributary to the principal valley, would appear to\r\nhave been excavated secondarily, partly out of diluvial deposits, and\r\ntheir alluvium, essentially earthy, has been formed at the expense of\r\nthe Tertiary formation, and even of the diluvium itself. Among other\r\ncelebrated sites, the diluvial formation is largely developed in Sicily.\r\nThe ancient temple of the Parthenon at Athens is built on an eminence\r\nformed of diluvial earth.\r\n\r\nIn the valley of the Rhine, in Alsace, and in many isolated parts of\r\nEurope, a particular sort of _diluvium_ forms thick beds; it consists of\r\na yellowish-grey mud, composed of argillaceous matter mixed with\r\ncarbonate of lime, quartzose and micaceous sand, and oxide of iron. This\r\nmud, termed by geologists _loess_, attains in some places considerable\r\nthickness. It is recognisable in the neighbourhood of Paris. It rises a\r\nlittle both on the right and left, above the base of the mountains of\r\nthe Black Forest and of the Vosges; and forms thick beds on the banks of\r\nthe Rhine.\r\n\r\nThe fossils contained in diluvial deposits consist, generally, of\r\nterrestrial, lacustrine, or fluviatile shells, for the most part\r\nbelonging to species still living. In parts of the valley of the Rhine,\r\nbetween Bingen and Basle, the fluviatile loam or loess, now under\r\nconsideration, is seen forming hills several hundred feet thick, and\r\ncontaining, here and there, throughout that thickness, land and\r\nfresh-water shells; from which it seems necessary to suppose, according\r\nto Lyell, first, a time when the loess was slowly accumulated, then a\r\nlater period, when large portions of it were removed--and followed by\r\nmovements of oscillation, consisting, first, of a general depression,\r\nand then of a gradual re-elevation of the land.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have already noticed the caverns in which such extraordinary\r\naccumulations of animal remains were discovered: it will not be out of\r\nplace to give here a résumé of the state of our knowledge concerning\r\n_bone-caves_ and _bone-breccias_.\r\n\r\nThe _bone-caves_ are not simply cavities hollowed out of the rock; they\r\ngenerally consist of numerous chambers or caverns communicating with\r\neach other by narrow passages (often of considerable length) which can\r\nonly be traversed by creeping. One in Mexico extends several leagues.\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable in Europe is that of Gailenreuth in\r\nFranconia. The Harz mountains contain many fine caverns; among others,\r\nthose of Scharrfeld and _Baumann’s Hohl_, in which many bones of Hyæna,\r\nBears, and Lions have been found together. The _Kirkdale Cave_, so well\r\nknown from the description given of it by Dr. Buckland, lying about\r\ntwenty-five miles north-north-east of York, was the burial-place, as we\r\nhave stated, of at least 300 Hyænas belonging to individuals of\r\ndifferent ages; besides containing some other remains, mostly teeth\r\n(those of the Hyæna excepted) belonging to ruminating animals. Buckland\r\nstates that the bones of all the other animals, those of the Hyænas not\r\nexcepted, were gnawed. He also noticed a partial polish and wearing away\r\nto a considerable depth of one side of many of the best preserved\r\nspecimens of teeth and bones, which can only be accounted for by\r\nreferring the partial destruction to the continual treading of the\r\nHyænas, and the rubbing of their skin on the side that lay uppermost at\r\nthe bottom of the den.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts it would appear probable that the Cave at Kirkdale was,\r\n“during a long succession of years, inhabited as a den by Hyænas, and\r\nthat they dragged into its recesses the other animal bodies, whose\r\nremains are found mixed indiscriminately with their own.”[103] This\r\nconjecture is made almost certain by the discovery made by Dr. Buckland\r\nof many coprolites of animals that had fed on bones, as well as traces\r\nof the frequent passage of these animals to or from the entrance of the\r\ncavern or den. A modern naturalist visiting the Cavern of Adelsberg, in\r\nCarniola, traversed a series of chambers extending over three leagues in\r\nthe same direction, and was only stopped in his subterranean discoveries\r\nby coming to a lake which occupied its entire breadth.\r\n\r\n  [103] “Reliquiæ Diluvianæ,” by the Rev. W. Buckland, 1823, p. 19.\r\n\r\nThe interior walls of the bone-caves are, in general, rounded off, and\r\nfurrowed, presenting many traces of the erosive action of water,\r\ncharacteristics which frequently escape observation because the walls\r\nare covered with the calcareous deposit called _stalactite_ or\r\n_stalagmite_--that is, with carbonate of lime, resulting from the\r\ndeposition left by infiltrating water, through the overlying limestone,\r\ninto the interior of the cavern. The formation of the stalactite, with\r\nwhich many of the bones were incrusted in the Cave of Gailenreuth, is\r\nthus described by Liebig. The limestone over the cavern is covered with\r\na rich soil, in which the vegetable matter is continually decaying. This\r\nmould, or humus, being acted on by moisture and air, evolves carbonic\r\nacid, which is dissolved by rain. The rain-water thus impregnated,\r\npermeating the porous limestone, dissolves a portion of it, and\r\nafterwards, when the excess of carbonic acid evaporates in the caverns,\r\nparts with the calcareous matter, and forms _stalactite_--the\r\nstalactites being the pendent masses of carbonate of lime, which hang in\r\npicturesque forms either in continuous sheets, giving the cave and its\r\nsides the appearance of being hung with drapery, or like icicles\r\nsuspended from the roof of the cave, through which the water percolates;\r\nwhile those formed on the surface of the floor form _stalagmite_. These\r\ncalcareous products ornament the walls of these gloomy caverns in a most\r\nbrilliant and picturesque manner.\r\n\r\nUnder a covering of stalagmite, the floor of the cave frequently\r\npresents deposits of mud and gravel. It is in excavating this soil that\r\nthe bones of antediluvian animals, mixed with shells, fragments of\r\nrocks, and rolled pebbles, are discovered. The distribution of these\r\nbones in the middle of the gravelly argillaceous mud is as irregular as\r\npossible. The skeletons are rarely entire; the bones do not even occur\r\nin their natural positions. The bones of small Rodents are found\r\naccumulated in the crania of great Carnivora. The teeth of Bears,\r\nHyænas, and Rhinoceros are cemented with the jaw-bones of Ruminants. The\r\nbones are very often polished and rounded, as if they had been\r\ntransported from great distances; others are fissured; others,\r\nnevertheless, are scarcely altered. Their state of preservation varies\r\nwith their position in the cave.\r\n\r\nThe bones most frequently found in caves are those of the Carnivora of\r\nthe Quaternary epoch: the Bear, Hyæna, the Lion, and Tiger. The animals\r\nof the plain, and notably the great Pachyderms--the Mammoth and\r\nRhinoceros--are only very rarely met with, and always in small numbers.\r\nFrom the cavern of Gailenreuth more than a thousand skeletons have been\r\ntaken, of which 800 belonged to the large _Ursus spelæus_, and sixty to\r\nthe smaller species, with 200 Hyænas, Wolves, Lions, and Gluttons. A jaw\r\nof the Glutton has lately been found by Mr. T. McK. Hughes in a cave in\r\nthe Mountain Limestone at Plas Heaton, associated with Wolf, Bison,\r\nReindeer, Horse, and Cave Bear; proving that the Glutton, which at the\r\npresent day inhabits Siberia and the inclement northern regions of\r\nEurope, inhabited Great Britain during the Pleistocene or Quaternary\r\nPeriod. In the Kirkdale cave the remains, as we have seen, included\r\nthose of not less than 300 Hyænas of all ages. Dr. Buckland concludes,\r\nfrom these circumstances, that the Hyænas alone made this their den, and\r\nthat the bones of other animals accumulated there had been carried\r\nthither by them as their prey; it is, however, now admitted that this\r\npart of the English geologist’s conclusions do not apply to the contents\r\nof all bone-caves. In some instances the bones of the Mammals are broken\r\nand worn as with a long transport, _rolled_, according to the technical\r\ngeological expression, and finally cemented in the same mud, together\r\nwith fragments of the rocks of the neighbourhood. Besides bones of\r\nHyænas, are found not only the bones of inoffensive herbivora, but\r\nremains of Lions and Bears.\r\n\r\nWe ought to note, in order to make this explanation complete, that some\r\ngeologists consider that these caves served as a refuge for sick and\r\nwounded animals. It is certain that we see, in our own days, some\r\nanimals, when attacked by sickness, seek refuge in the fissures of\r\nrocks, or in the hollows of trunks of trees, where they die; to this\r\nnatural impulse it may, probably, be ascribed that the skeletons of\r\nanimals are so rarely found in forests or plains. We may conclude, then,\r\nthat besides the more general mode in which these caverns were filled\r\nwith bones, the two other causes which we have enumerated may have been\r\nin operation; that is to say, they were the habitual sojourn of\r\ncarnivorous and destructive animals, and they became the retreat of sick\r\nanimals on some particular occasions.\r\n\r\nWhat was the origin of these caves? How have these immense excavations\r\nbeen produced? Nearly all these caves occur in limestone rocks,\r\nparticularly in the Jurassic and Carboniferous formations, which present\r\nmany vast subterranean caverns. At the same time some fine caves exist\r\nin the Silurian formation, such as the _Grotto des Demoiselles_ (Fig.\r\n194) near Ganges, of Hérault. It should be added, in order to complete\r\nthe explanation of the cave formations, that the greater part of these\r\nvast internal excavations have been chiefly caused by subterranean\r\nwatercourses, which have eroded and washed away a portion of the walls,\r\nand in this manner greatly enlarged their original dimensions.\r\n\r\nBut there are other modes than the above of accounting, in a more\r\nsatisfactory manner, for the existence of these caves. According to Sir\r\nCharles Lyell, there was a time when (as now) limestone rocks were\r\ndissolved, and when the carbonate of lime was carried away gradually by\r\nsprings from the interior of the earth; that another era occurred, when\r\nengulfed rivers or occasional floods swept organic and inorganic débris\r\ninto the subterranean hollows previously formed; finally, there were\r\nchanges, in which engulfed rivers were turned into new channels, and\r\nsprings dried up, after which the cave-mud, breccia, gravel, and fossil\r\nbones were left in the position in which they are now discovered. “We\r\nknow,” says that eminent geologist,[104] “that in every limestone\r\ndistrict the rain-water is _soft_, or free from earthy ingredients, when\r\nit falls upon the soil, and when it enters the rocks below; whereas it\r\nis _hard_, or charged with carbonate of lime, when it issues again to\r\nthe surface in springs. The rain derives some of its carbonic acid from\r\nthe air, but more from the decay of vegetable matter in the soil through\r\nwhich it percolates; and by the excess of this acid, limestone is\r\ndissolved, and the water becomes charged with carbonate of lime. The\r\nmass of solid matter silently and unceasingly subtracted in this way\r\nfrom the rocks in every century is considerable, and must in the course\r\nof thousands of years be so vast, that the space it once occupied may\r\nwell be expressed by a long suite of caverns.”\r\n\r\n  [104] “Elements of Geology,” p. 122.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated of these bone-caves are those of Gailenreuth, in\r\nFranconia; of Nabenstein, and of Brumberg, in the same country; the\r\ncaves on the banks of the Meuse, near Liège, of which the late Dr.\r\nSchmerling examined forty; of Yorkshire, Devonshire, Somersetshire, and\r\nDerbyshire, in England; also several in Sicily, at Palermo, and\r\nSyracuse; in France at Hérault, in the Cévennes, and Franche Comté; and\r\nin the New World, in Kentucky and Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe _ossiferous breccia_ differs from the bone-caves only in form. The\r\nmost remarkable of them are seen at Cette, Antibes, and Nice, on the\r\nshores of Italy; and in the isles of Corsica, Malta, and Sardinia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 194.--Grotto des Demoiselles, Hérault.]\r\n\r\nNearly the same bones are found in the _breccia_ which we find in the\r\ncaves; the chief difference being that fossils of the Ruminants are\r\nthere in greater abundance. The proportions of bones to the fragments of\r\nstone and cement vary considerably in different localities. In the\r\n_breccia_ of Cagliari, where the remains of Ruminants are less abundant\r\nthan at Gibraltar and Nice, the bones, which are those of the small\r\nRodents, are, so to speak, more abundant than the mud in which they are\r\nembedded. We find, there, also, three or four species of Birds which\r\nbelong to Thrushes and Larks. In the _breccia_ at Nice the remains of\r\nsome great Carnivora are found, among which are recognised two species\r\nof Lion and Panther. In the Grotto di San-Ciro, in the Monte Griffone,\r\nabout six miles from Palermo, in Sicily, Dr. Falconer collected remains\r\nof two species of Hippopotamus and bones of _Elephas antiquus_, Bos,\r\nStag, Pig, Bear, Dog, and a large _Felis_, some of which indicated a\r\nPliocene age. Like many others, this cave contains a thick mass of\r\nbone-breccia on its floor, the bones of which have long been known, and\r\nwere formerly supposed to be those of giants; while Prof. Ferrara\r\nsuggested that the Elephants’ bones were due to the Carthaginian\r\nelephants imported into Sicily for purposes of sport.[105]\r\n\r\n  [105] _Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc._, 1859.\r\n\r\nBut the _breccia_ is not confined to Europe. We meet with it in all\r\nparts of the globe; and recent discoveries in Australia indicate a\r\nformation corresponding exactly to the _ossiferous breccia_ of the\r\nMediterranean, in which an ochreous-reddish cement binds together\r\nfragments of rocks and bones, among which we find four species of\r\nKangaroos.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 195.--Beloptera Sepioidea.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGLACIAL PERIOD.\r\n\r\nThe two cataclysms, of which we have spoken, surprised Europe at the\r\nmoment of the development of an important creation. The whole scope of\r\nanimated Nature, the evolution of animals, was suddenly arrested in that\r\npart of our hemisphere over which these gigantic convulsions spread,\r\nfollowed by the brief but sudden submersion of entire continents.\r\nOrganic life had scarcely recovered from the violent shock, when a\r\nsecond, and perhaps severer blow assailed it. The northern and central\r\nparts of Europe, the vast countries which extend from Scandinavia to the\r\nMediterranean and the Danube, were visited by a period of sudden and\r\nsevere cold: the temperature of the polar regions seized them. The\r\nplains of Europe, but now ornamented by the luxurious vegetation\r\ndeveloped by the heat of a burning climate, the boundless pastures on\r\nwhich herds of great Elephants, the active Horse, the robust\r\nHippopotamus, and great Carnivorous animals grazed and roamed, became\r\ncovered with a mantle of ice and snow.\r\n\r\nTo what cause are we to attribute a phenomenon so unforeseen, and\r\nexercising itself with such intensity? In the present state of our\r\nknowledge no certain explanation of the event can be given. Did the\r\ncentral planet, the sun, which was long supposed to distribute light and\r\nheat to the earth, lose during this period its calorific powers? This\r\nexplanation is insufficient, since at this period the solar heat is not\r\nsupposed to have greatly influenced the earth’s temperature. Were the\r\nmarine currents, such as the _Gulf Stream_, which carries the Atlantic\r\nOcean towards the north and west of Europe, warming and raising its\r\ntemperature, suddenly turned in the contrary direction? No such\r\nhypothesis is sufficient to explain either the cataclysms or the glacial\r\nphenomena; and we need not hesitate to confess our ignorance of this\r\nstrange, this mysterious, episode in the history of the globe.\r\n\r\nThere have been attempts, and very ingenious ones too, to explain these\r\nphenomena, of which we shall give a brief summary, without committing\r\nourselves to any further opinion, using for that purpose the information\r\ncontained in M. Ch. Martins’ excellent work. “The most violent\r\nconvulsions of the solid and liquid elements,” says this able writer,\r\n“appear to have been themselves only the effects due to a cause much\r\nmore powerful than the mere expansion of the pyrosphere; and it is\r\nnecessary to recur, in order to explain them, to some new and bolder\r\nhypothesis than has yet been hazarded. Some philosophers have belief in\r\nan astronomical revolution which may have overtaken our globe in the\r\nfirst age of its formation, and have modified its position in relation\r\nto the sun. They admit that the poles have not always been as they are\r\nnow, and that some terrible shock displaced them, changing at the same\r\ntime the inclination of the axis of the rotation of the earth.” This\r\nhypothesis, which is nearly the same as that propounded by the Danish\r\ngeologist, Klee, has been ably developed by M. de Boucheporn. According\r\nto this writer, many multiplied shocks, caused by the violent contact of\r\nthe earth with comets, produced the elevation of mountains, the\r\ndisplacement of seas, and perturbations of climate--phenomena which he\r\nascribes to the sudden disturbance of the parallelism of the axis of\r\nrotation. The antediluvian equator, according to him, makes a right\r\nangle with the existing equator.\r\n\r\n“Quite recently,” adds M. Martins, “a learned French mathematician, M.\r\nJ. Adhémar, has taken up the same idea; but, dismissing the more\r\nproblematical elements of the concussion with comets as untenable, he\r\nseeks to explain the deluges by the laws of gravitation and celestial\r\nmechanics, and his theory has been supported by very competent writers.\r\nIt is this: We know that our planet is influenced by two essential\r\nmovements--one of rotation on its axis, which it accomplishes in\r\ntwenty-four hours; the other of translation, which it accomplishes in a\r\nlittle more than 365¼ days. But besides these great and perceptible\r\nmovements, the earth has a third, and even a fourth movement, with one\r\nof which we need not occupy ourselves; it is that designated _nutation_\r\nby astronomers. It changes periodically, but within very restricted\r\nlimits, the inclination of the terrestrial axis to the plane of the\r\necliptic by a slight oscillation, the duration of which is only eighteen\r\nhours, and its influence upon the relative length of day and night\r\nalmost inappreciable. The other movement is that on which M. Adhémar’s\r\ntheory is founded.\r\n\r\n“We know that the curve described by the earth in its annual revolution\r\nround the sun is not a circle, but an ellipse; that is, a slightly\r\nelongated circle, sometimes called a circle of two centres, one of which\r\nis occupied by the sun. This curve is called the ecliptic. We know,\r\nalso, that, in its movement of translation, the earth preserves such a\r\nposition that its axis of rotation is intercepted, at its centre, by the\r\nplane of the ecliptic. But in place of being perpendicular, or at right\r\nangles with this plane, it crosses it obliquely in such a manner as to\r\nform on one side an angle of one-fourth, and on the other an angle of\r\nthree-fourths of a right angle. This inclination is only altered in an\r\ninsignificant degree by the movement of _nutation_. I need scarcely add\r\nthat the earth, in its annual revolution, occupies periodically four\r\nprincipal positions on the ecliptic, which mark the limits of the four\r\nseasons. When its centre is at the extremity most remote from the sun,\r\nor _aphelion_, it is the summer solstice for the northern hemisphere.\r\nWhen its centre is at the other extremity, or _perihelion_, the same\r\nhemisphere is at the winter solstice. The two intermediate points mark\r\nthe equinoxes of spring and autumn. The great circle of separation of\r\nlight and shade passes, then, precisely through the poles, the day and\r\nnight are equal, and the line of intersection of the plane of the\r\nequator and that of the ecliptic make part of the vector ray from the\r\ncentre of the sun to the centre of the earth--what we call the\r\n_equinoctial line_.\r\n\r\n“Thus placed, it is evident that if the terrestrial axis remained always\r\nparallel to itself, the equinoctial line would always pass through the\r\nsame point on the surface of the globe. But it is not absolutely thus.\r\nThe parallelism of the axis of the earth is changed slowly, very slowly,\r\nby a movement which Arago ingeniously compares to the varying\r\ninclination of a top when about to cease spinning. This movement has the\r\neffect of making the equinoctial points on the surface of the earth\r\nretrograde towards the east from year to year, in such a manner that at\r\nthe end of 25,800 years according to some astronomers, but 21,000 years\r\naccording to Adhémar, the equinoctial point has literally made a circuit\r\nof the globe, and has returned to the same position which it occupied at\r\nthe beginning of this immense period, which has been called the ‘_great\r\nyear_.’ It is this retrograde evolution, in which the terrestrial axis\r\ndescribes round its own centre that revolution round a double conic\r\nsurface, which is known as the _precession of the equinoxes_. It was\r\nobserved 2,000 years ago by Hipparchus; its cause was discovered by\r\nNewton; and its complete evolution explained by D’Alembert and Laplace.\r\n\r\n“Now, we know that the consequence of the inclination of the terrestrial\r\naxis with the plane of the ecliptic is--\r\n\r\n“1. That the seasons are inverse to the two hemispheres--that is to\r\nsay, the northern hemisphere enjoys its spring and summer, while the\r\nsouthern hemisphere passes through autumn and winter.\r\n\r\n“2. When the earth approaches nearest to the sun, our hemisphere has its\r\nautumn and winter; and the regions near the pole, receiving none of the\r\nsolar rays, are plunged into darkness, approaching that of night, during\r\nsix months of the year.\r\n\r\n“3. When the earth is most distant from the sun, when much the greater\r\nhalf of the ecliptic intervenes between it and the focus of light and\r\nheat, the pole, being then turned towards this focus, constantly\r\nreceives its rays, and the rest of the northern hemisphere enjoys its\r\nlong days of spring and summer.\r\n\r\n“Bearing in mind that, in going from the equinox of spring to the\r\nautumnal equinox of our hemisphere, the earth traverses a much longer\r\ncurve than it does on its return; bearing in mind, also, the accelerated\r\nmovement it experiences in its approach to the sun from the attraction,\r\nwhich increases in inverse proportion to the square of its distance, we\r\narrive at the conclusion that our summer should be longer and our winter\r\nshorter than the summer and winter of our antipodes; and this is\r\n_actually_ the case by about eight days.\r\n\r\n“I say _actually_, because, if we now look at the effects of the\r\nprecession of the equinoxes, we shall see that in a time equal to half\r\nof the _grand year_, whether it be 12,900 or 10,500 years, the\r\nconditions will be reversed; the terrestrial axis, and consequently the\r\npoles, will have accomplished the half of their bi-conical revolution\r\nround the centre of the earth. It will then be the northern hemisphere\r\nwhich will have the summers shorter and the winters longer, and the\r\nsouthern hemisphere exactly the reverse. In the year 1248 before the\r\nChristian era, according to M. Adhémar, the north pole attained its\r\nmaximum summer duration. Since then--that is to say for the last 3,112\r\nyears--it has begun to decrease, and this will continue to the year 7388\r\nof our era before it attains its maximum winter duration.\r\n\r\n“But the reader may ask, fatigued perhaps by these abstract\r\nconsiderations, What is there here in common with the deluges?\r\n\r\n“The _grand year_ is here divided, for each hemisphere, into two great\r\nseasons, which De Jouvencel calls the great summer and winter, which\r\nwill each, according to M. Adhémar, be 10,500 years.\r\n\r\n“During the whole of this period one of the poles has constantly had\r\nshorter winters and longer summers than the other. It follows that the\r\npole which experiences the long winter undergoes a gradual and\r\ncontinuous cooling, in consequence of which the quantities of ice and\r\nsnow, which melt during the summer, are more than compensated by those\r\nwhich are again produced in the winter. The ice and snow go on\r\naccumulating from year to year, and finish at the end of the period by\r\nforming, at the coldest pole, a sort of crust or cap, vast, thick, and\r\nheavy enough to modify the spheroidal form of the earth. This\r\nmodification, as a necessary consequence, produces a notable\r\ndisplacement of the centre of gravity, or--for it amounts to the same\r\nthing--of the centre of attraction, round which all the watery masses\r\ntend to restore it. The south pole, as we have seen, finished its _great\r\nwinter_ in 1248 B.C. The accumulated ice then added itself to the snow,\r\nand the snow to the ice, at the south pole, towards which the watery\r\nmasses all tended until they covered nearly the whole of the southern\r\nhemisphere. But since that date of 1248, our _great winter_ has been in\r\nprogress. Our pole, in its turn, goes on getting cooler continually; ice\r\nis being heaped upon snow, and snow upon ice, and in 7,388 years the\r\ncentre of gravity of the earth will return to its normal position, which\r\nis the geometrical centre of the spheroid. Following the immutable laws\r\nof central attraction, the southern waters accruing from the melted ice\r\nand snow of the south pole will return to invade and overwhelm once more\r\nthe continents of the northern hemisphere, giving rise to new\r\ncontinents, in all probability, in the southern hemisphere.”\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief statement of the hypothesis which Adhémar has very\r\ningeniously worked out. How far it explains the mysterious phenomena\r\nwhich we have under consideration we shall not attempt to say, our\r\nconcern being with the effects. Does the evidence of upward and downward\r\nmovements of the surface in Tertiary times explain the great change? For\r\nif the cooling which preceded and succeeded the two European deluges\r\nstill remains an unsolved problem, its effects are perfectly\r\nappreciable. The intense cold which visited the northern and central\r\nparts of Europe resulted in the annihilation of organic life in those\r\ncountries. All the watercourses, the rivers and streams, the seas and\r\nlakes, were frozen. As Agassiz says in his first work on “Glaciers”: “A\r\nvast mantle of ice and snow covered the plains, the valleys, and the\r\nseas. All the springs were dried up; the rivers ceased to flow. To the\r\nmovements of a numerous and animated creation succeeded the silence of\r\ndeath.” Great numbers of animals perished from cold. The Elephant and\r\nRhinoceros perished by thousands in the midst of their grazing grounds,\r\nwhich became transformed into fields of ice and snow. It is then that\r\nthese two species disappeared, and seem to have been effaced from\r\ncreation. Other animals were overwhelmed, without their race having been\r\nalways entirely annihilated. The sun, which lately lighted up the\r\nverdant plains, as it dawned upon these frozen steppes, was only saluted\r\nby the whistling of the north winds, and the horrible rending of the\r\ncrevasses, which opened up on all sides under the heat of its rays,\r\nacting upon the immense glacier which formed the sepulchre of many\r\nanimated beings.\r\n\r\nHow can we accept the idea that the plains, but yesterday smiling and\r\nfertile, were formerly covered, and that for a very long period, with an\r\nimmense sheet of ice and snow? To satisfy the reader that the proof of\r\nthis can be established on sufficient evidence, it is necessary to\r\ndirect his attention to certain parts of Europe. It is essential to\r\nvisit, at least in idea, a country where _glacial phenomena_ still\r\nexist, and to prove that the phenomena, now confined to those countries,\r\nwere spread, during geological times, over spaces infinitely vaster. We\r\nshall choose for our illustration, and as an example, the glaciers of\r\nthe Alps. We shall show that the glaciers of Switzerland and Savoy have\r\nnot always been restricted to their present limits; that they are, so to\r\nspeak, only miniature resemblances of the gigantic glaciers of times\r\npast; and that they formerly extended over all the great plains which\r\nextend from the foot of the chain of the Alps.\r\n\r\nTo establish these proofs we must enter upon some consideration of\r\nexisting glaciers, upon their mode of formation, and their peculiar\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nThe snow which, during the whole year, falls upon the mountains, does\r\nnot melt, but maintains its solid state, when the elevation exceeds the\r\nheight of 9,000 feet or thereabouts. Where the snow accumulates to a\r\ngreat thickness, in the valleys, or in the deep fissures in the ground,\r\nit hardens under the influence of the pressure resulting from the\r\nincumbent weight. But it always happens that a certain quantity of\r\nwater, resulting from the momentary thawing of the superficial portions,\r\ntraverses its substance, and this forms a crystalline mass of ice, with\r\na granular structure, which the Swiss naturalists designate _névé_. From\r\nthe successive melting and freezing caused by the heat by day and the\r\ncold by night, and the infiltration of air and water into its\r\ninterstices, the _névé_ is slowly transformed into a homogeneous azure\r\nmass of ice, full of an infinite number of little air-bubbles--this was\r\nwhat was formerly called _glace bulleuse_ (bubble-ice). Finally, these\r\nmasses, becoming completely frozen, water replaces the bubbles of air.\r\nThen the transformation is complete; the ice is homogeneous, and\r\npresents those beautiful azure tints so much admired by the tourist who\r\ntraverses the magnificent glaciers of Switzerland and Savoy.\r\n\r\nSuch is the origin of, and such is the mode in which the glaciers of\r\nthe Alps are formed. An important property of glaciers remains to be\r\npointed out. They have a general movement of translation in the\r\ndirection of their slope, under the influence of which they make a\r\ncertain yearly progress downward, according to the angle of the slope.\r\nThe glacier of the Aar, for example, advances at the rate of about 250\r\nfeet each year.\r\n\r\nUnder the joint influence of the slope, the weight of the frozen mass,\r\nand the melting of the parts which touch the earth, the glacier thus\r\nalways tends downwards; but from the effects of a more genial\r\ntemperature, the lower extremity melting rapidly, has a tendency to\r\nrecede. It is the difference between these two actions which constitutes\r\nthe real progressive movement of the glacier.\r\n\r\nThe friction exercised by the glacier upon the bottom and sides of the\r\nvalley, ought necessarily to leave its traces on the rocks with which it\r\nmay happen to be in contact. Over all the places where a glacier has\r\npassed, in fact, we remark that the rocks are polished, levelled,\r\nrounded, and, as it is termed, _moutonnées_. These rocks present,\r\nbesides, striations or scratches, running in the direction of the motion\r\nof the glacier, which have been produced by hard and angular fragments\r\nof stones imbedded in the ice, and which leave their marks on the\r\nhardest rocks under the irresistible pressure of the heavy-descending\r\nmass of ice. In a work of great merit, which we have before quoted, M.\r\nCharles Martins explains the physical mechanism by which granite rocks\r\nborne onwards in the progressive movements of a glacier, have scratched,\r\nscored, and rounded the softer rocks which the glacier has encountered\r\nin its descent. “The friction,” says M. Martins, “which the glacier\r\nexercises upon the bottom and upon the walls, is too considerable not to\r\nleave its traces upon the rocks with which it may be in contact; but its\r\naction varies according to the mineralogical nature of the rocks, and\r\nthe configuration of the ground they cover. If we penetrate between the\r\nsoil and the bottom of the glacier, taking advantage of the ice-caverns\r\nwhich sometimes open at its edge or extremity, we creep over a bed of\r\npebbles and fine sand saturated with water. If we remove this bed, we\r\nsoon perceive that the underlying rock is levelled, polished, ground\r\ndown by friction, and covered with rectilinear striæ, resembling\r\nsometimes small grooves, more frequently perfectly straight scratches,\r\nas though they had been produced by means of a graver, or even a very\r\nfine needle. The mechanism by which these striæ have been produced is\r\nthat which industry employs to polish stones and metals. We rub the\r\nmetallic surface with a fine powder called _emery_, until we give it a\r\nbrilliancy which proceeds from the reflection of the light from an\r\ninfinity of minute striæ. The bed of pebbles and mud, interposed between\r\nthe glacier and the subjacent rock, here represents the emery. The rock\r\nis the metallic surface, and the mass of the glacier which presses on\r\nand displaces the mud in its descent towards the plain, represents the\r\nhand of the polisher. These striæ always follow the direction of the\r\nglacier; but as it is sometimes subject to small lateral deviations, the\r\nstriæ sometimes cross, forming very small angles with one another. If we\r\nexamine the rocks by the side of a glacier, we find similar striæ\r\nengraved on them where they have been in contact with the frozen mass. I\r\nhave often broken the ice where it thus pressed upon the rock, and have\r\nfound under it polished surfaces, covered with striations. The pebbles\r\nand grains of sand which had engraved them were still encased in the\r\nice, fixed like the diamond of the glazier at the end of the instrument\r\nwith which he marks his glass.\r\n\r\n“The sharpness and depth of the striæ or scratches depend on many\r\ncircumstances: if the rock acted upon is calcareous, and the emery is\r\nrepresented by pebbles and sand derived from harder rocks, such as\r\ngneiss, granite, or protogine, the scratches are very marked. This we\r\ncan verify at the foot of the glaciers of Rosenlaui, and of the\r\nGrindenwald in the Canton of Berne. On the contrary, if the rock is\r\ngneissic, granitic, or serpentinous, that is to say, very hard, the\r\nscratches will be less deep and less marked, as may be seen in the\r\nglaciers of the Aar, of Zermatt, and Chamounix. The polish will be the\r\nsame in both cases, and it is often as perfect as in marble polished for\r\narchitectural purposes.\r\n\r\n“The scratches engraved upon the rocks which confine these glaciers are\r\ngenerally horizontal or parallel to the surface. Sometimes, owing to the\r\ncontractions of the valley, these striæ are nearly vertical. This,\r\nhowever, need not surprise us. Forced onwards by the superincumbent\r\nweight, the glacier squeezes itself through the narrow part, its bulk\r\nexpanding upwards, in which case the flanks of the mountain which barred\r\nits passage are marked vertically. This is admirably seen near the\r\nChâlets of Stieregg, a narrow defile which the lower glacier of the\r\nGrindenwald has to clear before it discharges itself into the valley of\r\nthe same name. Upon the right bank of the glacier the scratches are\r\ninclined at an angle of 45° to the horizon. Upon the left bank the\r\nglacier rises sometimes quite up to the neighbouring forest, carrying\r\nwith it great clods of earth charged with rhododendrons and clumps of\r\nalder, birches, and firs. The more tender or foliated rocks were broken\r\nup and demolished by the prodigious force of the glacier; the harder\r\nrocks offered more resistance, but their surface is planed down,\r\npolished, and striated, testifying to the enormous pressure which they\r\nhad to undergo. In the same manner the glacier of the Aar, at the foot\r\nof the promontory on which M. Agassiz’ tent was erected, is polished to\r\na great height, and on the face, turned towards the upper part of the\r\nvalley, I have observed scratches inclined 64°. The ice, erect against\r\nthis escarpment, seemed to wish to scale it, but the granite rock held\r\nfast, and the glacier was compelled to pass round it slowly.\r\n\r\n“In recapitulation, the considerable pressure of a glacier, joined to\r\nits movement of progression, acts at once upon the bottom and flanks of\r\nthe valley which it traverses: it polishes all the rocks which may be\r\ntoo hard to be demolished by it, and frequently impresses upon them a\r\npeculiar and characteristic form. In destroying all the asperities and\r\ninequalities of these rocks, it levels their surfaces and rounds them on\r\nthe sides pointing up the stream, whilst in the opposite direction, or\r\ndown the stream, they sometimes preserve their abrupt, unequal, and\r\nrugged surface. We must comprehend, in short, that the force of the\r\nglacier acts principally on the side which is towards the circle whence\r\nit descends, in the same way that the piles of a bridge are more damaged\r\nup-stream, than down, by the icebergs which the river brings down during\r\nthe winter. Seen from a distance, a group of rocks thus rounded and\r\npolished reminds us of the appearance of a flock of sheep: hence the\r\nname _roches moutonnées_ given them by the Swiss naturalists.”\r\n\r\nAnother phenomenon which plays an important part in existing glaciers,\r\nand in those, also, which formerly covered Switzerland, is found in the\r\nfragments of rock, often of enormous size, which have been transported\r\nand deposited during their movement of progression.\r\n\r\nThe peaks of the Alps are exposed to continual degradations. Formed of\r\ngranitic rocks--rocks eminently alterable under the action of air and\r\nwater, they become disintegrated and often fall in fragments more or\r\nless voluminous. “The masses of snow,” continues Martins, “which hang\r\nupon the Alps during winter, the rain which infiltrates between their\r\nbeds during summer, the sudden action of torrents of water, and more\r\nslowly, but yet more powerfully, the chemical affinities, degrade,\r\ndisintegrate, and decompose the hardest rocks. The débris thus produced\r\nfalls from the summits into the circles occupied by the glaciers with a\r\ngreat crash, accompanied by frightful noises and great clouds of dust.\r\nEven in the middle of summer I have seen these avalanches of stone\r\nprecipitated from the highest ridges of the Schreckhorn, forming upon\r\nthe immaculate snow a long black train, consisting of enormous blocks\r\nand an immense number of smaller fragments. In the spring a rapid\r\nthawing of the winter snows often causes accidental torrents of extreme\r\nviolence. If the melting is slow, water insinuates itself into the\r\nsmallest fissures of the rocks, freezes there, and rends asunder the\r\nmost refractory masses. The blocks detached from the mountains are\r\nsometimes of gigantic dimensions: we have found them sixty feet in\r\nlength, and those measuring thirty feet each way are by no means rare in\r\nthe Alps.”[106]\r\n\r\n  [106] _Revue des Deux Mondes_, p. 925; March 1, 1847.\r\n\r\nThus, the action of aqueous infiltrations followed by frost, the\r\nchemical decomposition which granite undergoes under the influence of a\r\nmoist atmosphere, degrade and disintegrate the rocks which constitute\r\nthe mountains enclosing the glacier. Blocks, sometimes of very\r\nconsiderable dimensions, often fall at the foot of these mountains on to\r\nthe surface of the glacier. Were it immovable the débris would\r\naccumulate at its base, and would form there a mass of ruins heaped up\r\nwithout order. But the slow progression, the continuous displacement of\r\nthe glacier, lead, in the distribution of these blocks, to a certain\r\nkind of arrangement: the blocks falling upon its surface participate in\r\nits movement, and advance with it. But other downfalls take place daily,\r\nand the new débris following the first, the whole form a line along the\r\nouter edge of the glacier. These regular trains of rocks bear the name\r\nof “_moraines_.” When the rocks fall from two mountains, and on each\r\nedge of the glacier, and two parallel lines of débris are formed, they\r\nare called _lateral moraines_. There are also _median moraines_, which\r\nare formed when two glaciers are confluent, in such a manner that the\r\n_lateral moraine_, on the right of the one, trends towards the left-hand\r\none of the other. Finally, those moraines are _frontal_, or _terminal_,\r\nwhich repose, not upon the glacier, but at its point of termination in\r\nthe valleys, and which are due to the accumulation of blocks fallen from\r\nthe terminal escarpments of glaciers there arrested by some obstacle. In\r\nPLATE XXXI. we have represented an actual Swiss glacier, in which are\r\nunited the physical and geological peculiarities belonging to these\r\nenormous masses of frozen water: the moraines here are _lateral_, that\r\nis to say, formed of a double line of débris.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXXI.--Glaciers of Switzerland.]\r\n\r\nTransported slowly on the surface of the glacier, all the blocks from\r\nthe mountain preserve their original forms unaltered; the sharpness of\r\ntheir edges is never altered by their gentle transport and almost\r\nimperceptible motion. Atmospheric agency only can affect or destroy\r\nthese rocks when formed of hard resisting material. They then remain\r\nnearly of the same form and volume they had when they fell on the\r\nsurface of the glacier; but it is otherwise with blocks and fragments\r\nenclosed between the rock and the glacier, whether it be at the bottom\r\nor between the glacier and its lateral walls. Some of these, under the\r\npowerful and continuous action of this gigantic grinding process, will\r\nbe reduced to an impalpable mud, others are worn into facets, while\r\nothers are rounded, presenting a multitude of scratches crossing each\r\nother in all directions. These scratched pebbles are of great importance\r\nin studying the extent of ancient glaciers; they testify, on the spot,\r\nto the existence of pre-existing glaciers which shaped, ground, and\r\nstriated the pebbles, which water does not; on the contrary, in the\r\nlatter, they become polished and rounded, and even natural striations\r\nare effaced.\r\n\r\nThus, huge blocks transported to great distances from their true\r\ngeological beds, that is, _erratic blocks_, to use the proper technical\r\nterm, rounded (_moutonnées_), polished, and scratched surfaces,\r\n_moraines_; finally, pebbles, ground, polished, rounded, or worn into\r\nsmooth surfaces, are all physical effects of glaciers in motion, and\r\ntheir presence alone affords sufficient proof to the naturalist that a\r\nglacier formerly existed in the locality where he finds them. The reader\r\nwill now comprehend how it is possible to recognise, in our days, the\r\nexistence of ancient glaciers in different parts of the world. Above\r\nall, wherever we may find both _erratic blocks_ and _moraines_, and\r\nobserve, at the same time, indications of rocks having been polished and\r\nstriated in the same direction, we may pronounce with certainty as to\r\nthe existence of a glacier during geological times. Let us take some\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\nAt Pravolta, in the Alps, going towards _Monte Santo-Primo_, upon a\r\ncalcareous rock, we find the mass of granite represented in Fig. 196.\r\nThis erratic block exists, with thousands of others, on the slopes of\r\nthe mountain. It is about fifty feet long, nearly forty feet broad, and\r\nfive-and-twenty in height; and all its edges and angles are perfect.\r\nSome parallel striæ occur along the neighbouring rocks. All this clearly\r\ndemonstrates that a glacier existed, in former times, in this part of\r\nthe Alps, where none appear at the present time. It is a glacier, then,\r\nwhich has transported and deposited here this enormous block, weighing\r\nnearly 2,000 tons.\r\n\r\nIn the Jura Mountains, on the hill of Fourvières, a limestone eminence\r\nat Lyons, blocks of granite are found, evidently derived from the Alps,\r\nand transported there by the Swiss glaciers. The particular mode of\r\ntransport is represented theoretically in Fig. 197. A represents, for\r\nexample, the summit of the Alps, B the Jura Mountains, or the hill of\r\nFourvières, at Lyons. At the glacial period, the glacier A B C extended\r\nfrom the Alps to the mountain B. The granitic débris, which was detached\r\nfrom the summit of the Alpine mountains, fell on the surface of the\r\nglacier. The movement of progression of this glacier transported these\r\nblocks as far as the summit B. At a later period the temperature of the\r\nglobe was raised, and when the ice had melted, the blocks, D E, were\r\nquietly deposited on the spots where they are now found, without having\r\nsustained the slightest shock or injury in this singular mode of\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 196.--Erratic Blocks in the Alps.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 197.--Transported blocks.]\r\n\r\nEvery day traces, more or less recognisable, are found on the Alps of\r\nancient glaciers far distant from their existing limits. Heaps of\r\ndébris, of all sizes, comprehending blocks with sharp-pointed angles,\r\nare found in the Swiss plains and valleys. _Blocs perchés_ (Perched\r\nblocks), as in PL. XXXI., are often seen perched upon points of the Alps\r\nsituated far above existing glaciers, or dispersed over the plain which\r\nseparates the Alps from the Jura, or even preserving an incredible\r\nequilibrium, when their great mass is taken into consideration, at\r\nconsiderable heights on the eastern flank of this chain of mountains. It\r\nis by the aid of these indications that the geologist has been able to\r\ntrace to extremely remote distances signs of the former existence of the\r\nancient glaciers of the Alps, to follow them in their course, and fix\r\ntheir point of origin, and where they terminated. Thus the humble Mount\r\nSion, a gently-swelling hill situated to the north of Geneva, was the\r\npoint at which three great ancient glaciers had their confluence--the\r\nglacier of the Rhône, which filled all the basin of Lake Leman, or Lake\r\nof Geneva; that of the Isère, which issued from the Annecy and Bourget\r\nLakes; and that of the Arve, which had its source in the valley of\r\nChamounix, all converged at this point. According to M. G. de Mortillet,\r\nwho has carefully studied this geological question, the extent and\r\nsituation of these ancient glaciers of the Alps were as follows:--Upon\r\nits northern flank the _glacier of the Rhine_ occupied all the basin of\r\nLake Constance, and extended to the borders of Germany; that of the\r\n_Linth_, which was arrested at the extremity of the Lake of Zurich--this\r\ncity is built upon its terminal moraine--that of the _Reus_, which\r\ncovered the lake of the four cantons with blocks torn from the peaks of\r\nSaint-Gothard;--that of the _Aar_, the last moraines of which crown the\r\nhills in the environs of Berne;--those of the _Arve_ and the _Isère_,\r\nwhich, as we have said, debouched from Lake Annecy and Lake Bourget\r\nrespectively;--that of the _Rhône_, the most important of all. It is\r\nthis glacier which has deposited upon the flanks of the Jura, at the\r\nheight of 3,400 feet above the level of the sea, the great _erratic\r\nblocks_ already described. This mighty glacier of the Rhône had its\r\norigin in all the lateral valleys formed by the two parallel chains of\r\nthe Valais. It filled all the Valais, and extended into the plain, lying\r\nbetween the Alps and the Jura, from Fort de L’Écluse, near the fall of\r\nthe Rhône, up to the neighbourhood of Aarau.\r\n\r\nThe fragments of rocks transported by the ice-sea which occupied all the\r\nSwiss plain follow, in northerly direction, the course of the valley of\r\nthe Rhine. On the other hand, the glacier of the Rhône, after reaching\r\nthe plain of Switzerland, turned off obliquely towards the south,\r\nreceived the glacier of the Arve, then that of the Isère, passed between\r\nthe Jura and the mountains of the Grande-Chartreuse, spread over La\r\nBresse, then nearly all Dauphiny, and terminated in the neighbourhood of\r\nLyons.\r\n\r\nUpon the southern flank of the Alps, the ancient glaciers, according to\r\nM. de Mortillet’s map, occupied all the great valleys from that of the\r\nDora, on the west, to that of the Tagliamento, on the east. “The glacier\r\nof the _Dora_” says de Mortillet, whose text we greatly abridge,\r\n“debouched into the valley of the Po, close to Turin. That of the\r\n_Dora-Baltéa_ entered the plain of Ivréa, where it has left a\r\nmagnificent semicircle of hills, which formed its terminal moraine. That\r\nof the _Toce_ discharged itself into Lake Maggiore, against the glacier\r\nof the Tessin, and then threw itself into the valley of Lake Orta, at\r\nthe southern extremity of which its terminal moraines were situated.\r\nThat of the Tessin filled the basin of Lake Maggiore, and established\r\nitself between Lugano and Varèse. That of the _Adda_ filled the basin of\r\nLake Como, and established itself between Mendrizio and Lecco, thus\r\ndescribing a vast semicircle. That of the _Oglio_ terminated a little\r\nbeyond Lake Iseo. That of the _Adige_, finding no passage through the\r\nnarrow valley of Roveredo, where the valley became very narrow, took\r\nanother course, and filled the immense valley of the Lake of Garda. At\r\nNovi it has left a magnificent moraine, of which Dante speaks in his\r\n‘Inferno.’ That of the _Brenta_ extended over the plain of that commune.\r\nThe _Drave_ and the _Tagliamento_ had also their glaciers. Finally,\r\nglaciers occupied all the valleys of the Austrian and Bavarian\r\nAlps.”[107]\r\n\r\n  [107] “Carte des Anciens Glaciers des Alpes,” pp. 8-10. (1860.)\r\n\r\nSimilar traces of the existence of ancient glaciers occur in many other\r\nEuropean countries. In the Pyrenees, in Corsica, the Vosges, the Jura,\r\n&c., extensive ranges of country have been covered, in geological\r\ntimes, by these vast plains of ice. The glacier of the Moselle was the\r\nmost considerable of the glaciers of the Vosges, receiving numerous\r\naffluents; its lowest frontal moraine, which is situated below\r\nRemiremont, could not be less than a mile and a quarter in length.\r\n\r\nBut the phenomenon of the glacial extension which we have examined in\r\nthe Alps was not confined to Central Europe. The same traces of their\r\nancient existence are observed in all the north of Europe, in Russia,\r\nIceland, Norway, Prussia, the British Islands, part of Germany, in the\r\nnorth, and even in some parts of the south, of Spain. In England,\r\n_erratic_ blocks of granite are found which were derived from the\r\nmountains of Norway. It is evident that these blocks were borne by a\r\nglacier which extended from the north pole to England. In this manner\r\nthey crossed the Baltic and the North Seas. In Prussia similar traces\r\nare observable.\r\n\r\nThus, during the Quaternary epoch, glaciers which are now limited to the\r\nPolar regions, or to mountainous countries of considerable altitude,\r\nextended very far beyond their present known limits; and, taken in\r\nconnection with the deluge of the north, and the vast amount of organic\r\nlife which they destroyed, they form, perhaps, the most striking and\r\nmysterious of all geological phenomena.\r\n\r\nM. Edouard Collomb, to whom we owe much of our knowledge of ancient\r\nglaciers, furnishes the following note explanatory of a map of Ancient\r\nGlaciers which he has prepared:--\r\n\r\n“The area occupied by the ancient Quaternary glaciers may be divided\r\ninto two orographical regions:--1. The region of the north, from lat.\r\n52° or 55° up to the North Pole. 2. The region of Central Europe and\r\npart of the south.\r\n\r\n“The region of the north which has been covered by the ancient glaciers\r\ncomprehends all the Scandinavian peninsula, Sweden, Norway, and a part\r\nof Western Russia, extending from the Niemen on the north in a curve\r\nwhich passed near the sources of the Dnieper and the Volga, and thence\r\ntook a direction towards the shores of the glacial ocean. This region\r\ncomprehends Iceland, Scotland, Ireland, the isles dependent on them,\r\nand, finally, a great part of England.\r\n\r\n“This region is bounded, on all its sides, by a wide zone from 2° to 5°\r\nin breadth, over which is recognised the existence of erratic blocks of\r\nthe north: it includes the middle region of Russia in Europe, Poland, a\r\npart of Prussia, and Denmark; losing itself in Holland on the Zuider\r\nZee, it cut into the northern part of England, and we find a shred of it\r\nin France, upon the borders of the Cotentin.\r\n\r\n“The ancient glaciers of Central Europe consisted, first, of the grand\r\nmasses of the Alps. Stretching to the west and to the north, they\r\nextended to the valley of the Rhône as far as Lyons, then crossing the\r\nsummit-level of the Jura, they passed near Basle, covering Lake\r\nConstance, and stretching beyond into Bavaria and Austria. Upon the\r\nsouthern slopes of the Alps, they turned round the summit of the\r\nAdriatic, passed near to Udinet, covered Peschiera, Solferino, Como,\r\nVarèse, and Ivréa, extended to near Turin, and terminated in the valley\r\nof the Stura, near the Col de Tenda.\r\n\r\n“In the Pyrenees, the ancient glaciers have occupied all the principal\r\nvalleys of this chain, both on the French and Spanish sides, especially\r\nthe valleys of the centre, which comprehend those of Luchon, Aude,\r\nBaréges, Cauterets, and Ossun. In the Cantabrian chain, an extension of\r\nthe Pyrenees, the existence of ancient glaciers has also been\r\nrecognised.\r\n\r\n“In the Vosges and the Black Forest they covered all the southern parts\r\nof these mountains. In the Vosges, the principal traces are found in the\r\nvalleys of Saint-Amarin, Giromagny, Munster, the Moselle, &c.\r\n\r\n“In the Carpathians and the Caucasus the existence of ancient glaciers\r\nof great extent has also been observed.\r\n\r\n“In the Sierra Nevada, in the south of Spain, mountains upwards of\r\n11,000 feet high, the valleys which descend from the Picacho de Veleta\r\nand Mulhacen have been covered with ancient glaciers during the\r\nQuaternary epoch.”\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to doubt that at this epoch all the British islands,\r\nat least all north of the Thames, were covered by glaciers in their\r\nhigher parts. “Those,” says Professor Ramsay, “who know the Highlands of\r\nScotland, will remember that, though the weather has had a powerful\r\ninfluence upon them, rendering them in places rugged, jagged, and\r\ncliffy, yet, notwithstanding, their general outlines are often\r\nremarkably rounded and flowing; and when the valleys are examined in\r\ndetail, you find in their bottoms and on the sides of the hills that the\r\nmammillated structure prevails. This rounded form is known, by those who\r\nstudy glaciers, by the name of _roches moutonnées_, given to them by the\r\nSwiss writers. These mammillated forms are exceedingly common in many\r\nBritish valleys, and not only so, but the very same kind of grooving and\r\nstriation, so characteristic of the rocks in the Swiss valleys, also\r\nmarks those of the Highlands of Scotland, of Cumberland, and Wales.\r\nConsidering all these things, geologists, led by Agassiz some five or\r\nsix and twenty years ago, have by degrees come to the conclusion, that a\r\nvery large part of our island was, during the glacial period, covered,\r\nor nearly covered, with a thick coating of ice in the same way that the\r\nnorth of Greenland is at present; and that by the long-continued\r\ngrinding power of a great glacier, or set of glaciers nearly universal\r\nover the northern half of our country, and the high ground of Wales, the\r\nwhole surface became moulded by ice.”\r\n\r\nWhoever traverses England, observing its features with attention, will\r\nremark in certain places traces of the action of ice in this era. Some\r\nof the mountains present on one side a naked rock, and on the other a\r\ngentle slope, smiling and verdant, giving a character more or less\r\nabrupt, bold, and striking, to the landscape. Considerable portions of\r\ndry land were formerly covered by a bluish clay, which contained many\r\nfragments of rock or “boulders” torn from the old Cumbrian mountains;\r\nfrom the Pennine chain; from the moraines of the north of England; and\r\nfrom the Chalk hills--hence called “boulder” clay--present themselves\r\nhere and there, broken, worn, and ground up by the action of water and\r\nice. These erratic blocks or “boulders” have clearly been detached from\r\nthe parent rock by violence, and often transported to considerable\r\ndistances. They have been carried, not only across plains, but over the\r\ntops of mountains; some of them being found 130 miles from the parent\r\nrocks. We even find, as already hinted, some rocks of which no\r\nprototypes have been found nearer than Norway. There is, then, little\r\nroom for doubting the fact of an extensive system of glaciers having\r\ncovered the land, although the proofs have only been gathered\r\nlaboriously and by slow degrees in a long series of years. In 1840\r\nAgassiz visited Scotland, and his eye, accustomed to glaciers in his\r\nnative mountains, speedily detected their signs. Dr. Buckland became a\r\nzealous advocate of the same views. North Wales was soon recognised as\r\nan independent centre of a system which radiated from lofty Snowdon,\r\nthrough seven valleys, carrying with them large stones and grooving the\r\nrocks in their passage. In the pass of Llanberis there are all the\r\ncommon proofs of the valley having been filled with glacier ice. “When\r\nthe country was under water,” says Professor Ramsay, “the drift was\r\ndeposited which more or less filled up many of the Welsh valleys. When\r\nthe land had risen again to a considerable height, the glaciers\r\nincreased in size: although they never reached the immense magnitude\r\nwhich they attained in the earlier portion of the icy epoch. Still they\r\nbecame so large that such a valley as the Pass of Llanberis was a second\r\ntime occupied by ice, which ploughed out the drift that more or less\r\ncovered the valley. By degrees, however, as we approach nearer our own\r\ndays, the climate slowly ameliorated, and the glaciers began to decline,\r\ntill, growing less and less, they crept up and up; and here and there,\r\nas they died away, they left their terminal and lateral moraines still\r\nas well defined in some cases as moraines in lands where glaciers now\r\nexist. Frequently, too, masses of stone, that floated on the surface of\r\nthe ice, were left perched upon the rounded _roches moutonnées_, in a\r\nmanner somewhat puzzling to those who are not geologists.\r\n\r\n“In short, they were let down upon the surface of these rocks so quietly\r\nand so softly, that there they will lie, until an earthquake shakes them\r\ndown, or until the wasting of the rock on which they rest precipitates\r\nthem to a lower level.”\r\n\r\nIt was the opinion of Agassiz, after visiting Scotland, that the\r\nGrampians had been covered by a vast thickness of ice, whence erratic\r\nblocks had been dispersed in all directions as from a centre; other\r\ngeologists after a time adopted the opinion--Mr. Robert Chambers going\r\nso far as to maintain, in 1848, that Scotland had been at one time\r\nmoulded by ice. Mr. T. F. Jamieson followed in the same track, adducing\r\nmany new facts to prove that the Grampians once sent down glaciers in\r\nall directions towards the sea. “The glacial grooves,” he says, “radiate\r\noutward from the central heights towards all points of the compass,\r\nalthough they do not strictly conform to the actual shape and contour of\r\nthe minor valleys and ridges.” But the most interesting part of Mr.\r\nJamieson’s investigations is undoubtedly the ingenious manner in which\r\nhe has worked out Agassiz’ assertion that Glenroy, whose remarkable\r\n“_Parallel Roads_” have puzzled so many investigators, was once the\r\nbasin of a frozen lake.\r\n\r\nGlenroy is one of the many romantic glens of Lochaber, at the head of\r\nthe Spey, near to the Great Glen, or the valley of the Caledonian Canal,\r\nwhich stretches obliquely across the country in a northwesterly\r\ndirection from Loch Linnhè to Loch Ness, leaving Loch Arkaig, Loch Aich,\r\nGlen Garry, and many a highland loch besides, on the left, and Glen\r\nSpean, in which Loch Treig, running due north and south, has its mouth,\r\non the south. Glenroy opens into it from the north, while Glen Gluoy\r\nopens into the Great Glen opposite Loch Arkaig. Mr. Jamieson commenced\r\nhis investigations at the mouth of Loch Arkaig, which is about a mile\r\nfrom the lake itself. Here he found the gneiss ground down as if by ice\r\ncoming from the east. On the hill, north of the lake, the gneiss, though\r\nmuch worn and weathered, still exhibited well-marked striæ, directed up\r\nand down the valley. Other markings showed that the Glen Arkaig glacier\r\nnot only blocked up Glen Gluoy, but the mouth of Glen Spean, which lies\r\ntwo miles or so north of it on the opposite side.\r\n\r\nAt Brackletter, on the south side of Glen Spean, near its junction with\r\nGlen Lochy, glacial scores pointing more nearly due west, but slightly\r\ninclining to the north, were observed, as if caused by the pressure of\r\nice from Glen Lui. The south side of Glen Spean, from its mouth to Loch\r\nTreig, is bounded by lofty hills--an extension of Ben Nevis, the highest\r\nof these peaks exceeding 3,000 feet. Numerous gullies intersect their\r\nflanks, and the largest of these, Corry N’Eoin, presents a series of\r\nrocky amphitheatres, or rather large caldrons, whose walls have been\r\nground down by long-continued glacial action: the quartz-veins are all\r\nshorn down to the level of the gneiss, and streaked with fine scratches,\r\npointing down the hollows and far up the rocks on either side. During\r\nall these operations the great valley was probably filled up with ice,\r\nwhich would close Glen Gluoy and Glen Spean, and might also close the\r\nlowest of the lines in Glenroy. But how about the middle and upper\r\nlines?\r\n\r\nA glacier crossing from Loch Treig, and protruding across Glen Spean,\r\nwould cut off Glens Glaibu and Makoul, when the water in Glenroy could\r\nonly escape over the Col into Strathspey, when the first level would be\r\nmarked.\r\n\r\nNow let the Glen Treig glacier shrink a little, so as to let out water\r\nto the level of the second line by the outline at Makoul, and the theory\r\nis complete. When the first and greatest glacier gave way, Glenroy would\r\nbe nearly in its present state.\r\n\r\nThe glacier, on issuing from the gorge at the end of Loch Treig, would\r\ndilate immensely, the right flank spreading over a rough expanse of\r\nsyenite, the neighbouring hills being mica-schists, with veins of\r\nporphyry. Now the syenite breaks into large cuboidal blocks of immense\r\nsize. These have been swept before the advancing glacier along with\r\nother débris, and deposited in a semicircle of mounds having a sweep of\r\nseveral miles, forming circular bands which mark the edges of the\r\nglacier as it shrunk from time to time under the influence of a milder\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nThis moraine, which was all that was wanting to complete the theory laid\r\ndown by Agassiz, is found on the pony-road leading from the mouth of\r\nLoch Treig towards Badenoch. A mile or so brings the traveller to the\r\nsummit-level of the road, and beyond the hill a low moor stretches away\r\nto the bottom of the plain. Here, slanting across the slope of the hill\r\ntowards Loch Treig, two lines of moraine stretch across the road. At\r\nfirst they consist of mica-schists and bits of porphyry, but blocks of\r\nsyenite soon become intermingled. Outside these are older hillocks,\r\nrising in some places sixty and seventy feet high, forming narrow\r\nsteep-sided mounds, with blocks fourteen feet in length sticking out of\r\nthe surface, mixed with fragments of mica-schist and gneiss. The inner\r\nmoraine consists, almost wholly, of large blocks of syenite, five, ten,\r\nfifteen, and five-and-twenty feet long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 198.--Parallel roads of Glenroy; from a sketch by\r\nProfessor J. Phillips.]\r\n\r\nThe present aspect of Glenroy is that of an upper and lower glen opening\r\nup from the larger Glen Spean. The head-waters of Lochaber gather in a\r\nwild mountain tract, near the source of the Spey. The upper glen is an\r\noval valley, four miles long, by about one broad, bounded on each side\r\nby high mountains, which throw off two streams dividing the mica-schist\r\nfrom the gneissic systems; the former predominating on the west side,\r\nand the latter on the east. The united streams flow to the south-west\r\nfor two miles, when the valley contracts to a rocky gorge which\r\nseparates the upper from the lower glen. Passing from the upper to the\r\nlower glen, a line is observed to pass from near the junction of the two\r\nstreams, on a level with a flat rock at the gorge, and also with the\r\nuppermost of the three lines of terraces in the lower glen. This line\r\ngirdles the sides of the hills right and left, with a seemingly higher\r\nsweep, and is followed by two other perfectly parallel and continuous\r\nlines till Glenroy expands into Glen Spean, which crosses its mouth and\r\nenters the great glen a little south of Loch Lochy. At the point,\r\nhowever, where Glenroy enters Glen Spean, the two upper terraces cease,\r\nwhile the lower of the three appears on the north and south side of Glen\r\nSpean, as far as the pass of Glen Muckal, and southward a little way up\r\nthe Gubban river and round the head of Loch Treig.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, and in Northern England and Wales, there is distinct\r\nevidence that the Glacial Epoch commenced with an era of continental\r\nice, the land being but slightly lower than at present, and possibly at\r\nthe same level, during which period the Scottish hills received their\r\nrounded outlines, and scratched and smoothed rock-surfaces; and the\r\nplains and valleys became filled with the stiff clay, with angular\r\nscratched stones, known as the “Till,” which deposit is believed by\r\nMessrs. Geikie, Jamieson, and Croll to be a _moraine profonde_, the\r\nproduct of a vast ice-sheet.\r\n\r\nIn Wales, Professor Ramsay has described the whole of the valleys of the\r\nSnowdonian range as filled with enormous glaciers, the level of the\r\nsurface of the ice filling the Pass of Llanberis, rising 500 feet above\r\nthe present watershed at Gorphwysfa. In the Lake District of Cumberland\r\nand Westmorland, Mr. De Rance has shown that a vast series of glaciers,\r\nor small ice-sheets, filled all the valleys, radiating out in all\r\ndirections from the larger mountains, which formed centres of\r\ndispersion, the ice actually pushing over many of the lesser watersheds,\r\nand scooping out the great rock-basins in which lie the lakes\r\nWindermere, Ullswater, Thirlmere, Coniston Water, and Wastwater, the\r\nbottoms of which are nearly all below the sea-level. The whole of this\r\ndistrict, he has shown, experienced a second glaciation, after the\r\nperiod of great submergence, in which valley-glaciers scooped out the\r\nmarine drift, and left their _moraines_ in the Liza, Langdale, and\r\nother valleys, and high up in the hills, as at Harrison’s Stickle, where\r\na tarn has been formed by a little _moraine_, acting as a dam, as shown\r\nby Professor Hull.\r\n\r\nIn Wales, also, valley-glaciers existed after the submergence beneath\r\nthe Glacial sea. Thus in Cwm-llafar, under the brow of Carnedd Dafydd,\r\nand Carnedd Llewelyn, Professor Ramsay has shown that a narrow glacier,\r\nabout two miles in length, has ploughed out a long narrow hollow in the\r\ndrift (which “forms a succession of terraces, the result of marine\r\ndenudation, during pauses in the re-elevation of its submersion) to a\r\ndepth of more than 2,000 feet.”[108]\r\n\r\n  [108] Professor Ramsay, “The Old Glaciers of North Wales.” Longman,\r\n        1860.\r\n\r\nThe proofs of this great submergence, succeeding the era of “land-ice,”\r\nare constantly accumulating. Since 1863, when Professor Hull first\r\ndivided the thick glacial deposits of Eastern Lancashire and Cheshire\r\ninto an Upper Boulder Clay, and Lower Boulder Clay divided by a Middle\r\nSand and Gravel, the whole of which are of marine origin, these\r\nsubdivisions have been found to hold good, by himself and Mr. A. H.\r\nGreen, over 600 square miles of country around Manchester, Bolton, and\r\nCongleton; by Mr. De Rance over another 600 square miles, around\r\nLiverpool, Preston, Blackpool, Blackburn, and Lancaster, and also in the\r\nlow country lying between the Cumberland and Welsh mountains and the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, also, the same triplex arrangement appears to exist.\r\nProfessors Harkness and Hull have identified the “Limestone and Manure\r\nGravels” of the central plain, as referable to the “Middle Sand and\r\nGravel,” and the “Lower Boulder Clay” rests on a glaciated rock-surface\r\nalong the coasts of Antrim and Down, and is overlain by sand, which, in\r\n1832, was discovered by Dr. Scouler to be shell-bearing. At Kingstown\r\nthe three deposits are seen resting on a moutonnéed surface of granite,\r\nscored from the N.N.W.\r\n\r\nIn Lancashire and on the coast of North Wales, between Llandudno and\r\nRhyl, Mr. De Rance has shown that these deposits often lie upon the\r\ndenuded and eroded surface of another clay, of older date, which he\r\nbelieves to be the product of land-ice, the remnant of the _moraine\r\nprofonde_, and the equivalent of the Scotch “Till.” He also shows that\r\nthe Lower Boulder Clay never rises above an elevation of fifty or eighty\r\nfeet above the sea-level; and that the Middle Sand and Shingle rests\r\ndirectly upon the rock, or on the surface of this old Till.\r\n\r\nNear Manchester the Lower Boulder Clay occasionally rests upon an old\r\nbed of sand and gravel. It is extremely local, but its presence has been\r\nrecorded in several sections by Mr. Edward Binney, who was the first to\r\nshow, in 1842,[109] that the Lancashire Boulder Clays were formed in the\r\nsea, and that the erratic pebbles and boulders, mainly derived from the\r\nCumberland Lake Districts, were brought south by means of floating ice.\r\n\r\n  [109] In 1840 Dr. Buckland described the occurrence of boulders of\r\n        Criffel Granite between Shalbeck and Carlisle, and attributed\r\n        their position to the agency of ice floating across the Solway\r\n        Firth.\r\n\r\nMost of the erratic pebbles and boulders in the Lancashire clays are\r\nmore or less scratched and scored, many of them (though quite rounded)\r\nin so many directions that Mr. De Rance believes the Cumberland and\r\nWestmoreland hills to have been surrounded by an ice-belt, which,\r\noccasionally thawing during summer or warm episodes, admitted “breaker\r\naction” on the gradually subsiding coast, wearing the fragments of rocks\r\nbrought down by rivers or by glaciers into pebbles that, with the return\r\nof the cold, became covered with the “ice-belt,” which, lifted by the\r\ntides, rolled and dinted the pebbles one against another, and gradually\r\nallowed them to be impressed into its mass, with which they eventually\r\nfloated away.\r\n\r\nThe Middle Sands and Shingles in England have also afforded a great\r\nnumber of shells of mollusca. At Macclesfield they have been described\r\nby Messrs. Prestwich and Darbishire as occurring at an elevation of\r\n1,100 to 1,200 feet above the level of the sea.[110]\r\n\r\n  [110] Mr. Darbishire records seventy species from Macclesfield and\r\n        Moel Tryfaen, taken together, of which 6 are Arctic, and 18 are\r\n        not known in the Upper Crag.\r\n\r\nAmong other proofs of glacial action and submersion in Wales may be\r\nmentioned the case of Moel Tryfaen, a hill 1,400 feet high, lying to the\r\nwestward of Caernarvon Bay, and six or seven miles from Caernarvon. Mr.\r\nJoshua Trimmer had observed stratified drift near the summit of this\r\nmountain, from which he obtained some marine shells; but doubts were\r\nentertained as to their age until 1863, when a deep and extensive\r\ncutting was made in search of slates. In this cutting a stratified mass\r\nof loose sand and gravel was laid open near the summit, thirty-five feet\r\nthick, containing shells, some entire, but mostly in fragments. Sir\r\nCharles Lyell examined the cutting, and obtained twenty species of\r\nshells, and in the lower beds of the drift, “large heavy boulders of\r\nfar-transported rocks, glacially polished and scratched on more than one\r\nside:” underneath the whole, the edges of vertical slates were exposed\r\nto view, exhibiting “unequivocal marks of prolonged glaciation.” The\r\nshells belonged to species still living in British or more northern\r\nseas.\r\n\r\nFrom the gravels of the Severn Valley, described by Mr. Maw, thirty-five\r\nforms of mollusca have been identified by Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys. In the\r\nShingle beds of Leyland, Euxton, Chorley, Preston, Lancaster, and\r\nBlackpool,[111] Mr. De Rance has obtained nearly thirty species.\r\n\r\n  [111] The typical species in West Lancashire are _Tellina Balthica_,\r\n        _Cardium edule_, _C. aculeatum_, _C. rusticum_, _Psammobia\r\n        ferroensis_, _Turritella terebra_.\r\n\r\nIn Eastern Yorkshire, Mr. Searles V. Wood, Jun., has divided the glacial\r\ndeposits into “Purple Clay without Chalk,” “Purple Clay with Chalk,” and\r\n“Chalky Clay,” the whole being later than his “Middle Glacial Sands and\r\nGravel,” which, in East Anglia, are overlain by the “Chalky Clay,” and\r\nrest unconformably upon the “Contorted Drift” of Norfolk, the Cromer\r\nTill, and the Forest Bed. His three Yorkshire clays are, however,\r\nconsidered by most northern geologists to be the representatives of the\r\n“Upper Boulder Clay” west of the Pennine Chain, the “Chalky Clay” having\r\nbeen formed before the country had sufficiently subsided to allow the\r\nsandstones and marls, furnishing the red colouring matter, to have\r\nsuffered denudation; while the “Purple Clay without Chalk, and with Shap\r\nGranite,” was deposited when all the chalk was mainly beneath the sea,\r\nand the granite from Shap Fell, which had been broken up by\r\nbreaker-action during the Middle Sand era, was floated across the passes\r\nof the Pennine Chain and southwards and northwards. A solitary pebble of\r\nShap granite has been found by Mr. De Rance at Hoylake, in Cheshire; and\r\nmany of Criffel Granite, in that county, and on the coast of North\r\nWales, by Mr. Mackintosh, who has also traced the flow of this granite\r\nin the low country lying north and south of the Cumberland mountains.\r\n\r\nAt Bridlington, in Yorkshire, occurs a deposit at the base of the\r\n“Purple Clay,” with a truly Arctic fauna. Out of seventy forms of\r\nmollusca recorded by Mr. S. V. Wood, Jun., nineteen are unknown to the\r\nCrag--of these thirteen are purely arctic, and two not known as living.\r\n\r\nShells have been found in the Upper Boulder Clay of Lancashire, at\r\nHollingworth Reservoir, near Mottram, by Messrs. Binney, Bateman, and\r\nPrestwich, at an elevation of 568 feet above the sea, consisting of\r\n_Fusus Bamffius_, _Purpura lapillus_, _Turritilla terebra_, and _Cardium\r\nedule_. The clay is described by Mr. Binney as sandy, and\r\nbrown-coloured, with pebbles of granite and greenstone, some rounded and\r\nsome angular. All the above shells, as well as _Tellina Balthica_, have\r\nbeen found in the Upper Clay of Preston, Garstang, Blackpool, and\r\nLlandudno, by Mr. De Rance, who has also found all the above species\r\n(with the exception of _Fusus_), as well as _Psammobia ferroensis_, and\r\nthe siliceous spiculæ of marine sponges, in the Lower Boulder Clay of\r\nWest Lancashire. He has described the ordinary red Boulder Clay of\r\nLancashire as extending continuously through Cheshire and Staffordshire\r\ninto Warwickshire, gradually becoming less red and more chalky,\r\neverywhere overlying intermittent sheets of “sands and shingle-beds,”\r\none of which is particularly well seen at Leamington and Warwick, where\r\nit contains Pectens from the Crag, _Gryphæa_ from the Lias, and chalk\r\nfossils and flints. The latter have also been found by Mr. Lucy in the\r\nneighbourhood of Mount Sorrel, associated with bits of the Coral Rag of\r\nYorkshire. The gravels of Leicester, Market Harborough, and Lutterworth\r\nwere long ago described by the Rev. W. D. Conybeare as affording\r\n“specimens of the organic remains of most of the Secondary Strata in\r\nEngland.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. O. Fisher, F.G.S., has paid much attention to the superficial\r\ncovering usually described as “heading,” or “drift,” as well as to the\r\ncontour of the surface, in districts composed of the softer strata, and\r\nhas published his views in various papers in the _Journal of the\r\nGeological Society_ and in the _Geological Magazine_. He thinks that the\r\ncontour of the surface cannot be ascribed entirely to the action of rain\r\nand rivers, but that the changes in the ancient contour since produced\r\nby those changes can be easily distinguished. He finds the covering beds\r\nto consist of two members--a lower one, entirely destitute of organic\r\nremains, and generally unstratified, which has often been forcibly\r\nindented into the bed beneath it, sometimes exhibiting slickenside at\r\nthe junction.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence of this lower member having been pushed or dragged\r\nover the surface, from higher to lower levels, in a plastic condition;\r\non which account he has named it “The Trail.”\r\n\r\nThe upper member of the covering beds consists of soil derived from the\r\nlower one, by weathering. It contains, here and there, the remains of\r\nthe land-shells which lived in the locality at a period antecedent to\r\ncultivation. It is “The Warp” of Mr. Trimmer.\r\n\r\nNeither of these accumulations occur on low flats, where the surface has\r\nbeen modified since the recent period. They both alike pass below\r\nhigh-water mark, and have been noticed beneath estuarine deposits.\r\n\r\nMr. Fisher is of opinion that land-ice has been instrumental in forming\r\nthe contour of the surface, and that the trail is the remnant of its\r\n_moraine profonde_. And he has given reasons[112] for believing that the\r\nclimate of those latitudes may have been sufficiently rigorous for that\r\nresult about 100,000 years ago. He attributes the formation of the\r\nsuperficial covering of Warp to a period of much rainfall and severe\r\nwinter-frosts, after the ice-sheet had disappeared.\r\n\r\n  [112] _Geological Magazine_, vol. iii., p. 483.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena which so powerfully affected our hemisphere present\r\nthemselves, in a much grander manner, in the New World. The\r\nglacier-system appears to have taken in America the same gigantic\r\nproportions which other objects assume there. Nor is it necessary, in\r\norder to explain the permanent existence of this icy mantle in temperate\r\nclimates, to infer the prevalence of any very extraordinary degree of\r\ncold. On this subject M. Ch. Martins thus expresses himself: “The mean\r\ntemperature of Geneva is 9° 5 Cent. Upon the surrounding mountains the\r\nlimit of perpetual snow is found at 8,800 feet above the level of the\r\nsea. The great glaciers of the valley of Chamounix descend 5,000 feet\r\nbelow this line. Thus situated, let us suppose that the mean temperature\r\nof Geneva was lowered only 4°, and the average became 5° 5; the decrease\r\nof temperature with the height being 1° c. for every 600 feet, the limit\r\nof perpetual snow would be lowered by 2,437 feet, and would be 6,363\r\nfeet above the level of the sea. We can readily admit that the glaciers\r\nof Chamounix would descend below this new limit, to an extent at least\r\nequal to that which exists between their present limit and their lower\r\nextremity. Now, in reality, the foot of these glaciers is 5,000 feet\r\nabove the ocean; with a climate 4° colder, it would be 2,437 feet lower;\r\nthat is to say, at the level of the Swiss plain. Thus, the lowering of\r\nthe line of perpetual snow to this extent would suffice to bring the\r\nglacier of the Arve to the environs of Geneva.... Of the climate which\r\nhas favoured the prodigious development of glaciers we have a pretty\r\ncorrect idea; it is that of Upsala, Stockholm, Christiana, and part of\r\nNorth America, in the State of New York.... To diminish by four degrees\r\nthe mean temperature of a country in order to explain one of the\r\ngrandest revolutions of the globe, is to venture on an hypothesis not\r\nbolder than geology has sometimes permitted to itself.”[113]\r\n\r\n  [113] _Revue des Deux Mondes._\r\n\r\nIn proving that glaciers covered part of Europe during a certain period,\r\nthat they extended from the North Pole to Northern Italy and the Danube,\r\nwe have sufficiently established the reality of this _glacial period_,\r\nwhich we must consider as a curious episode, as well as certain, in the\r\nhistory of the earth. Such masses of ice could only have covered the\r\nearth when the temperature of the air was lowered at least some degrees\r\nbelow zero. But organic life is incompatible with such a temperature;\r\nand to this cause must we attribute the disappearance of certain species\r\nof animals and plants--in particular, the Rhinoceros and the\r\nElephant--which, before this sudden and extraordinary cooling of the\r\nglobe, appear to have limited themselves, in immense herds, to Northern\r\nEurope, and chiefly to Siberia, where their remains have been found in\r\nsuch prodigious quantities. Cuvier says, speaking of the bodies of the\r\nquadrupeds which the ice had seized, and in which they have been\r\npreserved, with their hair, flesh, and skin, up to our own times: “If\r\nthey had not been frozen as soon as killed, putrefaction would have\r\ndecomposed them; and, on the other hand, this eternal frost could not\r\nhave previously prevailed in the place where they died; for they could\r\nnot have lived in such a temperature. It was, therefore, at the same\r\ninstant when these animals perished that the country they inhabited was\r\nrendered glacial. These events must have been sudden, instantaneous, and\r\nwithout any gradation.”[114]\r\n\r\n  [114] “Ossements fossiles. Discours sur les Révolutions du Globe.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 199.--Fissurella nembosa.\r\n\r\n(Living shell.)]\r\n\r\nHow can we explain the _glacial period_? We have explained M. Adhémar’s\r\nhypothesis, to which it may be objected that the cold of the glacial\r\nperiod was so general throughout the Polar and temperate regions on both\r\nsides of the equator, that mere local changes in the external\r\nconfiguration of our planet and displacement of the centre of gravity\r\nscarcely afford adequate causes for so great a revolution in\r\ntemperature. Sir Charles Lyell, speculating upon the suggestion of\r\nRitter and the discovery of marine shells spread far and wide over the\r\nSahara Desert by Messrs. Escher von der Linth, Desor, and Martins--which\r\nseem to prove that the African Desert has been under water at a very\r\nrecent period--infers that the Desert of Sahara constituted formerly a\r\nwide marine area, stretching several hundred miles north and south, and\r\neast and west. “From this area,” he adds, “the south wind must formerly\r\nhave absorbed moisture, and must have been still further cooled and\r\nsaturated with aqueous vapour as it passed over the Mediterranean. When\r\nat length it reached the Alps, and, striking them, was driven into the\r\nhigher and more rarefied regions of the atmosphere, it would part with\r\nits watery burthen in the form of snow; so that the same aërial current\r\nwhich, under the name of the Föhn, or Sirocco, now plays a leading part\r\nwith its hot and dry breath, sometimes, even in the depth of winter, in\r\nmelting the snow and checking the growth of glaciers, must, at the\r\nperiod alluded to, have been the principal feeder of Alpine snow and\r\nice.”[115] Nevertheless, we repeat, no explanation presents itself which\r\ncan be considered conclusive; and in science we should never be afraid\r\nto say, _I do not know_.\r\n\r\n  [115] Lyell’s “Elements of Geology,” p. 175.\r\n\r\n\r\nCREATION OF MAN AND THE ASIATIC DELUGE.\r\n\r\nIt was only after the glacial period, when the earth had resumed its\r\nnormal temperature, that man was created. Whence came he?\r\n\r\nHe came from whence originated the first blade of grass which grew upon\r\nthe burning rocks of the Silurian seas; from whence proceeded the\r\ndifferent races of animals which have successively replaced each other\r\nupon the globe, gradually, but unceasingly, rising in the scale of\r\nperfection. He emanated from the supreme will of the Author of the\r\nworlds which constitute the universe.\r\n\r\nThe earth has passed through many phases since the time when--in the\r\nwords of the Sacred Record--“the earth was without form and void; and\r\ndarkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon\r\nthe face of the waters.” We have considered all these phases; we have\r\nseen the globe floating in space in a state of gaseous nebulosity,\r\ncondensing into liquidity, and beginning to solidify at the surface. We\r\nhave pictured the internal agitations, the disturbances, the partial\r\ndislocations to which the earth has been subjected, almost without\r\ninterruption, while it could not, as yet, resist the force of the waves\r\nof the fiery sea imprisoned within its fragile crust. We have seen this\r\nenvelope acquiring solidity, and the geological cataclysms losing their\r\nintensity and frequency in proportion as this solid crust increased in\r\nthickness. We have looked on, so to speak, while the work of organic\r\ncreation was proceeding. We have seen life making its appearance upon\r\nthe globe; and the first plants and animals springing into existence. We\r\nhave seen this organic creation multiplying, becoming more complex, and\r\nconstantly made more perfect with each advance in the progressive phases\r\nof the history of the earth. We now arrive at the greatest event of this\r\nhistory, at the crowning of the edifice, _si parva licet componere\r\nmagnis_.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Tertiary epoch, the continents and seas assumed the\r\nrespective limits which they now present. The disturbances of the\r\nground, the fractures of the earth’s crust, and the volcanic eruptions\r\nwhich are the consequence of them, only occurred at rare intervals,\r\noccasioning only local and restricted disasters. The rivers and their\r\naffluents flowed between tranquil banks. Animated Nature is that of our\r\nown days. An abundant vegetation, diversified by the existence of a\r\nclimate which has now been acquired, embellishes the earth. A multitude\r\nof animals inhabit the waters, the dry land, and the air. Nevertheless,\r\ncreation has not yet achieved its greatest work--a being capable of\r\ncomprehending these marvels and of admiring the sublime work--a soul is\r\nwanting to adore and give thanks to the Creator.\r\n\r\nGod created man.\r\n\r\nWhat is man?\r\n\r\nWe might say that man is an intelligent and moral being; but this would\r\ngive a very imperfect idea of his nature. Franklin says that man is one\r\nthat can make tools! This is to reproduce a portion of the first\r\nproposition, while depreciating it. Aristotle calls man the “wise\r\nbeing,” ζωον πολιτικον. Linnæus, in his “System of Nature,” after having\r\napplied to man the epithet of wise (_homo sapiens_) writes after this\r\ngeneric title these profound words: _Nosce te ipsum_. The French\r\nnaturalist and philosopher, Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, says, “The\r\nplant _lives_, the animal _lives and feels_, man _lives, feels, and\r\nthinks_”--a sentiment which Voltaire had already expressed. “The Eternal\r\nMaker,” says the philosopher of Ferney, “has given to man organisation,\r\nsentiment, and intelligence; to the animals sentiment, and what we call\r\ninstinct; to vegetables organisation alone. His power then acts\r\ncontinually upon these three kingdoms.” It is probably the animal which\r\nis here depreciated. The animal on many occasions undoubtedly thinks,\r\nreasons, deliberates with itself, and acts in virtue of a decision\r\nmaturely weighed; it is not then reduced to mere sensation.\r\n\r\nTo define exactly the human being, we believe that it is necessary to\r\ncharacterise the nature and extent of his intelligence. In certain cases\r\nthe intelligence of the animal approaches nearly to that of man, but the\r\nlatter is endowed with a certain faculty which belongs to him\r\nexclusively; in creating him, God has added an entirely new step in the\r\nascending scale of animated beings. This faculty, peculiar to the human\r\nrace, is _abstraction_. We will say, then, that man is an _intelligent_\r\nbeing, gifted with the faculty of comprehending the _abstract_.\r\n\r\nIt is by this faculty that man is raised to a pre-eminent degree of\r\nmaterial and moral power. By it he has subdued the earth to his empire,\r\nand by it also his mind rises to the most sublime contemplations. Thanks\r\nto this faculty, man has conceived the ideal, and realised poesy. He has\r\nconceived the infinite, and created mathematics. Such is the\r\ndistinction which separates the human race so widely from the\r\nanimals--which makes him a creation apart and absolutely new upon the\r\nglobe. A being capable of comprehending the ideal and the infinite, of\r\ncreating poetry and algebra, such is man! To invent and understand this\r\nformula--\r\n\r\n  (_a_ + _b_)² = _a_² + 2_ab_ + _b_²,\r\n\r\nor the algebraic idea of negative quantities, this belongs to man. It is\r\nthe greatest privilege of the human being to express and comprehend\r\nthoughts like the following:\r\n\r\n    J’étais seul près des flots, par une nuit d’étoiles,\r\n    Pas un nuage aux cieux, sur les mers pas de voiles,\r\n    Mes yeux plongeaient plus loin que le monde réel,\r\n    Et les vents et les mers, et toute la nature\r\n    Semblaient interroger dans un confus murmure,\r\n        Les flots des mers, les feux du ciel.\r\n\r\n    Et les étoiles d’or, légions infinies,\r\n    À voix haute, à voix basse, avec mille harmonies\r\n    Disaient, en inclinant leur couronne de feu;\r\n    Et les flots bleus, que rien ne gouverne et n’arrête:\r\n    Disaient, en recourbant l’écume de leur crête:\r\n          “C’est le Seigneur, le Seigneur Dieu!”*\r\n\r\nVICTOR HUGO, _les Orientales_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    * Alone with the waves, on a starry night,\r\n      My thoughts far away in the infinite;\r\n      On the sea not a sail, not a cloud in the sky,\r\n      And the wind and the waves with sweet lullaby\r\n      Seem to question in murmurs of mystery,\r\n          The fires of heaven, the waves of the sea.\r\n\r\n      And the golden stars of the heavens rose higher,\r\n      Harmoniously blending their crowns of fire,\r\n      And the waves which no ruling hand may know,\r\n      ‘Midst a thousand murmurs, now high, now low,\r\n      Sing, while curving their foaming crests to the sea,\r\n            “It is the Lord God! It is He.”\r\n\r\nThe “Mécanique Céleste” of Laplace, the “Principia” of Newton, Milton’s\r\n“Paradise Lost,” the “Orientales” by Victor Hugo--are the fruits of the\r\n_faculty of abstraction_.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1800, a being, half savage, who lived in the woods,\r\nclambered up the trees, slept upon dried leaves, and fled on the\r\napproach of men, was brought to a physician named Pinel. Some\r\nsportsmen had found him; he had no voice, and was devoid of\r\nintelligence; he was known as the little savage of Aveyron. The Parisian\r\n_savants_ for a long time disputed over this strange individual. Was it\r\nan ape?--was it a wild man?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXXII.--Appearance of Man.]\r\n\r\nThe learned Dr. Itard has published an interesting history of the savage\r\nof Aveyron. “He would sometimes descend,” he writes, “into the garden of\r\nthe deaf and dumb, and seat himself upon the edge of the fountain,\r\npreserving his balance by rocking himself to and fro; after a time his\r\nbody became quite still, and his face assumed an expression of profound\r\nmelancholy. He would remain thus for hours--regarding attentively the\r\nsurface of the water--upon which he would, from time to time, throw\r\nblades of grass and dried leaves. At night, when the clear moonlight\r\npenetrated into the chamber he occupied, he rarely failed to rise and\r\nplace himself at the window, where he would remain part of the night,\r\nerect, motionless, his neck stretched out, his eyes fixed upon the\r\nlandscape lit up by the moon, lost in a sort of ecstasy of\r\ncontemplation.” This being was, undoubtedly, a man. No ape ever\r\nexhibited such signs of intelligence, such dreamy manifestations, vague\r\nconceptions of the ideal--in other words, that faculty of _abstraction_\r\nwhich belongs to humanity alone. In order worthily to introduce the new\r\ninhabitant who comes to fill the earth with his presence--who brings\r\nwith him intelligence to comprehend, to admire, to subdue, and to rule\r\nthe creation (PL. XXXII.), we require nothing more than the grand and\r\nsimple language of Moses, whom Bossuet calls “the most ancient of\r\nhistorians, the most sublime of philosophers, the wisest of\r\nlegislators.” Let us listen to the words of the inspired writer: “And\r\nGod said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them\r\nhave dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air,\r\nand over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping\r\nthing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his _own_\r\nimage, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, _it was_ very\r\ngood.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVolumes have been written upon the question of the unity of the human\r\nrace; that is, whether there were many centres of the creation of man,\r\nor whether our race is derived solely from the Adam of Scripture. We\r\nthink, with many naturalists, that the stock of humanity is unique, and\r\nthat the different human races, the negroes, and the yellow race, are\r\nonly the result of the influence of climate upon organisation. We\r\nconsider the human race as having appeared for the first time (the mode\r\nof his creation being veiled in Divine mystery, eternally impenetrable\r\nto us) in the rich plains of Asia, on the smiling banks of the\r\nEuphrates, as the traditions of the most ancient races teach us. It is\r\nthere, where Nature is so rich and vigorous, in the brilliant climate\r\nand under the radiant sky of Asia, in the shade of its luxuriant masses\r\nof verdure and its mild and perfumed atmosphere, that man loves to\r\nrepresent to himself the father of his race as issuing from the hand of\r\nhis Creator.\r\n\r\nWe are, it will be seen, far from sharing the opinion of those\r\nnaturalists who represent man, at the beginning of the existence of his\r\nspecies, as a sort of ape, of hideous face, degraded mien, and covered\r\nwith hair, inhabiting caves like the bears and lions, and participating\r\nin the brutal instincts of those savage animals.[116] There is no doubt\r\nthat early man passed through a period in which he had to contend for\r\nhis existence with ferocious beasts, and to live in a primitive state in\r\nthe woods or savannahs, where Providence had placed him. But this period\r\nof probation came to an end, and man, an eminently social being, by\r\ncombining in groups, animated by the same interests and the same\r\ndesires, soon found means to intimidate the animals, to triumph over the\r\nelements, to protect himself from the innumerable perils which\r\nsurrounded him, and to subdue to his rule the other inhabitants of the\r\nearth. “The first men,” says Buffon, “witnesses of the convulsive\r\nmovements of the earth, still recent and frequent, having only the\r\nmountains for refuge from the inundations; and often driven from this\r\nasylum by volcanoes and earthquakes, which trembled under their feet;\r\nuneducated, naked, and exposed to the elements, victims to the fury of\r\nferocious animals, whose prey they were certain to become; impressed\r\nalso with a common sentiment of gloomy terror, and urged by necessity,\r\nwould they not unite, first, to defend themselves by numbers, and then\r\nto assist each other by working in concert, to make habitations and\r\narms? They began by shaping into the forms of hatchets these hard\r\nflints, the Jade, and other stones, which were supposed to have been\r\nformed by thunder and fallen from the clouds, but which are,\r\nnevertheless, only the first examples of man’s art in a pure state of\r\nNature. He will soon draw fire from these same flints, by striking them\r\nagainst each other; he will seize the flames of the burning volcano, or\r\nprofit by the fire of the red-hot lava to light his fire of brushwood in\r\nthe forest; and by the help of this powerful element he cleanses,\r\npurifies, and renders wholesome the place he selects for his habitation.\r\nWith his hatchet of stone he chops wood, fells trees, shapes timber, and\r\nputs it together, fashions instruments of warfare and the most necessary\r\ntools and implements; and after having furnished themselves with clubs\r\nand other weighty and defensive arms, did not these first men find means\r\nto make lighter weapons to reach the swift-footed stag from afar? A\r\ntendon of an animal, a fibre of the aloe-leaf, or the supple bark of\r\nsome ligneous plant, would serve as a cord to bring together the two\r\nextremities of an elastic branch of yew, forming a bow; and small\r\nflints, shaped to a point, arm the arrow. They will soon have snares,\r\nrafts, and canoes; they will form themselves into communities composed\r\nof a few families, or rather of relations sprung from the same family,\r\nas is still the case with some savage tribes, who have their game, fish,\r\nand fruits in common. But in all those countries whose area is limited\r\nby water, or surrounded by high mountains, these small nations, becoming\r\ntoo numerous, have been in time forced to parcel out the land between\r\nthem; and from that moment the earth has become the domain of man; he\r\nhas taken possession of it by his labour, he has cultivated it, and\r\nattachment to the soil follows the very first act of possession; the\r\nprivate interest makes part of the national interest; order,\r\ncivilisation, and laws succeed, and society acquires force and\r\nconsistency.”[117] We love to quote the sentiments of a great\r\nwriter--but how much more eloquent would the words of the naturalist\r\nhave been, if he had added to his own grand eloquence of language, the\r\nknowledge which science has placed within reach of the writers of the\r\npresent time--- if he could have painted man in the early days of his\r\ncreation, in presence of the immense animal population which then\r\noccupied the earth, and fighting with the wild beasts which filled the\r\nforests of the ancient world! Man, comparatively very weak in\r\norganisation, destitute of natural weapons of attack or defence,\r\nincapable of rising into the air like the birds, or living under water\r\nlike the fishes and some reptiles, might seem doomed to speedy\r\ndestruction. But he was marked on the forehead with the Divine seal.\r\nThanks to the superior gift of an exceptional intelligence, this being,\r\nin appearance so helpless, has by degrees swept the most ferocious of\r\nits occupants from the earth, leaving those only who cater to his wants\r\nor desires, or by whose aid he changes the primitive aspects of whole\r\ncontinents.\r\n\r\n  [116] It is told of a former distinguished and witty member of the\r\n        Geological Society that, having obtained possession of the rooms\r\n        on a certain day, when there was to be a general meeting, he\r\n        decorated its walls with a series of cartoons, in which the\r\n        parts of the members were strangely reversed. In one cartoon\r\n        Ichthyosauri and Plesiosauri were occupied with the skeleton of\r\n        Homo sapiens; in another, a party of Crustaceans were occupied\r\n        with a cranium suspiciously like the same species; while in a\r\n        third, a party of Pterichthys were about to dine on a biped with\r\n        a suspicious resemblance to a certain well-conditioned F.G.S. of\r\n        the day.\r\n\r\n  [117] “Époques de la Nature,” vol. xii., pp. 322-325. 18mo. Paris,\r\n        1778.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of man is a question which has largely engaged the\r\nattention of geologists, and many ingenious arguments have been\r\nhazarded, tending to prove that the human race and the great extinct\r\nMammalia were contemporaneous. The circumstances bearing on the question\r\nare usually ranged under three series of facts: 1. The Cave-deposits; 2.\r\nPeat and shell mounds; 3. Lacustrine habitations, or Lake dwellings.\r\n\r\nWe have already briefly touched upon the Cave-deposits. In the Kirkdale\r\nCave no remains or other traces of man’s presence seem to have been\r\ndiscovered. But in Kent’s Hole, an unequal deposit of loam and clay,\r\nalong with broken bones much gnawed, and the teeth of both extinct and\r\nliving Mammals, implements evidently fashioned by the human hand were\r\nfound in the following order: in the upper part of the clay,\r\nartificially-shaped flints; on the clay rested a layer of stalagmite, in\r\nwhich streaks of burnt charcoal occurred, and charred bones of existing\r\nspecies of animals. Above the stalagmite a stone hatchet, or celt, made\r\nof syenite, of more finished appearance, was met with, with articles of\r\nbone, round pieces of blue slate and sandstone-grit, pieces of pottery,\r\na number of shells of the mussel, limpet, and oyster, and other remains,\r\nCeltic, British, and Roman, of very early date; the lower deposits are\r\nthose with which we are here more particularly concerned. The Rev. J.\r\nMacEnery, the gentleman who explored and described them, ascertained\r\nthat the flint-instruments occupied a uniform situation intermediate\r\nbetween the stalagmite and the upper surface of the loam, forming a\r\nconnecting link between both; and his opinion was that the epoch of the\r\nintroduction of the knives must be dated antecedently to the formation\r\nof the stalagmite, from the era of the quiescent settlement of the mud.\r\nFrom this view it would follow that the cave was visited posteriorly to\r\nthe introduction and subsidence of the loam, and before the formation of\r\nthe new super-stratum of stalagmite, by men who entered the cave and\r\ndisturbed the original deposit. Although flints have been found in the\r\nloam underlying the regular crust of stalagmite, mingled confusedly with\r\nthe bones, and unconnected with the evidence of the visits of man--such\r\nas the excavation of ovens or pits--Dr. Buckland refused his belief to\r\nthe statement that the flint-implements were found beneath the\r\nstalagmite, and always contended that they were the work of men of a\r\nmore recent period, who had broken up the sparry floor. The doctor\r\nsupposed that the ancient Britons had scooped out ovens in the\r\nstalagmite, and that through them the knives got admission to the\r\nunderlying loam, and that in this confused state the several materials\r\nwere cemented together.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 Dr. Falconer heard of the newly-discovered cave at Brixham, on\r\nthe opposite side of the bay to Torquay, and he took steps to prevent\r\nany doubts being entertained with regard to its contents. This cave was\r\ncomposed of several passages, with four entrances, formerly blocked up\r\nwith breccia and earthy matter; the main opening being ascertained by\r\nMr. Bristow to be seventy-eight feet above the valley, and ninety-five\r\nfeet above the sea, the cave itself being in some places eight feet\r\nwide. The contents of the cave were covered with a layer of stalagmite,\r\nfrom one to fifteen inches thick, on the top of which were found the\r\nhorns of a Reindeer; under the stalagmite came reddish loam or\r\ncave-earth, with pebbles and some angular stones, from two to thirteen\r\nfeet thick, containing the bones of Elephants, Rhinoceros, Bears,\r\nHyænas, Felis, Reindeer, Horses, Oxen, and several Rodents; and, lastly,\r\na layer of gravel, and rounded pebbles without fossils, underlaid the\r\ncave-earth and formed the lowest deposit.\r\n\r\nIn these beds no human bones were found, but in almost every part of the\r\nbone-bed were flint-knives, one of the most perfect being found thirteen\r\nfeet down in the bone-bed, at its lowest part. The most remarkable fact\r\nin connection with this cave was the discovery of an entire left\r\nhind-leg of the Cave-bear lying in close proximity to this knife; “not\r\nwashed in a fossil state out of an older alluvium, and swept afterwards\r\ninto this cave, so as to be mingled with the flint implements, but\r\nhaving been introduced when clothed in its flesh.” The implement and the\r\nBear’s leg were evidently deposited about the same time, and it only\r\nrequired some approximative estimate of the date of this deposit, to\r\nsettle the question of the antiquity of man, at least in an affirmative\r\nsense.\r\n\r\nMr. H. W. Bristow, who was sent by the Committee of the Royal Society to\r\nmake a plan and drawings of the Brixham Cave, found that its entrance\r\nwas situated at a height of ninety-five feet above the present level of\r\nthe sea. In his Report made to the Royal Society, in explanation of the\r\nplan and sections, Mr. Bristow stated that, in all probability, at the\r\ntime the cave was formed, the land was at a lower level to the extent of\r\nthe observed distance of ninety-five feet, and that its mouth was then\r\nsituated at or near the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe cave consisted of wide galleries or passages running in a north and\r\nsouth direction, with minor lateral passages branching off nearly at\r\nright angles to the main openings--- the whole cave being formed in the\r\njoints, or natural divisional planes, of the rock.\r\n\r\nThe mouth or entrance to the cave originated, in the first instance, in\r\nan open joint or fissure in the Devonian limestone, which became widened\r\nby water flowing backwards and forwards, and was partly enlarged by the\r\natmospheric water, which percolated through the cracks, fissures, and\r\nopen joints in the overlying rock. The pebbles, forming the lowest\r\ndeposit in the cave, were ordinary shingle or beach-gravel, washed in by\r\nthe waves and tides. The cave-earth was the residual part of the\r\nlimestone rock, after the calcareous portion had been dissolved and\r\ncarried away in solution; and the stalactite and stalagmite were derived\r\nfrom the lime deposited from the percolating water.\r\n\r\nWith regard to bone-caves generally, it would seem that, like other such\r\nopenings, they are most common in limestone rocks, where they have been\r\nformed by water, which has dissolved and carried away the calcareous\r\ningredient of the rock. In the case of the Brixham cave, the mode of\r\naction of the water could be clearly traced in two ways: first, in\r\nwidening out the principal passages by the rush of water backwards and\r\nforwards from the sea; and, secondly, by the infiltration and\r\npercolation of atmospheric water through the overlying rock. In both\r\ncases the active agents in producing the cave had taken advantage of a\r\npre-existing fissure or crack, or an open joint, which they gradually\r\nenlarged and widened out, until the opening received its final\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nThe cave presented no appearance of ever having been inhabited by man;\r\nor of having been the den of Hyænas or other animals, like Wookey Hole\r\nin the Mendips, and some other bone-caves. The most probable supposition\r\nis, that the hind quarter of the Bear and other bones which were found\r\nin the cave-earth, had been washed into the cave by the sea, in which\r\nthey were floating about.\r\n\r\nWe draw some inferences of the greatest interest and significance from\r\nthe Brixham cave and its contents.\r\n\r\nWe learn that this country was, at one time, inhabited by animals which\r\nare now extinct, and of whose existence we have not even a tradition;\r\nthat man, then ignorant of the use of metal, and little better than the\r\nbrutes, was the contemporary of the animals whose remains were found in\r\nthe cave, together with a rude flint-implement--the only kind of weapon\r\nwith which our savage ancestor defended himself against animals scarcely\r\nwilder than himself.\r\n\r\nWe also learn that after the cave had been formed and sealed up again,\r\nas it were, together with all its contents, by the deposition of a solid\r\ncrust of stalagmite--an operation requiring a very great length of time\r\nto effect--the Reindeer (_Cervus Tarandus_) was indigenous to this\r\ncountry, as is proved by the occurrence of an antler of that animal\r\nwhich was found lying upon, and partly imbedded in, the stalagmite\r\nforming the roof or uppermost, that is, the latest formed, of the\r\ncave-deposits.\r\n\r\nLastly, we learn that, at the time the cave was formed, and while the\r\nland was inhabited by man, that part of the country was lower by\r\nninety-five feet than it is now; and that this elevation has probably\r\nbeen produced so slowly and so gradually, as to have been imperceptible\r\nduring the time it was taking place, which extended over a vast interval\r\nof time, perhaps over thousands of years.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may not be out of place here to describe the mode of\r\nformation of bone-caves generally, and the causes which have produced\r\nthe appearances these now present.\r\n\r\nCaves in limestone rocks have two principal phases--one of formation,\r\nand one of filling up. So long as the water which enters the cavities in\r\nthe course of formation, and carries off some of the calcareous matter\r\nin solution, can find an easy exit, the cavity is continually enlarged;\r\nbut when, from various causes, the water only enters in small\r\nquantities, and does not escape, or only finds its way out slowly, and\r\nwith difficulty, the lime, instead of being removed, is re-deposited on\r\nthe walls, roof, sides, and floor of the cavity, in the form of\r\nstalactites and stalagmite, and the work of re-filling with solid\r\ncarbonate of lime then takes place.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the Brixham discoveries, a congress of French and English\r\ngeologists met at Amiens, in order to consider certain evidence, on\r\nwhich it was sought to establish as a fact that man and the Mammoth were\r\nformerly contemporaries.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Somme, between Abbeville and Amiens, is occupied by\r\nbeds of peat, some twenty or thirty feet deep, resting on a thin bed of\r\nclay which covers other beds, of sand and gravel, and itself rests on\r\nwhite Chalk with flints. Bordering the valley, some hills rise with a\r\ngentle slope to a height of 200 or 300 feet, and here and there, on\r\ntheir summits, are patches of Tertiary sand and clay, with fossils, and\r\nagain more extensive layers of loam. The inference from this geological\r\nstructure is that the river, originally flowing through the Tertiary\r\nformation, gradually cut its way through the various strata down to its\r\npresent level. From the depth of the peat, its lower part lies below the\r\nsea-level, and it is supposed that a depression of the region has\r\noccurred at some period: again, in land lying quite low on the\r\nAbbeville side of the valley, but above the tidal level, marine shells\r\noccur, which indicate an elevation of the region; again, about 100 feet\r\nabove the valley, on the right bank of the river, and on a sloping\r\nsurface, is the Moulin-Quignon, where shallow pits exhibit a floor of\r\nchalk covered by gravel and sand, accompanied by gravel and marly chalk\r\nand flints more or less worn, well-rounded Tertiary flints and pebbles,\r\nand fragments of Tertiary sandstone. Such is the general description of\r\na locality which has acquired considerable celebrity in connection with\r\nthe question of the antiquity of man.\r\n\r\nThe Quaternary deposits of Moulin-Quignon and the peat-beds of the Somme\r\nformerly furnished Cuvier with some of the fossils he described, and in\r\nlater times chipped flint-implements from the quarries and bogs came\r\ninto the possession of M. Boucher de Perthes; the statements were\r\nreceived at first not without suspicion--especially on the part of\r\nEnglish geologists who were familiar with similar attempts on their own\r\ncredulity--that some at least of these were manufactured by the workmen\r\nof the district. At length, the discovery of a human jaw and tooth in\r\nthe gravel-pits of St. Acheul, near Amiens, produced a rigorous\r\ninvestigation into the facts, and it seems to have been established to\r\nthe satisfaction of Mr. Prestwich and his colleagues, that\r\nflint-implements and the bones of extinct Mammalia are met with in the\r\nsame beds, and in situations indicating very great antiquity. In the\r\nsloping and irregular deposits overlooking the Somme, the bones of\r\nElephants, Rhinoceros, with land and fresh-water shells of existing\r\nspecies, are found mingled with flint-implements. Shells like those now\r\nfound in the neighbouring streams and hedge-rows, with the bones of\r\nexisting quadrupeds, have been obtained from the peat, with flint-tools\r\nof more than usual finish, and together with them a few fragments of\r\nhuman bones. Of these reliquiæ, the Celtic memorials lie below the\r\nGallo-Roman; above them, oaks, alders, and walnut trees occur, sometimes\r\nrooted, but no succession of a new growth of trees appear.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the St. Acheul beds is this: they were deposited by\r\nfluviatile action, and are probably amongst the oldest deposits in which\r\nhuman remains occur, older than the peat-beds of the Somme--but what is\r\ntheir _real_ age? Before submitting to the reader the very imperfect\r\nanswer this question admits of, a glance at the previous discoveries,\r\nwhich tended to give confirmation to the observations just narrated, may\r\nbe useful.\r\n\r\nImplements of stone and flint have been continually turning up during\r\nthe last century and a half in all parts of the world. In the\r\nneighbourhood of Gray’s Inn Lane, in 1715, a flint spear-head was picked\r\nup, and near it some Elephants’ bones. In the alluvium of the Wey, near\r\nGuildford, a wedge-shaped flint-tool was found in the gravel and sand,\r\nin which Elephants’ tusks were also found. Under the cliffs at\r\nWhitstable an oval-shaped flint-tool was found in what had probably been\r\na fresh-water deposit, and in which bones of the Bear and Elephant were\r\nalso discovered. Between Herne Bay and Reculver five other flint-tools\r\nhave been found, and three more near the top of the cliff, all in\r\nfresh-water gravel. In the valley of the Ouse, at Beddenham, in\r\nBedfordshire, flint-implements, like those of St. Acheul, mixed with the\r\nbones of Elephant, Rhinoceros, and Hippopotamus, have been found, and\r\nnear them an oval and a spear-shaped implement. In the peat of Ireland\r\ngreat numbers of such implements have been met with. But nowhere have\r\nthey been so systematically sought for and classified as in the\r\nScandinavian countries.\r\n\r\nThe peat-deposits of those countries--of Denmark especially--are formed\r\nin hollows and depressions, in the northern drift and Boulder clay, from\r\nten to thirty feet deep. The lower stratum, of two or three feet in\r\nthickness, consists of _sphagnum_, over which lies another growth of\r\npeat formed of aquatic and marsh plants. On the edge of the bogs trunks\r\nof Scotch firs of large size are found--a tree which has not grown in\r\nthe Danish islands within historic times, and does not now thrive when\r\nplanted, although it was evidently indigenous within the human period,\r\nsince Steenstrup took with his own hands a flint-implement from beneath\r\nthe trunk of one. The sessile variety of the oak would appear to have\r\nsucceeded the fir, and is found at a higher level in the peat. Higher up\r\nstill, the common oak, _Quercus robur_, is found along with the birch,\r\nhazel, and alder. The oak has in its turn been succeeded by the beech.\r\n\r\nAnother source from which numerous relics of early humanity have been\r\ntaken is the midden-heaps (Kjökken-mödden) found along the Scandinavian\r\ncoast. These heaps consist of castaway shells mixed with bones of\r\nquadrupeds, birds, and fishes, which reveal in some respects the habits\r\nof the early races which inhabited the coast. Scattered through these\r\nmounds are flint-knives, pieces of pottery, and ashes, but neither\r\nbronze nor iron. The knives and hatchets are said to be a degree less\r\nrude than those of older date found in the peat. Mounds corresponding to\r\nthese, Sir Charles Lyell tells us, occur along the American coast, from\r\nMassachusetts and Georgia. The bones of the quadrupeds found in these\r\nmounds correspond with those of existing species, or species which have\r\nexisted in historic times.\r\n\r\nBy collecting, arranging, and comparing the flint and stone implements,\r\nthe Scandinavian naturalists have succeeded in establishing a\r\nchronological succession of periods, which they designate--1. The Age of\r\nStone; 2. The Age of Bronze; 3. The Age of Iron. The first, or Stone\r\nperiod, in Denmark, corresponded with the age of the Scotch fir, and, in\r\npart, of the sessile oak. A considerable portion of the oak period\r\ncorresponded, however, with the age of _bronze_, swords made of that\r\nmetal having been found in the peat on the same level with the oak. The\r\n_iron_ age coincides with the beech. Analogous instances, confirmatory\r\nof these statements, occur in Yorkshire, and in the fens of\r\nLincolnshire.\r\n\r\nThe traces left indicate that the aborigines went to sea in canoes\r\nscooped out of a single tree, bringing back deep-sea fishes. Skulls\r\nobtained from the peat and from tumuli, and believed to be\r\ncontemporaneous with the mounds, are small and round, with prominent\r\nsupra-orbital ridges, somewhat resembling the skulls of Laplanders.\r\n\r\nThe third series of facts (_Lake-dwellings_, or _lacustrine\r\nhabitations_) consisted of the buildings on piles, in lakes, and once\r\ncommon in Asia and Europe. They are first mentioned by Herodotus as\r\nbeing used among the Thracians of Pæonia, in the mountain-lake Prasias,\r\nwhere the natives lived in dwellings built on piles, and connected with\r\nthe shore by a narrow causeway, by which means they escaped the assaults\r\nof Xerxes. Buildings of the same description occupied the Swiss lakes,\r\nin the mud of which hundreds of implements, like those found in Denmark,\r\nhave been dredged up. In Zurich, Moosseedorf near Berne, and Lake\r\nConstance, axes, celts, pottery, and canoes made out of single trees,\r\nhave been found; but of the human frame scarcely a trace has been\r\ndiscovered. One skull dredged up at Meilen, in the Lake of Zurich, was\r\nintermediate between the Lapp-like skull of the Danish tumuli and the\r\nmore recent European type.\r\n\r\nThe age of the different formations in which these records of the human\r\nrace are found will probably ever remain a mystery. The evidence which\r\nwould make the implements formed by man contemporaneous with the Mammoth\r\nand other great Mammalia would go a great way to prove that man was also\r\npre-glacial. Let us see how that argument stands.\r\n\r\nAt the period when the upper Norwich Crag was deposited, the general\r\nlevel of the British Isles is supposed to have been about 600 feet above\r\nits present level, and so connected with the European continent as to\r\nhave received the elements of its fauna and flora from thence.\r\n\r\nBy some great change, a period of depression occurred, in which all the\r\ncountry north of the mouth of the Thames and the Bristol Channel was\r\nplaced much below the present level. Moel Tryfaen experienced a\r\nsubmergence of at least 1,400 feet, during which it received the erratic\r\nblocks and other marks, indicative of floating icebergs, which have been\r\ndescribed in a former chapter. The country was raised again to something\r\nlike its original level, and again occupied by plants, Molluscs, Fishes\r\nand Reptiles, Birds, and Mammifera. Again subsidence takes place, and,\r\nafter several oscillations, the level remains as we now find it. The\r\nestimated time required for these various changes is something enormous,\r\nand might have extended the term to double the number of years. The unit\r\nof the calculation is the upward rate of movement observed on the\r\nScandinavian coast; applied to the oscillation of the ancient coast of\r\nSnowdonia, the figures represent 224,000 years for the several\r\noscillations of the glacial period. Adding the pre-glacial period, the\r\ncomputation gives an additional 48,000 years. But, let us repeat, the\r\nfigures and data are somewhat hypothetical.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the St. Acheul beds--said to be the most ancient\r\nformation in which the productions of human hands have been found--they\r\nare confessedly older than the peat-beds, and the time required for the\r\nproduction of other peat-beds of equal thickness has been estimated at\r\n7,000 years. The antiquity of the gravel-beds of St. Acheul may be\r\nestimated on two grounds:--1. General elevation above the level of the\r\nvalley. 2. By estimating the animal-remains found in the gravel-beds,\r\nand not in the peat. The first question implies the denudation of the\r\nvalley below the level of the gravel, or the elevation of the whole\r\nplateau. Each of these operations would involve an incalculable time,\r\nfor want of data. In the second case, judging from the slow rate at\r\nwhich quadrupeds have disappeared in historic times, the extinct Mammoth\r\nand other great animals must have occupied many centuries in dying out,\r\nfor the notion that they died out suddenly from sharp and sudden\r\nrefrigeration, is not generally admitted.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the three ages of stone, bronze, and iron, M. Morlot has\r\nbased some calculations upon the condition of the delta of Tinière, near\r\nVilleneuve, which lead him to assign to the oldest, or stone period, an\r\nage of 5,000 to 7,000 years, and to the bronze period from 3,000 to\r\n4,000. We may, then, take leave of this subject with the avowal that,\r\nwhile admitting the probability that an immense lapse of time would be\r\nrequired for the operations described, we are, in a great measure,\r\nwithout reliable data for estimating its actual extent.\r\n\r\nThe opinion which places the creation of man on the banks of the\r\nEuphrates in Central Asia is confirmed by an event of the highest\r\nimportance in the history of humanity, and by a crowd of concordant\r\ntraditions, preserved by different races of men, all tending to confirm\r\nit. We speak of the Asiatic deluge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 200.--Mount Ararat.]\r\n\r\nThe Asiatic deluge--of which sacred history has transmitted to us the\r\nfew particulars we know--was the result of the upheaval of a part of the\r\nlong chain of mountains which are a prolongation of the Caucasus. The\r\nearth opening by one of the fissures made in its crust in course of\r\ncooling, an eruption of volcanic matter escaped through the enormous\r\ncrater so produced. Volumes of watery vapour or steam accompanied the\r\nlava discharged from the interior of the globe, which, being first\r\ndissipated in clouds and afterwards condensing, descended, in torrents\r\nof rain, and the plains were drowned with the volcanic mud. The\r\ninundation of the plains over an extensive radius was the immediate\r\neffect of this upheaval, and the formation of the volcanic cone of Mount\r\nArarat, with the vast plateau on which it rests, altogether 17,323 feet\r\nabove the sea, the permanent result. The event is graphically detailed\r\nin the seventh chapter of Genesis.\r\n\r\n11. “In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, the\r\nseventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the\r\ngreat deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.\r\n\r\n12. “And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n17. “And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters\r\nincreased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.\r\n\r\n18. “And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the\r\nearth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.\r\n\r\n19. “And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the\r\nhigh hills, that _were_ under the whole heaven, were covered.\r\n\r\n20. “Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains\r\nwere covered.\r\n\r\n21. “And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of\r\ncattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the\r\nearth, and every man:\r\n\r\n22. “All in whose nostrils _was_ the breath of life, of all that _was_\r\nin the dry land, died.\r\n\r\n23. “And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of\r\nthe ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl\r\nof the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only\r\nremained _alive_, and they that _were_ with him in the ark.\r\n\r\n24. “And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.”\r\n\r\nAll the particulars of the Biblical narrative here recited are only to\r\nbe explained by the volcanic and muddy eruption which preceded the\r\nformation of mount Ararat. The waters which produced the inundation of\r\nthese countries proceeded from a volcanic eruption accompanied by\r\nenormous volumes of vapour, which in due course became condensed and\r\ndescended on the earth, inundating the extensive plains which now\r\nstretch away from the foot of Ararat. The expression, “the earth,” or\r\n“all the earth” as it is translated in the Vulgate, which might be\r\nimplied to mean the entire globe, is explained by Marcel de Serres, in a\r\nlearned book entitled “La Cosmogonie de Moïse,” and other philologists,\r\nas being an inaccurate translation. He has proved that the Hebrew word\r\n_haarets_, incorrectly translated “all the earth,” is often used in the\r\nsense of _region_ or _country_, and that, in this instance, Moses used\r\nit to express only the part of the globe which was then peopled, and not\r\nits entire surface. In the same manner “_the mountains_” (rendered “_all\r\nthe mountains_” in the Vulgate), only implies all the mountains known to\r\nMoses. Similarly, M. Glaire, in the “Christomathie Hébraïque,” which he\r\nhas placed at the end of his Grammar, quotes the passage in this sense:\r\n“The waters were so prodigiously increased, that the highest mountains\r\nof the vast horizon were covered by them;” thus restricting the\r\nmountains covered by the inundation to those bounded by the horizon.\r\n\r\nNothing occurs, therefore, in the description given by Moses, to hinder\r\nus from seeing in the Asiatic deluge a means made use of by God to\r\nchastise and punish the human race, then in the infancy of its\r\nexistence, and which had strayed from the path which he had marked out\r\nfor it. It seems to establish the countries lying at the foot of the\r\nCaucasus as the cradle of the human race; and it seems to establish also\r\nthe upheaval of a chain of mountains, preceded by an eruption of\r\nvolcanic mud, which drowned vast territories entirely composed, in these\r\nregions, of plains of great extent. Of this deluge many races besides\r\nthe Jews have preserved a tradition. Moses dates it from 1,500 to 1,800\r\nyears before the epoch in which he wrote. Berosus, the Chaldean\r\nhistorian, who wrote at Babylon in the time of Alexander, speaks of a\r\nuniversal deluge, the date of which he places immediately before the\r\nreign of Belus, the father of Ninus.\r\n\r\nThe _Vedas_, or sacred books of the Hindus, supposed to have been\r\ncomposed about the same time as Genesis, that is, about 3,300 years ago,\r\nmake out that the deluge occurred 1,500 years before their time. The\r\n_Guebers_ speak of the same event as having occurred about the same\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nConfucius, the celebrated Chinese philosopher and lawgiver, born towards\r\nthe year 551 before Christ, begins his history of China by speaking of\r\nthe Emperor named Jas, whom he represents as making the waters flow\r\nback, which, _being raised to the heavens_, washed the feet of the\r\nhighest mountains, covered the less elevated hills, and inundated the\r\nplains. Thus the Biblical deluge (PLATE XXXIII.) is confirmed in many\r\nrespects; but it was local, like all phenomena of the kind, and was\r\nthe result of the upheaval of the mountains of western Asia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XXXIII.--The Asiatic Deluge.]\r\n\r\nA deluge, quite of modern date, conveys a tolerably exact idea of this\r\nkind of phenomena. We recall the circumstances the better to comprehend\r\nthe true nature of the ravages the deluge inflicted upon some Asiatic\r\ncountries in the Quaternary period. At six days’ journey from the city\r\nof Mexico there existed, in 1759, a fertile and well-cultivated\r\ndistrict, where grew abundance of rice, maize, and bananas. In the month\r\nof June frightful earthquakes shook the ground, and were continued\r\nunceasingly for two whole months. On the night of the 28th September the\r\nearth was violently convulsed, and a region of many leagues in extent\r\nwas slowly raised until it attained a height of about 500 feet over a\r\nsurface of many square leagues. The earth undulated like the waves of\r\nthe sea in a tempest; thousands of small hills alternately rose and\r\nfell, and, finally, an immense gulf opened, from which smoke, fire,\r\nred-hot stones and ashes were violently discharged, and darted to\r\nprodigious heights. Six mountains emerged from this gaping gulf; among\r\nwhich the volcanic mountain Jorullo rises 2,890 feet above the ancient\r\nplain, to the height of 4,265 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when the earthquake commenced the two rivers _Cuitimba_\r\nand _San Pedro_ flowed backwards, inundating all the plain now occupied\r\nby Jorullo; but in the regions which continually rose, a gulf opened and\r\nswallowed up the rivers. They reappeared to the west, but at a point\r\nvery distant from their former beds.\r\n\r\nThis inundation reminds us on a small scale of the phenomena which\r\nattended the deluge of Noah.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBesides the deposits resulting from the partial deluges which we have\r\ndescribed as occurring in Europe and Asia during the Quaternary epoch\r\nthere were produced in the same period many new formations resulting\r\nfrom the deposition of _alluvia_ thrown down by seas and rivers. These\r\ndeposits are always few in number, and widely disseminated. Their\r\nstratification is as regular as that of any which belong to preceding\r\nperiods; they are distinguished from those of the Tertiary epoch, with\r\nwhich they are most likely to be confounded, by their situation, which\r\nis very frequently upon the shores of the sea, and by the predominance\r\nof shells of a species identical with those now living in the adjacent\r\nseas.\r\n\r\nA marine formation of this kind, which, after constituting the coast of\r\nSicily, principally on the side of Girgenti, Syracuse, Catania, and\r\nPalermo, occupies the centre of the island, where it rises to the\r\nheight of 3,000 feet, is amongst the most remarkable of the great\r\nQuaternary European productions. It is chiefly formed of two great beds;\r\nthe lower a bluish argillaceous marl, the other a coarse but very\r\ncompact limestone, both containing shells analogous to those of the\r\npresent Mediterranean coast. The same formation is found in the\r\nneighbouring islands, especially in Sardinia and Malta. The great sandy\r\ndeserts of Africa, as well as the argillo-arenaceous formation of the\r\nsteppes of Eastern Russia, and the fertile Tchornozem, or “_black\r\nearth_” of its southern plains, have the same geological origin; so have\r\nthe Travertines of Tuscany, Naples, and Rome, and the Tufas, which are\r\nan essential constituent of the Neapolitan soil.\r\n\r\nThe pampas of South America--which consist of an argillaceous soil of a\r\ndeep reddish-brown colour, with horizontal beds of marly clay and\r\ncalcareous tufa, containing shells either actually living now in the\r\nAtlantic, or identical with fresh-water shells of the country--ought\r\nsurely to be considered as a Quaternary deposit, of even greater extent\r\nthan the preceding.\r\n\r\nWe are now approaching so near to our own age, that we can, as it were,\r\ntrace the hand of Nature in her works. Professor Ramsay shows, in the\r\nMemoirs of the Government Geological Survey, that beds nearly a mile in\r\nthickness have been removed by denudation from the summit of the Mendip\r\nHills, and that broad areas in South Wales and the neighbouring counties\r\nhave been denuded of their higher beds, the materials being transported\r\nelsewhere to form newer strata. Now, no combination of causes has been\r\nimagined which has not involved submersion during long periods, and\r\nsubsequent elevation for periods of longer or shorter duration.\r\n\r\nWe can hardly walk any great distance along the coast, either of England\r\nor Scotland, without remarking some flat terrace of unequal breadth, and\r\nbacked by a more or less steep escarpment--upon such a terrace many of\r\nthe towns along the coast are built. No geologist now doubts that this\r\nfine platform, at the base of which is a deposit of loam or sandy\r\ngravel, with marine shells, had been, at some period, the line of coast\r\nagainst which the waves of the ocean once broke at high water. At that\r\nperiod the sea rose twenty, and thirty, and some places a hundred feet\r\nhigher than it does now. The ancient sea-beaches in some places formed\r\nterraces of sand and gravel, with littoral shells, some broken, others\r\nentire, and corresponding with species in the seas below; in others they\r\nform bold projecting promontories or deep bays. In an historical point\r\nof view, this coast-line should be very ancient, though it may be only\r\nof yesterday in a geological sense--its origin ascending far beyond\r\nwritten tradition. The wall of Antoninus, raised by the Romans as a\r\nprotection from the attacks of the Caledonians, was built, in the\r\nopinion of the best authorities, not in connection with the old, but\r\nwith the new coast-line. We may, then, conclude that in A.D. 140, when\r\nthe greater part of this wall was constructed, the zone of the ancient\r\ncoast-line had attained its present elevation above the actual level of\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nThe same proofs of a general and gradual elevation of the country are\r\nobservable almost everywhere: in the estuary of the Clyde, canoes and\r\nother works of art have been exhumed, and assigned to a recent period.\r\nNear St. Austell, and at Carnon, in Cornwall, human skulls and other\r\nrelics have been met with beneath marine strata, in which the bones of\r\nwhales and still-existing species of land-quadrupeds were imbedded. But\r\nin the countries where hard limestone rocks prevail, in the ancient\r\nPeloponnesus, along the coast of Argolis and Arcadia, three and even\r\nfour ranges of ancient sea-cliffs are well preserved, which Messrs.\r\nBoblaye and Verlet describe as rising one above the other, at different\r\ndistances from the present coast, sometimes to the height of 1,000 feet,\r\nas if the upheaving force had been suspended for a time, leaving the\r\nwaves and currents to throw down and shape the successive ranges of\r\nlofty cliffs. On the other hand, some well-known historical sites may be\r\nadduced as affording evidence of the subsidence of the coast-line of the\r\nMediterranean in times comparatively modern. In the Bay of Baiæ, the\r\ncelebrated temple of Serapis, at Puzzuoli, near Naples, which was\r\noriginally built about 100 feet from the sea, and at or near its present\r\nlevel, exhibits proofs of having gradually sunk nineteen feet, and of a\r\nsubsequent elevation of the ground on which the temple stands of nearly\r\nthe same amount.\r\n\r\nSo, also, about half a mile along the sea-shore, and standing at some\r\ndistance from it, in the sea, there are the remains of buildings and\r\ncolumns which bear the name of the Temples of the Nymphs and of Neptune.\r\nThe tops of these broken columns are now nearly on a level with the\r\nsurface of the water, which is about five feet deep.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the littoral deposits of the Quaternary period, they are\r\nof very limited extent, except in a few localities. They are found on\r\nthe western coast of Norway, and on the coasts of England. In France, an\r\nextensive bed of Quaternary formation is seen on the shores of the\r\nancient Guienne, and on other parts of the coast, where it is sometimes\r\nconcealed by trees and shrubs, or by blown sand, as at Dax in the\r\nLandes, where a steep bank may be traced about twelve miles inland, and\r\nparallel with the present coast, which falls suddenly about fifty feet\r\nfrom a higher platform of the land, to a lower one extending to the sea.\r\nIn making some excavations for the foundations of a building at Abesse,\r\nin 1830, it was discovered that this fall consisted of drift-sand,\r\nfilling up a steep perpendicular cliff about fifty feet high, consisting\r\nof a bed of Tertiary clay extending to the sea, a bed of limestone with\r\nTertiary shells and corals, and, at the summit, the Tertiary sand of the\r\nLandes. The marine beds, together with the alluvium of the rivers, have\r\ngiven rise to those deposits which occur more especially near the mouths\r\nof rivers and watercourses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 201.--Shell of Planorbis corneus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving considered the past history of the globe, we may now be permitted\r\nto bestow a glance upon the future which awaits it.\r\n\r\nCan the actual state of the earth be considered as definitive? The\r\nrevolutions which have fashioned its surface, and produced the Alps in\r\nEurope, Mount Ararat in Asia, the Cordilleras in the New World--are they\r\nto be the last? In a word, will the terrestrial sphere for ever preserve\r\nthe form under which we know it--as it has been, so to speak, impressed\r\non our memories by the maps of the geographers?\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to reply with any confidence to this question;\r\nnevertheless, our readers will not object to accompany us a step\r\nfurther, while we express an opinion, founded on analogy and scientific\r\ninduction.\r\n\r\nWhat are the causes which have produced the present inequalities of the\r\nglobe--the mountain-ranges, continents, and waters? The primordial cause\r\nis, as we have had frequent occasion to repeat, the cooling of the\r\nearth, and the progressive solidification of the external crust, the\r\nnucleus of which still remains in a fluid or viscous state. These have\r\nproduced the contortions, furrows, and fractures which have led to the\r\nelevation of the great mountain-ranges and the depression of the great\r\nvalleys--which have caused some continents to emerge from the bed of\r\nocean and have submerged others. The secondary causes which have\r\ncontributed to the formation of a vast extent of dry land are due to the\r\nsedimentary deposits, which have resulted in the creation of new\r\ncontinents by filling up the basins of the ancient seas.\r\n\r\nNow these two causes, although in a minor degree, continue in operation\r\nto the present day. The thickness of the terrestrial crust is only a\r\nsmall fraction compared to that of the internal liquid mass. The\r\nprincipal cause, then, of the great dislocations of the earth’s crust\r\nis, so to speak, at our gates; it threatens us unceasingly. Of this the\r\nearthquakes and volcanic eruptions, which are still frequent in our\r\nday, give us disastrous and incontestable proofs. On the other hand, our\r\nseas are continually forming new land: the bed of the Baltic Sea, for\r\ninstance, is gradually rising, in consequence of the deposits which will\r\nobviously fill up its area entirely in an interval of time which it\r\nmight not be impossible to calculate.\r\n\r\nIt is, then, probable that the actual condition of the surface and the\r\nrespective limits of seas and continents have nothing fixed or definite\r\nin them--that they are, on the contrary, open to great modifications in\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nThere is another problem much more difficult of solution than the\r\npreceding, but for which neither induction nor analogy furnish us with\r\nany certain data--viz., the perpetuity of our species. Is man doomed to\r\ndisappear from the earth some day, like all the races of animals which\r\npreceded him, and prepared the way for his advent? Will a new _glacial\r\nperiod_, analogous to that which, during the Quaternary period, was felt\r\nso rigorously, again come round to put an end to his existence? Like the\r\nTrilobites of the Silurian period, the great Reptiles of the Lias, the\r\nMastodons of the Tertiary, and the Megatheriums of the Quaternary epoch,\r\nis the human species to be annihilated--to perish from the globe by a\r\nsimple natural extinction? Or must we believe that man, gifted with the\r\nattribute of reason, marked, so to say, with the Divine seal, is to be\r\nthe ultimate and supreme term of creation?\r\n\r\nScience cannot pronounce upon these grave questions, which exceed the\r\ncompetence, and extend beyond the circle of human reasoning. It is not\r\nimpossible that man should be only a step in the ascending and\r\nprogressive scale of animated beings. The Divine Power which has\r\nlavished upon the earth life, sentiment, and thought; which has given\r\norganisation to plants; to animals, motion, sensation, and intelligence;\r\nto man, in addition to these multiple gifts, the faculty of reason,\r\ndoubled in value by the ideal--reserves to Himself perhaps in His wisdom\r\nthe privilege of creating alongside of man, or after him, a being still\r\nmore perfect. This new being, religion and modern poesy would present in\r\nthe ethereal and radiant type of the Christian angel, with moral\r\nqualities whose nature and essence would escape our perceptions--of\r\nwhich we could no more form a notion than one born blind could conceive\r\nof colour, or the deaf and dumb of sound. _Erunt æquales angelis Dei._\r\n“They will be as the angels of God,” says Holy Scripture, speaking of\r\nman raised to the life eternal.\r\n\r\nDuring the Metamorphic epoch the _mineral kingdom_ existed alone; the\r\nrocks, silent and solitary, were all that was yet formed of the burning\r\nearth. During the Primary epoch, the vegetable kingdom, newly created,\r\nextended itself over the whole globe, which it soon covered from pole to\r\npole with an uninterrupted mass of verdure. During the Secondary and\r\nTertiary epochs, the vegetable and animal kingdoms divided the earth\r\nbetween them. In the Quaternary epoch the _human kingdom_ appeared. Is\r\nit in the future destinies of our planet to receive yet another lord?\r\nAnd after the four kingdoms which now occupy it, is there to be a _new\r\nkingdom_ created, the attributes of which can never be anything but an\r\nimpenetrable mystery, and which will differ from man in as great a\r\ndegree as man differs from the other animals, and plants from rocks?\r\n\r\nWe must be contented with suggesting, without hoping to solve, this\r\nformidable problem. It is a great mystery, which, according to the fine\r\nexpression of Pliny, “lies hidden in the majesty of Nature,” _latet in\r\nmajestate naturæ_; or (to speak more in the spirit of Christian\r\nphilosophy) it is known only to the Almighty Creator of the Universe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE\r\n  OF\r\n  BRITISH SEDIMENTARY AND FOSSILIFEROUS STRATA.\r\n\r\n  BY H.
