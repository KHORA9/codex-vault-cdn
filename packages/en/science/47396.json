In a review of this \"Life and\r\nLetters\" I happened to mention my thought of giving to the public\r\nsome day my own reminiscences of the great philosopher; several\r\nfriends urged me to do so, not in the pages of a magazine, but in the\r\nform of a little book designed for those of his fellow-countrymen\r\nwho venerate his noble character without being able to follow his\r\nscientific researches. I accepted the task. Professor Tyndall and Dr.\r\nBence Jones, with Messrs. Longman, the publishers, kindly permitted\r\nme to make free use of their materials; but I am indebted to the\r\nCorporation of the Trinity House, and to many friends, for a good deal\r\nof additional information; and in compiling my book I have preferred,\r\nwhere practicable, to illustrate the character of Faraday by documents\r\nor incidents hitherto unpublished, or contained in those sketches of\r\nthe philosopher which are less generally known.\r\n\r\nIt is due to myself to say that I had pretty well sketched out the\r\nsecond part of this book before I read M. Dumas' \"Eloge Historique.\"\r\nThe close similarity of my analysis of Professor Faraday's character\r\nwith that of the illustrious French chemist may perhaps be accepted as\r\nan additional warrant for the correctness of our independent estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe very favourable reception which my book has met with, both from the\r\npress and the public, seems to call for my grateful acknowledgment on\r\nthe issue of a second edition.\r\n\r\nIn revising the former, I have added some further particulars about\r\nFaraday, especially in regard to \"his method of working;\" and an\r\nengraving from a photograph by Watkins, which best recalls to my\r\nrecollection the features and the usual expression of the genial\r\nphilosopher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n          SECT.

He lived in Jacob's Well\r\nMews, close by, and was learning the three R's at a common day-school.\r\nFew passers-by would have noticed him, and none certainly would have\r\nimagined that this boy, as he grew up, was to achieve the truest\r\nsuccess in life, and to die honoured by the great, the wise, and the\r\ngood. Yet so it was; and to tell the story of his life, to trace the\r\nsources of this success, and to depict some of the noble results of his\r\nwork, are the objects of this biographical sketch.\r\n\r\nIt was not at Jacob's Well Mews, but in Newington Butts, that the\r\nboy had been born, on September 22, 1791, and his parents, James and\r\nMargaret Faraday, had given this, their third child, the unusual name\r\nof Michael. The father was a journeyman blacksmith, a skilful workman\r\nwho, in spite of poverty and feeble health, strove to bring up his\r\nchildren in habits of industry and the love of God.\r\n\r\nOf course young Michael must soon do something for his living. There\r\nhappened to be a bookseller's shop in Blandford Street, a few doors\r\nfrom the entrance to the Mews, kept by a Mr. Riebau, an intelligent\r\nman, who is said to have had a leaning to astrology; and there he\r\nwent as errand boy when thirteen years old. Many a weary walk he\r\nhad, carrying round newspapers to his master's customers; but he did\r\nhis work faithfully; and so, after a twelvemonth, the bookseller was\r\nwilling to take him as an apprentice, and that without a premium.\r\n\r\nNow, a boy in a bookseller's shop can look at the inside as well as the\r\noutside of the books he handles, and young Faraday took advantage of\r\nhis position, and fed on such intellectual food as Watts's \"Improvement\r\nof the Mind,\" Mrs. Marcet's \"Conversations on Chemistry,\" and the\r\narticle on \"Electricity\" in the _Encyclopædia Britannica_, besides such\r\nlighter dishes as Miss Burney's \"Evelina;\" nor can we doubt that when\r\nhe was binding Lyons' \"Experiments on Electricity,\" and Boyle's \"Notes\r\nabout the Producibleness of Chymicall Principles,\" he looked beyond the\r\ncovers.[1] And his thirst for knowledge did not stop with reading:\r\nhe must see whether Mrs. Marcet's statements were correct, and so,\r\nto quote his own words, \"I made such simple experiments in chemistry\r\nas could be defrayed in their expense by a few pence per week, and\r\nalso constructed an electrical machine, first with a glass phial, and\r\nafterwards with a real cylinder, as well as other electrical apparatus\r\nof a corresponding kind.\"\r\n\r\nHe kept too a note-book called \"The Philosophical Miscellany,\"\r\nintended, he tells us, \"to promote both amusement and instruction, and\r\nalso to corroborate or invalidate those theories which are continually\r\nstarting into the world of science;\" and miscellaneous indeed were the\r\nscraps he gathered from the magazines of the time.\r\n\r\nOne day, early in 1810, walking somewhere in the neighbourhood of Fleet\r\nStreet, he saw in a shop-window a bill announcing that lectures on\r\nnatural philosophy were delivered by Mr. Tatum, at 53, Dorset Street,\r\nat eight in the evening, price of admission one shilling. He wanted to\r\nhear these lectures. His master's permission was obtained, but where\r\nwas the money to come from? The needful shillings were given him by his\r\nelder brother, Robert, who earned them as a blacksmith; and so Michael\r\nFaraday made his first acquaintance with scientific lectures. And not\r\nwith lectures only, for Tatum's house was frequented by other earnest\r\nstudents, and lifelong friendships were formed. Among these students\r\nwas Benjamin Abbott, a young Quaker, who had received a good education,\r\nand had then a situation in a City house as confidential clerk. With\r\nhim Faraday chatted on philosophy or anything else, and happily for us\r\nhe chatted on paper, in letters of that fulness and length which the\r\npenny post and the telegraph have well-nigh driven out of existence;\r\nand happily for us, too, Abbott kept those letters, and Dr. Bence Jones\r\nhas published them. They are wonderful letters for a poor bookseller's\r\napprentice; they bear the stamp of an innate gentleman and philosopher.\r\n\r\nLong afterwards, when Benjamin Abbott was an old man, he used to tell\r\nhow Faraday made his first experiments in the kitchen of his house,\r\nand delivered his first lecture from the end of that kitchen table.\r\nThe electrical machine made by him in those early days came into the\r\npossession of Sir James South, and now forms one of the treasures of\r\nthe Royal Institution.\r\n\r\nAs the eager student drank in the lectures of Tatum, he took notes, and\r\nhe afterwards wrote them out carefully in a clear hand, numbering and\r\ndescribing the different experiments that he saw performed, and making\r\nwonderfully neat drawings of the apparatus, in good perspective. These\r\nnotes he bound in four volumes, adding to each a copious index, and\r\nprefixing to the first this dedication to his master:--\r\n\r\n                          \"TO MR. G. RIEBAU.\r\n\r\n \"SIR,\r\n\r\n \"When first I evinced a predilection for the sciences, but more\r\n particularly for that one denominated electricity, you kindly\r\n interested yourself in the progress I made in the knowledge of facts\r\n relating to the different theories in existence, readily permitting me\r\n to examine those books in your possession that were in any way related\r\n to the subjects then occupying my attention. To you, therefore, is\r\n to be attributed the rise and existence of that small portion of\r\n knowledge relating to the science which I possess, and accordingly to\r\n you are due my acknowledgments.\r\n\r\n \"Unused to the arts of flattery, I can only express my obligations in\r\n a plain but sincere way. Permit me, therefore, Sir, to return thanks\r\n in this manner for the many favours I have received at your hands and\r\n by your means and believe me,\r\n\r\n                      \"Your grateful and obedient Servant,\r\n\r\n                                                   \"M. FARADAY.\"\r\n\r\nNow there happened to be lodging at Mr. Riebau's a notable foreigner of\r\nthe name of Masquerier. He was a distinguished artist, who had painted\r\nNapoleon's portrait, and had passed through the stirring events of\r\nthe first French Revolution, not without serious personal danger, and\r\nwas now finding a refuge and a home in London. He was struck with the\r\nintelligence of the apprentice, whose duty it was to do various offices\r\nfor him; and he lent the young man his books, and taught him how to\r\nmake the drawings in perspective which have already been alluded to.\r\n\r\nBut the lectures in Dorset Street were not the only ones that Michael\r\nFaraday attended; and as the Royal Institution is the central scene\r\nof all his subsequent history, we must pay a mental visit to that\r\nbuilding. Turning from the busy stream of Piccadilly into the quiet\r\nof Albemarle Street, we see, in a line with the other houses, a large\r\nGrecian façade with fourteen lofty pilasters. Between these are folding\r\ndoors, which are pushed open from time to time by grave-looking\r\ngentlemen, many of them white-headed; but often of an afternoon,\r\nand always on Friday evening during the season, the quiet street\r\nis thronged with carriages and pedestrians, ladies and gentlemen,\r\nwho flock through these folding doors. Entering with them, we find\r\nourselves in a vestibule, with a large stone staircase in front, and\r\nrooms opening on the right and left. The walls of these rooms are lined\r\nwith myriads of books, and the tables are covered with scientific and\r\nother periodicals of the day, and there are cabinets of philosophical\r\napparatus and a small museum. Going up the broad staircase and turning\r\nto the right, we pass through an ante-room to the lecture theatre.\r\nThere stands the large table, horseshoe-shaped, with the necessary\r\nappliances for experiments, and behind it a furnace and arrangements\r\nfor black-board and diagrams; while round the table as a centre\r\nrange semicircular seats, rising tier above tier, and surmounted by\r\na semicircular gallery, the whole capable of seating 700 persons.\r\nOn the basement is a new chemical laboratory, fitted up with modern\r\nappliances, and beyond it the old laboratory, with its furnaces and\r\nsand-bath, its working tables and well-stored shelves, flanked by\r\ncellars that look like dark lumber-rooms. A narrow private staircase\r\nleads up to the suite of apartments in which resides the Director of\r\nthe house. Such is the Royal Institution of Great Britain, incorporated\r\nby Royal Charter in the year 1800, \"for the diffusing knowledge and\r\nfacilitating the general introduction of useful mechanical inventions\r\nand improvements, and for teaching, by courses of philosophical\r\nlectures and experiments, the application of science to the common\r\npurposes of life;\"--with the motto, \"Illustrans commoda vitæ.\" Fifty\r\nor sixty years ago the building was essentially what it is now, except\r\nthe façade and entrance, and that the laboratory, which was considered\r\na model of perfection, was even darker than at present, and in the\r\nplace of the modern chemical room there was a small theatre. The side\r\nroom, too, was fitted up for actual work, though even at mid-day it\r\nhad to be artificially lighted; and beyond this there was, and still\r\nis, a place called the Froggery, from a certain old tradition of frogs\r\nhaving been kept there. The first intention of the founders to exhibit\r\nuseful inventions had not been found very practicable, but the place\r\nwas already famous with the memories of Rumford and Young; and at that\r\ntime the genius of Sir Humphry Davy was entrancing the intellectual\r\nworld with brilliant discoveries, and drawing fashionable audiences to\r\nAlbemarle Street to listen to his eloquent expositions.\r\n\r\nAmong the customers of the bookseller in Blandford Street was a Mr.\r\nDance, who, being a member of the Royal Institution, took young Faraday\r\nto hear the last four public lectures of Davy. The eager student\r\nsat in the gallery, just over the clock, and took copious notes of\r\nthe Professor's explanations of radiant matter, chlorine, simple\r\ninflammables, and metals, while he watched the experiments that were\r\nperformed. Afterwards he wrote the lectures fairly out in a quarto\r\nvolume, that is still preserved--first the theoretical portions, then\r\nthe experiments with drawings, and finally an index. \"The desire to\r\nbe engaged in scientific occupation, even though of the lowest kind,\r\ninduced me,\" he says, \"whilst an apprentice, to write, in my ignorance\r\nof the world and simplicity of my mind, to Sir Joseph Banks, then\r\nPresident of the Royal Society. Naturally enough, 'No answer' was the\r\nreply left with the porter.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of October his apprenticeship expired, and on the next day\r\nhe became a journeyman bookbinder under a disagreeable master--who,\r\nlike his friend the artist, was a French _émigré_. No wonder he sighed\r\nstill more for congenial occupation.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of that same October Sir Humphry Davy was working on\r\na new liquid which was violently explosive, now known as chloride of\r\nnitrogen,--and he met with an accident that seriously injured his eye,\r\nand produced an attack of inflammation. Of course, for a while he could\r\nnot write, and, possibly through the introduction of M. Masquerier,[2]\r\nthe young bookseller was employed as his amanuensis. This, however,\r\nFaraday himself tells us lasted only \"some days;\" and in writing years\r\nafterwards to Dr. Paris, he says, \"My desire to escape from trade,\r\nwhich I thought vicious and selfish, and to enter into the service\r\nof Science, which I imagined made its pursuers amiable and liberal,\r\ninduced me at last to take the bold and simple step of writing to Sir\r\nH. Davy, expressing my wishes, and a hope that, if an opportunity came\r\nin his way, he would favour my views; at the same time I sent the notes\r\nI had taken of his lectures.\" Davy, it seems, called with the letter\r\non one of his friends--at that time honorary inspector of the models\r\nand apparatus--and said, \"Pepys, what am I to do? Here is a letter\r\nfrom a young man named Faraday; he has been attending my lectures,\r\nand wants me to give him employment at the Royal Institution--_what\r\ncan I do?_\" \"Do?\" replied Pepys; \"put him to wash bottles: if he is\r\ngood for anything, he will do it directly; if he refuses, he is good\r\nfor nothing.\" \"No, no,\" replied Davy, \"we must try him with something\r\nbetter than that.\"\r\n\r\nSo Davy wrote a kind reply, and had an interview with the young\r\nman upon the subject; in which, however, he advised him to stick\r\nto his business, telling him that \"Science was a harsh mistress,\r\nand, in a pecuniary point of view, but poorly rewarding those who\r\ndevoted themselves to her service.\" He promised him the work of the\r\nInstitution, and his own besides.\r\n\r\nBut shortly afterwards the laboratory assistant was discharged for\r\nmisconduct, and so it happened that one night the inhabitants of quiet\r\nWeymouth Street were startled by the unusual apparition of a grand\r\ncarriage with a footman, which drew up before the house where Faraday\r\nlived, when the servant left a note from Sir Humphry Davy. The next\r\nmorning there was an interview, which resulted in the young aspirant\r\nfor scientific work being engaged to help the famous philosopher. His\r\nengagement dates from March 1, 1813, and he was to get 25_s._ per week,\r\nand a room in the house. The duties had been previously laid down by\r\nthe managers:--\"To attend and assist the lecturers and professors in\r\npreparing for, and during lectures. Where any instruments or apparatus\r\nmay be required, to attend to their careful removal from the model room\r\nand laboratory to the lecture-room, and to clean and replace them after\r\nbeing used; reporting to the managers such accidents as shall require\r\nrepair, a constant diary being kept by him for that purpose. That in\r\none day in each week he be employed in keeping clean the models in the\r\nrepository, and that all the instruments in the glass cases be cleaned\r\nand dusted at least once within a month.\"\r\n\r\nThe young assistant did not confine himself to the mere discharge\r\nof these somewhat menial duties. He put in order the mineralogical\r\ncollection; and from the first we find him occupying a higher position\r\nthan the minute quoted above would indicate.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a few days he was extracting sugar from beet-root;\r\nbut all his laboratory proceedings were not so pleasant or so innocent\r\nas that, for he had to make one of the worst smelling of all chemical\r\ncompounds, bisulphide of carbon; and as Davy continued to work on\r\nthe explosive chloride of nitrogen, his assistant's career stood\r\nsome chance of being suddenly cut short at its commencement. Indeed\r\nit seems that before the middle of April he had run the gauntlet of\r\nfour separate explosions. Knowing that the liquid would go off on the\r\nslightest provocation, the experimenters wore masks of glass, but this\r\ndid not save them from injury. In one case Faraday was holding a small\r\ntube containing a few grains of it between his finger and thumb, and\r\nbrought a piece of warm cement near it, when he was suddenly stunned,\r\nand on returning to consciousness found himself standing with his hand\r\nin the same position, but torn by the shattered tube, and the glass of\r\nhis mask even cut by the projected fragments. Nor was it easy to say\r\nwhen the compound could be relied on, for it seemed very capricious;\r\nfor instance, one day it rose quietly in vapour in a tube exhausted by\r\nthe air-pump, but the next day, when subjected to the same treatment,\r\nit exploded with a fearful noise, and Sir Humphry was cut about the\r\nchin, and was struck with violence on the forehead. This seems to have\r\nput an end to the experiments.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in spite of disagreeables and dangers, the embryo\r\nphilosopher worked on with a joyful heart, beguiling himself\r\noccasionally with a song, and in the evening playing tunes on his flute.\r\n\r\nThe change in Michael Faraday's employment naturally made him more\r\nearnest still in the pursuit of knowledge. He was admitted as a member\r\nof the \"City Philosophical Society,\" a fraternity of thirty or forty\r\nmen in the middle or lower ranks of life, who met every Wednesday\r\nevening for mutual instruction; and here is a contemporary picture of\r\nhim at one of its debates:--\r\n\r\n      \"But hark! A voice arises near the chair!\r\n       Its liquid sounds glide smoothly through the air;\r\n       The listening muse with rapture bends to view\r\n       The place of speaking, and the speaker too.\r\n       Neat was the youth in dress, in person plain;\r\n       His eye read thus, _Philosopher in grain_;\r\n       Of understanding clear, reflection deep;\r\n       Expert to apprehend, and strong to keep.\r\n       His watchful mind no subject can elude,\r\n       Nor specious arts of sophists e'er delude;\r\n       His powers, unshackled, range from pole to pole;\r\n       His mind from error free, from guilt his soul.\r\n       Warmth in his heart, good humour in his face,\r\n       A friend to mirth, but foe to vile grimace;\r\n       A temper candid, manners unassuming,\r\n       Always correct, yet always unpresuming.\r\n       Such was the youth, the chief of all the band;\r\n       His name well known, Sir Humphry's right hand.\r\n       With manly ease towards the chair he bends,\r\n       With Watts's Logic at his finger-ends.\"\r\n\r\nAnother way in which he strove to educate himself is thus described\r\nin his own words:--\"During this spring Magrath and I established the\r\nmutual improvement plan, and met at my rooms up in the attics of the\r\nRoyal Institution, or at Wood Street at his warehouse. It consisted,\r\nperhaps, of half-a-dozen persons, chiefly from the City Philosophical\r\nSociety, who met of an evening to read together, and to criticise,\r\ncorrect, and improve each other's pronunciation and construction of\r\nlanguage. The discipline was very sturdy, the remarks very plain and\r\nopen, and the results most valuable. This continued for several years.\"\r\n\r\nSeven months after his appointment there began a new passage in\r\nFaraday's life, which gave a fresh impulse to his mental activity, and\r\nlargely extended his knowledge of men and things. Sir Humphry Davy,\r\nwishing to travel on the Continent, and having received a special pass\r\nfrom the Emperor Napoleon, offered to take him as his amanuensis: he\r\naccepted the proposal, and for a year and a half they wandered about\r\nFrance, Italy, and Switzerland, and then they returned rapidly by the\r\nTyrol, Germany, and Holland.\r\n\r\nFrom letters written when abroad we can catch some of the impressions\r\nmade on his mind by these novel scenes. \"I have not forgot,\" he writes\r\nto Abbott, \"and never shall forget, the ideas that were forced on my\r\nmind in the first days. To me, who had lived all my days of remembrance\r\nin London, a city surrounded by a flat green country, a hill was a\r\nmountain, and a stone a rock; for though I had abstract ideas of the\r\nthings, and could say rock and mountain, and would talk of them, yet I\r\nhad no perfect ideas. Conceive then the astonishment, the pleasure,\r\nand the information which entered my mind in the varied county of\r\nDevonshire, where the foundations of the earth were first exposed to my\r\nview, and where I first saw granite, limestone, &c., in those places\r\nand in those forms where the ever-working and all-wonderful hand of\r\nnature had placed them. Mr. Ben., it is impossible you can conceive\r\nmy feelings, and it is as impossible for me to describe them. The\r\nsea then presented a new source of information and interest; and on\r\napproaching the shores of France, with what eagerness, and how often,\r\nwere my eyes directed to the South! When arrived there, I thought\r\nmyself in an uncivilized country; for never before nor since have I\r\nseen such wretched beings as at Morlaix.\" His impression of the people\r\nwas not improved by the fact of their having arrested the travellers on\r\nlanding, and having detained them for five days until they had sent to\r\nParis for verification of their papers.\r\n\r\nAgain, to her towards whom his heart was wont to turn from distant\r\nlands with no small longing: \"I have said nothing as yet to you,\r\ndear mother, about our past journey, which has been as pleasant and\r\nagreeable (a few things excepted, in reality nothing) as it was\r\npossible to be. Sir H. Davy's high name at Paris gave us free admission\r\ninto all parts of the French dominions, and our passports were granted\r\nwith the utmost readiness. We first went to Paris, and stopped there\r\ntwo months; afterwards we passed, in a southerly direction, through\r\nFrance to Montpellier, on the borders of the Mediterranean. From\r\nthence we went to Nice, stopping a day or two at Aix on our way; and\r\nfrom Nice we crossed the Alps to Turin, in Piedmont. From Turin we\r\nproceeded to Genoa, which place we left afterwards in an open boat, and\r\nproceeded by sea towards Lerici. This place we reached after a very\r\ndisagreeable passage, and not without apprehensions of being overset\r\nby the way. As there was nothing there very enticing, we continued our\r\nroute to Florence; and, after a stay of three weeks or a month, left\r\nthat fine city, and in four days arrived here at Rome. Being now in\r\nthe midst of things curious and interesting, something arises every\r\nday which calls for attention and observations. The relics of ancient\r\nRoman magnificence, the grandeur of the churches, and their richness\r\nalso--the difference of habits and customs, each in turn engages\r\nthe mind, and keeps it continually employed. Florence, too, was not\r\ndestitute of its attractions for me, and in the Academy del Cimento\r\nand the museum attached to it is contained an inexhaustible fund of\r\nentertainment and improvement; indeed, during the whole journey, new\r\nand instructive things have been continually presented to me. Tell B.\r\nI have crossed the Alps and the Apennines; I have been at the Jardin\r\ndes Plantes; at the museum arranged by Buffon; at the Louvre, among\r\nthe _chefs d'oeuvre_ of sculpture and the masterpieces of painting;\r\nat the Luxembourg Palace, amongst Rubens' works; that I have seen\r\na GLOWWORM!!! waterspouts, torpedo, the museum at the Academy del\r\nCimento, as well as St. Peter's, and some of the antiquities here, and\r\na vast variety of things far too numerous to enumerate.\"\r\n\r\nBut he kept a lengthy journal, and as we turn over the pages--for the\r\nbest part of it is printed by Bence Jones--we meet vivid sketches\r\nof the provokingly slow custom-house officers, the postilion in\r\njack-boots, and the thin pigs of Morlaix--pictures of Paris, too,\r\nwhen every Frenchman was to him an unintelligible enemy; when the\r\nApollo Belvidere, the Venus de Medici, and the Dying Gladiator were\r\nat the Louvre, and when the First Napoleon visited the Senate in full\r\nstate. \"He was sitting in one corner of his carriage, covered and\r\nalmost hidden from sight by an enormous robe of ermine, and his face\r\novershadowed by a tremendous plume of feathers that descended from\r\na velvet hat.\" We watch Sir Humphry as Ampère and others bring to\r\nhim the first specimens of iodine, and he makes experiments with his\r\ntravelling apparatus on the dark lustrous crystals and their violet\r\nvapour; we seem, too, to be present with the great English chemist and\r\nhis scholar as they burn diamonds at Florence by means of the Grand\r\nDuke's gigantic lens, and prove that the invisible result is carbonic\r\nacid; or as they study the springs of inflammable gas at Pietra Mala,\r\nand the molten minerals of Vesuvius. The whole, too, is interspersed\r\nwith bits of fun, and this culminates at the Roman Carnival, where he\r\nevidently thoroughly enjoyed the follies of the Corso, the pelting with\r\nsugar-plums, and the masked balls, to the last of which he went in a\r\nnightgown and nightcap, with a lady who knew all his acquaintances; and\r\nbetween the two they puzzled their friends mightily.\r\n\r\nThis year and a half may be considered as the time of Faraday's\r\neducation; it was the period of his life that best corresponds with the\r\ncollegiate course of other men who have attained high distinction in\r\nthe world of thought. But his University was Europe; his professors the\r\nmaster whom he served, and those illustrious men to whom the renown of\r\nDavy introduced the travellers. It made him personally known, also, to\r\nforeign _savants_, at a time when there was little intercourse between\r\nGreat Britain and the Continent; and thus he was associated with the\r\nFrench Academy of Sciences while still young, his works found a welcome\r\nall over Europe, and some of the best representatives of foreign\r\nscience became his most intimate friends.\r\n\r\nIn May 1815, his engagement at the Royal Institution was renewed, with\r\na somewhat higher position and increased salary, which was again raised\r\nin the following year to 100_l._ per annum. The handwriting in the\r\nLaboratory Note-book changes in September 1815, from the large running\r\nletters of Brande to the small neat characters of Faraday, his first\r\nentry having reference to an analysis of \"Dutch turf ash,\" and then\r\nsoon occur investigations into the nature of substances bearing what\r\nmust have been to him the mysterious names of Paligenetic tincture, and\r\n_Baphe eugenes chruson_. It is to be hoped that the constituents of\r\nthis golden dye agreed together better than the Greek words of its name.\r\n\r\nWe can imagine the young philosopher taking a deeper interest in the\r\nresearches on flame which his master was then carrying out, and in the\r\ngradual perfection of the safety-lamp that was to bid defiance to the\r\nexplosive gases of the mine; this at least is certain, that Davy, in\r\nthe preface to his celebrated paper on the subject, expresses himself\r\n\"indebted to Mr. Michael Faraday for much able assistance,\" and that\r\nthe youthful investigator carefully preserved the manuscript given him\r\nto copy.\r\n\r\nPart of his duty, in fact, was to copy such papers; and as Sir Humphry\r\nhad a habit of destroying them, he begged leave to keep the originals,\r\nand in that way collected two large volumes of precious manuscripts.\r\n\r\nBut there came a change. Hitherto he had been absorbing; now he was\r\nto emit. The knowledge which had been a source of delight to himself\r\nmust now overflow as a blessing to others: and this in two ways. His\r\nfirst lecture was given at the City Philosophical Society on January\r\n17, 1816, and in the same year his first paper was published in\r\nthe _Quarterly Journal of Science_. The lecture was on the general\r\nproperties of matter; the paper was an analysis of some native caustic\r\nlime from Tuscany. Neither was important in itself, but each resembled\r\nthose little streams which travellers are taken to look at because\r\nthey are the sources of mighty rivers, for Faraday became the prince\r\nof experimental lecturers, and his long series of published researches\r\nhave won for him the highest niche in the temple of science.\r\n\r\nWhen he began to investigate for himself, it could not have been easy\r\nto separate his own work from that which he was expected to do for his\r\nmaster. Hence no small danger of misunderstandings and jealousies; and\r\nsome of these ugly attendants on rising fame did actually throw their\r\nblack shadows over the intercourse between the older and the younger\r\nman of genius. In these earlier years, however, all appears to have\r\nbeen bright; and the following letter, written from Rome in October\r\n1818, will give a good idea of the assistant's miscellaneous duties,\r\nand of the pleasant feelings of Davy towards him. It may be added that\r\nin another letter he is requested to send some dozens of \"flies with\r\npale bodies\" to Florence, for Sir Humphry loved fly-fishing as well as\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\n                           \"TO MR. FARADAY.\r\n\r\n \"I received the note you were so good as to address to me at Venice;\r\n and by a letter from Mr. Hatchett I find that you have found the\r\n parallax of Mr. West's Sirius, and that, as I expected, he is mistaken.\r\n\r\n \"If when you write to me you will give the 3 per cents. and _long\r\n annuities_, it will be enough.\r\n\r\n \"I will thank you to put the enclosed letters into the post, except\r\n those for Messrs. Morland and Messrs. Drummond, which perhaps you will\r\n be good enough to deliver.\r\n\r\n \"Mr. Hatchett's letter contained praises of you which were very\r\n gratifying to me; and pray believe me there is no one more interested\r\n in your success and welfare than your sincere well-wisher and friend,\r\n\r\n                                                        \"H. DAVY.\r\n\r\n \"ROME.\"\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that he had any astronomical duties,\r\nfor the parallax he had found was not that of the Dog-star, but of a\r\nreputed new metal, Sirium, which was resolved in Faraday's hands into\r\niron, nickel, and sulphur. But the impostor was not to be put down so\r\neasily, for he turned up again under the _alias_ of Vestium; but again\r\nhe was unable to escape the vigilant eye of the young detective, for\r\none known substance after another was removed from it; and then, says\r\nFaraday, \"my Vestium entirely disappeared.\"\r\n\r\nHis occupations during this period were multifarious enough. We must\r\npicture him to ourselves as a young-looking man of about thirty\r\nyears of age, well made, and neat in his dress, his cheerfulness of\r\ndisposition often breaking out in a short crispy laugh, but thoughtful\r\nenough when something important is to be done. He has to prepare the\r\napparatus for Brande's lectures, and when the hour has arrived he\r\nstands on the right of the Professor, and helps him to produce the\r\nstrange transformations of the chemical art. And conjurers, indeed, the\r\ntwo appear in the eyes of the youth on the left, who waits upon them,\r\nthen the \"laboratory assistant,\" now the well-known author, Mr. William\r\nBollaert, from whom I have learnt many details of this period. When not\r\nengaged with the lectures, Faraday is manufacturing rare chemicals,\r\nor performing commercial analyses, or giving scientific evidence on\r\ntrials. One of these was a famous one, arising from the Imperial\r\nInsurance Company resisting the claim of Severn and King, sugar-bakers;\r\nand in it appeared all the chemists of the day, like knights in the\r\nlists, on opposite sides, ready to break a lance with each other.\r\n\r\nAll his spare time Faraday was occupied with original work. Chlorine\r\nhad a fascination for him, though the yellow choking gas would\r\nget out into the room, and he investigated its combinations with\r\ncarbon, squeezed it into a liquid, and applied it successfully as a\r\ndisinfectant when fatal fever broke out in the Millbank Penitentiary.\r\nIodine too, another of Davy's elements, was made to join itself to\r\ncarbon and hydrogen; and naphthaline was tormented with strong mineral\r\nacids. Long, too, he tried to harden steel and prevent its rusting, by\r\nalloying it with small quantities of platinum and the rarer metals;\r\nthe boy blew the bellows till the crucibles melted, but a few ordinary\r\nrazors seem to have been the best results. Far more successful was he\r\nin repeating and extending some experiments of Ampère on the mutual\r\naction of magnets and electric currents; and when, after months of\r\nwork and many ingenious contrivances, the wire began to move round the\r\nmagnet, and the magnet round the wire, he himself danced about the\r\nrevolving metals, his face beaming with joy--a joy not unmixed with\r\nthankful pride--as he exclaimed, \"There they go! there they go! we have\r\nsucceeded at last.\" After this discovery he thought himself entitled\r\nto a treat, and proposed to his attendant a visit to the theatre.\r\n\"Which shall it be?\" \"Oh, let it be Astley's, to see the horses.\" So to\r\nAstley's they went; but at the pit entrance there was a crush; a big\r\nfellow pressed roughly upon the lad, and Faraday, who could stand no\r\ninjustice, ordered him to behave himself, and showed fight in defence\r\nof his young companion.\r\n\r\nThe rising philosopher indulged, too, in other recreations. He had a\r\nwonderful velocipede, a progenitor of the modern bicycle, which often\r\ntook him of an early morning to Hampstead Hill. There was also his\r\nflute; and a small party for the practice of vocal music once a week at\r\na friend's house. He sang bass correctly, both as to time and tune.\r\n\r\nAnd though the City Philosophical Society was no more, the ardent group\r\nof students of nature who used to meet there were not wholly dispersed.\r\nThey seem to have carried on their system of mutual improvement, and\r\nto have read the current scientific journals at Mr. Nicol's house till\r\nhe married, and then alternately at those of Mr. R. H. Solly, Mr.\r\nAinger, and Mr. Hennel, of Apothecaries' Hall, who came to a tragical\r\nend through an explosion of fulminating silver. Several of them,\r\nincluding Mr. Cornelius Varley, joined the Society of Arts, which at\r\nthat time had committees of various sciences, and was very democratic\r\nin its management; and, finding that by pulling together they had\r\ngreat influence, they constituted themselves a \"caucus,\" adopting the\r\nAmerican word, and meeting in private. Magrath was looked upon as a\r\n\"chair-maker,\" and Faraday in subsequent years held the office of\r\nChairman of the Committee of Chemistry, and occasionally he presided at\r\nthe large meetings of the Society.\r\n\r\nDuring this time (1823) the Athenæum Club was started, not in the\r\npresent Grecian palace in Pall Mall, but in a private house in Waterloo\r\nPlace. Its members were the aristocracy of science, literature, and\r\nart, and they made Faraday their honorary secretary; but after a year\r\nhe transferred the office to his friend Magrath, who held it for a long\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nAmong the various sects into which Christendom is divided, few are\r\nless known than the Sandemanians. About a century and a half ago, when\r\nthere was little light in the Presbyterian Church of Scotland, a pious\r\nminister of the name of John Glas began to preach that the Church\r\nshould be governed only by the teaching of Christ and His apostles,\r\nthat its connection with the State was an error, and that we ought to\r\nbelieve and to practise no more and no less than what we find from\r\nthe New Testament that the primitive Church believed and practised.\r\nThese principles, which sound very familiar in these days, procured\r\nfor their asserter much obloquy and a deposition by the Church Courts,\r\nin consequence of which several separate congregations were formed\r\nin different parts of Great Britain, especially by Robert Sandeman,\r\nthe son-in-law of Mr. Glas, and from him they received their common\r\nappellation. In early days they taught a simpler view of faith than\r\nwas generally held at that time; it was with them a simple assent of\r\nthe understanding, but produced by the Spirit of God, and its virtue\r\ndepended not on anything mystical in the operation itself, but on the\r\ngrandeur and beauty of the things believed. Now, however, there is\r\nlittle to distinguish them in doctrine from other adherents of the\r\nPuritan theology, though they certainly concede a greater deference to\r\ntheir elders, and attach more importance to the Lord's Supper than is\r\nusual among the Puritan Churches. Their form of worship, too, resembles\r\nthat of the Presbyterians; but they hold that each congregation should\r\nhave a plurality of elders, pastors, or bishops, who are unpaid men;\r\nthat on every \"first day of the week\" they are bound to assemble, not\r\nonly for prayers and preaching, but also for \"breaking of bread,\"\r\nand putting together their weekly offerings; that the love-feast and\r\nkiss of charity should continue to be practised; that \"blood and\r\nthings strangled\" are still forbidden as food; and that a disciple\r\nof Christ should not charge interest on loans except in the case of\r\npurely business transactions, or lay up wealth for the unknown future,\r\nbut rather consider all he possesses as at the service of his poorer\r\nbrethren, and be ready to perform to them such offices of kindness as\r\nin the early Church were expressed by washing one another's feet.\r\n\r\nBut what gives the remarkable character to the adherents of this sect\r\nis their perfect isolation from all Christian fellowship outside\r\ntheir own community, and from all external religious influence. They\r\nhave never made missionary efforts to win men from the world, and have\r\nlong ceased to draw to themselves members from other Churches; so\r\nthey have rarely the advantage of fresh blood, or fresh views of the\r\nmeaning of Scripture. They commonly intermarry, and are expected to\r\n\"bear one another's burthens;\" so the Church has acquired somewhat of\r\nthe additional character of a large intertwined family and of a mutual\r\nbenefit society. This rigid separation from the world, extending now\r\nthrough three or four generations, has produced a remarkable elevation\r\nof moral tone and refinement of manner; and it is said that no one\r\nunacquainted with the inner circle can conceive of the brotherly\r\naffection that reigns there, or the extent to which hospitality and\r\nmaterial help is given without any ostentation, and received without\r\nany loss of self-respect. The body is rendered still more seclusive by\r\ndemanding, not merely unity of spirit among its members, but unanimity\r\nof opinion in every Church transaction. In order to secure this,\r\nany dissentient who persists in his opinion after repeated argument\r\nis rejected; the same is also the consequence of neglect of Church\r\nduties, as well as of any grave moral offence: and in such a community\r\nexcommunication is a serious social ban, and though a penitent may be\r\nreceived back once, he can never return a second time.\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of this little community that Faraday received\r\nhis earliest religious impressions, and among them he found his\r\necclesiastical home till the day of his entrance into the Church above.\r\n\r\nAmong the elders of the Sandemanian Church in London was Mr. Barnard, a\r\nsilversmith, of Paternoster Row. The young philosopher became a visitor\r\nat his house, and though he had previously written,--\r\n\r\n         \"What is't that comes in false deceitful guise,\r\n          Making dull fools of those that 'fore were wise?\r\n                                              'Tis Love.\"\r\n\r\n--he altered his opinion in the presence of the citizen's third\r\ndaughter, Sarah, and wrote to her what was certainly not the letter of\r\na fool:--\r\n\r\n\"You know me as well or better than I do myself. You know my former\r\nprejudices and my present thoughts--you know my weaknesses, my vanity,\r\nmy whole mind; you have converted me from one erroneous way, let me\r\nhope you will attempt to correct what others are wrong.... Again and\r\nagain I attempt to say what I feel, but I cannot. Let me, however,\r\nclaim not to be the selfish being that wishes to bend your affections\r\nfor his own sake only. In whatever way I can best minister to your\r\nhappiness, either by assiduity or by absence, it shall be done. Do not\r\ninjure me by withdrawing your friendship, or punish me for aiming to be\r\nmore than a friend by making me less; and if you cannot grant me more,\r\nleave me what I possess,--but hear me.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady hesitated, and went to Margate. There he followed her, and\r\nthey proceeded together to Dover and Shakspeare's Cliff, and he\r\nreturned to London full of happiness and hope. He loved her with all\r\nthe ardour of his nature, and in due course, on June 12, 1821, they\r\nwere married. The bridegroom desired that there should be no bustle\r\nor noise at the wedding, and that the day should not be specially\r\ndistinguished; but he calls it himself \"an event which more than any\r\nother contributed to his happiness and healthful state of mind.\" As\r\nyears rolled on the affection between husband and wife became only\r\ndeeper and deeper; his bearing towards her proved it, and his letters\r\nfrequently testify to it. Doubtless at any time between their marriage\r\nand his final illness he might have written to her as he did from\r\nBirmingham, at the time of the British Association:--\"After all, there\r\nis no pleasure like the tranquil pleasures of home, and here--even\r\nhere--the moment I leave the table, I wish I were with you IN QUIET.\r\nOh! what happiness is ours! My runs into the world in this way only\r\nserve to make me esteem that happiness the more.\"\r\n\r\nHe took his bride home to Albemarle Street, and there they spent\r\ntheir wedded life; but until Mr. Barnard's death it was their custom\r\nto go every Saturday to the house of the worthy silversmith, and\r\nspend Sunday with him, returning home usually in the evening of that\r\nday. His own father died while he was at Riebau's, but his mother,\r\na grand-looking woman, lived long afterwards, supported by her son,\r\nwhom she occasionally visited at the Institution, and of whose growing\r\nreputation she was not a little proud.\r\n\r\nWith a mind calmed and strengthened by this beautiful domestic life,\r\nhe continued with greater and greater enthusiasm to ask questions of\r\nNature, and to interpret her replies to his fellow-men. Just before his\r\nmarriage he had been appointed at the Royal Institution superintendent\r\nof the house and laboratory, and in February 1825, after a change\r\nin the management of the Institution, he was placed as director in a\r\nposition of greater responsibility and influence. One of his first\r\nacts in this capacity was to invite the members to a scientific\r\nevening in the laboratory; this took place three or four times in\r\n1825, and in the following years these gatherings were held every week\r\nfrom Feb. 3 to June 9; and though the labour devolved very much upon\r\nFaraday, other philosophers sometimes brought forward discoveries or\r\nuseful inventions. Thus commenced those Friday evening meetings which\r\nhave done so much to popularize the high achievements of science.\r\nFaraday's note-books are still preserved, containing the minutes of\r\nthe committee-meetings every Thursday afternoon, the Duke of Somerset\r\nchairman, and he secretary; also the record of the Friday evenings\r\nthemselves, who lectured, and on what subject, and what was exhibited\r\nin the library, till June 1840, when other arrangements were probably\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThe year 1827 was otherwise fruitful in lectures: in the spring, a\r\ncourse of twelve on chemical manipulation at the London Institution;\r\nafter Easter, his first course at Albemarle Street, six lectures on\r\nchemical philosophy (he had helped Professor Brande in 1824);[3] and at\r\nChristmas, his desire to convey knowledge, and his love to children,\r\nfound expression in a course of six lectures to the boys and girls home\r\nfor their holidays. These were a great success; indeed, he himself\r\nsays they \"were just what they ought to have been, both in matter and\r\nmanner,--but it would not answer to give an extended course in the same\r\nspirit.\" He continued these juvenile lectures during nineteen years.\r\nThe notes for courses of lectures were written in school copy-books,\r\nand sometimes he appends a general remark about the course, not always\r\nso favourable as the one given above. Thus he writes, \"The eight\r\nlectures on the operations of the laboratory, April 1828, were not to\r\nmy mind.\" Of the course of twelve in the spring of 1827, he says he\r\n\"found matter enough in the notes for at least seventeen.\"\r\n\r\nUp to 1833 Faraday was bringing the forces of nature in subjection\r\nto man on a salary of only 100_l._ per annum, with house, coals,\r\nand candles, as the funds of the Institution would not at that time\r\nafford more; but among the sedate _habitúes_ of the place was a tall,\r\njovial gentleman, who lounged to the lectures in his old-fashioned\r\nblue coat and brass buttons, grey smalls, and white stockings, who\r\nwas a munificent friend in need. This was John Fuller, a member of\r\nParliament. He founded a Professorship of Chemistry with an endowment\r\nthat brings in nearly 100_l._ a year, and gave the first appointment to\r\nFaraday for life. When the Institution became richer, his income was\r\nincreased; and when, on account of the infirmities of age, he could no\r\nlonger investigate, lecture, or keep accounts, the managers insisted\r\non his still retaining in name his official connection with the place,\r\nwith his salary and his residence there. Nor indeed could they well\r\nhave acted otherwise; for though the Royal Institution afforded in the\r\nfirst instance a congenial soil for the budding powers of Faraday,\r\nhis growth soon became its strength; and eventually the blooming of\r\nhis genius, and the fruit it bore, were the ornament and glory of the\r\nInstitution.\r\n\r\nIt will be asked, Was this 100_l._ or 200_l._ per annum the sole\r\nincome of Faraday? No; in early days he did commercial analyses, and\r\nother professional work, which paid far better than pure science. In\r\n1830 his gains from this source amounted to 1,000_l._, and in 1831 to\r\nconsiderably more; they might easily have been increased, but at that\r\ntime he made one of his most remarkable discoveries--the evolution of\r\nelectricity from magnetism,[4]--and there seemed to lie open before him\r\nthe solution of the problem how to make one force exhibit at will the\r\nphenomena of magnetism or of common or voltaic electricity. And then\r\nhe had to face another problem--his own mental force might be turned\r\neither to the acquisition of a fortune, or to the following up of those\r\ngreat discoveries; it would not do both: which should he relinquish?\r\nThe choice was deliberately made: Nature revealed to him more and more\r\nof her secrets, but his professional gains sank in 1832 to 155_l._\r\n9_s._, and during no subsequent year did they amount even to that.\r\n\r\nStill his work was not entirely confined to his favourite studies. In\r\na letter to Lord Auckland, long afterwards, he says:--\"I have given\r\nup, for the last ten years or more, all professional occupation, and\r\nvoluntarily resigned a large income that I might pursue in some degree\r\nmy own objects of research. But in doing this I have always, as a good\r\nsubject, held myself ready to assist the Government if still in my\r\npower, _not for pay_; for, except in one instance (and then only for\r\nthe sake of the person joined with me), I refused to take it. I have\r\nthe honour and pleasure of applications, and that very recently, from\r\nthe Admiralty, the Ordnance, the Home Office, the Woods and Forests,\r\nand other departments, all of which I have replied to, and will reply\r\nto as long as strength is left me.\" He had declined the Professorship\r\nof Chemistry at the London University--now University College,--but\r\nin 1829 he accepted a lectureship at the Royal Academy, Woolwich, and\r\nheld it for about twenty years. In 1836 he became scientific adviser to\r\nthe Trinity House, and his letter to the Deputy Master also shows his\r\nfeelings in reference to such employment:--\"You have left the title and\r\nthe sum in pencil. These I look at mainly as regards the character of\r\nthe appointment; you will believe me to be sincere in this, when you\r\nremember my indifference to your proposition as a matter of interest,\r\nthough _not as a matter of kindness_. In consequence of the goodwill\r\nand confidence of all around me, I can at any moment convert my time\r\ninto money, but I do not require more of the latter than is sufficient\r\nfor necessary purposes. The sum, therefore, of 200_l._ is quite enough\r\nin itself, but not if it is to be the indicator of the character of\r\nthe appointment; but I think you do not view it so, and that you and\r\nI understand each other in that respect; and your letter confirms me\r\nin that opinion. The position which I presume you would wish me to\r\nhold is analogous to that of a standing counsel.\" For nearly thirty\r\nyears Faraday continued to report on all scientific suggestions and\r\ninventions connected with lighthouses or buoys, not for personal gain\r\nor renown, but for the public good. His position was never above that\r\nof a \"standing counsel.\" In his own words: \"I do not know the exact\r\nrelation of the Board of Trade and the Trinity House to each other;\r\nI am simply an adviser upon philosophical questions, and am put into\r\naction only when called upon.\"\r\n\r\nIn regard to the lectureship at Woolwich, Mr. Abel, his successor,\r\nwrites thus:--\"Faraday appears to have enjoyed his weekly trips\r\nto Woolwich, which he continued for so many years, as a source of\r\nrelaxation. He was in the habit of going to Woolwich in the afternoon\r\nor evening preceding his lecture at the Military Academy, then\r\npreparing at once for his experiments, and afterwards generally taking\r\na country ramble. The lecture was delivered early the following\r\nmorning. No man was so respected, admired, and beloved as a teacher at\r\nthe Military Academy in former days as Faraday. Many are the little\r\nincidents which have been communicated to me by his pupils illustrative\r\nof his charms as a lecturer, and of his kindly feelings for the youths\r\nto whom he endeavoured to impart a taste for, if not a knowledge\r\nof, science. But for some not ill-meant, though scarcely judicious,\r\nproposal to dictate modifications in his course of instruction, Faraday\r\nwould probably have continued for some years longer to lecture at\r\nWoolwich. In May 1852, soon after I had been appointed his successor,\r\nFaraday wrote to me requesting the return of some tubes of condensed\r\ngases which he left at the Academy. This letter ends thus:--'I hope\r\nyou feel yourself happy and comfortable in your arrangements at the\r\nAcademy, and have cause to be pleased with the change. I was ever very\r\nkindly received there, and that portion of regret which one must ever\r\nfeel in concluding a long engagement would be in some degree lessened\r\nwith me by hearing that you had reason to be satisfied with your duties\r\nand their acceptance.--Ever very truly yours, M. FARADAY.'\"\r\n\r\nFor year after year the life of Faraday afforded no adventure and\r\nlittle variety, only an ever-growing skill in his favourite pursuit,\r\nhigher and higher success, and ever-widening fame. But simple as were\r\nhis mind and his habits, no one picture can present him as the complete\r\nman; we must try to make sketches from various points of view, and\r\nleave it to the reader's imagination to combine them.\r\n\r\nLet us watch him on an ordinary day. After eight hours' sleep, he rises\r\nin time to breakfast at eight o'clock, goes round the Institution to\r\nsee that all is in order, and descends into the laboratory, puts on\r\na large white apron, the stains and holes in which tell of previous\r\nservice, and is busy among his pieces of apparatus. The faithful\r\nAnderson, an old soldier, who always did exactly what he was told, and\r\nnothing more,[5] is waiting upon him; and as thought flashes after\r\nthought through his eager--perhaps impatient--brain, he twists his\r\nwires into new shapes, and re-arranges his magnets and batteries. Then\r\nsome conclusion is arrived at which lights up his face with a gleam of\r\nsatisfaction, but the next minute a doubt comes across that expressive\r\nbrow--may the results not be due to something else yet imperfectly\r\nconceived?--and a new experiment must be devised to answer that. In\r\nthe meantime perhaps one of his little nieces has been left in his\r\ncharge. She sits as quiet as a mouse with her needlework; but now and\r\nthen he gives her a nod, or a kind word, and throwing a little piece\r\nof potassium on to a basin of water for her amusement, he shows her\r\nthe metal bursting into purple flame, floating about in fiery eddies,\r\nand the crack of the fused globule of potash at the end. Presently\r\nthere is handed to him the card of some foreign _savant_, who makes his\r\npilgrimage to the famous Institution and its presiding genius; he puts\r\ndown his last result on a slate, comes upstairs, and, disregarding the\r\ninterruption, chats with his visitor with all cordiality and openness.\r\nThen to work again till dinner-time, at half-past two. In the afternoon\r\nhe retires to his study with its plain furniture and the india-rubber\r\ntree in the window, and writes a letter full of affection to some\r\nfriend, after which he goes off to the council meeting of one of the\r\nlearned bodies. Then back again to the laboratory, but as evening\r\napproaches he goes upstairs to his wife and niece, and then there is a\r\ngame at bagatelle or acting charades; and afterwards he will read aloud\r\nfrom Shakspeare or Macaulay till it is time for supper and the simple\r\nfamily worship which now is not liable to the interruptions that\r\ngenerally prevent it in the morning. And so the day closes.\r\n\r\nOr if it be a fine summer evening, he takes a stroll with his wife and\r\nthe little girl to the Zoological Gardens, and looks at all the new\r\narrivals, but especially the monkeys, laughing at their tricks till the\r\ntears run down his cheeks.\r\n\r\nBut should it be a Friday evening, Faraday's place is in the library\r\nand theatre of the Institution, to see that all is right and ready, to\r\nsay an encouraging word to the lecturer, and to welcome his friends as\r\nthey arrive; then taking his seat on the front bench near the right\r\nhand of the speaker, he listens with an animated countenance to his\r\nstory,[6] sometimes bending forwards, and scarcely capable of keeping\r\nhis fingers off the apparatus--not at all able if anything seems to\r\nbe going wrong; when the discourse is over, a warm shake of the hand,\r\nwith \"Thank you for a pleasant hour,\" and \"Good night\" to those around\r\nhim, and upstairs with his wife and some particularly congenial friends\r\nto supper. On the dining-table is abundance of good fare and good\r\nwine, and around it flows a pleasant stream of lively and intellectual\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nBut suppose it is his own night to lecture. The subject has been\r\ncarefully considered, an outline of his discourse has been written on\r\na sheet of foolscap, with all the experiments marked and numbered, and\r\nduring the morning everything has been arranged on the table in such\r\norder that his memory is assisted by it; the audience now pours in, and\r\nsoon occupies all the seats, so that late comers must be content with\r\nsitting on the stairs or standing in the gangways, or at the back of\r\nthe gallery. Faraday enters, and placing himself in the centre of the\r\nhorse-shoe table, perfect master of himself, his apparatus, and his\r\naudience, commences a discourse which few that are present will ever\r\nforget. Here is a picture by Lady Pollock:--\"It was an irresistible\r\neloquence, which compelled attention and insisted upon sympathy. It\r\nwaked the young from their visions, and the old from their dreams.\r\nThere was a gleaming in his eyes which no painter could copy, and which\r\nno poet could describe. Their radiance seemed to send a strange light\r\ninto the very heart of his congregation; and when he spoke, it was felt\r\nthat the stir of his voice and the fervour of his words could belong\r\nonly to the owner of those kindling eyes. His thought was rapid, and\r\nmade itself a way in new phrases--if it found none ready made--as the\r\nmountaineer cuts steps in the most hazardous ascent with his own axe.\r\nHis enthusiasm sometimes carried him to the point of ecstasy when he\r\nexpatiated on the beauties of Nature, and when he lifted the veil from\r\nher deep mysteries. His body then took motion from his mind; his hair\r\nstreamed out from his head; his hands were full of nervous action; his\r\nlight, lithe body seemed to quiver with its eager life. His audience\r\ntook fire with him, and every face was flushed. Whatever might be the\r\nafter-thought or the after-pursuit, each hearer for the time shared his\r\nzeal and his delight.\"[7]\r\n\r\nIs it possible that he can be happier when lecturing to the juveniles?\r\nThe front rows are filled with the young people; behind them are ranged\r\nolder friends and many of his brother philosophers, and there is old\r\nSir James South, who is quite deaf, poor man, but has come, as he says,\r\nbecause he likes to see the happy faces of the children. How perfect\r\nis the attention! Faraday, with a beaming countenance, begins with\r\nsomething about a candle or a kettle that most boys and girls know,\r\nthen rises to what they had never thought of before, but which now is\r\nas clear as possible to their understandings. And with what delight\r\ndoes he watch the performances of Nature in his experiments! One could\r\nfancy that he had never seen the experiments before, and that he was\r\nabout to clap his hands with boyish glee at the unexpected result! Then\r\nwith serious face the lecturer makes some incidental remark that goes\r\nfar beyond natural philosophy, and is a lesson for life.\r\n\r\nSome will remember one of these occasions which forms the subject of\r\na painting by Mr. Blaikley. Within the circle of the table stands the\r\nlecturer, and waiting behind is the trusty Anderson, while the chair is\r\noccupied by the Prince Consort, and beside him are the young Prince of\r\nWales and his brother, the present Duke of Edinburgh; while the Rev.\r\nJohn Barlow and Dr. Bence Jones sit on the left of the Princes; Sir\r\nJames South stands against the door, and Murchison, De La Rue, Mrs.\r\nFaraday, and others may be recognized among the eager audience.\r\n\r\nLet us now suppose that it is a Sunday on which we are watching this\r\nprince among the aristocracy of intellect, and we will assume it to\r\nbe during one of the periods of his eldership, namely between 1840\r\nand 1844, or after 1860. The first period came to a close through\r\nhis separation both from his office and from the Church itself. The\r\nreason of this is unknown except to the parties immediately concerned,\r\nbut it will be readily understood how easily differences may arise\r\nin such a community as that of the Sandemanians between an original\r\nand conscientious mind and his brethren in the faith. He, however,\r\ncontinued to worship among his friends, and was after a while restored\r\nto the rights of membership, and eventually to the office of elder. In\r\nthe morning he and his family group find their way down to the plain\r\nlittle meeting-house in Paul's Alley, Red-cross Street, since pulled\r\ndown to make room for the Metropolitan Railway. The day's proceedings\r\ncommence with a prayer meeting, during which the worshippers gradually\r\ndrop in and go to their accustomed seats, Faraday taking his place\r\non the platform devoted to the elders: then the more public service\r\nbegins; one of a metrical but not rhyming version of the Psalms is\r\nsung to a quaint old tune; the Lord's Prayer and another psalm follow;\r\nhe rises and reads in a slow, reverent manner the words of one of the\r\nEvangelists, with a most profound and intelligent appreciation of\r\ntheir meaning; or he offers an extempore prayer, expressing perfect\r\ntrust and submission to God's will, with deep humility and confession\r\nof sin. It may be his turn to preach. On two sides of a card he has\r\npreviously sketched out his sermon with the illustrative texts, but the\r\ncongregation does not see the card, only a little Bible in his hand,\r\nthe pages of which he turns quickly over, as, fresh from an earnest\r\nheart, there flows a discourse full of devout thought, clothed largely\r\nin the language of Scripture. After a loud simultaneous \"Amen\" has\r\nclosed the service, the Church members withdraw to their common meal,\r\nthe feast of charity; and in the afternoon there is another service,\r\nending by invariable custom with the Lord's Supper. The family group do\r\nnot reach home till half-past 5; then there is a quiet evening, part of\r\nwhich is spent by Faraday at his desk, and they retire to rest at an\r\nearly hour.\r\n\r\nAgain on Wednesday evening he is among the little flock. The service\r\nis somewhat freer, for not the officers of the Church only, but the\r\nordinary members are encouraged to express whatever thoughts occur to\r\nthem, so as to edify one another. At these times, Faraday, especially\r\nwhen he was not an elder, very often had some word of exhortation,\r\nand the warmth of his temperament would make itself felt, for he was\r\nknown in the small community as an experimental rather than a doctrinal\r\npreacher.\r\n\r\nThe notes of his more formal discourses which I have had the\r\nopportunity of seeing, indicate, as might be expected from the tenets\r\nof his Church, a large acquaintance with the words of Scripture, but no\r\nknowledge of modern exegesis. They appear to have impressed different\r\nhearers in different ways. One who heard him frequently and was\r\nstrongly attached to him, says that his sermons were too parenthetical\r\nand rapid in their delivery, with little variety or attractiveness;\r\nbut another scientific friend, who heard him occasionally, writes:\r\n\"They struck me as resembling a mosaic work of texts. At first you\r\ncould hardly understand their juxtaposition and relationship, but as\r\nthe well-chosen pieces were filled in, by degrees their congruity and\r\nfitness became developed, and at last an amazing sense of the power\r\nand beauty of the whole filled one's thoughts at the close of the\r\ndiscourse.\"\r\n\r\nHis first sermon as an elder was on Christ's character and example\r\nas shown in Matthew xi. 28-30: \"Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly\r\nin heart.\" Among the latest of his sermons was one that he preached\r\nat Dundee about four years before his death. He began by telling his\r\naudience that his memory was failing, and he feared he could not quote\r\nScripture with perfect accuracy; and then, as said one of the elders\r\nwho had been present, \"his face shone like the face of an angel,\" as he\r\npoured forth the words of loving exhortation.\r\n\r\nWhen a mind is stretched in the same direction week-day and Sunday,\r\nthe tension is apt to become too great. With Faraday the first symptom\r\nwas loss of memory. Then his devoted wife had to hurry him off to the\r\ncountry for rest of brain. Once he had to give up work almost entirely\r\nfor a twelvemonth. During this time he travelled in Switzerland, and\r\nextracts from his diary are given by Bence Jones. His niece, Mrs.\r\nDeacon, gives us her recollections of a month spent at Walmer:--\"How\r\nI rejoiced to be allowed to go there with him! We went on the outside\r\nof the coach, in his favourite seat behind the driver. When we reached\r\nShooter's Hill, he was full of fun about Falstaff and the men in\r\nbuckram, and not a sight nor a sound of interest escaped his quick\r\neye and ear. At Walmer we had a cottage in a field, and my uncle was\r\ndelighted because a window looked directly into a blackbird's nest\r\nbuilt in a cherry-tree. He would go many times in a day to watch\r\nthe parent birds feeding their young. I remember, too, how much he\r\nwas interested in the young lambs, after they were sheared at our\r\ndoor, vainly trying to find their own mothers. The ewes, not knowing\r\ntheir shorn lambs, did not make the customary signal. In those days\r\nI was eager to see the sun rise, and my uncle desired me always to\r\ncall him when I was awake. So, as soon as the glow brightened over\r\nPegwell Bay, I stole downstairs and tapped at his door, and he would\r\nrise, and a great treat it was to watch the glorious sight with him.\r\nHow delightful, too, to be his companion at sunset! Once I remember\r\nwell how we watched the fading light from a hill clothed with wild\r\nflowers, and how, as twilight stole on, the sounds of bells from Upper\r\nDeal broke upon our ears, and how he watched till all was grey. At\r\nsuch times he would be well pleased if we could repeat a few lines\r\ndescriptive of his feelings.\" And then she tells us about their\r\nexamining the flowers in the fields by the aid of \"Galpin's Botany,\"\r\nand how with a candle he showed her a spectre on the white mist\r\noutside the window; of reading lessons that ended in laughter, and of\r\nsea-anemones and hermit crabs, with the merriment caused by their odd\r\nmovements as they dragged about the unwieldy shells they tenanted. \"But\r\nof all things I used to like to hear him read 'Childe Harold;' and\r\nnever shall I forget the way in which he read the description of the\r\nstorm on Lake Leman. He took great pleasure in Byron, and Coleridge's\r\n'Hymn to Mont Blanc' delighted him. When anything touched his feelings\r\nas he read--and it happened not unfrequently--he would show it not only\r\nin his voice, but by tears in his eyes also.\"\r\n\r\nA few days at Brighton refreshed him for his work. He was in the habit\r\nof running down there before his juvenile lectures at Christmas, and at\r\nEaster he frequently sought the same sea-breezes.\r\n\r\nBut it was not always that Faraday could run away from London when the\r\nmental tension became excessive. A shorter relaxation was procured by\r\nhis taking up a novel such as \"Ivanhoe,\" or \"Jane Eyre,\" or \"Monte\r\nChristo.\" He liked the stirring ones best, \"a story with a thread to\r\nit.\" Or he would go with his wife to see Kean act, or hear Jenny Lind\r\nsing, or perhaps to witness the performance of some \"Wizard of the\r\nNorth.\"\r\n\r\nNow and then he would pay a visit to some scene of early days. One of\r\nhis near relatives tells me: \"It is said that Mr. Faraday once went to\r\nthe shop where his father had formerly been employed as a blacksmith,\r\nand asked to be allowed to look over the place. When he got to a part\r\nof the premises at which there was an opening into the lower workshop,\r\nhe stopped and said: 'I very nearly lost my life there once. I was\r\nplaying in the upper room at pitching halfpence into a pint pot close\r\nby this hole, and having succeeded at a certain distance, I stepped\r\nback to try my fortune further off, forgetting the aperture, and down I\r\nfell; and if it had not been that my father was working over an anvil\r\nfixed just below, I should have fallen on it, broken my back, and\r\nprobably killed myself. As it was, my father's back just saved mine.'\"\r\n\r\nBusiness, as well as pleasure, sometimes took him away from home. He\r\noften joined the British Association, returning usually on Saturday,\r\nthat he might be among his own people on the Lord's Day. During the\r\nmeeting he would generally accept the hospitality of some friend; and\r\nit was one of these occasions that gave rise to the following _jeu\r\nd'esprit_:--\r\n\r\n  \"'That P will change to F in the British tongue is true\r\n   (Quoth Professor Phillips), though the instances are few;'\r\n   An entry in my journal then I ventured thus to parody,\r\n   'I this day dined with Fillips, where I hobbed and nobbed with\r\n      Pharaday.'\r\n\r\n                                                          \"T. T.\r\n\r\n  \"OXFORD, _June 27, 1860_.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Liverpool meeting, in 1837, he was president of the Chemical\r\nSection, and on two other occasions he was selected to deliver the\r\nevening lecture, but though repeatedly pressed to undertake the\r\npresidency of the whole body, he could not be prevailed upon to accept\r\nthe office.\r\n\r\nMy first personal intercourse with him, of any extent, was at the\r\nIpswich meeting in 1851. I watched him with all the interest of an\r\nadmiring disciple, and there is deeply engraven on my memory the\r\nvivacity of his conversation, the eagerness with which he entered into\r\nsome mathematico-chemical speculations of Dumas, and the playfulness\r\nwith which, when we were dining together, he cut boomerangs out of\r\ncard, and shot them across the table at his friends.\r\n\r\nProfessional engagements also took him not unfrequently into the\r\ncountry. Some of these will be described in the later sections, that\r\ntreat of his mode of working and its valuable results.\r\n\r\nTo comprehend a man's life it is necessary to know not merely what he\r\ndoes, but also what he purposely leaves undone. There is a limit to\r\nthe work that can be got out of a human body or a human brain, and he\r\nis a wise man who wastes no energy on pursuits for which he is not\r\nfitted; and he is still wiser who, from among the things that he can do\r\nwell, chooses and resolutely follows the best.\r\n\r\nFaraday took no part in any of the political or social movements of\r\nhis time. To politics indeed he seems to have been really indifferent.\r\nIt was during the intensely interesting period of 1814-15 that he was\r\non the Continent with Davy, but he alludes to the taking of Paris by\r\nthe allied troops simply because of its bearing on the movements of\r\nthe travellers, and on March 7, 1815, he made his remarkable entry in\r\nhis journal: \"I heard for news that Bonaparte was again at liberty.\r\nBeing no politician, I did not trouble myself much about it, though\r\nI suppose it will have a strong influence on the affairs of Europe.\"\r\nIn later days he seems to have awaked to sufficient interest to\r\nread the debates, and to show a Conservative tendency; he became a\r\nspecial constable in 1848, and was disposed generally to support \"the\r\npowers that be,\"--though that involved some perplexity at a change of\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIt is more singular that a man of his benevolent spirit should never\r\nhave taken a prominent part in any philanthropic movement. In some\r\ncases his religious views may have presented an obstacle, but this\r\nreason can hardly apply to many of those social movements in which the\r\ninfluence of his name, and his occasional presence and advice, would\r\nhave been highly valuable. During the latter half of his life, he, as\r\na rule, avoided serving on committees even for scientific objects,\r\nand was reluctant to hold office in the learned societies with which\r\nhe was connected. I believe, however, that this arose not so much\r\nfrom want of interest, as from a conviction that he was ill-suited by\r\nnatural temperament for joining in discussions on subjects that roused\r\nthe passions of men, or for calmly weighing the different courses of\r\naction, and deciding which was the most judicious. It is remarkable\r\nhow little even of his scientific work was done in conjunction with\r\nothers. Neither did he spend time in rural occupations, or in literary\r\nor artistic pursuits. Beasts and birds and flowers he looked at,\r\nbut it was for recreation, not for study. Music he was fond of, and\r\noccasionally he visited the Opera, but he did not allow sweet sounds\r\nto charm him away from his work. He stuck closely to his fireside,\r\nhis laboratory, his lecture table, and his church. He lived where he\r\nworked, so that he had only to go downstairs to put to the test of\r\nexperiment any fresh thought that flitted across his brain. He almost\r\ninvariably declined dinner-parties, except at Lady Davy's, and at\r\nMr. and Mrs. Masquerier's at Brighton, towards whom he felt under an\r\nobligation on account of former kindnesses. If he went to a _soirée_,\r\nhe usually stayed but a short time; and even when away from home he\r\ngenerally refused private hospitality. Thus he was able to give almost\r\nundivided attention to the chief pursuit of his life.\r\n\r\nHis residence in so accessible a part of London did, however, expose\r\nhim to the constant invasion of callers, and his own good nature often\r\nrendered fruitless the efforts that were considerately made to restrict\r\nthese within reasonable limits. Of course he suffered from the curious\r\nand the inconsiderate of the human species; and then there were those\r\npertinacious bores, the dabblers in science. \"One morning a young man\r\ncalled on him, and with an air of great importance confided to him the\r\nresult of some original researches (so he deemed them) in electrical\r\nphilosophy. 'And pray,' asked the Professor, taking down a volume of\r\nRees' Cyclopædia, 'did you consult this or any elementary work to learn\r\nwhether your discovery had been anticipated?' The young man replied in\r\nthe negative. 'Then why do you come to waste my time about well-known\r\nfacts, that were published forty years ago?' 'Sir,' said the visitor,\r\n'I thought I had better bring the matter to head-quarters immediately.'\r\n'All very well for you, but not so well for head-quarters,' replied the\r\nProfessor, sharply, and set him down to read the article.\"\r\n\r\n\"A grave, elderly gentleman once waited upon him to submit to his\r\nnotice 'a new law of physics.' The visitor requested that a jug of\r\nwater and a tumbler might be brought, and then producing a cork, 'You\r\nwill be pleased to observe,' said he, 'how persistently this cork\r\nclings to the side of the glass when the vessel is half filled.' 'Just\r\nso,' replied the Professor. 'But now,' resumed this great discoverer,\r\n'mark what happens when I fill the tumbler to the brim. There! you\r\nsee the cork flies to the centre--positively repelled by the sides!'\r\n'Precisely so,' replied the amused electrician, with the air of a man\r\nwho felt perfectly at home with the phenomenon, and indeed regarded\r\nit quite as an old friend. The visitor was evidently disconcerted.\r\n'Pray how long have you known this?' he ventured to ask Faraday.\r\n'Oh, ever since I was a boy,' was the rejoinder. Crestfallen--his\r\ndiscovery demolished in a moment--the poor gentleman was retiring\r\nwith many apologies, when the Professor, sincerely concerned at his\r\ndisappointment, comforted him by suggesting that possibly he might some\r\nday alight upon something really new.\"[8]\r\n\r\nBut there were other visitors who were right welcome to a portion of\r\nhis time. One day it might be a young man, whom a few kind words and\r\na little attention on the part of the great philosopher would send\r\nforward on the journey of life with new energy and hopes. Another day\r\nit might be some intellectual chieftain, who could meet the prince of\r\nexperimenters on equal terms. But these are hardly to be regarded as\r\ninterruptions;--rather as a part of his chosen work.\r\n\r\nHere is one instance in the words of Mr. Robert Mallet. \"... I was,\r\nin the years that followed, never in London without paying him a\r\nvisit, and on one of those times I ventured to ask him (if not too\r\nmuch engaged) to let me see where he and Davy had worked together.\r\nWith the most simple graciousness he brought me through the whole of\r\nthe Royal Institution, Albemarle Street. Brande's furnaces, Davy's\r\nbattery, the place in the laboratory where he told me he had first\r\nobserved the liquefaction of chlorine, are all vividly before me--but\r\nnothing so clear or vivid as our conversation over a specimen of green\r\n(crown) glass, partially devitrified in floating opaque white spheres\r\nof radiating crystals: he touched luminously on the obscure relation\r\nof the vitreous and crystalloid states, and on the probable nature\r\nof the nuclei of the white spheres. My next visit to Faraday that I\r\nrecollect was not long after my paper 'On the Dynamics of Earthquakes'\r\nhad appeared in the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy. He almost\r\nat once referred to it in terms of praise that seemed to me so far\r\nbeyond my due, that even now I recall the very humble way I felt, as\r\nthe thought of Faraday's own transcendent merits rushed across my mind.\r\nI ventured to ask him, had the paper engaged his attention sufficiently\r\nthat I might ask him--did he consider my explanation of the before\r\nsupposed _vorticose_ shock sufficient? To my amazement he at once\r\nrecited _nearly word for word_ the paragraph in which I took some pains\r\nto put my views into a demonstrative shape, and ended with, 'It is as\r\nplain and certain as a proposition of Euclid!' And yet the subject was\r\none pretty wide away from his own objects of study.\"\r\n\r\nOften, too, if some interesting fact was exhibited to him, he would\r\nsend to his brother _savants_ some such note as this:--\r\n\r\n                                  \"ROYAL INSTITUTION, _4th May, 1852_.\r\n\r\n \"MY DEAR WHEATSTONE,\r\n\r\n \"Dr. Dubois-Raymond will be making his experiments _here_ next\r\n Thursday, the 6th, from and after 11 o'clock. I wish to let you know,\r\n that you may if you like join the select few.\r\n\r\n                                     \"Ever truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                                 \"M. FARADAY.\"\r\n\r\nIt was indeed his wont to share with others the delight of a new\r\ndiscovery. Thus Sir Henry Holland tells me that he used frequently to\r\nrun to his house in Brook Street with some piece of scientific news.\r\nOne of these visits was after reading Bunsen and Kirchhoff's paper on\r\nSpectrum Analysis; and he did not stop short with merely telling the\r\ntale of the special rays of light shot forth by each metallic vapour,\r\nas the following letter will show. It is addressed to the present\r\nBaroness Burdett Coutts.\r\n\r\n                               \"ROYAL INSTITUTION, _Friday, 17th May_.\r\n\r\n \"DEAR MISS COUTTS,\r\n\r\n \"To-morrow, at 4 o'clock, immediately after Max Müller's lecture,\r\n I shall show Sir Henry Holland an apparatus which has arrived from\r\n Munich to manifest the phenomena of light which have recently been\r\n made known to us by Bunsen and Kirchhoff. Mr. Barlow will be here, and\r\n he suggests that you would like to know of the occasion. If you are\r\n inclined to see how philosophers work and live, and so are inclined\r\n to climb our narrow stairs (for I must show the experiments in my\r\n room), we shall be most happy to see you. The experiments will not be\r\n beautiful except to the intelligent.\r\n\r\n                              \"Ever your faithful Servant,\r\n\r\n                                                 \"M. FARADAY.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes, too, the exhibition of a scientific fact would take him away\r\nfrom home. Thus, when her Majesty and the Prince Consort once paid\r\na private visit to the Polytechnic, Mr. Pepper arranged a surprise\r\nfor the Royal party, by getting Faraday in a quiet room to explain\r\nthe Ruhmkorff's coil--the latest development of his own inductive\r\ncurrents. This he did with his usual vivacity and enthusiasm, and the\r\ninterview is said to have gratified the philosopher as well as the\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\nHe could not, however, escape the inroads made upon his time by\r\ncorrespondence. People would write and ask him questions. Once a\r\nsolitary prisoner wrote to tell him, \"It is indeed in studying the\r\ngreat discoveries which science is indebted to you for, that I render\r\nmy captivity less sad, and make time flow with rapidity,\"--and then he\r\nproceeds to ask, \"_What is the most simple_ combination to give to a\r\nvoltaic battery, in order to produce a spark capable of setting fire to\r\npowder under water, or under ground? Up to the present I have only seen\r\nemployed to that purpose piles of thirty to forty pairs constructed\r\non Dr. Wollaston's principles. They are very large and inconvenient\r\nfor field service. Could not the same effect be produced by two spiral\r\npairs only? and if so, what can be their smallest dimension?\" And who\r\nwas the prisoner who thus speculated on the applications of science to\r\nwar? It was no other than Prince Louis Napoleon, then immured in the\r\nfortress of Ham, and now the ex-Emperor of the French. At another time\r\nhe wrote asking for his advice in the manufacture of an alloy which\r\nshould be about as soft as lead, but not so fusible,--a question which\r\nalso had evident bearing upon the art of war; and offering at the same\r\ntime to pay the cost of any experiments that might be necessary.\r\n\r\nOften, too, the correspondents of Faraday thought that they were\r\ndoing him a kindness. He says somewhere: \"The number of suggestions,\r\nhints for discovery, and propositions of various kinds, offered to\r\nme very freely and with perfect goodwill and simplicity on the part\r\nof the proposers, for my exclusive investigation and final honour,\r\nis remarkably great, and it is no less remarkable that but for one\r\nexception--that of Mr. Jenkin--they have all been worthless.... I have,\r\nI think, universally found that the man whose mind was by nature or\r\nself-education fitted to make good and worthy suggestions, was also the\r\nman both able and willing to work them out.\"\r\n\r\nBoth the askers of questions and the givers of advice expected\r\nanswers--and the answers came. Most of Faraday's letters, indeed,\r\nare of a purely business character: sometimes they are very laconic,\r\nas the note in which he announced to Dr. Paris one of his principal\r\ndiscoveries:--\r\n\r\n \"DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n \"The _oil_ you noticed yesterday turns out to be liquid chlorine.\r\n\r\n                                     \"Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n                                                \"M.

An instance or\r\ntwo may suffice.\r\n\r\n                               \"ROYAL INSTITUTION, _24th March, 1843_.\r\n\r\n \"DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n \"I have received and at once looked at your paper.

You were very kind to take the\r\n trouble of executing my commissions, when I know your heart was bent\r\n upon the entrance to your studies. Your account of M. Arago was most\r\n interesting to me, though I should have been glad if in the matter\r\n of health you could have made it better. He has a wonderful mind and\r\n spirit. And so you are hard at work, and somewhat embarrassed by your\r\n position: but no man can do just as he likes, and in many things he\r\n has to give way, and may do so honourably, provided he preserve his\r\n self-respect. Never, my dear Frank, lose that, whatever may be the\r\n alternative. Let no one tempt you to it; for nothing can be expedient\r\n that is not right; and though some of your companions may tease you\r\n at first, they will respect you for your consistency in the end; and\r\n if they pretend not to do so, it is of no consequence. However, I\r\n trust the hardest part of your probation is over, for the earliest is\r\n usually the hardest; and that you know how to take all things quietly.\r\n Happily for you, there is nothing in your pursuit which need embarrass\r\n you in Paris. I think you never cared for home politics, so that\r\n those of another country are not likely to occupy your attention,\r\n and a stranger can be but a very poor judge of a new people and their\r\n requisites.\r\n\r\n \"I think all your family are pretty well, but I know you will hear all\r\n the news from your appointed correspondent Jane, and, as I said, I am\r\n unable to chronicle anything. Still, I am always very glad to hear\r\n how you are going on, and have a sight of all that I may see of the\r\n correspondence.\r\n\r\n                         \"Ever, my dear Frank,\r\n\r\n                                \"Your affectionate Uncle,\r\n\r\n                                               \"M. FARADAY.\"\r\n\r\nHis scientific researches were very numerous. The Royal Society\r\nCatalogue gives under the name of Faraday a list of 158 papers,\r\npublished in various scientific magazines or learned Transactions. Many\r\nof these communications are doubtless short, but a short philosophical\r\npaper often represents a large amount of brain work; a score of them\r\nare the substance of his Friday evening discourses; while others are\r\nlengthy treatises, the records of long and careful investigations; and\r\nthe list includes the thirty series of his \"Experimental Researches\r\nin Electricity.\" These extended over a period of twenty-seven years,\r\nand were afterwards reprinted from the \"Philosophical Transactions,\"\r\nand form three goodly volumes, with 3,430 numbered paragraphs--one of\r\nthe most marvellous monuments of intellectual work, one of the rarest\r\ntreasure-houses of newly-discovered knowledge, with which the world\r\nhas ever been enriched. Faraday never published but one book in the\r\ncommon acceptation of the term--it was on \"Chemical Manipulation,\"--but\r\nthere appeared another large volume of reprinted papers: and three of\r\nhis courses of lectures were also published as separate small books,\r\nthough not by himself. It is very tempting to linger among these 158\r\npapers; but this is not intended as a scientific biography, and those\r\nreaders who wish to make themselves better acquainted with his work\r\nwill find an admirable summary of it in Professor Tyndall's \"Faraday as\r\na Discoverer.\" In Sections IV. and V., however, I have endeavoured to\r\ngive an idea of his manner of working, and of the practical benefits\r\nthat have flowed to mankind from some of his discoveries.\r\n\r\nAs these papers appeared his fame grew wider and wider. When a\r\ncomparatively young man he was naturally desirous of appending the\r\nmystic letters \"F.R.S.\" to his name, and he was balloted into the Royal\r\nSociety in January 1824, not without strong opposition from his master,\r\nSir Humphry Davy, then president. He paid the fees, and never sought\r\nanother distinction of the kind. But they were showered down upon him.\r\nThe Philosophical Society of Cambridge had already acknowledged his\r\nmerits, and the learned Academies of Paris and Florence had enrolled\r\nhim amongst their corresponding members. Heidelberg and St. Petersburg,\r\nPhiladelphia and Boston, Copenhagen, Berlin, and Palermo, quickly\r\nfollowed: and as the fame of his researches spread, very many other\r\nlearned societies in Europe and America, as well as at home, brought\r\nto him the tribute of their honorary membership.[9] He thrice received\r\nthe degree of Doctor, Oxford making him a D.C.L., Prague a Ph.D., and\r\nCambridge an LL.D., besides which he was instituted a Chevalier of the\r\nPrussian Order of Merit, a Commander of the Legion of Honour, and a\r\nKnight Commander of the Order of St. Maurice and St. Lazarus. Among\r\nthe medals which he received were each of those at the disposal of\r\nthe Royal Society--indeed the Copley medal was given him twice--and\r\nthe Grande Médaille d'Honneur at the time of the French Exhibition.\r\nAltogether it appears he was decorated with ninety-five titles and\r\nmarks of merit,[10] including the blue ribbon of science, for in 1844\r\nhe was chosen one of the eight foreign associates of the French Academy.\r\n\r\nThough he had never passed through a university career, he was made a\r\nmember of the Senate of the University of London, which he regarded\r\nas one of his chief honours; and he showed his appreciation of the\r\nimportance of the office by a diligent attendance to its duties.\r\n\r\nAs the recognized prince of investigators, it is no wonder that on the\r\nresignation of Lord Wrottesley, an attempt was made to induce him to\r\nbecome President of the Royal Society. A deputation waited upon him and\r\nurged the unanimous wish of the Council and of scientific men. Faraday\r\nbegged for time to consider. Tyndall gives us an insight into the\r\nreasons that led him to decline. He tells us: \"On the following morning\r\nI went up to his room, and said, on entering, that I had come to him\r\nwith some anxiety of mind. He demanded its cause, and I responded,\r\n'Lest you should have decided against the wishes of the deputation that\r\nwaited on you yesterday.' 'You would not urge me to undertake this\r\nresponsibility,' he said. 'I not only urge you,' was my reply, 'but I\r\nconsider it your bounden duty to accept it.' He spoke of the labour\r\nthat it would involve; urged that it was not in his nature to take\r\nthings easy; and that if he became president, he would surely have to\r\nstir many new questions, and agitate for some changes. I said that in\r\nsuch cases he would find himself supported by the youth and strength\r\nof the Royal Society. This, however, did not seem to satisfy him. Mrs.\r\nFaraday came into the room, and he appealed to her. Her decision was\r\nadverse, and I deprecated her decision. 'Tyndall,' he said at length,\r\n'I must remain plain Michael Faraday to the last; and let me now tell\r\nyou, that if I accepted the honour which the Royal Society desires you\r\nto confer upon me, I would not answer for the integrity of my intellect\r\nfor a single year.'\"\r\n\r\nIn 1835 Sir Robert Peel desired to confer pensions as honourable\r\ndistinctions on Faraday and some other eminent men. Lord Melbourne,\r\nwho succeeded him as Prime Minister, in making the offer at a private\r\ninterview, gave utterance to some hasty expressions that appeared to\r\nthe man of science to reflect on the honour of his profession, and led\r\nto his declining the money. The King, William IV., was struck with\r\nthe unusual nature of the proceeding, and kept repeating the story of\r\nFaraday's refusal; and about a month afterwards the Premier, dining\r\nwith Dr. (now Sir Henry) Holland, begged him to convey a letter to\r\nthe Professor and to press on him the acceptance of the pension. The\r\nletter was couched in such honourable and conciliatory terms, that\r\nFaraday's personal objection could no longer apply, and he expressed\r\nhis willingness to receive this mark of national approval. A version\r\nof the matter that found its way into the public prints caused fresh\r\nannoyance, and nearly produced a final refusal, but through the kind\r\noffices of friends who had interested themselves throughout in the\r\nmatter, a friendly feeling was again arrived at, and the pension of\r\n£300 a year was granted and accepted.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 the Queen offered him a house at Hampton Court. It was a\r\npretty little place, situated in the well-known Green in front of the\r\nPalace; and in that quiet retreat Faraday spent a large portion of his\r\nremaining years.\r\n\r\nIn October 1861 he wrote a letter to the managers of the Royal\r\nInstitution, resigning part of his duties, in which he reviewed his\r\nconnection with them. \"I entered the Royal Institution in March 1813,\r\nnearly forty-nine years ago, and, with the exception of a comparatively\r\nshort period during which I was abroad on the Continent with Sir H.\r\nDavy, have been with you ever since. During that time I have been most\r\nhappy in your kindness, and in the fostering care which the Royal\r\nInstitution has bestowed upon me. Thank God, first, for all His gifts.\r\nI have next to thank you and your predecessors for the unswerving\r\nencouragement and support which you have given me during that period.\r\nMy life has been a happy one, and all I desired. During its progress I\r\nhave tried to make a fitting return for it to the Royal Institution,\r\nand through it to science. But the progress of years (now amounting in\r\nnumber to three-score and ten) having brought forth first the period\r\nof development, and then that of maturity, have ultimately produced\r\nfor me that of gentle decay. This has taken place in such a manner as\r\nto make the evening of life a blessing; for whilst increasing physical\r\nweakness occurs, a full share of health free from pain is granted with\r\nit; and whilst memory and certain other faculties of the mind diminish,\r\nmy good spirits and cheerfulness do not diminish with them.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he could no longer discharge effectually his duties at the Trinity\r\nHouse, the Corporation quietly made their arrangements for transferring\r\nthem, and, with the concurrence of the Board of Trade, determined that\r\nhis salary of 200_l._ per annum should continue as long as he lived.\r\nSir Frederick Arrow called upon him at Albemarle Street, and explained\r\nhow the matter stood, but he found it hard to persuade the Professor\r\nthat there was no injustice in his continuing to receive the money;\r\nthen, taking hold of Sir Frederick by one hand and Dr. Tyndall by the\r\nother, Faraday, with swimming eyes, passed over his office to his\r\nsuccessor.\r\n\r\nGradually but surely the end approached. The loss of memory was\r\nfollowed by other symptoms of declining power. The fastenings of his\r\nearthly tabernacle were removed one by one, and he looked forward to\r\n\"the house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.\" This was no\r\nnew anticipation. Calling on the friend who had long directed with him\r\nthe affairs of the Institution, but who was then half paralysed, he\r\nhad said, \"Barlow, you and I are waiting; that is what we have to do\r\nnow; and we must try to do it patiently.\" He had written to his niece,\r\nMrs. Deacon: \"I cannot think that death has to the Christian anything\r\nin it that should make it rare, or other than a constant, thought;\r\nout of the view of death comes the view of the life beyond the grave,\r\nas out of the view of sin (the true and the real view which the Holy\r\nSpirit alone can give to a man) comes the glorious hope.... My worldly\r\nfaculties are slipping away day by day. Happy is it for all of us that\r\nthe true good lies not in them. As they ebb, may they leave us as\r\nlittle children trusting in the Father of Mercies, and accepting His\r\nunspeakable gift.\" And when the dark shadow was creeping over him, he\r\nwrote to the Comte de Paris: \"I bow before Him who is Lord of all, and\r\nhope to be kept waiting patiently for His time and mode of releasing\r\nme according to His Divine Word, and the great and precious promises\r\nwhereby His people are made partakers of the Divine nature.\" His niece,\r\nMiss Jane Barnard, who tended him with most devoted care, thus wrote\r\nfrom Hampton Court on the 27th June:--\"The kind feelings shown on every\r\nside towards my dear uncle, and the ready offers of help, are most\r\nsoothing. I am thankful to say that we are going on very quietly; he\r\nkeeps his bed and sleeps much, and we think that the paralysis gains\r\non him, but between whiles he speaks most pleasant words, showing his\r\ncomfort and trust in the finished work of our Lord. The other day he\r\nrepeated some verses of the 46th Psalm, and yesterday a great part of\r\nthe 23rd. We can only trust that it may be given us to say truly, 'Thy\r\nwill be done;' indeed, the belief that all things work together for\r\ngood to them that believe, is an anchor of hope, sure and steadfast,\r\nto the soul. We are surrounded by most kind and affectionate friends,\r\nand it is indeed touching to see what warm feelings my dear uncle has\r\nraised on all sides.\"\r\n\r\nWhen his faculties were fading fast, he would sit long at the western\r\nwindow, watching the glories of the sunset; and one day when his wife\r\ndrew his attention to a beautiful rainbow that then spanned the sky,\r\nhe looked beyond the falling shower and the many-coloured arch, and\r\nobserved, \"He hath set his testimony in the heavens.\" On August 25,\r\n1867, quietly, almost imperceptibly, came the release. There was a\r\nphilosopher less on earth, and a saint more in heaven.\r\n\r\nThe funeral, at his own request, was of the simplest character. His\r\nremains were conveyed to Highgate Cemetery by his relations, and\r\ndeposited in the grave, according to the practice of his Church, in\r\nperfect silence. Few of his scientific friends were in London that\r\nbright summer-time, but Professor Graham and one or two others came\r\nout from the shrubbery, and joining the group of family mourners, took\r\ntheir last look at the coffin.\r\n\r\nBut when this sun had set below our earthly horizon, there seemed to\r\nspring up in the minds of men a great desire to catch some of the rays\r\nof the fading brightness and reflect them to posterity. A \"Faraday\r\nMemorial\" was soon talked of, and the work is now in the sculptor's\r\nhands; the Chemical Society has founded a \"Faraday Lectureship;\" one of\r\nthe new streets in Paris has been called \"Rue Faraday;\" biographical\r\nsketches have appeared in many of the British and Continental journals;\r\nsuccessive books have told the story of his life and work; and in\r\na thousand hearts there is embalmed the memory of this Christian\r\ngentleman and philosopher.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] These books, with others bound by Faraday, are preserved in a\r\nspecial cabinet at the Royal Institution, together with more valuable\r\ndocuments,--the laboratory notes of Davy and those of Faraday, his\r\nnotes of Tatum's and Davy's lectures, copies of his published papers\r\nwith annotations and indices, notes for lectures and Friday evening\r\ndiscourses, account books, and various memoranda, together with letters\r\nfrom Wollaston, Young, Herschel, Whewell, Mitscherlich, and many others\r\nof his fellow-workers in science. These were the gift of his widow, in\r\naccordance with his own desire.\r\n\r\n[2] This idea was suggested by some remarks of Faraday to the Baroness\r\nBurdett Coutts.\r\n\r\n[3] Sir Roderick Murchison used to tell how he was attending Brande's\r\nlectures, when one day, the Professor being absent, his assistant took\r\nhis place, and lectured with so much ease that he won the complete\r\napproval of the audience. This, he said, was Faraday's first lecture at\r\nthe Royal Institution.\r\n\r\n[4] The laboratory note-book shows that at this very time he was making\r\na long series of commercial analyses of saltpetre for Mr. Brande.\r\n\r\n[5] The following anecdote has been sent me on the authority of Mr.\r\nBenjamin Abbott:--\"Sergeant Anderson was engaged to attend to the\r\nfurnaces in Mr. Faraday's researches on optical glass in 1828, and was\r\nchosen simply because of the habits of strict obedience his military\r\ntraining had given him. His duty was to keep the furnaces always at\r\nthe same heat, and the water in the ashpit always at the same level.\r\nIn the evening he was released, but one night Faraday forgot to tell\r\nAnderson he could go home, and early next morning he found his faithful\r\nservant still stoking the glowing furnace, as he had been doing all\r\nnight long.\" A more probable and better authenticated version of this\r\nstory is that after nightfall Anderson went upstairs to Faraday, who\r\nwas already in bed, to inquire if he was to remain still on duty.\r\n\r\n[6] One evening, when the Rev. A. J. D'Orsey was lecturing \"On the\r\nStudy of the English Language,\" he mentioned as a common vulgarism that\r\nof using \"don't\" in the third person singular, as \"He don't pay his\r\ndebts.\" Faraday exclaimed aloud, \"That's very wrong.\"\r\n\r\n[7] The _St. Paul's Magazine_, June 1870.\r\n\r\n[8] _British Quarterly Review_, April 1868.\r\n\r\n[9] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[10] No wonder the celebrated electrician P. Riess, of Berlin, once\r\naddressed a long letter to him as \"Professor Michael Faraday, Member of\r\nall Academies of Science, London.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.\r\n\r\nSTUDY OF HIS CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the previous section we have traced the leading events of a life\r\nwhich was quietly and uniformly successful. We have watched the passage\r\nof the errand-boy into the philosopher, and we have seen how at first\r\nhe begged for the meanest place in a scientific workshop, and at\r\nlast declined the highest honour which British Science was capable\r\nof granting. His success did not lie in the amassing of money--he\r\ndeliberately turned aside from the path of proffered wealth; nor did it\r\nlie in the attainment of social position and titles--he did not care\r\nfor the weight of these. But if success consists in a life full of\r\nagreeable occupation, with the knowledge that its labours are adding to\r\nthe happiness and wealth of the world, leading on to an old age full of\r\nhonour, and the prospect of a blissful immortality,--then the highest\r\nsuccess crowned the life of Faraday.\r\n\r\nHow did he obtain it? Not by inheritance, and not by the force of\r\ncircumstances. The wealth or the reputation of fathers is often an\r\ninvaluable starting-point for sons: a liberal education and the\r\ncontact of superior minds in early youth is often a mighty help to\r\nthe young aspirant: the favour of powerful friends will often place on\r\na vantage-ground the struggler in the battle of life. But Faraday had\r\nnone of these. Accidental circumstances sometimes push a man forward,\r\nor give him a special advantage over his fellows; but Faraday had to\r\nmake his circumstances, and to seize the small favours that fortune\r\nsometimes threw in his way. The secret of his success lay in the\r\nqualities of his mind.\r\n\r\nIt is only fair, however, to remark that he started with no\r\ndisadvantages. There was no stain in the family history: he had no dead\r\nweight to carry, of a disgraced name, or of bad health, or deficient\r\nfaculties, or hereditary tendencies to vice. It must be acknowledged,\r\ntoo, that he was endowed with a naturally clear understanding and an\r\nunusual power of looking below the surface of things.\r\n\r\nThe first element of success that we meet with in his biography is the\r\nfaithfulness with which he did his work. This led the bookseller to\r\ntake his poor errand-boy as an apprentice; and this enabled his father\r\nto write, when he was 18: \"Michael is bookbinder and stationer, and is\r\nvery active at learning his business. He has been most part of four\r\nyears of his time out of seven. He has a very good master and mistress,\r\nand likes his place well. He had a hard time for some while at first\r\ngoing; but, as the old saying goes, he has rather got the head above\r\nwater, as there is two other boys under him.\" This faithful industry\r\nmarked also his relations with Davy and Brande, and the whole of his\r\nsubsequent life; and at last, when he found that he could no longer\r\ndischarge his duties, it made him repeatedly press his resignation on\r\nthe managers of the Royal Institution, and beg to be relieved of his\r\neldership in the Church.\r\n\r\nHis love of study, and hunger after knowledge, led him to the\r\nparticular career which he pursued, and that power of imagination,\r\nwhich reveals itself in his early letters, grew and grew, till it gave\r\nhim such a familiarity with the unseen forces of nature as has never\r\nbeen vouchsafed to any other mortal.\r\n\r\nAs a source of success there stands out also his enthusiasm. A new\r\nfact seemed to charge him with an energy that gleamed from his eyes\r\nand quivered through his limbs, and, as by induction, charged for the\r\ntime those in his presence with the same vigour of interest. Plücker,\r\nof Bonn, was showing him one day in the laboratory at Albemarle Street\r\nhis experiments on the action of a magnet on the electric discharge\r\nin vacuum tubes. Faraday danced round them; and as he saw the moving\r\narches of light, he cried, \"Oh! to live in it!\" Mr. James Heywood once\r\nmet him in the thick of a tremendous storm at Eastbourne, rubbing his\r\nhands with delight because he had been fortunate enough to see the\r\nlightning strike the church tower, and displace a pinnacle.\r\n\r\nThis enthusiasm led him to throw all his heart into his work. Nor was\r\nthe energy spasmodic, or wasted on unworthy objects; for, in the words\r\nof Bence Jones, his was \"a lifelong lasting strife to seek and say that\r\nwhich he thought was true, and to do that which he thought was kind.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, his perseverance in a noble strife was another of the grand\r\nelements in his success. His tenacity of purpose showed itself equally\r\nin little and in great things. Arranging some apparatus one day with a\r\nphilosophical instrument maker, he let fall on the floor a small piece\r\nof glass: he made several ineffectual attempts to pick it up. \"Never\r\nmind,\" said his companion, \"it is not worth the trouble.\" \"Well, but,\r\nMurray, I don't like to be beaten by something that I have once tried\r\nto do.\"\r\n\r\nThe same principle is apparent in that long series of electrical\r\nresearches, where for a quarter of a century he marched steadily along\r\nthat path of discovery into which he had been lured by the genius of\r\nDavy. And so, whatever course was set before him, he ran with patience\r\ntowards the goal, not diverted by the thousand objects of interest\r\nwhich he passed by, nor stopping to pick up the golden apples that were\r\nflung before his feet.\r\n\r\nThis tremendous faculty of work was relieved by a wonderful\r\nplayfulness. This rarely appears in his writings, but was very frequent\r\nin his social intercourse. It was a simple-hearted joyousness, the\r\neffervescence of a spirit at peace with God and man. It not seldom,\r\nhowever, assumed the form of good-natured banter or a practical\r\njoke. Indications of this playfulness have already been given, and\r\nI have tried to put upon paper some instances that occur to my own\r\nrecollection, but the fun depended so much upon his manner, that it\r\nloses its aroma when separated from himself.\r\n\r\nHowever, I will try one story. I was spending a night at an hotel at\r\nRamsgate when on lighthouse business. Early in the morning there came\r\na knock at the bed-room door, but, as I happened to be performing my\r\nablutions, I cried, \"Who's there?\" \"Guess.\" I went over the names of\r\nmy brother commissioners, but heard only \"No, no,\" till, not thinking\r\nof any other friend likely to hunt me up in that place, I left off\r\nguessing; and on opening the door I saw Faraday enjoying with a laugh\r\nmy inability to recognize his voice through a deal board.\r\n\r\nA student of the late Professor Daniell tells me that he remembers\r\nFaraday often coming into the lecture-room at King's College just when\r\nthe Professor had finished and was explaining matters more fully to any\r\nof his pupils who chose to come down to the table. One day the subject\r\ndiscoursed on and illustrated had been sulphuretted hydrogen, and a\r\nlittle of the gas had escaped into the room, as it perversely will do.\r\nWhen Faraday entered he put on a look of astonishment, as though he had\r\nnever smelt such a thing before, and in a comical manner said, \"Ah!\r\na savoury lecture, Daniell!\" On another occasion there was a little\r\nammonia left in a jar over mercury. He pressed Daniell to tell him\r\nwhat it was, and when the Professor had put his head down to see more\r\nclearly, he whiffed some of the pungent gas into his face.\r\n\r\nOccasionally this humour was turned to good account, as when, one\r\nFriday evening before the lecture, he told the audience that he had\r\nbeen requested by the managers to mention two cases of infringement of\r\nrule. The first related to the red cord which marks off the members'\r\nseats. \"The second case I take to be a hypothetical one, namely, that\r\nof a gentleman wearing his hat in the drawing-room.\" This produced a\r\nlaugh, which the Professor joined in, bowed, and retired.\r\n\r\nThis faithful discharge of duty, this almost intuitive insight into\r\nnatural phenomena, and this persevering enthusiasm in the pursuit of\r\ntruth, might alone have secured a great position in the scientific\r\nworld, but they alone could never have won for him that large\r\ninheritance of respect and love. His contemporaries might have gazed\r\nupon him with an interest and admiration akin to that with which he\r\nwatched a thunderstorm; but who feels his affections drawn out towards\r\na mere intellectual Jupiter? We must look deeper into his character to\r\nunderstand this. There is a law well recognized in the science of light\r\nand heat, that a body can absorb only the same sort of rays which it is\r\ncapable of emitting. Just so is it in the moral world. The respect and\r\nlove of his generation were given to Faraday because his own nature was\r\nfull of love and respect for others.\r\n\r\nEach of these qualities--his respect for and love to others, or, more\r\ngenerally, his reverence and kindliness--deserves careful examination.\r\n\r\nThroughout his life, Michael Faraday appeared as though standing in a\r\nreverential attitude towards Nature, Man, and God.\r\n\r\nTowards Nature, for he regarded the universe as a vast congeries of\r\nfacts which would not bend to human theories. Speaking of his own early\r\nlife, he says: \"I was a very lively imaginative person, and could\r\nbelieve in the 'Arabian Nights' as easily as in the 'Encyclopædia;' but\r\nfacts were important to me, and saved me. I could trust a fact, and\r\nalways cross-examined an assertion.\" He was indeed a true disciple of\r\nthat philosophy which says, \"Man, who is the servant and interpreter\r\nof Nature, can act and understand no farther than he has, either in\r\noperation or in contemplation, observed of the method and order of\r\nNature.\"[11] And verily Nature admitted her servant into her secret\r\nchambers, and showed him marvels to interpret to his fellow-men more\r\nwonderful and beautiful than the phantasmagoria of Eastern romance.\r\n\r\nHis reverence towards Man showed itself in the respect he uniformly\r\npaid to others and to himself. Thoroughly genuine and simple-hearted\r\nhimself, he was wont to credit his fellow-men with high motives and\r\ngood reasons. This was rather uncomfortable when one was conscious of\r\nno such merit, and I at least have felt ashamed in his presence of the\r\npoor commonplace grounds of my words and actions. To be in his company\r\nwas in fact a moral tonic. As he had learned the difficult art of\r\nhonouring all men, he was not likely to run after those whom the world\r\ncounted great. \"We must get Garibaldi to come some Friday evening,\"\r\nsaid a member of the Institution during the visit of the Italian hero\r\nto London. \"Well, if Garibaldi thinks he can learn anything from us,\r\nwe shall be happy to see him,\" was Faraday's reply. This nobility\r\nof regard not only preserved him from envying the success of other\r\nexplorers in the same field, but led him heartily to rejoice with them\r\nin their discoveries.\r\n\r\nDumas gives us a picture of Foucault showing Faraday some of his\r\nadmirable experiments, and of the two men looking at one another with\r\neyes moistened, but full of bright expression, as they stood hand in\r\nhand, silently thankful--the one for the pleasure he had experienced,\r\nthe other for the honour that had been done him. He also tells how, on\r\nanother occasion, he breakfasted at Albemarle Street, and during the\r\nmeal Mr. Faraday made some eulogistic remarks upon Davy, which were\r\ncoldly received by his guest. After breakfast, he was taken downstairs\r\nto the ante-room of the lecture theatre, when Faraday, walking up to\r\nthe portrait of his old master, exclaimed, \"Wasn't he a great man!\"\r\nthen turning round to the window next the entrance door, he added, \"It\r\nwas there that he spoke to me for the first time.\" The Frenchman bowed.\r\nThey descended the stairs again to the laboratory. Faraday pulled out\r\nan old note-book, and turning over its pages showed where Davy had\r\nentered the means by which the first globule of potassium was produced,\r\nand had drawn a line round the description, with the words, \"Capital\r\nexperiment.\" The French chemist owned himself vanquished, and tells\r\nthe tale in honour of him who remembered the greatness and forgot the\r\nlittlenesses of his teacher.\r\n\r\nAnd the respect he showed to others he required to be shown to himself.\r\nIt is difficult to imagine anyone taking liberties with him, and it\r\nwas only in early life that there were small-minded creatures who\r\nwould treat him not according to what he was, but according to the\r\nposition from which he had risen. His servants and workpeople were\r\nalways attentive to the smallest expression of his wish. Still, he\r\ndid not \"go through his life with his elbows out.\" He once wrote to\r\nMatteucci: \"I see that that moves you which would move me most, viz.\r\nthe imputation of a want of good faith; and I cordially sympathize with\r\nanyone who is so charged unjustly. Such cases have seemed to me almost\r\nthe only ones for which it is worth while entering into controversy. I\r\nhave felt myself not unfrequently misunderstood, often misrepresented,\r\nsometimes passed by, as in the cases of specific inductive capacity,\r\nmagneto-electric currents, definite electrolytic action, &c. &c.: but\r\nit is only in the cases where moral turpitude has been implied, that I\r\nhave felt called upon to enter on the subject in reply.\" Yet, where he\r\nfelt that his honour was impugned, none could be more sensitive or more\r\nresolute.\r\n\r\nThis desire to clear himself, combined with his delicate regard for\r\nthe feelings of others, struck me forcibly in the following incident.\r\nAt Mr. Barlow's, one Friday evening after the discourse, two or three\r\nother chemists and myself were commenting unfavourably on a public act\r\nof Faraday, when suddenly he appeared beside us. I did not hesitate\r\nto tell him my opinion. He gave me a short answer, and joined others\r\nof the company. A few days afterwards he found me in the laboratory\r\npreparing for a lecture, and, without referring directly to what I had\r\nsaid, he gave me a full history of the transaction in such a way as to\r\nshow that he could not have acted otherwise, and at the same time to\r\nrender any apology on my part unnecessary.\r\n\r\nIntimately connected with his respect for Man as well as reverence\r\nfor truth, was the flash of his indignation against any injustice,\r\nand his hot anger against any whom he discovered to be pretenders.\r\nWhen, for instance, he had convinced himself that the reputed facts of\r\ntable-turning and spiritualism were false, his severe denunciation of\r\nthe whole thing followed as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nThus, too, a story is told of his once taking the side of the injured\r\nin a street quarrel by the pump in Savile Row. One evening also at\r\nmy house, a young man who has since acquired a scientific renown was\r\nshowing specimens of some new compounds he had made. A well-known\r\nchemist contemptuously objected that, after all, they were mere\r\nproducts of the laboratory: but Faraday came to the help of the young\r\nexperimenter, and contended that they were chemical substances worthy\r\nof attention, just as much as though they occurred in nature.\r\n\r\nHis reverence for God was shown not merely by that homage which\r\nevery religious man must pay to his Creator and Redeemer, but by the\r\nenfolding of the words of Scripture and similar expressions in such a\r\nrobe of sacredness, that he rarely allowed them to pass his lips or\r\nflow from his pen, unless he was convinced of the full sympathy of the\r\nperson with whom he was holding intercourse.\r\n\r\nThis characteristic reverence was united to an equally characteristic\r\nkindliness. This word does not exactly express the quality intended;\r\nbut unselfishness is negative, goodness is too general, love is\r\ncommonly used with special applications; kindness, friendship,\r\ngeniality, and benevolence are only single aspects of the quality. Let\r\nthe reader add these terms all together, and the resultant will be\r\nabout what is meant.[12]\r\n\r\nFaraday's love to children was one way in which this kindliness was\r\nshown. Having no children of his own, he surrounded himself usually\r\nwith his nieces: we have already had a glimpse of him heartily entering\r\ninto their play, and we are told how a word or two from Uncle would\r\nclear away all the trouble from a difficult lesson, that a long sum in\r\narithmetic became a delight when he undertook to explain it, and that\r\nwhen the little girl was naughty and rebellious, he could gently win\r\nher round, telling her how he used to feel himself when he was young,\r\nand advising her to submit to the reproof she was fighting against. Nor\r\nwere his own relatives the only sharers of his kindness. One friend\r\ncherishes among his earliest recollections, that of Faraday making for\r\nhim a fly-cage and a paper purse, which had a real bright half-crown in\r\nit. When the present Mr. Baden Powell was a little fellow of thirteen,\r\nhe used to give short lectures on chemistry in his father's house, and\r\nthe philosopher of Albemarle Street liked to join the family audience,\r\nand would listen and applaud the experiments heartily. When one day\r\nmy wife and I called on him with our children, he set them playing\r\nat hide-and-seek in the lecture theatre, and afterwards amused them\r\nupstairs with tuning-forks and resounding glasses. At a _soirée_ at Mr.\r\nJustice Grove's, he wanted to see the younger children of the family;\r\nso the eldest daughter brought down the little ones in their nightgowns\r\nto the foot of the stairs, and Faraday expressed his gratification\r\nwith \"Ah! that's the best thing you have done to-night.\" And when his\r\nfaculties had nearly faded, it is remembered how the stroking of his\r\nhand by Mr. Vincent's little daughter quickened him again to bright and\r\nloving interest.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to multiply illustrations of this kindliness in\r\nvarious relations of life.\r\n\r\nHere is one of his own telling, where certainly the effect produced was\r\nnot owing to any knowledge of how princely an intellect underlay the\r\nloving spirit. It is from a journal of his tour in Wales:--\r\n\r\n\"_Tuesday, July 20th._--After dinner I set off on a ramble to\r\nMelincourt, a waterfall on the north side of the valley, and about six\r\nmiles from our inn. Here I got a little damsel for my guide who could\r\nnot speak a word of English. We, however, talked together all the way\r\nto the fall, though neither knew what the other said. I was delighted\r\nwith her burst of pleasure as, on turning a corner, she first showed me\r\nthe waterfall. Whilst I was admiring the scene, my little Welsh damsel\r\nwas busy running about, even under the stream, gathering strawberries.\r\nOn returning from the fall I gave her a shilling that I might enjoy\r\nher pleasure: she curtsied, and I perceived her delight. She again ran\r\nbefore me back to the village, but wished to step aside every now and\r\nthen to pull strawberries. Every bramble she carefully moved out of the\r\nway, and ventured her bare feet to try stony paths, that she might find\r\nthe safest for mine. I observed her as she ran before me, when she met\r\na village companion, open her hand to show her prize, but without any\r\nstoppage, word, or other motion. When we returned to the village I bade\r\nher good-night, and she bade me farewell, both by her actions and, I\r\nhave no doubt, her language too.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter which Mr. Abel, the Director of the Chemical Department of\r\nthe War Establishment, has sent me, occur the following remarks:--\r\n\r\n\"Early in 1849 I was appointed, partly through the kind recommendation\r\nof Faraday, to instruct the senior cadets and a class of artillery\r\nofficers in the Arsenal, in practical chemistry. On the occasion of\r\nmy first attendance at Woolwich, when, having just reached manhood, I\r\nwas about to deliver my first lecture as a recognized teacher, I was\r\nnaturally nervous, and was therefore dismayed when on entering the\r\nclass-room I perceived Faraday, who, having come to Woolwich, as usual,\r\nto prepare for his next morning's lecture at the Military Academy, had\r\nbeen prompted by his kindly feelings to lend me the support of his\r\npresence upon my first appearance among his old pupils. In a moment\r\nFaraday put me completely at my ease; he greeted me heartily, saying,\r\n'Well, Abel, I have come to see whether I can assist you;' and suiting\r\naction to word, he bustled about, persisting in helping me in the\r\narrangement of my lecture-tables,--and at the close of my demonstration\r\nhe followed me from pupil to pupil, aiding each in his first attempt\r\nat manipulation, and evidently enjoying most heartily the self-imposed\r\nduty of assistant to his young _protégé_.\"\r\n\r\nAnother scientific friend, Mr. W. F. Barrett, writes:--\"My first\r\ninterview with Mr. Faraday ten years ago left an impression upon me\r\nI can never forget. Young student as I then was, thinking chiefly of\r\npresent work and little of future prospects, and till then unknown to\r\nMr. Faraday, judge of my feelings when, taking my hand in both of his,\r\nhe said, 'I congratulate you upon choosing to be a _philosopher_: it\r\nis an arduous life, but a noble and a glorious one. Work hard, and\r\nwork carefully, and you will have success.' The sweet yet serious way\r\nhe said this made the earnestness of work become a very vivid reality,\r\nand led me to doubt whether I had not dared to undertake too lofty a\r\npursuit. After this Mr. Faraday never forgot to remember me in a number\r\nof thoughtful and delicate ways. He would ask me upstairs to his room\r\nto describe or show him the results of any little investigation I might\r\nhave made: taking the greatest interest in it all, his pleasure would\r\nseem to equal and thus heighten mine, and then he would add words of\r\nkind suggestion and encouragement. In the same kindly spirit he has\r\ninvited me to his house at Hampton Court, or would ask me to join him\r\nat supper after the Friday evening's lecture. His kindness is further\r\nshown by his giving me a volume of his researches on Chemistry and\r\nPhysics, writing therein, 'From his friend Michael Faraday.' Those who\r\nlive alone in London, unknown and uncared-for by any around them, can\r\nbest appreciate these marks of attention which Mr. Faraday invariably\r\nshowed, and not only to myself, but equally to my fellow-assistant in\r\nthe chemical laboratory.\"\r\n\r\nThe following instance among many that might be quoted will illustrate\r\nhis readiness to take trouble on behalf of others. When Dr. Noad was\r\nwriting his \"Manual of Electricity,\" a doubt crossed his mind as to\r\nwhether Sir Snow Harris's unit jar gave a true measure of the quantity\r\nof electricity thrown into a Leyden jar: he asked Faraday, and his\r\ndoubt was confirmed. Shortly afterwards he received a letter beginning\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n \"MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n \"Whilst looking over my papers on induction, I was reminded of our\r\n talk about Harris's unit jar, and recollected that I had given you a\r\n result just the _reverse_ of my old conclusions, and, as I believe,\r\n of the truth. I think the jar _is a true measure_, so long as the\r\n circumstances of position, &c., are not altered; for its discharge and\r\n the quantity of electricity thus passed on depends on the constant\r\n relation of the balls connected with the inner and outer surface\r\n coating to each other, and is independent of their joint relation to\r\n the machine, battery, &c.... Perhaps I have not made my view clear,\r\n but next time we meet, remind me of the matter.\r\n\r\n                                  \"Ever truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                               \"M. FARADAY.\"\r\n\r\nAnd just a week afterwards Dr. Noad received a second letter,\r\nsurmounted by a neat drawing, and describing at great length\r\nexperiments that the Professor had since made in order to place the\r\nmatter beyond doubt.\r\n\r\nAnd it was not merely for friends and brother _savants_ that he would\r\ntake trouble. Old volumes of the _Mechanics' Magazine_ bear testimony\r\nto the way in which he was asked questions by people in all parts of\r\nthe kingdom, and that he was accustomed to give painstaking answers to\r\nsuch letters.\r\n\r\n\"Do to others as you would wish them to do to you,\" was a precept\r\noften on his lips. But I have heard that he was sometimes charged with\r\ntransgressing it himself, inasmuch as he took an amount of trouble for\r\nother people which he would have been greatly distressed if they had\r\ntaken for him.\r\n\r\nHis charities were very numerous,--not to beggars; for them he had\r\nthe Mendicity Society's tickets,--but to those whose need he knew.\r\nThe porter of the Royal Institution has shown me, among his treasured\r\nmemorials, a large number of forms for post-office orders, for sums\r\nvarying from 5_s._ to 5_l._, which Faraday was in the habit of sending\r\nin that way to different recipients of his thoughtful bounty. Two or\r\nthree instances have come to my knowledge of his having given more\r\nconsiderable sums of money--say 20_l._--to persons who he thought would\r\nbe benefited by them. In some instances the gift was called a loan,\r\nbut he lent \"not expecting again,\" and entered into the spirit of the\r\ninjunction, \"When thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy\r\nright hand doeth.\"\r\n\r\nThis principle was in fact stated in one of his letters to a friend:\r\n\"As a case of distress I shall be very happy to help you as far as my\r\nmeans allow me in such cases; but then I never let my name go to such\r\nacts, and very rarely even the initials of my name.\" His contributions\r\nto the general funds of his Church were kept equally secret.\r\n\r\nFrom all these circumstances, therefore, it is impossible to gauge\r\nthe amount of his charitable gifts; but when it is remembered that\r\nfor many years his income from different sources must have been\r\n1,000_l._ or 1,200_l._, that he and Mrs. Faraday lived in a simple\r\nmanner--comfortably, it is true, but not luxuriously--and that his\r\nwhole income was disposed of in some way, there can be little doubt\r\nthat his gifts amounted to several hundred pounds per annum.\r\n\r\nBut it was not in monetary gifts alone that his kindness to the\r\ndistressed was shown. Time was spent as freely as money; and an\r\nengrossing scientific research would not be allowed to stand in the\r\nway of his succouring the sorrowful. Many persons have told me of\r\nhis self-denying deeds on behalf of those who were ill, and of his\r\nencouraging words. He had indeed a heart ever ready to sympathize. Thus\r\nmeeting once in the neighbourhood of Hampton Court an old friend who\r\nhad retired there invalided and was being drawn about in a Bath chair,\r\nhe is said to have burst into tears.\r\n\r\nWhen eight years ago my wife and my only son were taken away together,\r\nand I lay ill of the same fatal disease, he called at my house, and\r\nin spite of remonstrances found his way into the infected chamber. He\r\nwould have taken me by the hand if I had allowed him; and then he sat\r\na while by my bedside, consoling me with his sympathy and cheering me\r\nwith the Christian hope.\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that this kindliness took the hearts of men captive;\r\nand this quality was, like mercy, \"twice blessed; it blesseth him\r\nthat gives, and him that takes.\" The feeling awakened in the minds of\r\nothers by this kindliness was indeed a source of the purest pleasure\r\nto himself; trifling proofs of interest or love could easily move his\r\nthankfulness; and he richly enjoyed the appreciation of his scientific\r\nlabours. This would often break forth in words. Thus in the middle of a\r\nletter to A. De la Rive, principally on scientific matters, he writes:--\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember one hot day, I cannot tell how many years ago, when I\r\nwas hot and thirsty in Geneva, and you took me to your house in the\r\ntown and gave me a glass of water and raspberry vinegar? That glass of\r\ndrink is refreshing to me still.\"\r\n\r\nAgain: \"Tyndall, the sweetest reward of my work is the sympathy and\r\ngood-will which it has caused to flow in upon me from all quarters of\r\nthe world.\"\r\n\r\nBut to estimate rightly this amiability of character, it must\r\nbe distinctly remembered that it was not that superabundance of\r\ngood-nature which renders some men incapable of holding their own, or\r\nrebuking what they know to be wrong. In proof of this his letters to\r\nthe spiritualists might be quoted; but the following have not hitherto\r\nseen the light. They are addressed to two different parties whose\r\ninventions came officially before him.\r\n\r\n\"You write 'private' on the outside of your official communication, and\r\n'confidential' within. I will take care to respect these instructions\r\nas far as falls within my duty; but I can have nothing private or\r\nconfidential _as regards the Trinity House_, which is my chief.\r\nWhatever opinion I send to them I must accompany with the papers you\r\nsend me. If therefore you wish anything held back from them, send me\r\nanother official answer, and I will return you the one I have, marked\r\n'confidential.' Our correspondence is indeed likely to become a little\r\nirregular, because your papers have not come to me through the Trinity\r\nHouse. You will feel that I cannot communicate any opinion I may form\r\nto you: I am bound to the Trinity House, to whom I must communicate in\r\nconfidence. I have no objection to your knowing my conclusions; but the\r\n_Trinity House_ is the fit judge of the use it may make of them, or\r\nthe degree of confidence they may think they deserve, or the parties to\r\nwhom they may choose to communicate them.\"\r\n\r\nBy a foot-note it appears that the _private and confidential_\r\ncommunication was returned to the writer, by desire, four days\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n \"SIR,\r\n\r\n \"I have received your note and read your pamphlet. There is nothing in\r\n either which makes it at all desirable to me to see your apparatus,\r\n for I have not time to spare to look at a matter two or three\r\n times over. In referring to ----, I suppose you refer also to his\r\n application to the Trinity House. In that case I shall hear from him\r\n _through the Trinity House_. He has, however, certain inquiries (which\r\n I have no doubt have gone to him long ago through the Trinity House)\r\n to answer before I shall think it necessary to take any further steps\r\n in the matter. With these, however, I suppose you have nothing to do.\r\n\r\n \"Are you aware that many years ago our Institution was lighted up\r\n for months, if not for years together, by oil-gas (or, as you call\r\n it, olefiant gas), compressed into cylinders to the extent of thirty\r\n atmospheres, and brought to us from a distance? I have no idea that\r\n the patent referred to at the bottom of page 9 could stand for an hour\r\n in a court of law. I think, too, you are wrong in misapplying the\r\n word _olefiant_. It already belongs to a particular gas, and cannot,\r\n without confusion, be used as you use it.\r\n\r\n                              \"I am Sir,\r\n\r\n                                  \"Your obedient Servant,\r\n\r\n                                               \"M. FARADAY.\"\r\n\r\n \"SIR,\r\n\r\n \"Thanks for your letter. At the close of it you ask me _privately_ and\r\n confidingly for the encouragement my opinion might give you if _this\r\n power_ gas-light is fit for lighthouses. I am unable to assent to your\r\n request, as my position at the Trinity House requires that I should be\r\n able to take up any subject, applications, or documents they may bring\r\n before me in a perfectly unbiassed condition of mind.\r\n\r\n                             \"I am, Sir,\r\n\r\n                                 \"Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n                                               \"M. FARADAY.\"\r\n\r\nThe kindliness which shed its genial radiance on every worthy object\r\naround, glowed most warmly on the domestic hearth. Little expressions\r\nin his writings often reveal it, as when we read in his Swiss journal\r\nabout Interlaken: \"Clout-nail making goes on here rather considerably,\r\nand is a very neat and pretty operation to observe. I love a smith's\r\nshop, and anything relating to smithery. My father was a smith.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he was sitting to Noble for his bust, it happened one day that\r\nthe sculptor, in giving the finishing touches to the marble, made\r\na clattering with his chisels: noticing that his sitter appeared\r\n_distrait_, he said that he feared the jingling of the tools had\r\nannoyed him, and that he was weary. \"No, my dear Mr. Noble,\" said\r\nFaraday, putting his hand on his shoulder, \"but the noise reminded me\r\nof my father's anvil, and took me back to my boyhood.\"\r\n\r\nThis deep affection peeps out constantly in his letters to different\r\nmembers of his family, \"bound up together,\" as he wrote to his\r\nsister-in-law, \"in the one hope, and in faith and love which is in\r\nJesus Christ.\" But it was towards his wife that his love glowed most\r\nintensely. Yet how can we properly speak of this sacred relationship,\r\nespecially as the mourning widow is still amongst us? It may suffice\r\nto catch the glimpse that is reflected in the following extract from a\r\nletter he wrote to Mrs. Andrew Crosse on the death of her husband:--\r\n\r\n                                              \"_July 12, 1855._\r\n\r\n \"... Believe that I sympathize with you most deeply, for I enjoy in my\r\n life-partner those things which you speak of as making you feel your\r\n loss so heavily.\r\n\r\n \"It is the kindly domestic affections, the worthiness, the mutual aid\r\n in sorrow, the mutual joy in happiness that has existed, which makes\r\n the rupture of such a tie as yours so heavy to bear; and yet you would\r\n not wish it otherwise, for the remembrance of those things brings\r\n solace with the grief. I speak, thinking what my own trouble would\r\n be if I lost my partner; and I try to comfort you in the only way in\r\n which I think I could be comforted.\r\n\r\n                                                  \"M. FARADAY.\"\r\n\r\nThere was, as Tyndall has observed, a mixture of chivalry with this\r\naffection. In his book of diplomas he made the following remarkable\r\nentry:--\r\n\r\n                                         \"_25th January, 1847_.\r\n\r\n \"Amongst these records and events, I here insert the date of one\r\n which, as a source of honour and happiness, far exceeds all the rest.\r\n We were _married_ on June 12, 1821.\r\n\r\n                                                  \"M. FARADAY.\"\r\n\r\nOn the character of Faraday, these two qualities of reverence and\r\nkindliness have appeared to me singularly influential. Among the ways\r\nin which they manifested themselves was that beautiful combination of\r\nfirmness and gentleness which has been frequently remarked: intimately\r\nassociated with them also were his simplicity and truthfulness. These\r\npoints must have made themselves evident already, but they deserve\r\nfurther illustration.\r\n\r\nIn his early days, \"one Sabbath morning his swift and sober steps were\r\ncarrying him along the Holborn pavement towards his meeting-house, when\r\nsome small missile struck him smartly on the hat. He would have thought\r\nit an accident and passed on, when a second and a third rap caused him\r\nto turn and look just in time to perceive a face hastily withdrawn from\r\na window in the upper story of a closed linendraper's establishment.\r\nRoused by the affront, he marched up to the door and rapped. The\r\nservant opening it said there was no one at home, but Faraday declared\r\nhe knew better, and desired to be shown upstairs. Opposition still\r\nbeing made, he pushed on, made his way up through the house, opened\r\nthe door of an upper room, discovering a party of young drapers'\r\nassistants, who at once professed they knew nothing of the motive of\r\nthis sudden visit. But the hunter had now run his game to earth: he\r\ntaxed them sharply with their annoyance of wayfarers on the Sabbath,\r\nand said that unless an apology were made at once, they should hear\r\nfrom their employer of something much to their disadvantage. An apology\r\nwas made forthwith.\"[13]\r\n\r\nLong, long after this event, Dr. and Mrs. Faraday, with Dr. Tyndall,\r\nwere returning one evening from Mr. Gassiot's, on Clapham Common: a\r\ndense fog came on, and they did not know where they were. The two\r\ngentlemen got out of their vehicle, and walked to a house and knocked.\r\nA man appeared, first at a window and afterwards at the door, very\r\nangry indeed at the disturbance, and demanded to know their business.\r\nFaraday, in his calm, irresistible manner, explained the situation and\r\ntheir object in knocking. The man instantly changed his tone, looked\r\nfoolish, and muttered something about being in a fright lest his house\r\nof business was on fire.\r\n\r\nAs to simplicity of character: when, in the course of writing this\r\nbook, I have spoken to his acquaintances about Faraday, the most\r\nfrequent comment has been in such words as, \"Oh! he was a beautiful\r\ncharacter, and so simple-minded.\" I have tried to ascertain the cause\r\nof this simple-mindedness, and I believe it was the consciousness that\r\nhe was meaning to do right himself, and the belief that others whom\r\nhe addressed meant to do right too, and so he could just let them see\r\neverything that was passing through his mind. And while he knew no\r\nreason for concealment, there was no trace of self-conceit about him,\r\nnor any pretence at being what he was not. To illustrate this quality\r\nis not so easy; the indications of it, like his humour, were generally\r\ntoo delicate to be transferred to paper; but perhaps the following\r\nletter will do as well as anything else, for there are few philosophers\r\nwho could have written so naturally about the pleasures of a pantomime\r\nand then about his highest hopes:--\r\n\r\n                                        \"ROYAL INSTITUTION, LONDON, W.\r\n\r\n                                            \"_1st January, 1857._\r\n\r\n \"MY DEAR MISS COUTTS,\r\n\r\n \"You are very kind to think of our pleasure and send us entrance to\r\n your box for to-morrow night. We thank you very sincerely, and I mean\r\n to enjoy it, for I still have a sympathy with children and all their\r\n thoughts and pleasure. Permit me to wish you very sincerely a happy\r\n year; and also to Mrs. Brown. With some of us our greatest happiness\r\n will be content mingled with patience; but there is much happiness in\r\n that and the expected end.\r\n\r\n                                   \"Ever your obliged Servant,\r\n\r\n                                                  \"M. FARADAY.\"[14]\r\n\r\nAs to truthfulness: he was not only truthful in the common acceptation\r\nof the word, but he did not allow, either in himself or others,\r\nhasty conclusions, random assertions, or slippery logic. \"At such\r\ntimes he had a way of repeating the suspicious statement very slowly\r\nand distinctly, with an air of wondering scrutiny as if it had\r\nastonished him. His irony was then irresistible, and always produced a\r\nmodification of the objectionable phrase.\"\r\n\r\nOne Friday evening there was exhibited an improved Davy lamp, with an\r\neulogistic description. Faraday added the words, \"The opinion of the\r\ninventor.\"\r\n\r\n\"An acquaintance rather given to inflict tedious narratives on his\r\nfriends was descanting to Faraday on the iniquity of some coachman\r\nwho had set him down the previous night in the middle of a dark and\r\nmiry road,--'in fact,' said the irksome drawler, 'in a perfect morass;\r\nand there I was, as you may imagine, half the night, plunging and\r\nstruggling to get out of this dreadful morass.' 'More ass you!' rapped\r\nout the philosopher at the top of his scale of laughter.\" This was\r\na rare instance, for it was only when much provoked that he would\r\nperpetrate a pun, or depart from the kind courtesy of his habitual talk.\r\n\r\nThat he was quite ready to give up a statement or view when it was\r\nproved by others to be incorrect, is shown by the Preface to the\r\nvolumes in which are reprinted his \"Experimental Researches.\" \"In\r\ngiving advice,\" says his niece Miss Reid, \"he always went back to first\r\nprinciples, to the true right and wrong of questions, never allowing\r\ndeviations from the simple straightforward path of duty to be justified\r\nby custom or precedent; and he judged himself strictly by the same rule\r\nwhich he laid down for others.\"\r\n\r\nThese beauties of character were not marred by serious defects or\r\nopposing faults. \"He could not be too closely approached. There were\r\nno shabby places or ugly comers in his mind.\" Yet he was very far from\r\nbeing one of those passionless men who resemble a cold statue rather\r\nthan throbbing flesh and blood. He was no \"model of all the virtues,\"\r\ndreadfully uninteresting, and discouraging to those who feel such calm\r\nperfection out of their reach. His inner life was a battle, with its\r\nwounds as well as its victory. Proud by nature, and quick-tempered,\r\nhe must have found the curb often necessary; but notwithstanding the\r\nrapidity of his actions and thoughts, he knew how to keep a tight rein\r\non that fiery spirit.\r\n\r\nI have listened attentively to every remark in disparagement of\r\nFaraday's character, but the only serious ones have appeared to me\r\nto arise from a misunderstanding of the man, a misunderstanding the\r\nmore easy because his standard of right and wrong, and of his own\r\nduty, often differed from the notions current around him. Still, it\r\nmay be true that his extreme sensitiveness led him sometimes to do\r\nscant justice to those who, he imagined, were treading too closely\r\nin his own footsteps; as, for instance, when Nobili brought out some\r\nbeautiful experiments on magnetism, just after the short notice of his\r\nown discoveries in 1831 which Faraday had sent to M. Hachette, and\r\nwhich was communicated to the Académie des Sciences. It is true also\r\nthat, with his great caution and his repugnance to moral evil, he was\r\nmore disposed to turn away in disgust from an erring companion than to\r\nendeavour to reclaim him. It has also been imputed to him as a fault\r\nthat he founded no school, and took no young man by the hand as Davy\r\nhad taken him. That this was rather his misfortune than his fault,\r\nwould appear from words he once wrote to Miss Moore: \"I have often\r\nendeavoured to discover a genius, but have not been very successful,\r\nthough many cases seemed promising at first.\" The world would doubtless\r\nhave been the gainer if he had stamped his own image on the minds\r\nof a group of disciples: but a man cannot do everything; and had\r\nFaraday been more of a teacher, he would perhaps have been less of an\r\ninvestigator.\r\n\r\nOf course Faraday was subject, like other men, to errors of judgment,\r\nand it was impossible, even if desirable, always to avoid giving\r\noffence. Thus he was constantly pestered for his autograph; and instead\r\nof throwing the applications into his waste-paper basket, he had a\r\nformal circular lithographed excusing himself from complying. This\r\noffended more than one recipient; and he was roughly made aware of it\r\nby once having the circular returned from St. Louis with a scurrilous\r\ncomment, and the postage from America not prepaid. He never again used\r\nthe printed form, Miss Barnard undertaking to answer all such requests.\r\n\r\nIt has been previously remarked that Faraday took little part in social\r\nmovements, and went little into society, but it must not be supposed\r\nthat he was by any means unsocial. It seems probable that his freedom\r\nin this matter was somewhat hampered by the principles in which he had\r\nbeen brought up: it is certain that he was restrained by the desire\r\nto give all the time and energy he could to scientific research. Yet\r\npleasant stories are told of his occasional appearances at social\r\ngatherings. Thus he liked to attend the Royal Academy dinners, and\r\nin earlier days he enjoyed the artistic and musical _conversaziones_\r\nat Hullmandel's, where Stanfield Turner and Landseer met Garcia and\r\nMalibran; and sometimes he joined this pleasant company at supper and\r\ncharades, at others in their excursions up the river in an eight-oared\r\ncutter. Captain Close has described to me how, when the French\r\nLighthouse authorities put up the screw-pile light on the sands near\r\nCalais, they invited the Trinity House officers and Faraday to inspect\r\nit. A dinner was arranged for them after the inspection, and M. Reynaud\r\nproposed the health of the _étranger célèbre_. A young engineer took\r\nexception to Faraday being called a stranger--since he had been at St.\r\nCyr he had known the great Englishman well by his works. The Professor\r\nreplied to the compliment in the language of his hosts, with a few\r\nof his happy and kindly remarks. A gentleman high in the diplomatic\r\nservice, who was present, remarked that Faraday had said many things\r\nwhich were not French, but not a word which ought not to be so.\r\n\r\nMore unrestricted was Faraday's sympathy with Nature. He felt the\r\npoetry of the changing seasons, but there were two aspects of Nature\r\nthat especially seemed to claim communion with his spirit: he delighted\r\nin a thunderstorm, and he experienced a pleasurable sadness as the\r\norange sunset faded into the evening twilight. There are other\r\nminds to which both these sensations are familiar, but they seem to\r\nhave been felt with great intensity by him. No doubt his electrical\r\nknowledge added much to his interest in the grand discharges from the\r\nthunder-clouds, but it will hardly account for his standing long at a\r\nwindow watching the vivid flashes, a stranger to fear, with his mind\r\nfull of lofty thoughts, or perhaps of high communings. Sometimes, too,\r\nif the storm was at a little distance, he would summon a cab, and, in\r\nspite of the pelting rain, drive to the scene of awful beauty.\r\n\r\nOn a clear starry night Captain Close quoted to him the words of\r\nLorenzo in the \"Merchant of Venice:\"--\r\n\r\n          ... \"Look, how the floor of heaven\r\n          Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold;\r\n          There's not the smallest orb, which thou behold'st,\r\n          But in his motion like an angel sings,\r\n          Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;\r\n          Such harmony is in immortal souls;\r\n          But, whilst this muddy vesture of decay\r\n          Doth grossly close us in, we cannot hear it.\"\r\n\r\nFaraday, who happened not to be familiar with the passage, made his\r\nfriend repeat it over and over again as he drank in the whole meaning\r\nof the poetry, for there is a true sense in which no other mortal had\r\never opened his ears so fully to the harmony of the universe.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the plains of mental mediocrity there occasionally rise the\r\nmountains of genius, and from the dead level of selfish respectability\r\nthere stand out now and then the peaks of moral greatness. Neither\r\nkind of excellence is so common as we could wish it, and it is a rare\r\ncoincidence when, as in Socrates, the two meet in the same individual.\r\nIn Faraday we have a modern instance. There are persons now living who\r\nwatched this man of strong will and intense feelings raising himself\r\nfrom the lower ranks of society, yet without losing his balance; rather\r\ngrowing in simplicity, disinterestedness, and humility, as princes\r\nbecame his correspondents and all the learned bodies of the world vied\r\nwith each other to do him homage; still finding his greatest happiness\r\nat home, though reigning in the affections of all his fellows,--loving\r\nevery honest man, however divergent in opinion, and loved most by those\r\nwho knew him best.\r\n\r\nThis is the phenomenon. By what theory is it to be accounted for?\r\n\r\nThe secret did not lie in the nature of his pursuits. This cannot\r\nbe better shown than in the following incident furnished me by Mrs.\r\nCrosse:--\"One morning, a few months after we were married, my husband\r\ntook me to the Royal Institution to call on Mr. and Mrs. Faraday. I had\r\nnot seen the laboratory there, and the philosopher very kindly took us\r\nover the Institution, explaining for my information many objects of\r\ninterest. His great vivacity and cheeriness of manner surprised me in\r\na man who devoted his life to such abstruse studies, but I have since\r\nlearnt to know that the highest philosophical nature is often, indeed\r\ngenerally, united with an almost childlike simplicity.\r\n\r\n\"After viewing the ample appliances for experimental research, and\r\nfeeling impressed by the scientific atmosphere of the place, I turned\r\nand said, 'Mr. Faraday, you must be very happy in your position and\r\nwith your pursuits, which elevate you entirely out of the meaner\r\naspects and lower aims of common life.'\r\n\r\n\"He shook his head, and with that wonderful mobility of countenance\r\nwhich was characteristic, his expression of joyousness changed to one\r\nof profound sadness, he replied: 'When I quitted business, and took\r\nto science as a career, I thought I had left behind me all the petty\r\nmeannesses and small jealousies which hinder man in his moral progress;\r\nbut I found myself raised into another sphere, only to find poor human\r\nnature just the same everywhere--subject to the same weaknesses and the\r\nsame self-seeking, however exalted the intellect.'\r\n\r\n\"These were his words as well as I can recollect; and, looking at that\r\ngood and great man, I thought I had never seen a countenance which so\r\nimpressed me with the characteristic of perfect unworldliness. We know\r\nhow his life proved that this rare qualification was indeed his.\"\r\n\r\n\"Childlike simplicity:\" \"unworldliness.\" Where was the tree rooted\r\nthat bore such beautiful blossoms? Faraday had learnt in the school of\r\nChrist to become \"a little child,\" and he loved not the world because\r\nthe love of the Father was in him.\r\n\r\nWe have a charming glimpse of this in an extract which Professor\r\nTyndall has given from an old paper in which he wrote his impressions\r\nafter one of his earliest dinners with the philosopher:--\"At two\r\no'clock he came down for me. He, his niece, and myself formed the\r\nparty. 'I never give dinners,' he said; 'I don't know how to give\r\ndinners; and I never dine out. But I should not like my friends to\r\nattribute this to a wrong cause. I act thus for the sake of securing\r\ntime for work, and not through religious motives as some imagine.' He\r\nsaid grace. I am almost ashamed to call his prayer a 'saying' of grace.\r\nIn the language of Scripture, it might be described as the petition\r\nof a son into whose heart God had sent the Spirit of His Son, and who\r\nwith absolute trust asked a blessing from his father. We dined on roast\r\nbeef, Yorkshire pudding, and potatoes, drank sherry, talked of research\r\nand its requirements, and of his habit of keeping himself free from the\r\ndistractions of society. He was bright and joyful--boylike, in fact,\r\nthough he is now sixty-two. His work excites admiration, but contact\r\nwith him warms and elevates the heart. Here, surely, is a strong man.\r\nI love strength, but let me not forget the example of its union with\r\nmodesty, tenderness, and sweetness, in the character of Faraday.\"\r\n\r\nBut his religion deserves a closer attention. When an errand-boy, we\r\nfind him hurrying the delivery of his newspapers on a Sunday morning\r\nso as to get home in time to make himself neat to go with his parents\r\nto chapel: his letters when abroad indicate the same disposition;\r\nyet he did not make any formal profession of his faith till a month\r\nafter his marriage, when nearly thirty years of age. Of his spiritual\r\nhistory up to that period little is known, but there seem to be good\r\ngrounds for believing that he did not accept the religion of his\r\nfathers without a conscientious inquiry into its truth. It would be\r\ndifficult to conceive of his acting otherwise. But after he joined the\r\nSandemanian Church, his questionings were probably confined to matters\r\nof practical duty; and to those who knew him best nothing could appear\r\nstronger than his conviction of the reality of the things he believed.\r\nIn order to understand the life and character of Faraday, it is\r\nnecessary to bear in mind not merely that he was a Christian, but that\r\nhe was a Sandemanian. From his earliest years that religious system\r\nstamped its impress deeply on his mind, it surrounded the blacksmith's\r\nson with an atmosphere of unusual purity and refinement, it developed\r\nthe unselfishness of his nature, and in his after career it fenced his\r\nlife from the worldliness around, as well as from much that is esteemed\r\nas good by other Christian bodies. To this small self-contained sect he\r\nclung with warm attachment; he was precluded from Christian communion\r\nor work outside their circle, but his sympathies at least burst all\r\nnarrow bounds. Thus the Abbé Moigno tells us that at Faraday's request\r\nhe one day introduced him to Cardinal Wiseman. The interview was very\r\ncordial, and his Eminence did not hesitate frankly and good-naturedly\r\nto ask Faraday if, in his deepest conviction, he believed all the\r\nChurch of Christ, holy, catholic, and apostolical, was shut up in\r\nthe little sect in which he bore rule. \"Oh no!\" was the reply; \"but\r\nI do believe from the bottom of my soul that Christ is with us.\"\r\nThere were other points, too, in his character which reflected the\r\ncolouring of the religious school to which he belonged. Thus, while\r\nhumility is inseparable from a Christian life, there is a special\r\nphase of that virtue bred of those doctrines which teach that all our\r\nrighteousness must be the unmerited gift of another: these doctrines\r\nare strongly insisted upon in the Sandemanian Church, and this humility\r\nwas acquired in an intense degree by its minister. Again, while all\r\nChristians deplore the terrible amount of folly and sin in the world,\r\nmost recognize also a large amount of good, and believe in progressive\r\nimprovement; but small communities are apt to take gloomy views, and\r\nso did Faraday, notwithstanding his personal happiness, and his firm\r\nconviction that \"there is One above who worketh in all things, and who\r\ngoverns even in the midst of that misrule to which the tendencies and\r\npowers of men are so easily perverted.\"\r\n\r\nIn writing to Professor Schönbein and a few other kindred spirits he\r\nwould turn naturally enough from scientific to religious thoughts,\r\nand back again to natural philosophy, but he generally kept these two\r\ndepartments of his mental activity strangely distinct; yet of course it\r\nwas well known that the Professor at Albemarle Street was one of that\r\nlong line of scientific men, beginning with the _savants_ of the East,\r\nwho have brought to the Redeemer the gold, frankincense, and myrrh of\r\ntheir adoration.\r\n\r\nBut the peculiar features of Faraday's spiritual life are matters\r\nof minor importance: the genuineness of his religious character is\r\nacknowledged by all. We have admired his faithfulness, his amiability\r\nof disposition, and his love of justice and truth; how far these\r\nqualities were natural gifts, like his clearness of intellect, we\r\ncannot precisely tell; but that he exercised constant self-control\r\nwithout becoming hard, ascended the pathway of fame without ever losing\r\nhis balance, and shed around himself a peculiar halo of love and\r\njoyousness, must be attributed in no small degree to a heart at peace\r\nwith God, and to the consciousness of a higher life.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] Bacon's \"Novum Organum,\" i. 1.\r\n\r\n[12] Bence Jones has used the Greek agapê; and it was just\r\nthis ideal of Christian love which Faraday set before himself.\r\n\r\n[13] For this anecdote, and some others in inverted commas, I am\r\nindebted to Mr. Frank Barnard.\r\n\r\n[14] In another letter that Lady Burdett Coutts has kindly sent\r\nme, Faraday says: \"We had your box once before, I remember, for a\r\npantomime, which is always interesting to me because of the immense\r\nconcentration of means which it requires.\" In a third he makes admiring\r\ncomments on Fechter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.\r\n\r\nFRUITS OF HIS EXPERIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who loved Faraday would treasure every word that he wrote, and to\r\nthem the life and letters which Bence Jones has given to the world will\r\nbe inestimable; but from the multitude who knew him only at a distance,\r\nwe can expect no enthusiasm of admiration. Yet all will readily believe\r\nthat through the writings of such a genius there must be scattered\r\nnuggets of intellectual gold, even when he is not treating directly of\r\nscientific subjects. Some of these relate to questions of permanent\r\ninterest, and such nuggets it is my aim to separate and lay before the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nWhen quite a young man he drew the following ideal portrait:--\"The\r\nphilosopher should be a man willing to listen to every suggestion,\r\nbut determined to judge for himself. He should not be biassed by\r\nappearances, have no favourite hypothesis, be of no school, and in\r\ndoctrine have no master. He should not be a respecter of persons, but\r\nof things. Truth should be his primary object. If to these qualities\r\nbe added industry, he may indeed hope to walk within the veil of the\r\ntemple of Nature.\" This ideal he must steadily have kept before\r\nhim, and not unfrequently in after days he gave utterance to similar\r\nthoughts. Here are two instances, the first from a lecture thirty\r\nyears afterwards, the second from a private letter:--\"We may be _sure_\r\nof facts, but our interpretation of facts we should doubt. He is\r\nthe wisest philosopher who holds his theory with some doubt; who is\r\nable to proportion his judgment and confidence to the value of the\r\nevidence set before him, taking a fact for a fact, and a supposition\r\nfor a supposition; as much as possible keeping his mind free from all\r\nsource of prejudice, or, where he cannot do this (as in the case of a\r\ntheory), remembering that such a source is there.\" The letter is to Mr.\r\nFrederick Field, and relates to a paper on the existence of silver in\r\nthe water of the ocean.\r\n\r\n                             \"ROYAL INSTITUTION, _21st October, 1856_.\r\n\r\n \"MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n \"Your paper looks so well, that though I am of course unable to become\r\n security for the facts, I have still thought it my duty to send it\r\n to the Royal Society. Whether it will appear there or not I cannot\r\n say,--no one can say even for his own papers; but for my part, I\r\n think that as facts are the foundation of science, however they may\r\n be interpreted, so they are most valuable, and often more so than the\r\n interpretations founded upon them. I hope your further researches will\r\n confirm those you have obtained: but I would not be too hasty with\r\n them,--rather wait a while, and make them quite secure.\r\n\r\n                         \"I am, Sir, your obliged Servant,\r\n\r\n                                                     \"M. FARADAY.\"\r\n\r\nHow pleasant it would have been to peep into his mind and watch the\r\nprocess by which he was transformed into the very image of his ideal\r\nphilosopher! He has partially told us the secret in two remarkable\r\nlectures, one of which was delivered before the City Philosophical\r\nSociety when he was only twenty-seven years of age, while the other\r\nformed part of a series on Education at Albemarle Street. Copious\r\nextracts from the first are given by Dr. Bence Jones; the second was\r\npublished at the time. In the early lecture, which is \"On the Forms of\r\nMatter,\" he points out the advantages and dangers of systematizing, and\r\nwinds up his remarks with--\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is more difficult and requires more care than philosophical\r\ndeduction, nor is there anything more adverse to its accuracy than\r\nfixidity of opinion. The man who is certain he is right is almost\r\nsure to be wrong, and he has the additional misfortune of inevitably\r\nremaining so. All our theories are fixed upon uncertain data, and all\r\nof them want alteration and support. Ever since the world began opinion\r\nhas changed with the progress of things; and it is something more than\r\nabsurd to suppose that we have a sure claim to perfection, or that we\r\nare in possession of the highest stretch of intellect which has or can\r\nresult from human thought. Why our successors should not displace us\r\nin our opinions, as well as in our persons, it is difficult to say; it\r\never has been so, and from analogy would be supposed to continue so;\r\nand yet, with all this practical evidence of the fallibility of our\r\nopinions, all, and none more than philosophers, are ready to assert the\r\nreal truth of their opinions.\"\r\n\r\nIn his discourse entitled \"Observations on Mental Education,\"\r\nlike a skilful physician he first determines what is the great\r\nintellectual disease from which the community suffers--\"deficiency\r\nof judgment,\"--and then he lays down rules by which each man may\r\nattempt his own cure. For this self-education, \"it is necessary that\r\na man examine himself, and that not carelessly.... A first result of\r\nthis habit of mind will be an internal conviction of _ignorance in\r\nmany things respecting which his neighbours are taught_, and that his\r\nopinions and conclusions on such matters ought to be advanced with\r\nreservation. A mind so disciplined will be _open to correction upon\r\ngood grounds in all things_, even in those it is best acquainted with;\r\nand should familiarize itself with the idea of such being the case....\r\nIt is right that we should stand by and act on our principles, but\r\nnot right to hold them in obstinate blindness, or retain them when\r\nproved to be erroneous.\" And then he gives cases from his own mental\r\nhistory:--\"I remember the time when I believed a spark was produced\r\nbetween voltaic metals as they approached to contact (and the reasons\r\nwhy it might be possible yet remain); but others doubted the fact and\r\ndenied the proofs, and on re-examination I found reason to admit their\r\ncorrections were well founded. Years ago I believed that electrolites\r\ncould conduct electricity by a conduction proper; that has also been\r\ndenied by many through long time: though I believed myself right, yet\r\ncircumstances have induced me to pay that respect to criticism as\r\nto re-investigate the subject, and I have the pleasure of thinking\r\nthat nature confirms my original conclusions. So, though evidence may\r\nappear to preponderate extremely in favour of a certain decision, it\r\nis wise and proper to hear a counter-statement. You can have no idea\r\nhow often, and how much, under such an impression, I have desired that\r\nthe marvellous descriptions which have reached me might prove, in some\r\npoints, correct; and how frequently I have submitted myself to hot\r\nfires, to friction with magnets, to the passes of hands, &c., lest I\r\nshould be shutting out discovery;--encouraging the strong desire that\r\nsomething might be true, and that I might aid in the development of\r\na new force of nature.\" He turns then to another evil, and its cure:\r\n\"The _tendency to deceive ourselves_ regarding all we wish for, and\r\nthe necessity of _resistance to these desires_; ... the force of the\r\ntemptation which urges us to seek for such evidence and appearances as\r\nare in favour of our desires, and to disregard those which oppose them,\r\nis wonderfully great. In this respect we are all, more or less, active\r\npromoters of error.\" He winds up his remarks upon this subject with the\r\nitalicized sentence: \"I will simply express my strong belief that that\r\npoint of self-education which consists in teaching the mind to resist\r\nits desires and inclinations until they are proved to be right, is the\r\nmost important of all, not only in things of natural philosophy, but\r\nin every department of daily life.\" He turns then to the necessity of\r\na \"habit of forming clear and precise ideas,\" and of expressing them\r\nin \"clear and definite language:\"--\"When the different data required\r\nare in our possession, and we have succeeded in forming a clear idea\r\nof each, the mind should be instructed to _balance them_ one against\r\nanother, and not suffered carelessly to hasten to a conclusion.\" \"As a\r\nresult of this wholesome mental condition, we should be able to form a\r\n_proportionate judgment_;\" that is, one proportionate to the evidence,\r\nranging through all degrees of probability--while he adds: \"Frequently\r\nthe exercise of the judgment ought to end in _absolute reservation_.\"\r\n\r\n\"The education which I advocate,\" says Faraday, \"will require\r\n_patience_ and _labour of thought_ in every exercise tending to\r\nimprove the judgment. It matters not on what subject a person's mind\r\nis occupied; he should engage in it with the conviction that it will\r\nrequire mental labour.\" \"Because the education is internal, it is not\r\nthe less needful; nor is it more the duty of a man that he should cause\r\nhis child to be taught, than that he should teach himself. Indolence\r\nmay tempt him to neglect the self-examination and experience which\r\nform his school, and weariness may induce the evasion of the necessary\r\npractices; but surely a thought of the prize should suffice to\r\nstimulate him to the requisite exertion; and to those who reflect upon\r\nthe many hours and days devoted by a lover of sweet sounds to gain a\r\nmoderate facility upon a mere mechanical instrument, it ought to bring\r\na correcting blush of shame if they feel convicted of neglecting the\r\nbeautiful living instrument wherein play all the powers of the mind.\"\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of this discourse the lecturer felt called upon\r\nto limit the range of his remarks:--\"High as man is placed above the\r\ncreatures around him, there is a higher and far more exalted position\r\nwithin his view; and the ways are infinite in which he occupies his\r\nthoughts about the fears, or hopes, or expectations of a future life.\r\nI believe that the truth of that future cannot be brought to his\r\nknowledge by any exertion of his mental powers, however exalted they\r\nmay be; that it is made known to him by other teaching than his own,\r\nand is received through simple belief of the testimony given. Let no\r\none suppose for a moment that the self-education I am about to commend\r\nin respect of the things of this life extends to any considerations\r\nof the hope set before us, as if man by reasoning could find out God.\r\nIt would be improper here to enter upon this subject further than to\r\nclaim an absolute distinction between religious and ordinary belief.\r\nI shall be reproached with the weakness of refusing to apply those\r\nmental operations which I think good in respect of high things to the\r\nvery highest. I am content to bear the reproach. Yet, even in earthly\r\nmatters, I believe that 'the invisible things of Him from the creation\r\nof the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that\r\nare made, even His eternal power and Godhead;' and I have never seen\r\nanything incompatible between those things of man which can be known\r\nby the spirit of man which is within him, and those higher things\r\nconcerning his future which he cannot know by that spirit.\" There is of\r\ncourse a certain truth in this passage; spiritual discernment is a real\r\nthing possessed by some, and not by others; yet is there this absolute\r\ndistinction between religious and ordinary belief? Surely there is\r\nthe same opportunity and the same necessity for careful judgment, and\r\nfor resistance to prejudice or preference, when we are weighing the\r\ncredentials of anything that may come before us purporting to be a\r\nrevelation from above; surely too, if we have satisfied ourselves that\r\nwe possess such a revelation, we must seek for the same clearness of\r\nideas, and must exercise the same patience and labour of thought, if\r\nwe would understand it aright. That mental discipline which fits us\r\nto interpret the works of God cannot but be akin to the intellectual\r\ntraining required for interpreting His word.\r\n\r\nSince Faraday thought and wrote, the question of public education has\r\ntaken a far deeper hold on the feelings and the hopes of the nation,\r\nand it is not merely the extent of the instruction, but its nature\r\nalso, that is discussed. It is held to be no longer right that the\r\nminds of our youth should be fed almost exclusively on the dry husks\r\nof classic or mediæval knowledge, while the rich banquet of modern\r\ndiscovery remains untasted. Yet it is hard for natural science to\r\ngain an honoured place in our venerable scholastic institutions.\r\nFaraday, however, had long formed his conclusions on this subject. In\r\none of his Friday evening discourses he says: \"The development of the\r\napplications of physical science in modern times has become so large\r\nand so essential to the well-being of man, that it may justly be used\r\nas illustrating the true character of pure science as a department of\r\nknowledge, and the claims it may have for consideration by Governments,\r\nUniversities, and all bodies to whom is confided the fostering care\r\nand direction of learning. As a branch of learning, men are beginning\r\nto recognize the right of science to its own particular place; for,\r\nthough flowing in channels utterly different in their course and\r\nend from those of literature, it conduces not less, as a means of\r\ninstruction, to the discipline of the mind, whilst it ministers, more\r\nor less, to the wants, comforts, and proper pleasure, both mental and\r\nbodily, of every individual of every class in life. Until of late\r\nyears, the education for, and recognition of it by the bodies which\r\nmay be considered as governing the general course of all education,\r\nhave been chiefly directed to it only as it could serve professional\r\nservices, viz. those which are remunerated by society; but now the\r\nfitness of university degrees in science is under consideration, and\r\nmany are taking a high view of it, as distinguished from literature,\r\nand think that it may well be studied for its own sake, _i.e._ as a\r\nproper exercise of the human intelligence, able to bring into action\r\nand development all the powers of the mind. As a branch of learning,\r\nit has (without reference to its applications) become as extensive and\r\nvaried as literature; and it has this privilege, that it must ever go\r\non increasing.\"\r\n\r\nOn the subject of scientific education Faraday was examined by the\r\nPublic Schools Commission, November 18th, 1862, and his sentiments\r\nof course appear in their report. He said to them: \"That the natural\r\nknowledge which has been given to the world in such abundance during\r\nthe last fifty years should remain untouched, and that no sufficient\r\nattempt should be made to convey it to the young mind growing up\r\nand obtaining its first views of those things, is to me a matter so\r\nstrange that I find it difficult to understand. Though I think I see\r\nthe opposition breaking away, it is yet a very hard one to overcome.\r\nThat it ought to be overcome I have not the least doubt in the world.\"\r\nLord Clarendon asked him: \"You think it is now knocking at the door,\r\nand there is a prospect of the door being opened?\" \"Yes,\" answered\r\nFaraday, \"and it will make its way, or we shall stay behind other\r\nnations in our mode of education.\" He had been led to the conviction\r\nthat the exclusive attention to literary studies created a tendency to\r\nregard other things as nonsense, or belonging only to the artisan, and\r\nso the mind is positively injured for the reception of real knowledge.\r\nHe says: \"It is the highly educated man that we find coming to us\r\nagain and again, and asking the most simple question in chemistry or\r\nmechanics; and when we speak of such things as the conservation of\r\nforce, the permanency of matter, and the unchangeability of the laws of\r\nnature, they are far from comprehending them, though they have relation\r\nto us in every action of our lives. Many of these instructed persons\r\nare as far from having the power of judging of these things as if their\r\nminds had never been trained.\"\r\n\r\nHe gives his own opinion as to the precise course to be pursued with\r\ngreat diffidence; but it is evident that he would begin the education\r\nin natural science at a pretty early age, and in all cases carry it\r\nup to a certain point. One-fifth of a boy's time might be devoted to\r\nthis purpose at present, though in less than half a century he thinks\r\nscience will deserve and obtain a far larger share. Supposing a boy of\r\neleven years of age and of ordinary intelligence at one of our public\r\nschools: \"I would teach him,\" he says, \"all those things that come\r\nbefore classics in the programme of the London University,--mechanics,\r\nhydrostatics, hydraulics, pneumatics, acoustics, and optics. They\r\nare very simple and easily understood when they are looked at with\r\nattention by both man and boy. With a candle, a lamp, and a lens or\r\ntwo, an intelligent instructor might teach optics in a very short\r\ntime; and so with chemistry. I should desire all these.\" Much would\r\ndepend on the competency and earnestness of the teacher. \"Good lectures\r\nmight do a great deal. They would at all events remove the absolute\r\nignorance which sometimes now appears, but would give a very poor\r\nknowledge of natural things.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps these opinions of one whose lips are now silent will yet have\r\ntheir weight in the discussion of this question both in our highest\r\nseats of learning and in those educational parliaments which have been\r\nlately called into existence in almost every town and district of our\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nFrom the somewhat disparaging remarks about lectures quoted above, it\r\nmust not be supposed that this prince of lecturers depreciated his\r\noffice. \"Lectures,\" he said, \"depend entirely for their value upon the\r\nmanner in which they are given. It is not the matter, it is not the\r\nsubject, so much as the man; but if he is not competent, and does not\r\nfeel that there is a need of competency, to convey his ideas gently and\r\nquietly and simply to the young mind, he simply throws up obstacles,\r\nand will be found using words which they will not comprehend.\" These\r\nwere the words of his later days, but fortunately he felt \"the need\r\nof competency\" before his own habits were formed, and in four letters\r\nto Abbott we find wonderfully sagacious observations on the matter,\r\nwhich it would be well for any young lecturer to study. He describes\r\nthe proper arrangement of a lecture-room, dwelling on the necessity\r\nof good ventilation; and then, having considered the fittest subjects\r\nfor popular lectures, he turns to the character of the audience, and\r\nshows how that must be studied; for some expect to be entertained by\r\nthe manner of the lecturer as well as his subject, while others care\r\nfor something which will instruct. He dwells on the superiority of the\r\neye over the ear as a channel of knowledge, and lays down some rules\r\nfor this kind of instruction, which he of all men subsequently carried\r\nout to perfection. \"Apparatus is an essential part of every lecture in\r\nwhich it can be introduced.... Diagrams and tables, too, are necessary,\r\nor at least add in an eminent degree to the illustration and perfection\r\nof a lecture. When an experimental lecture is to be delivered, and\r\napparatus is to be exhibited, some kind of order should be observed in\r\nthe arrangement of them on the lecture table. Every particular part\r\nillustrative of the lecture should be in view; no one thing should hide\r\nanother from the audience, nor should anything stand in the way of or\r\nobstruct the lecturer. They should be so placed, too, as to produce a\r\nkind of uniformity in appearance. No one part should appear naked and\r\nanother crowded, unless some particular reason exists and makes it\r\nnecessary to be so. At the same time the whole should be so arranged as\r\nto keep one operation from interfering with another.\" A good delivery\r\ncomes in for its share of praise; \"for though to all true philosophers\r\nscience and nature will have charms innumerable in every dress, yet I\r\nam sorry to say that the generality of mankind cannot accompany us one\r\nshort hour unless the path is strewed with flowers.\" Then, \"a lecturer\r\nshould appear easy and collected, undaunted and unconcerned, his\r\nthoughts about him, and his mind clear and free for the contemplation\r\nand description of his subject. His action should not be hasty and\r\nviolent, but slow, easy, and natural, consisting principally in\r\nchanges of the posture of the body, in order to avoid the air of\r\nstiffness or sameness that would otherwise be unavoidable. His whole\r\nbehaviour should evince respect for his audience, and he should in\r\nno case forget that he is in their presence.\" He allows a lecturer\r\nto prepare his discourse in writing, but not to read it before the\r\naudience, and points out how necessary it is \"to raise their interest\r\nat the commencement of the lecture, and by a series of imperceptible\r\ngradations, unnoticed by the company, keep it alive as long as the\r\nsubject demands it.\" This of course forbids breaks in the argument,\r\nor digressions foreign to the main purpose, and limits the length of\r\nthe lecture to a period during which the listeners can pay unwearied\r\nattention. He castigates those speakers who descend so low as \"to angle\r\nfor claps,\" or who throw out hints for commendation, and shows that\r\napologies should be made as seldom as possible. Experiments should\r\nbe to the point, clear, and easily understood: \"they should rather\r\napproach to simplicity, and explain the established principles of the\r\nsubject, than be elaborate and apply to minute phenomena only.... 'Tis\r\nwell, too, when the lecturer has the ready wit and the presence of mind\r\nto turn any casual circumstance to an illustration of his subject.\"\r\nBut experiments should be explained by a satisfactory theory; or if\r\nthe scientific world is divided in opinion, both sides of the question\r\nought to be stated with the strongest arguments for each, that justice\r\nmay be done and honour satisfied.\r\n\r\nOften in later days was his experience in lecturing made use of for\r\nthe benefit of others. \"If,\" he once remarked to a young lecturer, \"I\r\nsaid to my audience, 'This stone will fall to the ground if I open my\r\nhand,' I should open my hand and let it fall. Take nothing for granted\r\nas known; inform the eye at the same time as you address the ear.\" I\r\nremember him once giving me hints on the laying of the lecture table at\r\nthe Institution, and telling me that where possible he was accustomed\r\nto arrange the apparatus in such a way as to suggest the order of the\r\nexperiments. An incident told me by Dr. Carpenter will illustrate some\r\nof the foregoing points. The first time he heard Faraday lecture at\r\nthe Royal Institution, the Professor was explaining the researches\r\nof Melloni on radiant heat. During the discourse he touched on the\r\nrefraction and polarization of heat; and to explain refraction he\r\nshowed the simple experiment of fixing some coloured wafers at the\r\nbottom of a basin, and then pouring in water so as to make them\r\napparently rise. Dr. Carpenter, who had come up from Bristol with grand\r\nideas of the lectures at Albemarle Street, wondered greatly at the\r\nintroduction of so commonplace an experiment. Of course there were many\r\nother illustrations, and beautiful ones too. He went down, however,\r\nafter the lecture, to the table, and among the crowd chatting there was\r\nan old gentleman who remarked, \"I think the best experiment to-night\r\nwas that of the wafers in the basin.\"\r\n\r\nWhen a young lecturer, Faraday took lessons in elocution from Mr.\r\nSmart, and was at great pains to cure himself of any defect of\r\npronunciation or manner; for this purpose he would get a friendly\r\ncritic to form part of his audience. On the fly-leaves of many of the\r\nnotes of his lectures are written the reminders--\"Stand up\"--\"Don't\r\ntalk quick.\" Indeed, in early days it was so much a matter of anxiety\r\nto him that everything in his lectures should be as perfect as\r\npossible, that he not only was accustomed to go over everything again\r\nand again in his mind, but the difficulty of satisfying himself used\r\nto trouble his dreams. I was told this, if I am not mistaken, by\r\nhimself; and it goes far to explain how his discourses possessed such a\r\nfascination.\r\n\r\nSome of his feelings in regard to lecturing may be learnt from\r\nthe following particulars, for which I am indebted to Mr. Charles\r\nTomlinson. They relate to a course of lectures he delivered in 1849 on\r\nStatical Electricity. The first lecture began thus:--\"Time moves on,\r\nand brings changes to ourselves as well as to science. I feel that I\r\nmust soon resign into the hands of my successors the position which\r\nI now occupy at this table. Indeed, I have long felt how much rather\r\nI would sit among you and be instructed than stand here and attempt\r\nto instruct. I have always felt my position in this Institution as a\r\nvery strange one. Coming after such a man as Davy, and associated with\r\nsuch a man as Brande, and having had to make a position for myself, I\r\nhave always felt myself here in a strange position. You will wonder\r\nwhy I make these remarks. It is not from any affectation of modesty\r\nthat I do so, but I feel that loss of memory may soon incapacitate me\r\naltogether for my duties. Without, however, troubling you more about\r\nmyself, let us proceed to the subject before us, and fall back upon\r\nthe beginnings of the wonderful science of electricity. I shall have\r\nto trouble you with very little of theory. The facts are so wonderful\r\nthat I shall not attempt to explain them.\" At the second lecture,\r\n\"Faraday advanced to the table at three o'clock, and began to apologize\r\nfor an obstruction of voice, which indeed was painfully evident. He\r\nsaid that, 'in an engagement where the contracting parties were one\r\nand many, the one ought not on any slight ground to break his part of\r\nthe engagement with the many, and therefore, if the audience would\r\nexcuse his imperfect utterance, he would endeavour--' Murmurs arose:\r\n'Put off the lecture.' Faraday begged to be allowed to go on. A medical\r\nman then rose and said he had given it as his opinion that it would be\r\ndangerous to Dr. Faraday to proceed. Faraday again urged his wish to\r\nproceed--said it was giving so much trouble to the ladies, who had sent\r\naway their carriages, and perhaps put off other engagements. On this\r\nthe whole audience rose as by a single impulse, and a number of persons\r\nsurrounded Faraday, who now yielded to the general desire to spare him\r\nthe pain and inconvenience of lecturing.\" A fortnight elapsed before\r\nhe could again make his appearance, but he continued his course later\r\nthan usual, in order not to deprive his audience of any of the eight\r\nlectures he had undertaken to give them. Prince Albert came to one of\r\nthese extra lectures.\r\n\r\nFaraday's opinion as to the honours due to scientific men from society\r\nor from Government, may be gathered from the following extract from\r\na letter written me by his private friend Mr. Blaikley:--\"On one\r\noccasion, when making some remark in reference to a movement on behalf\r\nof science, I inadvertently spoke of the proper honour due to science.\r\nHe at once remarked, 'I am not one who considers that science can be\r\nhonoured.' I at once saw the point. His views of the grandeur of truth,\r\nwhen once apprehended, raised it far beyond any honour that man could\r\ngive it; but man might honour himself by respecting and acknowledging\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor George Wilson, of Edinburgh, has thus described his first\r\nvisit to the philosopher: \"Faraday was very kind, showed me his whole\r\nlaboratory with labours going on, and talked frankly and kindly; but to\r\nthe usual question of something to do, gave the usual round O answer,\r\nand treated me to a just, but not very cheering animadversion on the\r\nGovernment of this country, which, unlike that of every other civilized\r\ncountry, will give no help to scientific inquiry, and will afford no\r\naid or means of study for young chemists.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take care of your money,\" was his advice to Mr. Joule, then another\r\nyoung aspirant to scientific honours, but who has since rendered the\r\nhighest service to science, without leaning on any hopes of Government\r\nhelp or public support.\r\n\r\nBut the impressions given in conversation may not be always correct.\r\nHappily there exist his written opinions on this subject. In a letter\r\naddressed to Professor Andrews of Belfast, and dated 2nd February,\r\n1843, there occurs this passage:--\"As to the particular point of your\r\nletter about which you honour me by asking my advice, I have no advice\r\nto give; but I have a strong feeling in the matter, and will tell you\r\nwhat I should do. I have always felt that there is something degrading\r\nin offering rewards for intellectual exertion, and that societies or\r\nacademies, or even Kings and Emperors, should mingle in the matter\r\ndoes not remove the degradation, for the feeling which is hurt is a\r\npoint above their condition, and belongs to the respect which a man\r\nowes to himself. With this feeling, I have never since I was a boy\r\naimed at any such prize; or even if, as in your case, they came near\r\nme, have allowed them to move me from my course; and I have always\r\ncontended that such rewards will never move the men who are most worthy\r\nof reward. Still, I think rewards and honours _good_ if properly\r\ndistributed, but they should be given for what a man has done, and\r\nnot offered for what he is to do, or else talent must be considered\r\nas a thing marketable and to be bought and sold, and then down falls\r\nthat high tone of mind which is the best excitement to a man of power,\r\nand will make him do more than any commonplace reward. When a man is\r\nrewarded for his deserts, he honours those who grant the reward, and\r\nthey give it not as a moving impulse to him, but to all those who by\r\nthe reward are led to look to that man for an example.\"\r\n\r\nEleven years afterwards Faraday expressed similar views, but more\r\nfully, in a letter to the late Lord Wrottesley as chairman of the\r\nParliamentary Committee of the British Association:--\r\n\r\n                               \"ROYAL INSTITUTION, _March 10th, 1854_.\r\n\r\n \"MY LORD,\r\n\r\n \"I feel unfit to give a deliberate opinion on the course it might be\r\n advisable for the Government to pursue if it were anxious to improve\r\n the position of science and its cultivators in our country. My course\r\n of life, and the circumstances which make it a happy one for me, are\r\n not those of persons who conform to the usages and habits of society.\r\n Through the kindness of all, from my Sovereign downwards, I have that\r\n which supplies all my need; and in respect of honours, I have, as a\r\n scientific man, received from foreign countries and Sovereigns, those\r\n which, belonging to very limited and select classes, surpass in my\r\n opinion anything that it is in the power of my own to bestow.\r\n\r\n \"I cannot say that I have not valued such distinctions; on the\r\n contrary, I esteem them very highly, but I do not think I have ever\r\n worked for or sought after them. Even were such to be now created\r\n here, the time is past when these would possess any attraction for\r\n me; and you will see therefore how unfit I am, upon the strength of\r\n any personal motive or feeling, to judge of what might be influential\r\n upon the minds of others. Nevertheless, I will make one or two remarks\r\n which have often occurred to my mind.\r\n\r\n \"Without thinking of the effect it might have upon distinguished men\r\n of science, or upon the minds of those who, stimulated to exertion,\r\n might become distinguished, I do think that a Government should\r\n _for its own sake_ honour the men who do honour and service to the\r\n country. I refer now to honours only, not to beneficial rewards; of\r\n such honours I think there are none. Knighthoods and baronetcies are\r\n sometimes conferred with such intentions, but I think them utterly\r\n unfit for that purpose. Instead of conferring distinction, they\r\n confound the man who is one of twenty, or perhaps fifty, with hundreds\r\n of others. They depress rather than exalt him, for they tend to lower\r\n the especial distinction of mind to the commonplaces of society. An\r\n intelligent country ought to recognize the scientific men among its\r\n people as a class. If honours are conferred upon eminence in any\r\n class, as that of the law or the army, they should be in this also.\r\n The aristocracy of the class should have other distinctions than those\r\n of lowly and high-born, rich and poor, yet they should be such as to\r\n be worthy of those whom the Sovereign and the country should delight\r\n to honour, and, being rendered very desirable and even enviable in\r\n the eyes of the aristocracy by birth, should be unattainable except\r\n to that of science. Thus much I think the Government and the country\r\n ought to do, for their own sake and the good of science, more than for\r\n the sake of the men who might be thought worthy of such distinction.\r\n The latter have attained to their fit place, whether the community at\r\n large recognize it or not.\r\n\r\n \"But besides that, and as a matter of reward and encouragement to\r\n those who have not yet risen to great distinction, I think the\r\n Government should, in the very many cases which come before it having\r\n a relation to scientific knowledge, employ men who pursue science,\r\n provided they are also men of business. This is perhaps now done to\r\n some extent, but to nothing like the degree which is practicable with\r\n advantage to all parties. The right means cannot have occurred to a\r\n Government which has not yet learned to approach and distinguish the\r\n class as a whole. * * *\r\n\r\n                         \"I have the honour to be, my Lord,\r\n\r\n                                     \"Your very faithful Servant,\r\n\r\n                                                         \"M. FARADAY.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes people's views on these matters change when the despised\r\ndistinction is actually offered, but it was not so with him; for once,\r\nwhen indirectly sounded as to whether a knighthood would be acceptable,\r\nhe declined the honour, preferring to \"remain plain Michael Faraday to\r\nthe last.\"\r\n\r\nIn this day, when so many allow their names to be used for offices of\r\nwhich they never intended to discharge the duties, the following letter\r\nmay convey an appropriate lesson:--\r\n\r\n                                \"ROYAL INSTITUTION, _Oct. 17th, 1849_.\r\n\r\n \"MY DEAR PERCY,\r\n\r\n \"I cannot be on the committee; I avoid everything of that kind, that I\r\n may keep my stupid mind a little clear. As to being on a committee and\r\n not working, that is worse still. * * *\r\n\r\n                                \"Ever yours and Mrs. Percy's,\r\n\r\n                                                     \"M. FARADAY.\"\r\n\r\nIt is well known that he waged implacable war with the Spiritualists.\r\nEighteen years ago tables took to spinning mysteriously under the\r\nfingers of ladies and gentlemen who sat or stood around the animated\r\nfurniture; much was said about a new force, much too about strange\r\nrevelations from another sphere, but Faraday made a simple apparatus\r\nwhich convinced him and most others that the tables moved through\r\nthe unconscious pressure of the hands that touched them. The account\r\nof this will be found in the _Athenæum_ of July 2, 1853. Three weeks\r\nafterwards he wrote to his friend Schönbein: \"I have not been at work\r\nexcept in turning the tables upon the table-turners, nor should I\r\nhave done that, but that so many inquiries poured in upon me, that\r\nI thought it better to stop the inpouring flood by letting all know\r\nat once what my views and thoughts were. What a weak, credulous,\r\nincredulous, unbelieving, superstitious, bold, frightened,--what a\r\nridiculous world ours is, as far as concerns the mind of man! How\r\nfull of inconsistencies, contradictions, and absurdities it is!\" But\r\nthe believers in these occult phenomena, some of them holding high\r\npositions about the Court, would not let him alone; and there are\r\nmany indications of the annoyance and irritation they caused him.\r\nHe declined to meet the professors of the mysterious art, and the\r\nfollowing letter will serve to show the way in which he regarded them:--\r\n\r\n                                   \"ROYAL INSTITUTION, _Nov. 1, 1864_.\r\n\r\n \"SIR,\r\n\r\n \"I beg to thank you for your papers, but have wasted more thought and\r\n time on so-called spiritual manifestation than it has deserved. Unless\r\n the spirits are utterly contemptible, _they_ will find means to draw\r\n my attention.\r\n\r\n \"How is it that your name is not signed to the testimony that you\r\n give? Are you doubtful even whilst you publish? I've no evidence that\r\n any natural or unnatural power is concerned in the phenomena that\r\n requires investigation or deserves it. If I could consult the spirits,\r\n or move them to make themselves honestly manifest, I would do it. But\r\n I cannot, and am weary of them.\r\n\r\n                           \"I am, Sir, your obedient Servant,\r\n\r\n                                                     \"M. FARADAY.\"\r\n\r\nThere was once a strange statement put forth to the effect that Faraday\r\nsaid electricity was life.[15] He himself denied it indignantly; but\r\nas most falsehoods are perversions of some truth, this one probably\r\noriginated in his experiments on the Gymnotus. He felt an intense\r\ninterest in those marine animals that give shocks, and sought \"to\r\nidentify the living power which they possess, with that which man can\r\ncall into action from inert matter, and by him named electricity.\"[16]\r\nThe most powerful of these is the Gymnotus, or electrical eel, and a\r\nlive specimen of this creature, forty inches long, was secured by the\r\nAdelaide Gallery--a predecessor of the Polytechnic--in the summer of\r\n1838. Four days after its arrival the poor creature lost an eye; for\r\ntwo months it could not be coaxed to eat either meat or fish, worms or\r\nfrogs; but at last one day it killed and devoured four small fishes,\r\nand afterwards swallowed about a fish per diem. It was accustomed to\r\nswim round and round the tank, till a live fish was dropped in, when in\r\nsome cases bending round its victim, it would discharge a shock that\r\nmade the fish float on its back stunned and ready to be sucked into the\r\njaws of its assailant.\r\n\r\nFaraday examined this eel and the water around it, both with his hands\r\nand with special collectors of electricity, and satisfied himself not\r\nmerely of the shock, which was easy enough, but of its power to deflect\r\na galvanometer, to make a magnet, to effect chemical decomposition, and\r\nto give a spark. His account of the experiments terminates with some\r\nspeculations on the connection of this animal electricity with nervous\r\npower; but there the matter rested. His own views were thus expressed\r\nto his friend Dumas:--\"As living creatures produce heat, and a heat\r\ncertainly identical with that of our hearths, why should they not\r\nproduce electricity also, and an electricity in like manner identical\r\nwith that of our machines? But if the heat produced during life, and\r\nnecessary to life, is not life after all, why should electricity itself\r\nbe life? Like heat, like chemical action, electricity is an implement\r\nof life, and nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nWhether the belief that electricity is life would be inconsistent\r\nwith the Christian faith or not, it is clear that when an infidel\r\npreacher asserts that Faraday held such an opinion, his assertion will\r\ninfluence few who are not already disposed to Materialism. Far more\r\ndamaging is it to the cause of religion when her ministers repeat the\r\nassumption of the infidel that those who study the truths of nature\r\nare particularly prone to disbelieve. Yet such statements have been\r\nmade, even with reference to Faraday. I have it on the best authority\r\nthat one of the leading clergymen of the day, preaching on a special\r\noccasion from Peter's words, \"The elements shall melt with fervent\r\nheat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned\r\nup,\" spoke in antagonism to scientific men, alluding to Faraday by\r\nname, and to his computation of the tremendous electrical forces that\r\nwould be produced by sundering the elements of one drop of water. \"They\r\nshall be confuted by their own element--fire,\" added the preacher,\r\ncareless of the conclusion which his audience might legitimately draw\r\nfrom such a two-edged argument. The accuser of the men of science was\r\nmuch astonished when told after his sermon, by a brother clergyman,\r\nthat Faraday and other eminent physicists of the day were believers in\r\na divine revelation.\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted whether Faraday ever tried to form a definite idea\r\nof the relation in which the physical forces stand to the Supreme\r\nIntelligence, as Newton did, or his own friend Sir John Herschel;\r\nnor did he consider it part of his duty as a lecturer to look beyond\r\nthe natural laws he was describing. His practice in this respect has\r\nbeen well described by the Rev. Professor Pritchard:[17]--\"This great\r\nand good man never obtruded the strength of his faith upon those whom\r\nhe publicly addressed; upon principle he was habitually reticent on\r\nsuch topics, because he believed they were ill suited for the ordinary\r\nassemblages of men. Yet on more than one occasion when he had been\r\ndiscoursing on some of the magnificent pre-arrangements of Divine\r\nProvidence so lavishly scattered in nature, I have seen him struggle to\r\nrepress the emotion which was visibly striving for utterance; and then,\r\nat the last, with one single far-reaching word, he would just hint at\r\nhis meaning rather than express it. On such occasions he only who had\r\nears to hear, could hear.\"\r\n\r\nIn his more familiar lectures to the cadets at Woolwich, however, he\r\nmore than hinted at such elevated thoughts. In conversation, too,\r\nFaraday has been known to express his wonder that anyone should fail\r\nto recognize the constant traces of design; and in his writings there\r\nsometimes occur such passages as the following:--\"When I consider the\r\nmultitude of associated forces which are diffused through nature--when\r\nI think of that calm and tranquil balancing of their energies which\r\nenables elements most powerful in themselves, most destructive to the\r\nworld's creatures and economy, to dwell associated together and be made\r\nsubservient to the wants of creation, I rise from the contemplation\r\nmore than ever impressed with the wisdom, the beneficence, and\r\ngrandeur beyond our language to express, of the Great Disposer of all!\"\r\n\r\nFaraday's journals abound with descriptions of \"nature and human\r\nnature.\" He had evidently a keen eye for the beauties of scenery, and\r\noccasionally the objects around him suggested higher thoughts. Here are\r\ntwo instances taken from his notes of a Swiss tour in 1841:--\r\n\r\n\"_Monday, 19th._--Very fine day; walk with dear Sarah on the lake side\r\nto Oberhofen, through the beautiful vineyards; very busy were the\r\nwomen and men in trimming the vines, stripping off leaves and tendrils\r\nfrom the fruit-bearing branches. The churchyard was beautiful, and the\r\nsimplicity of the little remembrance-posts set upon the graves very\r\npleasant. One who had been too poor to put up an engraved brass plate,\r\nor even a painted board, had written with ink on paper the birth and\r\ndeath of the being whose remains were below, and this had been fastened\r\nto a board, and mounted on the top of a stick at the head of the\r\ngrave, the paper being protected by a little edge and roof. Such was\r\nthe simple remembrance, but Nature had added her pathos, for under the\r\nshelter by the writing a caterpillar had fastened itself, and passed\r\ninto its deathlike state of chrysalis, and, having ultimately assumed\r\nits final state, it had winged its way from the spot, and had left the\r\ncorpse-like relics behind. How old and how beautiful is this figure of\r\nthe resurrection! Surely it can never appear before our eyes without\r\ntouching the thoughts.\"\r\n\r\n\"_August 12th, Brienz Lake._--George and I crossed the lake in a boat\r\nto the Giessbach--he to draw, and I to saunter.... This most beautiful\r\nfall consists of a fine river, which passes by successive steps down\r\na very deep precipice into the lake. In some of these steps there is\r\na clear leap of water of 100 feet or more, in others most beautiful\r\ncombinations of leap, cataract, and rapid, the finest rocks occurring\r\nat the sides and bed of the torrent. In one part a bridge passes\r\nover it. In another a cavern and a path occur under it. To-day every\r\nfall was foaming from the abundance of water, and the current of\r\nwind brought down by it was in some parts almost too strong to stand\r\nagainst. The sun shone brightly, and the rainbows seen from various\r\npoints were very beautiful. One at the bottom of a fine but furious\r\nfall was very pleasant. There it remained motionless, whilst the gusts\r\nand clouds of spray swept furiously across its place, and were dashed\r\nagainst the rock. It looked like a spirit strong in faith and stedfast\r\nin the midst of the storm of passions sweeping across it; and though\r\nit might fade and revive, still it held on to the rock as in hope and\r\ngiving hope; and the very drops which in the whirlwind of their fury\r\nseemed as if they would carry all away, were made to revive it and give\r\nit greater beauty.\r\n\r\n\"How often are the things we fear and esteem as troubles made to become\r\nblessings to those who are led to receive them with humility and\r\npatience.\"\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn concluding this section it may be well to string together a few gems\r\nfrom Faraday's lectures or correspondence, though they are greatly\r\ndamaged by being torn away from their original setting:--\r\n\r\n\"After all, though your science is much to me, we are not friends\r\nfor science sake only, but for something better in a man, something\r\nmore important in his nature, affection, kindness, good feeling, moral\r\nworth; and so, in remembrance of these, I now write to place myself\r\nin your presence, and in thought shake hands, tongues, and hearts\r\ntogether.\" This was addressed to Schönbein.\r\n\r\n\"I should be glad to think that high mental powers insured something\r\nlike a high moral sense, but have often been grieved to see the\r\ncontrary: as also, on the other hand, my spirit has been cheered by\r\nobserving in some lowly and uninstructed creature such a healthful and\r\nhonourable and dignified mind as made one in love with human nature.\r\nWhen that which is good mentally and morally meet in one being, that\r\nthat being is more fitted to work out and manifest the glory of God in\r\nthe creation, I fully admit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me, as an old man who ought by this time to have profited by\r\nexperience, say that when I was younger I found I often misinterpreted\r\nthe intentions of people, and found they did not mean what at the time\r\nI supposed they meant; and further, that as a general rule, it was\r\nbetter to be a little dull of apprehension when phrases seemed to imply\r\npique, and quick in perception when, on the contrary, they seemed to\r\nimply kindly feeling. The real truth never fails ultimately to appear;\r\nand opposing parties, if wrong, are sooner convinced when replied to\r\nforbearingly, than when overwhelmed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Man is an improving animal. Unlike the animated world around him,\r\nwhich remains in the same constant state, he is continually varying;\r\nand it is one of the noblest prerogatives of his nature, that in\r\nthe highest of earthly distinctions he has the power of raising and\r\nexalting himself continually. The transitory state of man has been\r\nheld up to him as a memento of his weakness: to man _degraded_ it may\r\nbe so with justice; to man as he ought to be it is no reproach; and in\r\nknowledge, that man only is to be contemned and despised who is _not_\r\nin a state of transition.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not the duty or place of a philosopher to dictate belief, and\r\nall hypothesis is more or less matter of belief; he has but to give his\r\nfacts and his conclusions, and so much of the logic which connects the\r\nformer with the latter as he may think necessary, and then to commit\r\nthe whole to the scientific world for present, and, as he may sometimes\r\nwithout presumption believe, for future judgment.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] I myself once heard this advanced by an infidel lecturer on\r\nPaddington Green.\r\n\r\n[16] \"Electrical Researches,\" Series XV.\r\n\r\n[17] \"Analogies in the Progress of Nature and Grace,\" p. 121.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.\r\n\r\nHIS METHOD OF WORKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is on record that when a young aspirant asked Faraday the secret of\r\nhis success as a scientific investigator, he replied, \"The secret is\r\ncomprised in three words--Work, Finish, Publish.\"\r\n\r\nEach of these words, we may be sure, is full of meaning, and will guide\r\nus in a useful inquiry.\r\n\r\nAlready in the \"Story of his Life\" we have caught some glimpses of\r\nthe philosopher at work in his laboratory; but before looking at him\r\nmore closely let us learn from a foreigner with what feelings to enter\r\na place that is hallowed by so many memories sacred in the history\r\nof science. Professor Schönbein, of Basle, who visited England in\r\n1840, says: \"During my stay in London, I once worked with Faraday for\r\na whole day long in the laboratory of the Royal Institution, and I\r\ncannot forbear to say that this was one of the most enjoyable days\r\nthat I ever spent in the British capital. We commenced our day's work\r\nwith breakfast; and when that was over, I was supplied with one of the\r\nlaboratory dresses of my friend, which, when I was presented in it to\r\nthe ladies, gave occasion to no little amusement, as the dimensions of\r\nFaraday are different from those of my precious body.\r\n\r\n\"To work with a man like Faraday was in itself a great pleasure; but\r\nthis pleasure was not a little heightened in doing so in a place where\r\nsuch grand secrets of nature had been unfolded, the most brilliant\r\ndiscoveries of the century had been made, and entirely new branches of\r\nknowledge had been brought forth. For the empty intellect circumstances\r\nof this nature are indeed of little special value; but they stand in\r\nquite another relation to our power of imagination and inner nature.\r\n\r\n\"I do not deny that my surroundings produced in me a very peculiar\r\nfeeling; and whilst I trod the floor upon which Davy had once\r\nwalked--whilst I availed myself of some instrument which this great\r\ndiscoverer had himself handled--whilst I stood working at the very\r\ntable at which the ever-memorable man sought to solve the most\r\ndifficult problems of science, at which Faraday enticed the first\r\nsparks out of the magnet, and discovered the most beautiful laws of\r\nthe chemical action of current electricity, I felt myself inwardly\r\nelevated, and believed that I myself experienced something of the\r\ninbreathing of the scientific spirit which formerly ruled there with\r\nsuch creative power, and which still works on.\"[18]\r\n\r\nThe habit of Faraday was to think out carefully beforehand the subject\r\non which he was working, and to plan his mode of attack. Then, if he\r\nsaw that some new piece of apparatus was needed, he would describe it\r\nfully to the instrument maker with a drawing, and it rarely happened\r\nthat there was any need of alteration in executing the order. If,\r\nhowever, the means of experiment existed already, he would give\r\nAnderson a written list of the things he would require, at least a day\r\nbefore--for Anderson was not to be hurried. When all was ready, he\r\nwould descend into the laboratory, give a quick glance round to see\r\nthat all was right, take his apron from the drawer, and rub his hands\r\ntogether as he looked at the preparations made for his work. There must\r\nbe no tool on the table but such as he required. As he began, his face\r\nwould be exceedingly grave, and during the progress of an experiment\r\nall must be perfectly quiet; but if it was proceeding according to his\r\nwish, he would commence to hum a tune, and sometimes to rock himself\r\nsideways, balancing alternately on either foot. Then, too, he would\r\noften talk to his assistant about the result he was expecting. He would\r\nput away each tool in its own place as soon as done with, or at any\r\nrate when the day's work was over, and he would not unnecessarily take\r\na thing away from its place: thus, if he wanted a perforated cork,\r\nhe would go to the drawer which contained the corks and cork-borers,\r\nmake there what he wanted, replace the borers, and shut the drawer. No\r\nbottle was allowed to remain without its stopper; no open glass might\r\nstand for a night without a paper cover; no rubbish was to be left on\r\nthe floor; bad smells were to be avoided if possible; and machinery\r\nin motion was not permitted to grate. In working, also, he was very\r\ncareful not to employ more force than was wanted to produce the effect.\r\nWhen his experiments were finished and put away, he would leave the\r\nlaboratory, and think further about them upstairs.\r\n\r\nThis orderliness and this economy of means he not only practised\r\nhimself, but he expected them also to be followed by any who worked\r\nwith him; and it is from conversation with these that I have been\r\nenabled to give this sketch of his manner of working.[19]\r\n\r\nThis exactness was also apparent in the accounts he kept with the Royal\r\nInstitution and Trinity House, in which he entered every little item of\r\nexpenditure with the greatest minuteness of detail.\r\n\r\nIt was through this lifelong series of experiments that Faraday won his\r\nknowledge and mastered the forces of nature. The rare ingenuity of his\r\nmind was ably seconded by his manipulative skill, while the quickness\r\nof his perceptions was equalled by the calm rapidity of his movements.\r\n\r\nHe had indeed a passion for experimenting. This peeps out in the\r\npreface to the second edition of his \"Chemical Manipulation,\" where\r\nhe writes, \"Being intended especially as a book of instruction, no\r\nattempts were made to render it pleasing, otherwise than by rendering\r\nit effectual; for I concluded that, if the work taught clearly what\r\nit was intended to inculcate, the high interest always belonging to\r\na well-made or successful experiment would be abundantly sufficient\r\nto give it all the requisite charms, and more than enough to make it\r\nvaluable in the eyes of those for whom it was designed.\"\r\n\r\nHe could scarcely pass a gold leaf electrometer without causing the\r\nleaves to diverge by a sudden flick from his silk handkerchief. I\r\nrecollect, too, his meeting me at the entrance to the lecture theatre\r\nat Jermyn Street, when Lyon Playfair was to give the first, or one of\r\nthe first lectures ever delivered in the building. \"Let us go up here,\"\r\nsaid he, leading me far away from the central table. I asked him why he\r\nchose such an out-of-the-way place. \"Oh,\" he replied, \"we shall be able\r\nhere to find out what are the acoustic qualities of the room.\"\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of the means with which he made his experiments was\r\noften astonishing, and was indeed one of the manifestations of his\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nA good instance is thus narrated by Sir Frederick Arrow. \"When the\r\nelectric light was first exhibited permanently at Dungeness, on 6th\r\nJune, 1862, a committee of the Elder Brethren, of which I was one,\r\naccompanied Faraday to observe it. We dined, I think, at Dover, and\r\nembarked in the yacht from there, and were out for some hours watching\r\nit, to Faraday's great delight--(a very fine night)--and especially we\r\ndid so from the Varne lightship, about equidistant between it and the\r\nFrench light of Grisnez, using all our best glasses and photometers\r\nto ascertain the relative value of the lights: and this brings me to\r\nmy story. Before we left Dover, Faraday, with his usual bright smile,\r\nin great glee showed me a little common paper box, and said, 'I must\r\ntake care of this; it's my special photometer,'--and then, opening\r\nit, produced a lady's ordinary black shawl-pin,--jet, or imitation\r\nperhaps,--and then holding it a little way off the candle, showed me\r\nthe image very distinct; and then, putting it a little further off,\r\nplaced another candle near it, and the relative distance was shown by\r\nthe size of the image. He lent me this afterwards when we were at the\r\nVarne lightship, and it acted admirably; and ever since I have used\r\none as a very convenient mode of observing, and I never do so but I\r\nthink of that night and dear good Faraday, and his genial happy way of\r\nshowing how even common things may be made useful.\" After this Faraday\r\nmodified his glass-bead photometer, and he might be seen comparing the\r\nrelative intensity of two lights by watching their luminous images\r\non a bead of black glass, which he had threaded on a string, and was\r\ntwirling round so as to resolve the brilliant points into circles of\r\nfainter light; or he fixed the black glass balls on pieces of cork,\r\nand, attaching them to a little wheel, set them spinning for the same\r\npurpose. Some of these beads are preserved by the Trinity House, with\r\nother treasures of a like kind, including a flat piece of solder of an\r\nirregular oval form, turned up at one side so as to form a thumb-rest,\r\nand which served the philosopher as a candlestick to support the\r\nwax-light that he used as a standard. The museum of the Royal\r\nInstitution contains a most instructive collection of his experimental\r\napparatus, including the common electrical machine which he made while\r\nstill an apprentice at Riebau's, and the ring of soft iron, with its\r\ntwisted coils of wire isolated by calico and tied with common string,\r\nby means of which he first obtained electrical effects from a magnet.\r\n\r\nIn lecturing to the young he delighted to show how easily apparatus\r\nmight be extemporized. Thus, in order to construct an electrical\r\nmachine he once inverted a four-legged stool to serve for the stand,\r\nand took a white glass bottle for the cylinder. A cork was fitted into\r\nthe mouth of this bottle, and a bung was fastened with sealing-wax to\r\nthe other end: into the cork was inserted a handle for rotating the\r\nbottle, and in the centre of the bung was a wooden pivot on which it\r\nturned; while with some stout wire he made crutches on two of the legs\r\nof the stool for the axles of this glass cylinder to work upon. The\r\nsilk rubber he held in his hand. A japanned tin tea-canister resting on\r\na glass tumbler formed the conductor, and the collector was the head of\r\na toasting fork. With this apparently rough apparatus he exhibited all\r\nthe rudimentary experiments in electricity to a large audience.\r\n\r\nWishing to carry home in good condition a flower that had been given\r\nhim, he rolled a piece of writing-paper round a cork, tied it tightly\r\nwith string, and filled the little tube with water. He had thus a\r\nperfectly efficient bouquet-holder.\r\n\r\nA lady, calling on his wife, happened to mention that a needle had been\r\nonce broken into her foot, and she did not know whether it had been all\r\nextracted or not. \"Oh!\" said Faraday, \"I will soon tell you that,\"--and\r\ntaking a finely suspended magnetic needle, he held it close to her\r\nfoot, and it dipped to the concealed iron.\r\n\r\nOn this subject Schönbein has also some good remarks. \"The laboratory\r\nof the Institution is indeed efficiently arranged, though anything but\r\nlarge and elaborately furnished. And yet something extraordinary has\r\nhappened in this room for the extension of the limits of knowledge; and\r\nalready more has been done in it than in many other institutions where\r\nthe greatest luxury in the supply of apparatus prevails, and where\r\nthere is the greatest command of money. But when men work with the\r\ncreative genius of a Davy, and the intuitive spirit of investigation\r\nand the wealth of ideas of a Faraday, important and great things must\r\ncome to pass, even though the appliances at command should be of so\r\nlimited a character. For the experimental investigator of nature, it is\r\nespecially desirable that, according to the kind of his researches, he\r\nshould have at command such and such appliances, that he should possess\r\na 'philosophical apparatus,' a laboratory, &c.; but for the purpose\r\nof producing something important, of greatly widening the sphere of\r\nknowledge, it in no way follows that a superfluity of such things\r\nis necessary to him.... He who understands how to put appropriate\r\nquestions to Nature, generally knows how to extract the answers by\r\nsimple means; and he who wants this capacity will, I fear, obtain no\r\nprofitable result, even though all conceivable tools and apparatus may\r\nbe ready to his hand.\"\r\n\r\nNor did Faraday require elaborate apparatus to illustrate his meaning.\r\nSteaming up the Thames one July day in a penny boat, he was struck with\r\nthe offensiveness of the water. He tore some white cards into pieces,\r\nwetted them so as to make them sink easily, and dropped them into\r\nthe river at each pier they came to. Their sudden disappearance from\r\nsight, though the sun was shining brightly, was proof enough of the\r\nimpurity of the stream; and he wrote a letter to the _Times_ describing\r\nhis observations, and calling public attention to the dangerous state\r\nof the river.[20] At a meeting of the British Association he wished\r\nto explain the manner in which certain crystallized bodies place\r\nthemselves between the poles of an electro-magnet: two or three raw\r\npotatoes furnished the material out of which he cut admirable models of\r\nthe crystals. Wishing to show the electrical nature of gun-cotton, he\r\nhas been known to lay his watch upon the table, balance on it a slender\r\npiece of wood, and, charging a morsel of the gun-cotton by drawing it\r\nalong his coat sleeve, cause the wood to revolve towards the electric\r\nfibres.\r\n\r\n\"An artist was once maintaining that in natural appearances and in\r\npictures, up and down, and high and low, were fixed indubitable\r\nrealities; but Faraday told him that they were merely conventional\r\nacceptations, based on standards often arbitrary. The disputant could\r\nnot be convinced that ideas which he had hitherto never doubted had\r\nsuch shifting foundations. 'Well,' said Faraday, 'hold a walking-stick\r\nbetween your chin and your great toe; look along it and say which is\r\nthe upper end.' The experiment was tried, and the artist found his idea\r\nof perspective at complete variance with his sense of reality; either\r\nend of the stick might be called 'upper,'--pictorially it was one,\r\nphysically it was the other.\"\r\n\r\nFaraday's manner of experimenting may be further illustrated by the\r\nrecollections of other friends who have had the opportunity of watching\r\nhim at work.\r\n\r\nMr. James Young, who was in the laboratory of University College in\r\n1838, thus writes:--\"About that time Professor Graham had got from\r\nParis Thilorier's apparatus for producing liquid and solid carbonic\r\nacid; hearing of this, Mr. Faraday came to Graham's laboratory, and,\r\nas one might expect, showed great interest in this apparatus, and\r\nasked Graham for the loan of it for a Friday evening lecture at the\r\nRoyal Institution, which of course Graham readily granted, and Faraday\r\nasked me to come down to the Institution and give him the benefit of\r\nmy experience in charging and working the apparatus; so I spent a long\r\nevening at the Royal Institution laboratory. There was no one present\r\nbut Faraday, Anderson, and myself. The principal thing we did was to\r\ncharge the apparatus and work with the solid carbonic acid, Mr. Faraday\r\nworking with great activity; his motions were wonderfully rapid; and\r\nif he had to cross the laboratory for anything, he did not walk at an\r\nordinary step, but ran for it, and when he wanted anything he spoke\r\nquickly. Faraday had a theory at that time that all metals would become\r\nmagnetic if their temperature were low enough; and he tried that\r\nevening some experiments with cobalt and manganese, which he cooled in\r\na mixture of carbonic acid and ether, but the results were negative.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the deep mines of the Durham coal-field is one called the\r\nHaswell Colliery. One Saturday afternoon, while the men were at work\r\nin it as usual, a terrible explosion occurred: it proceeded from the\r\nfire-damp that collects in the vaulted space that is formed in old\r\nworkings, when the supporting pillars of coal are removed and the roof\r\nfalls in: the suffocating gases rushed along the narrow passages,\r\nand overwhelmed ninety-five poor fellows with destruction. Of course\r\nthere was an inquiry, and the Government sent down to the spot as\r\ntheir commissioners Professor Faraday and Sir Charles Lyell. The two\r\ngentlemen attended at the coroner's inquest, where they took part\r\nin the examination of the witnesses; they inspected the shattered\r\nsafety-lamps; they descended into the mine, spending the best part\r\nof a day in the damaged and therefore dangerous galleries where the\r\ncatastrophe had occurred, and they did not leave without showing in a\r\npractical form their sympathy with the sufferers. When down in the pit,\r\nan inspector showed them the way in which the workmen estimated the\r\nrapidity of the ventilation draught, by throwing a pinch of gunpowder\r\nthrough the flame of a candle, and timing the movement of the little\r\npuff of smoke. Faraday, not admiring the free and easy way in which\r\nthey handled their powder, asked where they kept their store of it,\r\nand learnt that it was in a large black bag which had been assigned to\r\nhim as the most comfortable seat they could offer. We may imagine the\r\nliveliness with which he sprang to his feet, and expostulated with them\r\non their culpable carelessness.\r\n\r\nMy own opportunities of observing Faraday at work were nearly confined\r\nto a series of experiments, which are the better worth describing here\r\nas they have escaped the notice of previous biographers. The Royal\r\nCommission appointed to inquire into our whole system of Lights, Buoys,\r\nand Beacons, perceived a great defect that rendered many of our finest\r\nshore or harbour lights comparatively ineffective. The great central\r\nlamp in a lighthouse is surrounded by a complicated arrangement of\r\nlenses and prisms, with the object of gathering up as many of the rays\r\nas possible and sending them over the surface of the sea towards the\r\nhorizon. Now, it is evident that if this apparatus be adjusted so as\r\nto send the beam two or three degrees upwards, the light will be lost\r\nto the shipping and wasted on the clouds; and if two or three degrees\r\ndownwards, it will only illuminate the water in the neighbourhood: in\r\neither case the beautiful and expensive apparatus would be worse than\r\nuseless. It is evident also that if the eye be placed just above the\r\nwick of the lamp, it will see through any particular piece of glass\r\nthat very portion of the landscape which will be illuminated by a ray\r\nstarting from the same spot; or the photographic image formed in the\r\nplace of the flame by any one of the lenses will tell us the direction\r\nin which that lens will throw the luminous rays. This simple principle\r\nwas applied by the Commissioners for testing the adjustment of the\r\napparatus in the different lights, and it was found that few were\r\nrightly placed, or rather that no method of adjustment was in use\r\nbetter than the mason's plumbline. The Royal Commissioners therefore\r\nin 1860 drew the attention of all the lighthouse authorities to this\r\nfact, and asked the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House, with Faraday\r\nand other parties, to meet them at the lights recently erected at\r\nthe North Foreland and Whitby. I, as the scientific member of the\r\nCommission, had drawn out in detail the course of rays from different\r\nparts of the flame, through different parts of the apparatus, and\r\nI was struck with the readiness with which Faraday, who had never\r\nbefore considered the matter,[21] took up the idea, and recognized\r\nits importance and its practical application. With his characteristic\r\ningenuity, too, he devised a little piece of apparatus for the more\r\nexact observation of the matter inside the lighthouse. He took to Mr.\r\nLadd, the optical instrument maker, a drawing, very neatly executed,\r\nwith written directions, and a cork cut into proper shape with two\r\nlucifer matches stuck through it, to serve as a further explanation of\r\nhis meaning: and from this the \"focimeter,\" as he called it, was made.\r\nThe position of the glass panels at Whitby was corrected by means of\r\nthis little instrument, and there were many journeys down to Chance's\r\nglassworks near Birmingham, where, declining the hospitality of the\r\nproprietor in order to be absolutely independent, he put up at a small\r\nhotel while he made his experiments, and jotted down his observations\r\non the cards he habitually carried in his pocket. At length we were\r\ninvited down to see the result. Faraday explained carefully all that\r\nhad been done, and at the risk of sea-sickness (no trifling matter in\r\nhis case) accompanied us out to sea to observe the effect from various\r\ndirections and at various distances. The experience acquired at Whitby\r\nwas applied elsewhere, and in May 1861 the Trinity House appointed a\r\nVisiting Committee, \"to examine all dioptric light establishments, with\r\nthe view of remedying any inaccuracies of arrangement that may be found\r\nto exist.\" Faraday had instructed and practised Captain Nisbet and some\r\nothers of the Elder Brethren in the use of the focimeter, and now wrote\r\na careful letter of suggestions on the question of adjustment between\r\nthe lamp and the lenses and prisms; so thoughtfully did he work for the\r\nbenefit of those who \"go down to the sea in ships, that do business in\r\ngreat waters.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the mental process that devised, directed, and interpreted\r\nhis experiments, it must be borne in mind that Faraday was no\r\nmathematician; his power of appreciating an _à priori_ reason often\r\nappeared comparatively weak. \"It has been stated on good authority\r\nthat Faraday boasted on a certain occasion of having only once in the\r\ncourse of his life performed a mathematical calculation: that once\r\nwas when he turned the handle of Babbage's calculating machine.\"[22]\r\nThough there was more pleasantry than truth in this professed innocence\r\nof numbers, probably no one acquainted with his electrical researches\r\nwill doubt that, had he possessed more mathematical ability, he would\r\nhave been saved much trouble, and would sometimes have expressed his\r\nconclusions with greater ease and precision. Yet, as Sir William\r\nThomson has remarked with reference to certain magnetic phenomena,\r\n\"Faraday, without mathematics, divined the result of the mathematical\r\ninvestigation; and, what has proved of infinite value to the\r\nmathematicians themselves, he has given them an articulate language\r\nin which to express their results. Indeed, the whole language of the\r\nmagnetic field and 'lines of force' is Faraday's. It must be said for\r\nthe mathematicians that they greedily accepted it, and have ever since\r\nbeen most zealous in using it to the best advantage.\"\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of his mind was indeed well known to himself. In a\r\nletter to Dr. Becker he says: \"I was never able to make a fact my own\r\nwithout seeing it; and the descriptions of the best works altogether\r\nfailed to convey to my mind such a knowledge of things as to allow\r\nmyself to form a judgment upon them. It was so with _new_ things. If\r\nGrove, or Wheatstone, or Gassiot, or any other told me a new fact, and\r\nwanted my opinion either of its value, or the cause, or the evidence it\r\ncould give on any subject, I never could say anything until I had seen\r\nthe fact. For the same reason I never could work, as some Professors do\r\nmost extensively, by students or pupils. All the work had to be my own.\"\r\n\r\nThus we are told what took place \"when Dr. Tyndall brought Mr. Faraday\r\ninto the laboratory to look at his new discovery of calorescence. As\r\nFaraday saw for the first time a piece of cold, black platinum raised\r\nto a dazzling brightness when held in the focus of dark rays, a point\r\nundistinguishable from the air around, he looked on attentively,\r\nputting on his spectacles to observe more carefully, then ascertained\r\nthe conditions of the experiment, and repeated it for himself; and now\r\nquite satisfied, he turned with emotion to Dr. Tyndall, and almost\r\nhugged him with pleasure.\"[23]\r\n\r\nThe following story by Mr. Robert Mallet also serves as an\r\nillustration:--\"It must be now eighteen years ago when I paid him a\r\nvisit and brought some slips of flexible and _tough_ Muntz's yellow\r\nmetal, to show him the instantaneous change to complete brittleness\r\nwith rigidity produced by dipping into pernitrate of mercury solution.\r\nHe got the solution, and I _showed_ him the facts; he obviously did\r\nnot doubt what he saw _me_ do before and close to him: but a sort of\r\nexperimental instinct seemed to require he should try it himself. So\r\nhe took one of the slips, bent it forwards and backwards, dipped it,\r\nand broke it up into short bits between his own fingers. He had not\r\nbefore spoken. _Then_ he said, 'Yes, it _is_ pliable, and it _does_\r\nbecome instantly brittle.' And after a few moments' pause he added,\r\n'Well, now have you any more facts of the sort?' and seemed a little\r\ndisappointed when I said, 'No; none that are new.' It has often since\r\noccurred to me how his mind needed absolute satisfaction that he had\r\ngrasped a _fact_, and then instantly rushed to colligate it with\r\nanother if possible.\"\r\n\r\nBut as the Professor watched these new facts, new thoughts would shape\r\nthemselves in his mind, and this would lead to fresh experiments in\r\norder to test their truth. The answers so obtained would lead to\r\nfurther questions. Thus his work often consisted in the defeat of one\r\nhypothesis after another, till the true conditions of the phenomena\r\ncame forth and claimed the assent of the experimenter and ultimately of\r\nthe scientific world.\r\n\r\nA. de la Rive has some acute observations on this subject. He explains\r\nhow Faraday did not place himself before his apparatus, setting it\r\nto work, without a preconceived idea. Neither did he take up known\r\nphenomena, as some scientific men do, and determine their numerical\r\ndata, or study with great precision the laws which regulate them.\r\n\"A third method, very different from the preceding, is that which,\r\nquitting the beaten track, leads, as if by inspiration, to those great\r\ndiscoveries which open new horizons to science. This method, in order\r\nto be fertile, requires one condition--a condition, it is true, which\r\nis but rarely met with--namely, genius. Now, this condition existed in\r\nFaraday. Endowed, as he himself perceived, with much imagination, he\r\ndared to advance where many others would have recoiled: his sagacity,\r\njoined to an exquisite scientific tact, by furnishing him with a\r\npresentiment of the possible, prevented him from wandering into the\r\nfantastic; while, always wishing only for facts, and accepting theories\r\nonly with difficulty, he was nevertheless more or less directed by\r\npreconceived ideas, which, whether true or false, led him into new\r\nroads, where most frequently he found what he sought, and sometimes\r\nalso what he did not seek, but where he constantly met with some\r\nimportant discovery.\r\n\r\n\"Such a method, if indeed it can be called one, although barren and\r\neven dangerous with mediocre minds, produced great things in Faraday's\r\nhands; thanks, as we have said, to his genius, but thanks also to that\r\nlove of truth which characterized him, and which preserved him from the\r\ntemptation so often experienced by every discoverer, of seeing what he\r\nwishes to see, and not seeing what he dreads.\"\r\n\r\nThis love of truth deserves a moment's pause. It was one of the most\r\nbeautiful and most essential of his characteristics; it taught him\r\nto be extremely cautious in receiving the statements of others or in\r\ndrawing his own conclusions,[24] and it led him, if his scepticism was\r\novercome, to adopt at once the new view, and to maintain it, if need\r\nbe, against the world.\r\n\r\n\"The thing I am proudest of, Pearsall, is that I have never been found\r\nto be wrong,\" he could say in the early part of his scientific history\r\nwithout fear of contradiction. After his death A. de la Rive wrote, \"I\r\ndo not think that Faraday has once been caught in a mistake; so precise\r\nand conscientious was his mode of experimenting and observing.\"\r\nThis is not absolutely true; but the extreme rarity of his mistakes,\r\nnotwithstanding the immense amount of his published researches, is one\r\nof those marvels which can be appreciated only by those who are in the\r\nhabit of describing what they have seen in the mist land that lies\r\nbeyond the boundaries of previous knowledge.\r\n\r\nInto this unknown region his mental vision was ever stretched. \"I\r\nwell remember one day,\" writes Mr. Barrett, a former assistant at the\r\nRoyal Institution, \"when Mr. Faraday was by my side, I happened to\r\nbe steadying, by means of a magnet, the motion of a magnetic needle\r\nunder a glass shade. Mr. Faraday suddenly looked most impressively and\r\nearnestly as he said, 'How wonderful and mysterious is that power you\r\nhave there! the more I think over it the less I seem to know:'--and yet\r\nhe who said this knew more of it than any living man.\"\r\n\r\nIt is easy to imagine with what wonder he would stand before the apples\r\nor leaves or pieces of meat that swung round into a transverse position\r\nbetween the poles of his gigantic magnet, or the sand that danced\r\nand eddied into regular figures on plates of glass touched by the\r\nfiddle-bow, or gold so finely divided that it appeared purple and when\r\ndiffused in water took a twelvemonth to settle. It is easy, too, to\r\nimagine how he would long to gain a clear idea of what was taking place\r\nbehind the phenomena. But it is far from easy to grasp the conceptions\r\nof his brain: language is a clumsy vehicle for such thoughts. He\r\nstrove to get rid of such figurative terms as \"currents\" and \"poles;\"\r\nin discussing the mode of propagation of light and radiant heat he\r\nendeavoured \"to dismiss the ether, but not the vibrations;\" and in\r\nconceiving of atoms, he says: \"As to the little solid particles ... I\r\ncannot form any idea of them apart from the forces, so I neither admit\r\nnor deny them. They do not afford me the least help in my endeavour to\r\nform an idea of a particle of matter. On the contrary, they greatly\r\nembarrass me.\" Yet he could not himself escape from the tyranny of\r\nwords or the deceitfulness of metaphors, and it is hard for his readers\r\nto comprehend what was his precise idea of those centres of forces that\r\noccupy no space, or of those lines of force which he beheld with his\r\nmental eye, curving alike round his magnetic needle, and that mightiest\r\nof all magnets--the earth.\r\n\r\nAs he was jealous of his own fame, and had learnt by experience that\r\ndiscoveries could be stolen, he talked little about them till they\r\nwere ready for the public; indeed, he has been known to twit a brother\r\nelectrician for telling his discoveries before printing them, adding\r\nwith a knowing laugh, \"I never do that.\" He was obliged, however,\r\nto explain his results to Professor Whewell, or some other learned\r\nfriend, if he wished to christen some new idea with a Greek name.\r\nOne of Whewell's letters on such an occasion, dated Trinity College,\r\nCambridge, October 14, 1837, begins thus:--\r\n\r\n \"MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n \"I am always glad to hear of the progress of your researches, and\r\n never the less so because they require the fabrication of a new word\r\n or two. Such a coinage has always taken place at the great epochs of\r\n discovery; like the medals that are struck at the beginning of a new\r\n reign, or rather like the change of currency produced by the accession\r\n of a new Sovereign; for their value and influence consists in their\r\n coming into common circulation.\"\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the whole time of an investigation Faraday had kept ample notes,\r\nand when all was completed he had little to do but to copy these notes,\r\ncondensing or re-arranging some parts, and omitting what was useless.\r\nThe paper then usually consisted of a series of numbered paragraphs,\r\ncontaining first a statement of the subject of inquiry, then a series\r\nof experiments giving negative results, and afterwards the positive\r\ndiscoveries. In this form it was sent to the Royal Society or some\r\nother learned body. Yet this often involved considerable labour, as the\r\nfollowing words written to Miss Moore in 1850 from a summer retreat in\r\nUpper Norwood will show:--\"I write and write and write, until nearly\r\nthree papers for the Royal Society are nearly completed, and I hope\r\nthat two of them will be good if they do justify my hopes, for I have\r\nto criticise them again and again before I let them loose. You shall\r\nhear of them at some of the next Friday evenings.\"\r\n\r\nThis criticism did not cease with their publication, for he endeavoured\r\nalways to improve on his previous work. Thus, in 1832 he bound his\r\npapers together in one volume, and the introduction on the fly-leaf\r\nshows the object with which it was done:--\r\n\r\n \"Papers of mine, published in octavo, in the _Quarterly Journal of\r\n Science_, and elsewhere, since the time that Sir H. Davy encouraged me\r\n to write the analysis of caustic lime.\r\n\r\n \"Some, I think (at this date), are good, others moderate, and some\r\n bad. But I have put _all_ into the volume, because of the utility they\r\n have been of to me--and none more than the bad--in pointing out to me\r\n in future, or rather after times, the faults it became me to watch and\r\n to avoid.\r\n\r\n \"As I never looked over one of my papers a year after it was written,\r\n without believing, both in philosophy and manner, it could have been\r\n much better done, I still hope the collection may be of great use to\r\n me.\r\n\r\n                                                      \"M.

His hand in the execution of his conceptions kept pace with\r\nhis mind in designing them; he never wanted boldness when he undertook\r\nan experiment, never lacked resources to ensure success, and was full\r\nof discretion in interpreting results. His hardihood, which never\r\nhalted when once he had undertaken a task, and his wariness, which felt\r\nits way carefully in adopting a received conclusion, will ever serve as\r\nmodels for the experimentalist.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] \"Mittheilungen aus dem Reisetagebuche eines deutschen\r\nNaturforschers,\" p. 275.\r\n\r\n[19] Since the publication of the first edition I have been struck\r\nwith how precisely his practice corresponded with his precept in\r\nthe introduction to his book on \"Chemical Manipulation:\"--\"When an\r\nexperiment has been devised, its general nature and principles arranged\r\nin the mind, and the causes to be brought into action, with the effect\r\nto be expected, properly considered, then it has to be performed. The\r\nultimate objects of an experiment, and also the particular contrivance\r\nor mode by which the results are to be produced, being mental, there\r\nremains the mere performance of it, which may properly enough be\r\nexpressed by the term _manipulation_.\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding this subordinate character of manipulation, it is\r\nyet of high importance in an experimental science, and particularly\r\nin chemistry. The person who could devise only, without knowing how\r\nto perform, would not be able to extend his knowledge far, or make it\r\nuseful; and where every doubt or question that arises in the mind is\r\nbest answered by the result of an experiment, whatever enables the\r\nphilosopher to perform the experiment in the simplest, quickest, and\r\nmost direct manner, cannot but be esteemed by him as of the utmost\r\nvalue.\"\r\n\r\n[20] _Punch's_ cartoon next week represented Professor Faraday holding\r\nhis nose, and presenting his card to Father Thames, who rises out of\r\nthe unsavoury ooze.\r\n\r\n[21] Since writing the above I have come across a letter written by\r\nFaraday in answer to one by Captain Welier as far back as 13th Sept.\r\n1839, in which he pointed out the mal-adjustment of the dioptric\r\napparatus at Orfordness. In July of the following year he made lengthy\r\nsuggestions to the Trinity House, in which he proposed using a flat\r\nwhite circle or square, half an inch across, on a piece of black paper\r\nor card, as a \"focal object.\" This was to be looked at from outside, in\r\norder to test the regularity of the glass apparatus. He also suggested\r\nobservations on the divergence by looking at this white circle at a\r\ndistance of twenty feet at most. Another plan he proposed was that of\r\nlighting the lamp and putting up a white screen outside. These methods\r\nof examining he carried out very shortly afterwards at Blackwall, on\r\nFrench and English refractors, but it seems never to have occurred to\r\nhim to place his eye in the focus, or in any other manner to observe\r\nthe course of the rays from inside the apparatus.\r\n\r\n[22] Dr. Scoffern, _Belgravia_, October 1867.\r\n\r\n[23] Mr. Barrett, _Nature_, Sept. 19, 1872.\r\n\r\n[24] A good instance of his caution in drawing conclusions is contained\r\nin one of his letters to me:--\r\n\r\n                                  \"ROYAL INSTITUTION OF GREAT BRITAIN,\r\n\r\n                                            \"_2 July, 1859_.\r\n\r\n \"MY DEAR GLADSTONE,\r\n\r\n \"Although I have frequently observed lights from the sea, the only\r\n thing I have learnt in relation to their _relative brilliancy_ is that\r\n the average of a very great number of observations would be required\r\n for the attainment of a moderate approximation to truth. One has to\r\n be some miles off at sea, or else the observation is not made in the\r\n chief ray, and then one does not know the state of the atmosphere\r\n about a given lighthouse. Strong lights like that of Cape Grisnez have\r\n been invisible when they should have been strong; feeble lights by\r\n comparison have risen up in force when one might have expected them to\r\n be relatively weak; and after inquiry has not shown a state of the air\r\n at the lighthouse explaining such differences. It is probable that the\r\n cause of difference often exists at sea.\r\n\r\n \"Besides these difficulties there is that other great one of not\r\n seeing the two lights to be compared in the field of view at the same\r\n time and same distance. If the eye has to turn 90° from one to the\r\n other, I have no confidence in the comparison; and if both be in the\r\n field of sight at once, still unexpected and unexplained causes of\r\n difference occur. The two lights at the South Foreland are beautifully\r\n situated for comparison, and yet sometimes the upper did not equal the\r\n lower when it ought to have surpassed it. This I referred at the time\r\n to an upper stratum of haze; but on shore they knew nothing of the\r\n kind, nor had any such or other reason to expect particular effects.\r\n\r\n                                       \"Ever truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                                 \"M. FARADAY.\"\r\n\r\nAs an instance of his unwillingness to commit himself to an opinion\r\nunless he was sure about it, may be cited a letter he wrote to Sir\r\nG. B. Airy, the Astronomer Royal, who asked for his advice in regard\r\nto the material of which the national standard of length should be\r\nmade:--\"I do not see any reason why a pure metal should be particularly\r\nfree from internal change of its particles, and on the whole should\r\nrather incline to the hard alloy than to soft copper, and yet I hardly\r\nknow why. I suppose the labour would be too great to lay down the\r\nstandard on different metals and substances; and yet the comparison of\r\nthem might be very important hereafter, for twenty years seem to _do_\r\nor _tell_ a great deal in relation to standard measures.\" Bronze was\r\nfinally chosen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.\r\n\r\nTHE VALUE OF HIS DISCOVERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nScience is pursued by different men from different motives.\r\n\r\n                 \"To some she is the goddess great;\r\n                    To some the milch-cow of the field;\r\n                  Their business is to calculate\r\n                    The butter she will yield.\"\r\n\r\nNow, Faraday had been warned by Davy before he entered his service that\r\nScience was a mistress who paid badly; and in 1833 we have seen him\r\ndeliberately make his calculation, give up the butter, and worship the\r\ngoddess.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason also he declined most of the positions of honour\r\nwhich he was invited to fill, believing that they would encroach too\r\nmuch on his time, though he willingly accepted the honorary degrees and\r\nscientific distinctions that were showered upon him.[25]\r\n\r\nAnd among those who follow Science lovingly, there are two very\r\ndistinct bands: there are the philosophers, the discoverers, men who\r\npersistently ask questions of Nature; and there are the practical men,\r\nwho apply her answers to the various purposes of human life. Many\r\nnoble names are inscribed in either bead-roll, but few are able to\r\ntake rank in both services: indeed, the question of practical utility\r\nwould terribly cramp the investigator, while the enjoyment of patient\r\nresearch in unexplored regions of knowledge is usually too ethereal\r\nfor those who seek their pleasures in useful inventions. The mental\r\nconfiguration is different in the two cases; each may claim and receive\r\nhis due award of honour.\r\n\r\nFaraday was pre-eminently a discoverer; he liked the name of\r\n\"philosopher.\" His favourite paths of study seem to wander far enough\r\nfrom the common abodes of human thought or the requirements of ordinary\r\nlife. He became familiar, as no other man ever was, with the varied\r\nforces of magnetism and electricity, heat and light, gravitation and\r\ngalvanism, chemical affinity and mechanical motion; but he did not seek\r\nto \"harness the lightnings,\" or to chain those giants and to make them\r\ngrind like Samson in the prison-house. His way of treating them reminds\r\nus rather of the old fable of Proteus, who would transform himself into\r\na whirlwind or a dragon, a flame of fire or a rushing stream, in order\r\nto elude his pursuer; but if the wary inquirer could catch him asleep\r\nin his cave, he might be constrained to utter all his secret knowledge:\r\nfor the favourite thought of Faraday seems to have been that these\r\nvarious forces were the changing forms of a Proteus, and his great\r\ndesire seems to have been to learn the secret of their origin and their\r\ntransformations. Thus he loved to break down the walls of separation\r\nbetween different classes of phenomena, and his eye doubtless sparkled\r\nwith delight when he saw what had always been looked upon as permanent\r\ngases liquefy like common vapours under the constraint of pressure\r\nand cold--when the wires that coiled round his magnets gave signs of\r\nan electric wave, or coruscated with sparks--when the electricities\r\nderived from the friction machine and from the voltaic pile yielded\r\nhim the same series of phenomena--when he recognized the cumulative\r\nproof that the quantity of electricity in a galvanic battery is exactly\r\nproportional to the chemical action--when his electro-static theory\r\nseemed to break down the barrier between the conductors and insulators,\r\nand many other barriers beside--when he sent a ray of polarized light\r\nthrough a piece of heavy glass between the poles of an electro-magnet,\r\nand on making contact saw that the plane of polarization was rotated,\r\nor, as he said, the light was magnetized--and when he watched pieces\r\nof bismuth, or crystals of Iceland spar, or bubbles of oxygen, ranging\r\nthemselves in a definite position in the magnetic field.\r\n\r\n\"I delight in hearing of exact numbers, and the determinations of the\r\nequivalents of force when different forms of force are compared one\r\nwith another,\" he wrote to Joule in 1845; and no wonder, for these\r\nquantitative comparisons have proved many of his speculations to be\r\ntrue, and have made them the creed of the scientific world. When he\r\nbegan to investigate the different sciences, they might be compared\r\nto so many different countries with impassable frontiers, different\r\nlanguages and laws, and various weights and measures; but when he\r\nceased they resembled rather a brotherhood of states, linked together\r\nby a community of interests and of speech, and a federal code; and in\r\nbringing about this unification no one had so great a share as himself.\r\n\r\nHe loved to speculate, too, on Matter and Force, on the nature of atoms\r\nand of imponderable agents. \"It is these things,\" says the great German\r\nphysicist Professor Helmholz, \"that Faraday, in his mature works, ever\r\nseeks to purify more and more from everything that is theoretical, and\r\nis not the direct and simple expression of the fact. For instance, he\r\ncontended against the action of forces at a distance, and the adoption\r\nof two electrical and two magnetic fluids, as well as all hypotheses\r\ncontrary to the law of the conservation of force, which he early\r\nforesaw, though he misunderstood it in its scientific expression. And\r\nit is just in this direction that he exercised the most unmistakeable\r\ninfluence first of all on the English physicists.\"[26]\r\n\r\nWhile, however, Faraday was pre-eminently an experimental philosopher,\r\nhe was far from being indifferent to the useful applications of\r\nscience. His own connection with the practical side of the question was\r\nthreefold: he undertook some laborious investigations of this nature\r\nhimself; he was frequently called upon, especially by the Trinity\r\nHouse, to give his opinions on the inventions of others; and he was\r\nfond of bringing useful inventions before the members of the Royal\r\nInstitution in his Friday evening discourses. The first of these,\r\non February 3, 1826, was on India-rubber, and was illustrated by an\r\nabundance of specimens both in the raw and manufactured states. He\r\ntraced the history of the substance, from the crude uncoagulated sap\r\nto the sheet rubber and waterproof fabrics which Mr. Hancock and Mr.\r\nMacintosh had recently succeeded in preparing. In this way also he\r\ncontinued to throw the magic of his genius around Morden's machinery\r\nfor manufacturing Bramah's locks, Ericsson's caloric engine, Brunel's\r\nblock machinery at Portsmouth, Petitjean's process for silvering\r\nmirrors, the prevention of dry-rot in timber, De la Rue's envelope\r\nmachinery, artificial rubies, Bonelli's electric silk loom, Barry's\r\nmode of ventilating the House of Lords, and many kindred subjects.\r\n\r\nIt may not be amiss to describe the last of his Friday evenings, in\r\nwhich he brought before the public Mr. C. W. Siemens' Regenerative\r\nGas Furnace. The following letter to the inventor will tell the first\r\nsteps:--\r\n\r\n                                 \"ROYAL INSTITUTION, _March 22, 1862_.\r\n\r\n \"MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n \"I have just returned from Birmingham--and there saw at Chance's works\r\n the application of your furnaces to glass-making. I was very much\r\n struck with the whole matter.\r\n\r\n \"As our managers want me to end the F. evenings here after Easter, I\r\n have looked about for a thought, for I have none in myself. I think I\r\n should like to speak of the effects I saw at Chance's, if you do not\r\n object. If you assent, can you help me with any drawings or models, or\r\n illustrations either in the way of thoughts or experiments? Do not say\r\n much about it out of doors as yet, for my mind is not settled in what\r\n way (if you assent) I shall present the subject.\r\n\r\n                                    \"Ever truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                                    \"M. FARADAY.\r\n\r\n \"C. W. SIEMENS, ESQ.\"\r\n\r\nOf course the permission was gladly given, and Mr. Siemens met him\r\nat Birmingham, and for two days conducted him about works for flint\r\nand crown glass, or for enamel, as well as about ironworks, in which\r\nhis principle was adopted, wondering at the Professor's simplicity of\r\ncharacter as well as at his ready power of grasping the whole idea.\r\nThen came the Friday evening, 20th June, 1862, in which he explained\r\nthe great saving of heat effected, and pictured the world of flame\r\ninto which he had gazed in some of those furnaces. But his powers of\r\nlecturing were enfeebled, and during the course of the hour he burnt\r\nhis notes by accident, and at the conclusion he very pathetically bade\r\nhis audience farewell, telling them that he felt he had been before\r\nthem too long, and that the experience of that evening showed he was\r\nnow useless as their public servant, but he would still endeavour to do\r\nwhat he could privately for the Institution. The usual abstract of the\r\nlecture appeared, but not from his unaided pen.\r\n\r\nInventors, and promoters of useful inventions, frequently benefited by\r\nthe advice of Faraday, or by his generous help. A remarkable instance\r\nof this was told me by Cyrus Field. Near the commencement of his great\r\nenterprise, when he wished to unite the old and the new worlds by the\r\ntelegraphic cable, he sought the advice of the great electrician, and\r\nFaraday told him that he doubted the possibility of getting a message\r\nacross the Atlantic. Mr. Field saw that this fatal objection must be\r\nsettled at once, and begged Faraday to make the necessary experiments,\r\noffering to pay him properly for his services. The philosopher,\r\nhowever, declined all remuneration, but worked away at the question,\r\nand presently reported to Mr. Field:--\"It can be done, but you will not\r\nget an instantaneous message.\" \"How long will it take?\" was the next\r\ninquiry. \"Oh, perhaps a second.\" \"Well, that's quick enough for me,\"\r\nwas the conclusion of the American; and the enterprise was proceeded\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nAs to the electric telegraph itself, Faraday does not appear among\r\nthose who claim its parentage, but he was constantly associated with\r\nthose who do; his criticisms led Ritchie to develop more fully his\r\nearly conception, and he was constantly engaged with batteries and\r\nwires and magnets, while the telegraph was being perfected by others,\r\nand especially by his friend Wheatstone, whose name will always be\r\nassociated with what is perhaps the most wonderful invention of modern\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nAs to Faraday's own work in applied science, his attempts to improve\r\nthe manufacture of steel, and afterwards of glass for optical purposes,\r\nwere among the least satisfactory of his researches. He was more\r\nsuccessful in the matter of ventilation of lamp-burners. The windows\r\nof lighthouses were frequently found streaming with water that arose\r\nfrom the combustion of the oil, and in winter this was often converted\r\ninto thick ice. He devised a plan by which this water was effectually\r\ncarried away, and the room was also made more healthy for the keepers.\r\nAt the Athenæum Club serious complaints were made that the brilliantly\r\nlighted drawing-room became excessively hot, and that headaches were\r\nvery common, while the bindings of the books were greatly injured by\r\nthe sulphuric acid that arose from the burnt coal-gas. Faraday cured\r\nthis by an arrangement of glass cylinders over the ordinary lamp\r\nchimneys, and descending tubes which carried off the whole products\r\nof combustion without their ever mixing with the air of the room.\r\nThis principle could of course be applied to brackets or chandeliers\r\nelsewhere, but the Professor made over any pecuniary benefit that might\r\naccrue from it to his brother, who was a lamp manufacturer, and had\r\naided him in the invention.\r\n\r\nThe achievements of Faraday are certainly not to be tested by a money\r\nstandard, nor by their immediate adaptation to the necessities or\r\nconveniences of life. \"Practical men\" might be disposed to think\r\nslightly of the grand discoveries of the philosopher. Their ideas of\r\n\"utility\" will probably be different. One man may take his wheat corn\r\nand convert it into loaves of bread, while his neighbour appears to\r\nlose his labour by throwing the precious grain into the earth: but\r\nwhich is after all most productive? The loaves will at once feed the\r\nhungry, but the sower's toil will be crowned in process of time by\r\nwaving harvests.\r\n\r\nYet some of Faraday's most recondite inquiries did bear practical fruit\r\neven during his own lifetime. In proof of this I will take one of his\r\nchemical and two of his electrical discoveries.\r\n\r\nLong ago there was a Portable Gas Company, which made oil-gas and\r\ncondensed it into a liquid. This liquid Faraday examined in 1824, and\r\nhe found the most important constituent of it to be a light volatile\r\noil, which he called bicarburet of hydrogen. The gas company, I\r\npresume, came to an end; but what of the volatile liquid? Obtained\r\nfrom coal-tar, and renamed Benzine or Benzol, it is now prepared on\r\na large scale, and used as a solvent in some of our industrial arts.\r\nBut other chemists have worked upon it, and torturing it with nitric\r\nacid, they have produced nitrobenzol--a gift to the confectioner and\r\nthe perfumer. And by attacking this with reducing agents there was\r\ncalled into existence the wondrous base aniline,--wondrous indeed when\r\nwe consider the transformations it underwent in the hands of Hofmann,\r\nand the light it was made to throw on the internal structure of organic\r\ncompounds. Faraday used sometimes to pay a visit to the Royal College\r\nof Chemistry, and revel in watching these marvellous reactions. But\r\naniline was of use to others besides the theoretical chemist. Tortured\r\nby fresh appliances, this base gave highly-coloured bodies which it was\r\nfound possible to fix on cotton as well as woollen and silken fabrics,\r\nand thence sprang up a large and novel branch of industry, while our\r\neyes were delighted with the rich hues of mauve and magenta, the Bleu\r\nde Paris, and various other \"aniline dyes.\"\r\n\r\nEveryone who is at all acquainted with the habits of electricity knows\r\nthat the most impassable of obstacles is the air, while iron bolts\r\nand bars only help it in its flight: yet, if an electrified body\r\nbe brought near another body, with this invisible barrier between\r\nthem, the electrical state of the second body is disturbed. Faraday\r\nthought much over this question of \"induction,\" as it is called,\r\nand found himself greatly puzzled to comprehend how a body should\r\nact where it is not. At length he satisfied himself by experiment\r\nthat the interposed obstacle is itself affected by the electricity,\r\nand acquires an electro-polar state by which it modifies electric\r\naction in its neighbourhood. The amount varies with the nature of the\r\nsubstance, and Faraday estimated it for such dielectrics as sulphur,\r\nshellac, or spermaceti, compared with air. He termed this new property\r\nof matter \"specific inductive capacity,\" and figured in his own mind\r\nthe play of the molecules as they propagated and for a while retained\r\nthe force. Now, these very recondite observations were opposed to\r\nthe philosophy of the day, and they were not received by some of the\r\nleading electricians, especially of the Continent, while those who\r\nfirst tried to extend his experiments blundered over the matter.\r\nHowever, the present Professor Sir William Thomson, then a student at\r\nCambridge, showed that while Faraday's views were rigorously deducible\r\nfrom Coulomb's theory, this discovery was a great advance in the\r\nphilosophy of the subject. When submarine telegraph wires had to be\r\nmanufactured, Thomson took \"specific inductive capacity\" into account\r\nin determining the dimensions of the cable: for we have there all the\r\nnecessary conditions--the copper wire is charged with electricity,\r\nthe covering of gutta-percha is a \"dielectric,\" and the water outside\r\nis ready to have an opposite electric condition induced in it. The\r\nresult is that, as Faraday himself predicted, the message is somewhat\r\nretarded; and of course it becomes a thing of importance so to arrange\r\nmatters that this retardation may be as small as possible, and the\r\nsignals may follow one another speedily. Now this must depend not\r\nonly on the thickness of the covering, but also on the nature of the\r\nsubstance employed, and it was likely enough that gutta-percha was not\r\nthe best possible substance. In fact, when Professor Fleeming Jenkin\r\ncame to try the inductive capacity of gutta-percha by means of the\r\nRed Sea cable, he found it to be almost double that of shellac, which\r\nwas the highest that Faraday had determined, and attempts have been\r\nmade since to obtain some substance which should have less of this\r\nobjectionable quality and be as well adapted otherwise for coating a\r\nwire. There is Hooper's material, the great merit of which is its low\r\nspecific inductive capacity, so that it permits of the sending of four\r\nsignals while gutta-percha will only allow three to pass along; and Mr.\r\nWilloughby Smith has made an improved kind of gutta-percha with reduced\r\ncapacity. Of course no opinion is expressed here on the value of these\r\ninventions, as many other circumstances must be taken into account,\r\nsuch as their durability and their power of insulation,--that is,\r\npreventing the leakage of the galvanic charge; but at least they show\r\nthat one of the most abstruse discoveries of Faraday has penetrated\r\nalready into our patent offices and manufactories. Two students in\r\nthe Physical Laboratory at Glasgow have lately determined with great\r\ncare the inductive capacity of paraffin, and there can be little doubt\r\nthat the speculations of the philosopher as to the condition of a\r\ndielectric will result in rendering it still more easy than at present\r\nto send words of information or of friendly greeting to our cousins\r\nacross the Atlantic or the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe history of the magneto-electric light affords another remarkable\r\ninstance of the way in which one of Faraday's most recondite\r\ndiscoveries bore fruit in his own lifetime; and it is the more\r\ninteresting as it fell to his own lot to assist in bringing the fruit\r\nto maturity.\r\n\r\n                                     \"BRIGHTON, _November 29, 1831_.\r\n\r\n \"DEAR PHILLIPS,\r\n\r\n \"For once in my life I am able to sit down and write to you without\r\n feeling that my time is so little that my letter must of necessity\r\n be a short one; and accordingly I have taken an extra large sheet of\r\n paper, intending to fill it with news.\r\n\r\n \"But how are you getting on? Are you comfortable? And how does Mrs.\r\n Phillips do; and the girls? Bad correspondent as I am, I think you owe\r\n me a letter; and as in the course of half an hour you will be doubly\r\n in my debt, pray write us, and let us know all about you. Mrs. Faraday\r\n wishes me not to forget to put her kind remembrances to you and Mrs.\r\n Phillips in my letter....\r\n\r\n \"We are here to refresh. I have been working and writing a paper that\r\n always knocks me up in health; but now I feel well again, and able to\r\n pursue my subject; and now I will tell you what it is about. The title\r\n will be, I think, 'Experimental Researches in Electricity:'--I. On the\r\n Induction of Electric Currents; II. On the Evolution of Electricity\r\n from Magnetism; III. On a new Electrical Condition of Matter; IV. On\r\n Arago's Magnetic Phenomena. There is a bill of fare for you; and,\r\n what is more, I hope it will not disappoint you. Now, the pith of all\r\n this I must give you very briefly; the demonstrations you shall have\r\n in the paper when printed....\"\r\n\r\nSo wrote Faraday to his intimate friend Richard Phillips, on November\r\n29th, 1831, and the letter goes on to describe the great harvest of\r\nresults which he had gathered since the 29th of August, when he first\r\nobtained evidence of an electric current from a magnet. A few days\r\nafterwards he was at work again on these curious relations of magnetism\r\nand electricity in his laboratory, and at the Round Pond in Kensington\r\nGardens, and with Father Thames at Waterloo Bridge. On the 8th of\r\nFebruary he entered in his note-book: \"This evening, at Woolwich,\r\nexperimented with magnet, and for the first time got the magnetic spark\r\nmyself. Connected ends of a helix into two general ends, and then\r\ncrossed the wires in such a way that a blow at _a b_ would open them\r\na little. Then bringing _a b_ against the poles of a magnet, the ends\r\nwere disjoined, and bright sparks resulted.\"\r\n\r\nNext day he repeated this experiment at home with Mr. Daniell's magnet,\r\nand then invited some of his best friends to come and see the tiny\r\nspeck of light.[27]\r\n\r\nBut what was the use of this little spark between the shaken wires?\r\n\"What is the use of an infant?\" asked Franklin once, when some such\r\nquestion was proposed to him. Faraday said that the experimentalist's\r\nanswer was, \"Endeavour to make it useful.\" But he passed to other\r\nresearches in the same field.\r\n\r\n\"I have rather been desirous,\" he says, \"of discovering new facts and\r\nnew relations dependent on magneto-electric induction, than of exalting\r\nthe force of those already obtained; being assured that the latter\r\nwould find their full development hereafter.\" And in this assurance\r\nhe was not mistaken. Electro-magnetism has been taken advantage of on\r\na large scale by the metallurgist and the telegrapher; and even the\r\nphotographer and sugar-refiner have attempted to make it their servant;\r\nbut it is its application as a source of light that is most interesting\r\nto us in connection with its discoverer.\r\n\r\nMany \"electric lights\" were invented by \"practical men,\" the power\r\nbeing generally derived from a galvanic battery; and it was discovered\r\nthat by making the terminals of the wires of charcoal, the brilliancy\r\nof the spark could be enormously increased. Some of these inventions\r\nwere proposed for lighthouses, and so came officially under the notice\r\nof Faraday as scientific adviser to the Trinity House. Thus he was\r\nengaged in 1853 and 1854 with the beautiful electric light of Dr.\r\nWatson, which he examined most carefully, evidently hoping it might be\r\nof service, and at length he wrote an elaborate report pointing out its\r\nadvantages, but at the same time the difficulties in the way of its\r\npractical adoption. The Trinity Corporation passed a special vote of\r\nthanks for his report, and hesitated to proceed further in the matter.\r\n\r\nBut Faraday's own spark was destined to be more successful. In 1853\r\nsome large magneto-electric machines were set up in Paris for producing\r\ncombustible gas by the decomposition of water. The scheme failed, but\r\na Mr. F. H. Holmes suggested that these expensive toys might be turned\r\nto account for the production of light. \"My propositions,\" he told\r\nthe Royal Commissioners of Lighthouses, \"were entirely ridiculed, and\r\nthe consequence was, that instead of saying that I thought I could do\r\nit, I promised to do it by a certain day. On that day, with one of\r\nDuboscq's regulators or lamps, I produced the magneto-electric light\r\nfor the first time; but as the machines were ill-constructed for the\r\npurpose, and as I had considerable difficulty to make even a temporary\r\nadjustment to produce a fitting current, the light could only be\r\nexhibited for a few minutes at a time.\" He turned his attention to the\r\nreconstruction of the machines, and after carrying on his experiments\r\nin Belgium, he applied to the Trinity Board in February 1857. Here\r\nwas the tiny spark, which Faraday had produced just twenty-five years\r\nbefore, exalted into a magnificent star, and for Faraday it was\r\nreserved to decide whether this star should shed its brilliance from\r\nthe cliffs of Albion. A good piece of optical apparatus, intended for\r\nthe Bishop Rock in the Scillies, happened to be at the experimental\r\nstation at Blackwall, and with this comparative experiments were made.\r\nWe can imagine something of the interest with which Faraday watched\r\nthe light from Woolwich, and asked questions of the inventor about\r\nall the details of its working and expense; and we can picture the\r\nalternations of hope and caution as he wrote in his report, \"The\r\nlight is so intense, so abundant, so concentrated and focal, so free\r\nfrom under-shadows (caused in the common lamp by the burner), so\r\nfree from flickering, that one cannot but desire it should succeed.\r\nBut,\" he adds, \"it would require _very careful_ and progressive\r\nintroduction--men with peculiar knowledge and skill to attend it; and\r\nthe means of instantly substituting one lamp for another in case of\r\naccident. The common lamp is so simple, both in principle and practice,\r\nthat its liability to failure is very small. There is no doubt that\r\nthe magneto-electric lamp involves a great number of circumstances\r\ntending to make its application more refined and delicate; but I would\r\nfain hope that none of these will prove a barrier to its introduction.\r\nNevertheless, it must pass into practice only through the ordeal of a\r\nfull, searching, and prolonged trial.\" This trial was made in the upper\r\nof the two light towers at the South Foreland; but it was not till the\r\n8th December, 1858, that the experiment was commenced. Faraday made\r\nobservations on it for the first two days, but it did not act well,\r\nand was discontinued till March 28, 1859, when it again shot forth its\r\npowerful rays across the Channel.\r\n\r\nIt was soon inspected by Faraday inside and outside, by land and by\r\nsea. His notes terminate in this way:--\"Went to the hills round, about\r\na mile off, or perhaps more, so as to see both upper and lower light\r\nat once. The effect was very fine. The lower light does not come near\r\nthe upper in its power, and, as to colour, looks red whilst the upper\r\nis white. The visible rays proceed from both horizontally, but those\r\nfrom the low light are not half so long as those from the electric\r\nlight. The radiation from the upper light was beautifully horizontal,\r\ngoing out right and left with intenseness like a horizontal flood\r\nof light, with blackness above and blackness below, yet the sky was\r\nclear and the stars shining brightly. It seemed as if the lanthorn[28]\r\nonly were above the earth, so dark was the path immediately below the\r\nlanthorn, yet the whole tower was visible from the place. As to the\r\nshadows of the uprights, one could walk into one and across, and see\r\nthe diminution of the light, and could easily see when the edge of\r\nthe shadow was passed. They varied in width according to the distance\r\nfrom the lanthorn. With upright bars their effect is considerable at a\r\ndistance, as seen last night; but inclining these bars would help in\r\nthe distance, though not so much as with a light having considerable\r\nupright dimension, as is the case with an oil-lamp.\r\n\r\n\"The shadows on a white card are very clear on the edge--a watch very\r\ndistinct and legible. On lowering the head near certain valleys, the\r\nfeeble shadow of the distant grass and leaves was evident. The light\r\nwas beautifully steady and bright, with no signs of variation--the\r\nappearance was such as to give confidence to the mind--no doubt about\r\nits continuance.\r\n\r\n\"As a light it is unexceptionable--as a magneto-electric light\r\nwonderful--and seems to have all the adjustments of quality and more\r\nthan can be applied to a voltaic electric light or a Ruhmkorff coil.\"\r\n\r\nThe Royal Commissioners and others saw with gratification this\r\nbeautiful light, and arrangements were made for getting systematic\r\nobservations of it by the keepers of all the lighthouses within view,\r\nthe masters of the light-vessels that guard the Goodwin Sands, and the\r\ncrews of pilot cutters; after which Faraday wrote a very favourable\r\nreport, saying, among other things: \"I beg to state that in my\r\nopinion Professor Holmes has practically established the fitness and\r\nsufficiency of the magneto-electric light for lighthouse purposes, so\r\nfar as its nature and management are concerned. The light produced\r\nis powerful beyond any other that I have yet seen so applied, and in\r\nprinciple may be accumulated to any degree; its regularity in the\r\nlanthorn is great, its management easy, and its care there may be\r\nconfided to attentive keepers of the ordinary degree of intellect and\r\nknowledge.\"[29]\r\n\r\nThe Elder Brethren then wished a further trial of six months, during\r\nwhich time the light was to be entirely under their own control. It\r\nwas therefore again kindled on August 22, and the experiment happened\r\nsoon to be exposed to a severe test, as one of the light-keepers, who\r\nhad been accustomed to the arrangement of the lamps in the lantern,\r\nwas suddenly removed, and another took his place without any previous\r\ninstruction. This man thought the light sufficiently strong if he\r\nallowed the carbon points to touch, as the lamp then required no\r\nattendance whatever, and he could leave it in that way for hours\r\ntogether. On being remonstrated with, he said, \"It is quite good\r\nenough.\" Notwithstanding such difficulties as these, the experiment was\r\nconsidered satisfactory, but it was discontinued at the South Foreland,\r\nfor the cliffs there are marked by a double light, and the electric\r\nspark was so much brighter than the oil flames in the other house, that\r\nthere was no small danger of its being seen alone in thick weather, and\r\nthus fatally misleading some unfortunate vessel.\r\n\r\nAfter this Faraday made further observations, estimates of the expense,\r\nand experiments on the divergence of the beam, while Mr. Holmes worked\r\naway at Northfleet perfecting his apparatus, and the authorities\r\ndebated whether it was to be exhibited again at the Start, which is\r\na revolving light, or at Dungeness, which is fixed. The scientific\r\nadviser was in favour of the Start, but after an interview with Mr.\r\nMilner Gibson, then President of the Board of Trade, Dungeness was\r\ndetermined on; a beautiful small combination of lenses and prisms was\r\nmade expressly for it by Messrs. Chance, and at last, after two years'\r\ndelay, the light again shone on our southern coast.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to describe the apparatus. There are 120 permanent\r\nmagnets, weighing about 50 lbs. each, ranged on the periphery of two\r\nlarge wheels. A steam-engine of about three-horse power causes a series\r\nof 180 soft iron cores, surrounded by coils of wire, to rotate past\r\nthe magnets. This calls the power into action, and the small streams\r\nof electricity are all collected together, and by what is called a\r\n\"commutator\" the alternative positive and negative currents are brought\r\ninto one direction. The whole power is then conveyed by a thick wire\r\nfrom the engine-house to the lighthouse tower, and up into the centre\r\nof the glass apparatus. There it passes between two charcoal points,\r\nand produces an intensely brilliant continuous spark. At sunset the\r\nmachine is started, making about 100 revolutions per minute; and the\r\nattendant has only to draw two bolts in the lamp, when the power thus\r\nspun in the engine-room bursts into light of full intensity. The \"lamp\"\r\nregulates itself, so as to keep the points always at a proper distance\r\napart, and continues to burn, needing little or no attention for three\r\nhours and a half, when, the charcoals being consumed, the lamp must be\r\nchanged, but this is done without extinguishing the light.\r\n\r\nAgain there were inspections, and reports from pilots and other\r\nobservers, and Faraday propounded lists of questions to the engineer\r\nabout bolts and screws and donkey-engines, while he estimated that\r\nat the Varne light-ship, about equidistant from Cape Grisnez and\r\nDungeness, the maximum effect of the revolving French light was\r\nequalled by the constant gleam from the English tower. But delays again\r\nensued till intelligent keepers could be found and properly instructed;\r\nbut on the 6th June, 1862, Faraday's own light, the baby grown into a\r\ngiant, shone permanently on the coast of Britain.\r\n\r\nFrance, too, was alert. Berlioz's machine, which was displayed at\r\nthe International Exhibition in London, and which was also examined\r\nby Faraday, was approved by the French Government, and was soon\r\nilluminating the double lighthouse near Havre. These magneto-electric\r\nlights on either side of the Channel have stood the test of years;\r\nand during the last two years there has shone another still more\r\nbeautiful one at Souter Point, near Tynemouth; while the narrow strait\r\nbetween England and France is now guarded by these \"sentinels of\r\npeaceful progress,\" for the revolving light at Grisnez has been lately\r\nilluminated on this principle, and on the 1st of January, 1872, the two\r\nlights of the South Foreland flashed forth with the electric flame.[30]\r\n\r\nIn describing thus the valuable applications of Faraday's discoveries\r\nof benzol, of specific inductive capacity, and of magneto-electricity,\r\nit is not intended to exalt these above other discoveries which as yet\r\nhave paid no tribute to the material wants of man. The good fruit borne\r\nby other researches may not be sufficiently mature, but it doubtless\r\ncontains the seeds of many useful inventions. Yet, after all, we must\r\nnot measure the worth of Faraday's discoveries by any standard of\r\npractical utility in the present or in the future. His chief merit\r\nis that he enlarged so much the boundaries of our knowledge of the\r\nphysical forces, opened up so many new realms of thought, and won so\r\nmany heights which have become the starting-points for other explorers.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[25] De la Rive points this out in his brief notice of Faraday\r\nimmediately on receiving the news of his death:--\"Je n'ai parlé que\r\ndu savant, je tiens aussi à dire un mot de l'homme. Alliant à une\r\nmodestie vraie, parcequ'elle provenait de l'élévation de son âme, une\r\ndroiture à toute épreuve et une candeur admirable, Faraday n'aimait la\r\nscience que pour elle-même. Aussi jouissait-il des succès des autres\r\nau moins autant que des siens propres; et quant à lui, s'il a accepté,\r\navec une sincère satisfaction, les honneurs scientifiques qui lui out\r\nété prodigués à si juste titre, il a constamment refusé toutes les\r\nautres distinctions et les récompenses qu'on eût voulu lui décerner. Il\r\ns'est contenté toute sa vie de la position relativement modeste qu'il\r\noccupait à l'Institution Royale de Londres; avoir son laboratoire et\r\nstrictement de quoi vivre, c'est tout ce qu'il lui fallait.--Presinge,\r\nle 29 août, 1867.--A. DE LA RIVE.\"\r\n\r\n[26] Preface to \"Faraday und seine Entdeckungen.\"\r\n\r\n[27] I am indebted to Sir Charles Wheatstone for the following\r\nimpromptu by Herbert Mayo:--\r\n\r\n               \"Around the magnet Faraday\r\n                Was sure that Volta's lightnings play:\r\n                  But how to draw them from the wire?\r\n                He drew a lesson from the heart:\r\n                'Tis when we meet, 'tis when we part,\r\n                  Breaks forth the electric fire.\"\r\n\r\n[28] The room with glass sides, from which the light is exhibited at\r\nthe top of a lighthouse, is called by this name.\r\n\r\n[29] One night there was a beautiful aurora. Mr. Holmes remarked\r\nthat his poor electric light could not compare with that for beauty;\r\nbut Faraday rejoined, \"Don't abuse your light. The aurora is very\r\nbeautiful, and so is a wild horse, but you have tamed it and made it\r\nvaluable.\"\r\n\r\n[30] The illuminating apparatus at Dungeness is one of what is termed\r\nthe sixth order, 300 millimetres (about 12 inches) in diameter. Mr.\r\nChance constructed one for Souter Point of the third order, one metre\r\n(nearly 40 inches) in diameter, with special arrangements for giving\r\nartificial divergence to the beam in a vertical direction, in order to\r\nobviate the danger arising from the luminous point not being always\r\nprecisely in the same spot. It has also additional contrivances for\r\nutilizing the back light. Similar arrangements were made for the South\r\nForeland lights, which are also of the third order; and every portion\r\nof the machinery and apparatus is in duplicate in case of accident, and\r\nthe double force can be employed in times of fog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY PORTRAITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been said that there is no photograph or painting of Faraday\r\nwhich is a satisfactory likeness; not because good portraits have\r\nnever been published, but because they cannot give the varied and\r\never-shifting expression of his features. Similarly, I fear that the\r\nmental portraiture which I have attempted will fail to satisfy his\r\nintimate acquaintance. Yet, as one who never saw him in the flesh\r\nmay gain a good idea of his personal appearance by comparing several\r\npictures, so the reader may learn more of his intellectual and moral\r\nfeatures by combining the several estimates which have been made by\r\ndifferent minds. Earlier biographies have been already referred to, but\r\nmy sketch may well be supplemented by an anonymous poem that appeared\r\nimmediately after his death, and by the words of two of the most\r\ndistinguished foreign philosophers--Messrs. De la Rive and Dumas.\r\n\r\n      \"Statesmen and soldiers, authors, artists,--still\r\n         The topmost leaves fall off our English oak:\r\n       Some in green summer's prime, some in the chill\r\n         Of autumn-tide, some by late winter's stroke.\r\n\r\n      \"Another leaf has dropped on that sere heap--\r\n         One that hung highest; earliest to invite\r\n       The golden kiss of morn, and last to keep\r\n         The fire of eve--but still turned to the light.\r\n\r\n      \"No soldier's, statesman's, poet's, painter's name\r\n         Was this, thro' which is drawn Death's last black line;\r\n       But one of rarer, if not loftier fame--\r\n         A priest of Truth, who lived within her shrine.\r\n\r\n      \"A priest of Truth: his office to expound\r\n         Earth's mysteries to all who willed to hear--\r\n       Who in the book of Science sought and found,\r\n         With love, that knew all reverence, but no fear.\r\n\r\n      \"A priest, who prayed as well as ministered:\r\n         Who grasped the faith he preached; and held it fast:\r\n       Knowing the light he followed never stirred,\r\n         Howe'er might drive the clouds thro' which it past.\r\n\r\n      \"And if Truth's priest, servant of Science too,\r\n         Whose work was wrought for love and not for gain:\r\n       Not one of those who serve but to ensue\r\n         Their private profit: lordship to attain\r\n\r\n      \"Over their lord, and bind him in green withes,\r\n         For grinding at the mill 'neath rod and cord;\r\n       Of the large grist that they may take their tithes--\r\n         So some serve Science that call Science lord.\r\n\r\n      \"One rule his life was fashioned to fulfil:\r\n         That he who tends Truth's shrine, and does the hest\r\n       Of Science, with a humble, faithful will,\r\n         The God of Truth and Knowledge serveth best.\r\n\r\n      \"And from his humbleness what heights he won!\r\n         By slow march of induction, pace on pace,\r\n       Scaling the peaks that seemed to strike the sun,\r\n         Whence few can look, unblinded, in his face.\r\n\r\n      \"Until he reached the stand which they that win\r\n         A bird's-eye glance o'er Nature's realm may throw;\r\n       Whence the mind's ken by larger sweeps takes in\r\n         What seems confusion, looked at from below.\r\n\r\n      \"Till out of seeming chaos order grows,\r\n         In ever-widening orbs of Law restrained,\r\n       And the Creation's mighty music flows\r\n         In perfect harmony, serene, sustained;\r\n\r\n      \"And from varieties of force and power,\r\n         A larger unity, and larger still,\r\n       Broadens to view, till in some breathless hour\r\n         All force is known, grasped in a central Will,\r\n\r\n      \"Thunder and light revealed as one same strength--\r\n         Modes of the force that works at Nature's heart--\r\n       And through the Universe's veinèd length\r\n         Bids, wave on wave, mysterious pulses dart.\r\n\r\n      \"That cosmic heart-beat it was his to list,\r\n         To trace those pulses in their ebb and flow\r\n       Towards the fountain-head, where they subsist\r\n         In form as yet not given e'en _him_ to know.\r\n\r\n      \"Yet, living face to face with these great laws,\r\n         Great truths, great myst'ries, all who saw him near\r\n       Knew him for child-like, simple, free from flaws\r\n         Of temper, full of love that casts out fear:\r\n\r\n      \"Untired in charity, of cheer serene;\r\n         Not caring world's wealth or good word to earn;\r\n       Childhood's or manhood's ear content to win;\r\n         And still as glad to teach as meek to learn.\r\n\r\n      \"Such lives are precious: not so much for all\r\n         Of wider insight won where they have striven,\r\n       As for the still small voice with which they call\r\n         Along the beamy way from earth to heaven.\"\r\n\r\n                                    _Punch_, September 7, 1867.\r\n\r\nThe estimate of M. A. de la Rive is from a letter he addressed to\r\nFaraday himself:--\r\n\r\n\"I am grieved to hear that your brain is weary; this has sometimes\r\nhappened on former occasions, in consequence of your numerous and\r\npersevering labours, and you will bear in mind that a little rest is\r\nnecessary to restore you. You possess that which best contributes to\r\npeace of mind and serenity of spirit--a full and perfect faith, a pure\r\nand tranquil conscience, filling your heart with the glorious hopes\r\nwhich the Gospel imparts. You have also the advantage of having always\r\nled a smooth and well-regulated life, free from ambition, and therefore\r\nexempt from all the anxieties and drawbacks which are inseparable from\r\nit. Honour has sought you in spite of yourself; you have known, without\r\ndespising it, how to value it at its true worth. You have known how to\r\ngain the high esteem, and at the same time the affection, of all those\r\nacquainted with you.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, thanks to the goodness of God, you have not suffered any of\r\nthose family misfortunes which crush one's life. You should, therefore,\r\nwatch the approach of old age without fear and without bitterness,\r\nhaving the comforting feeling that the wonders which you have been\r\nable to decipher in the book of nature must contribute to the greater\r\nreverence and adoration of their Supreme Author.\r\n\r\n\"Such, my dear friend, is the impression that your beautiful life\r\nalways leaves upon me; and when I compare it with our troubled and\r\nill-fulfilled life-course, with all that accumulation of drawbacks and\r\ngriefs by which mine in particular has been attended, I put you down as\r\nvery happy, especially as you are worthy of your good fortune. This\r\nleads me to reflect on the miserable state of those who are without\r\nthat religious faith which you possess in so great a degree.\"\r\n\r\nIn M. Dumas' Eloge at the Académie des Sciences, occur the following\r\nsentences:--\r\n\r\n\"I do not know whether there is a _savant_ who would not feel happy in\r\nleaving behind him such works as those with which Faraday has gladdened\r\nhis contemporaries, and which he has left as a legacy to posterity: but\r\nI am certain that all those who have known him would wish to approach\r\nthat moral perfection which he attained to without effort. In him it\r\nappeared to be a natural grace, which made him a professor full of\r\nardour for the diffusion of truth, an indefatigable worker, full of\r\nenthusiasm and sprightliness in his laboratory, the best and most\r\namiable of men in the bosom of his family, and the most enlightened\r\npreacher amongst the humble flock whose faith he followed.\r\n\r\n\"The simplicity of his heart, his candour, his ardent love of the\r\ntruth, his fellow-interest in all the successes, and ingenuous\r\nadmiration of all the discoveries of others, his natural modesty in\r\nregard to what he himself discovered, his noble soul--independent and\r\nbold,--all these combined gave an incomparable charm to the features of\r\nthe illustrious physicist.\r\n\r\n\"I have never known a man more worthy of being loved, of being admired,\r\nof being mourned.\r\n\r\n\"Fidelity to his religious faith, and the constant observance of the\r\nmoral law, constitute the ruling characteristics of his life. Doubtless\r\nhis firm belief in that justice on high which weighs all our merits,\r\nin that sovereign goodness which weighs all our sufferings, did not\r\ninspire Faraday with his great discoveries, but it gave him the\r\nstraightforwardness, the self-respect, the self-control, and the spirit\r\nof justice, which enabled him to combat evil fortune with boldness, and\r\nto accept prosperity without being puffed up....\r\n\r\n\"There was nothing dramatic in the life of Faraday. It should be\r\npresented under that simplicity of aspect which is the grandeur of it.\r\nThere is, however, more than one useful lesson to be learnt from the\r\nproper study of this illustrious man, whose youth endured poverty with\r\ndignity, whose mature age bore honours with moderation, and whose last\r\nyears have just passed gently away surrounded by marks of respect and\r\ntender affection.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nLIST OF LEARNED SOCIETIES TO WHICH MICHAEL FARADAY BELONGED.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ANNO\r\n\r\n  1823.
