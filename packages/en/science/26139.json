The remaining part of the Manual\r\ndeals more particularly with the subject in its application to the\r\ndifferent Public and Separate School Forms. While this division of the\r\nmatter into Forms is convenient for general classification, it is not to\r\nbe regarded as arbitrary. Materials and methods of presentation suitable\r\nfor one class of pupils in a certain Form might, under different\r\nconditions, be quite unsuitable for another class of pupils in the same\r\nForm. For example, work which would be suitable for a class in Form I\r\nmade up of pupils admitted to a school at seven or eight years of age,\r\nafter two years' training in a kindergarten where nature lessons\r\nreceived special attention, would not be suitable for a Form I class\r\nmade up of pupils admitted to a school at five years of age with no such\r\nprevious training. In selecting work for any class the teacher,\r\ntherefore, should not be guided solely by the arbitrary divisions of the\r\nManual, but should exercise his own judgment, taking into account his\r\nenvironment and the attainments of his pupils. To facilitate such a\r\nselection, page references are given in the details of the Course of\r\nStudy, which in reality forms a detailed expansion of the Public and\r\nSeparate School Course in Nature Study. By means of these references,\r\nthe teacher may find, in any department of the subject, typical matter\r\nsuited to the development of his pupils.\r\n\r\nThe numerous type lessons that are contained in the Manual are intended\r\nto suggest principles of method that are to be applied in lessons upon\r\nthe same and similar topics, but the teacher is cautioned against\r\nattempting to imitate these lessons. This error can be avoided by the\r\nteacher's careful preparation of the lesson. This preparation should\r\ninclude the careful study of the concrete materials that are to be used.\r\nThe books, bulletins, etc., that are named in the Manual as references\r\nwill be found helpful.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate teaching through the experimental and investigation\r\nmethods, special attention has been given to the improvising of simple\r\napparatus from materials within the reach of every teacher.\r\n\r\nFrom the character of the subject the Course of Study must be more or\r\nless elastic, and the topics detailed in the programme are intended to\r\nbe suggestive rather than prescriptive. It may be that, owing to local\r\nconditions, topics not named are among the best that can be used, but\r\nall substitutions and changes should be made a subject of consultation\r\nwith the Inspector. The treatment of the subject must always be suited\r\nto the age and experience of the pupils, to the seasons of the year,\r\naccessibility of materials, etc. Notes should not be dictated by the\r\nteacher. Mere information, whether from book, written note, or teacher,\r\nis not Nature Study. The acquisition of knowledge must be made secondary\r\nto awakening and maintaining the pupil's interest in nature and to\r\ntraining him to habits of observation and investigation.\r\n\r\nAs a guide to the minimum of work required, it is suggested that at\r\nleast one lesson be taught from the subjects outlined under each general\r\nheading in the detailed Course of Study, with a minimum average of three\r\nlessons from the subjects under each general heading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC AND SEPARATE SCHOOL\r\n\r\nCOURSE OF STUDY\r\n\r\nDETAILS\r\n\r\n\r\nFORM I\r\n\r\nAUTUMN\r\n\r\nGARDEN WORK AND GARDEN STUDIES:\r\n\r\nDivision of the garden plots, removal of weeds and observations on these\r\nweeds, identification of garden plants, observation lessons based on\r\ngarden plants, selection of seeds, harvesting and disposing of the crop.\r\n(See pp. 54-9.)\r\n\r\nSTUDY OF PLANTS:\r\n\r\nClass lessons based on a flowering garden plant, as pansy, aster,\r\nnasturtium; study of a field plant, as buttercup, goldenrod, dandelion.\r\n(See pp. 55-9.)\r\n\r\nPotted and garden plants: Observation lesson based on a bulb; planting\r\nbulbs in pots, or in the garden.

Like all other subjects, it must justify its position\r\non the school curriculum by proving its power to equip the pupil for the\r\nresponsibilities of citizenship. That citizen is best prepared for life\r\nwho lives in most sympathetic and intelligent relation to his\r\nenvironment, and it is the primary aim of Nature Study to maintain the\r\nbond of interest which unites the child's life to the objects and\r\nphenomena which surround him. To this end it is necessary to adapt the\r\nteaching, in matter and method, to the conditions of the child's life,\r\nthat he may learn to understand the secrets of nature and be the better\r\nable to control and utilize the forces of his natural environment.\r\n\r\nAt all times, the teacher must keep in mind the fact that it is not the\r\nquantity of matter taught but the interest aroused and the spirit of\r\ninvestigation fostered, together with carefulness and thoroughness,\r\nwhich are the important ends to be sought. With a mind trained to\r\nexperiment and stimulated by a glimpse into nature's secrets, the worker\r\nfinds in his labour a scientific interest that lifts it above drudgery,\r\nwhile, from a fuller understanding of the forces which he must combat\r\nor with which he must co-operate, he reaps better rewards for his\r\nlabours.\r\n\r\nThe claims of Nature Study to an educative value are based not upon a\r\ndesire to displace conventional education, but to supplement it, and to\r\nlay a foundation for subsequent reading. Constant exercise of the senses\r\nstrengthens these sources of information and develops alertness, and at\r\nthe same time the child is kept on familiar ground--the world of\r\nrealities. It is for these reasons that Nature Study is frequently\r\ndefined as \"The Natural Method of Study\". Independent observation and\r\ninference should be encouraged to the fullest degree, for one of the\r\nmost important, though one of the rarer accomplishments of the modern\r\nintellect, is to think independently and to avoid the easier mode of\r\naccepting the opinions of others. Reading from nature books, the study\r\nof pictures, and other such matter, is not Nature Study. These may\r\nsupplement Nature Study, but must not displace the actual vitalizing\r\ncontact between the child and natural objects and forces.\r\n\r\nIt is this contact which is at the basis of clear, definite knowledge;\r\nand clearness of thought and a feeling of at-homeness with the subject\r\nis conducive to clearness and freedom of expression. The Nature Study\r\nlesson should therefore be used as a basis for language lessons.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly one of the most important educative values that can be\r\nclaimed for Nature Study is its influence in training the pupil to\r\nappreciate natural objects and phenomena. This implies the widening and\r\nenriching of human interests through nurturing the innate tendency of\r\nthe child to love the fields and woods and birds; the checking of the\r\nselfish and destructive impulses by leading him to see the usefulness of\r\neach creature, the harmony of its relation to its environment, and the\r\nsignificance of its every part. Nor is it a mistake to cultivate the\r\nmore sentimental love of nature which belongs to the artist and the\r\npoet. John Ruskin emphasizes this value in these words: \"All other\r\nefforts are futile unless you have taught the children to love trees and\r\nbirds and flowers\".\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL METHODS IN NATURE STUDY\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCRETE MATERIAL\r\n\r\nIt is evident that concrete material must be provided and so distributed\r\nthat each member of the class will have a direct opportunity to exercise\r\nhis senses, and, from his observations, to deduce inferences and form\r\njudgments. The objects chosen should be mainly from the common things of\r\nthe locality. The teacher should be guided in the selection by the\r\ninterests of the pupils, first finding out from them the things upon\r\nwhich they are expending their wonder and inquiry. Trees, field crops,\r\nflowers, birds, animals of the parks, woods, or farmyard, all form\r\nsuitable subjects for study.\r\n\r\nTOPICS AND MATERIAL MUST SUIT THE SEASON\r\n\r\nThe material should be selected not only with reference to locality but\r\nalso with due regard to season. For example, better Nature Study lessons\r\ncan be taught on the elm tree of the school grounds than on the giant\r\nDouglas fir of British Columbia; and on the oriole whose nest is in the\r\nelm tree than on the eagle portrayed in Roberts' animal stories; and it\r\nis manifestly unwise to teach lessons on snow in summer, or on flowers\r\nand ants in winter.\r\n\r\nMATTER MUST BE SUITED TO THE CHILD\r\n\r\nFor the urban pupil the treatment of the material must be different from\r\nthat in the case of the pupil of the rural school. Rural school pupils\r\nhave already formed an extensive acquaintance with many plants and\r\nanimals which are entirely unknown to the children of the city. The\r\nsimpler facts which are interesting and instructive to the pupils of the\r\nurban classes would prove commonplace and trivial to rural pupils. For\r\nexample, while it is necessary to show the city child a squirrel that he\r\nmay learn the size, colour, and general appearance of the animal, the\r\nefforts of the pupil of the rural school should be directed to the\r\ndiscovery of the less evident facts of squirrel life.\r\n\r\nUSE OF THE COMMONPLACE\r\n\r\nIt must be kept in mind that besides leading the pupils to discover new\r\nsources of interest, the teacher should strive to accomplish that which\r\nis even greater, namely, to lead them to discover new truth and new\r\nbeauty in old, familiar objects. It may be true that \"familiarity breeds\r\ncontempt\" and there is always a danger that the objects with which\r\nchildren have associated in early life may be passed by as uninteresting\r\nwhile they go in search of something \"new and interesting\".\r\n\r\nFor example, to be able to recognize many plants and to call them by\r\nname is no doubt something of an accomplishment, but it should not be\r\nthe chief aim of the teacher in conducting Nature Study lessons on\r\nplants. It is of much greater importance that the child should be led to\r\nlove the flowers and to appreciate their beauty and their utility. Such\r\nappreciation will result in the desire to protect and to produce fine\r\nflowers and useful plants, and this end can be reached only through\r\nintelligent acquaintanceship. There can be no true appreciation without\r\nknowledge, and this the child gets chiefly by personal observation and\r\nexperiment. With reference to the wild flowers of the woods and fields,\r\nthe method employed is that of continuous observation.\r\n\r\nORDER OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE LESSON\r\n\r\nEach animal or plant should be studied as a living, active organism. The\r\nattention of the pupils should be focused upon activities; for these\r\nappeal to the child nature and afford the best means for securing\r\ninterest and attention. What does this animal do? How does it do it? How\r\nis it fitted for doing this? How does this plant grow? What fits it for\r\ngrowing in this way? These are questions which should exercise the mind\r\nof the child. They are questions natural in the spirit of inquiry in\r\nchild nature and give vitality to nature teaching. They are an effective\r\nmeans of establishing a bond of sympathy between the child and nature.\r\nThe child who takes care of a plant or animal because it is his own,\r\ndoes so at first from a purely personal motive, which is perfectly\r\nnatural to childhood; but while he studies its needs and observes its\r\nmovements and changes, gradually and unconsciously this interest will be\r\ntransferred to the plant or animal for its own sake. The nature of the\r\nchild is thus broadened during the process.\r\n\r\nPROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION\r\n\r\nIn studying the material provided, whether it be in the class-room, or\r\nduring a nature excursion, or by observations made in the farmyard at\r\nhome, the teacher must guide the efforts of the pupils by assigning to\r\nthem definite and suitable problems. Care must be taken to reach the\r\nhappy mean of giving specific directions without depriving the pupils of\r\nthe pleasure of making original discovery. For example, instead of\r\nasking them to study the foot of the horse and learn all they can about\r\nit, more specific problems should be assigned, such as: Observe how the\r\nhoof is placed on the ground in walking. What are the arrangements for\r\nlessening the shock when the hoof strikes the ground? Examine the under\r\nsurface of the hoof and discover what prevents the unshod horse from\r\nslipping.\r\n\r\nNOTE-BOOKS AND RECORDS\r\n\r\nIn Grades higher than Form I, written exercises should be required and\r\nalso sketches representing the objects studied. For this purpose a\r\nNature Study note-book is necessary--a loose-leaf note-book being\r\npreferable because of necessary corrections, rearrangements, additions,\r\nor omissions.\r\n\r\nIn all records and reports, independence of thought and of expression\r\nshould be encouraged. The drawing and the oral or written description\r\nshould express what is actually observed, not what the book or some\r\nmember of the class says has been, or should be, observed. The\r\ndescriptions should be in the pupil's own words, because these are most\r\nin keeping with his own ideas on the subject. More correct forms of\r\nexpression may be obtained when notes are taken from the teacher's\r\ndictation, but this is fatal to the development of originality.\r\n\r\nThe disparity of the results in individual work gives opportunity for\r\nimpressing upon the pupil, in the first place, the necessity for more\r\naccurate observation and, secondly, the impossibility of reaching a\r\ncorrect general conclusion without having studied a large number of\r\nexamples. The development of critical and judicious minds, which may\r\nresult from carefully observing many examples and generalizing from\r\nthese observations, is vastly more important than the memorizing of many\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOOL GARDEN\r\n\r\nIn the study of garden plants there is added a certain new interest\r\narising out of experimentation, cultivation, and ownership. The love of\r\nthe gardener has in it elements that the love of the naturalist does not\r\nusually possess--a sort of paternal love and care for the plants\r\nproduced in his garden; but every gardener should be a naturalist as\r\nwell. Most people have a higher appreciation for that which they own and\r\nwhich they have produced or acquired at some expense or personal\r\nsacrifice; therefore it is that the growing of plants in home and school\r\ngardens or in pots and window boxes is so strongly advocated throughout\r\nthis Course. Ownership always implies responsibility, which is at once\r\nthe chief safeguard of society and the foundation of citizenship. A\r\ncareless boy will never respect the property of others so much as when\r\nhe himself has proprietary interests involved. We believe, therefore,\r\nthat every teacher should encourage his pupils to cultivate plants and,\r\nif possible, to own a plot of ground however small.\r\n\r\nThe teacher should not merely aim at _making_ a garden in the school\r\ngrounds. The great question is rather how best to use a school garden in\r\nconnection with the training of boys and girls. To learn to do garden\r\nwork well is indeed worth while and provides a highly beneficial kind of\r\nmanual training. To understand something of soils and methods of\r\ncultivation, of fertilizers and drainage, the best kinds of flowers,\r\nvegetables, fruits, and farm crops, and how to grow them successfully,\r\nis very important in such a great agricultural country as this; but the\r\ngreatest of all results which we may hope to realize in connection with\r\nschool gardening is the ennobling of life and character. The pupils are\r\ntaught to observe the growing plants with great care, noting\r\ndevelopments day by day. This adds to their appreciation of the beauties\r\nand adaptations found among plants on every side, and cannot fail to\r\nproduce good results in moral as well as in mental development. The\r\nteachers must always remember that the gardeners with whom they are\r\nworking are more important than the gardens which they cultivate.\r\n\r\nThe best garden is not always the largest and most elaborate one. It is\r\nrather the garden that both teacher and pupils have been most deeply\r\ninterested in. It is the garden in which they have experienced most\r\npleasure and profit that makes them want to have another better than the\r\nlast. No school is too small to have a garden of some kind, and no\r\ngarden is too small to become the joy and pride of some boy or girl.\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of teachers beginning their duties on the first of\r\nSeptember, in school sections where school gardening has never been\r\ncarried on, the following suggestions are offered:\r\n\r\n1. See if the grounds will permit of a part being used for a garden. To\r\nascertain this, note the size of the present grounds and see if they\r\nmeet the requirements of the Department as laid down in the Regulations.\r\nIf they do not, consult your Inspector at once and acquaint him with\r\nyour plans. If the grounds are to be enlarged, try to take in sufficient\r\nland of good quality to make a good garden. The part chosen for the\r\ngarden should be both convenient and safe. Examine the soil to see if it\r\nis well drained and sufficiently deep to permit of good cultivation.\r\nLack of fertility can be overcome by good fertilizing.\r\n\r\n2. See that the fences and gates are in good repair. When circumstances\r\nwill permit, a woven wire fence that will exclude dogs, pigs, and\r\npoultry is most desirable. If not used to inclose the whole grounds, it\r\nshould at least inclose the part used for gardening.\r\n\r\n3. Begin modestly and provide room for extension as the work progresses.\r\nSow clover on the part to be held in reserve for future gardening\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n4. If local public sentiment is not strongly in favour of school\r\ngardening, or is somewhat adverse, begin on a small scale. If the work\r\nis well done, you will soon have both moral and financial support.\r\n\r\n5. See that the land is well drained. Plough it early in the autumn and,\r\nif a load of well-rotted manure is available, spread it on the land\r\nbefore ploughing. Commercial fertilizer may also be used on the plots\r\nthe following spring, but no stable manure.\r\n\r\n6. In spring, when dry enough, cultivate thoroughly with disc and drag\r\nharrows. Build up a compost heap in the rear of the garden with sods and\r\nstable manure, for use in the autumn and also the following spring.\r\n\r\nGARDEN EXPENSES\r\n\r\nIn connection with those schools where the teacher holds a diploma from\r\nthe Ontario Agricultural College in Elementary Agriculture and\r\nHorticulture, there is no difficulty in meeting the expenses for seeds,\r\ntools, fertilizers, and labour, as the Government grant for such\r\npurposes is sufficient. In other schools, however, where the teacher\r\nholds no such diploma (and such is the case in most of the schools as\r\nyet), other means of meeting the expenses must be resorted to. The\r\nfollowing are offered as suggestions along this line:\r\n\r\n1. Part of the grant made to every school for the maintaining of the\r\nschool grounds should be available for school garden expenses.\r\n\r\n2. An occasional school entertainment may add funds that could not be\r\nused to better advantage.\r\n\r\n3. An occasional load of stable manure supplied free from neighbouring\r\nfarms will help to solve the fertilizer problem.\r\n\r\n4. Donations of plants and seeds by the parents and other interested\r\npersons and societies will be forthcoming, if the teacher is in earnest\r\nand his pupils interested.\r\n\r\n5. If it is required, the trustees could make a small grant each year\r\ntoward the cost of tools.\r\n\r\n6. Fencing and cultivation of the garden can often be provided for by\r\nvolunteer assistance from the men of the school section.\r\n\r\n7. It is often possible to grow a garden crop on a fairly large scale,\r\nthe school being formed into a company for this purpose and the proceeds\r\nto be used to meet garden expenses.\r\n\r\n8. The pupils can readily bring the necessary tools from home for the\r\nfirst season's work.\r\n\r\n9. Many Agricultural and Horticultural societies offer very substantial\r\ncash prizes for school garden exhibits, and all funds so obtained should\r\nbe used to improve the garden from which the exhibits were taken.\r\n\r\n10. An earnest, resourceful teacher will find a way of meeting the\r\nnecessary expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EXCURSION\r\n\r\nNature Study is essentially an outdoor subject. While it is true that a\r\nconsiderable amount of valuable work may be done in the class-room by\r\nthe aid of aquaria, insectaria, and window boxes, yet the great book of\r\nnature lies outside the school-house walls. The teacher must lead or\r\ndirect his pupils to that book and help them to read with reverent\r\nspirit what is written there by its great Author.\r\n\r\n~Value.~--The school excursion is valuable chiefly because it brings the\r\npupil into close contact with the objects that he is studying, permits\r\nhim to get his knowledge at first hand, and gives him an opportunity of\r\nstudying these objects in their natural environment. Incidentally the\r\nexcursion yields outdoor exercise under the very best conditions--no\r\nslight advantage for city children especially; and it gives the teacher\r\na good opportunity to study the pupils from a new standpoint. It also\r\nprovides a means of gathering Nature Study material.\r\n\r\n~Difficulties.~--Where is the time to be found? How can a large class of\r\nchildren be managed in the woods or fields? If only one class be taken,\r\nhow, in an ungraded school, are the rest of the children to be employed?\r\nWill the excursion not degenerate into a mere outing? What if the woods\r\nare miles away? These are all real problems, and the Nature Study\r\nteacher, desirous of doing his work well, will have to face some of them\r\nat least.\r\n\r\nSHORT EXCURSIONS\r\n\r\nThe excursion need not occupy much time. It should be well planned\r\nbeforehand. _One_ object only should be kept in view and announced to\r\nthe class before starting. Matters foreign or subordinate to this\r\nshould be neglected for the time. The following are suggested as objects\r\nfor excursions:\r\n\r\n~Objects.~--A bird's nest in an adjacent meadow; a ground-hog's hole; a\r\nmusk-rat's home; crayfish or clams in the stream near by; a pine (or\r\nother) tree; a toad's day-resort; the soil of a field; the pests of a\r\nneighbouring orchard; a stone-heap or quarry; ants' nests or earthworms'\r\nholes; the weeds of the school yard; buds; the vegetable or animal life\r\nof a pond; sounds of spring; tracks in the snow; a spider's web.\r\n\r\nSuch excursions may be accomplished at the expenditure of very little\r\ntime. Many of them will take the pupils no farther than the boundaries\r\nof the school yard.\r\n\r\nOf course the locality will influence the character of the excursion, as\r\nit will that of the whole of the work done in Nature Study, but in any\r\nplace the thoughtful teacher may find material for open-air work at his\r\nvery door.\r\n\r\nMuch outside work can be done without interfering with the regular\r\nprogramme. The teacher may arrange a systematic list of questions and\r\nproblems for the pupils to solve from their own observations, and these\r\nobservations may be made by the pupils at play hours, or while coming or\r\ngoing from school, or on Saturdays. The following will serve as an\r\nexample of the treatment that may be followed:\r\n\r\n~Pests of Apple Trees.~--Look on the twigs of your apple trees for little\r\nscales. Bring an infected branch to school. Note whether\r\nunhealthy-looking or dead branches are infected. Examine scales with a\r\nlens. Loosen one, turn it over, and examine with a lens the under side.\r\n\r\nFor eggs, look closely at the twigs in June. Do you see white specks\r\nmoving? If so examine them with a lens.\r\n\r\nAre there any small, prematurely ripe apples on the ground in the\r\norchard? Cut into one of these and look for a \"worm\". Look for apples\r\nwith worm holes in the side. Are there worms in these apples? What is in\r\nthem? Note the dirty marks that the larva has left. Keep several apples\r\nin a close box and watch for the \"worms\" to come out. Examine the bark\r\nof apple trees for pupae in the fall.\r\n\r\nFREQUENCY OF EXCURSIONS\r\n\r\nAs to the frequency of excursions, the teacher will be the best judge.\r\nIt is desirable that they occur naturally in the course of the Nature\r\nStudy work as the need for them arises. One short trip each week with a\r\nsingle object in view is much more satisfactory than a whole afternoon\r\neach term spent in aimless wandering about the woods.\r\n\r\nEXCURSIONS TO A DISTANCE\r\n\r\nLong-distance excursions will of necessity be infrequent. If the woods\r\nare far away, one such trip in May or June would prove valuable to\r\nenable the pupils to become acquainted with wild flowers, and another in\r\nOctober to gather tree seeds, autumn leaves, pupae, and other material\r\nfor winter study. When a large class is to be taken on an excursion,\r\npreparations must be made with special care. The teacher and one or two\r\nassistants should go over the ground beforehand and arrange for the work\r\nto be done. Some work must be given to every pupil, and prompt obedience\r\nto every command and signal must be required. The class, for example,\r\nmay decide to search a small wood or meadow to find out what flowers are\r\nthere. The pupils should be dispersed throughout the field to hunt for\r\nspecimens and to meet at a known signal to compare notes.\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS FOR UNGRADED SCHOOLS\r\n\r\n1. The teacher may take all the classes, choosing an object of study\r\nfrom which he can teach lessons suitable to all ages, a bird's nest, for\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n2. In many sections, the little ones are dismissed at 3.30 p.m.\r\nOpportunity is thus given for an excursion with the seniors.\r\n\r\n3. The older pupils may be assigned work and left in charge of a\r\nmonitor, elected by themselves, who shall be responsible for their\r\nconduct, while the teacher is working outside with the lower Forms.\r\n\r\n4. Boys who are naturally interested in outdoor work should be\r\nencouraged to show the others anything of interest they may have found.\r\n\r\n5. An occasional Saturday excursion may be arranged.\r\n\r\n~Discipline.~--The teacher should insist on making the excursion a serious\r\npart of the school work, not merely recreation. School-room behaviour\r\ncannot be expected, but the boisterous conduct of the playground should\r\ngive place to earnest expectancy. The pupils should keep within sound of\r\nthe teacher's voice (a sharp whistle may be used) and should promptly\r\nrespond to every call. Topics of conversations should as far as possible\r\nbe restricted to those pertaining to the object of the excursion or\r\nrelated matters.\r\n\r\nIn visiting woods, children should be trained to study flowers in their\r\nenvironment and leave them there, plucking or digging for none except\r\nfor some excellent reason. The same respect should be shown to birds and\r\ntheir nests, and to insects, and all other living things encountered.\r\n\r\nTHE TEACHER'S EXCURSIONS\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible after coming to a section, the teacher should\r\nacquaint himself with the woods, groves, streams, or other haunts that\r\nmay provide him with material for his indoor or outdoor work. He can\r\nthen direct the pupils effectively. The teacher should go over the route\r\nof an excursion shortly before it takes place. This prevents waste of\r\ntime in looking for the objects that he wishes his pupils to see. If the\r\nteacher wishes to increase his love for nature, he must take many walks\r\nwithout his pupils.\r\n\r\nThe school garden offers a partial solution of the difficulties\r\nmentioned above. It brings a large amount of material to the doors of\r\nthe school. Plants of the farm or the garden may be studied under\r\nvarious changeable conditions, and it will be seen that insect pests,\r\nweeds, and fungous diseases follow the lessons on plants, while lessons\r\non birds and toads follow those on insects. With sections of the garden\r\ndevoted to the cultivation of wild flowers, ferns, and forest trees, the\r\nspecially organized excursion will become less of a necessity, although\r\nit will still continue to be a valuable factor in Nature Study work.\r\n\r\nAfter an excursion is over, it should be discussed in class. The various\r\nfacts learned should be reviewed and related. If any pupils have made\r\ninaccurate observations, they should be required to observe again to\r\ncorrect their errors. Finally, the excursion may form the subject of a\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nA TYPE EXCURSION\r\n\r\n~A Bird's Nest.~--The children have been instructed to study the\r\nmeadow-lark, beginning about March twenty-first. While engaged in this\r\nwork, a nest is discovered near the school. The teacher is informed and\r\nthe pupils are conducted to the spot.\r\n\r\nWhat is growing in the field? Is there a long or a short growth? Did the\r\nmother bird make much noise as she rose from the nest? Did this help to\r\nreveal its presence? Is the nest easy to see? The class will halt a few\r\npaces from it and try to find it. How many eggs? Their colour? Note the\r\narch of grass so beautifully concealing the nest.\r\n\r\nReturning to school, the facts observed are reviewed. The pupils may\r\nthen express themselves by written composition or by drawings,\r\npaintings, or modellings of the nest, the eggs, or the surroundings.\r\nFrequent visits to the nest should not be made, and the pupils should be\r\nwarned not to disturb the bird, as she may desert the nest on slight\r\nprovocation.\r\n\r\nA second excursion may be made, when the eggs are hatched, to see the\r\nyoung birds.\r\n\r\n~A Wasp's Nest.~--A nest having been discovered, the pupils note how it is\r\nsuspended and how it is situated with regard to concealment or to\r\nprotection from rain, its colour, the material of the nest, and the\r\nposition of the entrance. Is the opening ever deserted? How many wasps\r\nenter and how many leave the nest in a minute? Try to follow one and\r\nwatch what he does. Wasps may be found biting wood from an old board\r\nfence. This they chew into pulp, and from this pulp their paper is made.\r\nGet the children to verify this by observations. If the nest is likely\r\nto become a nuisance, smoke out the wasps, take the nest carefully down,\r\nand use it for indoor study, examining the inside of the nest to\r\nascertain the nature and the structure of the comb which, in this case\r\nis entirely devoted to larvae.\r\n\r\nCOLLECTIONS\r\n\r\nGeneral school collections of such objects as noxious weeds, weed seeds,\r\nwild flowers, noxious insects, leaves of forest trees, rocks or stones\r\nof the locality, etc., should be undertaken.\r\n\r\nAll the pupils should contribute as many specimens as possible to each\r\ncollection and should assist in the work of preparing them.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above collections it is advisable that pupils who\r\nshow special interest in this phase of nature work should be encouraged\r\nto make individual collections.\r\n\r\nCollections, when properly prepared, have a value within themselves,\r\nbecause of the beauty and variety of the forms that they contain, and\r\nalso because of their usefulness in illustrating nature lessons and in\r\nthe identifying of insects, weeds, etc. Nevertheless the chief value of\r\nthe collection rests in the making of it, because of the training that\r\nit gives the collector in carefulness and thoroughness, and also because\r\nit causes the child to study natural objects in their natural\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMAL STUDIES\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC ANIMALS\r\n\r\nThe teacher, before attempting to teach lessons on domestic animals,\r\nshould carefully consider how his lessons will best fulfil the following\r\nimportant aims:\r\n\r\n1. The cultivation of a deeper sympathy for, and a more complete\r\nunderstanding of, farm animals.\r\n\r\n2. The development of more kindly treatment of domestic animals through\r\nawakened sympathy and more intelligent understanding.\r\n\r\n3. Implanting the idea that the best varieties are the most interesting\r\nand profitable.\r\n\r\nThe following domestic animals are suggested as being suitable for\r\nstudy: horse, cow, sheep, dog, cat, goose, duck, hen.\r\n\r\nThere are two practical methods of observation work; namely, home\r\nobservation and class-room observation.\r\n\r\nThe observation work on some of the animals named must of necessity be\r\ndone out of school. In this the teacher can direct the efforts of the\r\npupils by assigning to them definite problems to be solved by their\r\nstudy of the animals.\r\n\r\nThe results of their observations can be discussed in the class in\r\nlessons of ten or fifteen minutes length. It may frequently be necessary\r\nto re-assign the problems in order that the pupils may correct their\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nIt is possible for the teacher or the pupils to bring to the school-room\r\ncertain of the animals, as the dog, cat, duck, hen, and the observations\r\nmay then be made by the whole class directly under the guidance of the\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nCrawford: _Guide to Nature Study._ Copp Clark Co., 90 cents.\r\n\r\nDearness: _How to Teach the Nature Study Course._ Copp Clark Co., 60\r\ncents.\r\n\r\nShaler: _Domesticated Animals._ Scribners, $2.50.\r\n\r\nSmith: _The Uses and Abuses of Domestic Animals._ Jarrold & Sons, 50\r\ncents.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRDS\r\n\r\nThe chief aims in developing lessons on birds are:\r\n\r\n1. To teach the children to recognize their bird neighbours, to love\r\nthem for their beauty, and sweet songs, and their sprightly ways.\r\n\r\n2. To train the pupils to appreciate them for their usefulness in\r\ndestroying insect pests.\r\n\r\nMany persons spend their lives surrounded by singing birds, yet they\r\nnever hear their songs. Many children see and hear the birds, but if\r\nthey have not been brought into sympathetic relation with them, they\r\nnever learn to appreciate them; on the contrary, their attitude becomes\r\none of indifference or of destructiveness. Too often, boys cruelly\r\ndestroy the nests and young and persecute the old birds with stone and\r\ncatapult. The cowardice of such acts should be condemned, but more\r\neffective lessons may be taught through leading the children to find in\r\nthe birds assistants and companions that contribute to their material\r\nprogress and to their joy in life.\r\n\r\nWith these aims in view, the teacher will readily perceive that the most\r\neffective work in bird study results from observing the living birds in\r\ntheir natural environment. Field excursions are valuable for this, but\r\ngood results can seldom be attained when the class is large, for birds\r\nare shy and will hide or fly away from the unusual excitement. Quietness\r\nis absolutely necessary for success. Better results are obtained when\r\nonly one or two accompany the teacher. If the teacher selects a few who\r\nare interested in birds, and there are always some pupils in every\r\nschool who are readily interested in bird study, these few can soon be\r\nmade sufficiently acquainted with the more common birds, so that they\r\nwill be able to point them out to the other pupils of the school, and\r\nthus they become the teacher's assistants in the work.\r\n\r\nBy beginning with the most common and conspicuous birds, an acquaintance\r\ngrows rapidly. Early spring is a good time to begin, when the first\r\nbirds return from their winter sojourn. The teacher and pupils may now\r\nlearn to recognize the birds, because there are only a few, and these\r\nare easily seen, as the robin, blue-bird, junco, meadow-lark, goldfinch,\r\nbronzed grackle, sapsucker, blue jay, downy woodpecker, and flicker.\r\n\r\nThe teacher, assisted by the pupils who already know these birds,\r\ndirects the younger pupils to where these birds may be seen, and they\r\nare also required to describe the birds observed and to identify them by\r\nmeans of the bird chart or colour key.\r\n\r\nThe description should include:\r\n\r\nSize (compare with some common bird); shape; colour of head, back, and\r\nbreast; conspicuous markings, as crest, stripes, bright patches of\r\nfeathers; movements in flight or on the ground; song, call notes;\r\nwhether in flocks, or pairs, or single birds.\r\n\r\nLater in spring, other birds will attract attention, as the\r\nsong-sparrow, phoebe, wren, horned lark, cowbird, and red-winged\r\nblackbird; while in summer the oriole, catbird, vesper sparrow, American\r\nredstart, night hawk, scarlet tanager, and crested flycatcher are some\r\nof the birds that will call for attention, because of their plumage,\r\nsongs, or peculiar habits.\r\n\r\nWhen a nest has been found by a pupil, he should report it to the\r\nteacher, and the other pupils should be permitted to visit it only upon\r\npromising not to molest the nest or to annoy the mother bird by\r\nremaining too long near it. While it is well that the pupils should see\r\nthe nest with the young birds, they should be taught to respect the\r\ndesire of the bird for quietness and seclusion.\r\n\r\nIn studying the nest, observe: Concealment, protection, size, comfort,\r\nnumber and colour of eggs, young birds, size, colour, covering, food.\r\nThe pupils should be asked to observe the feeding of birds thus:\r\n\r\nWatch the wrens returning to the nest; what do they carry to their\r\nyoung? Where do the wrens get the snails and grubs? Observe how the\r\nrobins find the worms and how they pull them out of the ground. Follow\r\nthe downy woodpecker to the apple tree and find out what he was pecking.\r\nWatch the crow in the pasture field and learn whether this bird kills\r\ngrasshoppers and crickets.\r\n\r\nObserve the birds that pick seeds out of the weeds.\r\n\r\nCollecting birds' eggs should be condemned, because it nearly always\r\nleads to the robbing of the nests. The practice of exchanging eggs is\r\nthe chief cause of this; for although an occasional boy will collect\r\nwisely, the greater number are simply anxious to add to their collection\r\nwithout regard for the sacredness of the birds' homes.\r\n\r\nA collection of birds' nests may be made after the nests have been\r\nabandoned for the season, and it will be found useful for interesting\r\nthe pupils in the ingenuity, neatness, and instinctive foresight of the\r\nbuilders.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nChapman and Reed: _Colour Key to North American Birds_ $2.75\r\n\r\nReed: _Bird Guide, Pts.

The successful growing of farm, orchard, and\r\ngarden crops practically depends upon keeping a proper balance of insect\r\nand bird life.\r\n\r\nThe teacher who feels that his knowledge of insects is too limited to\r\nallow him to undertake the teaching of this branch of Nature Study\r\nshould cast his misgivings aside; for it is not difficult for the\r\nteacher who knows nothing about insects at the outset to become\r\nacquainted with such members of the three classes named above as attract\r\nthe attention of the pupils of the Nature Study classes.\r\n\r\nThe following suggestions in insect study are offered as guides to\r\nteacher or pupil:\r\n\r\nObtain books and pamphlets from the Department of Agriculture, Toronto,\r\non the subject of Insect Pests on Farm Crops and Fruit Trees.\r\n\r\nSecure a good general book on insects. _Modern Nature Study_, by Silcox\r\nand Stevenson, contains illustrations of several of the most common\r\nmoths and butterflies, which are clear enough to make possible the\r\nidentification of the forms represented. Comstock's _Manual for the\r\nStudy of Insects_ is the best general book on the subject. This, and\r\nHolland's _The Moth Book_ and _The Butterfly Book_, are valuable for\r\nthose who wish to follow the study of insects at any length.\r\n\r\nBegin by studying the more conspicuous moths, butterflies, and beetles,\r\nand especially by studying the injurious forms which thrust themselves\r\ninto prominence by causing destruction of grain, vegetable, or fruit\r\ncrops in the locality. The utility phase of lessons on these insects\r\nwill appeal to the older children and also to their parents. Moreover,\r\nthese are the easiest insects to identify and upon which to obtain\r\nliterature dealing with their life histories and habits.\r\n\r\nCarefully observe the colour, size, and shape of the insect, and note\r\nthe plant on which it is feeding and its manner of feeding. Consult\r\navailable books on plant pests to find descriptions of the insects that\r\nfeed upon this plant, and study carefully what is said about the insect\r\nobserved. If this method is persistently followed, the teacher will be\r\nsurprised at the rapidity with which his acquaintance with insects\r\nbroadens.\r\n\r\nPictures of moths, butterflies, and beetles are of great assistance in\r\nthe identification of these insects.\r\n\r\nA school collection, made from the insects studied, is useful for future\r\ncollection and for identification of insects. Do not allow any insect to\r\nbe killed unless it is a good specimen intended to fill a place in the\r\ncollection, or unless it is known to be an injurious insect. The\r\nteacher, by exercising proper control of the collecting, has an\r\nefficient means of teaching the sacredness of life. The fact should be\r\nemphasized that killing even an insect, when there is no good reason for\r\ndoing so, is the act of a mean and selfish coward.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a collection of insects, including larval and pupal\r\nforms, collections of insect nests, of plant galls, of markings of\r\nengraver beetles, of burrows of tree borers, and of samples of the\r\ndestructive workings of insect pests should be made.\r\n\r\nWhile nothing is more beautiful than a carefully prepared collection of\r\nmoths, butterflies, and beetles with their infinite variety of form and\r\ncolour, nothing is more disgusting than a badly preserved collection of\r\ndistorted, shrivelled, vermin-infested specimens. The teacher should\r\navail himself of the collecting instinct which is prominent in boys of\r\nnine to fourteen years of age and of their desire to have things done\r\nwell, to develop in them habits of carefulness, neatness, and\r\nthoroughness.\r\n\r\nINSECT COLLECTIONS\r\n\r\nSee Manual on _Manual Training_, for details for making collecting\r\nappliances.\r\n\r\nAgricultural Bulletin No. 8, _Nature Collections for Schools_,\r\nDepartment of Education, Ontario, for detailed instructions on making\r\ninsect collections.\r\n\r\nThe outfit for collecting is neither expensive nor hard to prepare. It\r\nconsists of (1) an insect net for catching the insects, made by sewing a\r\nbag of cheese-cloth to a stout ring one foot in diameter, which is\r\nfastened to a broom handle; (2) a cyanide bottle for killing the\r\ninsects, prepared by pouring some soft plaster-paris over a few lumps of\r\npotassium cyanide (three pieces, each of the size of a pea) in a\r\nwide-mouthed bottle. When the plaster has set, keep the bottle tightly\r\ncorked to retain the poisonous gases. (3) Pins to mount the specimens.\r\nEntomological pins, Nos. 2, 3, and 4, are the best for general use.\r\nBeetles are usually pinned through the right wing-cover at about one\r\nfourth of its length from the front end of it. Moths and butterflies are\r\npinned through the thorax. Small insects may be fastened to a very small\r\npin, which in turn is set into a bit of cork, supported by a pin of\r\nordinary size. (4) Spreading board for moths and butterflies. (5) Insect\r\nboxes to hold the specimens. This should be secured before the\r\ncollection is begun. It is a common mistake to believe that any box\r\nwhatever will do for storing insects. It is necessary to encourage\r\neffort in drying, spreading, pinning, and labelling, by providing an\r\neffective means of permanently preserving the specimens. In cigar-boxes,\r\npasteboard boxes, and such makeshifts, the specimens soon become broken,\r\ncovered with dust, and marred in other ways, and the collectors become\r\ndiscouraged; hence it is necessary to secure good boxes from dealers in\r\nentomological supplies.\r\n\r\nA sponge saturated with carbon bisulphide should be placed in the box at\r\nintervals of not more than three months, to ensure the killing of\r\nparasites that destroy the specimens.\r\n\r\nEntomological supplies may be obtained from Chapman & Co., London, Ont.,\r\nor from G. M. Hendry Co., Toronto, Ont., or from Messrs. Watters Bros.,\r\nGuelph, Ont.\r\n\r\nBUTTERFLY AND MOTH COLLECTIONS\r\n\r\nFor a study of the metamorphosis of butterflies and moths, it is\r\nnecessary to have an insect cage. This can be purchased from any dealer\r\nin entomological supplies or it may be made by the pupils in the Manual\r\nTraining Class. See Manual on _Manual Training_. A very satisfactory\r\ncage may be made, by the teacher or larger pupils, from a soap box, by\r\ntacking wire gauze over the open surface of the box, removing the nails\r\nfrom one of the boards of the bottom, and converting this board into a\r\ndoor by attaching it in its former position by light hinges and a hook\r\nand staple. The box, if now placed on end with two inches of loose soil\r\nin the bottom, will constitute a satisfactory insect cage, or vivarium.\r\n\r\nA large lamp chimney with gauze tied over the upper end is useful for\r\ninclosing a small plant upon which eggs or insect larvae are developing.\r\nThe base of the chimney may be thrust an inch into the soil and the\r\ndevelopment of the larva as it feeds upon the growing plant can be\r\nstudied.\r\n\r\nThe following are larvae suitable for study and may be found in the\r\nplaces named:\r\n\r\nThe tomato worm on tomato or tobacco plants. (Look for stems whose\r\nleaves have been stripped off.)\r\n\r\nThe milkweed butterfly larvae on milkweed,\r\n\r\nThe potato beetle on potato vines,\r\n\r\nThe eastern swallow-tail butterfly on parsnip or carrot plants,\r\n\r\nThe tussock-moth on horse-chestnuts,\r\n\r\nThe promothea moth on lilac bushes,\r\n\r\nThe cabbage-butterfly on cabbage or mustard plants,\r\n\r\nThe red-spotted purple, banded purple, and viceroy butterfly larvae on\r\nwillow and alder,\r\n\r\nCocoons of tussock-moth and tiger-moth under bark, logs, and rubbish in\r\nearly autumn.\r\n\r\nLarvae of the emperor-moth (cecropia) may be found wandering about,\r\napparently aimlessly, in September; but they are searching for suitable\r\nplaces for attaching their cocoons to orchard and forest trees.\r\n\r\nAfter the leaves have fallen from shrubs and trees, cocoons can be found\r\nmore easily on the naked twigs or in withered, rolled-up leaves that are\r\nfastened by the silk of the cocoon to the branches.\r\n\r\nLarvae, when placed in the cage, should be supplied with green plant food\r\nsuch as they were found feeding upon, and the pupils should be\r\ninstructed to observe the chrysalis building or the cocoon weaving. It\r\nwill be found that some larvae burrow into the soil.\r\n\r\nDuring winter the cage should be kept in a cool place, such as a shed,\r\nso that the winter conditions may be as nearly natural as possible.\r\n\r\nIn a few cases, the development within the cocoon is quite rapid; and\r\nthe adult form hatches out in a few weeks, for example, the\r\ncabbage-butterfly, monarch or milkweed butterfly, and tussock-moth. For\r\nthis reason these are preferable for study by Form I pupils. In April\r\nthe cage should be placed in the school-room, that the pupils may\r\nobserve the emergence of the insects and the spreading of the wings. The\r\ninsects can be fed with syrup or honey until they are strong, then the\r\npupils should set them free.\r\n\r\nReference.--_Reports of the Entomological Society of Ontario_,\r\nDepartment of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANT COLLECTIONS\r\n\r\nThe instructions given below for collecting, pressing, and mounting\r\nplants are applicable to wild flowers, grains, grasses, and weeds.\r\n\r\n~The specimen.~--Select a plant which in form and size is typical of its\r\nspecies and which is in full flower. Care must be taken to dig down and\r\nsecure the root.\r\n\r\nIf the plant is too large for the mounting sheet, cut out the central\r\npart, and use the root, lower leaves, upper leaves, and flower. If the\r\nroot is very thick, cut slices lengthwise off the sides so as to reduce\r\nit to a flat form that is not too bulky.\r\n\r\nBefore the plant has had time to wither, spread it out flat on a sheet\r\nof paper and spread another sheet over it, taking care to straighten the\r\nleaves and flower out. Blotting-paper is preferable, but any soft paper\r\nthat will absorb moisture will make a very good substitute.\r\n\r\n~Pressing and drying.~--Place several sheets of paper above and below the\r\nspecimen. Any number of specimens prepared as described in the last\r\nparagraph may be placed in a pile, one over another, resting on the\r\nfloor or on a table. Place on top of the pile a board which is large\r\nenough to cover the surface of the pile, and on the board place a weight\r\nof about fifteen pounds of bricks, or other convenient material. A box\r\ncontaining sand, stones, or coal may be used in place of the board and\r\nweights. The weight prevents the shrivelling and distortion of the\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nTo prevent discoloration and mildewing of the plants, the papers around\r\nthem must be changed at the end of the following successive intervals:\r\ntwo days, three days, five days, one week, etc., until they are quite\r\ndry. The length of time required for pressing and drying depends upon\r\nthe quantity of sap in the plants and also upon the dryness or humidity\r\nof the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n~Mounting.~--When dry, the specimens are mounted on sheets of heavy white\r\npaper. These sheets are cut to a standard size, eleven inches by\r\nfourteen inches, or sheets of half this size, namely, seven inches by\r\neleven inches; are permissible. The best method of attaching the plant\r\nto the sheet is by pasting narrow strips of gummed paper across the\r\nplant in such positions as will serve to hold all parts of it in\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n~Labelling.~--The name of the specimen, the date of collection, the place\r\nfrom which collected, and the name of the collector are to be neatly\r\nwritten in a column in the lower right-hand corner of the sheet. Printed\r\nlabels which are pasted on this corner of the sheet are also used.\r\n\r\nCollections of leaves may be prepared by the same process as that given\r\nfor plants. Leaves will retain their autumn tints if their surface is\r\ncovered with varnish or paraffin, which will prevent the admission of\r\nair.\r\n\r\nTo cover with paraffin dip the leaf for a moment into melted paraffin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL SCIENCE PHASE OF NATURE STUDY\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS AND GENERAL METHOD\r\n\r\nThe preceding portions of this Manual dealt with living things. There is\r\nanother phase of Nature Study which has a more direct relation to the\r\nphysical sciences, Chemistry and Physics, two subjects that are\r\nessentially experimental in their methods.\r\n\r\nAlthough the lessons that follow are grouped in one portion of this\r\nbook, the teacher should understand that he is to introduce them into\r\nhis work as the occasion demands. They may be used to throw light on\r\nother parts of the school work. The experimental method is somewhat\r\nadvanced for young children, hence no lessons are outlined for Forms I\r\nand II. In ungraded schools, Forms III and IV may be combined for the\r\nsubject. It will be found most convenient to take this portion of the\r\nNature Study during the winter months.\r\n\r\nVALUE OF SUCH LESSONS\r\n\r\n1. They are _interesting_, hence there is attention. The senses must be\r\nalert, hence pupils are trained to observe accurately.\r\n\r\n2. After the experiment comes the inference, hence reasoning powers are\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n3. They enable the teacher to make exceedingly _concrete_ some very\r\ndifficult abstract principles.\r\n\r\n4. They can be _correlated_ with a large number of other subjects and\r\nmade to have a beneficial influence on the whole of the school work.\r\n\r\n5. The great advance that is being made in all useful inventions to-day\r\nis largely due to the study of the physical sciences. Many boys and\r\ngirls (seventy-five per cent.) never attend the High School. The\r\nElementary School owes them a taste at least of these sciences that have\r\nsuch a bearing on their lives, that have surrounded them with so many\r\nmechanical contrivances for their comfort and convenience, and that\r\nexplain so many common natural phenomena. Give a boy a taste for\r\nexperimental science, and there is some chance that after leaving school\r\nhe will not throw aside his studies to subsist intellectually on the\r\nnewspaper, but that he will continue to investigate for himself, and\r\nmake himself a well-informed man, an influential man in his section. The\r\nElementary School must aim at fitting the boys and girls for life.\r\n\r\n6. The advent of the experiment marks the downfall of superstition,\r\nprejudice, and reliance on authority and tradition. To lead a child to\r\nthink for himself is a great achievement.\r\n\r\n7. The use of the experiment in gaining knowledge will result in a\r\ncautiousness in accepting statements and making decisions.\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS UNDER WHICH EXPERIMENTS SHOULD BE PERFORMED\r\n\r\n1. They should be introduced into the school work naturally, as answers\r\nto questions which arise either in the regular course of the work or\r\nfrom suggestions made by the teacher at appropriate times.\r\n\r\n2. As far as possible, the pupils should assist in performing the\r\nexperiment. In small rural schools the scarcity of apparatus will\r\nnecessitate the teacher's doing most of the work. In Form V classes and\r\nContinuation Schools the pupils may do the experiments individually.\r\n\r\n3. The bearing of an experiment is not always evident; the teacher must\r\nbe ready with judicious questions to lead the class to the proper\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\n4. The pupils must be acquainted with all the apparatus used. They must\r\nknow what the teacher is doing and must be near enough to see the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n5. A problem may be suggested, and a few days allowed for the pupils to\r\nthink out a means of solution. If they invent and make their own\r\napparatus, so much the better.\r\n\r\n6. Whenever possible, the experiment should be applied to some natural\r\nphenomenon or everyday occurrence.\r\n\r\nCORRELATIONS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE PHASE\r\n\r\nGeography.--The value of Physical Science in the Elementary School is\r\nlargely due to the light it throws on geographical data. Numerous\r\nexamples will appear in the succeeding pages.\r\n\r\nHygiene.--Experiments in carbon dioxide, oxygen, air, water, sound, and\r\nlight, are absolutely necessary, if the children are to grasp with any\r\ndegree of clearness the principles of respiration and ventilation, and\r\nthe phenomena of hearing and seeing.\r\n\r\nManual Training.--Many pieces of apparatus may be made by the boys in\r\ntheir work with wood or iron. Some of the elementary principles of\r\nchemistry enable the girls to do their cooking intelligently. A\r\nknowledge of some of the principles of machines will help the pupils to\r\nunderstand the tools they may use in any employment.\r\n\r\nDrawing.--Careful drawing of the apparatus used helps to fix the\r\nexperiment in the mind and at the same time gives practice in art.\r\n\r\nComposition.--Pupils must have ideas before they can write. The\r\ndescription of the experiment will make a good composition exercise,\r\noral or written.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF REFERENCE BOOKS AND BULLETINS\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN AND PLANT STUDY\r\n\r\nBulletins of the Ontario Department of Agriculture, Toronto.\r\n\r\nBulletins of the Dominion Department of Agriculture, Ottawa.\r\n\r\nImprovement of School Grounds.

The more of this the pupils can\r\ncontrive and make under the direction of the teacher, the more valuable\r\nwill be the course in Physical Science.\r\n\r\nGRENET CELLS\r\n\r\nInto a pint gem-jar put water 10 parts, sulphuric acid 1 part, potass,\r\nbichromate 1 part. Have jar three quarters full. Cut a piece of board 4\r\nin. square, bore two holes in it, and through the holes thrust two\r\npieces of electric light carbon, 5 in. or 6 in. long. The outer edges of\r\nthe carbons should not be more than two inches apart. With a saw, cut a\r\nslit in the board between the holes and insert a strip of zinc 2 in. by\r\n7 in. previously rubbed over with mercury. Set the three elements in the\r\njar, connect the two carbons to one wire, and the zinc to another.\r\n\r\nOne cell of this kind will run a small motor, operate a telegraph\r\nsounder, make a simple electro-magnet, or ring an electric bell; two\r\ncells will decompose water: three will heat a piece of fine iron wire\r\nred-hot.\r\n\r\nDECOMPOSITION APPARATUS\r\n\r\n1. Cut the neck end from a pickle bottle. Get a No. 1 stopper, (rubber)\r\nwith two holes in it and insert a piece of platinum foil 2 in. by 1/8\r\nin. into each hole so that 1/2 in. projects above and below. Insert a\r\ntight plug beside each strip, thus holding it fast and making the\r\nstopper watertight. Insert the stopper into the neck of the jar. Pour\r\ninto the vessel thus formed enough water to cover the platinums, and add\r\na few drops of sulphuric acid. Touch the wires from the battery to the\r\nlower ends of the strips. Note bubbles of gas arise from the platinums.\r\nThese may be collected in test-tubes and found by test to be oxygen and\r\nhydrogen.\r\n\r\n2. Fasten a strip of platinum 1 in. by 1/8 in. to each wire from the\r\nbattery and dip these into some acidulated water contained in a tumbler.\r\nThe decomposition of the water into two gases can be seen, but the gases\r\ncannot be collected so readily as in 1 above. Bits of electric light\r\ncarbon will do instead of platinum if the current is not too weak.\r\n\r\nPNEUMATIC TROUGH\r\n\r\nWhen oxygen or other gas is to be collected over water, use a milk pan\r\nor similarly shaped vessel.\r\n\r\nSPIRIT-LAMP\r\n\r\nUse an ink-bottle to contain the alcohol and several strands of string\r\nfor the wick; make a hole in a piece of tin and draw the wick through;\r\nthen let the tin rest on the neck of the bottle to support the wick.\r\n\r\nBAROMETER\r\n\r\nA siphon barometer takes less mercury than a cistern barometer. To the\r\nopen end of the barometer tube attach a piece of strong rubber tubing 4\r\nin. long and to this a piece of glass tubing 3 in. long. Fill the tube\r\nthus formed with mercury to within 3 in. from the top. Holding the short\r\nglass tube open end up, turn the long tube closed end up. (A tube of 1/8\r\nin. bore needs only one quarter of the mercury required to fill a tube\r\n1/4 in. bore.)\r\n\r\nHYGROMETER\r\n\r\nFor a hygrometer, suspend two dairy thermometers side by side against\r\nthe wall, cover the bulb of one with thin muslin, and let the muslin\r\nhang down and dip into water in some small vessel placed about three\r\ninches below the bulb on a little shelf.\r\n\r\nHINTS\r\n\r\nTo avoid explosions, a spirit-lamp should be kept filled.\r\n\r\nToy rubber balloons answer well for sheet rubber.\r\n\r\nRed ink makes good colouring matter.\r\n\r\nMake touch-paper by soaking any porous paper in a solution of saltpetre,\r\nand drying it.\r\n\r\nInstead of bending glass tubes, join them with rubber tubing.\r\n\r\nTo make a test-tube holder, fold a sheet of paper until it is about half\r\nan inch wide and wrap this around the tube.\r\n\r\nTo bend glass tubing, hold in the flame of the spirit-lamp and rotate\r\nbetween the fingers till it becomes soft and flexible, remove from the\r\nflame, and bend.\r\n\r\nTo break glass tubing, first scratch with a file.\r\n\r\nTo break glass bottles, make neatly a deep cut with a file, then touch\r\nthe glass near the cut with a red-hot wire. When a crack appears, move\r\nthe hot wire and the crack will follow. Several heatings may be\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a heavy glass bottle, file the cut as before, wrap the\r\nbottle with string dipped in alcohol, light it, and after it has burned,\r\nplunge the bottle vertically into cold water.\r\n\r\nMelted paraffin is good for closing small leaks.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME APPORTIONED TO NATURE STUDY\r\n\r\nThe Nature Study lesson should be given a definite place on the\r\ntime-table. It is recommended that each class should have at least one\r\nlesson of fifteen minutes in length, a week. In addition to this, about\r\nfive minutes a week should be spent in assigning problems for\r\nout-of-door work and in discussing the observations which the pupils\r\nhave made on problems previously assigned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nFORM I\r\n\r\nAUTUMN\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN WORK\r\n\r\nOn the re-opening of school after the summer holidays, the pupils should\r\nsee that their plots are put into good order without delay. If they have\r\nbeen neglected during the holidays, a good deal of attention will be\r\nneeded, and in some cases it may not be possible to reclaim them because\r\nof prolonged neglect. If such plots are found, they should be cleaned\r\noff completely, spaded up, and left in readiness for planting the\r\nfollowing spring. All plots should be cultivated throughout the month of\r\nSeptember to keep the soil mellow and prevent the growth of weeds. The\r\npupils should be allowed to pick flowers from their own plots, but\r\nshould always leave a few in bloom for the sake of the general\r\nappearance of the garden. Paths should be kept clean, and all rubbish,\r\nweeds, dead plants, etc., removed to the compost heap, which should be\r\nin the least conspicuous part of the garden. Hoes, rakes, and claw-hand\r\nweeders should be used in cleaning up and cultivating the plots. The\r\nsoil should be kept fine and loose on top to prevent drying out.\r\n\r\nLESSONS ON A GARDEN PLANT\r\n\r\nPANSY\r\n\r\nLESSON I\r\n\r\n~Materials.~--A flower for each pupil\r\n              A plant set into a flower-pot\r\n              A leaf for each pupil\r\n              A pile of leaves containing a few pansy\r\n                leaves and several of other kinds.\r\n\r\n~Introduction.~--A conversation with the pupils about their favourite\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n~Observations.~--The pansy flowers are now distributed and the general\r\nform of the flower is first noted. The resemblance to the face of an\r\nanimal will be discovered. The name _corolla_ is given, but no other\r\nbotanical terms are to be introduced in this lesson.\r\n\r\nThe details of colours, perfumes, velvety feeling of the corolla, and\r\nthe number of leaflets in it are next _discovered_ and described by the\r\n_pupils_. Lastly, in a withering flower they discover the seed cases and\r\nthe little seeds.\r\n\r\nLESSON II\r\n\r\nThe conception of the relationship between the flower, root, and stem is\r\ndeveloped by a method similar to the following:\r\n\r\nWhat soon happens to a pansy flower after it is broken from the plant?\r\nAre the flowers that you have in your hands withering?\r\n\r\nHow can you keep them from withering?\r\n\r\nHence, what must the flower get from the stem?\r\n\r\nWhere does the stem get the moisture?\r\n\r\nHence, what is one use of the root?\r\n\r\nA pupil is asked to pull the plant out of the soil in the flower-pot.\r\nWhat is another use that you have discovered for the root?\r\n\r\nThe plant is now uprooted from the soil, and the pupils examine the root\r\nto find how it is fitted for gathering water and food from the soil and\r\nfor holding the plant in place.\r\n\r\nNote the number of branches touching a great deal of soil and also the\r\ntwisted form of the roots for grasping the soil.\r\n\r\nThe form of the leaves is studied by the pupils, and, as a test of the\r\naccuracy of their observation, they are asked to pick out the pansy\r\nleaves from the pile of leaves.\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--The pupils must be active participants in the lesson.\r\nThey must use their eyes, hands, and even their noses in gaining\r\nfirst-hand impressions, and they are to be required to express in their\r\nown way the things that they discover. The beautiful flower with its\r\nface like that of an animal is an appeal to the child's imagination, and\r\nthe child's interest in the _use_ of things is utilized in the study of\r\nthe relations of root, stem, and flower.\r\n\r\nThis lesson may be used as the basis for busy work by means of the\r\nfollowing correlations:\r\n\r\n1. With art:\r\n\r\nRepresent the flower in colours.\r\n\r\n2. With reading and literature:\r\n\r\nThe pupils are required to express the meaning and sentiment of the\r\nfollowing stanza:\r\n\r\n    The pansy wakes in early spring\r\n      To make our world more bright;\r\n    All summer long its happy face\r\n      Fills children with delight,\r\n\r\nLessons similar to those on the pansy may be based upon the following\r\nplants of the garden or field: dandelion, aster, buttercup, nasturtium,\r\ngoldenrod. The teacher in preparing the lesson should read a description\r\nof the plant from a Nature Study book and should also study the plant\r\nitself until he is familiar with all the phases of its life.\r\n\r\nOBSERVATION EXERCISES ON THE DANDELION\r\n\r\nThe exercises given below are suggestive for out of school observation\r\nwork, but must not be too long. By way of preparation for an exercise of\r\nthis kind, the interest of the pupils in the dandelion must first be\r\naroused.\r\n\r\nFIRST EXERCISE\r\n\r\nThe teacher places the pupils at the school windows from which\r\ndandelions are visible and asks them to name any flower that they can\r\nsee. A short conversation about the brightness of the flower follows.\r\n\r\nThe pupils are next instructed to:\r\n\r\n1. Find dandelions late in the evening, and find out how they prepare to\r\ngo to sleep and how they are tucked in for the night.\r\n\r\n2. Find where the leaves of the dandelion are, and bring a leaf to\r\nschool next morning, and also observe how the leaves are grouped or\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--Dandelion flowers close up in the evening; the green\r\nleaves beneath the head wrap closely around the flowers to form a snug\r\ncovering. The leaves have margins with teeth shaped like those of a\r\nlion, and from this the plant gets its name, for the name is the French\r\n_dent de lion_, which is pronounced very much like the word dandelion.\r\nThe use of the leaf cluster as a system of rain-spouts for guiding the\r\nrain toward the root should be noted.\r\n\r\nSECOND EXERCISE\r\n\r\n1. Why is the dandelion easy to find?\r\n\r\n2. What makes it easy to find even in long grass?\r\n\r\n3. What insect friends visit the dandelion?\r\n\r\n4. Find out just how these visitors act during their visits, and find\r\nwhether they carry anything to or away from the flowers.\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--The bright yellow colour of the dandelion attracts\r\nattention. When it grows in long grass, the flower stalk grows long, so\r\nthat the flower surmounts its obstructions and climbs up to the\r\nsunshine. The flowers are visited by ants, bees, and wasps, and these\r\nmay be seen burrowing into the flowers in search of honey. If their\r\nbodies and legs be touched, the yellow pollen of the flowers will be\r\nfound sticking to them.\r\n\r\nTHIRD EXERCISE\r\n\r\n1. Look for flower heads that do not open to the sun. Do not disturb\r\nthem, but watch them for a few days and find out what they become.\r\n\r\n2. Examine the large white balls of the dandelions and find out what\r\nthey are.\r\n\r\n3. Blow the down away. What does it carry with it?\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--In this exercise the pupils will learn that the large\r\nwhite balls are the mature, or ripened, flowers and are composed of\r\nlittle brown seeds, each being a little airship for wafting it away.\r\n\r\nCORRELATION WITH LITERATURE AND READING\r\n\r\nWhen the above exercises have been completed, the pupil's knowledge of\r\nthe dandelion may be utilized in interpreting the following stanzas:\r\n\r\n    Oh dandelion! yellow as gold,\r\n      What do you do all day?\r\n    I just wait here in the tall green grass\r\n      Till the children come to play.\r\n\r\n    And what do you do when your hair is white\r\n      And the children come to play?\r\n    They take me up in their dimpled hands\r\n      And blow my hair away.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the dandelion, the following plants are suitable for\r\nobservation exercises: morning-glory, wild balsam, sweet-pea,\r\nsnap-dragon, nasturtium.\r\n\r\nDWARF NASTURTIUM\r\n\r\n~Observations.~--The size of the plant at the time of flowering; its\r\nleaves--size, colour, shape, length of petiole and how arranged; colours\r\nfound in the flower, comparison with others of same species found in the\r\ngarden; size and shape of the flower and the length of its stems. Do the\r\nflowers grow higher than the leaves? Do they look better when with the\r\nleaves or when alone? Note the perfume and taste of the flower stem, the\r\ninsect visitors, and what part of the flower they tried to get at, when\r\nthe first blossom was seen, and how long the blossoms continued to come\r\nout. Do they keep well in bouquets? Do they stand hot, dry weather as\r\nwell as other flowers? When did the frost kill them? Compare with the\r\nclimbing nasturtium. Find the seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEEDS\r\n\r\nThe autumn months are the best for seed studies, for almost all annuals\r\nare ripening their seeds at this time of year.\r\n\r\nFIELD EXERCISE\r\n\r\nAssign to the pupils the following exercise:\r\n\r\nCollect the seed pods from as many plants of your garden plots, or home\r\ngardens, or wild plants, as possible, and be careful to write the name\r\nof each plant on the paper in which you put the seed pod of that plant.\r\nNotice the part of the plant from which the seed pod is formed.\r\n\r\nCLASS-ROOM LESSON BASED ON THIS COLLECTION\r\n\r\nThe pupils place the seed pods on their desks, and observations and\r\nproblems are dealt with of which the following are representative:\r\n\r\nHow does each seed case open?\r\n\r\nWhat are the seeds for?\r\n\r\nHow many seeds are in each case?\r\n\r\nWhy should a plant have so many seeds?\r\n\r\nHow are the seed cases fitted for protecting the seeds?\r\n\r\nAre any two seeds alike in shape?\r\n\r\nAre the seeds easy to find if they are spilled upon the ground?\r\n\r\nWhat makes them hard to find?\r\n\r\nWhere do nearly all seeds spend the winter?\r\n\r\nOf what use is the hard shell of the seed?\r\n\r\nSEED DISPERSAL\r\n\r\nStudy only a few of the more striking examples of seed dispersal with\r\nthe Form I class. Seeds that fly and seeds that steal rides are good\r\nexamples of classes of seeds whose methods of dispersal will prove of\r\ninterest to children.\r\n\r\nLESSON ON SEEDS THAT FLY\r\n\r\n~Materials.~--A milkweed pod; a ripe dandelion head.\r\n\r\n~Introduction.~--A short conversation about the effects of the crowding of\r\nplants, as carrots and turnips, in a garden plot, and hence the need for\r\nthe scattering of seeds.\r\n\r\n~Observations.~--Open a milkweed pod in the presence of the class, so that\r\nthey may see how the pod opens, how beautifully the seeds are arranged,\r\nand how the silk tufts are so closely packed in together.\r\n\r\nAllow a pupil to lift a seed out, blow it in the air, and observe how\r\nthe silk opens out like an umbrella. Distribute seeds, one to each\r\npupil. Ask the pupils to find out why this little airship is able to\r\ncarry the seed. They will find that the seeds though broad, are thin and\r\nlight, and the silky plumes very light.\r\n\r\nAsk the pupils to release their milkweed seeds at recess, when out of\r\nschool, and find out how far they can fly. This is an interesting\r\nexperiment for a windy day.\r\n\r\nThe white balls of the dandelion are next examined, the tiny seeds are\r\nfound standing on tiptoe on a raised platform, each grasping a tiny\r\nparachute and waiting for a puff of wind to start them off. A pupil is\r\npermitted to give the puff. Seeds are distributed, and the means of\r\nflight is compared with that of the milkweed. The shape of the seeds is\r\nobserved and also the tiny anchor points at the lower end of the seed\r\nfor clutching the ground when the seed alights.\r\n\r\nAnother lesson on seeds that fly can be based on the study of tree\r\nseeds, using those of the maple, elm, basswood, pine, and spruce.\r\n\r\nCORRELATIONS\r\n\r\n1. Drawing of milkweed pods and seeds, and drawing of the dandelion\r\nseed-ball and the seeds when floating in the air.\r\n\r\n2. Reading and literature. Interpret the thought and read expressively:\r\n\r\n    Dainty milkweed babies, wrapped in cradles green,\r\n    Rocked by Mother Nature, fed by hands unseen,\r\n    Brown coats have the darlings, slips of milky white,\r\n    And wings, but that's a secret, they're folded out of sight.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWIGS AND BUDS\r\n\r\nThe study of buds is a part of tree study and may be taken as\r\nobservation work in the class-room. This somewhat detailed study should\r\nfollow the general lessons on tree study.\r\n\r\nThe materials for the lessons may be collected by the pupils at the time\r\nof the field lesson and kept fresh in a jar of water until required for\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nLESSON ON TWIGS\r\n\r\n~Materials.~--A twig of horse-chestnut about six inches long, for each\r\npupil.\r\n\r\nA twig of the same tree with the leaves still on it.\r\n\r\n~Observations.~--The twigs are distributed and the teacher asks the pupils\r\nto examine them and to describe all marks and projections that can be\r\nfound on the twig.\r\n\r\nAnswers are required from the pupils separately. The pupil's answer in\r\neach case should be sufficiently clear for all the class to recognize\r\nthe feature that the answer is intended to describe. A few brief\r\nquestions will guide the answerer in making his description more\r\ndefinite, but the description should be the result of the pupil's\r\nobservation and expressed in his own words.\r\n\r\nThe meaning or use of each feature should be discussed, when possible,\r\nimmediately after it has been described.\r\n\r\nThe following features will be discovered and the problems suggested\r\nwill be solved:\r\n\r\nThe brown or greenish-brown bark.\r\n\r\nThe buds.\r\n\r\nOne bud (sometimes two) is at the end of the twig.\r\n\r\nSome buds are along the side of the twig.\r\n\r\nWhat caused the end bud to grow larger than the others?\r\n\r\nThere is a leaf scar under each bud.\r\n\r\nOf what use is it to the bud to be between the twig and the leaf stalk?\r\n\r\nThe bands of rings, one or more on each twig.\r\n\r\nThe tiny oval pores, each surrounded by a little raised band.\r\n\r\nThe detailed study of the buds is left for a separate lesson.\r\n\r\nFURTHER STUDY OF TWIGS\r\n\r\nThe study in detail of various features is illustrated in the following:\r\n\r\nLook closely at the leaf scars and describe them fully, as to shape,\r\ncolour, and marks.\r\n\r\nDo the scars look like fresh wounds, or are they healed over? Of what\r\nuse to the tree is the healing of the scar?\r\n\r\nWe will learn later that the part of the twig between each pair of bands\r\nof rings represents one year's growth. How old is your twig? Who has the\r\noldest twig?\r\n\r\nDo all twigs grow at the same rate?\r\n\r\nWho has the twig that had the most rapid growth?\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--The bud at the end of the twig or its branches is\r\ncalled the end bud; there are two leaf scars underneath it. The buds\r\nalong the sides of the stem are called side buds, the latter are smaller\r\nthan the end bud. The bud situated between the stem of the leaf and the\r\ntwig is in a sheltered position. This position also puts the bud close\r\nto the pantry door, for the plant food is prepared in the leaf. The leaf\r\nscars are yellowish-brown, or if they are the scars from the leaves of\r\nformer years, are dark brown in colour. Each scar is shaped like a\r\nhorse-shoe and tiny dots are found in the position that the horse-shoe\r\nnails would have. Even before the leaf falls, a layer of corklike\r\nsubstance has formed over the scar. This layer is a protection against\r\nthe entrance of frost and rain and germs of fungi and it also prevents\r\nthe loss of sap from the scar. The tiny oval pores, each as large as the\r\npoint of a needle, are the breathing pores of the twig. The bands of\r\nrings are the scars of the scales of the end buds of successive years.\r\nThis latter fact can be discovered when the bud is opening.\r\n\r\nREVIEW LESSON\r\n\r\nThe review lesson should consist of a review of the points taken up in\r\nthe lessons that were based on the horse-chestnut twig, supplemented by\r\nthe examination of the twigs of elm, apple, or lilac.\r\n\r\nLESSON ON BUDS\r\n\r\n~Materials.~--Twigs and buds of horse-chestnut, one for each pupil. An\r\nopening bud. (A bud or a twig placed in water in a warm room will\r\ndevelop rapidly.)\r\n\r\n~Lesson.~--Distribute specimens, and review the positions of the buds.\r\n\r\nPupils examine the buds and tell all they can about them. They describe\r\nthe colour, shape, and size of the buds, and also their gummy and\r\nscalelike covering.\r\n\r\nOf what use are the gum and scales? Of what use is the brown colour of\r\nthe bud?\r\n\r\nThey next find out what is inside the little brown house. They open the\r\nbuds and try to identify the contents. There will be some uncertainty as\r\nto the meaning of the contents. Leave this over till spring.\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--The brown colour of the bud makes it an absorbent of\r\nsunlight, and also serves as a protection from observation by the sharp\r\neyes of bud-eating birds. The gummy scales are waterproof, and the\r\nscales, by spreading open gradually, cause the waterproof property to be\r\nretained even after the bud has grown quite large. The inner part of the\r\nbud is composed of two, four, or six tiny leaves folded up and supported\r\non a short bit of stem. Some of the buds have, in addition to leaves, a\r\ntiny young flower cluster. All of these things are densely covered with\r\nwhite down. The down is the fur coat to protect the tender parts from\r\nthe cold.\r\n\r\nREVIEW LESSON\r\n\r\nReview the lesson on buds, but substitute buds of the lilac or apple for\r\nthe horse-chestnut buds of the original lesson.\r\n\r\nCORRELATIONS\r\n\r\nThe observational study of the buds and twigs is a good preparation for\r\nbusy work in art and manual training, and the pupils may be assigned\r\nexercises, such as charcoal drawing of a horse-chestnut twig, paper\r\ncutting of a lilac twig and buds, clay or plasticine modelling of twigs\r\nand buds.\r\n\r\nFor oral and written language exercises, enlarge the vocabulary of the\r\npupils by requiring sentences containing the words--scales, twigs, buds,\r\nprotection, terminal, lateral, leaf stalk, blade, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEAVES\r\n\r\nLeaves, because of their abundance and the ease with which they may be\r\nobtained, are valuable for Nature Study work. It is possible to arouse\r\nthe interest of even young children in the study of leaves, but care\r\nmust be taken not to make the observation work too minute and the\r\ndescriptions too technical for the primary classes.\r\n\r\nFIELD EXERCISES\r\n\r\nAn excursion to the school grounds or to some neighbouring park will\r\nsuffice to bring the pupils into direct contact with the following\r\nplants: a maple tree, a Boston ivy (or other climbing vine), a\r\nnasturtium, a geranium.\r\n\r\nAsk the pupils to find out where and how leaves are placed on each of\r\nthese plants, that is, whether they are on the inner parts of the\r\nbranches of the tree or out at the ends of the branches. Do the leaves\r\noverlap one another or does each make room for its neighbours? Are the\r\nleaves spread out flat or curled up? What holds the leaves out straight\r\nand flat? What do the leaves need to make them green and healthy?\r\n\r\nAre the leaves placed in the right way, and are they of the right form\r\nto get these things?\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--The leaves of the plants named are quite noticeably\r\nso placed on the plants, have such relations to one another, and are of\r\nsuch outline that they present the greatest possible surface to the\r\n_air_ and _sunshine_ and _rain_. The leaf stalk and midrib and veins are\r\nstiff and strong to keep the leaves spread out. Compare with the ribs of\r\nan umbrella. The benefit of sunshine to leaves and plants can be\r\ndeveloped by discussing with the pupils the paleness and delicateness of\r\nplants that have been kept in a dark place, such as in a dark cellar.\r\nThey are also acquainted with the refreshing effect of rains upon\r\nleaves. The use of air to the leaves is not so easy to develop with\r\npupils of this age, but the use of air for breathing just as boys and\r\ngirls need air for breathing may be told them.\r\n\r\nCLASS-ROOM LESSON ON LEAVES\r\n\r\n~Introduction.~--Tell me all the things that you know upon which leaves\r\ngrow. On trees, bushes, flowers, plants, vegetables, etc.\r\n\r\nAre leaves all of the same shape?\r\n\r\nTo-day we are going to learn the names of some of the shapes of leaves.\r\n\r\n~Observations.~--Show the class the heart-shaped leaf of catalpa or lilac,\r\nand obtain from the pupils the name _heart-shape_. Use the following\r\ntypes:\r\n\r\n    Maple leaf as star-shape,\r\n    Grass or wheat or corn as ribbon-shape,\r\n    Nasturtium or water-lily as shield-shape,\r\n    Ash or rowan, as feather-shape.\r\n\r\n~Drill.~--Pupils pick out the shape named. Pupils name the plant to which\r\neach belongs. Which shape do you think is the prettiest?\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN STUDIES\r\n\r\nIf the pupils of this Form have planted and cared for garden plots of\r\ntheir own, they will have a greater love for the flowers or vegetables\r\nthat grow in them than for any others in the garden, because they have\r\nwatched their development throughout. For them such continuous\r\nobservation cannot but result in a quickening of perception and a\r\ndeepening of interest and appreciation.\r\n\r\nSTUDIES IN THE PUPIL'S INDIVIDUAL PLOT\r\n\r\nWhat plant is the first to appear above ground? What plant is the last\r\nto appear? Describe what each plant was like when it first appeared\r\nabove ground. What plants grow the fastest? What effect has cold\r\nweather, warm weather, dry weather, on the growth of the plants?\r\n\r\nWhat weeds grow in the plot?\r\n\r\nWhy do these weeds obstruct the growth of the other plants?\r\n\r\nWhat kind of root has each weed?\r\n\r\nFind out what kind of seeds each weed produces?\r\n\r\nWhy is each weed hard to keep out of fields?\r\n\r\nWhat garden plants produce flowers?\r\n\r\nHow are the seeds protected?\r\n\r\nCompare the seeds with those that you planted.\r\n\r\nSelect the seeds of the largest plants and finest flowers for next\r\nyear's seeding.\r\n\r\nSTUDIES FROM THE GARDEN AS A WHOLE\r\n\r\nWhat plants grow tallest?\r\n\r\nWhat plants are most suitable for borders?\r\n\r\nWhat plants are valuable for their flowers?\r\n\r\nWhat plants are valuable for their edible roots, for their edible\r\nleaves, for their edible seeds?\r\n\r\nHow are the edible parts stored for winter use?\r\n\r\nCompare the plants that are crowded, with others of the same kind that\r\nare not crowded.\r\n\r\nCompare the rate of growth of the plants in a plot that is kept hoed and\r\nraked with the rate of growth of plants in a neglected plot.\r\n\r\n\r\nBULB PLANTING\r\n\r\nThe planting of bulbs in pots for winter blooming should be commenced\r\nwith pupils in Form I and continued in the higher Forms. As a rule, the\r\npotted bulbs will be stored and cared for in the home, as most\r\nschool-rooms are not heated continuously during the winter. Paper-white\r\nnarcissus and freesia are most suitable and should be planted about the\r\nfifteenth of October, so that the plants will be in bloom for Christmas.\r\n\r\nLESSON ON BULBS AND BULB PLANTING\r\n\r\n~Materials.~--The bulbs to be planted.\r\n\r\nAs many four-inch flower-pots or tomato cans as are required.\r\n\r\nSoil, composed of garden loam, sand, and well-rotted manure in equal\r\nproportions. Stones for drainage.\r\n\r\nSticks for labels (smooth pieces of shingle, one and a half inches wide\r\nand sharpened at one end, will answer).\r\n\r\nPictures of the plants in bloom.\r\n\r\n~Observations.~--The attention of the pupils is directed to the bulbs, and\r\nthey are asked to describe the size, form, and colour of each kind of\r\nbulb.\r\n\r\nA bulb is cut across to make possible the study of the parts, and the\r\npupils observe the scales or rings which are the bases of the leaves of\r\nthe plant from which the bulb grew. The use of the fleshy mass of the\r\nbulb as a store of food for the plant that will grow from it is\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\nThe sprout in the centre of the scales with its yellowish-green tip is\r\nobserved, and its meaning inferred.\r\n\r\nThe picture is shown to illustrate the possibilities within the bulb.\r\n\r\nPLANTING THE BULB\r\n\r\nThe teacher directs, but the work is done by the pupils, and the reasons\r\nfor the following operations are developed:\r\n\r\nWhat is the use of the one-inch layer of pebbles, or broken brick, or\r\nstone, that is placed in the bottom of the pot?\r\n\r\nWhy are the bulbs planted near the top of the soil?\r\n\r\nWhy is the soil packed firmly around the bulbs?\r\n\r\nWhy must the soil be well wetted?\r\n\r\nWhy is the pot set in a cool, dark place for a month or more?\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--The pebbles or broken bricks are for giving drainage.\r\nThe bulbs are planted with their tips just showing above the surface of\r\nthe soil and there is about half an inch of space between the top of the\r\nsoil and the upper edge of the pot in order to facilitate watering. The\r\npotted bulbs must be set in a cool, dark place until they are well\r\nrooted. This is subjecting them to their natural winter conditions, and\r\nit will cause them to yield larger flowers, a great number of flowers,\r\nand flowers that are more lasting. Sand in the soil permits of the more\r\nfree passing of air through the soil. Basements and cellars are usually\r\nsuited for storing bulbs until they have rooted, but they must not be\r\nwarm enough to promote rapid growth. The pots when stored should be\r\ncovered with leaves, sawdust, or coarse sand to prevent drying out. The\r\nsoil must be kept moist, but not wet. Paper-white narcissus, if brought\r\nout of the dark after three or four weeks, will be in bloom at the end\r\nof another month if kept in the window of a warm room. Care must be\r\ntaken not to expose the plants to bright light until they have become\r\ngreen. The bulbs of the white narcissus are to be thrown away after the\r\nflowers have withered, as they will not bloom again, but freesia bulbs\r\nmay be kept and planted again the following year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nFORM I\r\n\r\nWINTER\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSONS ON A PET ANIMAL: THE RABBIT\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe lesson is introduced by a conversation with the pupils about their\r\nvarious pets.\r\n\r\nSince we are to have a rabbit brought to the school we must learn how to\r\ntake care of it, and the proper method of taking care of it is based\r\nupon a knowledge of the habits of the wild rabbit.\r\n\r\nWhere do wild rabbits live?\r\n\r\nWhat sort of home does a rabbit have?\r\n\r\nIn what ways does this home protect the rabbit?\r\n\r\nHence, what kind of home must we have ready for the rabbit?\r\n\r\nWhat does the rabbit eat?\r\n\r\nAre there any of these foods that are not good for its health?\r\n\r\nGive a list of foods that you can bring for the rabbit. Why will the\r\nrabbit, when kept in a hutch, require less food than one that runs\r\nabout?\r\n\r\nSince the rabbit likes a soft bed, what can you bring for its bed?\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n~Observations.~--The teacher or a pupil brings a rabbit to the\r\nschool-room, where, during recreation periods, the pupils make\r\nobservations on topics suggested by the teacher, such as:\r\n\r\nIts choice of food; its timidity; its movements--hopping, squatting,\r\nlistening, scratching, and gnawing.\r\n\r\nThese observations are discussed in the class and are corrected or\r\nverified.\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--Wild rabbits live in the woods or in shrubbery at the\r\nedges of fields. The home of the rabbit is either a burrow under ground\r\nor a sheltered place under a root or log closely concealed among the\r\nbushes. This home is dry and affords a shelter from enemies, and from\r\nwind, rain, and snow. From this we know that we must provide a dry bed\r\nfor our rabbit in a strong box in which it will feel secure, and in\r\nwhich it will be protected from wind and rain. The food of the rabbit\r\nconsists of vegetables and soft young clover and grains. It also gnaws\r\nthe bark of trees, and in winter it feeds upon buds. We can, therefore,\r\nfeed our rabbit on carrots, beets, apples, oats, bran, grass, and leaves\r\nof plants, and we must provide it with some twigs to gnaw, for gnawing\r\nhelps to keep its large chisel-shaped teeth in good condition. We must\r\nbe careful not to give it too much exercise, and we must not give it any\r\ncabbage, because this is not good for the rabbit's health. A dish of\r\nwater must be placed in the hutch, for the rabbit needs water to drink.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nDetails, if studied in isolation, are uninteresting to Form I pupils.\r\nDetailed study should be based upon the animal's habits, movements, and\r\ninstincts, and each detail should be studied as an answer to questions\r\nsuch as: How is the animal able to perform these movements? How is the\r\nanimal fitted for this habit of life, etc.?\r\n\r\nWatch the rabbit moving. How does a rabbit move?\r\n\r\nWhich legs are the more useful for hopping? How are the hind legs fitted\r\nfor making long hops?\r\n\r\nWhy is the rabbit able to defend itself by kicking with its hind feet?\r\nFind out how the rabbit is fitted for burrowing.\r\n\r\nListen carefully and find out whether the rabbit makes much noise while\r\nmoving. Of what advantage is it to the rabbit to move silently?\r\n\r\nFind out, by examining the feet of the rabbit, what causes it to make\r\nvery little noise.\r\n\r\nHow are rabbits prepared for living during cold weather?\r\n\r\nTest the ability of the rabbit to hear faint noises. Why is it necessary\r\nfor the rabbit to be able to hear faint sounds?\r\n\r\nHow is it fitted for hearing faint sounds?\r\n\r\nExamine the teeth and find out how they are fitted for gnawing.\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--The long, strong, hind legs of the rabbit are bent in\r\nthe form of levers and enable the animal to take long, quick hops.\r\n\r\nWhen the rabbit attacks, it frequently defends itself by vigorous kicks\r\nwith its hind feet, which are armed with long, strong claws. Ernest\r\nThompson-Seton's story of Molly Cottontail and \"Raggylug\", in _Wild\r\nAnimals I Have Known_, contains an interesting account of how Molly\r\nrescued Raggy from a snake by this manner of fighting. The rabbit has\r\nmany enemies, hence it has need of large, movable ears to aid its acute\r\nsense of hearing. The thick pads of hair on the soles of its feet enable\r\nit to move noiselessly. The thick, soft, inner hair keeps the animal\r\nwarm, while the longer, stiffer, outer hair sheds the rain.\r\n\r\nImpress upon the pupils the cruelty of rough handling of the rabbit and\r\nof neglecting to provide it with a place for exercise and with a clean,\r\ndry home.\r\n\r\nThe following pet animals may be studied, using the same order and\r\ngeneral method of treatment: pigeon, cat, canary, guinea pig, white\r\nmouse, raccoon, squirrel, parrot.\r\n\r\nIn many cases these animals can be brought to school by the pupils.\r\nEncourage the keeping of pet animals by the pupils, for the best lessons\r\ngrow out of the actual care of the pets. The study of a pet bird may be\r\nconducted along lines similar to the outline given below for the study\r\nof the pigeon.\r\n\r\nCORRELATIONS\r\n\r\nWith literature and reading: Ernest Thompson-Seton's \"Raggylug\".\r\n\r\nWith art: Charcoal drawing representing the rabbit in various attitudes,\r\nas squatting, listening, hopping.\r\n\r\nWith modelling in clay or plasticine.\r\n\r\nWith paper cutting.\r\n\r\nWith language: The vocabulary of the pupils is enlarged by the\r\nintroduction of new words whose meaning is made clear by means of the\r\nconcrete illustration furnished by direct observation of the rabbit.\r\n\r\nThey use these new words in sentences which they form in describing the\r\nrabbit; for example: hutch, gnaw, padded, cleft lip, timid.\r\n\r\nThe rabbit has padded feet so that it can walk without noise. The rabbit\r\nhas a soft bed in its hutch.\r\n\r\nTHE DOMESTIC CAT\r\n\r\nThe following facts are suggested as topics for a first lesson on the\r\ndomestic cat. The teacher can rely upon the pupil's knowledge of the\r\ncat to furnish these statements of fact during a conversation lesson:\r\n\r\nThe cat goes about at night as readily as during the day.\r\n\r\nThe cat can hear faint noises quite readily.\r\n\r\nThe cat can walk noiselessly.\r\n\r\nThe cat creeps along until it is close to its prey, then pounces upon\r\nit, and seizes it with its claws.\r\n\r\nThe cat enjoys attention and purrs if it is stroked gently.\r\n\r\nThe cat likes to sleep in a warm place.\r\n\r\nThe cat can fight viciously with her claws.\r\n\r\nThe cat keeps her fur smooth and clean and her whiskers well brushed\r\nwith her paws.\r\n\r\nThe cat eats birds, mice, rats, meat, fish, milk, bread, and cake.\r\n\r\nDETAILED STUDY\r\n\r\nBase the study of the details upon the facts of habit, movements,\r\ninstincts, etc., which were developed in the preceding lesson.\r\n\r\n~Observations.~--Find out how the cat's feet are fitted for giving a\r\nnoiseless tread.\r\n\r\nFind the claws.\r\n\r\nHow are the claws fitted for seizing prey?\r\n\r\nHow are the claws protected from being made dull by striking against\r\nobjects when the cat is walking?\r\n\r\nTHE PIGEON\r\n\r\nA pigeon is kept in a cage in the school-room and the pupils observe:\r\nits size as compared with that of other birds; outline of body,\r\nincluding shape of head; the feathers, noting quill feathers, and\r\ncovering or contour feathers; manner of feeding and drinking; movements,\r\nas walking, flying, tumbling.\r\n\r\nThe owner or the teacher describes the dove-cot, the necessity of\r\nkeeping it clean, the use of tobacco stems for killing vermin in the\r\nnest, the two white eggs, the habits of male and female in taking turns\r\nin hatching, the parents' habit of half digesting the food in their own\r\ncrops and then pouring it into the crops of the young, the rapid growth\r\nof the young, the next pair of young hatched before the first pair is\r\nfull-fledged.\r\n\r\nDescriptions of the habits of one or more well-known varieties--pouters,\r\nfantails, homing pigeons, etc. Read stories of the training and flights\r\nof homing pigeons, from Ernest Thompson-Seton's _Arnex_.\r\n\r\nMORE DETAILED STUDY FOR CLASS WORK\r\n\r\nCompare the uses of the quill and contour feathers. Find out how these\r\ntwo kinds differ in texture; the differences fitting them for their\r\ndifference in function. The names quill and contour may be replaced by\r\nsome simple names, as feathers for flying and feathers for covering the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nStudy the adaptations for flight, noting the smooth body surface, the\r\noverlapping feathers of the wing for lifting the bird upward as the wing\r\ncomes down, the long wing bones, the strong breast, and the covering of\r\nfeathers giving lightness and warmth. The warmth and lightness of\r\nfeathers is illustrated by the feather boas worn by ladies.\r\n\r\nExamine the feet and find out why pigeons are able to perch on trees.\r\n\r\nExamine the beak, mouth, tongue, nostrils, eyes, ears. How is the bill\r\nadapted for picking up grains and seeds?\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSERVATION AND CARE OF WINTER-BLOOMING PLANTS\r\n\r\nChildren are most interested in things which they own and care for\r\nthemselves. If a child plants a bulb or a slip and succeeds in bringing\r\nit to maturity, it will be to him the most interesting and, at the same\r\ntime, will bring him more into sympathy with plants wherever he may find\r\nthem. The teacher should impress upon the pupil the desirability of\r\nhaving beautiful flowers in the home in winter, when there are none to\r\nbe had out-of-doors.\r\n\r\nEvery pupil should be encouraged to have one plant at least, and the\r\nbulbs planted in October and stored away in the dark in the home cellar\r\nwill require a good deal of care and afford an excellent opportunity for\r\nobserving plant growth and the development of flowers. If the pots have\r\nbeen stored in a cool cellar and have been kept slightly moist, the\r\nbulbs will have made sufficient root growth in a month and should be\r\nbrought up into a warmer room where they can get some sunshine every\r\nday. The pupils will make a report each week as to what changes are\r\nnoticeable in the growing plant. They will note the appearance of pale\r\ngreen shoots, which later develop into leaves and at least one flower\r\nstalk. They should make a drawing once every week and show it to the\r\nteacher, and the teacher should make it a point to see a number of the\r\npupils' plants by calling at their homes. In this way the pupils come to\r\nknow what plants need for their development in the way of soil, water,\r\nlight, and heat. This interest will soon be extended, until, in a very\r\nfew years, the children will add new and beautiful plants to the home\r\ncollection and assume the responsibility of caring for all of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREES\r\n\r\nPINES OF THE LOCALITY\r\n\r\nThis study may be commenced in November after the deciduous trees have\r\nlost their leaves and have entered their quiescent winter period. This\r\nis the time when the evergreens stand out so prominently on the\r\nlandscape in such sharp contrast with the others that have been stripped\r\nof their broad leaves and now look bare and lifeless. If no pines are to\r\nbe found in the vicinity, balsam or spruce may be substituted. The\r\nlessons should, as far as possible, be observational. The pupils should\r\nbe encouraged to make some observations for themselves out of school. At\r\nleast one lesson should be conducted out-of-doors, a suitable pine tree\r\nhaving been selected beforehand for the purpose. The following method\r\nmight serve as a guide in the study of any species of tree.\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE PINE\r\n\r\nFIELD EXERCISES\r\n\r\nHave the pupils observe the shape and height of the tree from a\r\ndistance, tracing the outline with the finger. Compare the shape of this\r\ntree with that of other evergreens and also with that of the\r\nbroad-leafed trees. Have them describe in what particulars the shapes\r\ndiffer in different trees. They will come to realize that the difference\r\nin shape results from difference in length, direction, and arrangement\r\nof branches. They may notice that other evergreen trees resemble the\r\npine in that the stems are all straight and extend as a gradually\r\ntapering shaft from the bottom to the top, that all have a more or less\r\nconical shape, and that the branches grow more or less straight out\r\nfrom the main stem, not slanting off as in the case of the maples and\r\nelms.\r\n\r\nComing close to the tree, the pupils may first examine the trunk. By\r\nusing a string or tape-line, find its diameter and how big it is around.\r\nTell them how big some evergreens are (the giant trees of the Pacific\r\nCoast are sometimes over forty feet around). Have them notice where the\r\ntrunk is largest, and let them find out why a tree needs to be so strong\r\nat the ground. Heavy wind puts a great strain on it just at this point.\r\nIllustrate by taking a long slat or lath, drive it into the ground\r\nfirmly, and then, catching it by the top, push it over. It will break\r\noff just at the ground. If a little pine tree could be taken up, the\r\npupils would be interested in seeing what long, strong, fibrous roots\r\nthe pine has.\r\n\r\nLet them examine the bark of the trunk and describe its colour and\r\nroughness. The fissures in the bark, which are caused by the enlarging\r\nof the tree by the formation of new wood under the bark, are deeper at\r\nthe bottom of the tree than at the top, the tree being younger and the\r\nbark thinner the nearer to the top we go.\r\n\r\nLet the pupils look up into the tree from beneath and then go a little\r\ndistance away and look at it. They will notice how bare the branches are\r\non the inside, and the teacher will probably have to explain why this is\r\nso. They will discover that the leaves are nearly all out toward the\r\nends of the branches as they get light there, while the centre of the\r\ntree top is shaded, and the great question that every tree must try to\r\nsolve is how to get most light for its leaves. The pupils will now see\r\nan additional reason why the lower limbs should be longer than the upper\r\nones. The greater length of the lower limbs brings the leaves out into\r\nthe sunlight.\r\n\r\nThe reason for calling this tree an \"evergreen\" may now be considered.\r\nWhy it retains its leaves all winter is a problem for more advanced\r\nclasses; but if the question is asked, the teacher may get over the\r\ndifficulty by explaining to the class that the leaves are so small, and\r\nyet so hardy, that wind, frost, or snow does not injure them. Each pupil\r\nmay bring a small branch or twig back to the school-room for use in a\r\nclass-room lesson.\r\n\r\nCLASS-ROOM LESSON\r\n\r\n~Materials.~--Small branches--one for each pupil, cones, bark, pieces of\r\npine board.\r\n\r\n~Introduction.~--Review the general features of the pine that were\r\nobserved in the field lesson.\r\n\r\n~Observations.~--The branches are distributed. Pupils test the strength\r\nand suppleness of the branches and find the gummy nature of the surface.\r\n\r\nOf what value are these qualities to the tree during winter storms?\r\n\r\nExamine the texture, stiffness, and fineness of the needles.\r\n\r\nNote that the needles are in little bunches. How many are in each bunch?\r\n\r\nAre there any buds on the branches?\r\n\r\nIf so, where are the buds?\r\n\r\nHow are the buds protected from rain?\r\n\r\nThe pupils examine the cones and describe their general shape.\r\n\r\nThe pupils are asked to break open the tough scales and find the seeds.\r\n\r\nAllow the seeds to fall through the air, and thus the pupils will\r\ndiscover the use of the wings attached to the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe wood is next examined, its colour and odour are noted, and its\r\nhardness is tested.\r\n\r\nFind articles in the school-room that are made of pine wood.\r\n\r\nELM\r\n\r\nThe following topics are suggested for aiding in the selection of matter\r\nfor a lesson on a typical broad-leafed tree:\r\n\r\nThe height of the tree.\r\n\r\nThe part of the height that is composed of tree tops.\r\n\r\nThe umbrella shape or dome shape of the top.\r\n\r\nThe gracefully drooping branches of the outer part of the top.\r\n\r\nTry to find other trees with tops like that of the elm.\r\n\r\nThe diameter of the trunk.\r\n\r\nThe diameter is almost uniform up to the branches.\r\n\r\nThe branches all come off from one point, like the ribs of an umbrella.\r\n\r\nThe thick bark, that of the old trees being marked by deep furrows.\r\n\r\nThe birds that make their nests in the elm.\r\n\r\nIn spring find and examine the flowers, fruits, seeds, and also the\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nFIELD EXERCISE\r\n\r\nA good out-of-door exercise to follow the general lesson outlined above,\r\nis to require the pupils to find all the elm trees or a number of elm\r\ntrees growing in the locality and to describe their location and the\r\nkind of soil on which they grow.\r\n\r\nThe maple, oak, horse-chestnut, and apple are also suitable trees upon\r\nwhich to base lessons for Form I.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC ANIMALS\r\n\r\nDomestic animals not only furnish suitable subjects for observation\r\nwork, but also afford good opportunities for developing that sympathetic\r\ninterest in animal life which will cause the pupils to more nearly\r\nappreciate the useful animals and to treat them more humanely.\r\n\r\nTHE HORSE\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n~Introduction.~--By means of a conversation with the pupils, find out what\r\nthey know about the horse and lead them to think about his proper\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n~Lesson.~--The matter and method are suggested by the following:\r\n\r\nWhat are the different things for which horses are useful?\r\n\r\nWhat kinds of horses are most useful for hauling heavy loads?\r\n\r\nWhy are they most useful?\r\n\r\nWhat kinds are the most useful for general farm work? Why are they the\r\nmost useful?\r\n\r\nWhat kinds are the most useful for driving?\r\n\r\nAre there any other animals that would be as useful as the horse for all\r\nthese things?\r\n\r\nWhat causes some horses to be lean and weary while others are fat and\r\nbrisk?\r\n\r\nWhat kinds of stables should horses have as to warmth, dryness, and\r\nfresh air?\r\n\r\nWhy is it cruel to put a frosty bit into a horse's mouth?\r\n\r\nWhen a horse is warm from driving on a cold day, how should he be\r\nprotected if hitched out-of-doors?\r\n\r\nWhy, when he is warm from driving, should the blanket not be put on\r\nuntil he has been in the stable for a little while?\r\n\r\nCorrelate with reading from _Black Beauty_.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n~Preparation.~--I want you to find out some more things about the horse,\r\nbut you will understand these things better if you remember that long\r\nago all horses were wild, just as some horses are wild on the prairies\r\nto-day, and that the habits learned by wild horses remain in our tame\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\n     The teacher should read to the class parts of \"The Pacing\r\n     Mustang\" from Ernest Thompson-Seton's _Wild Animals I Have\r\n     Known_, or \"Kaweah's Run\" from _Neighbours with Claws and\r\n     Hoofs_. This will give the pupils a motive for making the\r\n     required observations.\r\n\r\n~Observations.~--Compare the length of the legs of the horse with his\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nOf what use were these long legs to the wild horses?\r\n\r\nWhat causes horses to \"shy\"? Of what use was this habit to wild horses?\r\n\r\nIn how many directions can a horse move his ears? Of what use was this\r\nto wild horses?\r\n\r\nWhen horses in a field are alarmed, do they rush together or keep apart,\r\nand where are the young foals found at this time? Of what use were these\r\nhabits to wild horses? Are the eyes of the horse so placed that he can\r\nsee behind him and to either side as well as in front? Of what use was\r\nthis to wild horses?\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--The horse is an animal which is strong, swift,\r\ngraceful, gentle, obedient, docile. The pupils should learn that, in\r\nreturn for his good services, the horse should be treated with kindness\r\nand consideration.\r\n\r\nThe legs of the horse are long, straight, and strong, and the single toe\r\n(or hoof) means that the horse walks on the tip of one toe, and the hoof\r\nis in reality a large toe nail developed to protect the tip of the toe.\r\nTo these features is due the great speed of the horse. Horses gather\r\ntogether in the field with the foals in the most protected part of the\r\ngroup, just as wild horses found it necessary to do for protection. The\r\nwild horses \"shied\" at a fierce enemy concealed in the grass, and the\r\ntame horse shies at a strange object.\r\n\r\nCORRELATIONS\r\n\r\nWith literature and reading: By interpretation of _The Bell of Atri_.\r\n\r\nWith language: By exercise on new words, as graceful, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC BIRDS\r\n\r\nTHE DUCK\r\n\r\n~Home Observations.~--Compare the duck and the drake as to size,\r\ncolouring, calls, and other sounds.\r\n\r\nObserve the position of the birds when standing. Observe their mode of\r\nwalking, of swimming, and of flying. Where do they prefer to make their\r\nnests? Why is the duck more plain in dress than the drake? What is the\r\nshape, size, and build of the nest? Describe the eggs. When does the\r\nduck sleep? Why can it not sleep upon a perch as hens do? How do ducks\r\nfeed on land? Compare with the feeding of hens. Observe how ducks feed\r\nwhen in water. Observe the various sounds, as alarm notes, call notes,\r\nsocial sounds.\r\n\r\nDescribe the preening of the feathers and explain the meaning of it.\r\n\r\nCompare the appearance of the young ducks with that of the older ones.\r\nDo the young ducks need to be taught to swim?\r\n\r\nCLASS-ROOM LESSON\r\n\r\nProvide, where convenient, a duck for class study.\r\n\r\n~Observations.~--Colour, size, general shape of the body, and the relation\r\nof the shape to ease of swimming; divisions of the body.\r\n\r\nSize of head, length of neck, and the relation of the length of the neck\r\nto the habit of feeding in water.\r\n\r\nThe legs and web feet, and the relation of these to the bird's awkward\r\nwalking and ease in swimming.\r\n\r\nThe bill and its relation to the bird's habits of feeding by scooping\r\nthings from the bottom of the water and then straining the water out.\r\nThe sensitive tip of the bill by which the duck can feel the food.\r\n\r\nThe feathers, their warmth, and compactness for shedding water. The oil\r\nspread over them during the preening is useful as a protection against\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe bill, feet, and feathers should be compared with those of the hen\r\nand goose, and reasons for the similarities and differences should be\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\nThe uses that people make of ducks and their feathers and eggs; the\r\ngathering of eider-down.\r\n\r\nFor desk work, make drawings of the duck when swimming, flying, and\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nFORM I\r\n\r\nSPRING\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN WORK\r\n\r\nThe pupils in Form I cannot be expected to do heavy work, such as\r\nspading plots or making paths. In some cases the larger boys will\r\nundertake to line out the walks and do the spading or digging. Sometimes\r\nit may be best to engage a man to do the spading. In any case the boys\r\nand girls should do the measuring and marking out of the plots. If\r\nstable manure is used in fertilizing the plots, it must be well rotted\r\nand then carefully spaded into the plots. The rest of the work should be\r\ndone by the pupils themselves under the direction of the teacher. This\r\nwork will include the levelling of the plots with hoes and rakes, and\r\nthe trimming of the edges to the exact size of the plots, as determined\r\nby a string drawn taut about the four corner pickets. If the pupils in\r\nthis Form have individual plots, each pupil will mark out his drills,\r\nput in the seeds, and cover them. The teacher may give demonstrations in\r\nconnection with the work but should not do the work for the pupils.\r\n\r\nThe teacher must use his own judgment as to what seeds to allow the\r\npupils to plant. One variety of vegetable and one of flowers is\r\nsufficient for Form I pupils, and it is desirable that large seeds be\r\nchosen for them and such as are pretty sure to grow under ordinary\r\ncircumstances. Beans, beets, radishes, or lettuces are suitable as\r\nvegetables, and nasturtiums, balsams, or four-o'clocks as flowers.\r\nThese seeds should be planted at least an inch apart in the drill and\r\nthe drills, twelve to fifteen inches apart. Large seeds may have an inch\r\nof soil over them and smaller seeds much less. Unless the soil is very\r\ndry, watering should not be allowed, and in any case it is better to\r\nwater the plot thoroughly the day before planting the seed instead of\r\nafter, as is commonly done. The pupils must not allow a crust to form\r\nover the plot either before the seeds come up or after. Claw-hand\r\nweeders are convenient for loosening the soil close to the plants, and\r\nsmall-sized garden rakes can be used between the rows as soon as the\r\nseedlings appear. It is always better to cultivate before the weeds get\r\na start, and thus prevent their growth. Usually the young plants will be\r\ntoo thick in the row, so that thinning should be begun when the plants\r\nare about two inches high. The edges of the plots should be kept\r\nstraight and the paths clean and level. Each plot should have a wooden\r\nlabel bearing the owner's name or number and Form. The teacher is\r\nreferred to _Circular 13_ of the Ontario Department of Education,\r\n_Elementary Agriculture and Horticulture_, for lists of seeds, tools,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nGARDEN STUDIES\r\n\r\nThe pupils should be in the garden every day as soon as gardening\r\ncommences. In this way only will they be able to follow and appreciate\r\nthe whole life of the plant from seed to seed again. The teacher should\r\ngive a few minutes daily to receiving verbal reports from the pupils.\r\nAll new developments that the pupils notice should be reported for the\r\ngood of all. The teacher should make a practice of visiting the garden\r\nfor a few minutes daily before or after school, in order that he may be\r\nin a position to direct the pupils in their studies in the garden. The\r\npupils should watch for the first appearance of the young plants above\r\nground, noting how they get through the soil, and the size, shape, and\r\ncolour of the first leaves. They can readily determine whether all of\r\nthe seeds grow. They will then watch for the opening of the second pair\r\nof leaves and compare them with the first pair. They should report the\r\namount of growth made from day to day, and also what insect enemies\r\nattack the plants, and what animals, such as toads and birds, are seen\r\nduring the season. They will also have occasion to note the effect of\r\nrain and sun upon the soil and upon the plants. The first vegetables fit\r\nfor use and the first flowers in bloom will be reported. While they give\r\nspecial attention to the development of the plants in their own plots,\r\nthey will of course observe what is going on in the garden generally.\r\n\r\nCorrelate with the interpretation of \"The Seed\" in _Nature in\r\nVerse_.--Lovejoy. Silver, Burdett & Co., 60 cents.\r\n\r\nWINDOW GARDEN\r\n\r\nThe pupils should plant some seeds in sand or moist sawdust in boxes or\r\npots in the school-room, so that they may be able to examine the\r\nprogress of germination. In this way they will come to realize that\r\nevery good seed has in it a tiny plant asleep and that warmth and\r\nmoisture are needed to awaken it and help it to grow. It sends one\r\ndelicate shoot down into the soil and another up into the light. Another\r\ninteresting way to plant seeds is in egg-shells filled with fine, moist\r\nsoil, which are set in rows in a box of sand. One seed only should be\r\nput in a shell. The plants may be grown to quite a size and then set out\r\nin the garden plot, the shell having first been broken off and the ball\r\nof earth containing the roots carefully set down in a small hole, packed\r\nabout with garden soil, and watered. The pupils should draw diagrams or\r\nmaps of their plots and afterwards of the whole garden. (See Manual on\r\n_Geography_.) They can mark the lines of plants, and those who can write\r\ncan give in short, simple sentences the main things noticed from day to\r\nday. They should give the day and date when the seeds were planted, when\r\nplants came up, when rain storms occurred, when work in weeding,\r\nthinning, and cultivating was done, when the plants were fit to use, and\r\nhow they were disposed of, etc. This will serve as profitable seat work\r\nin writing, drawing, and language. Simple problems based upon dimensions\r\nof plots and the value of vegetables, etc., afford excellent\r\nsupplementary exercises in arithmetic.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD FLOWERS\r\n\r\nThe admiration that even little children have for the wild flowers of\r\nthe woods and their delight in finding and gathering them is sufficient\r\njustification for including them in studies for Form I. The teacher must\r\nbe careful, however, lest he go too far in the critical examination of\r\nthe parts of the flowers, forgetting that little children are not\r\ninterested in stamens and petals, but in the fresh, fragrant, and\r\ndelicate blossoms that beautify the little banks and hollows of every\r\nwoodland and that brighten up the fields and roadsides in spring time.\r\nThe teacher should aim to deepen that childish admiration and give to\r\nthe child a more intelligent appreciation of the beauties of the wild\r\nflowers and a desire to protect them from extermination.\r\n\r\nNo attempt should be made to prohibit the picking of wild flowers, but\r\nthe pupils should be instructed not to pull up plants by the roots. The\r\npicking of flowers in moderation does not injure the plants, but rather\r\ntends to increase their vigour. Pupils should pick flowers with some\r\npurpose in view, rather than to see how big a bunch each can gather. The\r\nteacher should show them how to arrange a few flowers in a neat bouquet\r\nand emphasize the fact that a great mass of blossoms crushed closely\r\ntogether is far from being artistic or ornamental. Pupils should then be\r\nencouraged to make up pretty bouquets for the teacher's desk, for the\r\nhome dining-room, and for old or invalid people who love\r\nflowers--especially those plucked by the hands of thoughtful children.\r\n\r\nRECOGNITION OF WILD FLOWERS\r\n\r\nThe pupils should learn to recognize each year a few species of wild\r\nflowers by name as well as by sight. This may be accomplished in two\r\nways, (1) by means of excursions to the woods a few times each year\r\nduring the spring and summer months, and (2) by having occasional\r\nobservation lessons in the school-room based upon the flowers gathered\r\nfor the school-room bouquets. Both methods are to be recommended, but it\r\nmust be borne in mind that a wilted, lacerated flower has no interest\r\nfor a little child.\r\n\r\nLESSON IN OUTLINE\r\n\r\nBLOODROOT\r\n\r\nPlants are always most interesting when studied in their natural\r\nenvironment, and this is one reason why the school excursion deserves\r\nthe highest commendation as a method of studying wild flowers. When\r\nstudying wild flowers out-of-doors, the pupils should notice what seems\r\nto be the favourite or usual location for the particular species under\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nHave the pupils observe the following about the bloodroot:\r\n\r\nIt seems to prefer fairly dry, rich soil, on or near a hillside. It\r\nopens its beautiful white blossoms early in the spring, as if to enjoy\r\nthe bright sunshine before the trees put out their thick coat of leaves\r\nto shade it. It, like many another early spring flower, comes into bloom\r\nso early in the spring because it got ready the summer before. The\r\nteacher should carefully dig up a specimen--root and all--as young\r\npupils cannot be depended on to get up all of the underground part. Note\r\nthe large amount of plant food stored up in the underground stem, how\r\nthe flower was protected before it opened out, and what becomes of the\r\nprotection. Note the peculiar beauty of the snow-white blossoms with\r\ntheir yellow centres, and how beautiful they look as they nestle amongst\r\nthe handsome green leaves with their pinkish-tinted stems. Wound the\r\nroot, and notice the reddish, bloodlike juice whence the plant derives\r\nits name. Indians sometimes use this juice for war-paint, and some\r\nmothers give it to their children on sugar as a cure for coughs and\r\ncolds.\r\n\r\nOther wild flowers suitable for Form I are buttercup, spring beauty,\r\ndog's-tooth violet, hepatica, and trillium.\r\n\r\nIf there is a corner of the school ground that is partly shaded, and if\r\nthe soil is fairly mellow and moist, some of these wild flowers should\r\nbe transplanted there where they will grow well and can be seen every\r\nday during the blooming period.\r\n\r\nThe leaves and flowers of the bloodroot and the above-mentioned wild\r\nflowers can be used for drawing.\r\n\r\nCORRELATIONS\r\n\r\nOral and written descriptions of the flowers studied afford suitable\r\nexercises in language and composition.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSECT STUDY\r\n\r\nCECROPIA, OR EMPEROR-MOTH\r\n\r\nThe larvae of this, the largest of Canadian moths, may be found early in\r\nSeptember, as they wander about in search of a suitable branch upon\r\nwhich to fasten their cocoons. If the pupils are not successful in\r\nfinding the larvae, the cocoons can be found after the leaves have\r\nfallen, because their size makes them conspicuous. The only difficulty\r\nin finding them is due to their being of the same colour as the withered\r\nleaves, so that they are easily mistaken for the latter.\r\n\r\nThe pupils should be directed to look carefully at what appears at first\r\nsight to be a withered leaf attached to a tree or shrub, and in this way\r\nmany cocoons of various moths will be found.\r\n\r\n~Observe.~--The large size--from three to four inches long; the greenish\r\ncolour; the stumpy legs; movements, as walking, feeling, clinging; the\r\nrows of warts, and short, stiff spines on these; the feeding habits,\r\nbiting or sucking; eggs of parasites, for frequently these are found on\r\nthe larvae.\r\n\r\nPlace the larva in a box covered with gauze, and observe the spinning\r\nand weaving of the cocoon.\r\n\r\nFrom what part of the body is the silk obtained? With what organs are\r\nthe threads placed in position? What part of the cocoon is made first\r\nand what part is made last? What time is required for making the cocoon?\r\nHow is the cocoon fastened to the tree? What provision is made in the\r\ncocoon for warmth, for protection from birds, for shelter from rain?\r\n\r\nCut open a cocoon and examine the pupa, noting the mummy-like case on\r\nwhich can be seen the impressions of the wings developing within.\r\n\r\nIf the cocoon is kept in the vivarium in a cool place, so that the\r\nconditions may be as nearly as possible like the natural conditions, the\r\nadult moth will emerge about the first of May. In April the cocoon\r\nshould be wetted occasionally, as it would be if exposed to rains; this\r\nensures more perfect development of the insect.\r\n\r\n~Observe.~--At what part of the cocoon the moth makes an opening; the slow\r\nspreading and strengthening of the wings; the size and coloration of the\r\nmoth; the feathery feelers; the position of the wings and sucking mouth\r\nparts when at rest.\r\n\r\nRequire the pupils to make drawings of the cocoon, larva, and adult.\r\n\r\nThe promothea moth, whose cocoons are common on lilac bushes, may be\r\nstudied in the same way as the emperor.\r\n\r\nReference.--Silcox and Stevenson: _Modern Nature Study_\r\n\r\nDRAGON-FLY\r\n\r\nThe larvae of this insect may be obtained in May or June by scraping\r\nleaves, weeds, and mud from the bottom of ponds and allowing the mud and\r\nwater to settle in a pail or tub. The larvae may be distinguished from\r\nother aquatic creatures by the long insect-like body, three pairs of\r\nlegs, and the \"mask\"--a flap with pincers at the end. This mask can be\r\nturned under the head and body when not in use, or it can be projected\r\nin front of the larva for catching prey. At the rear end are three\r\ntubes, which fit together to form the breathing tube.\r\n\r\nThe pupils should observe the above features, and also the movements,\r\nseizing of prey, breathing, moulting, semi-resting or pupa stage, at the\r\nclose of which the pupa climbs up a reed or stalk of grass and bursts\r\nthe skin from which the adult emerges.\r\n\r\nThe pupils should put into the aquarium various kinds of insects and\r\ndecide what foods are preferred by the larva and the adult.\r\n\r\n~Observe.~--The size, length of body, movements in flight, lace-like\r\nwings, and insect-killing habits of the dragon-fly.\r\n\r\nShould dragon-flies be protected? Give reasons. Are all dragon-flies of\r\nthe same size, build, and colour? At what time of year are dragon-flies\r\nmost numerous?\r\n\r\n~Reference.~--Silcox and Stevenson: _Modern Nature Study_.\r\n\r\nOTHER CONSPICUOUS INSECTS\r\n\r\nThe potato-beetle, giant water-bug, eastern swallow-tail butterfly, and\r\npromothea moth are insects suitable as types to be studied by the pupils\r\nof Form I. The giant water-bug is the large, broad, grayish-brown insect\r\nthat is found on the sidewalks in May and June mornings. (For\r\ninformation on the eastern swallow-tail and promothea see Metamorphosis,\r\nin Butterfly and Moth Collections.)\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRDS\r\n\r\nBird studies for Form I should be limited to observations made directly\r\nupon a few common birds, such as the robin, house-sparrow (English),\r\nsong-sparrow, flicker, house-wren, crow, bronzed grackle, and\r\nmeadow-lark. These are easily reached by the pupils of every rural and\r\nvillage school, and the purpose of the lessons should be to teach the\r\npupils to recognize these birds, and by making use of child interest in\r\nliving active creatures, to develop their interest in birds.\r\n\r\nTHE ROBIN\r\n\r\nFIELD EXERCISES\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nObserve the robins and find out the following things:\r\n\r\n1. Are all robins of the same colour? If not of the same colour, what\r\ndifference do you note?\r\n\r\n2. Does the bird run or hop? Imitate its movements.\r\n\r\n3. Listen to its song. Is it sweet or harsh? Is it loud or low? Is it\r\ncheerful or gloomy?\r\n\r\n4. Watch the robin as it moves along the grass and learn how it finds\r\nout where the worms are.\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--The pupils should be given a few days in which to\r\nfind out answers to these questions, and at the end of that time the\r\nanswers should be discussed in the class.\r\n\r\nMale robins have more pronounced colours than female robins. The beak is\r\nyellower, the breast is brighter, the back and the top of the head are\r\ndarker. Robins both run and hop. The sense of sight of the robin is very\r\nacute, but its sense of hearing is even more keen. The bird may be\r\nobserved turning its head to one side to listen for the sound of a worm\r\nwhich is still inside its burrow.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nA second set of exercises may now be assigned which will demand a more\r\ndetailed study of the bird, namely, a study of the size, colour, form of\r\nbody, manner of flight, and length of beak.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE NEST, EGGS, AND YOUNG\r\n\r\n1. Find out various places in which robins build their nests. In what\r\nways are these places all alike? Examine the materials of the nest and\r\nfind out why the nests are built in the kind of places in which they are\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n2. Describe the eggs.\r\n\r\n3. What kinds of food do the parent birds bring to the young? Does the\r\nfather bird aid in bringing food to the young?\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--The nests are found in well-sheltered parts of apple\r\ntrees and evergreens, in sheds, under ledges of roofs, and in other\r\nsheltered places. The nests, since they are composed largely of mud and\r\ngrass, would easily be washed away if exposed to rain storms. The food\r\nbrought to the young consists of worms and insect larvae, and the father\r\nbird is very industrious in helping to take care of his family. It is\r\nthe father bird that sings, and the mother bird devotes all her energies\r\nto working and scolding.\r\n\r\nTHE SONG-SPARROW\r\n\r\nFIELD EXERCISES\r\n\r\nIn early March, when the streams are just beginning to break from\r\nunderneath the ice and spots of ground peep here and there through the\r\nsnow, assign to the pupils an exercise such as the following:\r\n\r\nWatch for a small, gray-brown bird which perches near the top of a bush,\r\nor small tree, and sings the \"Tea-kettle Song\".\r\n\r\nTry to interpret the song in the words:\r\n\r\n\"Maids! Maids! Maids! Put on the tea-kettle, tea-kettle, tea-kettle,\r\ntea-kettle, tea-kettle-ettle.\"\r\n\r\nIs the song bright and cheerful or dull and gloomy? Does the bird sing\r\nthis song often?\r\n\r\nApproach close to the bird. Are there any stripes or spots on its breast\r\nor head?\r\n\r\nDescribe the flight of the bird from its perch, when it is disturbed.\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--It is possible for the pupils to distinguish the\r\nsong-sparrow by means of the above exercises. It is one of the first\r\nbirds to return in the spring, and, as it is a lusty singer, it will\r\nattract the attention of all who are looking for birds. The dark brown\r\nspot in the centre of the breast is a distinguishing mark, and the more\r\nobservant will find the three ashy-gray stripes on its head and the dark\r\nline through the eye.\r\n\r\nWhen disturbed, it does not rise into the air, but flies downward and\r\ndisappears with a swish of its tail. The nest is usually built on the\r\nground or in a low bush or tree. It is composed of grass, fine roots, or\r\nweed stems, and lined with fine grass or hair. The eggs are usually four\r\nor five, but sometimes there are as many as seven. They are white with a\r\ngreenish-blue tint and are closely spotted with brown.\r\n\r\nCLASS-ROOM LESSON\r\n\r\nDiscuss with the pupils the observations that they have made on the\r\nfield exercises.\r\n\r\nGeneralize as to the similarity of the places in which the pupils have\r\nseen the sparrow singing, and as to the times of day in which the bird\r\nsings.\r\n\r\nTeach the marks of identification which some have discovered, using for\r\nthis purpose pictures of the bird or black-board drawings; and encourage\r\nthose who have not yet seen the song-sparrow to try again and to secure\r\nthe assistance of those who have succeeded.\r\n\r\nCompare the size and form of the song-sparrow with that of the\r\nhouse-sparrow (English).\r\n\r\nTell the pupils the great value of the bird in killing cutworms,\r\nplant-lice, caterpillars, ground-beetles, grasshoppers, flies, and other\r\ninsects. It also helps to prevent the spread of weeds by eating\r\nthousands of seeds of noxious weeds.\r\n\r\nAssign the pupils some other things to discover, as for example: Through\r\nhow many months of the summer does the bird sing? Find the nest. Why is\r\nit hard to find? Describe the eggs, as to size, colour, and number. Do\r\nnot disturb the nest and do not visit it very often.\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--Base lessons in bird study upon the English sparrow,\r\nflicker, wren, and meadow-lark.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHEEP\r\n\r\nPROBLEMS FOR FIELD WORK\r\n\r\nHow do sheep find one another when they have become separated?\r\n\r\nHow old are the lambs before they can keep up with the old sheep when\r\nrunning? What fits the lamb for running so well?\r\n\r\nWatch the lambs when they are playing, and find out whether they play:\r\n\r\n1. I'm the king of the castle.\r\n\r\n2. Follow the leader.\r\n\r\nFind out by watching a flock of sheep what is meant by \"Men follow one\r\nanother like a flock of sheep\".\r\n\r\nDescribe how sheep move when they are going very fast.\r\n\r\nWhy should sheep be kept in a well-ventilated building that protects\r\nthem from snow and rain but is not very warm?\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--Each movement, habit, and instinct implied in this\r\nexercise is explained by the life of the wild sheep. Their natural home\r\nis in the mountain, and their swift movement is that of bounding from\r\nrock to rock as they follow the strongest and boldest (their leader) to\r\na place of safety. The legs of the lamb grow rapidly, beyond all\r\nproportion to the rate of growth of the body, so that within two weeks\r\nafter birth the young lamb is almost as strong of limb and fleet of foot\r\nas its mother. In their games the lambs are fitting themselves for their\r\nplace in the flock, and these games very much resemble those named in\r\nthe exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nFORM II\r\n\r\nAUTUMN\r\n\r\n\r\nBULB PLANTING OUT-OF-DOORS\r\n\r\nTulips and daffodils (narcissus) are the most suitable bulbs for\r\nout-of-door planting. The best varieties for outdoor culture are usually\r\ndesignated in catalogues. Bulbs should not be planted in individual\r\nplots, but in borders and ornamental beds. The latter should not be\r\nplaced in the centre of a lawn, as is frequently done. Bulbs should be\r\nplanted before the last of October.\r\n\r\nBEDS FOR GROWING BULBS\r\n\r\nTo make a bulb bed, throw out the top soil to a depth of eight or nine\r\ninches, put about three inches of well-rotted stable manure in the\r\nbottom, and cover it with about three inches of the soil which was\r\nthrown out. Rake the plot level and then place the bulbs about eight\r\ninches apart on the top of the soil, arranging them in any design\r\nchosen. Cover them with the rest of the soil and rake it level. There\r\nwill be about five inches of soil over the bulbs. When a solid crust has\r\nformed over the bed, put on a covering of leaves, straw, or branches of\r\nevergreens, and some pieces of boards to hold them in place. This\r\ncovering does not protect the bulbs from freezing, but prevents too\r\nrapid thawing out in the spring. This covering should remain until the\r\ntips of the bulbs are showing above ground, when it should be removed.\r\nOrdinarily the bulbs may be left a second year before digging up. They\r\nshould then be re-set or replaced with new ones, and the bed made and\r\nfertilized as before.\r\n\r\nIn clay soil the bulbs should not be set quite so deep as in sandy soil,\r\nand the bulbs have better drainage about their roots if a handful of\r\nsand is placed under each bulb in planting.\r\n\r\nCrocus bulbs may be planted in clumps anywhere about the grounds or\r\nborders by simply making a small hole about five inches deep, dropping\r\nthe bulb in, and covering it. Lily of the valley grows best in partial\r\nshade in some unfrequented corner.\r\n\r\nPLANTING OF BULBS INDOORS\r\n\r\nRead again the instructions given under this heading in Form I work,\r\nregarding soil, planting, and care. The Chinese sacred lily and trumpet\r\nnarcissus may be chosen for the pupils of this Form. The narcissus, also\r\ncalled daffodil, may be held back until early spring if kept in a cool,\r\ndark cellar, but the Chinese sacred lily, which is also a variety of\r\nnarcissus, comes into bloom from four to six weeks after planting. It is\r\nusually grown in water in a bowl of suitable size. Place a few pieces of\r\ncharcoal in the bottom of the bowl, set the bulb upon them, and pack\r\ncoloured stones and shells around it as a support. Keep the bowl about\r\ntwo thirds full of water and set it in a warm, sunny place. It does not\r\nneed to be set in the dark, as is the case with other bulbs. These may\r\nalso be grown in soil in the same way as other varieties of narcissus.\r\nWhen blooming is over, the bulbs may be thrown away, as they cannot be\r\nused again.\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN WORK\r\n\r\n(See Autumn work for Form I.)\r\n\r\nThe pupils in Form II should be given more responsibility with reference\r\nto the care and management of their garden plots. If they have had a\r\ncouple of years in gardening while in Form I, they will have gained\r\nsufficient knowledge as to the needs of plants and sufficient practice\r\nin garden craft to do a certain amount of work quite independently. The\r\nboys of Form II are able, with suitable garden tools, to do all the work\r\nneeded in the management of their own plots and may even be allowed to\r\ndo some of the harder work for the girls of their Form.\r\n\r\nSEED SELECTION\r\n\r\nBesides the usual work of weeding, cultivating, and harvesting of their\r\ncrops, the pupils should undertake some work in seed selection. This\r\nwork not only results in the improvement of the plants grown from year\r\nto year, but also helps to train the pupils in painstaking observation\r\nand the discerning of minute points of excellence. The ambition to\r\nproduce, by careful selection and thorough cultivation, a grain or\r\nflower better than has been, is aroused, and, as the pupil's interest\r\nincreases, his love for the art increases and his efforts meet with\r\ngreater success.\r\n\r\nThe teacher should aim from the first to use only the best available\r\nseed even if the cost be greater. He should send for a number of\r\ncatalogues and carefully choose those varieties of seeds that possess\r\nevident merit for the purpose intended. In the case of flowers, the\r\npupils should be asked to decide what individual plants showed greatest\r\nexcellence, and these should be marked, and the seed from them\r\npreserved for next season's planting. When the flower is in full bloom,\r\na small string tag should be tied to the flower stem (string tags can be\r\ngot from a local merchant). On this tag should be written in lead-pencil\r\nthe name of the species, the shade, and date of flowering. These flowers\r\nshould be left to ripen thoroughly, and then the seed picked and sealed\r\nup in small envelopes, which the pupils should make as part of their\r\nmanual training work. The date on the tag should be transferred to the\r\nseed envelope.\r\n\r\nSTORING SEEDS\r\n\r\nAll the envelopes should be collected, placed in a mouse-proof box, and\r\nstored in a cool, dry place until time to plant in the spring. Small\r\nbottles are excellent for holding seed and safer than envelopes. If such\r\nselection is carried on systematically, it will result in an increase of\r\nyield and of quality not to be equalled by even the best seed that the\r\nmarkets have to offer. Thus the school garden may become the centre of\r\ninterest for the community. Seeds of good varieties can be distributed\r\nto the ratepayers, and the standard of gardening and horticulture\r\nraised. Here, as elsewhere, much--almost everything--depends upon the\r\nteacher's interest and ability to lead as well as to instruct.\r\n\r\nHARVESTING AND STORING OF GARDEN CROPS\r\n\r\nAs soon as the vegetables reach their best stage of development, they\r\nshould be taken from the garden by the owner. All dead plants and refuse\r\nshould be removed and covered up in a compost heap. The boys of this\r\nForm should also assist in doing part of the general work of the school\r\ngarden. They might take up from the garden border such tender plants as\r\ndahlias, gladioli, and Canna lilies. These should be dried off and\r\nstored in a cool, dry cellar. If the cellar be warm, it is necessary to\r\ncover the bulbs with garden soil to prevent their drying out too much.\r\n\r\nCLASS-ROOM LESSON\r\n\r\nThe pupils are led, through conversation, to state their experiences and\r\nobservations. The teacher assists them in interpreting their\r\nobservations and organizing their knowledge and stimulates them to\r\nthoughtful search for further information.\r\n\r\nDiscuss with the pupils such questions as:\r\n\r\nWhat are people busy doing on their farms and in their gardens at this\r\ntime of year? Why do they harvest and store the wheat, oats, corn,\r\npotatoes, and apples, etc.? Are there any countries in which people do\r\nnot need to gather in the grains, vegetables, and fruits?\r\n\r\nThe discussion of these questions will direct their thought to the need\r\nof storing sufficient food for animals and for man to last through the\r\nwinter, when these things do not grow. They must be gathered to protect\r\nthem from destruction by storms of wind and rain and the severe frosts\r\nof winter. People who live in very warm countries find foods growing all\r\nthe year round, and they do not need to prepare for winter, but these\r\npeople are always lazy and unprogressive.\r\n\r\nDiscuss the means taken to protect the various crops, as follows:\r\n\r\nWhy can grain be kept in barns or granaries or in stacks? Why can\r\napples, turnips, and potatoes not be kept in the same way as grains?\r\nWhat are the conditions that are best suited for keeping the latter\r\nproducts? Name some kinds of crops that cannot be kept in any of the\r\nways already discussed. Why can they not be kept in these ways?\r\n\r\nThese discussions will develop the idea of the necessity of keeping\r\napples, potatoes, and turnips, in cellars, root-houses, and pits, where\r\nthey cannot freeze, but where they are kept at uniformly low\r\ntemperatures which are as close as possible to their freezing points.\r\nThe air must not be too dry, as dryness causes them to shrivel up. In\r\ndry cellars they should be covered with fine soil. Very delicate fruits,\r\nsuch as cherries, grapes, peaches, plums, strawberries, etc., can only\r\nbe kept for a length of time by preserving or canning them.\r\n\r\nCorrelate with lessons in Household Management on preserving and\r\ncanning.\r\n\r\nFALL CULTIVATION\r\n\r\nWhen the garden has been finally cleaned out, the plot should be spaded\r\nup and left without raking. Clay soil especially is much improved in\r\nphysical qualities by thus being exposed to the air and frost. All\r\ngarden tools should receive a special cleaning up before storing for\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN STUDIES\r\n\r\nThe observational studies suggested under this head for Form I will be\r\nfollowed also in Form II. The pupils of Form II will be expected to make\r\nmore critical observations in connection not only with the plants\r\ngrowing in their own individual plots, but also with those plants which\r\nother pupils have been growing. They should give some attention also to\r\nthe plants in the perennial flower border.\r\n\r\nGARDEN RECORDS.\r\n\r\nIn this Form the pupils should begin to make garden records on such\r\npoints as the following:\r\n\r\n1. Description of the plant--size, habit of growth, kind of leaves and\r\ntheir arrangement, date of flowering, form, size and colouring of the\r\nflowers, points of merit or the reverse, description of the seed and how\r\nscattered, how disposed of, and the value.\r\n\r\n2. The work done in the garden from day to day, with dates.\r\n\r\n3. The effect of rain, drought, or other weather conditions on the\r\ngrowth of the plants.\r\n\r\n4. What insects were seen visiting the flowers and what they were\r\ndoing--whether beneficial or harmful.\r\n\r\n5. What birds or other animals were found frequenting the garden. (See\r\nAnimal Studies, pp. 30, 96, 217.)\r\n\r\n6. What plants suffered from earliest frosts; what from subsequent\r\nfrosts; what ones proved to be most hardy, etc.\r\n\r\n7. What plants the pupils like most in the garden, and what ones seem to\r\nsuit the soil and weather conditions best.\r\n\r\nThe pupils in this Form, by direct observation, should come to\r\nappreciate the development of the fruit and seed from the flower. Their\r\nwork in seed selection, based upon the excellence of the flower, helps\r\nto ensure this line of observation.\r\n\r\nCORRELATIONS\r\n\r\nArt: Drawing of leaves, flowers, and vegetables, in colour when\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nArithmetic: Calculations as to dimensions, number of plants, number of\r\nflowers on a plant and seeds in a flower, value of products of flowers\r\nand vegetables. Cost of seeds, fertilizer, and labour, gross and net\r\nproceeds. Statement showing the above.\r\n\r\nComposition: General connected account or story of the work done and the\r\nthings learned during the season, as taken from the garden diary and\r\nfrom memory.\r\n\r\nExercises in writing and spelling, as suitable seat work.\r\n\r\nGeography: Weather observations, as related to the garden work and to\r\nplant growth. Comparison of the soil of the garden with other samples\r\nfrom the district, as to composition and origin. Direction, as related\r\nto the paths or walks in the garden.\r\n\r\nMap drawing: Plans of plots and of whole garden and grounds, represented\r\non sand-table, paper, or black-board. Map drawing on a horizontal\r\nsurface is best for the first year or two.\r\n\r\nThe products of the garden, as compared with home products, as food\r\nsupplies for man and beast.\r\n\r\nManual Training: Making of seed envelopes and boxes, modelling in clay\r\nof fruits and vegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMBING PLANTS\r\n\r\nObserve particularly the sweet-pea and morning-glory.\r\n\r\nConsider the following points:\r\n\r\n1. Advantages gained by climbing, such as securing of more light,\r\nproduction of many leaves and flowers, and not so much stem.\r\n\r\n2. Method of climbing--sweet-pea by tendrils that wind around the\r\nsupport; morning-glory by twining its rough stem closely around its\r\nsupport. Do all morning-glory vines twine in the same direction? Find\r\nother vines that climb. Examine their modes of climbing.\r\n\r\n3. Time of flowering and notes on how to plant.\r\n\r\nMake drawings of the leaves and blossoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREES\r\n\r\n     (See type lesson on trees under Form I.)\r\n\r\nIn this Form it is better to follow closely the development of one or\r\ntwo selected trees in school or on the home grounds than to attempt to\r\nobserve many different species. Allow the pupils to choose their own\r\ntrees for study and, if possible, have them select one at home and\r\nanother near the school or on the way to school. The following points\r\nmight receive attention: The name of the species, whence obtained and by\r\nwhom planted if known; its approximate height, size, and age; its\r\nlocation, and the nature of the soil; its general shape, and whether or\r\nnot influenced at present or at some time in the past by proximity to\r\nother trees; description and arrangement of its branches, leaves, and\r\nbuds, its bark, flowers, and fruit; time of leafing out and blossoming;\r\ncolouring and falling of leaves and ripening of seeds; the amount of\r\ngrowth for the year compared with that of previous years as shown by the\r\nyounger branches; qualities of beauty and usefulness of the tree.\r\nDrawing exercises.\r\n\r\nAt least two visits should be made to the woods during the autumn\r\nmonths, one when the leaves of the trees begin to colour and another\r\nwhen the leaves have fallen. Consider the preparation made for winter in\r\nthe woods and fields, the use of dead leaves in the woods as a\r\nprotection to forest vegetation and as soil-making material. Bring back\r\nsamples of leaves and of leaf mould or humus for class-room observation.\r\nNote the effect of frost in hastening the falling of leaves--frost does\r\nnot give the brilliant hues to leaves, as many people think. Consider\r\nthe relationship of the forest trees to animal life.\r\n\r\nSTORING OF TREE SEEDS\r\n\r\nMake a collection of nuts and other tree seeds, some of which should be\r\nput in the school collection and the rest planted in the garden or\r\nstored away for spring planting. The seeds of evergreens should be kept\r\ndry and cold, but other seeds, as a rule, are best packed in a box of\r\nslightly moist sand set in a cold place or buried in the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FLOWER\r\n\r\nTYPE: NASTURTIUM\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTeacher and pupils visit the nasturtium bed, where the flowers stand up\r\nboldly, surrounded by the shield-shaped leaves. A search for the young\r\nflower buds and for the very old flowers leads to the discovery that\r\nthese are snugly sheltered under the shields.\r\n\r\nThe greenish-yellow calyx, which is closely wrapped around the bud, is\r\nnext examined. Its name is given, and its use as a protector is\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\nThe strong seed cases are opened and the seeds are discovered. The\r\npupils are instructed to watch the insects that visit the bright\r\nflowers. Name the insects. Describe their movements. Catch a few and\r\nfind the yellow powder on their furry little bodies and legs.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nEach member of the class brings a flower to the school-room. The\r\nvarieties of colours of the flowers are discussed. The cave-like form of\r\neach flower is noted. The velvety feeling of the corolla and the\r\ndelicate perfume are likewise sensed by the pupils.\r\n\r\nThe pupils nip off the point of the cave and taste the nectar (honey),\r\nand thus learn why the insects visit the flowers. They next trace the\r\ncourse of the coloured lines on the corolla and find that they all point\r\ninto the cave.\r\n\r\nContinuing their explorations of the mouth of the cave, the pupils will\r\ndiscover the little boxes containing the yellow powder that the flower\r\ndusts upon the insects. The names _pollen_ and _pollen boxes_ are given.\r\n\r\nThe fringe on the edges of the leaves of the corolla for the purpose of\r\npreventing the insects stealing into the cave without receiving their\r\nbaptism of pollen, is discovered.\r\n\r\nThe teacher should, at this point, give a brief explanation of the\r\nvaluable work done by the insects in carrying pollen to cause seeds to\r\ngrow in the next flower that the insect visits. The position of the tiny\r\nbrush (stigma, but do not give this name) held up by the seed case for\r\nrubbing the pollen off the insect, should also be observed.\r\n\r\n~Summary.~--Name and point out the parts of the flower (calyx, corolla,\r\npollen boxes, seed cases).\r\n\r\nWhat useful work do insects do for the flower?\r\n\r\nWhat reward do they receive for their work?\r\n\r\nWhat advertisements do the flowers put out for attracting themselves?\r\n(Bright colours, sweet perfumes, and honey)\r\n\r\nFlowers suitable for lessons in Form II are nasturtium, larkspur,\r\nsnap-dragon, morning-glory, and sweet-pea.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Botanical names should be reduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOIL STUDIES\r\n\r\n     (See _Soils_ by Fletcher.)\r\n\r\nSoil should have a place in a Nature Study Course because:\r\n\r\n1. It is so closely related to life.\r\n\r\n2. It lends itself so admirably to the experimental method.\r\n\r\n3. It is so liable to be overlooked and considered as common and\r\nvalueless.\r\n\r\nKINDS OF SOIL\r\n\r\n_Gravel_ is composed of small, rounded stones of various colours, sizes,\r\nand shapes. Occurs in beds, generally mixed with sand. Get a sample and\r\nexamine the constituents. Lead the pupils to see that the pebbles are\r\nthe result of the breaking up of larger rocks. What has made the corners\r\nsmooth and rounded? What use is made of gravel? Have the pupils find\r\nsome gravelly land.\r\n\r\n_Sand_ is composed of small angular pieces of hard rock. Have a few\r\nsamples from different places brought to school, note fineness and\r\ncolours, examine with a lens and note resemblance to pieces of broken\r\nstone. Draw a magnet through the sand and note black particles adhering,\r\nshowing presence of iron in some form. Show the hardness by rubbing\r\nagainst the surface of a piece of glass. Sand is used for mortar,\r\nconcrete, and glass. The chief sand-forming rocks are quartz and\r\ngranite. Show pupils how to recognize these. Examine a sample of sand\r\nunder a lens.\r\n\r\n_Clay._ Note colour and odour of fresh sample. Dry and pulverize and\r\nnote extreme fineness of the particles by rubbing between the fingers\r\n(an ounce of clay contains about four and one half million particles).\r\nClay is made from crushed rocks, chiefly feldspars. Mix clay with a\r\nlittle water and note sticky character. Compare with sand in this\r\nrespect. Which makes the best road in wet weather, gravel, sand, or\r\nclay? Note how hard the clay bakes after being moistened. Uses of\r\nclay--pottery, bricks, tile. Pupils should visit a brick- or tile-yard\r\nand watch the process of manufacture. In many parts of the world there\r\nare beds of clay of extreme fineness and whiteness, from which beautiful\r\nchina is made.\r\n\r\n_Humus_ is decayed vegetable matter. Pupils should gather soil from the\r\nforest, bog, or marsh. Note dark colour. Examine carefully and see what\r\nyou can find in it that is not in sand or clay.\r\n\r\nMost of our farm land consists of these four soils mixed in various\r\nproportions, and it gets its name from the one that preponderates. Thus\r\nwe have our sandy, gravelly, or clay _loams_. Humus is likely to be\r\npresent in all fields, because vegetable matter grows, to some extent,\r\neverywhere; but freshly broken land, reclaimed swamps, and prairie lands\r\nare likely to be especially well supplied. The great value of humus in\r\nthe soil will appear in later studies.\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMAL STUDIES\r\n\r\nBIRD MIGRATION\r\n\r\n     (Consult _Bird Life_ by Frank M. Chapman, and _Bird Studies_\r\n     by G. A. Cornish.)\r\n\r\nIn the autumn, direct attention to the flight of wild ducks and geese\r\nand to the gathering into flocks of robins, crows, bronze grackles,\r\nblue herons, sparrows, and other birds in preparation for migration.\r\n\r\nDiscuss with the pupils the reasons for migration, namely, scarcity of\r\nfood, the cold, the snow. In the spring, the return is stimulated by the\r\nnesting instinct.\r\n\r\nNote how the birds are guided--some, for example the ducks and geese, by\r\ntheir leaders, while others have no guides but their instincts.\r\n\r\nIn winter, require the pupils to observe the kinds of birds that are to\r\nbe seen in the gardens, fields, orchards, and woods, having them note\r\nthe scarcity of birds and the absence of many forms that are with us in\r\nthe summer.\r\n\r\nCORRELATIONS\r\n\r\nGeography: By pointing out on the map the countries into which the birds\r\ngo, namely, Central America, Brazil, etc.\r\n\r\nReading and literature: By interpreting\r\n\r\n    Where did you spend the dreary winter?\r\n    In a green and sunny land,\r\n    By the warm sea-breezes fanned,\r\n    Where orange trees with fruit are bent,\r\n    There the dreary time I've spent.\r\n\r\nCOMMON WILD ANIMALS\r\n\r\nGENERAL METHOD FOR FIELD WORK\r\n\r\nThe best method for studying wild animals is to assign to each pupil\r\nsome animal as his particular subject of study.\r\n\r\nBegin by finding out from the pupils the wild animals that each one\r\nknows to be near his home, and assign to each pupil a number of problems\r\non the animal which is most convenient for him to study.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, only one pupil will be studying a particular kind of\r\nanimal, while in other cases several pupils may be studying the same\r\nkind of animal. The latter method has the advantage of giving\r\nopportunity for comparison of results. Differences should serve as\r\nstimuli to more careful observation, in order to verify or disprove\r\nprevious conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe observations and inferences, together with drawings illustrating the\r\nanimals, their homes, etc., are recorded in the Nature Study note-books.\r\nThese are discussed in the class, verified or corrected, and\r\nsupplemented by descriptions of lives and habits of the animals from\r\nnature writers or naturalists, such as Charles G. D. Roberts, Ernest\r\nThompson-Seton, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen pupils become interested in this form of study, they become nature\r\nstudents in the true meaning of the term. The pupil is brought into\r\ncontact with the animal in its natural environment and, under these\r\nconditions, the natural habits, interests, and activities of the wild\r\ncreatures are more likely to appeal to the sympathy of child nature than\r\nunder any other method of study. The method has also the advantage of\r\nbeing one of original discovery, and consequently it trains in\r\nself-reliance and independence of thought.\r\n\r\nFinally, since close and careful observation is necessary, the child\r\nlearns that it is unwise to alarm the animal, and thus a better\r\nrelationship between child life and animal life is fostered.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that this method is slow and that little is\r\naccomplished. This may be true from the view-point of matter learned,\r\nbut from the view-point of child training more can be accomplished from\r\nthe study of a single living animal than from the study of a score of\r\npictures or stuffed skins.\r\n\r\nA second method that is recommended is the study of tame animals. By\r\nconversations with the boys of the school the teacher will find what\r\ntame squirrels, ground-hogs, raccoons, foxes, and other animals are\r\navailable for class-room work. The possessors of these animals are\r\nusually quite willing to bring them to school for the class to study.\r\n\r\nThe movements, habits, food, and other topics, may be studied by direct\r\nobservations guided by the teacher's questions or problems.\r\n\r\nA third method and, unfortunately, the one which is in most general use,\r\nis the study of animals by means of stuffed specimens and pictures,\r\nsupplemented by descriptions and stories by the teacher. These lessons\r\nmay be called information lessons, but they are not worthy of the name\r\nNature Study. Indeed, if conditions are such that it is the only method\r\navailable for animal study, it is advised that the time be spent on\r\nother branches of the subject; but if living animals are made the basis\r\nof study, stuffed specimens may be found useful for identification and\r\nfor confirming observations on minute structural features, colour, etc.\r\n\r\nTHE WOOD-CHUCK\r\n\r\nThe problems outlined below are intended to illustrate the plan of study\r\nsuggested in the first general method. They are assigned to a boy who\r\nhas discovered a ground-hog burrow, in order to direct him in his\r\nobservations on the animal.\r\n\r\nWhat is the kind of soil dug out in making the burrow? Why is this soil\r\nsuitable for the burrow? What size of stones are dug out in burrowing?\r\nAre there more entrances than one?\r\n\r\nBy slowly approaching the animal, find out how close it will permit you\r\nto come. At what times of day does the ground-hog come out? Give reasons\r\nfor its coming out at these times rather than at mid-day. Upon what does\r\nthe animal feed? Describe the colour of the animal and find out any\r\nadvantages in this colour. Observe the following actions: running,\r\nhiding, keeping sentry, and scouting.\r\n\r\nDo more wood-chucks than one live in one burrow? When do the young\r\nwood-chucks first come out of the burrow? Describe their size, colour,\r\nand habits. Are wood-chucks ever seen during the winter? Do they use the\r\nsame burrow year after year? Describe the sounds made by the animal.\r\nWhat injury does the animal cause to the fields?\r\n\r\nDescribe the fur, teeth, and claws, and show their relation to the\r\nanimal's habits of life.\r\n\r\nDig out a burrow and draw a plan of it. Make pictures showing the\r\nvarious attitudes of the animal.\r\n\r\nTHE CHIPMUNK\r\n\r\nFIELD EXERCISES\r\n\r\nDescribe the size, colour, shape, length of tail, and movements of the\r\nchipmunk. Compare with the red squirrel.\r\n\r\nHave all chipmunks the same number of stripes?\r\n\r\nDiscover its home; method of carrying grain, nuts, or other foods;\r\nwhether it is found most commonly on the ground, in trees, or among logs\r\nand stones. Try to tame it by placing food where it can reach it and,\r\nfinally, try to have it feed from your hand.\r\n\r\nFind out why there is no loose soil around the entrance to its burrow,\r\nwhether more families than one live in one burrow, whether the chipmunk\r\ncomes out during winter, or how early in the spring. Learn to\r\ndistinguish the sounds of the animal, as expressing alarm, surprise,\r\nanger, playfulness.\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--Chipmunks carry grain, etc., in their cheeks.\r\nFrequently these are so full that they must be emptied to permit them to\r\nenter their burrows. It is not uncommon for several to spend the winter\r\nin the same burrow, having a common storehouse connected by passages to\r\nthe main burrow. These little animals are easily tamed and soon learn to\r\ntake food from the hand. They are not hibernating animals, for they\r\nstore food for winter, and though they are not asleep all winter, yet\r\nthey rarely come out of their burrows while there is snow on the ground.\r\n\r\nEASTERN SWALLOW-TAIL BUTTERFLY\r\n\r\nNo butterfly is more suitable for study by the Junior Forms than the\r\nEastern Swallow-tail. It is one of the most beautiful and attractive of\r\nour butterflies and lays its eggs so accommodatingly on every carrot or\r\nparsnip bed that it gives ample opportunity for observation.\r\n\r\nIf possible, have the pupils observe the insect in the act of placing\r\nthe eggs, one here and one there, on the under surface of the leaves of\r\nthe plants, noting the busy movements; discuss the advantage of\r\nscattering the eggs, and also that of placing them on the under surface\r\nof the leaves.\r\n\r\nIf the egg placing cannot be observed, there will be little difficulty\r\nin finding the large yellow and green larva with a head shaped like\r\nthat of a miniature sea-horse. If the larva itself is not easily found,\r\nthe leaves stripped bare of green blade and the droppings on the ground\r\nwill reveal its presence.\r\n\r\nWhy was it difficult to see such a large, and now that it is seen,\r\nconspicuous object? Lead the pupils to notice that the yellow and green\r\nbands harmonize in colour with the green leaves and alternate streaks of\r\ngolden sunlight.\r\n\r\nDoes the larva feed by biting or by sucking? How many legs has the\r\nlarva? Cover the plant and larva with a paper bag, or inverted bottle,\r\nor a lamp chimney with a gauze top until the larva is full grown; or\r\nplace the larva in a vivarium, feed it on carrot leaves, and observe its\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nWhen full grown, the larva builds for itself a snail-shaped, fairly firm\r\ncase, fastened by a slender girdle of silk to a piece of wood or other\r\nsupport. Keep this over winter, and in March, or early April, the\r\nblack-and-blue-and-gold insect emerges.\r\n\r\nObserve the movements of the wings in flight, the long tube with which\r\nit sucks honey from flowers, the three pairs of legs, the position of\r\nthe wings when at rest; compare the structure with that of the larva.\r\nMake drawings of the butterfly and paint its colours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nFORM II\r\n\r\nWINTER\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE OF PLANTS IN THE HOME\r\n\r\nThe care of flowering bulbs, which was begun in Form I, will be\r\ncontinued in Form II. The growing of new plants from cuttings will now\r\nbe taken up. In those schools which are kept continuously heated, potted\r\nplants may be kept throughout the year. The pupils will come to\r\nappreciate the plants' needs and learn how to meet them in the supply of\r\ngood soil, water, and sunlight. The following points should be observed:\r\n\r\n1. Good potting soil can be made by building up alternating layers of\r\nsods and stable manure and allowing this compost to stand until\r\nthoroughly rotted. A little sharp sand mixed with this forms an\r\nexcellent soil for most house plants.\r\n\r\n2. Thorough watering twice a week is better than adding a little water\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\n3. The leaves should be showered with water once a week to free them\r\nfrom dust.\r\n\r\n4. An ounce of whale-oil soap dissolved in a quart of water may be used\r\nto destroy plant-lice. Common soap-suds may also be used for this\r\npurpose, but care should be taken to rinse the plants in clean water\r\nafter using a soap wash.\r\n\r\n5. Most plants need some direct sunlight every day if possible, although\r\nmost of the ferns grow without it.\r\n\r\n6. Plants usually need re-potting once a year. Many kinds may be set\r\nout-of-doors in flower beds in May and left until September, when they\r\nmay be taken up and placed in pots, or cuttings may be made from them\r\nfor potting.\r\n\r\n7. A flower exhibition at the school once or twice a year, or at a local\r\nexhibition, adds to the interest.\r\n\r\n8. The pupils should report to the teacher, from time to time, the\r\nprogress of their plants and make many drawings showing their\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREES\r\n\r\nIn November or December make a study of Canadian evergreens, choosing\r\nspruce, balsam, and cedar if available. The pupils should learn to\r\ndistinguish the different species by an examination of the leaves, buds,\r\narrangement of branches, bark, seeds, and cones. The age of young trees\r\ncan be determined by noting the successive whorls of branches. In this\r\nway also the age of the leaves may be determined. On some trees the\r\nleaves persist for seven or eight years. Evergreens are frequently used\r\nas Christmas trees and their branches for house decorations. On which\r\nspecies do the leaves persist longest? How do they compare with the\r\npines? The leaves are always as old as the wood upon which they grow.\r\n\r\nHave the pupils notice how the small leaves and horizontal branches\r\nresist the clinging of snow in winter. Each branch bends down enough to\r\ncause the snow to slide off on to the one next below, and so on, until\r\nit reaches the ground. The conical shape of the tree also facilitates\r\nthis action of dislodging the snow. They will also notice that these\r\ntrees are well adapted to withstand wind, as the top part, which is most\r\nexposed to the wind, is much smaller and more pliable than the part next\r\nthe bottom. The gum, or resinous covering, of the buds protects them\r\nfrom injury by rain or snow. Some kinds of pine, such as the pitch pine,\r\nhave a great abundance of gum and turpentine. Resin and pine tar are\r\nmade chiefly from this species. Heat a piece of pine wood--a knot or\r\nroot is best. The gum will be seen oozing out of the wood. Pine torches\r\nwere much used in the early days of settlement in Canada. Examine the\r\ngum \"blisters\" in the bark of the balsam tree. From this source the\r\n\"Canada Balsam\" gum of commerce is taken. The gum and resin in the wood\r\nand bark help to preserve the wood from decay.\r\n\r\nCOLLECTION OF WOOD SPECIMENS\r\n\r\nDuring the winter months the boys may prepare specimens of wood for the\r\nschool collection. These specimens should be cut green and dried. They\r\nshould be uniform in length--not more than six inches--and should show\r\nthe bark at one side. The side showing the bark should be two inches\r\nwide at most, six inches long, and running in a V-shaped, radial section\r\ntoward the pith. A tangential section also shows well the annual layers.\r\nA piece of slab as cut lengthwise off a round stick is tangential. Also\r\nvisit wood-working factories for specimens of rare or foreign woods. In\r\nsecuring these specimens, care should be taken not to mutilate trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATED READING\r\n\r\nWinter is nature's quiescent period. Continuous active observation\r\nout-of-doors among the plants of the forest and garden gives place for\r\na time to indoor work and reflection. Pupils need time for reading and\r\nreflection, and no time is so opportune as the quiet winter season.\r\nDuring these months some time should be devoted to the reading of nature\r\nstories and extracts from magazines and books dealing with plant as well\r\nas animal life. Pupils should review their gardening experiences and\r\ndiscuss plans of improvement for the approaching spring and summer. Let\r\nthem write letters to the Form II pupils of other schools where similar\r\nwork has been carried on, giving some of their experiences in gardening\r\nand plant and animal studies. A certain Friday afternoon might be\r\nappointed for hearing the letters read which have been received in\r\nreply. Suitable short poems that have a direct bearing upon their\r\noutdoor studies should be read from time to time. Good pictures come in\r\nhere also as an aid in helping the children to appreciate written\r\ndescriptions. The first-hand observations made by the pupils will form a\r\nbasis for the better and more appreciative interpretation of these\r\nliterature selections.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOG\r\n\r\nCLASS-ROOM LESSON\r\n\r\nUse the conversation method, since this is an animal that is well known\r\nto all the pupils. By natural, easy conversation with the pupils,\r\nencourage them to tell what they know about the usefulness and the other\r\nqualities of their canine friends.\r\n\r\nThe pupils know that some dogs are useful for hunting wild animals,\r\nothers for driving or herding cattle and sheep, others for guarding\r\ntheir master's property, others for hauling sleighs and wagons, while\r\nothers are of use as pets or playfellows.\r\n\r\nDiscuss with the pupils the qualities that make the dog so generally\r\nuseful to us. In this discussion, guide the thoughts of the pupils to\r\nthe qualities of faithfulness, loyalty to his friends, and docility--few\r\nanimals are so easily taught. Note his strength and swiftness--he can\r\ncontinue in a race until he catches almost any other animal. Note also\r\nhis bravery--for he does not hesitate to attack an animal many times\r\nlarger than himself.\r\n\r\nShort stories of the following type may be told, to illustrate the chief\r\nqualities of the dog:\r\n\r\n     A dog was trained to guard any article that his master\r\n     placed under his charge, and not to permit any one to touch\r\n     it until his master gave his consent. One day, when\r\n     returning from the mill, the master placed a sack of flour\r\n     inside the gate for a neighbour who had asked him to do so,\r\n     and then continued on his way without noticing that his dog\r\n     had taken charge of the sack. All through the afternoon of\r\n     that day and through the long, cold night that followed, the\r\n     faithful animal remained at his post. When the owner of the\r\n     sack came next morning to get it, the dog, although numb\r\n     with cold and famished with hunger, would not permit him to\r\n     take the flour. Nor could the stout-hearted creature be\r\n     persuaded either by threats or by coaxing, until his master\r\n     was brought, when, at his first word of command, the dog\r\n     bounded joyfully toward him.\r\n\r\nConclude the lesson by a short discussion of the proper care and\r\ntreatment that should be given to dogs. The dog requires a fairly warm\r\nbut dry kennel, with a soft bed of straw or rugs. The food should\r\nconsist chiefly of porridge, milk, bread, biscuit, and a little meat.\r\nOnly dogs that are running a great deal out of doors should be given\r\nmuch meat. The dog should be given bones to pick; picking bones is as\r\ngood for a dog's teeth as a tooth-brush is for a boy's.\r\n\r\nOBSERVATION EXERCISES\r\n\r\nBy making observations upon your dog at home, find answers to these\r\nproblems:\r\n\r\n1. How does a dog hold a bone while he is picking it, and how does he\r\nget the meat off the bone?\r\n\r\n2. Examine the dog's feet and find out:\r\n\r\n(1) Why he does not slip while running.\r\n\r\n(2) What protects the soles of his feet from injury as he bounds over\r\nrough ground.\r\n\r\n3. Which is the sharper, a dog's eye or his nose? Watch how he finds his\r\nmaster in a crowd or finds an object that you have hidden.\r\n\r\nCORRELATIONS\r\n\r\nLanguage:\r\n\r\n1. Require oral or written reproduction of the stories used in\r\nillustration in the lesson on The Dog.\r\n\r\n2. Require the pupils to relate incidents from dog life that have come\r\nwithin their own experiences.\r\n\r\nArt and Modelling:\r\n\r\n1. A sleeping dog.\r\n\r\n2. A dog waiting for his master.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSONS INVOLVING COMPARISON\r\n\r\nIt will be found helpful, both for increasing interest in the\r\nobservations and for fixing the facts in memory, to study an animal by\r\ncomparing its habits, qualities, and physical peculiarities with those\r\nof another animal which is somewhat similar. Where differences are\r\ndiscovered, explanations of the differences should be developed in such\r\na way that a tendency may be cultivated for interpreting the adaptation\r\nof structure to use and of life habits to surrounding conditions.\r\n\r\nCAT AND DOG\r\n\r\nCompare the movement of a cat when approaching its prey with the\r\nmovement of the dog when chasing a squirrel.\r\n\r\nAccount for the difference.\r\n\r\nThe natural habit of the cat is to hunt alone and rely upon stealth,\r\nwhile dogs hunt in packs and tire their prey by running and by\r\nterrifying noises.\r\n\r\nOther differences and their explanations, which the pupils should be led\r\nto discover are:\r\n\r\nThe dog is a more useful animal to man than is the cat.\r\n\r\nThe cat's body is longer and more slender, and this gives it greater\r\nsuppleness in crawling and leaping.\r\n\r\nThe cat's eye is larger and the pupil is especially large at night, to\r\nenable it to see.\r\n\r\nThe cat's whiskers are longer; they help in guiding it at night.\r\n\r\nThe cat's tongue is rougher; it uses it for cleaning bones.\r\n\r\nThe pads on the cat's feet are softer, so that it can move more silently\r\nin stealing upon its prey.\r\n\r\nThe cat's claws are sharper, because it uses them for seizing its prey,\r\nwhile the dog seizes its prey with its teeth.\r\n\r\nThe dog is more faithful to its master because it is a more sociable\r\nanimal. In its natural state every dog is faithful to the pack and to\r\nthe leader; the cat is not a social animal, but is by nature solitary\r\nand independent.\r\n\r\nThe dog's sense of smell is keener than that of the cat, but its sense\r\nof hearing is less acute. Account for these differences from the\r\nanimals' habits of hunting. Why does the cat bring home living animals\r\nto her kittens, while the dog buries dead animals? The cat trains the\r\nkittens to approach by stealth and then to pounce on the right spot.\r\nWild animals related to the dog bury the \"kill\" which is too large to be\r\neaten at one meal.\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTS FOR ASSISTING IN THE STUDY OF THE CAT\r\n\r\n1. Gently scratch with a pin at some distance from where a cat is lying.\r\nWhat do the movements of the cat indicate?\r\n\r\n2. Put a fish in water and watch a cat trying to get it.\r\n\r\n3. Sprinkle water on a cat's fur and find out why she dislikes being\r\nwetted.\r\n\r\n4. Attach a ball to a string and move it near a cat. Describe the\r\nmovements, as stalking, springing, seizing, retreating.\r\n\r\n5. Put some catnip in a room out of reach of the cat and observe the\r\nmovements of the animal.\r\n\r\nNearly all children make pets of the house cat, and although the cat is\r\na domestic animal of thieving propensities and an enemy of birds, yet it\r\nwould be unwise to teach the younger children any enmity toward her.\r\nThe establishment of sympathy with animal life, the humanizing effect\r\nupon child nature of having a kitty for a playfellow, will offset many\r\ntimes over the amount of depredation of which she may be guilty.\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF THE HORSE AND COW\r\n\r\nAssign problems for the pupils to solve by observations made upon the\r\nanimals in the field or farmyard.\r\n\r\n1. What features of build give to the horse greater speed than the cow?\r\n\r\n2. Compare the movements of the heads of the horse and cow while\r\ncropping grass. Account for the difference.\r\n\r\n3. How has nature fitted the cow and the horse respectively, for\r\ndefence?\r\n\r\n4. Which end of the body does the horse raise first when it is getting\r\nup? Which end of its body does the cow raise first? Account for the\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--The horse is the swifter and more graceful runner\r\nbecause the body is less bulky and the legs are longer and straighter.\r\nIn cropping grass the cow pushes its nose forward and breaks the grass\r\noff, a process which is made necessary because the cow has no upper\r\nfront teeth. The strong, sharp horns, short, powerful neck, and heavy\r\nshoulders are an efficient equipment for the cow's method of defence,\r\nwhile the long, strong legs and powerful hindquarters of the horse\r\nenable it to deal terrific blows with its hard hoofs. The horse rises\r\nupon its forelegs before raising the rear of its body, while the cow\r\nraises its hindquarters first.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SQUIRREL\r\n\r\nFIELD EXERCISES\r\n\r\n~Problems~:\r\n\r\nIs it true that squirrels have little roads along the ground?\r\n\r\nDoes the squirrel come down a tree head foremost, or tail foremost?\r\n\r\nAre a squirrel's feet close together or wide apart when it is climbing?\r\n\r\nHow many kinds of feeling can a squirrel express by its voice?\r\n\r\nHow does a squirrel open a nut?\r\n\r\nExamine a squirrel's tracks in the snow; which foot-prints are in front?\r\n\r\nTry to gain the confidence of a squirrel by never chasing it and by\r\nplacing some favourite food for it.\r\n\r\nCLASS-ROOM LESSON\r\n\r\nA tame squirrel is very desirable for concrete study.\r\n\r\nDescribe the shape, size, and colour.\r\n\r\nFind out how the legs and feet are fitted for climbing and leaping.\r\n\r\nCompare the length of the tail with that of the body. Of what use is the\r\ntail in cold weather? Of what use is the tail in leaping?\r\n\r\nExamine the teeth and find out how they are fitted for opening nuts;\r\ngnawing wood.\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--The legs of the squirrel are short so that it can\r\npress its body close to the tree when climbing. The claws are strong and\r\nsharp and the hindquarters are very strong, and are, in consequence,\r\nwell fitted for leaping. The tail of the squirrel is very long and\r\nbushy and serves as a fur for keeping the squirrel's nose warm in\r\nwinter. The tail is also used for balancing the body when the animal is\r\nleaping from bough to bough.\r\n\r\nThe front teeth of the squirrel are very large and strong and are shaped\r\nlike chisels.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTER BIRDS\r\n\r\nIn the class lesson on winter birds, take up the birds that the pupils\r\nhave seen, such as chickadee, blue jay, quail, ruffed grouse, hairy\r\nwoodpecker, downy woodpecker, great horned owl, house-sparrow, snow\r\nbunting (snow bird), pine grosbeak, snowy owl, and purple finch. The\r\nfour latter are to be noted as winter visitors. Use pictures for\r\nillustrating these birds. The habits and winter food of the birds should\r\nalso be described from the view-point of how these adapt the birds for\r\nspending the winter in a cold climate. Direct the children to look for\r\ngrosbeaks in the pine and rowan trees, where they may be seen feeding on\r\nthe seeds. The ruffed grouse (commonly called partridge) feeds on the\r\nbuds of trees in winter; its legs and feet are thickly covered with\r\nfeathers in winter but are bare in summer.\r\n\r\nFIELD EXERCISES\r\n\r\nArouse the interest of the pupils by a conversation of about three\r\nminutes on birds that they have seen during the winter, and assign the\r\nfollowing exercise:\r\n\r\nTake a walk through the orchards and woods on a bright winter day. What\r\nbirds do you see? What are these birds doing? Are they found singly or\r\nin flocks? What bird sounds do you hear?\r\n\r\nCLASS-ROOM LESSON\r\n\r\nThe method is conversational and based upon the observations made by the\r\npupils during the field exercises.\r\n\r\nThe discussion would involve the winter habits of some of the more\r\ncommon birds, as, for example, the ruffed grouse (commonly though\r\nincorrectly called the partridge). This bird takes shelter from the\r\nwinter storms in the centre of a dense evergreen or burrows deep into a\r\nsnow bank. The close covering of feathers upon its feet serves not only\r\nto keep the feet warm, but also as snow-shoes. In the evenings these\r\nbirds may frequently be seen in the tops of such trees as maple, birch,\r\ncherry, and poplar, the buds of which form the greater part of their\r\nwinter food.\r\n\r\nThe snow bird, or snow bunting, is another bird commonly seen in winter.\r\nFlocks of these hardy little winter visitors frequent the roads and\r\nfields during winter. Its summer home is in the far north.\r\n\r\nAnother visitor from the sub-arctic regions is the pine grosbeak, which\r\nis often mistaken for the robin, for these two birds are nearly equal in\r\nsize. The carmine colour of the upper surface of the male grosbeak\r\ndistinguishes it from the grays and blacks of the upper part of the\r\nrobin. The grosbeak frequents the rowan trees.\r\n\r\nThe bird sounds which attract attention during the winter are the\r\ncheerful notes of the chickadee, the bold clarion call of the blue jay,\r\nand the sharp tap, tap, tap, of the downy woodpecker.\r\n\r\nThe downy woodpecker and the chickadee have snug winter homes within\r\nhollow trees, but, when the weather is favourable, they go about\r\nsearching industriously for the eggs and larvae of insects that infest\r\nforest and orchard trees.\r\n\r\nCORRELATIONS\r\n\r\nLiterature:\r\n\r\n    Do you know the chickadee,\r\n      In his brownish ashen coat,\r\n    With a cap so black and jaunty,\r\n      And a black patch on his throat?\r\n\r\nLanguage: Write a story about the winter experiences of a downy\r\nwoodpecker.\r\n\r\nGeography: Describe the summer home of the snow bird.\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMALS OF THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS\r\n\r\nPupils who have an opportunity to visit museums or zoological gardens\r\nwill observe more intelligently if the visit is preceded by such a\r\ndiscussion in the class-room as will arouse their curiosity respecting\r\nthe habits, movements, and adaptive features of the animals about to be\r\nstudied.\r\n\r\nCLASS-ROOM LESSON\r\n\r\nName the kinds of bears you have seen or have read about. What kind was\r\nthe largest?\r\n\r\nAre all bears wholly flesh-eating animals? Find out what food the\r\nkeepers give these animals.\r\n\r\nWhat features give to the bear his great strength? Observe the length of\r\nhis \"arms\", teeth, claws.\r\n\r\nDoes the bear climb a pole in the same way that a boy does?\r\n\r\nRead:\r\n\r\nRogers. Wild Animals Every Child Should Know.

Macmillan. $1.35.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nFORM II\r\n\r\nSPRING\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN WORK\r\n\r\nThe pupils have now arrived at an age when they are able to do most of\r\nthe work of preparing and planting their own plots. The seeds have been\r\nselected and placed in readiness for planting long before the ground is\r\nready. The plans for the garden and the varieties to be sown in the\r\ndifferent plots have likewise been arranged. Fertilizers, lines, tools,\r\nand labels are made ready for use. With such thorough preparation the\r\nmaking and planting of the garden becomes a pleasure and a delight to\r\nboth teacher and pupils. The garden diary should begin as soon as the\r\nsnow disappears from the garden and be continued until all the work is\r\ncompleted in the autumn, and the garden again blanketed in snow.\r\n\r\nThe main points to be safeguarded are:\r\n\r\n1. Thorough cultivation and fertilization.\r\n\r\n2. The best available seed carefully planted. Guard against thick sowing\r\nand deep covering.\r\n\r\n3. Frequent cultivation and careful thinning while the plants are quite\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\n4. Vigilance in detecting the appearance of cutworms or other injurious\r\ninsects and promptness in combating them.\r\n\r\n5. Protection of the garden against injury from dogs, pigs, poultry, and\r\nEnglish sparrows.\r\n\r\n6. Failure of some plots, through the owner's absence from school for\r\nlong periods.\r\n\r\nCOMBATING GARDEN PESTS\r\n\r\nCUTWORMS\r\n\r\nIn gardens where the soil is light or sandy, cutworms are most likely to\r\nbe troublesome. Watch for them about the time that the plants are nicely\r\nabove ground. They come up at night and cut the young plants off just\r\nabove the ground. They are about an inch long, gray and brown, fat and\r\ngreasy-looking. To protect the plants put one quarter of a pound of\r\nparis-green with twenty-five pounds of slightly moistened bran, using a\r\nlittle sugar in the water and stirring the paris-green into the bran\r\nvery thoroughly. If too wet, add more dry bran. It should crumble\r\nthrough the fingers. Sprinkle a little of this mixture with the fingers\r\nalong the row close to the plants. The cutworms eat this poisoned bran\r\nquite readily. Care must be exercised in using this poison lest poultry\r\nshould get at it. On the other hand, poultry should not be allowed to\r\nget into the garden. Wrapping a piece of paper around the stem when\r\ntransplanting young plants will help to save them from cutworms.\r\n\r\nROOT MAGGOTS\r\n\r\nRoot maggots of cabbage, radish, and onions are the larvae of flies\r\nsimilar in appearance to house-flies but a little smaller. When the\r\nplants are young, the flies lay their white eggs on the stem close to\r\nthe ground. When the eggs hatch, the larvae crawl down under the ground\r\nand cause the plants to decay. The wilting of the leaves is the first\r\nsign of the trouble. Prevention is better than cure in this case. Dust\r\nsome dry white hellebore along the rows of onions or radishes and around\r\nthe cabbage plants; or, for radishes, make a decoction of insect powder\r\n(Pyrethrum), four ounces to one gallon of water, and pour around the\r\nroot, using half a teacupful to each plant.\r\n\r\nFLEA-BEETLES\r\n\r\nThe turnip flea-beetle quickly destroys young plants of the cruciferae\r\nfamily by eating their leaves. Paris-green, one part to twenty parts of\r\npulverized gypsum (land plaster) dusted on the plants while damp, helps\r\nto destroy these insects.\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--When pupils who are absent find it impossible to give\r\nthe necessary attention to their garden plots at school, they should\r\nturn them over to other pupils or to the teacher, who may at his own\r\ndiscretion use the produce for purposes of general garden revenue.\r\n\r\nSEED GERMINATION\r\n\r\nThe seeds for the garden should be purchased quite early in the spring.\r\nAs the planting of poor seed is often the cause of much disappointment,\r\nit is well to test the germinating power of the different varieties to\r\nbe planted. The pupils of this Form should test especially those\r\nvarieties which they have chosen. To do this, place about twenty-five\r\nseeds in a germinating dish, which may be made as follows: Take a deep\r\nplate, such as a soup plate, fill it about half full of moist sand, and\r\nspread over this a piece of moist cloth. Put the seeds upon this cloth\r\nand cover them with a second piece of damp cloth or moss. To prevent\r\ndrying out invert over it another plate and set all in a warm dry place\r\n(about 70 to 80 degrees F.). After a few days count the number of seeds\r\nthat have germinated. This will be a guide in planting as to how thick\r\nthe seed should be sown.\r\n\r\nThe pupils should watch the development of germinating grains, such as\r\ncorn and beans, germinated in the same way as in the last exercise. The\r\nfollowing points may be observed:\r\n\r\n1. The first change noticed. (Swelling of the seed)\r\n\r\n2. The appearance of a growing shoot and its direction. (Root)\r\n\r\n3. The second shoot and its direction. (Stem)\r\n\r\n4. The appearance of the first pair of leaves.\r\n\r\n5. The appearance of root-hairs and rootlets.\r\n\r\n6. What becomes of the main body of the seed.\r\n\r\n7. How the second pair of leaves differs from the first pair.\r\n\r\n8. Length of time required to produce the first pair of leaves.\r\n\r\nPupils may be taught the conditions that are necessary for the\r\ngermination of seeds by means of a few simple experiments which can be\r\ncarried on in the school-room.\r\n\r\n1. In February, plant a few seeds of the pea, or oat, or wheat, in a box\r\nof soil, and place the box outside the school window.\r\n\r\n2. In April, plant a few seeds similar to those used in No. 1, in a box\r\nof perfectly dry soil, and set the box inside the school window.\r\n\r\n3. Plant a few seeds similar to those used in No. 1, in a jar containing\r\nsoil that is kept very wet, and set the jar in the school window.\r\n\r\n4. Plant a few seeds, similar to those used in No. 1. in a box\r\ncontaining soil that is moist but not wet, and set the box in the school\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n5. Plant seeds as in No. 4, except that the box is kept in a dark\r\ncupboard.\r\n\r\nCompare the results of the above with reference to:\r\n\r\n1. The number of seeds that germinate.\r\n\r\n2. The growth and condition of the plants.\r\n\r\nForm conclusions with reference to:\r\n\r\n1. The conditions that are required for seed germination.\r\n\r\n2. The benefits of well-drained soil.\r\n\r\nPupils make drawings showing the boxes and plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTS FOR INDIVIDUAL PLOTS\r\n\r\nThe pupils of this Form should not attempt to grow more than two\r\nvarieties of flowers and two of vegetables. Of flowers, mixed asters and\r\nShirley poppy are to be recommended, the poppy being an early blooming\r\nflower and the aster late blooming. Carrots and radishes are desirable\r\nvegetables, as the carrot matures late and the radish early. Two or\r\nthree crops of radishes may be grown on the same ground in one season.\r\nBesides these, a few others should be chosen for special study, such as\r\nthe potato, onion, corn, and sunflower.\r\n\r\nSTUDIES BASED ON OBSERVATIONS OF GROWING PLANTS\r\n\r\nAttention should be given to the growing habits of plants, the size and\r\nrate of development, the method of multiplying and propagation, and the\r\npart used for food. The potato is a tuber which is nothing more than\r\nthe swollen end of an underground stem; the onion a bulb composed of the\r\nbases of thickened leaves; the corn an example of a jointed stem or\r\ngrass having two kinds of flowers, the tassels being the staminate\r\nflowers and the cob with its silk the pistillate ones; the sunflower an\r\nexample of a compound flower made up of many little flowers each of\r\nwhich produces a single seed.\r\n\r\nObservations should also be made upon the progress in germination of the\r\nnuts and other tree seeds collected in the fall. When the seeds fall\r\nfrom the elms and soft maples in the spring, some of them should be\r\ncollected and planted in the forestry plot, or nursery.\r\n\r\nPLANTING AND CARE OF SWEET-PEAS\r\n\r\n1. Sow as early as possible in spring.\r\n\r\n2. Sow on well-drained land and never in the shade or near grass. Grass\r\nroots rob the sweet-pea roots of water.\r\n\r\n3. Use a small amount of fertilizer--well-rotted manure spaded deeply\r\ninto the soil. This is best done in the autumn.\r\n\r\n4. Make the trench in the fall about five or six inches deep.\r\n\r\n5. Plant in a trench in April from half an inch to an inch apart.\r\n\r\n6. Cover from three inches to four inches deep.\r\n\r\n7. Water thoroughly once or twice a week, and have the soil lower along\r\nthe row than farther out, so as to hold the water.\r\n\r\n8. Put a mulch of lawn clippings along the row on each side to prevent\r\ndrying out.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD FLOWERS\r\n\r\nArrange an excursion to the woods when the spring flowers are in bloom.\r\nKeep a flower calendar, showing:\r\n\r\n1. The date when a plant was first found in bloom\r\n\r\n2. The name of the plant\r\n\r\n3. Place where found\r\n\r\n4. Name of the pupil who found it.\r\n\r\nWhen in the woods discuss the following points:\r\n\r\n1. Why these wild flowers come into bloom so early in spring. They have\r\na large supply of food stored up from the previous summer.\r\n\r\n2. Dig down with a trowel or heavy knife and find this storehouse of\r\nfood. It may be in the form of bulb, corm, or rhizome.\r\n\r\n3. The blooming of the spring flowers in the woods before the leaves of\r\nthe trees reach their full development, thus taking advantage of the\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\n4. Mark a few clumps or individual plants and visit them again after a\r\nmonth. Look for the growing fruit with its seeds.\r\n\r\n5. The leaves of the hepatica seen at the time when the blossoms appear\r\nare leaves which grew the previous season. Dig up a plant and notice the\r\nnew leaves starting.\r\n\r\n6. The kind of soil each seems to grow best in and the amount of light\r\nit receives.\r\n\r\n7. Have the pupils examine the flowers and leave them growing. They\r\nshould gather a few for the school-room.\r\n\r\n8. Have the pupils write a short account of their visit to the woods.\r\nHave them make drawings of the different flowers collected.\r\n\r\nDig up a few specimens of wild flowers and transplant in a shady corner\r\nin the grounds or school garden. The following varieties are suggested\r\nfor special observation and study: hepatica, violet, anemone, columbine,\r\nIndian turnip, marsh marigold.\r\n\r\nTeach one or two lessons on wild flowers, similar to the lessons\r\nillustrated for the nasturtium.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEEDS\r\n\r\nPupils in this Form should learn to identify most of the weeds that are\r\nfound in the garden plots and a few of those commonly found in fields\r\nand along roadsides. The large bulletin _Farm Weeds_, published by the\r\nDominion Department of Agriculture, will be of great value in helping to\r\nidentify the weeds and also in gaining useful information regarding them\r\nand the best means of eradicating them.\r\n\r\nThe following species are recommended for special study during the\r\nseason: mustard (such varieties as are found in the vicinity), Canada\r\nthistle, purslane, lamb's quarter, pink-rooted pigweed, and quack grass.\r\nThe pupils should be familiar with the general appearance of the plant;\r\nits appearance when coming up in the spring; whether annual, biennial,\r\nor perennial; nature of the root, and whether hard to pull up; if hard\r\nto eradicate, why so; its rate of growth compared with the garden\r\nplants; the number of seeds produced by a single plant; how the seeds\r\nare scattered.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APPLE TREE\r\n\r\n(When the buds are beginning to open)\r\n\r\n\r\nFIELD EXERCISE\r\n\r\nThe pupils, during an excursion that is conducted by the teacher or\r\nwhile making individual observations, obtain answers to problems of the\r\nfollowing type:\r\n\r\nWhat is the shape of the top of the apple tree?\r\n\r\nAre all apple trees of the same shape?\r\n\r\nWhat is the height of the trunk?\r\n\r\nMeasure the girth of the trunk of the largest?\r\n\r\nAre the leaf buds and flower buds more numerous near the inside of the\r\ntree top or more numerous at the outer part of the top?\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--When discussing the answers to the above problems,\r\ndevelop the conception of the convenience of the low stature of the tree\r\nfor gathering the apples, of the wide-spreading branches for bearing a\r\nlarge crop, of the stoutness of the trunk for supporting the weight, and\r\nalso of the position of the buds as adapting them for securing sunshine.\r\n\r\nCLASS-ROOM LESSON ON THE APPLE TREE\r\n\r\n~Materials.~--Twigs bearing flower and leaf buds. These are gathered by\r\nthe pupils from the apple trees that were studied during the field\r\nexercises.\r\n\r\nEach pupil finds on his twig the objects and markings, etc., as in the\r\nfollowing outline:\r\n\r\nDescribe the shape of the twig.\r\n\r\nWhere were the apples that grew last year attached?\r\n\r\nDescribe the positions of the buds on the twigs.\r\n\r\nWhich buds are the larger, those at the end or those on the side of the\r\ntwig?\r\n\r\nDescribe the condition of the bud scales.\r\n\r\nOpen the buds and find what they contain.\r\n\r\nOf what use are the bud scales?\r\n\r\nHow many blossoms are in one bud?\r\n\r\nOf what use to the young leaves is the downy covering?\r\n\r\nFIELD EXERCISE FOLLOWING CLASS-ROOM LESSON\r\n\r\n(Just after the blossoms are fully open)\r\n\r\nWhat is the colour of the apple blossom?\r\n\r\nFind the little green cup on which the petals rest.\r\n\r\nDescribe the cup.\r\n\r\nFind the other things that are on the rim of, or that are within, the\r\ncup. What are they?\r\n\r\nWhat insects visit the flowers?\r\n\r\nDoes the cup fall off when the petals fall?\r\n\r\nDoes the cup close up as soon as the petals fall?\r\n\r\nWhat does the green cup grow to be?\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--Apple trees have somewhat round or pyramid-shaped\r\ntops, varying in detail with the variety of apple tree. The twigs are\r\nshort and usually crooked. The fruit twigs are called spurs. The buds at\r\nthe ends of the twigs and spurs are the largest and contain both leaves\r\nand blossoms, and there are usually several blossoms in each bud. The\r\nbud scales burst apart and drop off as the leaves and blossoms develop.\r\nThe side buds produce leaves only. The petals and pollen boxes are borne\r\non the rim of the green cup, and inside the cup are found the five tips\r\nof the seed cases. When the petals drop off, the rim of the cup remains\r\nspread out for a short time. This is the proper time for spraying, so\r\nthat the cup may hold a drop of poison to kill the tiny worms which\r\ncause apples to be wormy. It is the green cup that grows and forms the\r\nflesh of the apple.\r\n\r\nOrchard trees suitable for lessons for Form II are apple, plum, pear,\r\npeach, and cherry.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRD STUDY\r\n\r\nA valuable exercise in bird study, suitable for the pupils of Form II,\r\nis the study of a pair of birds and the history of their home through\r\nthe entire season.\r\n\r\nA record, with dates, should be kept, and the following topics are\r\nsuggested for observation:\r\n\r\nWhere the nest is located, protection of the nest, part of building done\r\nby each bird; eggs, number, colour, size, time required for hatching;\r\nyoung birds, number, description, how fed and upon what foods, time\r\nrequired before ready to leave the nest; history for a time after\r\nleaving the nest.\r\n\r\nBirds suitable for study by the pupils of Form II are the crow, flicker,\r\ndowny woodpecker, blue-bird, chipping-sparrow, phoebe, wren.\r\n\r\nCorrelate with art, by requiring drawings and models of the nest and its\r\nsurroundings, and with language, by having pupils write the history of\r\nthe nest and family.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TOAD\r\n\r\nFIELD EXERCISES\r\n\r\nDirect the pupils to watch for toads under the street lamps and on the\r\nlawns in the evenings, and to observe what they are doing.\r\n\r\nFind out, by turning over boards, logs of wood, stones, and old stumps,\r\nwhere toads spend the daytime.\r\n\r\nIf there is a sandy beach near by, an interesting nature lesson is to\r\ntrace a toad to its daytime retreat under a log or stone. Its wanderings\r\nand adventures during the night can be traced from the record that its\r\ntrail makes in the sand.\r\n\r\nAre toads that live in light-coloured sand of the same colour as those\r\nthat live in black clay? Of what value to the toad are these differences\r\nin colour?\r\n\r\nThe pupils are thus led to see that although the toad is not a handsome\r\nanimal, yet its rough, dark skin is of great value to it for concealment\r\namong the lumps of soil with which it harmonizes.\r\n\r\nCan a dog be induced to seize a toad? Will he seize it as readily a\r\nsecond time as he did the first? The secretion from the glands of the\r\ntoad have a biting, acid effect on the dog's mouth. This secretion will\r\nnot injure a person's hands unless the skin is broken, and even then it\r\ndoes not \"cause warts\".\r\n\r\nHow many toads can you find on your lawn in one evening? How many in the\r\nvegetable garden? How many in the flower beds?\r\n\r\nPlace a toad on loose soil among some weeds and observe how it proceeds\r\nto get out of sight.\r\n\r\nIs it true that a toad is attracted by music? Give reasons for your\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nCLASS-ROOM LESSON\r\n\r\nSecure a few living toads and keep them in a box covered with a pane of\r\nglass. Be sure to put moist soil and damp moss in the bottom of the box\r\nin which toads, frogs, newts, or snakes are kept. This enables these\r\nanimals to live in comfort, and they soon become sufficiently accustomed\r\nto their surroundings to act in a normal way.\r\n\r\n~Observation.~--By flicking in front of a toad a small feather or a bit of\r\nmeat attached to a thread, the darting out of the tongue for catching\r\nprey on its adhesive surface may be observed.\r\n\r\nThe children, by bringing slugs, caterpillars, grubs, and various\r\ninsects for the toads, may learn what composes the food of the animal.\r\nIt is to be observed that the toad does not snap at an object until it\r\nmoves.\r\n\r\nDETAILED STUDY\r\n\r\n~Observation.~--General shape; division into head, trunk, and limbs; size\r\nof head and mouth; position and structure of eyes and ears; difference\r\nin the size of the fore and hind limbs, and explanation of this\r\ndifference by references to the use of the limbs; the hind foot, uses of\r\nthe web; the glands on the surface of the body and their uses for\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nWhy is a large mouth useful? How are the ears fitted for life in water?\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the teacher should make sure that the pupils appreciate\r\nthe usefulness of the toad and also the beauty represented in its\r\nadaptations to its conditions of life. In these particulars the toad is\r\na good illustration of the adage \"Handsome is that handsome does\".\r\n\r\nLIFE HISTORY OF THE TOAD\r\n\r\nIn early spring look for the toads on the surface of the water in ponds.\r\nThe music of the toads at this time of year has been described by one\r\nnaturalist as \"one of the sweetest sounds of nature\".\r\n\r\nThe eggs may be found in these ponds at this time. They are attached to\r\nlong strings of jelly which entwine among grasses and other objects in\r\nthe ponds. (Frogs' eggs are in masses of jelly, not in strings.) Place\r\nsome of the eggs in a jar of water and set the jar in the window of the\r\nschool-room. A great mass of eggs is too much to put in a jar, a few\r\ndozen eggs in a pint of water will be more likely to develop. The water\r\nin the jar should be changed twice a week.\r\n\r\n~Observations.~--The light and dark areas of the eggs, the dark area\r\ngradually increasing in size; the increase in the length of the egg; the\r\ngradual change of the dark area into the general shape of a tadpole with\r\nhead and tail, the first appearance of the gills, the separation from\r\nthe jelly, the movement by means of the tail, the disappearance of the\r\ngills, the growth of the hind legs and, later, of the forelegs, and the\r\ndisappearance of the tail.\r\n\r\n~Questions and Observations.~--What is the use of the dark colour of the\r\narea from which the tadpole is formed?\r\n\r\nExplain the uses of the strings of jelly.\r\n\r\nDescribe how the tadpole swims.\r\n\r\nUpon what does the young tadpole feed?\r\n\r\nWhat is the advantage of external gills at this stage in the tadpole's\r\nlife?\r\n\r\n~Later Observations.~--The disappearance of the gills, the budding out of\r\nthe hind legs and, later, the forelegs. While the legs are growing out,\r\nthe tail gradually becomes smaller, at the same time the shape changes\r\nto that of the adult toad with a broad body and large mouth and eyes.\r\n\r\n~Questions.~--What movements has the toad which the tadpole did not have?\r\n\r\nWhat makes these movements possible?\r\n\r\nWhy is the mouth of the toad better suited to its manner of life than\r\nthe small mouth of the tadpole would be?\r\n\r\nOf what advantage to the tadpole was the smooth outline of its body, and\r\nwhy is the rougher outline of the toad's body better suited for the life\r\nof the latter?\r\n\r\nWhy would gills be unsuitable for the life of the toad?\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--From the dark area of the egg the tadpole develops,\r\nthe dark colour absorbs the sunlight, and this causes growth. The jelly\r\nholds the eggs up so that the sun can reach them and it also keeps them\r\nfrom being swept away by the water. The tadpole is very small, and\r\nexternal gills are needed to keep it in very close contact with the\r\nwater. The tail does not drop off, the substance in it is absorbed into\r\nthe body of the growing toad to serve as nutriment.\r\n\r\nSince all the changes in the development of the toad from egg to adult\r\nform take place in about one month, this comparatively rapid development\r\nmakes the life history of the toad particularly suitable for observation\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe development of the eggs of the frog or newt may be studied from\r\npreparations made in precisely the same way as those for the study of\r\nthe development of the toad.\r\n\r\nIf observations on the developments of two forms are carried on at one\r\ntime, interesting comparisons can be made on such points as, shape and\r\nsize of the eggs, time required for development, shapes and colours of\r\nthe tadpoles, activity of the tadpoles, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARTHWORM\r\n\r\n~Time.~--May or June, in connection with gardening, when the working of\r\nthe worms in the moist soil of the garden is quite noticeable.\r\n\r\nOutdoor studies may be assigned, as:\r\n\r\nObserve the loose soil at the entrance to the burrows. Insert a straw in\r\nthe burrow and, following it, dig downward with a garden trowel and\r\nlearn the nature of the earthworm's home.\r\n\r\nAre earthworms ever found out of their burrows during the day? If so, on\r\nwhat kind of days? Why do earthworms burrow deep in dry weather?\r\n\r\nEarthworms can breathe only when the surfaces of their bodies are in\r\nmoist conditions.\r\n\r\nGo out at night with a lantern to where earthworms are known to have\r\nburrows, observe the worms stretched out with the rear ends of their\r\nbodies attached to the burrows, and note how quickly they draw back when\r\nthey are touched. Do they draw back if the ground is jarred near them?\r\nDo they draw back when the light falls upon them?\r\n\r\nState the facts which are taught by the observations which were made on\r\nthe above topics.\r\n\r\nCLASS-ROOM LESSON\r\n\r\nPut two or three earthworms into a jar of rich, damp soil, on top of\r\nwhich there is a layer of sand a quarter of an inch thick. Put bits of\r\ncabbage, onion, grass, and other plants on the surface and cover the jar\r\nwith a glass slip or cardboard.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days, examine the jar, noting the number of burrows, the\r\nfoods selected, the castings, the food dragged into the burrows. Pour\r\nwater into the jar and observe the actions of the worms. Can an\r\nearthworm live in water?\r\n\r\nPlace an earthworm on a moist plate or board and direct the pupils to\r\nstudy it, as follows:\r\n\r\nDistinguish the head from the rear end, the upper from the lower\r\nsurface. Observe the means of living. To assist in the latter\r\nobservation, stroke the worm from rear to head and find the four double\r\nrows of bristles. Why is it difficult to pull an earthworm out of its\r\nburrow?\r\n\r\nFind the mouth. Has the earthworm any eyes, ears, or nose? Place a pin\r\nin the path of a moving worm and try to explain why it turns aside\r\nbefore touching the obstacle. Test the sensitiveness to feeling. Why is\r\nit cruel to put an earthworm on a fishhook?\r\n\r\nFrom the soil castings found in the jar, infer the value of earthworms\r\nfor enriching and pulverizing soil.

If it\r\nis not possible to secure either of these, a large glass jar, such as a\r\nbattery jar or large fruit jar, will be found to answer quite well.\r\n\r\nTo set up the aquarium, put into the jar about two inches of clean shore\r\nsand (sand from a sand pit, washed until the water comes away clear,\r\nwill do). Secure from a pond some water-plants, place these in the jar\r\nwith their roots covered with sand and secured in position by small\r\nstones. Pour in water until the jar is nearly full, taking care not to\r\nwash the roots out of place, and then put in a freshwater clam and a few\r\nwater snails. These are scavengers, for the clam feeds upon organisms\r\nthat float in the water, while the snails eat the green scum that grows\r\non the glass.\r\n\r\nThe other aquarium specimens may now be put in. One fish about three\r\ninches long to a gallon of water is about the right proportion. When\r\nthere is a sufficient quantity of plant life to keep the water properly\r\noxygenated and enough animal life to supply the carbon dioxide necessary\r\nto keep the plants growing well, the aquarium is said to be _balanced_.\r\n\r\nThe balanced aquarium does not require that the water be changed more\r\noften than once in two months.\r\n\r\nToo much direct sunlight causes too rapid growth of green slime, hence\r\nthe aquarium should not be set in a window. Close to a window through\r\nwhich the sun shines upon it for an hour or longer each day is the best\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nDo not supply more food to the animals in the aquarium than they can eat\r\nup clean.\r\n\r\nCrayfish, perch, trout, and other freshwater fishes are destructive of\r\ninsect larvae and other aquarium specimens, hence care must be taken in\r\nselecting the specimens that are put together into an aquarium.\r\n\r\nSuitable animals for the aquarium: mosquito larvae, dragon-fly larvae,\r\ncaddice-fly larvae, crayfish, clam, water snails, tadpoles, fish, frog,\r\nturtle.\r\n\r\n\r\nAQUARIUM SPECIMENS\r\n\r\nMOSQUITO\r\n\r\nTime.--May or June.\r\n\r\n~Questions and Observations.~--At what time of the year are mosquitoes\r\nmost plentiful? In what localities are they most plentiful? Why are\r\nthey most plentiful in these places? Are mosquitoes ever seen during\r\nfall or winter? How do you account for their rapid increase in number\r\nearly in summer?\r\n\r\nHow do mosquitoes find their victims? Observe the humming noise and try\r\nto discover how it is made.\r\n\r\nWatch a mosquito as it draws blood from your hand. Does the point of the\r\nbeak pierce the skin?\r\n\r\nCapture a number of mosquitoes and place them in a jar containing some\r\nwater and a few straws or sticks standing upright out of the water.\r\nCover the mouth of the jar with a glass plate or fine gauze. Watch for\r\nthe rafts of mosquitoes' eggs on the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nThe eggs may also be found on the surface of ponds or open rain barrels,\r\nand may be transferred to water in a jar in the laboratory.\r\n\r\nSTUDY OF THE ADULT FORM\r\n\r\nNote the shape, colour, sucking tube, wings, and legs. Compare with the\r\nhouse-fly.\r\n\r\nDistinguish the male insect from the female; the former has feathery\r\nfeelers, and has mouth parts unsuited for biting.\r\n\r\nHow many kinds of mosquitoes have you seen? Direct attention to the kind\r\nwhich causes the spread of malaria. It is recognized by its habit of\r\nstanding with its body pointing at right angles to the surface on which\r\nits feet are placed or, in other words, it appears to stand on its head.\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nDescribe the egg raft.\r\n\r\nObserve the wigglers (hatched in about a day); the divisions of the\r\nbody of the wigglers; position of the wigglers when at rest. Observe\r\nthat the tail end is upward. Lead the pupils to perceive that this is\r\nthe means of getting air.\r\n\r\nObserve the rapid movement toward the bottom when disturbed; the means\r\nof causing this movement; the change into the large-headed pupae--a\r\nchange which takes place about ten days after hatching; the almost\r\nmotionless character of the pupae; the change from the pupae forms into\r\nthe adult--a change which takes place at about the fourth day of pupae\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nPut some mosquito larvae (wigglers) into the fish aquarium. Are\r\nmosquitoes of any use? The wigglers are the food on which some young\r\nfishes live. Young bass and trout feed upon them.\r\n\r\nPut some kerosene on the surface of a jar in which there are mosquito\r\nlarvae. Describe a method of destroying mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nThe teacher tells about the mosquito as the cause of the spread of\r\nmalaria. From the fact that the eggs hatch on stagnant water, deduce a\r\nbenefit arising from the draining of land.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nSilcox and Stevenson: _Modern Nature Study_\r\n\r\nHodge: _Nature Study and Life_\r\n\r\nCADDICE-FLY\r\n\r\nTime: May.\r\n\r\nThe caddice-flies are very interesting insects, owing to the habits of\r\nthe larvae of building little cases of wood, stones, or shells, in which\r\nthey pass their development stages under water.\r\n\r\nThese larvae are easily found during the month of May in little streams\r\nof water everywhere throughout the Province. Look for what at first\r\nsight appears to be a bit of twig or a cylinder of stone about an inch\r\nlong moving along the bottom as though carried by currents. Closer\r\nobservation will result in the discovery that this is a little case\r\ncomposed of grains, of bits of stick, or of sand and tiny shells, and\r\nthe head of the occupant may be seen projecting from one end.\r\n\r\nCollect some of these larvae in a jar of water and transfer them to the\r\naquarium. Direct the pupils to look for others in the streams, so that\r\nthey may observe their appearances and movements in their natural\r\nenvironment. If kept in jars, the water must be changed every day, and\r\nthe top should be covered to prevent the escape of the adults.\r\n\r\n~Observe.~--The shape of the various kinds of cases; the materials, and\r\nhow fastened together (chiefly by silk); the part of the larva that\r\nprotrudes from the case; the movement, and how caused; the fitness of\r\nthe case as a protection. Note hardness, colour, and shape as protective\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nThe pupils will be fortunate if they observe the sudden rise of the\r\nlarva to the surface of the water and the almost instantaneous change\r\ninto the four-winged fly.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSECTS SUITABLE FOR LESSONS IN FORM II\r\n\r\nWalking-stick insect, katydid, cricket, mole-cricket, clothes-moth,\r\ngiant water-bug, potato beetle, click-beetle, luna moth, and\r\nswallow-tail butterfly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nFORM III\r\n\r\nAUTUMN\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN WORK\r\n\r\nThe pupils in this Form should be able to do all of the work required of\r\nthem in the garden without assistance. They should aim at intensive and\r\nthorough cultivation and, in the autumn, when the plants of their\r\ngardens ripen, these should be removed and the soil carefully spaded.\r\nThey should continue the work of selecting the seed from the best\r\nflowers, as indicated in the work for Form II, and should grow some seed\r\nfrom vegetables and perennials seen to be particularly good.\r\n\r\nBoys in this Form may also wish to do some gardening for profit. In some\r\ncases where there is plenty of space, this may be carried on in a part\r\nof the school garden set aside for that purpose. Usually, however, it\r\nwill be found most convenient to carry it on in the home garden. Best\r\nvarieties for local markets should then be grown and attention given to\r\nthe proper time and manner of marketing or storing for a later market.\r\nCool, well-ventilated cellars are best for most fruits and vegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF FUNGI\r\n\r\nDuring the summer and early autumn months attention should be given to\r\nthe spraying of plants for blight and for injurious insects. The potato\r\nis commonly affected by a fungous disease which causes the stalks to\r\nblacken and die before the tubers have matured. This disease may be\r\nprevented in large measure by the use of a fungicide known as Bordeaux\r\nmixture. This may be prepared as follows:\r\n\r\nTake one pound of copper sulphate (blue vitriol); make it fine by\r\npounding it in a bag or cloth and then dissolve it in water, using a\r\nwooden pail. It dissolves rapidly if put in a little cheese-cloth sack,\r\nwhich is suspended near the top of the pail by putting a stick across\r\nthe pail and tying the sack of copper sulphate to it. Dilute this\r\nsolution to five gallons. Take also a pound of unslaked or quick-lime\r\nand add a cupful of water to it. When it begins to swell up and get hot,\r\nadd more water slowly, and, when the action ceases, dilute to five\r\ngallons. Mix these two solutions together in a tub or barrel, and churn\r\nthem up, or stir them together vigorously. They give a deep\r\nrobin's-egg-blue mixture, which is slightly alkaline and should be used\r\nat once. The solutions can be kept separate as stock solutions\r\nthroughout the summer and then diluted and mixed whenever needed. Care\r\nshould be observed in not mixing the solutions before each has been\r\ndiluted to the strength, one pound to five gallons. A piece of blue\r\nlitmus paper will be convenient to prove that the mixture is alkaline.\r\nIf alkaline, as it should be, the paper remains blue when dipped in it.\r\nIf the mixture turns the litmus paper red, it must have more lime-water\r\nadded to make it alkaline. The potato tops should be thoroughly sprayed\r\nwith this mixture when about ten inches high and then once every two\r\nweeks, until they have been treated three or four times. This is to\r\nprevent blight and not to kill bugs. If the potato-beetle is troubling\r\nthe potatoes, add paris-green to the Bordeaux mixture--a teaspoonful to\r\nevery two gallons. To prove the value of this treatment have a trial\r\nplot of potatoes which receive all attention save spraying with Bordeaux\r\nmixture. If a heavy rain should follow the spraying, it should be\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nPotato-scab may be prevented to a large degree by soaking the tubers\r\nbefore cutting for planting in a solution of formalin (a 40-per cent.\r\nsolution of formaldehyde) one-half pint to fifteen gallons of water.\r\nSeed grain is frequently treated this way before sowing, to destroy smut\r\nspores. A pound of formalin is put in forty gallons of water in a large\r\nbarrel. A bag full of the grain to be treated is set in the barrel of\r\nformalin mixture for about two hours and then taken and dried on a floor\r\nthat has been previously washed with water containing formalin. A\r\nsolution of copper sulphate (bluestone), one pound in twenty gallons of\r\nwater is sometimes used. The grain is left in this solution for twelve\r\nhours and then dried for sowing. All bags and utensils should also be\r\ndisinfected with this formalin solution.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF INSECTS\r\n\r\nIn order to poison insects successfully, it is necessary to determine\r\nhow the insect feeds. If it is a biting insect, that is one that eats\r\nthe leaf, such as the potato beetle, paris-green should be used.\r\nParis-green sometimes burns the tender leaves. This may be prevented by\r\nadding a tablespoonful of lime to each pail of water used. It may also\r\nbe used dry with flour or dust.\r\n\r\nIf the insect feeds by sucking the juices from the leaf, as is the case\r\nwith plant-lice, then a solution that kills by contact must be used,\r\nsuch as whale-oil soap, one ounce to a quart of water. Tobacco-water is\r\nsometimes mixed with the soap solution as follows:\r\n\r\nFour pounds of tobacco-waste is steeped in nine gallons of hot water for\r\nfive hours; this is then strained, and to the tobacco-water one pound of\r\nwhale-oil soap dissolved in one gallon of hot water is added and mixed\r\nthoroughly.\r\n\r\nKerosene emulsion, which is made as follows, is very destructive to\r\nplant-lice and scale insects:\r\n\r\nDissolve a quarter of a pound of common laundry soap in half a gallon of\r\nrain-water and, while hot, mix with one gallon of coal-oil and churn\r\nvigorously for five minutes to get a smooth, creamy mixture. On cooling,\r\nit thickens and is diluted before using by adding nine quarts of warm\r\nwater to one quart of the emulsion. Use smaller quantities in correct\r\nproportions when only a few plants are to be treated.\r\n\r\nCABBAGE-WORM\r\n\r\nThe larvae of the cabbage-butterfly sometimes do a great deal of harm by\r\neating the cabbage leaves. It will not do to use paris-green on cabbage,\r\nas the leaves are for eating. Instead, use pyrethrum or insect powder,\r\nwhich may be diluted by mixing with cheap flour--one ounce of insect\r\npowder to five of flour. Mix thoroughly and leave in a closed tin over\r\nnight. Dust the mixture on the leaves from a cheese-cloth bag by tapping\r\nwith a small stick or from a dusting-pan. If used while the dew is on\r\nthe leaves, it sticks better. Insect powder is not poisonous to man as\r\nis paris-green, and so may be used freely on cabbage or other similar\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTS\r\n\r\nANNUALS, BIENNIALS, AND PERENNIALS\r\n\r\nCLASS-ROOM LESSON\r\n\r\nBy means of questions based upon the pupils' knowledge of a few common\r\nannuals, such as the oat, sweet-pea, and garden aster, develop the\r\nfollowing points:\r\n\r\n1. These plants are always grown from seeds.\r\n\r\n2. These plants produce flowers and ripe seeds during one season's\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n3. These plants wither and die in the autumn.\r\n\r\nPlants having these characteristics are called _annuals_. The teacher\r\nexplains the meaning of the word and requires the pupils to name a few\r\nother annuals.\r\n\r\nIn a similar way, discuss a few common types of _biennials_, such as\r\nturnip, cabbage, hollyhock, and develop the following points:\r\n\r\n1. These plants produce no flowers and seeds during the first year of\r\ntheir life.\r\n\r\n2. These plants, during the first year, lay up a store of food in roots,\r\nleaves, or stems.\r\n\r\n3. The food is used in the second year of the plant's life to nourish\r\nthe flowers and seeds.\r\n\r\nA biennial should be grown for two years in the school garden to furnish\r\nmaterial for concrete study.\r\n\r\nIn a similar way discuss a few common types of _perennials_, such as\r\nrhubarb, dahlia, apple tree, and develop the following points:\r\n\r\n1. These plants may or may not produce seeds during the first year's\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n2. Some of these plants are herbs, but most of them are trees and\r\nshrubs.\r\n\r\n3. Food is stored in roots or stems to provide for early spring growth.\r\n\r\n4. These plants live on from year to year.\r\n\r\nGARDEN STUDIES\r\n\r\nANNUALS\r\n\r\n~Observations.~--Some plants, such as poppy and candy-tuft, are early\r\nblooming, while others, such as aster and cosmos, bloom in late summer,\r\nhence a selection should be made that will yield a succession of bloom\r\nthroughout the season.\r\n\r\nSome are hardy annuals which can be grown from open planting, even when\r\nthe weather is cold. These often seed themselves; for example,\r\nsweet-pea, morning-glory, phlox, poppy, sweet-alyssum.\r\n\r\nSome are half-hardy annuals, such as asters, balsams, stocks, and\r\nnasturtiums. These must be started indoors or in hotbeds, or if in\r\nplots, not until the soil is quite warm.\r\n\r\nThe heights of annuals vary, and consequently they must be arranged in\r\nthe bed in such a way that tall plants will not shade the short ones.\r\n\r\nBIENNIALS\r\n\r\n~Observations.~--During the first year food is stored in the root of the\r\nturnip, carrot, parsnip, and beet, in the leaves of the cabbage, and in\r\nthe stem of the hollyhock.\r\n\r\nFlowers and seeds are produced during the second year, and the\r\nstorehouse becomes empty, dry, and woody. Preparation for winter is\r\ntherefore, in the case of biennials, preparation for a renewal of growth\r\nthe following spring.\r\n\r\nPERENNIALS\r\n\r\n~Observations.~--The highest forms of plant life are found in this class;\r\nnamely, the strong, large, hardy trees and shrubs.\r\n\r\nThe herbaceous perennials are equipped with underground parts that act\r\nas storehouses of food to ensure the growth of the plant through\r\nsuccessive seasons. Examples: the roots of dahlia, rhubarb, dandelion,\r\nand chicory; the underground stems of potato, onion, tulip,\r\nscutch-grass, Canada thistle, etc.\r\n\r\nMany of the wild flowers that bloom in early spring belong to this\r\nclass, and their rapid growth then is made possible by the store of food\r\nin the underground parts. Examples: trillium, bloodroot, squirrel-corn,\r\nIndian turnip, Solomon's seal, etc.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL STUDY OF GARDEN PLANTS\r\n\r\nA few plants should be selected for special study, and the following are\r\nrecommended: annuals--sweet-pea, pumpkin, and corn; biennials--cabbage,\r\nparsnip, and carrot; perennials--dahlia, rhubarb, and couch-grass.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable that the observations be made upon the plants in the\r\ngarden, but they may be conducted in the class-room upon specimens\r\nbrought into the room by the pupils.\r\n\r\nSWEET-PEA\r\n\r\nExamine the stem of the sweet-pea and describe its form, its uniform\r\nslender structure, and the fact that it climbs. Find out just how it\r\nclimbs. The pupils will observe the tendrils, which are extensions of\r\nthe midribs of the leaves.\r\n\r\nDescribe the leaves, noting what is meant by calling them _compound_.\r\n\r\nObserve the position of the flower, its colours, odour, size, and form.\r\nWhat insect does it resemble in shape? What different features of the\r\nflower enable it to attract attention?\r\n\r\nThe names and uses of the floral organs may be taught to this class. For\r\nexample:\r\n\r\nPupils find the green blanket that protects the bud. This is the\r\n_calyx_.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful, attractive part is the _corolla_.\r\n\r\nThe parts that produce the pollen are called _stamens_.\r\n\r\nThe case that holds the seeds is the _pistil_.\r\n\r\nExamine flowers of different ages and trace the change from the minute\r\npistil to the pod.\r\n\r\nStudy, comparatively, the flowers of the field-pea, bean, or wild vetch.\r\n\r\nSelect a few of the finest blossoms of the sweet-pea and put tags on\r\nthem while they are still in bloom. When they ripen, collect the seeds\r\nand preserve them for spring planting.\r\n\r\nConduct observation lessons on the pumpkin and corn, in which the pupils\r\nwill discover such facts as those given below.\r\n\r\nPUMPKIN\r\n\r\nNotice the method of growth--the stem no stronger than that of the\r\nsweet-pea, but lying flat on the ground. Notice the little roots sent\r\nout here and there where the stem touches the ground. This gives extra\r\nnourishment. The leaves are not numerous and grow only in one direction,\r\nbut are very large--entirely too large to be borne upon an upright stem.\r\nNotice the large funnel-like flowers and that not all of them set fruit.\r\nExamine the flowers. Some of them have stamens for producing pollen, but\r\nno pistil. These never produce fruit, for pumpkins are simply enlarged\r\nand ripened pistils. Look for insects and examine them to find out\r\nwhether they are carrying pollen. Notice younger pumpkins and even\r\nblossoms toward the end of the vine. Pick all the blossoms and small\r\npumpkins off a vine, leaving only one of the best growing pumpkins. See\r\nwhether this one grows larger than one of equal age on a vine having\r\nyoung pumpkins developing on it. Notice the arrangement of the seeds\r\ninside a ripe pumpkin. Collect some seeds, wash clean, and dry for\r\nspring planting. It is desirable to plant pumpkins late in May, so that\r\nthey will have flowers on their vines as late as September.\r\n\r\nStudy the flowers of the cucumber and compare them with those of the\r\npumpkin.\r\n\r\nCORN\r\n\r\nThis plant is native to America, was greatly prized by the aborigines,\r\nand even worshipped by some of them. Note the upright character of the\r\nplant and how the stalk is divided into sections by the joints, or\r\nnodes. Count these joints and also the leaves, and note the relationship\r\nof leaves and joints in the stalk, and how the leaves come off in\r\ndifferent directions so as not to shade each other. Note the strong,\r\nstringy threads in the leaf, which give strength to the leaf as well as\r\ncirculation of sap. They are strong and elastic, allowing of movement.\r\nThe same strengthening fibres are seen in the stalk when it is broken\r\nacross. In the stalk these fibres are arranged in a tubular form, as\r\nthis gives greatest strength, the centre being soft and weak. The stalks\r\nare largest near the base, where the greatest stiffness is required. The\r\nnodes are also closer together here for strength. The stem is made much\r\nstronger by the bases of the leaves being wrapped so firmly around for a\r\ndistance above the point of attachment at the node. Notice the\r\nclose-fitting sheath or rain-guard, where the blade of the leaf leaves\r\nthe stalk. This prevents rain soaking down inside the leaf sheath, but\r\nlets it run down the outside to the root where it is needed. As the\r\nplant gets older and taller, new roots come out from the node next above\r\nthe root and sometimes from the second node above. These prop-roots are\r\nneeded for support as the stalk lengthens, and they also reinforce the\r\nfeeding capacity.\r\n\r\nNote the appearance of little cobs in the axils of the leaves. As soon\r\nas the silk appears, take a cob off and open it carefully. The little\r\ncob, which corresponds to the pistil in other plants, is covered with\r\nsmall and undeveloped kernels, and to each kernel one of the strands of\r\nso-called silk is attached. Whilst this little cob is forming, a bunch,\r\nor tassel, of flowers is forming on the top of the corn plant. Open one\r\nof these flowers and find the stamens with pollen-grains inside. This\r\npollen, when shed, falls upon the silk, and each grain sends a tiny tube\r\ndown inside the silk to the delicate ovules on the cob, fertilizing them\r\nand starting them to develop. The silk then withers. The wind carries\r\nthis pollen.\r\n\r\nFind out how the silk is fitted for catching the pollen. What is the\r\nneed for the great quantity of pollen that the plant produces?\r\n\r\nStrip off the husks and compare the tough, hard husks that are found on\r\nthe outside with the soft paper-like husks found close to the cob. Show\r\nhow each kind is fitted for its particular work.\r\n\r\nPupils make experiments in the corn plot to find:\r\n\r\n1. Whether the corn grows faster:\r\n\r\n(1) When the soil is kept mellow or when the soil is hard;\r\n\r\n(2) When the days are warm or when they are cool;\r\n\r\n(3) When the nights are cool or when they are warm.\r\n\r\n2. The effect of growing black corn and golden corn in the same or in\r\nadjoining plots. Account for the result.\r\n\r\nCORRELATIONS\r\n\r\nArt: Clay-modelling and drawing exercises on the whole plant, and also\r\nupon the ear.\r\n\r\nLiterature: Interpretation and reading of \"Blessing the Corn-fields\",\r\nfrom _Hiawatha_.\r\n\r\nHistory: The name Indian corn originated in the early colonial days of\r\nthe Eastern and Central States, when the pioneers obtained corn from the\r\nIndians. The Indians showed the settlers how to kill the trees by\r\ngirdling and how to plant the corn among the standing trunks, and thus\r\nhave corn ready for roasting by August, and for grinding into meal or\r\nfor boiling to make hominy by September.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEED DISPERSAL\r\n\r\nThe lessons on seed dispersal which were begun in Form I should be\r\ncontinued in this Form.\r\n\r\nI. LESSON\r\n\r\nSelect a few weeds belonging to species which produce large numbers of\r\nseeds, such as wild mustard, white cockle, false-flax, etc. Distribute\r\nthe seed pods among the pupils of the class and require them to estimate\r\nthe number of seeds produced by each plant.\r\n\r\nBy references to observations made in the garden, help the pupils to\r\nrecall the bad results, both to parent plants and to young seedlings, of\r\nimproper scattering of seeds, namely:\r\n\r\n1. The excessive crowding and shading, which causes the plants to become\r\nweak.\r\n\r\n2. Insufficient food and moisture for the large number of plants, which\r\ncauses the plants to be small and worthless.\r\n\r\nDiscuss how the crowding of cultivated plants is prevented and, in a\r\ngeneral way, how nature provides for the scattering of seeds.\r\n\r\nThe great work of the plant is the production and dispersal of its\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\nAsk the pupils to be on the alert to find examples of plants in which\r\nprovision is made for the dispersal of the seeds, and to bring these\r\nplants to the class for the next lesson.\r\n\r\nDETAILED STUDY OF SEED DISPERSAL\r\n\r\nII. CLASS-ROOM LESSON\r\n\r\nMake use of the specimens gathered by the pupils and by the teacher for\r\nobserving and classifying as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Seeds that steal rides. Examples--burdock, blue burr, pitch-fork\r\nweed, barley, stick-tight, hound's tongue.\r\n\r\n2. Seeds that are carried in edible fruits which have attractive\r\ncolours, tastes, etc. Examples--apple, grape, cherry, rowan, hawthorn.\r\n\r\n3. Seeds that are carried by the wind. Examples--dandelion, thistle,\r\nmilkweed, maple, pine, elm.\r\n\r\n4. Seeds that are scattered by being shot from bursting pods.\r\nExamples--violet, jewel-weed (touch-me-not), sweet-pea, witch-hazel.\r\n\r\n5. Seeds that are scattered by plants which are rolled along by the\r\nwind. Examples--Russian thistle, tumble-mustard, tumble-grass.\r\n\r\n6. Seeds that float. Very many seeds float, although not specially\r\nfitted for floating, and some, such as the cocoa-nut and water-lily, are\r\nespecially adapted for dispersal by water.\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--Require the pupils to observe the special structure\r\nthat facilitates the dispersal of the seed. As an illustration, ask the\r\npupils to find the seeds of the burdock and to describe what the burr is\r\nreally like. They find that the burr is a little basket filled with\r\nseeds. The basket has many little hooks which catch on the hair of\r\nanimals and, since these hooks turn inwards, they serve to hold the\r\nbasket in such a position that all the seeds are not likely to drop out\r\nat one time. The pupils should also observe that these baskets are quite\r\nfirmly attached to the parent plant until the seeds are ripe; after that\r\nthe baskets break off the plant at the slightest pull.\r\n\r\nSEED COLLECTIONS\r\n\r\nDuring late summer and in the autumn the seeds of the weeds that have\r\nbeen identified by the pupils should be collected.\r\n\r\nInstruct the pupils to rub the ripened seed pods between the hands until\r\nthe seeds are thrashed out, at the same time blowing away the chaff. The\r\nseeds are now placed in small phials or in small envelopes and these are\r\ncarefully labelled. If possible, fill each phial so that there may be\r\nsufficient seed for use by all the members of the class in the lessons\r\non seed description and identification which are to be taken during the\r\nwinter months, when Nature Study material is less plentiful than it is\r\nin the summer and autumn. The phials or envelopes may be stored in a\r\nshallow box, or the phials may be mounted on a stout card. They may be\r\nattached to this card either by stout thread sewed through the card and\r\npassing around the phial, or by brass cleats, which may be obtained with\r\nthe phials from dealers in Nature Study supplies.\r\n\r\nMAN AS A DISPERSER OF SEEDS\r\n\r\nMan as an agent in the dispersal of seeds should be made a topic for\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nObtain, through the pupils, samples of seed-grain, clover seed, timothy\r\nseed, turnip seed, etc. Ask the pupils to examine these and count the\r\nnumber of weed seeds found in each.\r\n\r\nThe results will reveal a very common way in which the seeds of noxious\r\nweeds are introduced.\r\n\r\nDescribe the introduction from Europe to the wheat-fields of the Prairie\r\nProvinces of such weeds as Russian thistle, false-flax, French-weed. The\r\nseeds of these weeds were carried in seed-grain, fodder for animals, and\r\nalso in the hay and straw used by the immigrants as packing for their\r\nhousehold goods.\r\n\r\nCareful farmers will not allow thrashing-machines, seed drills,\r\nfanning-mills, etc., to come from farms infested with noxious weeds to\r\ndo work upon their farms, nor will they buy manure, straw, or hay that\r\nwas produced on dirty farms.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUGAR MAPLE\r\n\r\nFIELD EXERCISES\r\n\r\nSelect a convenient sugar maple as a type. Ask the pupils to observe and\r\nto describe the height of the tree, the height of the trunk below the\r\nbranches, the shape and size of the crown, the diameter of the trunk,\r\nthe colour of the bark, the markings on the bark, the number and\r\ndirection of the branches, and the density of the foliage. Compare the\r\ndensity of the foliage with that of other kinds of trees. Require the\r\npupils to make a crayon drawing of the tree.\r\n\r\nExamine the crop of grain produced near a shade tree. Compare the crop\r\non the north side of the tree with that on the south side. Account for\r\nthe difference.\r\n\r\nIs the crop around the tree inferior to that in the rest of the field?\r\n\r\nFind out how long the various sugar maple shade trees in the locality\r\nhave been planted. Is it a tree of rapid or slow growth? Are these sugar\r\nmaples infested with insects or attacked by fungi?\r\n\r\nDo these trees yield sap that is suitable for making maple syrup?\r\n\r\nExamine trees that have been tapped and find whether the old wounds\r\nbecome overgrown or cause decay.\r\n\r\nFind out all you can about the uses that are made of maple wood.\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--The sugar maple is the most highly prized of our\r\nnative trees for ornament and shade. It grows fairly rapidly and\r\nbecomes a goodly-sized tree within twenty years after it is planted. The\r\nsymmetrical dome-shaped crown and the dense foliage of restful dark\r\ngreen give to it a fine appearance. It is hardy and has few insect\r\npests, and its value is enhanced by the abundant yield of rich sap.\r\n\r\nAs a commercial tree it has few superiors; the wood is hard and durable\r\nand takes a high polish. It is used for flooring, furniture, boat\r\nbuilding, for the wooden parts of machinery and tools, and for making\r\nshoe-pegs and shoe lasts. As fuel maple wood is surpassed only by\r\nhickory.\r\n\r\nMAPLE LEAVES\r\n\r\nCLASS-ROOM LESSON\r\n\r\nThe pupils bring to the class leaves of the sugar maple. Each pupil is\r\nprovided with a leaf and makes direct observations under the guidance of\r\nthe teacher.\r\n\r\n~Observations.~--Colour, dark green on the upper surface, lighter green on\r\nthe lower surface. Surface smooth and shiny.\r\n\r\nShape: star-shaped, broader than long.\r\n\r\nLobes: usually five, often three; each lobe has usually two large teeth.\r\n\r\nBase has a heart-shaped notch; petiole long and slender, usually red.\r\n\r\nVeins are stiff and run out to the points of the teeth.\r\n\r\nDistribute leaves of the _red_ maple and ask the pupils to note the\r\ngeneral resemblance. Next ask them to compare the leaves as to shape,\r\ntexture, and teeth on the margin.\r\n\r\nAsk the pupils to find red maple trees and also to find maples with\r\nleaves that are different from those of the red maple and those of the\r\nsugar maple.\r\n\r\nMake a collection of maple leaves when they are in autumn colours. (See\r\nCollections, page 33, in General Method.)\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--The leaves of the red maple are longer than broad,\r\nand are not so smooth and shiny as the leaves of the sugar maple. There\r\nare numerous \"saw teeth\" on the margins of the lobes. The silver maple,\r\nwith leaves having silver-white under surfaces, is another common\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nA lesson similar to that on leaf studies may be based on the fruits\r\n(keys) of the maples.\r\n\r\nThe oak, ash, elm, beech, or birch may be taken up in lessons similar to\r\nthose outlined for the study of the maple.\r\n\r\nCORRELATIONS\r\n\r\nWith literature and reading: By interpreting \"The Maple\", _The Ontario\r\nReaders, Third Book_, page 179;\r\n\r\nWith art: By sketching the tree and reproducing the autumn leaves in\r\ncolour work.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEED STUDIES\r\n\r\nIn every locality there are about a dozen weeds that are particularly\r\ntroublesome, and the pupils of Form III should be taught to identify\r\nthese and to understand the characteristics which make each weed\r\npersistent.\r\n\r\nTo produce these results it will be necessary to have exercises such as\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n1. The teacher exhibits a weed to the pupils and directs their attention\r\nto a few of the outstanding features of the plant.\r\n\r\n2. The pupils are required, as a field exercise, to observe where the\r\nweed is abundant; and whether in hay field, pasture, hoe crop, or in\r\ngrain. The pupils will bring specimens to the class.\r\n\r\n3. Detailed study in the class of specimens of the weed brought by the\r\npupils to find offensive odours and prickles, also the character of the\r\nleaves, flowers, seed pods, and seeds, including the means of dispersal;\r\nthe underground parts, whether underground stem, tap-root, or fibrous\r\nroot, and the value of the underground parts as a means of persistence.\r\n\r\n4. The pupils make a collection of the weeds that have been studied.\r\n(See Plant Collection, page 39, in General Method.)\r\n\r\n5. The pupils make collections of the seeds of the weeds that have been\r\nstudied.\r\n\r\nOBSERVATION LESSON ON WEED SEEDS\r\n\r\nThe seed of a weed should always be exhibited and studied in association\r\nwith a fresh or a mounted specimen of the weed.\r\n\r\nEach pupil should use a hand lens in examining the seed.\r\n\r\nThe pupils examine the seed of each species and describe it according to\r\nthe following scheme:\r\n\r\nNAME OF SEED\r\n\r\n    _Colour:_\r\n    _Size:_ (in fractions of an inch)\r\n    _Shape:_\r\n    _Details:_\r\n    _Occurrence:_\r\n\r\nThe results of the pupils' study of the ox-eye daisy would then appear\r\nin the following form:\r\n\r\nSEED OF OX-EYE DAISY\r\n\r\n    _Colour:_ Black and greenish-white in stripes,\r\n    _Size:_ One sixteenth of an inch,\r\n    _Shape:_ Club-shaped,\r\n    _Details_: Grooved lengthwise, yellow peg in large end,\r\n    _Occurrence:_ A common impurity in grass seed.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRASSHOPPER\r\n\r\n     (Consult the Manual on _Suggestions for Teachers of\r\n     Science_: Zoology, First year.)\r\n\r\nThe ease with which this insect may be obtained in August or September,\r\ntogether with its fairly large size, makes it a suitable specimen for\r\ninsect study. It is also a typical insect, so that a careful study\r\nserves as a basis for a knowledge of the class _insecta_.\r\n\r\nFIELD EXERCISES\r\n\r\nProblems to be assigned for outdoor observation: Locomotion by flying,\r\nleaping, walking; protective coloration and habit of \"lying low\"; its\r\nbehaviour when caught; in what kinds of fields it is most plentiful; in\r\nwhat kinds of weather it is most active; its position on the grass or\r\ngrain when feeding; the nature and extent of the damage done by it.\r\n\r\nUse a class period for discussion of the above. Confirm, correct, or\r\nincite to more careful observation.\r\n\r\nCLASS-ROOM LESSON\r\n\r\n(Studied as a typical insect)\r\n\r\n~Observations.~--The three divisions of the body--head, thorax, abdomen;\r\nthe segmental division of the two latter parts; the hard, protecting\r\ncovering; the movements of the abdomen; the two large compound eyes and\r\nthree small eyes; the feelers; the two pairs of mouth feelers; the\r\ncutting mandibles; the three pairs of legs (one pair for leaping) and\r\ntwo pairs of wings on the thorax; the breathing pores, the ears,\r\novipositors of the female.\r\n\r\nThe young grasshoppers may be found in spring or early summer, and a few\r\neven in late summer, among the grass of old meadows and pastures. They\r\nare easily recognized because of their general resemblance to the adult\r\nand are in the stage of development called the _nymph_ phase. Note the\r\nhairy body and the absence of wings.\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--The moulting of the nymph is a very interesting\r\nprocess to observe and so is the laying of the eggs by the female in a\r\nburrow that she prepares in the soil. If females secured in July are\r\nkept in a jar having two inches of soil in the bottom, they will lay\r\ntheir eggs in the soil; the nests and eggs may then be taken up and\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\nIn order that we may not destroy our friends and helpers, it is\r\nexpedient to know what creatures help to hold pests in check.\r\n\r\nThe enemies of grasshoppers are birds and insect parasites. Under the\r\nwings of grasshoppers may frequently be found little red mites; these\r\nkill the grasshoppers to which they are attached. The blister-beetles\r\nlay their eggs in the grasshoppers' nests, and the larvae of the beetles\r\nfeed upon and destroy the eggs.\r\n\r\nThe birds that are especially useful in destroying grasshoppers are the\r\nmeadow-lark, crow, bobolink, quail, grasshopper sparrow.\r\n\r\nThe curious hairlike worms known to the school boys as \"hair snakes\"\r\nbecause of the belief that they are parts of horse hairs turned into\r\nsnakes, are worms that pass the early part of their life within the\r\nbodies of grasshoppers and, when the insects die, the worms escape and\r\nare washed by rains into troughs and ponds where their movements attract\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nStudy the cricket and house-fly and compare the cricket with the\r\ngrasshopper.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPHIDES\r\n\r\nIn September obtain leaves of sweet-pea, apple, rose bush, maple, oak,\r\nturnip, etc., on which the insects are feeding; also provide specimens\r\nof woolly aphides on the bark of apple trees or stems of goldenrod or\r\nalder.\r\n\r\nObserve the nature of the injury to the leaves and plants on which these\r\ninsects feed.\r\n\r\nDo the insects bite the leaves or suck the juices? Give evidence in\r\nsupport of your answer.\r\n\r\nSprinkle paris-green on the leaves; does this kill the insects? Why does\r\nit not? Spray the insects with a little oil, such as kerosene, or with\r\nwater in which the stub of a cigar has been soaked; what is the effect?\r\n\r\nInsects that suck juices from inside the leaf escape the poisoning from\r\nsolutions in the leaf surfaces; such insects are killed by oils which\r\nenter the breathing pores and cause poisoning.\r\n\r\nSearch in the garden, orchard, and forest for plants attacked by\r\naphides. Carefully observe the lady-birds that are frequently found\r\nwhere there are aphides. Lady-birds (also called lady-bugs), are small,\r\nspotted beetles, broad oval in form, of bright colours, red and black,\r\nor yellow and black, or black and white.\r\n\r\nThey are of great service to the farmer and gardener because their foods\r\nconsists largely of plant-lice (aphides).\r\n\r\nWatch the action of ants which are found among the aphides. The ants may\r\nbe observed stroking the aphides with their feelers, causing the aphides\r\nto excrete a sweet fluid on which the ant feeds. Aphides are sometimes\r\ncalled ant-cows.\r\n\r\nDirect the attention of the pupils to the difference between the male\r\nand female aphides; the males have wings, but the females are wingless.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATO WORM\r\n\r\nTHE ADULT\r\n\r\nThe adult moth may be captured on spring evenings when the lilacs are in\r\nbloom, as it buzzes about among the lilac blossoms sucking their honey.\r\nIt is frequently mistaken for the humming-bird when thus engaged. It may\r\nalso be observed during the summer evenings laying its eggs on the\r\nleaves of tomato vines.\r\n\r\nObserve the worms that hatch from these eggs and note their rapid\r\ngrowth. Keep the larvae in a box in the school-room and feed them on\r\ntomato leaves. Note their size and colour, the oblique stripes on the\r\nsides, the horn which is used for terrifying assailants, the habit of\r\nremaining rigid for hours--hence the name sphinx moth.\r\n\r\nThe larvae burrow into the ground in September to form the chrysalides,\r\nhence there should be soil in the vivarium in which they are kept.\r\n\r\nTHE CHRYSALIS\r\n\r\n~Observations.~--The shape, colour, nature of the covering, the long\r\nhandle, the wing impressions, the segmental part, the emergence of the\r\nadult in May or early June.\r\n\r\nWhat organ of the insect was contained in the \"handle\" of the chrysalis?\r\n\r\nThe adult is one of the handsomest of moths, because of its graceful,\r\nclear-cut shape and the variegated grays and yellows of its dress. Look\r\non poplar, cotton-wood, plum, and pine trees, and on tobacco plants for\r\nrelatives of the tomato worm, the large green larvae whose chrysalis and\r\nadult forms resemble those of the tomato worm.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CROW\r\n\r\nCrows are so plentiful that there will be no difficulty in making\r\nobservations on the living birds in the free state in spring or summer.\r\n(As the crow is a bird that is easily tamed, it may be possible to have\r\na tame crow in the class-room for more careful study of the details of\r\nstructure.)\r\n\r\n~Observations.~--Describe its attitude when perched, movements of the\r\nwings in flight, speed of flight. Why does the crow perch high up in\r\ntrees? What gives to the crow its swift flight?\r\n\r\nStudy the various calls of the crow and note the alarm, threat, summons,\r\nand expression of fear.\r\n\r\nFind the nest and note its position, size, build, materials, eggs, and\r\nyoung. How is the nest concealed? What makes it strong?\r\n\r\nAre crows often seen on the ground? Do they walk or hop?\r\n\r\nObserve and report on the crow's habits of feeding. It eats corn,\r\npotatoes, oats, beetles, crickets, grasshoppers, cutworms, and\r\noccasionally birds' eggs or young birds.\r\n\r\nWhy do king-birds chase and thrash the crow? Are scarecrows effective in\r\nkeeping crows off the grain fields?\r\n\r\nNote the sentinels that are on the watch to warn other crows of danger.\r\n\r\nGive reasons for the belief that the crow is a wise bird.\r\n\r\nGive reasons for regarding the crow as a neighbour of doubtful\r\ncharacter. Give reasons why crows should be protected.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Crows will not pull up corn and seed that has been covered with\r\ncoal-tar before it is planted.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the animals already named, the musk-rat, raccoon, fox,\r\nflying-squirrel, robin, wren, and king-bird will be found convenient for\r\nstudy in many localities.\r\n\r\nThe swimming of the musk-rat, and how its shape, fur, feet, and tail fit\r\nit for a life in water are topics suitable for observational exercises,\r\nas are also its food, its winter home, and the burrows leading from the\r\nwater into the banks. In the case of the winter home, the location, the\r\nstructure, the submerged entrance, the living-room, and the surrounding\r\nmoat, are topics of interest.\r\n\r\nCORRELATIONS\r\n\r\nWith literature: By reading animal stories, such as, _The Kindred of the\r\nWild_ and \"Red Fox,\" by Charles G. D. Roberts; and _Wild Animals I Have\r\nKnown_, by Ernest Thompson-Seton.\r\n\r\nWith language: By oral and written descriptions of the animals that have\r\nbeen observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nFORM III\r\n\r\nWINTER\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE OF PLANTS IN THE HOME\r\n\r\nThe care of flowering bulbs which was begun in Form I will be continued\r\nin Form II. The growing of new plants from cuttings will now be taken\r\nup. In those schools which are kept continuously heated, potted plants\r\nmay be kept throughout the year. The pupils will come to appreciate the\r\nplant's needs and learn how to meet them in the supply of good soil,\r\nwater, and sunlight. The following points should be observed:\r\n\r\n1. Good potting soil can be made by building up alternating layers of\r\nsods and stable manure and allowing this compost to stand until\r\nthoroughly rotted. A little sharp sand mixed with this forms an\r\nexcellent soil for most house plants.\r\n\r\n2. Thorough watering twice a week is better than adding a little water\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\n3. The leaves should be showered with water once a week to cleanse them\r\nfrom dust.\r\n\r\n4. An ounce of whale-oil soap dissolved in a quart of water may be used\r\nto destroy plant-lice. Common soap-suds may also be used for this\r\npurpose, but care should be taken to rinse the plants in clean water\r\nafter using a soap wash.\r\n\r\n5. Most plants need some direct sunlight every day if possible, although\r\nmost of the ferns grow without it.\r\n\r\n6. Plants usually need re-potting once a year. Many kinds may be set\r\nout-of-doors in flower beds in May and left until September, when they\r\nmay be taken up and placed in pots, or cuttings made from them for\r\npotting.\r\n\r\n7. A flower exhibition at the school once or twice a year, or at a local\r\nexhibition, adds to the interest.\r\n\r\n8. The pupils should report to the teacher from time to time the\r\nprogress of their plants and make many drawings showing their\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nPLANT CUTTINGS\r\n\r\nThe pupils will be interested to know that it is possible to produce new\r\nplants without waiting for them to grow up from the seed. It will indeed\r\nbe quite a surprise to them to see a new plant complete in all its parts\r\ngrow up from a small piece of stem, root, or even leaf. With a little\r\ncare even children may propagate plants in this way.\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF CUTTINGS\r\n\r\nBegin with some of the common herbaceous bedding-plants, such as\r\ngeranium, coleus, or fuschia. These are such common bedding-plants that\r\nthey are easily obtained in the autumn. Only well-matured stems of the\r\nseason's growth, such as will break with a slight snap when bent, should\r\nbe used.\r\n\r\nLet the pupils provide themselves with sharp knives for the lesson, with\r\nsmall boxes or pots, and with some moist, clean sand--not potting soil.\r\nA few holes should be bored in the bottom of the box, then a layer of\r\nfine gravel put in to provide for good drainage, and over it layers of\r\nmoist sand. Take a slip or growing end of a stem about three inches in\r\nlength, always cutting it at or just below a node, or joint, and\r\nleaving only a couple of small leaves on the top of the slip. Insert it\r\nto about half its depth in the box of moist sand. These cuttings may be\r\nplaced a few inches apart in the box, which should then be placed in a\r\nwarm, light room for a few weeks until the roots develop. The cuttings\r\nshould be partly shaded by papers from the strong sunlight, and the sand\r\nkept slightly moist but not wet. Bottom heat and a moist, warm\r\natmosphere hasten their development.\r\n\r\nAnother very convenient and very successful method of starting cuttings\r\nis to take a six-inch flower-pot, put two inches of fine gravel in the\r\nbottom, set a four-inch unglazed flower-pot in the centre, and fill up\r\nthe space around it with sand and garden-loam, mixed. Put a cork in the\r\nhole in the bottom of the small flower-pot, and then fill it with water.\r\nPut the cuttings around in the space between the two pots and set in a\r\nfairly warm room in moderate light.\r\n\r\nPOTTING OF ROOTED CUTTINGS\r\n\r\nWhen the cuttings are well rooted, which requires from three to six\r\nweeks according to the variety and growth conditions furnished, they\r\nshould be carefully lifted with a trowel and each set in a small pot or\r\ncan. First put in the bottom a few small stones to secure drainage, and\r\nthen a little good potting soil. Set the plant in place and fill in\r\naround with more soil and pack this firmly around the roots. Keep room\r\nin the top of the pot for water. When the new plant has made some\r\ngrowth, it may be shifted to a larger pot. Geraniums and coleus (foliage\r\nplants) should not be kept more than two seasons. Take cuttings off the\r\nold plants and then throw the latter away.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVERGREENS\r\n\r\nIn December make a study of Canadian evergreens, choosing spruce,\r\nbalsam, and cedar, if available, or substitute hemlock for any one of\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nCompare the general features of these trees, such as shape, direction of\r\nbranches, colour, persistence of leaves through the winter.\r\n\r\nHave the pupils notice how nature fits these trees to endure the snows\r\nand storms of winter by:\r\n\r\n1. The tapering cone which causes the snow to slide off the tree.\r\n\r\n2. The fine, needle-shaped leaves to which only very sticky snow will\r\nadhere.\r\n\r\n3. The very tough, flexible, and elastic branches, which bend in the\r\nwind and under the weight of snow, but spring back to their old\r\npositions.\r\n\r\n4. The resin in leaves, stems, and buds, which enables the trees to\r\nresist frost and rain.\r\n\r\nTeach the pupils to distinguish these trees by their differences in\r\ncolour and form and also by the differences in their leaves and cones.\r\n\r\nCLASS-ROOM LESSON\r\n\r\nDistribute small twigs of balsam and require the pupils to observe and\r\ndescribe the length, shape, and colour of the leaves.\r\n\r\nNext distribute small twigs of spruce and require the pupils to compare\r\nthe spruce leaves with those of the balsam in length, shape, and colour.\r\n\r\nNext distribute twigs of cedar and proceed similarly.\r\n\r\nThe cones may be dealt with in a similar manner. Require the pupils to\r\nmake a census of the evergreens of the locality, recording the class of\r\nevergreen, the size, and the use of each kind for shade, ornament, or\r\nfor commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--The balsam, spruce, and hemlock are difficult for the\r\nbeginner to distinguish, but this may be done by noting the following\r\npoints of difference in their leaves:\r\n\r\nThe leaf of the hemlock is the only one that has a distinct leaf-stalk.\r\nLook for this tiny stalk.\r\n\r\nThe leaf of the hemlock, like that of the balsam, is flat, but the\r\nhemlock leaf is much the shorter.\r\n\r\nThe leaf of the spruce is not flat, but is three-sided or nearly so. Its\r\ncolour is uniform, while the under surface of the hemlock leaf, and also\r\nof the balsam leaf, is of a decidedly lighter colour than the upper\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nNote that the spruce _type_ is studied; no attempt is made at this stage\r\nto differentiate the several species of spruce.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLECTION OF WOOD SPECIMENS\r\n\r\nDuring the winter months the boys may prepare specimens of wood for the\r\nschool collection. These specimens should be cut when green, and dried\r\nafterwards. They should be uniform in length--not more than six\r\ninches--and should show the bark on one side. The side showing the bark\r\nshould be two inches wide at most, six inches long, and running in a\r\nV-shaped, radial section toward the pith. A tangential section also\r\nshows well the rounded layers. A piece of slab as cut lengthwise off a\r\nround stick is tangential. Care should be taken not to mutilate trees in\r\ntaking these specimens. Specimens of rare or foreign woods may be\r\nobtained at wood-working factories.\r\n\r\nRELATED READING\r\n\r\nWinter is Nature's quiescent period. Continuous active observation in\r\nthe out-of-doors among the plants of the forest and garden gives place\r\nfor a time to indoor work and reflection. Pupils need time for reading\r\nand reflection, and no time is so opportune as the quiet winter season.\r\nDuring these months some time should be devoted to the reading of nature\r\nstories and extracts from magazines and books dealing with plant as well\r\nas with animal life.\r\n\r\nPupils should review their gardening experiences and discuss plans of\r\nimprovement for the approaching spring and summer. Let them write\r\nletters to the Form II pupils of other schools where similar work has\r\nbeen carried on, and give some of their experiences in gardening and\r\nother plant studies, and also in animal studies. A certain Friday\r\nafternoon might be appointed for hearing the letters read which were\r\nreceived in reply. Suitable short poems that have a direct bearing upon\r\nthe outdoor studies should be read from time to time. Good pictures also\r\ncome in here as an aid in helping the pupils to appreciate written\r\ndescriptions. The first-hand observations made by them will form a basis\r\nfor the better and more appreciative interpretation of these literature\r\nselections.\r\n\r\nFor Observation Lesson on Weed Seeds, see page 171.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW ANIMALS PREPARE FOR WINTER\r\n\r\n~Introduction.~--Discuss the preparations that people make for winter,\r\nsuch as the storing of food and the providing of warmer clothes and\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\n~Method.~--The teacher questions the pupils and encourages them to tell\r\nwhat they have learned through their own observation of animals. The\r\nknowledge of the pupils is supplemented by information given by the\r\nteacher, but the pupils are left to find out more facts by further\r\nobservations. Thus:\r\n\r\nDo you ever see ground-hogs out during winter?\r\n\r\nWhat do they feed upon during the winter?\r\n\r\nWhat is the condition of ground-hogs in late summer and in autumn?\r\n\r\nWhat is the use of the great store of fat that they have in their\r\nbodies?\r\n\r\nExamine the snow near the burrows of ground-hogs and find whether they\r\never come out in mid-winter.\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--The hibernating animals prepare a home or nest and\r\nlay up a store of food in the form of fat within their bodies. To\r\nhibernate does not mean the same as to sleep. The hibernating animals\r\nhave much less active organs than the sleeping animals. The heart-beat\r\nand the respiratory movements are very slow and feeble, consequently a\r\nvery little nourishment suffices to sustain life.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF LESSONS\r\n\r\n(Two lessons of twenty minutes)\r\n\r\n     1. Some animals migrate:\r\n\r\n     Examples--many birds, butterflies, and some bats; the\r\n     cariboo, and buffalo.\r\n\r\n     2. Some animals hibernate:\r\n\r\n     Examples--bear, ground-hog, raccoon, frogs, toads, snakes,\r\n     and some bats.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--Flies, mosquitoes, and some other insects crawl into\r\n     crevices and remain at rest during winter, but their bodies\r\n     are not stored with food.\r\n\r\n     3. Some animals build houses and store foods:\r\n\r\n     Examples--beaver, squirrel, chipmunk, honey-bee, deer-mouse.\r\n\r\n     4. Some animals build homes convenient to food:\r\n\r\n     Examples--musk-rat, field-mouse.\r\n\r\n     5. Some animals put on warmer clothing:\r\n\r\n     Examples--fox, mink, otter, rabbit, horse, cow, partridge,\r\n     chickadee. The rabbit and weasel turn white, a colour\r\n     protection.\r\n\r\n     6. Many insect larvae form cocoons or pupae cases:\r\n\r\n     Examples--emperor-moth, codling moth, tomato worm.\r\n\r\nCORRELATIONS\r\n\r\nWith literature, reading, and language.\r\n\r\nWith geography: By a lesson on \"The influence of climate upon animal and\r\nplant life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHICKENS\r\n\r\n     (Consult _Principles and Practice of Poultry Culture_ by\r\n     Robinson. Ginn & Co., $2.00.)\r\n\r\nCONVERSATION LESSON\r\n\r\nHow many of you keep chickens at your homes?\r\n\r\nWhy do many kinds of people keep chickens?\r\n\r\nWhat breeds of chickens do you keep?\r\n\r\nHow many other breeds do you know?\r\n\r\nDescribe the appearance of a few of the commoner breeds.\r\n\r\nWhy are there so many different breeds?\r\n\r\nName those that are good laying breeds.\r\n\r\nName breeds that are not usually considered good laying breeds.\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--Chickens are kept by all classes of people. Many keep\r\nthem for the profit in eggs and meat, others keep them as a fad, and\r\nothers to gratify a craving for animal companionship. There are one\r\nhundred and seventy-five recognized breeds, varying in size from that of\r\nthe Japanese bantam weighing ten ounces to that of the huge Brahma which\r\nweighs fourteen pounds. The shapes and colours present as great a\r\nvariation as the sizes. The breeds that are usually regarded as good\r\nlayers are White Leghorn, Barred Bock, and Rhode Island Red, while the\r\nGame breeds are usually regarded as poor layers. Careful tests prove,\r\nhowever, that there are good laying and poor laying strains in every\r\nbreed, and care must be taken to select from good strains, since the\r\nbreed is not a sufficient guide.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the first lesson, assign to the pupils the task of\r\nmaking a chicken census of the district as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Request each pupil to count the number of hens under two years old at\r\nhis home and also to count the hens that are more than two years old.\r\n\r\n2. Request each pupil to find out, if possible, the number of eggs\r\nobtained at his home during the whole year.\r\n\r\nARITHMETIC LESSON BASED ON THE CHICKEN CENSUS\r\n\r\n1. Using the data collected by the pupils, calculate the total number of\r\nchickens under two years old in the district.\r\n\r\nCalculate the number over two years old. (The latter are classed as\r\nunprofitable.)\r\n\r\n2. Using the data obtained by the pupils (provided sufficient data was\r\nobtained to make it reasonably reliable), calculate the average number\r\nof eggs laid a year by each hen.\r\n\r\n3. If the data collected by the pupils as to the number of eggs is\r\nthought to be unreliable, make use of the following:\r\n\r\nThe average number of eggs laid each year by each hen in Ontario is\r\nseven dozen. Use this average number, and:\r\n\r\n(1) Calculate the value of the eggs produced in this district in a year,\r\nthe average price of eggs being twenty cents a dozen.\r\n\r\n(2) If the average production of eggs were increased to ten dozen (a\r\nnumber that is easily possible under improved management), find the\r\nvalue of the eggs that would be produced in a year, and find the gain\r\nthat would result from this better management.\r\n\r\n4. If it costs ninety cents a year to feed a hen, find the net annual\r\nprofit to this district from the egg production.\r\n\r\nCARE OF CHICKENS\r\n\r\nThe method of developing conceptions of how to take proper care of\r\nchickens is based partly upon the pupils' experiences and partly upon a\r\nknowledge of the history of the original wild hens.\r\n\r\nInformation can be gathered from the pupils as to the date of hatching\r\nof the earliest chickens and the date at which the pullets begin to lay.\r\nChickens that are hatched in April begin to lay in November or December\r\nand lay throughout the winter when eggs bring the highest price.\r\n\r\nThe original wild hens lived in the dry, grassy, and shrubby jungles of\r\nIndia. They were free to move about in the open air, and at night they\r\nperched in the trees, which sheltered them from rain. Hence may be\r\ninferred what kind of quarters should be provided for chickens.\r\n\r\nCARE AND FOOD OF CHICKENS\r\n\r\nPoints developed\r\n\r\nChickens must have plenty of fresh air without draughts.\r\n\r\nHeat is not necessary.\r\n\r\nTheir quarters must be dry, clean, and well lighted.\r\n\r\nThey require exercise.\r\n\r\nTheir food must have in it the materials that are needed to make the\r\nsubstance of the egg.\r\n\r\nBreakfast: Wheat or corn scattered among straw--the scratching affords\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\nDinner: Meat scraps, slaughter-house refuse, vegetables, sour milk, and\r\nrolled oats.\r\n\r\nSupper: As at breakfast.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL SCIENCE PHASE OF NATURE STUDY\r\n\r\nThe teacher is advised to read carefully the instructions and General\r\nMethod of Experimental Science, Chapter I, before beginning the lessons\r\nin Physical Science.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLIDS, LIQUIDS, AND GASES\r\n\r\nArrange a collection of objects of various shapes, sizes, colours, and\r\nweights, as cork, glass, lead, iron, copper, stone, coal, chalk. Show\r\nthat these are alike in one respect, namely, that they have a shape not\r\neasily changed, that is, they are _solids_. Compare these solids with\r\nsuch substances as water, alcohol, oil, molasses, mercury, milk, tar,\r\nhoney, glycerine, gasolene. These latter will pour, and depend for their\r\nshape on the containing vessel. They are _liquids_. Compare air with\r\nsolids and liquids. Such a material as air is called a _gas_. Other\r\nexamples of illuminating gas, and dentists' \"gas\"; others will be\r\nstudied in future lessons. Pupils may think all gases are invisible. To\r\nshow that some are not, put a few pieces of copper in a test-tube or\r\ntumbler and add a little nitric acid. Watch the brown gas fall through\r\nthe air; note how it spreads in all directions. Some gases fall because\r\nthey are heavier than air; others rise because lighter. All gases spread\r\nout as soon as liberated and try to fill all the available space. Spill\r\na little ammonia and note how soon the odour of the gas is smelled in\r\nall parts of the room.\r\n\r\nCHANGE OF STATE\r\n\r\nHeat some lead or solder in a spoon till liquid. Let it cool. Do the\r\nsame with wax.\r\n\r\nHeat some water in a flask till it becomes steam. Steam is a gas. Cool\r\nthe steam and form water again. (See distillation.) Refer to lava\r\n(melted rock), moulding iron, melting ice and snow, softening of butter.\r\n\r\nAll solids may be changed to liquids and even to gases if sufficiently\r\nheated. Likewise all gases may be changed into liquids and then to\r\nsolids.\r\n\r\nEXPANSION OF SOLIDS\r\n\r\nIn winter pupils may find that the ink is frozen. The teacher directs\r\nattention to this and inquires why it has occurred. It may be that in a\r\nlesson on rocks the teacher will ask the pupils to account for all the\r\nlittle stones. The following _experiments_ will aim at solving the\r\nforegoing problems:\r\n\r\n1. A brass ball and ring are shown. Pupils handle these and note that\r\nboth are cold and that the ball just passes through the ring. They are\r\nasked to compare the size of the ball with that of the ring.\r\n\r\n2. The spirit-lamp is lighted and examined. Pupils hold their hands over\r\nthe flame to note the heat.\r\n\r\n3. The ball is heated in the flame for a short time by one of the\r\npupils, and felt cautiously. An attempt is made to pass it through the\r\nring. How has the ball changed in feeling? In size? How does one know it\r\nis larger? What has caused these changes?\r\n\r\n4. Cool the ball. Feel it. Try to pass it through the ring now. How has\r\nit changed in feeling? In size? What caused these changes? How does heat\r\naffect the ball? How does cold affect it?\r\n\r\nThe teacher may now give the words _expand_ and _contract_, writing them\r\non the black-board and explaining their use. Pupils may then state their\r\nconclusions: _A brass ball expands when heated and contracts when\r\ncooled._\r\n\r\nA blacksmith can make the following very serviceable apparatus: A scrap\r\nof iron about eleven inches long, one inch wide, and one-eighth inch\r\nthick, has one inch bent up at each end. A rod one-eighth inch in\r\ndiameter is made just long enough to pass between the upturned ends of\r\nthe first piece when both are cold. The rod is heated and the experiment\r\nconducted as in the case of the ball. Two additional facts are learned:\r\n(1) Iron expands as well as brass; (2) solids expand in length as well\r\nas in volume. The pupils may now be told that other solids have been\r\ntried and expansion has invariably followed heating. The conclusion may\r\nthen be made general.\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL APPLICATIONS\r\n\r\n1. When your ink-bottle was placed on the stove, which end became\r\nwarmer? Which expanded the more. Why then did it crack?\r\n\r\n2. What other examples like this have you noticed? (Lamp chimneys, fruit\r\njars, stove plates)\r\n\r\n3. The earth was once very hot and is now cooling. How is the size of\r\nthe earth changing? Does it ever crack? What causes earthquakes?\r\n\r\n4. Find out by observation how a blacksmith sets tires.\r\n\r\n5. Invent a way to loosen a glass stopper stuck in the neck of a bottle.\r\n\r\n6. What does your mother do if the metal rim refuses to come off the\r\nfruit jar?\r\n\r\n7. Next time you cross a railway, notice whether the ends of the rails\r\ntouch. Explain.\r\n\r\n8. What allowance is made for contraction in a wire fence? A railway\r\nbridge? Why?\r\n\r\n9. Why do the stove-pipes crack when the fire is first started?\r\n\r\n10. Why does the house go \"thump\" on a very cold night?\r\n\r\n11. Draw the ball, ring, and spirit-lamp in position.\r\n\r\n12. Describe in writing the experiments we have made.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION\r\n\r\nYou have seen that iron and brass both expand. Do they expand equally?\r\nLet pupils have a few days to invent a way of answering the question.\r\nThe experiment may then be tried with the compound bar. See _The Ontario\r\nHigh School Physics_, pages 217-218, also _First Course in Physics_,\r\nMilliken and Gale, page 144.\r\n\r\nIf the equipment of the school is limited, it may be necessary to\r\ndispense with the ball and ring and generalize from one experiment.\r\n\r\nAnother easily made apparatus consists of two iron rings with handles.\r\nOne ring will just pass through the other when both are cold. The stove\r\nmay take the place of the spirit-lamp.\r\n\r\nA still simpler plan consists in driving two nails into a block at such\r\na distance apart that an iron rod (six-inch nail, poker, bolt, etc.)\r\nwill just pass between. On heating the rod the increase in length\r\nbecomes evident.\r\n\r\nEXPANSION OF LIQUIDS\r\n\r\nFill a common bottle with coloured water; insert a rubber stopper\r\nthrough which passes a glass tube about sixteen inches long. Set the\r\nbottle in a pan of water and gradually warm the water. The rise of the\r\nliquid in the tube will indicate expansion. On setting the bottle in\r\ncold water the fall of the column of coloured water shows contraction.\r\nSee _The Ontario High School Physics_, page 218, also _Science of Common\r\nLife_, page 48. Macmillan Co., 60 cents.\r\n\r\nSet the flask or bottle in a mixture of ice and salt and note that the\r\nextreme cold causes contraction for a while, then expansion. Note that\r\nwhen expansion begins, the water has not begun to freeze, but that it\r\ndoes so soon after.\r\n\r\nThe night before this experiment the children should set out in the cold\r\nair, tightly corked bottles of water. In the morning they will be found\r\nburst by the expansion.\r\n\r\nAPPLICATIONS\r\n\r\n1. Why did some of the ink-bottles burst in the cold room?\r\n\r\n2. Find large stones split up into two or more fragments. Explain.\r\n\r\n3. Why is fall-ploughed land so mellow in spring?\r\n\r\n4. Why does ice float? Think what would happen if it did not.\r\n\r\n5. Explain the heaving of oats, clover, wheat.\r\n\r\n6. Do all liquids expand on freezing? Try melted paraffin.\r\n\r\nTHE THERMOMETER\r\n\r\nBesides the ordinary thermometer the school should possess a chemical\r\nthermometer graduated from 0 deg. Fahrenheit to 212 deg.\r\n\r\n1. Our sensations vary so much under different circumstances and in\r\ndifferent individuals that they cannot be depended on. Find examples of\r\nthis and show the need of a measuring instrument.\r\n\r\n2. The pupils can learn, by examination of the common wall instrument,\r\nthe parts of the thermometer--tube, bulb, liquid (alcohol or mercury),\r\nand scale.\r\n\r\n3. Repeat the experiment for expansion of liquids, showing wherein the\r\napparatus resembles the thermometer, warm the thermometer bulb and watch\r\nthe column rise; cool it and note the fall.\r\n\r\n4. Set the bulb of the chemical thermometer in boiling water. The\r\nmercury comes to rest near 212 deg. Bury the bulb in melting snow and\r\nnotice that the column falls to 32 deg. Give names for these points.\r\nExplain that a degree is one of the 180 equal parts which lie between\r\nboiling point and freezing-point. Show that 32 deg. below freezing must\r\nbe 0 deg., or zero.\r\n\r\n5. The uses of thermometers for indoors and outdoors; for dairy, sick\r\nroom, incubator, and soils; maximum and minimum. Dairy thermometers\r\nregistering 212 deg. Fahrenheit may be obtained; they are cheaper than\r\nchemical thermometers.\r\n\r\nEXPANSION OF AIR\r\n\r\nHalf fill a flask with water and invert it uncorked over water in a\r\nplate. Apply a cloth soaked in boiling water to the part that contains\r\nair. Why does the water leave the flask? Apply cold water. Why does the\r\nwater return? Any ordinary bottle may be used in place of the flask, but\r\nit is more liable to crack.\r\n\r\nMake an air thermometer. See _The Ontario High School Physics_, page\r\n223, also _Science of Common Life_, page 41. Try to graduate it from the\r\nmercurial thermometer. Have the boys make a stand for it.\r\n\r\n_Inferences._--Heated gases rise because they expand. Hot-air balloons,\r\nwinds, and heating with hot-air furnaces, all depend on this principle.\r\n\r\nSOURCES OF HEAT AND LIGHT\r\n\r\nNOTES FOR A SERIES OF LESSONS\r\n\r\n1. THE SUN.--Our dependence on it. Valuable results of its heat. Simple\r\nnotions as to its size, distance, and nature. Our earth catches a very\r\nsmall fraction of the sun's heat; our sun is but one of millions--the\r\nfixed stars. Show the burning effect of a lens.\r\n\r\n2. FUELS.--Wood, oil, coal, alcohol, gas, peat, straw: where obtained;\r\nspecial uses of each under varying conditions; need of economy. (This is\r\nclosely related to geography.)\r\n\r\n3. ELECTRICITY.--In urban schools use the electric light or some heating\r\ndevice for illustration. In rural schools a battery of two or three\r\ncells (see \"Apparatus\") will melt a fine strand drawn from a picture\r\nwire.\r\n\r\nApplications: ironing, toasting, cooking; advantages or disadvantages\r\ncompared with gas or wood.\r\n\r\n4. FRICTION.--Pupils rub hands together; rub a button on a cloth; saw a\r\nstring across the edge of a board or across the hand; bore a hole\r\nthrough a hardwood plank, then feel the auger-bit.\r\n\r\nApplications: restoring circulation; \"hot-boxes\" in machinery;\r\nlubricants and their uses; lighting matches.\r\n\r\n5. POUNDING.--Hammer a nail flat on an anvil or stone; feel it. Bullets\r\nfired against an iron or stone surface may be picked up very hot. Note\r\nsparks that can be struck from a stone; percussion caps, flint-lock\r\nmuskets.\r\n\r\n6. PRESSURE.--After using a bicycle pump for some time, feel the bottom,\r\nalso the top. If possible, examine an air-compressor and find out the\r\nmeans used for cooling the air.\r\n\r\n7. SOURCES OF LIGHT.--Sun, moon, oil, tallow, gas, electricity, wax,\r\nacetylene; advantages of each; relative cost.\r\n\r\nPRIMITIVE METHODS OF OBTAINING FIRE: Most savages obtain fire by\r\nfriction; rubbing two pieces of wood together till hot enough to set\r\nfire to some dry, light material. The natives of Australia placed a flat\r\npiece of wood on the ground and pressed against this the end of a round\r\npiece, which they twirled rapidly with their hands till fire was\r\nproduced. The North American Indians did the twirling with their bow\r\nstrings; the Eskimo's plan is somewhat similar. It is impossible to say\r\nwhen flint and steel were first used, but we know they continued to be\r\nthe chief means of producing fire till about 1834, when matches were\r\ninvented. Let pupils try to produce fire by these means.\r\n\r\nThe earliest lamps consisted of shells, skulls of animals, and\r\ncup-shaped stones filled with fat or fish oils which burned on a wick of\r\ncloth or the pith of rushes. The Tibetans burn butter, the Eskimos\r\nwhale- or seal-oil, the Arabians palm- or olive-oil. For outdoor\r\nlighting, torches carried in the hand were used till gas came into\r\ngeneral use about 1792.\r\n\r\nCONDUCTION\r\n\r\nGive to four boys strips of copper, aluminium, wood, and glass,\r\nrespectively. They hold these by one end and heat the other end till one\r\nor more are forced to drop the piece on account of the heat. The boys\r\nwith the metals will soon find them hot throughout, but the other two\r\nwill be able to hold on indefinitely. The teacher gives the terms \"good\r\nconductor\" and \"poor conductor\".\r\n\r\nPROBLEMS\r\n\r\n1. Are metals generally good conductors? Try with strips of zinc, lead,\r\niron, a silver spoon.\r\n\r\n2. Are all good conductors equally good? Devise a means of ascertaining.\r\nSee _Science of Common Life_, Chapter VI; also _The Ontario High School\r\nPhysics_, page 274.\r\n\r\n3. Is water a good conductor?\r\n\r\nLists of good and poor conductors may then be made, the teacher adding\r\nto the list. Good: metals; poor: wood, horn, bone, cloth, leather, air,\r\nwater, hair, asbestos, ashes, rock, earth.\r\n\r\nPROBLEMS\r\n\r\n1. If the interior of the earth is very hot, why do we not feel it?\r\n\r\n2. How can the cold snow keep the earth warm?\r\n\r\n3. Why does your hand freeze to metals but not to wood?\r\n\r\n4. Let the children try to find other instances: wools or furs for\r\nclothing, fur coats on northern animals, feathers on birds, down quilts,\r\ntea cosies, sawdust for packing ice, double windows, wooden handles for\r\nhot irons, asbestos coating for steam pipes.\r\n\r\nTHE MINERS' SAFETY-LAMP: This is a most important application of\r\nconduction. Get from the tinsmith a piece of brass gauze six inches\r\nsquare. Raise the wick of the spirit-lamp causing it to give a high\r\nflame and bring the gauze down upon the flame till it touches the wick.\r\nNote that the flame does not rise above the gauze. Hold a piece of paper\r\nabove the gauze near the flame and note that it does not take fire. Note\r\nalso that the gauze soon becomes hot. The brass wires conduct the heat\r\nof the flame rapidly away so that there is not heat enough above the\r\ngauze to cause combustion. Now roll the gauze into a hollow cylinder,\r\npin the edges together, insert a cork at each end, and have a short\r\ncandle fastened to the lower one. Try to light the candle with the lamp\r\nthrough the gauze. It is not easily done.\r\n\r\nThe miner carries a lamp made like this, so that if he should be in the\r\npresence of the explosive gas, \"fire damp\", it would not explode because\r\nof the wire gauze shield.\r\n\r\nCONVECTION\r\n\r\nWater is not a conductor, how then is it heated?\r\n\r\nDrop a few pieces of solid colouring matter, (analine blue, blueing, or\r\npotassium permanganate) into a beaker of cold water. Place the beaker\r\nover a heater and observe the coloured portion rise.\r\n\r\nWet sawdust will make a good substitute for the colouring matter. A\r\nsealing jar or even a tin cup will do instead of the beaker. The stove\r\nor a dish of hot water will take the place of the lamp.\r\n\r\nPROBLEMS\r\n\r\n1. Using a thermometer, see whether the water at the bottom is warmer\r\nthan that at the top while the beaker is being heated.\r\n\r\n2. Heat some oil and pour it over the surface of some cold water. Lower\r\na thermometer into this. Does the water at the bottom soon become warm?\r\n\r\n3. If your kitchen is provided with a hot-water tank, find out what part\r\nof the tank first becomes warm after the fire is lighted.\r\n\r\n4. In bathing, where do you find the coldest water of a pond or still\r\nriver? See _Science of Common Life_, Chapter VI; also _The Ontario High\r\nSchool Physics_, page 280.\r\n\r\nCONVECTION IN GASES\r\n\r\nA good apparatus may be made by cutting two holes one inch in diameter\r\nin one side of a chalk box, replace the lid with a piece of glass, place\r\na lamp chimney over each hole and a lighted candle under one of the\r\nchimneys. Hold a piece of smoking touch-paper at each chimney in turn\r\nand note direction of air current.\r\n\r\nAPPLICATIONS\r\n\r\n1. Winds are caused by the rising of air over heated areas, allowing\r\ncooler currents to take its place. (Geography)\r\n\r\n2. Rooms are ventilated by heating some of the air more than the rest,\r\nthus producing a current. (Hygiene) Winds are nature's means of\r\nventilating the earth.\r\n\r\nRADIATION OF HEAT\r\n\r\nThis should be taken up as an introduction to dew, frost, winds,\r\nclimate, etc.\r\n\r\n1. Make an iron ball hot (the end of a poker will answer). Hold the hand\r\na few inches below the iron. Does the heat reach the hand by convection?\r\nBy conduction? By means of suitable questions, lead the pupil to see\r\nthat it is not by convection, for the hand is below the hot object while\r\nheated air rises; it is not by conduction, for air is one of the very\r\npoorest conductors; moreover, the heat is felt instantly from the poker,\r\nbut it takes an appreciable time for it to come by conduction and\r\nconvection. We say this heat is _radiated_ from the iron. The velocity\r\nof radiated heat is about 186,000 miles a second.\r\n\r\n2. The above experiment may be varied by bringing the hot iron gradually\r\ntoward the bulb of the air thermometer and noting the greatest distance\r\nat which it will affect the thermometer.\r\n\r\nIt is by radiation that the sun's heat and light reach us. We get much\r\nof the heat of stoves, fire-places, and radiators by the same means.\r\n\r\nWhy does the earth cool off at night? Why does dew form? Why can no dew\r\nform on a cloudy night? Why is a mountain top or a desert so cold,\r\nespecially at night?\r\n\r\n3. Take two tin cans (baking powder boxes will answer) and make holes in\r\nthe lids large enough to admit a thermometer. Blacken one box in the\r\nflame of an oil lamp. Fill both with boiling water and put in a cool\r\nplace. Test with a thermometer from time to time. Which cools most\r\nrapidly?\r\n\r\n4. Fill the tin cans with cold water, find the temperature, and then\r\nplace them near a hot stove. Which warms faster? Usually dark or rough\r\nsurfaces radiate heat and absorb heat faster than bright or smooth ones.\r\nAn excellent way of testing this is to lay a black cloth and a white one\r\nside by side on the snow where the sun is shining brightly. The snow\r\nwill melt more rapidly under the black cloth. Painted shingles may be\r\nsubstituted for the cloths. Try different colours. The day chosen should\r\nnot be extremely cold.\r\n\r\nPROBLEMS\r\n\r\n1. Why should we have the outside of a tea-kettle, teapot, or hot-air\r\nshaft of a bright colour? Why should we have stoves and stove-pipes dull\r\nblack?\r\n\r\n2. Why does a coat of snow keep the earth warm?\r\n\r\n3. Which is the warmest colour to wear in winter? Does this account for\r\nthe colour of Arctic animals?\r\n\r\n4. Which is the coolest colour to wear in the hot sun?\r\n\r\n5. Gardeners sometimes strew the ground with coal-dust to help ripen\r\ntheir melons. Show the value of this.\r\n\r\n6. Suggest a method of protecting a wall from the heat of a stove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nFORM III\r\n\r\nSPRING\r\n\r\n\r\nWINDOW BOXES\r\n\r\nMany garden plants should be started in a box of earth in a warm, sunny\r\nwindow. In some schools this can be done with a little care in heating\r\non cold nights. Small boxes or grape baskets full of rich sandy loam\r\nwith an inch of gravel in the bottom for drainage may be used. Sow the\r\nseeds in rows or broadcast. To prevent the soil from drying out too\r\nquickly, cover the box with a pane of glass. When the plants are up,\r\ngive them plenty of light and not too much warmth. On very mild days set\r\nthem in a warm, sheltered place out-of-doors and bring them in again\r\nearly in the evening. This tends to make them hardy. When about three\r\ninches high, pick the young plants out and set them in other boxes a few\r\ninches apart. This moving causes the formation of numerous fibrous roots\r\nand makes stronger plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINDOW GARDENS\r\n\r\nWindow boxes may be used for a whole season on the inside of the\r\nbuilding in cold weather, and on the outside in warm weather. There is\r\nalmost no limit to the kinds of plants that can be grown in them, but\r\nthey are most suitable for flowers.\r\n\r\nGood boxes may be made of dressed lumber so as to fit on the\r\nwindow-sill. They should be six inches deep, ten inches wide, and the\r\nrequired length. They should have a few small holes in the bottom to\r\nallow excess water to drain off and should be painted dark green or some\r\nquiet colour. There should be an inch of gravel in the bottom, some\r\nrotted sods covering this, and then the box filled with rich sandy loam.\r\n\r\nSUITABLE PLANTS\r\n\r\nSome flowers suitable for growing in window boxes outside in summer are\r\nthose of drooping habit: lobelia, Kenilworth ivy, verbena, tropeolum,\r\npetunia, and sweet-alyssum toward the front, and behind, more erect\r\nplants, such as geranium, heliotrope, begonia, phlox, and nasturtium.\r\nThe box must not be too much crowded.\r\n\r\nFor inside and in shady situations the following are suitable:\r\ntradescantia, parlour ivy, moneywort, vinca smilax, climbing fern,\r\nasparagus fern, dracaena, coleus, centaurea, sword fern, and Boston fern.\r\nFor indoor boxes in winter, the following may be used: abutilon,\r\ncalceolaria, cyclamen, violets, primroses, petunias, geraniums, freesia,\r\nand such foliage plants as dracaena, cannas, dusty miller, and coleus.\r\nThe following climbing plants may be trained up the window cases:\r\nasparagus plumosus fern, cobea scandens, smilax, maurandia, and English\r\nivy. If drooping or trailing plants are desired, the following may be\r\nused: oxalis, sweet-alyssum, lobelia, ivy, geranium, Kenilworth ivy, and\r\nWandering Jew.\r\n\r\nFERTILIZER\r\n\r\nAs the amount of soil is limited and the number of plants that it has to\r\nsupport is great, the soil should be made quite rich and should be\r\nfurther fertilized from time to time with a little liquid manure. This\r\ncan be best obtained by taking a strong barrel or large keg and filling\r\nit about half full of water. Then fill an ordinary coarse potato sack\r\nwith cow-stable manure and set the sack in the barrel for a few days. A\r\ntap in the bottom of the barrel is most convenient for drawing off the\r\nliquid manure. A little of this will also be found valuable for watering\r\ndahlias, roses, and other garden plants during the summer.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOIL STUDIES\r\n\r\nThe classes of soil should be reviewed. Pupils should gather examples\r\nfrom many places. The samples may be kept in bottles of uniform size and\r\nshould include not only the four types but varieties of each, also\r\nvarious kinds of loam.\r\n\r\nEXERCISES AND EXPERIMENTS\r\n\r\nSOIL CONSTITUENTS\r\n\r\n1. With a sharp spade, cut a piece about twelve inches deep from (1) the\r\nforest floor, (2) an old pasture field. Note character and order of the\r\nlayers of soil in (1) leaves, humus, loam, sand, or clay; in (2) grass,\r\ndead grass, humus, loam, sand, or clay. Observe soils shown in railway\r\ncuttings, freshly dug wells, post holes.\r\n\r\n2. Note the effect produced on the soil of a field by (1) leaving it a\r\nfew years in pasture, (2) ploughing in heavy crops, (3) applying\r\nbarn-yard manure. In all these cases vegetable matter is mixed with the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n3. Dry some good leaf-mould. Throw a handful on the surface of some\r\nwater. The mineral matter sinks, while the vegetable portion remains\r\nsuspended for some time. Try this experiment with gravel, sand, and\r\nclay. Note that the gravel sinks rapidly, the sand less rapidly, and\r\nthat the clay takes a long time to settle. If the water be kept in rapid\r\nmotion, the finer soils will all remain suspended till motion becomes\r\nslower. Apply this in geography. The bed of a stream will consist of\r\nstones if it be swift, of sand if less swift, and of clay if very slow.\r\nHow are alluvial plains formed?\r\n\r\n4. Place half an ounce of dry humus on an iron plate or fire-shovel and\r\nheat strongly in a stove. Note that it begins to smoke and a large part\r\nsmoulders away to ashes; the mineral portion remains. Weigh the part\r\nleft and find what fraction of the humus consisted of vegetable\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nTry to find the proportion of vegetable matter in each of the following:\r\nloams from various sources, sand, clay, gravel. The last three will show\r\nscarcely any change. This experiment will give rise to some good\r\narithmetical problems in fractions.\r\n\r\nWATER IN SOILS\r\n\r\n5. Compare a handful of fresh garden soil with the same soil dried. Note\r\nthe glistening of the fresh soil, also its weight and darker colour. The\r\nfresh soil admits of packing though no water can be squeezed from it. In\r\nits best condition, the water of the soil adheres as a film of moisture\r\nabout every particle. Free water is to be avoided since it excludes the\r\nair from the soil.\r\n\r\n6. Equal weights of soils of different kinds and degrees of fineness are\r\nplaced in funnels or in inverted bottles with bottoms removed. Water is\r\nthen slowly added to each until it begins to drop from the lower end.\r\nFrom this is seen (1) the great value of humus as a water holder, (2)\r\nthe advantage of fine soil over coarse. For retention of water by\r\nabsorption, consult _Nature Study and Life_, Hodge, page 382.\r\n\r\n7. Take two wooden boxes (chalk boxes will do), fill one box with moist\r\nsand and the other with moist leaf-mould. Weigh the boxes separately and\r\nleave them for three or four days in a warm room. Weigh again and note\r\ndecrease from evaporation. The sand dries out much faster than the\r\nhumus. Test with clay, gravel, and loam, also with mixtures of these and\r\nleaf-mould.\r\n\r\n8. Take three paint cans; punch holes in the bottoms. Fill each with\r\ngood soil well shaken down. Stand the cans in water till the tops are\r\nmoist, then place them in a warm, dry place. Loosen the soil on the top\r\nof No. 1 to a depth of one inch; on No. 2 to a depth of two inches;\r\nleave No. 3 untouched. Find out after a few days which is drying out\r\nfastest. How may soil be treated so as to lessen evaporation of water?\r\n\r\nDRAINAGE\r\n\r\n9. Gravel and sand allow water to run away rapidly, but where the soil\r\nis fine or closely packed as in clay soils, under-drains are necessary\r\n(1) to carry off the surplus water, (2) to allow air to enter the soil,\r\n(3) to warm the soil (wet soil is colder than dry).\r\n\r\nTake two equal-sized tin cans, make several holes in the bottom of one,\r\nplace therein a layer of broken pottery or stones, and fill with good\r\nsoil. Fill the other with similar soil but make no holes for drainage.\r\nPlant in each can a healthy plant of the same size and kind. Water both\r\ntill the soil is saturated and continue watering every two or three\r\ndays for six weeks. Note (1) the progress of the plants, (2) the\r\ntemperature of the soils, (3) which plant has the largest and deepest\r\nroots. (See _Bulletin 174_, Ontario Department of Agriculture.)\r\n\r\n10. Take five equal-sized boxes, provide for drainage, and fill No. 1\r\nwith wood, earth, or humus, No. 2 with clay, No. 3 with sand, No. 4 with\r\na mixture of clay and humus, No. 5 with a mixture of sand and humus.\r\nPlant corn in each box, set in a warm room, and keep watered for two or\r\nthree weeks. Note in which case growth is most rapid. Set boxes in a dry\r\nplace and cease watering. Which suffers most from the drought? Which\r\nbakes hardest in the sun? Test the temperature of each after watering\r\nand standing in the sun for an hour. Sand is warmer than clay, also the\r\npresence of humus raises the temperature. This item is important, since\r\nmost seeds decay instead of sprouting if the temperature is below 45 deg.\r\nFahrenheit.\r\n\r\n11. Enumerate the services rendered to the soil by humus.\r\n\r\n12. In Experiment 10, let the corn grow for some time and determine\r\nwhether the very rich humus is the best in the end. Sand and clay are\r\nalmost altogether mineral; leaf-mould almost entirely organic; neither\r\nalone is good, but a mixture gives the best results.\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN WORK\r\n\r\nThe boys of this Form should attend to the fertilizing and spading of\r\nthe plots belonging to the girls of their Form. The girls themselves can\r\ndo all the rest of the work, and they should try to keep the plots\r\nlevel, uniform in size, and in a straight line. If the corner posts are\r\nkept in line and the plots made up the exact size, the appearance of\r\nthe garden will be greatly improved.\r\n\r\nThe pupils are now old enough to make their own choice of flowers and\r\nvegetables. Very tall growing plants, such as corn and sunflowers, are\r\nnot desirable in individual plots as they shade other plants near them.\r\nCorn is best grown in a large plot about twenty feet square. The same\r\nmay be said of vines, such as cucumbers, melons, squash, etc. If the\r\nplots are small, it is better to plant but a single variety, but in\r\nlarge plots from two to four varieties may be arranged to advantage.\r\nUsually rows of vegetables, such as carrots and beets, may be placed a\r\nfoot apart, cabbage about twice that distance, and tomatoes a little\r\nfarther apart than cabbage.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, plants should be placed so that when full grown they\r\nwill just touch, cover the ground completely, and thus prevent the\r\ngrowth of weeds.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the young plants appear above the ground, light cultivation\r\nwith rakes and claw-hand weeders should be started, so as to keep weeds\r\nfrom growing and at the same time to provide a loose surface or earth\r\nmulch for conserving the moisture and aerating the soil. Thinning should\r\nalso be begun when the plants are quite small, but it should not all be\r\ndone at once. As the plants increase in size, the best ones should be\r\nleft and the poor ones taken out. In some cases plants thus removed may\r\nbe re-set to fill vacant places.\r\n\r\nTREE SEEDS\r\n\r\nTree seeds that have been stored over winter should now be planted in\r\nrows in a small plot. The rows should be a foot apart and the seeds\r\nquite close together in the row. A cheese-cloth or slat shade should be\r\nused on this plot, as the hot sun is too strong for tree seedlings when\r\nthey first come up. They should have cultivation every week and watering\r\nin dry weather. Always water in the evening after school, or even later\r\nwhen possible.\r\n\r\nTRANSPLANTING\r\n\r\nPupils in this Form should have practice in transplanting, as well as in\r\nsowing seed. For this purpose seeds should be started about the first of\r\nApril in hotbeds or window boxes, seedlings transplanted into cold\r\nframes when two or three inches high, and then set out in the garden in\r\nthe latter part of May when danger of frost is past.\r\n\r\nTRANSPLANTING FLOWERS AND VEGETABLES\r\n\r\nChoose, if possible, a cool cloudy day. Water the plants thoroughly in\r\nthe hotbed or cold frame a few hours before lifting them. Lift them with\r\na trowel or small spade, and keep as much earth on their roots as\r\npossible. With a transplanting trowel, make holes deep enough so that\r\nthe plant will be a little deeper in the soil than before transplanting.\r\nUnless the soil is moist, a little water put in the hole with the plant\r\nis beneficial. The evening is considered best for transplanting if the\r\nweather is clear. If the sun is very hot, the plants should be shaded\r\nfor a few days until the roots become established and begin their work.\r\nShingles slanting over the plants from the south side and driven into\r\nthe ground to hold them in position are best. Papers held by means of\r\ntwo stones also give good results. The practice of covering them with\r\ninverted cans is not a good one, as the light is almost completely cut\r\noff. A few holes in the can would help considerably. Care must be taken\r\nto pack the earth firmly about the roots. Watering again twenty-four\r\nhours after transplanting is often necessary. If the plant has a leafy\r\ntop, it is best to take off some of the leaves, as they tend to give off\r\nwater more rapidly than the roots can at first take it in.\r\n\r\nTRANSPLANTING TREE SEEDLINGS\r\n\r\nNuts and other tree seeds collected the previous autumn should now be\r\nplanted in the forestry plots in rows a foot apart. As the seeds may not\r\nall grow, they may be planted close together in the row and thinned out\r\nthe following spring if necessary. They need some shelter from the sun\r\nthe first summer. In large plots this is provided by means of a slat\r\ncovering, but in a small plot cheese-cloth tacked on strips and fastened\r\non corner posts is satisfactory. When a shower comes, this cheese-cloth\r\nscreen should be removed so that the rain may moisten the plot evenly.\r\nSeedlings may be transplanted from the woods or from the forestry rows\r\nbefore the leaves open out.\r\n\r\nBUDDING\r\n\r\nIn budding, a slit like the letter T is made in the side of the young\r\nseedling close to the ground. The bark is raised a little at the point\r\nwhere the vertical slit meets the horizontal one, and a bud of desired\r\nvariety with a shield-shaped bit of bark (and perhaps a little wood)\r\nattached to it is shoved in and the sides of the slit bound down upon\r\nit. After the bud, or scion, has started to grow, the stock is cut off\r\nan inch above the point where the bud was inserted. The bud then makes\r\nrapid growth, and in two years the resulting tree is large enough to set\r\nin its permanent place in the orchard.\r\n\r\nCUTTINGS\r\n\r\nPupils in this Form should try to grow such woody plants as roses and\r\ngrapes from cuttings. Roses are frequently propagated by budding, as in\r\nthe case of apples and peaches. They may also be grown upon their own\r\nroots or from stem cuttings. Such cuttings should be from well-matured\r\nwood of the present year taken in the autumn and packed in moist sand\r\nover the winter. Make the cuttings about three inches in length. The top\r\nend should be cut off immediately above a bud and the bottom end just\r\nbelow a bud, as roots seem to start more readily from a node, or bud.\r\nSuch a cutting may have three or four buds of which only the upper two\r\nneed be left. If both of these grow, the poorer one may afterwards be\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nThese rose cuttings should then be inserted in a box of clean, moist\r\nsand to a depth of two inches, kept in a warm room, and shaded with a\r\nsheet of newspaper when the sun is very bright. Keep the sand moist but\r\nnot wet, and when possible have gentle bottom heat. When roots have made\r\nsome growth, transplant carefully into small flower-pots, using fairly\r\nrich, clay loam. In a few weeks they will be ready to plant out in the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nGrape cuttings should be taken late in the fall when the vines are well\r\nmatured. Such a cutting includes only two joints, the upper one being\r\nthe growing end and the lower the rooting end. They must be stored over\r\nwinter in cold, moist sand, but should not be permitted to freeze. As\r\nsoon as the ground can be prepared in the spring, set them out. They\r\nshould be placed on a slant of about forty-five degrees and covered all\r\nbut the top bud.\r\n\r\nLEAF CUTTINGS\r\n\r\nSome plants with large and vigorous leaves, such as many of the\r\nbegonias, may be propagated by means of leaf cuttings. Buds readily\r\ndevelop from cuts made in the large veins. Take a full-grown healthy\r\nleaf and remove the stem all but about half an inch. Make a few cuts\r\nacross the larger veins on the under side of the leaves at points where\r\nmain veins branch. Press the leaf firmly down on the top of a box of\r\nmoist sand with the under side next the sand. Keep the leaf in this\r\nposition, using small stones or little pegs pushed through the leaf into\r\nthe sand. Put the box in a warm room and do not let the sand become dry.\r\nWhen roots strike into the sand and buds develop from the points where\r\nthe veins were wounded, take a sharp knife and cut out the new plant\r\nfrom the old leaf and transplant it into a small flower-pot in good\r\nsoil. Sink the pot in a box of moist sand to prevent its drying out.\r\n\r\nROOT CUTTINGS\r\n\r\nSuch plants as \"sprout from the roots\" may be propagated by root\r\ncuttings. Sections of underground stems may also come under this\r\nheading, as in the case of horseradish cuttings. But real roots may be\r\nused for cuttings, as in the case of the blackberry and raspberry. The\r\nroots should be cut in pieces three or four inches long, planted in a\r\nhorizontal position, and entirely covered with two or three inches of\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nLAYERING\r\n\r\nBush fruits, such as currants and gooseberries, are frequently\r\npropagated by stem cuttings, as in the case of roses. Another method,\r\nwhich is known as layering, consists in bending one or more of the\r\nlowest branches down against the ground, fastening it there by means of\r\na forked stick, and then covering it with two or three inches of earth.\r\nThe part in contact with the moist earth will send out roots, while one\r\nor more shoots will come up. When roots and shoots have developed, the\r\nbranch is severed from the parent bush and the new plant set in its\r\npermanent place. Strawberries exhibit a sort of natural layering.\r\n\r\nPLANTING AND CARE OF HERBACEOUS PERENNIALS\r\n\r\nPerennials grown from seed the previous summer should now be set in\r\nclumps two or three feet apart in the perennial border or here and there\r\nbeside the fences or walks. The soil should be made fine and fertilized\r\nwith well-rotted manure from the compost heap before setting out the\r\nyoung perennials. Dahlias and gladioli which were taken in in the autumn\r\nshould now be set out. The dahlias should be divided and only the best\r\nroots used. Other perennials that have grown into large clumps should be\r\ndug up, divided, and re-set in well-fertilized soil.\r\n\r\nGARDEN STUDIES\r\n\r\nPupils in this Form have now had enough experience in the growing of\r\nvegetables and flowers to allow them to make intelligent variety tests.\r\nThey should grow some of the less familiar varieties and report on the\r\nmerits of each variety tested. This, however, should not be carried on\r\nto the exclusion of the well-known standard varieties. Let the pupils\r\nconsult the best seed catalogues available and choose for themselves\r\nsome varieties not already known to them. They should keep a systematic\r\nrecord of all varieties grown and the methods used in cultivating,\r\nfertilizing, etc. The knowledge thus gained will be of value in after\r\nyears, and the homes will also benefit by it.\r\n\r\nBIENNIALS\r\n\r\nThe pupils should observe the second year's growth of biennials. A\r\nspecial plot in the school garden should be set apart for this purpose.\r\nHave them plant in it a turnip, a carrot, a beet, a cabbage, or any\r\nother garden biennial saved over winter for the purpose. If desired, the\r\npupils might grow their own seed of these varieties. Notice (1) what\r\npart of the plant has become enlarged with stored up food and how big it\r\nis when planted, (2) how this part changes in size and texture as the\r\nflowers and seeds develop, (3) in what way this extra food seems to have\r\nbeen used.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD FLOWERS\r\n\r\nSTUDY OF THE TRILLIUM\r\n\r\nThe pupils bring the plants for the lesson. There should be a few purple\r\ntrilliums among the white, and some of the plants should have the\r\nunderground parts intact.\r\n\r\nDiscuss with the collectors their observations on where the trilliums\r\ngrow, the kind of soil, the depth of the root-stocks below the surface,\r\nthe uses of the root-stocks, insect visitors.\r\n\r\nCLASS-ROOM LESSON\r\n\r\nThe pupils are directed to examine the plant and flowers and find out\r\nall the means for attracting insects.\r\n\r\nFind out why the purple trillium attracts flies and beetles, while the\r\nwhite trillium attracts bees and butterflies.\r\n\r\nLook into the top of the flower; what figure do the tips of the six\r\nflower leaves form?\r\n\r\nUsing the names calyx and corolla, describe the circle of flower leaves\r\nas to number, colour, and relative position.\r\n\r\nFind the stamens and describe as to number and position; find out how\r\nthe stamens are fitted to ensure that the pollen will get upon the\r\nvisiting insects.\r\n\r\nFind the pistil and describe its shape. How is the stigma fitted for\r\nreceiving the pollen that is carried by the insect visitors.\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--The trilliums attract insects by their large white\r\nand purple flowers, which are held up by their long stalks high above\r\nthe three broad leaves. The strong carrion-like odour of the purple\r\ntrillium is attractive to flies and beetles, while bees and butterflies\r\nfind the fragrance of the white trillium more to their liking.\r\n\r\nThe root-stock serves as a buried store of food to tide the plant over\r\nthe drought of late summer and the severe cold of winter. The\r\nwell-stocked cellar also explains the flourishing condition of the plant\r\nin early spring. The six stamens stand on close guard around the pistil,\r\nand insects forcing their way to the nectaries are well peppered with\r\npollen.\r\n\r\nContinue the observation work by means of field exercises such as the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nWhat change takes place in the colour of the white trillium as it grows\r\nold?\r\n\r\nFind the ripened seed pods of the trillium, open them, count the number\r\nof chambers, and examine the seeds.\r\n\r\nDo trilliums grow from the same root-stock year after year?\r\n\r\nAs correlations, represent the trillium in colour and design an\r\nembroidery pattern based on it.\r\n\r\nLessons similar to that on the trillium may be based on adder's tongue,\r\nIndian turnip, Dutchman's breeches, violet, and clover.\r\n\r\n\r\nADAPTATIONS OF ANIMALS\r\n\r\nIt is not considered necessary to go outside the list of ordinary\r\nanimals to find sufficient illustrations of adaptations, and it is\r\nrecommended that attention be given to these during the study of animals\r\nprescribed for the regular Course. This may be supplemented by an\r\noccasional review of adaptive features for the purpose of emphasizing\r\nthe general fitness of animals for their varied habits and surroundings.\r\nCare must be taken lest the attempt to explain structures by adaptation\r\nbe carried to an extreme, for it is impossible to account for all the\r\nvariations in animal forms.\r\n\r\nThe following list contains a few of the many examples of adaptations to\r\nbe met with in the Course prescribed for Forms II and III.\r\n\r\nThe horse walks and runs on the tips of its toes; this gives greater\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nWild animals of the cow and deer kind can swallow their food hastily so\r\nthat they may retire to a safe retreat; there they regurgitate the food\r\nand chew it. The domesticated animal retains this habit, though there is\r\nno longer a need for it.\r\n\r\nThe wood-hare's fur is brown in summer, hence its enemies cannot see it\r\nagainst the brown grass and moss; in winter its colour is white, which,\r\nagainst the snow, is a protective colour.\r\n\r\nThe porcupine is very slow, but its colour and shape make it almost\r\nimpossible to distinguish from a knot on a log. Its quills form an\r\neffective protection when it is discovered.\r\n\r\nThe feet of the squirrel are adapted for climbing and its teeth for\r\ngnawing wood and for opening nuts. The tail serves as a balancing pole\r\nfor leaping from tree to tree and in winter it acts as a protection from\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nThe earthworm's shape and movements are suited to its habits of\r\nburrowing through the soil. Its habits of swallowing the soil fit it for\r\nburrowing and for obtaining its food at the same time.\r\n\r\nMany insect larvae, as the tomato worm and the cabbage-worm, are of the\r\nsame colour as the plants on which they feed, and this enables them to\r\nescape detection by birds.\r\n\r\nThe larvae of dragon-flies and May-flies breathe in water by means of\r\ngills very much as fishes do, but the adult forms are suited for\r\nbreathing in air.\r\n\r\nFemale birds are usually dull gray or mottled, so that their colours\r\nblend with their surroundings while they are nesting, and hence they do\r\nnot attract the notice of their enemies.\r\n\r\nBirds that swim have webbed feet, which act as oars for pushing them\r\nthrough the water. Their feathers are compact and soft for warmth, and\r\nthese properties, together with oil on their surfaces, make them\r\nwaterproof.\r\n\r\nThe tongue of the woodpecker is long, spear-shaped, and sticky; hence it\r\nis adapted for catching insects in the holes pecked into the wood.\r\n\r\nThe tongue of the toad is fastened at the front end, so that a flap can\r\nbe shot out for more than an inch in front of the animal, thus enabling\r\nit to catch insects on its sticky surface.\r\n\r\nThe toes of the frog are webbed to make them more serviceable in\r\nswimming.\r\n\r\nThe tail of the musk-rat is strong and broad like the blade of an oar\r\nand serves the same purpose as an oar.\r\n\r\nThe tail of the fish is more serviceable for swimming than legs would\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRD TYPES\r\n\r\nWOODPECKERS\r\n\r\nWoodpeckers are easily distinguished from other birds by their habit of\r\nperching in a vertical position on the trunks of trees with the tips of\r\ntheir tails pressed against the bark. While in this position, they tap\r\nupon the tree with their sharp, pointed beaks.\r\n\r\nTHE DOWNY WOODPECKER\r\n\r\nLearn to recognize the smallest of our woodpeckers, the Downy. Winter or\r\nsummer it may be found among the apple trees and shade trees, a tiny\r\nblack and white bird little bigger than a wren.\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nWhy is \"checkerboard\" a good name for this bird?\r\n\r\nAre there any distinct lines of white?\r\n\r\nAre there any patches of red?\r\n\r\nDo its movements reveal energy or listlessness?\r\n\r\nHow does it move up a tree trunk?\r\n\r\nHow does it move down a tree trunk?\r\n\r\nFind out how it can hold so firmly to the trunk.\r\n\r\nDoes it use its sharp beak as a drill or as a pick?\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--The downy is spotted black and white, with barred\r\nwings and a white line down the centre of the back. A bright scarlet\r\ncrown is the colour distinction of the male. This little bird is the\r\nembodiment of energy and perseverance. It hops nimbly up the trunk,\r\ntapping here and there with its beak, and then listening for the\r\nmovements of the disturbed wood-borers. If it wishes to descend, it\r\nwastes no time in turning around, but hops backward down the trunk, or\r\njumps off and flies down.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nExamine an apple tree upon which a downy has been at work and find out\r\nwhat it was doing there.\r\n\r\nDo you find the birds in pairs during winter? During summer? Distinguish\r\nthe male from the female.\r\n\r\nTie a beef bone with scraps of meat adhering to it to a tree. What birds\r\ncome to it?\r\n\r\nFind the nest of the downy and describe the nest and the eggs.\r\n\r\nDo the holes made by the downy injure the trees?\r\n\r\nWhy should the downy be welcomed in our orchards?\r\n\r\nDescribe the sounds made by the birds.\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--Discuss the pupils' answers to the above problems in\r\nthe class lesson, using a picture of a woodpecker to illustrate the\r\nfeatures of the bird that adapt it for its habits. Examples: the\r\nstraight, sharp beak suited for drilling; the two backward, projecting\r\ntoes for perching; the spines on the tips of the tail feathers to act as\r\na prop.\r\n\r\nThe downy woodpecker is very useful in the orchard, because it destroys\r\ngreat numbers of larvae of the tussock-moth and other insects. The holes\r\nmade in the bark have never been found to injure the trees. The nest is\r\nmade in a hollow tree, the entrance to it being almost perfectly round\r\nand about one and one-quarter inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe downy woodpecker has a very unmusical voice, but fortunately he is\r\naware of this deficiency, and his only attempt at music is drumming with\r\nhis beak upon a hollow limb or tree.\r\n\r\nThe hairy woodpecker, redheaded woodpecker, flicker, and yellow-bellied\r\nwoodpecker (sapsucker) are other varieties which visit the orchards and\r\nare suitable for lessons similar to these on the downy woodpecker. They\r\nare all beneficial birds.\r\n\r\nFLYCATCHERS\r\n\r\nMembers common to this class are: king-bird; house-phoebe, wood-phoebe,\r\nor pewee; whip-poor-will; least fly-catcher; giant fly-catcher.\r\n\r\nDirect the observations of the pupils to the following type features:\r\n\r\nBrownish or grayish colours; fringe of long bristles around the mouth\r\n(explain their use); whistling notes, varying with the different members\r\nof the family; habit of jumping from the perch, catching an insect while\r\non the wing, and returning to the spot from which the flight began;\r\nnests, chiefly of mud built in a protected place, as under a bridge,\r\nledge of rock, or projecting log.\r\n\r\nWRENS\r\n\r\nThe house wren may be studied as a type. Observe its brownish colour,\r\nfaintly mottled; its small size and energetic movements, its tail\r\nturned nearly vertically upward. Observe and report on other wrens,\r\nnoting any differences.\r\n\r\n\r\nCABBAGE-BUTTERFLY\r\n\r\nHave a plant of wild mustard or a cabbage growing in a pot. In June,\r\nhave the pupils, by means of the insect net, catch a number of the white\r\nbutterflies, the adults of the cabbage-worm.\r\n\r\nPlace the butterflies in jars or bottles and observe them. Make drawings\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nDirect the attention of the pupils to the difference between the wings\r\nof the male and those of the female. The former has only one dark spot\r\non the front wing, while the female has two spots on this wing.\r\n\r\nRelease the males and put the females in a vivarium with the potted\r\nplant. (A pasteboard box, with a large piece cut out and the opening\r\ncovered with gauze, makes a good substitute for a vivarium in this\r\ncase.)\r\n\r\nObserve the laying of the eggs. How many are placed at one spot? How are\r\nthe eggs protected? The eggs may be gathered from the cabbage plants in\r\nthe garden.\r\n\r\nObserve and record the hatching of the tiny worm, its feeding, growth,\r\nforming of chrysalis, development into adult.\r\n\r\nFrequently little yellow silken cocoons are found in vivaria where\r\ncabbage-worms are kept; these are cocoons of a parasite (braconid) that\r\ninfests the worm.\r\n\r\nBecause of the ease with which the cabbage-butterfly may be obtained and\r\nthe rapidity of its development in the various stages, it is very\r\nsuitable as a type for the study of metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nThe sulphur, or puddler (called by the latter name because of its habit\r\nof settling in groups around the edges of the water holes), is also a\r\nsuitable type. The larvae in this case must be fed on clover.\r\n\r\nTHE TUSSOCK-MOTH\r\n\r\nBegin the study of this insect in June and July by observing the larvae\r\nfeeding on the foliage of the horse-chestnut and other shade trees, and\r\ndirect attention to their destructiveness.\r\n\r\nIn observing the larvae, note the size, movements, legs, colour, coral\r\nred head, tufts of hair on the back, and the three long plumes.\r\n\r\nWatch the birds among the trees to discover whether they eat the larvae.\r\n\r\nOf what use are the tufts of hair? Do the larvae feed by biting or by\r\nsucking? Describe the damage done by the larvae.\r\n\r\nCollect a number of these larvae and place them in the vivarium with some\r\ntwigs of horse-chestnut. Observe the spinning of the cocoon and, about\r\ntwo weeks later, look for the emergence of the adult moths.\r\n\r\nObserve the two kinds of insects. Describe each. Are there any\r\ndifferences in the cocoons from which they emerge?\r\n\r\nWhich form of insect places the egg mass and is therefore the female?\r\nNote the number and shape of the eggs and how they are protected.\r\n\r\nThe female moths have no wings and do not move far from the cocoons from\r\nwhich they emerge, while the males have the power of flight.\r\n\r\nAs outdoor work, look for the egg masses on trees and fences and devise\r\nmeans of combating the tussock-moth.\r\n\r\nGathering and destroying the egg masses during the winter is found to be\r\nfairly effective in checking these insects. Since the cocoons\r\nfrequently contain parasites that prey upon the larvae, it is advisable\r\nthat only the cocoons that have egg masses attached to them should be\r\ndestroyed; the others are harmless and may contain the useful parasites.\r\n\r\nThe egg masses may be kept over winter in a box in a cool place, and the\r\nhatching of the tiny larvae and their subsequent rapid growth observed.\r\n\r\nPOTATO BEETLE\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this beetle may be found in early summer in clusters on the\r\nunder surfaces of the leaves of potato plants.\r\n\r\nEGG.--Observe the size, colour, shape, position, and number in a\r\ncluster; appearance of head from outer end after a week.\r\n\r\nLARVA.--Observe the colour, shape, head, legs, voracious appetite,\r\nmovements, rapid growth, destructiveness.\r\n\r\nPUPA.--Observe the larvae disappear from the plants; a search underground\r\nreveals the resting stage, or pupae. After ten days, the adult beetles\r\nemerge.\r\n\r\nADULT.--Observe the colour, the hard shell covering the head; the hard\r\nouter wings and membraneous inner wings; the hard shell on the under\r\nsurface of the body; the feelers, and legs.\r\n\r\nWhy will spraying with a poison, such as paris-green, kill these\r\ninsects?\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nDearness: _How to Teach the Nature Study Course Stories in Agriculture,\r\nBulletin No. 124._\r\n\r\n\r\nFISH\r\n\r\nThe Nature Study lessons must be based upon observations of the living\r\nfish, preferably in May or June, September or October. The best place\r\nfor this is on the bank of a clear stream from which it is possible to\r\nobserve the fish in their natural environment. Here their life\r\nactivities, their struggles, their conquests, and silent tragedies are\r\nenacted before the eyes of the observer. Many observations may be made\r\nin this way which will create a life-long interest in these reticent,\r\nyet active creatures. Since this method of study is practicable in but\r\nfew cases, the study of the living fish in the aquarium is the best\r\navailable substitute.\r\n\r\nThe teacher or the boys of the class can catch a few fish of three or\r\nfour inches in length and carry them in a jar of water to the aquarium.\r\nMinnows, chub, perch, catfish, or other common forms will do.\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe general shape, and the suitability of the shape for swimming.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the body and the protection it affords. Note the scales\r\nand the slime, the latter a protection against the growth of fungi, etc.\r\n\r\nThe gills--two openings behind the flaps at the rear of the head. The\r\ncolours, and their value in concealing the fish. The dark upper surface\r\nmakes it inconspicuous from above; the light under surface blends with\r\nthe shadow and dims it.\r\n\r\nThe divisions of the body--head, trunk, and tail.\r\n\r\nMovements of the fish and the part that the various fins play in these\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nNote that the broad tail fin is the most useful fin for locomotion, the\r\nothers act as balancers or as brakes, or for causing currents of water\r\nnear the gills. Observe the movements of the pair of fins nearest the\r\ngills, the movements of the mouth, and the currents of water entering\r\nthe mouth and passing through the gill slits. When a fish is kept in a\r\nvery small quantity of water, observe the effect produced on the\r\nmovements of the mouth and gill flaps. What are the uses of these\r\nmovements? The pupils will thus discover the nature of the respiration\r\nof the fish. Why do fish die if many are kept in a jar of water?\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nBy supplying various foods learn what kinds are preferred. Find in the\r\nactions or habits of the living fish evidences of a sense of smell, of\r\nsight, of hearing, and of taste.\r\n\r\nNearly all the following points of detailed study can be observed from\r\nthe living fish: shape; size; tongue; teeth; gill slits leading from the\r\nmouth to the gills; nostrils, number and position; eyes, absence of\r\neyelids; fins, size, build; the arrangement of the scales.\r\n\r\nPROBLEMS\r\n\r\nWhy does the fish require a large mouth?\r\n\r\nHow are the eyes protected? Compare the shape of the eye with the shape\r\nof the eye of a land animal.\r\n\r\nWhy are there no openings from the surface directly into the ears? Show\r\nthe suitability of the fins as organs of locomotion in water.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nSilcox and Stevenson: _Modern Nature Study_\r\n\r\nNash: _Fishes of Ontario_ (from Department of Education, free)\r\n\r\nKellogg: _Elementary Zoology_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nFORM IV\r\n\r\nAUTUMN\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN WORK\r\n\r\nThe regular work of cultivation of garden and experimental plots should\r\nbe carefully attended to. Pupils in this Form should be able to do all\r\nkinds of garden work with a good deal of proficiency. The work of\r\nselecting the best flowers for seed production should be continued.\r\nThese should be used for planting in the school garden and in home\r\ngardens as well. This part of the work might be left to the girls. The\r\nboys should be encouraged to take up the systematic selection of seed\r\ngrain. To get good seed to start with, two methods may be used:\r\n\r\n1. Decide upon the kind of grain to be selected and choose from one of\r\nthe best fields a hundred of the best heads--those that are vigorous,\r\nclean, free from rust or smut, and standing up straight. When the heads\r\nare dried a little, shell the grain off them and preserve it in a jar in\r\na cold, dry place until spring.\r\n\r\n2. Take a quart of oats and pick it carefully, keeping only the largest\r\nand most plump kernels. Keep this for spring planting. At the same time,\r\na sample of the poorer grains should be kept for comparison. A regular\r\nsystem of selection should be followed from year to year, taking enough\r\nof the largest, brightest, and most compact heads from the plot each\r\nautumn to sow a plot of equal size the next spring. After the selection\r\nof heads has been made, the remainder of the crop may be harvested, and\r\nthe grain from this known as general crop from hand-selected seed of the\r\nfirst, second, third year, etc. If the value per acre is required, the\r\nplots should be made of a certain size easy to compute, such as one rod\r\nsquare or one rod by two rods. (10-1/2 ft. by 21 ft. is about 1/200\r\nacre.) Samples of each crop should be kept in uniform bottles and\r\nlabelled; for example--\"From selected heads of 1911\". The yield per acre\r\nin the plot from which the selected heads came should also be noted.\r\nThese will be interesting for purposes of comparison and for testing\r\nduration of vitality later. If the same amount of grain is used in\r\nplanting a plot each time, the change in bushels per acre may be\r\nascertained and also in pounds per bushel. Some of the boys in this Form\r\nmay wish to continue this work of improvement by selection and, if so,\r\nthey should communicate with the Secretary of the Canadian Seed Growers'\r\nAssociation, Canadian Building, Ottawa, and receive full instructions to\r\nenable them to carry on their work practically as well as\r\nscientifically.\r\n\r\nHERBACEOUS PERENNIALS FROM SEED\r\n\r\nThe teacher should encourage the growing of herbaceous perennials for\r\nthe purpose of beautifying the school grounds. Many plants may be\r\nstarted from seed at the school and given to the pupils for home\r\nplanting. These plants require but little attention and provide\r\nexcellent bloom in gardens and home grounds from early in spring before\r\nannuals are in bloom, on into the autumn. A list of the best varieties\r\nwill be found in Circular 13, on _Elementary Agriculture and\r\nHorticulture_, a copy of which should be in every school. The seed plot\r\nshould be fertilized and prepared in the usual way, and the seeds\r\nplanted before the first of September. They may be started in June also,\r\nin which case they make more growth before winter. The plot should be\r\nwell fertilized with thoroughly rotted manure and, if the soil is very\r\ndry, the plot should be well watered the day before the seeds are\r\nplanted. The seeds are usually quite small and should be covered very\r\nlightly. The plot should be protected from the hot sun by means of\r\ncheese-cloth tacked on a frame. The plants should be watered twice a\r\nweek in dry weather. In the late autumn, when the ground freezes, the\r\nplot should be covered with leaves or straw and some boards, which\r\nshould be removed when the frost comes out in the spring.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECIDUOUS TREES\r\n\r\nBefore the pupils of this Form leave school they should be able to\r\nrecognize, by name as well as by sight, all of the species of trees\r\nfound in their vicinity. To this end the teacher should help them to\r\nprepare an inventory of species of trees, shrubs, and vines of the\r\nvicinity. They should learn to distinguish the different species of\r\nmaples, elms, birches, etc. A named collection of leaves helps\r\nmaterially in doing this. The influence of environment upon the growth\r\nand shape of trees and how trees adapt themselves to the conditions in\r\nwhich they live is a most interesting and profitable study, demanding\r\ncareful observation, reflection, and judgment.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nMuldrew: _Sylvan Ontario._ Briggs.\r\n\r\nKeeler: _Our Native Trees._ Scribners' Sons. $2.00.\r\n\r\nTREES IN RELATION TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT\r\n\r\nConsider the influences at work and their effect under the following\r\nheads:\r\n\r\n1. CHARACTER OF THE SOIL AND SUBSOIL.--It may be gravelly, pure sand,\r\nsandy loam, clay or clay loam, muck or humus, shallow or rocky, and the\r\nsubsoil may be sand, clay or hard clay with stones (hard-pan). Notice\r\nwhat species are most common in each kind of soil.\r\n\r\n2. WATER SUPPLY.--What species are found naturally in moist ravines or\r\nalong the margins of rivers and lakes, in bogs or swamps, on dry, sandy\r\nplains, or rocky hillsides. Consider also the rainfall.\r\n\r\n3. EXPOSURE TO SUNLIGHT.--Account for the lack of symmetry in the shapes\r\nof trees. Branches grow only where their leaves can get the light.\r\nAccount for the pith in many tree stems not being in the geometric\r\ncentre. Account for the rapid growth in height made by young trees in\r\nthe woods. Their light supply is chiefly from above, and they stretch up\r\ntoward it as rapidly as possible. Dim light causes rapid growth at the\r\nexpense, however, of strength of tissue, but as these young trees are\r\nprotected in the woods from the strain of wind storms, their slimness\r\nand lack of toughness is a benefit rather than a hindrance to them.\r\nAlso, the limbs near the ground die off while the trees are still young\r\nand small, giving us the clear timber tree, free from large knots, tall\r\nand straight. Make further application of this principle of light in\r\nrelation to the planting of trees for shade and for wood or lumber.\r\nAccount for the large size of the leaves of young trees in the dimly\r\nlighted woods as compared with the leaves of older trees. The principle\r\nof rapid growth in dim light is seen here also. It will be noticed that\r\nthe large leaves of the young trees are more thin, soft, and flexible.\r\n\r\n4. WIND.--Observe the tops of tall trees that have always been exposed\r\nto a strong prevailing wind as, for instance, those growing on the tops\r\nof hills or the eastern shore of a lake which has a prevailing west\r\nwind. The tops lean in the direction in which the prevailing wind blows.\r\nDoes strong wind help or hinder the growth of a tree? Examples of\r\nstunted trees on wind swept hills or shores readily show this. It will\r\nbe seen also that the higher branches are poorest on the side most\r\nexposed to the wind.\r\n\r\n5. SUITABILITY OF THE SPECIES TO THE CLIMATE.--Observe that some trees\r\nretain their leaves much later in the autumn than do others. The beech,\r\nhickory, red oak, and chestnut are good examples. These are on the\r\nnorthern extreme of their territory of growth. The tree best suited to a\r\nrigorous climate is the one that finishes its work early in the autumn\r\nand has all its tissues well matured before cold weather sets in.\r\nExamples: maple, elm, birch, and willow.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUITS\r\n\r\nEXCURSION TO A WELL-KEPT ORCHARD\r\n\r\nIf the teacher can arrange to take the pupils to see a well-kept orchard\r\nabout the time of the apple harvest, it will help to arouse interest in\r\nthe study of fruits. The trees, as well as the fruit, frequently show\r\ndistinguishing marks whereby they may be identified. Have the pupils\r\nnotice the following points: general shape of tree, colour of bark,\r\nshape of leaf, method of cultivation, fertilizing, pruning and grafting,\r\nspraying and its need, orchard pests, method of picking and packing\r\napples in barrels and boxes for market.\r\n\r\nSMALL FRUITS\r\n\r\nStudy the method of propagating strawberries and such bush fruits as\r\ncurrants, gooseberries, raspberries, and blackberries. Reports issued\r\nfrom the Fruit Division of the Experimental Farm at Ottawa give\r\ninformation regarding the best varieties suitable for different parts of\r\nOntario and Quebec. Have the pupils try propagating strawberries by\r\ntaking the stolons or runners; currants and gooseberries, by means of\r\nlayers or stem cuttings; and raspberries or blackberries, by root\r\ncuttings or the detaching of root shoots or suckers. Stem and root\r\ncuttings, when taken in the autumn, may be planted at once or may be\r\nstored in damp moss or sand in a cold cellar over winter. Stem cuttings\r\nshould be about the size and length of a lead-pencil and root cuttings\r\nabout half that size.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTUMN WILD FLOWERS\r\n\r\nObservations made with garden flowers should be supplemented by\r\nobservation lessons on a few selected wild flowers of the woods, fields,\r\nand roadsides. Although the spring months afford a much greater variety\r\nof wild flowers than do the autumn months, they do not afford quite as\r\ngood an opportunity for finding and studying them. The woods and fields\r\nare drier and more easily reached in the autumn and the fall flowers\r\nlast much longer. Some of the species seen blooming in spring and early\r\nsummer are now in fruit and scattering their seed, so that the pupils\r\nhave a chance to follow out the whole life history of a few chosen\r\nspecies. The pupils in this Form might select for special study the\r\nmilkweed, worm-seed mustard, wild aster, and goldenrod. These should be\r\nobserved out-of-doors, preferably, but suitable class-room lessons may\r\nbe taught by using similar matter.\r\n\r\nMILKWEED\r\n\r\nTaking the milkweed as a type, the following points are to be\r\nconsidered:\r\n\r\nThe kind of soil, where found, and whether in sun or shade.\r\n\r\nTry to pull up a small-sized plant. Dig one up and notice the\r\nunderground part.\r\n\r\nNote the size of the largest plant seen, also the size of the leaves,\r\nand how they are arranged to prevent overshadowing.\r\n\r\nBreak off a leaf and note the white sticky juice, whence the name\r\n\"milkweed\". Discuss this milk as a protection to the plant.\r\n\r\nNote time of first and last flowering of the plant and the colour and\r\nodour of the flowers. Watch insects gathering honey on a bright day.\r\nNote the little sacks of pollen that cling to their feet. They sometimes\r\nget their feet caught in little slits in the flower and perish.\r\n\r\nAfter the flowers disappear, note the forming of the little boat-shaped\r\npods in pairs. Select one that is ripe and notice that it bursts along\r\none side which is most protected. Open a pod carefully and notice how\r\nbeautifully the flat, brown seeds are arranged in overlapping rows and\r\nhow each seed has a large tuft of silky down that serves to carry it far\r\naway in the wind. This silk-like down is sometimes used to stuff\r\ncushions, and because of it the plant is sometimes called silk weed.\r\n\r\nOne species of butterfly in particular feeds upon this plant--the\r\nmonarch, or milkweed, butterfly. This is one of the few butterflies that\r\nbirds do not eat. It is protected by a distasteful fluid. Look on the\r\nunder side of the leaves of several plants until you find a pretty, pale\r\ngreen cocoon with golden dots, hanging by a thread-like attachment.\r\nEarly in the season the larvae may be found feeding on the leaves.\r\n\r\nThis plant is troublesome in some fields and gardens and so is classed\r\nas a weed. When the stems come up in the spring, they are soft and\r\ntender and are sometimes used as pot herbs.\r\n\r\nCORRELATIONS\r\n\r\nDraw a leaf, a flower, a pair of pods, and a seed with its tuft.\r\n\r\nWrite an account of a visit to the woods to study wild flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREES\r\n\r\nA study of the pines of the locality may be commenced in November, after\r\nthe deciduous trees have lost their leaves and have entered their\r\nquiescent winter period. This is the time when the evergreens stand out\r\nprominently on the landscape, in sharp contrast with the other trees\r\nthat have been stripped of their broad leaves and now look bare and\r\nlifeless. If no pines are to be found in the vicinity, cedar or hemlock\r\nmay be substituted. The lessons should, as far as possible, be\r\nobservational. The pupils should be encouraged to make observations for\r\nthemselves out of school. At least one lesson should be conducted\r\nout-of-doors, a suitable pine tree having been selected beforehand for\r\nthe purpose. The following method will serve as a guide in the outdoor\r\nstudy of any species of tree:\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE PINE\r\n\r\nHave the pupils observe the shape and height of the tree from a distance\r\nand trace the outline with the finger. Compare the shape of this tree\r\nwith others near by of the same species and then with members of other\r\nspecies. Have the pupils describe in what particulars the shapes differ\r\nin different trees. They will come to realize that the difference in\r\nshape results from differences in length, direction, and arrangement of\r\nbranches. They may notice that other evergreens resemble the pine in\r\nthat the stems are all straight and extend as a gradually tapering shaft\r\nfrom the bottom to the top, that all have a more or less conical shape,\r\nand that the branches grow straight out from the main stem and not\r\nslanting off as in the case of the maples and elms.\r\n\r\nComing close to the tree, the pupils may first examine the trunk. By\r\nusing a string or tape-line, they may find out how big it is around and\r\nthe length of the diameter. Tell them how big some evergreens are (the\r\ngiant trees of the Pacific Coast are sometimes over forty feet around).\r\nHave them notice where the trunk is largest, and let them find out why a\r\ntree needs to be so strong at the ground. Heavy wind puts a great strain\r\non it just at this point. Illustrate by driving a long slat or lath into\r\nthe ground firmly: then catching it by the top, push it over, and it\r\nwill break off just at the ground. If a little pine tree could be taken\r\nup, the pupils would be interested in seeing what long, strong, fibrous\r\nroots the pine has.\r\n\r\nLet them examine the bark of the trunk and describe its colour and\r\nroughness. The fissures in the bark, which are caused by the enlarging\r\nof the tree through the formation of new wood under the bark, are deeper\r\nat the bottom of the tree than at the top--the tree being younger and\r\nthe bark thinner, the nearer to the top we go. How old is the very top,\r\ndown to the first whorl of branches? How old is the stem between the\r\nfirst and second whorls? Between the third and fourth? Let the pupils\r\nfind out in this way the age of a little pine that is regular and\r\nunbroken. The whorls of branches near the ground are usually small and\r\ndead in young trees and in old trees have completely disappeared. Relate\r\nthe size of the trunk to its age, and also relate the size and length of\r\nthe branches to their age. Where are the youngest branches and how old\r\nare they? What branches are oldest? Notice how the branch is noticeably\r\nlarger just where it joins the trunk, as this is the point of greatest\r\nstrain. Are the branches the same length on all sides of the trunk? If\r\nnot, find one where branches are shorter on one side than on the other\r\nand try to discover the cause. Usually, if other trees are near enough\r\nto shade a certain tree, the branches are shorter and smaller on the\r\nshaded side.\r\n\r\nLet the pupils look up into the tree from beneath and then go a little\r\ndistance away and look at it. They will notice how bare the branches are\r\non the inside, and the teacher will probably have to explain why this is\r\nso. They will discover that the leaves are nearly all out toward the\r\nends of the branches. The leaves get light there while the centre of the\r\ntree top is shaded, and the great question that every tree must try to\r\nsolve is how to get most light for its leaves. The pupils will now see\r\nan additional reason why the lower limbs should be longer than the upper\r\nones. The greater length of the lower limbs brings the leaves out into\r\nthe sunlight.\r\n\r\nWhy this tree is called an evergreen may now be considered. Why it\r\nretains its leaves all winter is a problem for more advanced classes,\r\nbut if the question is asked, the teacher may get over the difficulty by\r\nexplaining to the class that the leaves are so small and yet so hardy\r\nthat wind and frost and snow do not injure them.\r\n\r\nThe pupils may each bring a small branch of twig back to the\r\nschool-room, if the white pine is growing commonly about, otherwise the\r\nteacher may provide himself with a branch upon which to base another\r\nobservation lesson in the class-room.\r\n\r\nIf the tree has cones on it, an effort should be made to get a few, as\r\nthey will also be considered in a subsequent class-room lesson. If the\r\ncones have not yet opened when they are picked, so much the better, as\r\nthey will soon open in a warm room, and the pupils will be able to\r\nexamine the seeds and notice how they whirl through the air in falling.\r\nIf possible, let the pupils have an opportunity of seeing pine trees\r\ngrowing in the woods as well as in the open.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE OF A CLASS-ROOM LESSON ON THE WHITE PINE\r\n\r\n~Inferences.~--If possible, each pupil is supplied with a small branch of\r\nthe white pine and the teacher with a larger branch which can easily be\r\nseen by all the pupils. Before proceeding to examine the specimens, give\r\nthe pupils a chance to tell what they now know about the white pine, and\r\nthus review the lesson taken out-of-doors. Then ask a few questions\r\nbearing upon their own observations, such as: What was the soil like\r\nwhere you found the pine tree growing? (They are found most commonly on\r\nlight, sandy soil.) Did you notice any difference between the shapes of\r\nthe pines in the deep woods and the pines in the open fields? Did you\r\nnotice any dead limbs on those in the woods? Why did they die? The\r\npupils may conclude that branches whose leaves cannot get the sunlight\r\nmust die. Show that this causes knots in the lumber and exhibit samples.\r\nThis explains also why the trees of the forest have such tall stems\r\nwithout branches for a long distance up from the ground. They get the\r\nlight only from above and seem to strive with the surrounding trees to\r\nreach it. If we want trees to grow tall, how should we plant them?\r\n(Close together) What would such trees be good for? (Making timber or\r\nlumber) If we want trees to grow low and have thick and bushy tops, how\r\nshould we plant them? (Far apart) What would such trees be good for?\r\n(Their shade and their beauty) Good shade trees should be thirty to\r\nforty feet apart.\r\n\r\nAsk the pupils if they have ever been near a pine tree when a gentle\r\nbreeze was blowing, and have them tell the cause of the sound that they\r\nheard. They may decide that the shape and size of the leaves caused the\r\nsound when the wind was blowing through the tree top. Have them examine\r\nthe branches in order to discover the following points:\r\n\r\nLEAVES.--These are in bunches of five, two to three inches long,\r\nthree-cornered, and with little teeth pointing toward the tip, light\r\ngreen near the tip of the bough (young leaves) and darker further down\r\n(older leaves); age of a leaf the same as the age of the wood it grows\r\non, therefore some leaves are one year, some two, and a few three years\r\nold. No leaves on four-year-old wood, therefore the leaves fall off the\r\nwhite pine the third year. Ask pupils to try to find out by observation\r\nwhen the leaves fall off the pines. Note the fragrance of the leaves,\r\nand that they are sometimes put into \"pine\" cushions, also, how slippery\r\nthey are to walk on.\r\n\r\nBUDS.--These are found at the tips of the branches, one large one in the\r\ncentre and several smaller ones grouped around it. Note their\r\nreddish-brown colour and that they are made up of scales overlapping and\r\ncovered with gum which keeps out the rain, thus protecting the little\r\ngrowing tip inside. When buds grow, they become little twigs with leaves\r\non. Find where the buds were a year ago. Notice the light colour of the\r\ntwigs that grow during the present season and the darker colour of the\r\ntwigs of the previous year. Where were the buds two years ago? What did\r\nthe centre bud become? (A continuation of the stem) What did the other\r\nbuds, called lateral buds, become? (New branches) Compare the growth\r\nmade in different years.\r\n\r\nNotice also how white the wood of the twigs is--the probable reason for\r\ncalling it \"white pine\".\r\n\r\nCONES.--Note the length and shape of the cones and how the seeds are\r\nplaced in them inside the large scales. Get some of the seeds and note\r\nthe wing-like attachment. Take the wing off a seed and drop it from a\r\nheight at the same instant with one that has its wing attached. Note the\r\nwhirling motion and infer what purpose the wing serves in scattering\r\nseed. Taste the kernel of a pine seed and discover why squirrels are\r\nfond of them. Burn a pine cone.\r\n\r\nFind out what birds like to live in this tree. What has been noticed\r\nabout them and their nests?\r\n\r\nHave the pupils keep the seeds until the following spring by putting\r\nthem in a box of dry sand and setting them in a cold place. They should\r\nthen plant them in a corner where they can be partly shaded when the sun\r\nis bright. Plant them about half an inch deep and keep them watered if\r\nthe weather is dry during the first summer.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The cones drop their seeds from high up in the tree so that the\r\nwind can carry the seeds long distances. The cones usually stay on the\r\ntrees for a couple of years after they lose their seeds.\r\n\r\nCORRELATIONS\r\n\r\nDraw a pine tree, a bunch of pine needles, a pine cone, and a pine\r\nseed.\r\n\r\nWrite a description of a pine tree seen in the woods; also of one found\r\nin the open.\r\n\r\nWrite a list of things for which the white pine is useful.\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--The winter months, besides affording an opportunity\r\nfor seeing trees and plants in their dormant or quiescent condition,\r\nalso afford an opportunity for reading and reflection, for recalling\r\nobservations and experiences of the past season, and for making plans\r\nfor work and study in the school garden, woods, and fields when spring\r\nreturns. The knowledge gained by the pupils through first-hand\r\nobservation of trees, flowers, and gardens can be greatly extended by\r\npictures and stories descriptive of these, which the teacher may from\r\ntime to time bring to the school-room. Their personal experiences will\r\nbe the basis for interpretation of many new things which will come up in\r\nthe reading lessons, in selections which the teacher reads from week to\r\nweek, and in books and papers which they themselves read in their homes.\r\nThus the interest that is aroused by the first-hand studies of plants in\r\ngarden, orchard, or woodland will be carried over from autumn to spring,\r\nand the pupils, with the awakening of spring, will take up anew the\r\nstudy of plant life with a keener interest because of the time given to\r\nreading and reflection during the winter. Illustrated magazines dealing\r\nwith gardening and with the study of trees and plants, and such\r\nmagazines as have a children's department, will prove of great\r\nassistance to the teacher who makes any serious attempt to interest\r\npupils in plant studies. Stories of life in the woods and of plant\r\nstudies suitable to young pupils should be used.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nMargaret Morley: _Flowers and their Friends._ Ginn & Co. 50 cents.\r\n\r\nMargaret Morley: _Seed Babies._ Ginn & Co. 25 cents.\r\n\r\nMargaret Morley: _Little Wanderers._ Ginn & Co. 30 cents.\r\n\r\nAlice Lounsberry: _The Garden Book for Young People._ Stokes. $1.50.\r\n\r\nGertrude Stone: _Trees in Prose and Poetry._ Ginn & Co. 45 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARATIVE LESSON ON VARIETIES OF WINTER APPLES\r\n\r\nKING, BALDWIN, NORTHERN SPY\r\n\r\nDiscuss the names, keeping and cooking qualities of the apples, and\r\nbearing qualities of the trees.\r\n\r\nProvide each member of the class with a typical representative of each\r\nof the above varieties of apples.\r\n\r\nCompare the three apples as to size, form, colour--including marks;\r\nhardness, length, and thickness of stem; depth of cavity at the stem\r\nend; depth and shape of the cavity at the calyx end.\r\n\r\nSplit each apple from stem to calyx and compare as to the thickness and\r\ntoughness of the skin, the colour of the flesh, the size of the core,\r\ntaste and juiciness of the flesh.\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--All three are apples of fair size, the Baldwin being\r\non the average the smallest of the three. All three are roundish, but\r\nthe King is somewhat oval-round, and the Spy, conical-round. The Baldwin\r\nhas a yellowish skin with crimson and red splashes dotted with russet\r\nspots. The King is reddish, shading to dark crimson. The Spy has a\r\nyellowish-green skin sprinkled with pink and striped with red.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful colours make all these apples very popular in the markets\r\nof American cities and in those of the British Isles; but the soft and\r\neasily damaged skin of the Spy makes it the least desirable as an apple\r\nfor export.\r\n\r\nAll keep well and in cool cellars remain in good condition until April.\r\nThey may be kept much longer in cold storage chambers, where the\r\ntemperature is uniformly near the freezing point of the apple.\r\n\r\nThe Baldwin apple tree is reasonably hardy within the ordinary range for\r\napple trees, and its yield is a satisfactory average. The King apple\r\ntree is not a hardy tree, nor is it a satisfactory bearer except in the\r\nbest apple districts. The Spy is a fairly hardy tree and thrives and\r\nyields well throughout a wide range; but it does not begin to bear until\r\nit is about fifteen years old.\r\n\r\nA comparative lesson may also be based on selected varieties of autumn\r\napples, such as Fameuse, McIntosh Red, Wealthy, Gravenstein, and St.\r\nLawrence.\r\n\r\nCODLING MOTH\r\n\r\nBegin the study of the codling moth in August by examining wormy apples.\r\nFind out, by asking the pupils, which orchards of the locality had been\r\nsprayed in the spring.\r\n\r\nAsk the pupils to count out at random one hundred apples and to select\r\nfrom these the number that are wormy. What percentage of the apples are\r\nwormy? Compare the percentage of wormy apples in unsprayed, with that in\r\nsprayed, orchards. The results will afford evidence of the benefit of\r\nspraying.\r\n\r\nFind out, if possible, the dates on which, and the conditions under\r\nwhich, the spraying of the orchards with the least number of wormy\r\napples was done.\r\n\r\nAsk the pupils to bring to the school-room a number of wormy apples.\r\nHave the pupils cut these open and note the nature and position of the\r\nhole, or burrow, and the amount of damage done to the apples.\r\n\r\nHave the pupils observe the larva and note the size, colour, shape, and\r\nnumber of legs.\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--The apple maggot is a less common insect larva and\r\nmay be distinguished from the larva of the codling moth by the fact that\r\nthe former has no legs and has the habit of burrowing in all directions\r\nthrough the pulp of the apple, while the larva of the codling moth works\r\nalmost entirely in the core.\r\n\r\nThe cocoon and pupa phase of this insect may be obtained by keeping the\r\nwormy apples in a box containing loose paper on which the cocoons will\r\nbe placed, or by searching under the bark scales of apple trees in\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\nDescribe the cocoons. Open some of them and describe the contents. Keep\r\nthe remaining cocoons in a box or vivarium in a cool place during the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nWhat birds are seen tapping at the bark scales of the apple trees during\r\nwinter? Examine the bark scales when a downy woodpecker has been at work\r\nand note that the cocoons have been destroyed.\r\n\r\nShould we encourage the visits of woodpeckers to the orchards?\r\n\r\nBy hanging up a beef bone in the orchard, various birds, including\r\nwoodpeckers, will be induced to visit and perhaps to make their homes in\r\nthe orchard.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n_Common Insects Affecting Fruit Trees, Bulletin No. 158_, Department of\r\nAgriculture, Parliament Buildings, Toronto.\r\n\r\n_Bulletins Nos. 158 and 171_, Ontario Department of Agriculture, deal\r\nwith many insect pests and their remedies.\r\n\r\nIn May look for the adult moths as they emerge from the cocoons. Observe\r\nthe colour, size, shape, and the bright copper-coloured horse-shoe on\r\nthe front wing--the \"brand\" of the codling moth.\r\n\r\nExamine the little apples when the blossoms are falling. Note the tiny,\r\nflat, oval-shaped egg at various places on the surfaces of the apples\r\nand a few days later the tiny worm which emerges from the egg. This soon\r\neats its way into the apple, entering usually at the calyx end. If\r\nspraying is done after the petals have fallen and just before the calyx\r\nend closes up, a drop of poison is inclosed, and when the larva enters\r\nit and begins eating its way into the apple, it gets the poison.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME COMMON ANIMAL FORMS\r\n\r\nBrief lessons should be given on some of the lower members of the animal\r\nkingdom, for the purpose of broadening the interests of the pupils. The\r\nfollowing are suggested as types: snail, spider, freshwater mussel\r\n(clam), crayfish (crab), centiped, milliped, salamander, and wood-louse.\r\n\r\nThese are common animal forms, most of which are frequently seen by the\r\npupils, but seldom are their interesting life habits or their places in\r\nthe animal kingdom recognized. The salamander is to many pupils a lizard\r\nof the most poisonous kind; centipeds and millipeds are worms, and they\r\ndo not recognize that the clam is an animal with sensibilities and\r\ninstincts.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nKellogg: _Elementary Zoology_\r\n\r\nSilcox and Stevenson: _Modern Nature Study_\r\n\r\nCENTIPEDS AND MILLIPEDS\r\n\r\nUnder stones and sticks in moist soil are to be found two worm-like\r\nforms, both having many legs.\r\n\r\nOne of these animals is flat, about an inch long, brown in colour, and\r\nprovided with a pair of long feelers. On each division of the body is a\r\nsingle pair of legs. This is the _centiped_. The other animal is more\r\ncylindrical in shape and has two pairs of legs on each division of the\r\nbody. Its colour is a darker brown than that of the centiped, and it has\r\na habit of coiling into a spiral shape, when disturbed, so that the soft\r\nunder surface is concealed. This is the _milliped_. Both of these\r\nanimals are quite harmless and feed on decaying vegetable matter. They\r\nstand midway between worms and insects in forms and habits.\r\n\r\nA brief observation lesson on each animal, involving their movements and\r\nthe structural features named above, will enable the pupils to identify\r\nthem and to appreciate their position in the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\nSALAMANDERS, OR NEWTS\r\n\r\nSome forms of these are found in water, as in streams, ponds, and\r\nditches, while other forms are found on land, where they hide under\r\nstones and sticks. They are commonly mistaken for lizards, which they\r\nclosely resemble in shape; but the two animals may be distinguished by\r\nthe fact that the surface of the body of a salamander is smooth, while\r\nthat of a lizard is covered with scales.\r\n\r\nThe small red or copper-coloured newts are the most common in Ontario\r\nand are frequently found on roads after heavy rains. The tiger\r\nsalamanders are larger than the red newts and are marked with orange and\r\nblack spots, hence the name \"tiger\". Many people believe this species\r\nto be especially venomous, while in reality it is quite harmless and,\r\nlike the other salamanders, is useful for destroying insects and small\r\nsnails, which form the greater part of its food.\r\n\r\n_To the teacher._--The superstition of the salamander's power to\r\nextinguish a fire into which it is thrown still exists. The early life\r\nof the salamander is spent in water, the young form being very much like\r\na tadpole. The salamanders are close relatives of the frogs and toads\r\nand may be kept in a jar or vivarium in wet moss or grass. The pupils\r\nshould learn to recognize the animals and should be instructed as to\r\ntheir habits.\r\n\r\nSPIDERS\r\n\r\n~Problems in observation.~--In how many places can you find spiders' webs?\r\nHow many forms of spiders' webs can you find? Are the many webs that are\r\nfound on the meadow grass in the dewy mornings the homes of spiders? If\r\nso, describe where the spiders live. (At the bottom of tunnels that run\r\ninto the ground.)\r\n\r\nWhat uses do spiders make of their webs? (Trapping prey, supporting egg\r\ncases, protection, and means of moving, as in the case of cobweb\r\nspiders.)\r\n\r\nDrop a fly upon a spider's web and observe the action of the spider.\r\nSearch under the webs of spiders in attics and sheds and learn, from the\r\nskeletons found there, what the spider feeds upon. It will be found that\r\nflies, beetles, and other spiders are killed by this monster.\r\n\r\nWatch a spider spinning its web and find out what parts of the body are\r\nused in this work. It will be seen that the threads are produced from\r\nlittle tubes at the rear end of the animal and are placed and fastened\r\nby means of the feet.\r\n\r\nExamine, by the aid of a hand lens, the feet and head of the spider.\r\nNote the \"brushes and combs\" on the former. Note, on the latter, the\r\nfour, six, or eight eyes (the number and arrangement vary), and the\r\nshort poison claws at the front of the head. How are the poison claws\r\nadapted for seizing and piercing? Note the sharp hooks at the lower\r\nends.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRD STUDIES\r\n\r\nContinue the lessons in bird identification and in bird types, using the\r\nmethods outlined for these studies in Form III. (See pp. 217-24.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nFORM IV\r\n\r\nWINTER\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREST TREES\r\n\r\nEVERGREENS\r\n\r\nSeveral species of evergreens have already been studied. These should be\r\nreviewed, and representatives of other species examined. Mid-winter is\r\nmost suitable for the study of evergreens. The following points should\r\nbe considered:\r\n\r\n1. Description leading to identification\r\n\r\n2. Nature of soil and water conditions\r\n\r\n3. Common uses of each species of evergreen\r\n\r\n4. Collection of wood specimens and cones.\r\n\r\nWOOD SPECIMENS\r\n\r\nSpecimens should be uniform in size and should show bark on one side and\r\nheart wood as well as the outside, or sap wood. They should be about six\r\ninches long, two inches wide on the side having the bark, and should\r\ngradually come to an edge toward the pith, or centre. When seasoned, one\r\nside and one edge should be polished and then oiled or varnished.\r\nSpecimens of the wood of the deciduous trees may also be prepared during\r\nthe winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUITS\r\n\r\nDuring the winter months, some time should be devoted to reading and\r\ndiscussing articles on general farming and fruit growing. Such articles\r\nmay be taken from books, magazines, or newspapers, and may be supplied\r\npartly by the teacher and partly by the pupils. These articles will be\r\nappreciated by the pupils all the more because of their studies of fruit\r\ntrees during the season. Such topics as the following may be discussed:\r\n\r\n1. Best kind of apples, plums, bush fruits, and strawberries. Reports\r\nfrom the Dominion and Provincial Departments of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n2. Method of raising fruit trees--from seed, grafting, and budding.\r\n\r\n3. Demonstrations in pruning. This may be done in early spring by taking\r\na class to a neighbouring orchard.\r\n\r\n4. Methods of planting and cultivation.\r\n\r\n5. Packing and storing.\r\n\r\n6. Spraying. Much information is to be found in Horticultural Journals\r\nand papers, and in Bulletins to be obtained from the Secretary of\r\nAgriculture for Ontario.\r\n\r\nIllustrated articles on gardening and fruit growing should be collected\r\nfor school use. Views of fine gardens, parks, and home grounds will be\r\nof interest to the pupils. Simple artistic methods of ornamental\r\nplanting with trees, shrubs, vines, and herbaceous perennials can now be\r\nintroduced, and some scheme for improving the school grounds outlined.\r\n\r\nCatalogues should be obtained soon after New Year's and, after examining\r\ntheir merits, the best varieties of seed and fruit for the district\r\nshould be selected. Horticultural societies, as well as Dominion and\r\nProvincial Departments of Agriculture, commonly give selected lists with\r\ndescriptions of the different varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEEDS AND WEED SEEDS\r\n\r\nThe training in the observation and identification of weeds and weed\r\nseeds, which was begun in Form III, should be continued in Form IV. For\r\nmethod see Form III.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL SCIENCE PHASE OF NATURE STUDY\r\n\r\nWATER PRESSURE\r\n\r\n1. Grasp an empty tin can by the top and push it down into a pail of\r\nwater. Note the tendency of the can to rise. The water presses upward.\r\nIts downward pressure is evident.\r\n\r\n2. Tie a large stone to a string, hold it at arm's length, shut the\r\neyes, and lower the stone into water. _Note_ the decrease in weight.\r\nThis is also due to upward pressure, which we call buoyancy. The actual\r\ndecrease may be found by means of a spring balance.\r\n\r\n3. Try Experiment 2, using a piece of iron the same weight as the stone.\r\nIs the decrease in weight as evident? Ships made wholly of iron will\r\nsink. Explain.\r\n\r\n4. Put an egg into water; it slowly sinks. Add salt to the water; the\r\negg floats.\r\n\r\nEXERCISES\r\n\r\n1. Will the human body sink in water? In which is there less danger of\r\ndrowning, lake or sea water?\r\n\r\n2. When in bathing, immerse nearly the whole body, then take a full\r\ninspiration. Note the rise of the body.\r\n\r\n3. Why does ice float? (See expansion of water by freezing.)\r\n\r\n4. Balloons are bags filled with some light gas, generally hydrogen or\r\nhot air. They are pushed up by the buoyancy of the air. The rise of\r\nheated air or water (see Convection) is really due to the same force.\r\nClouds, feathers, and thistledown are kept in the air more by the action\r\nof winds and small air currents than by buoyancy.\r\n\r\nSTUDY OF AIR\r\n\r\n     (Consult _Science of Common Life_, Chaps. VIII, IX, X.)\r\n\r\n1. Air takes up space. Put a cork with one hole into the neck of a flask\r\nor bottle. Insert the stem of a funnel and try to pour in water. Try\r\nwith two holes in the cork. When we call a bottle \"empty\" what is in it?\r\n\r\n2. Air is all around us. Feel it; wave the hands through it; run through\r\nit; note that the wind is air; inhale the air and watch the chest.\r\n\r\n3. Air has weight. This is not easy to demonstrate without an air-pump\r\nand a fairly delicate balance.\r\n\r\nFit a large glass flask with a tightly fitting rubber stopper having a\r\nshort glass tube passing through it. To the glass tube attach a short\r\nrubber one and on this put a clamp. Open the clamp and suck out all the\r\nair possible. Close the clamp and weigh the flask. When perfectly\r\nbalanced, open the clamp and let the air enter again. Note the increase\r\nin weight.\r\n\r\nIf an air-pump is available, procure a glass globe provided with a\r\nstop-cock (see Apparatus). Pump some of the air from the globe, then\r\nweigh and, while it is on the balance, admit the air again and note\r\nincrease in weight.\r\n\r\nTie a piece of thin sheet rubber over the large end of a thistle tube;\r\nsuck the air out of the tube and note how the rubber is pushed in. This\r\nis due to the weight or pressure of the air. Turn the tube in various\r\npositions to show that the pressure comes from all directions. To show\r\nthat \"suction\" is not a force, let a pupil try to suck water out of a\r\nflask when there is only one opening through the stopper. If two holes\r\nare made, the water may be sucked up, that is, _pushed_ up by the weight\r\nof the air.\r\n\r\nFill a pickle jar with water. Place a piece of writing paper on the top\r\nand then, holding the paper with the palm of the hand, invert the jar.\r\nThe pressure of the air keeps the water in.\r\n\r\nA cubic foot of air weighs nearly 1-1/4 oz. Find the weight of the air\r\nin your school-room.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere exerts about fifteen pounds pressure on every square inch\r\nof the surface it rests against. Find the weight supported by the top of\r\na desk 18 inches by 24 inches. If the surface of the body is eight\r\nsquare feet, what weight does it have to sustain? Why does this weight\r\nnot crush us?\r\n\r\nTHE BAROMETER\r\n\r\nThe experiments immediately preceding will have paved the way for a\r\nstudy of the barometer.\r\n\r\n1. Fill a jar with water and invert it, keeping its mouth below the\r\nsurface of the water in another vessel. If the pupils can be led to see\r\nthat the water is sustained in the jar by the air pressing on the water\r\nin the vessel, they can understand the barometer.\r\n\r\n2. Fill a tube about 30 inches long, and 1/4 inch inside diameter with\r\nwater, and invert it over water, as with the jar in the previous\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\n3. Use the same tube or one similar to that in 2 above, but fill with\r\nmercury and allow the pupils to notice the great weight of the mercury.\r\nHolding the mercury in with your finger, invert the tube over mercury.\r\nThis time the fluid falls some distance in the tube as soon as the\r\nfinger is removed. A tube of this size requires 1 lb. of mercury.\r\n\r\nLead the pupils to see that the mercury remaining in the tube is\r\nsustained by the air pressure, and that any increase or decrease of the\r\natmospheric pressure will result in the rise or fall of the mercury\r\ncolumn. Leave the barometer (made as in 3 above) in the room for a few\r\ndays and note whether its weight changes. The use of the instrument in\r\npredicting weather changes should be emphasized. Compare your barometer\r\nwith the records in the daily papers.\r\n\r\nThe average height of the barometric column is 30 inches at sea-level.\r\nExplain how you could estimate heights of mountains and balloons with a\r\nbarometer.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMON PUMP\r\n\r\nThis is a valuable application of air pressure. A glass model will prove\r\nuseful, but a model made by pupils will be much more so. (See\r\n_Laboratory Exercises in Physics_ by Newman.)\r\n\r\nThe water rises in the pump because the sucker lifts the air from the\r\nwater inside, allowing the air outside to push the water up. A common\r\npump will not lift water more than about 30 feet. Why is this? Compare\r\nthe pump to a barometer. (See _The Ontario High School Physics_.)\r\n\r\nEXPANSIVE FORCE OF AIR\r\n\r\nAir and all other gases manifest a pressure in all directions not due to\r\ntheir weight. The power of air to keep tires and footballs inflated and\r\nthat of steam in driving an engine are examples. It is this force that\r\nprevents the pressure of air from crushing in, since there are many air\r\nspaces distributed throughout the body.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF AIR\r\n\r\nThis subject and the three immediately following it have a special\r\nbearing on hygiene.\r\n\r\n1. Invert a sealing-jar over a lighted candle. Has the candle used up\r\n_all_ the air when it goes out?\r\n\r\n2. Place a very short candle on a thin piece of cork afloat on water in\r\na plate; light the candle, and again invert the jar over it. Note that\r\nthe candle goes out and the water rises only a short distance in the\r\njar; therefore _all_ the air has not been used up.\r\n\r\n3. Slip the glass top of the jar under the open end and set the jar\r\nmouth upward on the table without allowing any water to escape. Now\r\nplunge a lighted splinter into the jar. The flame is extinguished.\r\n\r\nAir, therefore, contains an active part that helps the candle to burn\r\nand an inactive part that extinguishes flame. The names _oxygen_ and\r\n_nitrogen_ may be given. These gases occur in air in the proportion of\r\nabout 1:4. (This method is not above criticism. Its advantage for young\r\npupils lies in its simplicity.)\r\n\r\nOXYGEN\r\n\r\nMake two or three jars of oxygen, using potassium chlorate and manganese\r\ndioxide. (See any Chemistry text-book.) Let the pupils examine the\r\nchemicals, learn their names, and know where to obtain them. Perform the\r\nfollowing experiments:\r\n\r\n1. A glowing splinter relights and burns very brightly if plunged into\r\noxygen.\r\n\r\n2. A piece of picture wire tipped with sulphur burns with great\r\nbrightness.\r\n\r\n3. Burn phosphorus or match heads in a spoon. A spoon may be made by\r\nattaching to a wire a bit of crayon having a hollow scooped on its upper\r\nsurface. A clay pipe bowl attached to a wire will answer.\r\n\r\nFrom these experiments pupils will learn the value of nitrogen as a\r\ndiluent of the oxygen. Pure oxygen entering the lungs would be just as\r\ndestructive as it would be entering the furnace.\r\n\r\nCARBON DIOXIDE\r\n\r\n1. Make a jar of this gas. Washing soda and vinegar will answer if\r\nhydrochloric acid and marble are not obtainable. (Consult the _Science\r\nof Common Life_, Chap. XIII, and any Chemistry text-book.)\r\n\r\n2. Lower a lighted candle first into a jar of air then into the jar of\r\ncarbon dioxide.\r\n\r\n3. Make some lime-water by stirring slaked lime with water and allowing\r\nthe mixture to settle. Shake up some clear lime-water with a jar of the\r\ngas. Pupils will be made to understand that the milky colour will in\r\nfuture be considered the test for carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\n4. Have one of the pupils cause his breath to bubble through some clear\r\nlime-water for a minute. Using a bicycle pump, cause some fresh air to\r\nbubble through lime-water.\r\n\r\n5. Hold a clear jar inverted over the candle flame for a few seconds,\r\nthen test with lime-water.\r\n\r\n6. Invert a large jar over a leafy plant for a day. Keep in the dark and\r\ntest the jar with lime-water.\r\n\r\nIs this gas likely to be in the air? Set a plate of lime-water in the\r\nschool-room for a day or two, and then examine it. Try to pour the gas\r\nfrom jar to jar and use a candle as a test. Is the gas heavier than air?\r\n\r\nOn account of its weight, the gas often collects in the bottoms of old\r\nwells, mines, and tunnels. It is dangerous there since it will not\r\nsupport life.\r\n\r\nUSES:\r\n\r\n1. Add a little water to some baking powder and cause the gas that forms\r\nto pass through lime-water. What causes the biscuits to \"rise\"?\r\n\r\n2. Mix flour and water in a jar, add a bit of yeast cake and a little\r\nsugar, and let stand in a warm place. Test the gas that forms, for\r\ncarbon dioxide. What causes bread to rise?\r\n\r\n3. Uncork a bottle of ginger ale, shake the bottle, and lead the gas\r\nthat comes off through lime-water.\r\n\r\n4. Most portable fire extinguishers depend on the generation of carbon\r\ndioxide.\r\n\r\nShow the similarity between our bodies and the candle. The candle needs\r\noxygen; it produces heat, and yields water and carbon dioxide. Much of\r\nour food is somewhat similar in composition to the wax of a candle; we\r\nbreathe oxygen, our bodies are warmed by a real burning within, and we\r\nexhale water and carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\nAfter exercise why do we feel more hungry? Why do we breathe faster? Why\r\ndo we feel warmer? Why does the fire burn better when the damper is\r\nopened?\r\n\r\nIMPURITIES OF AIR\r\n\r\nAll air contains carbon dioxide. If the amount exceeds 6 parts in\r\n10,000, it becomes an impurity, not so much on its own account as\r\nbecause it indicates a poisoned state of the air in a room, since\r\norganic poisons always accompany it when it is emitted from the lungs.\r\n\r\nOther impurities of the air, dependent on the locality and the season,\r\nare smoke, dust, disease germs, sewer gas, coal-gas, pollen dust.\r\n\r\nSOLUTIONS OF SOLIDS\r\n\r\n     (Consult the _Science of Common Life_, Chap. VII.)\r\n\r\nHave the pupils weigh out equal quantities of sugar, salt, soda, alum,\r\nblue-vitriol. Shake up with equal quantities of water to compare\r\nsolubilities. Repeat, using hot water. Is it possible to recover the\r\nsubstance dissolved? Set out solutions on the table to evaporate, or\r\nevaporate them rapidly over a stove or spirit-lamp. Try to dissolve\r\nsand, sulphur, charcoal, in water. Obtain crystals of iodine and show\r\nhow much better, in some cases, alcohol is as a solvent than is water.\r\n\r\nAPPLICATIONS:\r\n\r\n1. Most of our \"essences\", \"tinctures\", and \"spirits\" are alcoholic\r\nsolutions.\r\n\r\n2. Digestion is the effort of the body to dissolve food.\r\n\r\n3. The food in the soil enters the plant only after solution.\r\n\r\n4. The solvent power of water makes it so valuable for washing.\r\n\r\n5. Maple sap is water containing sugar in solution.\r\n\r\n6. In the salt region along Lake Huron, holes are drilled to the salt\r\nbeds, water is poured in, then pumped out and evaporated. Explain.\r\n\r\n7. Meat broth is a solution of certain materials in the meat.\r\n\r\n8. How could you manufacture salt from sea water?\r\n\r\nSOLUTION OF LIQUIDS\r\n\r\nTry to mix oil and water, benzine and water, oil and benzine. Only in\r\nthe third case do we find a permanent mixture, or solution. Try to\r\ndissolve vinegar, glycerine, alcohol, mercury, with water.\r\n\r\nAPPLICATIONS:\r\n\r\n1. Paint is mixed with oil so that the rain will not wash it off so\r\neasily.\r\n\r\n2. Water will not wash grease stains. Benzine is necessary.\r\n\r\n3. Why is it necessary to \"shake\" the bottle before taking medicine?\r\n\r\nSOLUTION OF GASES\r\n\r\nStudy air dissolved in water, by gently heating water in a test-tube and\r\nobserving the bubbles of air that gather on the inner surface of the\r\ntest-tube. Aquatic animals, such as fish, clams, crayfish, crabs,\r\nsubsist on this dissolved air.\r\n\r\nLIMESTONE\r\n\r\nPieces of this rock may be found in all localities. Teach pupils to\r\nrecognize it by its gray colour, its effervescence with acid, and the\r\nfossils and strata that show in most cases. If exposed limestone rocks\r\nare near, visit them with the pupils and note the layers, fossils, and\r\nevidences of sea action. Compare lime with limestone as to touch,\r\ncolour, and action on water and litmus. Try to make lime by putting a\r\nlump of limestone in the coals for some time; add water to this. Other\r\nforms of limestone are marble, chalk, egg-shells, clam-shells, scales in\r\ntea-kettles.\r\n\r\nGeographically, the study of limestone is of great importance. Grind\r\nsome limestone very fine, add a very little of this to water, and\r\nbubble carbon dioxide through for some time; note the disappearance of\r\nthe limestone. This explains how limestone rocks are being slowly worn\r\naway and why the water of rivers, springs, and wells is so often \"hard\".\r\n\r\nCatch some rain-water in the open and test it for hardness. It will be\r\nfound \"soft\". Place a few limestone pebbles in a tumbler with this soft\r\nwater and after a day or two test again. The water will be \"hard\".\r\n\r\nCompare, as to hardness, the water from a concrete cistern with that\r\nfrom a wooden one.\r\n\r\nCARBON\r\n\r\nProcure specimens of hard and soft coal, coke, charcoal, graphite, peat,\r\nand petroleum. Note the distinctive characteristics of each. Discuss the\r\nuses. Try to set each on fire. Note which burns with a flame when laid\r\non the coals or placed over the spirit-lamp. Put a bit of soft coal into\r\na small test-tube; heat and light the gas that is produced. This gas,\r\nwhen purified, is one kind of illuminating gas. Note the _coke_ left in\r\nthe test-tube.\r\n\r\nFill the bowl of a clay pipe with soft coal and seal it up with plaster\r\nof paris. After this has hardened, place the bowl in hot coals or in the\r\nflame of a spirit-lamp and light the coal-gas at the end of the stem.\r\nAfter all the gas has been driven off, look for the coke inside.\r\n\r\nHeat a bit of wood in a small test-tube and light the gas that is\r\nevolved. Note the charcoal left.\r\n\r\nCover a piece of wood with sand or earth; heat, and note that charcoal\r\nis formed. This illustrates the old method of charcoal-burning. This\r\nsubject is closely related to industrial geography.\r\n\r\nHYDROGEN\r\n\r\nA convenient way to prepare hydrogen is to use zinc and hydrochloric\r\nacid with a test-tube for a generator. (Consult any Chemistry\r\ntext-book.) Make the gas and burn it at the end of a tube, holding a\r\ndry, cold tumbler inverted over the flame. Note that water is formed.\r\nConclude what water consists of, namely, oxygen and hydrogen. Water may\r\nbe decomposed into oxygen and hydrogen, hence a use of hydrogen may be\r\nshown by attaching a clay pipe to the generator and filling soap bubbles\r\nwith the gas. When freed these rise quickly.\r\n\r\nMAGNETS\r\n\r\nIf bar magnets cannot be obtained, use a child's horse-shoe magnet.\r\n\r\nProcure small pieces of cork, wood, iron, brass, glass, lead, etc., and\r\nlet pupils discover which the magnet attracts.\r\n\r\nHave pupils interpose paper, wood, slate, glass, iron, lead, etc., in\r\nsheets between the magnet and the iron and note the effect on the force\r\nexerted.\r\n\r\nNote that when one end of a magnet touches or comes near the end of a\r\nnail, the nail becomes a magnet, but not a permanent one.\r\n\r\nMagnetize a needle by drawing one of the poles of the magnet from end to\r\nend of the needle, always in the same direction, about twenty times.\r\nSuspend the needle horizontally with a piece of silk thread and note its\r\nposition when at rest.\r\n\r\nGet a small compass and show how it is related to the foregoing\r\nexperiments. Emphasize its use to mariners. If possible, get a piece of\r\nlodestone and show its magnetic properties.\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY\r\n\r\nHalf fill a tumbler with water and add about a teaspoonful of sulphuric\r\nacid. Set in this a piece of copper and a piece of zinc, but do not let\r\nthem touch. Make a coil by winding insulated wire around a block of wood\r\nabout ten times. Remove the wood and place a compass in the centre of\r\nthe coil. Join the ends of the wire to the two metals in the tumbler.\r\nThe sudden movement of the needle will be taken as the indication of a\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\nLet pupils try experiments with many pairs of solids, such as lead and\r\nsilver, carbon and glass, wood and iron, tin and zinc, and liquids such\r\nas vinegar and brine.\r\n\r\nShow pupils how to make a simple battery. See home-made apparatus, page\r\n50, and consult _Laboratory Exercises_ by Newman. Two or three dry cells\r\nwill be found sufficient for any experiments, but the home-made battery\r\nis to be preferred.\r\n\r\nShow pupils how to make a magnet by winding a piece of insulated wire\r\naround a nail and joining the ends of the wire to the battery. Make a\r\nhorse-shoe magnet by bending the nail and winding the wire about both\r\nends in opposite directions.\r\n\r\nAs an application of the electro-magnet, show pupils how to make a\r\ntelegraph sounder. (See Manual on _Manual Training_.) If possible,\r\nexamine the construction of an electric bell. The motor and electric\r\nlight are other common applications of the current. Take up the uses of\r\nthe motor in factories, and for running street-cars and automobiles.\r\nShow the necessity for a water-wheel or engine to produce the current,\r\nand for wires to connect. Explain that batteries are not used to produce\r\nlarge currents, but that machines called dynamos, similar to motors,\r\nwhen driven by steam or water-power, will yield electric currents as\r\nbatteries do.\r\n\r\nSTEAM\r\n\r\nThe power of steam may be shown by loosely corking a flask and boiling\r\nthe water in it until the cork is driven out, or by stopping the spout\r\nof a boiling tea-kettle, or by letting a stream of steam impinge on a\r\ntoy paper wheel. Encourage pupils to learn all they can about steam and\r\ngasolene engines and their uses.\r\n\r\nFARM TOOLS\r\n\r\nThis topic should be dealt with only in so far as it can be made a\r\nsubject for actual observation by the pupils. Children should learn to\r\nbe thoughtful and observant and to do all kinds of work, manual as well\r\nas mental, intelligently.\r\n\r\nMACHINES\r\n\r\n     (Consult _The Ontario High School Physics_, Chap. IX.)\r\n\r\nLEVER.--When a _lever_ is used to lift a log, one end is placed under\r\nthe log, a block called a _fulcrum_ is placed under the lever as close\r\nas possible to the log, and then the workman pulls down on the outer end\r\nof the lever. For example, if the fulcrum is one foot from the log and\r\nten feet from the man, the latter can raise ten pounds with a pull of\r\none pound, but he has to move his end of the lever ten times as far as\r\nthe log rises. Try it. See other examples in plough handles, see-saw,\r\nbalance, scissors, wheel-barrow, pump-handle, handspike, crowbar,\r\ncanthook, nut-crackers.\r\n\r\nROPE AND PULLEY.--In the _rope_ and _pulley_ note that when the pulley\r\nis a fixed one, the only advantage is a changed direction of the rope.\r\nWhen the pulley is _movable_, the horse pulling will have only half the\r\nweight to draw if the pulley is single, one quarter if double, one sixth\r\nif triple, etc. Thus in the case of a common hay-fork the horse draws\r\nonly half the weight of the hay, but he walks twice as far as the hay\r\nmoves.\r\n\r\nCOGS.--If one wheel has eighty _cogs_ and the other ten, the latter will\r\nturn eight times to the former's once.\r\n\r\nBELT.--When a _belt_ runs over two wheels, one having, say, one fifth of\r\nthe diameter of the other, the smaller will revolve five times for one\r\nrevolution of the other.\r\n\r\nCRANK.--With a _crank_ two feet long, one may turn a wheel twice as\r\neasily as with one one foot long, but the hand will move twice as far.\r\nIf a wedge is two inches thick at the large end and ten inches long, a\r\nman may lift 1000 pounds by striking the wedge a 200-lb. blow.\r\n\r\nINCLINED PLANE.--If a plank twelve inches long has one end on the ground\r\nand the other on a cart four inches high, one man can roll up the plank\r\nthe same weight that would require three men to lift, but he has to move\r\nthe object three times as far.\r\n\r\nPROBLEMS\r\n\r\n1. Why is a long-handled spade easier to dig with than a short-handled\r\none?\r\n\r\n2. Which is easier, to dig when the spade is thrust full length or half\r\nlength into the earth?\r\n\r\n3. Can a small boy \"teeter\" on a board against a big boy? How?\r\n\r\n4. In helping to move a wagon, why grasp the wheel near its rim?\r\n\r\n5. In making a balance, why should the arms be equal? In a balance with\r\nunequal arms, compare the weights used with the article weighed.\r\n\r\n6. In using shears, is it better to place the object you wish to cut\r\nnear the handles or near the points?\r\n\r\n7. Where is the best place to put the load on a wheel-barrow?\r\n\r\n8. Notice how three horses are hitched to a plough or binder.\r\n\r\n9. Where would you grasp the pump-handle when you wish to pump (1)\r\neasily, (2) quickly?\r\n\r\n10. Stretch out your arm and see whether you can hold as heavy a weight\r\non your hand as on your elbow.\r\n\r\n11. Count the pulleys used in a hay-fork and determine the use of each.\r\n\r\n12. If a ton of hay is unloaded at five equal forkfuls, what weight has\r\nthe horse to draw at each load?\r\n\r\n13. Count the cogs on the wheels of a fanning-mill, washing-machine,\r\napple-parer, or egg-beater, and determine how the direction or rate of\r\nthe motion is changed thereby.\r\n\r\n14. Measure the diameter of the large fly-wheel of a thrashing-machine\r\nengine, and of that which turns the cylinder in the separator. Decide\r\nhow many times the cylinder revolves for one turn of the fly-wheel.\r\n\r\n15. Think of all the uses of a wedge. Draw one. Compare the axe, knife,\r\nand chisel with the wedge.\r\n\r\n16. How are heavy logs loaded on a sleigh or truck? How are barrels of\r\nsalt and sugar loaded and unloaded?\r\n\r\n17. There are two hills of the same height. One has a gradual slope, the\r\nother a steep one. Which is easier to climb? In what case is it farthest\r\nto the top?\r\n\r\n18. Why does a cow or horse take a zigzag path when climbing a steep\r\nhill?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nFORM IV\r\n\r\nSPRING\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF IMPROVING HOME AND SCHOOL GROUNDS\r\n\r\nThe study of plants should lead to an intelligent appreciation of their\r\nbeauties and a desire to have them growing about. Many of our native\r\ntrees, shrubs, vines, and herbaceous plants are quite as beautiful as\r\nsome that are procured at considerable expense from nurserymen. A great\r\nwork remains to be done in cultivating and popularizing our best native\r\nspecies. Up to this point the pupils have been getting acquainted with\r\nthem in their own natural habitat; the next step should be to use them\r\nin covering up harsh and offensive views about the school and home\r\ngrounds, in softening and giving restful relief to barren yards and bare\r\nwalls, to ugly fences and uninteresting walks and driveways.\r\n\r\nBegin to plan some simple improvements for the spring. These may be\r\nrepairing of fences and gates in order to protect the grounds from stray\r\nanimals, the cleaning up of the yards, the gathering of stones which may\r\nbe used in making a rockery, the planting of trees along the sides and\r\nfront of the grounds--a double row of evergreens to overcome a cold\r\nnorthern exposure or to exclude from view disagreeable features, the\r\nlaying out of a walk or drive with borders, flower beds, or shrubs in\r\nlittle clumps.\r\n\r\nPlans of grounds well laid out should be examined and discussed in the\r\nschool-room. Many illustrated magazines give useful suggestions. Plans\r\ncan be worked out on the black-board with the pupils. It will take years\r\nto complete such a plan, but the pupils should have a part in making the\r\nplan as well as in carrying it out. The aim should be to encourage the\r\nuse of simple and inexpensive things obtained in the vicinity, wherewith\r\nto produce harmony and pleasing natural effects.\r\n\r\nComfort and utility must be considered as well as beauty and natural\r\ndesign. In the school grounds the outdoor games must also be provided\r\nfor and sufficient room allowed.\r\n\r\nSuch efforts on the part of the teacher and pupils, if wisely directed,\r\nare sure to meet with the approval of the parents and must call forth\r\nthe hearty co-operation of the trustees.\r\n\r\nIt is not well to attempt too much in one year. It is better to do a\r\nsmall amount well than to leave much work in a half-done condition.\r\n\r\nMAKING AND CARE OF A LAWN\r\n\r\nThe soil must be drained and not too much shaded by trees. At first it\r\nshould be summer fallowed or cultivated every few weeks throughout the\r\nsummer, to kill the weeds and make it fine and level. A thick seeding of\r\nlawn grass-seed should be sown early the next spring and raked lightly\r\nin. All levelling and preparation must have been done the previous\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nCoarse grasses, such as timothy, should not be used on a lawn. Red top\r\nand Kentucky blue-grass in equal parts are best and, if white clover is\r\ndesired, add about half as much white Dutch clover seed as red top. If\r\nthe soil has been prepared as above, there is no need to use a foster\r\ncrop of oats or barley, as is done in seeding down meadows. Roll the\r\nlawn after seeding and also after heavy rains as soon as the surface\r\ndries. Shortly after the grass appears, begin to run the lawn-mower over\r\nit, so as to cut weeds or native grasses that may be gaining a foothold.\r\nWatering is dangerous, unless carefully and regularly done during the\r\nsummer, the evening being the best time. Merely wetting the surface by\r\nsprinkling encourages shallow rooting and therefore rapid drying out.\r\nRegular mowing and rolling are more important.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nParsons: _How to Plan the Home Grounds._ Doubleday. $1.00\r\n\r\nWaugh: _The Landscape Beautiful._ Judd. $2.00\r\n\r\nDepartment of Education: _Improvement of School Grounds._\r\n\r\n\r\nSOIL STUDIES\r\n\r\nWEIGHT\r\n\r\nUsing a balance, compare weights of equal-sized boxes of different\r\nsoils, dried and powdered fine. Note the comparative lightness of humus.\r\nWeigh a box of earth taken fresh from the field, from this compute (1)\r\nthe weight of a cubic foot of such soil, (2) the weight of the soil to\r\nthe depth of a foot in a ten-acre field.\r\n\r\nRepeat the experiment, making it an exercise in percentage.\r\n\r\nFill two glass tubes (lamp chimneys will do), one with finely powdered\r\nclay, the other with sand. Set the tubes in a pan containing water. Note\r\nthe rise of the water due to capillarity. Through which soil does it\r\nrise faster? Farther? Try with other soils. Try with fine soil and also\r\nwith the same soil in a lumpy condition. From this give a reason (1)\r\nfor tilling soil, (2) for rolling after seeding.\r\n\r\nSUBSOILS\r\n\r\nProcure samples of soil from different depths, four inches, eight\r\ninches, twelve inches, sixteen inches, etc. Note how the soil changes in\r\ncolour and texture. In which do plants succeed best? In most fields the\r\nrichest part of the soil is contained in the upper nine inches; the\r\nportion below this is called subsoil. This extends to the underlying\r\nrock and is usually distinguished from the upper portion by its lighter\r\ncolour, poorer texture, and smaller supply of available plant food. The\r\ndifference is due largely to the absence of humus. The character of the\r\nsubsoil has an important bearing on the condition of the upper soil. A\r\nlayer of sand or gravel a few feet below the surface provides natural\r\ndrainage, but if it be too deep, it may allow the water to run away\r\nrapidly, carrying the plant food down below the roots of the plants. A\r\nhard clay subsoil will render the top too wet in rainy weather and too\r\ndry in droughts, because of the small amount of water absorbed. Such a\r\nsoil is benefited by under-draining. A deep and absorptive subsoil\r\nreturns water to the surface, by capillary action, as it is needed. The\r\nsubsoil finally contains a large amount of plant food, which becomes\r\ngradually changed into a form in which plants can make use of it. Pupils\r\nshould find out the character of the subsoil in their various fields at\r\nhome and its effect on the fertility of the field.\r\n\r\nFERTILIZERS\r\n\r\nAlong with water, the roots take up from the soil various substances\r\nthat are essential to their healthy growth. Potash, phosphoric acid,\r\nnitrogen, calcium, sulphur, magnesium, and iron are needed by plants,\r\nbut the first three are particularly important. If land is to yield good\r\ncrops year after year, it must be fertilized, that is, there must be\r\nadded chemicals containing the above-mentioned plant foods. Land becomes\r\npoor from two causes: the plant food in the soil becomes exhausted, and\r\npoisonous excretions from the roots of one year's crops act injuriously\r\non those of the next season. Rotating crops will improve both conditions\r\nfor a while, but eventually the soil will require treatment.\r\n\r\nHumus contains plant food and is also an excellent absorbent of the\r\npoisonous excretions. It is added as barn-yard manure, leaves, or as a\r\ngreen crop ploughed in.\r\n\r\nThe chemicals commonly used comprise nitrate of soda, bone meal,\r\nsulphate of potash, chloride of potash, lime, ashes, cotton-seed meal,\r\ndried blood, super-phosphate, rock phosphate, and basic clay.\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTS:\r\n\r\n1. Sow wheat on the same plot year after year and note the result when\r\nno fertilizer is used. Sow wheat on another plot, but use good manure.\r\n\r\n2. Try the various commercial fertilizers on the school plots, leaving\r\nsome without treatment.\r\n\r\n3. Examine the roots of clover, peas, or beans, and look for nodules.\r\nThese show the presence of bacteria, which convert the atmospheric\r\nnitrogen into a form in which the plants can use it. Scientific farmers\r\nhave learned the value of inoculating their soil with these germs. A\r\ncrop of peas or clover may produce the same result.\r\n\r\n4. Observe Nature's method of supplying soil with humus.\r\n\r\nSOIL-FORMING AGENTS\r\n\r\nThere was once a time when the surface of the earth was bare rock. Much\r\nof this rock still exists and in many places lies on the surface, but it\r\nis usually hidden by a layer of soil. Soil is said to be \"rock ground to\r\nmeal by Nature's millstones\". The process is very slow, but it is\r\nconstantly going on. The pupils should be directed to find evidences of\r\nthis \"grinding\".\r\n\r\n1. RUNNING WATER.--Brooks, creeks, rain, and the tiny streamlets on the\r\nhills all tell us how soil is carried from place to place. Get some\r\nmuddy water from the river after a heavy rain. Let it settle in a tall\r\njar and observe the fine layer formed.\r\n\r\nWash some pebbles clean, place them in a glass jar with some clear\r\nwater, and roll or shake the jar about for a few minutes. Note that the\r\nwater becomes turbid with fine material worn from the stones. A process\r\nsimilar to this is constantly going on in rivers, lakes, and seas.\r\nAccount for the presence of gravel beds now situated far away from any\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n2. ICE GLACIERS.--How do these act on rocks? Show evidences in Ontario\r\nas far as these can be illustrated from the surroundings, such as\r\npolished rocks, boulders, beds of clay, sand, or gravel, small lakes,\r\ngrooved stones, etc.\r\n\r\n3. FROST AND HEAT.--See \"Expansion of Solids\", pages 189, 190. Look for\r\nsplintered or cracked stones. Why do farmers plough in the fall?\r\n\r\n4. WIND.--In sections near the lakes the action of the wind in moving\r\nthe sand may be seen and appreciated. There are other places where this\r\nwork is going on on a smaller scale.\r\n\r\n5. PLANTS.--Our study of humus shows the value of vegetable matter in\r\nsoil. Besides contributing to the soil, plants break up rocks with their\r\nroots and dissolve them with acid excretions. It is interesting to study\r\nhow a bare rock becomes covered with soil. First come the lichens which\r\nneed no soil; on the remains of these the mosses grow. The roots of\r\nmosses and lichens help to disintegrate the rock with their excretions,\r\nso that, with frost, heat, air, and rain to assist, there is a layer of\r\nsoil gradually formed on which larger plants can live. A forest\r\ndevelops. The trees supply shade from the sun and shelter from the wind,\r\nthus retarding evaporation. The roots of the trees hold the soil from\r\nbeing washed away. The dead leaves and fallen stems provide humus, and,\r\non account of the water-holding capacity of humus, the forest floor acts\r\nlike a sponge, preventing floods in wet seasons and droughts in dry\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n6. ANIMALS.--Pupils should make a list of all burrowing animals and look\r\nfor examples. The work of the earthworms is especially interesting. By\r\neating the soil, they improve its texture and expose it to the air.\r\nTheir holes admit air and water to the soil. The worms also drag leaves,\r\nsticks, and grass into their holes and thus add to the humus.\r\n\r\nDarwin estimated that the earthworms in England passed over ten tons of\r\nsoil an acre through their bodies annually. This is left on the surface\r\nand makes a rich top-dressing.\r\n\r\nTILLING THE SOIL\r\n\r\n1. It makes the soil finer, thus increasing the surface for holding film\r\nwater and enabling it to conduct more water by capillarity.\r\n\r\n2. It saves water from evaporation. (See Experiments 7 and 8, Form III.)\r\n\r\n3. It aerates the soil, enabling roots to thrive better.\r\n\r\n4. It drains (hence warms) the soil, assuring more rapid growth.\r\n\r\n5. It kills weeds.\r\n\r\nA large part of the work with soils may be done in connection with the\r\ngarden studies, though most of the above mentioned experiments may be\r\ntried in the school-room. In ungraded schools any of the experiments may\r\nbe made instructive to all the Forms.\r\n\r\nPupils should be asked to acquaint themselves with the common implements\r\nused on the farm. They should ascertain the special service rendered by\r\neach. See _Circular 156_, Dominion Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nGARDEN WORK\r\n\r\nThe work in gardening for Form IV should be connected with some definite\r\nline of experimental work. The garden should be so planned that a part\r\nof it can be used exclusively for experimental work. Co-operation with\r\nthe Farmer's Experimental Union of the Ontario Agricultural College at\r\nGuelph is advisable at this point. The following list of experiments is\r\nsuggested as suitable for boys especially, but no pupil should attempt\r\nmore than one experiment each year.\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTS IN PLOTS OUT-OF-DOORS\r\n\r\nExperimental plots may be of different sizes, according to the space\r\navailable, from a yard square to a rod square or larger. A plot 10 ft. 5\r\nin. by 20 ft. 10 in. is almost 1/200 of an acre, so that the actual\r\nyield on such a plot when multiplied by 200 is an approximation of the\r\nyield an acre.\r\n\r\n1. Testing of varieties of grains, vegetables, or root seeds, including\r\npotatoes new to the district.\r\n\r\n2. Testing different varieties of clovers and fodder grasses. These\r\nplots should be so situated that they can remain for three years.\r\n\r\n3. Thick and thin sowing of grain: Use plots not less than four feet\r\nsquare. They may be tried most easily with wheat, oats, or barley,\r\nalthough any species of grain may be used. Use four plots of the same\r\nsize, equal in fertility and other soil conditions. In No. 1 put grains\r\nof wheat or oats, as the case may be, two inches apart each way. In No.\r\n2 put the grains two inches apart in the row and the rows four inches\r\napart. In No. 3 put the grains four inches apart in the row and the rows\r\nfour inches apart. In No. 4 put the grains four inches apart in the row\r\nand the rows eight inches apart.\r\n\r\nIf possible, weigh the straw and grain when cut and the grain alone when\r\ndry and shelled out of the heads.\r\n\r\n4. Deep and shallow growing of grain: Use four plots similar to those in\r\nexperiment No. 3. Put the same amount of seed in the different plots. In\r\nNo. 1, one inch deep; in No. 2. two inches deep; in No. 3, four inches\r\ndeep, and in No. 4, six inches deep. Note which is up first, and which\r\ngives the best yield and best quality.\r\n\r\n5. Early and late sowing: Three plots are required. Plant the same\r\namount of seed in each and cover to the same depth. Plant No. 1 as early\r\nas the soil can be made ready; No. 2, two weeks later; and No. 3, two\r\nweeks later than No. 2. Compare the quality and the yield.\r\n\r\n6. Effect of sowing clover with grain the first year: Only two plots are\r\nrequired. Sow the same amount of wheat or oats on each plot. On one\r\nplot put a moderate supply of red clover and none on the other. Weigh\r\n(or estimate), as in Experiment 3 above, the straw and the grain\r\nproduced on each.\r\n\r\n7. Effect of a clover crop on the grain crop succeeding it the following\r\nyear: The same two plots must be used as in No. 6. When the grain was\r\ncut the previous autumn, the plots should have been left standing\r\nwithout cultivation until spring. When the clover has made some growth,\r\nspade it down and prepare the other plot in the same way. Rake them\r\nlevel and sow the same amount of grain in each again. Weigh the crops\r\nproduced on each.\r\n\r\n8. Test quality, yield, and time of maturity of several varieties of the\r\nsame species. Samples of such varieties of wheat as Red Fife, White\r\nFife, Preston, Turkey Red, Dawson's Golden Chaff, White Russian, etc.,\r\nmay be obtained from the Central Experimental Farm at Ottawa, if not\r\navailable in the district.\r\n\r\n9. Effect of different fertilizers (1) on the same crop, (2) on\r\ndifferent crops: This can be done either out-of-doors in small plots or\r\nindoors, using pots or boxes.\r\n\r\n(1) Effect on the same crop: For example, oats on plots four feet\r\nsquare. The following standard fertilizers may be used: stable manure,\r\nnitrate of soda, muriate of potash, and bone meal.\r\n\r\nOn plot No. 1, a dressing of stable manure,\r\n\r\nOn plot No. 2, four oz. nitrate of soda,\r\n\r\nOn plot No. 3, four oz. muriate of potash,\r\n\r\nOn plot No. 4, eight oz. bone meal,\r\n\r\nOn plot No. 5, two oz. nitrate of soda, two oz. muriate of potash, and\r\nfour oz. bone meal.\r\n\r\nOn plot No. 6, use no fertilizer. Record results.\r\n\r\n(2) Effect on different crops: Try a series of experiments similar to\r\nthe above, using (a) peas instead of oats, (b) using corn, (c)\r\nusing cabbage, (d) using potatoes.\r\n\r\nFUNCTION OF PARTS OF PLANTS\r\n\r\nThis may be introduced in Form III and continued in the next Form.\r\nAlready the attention of the pupils has been directed to the essential\r\norgans of the flower, namely, stamens and pistil. They have noticed the\r\ntwo kinds of flowers on pumpkins, corn, and many trees. They have seen\r\nthat only the pistillate flowers produce fruit and seeds, and that when\r\nthe staminate flowers have shed their pollen, they die. They have seen\r\nthe yellow dust that the stamens contain and have seen bees laden with\r\nit as they emerge from the heart of the flower. Have them watch the bee\r\nas it enters the flower and notice how it invariably rubs some part of\r\nits pollen-covered body against the pistil. When on the moist, sticky\r\ntop of the pistil, these little pollen-grains soon begin to grow,\r\nsending a delicate tube down to the bottom of the pistil to the ovary.\r\nInside the ovary are little bodies called the ovules that are moistened\r\nby a fluid that comes from this delicate pollen tube, and at once they\r\nbegin to enlarge and eventually become the seeds. The coverings\r\nsurrounding them complete the true fruit.\r\n\r\nThe use of the root in supporting the plant in its normal position is\r\napparent to every pupil. To demonstrate the firm hold it has upon the\r\nsoil, have the pupils try to pull up some large plants by the roots.\r\nThey will then notice the branching roots of some plants and the long\r\nconical roots of others. Compare the colour and other surface features\r\nof the root and stem. To prove its feeding power, try two plants of\r\nequal size, taking the root off one and leaving it uninjured in the\r\nother. Set them side by side in moist earth and notice which withers.\r\nTake all the leaves off a plant and keep them off for a few weeks. The\r\nplant dies if its leaves are not allowed to grow. Keep it in the dark\r\nfor a long time, and it finally dies even when water and soil are\r\nsupplied. The leaves, therefore, are essential and require sunlight in\r\ndoing their work. Their complete work will be considered later.\r\n\r\nHOW THE PLANT GETS ITS FOOD FROM THE SOIL\r\n\r\nWhen seeds germinate, the lower end of the caulicle, which becomes the\r\nroot, bears large numbers of root-hairs. Inside the root-hairs is\r\nprotoplasm and cell sap. These root-hairs grow among the soil particles\r\nwhich lie covered over with a thin film of moisture. It is this moisture\r\nthat is taken up by these root-hairs, and in it is a small amount of\r\nmineral matter in solution which helps to sustain the plant. The\r\ntransmission of soil water through the delicate cell walls of these\r\nroot-hairs is known as _osmosis_.\r\n\r\nGERMINATION OF SOME OF THE COMMON GRAINS\r\n\r\nMake a special study of corn, wheat, and buckwheat. Take three plates\r\nand put moist sand in each to a depth of about half an inch. Spread over\r\nthis a piece of damp cloth. Put in No. 1, one hundred grains of corn; in\r\nNo. 2, the same number of grains of wheat; and in No. 3, the same number\r\nof grains of buckwheat, peas, or beans. Cover each plate with another\r\npiece of damp cloth and invert another plate over each to prevent drying\r\nout. Keep in a warm room and do not allow the cloths to become dry. If\r\none of the cloths be left hanging six or eight inches over the side of\r\nthe plate and dipping into a dish of water, the whole cloth will be kept\r\nmoist by capillarity. Note the following points:\r\n\r\n1. Changes in the size of the seeds during the first twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n2. In which variety germination seems most rapid.\r\n\r\n3. The percentage vitality, that is, the number of seeds which germinate\r\nout of one hundred.\r\n\r\n4. The nature of the coverings and their use. (Protection to the parts\r\ninside)\r\n\r\n5. The parts of the seed inside. (Buckwheat, pea, or bean divides into\r\ntwo parts, which become greenish and are called seed leaves. Wheat and\r\ncorn do not divide thus.)\r\n\r\n6. The first signs of growth. A little shoot or tiny plant begins to\r\ndevelop at one end of the seed. Note which end bears this tiny plant.\r\n\r\n7. Note the development of this embryo plant and the formation of stem\r\nand root.\r\n\r\n8. Of what use is the bulky part of the seed? To answer this, let the\r\npupils separate the white part of a kernel of corn, which is attached to\r\nthe embryo plant, from the pulpy mass surrounding it. Set five such\r\nplants in moist sand and also five germinating seeds not so dissected.\r\nPupils will discover that the mass surrounding the embryo is for the\r\nnourishing of the embryo plant. It is a little store of food prepared by\r\nthe mother plant for the little ones that grow from the seeds. Note that\r\nit disappears as the plant grows.\r\n\r\nTo further show the great value of this stored plant food, put a\r\nlarge-sized pea in a pot of moist moss or sawdust for a few days. When\r\nit has germinated and its root is a couple of inches long, place the pea\r\nin a thistle tube or small funnel, with the root projecting down the\r\ntube into a glass of water in which the funnel tube rests. Place all in\r\na sunny window and note how much growth the plant is able to make\r\nwithout any food except that which the seed contained.\r\n\r\n9. Note the development of the root and root-hairs. It is by means of\r\nthese root-hairs that the plant absorbs moisture. The branching form of\r\nthe root gives greater support to the plant and increased area for\r\nabsorption of water by means of root-hairs.\r\n\r\nTo show the direction taken by the root and also by the shoot, take a\r\nglass jar with straight sides like a battery jar (a large fruit jar will\r\ndo); line it inside with a layer of blotting-paper and then fill it with\r\nmoist sawdust. Drop seeds of sunflower or squash down between the paper\r\nand the glass. The moisture from the blotting-paper will cause them to\r\nsprout, the shoot or stem always taking an upward direction and the root\r\nturning downward quite regardless of the position in which the seeds\r\nwere placed.\r\n\r\n10. Apply this study to seed planting: Plant seeds of wheat in four pots\r\nof soil, No. 1, half an inch deep; No. 2, two inches; No. 3, four\r\ninches; No. 4, six inches. Repeat this experiment, using buckwheat. What\r\nseeds are up first? What seeds last? Which are best after a week? After\r\nthree or four weeks? From this experiment could you recommend a certain\r\ndepth for the planting of wheat and buckwheat?\r\n\r\n11. Does the kind of soil make any difference? To answer this have\r\ndifferent pupils choose different soils, such as (1) coarse sand, (2)\r\nfine sand, (3) wet clay, (4) humus or leaf mould, (5) mixed soil or\r\nloam; and let each put in grains of wheat, two inches deep.\r\n\r\nAllow five other pupils to plant seeds of buckwheat, under similar\r\nconditions. Treat all pots alike as to time of watering and quantity of\r\nwater used on each and give them all equal light and heat. Note which\r\ncome up first. Which are highest in one week, in two weeks, in four\r\nweeks?\r\n\r\n12. This study may be continued in the garden by planting one plot each\r\nof corn, wheat, and buckwheat. Plots ten feet by twenty feet are large\r\nenough. Observe the rate of development in the plots. Which seems to\r\nmature most quickly? Which blossoms first? In what respect are the\r\nleaves of these plants alike or unlike? How do the stems differ?\r\n\r\nExamine the blossoming and seed formation. When the grains are ripe,\r\ncollect a hundred of the best looking and most compact heads of each\r\ngrain and also a hundred of the smallest heads of each. Dry, shell, and\r\nstore the two samples of each grain in separate bottles. These samples\r\nare for planting the following spring.\r\n\r\n13. To show the need of moisture in germination: Fill two flower-pots or\r\ncans with dry sand; put seeds of sunflower in each, covering them an\r\ninch deep. Put water in one pot and none in the other. Examine both pots\r\nafter two or three days.\r\n\r\n14. To show that heat is needed for germination of seeds: Plant\r\nsunflower seeds in two pots as above; place one in a warm room and the\r\nother in a cold room or refrigerator; water both and observe result in\r\nthree days.\r\n\r\n15. To show that air is necessary for germination: Fill a pint sealer\r\nwith hydrogen (the gas collected over water in the usual way, as shown\r\nin any Chemistry text-book). Put a few sunflower seeds in a small sponge\r\nor wrap them loosely in a piece of soft cloth. Keeping the mouth of the\r\njar which has been inverted over water and filled with hydrogen, under\r\nthe surface of the water, introduce the sponge containing the seeds, by\r\nputting it under the water and pushing it up into the jar. Seal the jar\r\nwithout letting the gas get out. Put some seeds in another jar in a wet\r\nsponge and leave the jar uncovered. Compare results after several days.\r\n\r\nHere is a second experiment to prove this. Boil some water in a beaker\r\nin order to drive out all the air, put a few grains of rice in the\r\nwater, and then add enough oil to make a thin covering on the water.\r\nThis covering will prevent air from mixing with the water again. Put\r\nsome rice in a second beaker without boiling or adding the oil. Leave\r\nthe beakers side by side in a warm room for a week. The seeds will not\r\ngerminate in the boiled water. It is not always easy to get rice that\r\nwill germinate, but when it has been procured, the experiment is easy\r\nand very interesting. Any other seeds, such as those of pond lily and\r\neel-grass, that germinate readily under water, will do as well as rice.\r\n\r\nWEEDS\r\n\r\nPupils in this Form should learn to identify a large number of weeds and\r\nweed seeds. The collecting and mounting of weeds and weed seeds the\r\nprevious summer and autumn will have helped to prepare them for this\r\nwork. In the spring, when flower and vegetable seeds are coming up in\r\nthe garden, it is often difficult for pupils to distinguish the weeds\r\nfrom the useful plants. To help in this work of distinguishing the good\r\nfrom the bad, the teacher should arrange for a plot having, say, ten\r\nrows, one row for each variety of weed selected. Each row should be\r\ndesignated by a number instead of a name. The identification of these\r\ngrowing weeds by name may be given as a problem to the pupils. This\r\nplot should remain until the pupils have observed the manner of growth\r\nof each variety, the blossoming and seed formation, and then the root\r\ngrowth, as they are being uprooted previous to the ripening of the seed.\r\nEach pupil should prepare a brief description of each of the ten\r\nvarieties studied, and make drawings of the plant and its parts,\r\nespecially the leaf, flower, seed, and root. They should learn the best\r\nmethods of eradication and add these in their notes. _Farm Weeds_ will\r\nbe of great value in such weed studies.\r\n\r\nVINES\r\n\r\nSuitable garden vines for study are climbing nasturtium, scarlet runner\r\nbean, and Japanese hop. Their growth and method of climbing should be\r\ncompared with that of the sweet-pea and morning-glory already studied.\r\nObserve particularly the kind of leaves and their arrangement, also the\r\nflowers and fruit. Observe also the gourd family--melon, cucumber, and\r\nsquash--their tendency to climb, and the nature of their flowers and\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nWILD FLOWERS\r\n\r\nIn schools where the studies with garden plants, such as have been\r\nindicated, can be carried on, there will not be as much time for the\r\nstudy of wild flowers as in those schools where no garden plants are\r\navailable. A definite list of wild flowers for study should be arranged\r\nby the teacher early in spring.\r\n\r\nThe following are common in most parts of Ontario: squirrel-corn,\r\nDutchman's breeches, blue cohosh, dog's-tooth violet, water-parsnip,\r\ncatnip, and mallow. In each study observe the following points:\r\n\r\n1. Description of leaves and flowers for identification.\r\n\r\n2. Storing of food in underground parts.\r\n\r\n3. Time of flowering. (Pupils of this Form should keep a flower\r\ncalendar.)\r\n\r\n4. Description of fruit and seeds and how these are scattered.\r\n\r\n5. Their location, and the character of the soil where found.\r\n\r\nEncourage the pupils to transplant a specimen of each from the woods to\r\nthe school or home garden. Moist humus soil and partial shade are the\r\nbest conditions for the growth of these wild wood flowers. Review the\r\ntype lessons given already for Primary classes and apply the information\r\nthus gained to the observational study of the varieties of flowers named\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nPLANTING OF TREES, SHRUBS, AND HERBACEOUS PERENNIALS IN HOME AND SCHOOL\r\nGROUNDS\r\n\r\nThis work should be the outcome of the plans made in the winter. If each\r\npupil does a little toward the carrying out of the scheme of planting,\r\nthe grounds will soon be wonderfully improved. The teacher should guard\r\nagainst over-planting and arrange for the care of the shrubs and flowers\r\nduring the summer holidays.\r\n\r\nNew varieties of herbaceous perennials, grown from seed planted the\r\nprevious summer or procured from homes in the vicinity, should be\r\nintroduced. As most herbaceous perennials become too thick after a few\r\nyears, it is necessary to keep digging some out year by year, dividing\r\nand resetting them, and fertilizing the ground.\r\n\r\nNative trees and shrubs should be placed so as to obscure undesirable\r\nviews, such as closets and outbuildings, rough fences, or bare walls.\r\nThis principle in planting should be observed in the case of trees.\r\nEvergreen trees are particularly desirable as screens and shelters from\r\ncold winds. No planting should be done, on the other hand, that would\r\nshut out a good view of the school or obscure a beautiful landscape. Too\r\nfrequently unused corners of the school ground are covered with weeds.\r\nPrevent this by putting trees there and also shrubs. Keep all centres\r\nopen, and let the trees, shrubs, and flowering perennials be massed\r\nabout the corners and along the sides. The informal method of planting\r\nis to be preferred to formal planting of designs. The Public School\r\nInspector will provide a copy of a departmental circular on the\r\n_Improvement of School Grounds_, which should be carefully studied by\r\nevery teacher.\r\n\r\nSHADE TREES\r\n\r\nConsider suitable varieties to plant for shade and for ornamental\r\neffects. White elm, hard and soft maple, white birch, pines, and spruces\r\nare among the best. Elms and maples are excellent trees for roadside or\r\nstreet planting, and should be about forty feet apart. Spruces and pines\r\nmay be planted five or six feet apart along the north and west, to act\r\nas a wind break. Otherwise, evergreens are best when planted in\r\ntriangular clumps. White birch is particularly ornamental against a dark\r\nbackground of evergreens. Specimen trees of horse-chestnut, beech, ash,\r\nand hickory are also desirable.\r\n\r\nTRANSPLANTING\r\n\r\nThe best time for transplanting trees is in the autumn after the leaves\r\nhave fallen, or in the spring before the buds have opened.\r\n\r\nIn planting a tree, the following points should be observed:\r\n\r\n1. Preserve as much of the root system as possible, and trim off all\r\nbroken or bruised portions.\r\n\r\n2. Do not expose the roots to sun or wind while out of the ground. This\r\nis especially important in transplanting evergreens.\r\n\r\n3. Reduce the top of the tree sufficiently to balance with the reduced\r\nroot system.\r\n\r\n4. Set the tree a few inches deeper than it was before transplanting.\r\n\r\n5. Pack the best top soil closely about the roots, so as to exclude all\r\nair spaces, since these tend to dry the delicate roots.\r\n\r\n6. If the ground is very dry, water should be used in planting;\r\notherwise it is of no advantage. Water the trees thoroughly once a week\r\nin dry weather during the first season.\r\n\r\n7. After planting, put a mulch or covering of fine straw, grass, or\r\nchips for two or three feet around the tree; or establish a soil mulch\r\nand keep down the grass by frequent cultivation. Grass roots dry out the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n8. In the case of deciduous trees, have the lowest limbs at least seven\r\nfeet from the ground. Evergreens, however, should never be trimmed, but\r\nshould have their branches right from the ground up--this uninterrupted\r\npyramid form is one of their chief beauties.\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMAL STUDIES\r\n\r\nSCALE INSECTS\r\n\r\nSAN JOSE SCALE\r\n\r\nCertain districts in Ontario and especially those bordering on Lake Erie\r\nhave suffered from the ravages of this scale on apple, peach, pear, and\r\nother orchard trees. A hand lens should be used in studying these\r\ninsects, observations being carried on from May to September.\r\n\r\nCarefully examine the fruits and twigs of orchard trees for evidences of\r\nthe presence of the scale, and learn to identify it and to recognize the\r\ndamages resulting from its attacks.\r\n\r\nObserve the almost circular flat scale of a grayish colour and having a\r\nminute point projecting upward at its centre. The young insects which\r\nemerge from underneath these scales in the spring crawl around for a\r\ntime, then become stationary, and each one secretes a scale under which\r\nit matures. The mature males have two wings but the mature females are\r\nwingless. Note the withering of fruit and twigs due to the insects'\r\nattacks and the minute openings in the skin of the twig, made by the\r\ninsertion of the sucking mouth parts.\r\n\r\nDescribe to the pupils how the insect was transported from Japan to\r\nAmerica and how it is now spread on nursery stock. Give a brief account\r\nof its destructiveness in the orchards of Essex and Kent.\r\n\r\n     (Consult _Bulletin No. 153, Common Insects Affecting Fruit\r\n     Trees and Fungus Diseases Affecting Fruit Trees_. Bethune &\r\n     Jarvis, Department of Agriculture, Toronto, free.)\r\n\r\nOYSTER-SHELL BARK-LOUSE\r\n\r\nThis is very common throughout the Province on apple and pear trees.\r\nObserve the unhealthy appearance of the leaves of the infested trees,\r\nthe inferior quality of the fruit, and the gray scales shaped like tiny\r\noyster-shells.\r\n\r\nThe means of destroying these pests should be discussed. The Bulletins\r\nnamed above give detailed information in reference to spraying and\r\nfumigation.\r\n\r\nCUTWORMS\r\n\r\n     (Consult _Bulletin 52_, Department of Agriculture, Ottawa.)\r\n\r\nCutworms are the larvae of medium-sized brown moths that fly at night.\r\nThere are many species of cutworms, all of which are destructive to some\r\nforms of plants or grasses, grains, and vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe larvae are rather thick, naked, worm-like forms. They burrow into the\r\nground, but emerge at night to feed by cutting through the stems of\r\ntender plants or by feeding upon the leaves. For the most effective\r\nmethod of dealing with these refer to what is said on \"Combating Garden\r\nPests\", Form II.\r\n\r\nWhen a field is known to be infested with cutworms, it is a good plan to\r\nspread poisoned clover or cabbage leaves over the ground before the seed\r\nis planted.\r\n\r\nWHITE GRUBS\r\n\r\nWhite grubs are large, fat, white larvae of June beetles. These beetles\r\nare the well-known large, brown, clumsy beetles that blunder into the\r\nhouse at night in May or June and drop with a thud upon the floor.\r\nThree years are spent in the larval form, the grubs living underground\r\nand feeding on the roots of plants, especially the roots of grains and\r\ngrasses.\r\n\r\nSince they are found chiefly in fields recently ploughed from grass,\r\nthey may be held in check by rotation of crops and by fall ploughing,\r\nwhich exposes the larvae to the winter frosts.\r\n\r\nIn May or June, when the adults are feeding on the foliage of fruit and\r\nshade trees, spraying the trees with London purple is quite effective\r\nfor destroying the beetles before they have laid their eggs among the\r\nroots of the grass.\r\n\r\nHogs destroy many larvae by rooting in the soil to find them for food.\r\n\r\nCRAYFISH\r\n\r\nSearch for the crayfish in streams and ponds. Why is the crayfish hard\r\nto find? Hard to capture?\r\n\r\nObtain a living crayfish from a pond or stream and place it in a jar of\r\nwater or in an aquarium.\r\n\r\nThe crayfish should not be placed in an aquarium containing insects and\r\nsmall fish which are to be kept, as it is fierce and voracious.\r\n\r\nThe pupils should study the living animal, noting its habit of lurking\r\nunder stones; the sweeping of the water with the feelers; the backward\r\nmovement in swimming, produced by bending the tail sharply underneath\r\nthe body; the walking by means of four pairs of legs, the great claws\r\nbeing used to turn the animal; the use of the great claws in seizing\r\nprey and holding food near the mouth; the movements of the small\r\nappendages under the front part of the animal and the water currents\r\ncaused by these; the movements of the small appendages under the abdomen\r\nof the animal.\r\n\r\nFRESHWATER MUSSEL\r\n\r\nThe freshwater mussel--\"clam\" as it is usually called by\r\nschool-boys--may be found in almost any stream.\r\n\r\nPlace a mussel in the aquarium, and note the opening and closing of the\r\nvalves of the shell; the hinge connecting the valves; the foot\r\nprotruding from the shell; the movements by means of the foot; the\r\nmantle lobes lining the shell and visible at the open margins; the two\r\nsiphons at the rear of the animal--water currents may be observed\r\nentering the upper and emerging from the lower of these. Infer uses for\r\nthese currents. Touch the edge of the upper siphon and observe how\r\nquickly the shell is closed.\r\n\r\nCompare the mussel with the snail as to movements and shell.\r\n\r\nCompare also with the oyster and sea clam.\r\n\r\nExamine empty shells and notice the pearly layer of the shell, the\r\naction of the hinge, and the marks on the shell to which the muscles for\r\nclosing the shell were attached.\r\n\r\nState all the means of protection that you have discovered the animal to\r\npossess.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRD STUDY\r\n\r\n     (Consult _Bulletin 218. Birds of Ontario in Relation to\r\n     Agriculture_, Nash. Department of Agriculture, free.)\r\n\r\nIf the lessons in bird study which are prescribed for Forms I, II, and\r\nIII have been successful, the pupils of Form IV should have a fair\r\nacquaintance with the habits of the common birds.\r\n\r\nA very interesting exercise is to hold a trial upon those birds which\r\nare viewed with suspicion or which are openly condemned as objectionable\r\nneighbours. A pupil is appointed to act as judge and other pupils give\r\nevidence. The evidence must be based upon the pupil's personal\r\nobservations on the habits of the bird.\r\n\r\nThe following birds are named, and brief descriptions of their habits\r\nare given as suggestions for materials for bird trials:\r\n\r\nROBIN.--He steals small fruits, such as cherries, currants, etc. He is a\r\ncheerful, jolly neighbour, who sings sweetly. He eats great numbers of\r\ncutworms and white grubs.\r\n\r\nCROW.--He robs the nests of other birds, and steals chickens, corn, and\r\npotatoes. He helps the farmer by killing cutworms, white grubs,\r\ngrasshoppers, and other insects.\r\n\r\nWOODPECKER.--The members of this family are grievously persecuted\r\nbecause they are believed to injure orchard and shade trees by pecking\r\nholes in the bark from which to suck the sap. Careful observations tend\r\nto show that the trees are benefited rather than injured by this\r\ntreatment. Woodpeckers are undoubtedly beneficial as destroyers of\r\nwood-borers and other obnoxious insects.\r\n\r\nCROW-BLACKBIRD (bronzed grackle).--His habits are similar to those of\r\nthe crow.\r\n\r\nOWLS.--All the owls are held in ill repute because of the crimes of a\r\nfew members of the family. Very seldom does an owl steal a chicken;\r\ntheir food consists chiefly of mice, rats, squirrels, grasshoppers, and\r\nother field pests.\r\n\r\nHAWKS.--The hawks are unjustly persecuted for crimes of which they are\r\nseldom guilty. As a class they are beneficial, not injurious birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT ASPECTS OF NATURE STUDY\r\n\r\nThere is a knowledge of Nature which contributes to the earning of a\r\nliving. This is the _utilitarian_ aspect.\r\n\r\nThere is a knowledge of Nature which may be obtained in such a way as to\r\ndevelop the observing and reasoning powers and give a training in\r\nscientific method. This is the _disciplinary_ aspect.\r\n\r\nThere is a knowledge which leads the pupil to perceive the beautiful in\r\nNature, to enjoy it and so add to his happiness. This is the _aesthetic_\r\naspect.\r\n\r\nThere is a knowledge of Nature which, through the life history of plant\r\nand animal, throws light on the pupil's own life, gives him an insight\r\ninto all life in its unity, and leads him to look up reverently to the\r\nauthor of all life--through Nature up to Nature's God. This is the\r\n_spiritual_ aspect.\r\n\r\nEach of these aspects supplements, interprets, or enforces the others.\r\nHe who omits or neglects any of these perceives but a part of a complete\r\nwhole. Nature Study develops in the pupil a sympathetic attitude toward\r\nNature for the purpose of increasing the joy of living. It leads him to\r\nsee Nature through the eyes of the poet and the moralist as well as\r\nthrough those of the scientist.\r\n\r\nNature Study is concerned with plants, birds, insects, stones, clouds,\r\nbrooks, etc., but it is not botany, ornithology, entomology, geology,\r\nmeteorology, or geography. In this study, it is the spirit of inquiry\r\ndeveloped rather than the number of facts ascertained that is important.\r\nGradually it becomes more systematic as it advances until, in the high\r\nschool, it passes over into the science group of studies.\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS OF THESE ASPECTS\r\n\r\nThe simple observational lessons on The Robin, pages 96-7, form the\r\nbases for further study in more advanced classes. This bird as a\r\ndestroyer of worms, beetles, etc., is a valuable assistant to the farmer\r\nas, indeed, are practically all birds in this Province. Birds such as\r\nthe duck, goose, partridge, etc., are valuable as food, and laws are\r\nmade to protect them during certain seasons.\r\n\r\nThe training in inference which a pupil receives in studying the parts\r\nof a plant or an animal and the adaptation of these parts to function is\r\nvaluable. He studies the plant and the animal as living organisms with\r\nwork to do in the world, and learns how what they do and their manner of\r\ndoing it affect their form and structure.\r\n\r\nThe short, curved, and slightly hooked bill of the hen and her method of\r\nbreaking open a pea pod or splitting an object too large to swallow\r\nshows the bill to be a mallet, a wedge, or a pick as the case may be. A\r\nstudy of the bills of the duck, woodpecker, and hawk will reveal the\r\nmethod by which each gets his food and how the organ is adapted to its\r\npurpose. Similar studies of the feet and legs of birds will make the\r\nidea of adaptation increasingly clear.\r\n\r\nLiterature is rich with tributes to the songs of the birds. The thoughts\r\nand feelings aroused or suggested by these songs are the topics of much\r\nof the world's enduring poetry. Longfellow, in his \"Birds of\r\nKilling-worth\" (_Tales of a Wayside Inn_) sings exquisitely of the use\r\nand beauty and worth of birds. Shelley, in his \"Skylark\", describes in\r\nglowing verse \"the unbodied joy\" that \"singing still dost soar and\r\nsoaring ever singest\". Wordsworth hears the blithe new comer, the\r\nCuckoo, and rejoices\r\n\r\n    Though babbling only to the vale\r\n      Of sunshine and of flowers\r\n    Thou bringest unto me a tale\r\n      Of visionary hours.\r\n\r\nThe life story of a bird throws light on our own lives, puts us in\r\nsympathy with the lives of others, teaches kindness, teaches the duties\r\nand responsibilities of the higher to the lower, teaches respect for all\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nObserve the helpless bird in its nest, helpless as a baby. See the care\r\ngiven by the mother and father to keep it warm till its down and\r\nfeathers grow, to feed it till it is able to leave the nest. Watch the\r\nparents teaching it to fly by repeated short flights. Olive Thorn Miller\r\nin her _Bird Ways_ gives a delightful sketch of the father robin\r\nteaching a young robin where to look for worms and how to dig them up.\r\nWhen that task was accomplished, his father began to give him \"music\r\nlessons\", that is, practice in imitating the Robin's song. Thus, the\r\nyoung bird was equipped to make a living and to enjoy life. The social\r\nlife of birds, as they sing their matins, as they choose their mates, as\r\nthey gather in flocks preparatory to migration, furnish many\r\nopportunities for indirect teaching on many of life's problems.\r\n\r\nThe Ontario Readers contain many poems that may be used in connection\r\nwith the Nature Study lessons. To supplement the observational studies\r\nof birds, read from the Third Reader, \"The Robin's Song\", \"The\r\nRed-winged Blackbird\", \"The Sandpiper\", \"To the Cuckoo\", \"Bob White\",\r\n\"The Lark and the Rook\", \"The Poet's Song\".\r\n\r\nIn the Third Reader, the lessons on \"The Fountain\", \"The Brook\", \"The\r\nTide River\", and \"A Song of the Sea\" form a group that can be used in\r\nconnection with lessons in geography. \"A Song for April\", \"An Apple\r\nOrchard in the Spring\", \"The Gladness of Nature\", \"The Orchard\", \"A\r\nMidsummer Song\", \"Corn-fields\", \"The Corn Song\", \"The Death of the\r\nFlowers\", \"The Frost\", \"The Snow-storm\", make another group to accompany\r\na study of the seasons. A similar group may be selected from the Fourth\r\nReader.\r\n\r\nThe pupil who has made a study of a \"brook\" as a lesson in geography and\r\ndefined it as \"a small natural stream of water flowing from a spring or\r\nfountain\" will, if he studies the following lines from Tennyson's \"The\r\nBrook\" and perceives by careful observation the descriptive accuracy and\r\naptness of the words in italics, realize that the poet sees much that\r\nthe geographer has not included in his definition.\r\n\r\n    I _chatter_ over stony ways,\r\n      In little sharps and trebles,\r\n    I _bubble_ into eddying bays,\r\n      I _babble_ on the pebbles.\r\n\r\n           *     *     *\r\n\r\n    I _slip_, I _slide_, I _gloom_, I _glance_.\r\n      Among my skimming swallows;\r\n\r\n           *     *     *\r\n\r\n    I _murmur_ under moon and stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n           *     *     *\r\n\r\n\r\n    I _linger_ by my shingly bars.\r\n      I _loiter_ round my cresses.\r\n\r\nCorrelations such as these add greatly to the pupil's interest in this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nGiven a teacher with a love of out-of-door life, with observant eyes and\r\nears, and the spirit that sympathizes with children's curiosity and\r\nstimulates inquiry, Nature Study will be a joy and an inspiration to\r\npupils.",
