The farther I proceeded in my work the more I realised\r\nthat the floras of the Pacific islands are of most interest in their\r\nconnections, and that the problems affecting them are problems\r\nconcerning the whole plant-world. Deprived of the writings of Seemann,\r\nHillebrand, Drake del Castillo, and other botanists, several of whom\r\nhave lived and died in the midst of their studies of these floras, and\r\nwithout the aid of the works of Hemsley and Schimper, generalisers who\r\nhave mainly cleared the way for the systematic study of\r\nplant-distribution and plant-dispersal, it would not have been possible\r\nfor me to accomplish such an undertaking.\r\n\r\nMy interest in plant-dispersal dates back to 1884, when, whilst surgeon\r\nof H.M.S. _Lark_, in the Solomon Islands, I made some observations on\r\nthe stocking of a coral island with its plants, which were published in\r\nthe _Report on the Botany of the “Challenger” Expedition_. In 1888 I\r\nfollowed up the same line of investigation during a sojourn of three\r\nmonths on Keeling Atoll, and during a journey along the coasts of West\r\nJava. But realising that as yet I had barely touched the fringe of a\r\ngreat subject, and that several years of study would be required before\r\none could venture even to appreciate the nature of the problems involved\r\nand much less to weigh results, I took advantage of the circumstances of\r\nmy life to make, between the years 1890 and 1896, a prolonged\r\ninvestigation of the plants of the British flora, mainly from the\r\nstandpoint of dispersal by water. This involved the study of the\r\nseed-drift of ponds and rivers and of the plants supplying it, a study\r\nwhich brought me into close relation with aquatic and sub-aquatic\r\nplants. This line of investigation led me into contact with many other\r\naspects of plant-life; and as time went on my field of interest extended\r\nto the plants of dry stations and to the bird as an agent in\r\nplant-dispersal. Only a few of these results have been published, as in\r\nthe journals of the Linnean Society and of the Royal Physical Society of\r\nEdinburgh as well as in the pages of _Science Gossip_. They lie for the\r\nmost part still within my note-books, and fitly so, since I regarded\r\nsuch studies chiefly as a preparation for the investigation of the\r\ngeneral question of plant-dispersal.\r\n\r\nWhen again, in October, 1896, I found myself once more in the Pacific,\r\nthe subject was taken up again with zeal; but my larger experience had\r\nonly increased my diffidence, and the unknown looked so overwhelming\r\nthat I settled down for the next three years content with merely making\r\nexperiments and recording observations. Here again the main problem was\r\nattacked through the study of seed-buoyancy, and gradually it led me to\r\nthe systematic study of the mangroves and of the beach-plants, whilst my\r\ninland excursions brought me into familiarity with the plants of the\r\ninterior. My geological exploration of the island of Vanua Levu, in\r\nFiji, greatly assisted me by giving a method to my botanical examination\r\nof the island.\r\n\r\nWhilst working out my geological collections in England, in the years\r\n1900-1902, I devoted an hour or two daily to the elaboration of my\r\nbotanical notes and to a consideration of the problems concerned. During\r\na winter in Sicily I took up again the subject of the beach-plants; and\r\nafter the publication of the volume on the geology of Vanua Levu I was\r\nable to accomplish a plan, for years in my dreams, of visiting the\r\neastern shores of the Pacific. During a period of three months from\r\nDecember, 1903, to March, 1904, I examined the littoral flora of the\r\nwest side of South America at various localities between Southern Chile\r\nand Ecuador; and finally completed this investigation by comparing the\r\nshore-plants on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the isthmus of\r\nPanama. Returning to England with a fresh collection of data, I passed\r\nmany months in elaborating and arranging all my notes, waiting vainly\r\nfor a clue to guide me in framing a scheme by which I could bring the\r\nresults of many years of work into some connected form. At last I\r\ndecided once again to take the floating seed as my clue, and without any\r\nprearranged plan I allowed the work to evolve itself. Now that it is\r\nfinished, I can see some obvious defects; but if any other plan had been\r\nadopted I scarcely think that I should have been more successful in\r\npiecing together in a single argument materials resulting from so many\r\nyears of research and relating to so many aspects of plant-life.\r\n\r\nYet the final object of a naturalist would be but a sorry one, if his\r\naim were only to write a treatise and append his name to it. His\r\npersonal faith lies behind all his work; and no one can pursue a long\r\nline of study of the world around him without rising from his task with\r\nsome convictions gained and some convictions lost.\r\n\r\nAs far as the observation of Nature’s processes at present in operation\r\ncan guide us, the world presents itself to us only as a differentiating\r\nworld. We can perceive, it is true, a progressive arrangement of types\r\nof organisms from the lowest to the highest, and we can perceive a\r\ndevelopment of varieties of the several types; but the only process\r\nevident to our observation is that concerned with the production of\r\nvarieties of the type. Nature does not enlighten us as to the mode of\r\ndevelopment of the type itself. We can, for instance, detect in actual\r\noperation the process by which the different kinds of bats or the\r\ndifferent kinds of men have been developed; but there is no principle in\r\nNature evident to our senses that is concerned with type-creation.\r\nThough we can supply it by hypothesis, we cannot discover it in fact. On\r\nthe other hand, the evidence of differentiation is abundant on all sides\r\nof us, both in the organic and in the inorganic worlds. The history of\r\nthe globe has ever proceeded from the uniform to the complex; and in the\r\nclosing chapter of this book an endeavour is made to connect the\r\ndifferentiation of plant and bird with the differentiation of the\r\nconditions of existence on the earth. But this leaves no room for the\r\ndevelopment of new types of organisms; and so far as observation of the\r\nprocesses of Nature at present working around us can guide us, each type\r\nmight well be regarded as eternal. We can never hope to arrive at an\r\nexplanation of the progressive development of types by studying the\r\ndifferentiating process; and since the last is alone cognisable for us,\r\nevolution, as it is usually termed, becomes an article of our faith, and\r\nof faith only.\r\n\r\nIn illustration of this argument, let me take the case of the races of\r\nmen. We see mankind in our own day illustrating the law of\r\ndifferentiation all over the globe, as far as physical characters are\r\nconcerned. Just as the ornithologist would postulate a generalised type\r\nin tracing the origin of various allied groups of birds, so the\r\nanthropologist, guided by his observation of the changes now offered by\r\nman in different regions, would postulate a generalised original type as\r\nthe parent-stock of mankind. Observation of the processes of change now\r\nin operation by no means leads us to infer that such a generalised type\r\nwas an anthropoid ape, or even simian in character. In so doing we\r\nshould be forming a conclusion not warranted by the observation of\r\nexisting agencies of change, and we should be confusing the two distinct\r\nprocesses of evolution and differentiation, or rather of progressive and\r\ndivergent evolution, of which the last alone comes within our field of\r\ncognition. The study of variation can do no more than enable us to\r\nascertain the mode of development of different kinds, we will say, of\r\nbirds or of men. The origin of the type lies outside our observation.\r\n“Given the type, to explain its origin”: this is the problem we can\r\nnever solve, and Nature aids us nothing by the study of her ways. On the\r\nother hand, there is the subsidiary problem.... “Given a type, to\r\nexplain its varieties” ...; and here Nature’s processes are apparent to\r\nus in a thousand different shapes.\r\n\r\nIt might seem that the presumptive evidence connecting man in his origin\r\nwith the monkeys is so strong that, supposing his simian descent were\r\nregarded as a crime, a jury would without hesitation pronounce his\r\nguilt; but until some observer of the processes followed by Nature can\r\nbridge over the gap that divides man from the ape, until indeed he can\r\noffer a legitimate illustration of how it is accomplished in similar\r\ncases in our own day, the gap remains. Those who have read the recent\r\nwork of Prof. Metchnikoff on the Nature of Man will properly regard his\r\nchapter on the simian origin of man as a brilliant argument advanced by\r\na most competent authority. Yet he fails to complete his case by\r\nbridging over this gap, and can only appeal to the results of the now\r\nfamous researches of De Vries concerning the mutations of the evening\r\nprimrose (Œnothera). It is probable, he says, that man owes his origin\r\nto a similar phenomenon (English edition, p. 57). Several objections\r\ncould be raised against this illustration from the plant-world, the most\r\nimportant of them lying in the circumstance that these mutations could\r\nonly be urged as instances of the sudden development of new species of\r\nthe evening primrose type. They merely illustrate the process of\r\ndifferentiation from a given type, and by no means represent the process\r\nof progressive evolution from a simian to a man.\r\n\r\nHowever, look where we may—and this is the great lesson I have learned\r\nfrom my researches in the Pacific islands—Nature does not present to our\r\nobservation any process in operation by which a new type of organism is\r\nproduced. The processes involved lie hidden from our view. The channels\r\nby which impressions from the outside world reach us are comparatively\r\nfew; and although it seems likely that the future development of man\r\nwill be mainly concerned with the acquirement of additional\r\nsense-channels, no newly acquired sense will enable him to be at once an\r\nactor in and a spectator of the great drama presented in the organic\r\nworld. That a creature should be able to get at the back of its own\r\nexistence, or, in other words, to penetrate the secret of its own\r\ncreation, is unthinkable. Outside the limited field of observation that\r\nimmediately surrounds us extends the region where reason alone can guide\r\nus, and beyond lies the realm where reason fails and faith begins.\r\n\r\n                                                            H.

A broad and comprehensive grasp of\r\nplant-distribution, such as is only acquired by a life-time of research\r\naided by travel and the handling of large collections, is a necessary\r\nfoundation for the study; yet in the nature of things such\r\nqualifications can be possessed by but a few. To direct an inquiry in\r\nthe opposite direction, and endeavour to attack the problem of\r\ncontinental floras through the insular floras would result merely in the\r\ninvestigation of a few of the many questions connected with\r\nplant-distribution.\r\n\r\nThe panoramic sketch of the surveyor on the mountain-top aids him in a\r\nthousand ways when after months of tedious labour he plots the details\r\nin his chart. Without such a panoramic view of the plant-world in his\r\nmind’s eye, an observer like myself can only look for guidance to the\r\nwritings of those who have generalised on the foundations of a far\r\nbroader experience, such as those of Bentham, De Candolle, Gray, Hooker,\r\nSchimper, and others.\r\n\r\nIt would be quite possible for a botanist possessing a profound general\r\nacquaintance with the plant-world to dispense altogether with actual\r\nobservation and experiment on modes of dispersal. It would be quite\r\npossible for him to arrive at conclusions, which, even if they did not\r\nalways come into line with results of observation and experiment, we\r\nshould be compelled to prefer. It is only from his more elevated\r\nposition that a general can follow the course of a battle; whilst the\r\nprivate with his experience confined to a limited area of the field of\r\nconflict may form the most erroneous ideas of the progress of the fight.\r\nSo it is with observers whose employment it is to struggle with the\r\ndetails and secondary principles of plant-distribution, and so it is\r\nwith the generaliser who has already roughly mapped out the principal\r\nfeatures of the main problem.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Bentham in 1869, remarking on the paucity of species common to\r\ntropical Asia and America, characterised them either as plants wholly or\r\npartially maritime and spread by the currents, or as weeds dispersed by\r\ncultivation over the warm regions of the globe, he mentioned amongst the\r\nplants in the former category, Gyrocarpus jacquini. This tree presents\r\none of the mysteries connected with the Pacific islands; and I don’t\r\nimagine that this eminent botanist could have known anything except\r\ninferentially as regards the mode of dispersal of its fruits. Yet\r\nexperiment shows how well founded the inference was, whilst behind it\r\nlay a life-time of botanical research.\r\n\r\nThe author thus approaches the subject of the floras of the Pacific\r\nislands rather as a plotter of detail than as a delineator of great\r\ndesigns. However much we may study the means of dispersal, we have\r\nbehind them the great facts of distribution, serving like the main\r\nstations of a trigonometrical survey, and with these we have to make our\r\nlesser facts and observations square. One is conscious all the time that\r\nmuch of what seems new in one’s researches has already been foreseen by\r\nthe generaliser, and that one can do little else than assist in\r\nconfirming some of his results. This is all that I can lay claim to in\r\nthis work.\r\n\r\nThe floras of the islands and coasts of the tropical Pacific are here\r\nregarded entirely from the standpoint of plant-dispersal. The fruits and\r\nseeds rather than the flowers have been the subject of my\r\ninvestigations; and although there is much to please the eye in the\r\nflora of a Pacific island, it was always with a sense of disappointment\r\nthat I turned away from some pretty flowering plant that failed to\r\npresent me with its seed. Amongst the wonders of the plant-world rank\r\nthe Tree Lobelias of the Hawaiian Islands; yet their greatest charm to\r\nme lay not so much in their giant-flowers and their arborescent habit as\r\nin the mystery surrounding the home of their birth and their mode of\r\narrival in these islands. When I first stood under the shade of the\r\nlofty Dammara vitiensis, the Kauri Pine of Fiji, all my interest lay in\r\nits cones lying on the ground; and I remember how eagerly I handled my\r\nfirst specimen, and how anxiously I watched its behaviour when\r\nexperimenting on its capacity for different modes of transport. When a\r\nstrange plant presented itself on a beach, my first care was to\r\nascertain the fitness of its fruits or seeds for transport by the\r\ncurrents; and all inland plants with fruits likely to attract\r\nfrugivorous birds were at once invested with a special interest for me.\r\n\r\nThe mangrove swamps were always great places of interest, and months of\r\nmy sojourn in the Pacific must have been passed in exploring their\r\ncreeks and in examining their vegetation. Botanists usually avoid these\r\nregions; but the observation of the germination of the Rhizophora fruits\r\non the trees and the inquiries connected with their methods of\r\ndistribution over the oceans were pursuits so engrossing that I ignored\r\nthe numerous discomforts connected with the exploration of these gloomy\r\nregions. The magnificent mangrove forests of the Ecuador coast of the\r\nPacific will live longest in my memory, though the risks were\r\nconsiderably greater and the discomfort of existence extreme. But the\r\nmangrove swamps present us with glimpses into the conditions of plant\r\nlife during the warmer epochs of the earth’s history, when perhaps the\r\nseed-stage was largely dispensed with, whilst an atmosphere, laden with\r\nmoisture and screening off much of the sun’s light, enveloped most of\r\nthe circumference of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe plant world viewed only from the standpoint of dispersal may lack\r\nmuch that is pleasing to the eye, though it abounds with small and great\r\nproblems fascinating to the reason. Matters of great moment are here\r\ninvolved, and in the case of the Pacific islands they concern not only\r\nthe source of the oceanic floras, but the story of the islands\r\nthemselves; whilst behind these there rise up questions of yet deeper\r\nimport, questions that are bound up with the beginnings of genera and\r\nspecies, and with other mysteries of life on the earth. The distribution\r\nof plants presents something more than a problem of means of dispersal,\r\nor a problem of station, or a problem of plant migration connected with\r\nclimatic changes. It is something a great deal more than all three,\r\nsince it is indissolubly connected with a past, of which unfortunately\r\nwe know very little. Let us take it to be a question of means of\r\ndispersal, and then in imagination transporting ourselves to the\r\nScandinavian coast, let us gather up the stranded West Indian beans of\r\nCæsalpinia, Mucuna, and Entada, that have been drifted there for ages by\r\nthe Gulf Stream, and lie in some cases semifossilised in the adjacent\r\npeat-bog. Was ever dispersal so utterly purposeless as this? Yet here\r\nlies a principle of plant-dispersal that is fundamental. We see it in\r\nthe thistle-seed floating seaward in the wind. Nature never intended its\r\npappus for such an end. It was formed for quite another purpose, yet it\r\naids largely the dispersion of the plant. What can be more significant\r\nthan that?\r\n\r\nOr let us take it to be a matter of station. Given time and the\r\nrecurrence of the same conditions, with others I once imagined that we\r\ncould explain most things in plant-distribution, whether of plants at\r\nthe coast or of plants inland, whether of plants of the alpine peaks or\r\nof plants of the plains, or of plants of the river or of the pond. Time,\r\nit was held, had long since discounted the means of dispersal, and\r\ndistribution became merely an affair of station. But the supplanting of\r\nmany indigenous species of a flora by introduced species is a common\r\nstory in the plant-world; and such a view needs no further discussion\r\nhere. Nor is distribution only concerned with plant-migration. Any\r\ntheory of the origin of alpine floras on tropical mountains will have to\r\nexplain the presence of the temperate genera, Geranium and Sanicula, not\r\nalone on the summits of the mountains of Equatorial Africa and\r\nMadagascar, but on the uplands of Hawaii in mid-Pacific, where also are\r\nfound Ranunculus, Vaccinium, Fragaria chilensis (the Chilian\r\nstrawberry), and Drosera longifolia.\r\n\r\nTaking genera of different stations each in their turn, and following up\r\nthe clues thus afforded, it would be possible to find support for all\r\nthe reputable views relating to plant-distribution. The wide range of\r\naquatic plants under conditions that completely change the character of\r\nthe terrestrial vegetation, such, for instance, as Myriophyllum and\r\nCeratophyllum, might be plausibly attributed to the relative uniformity\r\nof the conditions of aquatic life both in time as well as space. The\r\noccurrence of Vaccinium on mountain-tops over most of the world, even on\r\nthe highlands of Samoa, Tahiti, and Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean, would\r\nbe rightly regarded as evidence of active dispersal of the seeds through\r\nthe agency of birds from one mountain-summit to another, whether in\r\nmid-ocean or in the centre of a continent. The prevalence of the same\r\nbeach-plants over most of the globe in the same climatic zones would\r\npoint unmistakably to the predominant agency of currents. But with many\r\nplant-genera, some of which range the world, whilst others again may be\r\nrestricted to a single group of islands in the Pacific, there is often\r\nno question either of means of dispersal, or of station, or of\r\nplant-migration, and problems of a very different nature are opened up.\r\n\r\nWhen we leave the beach and the mountain-top, the river and the pond,\r\nall the troubles of distribution begin; and since but a small proportion\r\nof plants in a typical flora belong to these stations, it follows that\r\ndifficulties will dog our steps with the large majority of the plants.\r\nThe agencies of dispersal now working around us, the current, the wind,\r\nthe insect, the bird, and the bat, will explain many of the features of\r\nlittoral and alpine floras and of the vegetation of ponds and rivers.\r\nHere we have in so many cases wide-ranging genera with the means of\r\ndispersal ready to hand. We can connect the wide range of Vaccinium with\r\nthe wide range of birds of the grouse and other families that feed on\r\nthe berries. We can associate the great areas of aquatic or sub-aquatic\r\ngenera, like Potamogeton and Sparganium, with the migratory habits of\r\nthe ducks in the stomachs of which we find their seeds. We can connect\r\nthe great ranges of beach plants like Ipomœa pes capræ in the tropics,\r\nand Convolvulus soldanella in the temperate regions with the currents,\r\nand the almost cosmopolitan range of many ferns and lycopods with the\r\nwinds and other agencies.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, we enter the forests we find genera that are often much\r\nmore restricted in their areas, and species that are yet more limited in\r\ntheir range. There is very little dispersal going on here. The birds are\r\nstrange. Their distribution is usually very local. They look lazily down\r\nat us from the branches, as they disgorge the seeds and stones of the\r\nfruits they have eaten, which cover the ground around. We can almost\r\nfancy that they say:—“Our work is done. We rest from the toil of our\r\nancestors. They carried seeds to far-distant Hawaii, Tahiti, and Savaii.\r\nOur work is done.” And as we walk through those noiseless forests, where\r\nthe machinery of species-making is ever in silent motion, we become\r\naware that we are treading one of Nature’s great workshops for the\r\nmanufacture of species and genera. Outside the forest all is bustle and\r\nhurry. We are in the streets, or rather in the distributing areas of the\r\nplant-world. We hear the noise of the breaker, the roar of the gale, the\r\ncry of the sea-gull, the flapping of a myriad pairs of wings of some\r\nmigrating host overhead, and we know that the current, the wind, and the\r\nbird are actively at work; but their operations are confined mainly to\r\nthe beach, the mountain-top, the river, and the pond.\r\n\r\nLet us take a well-wooded Pacific island several thousand feet in\r\nheight. We find on its beaches the same littoral plants that we have\r\nseen before on the tropical shores of Malaya, of Asia, of Africa, and of\r\nAmerica. We find in its ponds and rivers the same species of\r\nwater-plants, such as Ceratophyllum demersum, Ruppia maritima, and Naias\r\nmarina, that are familiar to us in the cool and tepid waters of much of\r\nthe globe. On its level summit, if it remains within the clouds we find\r\nin the boggy ground, where Sphagnum thrives, genera that are represented\r\nin Fuegia, New Zealand, and the Antarctic islands, such as Acæna,\r\nLagenophora, and Astelia, and the world-ranging Drosera longifolia. In\r\nother elevated localities we find Ranunculus, Geranium, Sanicula,\r\nArtemisia, Vaccinium, and Plantago, chiefly genera of the temperate\r\nregions of the northern hemisphere; whilst there are also found Gunnera,\r\nNertera, and Uncinia, all hailing from the south and belonging to the\r\nAntarctic flora characterising all the land-area around the globe in the\r\nlatitude of New Zealand and Fuegia. The Hawaiian species of Nertera and\r\nof Uncinia occur also in New Zealand, and the first-named is found also\r\nin Tristan da Cunha and in South America. In the Hawaiian uplands there\r\nis also to be seen Deyeuxia, a genus of grasses found in the Tibetan\r\nhighlands and in the Bolivian Andes at elevations of 16,000 to 19,000\r\nfeet; and the same species that exists in Australia may be found in the\r\nmountains of Hawaii. Here also, both in Hawaii and Tahiti, occurs Luzula\r\ncampestris.\r\n\r\nIn making the foregoing remarks on the alpine plants of a Pacific\r\nisland, I have had Hawaii in my mind, but we find the elements of a\r\nsimilar widely-distributed mountain-flora in the less lofty peaks of\r\nTahiti and Samoa, and traces even in Fiji, where the mountains, however,\r\nhave only a moderate elevation. But the point I wish to lay stress on is\r\nthe cosmopolitan yet temperate character of the mountain-flora of an\r\nisland lying in the midst of the tropical Pacific. As he shifts his\r\nstation on this mountain-summit, the observer might at different times\r\nimagine himself in the Sierra Nevada of California, on a Mexican\r\ntableland, on a peak of the Andes, or in the lowlands of Fuegia. Other\r\nplants that I have not mentioned, such as Coprosma, would bring back to\r\nhim New Zealand. He might even be on a mountain-top in Central Africa,\r\nor on a Madagascar plateau; whilst in the boggy region of an elevated\r\nHawaiian tableland he would meet with not only the physical conditions,\r\nbut also several of the plants found on the higher levels of Tristan da\r\nCunha.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, to be noted that although these mountain-tops in the\r\nmid-Pacific have been stocked with genera from the four quarters of the\r\ncompass, the species as a rule are restricted to that particular\r\narchipelago. Whilst the beach and the river in most cases possess plants\r\nthat have very wide ranges over the earth, a good proportion of the\r\nspecies on the mountain-summit are not found elsewhere. This implies a\r\npartial suspension of the means of dispersal on the mountain-top, whilst\r\nthe currents and waterfowl are still actively distributing the seeds of\r\nthe littoral tree and of the aquatic plant. We here get a foreshadowing\r\nof another great principle, or of another line along which Nature has\r\nworked in stocking these islands of the Pacific with their plants, a\r\nsubject concerning which much will be said in later pages.\r\n\r\nHitherto, we have dealt only with a small proportion of the flora, and\r\nwith but a small portion of the area of the island. We have yet to deal\r\nwith the intermediate region between the sea-border and the summit of\r\nthe island, or, in other words, with the forested mountain slopes. This\r\nis the home of many of the peculiar species and peculiar genera, both of\r\nplants and birds; and it is with this zone that we shall be mainly\r\nconcerned when we come to contrast the floras of the several\r\narchipelagoes of the tropical Pacific. Here the agencies of dispersal\r\nhave, to a large extent, ceased to act; and the question will arise as\r\nto the connection between the endemic character of the plants and the\r\nendemic character of the birds. We shall have to ask why this island,\r\nafter receiving so many plants, ceased to be centres of dispersal to\r\nother regions. It is possible that these seeds or fruits have lost their\r\ncapacity for dispersal; but only a few instances of this change present\r\nthemselves. Rather it may be supposed that the birds that originally\r\nbrought the seeds to the island came to stay; and this at once suggests\r\nanother query as to the cause of the change of habit. I am alluding here\r\nnot to the plants with minute seeds, such as Sagina and Orchis, which\r\nMr. Wallace, in his _Darwinism_, regards as capable of being transported\r\nby strong winds over a thousand miles of sea; but to those numerous\r\nplants found in the Fijian, Tahitian, and Hawaiian forests, where the\r\nseeds and “stones” are large and heavy, measuring often as much as a\r\nquarter of an inch (6 mm.), and sometimes nearly an inch (25 mm.) in\r\nsize. The reader will be surprised to learn how little “size” has\r\ndetermined the distribution of seeds and fruits in the Pacific. He will\r\nhave to appeal to the habits of pebble-swallowing of the Dodo, the\r\nSolitaire, the Goura pigeon, the Nicobar pigeon, &c., if he desires to\r\nfind a parallel in the habits of birds.\r\n\r\nIt is here assumed that the reader is already acquainted with the\r\nprinciples involved in a discussion of island-floras, principles clearly\r\nlaid down in the writings of Hooker, Wallace, Hemsley, and others. As a\r\ngeneral rule in an island or in a group of islands where there are a\r\nlarge number of plants not found elsewhere, there is also a large\r\nendemic element in the avifauna, and where none of the plants are\r\npeculiar, endemic birds are either few or wanting. As an example of the\r\nfirst we may mention Hawaii, and Iceland affords an instance of the\r\nsecond. But there is no hard and fast rule connecting the endemic\r\ncharacter of the plants and birds of an island with its distance from\r\nother regions. Even the small group of Fernando Noronha, lying only some\r\n200 miles off the coast of Brazil, possesses its peculiar birds and its\r\npeculiar plants; and we can there witness the singular spectacle, as\r\ndescribed by Mr. Ridley, of an endemic bird, a frugivorous dove, engaged\r\nin scattering the seeds of endemic plants over the little group. This is\r\nthe only fruit-eating bird in the islands, remarks the same botanist in\r\nthe _Journal of the Linnean Society_ (vol. 27, 1891); and “when one sees\r\nthe number of endemic species with edible fruits, one is tempted to\r\nwonder if it were possible that they were all introduced by this single\r\nspecies of dove, or whether other frugivorous birds may not at times\r\nhave wandered to these shores.” This inter-island dispersal in a\r\nparticular group of peculiar plants by peculiar birds is a common\r\nspectacle in the Pacific. The contrast between the large number of\r\nplant-genera possessing fruits that would be dispersed by frugivorous\r\nbirds and the poverty of fruit-eating birds in the avifauna is well\r\ndisplayed in Hawaii.\r\n\r\nThe island of St. Helena would seem to offer an exception to the rule\r\nthat endemic birds and endemic plants go together, since, though its\r\nflora possesses a very large endemic element, there are scarcely any\r\nendemic or even indigenous birds recorded from the island. We can never\r\nknow, however, how much of the original fauna disappeared with the\r\ndestruction of the forests. It would nevertheless appear that but few of\r\nthe genera possessing peculiar species of plants were adapted for\r\ndispersal by frugivorous birds. The lesson to be learned from this\r\nisland concerns the Compositæ, often arboreous, that constitute the\r\nprincipal feature of its flora. St. Helena retains almost more than any\r\nother island evidence of the age of Compositæ which has left its impress\r\non many insular floras; and when we discuss the original modes of\r\ndispersal of the endemic Hawaiian genera of the same order we shall look\r\nto the flora of this Atlantic island for assistance in the matter. To\r\nthe age of Compositæ belong the beginnings of several insular floras.\r\n\r\nTo return to the main line of our argument, it would seem that in a\r\nPacific island there is a constant relation between free means of\r\ndispersal and the preservation of specific characters. The ocean-current\r\nand the aquatic bird are in our own time actively engaged in dispersing\r\nthe seeds of shore-plants and water-plants, and we see the same species\r\nranging over the world. On the other hand on the mountain-top the\r\nagencies of dispersal are beginning to fail, and as a result many a\r\nmountain has some of its species restricted to its higher regions. In\r\nthe forest zone there has been a more or less complete suspension of the\r\nactivity of the dispersing agencies, and new genera are formed whilst\r\npeculiar species abound. Free means of communication with other regions\r\nrestrains but does not arrest the differentiating process that is ever\r\nin progress throughout the organic world. Isolation within certain\r\nlimits gives it play.\r\n\r\nIt is in this connection interesting to reflect that during the\r\ndifferentiation of the inland flora the littoral plants have lagged\r\nbehind or have remained relatively unchanged. The currents have been\r\nworking without a break throughout the ages; and the cosmopolitan\r\nIpomœa, that now creeps over the sand of the beach, or the wide-ranging\r\nRhizophora, that forms the mangroves of the coast-swamp, must have\r\nwitnessed the arrival of the ancestors of several of the endemic inland\r\ngenera. The swamp-plants of the littoral flora are probably older,\r\nhowever, than the beach-plants which have been recruited from time to\r\ntime in one region or another of the tropics from the inland flora. Yet\r\nas a body the littoral plants have lagged far behind the inland flora.\r\nWe might thus expect that in a Pacific island, excluding the\r\nwind-distributed plants, such as the ferns and the lycopods, the most\r\nancient types of the plants would be found at the coast, the most modern\r\nin the forests, whilst the plants of the mountain-summit would represent\r\nan intermediate age.\r\n\r\nBut true as this may be, the composition of a strand-flora is a very\r\ncomplex one. Although, as Prof. Schimper remarks, the mangrove formation\r\nis more isolated than the beach formation, and affords evidence of a\r\nmuch earlier separation, the beach-plants as a body are anything but\r\nhomogeneous in their character. Their physiognomy varies to some extent\r\nwith the alteration in the characters of the inland flora, changes to\r\nwhich the mangrove formation makes a very slow response. Yet amongst the\r\nplants of the beach we find strangely assorted forms that are as ancient\r\ndenizens of the coast as the mangroves themselves. Take, for instance,\r\nSalsola Kali, that thrives alike on a beach in Chile, on the sea-shore\r\nin Devonshire, and in the salt-marshes of the interior of Tibet. Then,\r\nagain, there is a type of littoral plant, of which Armeria vulgaris and\r\nPlantago maritima may be taken as examples, which is equally at home on\r\nthe beach and on the tops of inland mountains. We might in a sense apply\r\nthe wrecker’s motto,\r\n\r\n                “What the sea sends and the land lends,”\r\n\r\nto the history of a littoral flora. Yet on the other hand the inland\r\nflora in its turn receives a few recruits from the littoral flora; and\r\nit is the relation between the inland and coast species of the same\r\ngenus that offers one of the most fascinating studies in the botany of\r\nthe Pacific Islands.\r\n\r\nThis introductory chapter may be concluded with a few remarks on what\r\nmay be termed “the ethics of plant-dispersal.” Not that this is in any\r\nway a suitable phrase, but it best expresses my sense of the lack of\r\npropriety in some things connected with this subject. It is odd, for\r\ninstance, that we speak of the dispersal of plants and animals in the\r\nsame breath, as if the process was in both cases identical. Seeing that\r\nfrom this point of view we judge a plant only by its seeds and fruits,\r\nit is apparent that we are following quite a different method than that\r\nwhich we employ in the study of the dispersal of animals. Whilst the\r\nzoologist classifies the units of dispersal, the botanist does nothing\r\nof the kind; and the two systems of classification are at the outset\r\nfundamentally distinct. The student of plant-dispersal thus often finds\r\nhimself placed in an awkward dilemma. For him a family is a collection\r\nof allied genera having similar seeds or fruits and fitted often for the\r\nsame mode of dispersal. A family like Sterculiaceæ, possessing such a\r\nvariety of seeds and fruits suitable for very different modes of\r\ndispersal, is from his standpoint a collection of dissimilar units.\r\nGenera like Commersonia, Waltheria, Kleinhovia, Sterculia, and\r\nHeritiera, that he so often meets with in the Pacific Islands, have in\r\nthese respects frequently very little in common; and yet one of the\r\nearliest determining influences in plant-life must have lain in the\r\ncapacity for dispersal.\r\n\r\nYet chance seems to reign in the processes of plant-dispersal ever going\r\non around us. In the floating seed, in the achene with its light pappus\r\nblown before the gale, in the prickly mericarp entangled in the plumage\r\nof a bird, in the “stone” of the drupe disgorged or ejected by the\r\npigeon, in the small grain that becomes adhesive in the rain, in the\r\ntiny rush-seed enclosed in the dried pond-mud on the legs of some\r\nmigratory bird, in all these we see the agencies of dispersal making use\r\nof qualities and of structures that were developed in quite another\r\nconnection and for quite another purpose. That such characters have been\r\nso to speak appropriated by these agencies is a pure accident in a\r\nplant’s life-history. If the evolutionary force had been in operation\r\nhere, it would have selected some common ground to work on. There would\r\nhave been some uniformity in its methods, whereas the modes of dispersal\r\nare infinite. The qualities and characters that happen to be connected\r\nwith dispersal belong to a plant’s development in a particular\r\nenvironment. They can never have been adapted to another set of\r\nconditions that lie quite outside that environment. There is a relation\r\nof a kind between the specific weight of wood and the density of water,\r\nand this, in a sense, sums up the connection between a seed and its\r\ndistributing agencies.\r\n\r\nEvolution has never concerned itself directly with means of dispersal.\r\nEvolution and Adaptation represent the dual forces that rule the organic\r\nworld, the first an intruding force, the last a passive power\r\nrepresenting the laws governing the inorganic world. To these laws the\r\nintruding power has often been compelled to bend, and it has had to pay\r\nits price, and sometimes it has succumbed, and sometimes it has turned\r\nits defeat into a victory. Nature, so watchful over the young plant, as\r\nrepresented by the seed, is finally compelled to let it go, and\r\ndispersal begins where evolution ends, or rather when the evolutionary\r\npower fails. The seed-stage itself is the price of adaptation. The death\r\nof the individual may also be regarded from the same standpoint. It\r\nrepresents a defeat of the evolutionary force, which, however, has been\r\nretrieved by the gift of reproductive power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n         THE FLORAS OF THE PACIFIC ISLANDS FROM THE STANDPOINT\r\n                        OF DISPERSAL BY CURRENTS\r\n\r\nThe initial experiment.—The proportion of littoral plants.—The two great\r\n  principles of buoyancy.—The investigations of Professor Schimper.—The\r\n  investigations of the author.—The great sorting process of the\r\n  ages.—Preliminary results of the inquiry into the buoyancy of seeds\r\n  and fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the previous introductory chapter some of the numerous questions\r\naffecting insular floras were briefly referred to. I will now ask my\r\nreader, if he has had the patience to read it, to consign that chapter\r\nfor the time at least into oblivion, and to proceed with me to our\r\nPacific island with the intention of investigating its flora from the\r\nstandpoint of dispersal. We will together take up the subject _de novo_,\r\nafter banishing from our minds all preconceptions that we may have\r\npossessed.\r\n\r\nAfter having been over the island gathering specimens of all the seeds\r\nand fruits, we return to our abode on the beach. But we are puzzled\r\nwhere to begin. The problem presents itself as a tangled skein, and our\r\ndifficulty is to find an “end” that we can follow along with some\r\nchances of success. In our trouble we look around us; and at that moment\r\nwe see a number of floating seeds and fruits carried by the current past\r\nthe beach. This presents us with a clue and our investigation begins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  OCEANIA\r\n  John Bartholomew & Co., Edin^r.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe place all our seeds and fruits in a bucket of sea-water and notice\r\nthat many of them sink at once. In a few days we look again and observe\r\nthat many more are at the bottom of the bucket, only a small percentage\r\nremaining afloat. We then remark to our surprise that nearly all of the\r\nfloating seeds and fruits belong to coast plants, those of the inland\r\nplants, which indeed make up the great bulk of the flora, having, as a\r\nrule, little or no buoyancy. After a lapse of weeks and months the seeds\r\nand fruits of the coast plants are found to be still afloat. In the\r\nresults of this experiment we see the work of the ages. There has been,\r\nin fact, a great sorting process, during which Nature has “located” the\r\nplants with buoyant seeds or seed-vessels at the sea-coast, placing the\r\nothers inland. This is the clue that we shall follow up during many\r\nchapters of this book; and having in this manner introduced the reader\r\nto the subject, I will now refer to the general results of my\r\ninvestigations in this direction in the Pacific Islands.\r\n\r\nIn Fiji there are about eighty littoral plants out of a total of at\r\nleast 900 species of indigenous flowering plants, that is to say about\r\nnine or ten per cent. (Note 1), the littoral grasses and the sedges\r\nbeing with one or two exceptions excluded. These shore plants belong to\r\nthe sandy beach and to the coast swamp, and most of them are distributed\r\nover the tropical shores of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, whilst not a\r\nfew occur on the coasts of tropical America. They form the\r\ncharacteristic plants of the coral atoll, and many of them have long\r\nbeen known to be dispersed by the currents. From the list given in Note\r\n2 it will be seen that these eighty species belong to about seventy\r\ngenera. Nearly all of them (95 per cent.) possess seeds or seed-vessels\r\nthat float at first in sea-water; whilst three-fourths of them (75 per\r\ncent.) will float unharmed for two months and usually much more, and\r\nseveral of them will be found afloat after a year or more, being still\r\ncapable of reproducing the plant (Note 3).\r\n\r\nThe prevalence in the Fijian strand-flora of Leguminosæ, which are\r\nincluded in my list under the divisions Papilionaceæ, Cæsalpinieæ, and\r\nMimoseæ, is very significant. They make up about 29 per cent. of the\r\ntotal. Excluding weeds and a few other introduced plants, there are some\r\nfifty species known from the Fijian Islands, and of these almost half\r\nbelong to the littoral flora, which as we have seen constitutes only a\r\nfraction (one-tenth) of the whole flora. If we regard the genera, we\r\nfind that out of some thirty Leguminous genera twenty are littoral and\r\nin most cases exclusively so. This conspicuous feature in the\r\nconstitution of the strand-flora is of prime importance as concerns the\r\nquestion of adaptation to dispersal by currents, since nearly all the\r\nLeguminosæ with buoyant seeds offer themselves as defiant exceptions to\r\nany such law.\r\n\r\nI will now contrast the Fijian inland flora with that of the coast from\r\nthe point of view of the buoyancy of the seed or fruit, according as it\r\npresented itself for possible dispersal by currents. Rather over a\r\nhundred plants were experimented upon (Note 4). After excluding some\r\nintroduced plants there remain some ninety species belonging to about\r\nsixty genera, and of these quite 75 per cent. sank at once or in a few\r\ndays. I may add that all kinds of fruits are here represented, the\r\ncapsule, the achene, the coccus, the berry, the drupe, &c. Of the\r\nbuoyant residue few possess seeds or fruits that will float uninjured\r\nfor any length of time. Not many gave indications directly in opposition\r\nto the principle that whilst the seeds or fruits of shore-plants\r\ngenerally float, those of inland plants usually sink, since as pointed\r\nout in Note 5 most of the difficulties are removed during the subsequent\r\ndevelopments of the principle discussed in the later pages of this work\r\nor are to be explained on other grounds stated in the note.\r\n\r\nWe pass now from Fiji as typical in its flora of the Western Pacific to\r\nTahiti as representing in its flora the more strictly oceanic groups of\r\nEastern Polynesia. In the Tahitian region, which is taken as including\r\nin a general sense the Society Islands, the Marquesas, and the Paumotus,\r\nthere are only between 50 and 60 littoral plants, excluding the\r\noccasional additions from the inland flora. As indicated by the letter T\r\npreceding the species in the list of Fijian shore plants, nearly all are\r\nto be found in Fiji, and the few not yet recorded from that group, which\r\nI have referred to in the remarks following the list, will probably be\r\nfound there by some subsequent investigator. In Tahiti also between 75\r\nand 80 per cent. of the strand plants have seeds or seedvessels that\r\nfloat for months; and here also Leguminosæ predominate, forming about 30\r\nper cent. of the total. A conspicuous negative feature in the Tahitian\r\nstrand-flora is concerned with the absence of the mangroves and their\r\nnumerous associated plants, which together form the mangrove formation\r\nin Fiji. This remarkable character in the distribution of shore plants\r\nin the Pacific is discussed in Chapter VI.\r\n\r\nNot having visited Tahiti, I can only deal inferentially with the inland\r\nplants, as in the case of the strand-flora. Here also the plants are in\r\nthe mass Fijian in a generic and often in a specific sense, and there is\r\nno reason to believe that the principle involving the non-buoyancy of\r\nthe seeds or fruits of inland plants does not as a rule apply to Tahiti\r\nas well as to Fiji.\r\n\r\nThe Hawaiian Islands, standing alone in the North Pacific, form a floral\r\nregion in themselves, a region that is the equivalent not of one group\r\nin the South Pacific, such as that of Fiji or of Tahiti, but of the\r\nwhole area comprising all the groups extending from Fiji to the Paumotu\r\nArchipelago. Lying as it does mainly outside the zone of influence of\r\nthe regular currents that would bring the seeds of tropical plants to\r\nits shores, Hawaii possesses a strand-flora that is meagre in the\r\nextreme. Not only does it lack the mangrove formation so characteristic\r\nof Fiji, but it lacks also many of the plants of the beach formation\r\nthat are found both in Fiji and in Tahiti, plants that give a peculiar\r\nbeauty to the reef-girt beaches all over the South Pacific. Its poverty\r\nis sufficiently indicated in the number of its species, thirty in all,\r\nbarely more than half of the number found in Tahiti, and not much over a\r\nthird of those occurring in Fiji. Though coral reefs with their\r\naccompanying beaches of calcareous sand are relatively scanty, the\r\ncharacteristic littoral plants have not been numerous enough to hold\r\ntheir own against intruders from the inland flora, and endemic species\r\nhave taken a permanent place amongst the strand plants. The Hawaiian\r\nstrand-flora has thus quite a facies of its own, and it will be found\r\ndiscussed in Chapter VII., whilst a list of the plants is given in Note\r\n28. It will thus not be a matter for surprise that the littoral flora of\r\nHawaii follows the principle of buoyancy only in a modified degree. It\r\nis true that about two-thirds of the species of the present beach flora\r\npossess seeds or seed-vessels that float for months; but since there are\r\nreasons for believing that several of them are of aboriginal\r\nintroduction, this proportion is reduced to a third. In the list of the\r\nFijian shore plants given in Note 2, those occurring also in Hawaii are\r\npreceded by H.\r\n\r\nWhen we look to the Hawaiian inland flora for indications respecting the\r\nprinciple of the non-buoyancy of the seeds or seed-vessels of inland\r\nplants, we find that so far as it has been there tested this principle\r\nreceives fresh support from the plants growing on the slopes of the\r\nHawaiian mountains. Although the author was only able to sample the\r\ninland flora, we have in the list given in Note 6 all kinds of plants,\r\nfrom the forest-tree to the herb, and most varieties of fruits.\r\nExcluding a few introduced plants, there are in this list about fifty\r\nspecies of indigenous plants belonging to about forty genera. Of these\r\nplants quite 80 per cent. possess seeds or fruits that sink either at\r\nonce or in a week or two. Of the “buoyant” residue very few have seeds\r\nor fruits that will float for months. These apparent exceptions to the\r\nprinciple are in great part capable of being explained on the grounds\r\nreferred to in Note 5 in connection with the Fijian inland plants; and I\r\nhave alluded to them in Note 7.\r\n\r\nThe littoral flora of Fiji is essentially Malayan and Asiatic, and for\r\nour purpose is eminently typical. Its plants are found far and wide on\r\nthe tropical coasts of the Old World, and sometimes also in the New\r\nWorld. In more than half the species we are concerned with the dispersal\r\nby currents of more or less dry indehiscent fruits that range usually in\r\nsize from a marble to a cricket-ball, as illustrated by those of\r\nHernandia peltata and Barringtonia speciosa, whilst with most of the\r\nrest the currents distribute large seeds, several of which are\r\nLeguminous, as in the case of Mucuna, Cæsalpinia, and Entada, with\r\nothers of the Convolvulus type, as in the instance of Ipomœa pes capræ.\r\nIt is remarkable that in selecting plants with buoyant seeds or\r\nseed-vessels for a station at the coast Nature has generally ignored\r\nthose with very small seeds. When such small seeded plants, as Sesuvium\r\nportulacastrum, occur on the beach, the seeds have as a rule no\r\nbuoyancy. Pemphis acidula is, however, an exception; but its case is a\r\nvery rare one. It will be established in the next chapter that the\r\nnon-buoyancy of small seeds is generally true also of plants growing by\r\nthe river or by the pond.\r\n\r\nThe point at which we have arrived in our inquiry concerning the general\r\ncollection of seeds and seed-vessels that we placed in sea-water is that\r\n_the plants with buoyant seeds or seed-vessels have been for the most\r\npart “located” at the coast_. But if we look a little more closely at\r\nthe sunken and floating seeds, we find that in the same genus there are\r\nspecies with seeds or seed-vessels that sink and species with those that\r\nfloat. We look again and then perceive that the same general principle\r\nis true of different species of the same genus growing inland and at the\r\ncoast. We learn now that as a rule when a genus possesses both littoral\r\nand inland species, the seeds or fruits of the former float in sea-water\r\nfor a long time, whilst those of the latter have little or no floating\r\npower. But we have yet to examine the structure of the coverings of the\r\nbuoyant seed or fruit; and we shall then discover that the different\r\nbehaviour in water is often associated with corresponding structural\r\ndifferences of a striking character. The structural causes of buoyancy\r\nare dealt with in Chapter XII.; and we will now content ourselves with\r\nenunciating the second principle that _in a genus comprising both coast\r\nand inland species, only the coast species possess buoyant seeds or\r\nseed-vessels_.\r\n\r\nThe important principle above indicated was not altogether new to me, as\r\nis shown in the next chapter. But it was new in the case of the floras\r\nof the Pacific Islands. When it first presented itself in Hawaii I was\r\nengaged in trying to find a connection between the inland and littoral\r\nspecies of Scævola; and its discovery led me to form a plan worthy\r\nalmost of Don Quixote, namely, to cultivate the beach species of Ipomœa,\r\nScævola, and Vitex in the interior with the hope of finding them\r\nconverted into inland species when I returned to Hawaii after a lapse of\r\nyears. Little matters often determine a career, and for a while my\r\nfuture movements and probably the remainder of my life were largely\r\ncentred around my interests in the well-being of Scævola Kœnigii. The\r\nscheme was actually undertaken, and I had fixed on a little plot of land\r\nat the foot of the mountains rising behind Punaluu in Kau. The\r\ntransaction was on the point of completion when the owner changed his\r\nmind and the plan fell through. Subsequent observation and reflection\r\nhave led me to believe that in most cases no connection exists between\r\nthe littoral and inland species of a genus; and I have dwelt on this\r\nincident merely to show the importance that I rightly attached to this\r\ndistinction, whilst misinterpreting its meaning.\r\n\r\nBut to return to my own investigations. Had I indeed read more carefully\r\nProfessor Schimper’s work on the Malayan strand-flora, this subject\r\nwould have been found discussed by an observer far abler than myself,\r\nthough from a very different standpoint, that of Adaptation and Natural\r\nSelection. He points out (pp. 179-182) that with a number of these\r\ntropical genera possessing both littoral and inland species, such as\r\nBarringtonia, Calophyllum, Clerodendron, Cordia, Guettarda, and\r\nTerminalia, greater buoyancy of the fruits of the shore species is\r\nassociated with certain structural characters in the fruit-coverings,\r\nwhilst with the inland species, where the floating power of the fruits\r\nis either much diminished or entirely absent, these structural\r\ncharacters are either less developed or lacking altogether.\r\n\r\nThe question of structure and the debateable matters concerned with it\r\nare treated at some length in Chapters XII. and XIII., and Professor\r\nSchimper’s views are there given. I will content myself with remarking\r\nthat the genus Terminalia was especially studied by him in this respect.\r\nHe tested the buoyancy of the fruits of ten species, and found that the\r\nflotation period varied from nothing to 126 days and more. By far the\r\nbest “floaters” were the fruits of Terminalia Katappa, the only littoral\r\nspecies tested, all the others being inland species with less buoyant\r\nfruits, and diminished ranges, some of the fruits sinking at once,\r\nwhilst the others sank usually in a few days or in a few weeks. It was\r\nalso ascertained that, although the buoyant tissue in the fruit-coats\r\nvaried in amount generally with the floating-powers, it was rarely\r\nabsent altogether in the inland species, a very significant conclusion,\r\nas will subsequently be pointed out.\r\n\r\nSeveral other striking examples of this principle came under my notice\r\nin the Pacific, and perhaps the most significant is that of Scævola, a\r\ngenus of the Goodeniaceæ, confined mainly to Australia and the Pacific\r\nislands, but possessing also a littoral species, S. Kœnigii, that is\r\nfound on tropical beaches all round the globe. It is associated in both\r\nHawaii and Fiji with inland species, none of which are common to the two\r\narchipelagoes, and in the case of the Hawaiian species not found outside\r\nthe group. All the species have fleshy drupes, both coast and inland\r\nplants, the “stone” in the littoral species possessing a thick covering\r\nof buoyant tissue, which is absent or but slightly developed in the\r\ninland species. The fruits of the shore species float for many months;\r\nwhilst those of the inland species experimented on by me (S.\r\nChamissoniana and S. Gaudichaudii in Hawaii, and S. floribunda in Fiji)\r\nsank at once or within a few hours. Here we are only concerned with the\r\ndifference of buoyancy between inland and littoral species. The several\r\nother questions involved concerning this genus will be dealt with later\r\non in this work.\r\n\r\nThe genus Morinda offers another good example of this principle. It\r\nincludes one widely-spread littoral species (M. citrifolia), found not\r\nonly in all the Pacific archipelagoes, but also over much of the\r\ntropics. It is associated in all the large groups with one or more\r\ninland species, some of which are endemic and others more generally\r\ndistributed. The littoral species displays in its pyrenes a singular\r\nair-cavity, the nature of which is discussed in Chapter XII., which\r\nendows them with great floating powers. This cavity is not found in\r\ninland species, and the pyrenes have in consequence no floating power\r\n(see Note 8).\r\n\r\nCalophyllum Inophyllum, an Old-World littoral tree, spread far and wide\r\nover the Pacific islands, has very buoyant fruits. In the groups of the\r\nSouth Pacific it is associated with inland species that are commonly\r\nfound in the forests, namely, C. spectabile and C. Burmanni, the fruits\r\nof both of which, according to my observations in Fiji, have limited\r\nfloating powers, sinking after periods varying from a few days to four\r\nweeks, and lacking in great part the buoyant coverings of the littoral\r\nspecies. Professor Schimper obtained similar results with inland species\r\nfrom other regions (Note 9).\r\n\r\nThe fruits of the two Fijian coast trees, Barringtonia speciosa and B.\r\nracemosa, possess great floating powers; whilst those of an undescribed\r\nspecies that I found in the mountains of Vanua Levu sink at once.\r\nAnother Fijian inland species (B. edulis, Seem.) that is often planted,\r\nhas fruits that float heavily for about a month. This difference in\r\nbuoyant powers is also associated with characteristic differences in the\r\nstructure of the fruits. It would be interesting to learn what floating\r\ncapacity belongs to those of the Samoan endemic species (B. samoensis,\r\nGray). Professor Schimper’s observations on the genus in the Malayan\r\nregion point in the same direction, but more than one difficulty awaits\r\nits solution in the re-examination of the genus. He says, however, that\r\nB. excelsa, Bl., a Malayan species, sometimes cultivated and growing\r\nboth inland and at the coast, has fruits that floated for one hundred\r\ndays after drying (p. 173).\r\n\r\nA striking instance of this principle is afforded in the case of the two\r\nFijian species of Tacca, the wide-ranging littoral species, T.\r\npinnatifida, where the seeds float for several months, and the inland\r\nspecies, T. maculata, Seem., found also in Australia and Samoa, where\r\nthe seeds sink at once or in a few days. The seeds of the shore plant\r\nowe their buoyancy to the spongy tissue in their coverings, which is\r\neither absent or much less developed in those of the inland species.\r\nThis point might also be determined for the new Samoan inland species\r\ndescribed by Reinecke, the German botanist, as T. samoensis.\r\n\r\nAnother good illustration is afforded by the two species of Premna of\r\nthe South Pacific, though here the buoyancy of the “stone” of a drupe is\r\nconcerned. With P. taitensis or P. integrifolia, a small littoral tree\r\nor shrub, these stones possess great floating-power, and are often found\r\nin the floating seed-drift of the Fijian estuaries and in the stranded\r\ndrift of the beaches. In the case of Premna serratifolia, an inland tree\r\nof moderate size, the stones have as a rule little or no buoyancy. As\r\nshown in Note 32, where this genus is discussed in detail, the buoyancy\r\nis mainly due to empty seed-cavities.\r\n\r\nOther instances might be given in illustration of this principle; but it\r\nwill have been noticed that already many of the familiar trees and\r\nshrubs of a tropical beach have been mentioned in this connection either\r\nby Professor Schimper or by myself. There are other genera that afford\r\nsimilar indications but in a less direct fashion.\r\n\r\nFor instance, there are three widely spread Leguminous beach plants of\r\nthe Pacific, Erythrina indica, Canavalia obtusifolia, and Sophora\r\ntomentosa, none of which are found in Hawaii; but in that group the\r\ngenus is represented in each case by an inland species, Erythrina\r\nmonosperma, Canavalia galeata, and Sophora chrysophylla, the last two\r\nspecies being peculiar to those islands. The seeds of the three littoral\r\nspecies will float for a long time in sea-water, whilst those of the\r\nthree Hawaiian inland species have no buoyancy. I may say that some very\r\ninteresting questions relating to the origin of these inland species are\r\nhere raised. They will be discussed in a later chapter (Chap. XV.).\r\n\r\nThere are a number of plants belonging to the Convolvulaceæ in these\r\nislands that behave in an irregular way in flotation experiments ; but\r\ntheir inconstant behaviour can in most cases be explained in accordance\r\nwith the principle that in the same genus the shore species have buoyant\r\nseeds and the inland species non-buoyant seeds. Thus, whilst the seeds\r\nof the littoral species, Ipomœa pes capræ, I. grandiflora (Lam.), and I.\r\nglaberrima (Boj.), can float for long periods, and those of the inland\r\nspecies, I. pentaphylla, I. tuberculata, and I. Batatas (Sweet Potato),\r\nhave no buoyancy, the seeds of other inland species, I. insularis\r\n(Steud.), I. bona nox (L.), and I. turpethum (R. Br.), are inconstant in\r\ntheir behaviour. The three last-named species are, however, to be found\r\nalso flourishing at times at and near the coast, and the varying\r\nfloating powers of their seeds may probably be connected with their\r\nvarying stations. This is indeed suggested by the case of Argyreia\r\ntiliæfolia in Hawaii, in which in my experiments the seeds of plants\r\ngrowing at the coast floated, sometimes for months, whilst those from\r\ninland plants sank.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour of the Convolvulaceæ becomes yet more intelligible, and\r\nmore in accordance with the principle, when we reflect that the cause of\r\nbuoyancy is not concerned with the seed-coats or with the nucleus,\r\nneither of which are able to float, but with the air-spaces left by the\r\nincomplete filling-up of the seed-cavity by the crumpled embryo. The\r\nextent to which the seed-cavity is filled up varies not only between\r\ndifferent genera and between different species of the same genus, but\r\nalso amongst individuals of the same species. Even the seeds of Ipomœa\r\npes capræ, amongst the most typical of floating seeds, display this\r\nvariation, and they show it also in their floating power, since about a\r\nthird of the seeds usually sink during the first month or two of the\r\nflotation experiments. We can thus explain also why in the case of\r\nIpomœa insularis seeds from Fiji floated for months, whilst those from\r\nHawaii had no floating power.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of the different species of Hibiscus also appear to behave\r\nvery irregularly; but even here most of the difficulties can be removed,\r\nwhen we come to consider a further extension of the principle. Thus,\r\nwhilst the seeds of Hibiscus tiliaceus, a wide-ranging littoral tree\r\nknown to be dispersed by the currents, float for a long time, those of\r\nH. Youngianus (Gaud.), an endemic Hawaiian species, and of two\r\nwide-ranging species, H. diversifolius (Jacq.) and H. Abelmoschus (L.),\r\nalso float for some time. The Hawaiian plant, however, grows in wet\r\nplaces; and this applies also to H. diversifolius which grows in swamps\r\nat and near the coast. The extension of the principle to water-side\r\nplants generally, which is discussed in the next chapter, will explain\r\nthe difficulties connected with these two species. But we have in H.\r\nAbelmoschus a remarkable exception to any rule of buoyancy, since it\r\ngrows in dry situations, is often cultivated, and yet possesses a\r\nspecial layer of buoyant tissue in the seed-coats to which the floating\r\npower is due. The seeds of Hibiscus esculentus (L.), the widely spread\r\ncultivated plant of the tropics, have no buoyancy.\r\n\r\nSome curious indications are supplied by Cæsalpinia, a Leguminous genus,\r\ncontaining two wide-ranging shore species. Speaking generally the rule\r\napplies; and I found in Fiji that whilst the seeds of the two littoral\r\nplants (C. Bonducella and C. Bonduc) were as a rule buoyant, those of an\r\ninland mountain species sank. But it is very remarkable that although\r\nthe seeds of C. Bonducella have long been known to be transported by the\r\ncurrents, and are often stranded by the Gulf Stream on the coast of\r\nScandinavia, when it grows in Hawaii, where it is as a rule an inland\r\nplant, the seeds lose their buoyancy. This is quite in accordance with\r\nthe general principle; but I must refer the reader for a general\r\ntreatment of this genus to Chapter XVII. There also will be found the\r\ninstance of another Fijian littoral plant, Afzelia bijuga, a common\r\nlittoral tree with buoyant seeds which also lose their buoyancy when the\r\ntree grows inland. A similar instance is afforded by Kleinhovia Hospita,\r\nthe seeds of which seem to lose their buoyancy in inland stations. Not\r\nall littoral plants, however, lose the floating power of the seeds when\r\ngrown away from the coast. The seeds of Ipomœa pes capræ retain it in\r\nspite of the change of station. This point is dealt with in Chapter XIII\r\nand in Note 44.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this general sketch of the first results obtained by\r\ntesting the buoyancy in sea-water of a collection of seeds and fruits\r\nfrom a mountainous Pacific island, such as we find in Fiji, I must\r\nremind the reader that the subject has only been lightly treated.\r\nEnough, however, has been said to illustrate the character of the\r\nsorting-process by which in the course of ages the plants with buoyant\r\nseeds or seedvessels have been gathered at the coast. This is\r\nindicated:—\r\n\r\n(1) By the far greater proportion of species with buoyant seeds and\r\nseedvessels amongst the shore plants than among the inland plants.\r\n\r\n(2) By the circumstance that almost all the seeds or fruits that float\r\nunharmed for long periods belong to shore plants.\r\n\r\n(3) By the fact that when a genus has both inland and littoral species,\r\nthe seeds or fruits of the coast species as a rule float for a long\r\ntime, whilst those of the inland species either sink at once or float\r\nonly for a short period.\r\n\r\nThese results, therefore, justify our dividing the flora of our island\r\ninto two groups, the one including the plants with buoyant seeds or\r\nfruits and comprising most of the littoral plants, the other including\r\nthe plants with non-buoyant seeds or fruits, a group which contains\r\nalmost all the inland plants and indeed nine-tenths of the flora. This\r\nclassification is a very crude one; but it enables us at once to assign\r\na value to the agency of currents in stocking a Pacific island with its\r\nplants. Yet this is but the initial step in an inquiry that branches off\r\nin a thousand different ways, even if restricted to the littoral plants.\r\nThere are a host of difficulties connected with the history of the\r\nstrand-flora of such an island which can only be properly gauged when\r\nviewed from various standpoints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                    THE LESSON OF THE BRITISH FLORA\r\n\r\nResults of observations on the buoyancy of over 300 British plants.—The\r\n  small proportion of plants with buoyant seeds or seedvessels.—Their\r\n  station by the water-side.—The great sifting experiment of the\r\n  ages.—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE singular relation between station and seed-buoyancy that exists in\r\nan island of the tropical Pacific, such for instance as Vanua Levu,\r\nTahiti, or Hawaii, would lose much of its significance if it stood alone\r\nin the economy of plant-life. It must be true not only of tropical\r\nfloras generally, but of those of the temperate regions; and there can\r\nbe little doubt that it prevails all over the world. Displayed to us at\r\nfirst in a Pacific island, it acquires a new significance when we study\r\nit in the light of numerous observations made in Europe. It exhibits\r\nitself then as part of a far wider method pursued by Nature in\r\ndetermining the stations of plants. It is not only at the coast, but\r\nalso at the river-bank and at the lake-side that Nature “locates” the\r\nplant with the buoyant seed or seedvessel. This relation is indeed as\r\nwell exhibited in inland districts as it is at the coast.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I have the results of my own investigations on the\r\nbuoyancy of the seeds and fruits of British plants and on the\r\ncomposition of the seed-drift of ponds and rivers, which were carried on\r\nin the years 1890-96. Some of them were published in a short paper on\r\nthe seed-drift of the Thames, read before the Linnean Society of London\r\nin June, 1892, and in the columns of _Science Gossip_ for April, May,\r\nand October, 1895; but the mass of the observations remain in my\r\nnotebooks. Nor do my observations of the period since elapsed lead me to\r\nalter the position then adopted. I have since pursued the same line of\r\ninquiry in Hawaii, Fiji, on the Pacific coast of South America, and in\r\nSicily, and with the same results.\r\n\r\nSince the elaboration of my notes was begun in 1900, Dr. Sernander, the\r\nSwedish botanist, has published (1901) his work in Swedish on the\r\nDispersal-biology of the Scandinavian plant-world, in which the\r\nseed-drift of river, pond, and sea is exhaustively treated. Although\r\nthis author has dealt with plant-dispersal from a somewhat different\r\nstandpoint, I have perused his pages with the keenest interest and with\r\ngreat profit, having gone over much of the same ground with respect to\r\nthe seed-drift of ponds and rivers. Yet the introductory remarks to my\r\npaper in _Science Gossip_ in 1895 are as apposite now as they were then,\r\nand the reader will, I trust, pardon my reproducing them.\r\n\r\n“By following up the path of inquiry that is concerned with the\r\nflotation of seeds and seedvessels, we are guided into other fields of\r\nresearch that give promise of interesting discoveries in connection with\r\nplant-life. We are led in the first place to consider the question of\r\nutility, and to ask whether the buoyancy of the seed or fruit has been a\r\nmatter of moment in the history of the species. Nature is ever engaged\r\nin telling off the plants to their various stations. She places the\r\nyellow iris at the river’s side and assigns to the blue iris its home in\r\na shady wood. Under her direction the common alder thrives at the\r\nwater’s edge, whilst its fellow species live on the mountain slope.\r\nThese and similar operations are carried on daily around us, and we know\r\nbut little of the wherefore and the how. We are induced, therefore, to\r\ninquire whether by pursuing the line of investigation above indicated we\r\nmay be able to get a glimpse at the methods adopted by Nature in\r\nselecting stations for plants.”\r\n\r\nI possess the results, which are given in Note 10, of buoyancy\r\nexperiments and observations on the seeds and seedvessels of about 320\r\nBritish flowering plants belonging to about 65 families. Of these about\r\n260 are included in my own results, the data for the rest being obtained\r\nfrom the writings of Darwin, Martins, Thuret, Kolpin Ravn, and\r\nSernander. In the great proportion of cases, 240, or 75 per cent.,\r\nsinking took place at once or within a week; whilst 80, or 25 per cent.,\r\nfloated for a longer period, usually a month or more; and about 60, or\r\nnearly 20 per cent., floated for several months. It is to this last\r\nsmall group that belong the seeds or seedvessels that float through the\r\nwinter in our ponds and rivers.\r\n\r\nIf the grasses had been properly represented, the grains of which\r\npossess as a rule but little buoyancy, except through air-bubbles\r\ntemporarily entangled in the glumes, the proportion of seeds and fruits\r\nthat sink at once or in a few days would probably have been about 80 per\r\ncent. Then again, since the plants from stations where buoyant seeds and\r\nseedvessels are most frequently found—that is at the river-side, the\r\npond-margin, and the sea-coast—are much more completely represented in\r\nthese experiments than those from other stations, it would seem that\r\neven 80 per cent. is too low a figure. Even if the 80 plants with the\r\nbuoyant seeds or seedvessels included all the species thus\r\ncharacterised, which they certainly do not, we should obtain an estimate\r\nfor the British flora (rather over 1,200 species of flowering plants) of\r\nabout 93 per cent. with non-buoyant seeds or fruits. This is, of course,\r\ntoo high. It is, however, very probable that the proportion of plants\r\nwith non-buoyant seeds or seedvessels for the whole British flora is\r\nabout 90 per cent.\r\n\r\nThis proportion of plants with non-buoyant seeds or seedvessels, that is\r\nto say, of those that sink at once or within a week, is also\r\napproximately correct for the flora of one of the larger islands of the\r\ntropical Pacific. The data at my disposal only enable me in the cases of\r\nFiji and Hawaii to fix it at between 95 and 85 per cent., or on an\r\naverage 90 per cent. With the floras of continental regions the\r\nproportion would doubtless be markedly higher. That seeds and\r\nseedvessels as a rule possess but little buoyancy was a sound conclusion\r\nof Darwin, and one, as he remarked, that is in accordance with the\r\ncommon experience of gardeners. Thuret, after experimenting on the\r\nbuoyancy in sea-water of the seed or seedvessels of 251 species of\r\nplants, belonging to 77 families and to various regions, found that\r\nscarcely two per cent. had any powers of flotation, all the rest sinking\r\nat once or in a few days, a result that led De Candolle in a note to\r\nthis memoir to reiterate his opinion regarding the inefficacy of\r\ncurrents as plant distributors. Thuret, however, did not select many of\r\nhis plants from stations where buoyancy is most frequently exhibited,\r\nand his estimate errs, therefore, in imputing too little buoyancy to\r\nseeds in general. The power of seeds and fruits to germinate after\r\nprolonged flotation in sea-water has long been well established, and it\r\nis often illustrated in this work, so that there is no need to dwell\r\nupon it here. (See Note 11.)\r\n\r\nOf the 240 species of British plants where sinking took place at once or\r\nwithin a week, in about 50 per cent. the plants had dry indehiscent\r\nfruits, such as we find in the genus Ranunculus and in the Umbelliferæ,\r\nthe Compositæ, and the Labiatæ; whilst in about a third the plants had\r\ndehiscent fruits with small seeds, such as are characteristic of the\r\nCruciferæ, the Caryophyllaceæ, and the Juncaceæ. Plants with large\r\nseeds, such as those of Nuphar luteum and Convolvulus arvensis, make up\r\nonly six per cent. of those of the non-buoyant group, the remainder\r\ncomprising plants with berries, such as Solanum, and others with\r\nmiscellaneous fruits.\r\n\r\nOf the 80 plants where the seeds or fruits floated more than a week,\r\nusually for several weeks, and often for months, 70 per cent. possessed\r\ndry, indehiscent fruits, such as those of Hydrocotyle vulgaris, Bidens\r\ncernua, Lycopus europæus, Carex, &c., whilst only 6 or 7 per cent. had\r\ndehiscent fruits with small seeds, such as we find in Lysimachia and\r\nMenyanthes, the remainder being generally characterised by large seeds,\r\nsuch as those of Convolvulus sepium, C. soldanella, Iris pseudacorus,\r\nCalla palustris, &c. It would thus appear that, in so far as buoyancy is\r\nconcerned, Nature has for the most part ignored the small seed and has\r\nconfined herself mainly to the dry indehiscent fruit. We have already\r\nseen that this is also true of the same great sorting-process in the\r\ntropical islands of the Pacific, and it doubtless applies all over the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nWe have now to learn the significance of this distinction amongst\r\nBritish plants between those with and those without buoyant seeds or\r\nseedvessels. When we regard the stations of these 80 plants of the\r\nbuoyant group we find that about 70 per cent. of them are placed by the\r\nriver, or the pond, or the sea, the fresh-water stations much\r\npredominating. But if we include the plants of the moist meadows\r\nadjoining the rivers, such as Ranunculus repens, Rhinanthus crista\r\ngalli, some Cyperaceæ, &c., the buoyant fruits or seeds of which are\r\nregularly swept into the stream in the time of flood, we shall raise the\r\nproportion possessing a water-side station to 80 per cent. On the other\r\nhand, about two-thirds of the 240 plants of the non-buoyant group, which\r\nare enumerated in Note 10, live away from the water-side; but the\r\nproportion of plants with a relatively dry station would be considerably\r\nhigher than this figure for the whole flora, since my investigations\r\nwere especially directed towards plants frequenting wet stations, and\r\nthe number of them is excessive in the list.\r\n\r\nSupposing, however, that our materials were restricted to the 260 plants\r\ntested by myself, we should obtain highly instructive results, since in\r\na general sense the floating powers of their seeds or fruits were tested\r\nto the finish. We place them, let us say, in a bucket of water, and\r\nafter six months we find that in not more than forty plants are the\r\nseeds or seedvessels still afloat. These forty plants, excluding two or\r\nthree littoral plants, are nearly all plants of the borders and vicinity\r\nof rivers and ponds. (They are indicated in the list given in Note 10 by\r\nthe numbers vi. and xii., the last being those where the flotation\r\nexperiment was prolonged to a year and over.)\r\n\r\nIt would thus seem—I am now quoting mainly from my paper in _Science\r\nGossip_ for May, 1895—that there are gathered at the margins of rivers\r\nand ponds, as well as at the sea-border, most of the British plants that\r\ncould be assisted in the distribution of their seeds by the agency of\r\nwater. This great sifting experiment has been the work of the ages, and\r\nwe here get a glimpse at Nature in the act of selecting a station. But\r\nthe curious character of the sorting process becomes yet more apparent\r\nwhen we discover that the buoyancy of the seeds or fruits of species of\r\nthe same genus may become a matter of station.\r\n\r\nWe will first take the four British species of Stachys (arvensis,\r\nbetonica, sylvatica, and palustris). Of these the fruits of S. palustris\r\nalone possess any buoyancy, being able to float for weeks. It is the\r\nonly species that finds its characteristic home at the water-side; and\r\nas observed by Sernander its reproductive shoots occur in the\r\nScandinavian fresh-water drift.\r\n\r\nGalium illustrates the same principle. Whilst in my experiments the\r\nfruits of G. aparine and of another species growing in a dry station\r\ndisplayed little or no floating power, those of G. palustre, which alone\r\ngrows at the water-side and in wet situations, have great buoyancy. As\r\nmy observations show, they float unharmed through the winter in our\r\nponds and rivers, and, according to Sernander, are often found in the\r\nBaltic sea-drift. (See Note 12.)\r\n\r\nThe achenes of Potentilla afford another example. Those of P.\r\ntormentilla and of another species from dry situations have but little\r\nfloating power. On the other hand, those of P. comarum float\r\nindefinitely. The last also came under my notice in the floating drift\r\nof ponds in February; and we learn from Sernander that they occur in the\r\nfresh-water and salt-water drift of Scandinavia.\r\n\r\nAs a further instance, I will take the two British species of Iris. The\r\nfamiliar river-side Iris pseudacorus has seeds that float unharmed in\r\nour ponds and rivers from the autumn to the spring, and often for a year\r\nor more. On the other hand, the seeds of Iris fœtidissima, which has its\r\nhome in the shady wood, sink at once even after drying for months.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the sorting-process is especially well shown in some of\r\nthe families, as for instance with the Labiatæ. Let the reader put on\r\none side the four species with buoyant fruits, namely, Lycopus europæus,\r\nMentha aquatica, Scutellaria galericulata, and Stachys palustris, and on\r\nthe other side all the species with non-buoyant fruits, such as Salvia\r\nverbenaca, Thymus sp., Calamintha officinalis, Nepeta glechoma, N.\r\ncataria, Prunella vulgaris, Stachys arvensis, S. betonica, S. sylvatica,\r\nGaleopsis tetrahit, Ballota nigra, Lamium purpureum, L. album, Teucrium\r\nscorodonia, and Ajuga reptans, and he will at once perceive that he has\r\nseparated the regular water-side plants from those growing in drier\r\nstations.\r\n\r\nIf he does the same with the Umbelliferæ he will find that when he is\r\nseparating Hydrocotyle vulgaris, Cicuta virosa, Œnanthe crocata, and\r\nAngelica sylvestris from Æthusa cynapium, Pastinaca sativa, and\r\nChærophyllum sylvestre, on account of their buoyant fruits, he is also\r\ndistinguishing them on account of their stations. On the other hand,\r\nthere are apparently weighty exceptions to this rule in the non-buoyancy\r\nof the fruits of the three British species of Apium (graveolens,\r\nnodiflorum, inundatum), which grow in streams and marshes. Or, again, if\r\nwe look at the sea-coast representatives of the family, we find that\r\nwhilst the fruits of the Samphire (Crithmum maritimum) float buoyantly\r\nfor months, those of Eryngium maritimum seemingly set the law at\r\ndefiance, and all sink in less than a week or ten days, even after\r\nmonths of drying. To regard these as exceptions, however, is to miss the\r\nessential point of the principle concerned. It is not thereby implied\r\nthat all water-side plants, whether by the sea or by the river or by the\r\npond, have buoyant fruits or seeds, but that nearly all plants with such\r\nfruits or seeds have been gathered at the water-side. It will be shown\r\nin the next chapter that several other influences go to determine the\r\nstation of a plant on a beach or by a river. This is true of the\r\nCompositæ, which, if we except our two species of Bidens (cernua and\r\ntripartita), come under the play of other determining causes, as\r\nindicated by the little or no buoyancy displayed by the fruits of Aster\r\ntripolium, Senecio aquaticus, and Carduus palustris.\r\n\r\nWithin the limits of a genus we can, however, point to other examples of\r\nthis principle. Take, for instance, Convolvulus arvensis, the common\r\nweed of our fields. Its seeds, whether fresh or dried for months, have\r\nno buoyancy. On the other hand, those of Convolvulus soldanella float\r\nunharmed in sea-water for half a year and more. Its seeds have come\r\nfrequently under my notice among the stranded drift of the Devonshire\r\nbeaches, and also on the coasts of Chile; whilst Sernander includes them\r\namongst the drift of the beaches on the Norwegian coasts. It is\r\nremarkable that Convolvulus sepium, which accompanies C. soldanella over\r\nmuch of its great range, has seeds that are sometimes able to float\r\nunharmed for long periods, even for years (Notes 13, 41, 49). Though not\r\nstrictly a water-side plant, it grows commonly over other plants on the\r\nbanks of the Thames; and when it fruits its seeds occur typically in the\r\nfloating drift of that river. According to Gray, it is almost a\r\nriver-side plant in the United States, where it is found “especially on\r\nthe moist banks of streams.” Not all the seeds of C. sepium, however,\r\nare buoyant; and in its varying behaviour in this respect it resembles\r\nthe inland species of Ipomœa, which are referred to in the previous\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nThe British species of Euphorbia also seem to behave in accordance with\r\nthe principle that when a genus has littoral and inland species, the\r\nfirst-named alone possesses buoyant fruits or seeds. Thus, whilst the\r\nsound fruits of E. helioscopia and of another species found commonly as\r\na garden weed are non-buoyant, those of E. paralias, the familiar\r\nbeach-plant, float for several weeks, and are to be noticed among the\r\nstranded drift of the coasts frequented by this plant. (See Note 90 for\r\nlater results.)\r\n\r\nThe structural characters connected with the buoyancy of the seeds or\r\nseedvessels of some of the British plants are dealt with in Chapter XII.\r\nHere it may be remarked that this capacity is often associated, as with\r\nthe Pacific island plants, with a “buoyant” tissue, that is either\r\nabsent or less developed in the case of the non-buoyant group.\r\n\r\nEnough has now been said to show in a general fashion how Nature through\r\nthe agency of buoyant seeds and fruits has affected the stations of\r\nplants of the British flora. Allowing this line of inquiry to develop\r\nitself as the work proceeds, we will here pause and close the chapter\r\nwith a reference to some of the principal points that have been brought\r\ninto prominence.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The proportion of flowering plants of the British flora that\r\npossess buoyant seeds or seedvessels is very small, probably not more\r\nthan 10 per cent.\r\n\r\n(_b_) In so far as buoyancy is concerned, Nature has for the most part\r\nignored the dehiscent fruit with small seeds, such as we see in the\r\nCruciferæ and the Caryophyllaceæ, and has chiefly endowed with floating\r\npower the dry indehiscent fruit, such as we see in the Umbelliferæ and\r\nin the Labiatæ.\r\n\r\n(_c_) In the great sorting-process that has been in operation through\r\nthe ages, nearly all the plants with buoyant seeds or seedvessels have\r\nbeen located at the water-side, principally by ponds and rivers, but\r\nalso on the sea-beach. On the other hand, the great majority of the\r\nplants with seeds or seedvessels that sink have found a home in drier\r\nstations.\r\n\r\n(_d_) The character of the operation is well displayed in certain genera\r\npossessing species of the water-side and species of drier situations,\r\nand in the case of genera having both coast and inland species. In both\r\ninstances the species by the water-side possesses buoyant seeds or\r\nfruits, whilst that of the station in a drier locality or removed from\r\nthe coast has seeds or fruits that sink.\r\n\r\n(_e_) Yet it is necessary to remember that the principle involved is not\r\nthat all water-side plants have buoyant seeds or fruits, but merely that\r\nplants thus endowed gather at the water-side. There are many plants with\r\nnon-buoyant seeds or fruits on our beaches and beside our ponds and\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\n(_f_) We have now learned from the British flora that the “locating” of\r\nplants with buoyant fruits or seeds on the beaches of the tropical\r\nislands of the Pacific, and indeed of tropical regions generally, is but\r\na part of a much wider principle by which plants thus endowed are placed\r\nat the water-side, whether by a river or a pond or by the sea.\r\n\r\n(_g_) It is with this distinction between a fresh-water and a salt-water\r\nstation that we shall be occupied in the next chapter; and it is of\r\ngreat interest, since it leads us to discover that the wider principle\r\nis in its turn part of a far larger scheme.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Note._—It must be clearly understood that by water-side plants the true\r\naquatic plants, such as the Water-lilies, the Myriophylls, the\r\nPotamogetons, &c., are not implied. It will be seen from the list in\r\nNote 10 that in most cases the seeds or fruits of aquatic plants have\r\nlittle or no floating power. This is true, for instance, of Ranunculus\r\naquatilis, Nymphæa, Nuphar, Myriophyllum, Ceratophyllum, Callitriche,\r\nNaias, Zannichellia, Ruppia, and half the Potamogetons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n             THE LESSON OF THE BRITISH FLORA (_continued_)\r\n\r\nThe choice of station of the water-side plant possessing buoyant seeds\r\n  or seedvessels.—Determined by its fitness or unfitness for living in\r\n  physiologically dry stations.—In the internal organisation of a plant\r\n  lies the first determining influence of station.—The grouping of the\r\n  British strand-plants.—Whilst the Xerophyte with buoyant seed or fruit\r\n  finds its station at the coast, the Hygrophyte similarly endowed makes\r\n  its home at the river or pond side.—The grouping of the plants of the\r\n  river and the pond.—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY following up the clue supplied by the floating seed, we have arrived\r\nat the conclusion with respect to the British flora that plants with\r\nbuoyant seeds or fruits gather at the water-side. But we have yet to\r\ninquire why some of these plants are “located” at the sea-coast and\r\nothers on the borders of ponds and rivers. Mere buoyancy aided by chance\r\nhas not determined the choice. There are definite principles at work in\r\nthe economy of plant-life that make the selection for each plant.\r\n\r\nRivers in all parts of the world carry to the sea in great abundance the\r\nseeds and fruits of the plants that are stationed at their borders; and\r\nsuch seed-drift is found in quantity washed up on the beaches in the\r\nvicinity of the estuary. One finds, for instance, on such beaches in the\r\nSouth of England the stranded fruits and seeds of Bidens cernua, Alnus\r\nglutinosa, Sparganium ramosum, Iris pseudacorus, &c., mingled with those\r\nof true beach plants like Cakile maritima, Convolvulus soldanella,\r\nEuphorbia paralias, &c. Yet we would be much surprised if either the\r\nBidens or the Alder or the Sparganium were to establish itself on the\r\nsandy beach, even though they have had through the ages innumerable\r\nopportunities of doing so. We thus see that mere buoyancy of fruit or\r\nseed cannot determine a station on a sea-beach, and that some other\r\nfactor makes the choice. The nature of this factor I will now endeavour\r\nto explain; but in so doing it will be necessary to employ a few\r\ntechnical terms, which it is not easy to dispense with altogether.\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted whether Professor Schimper could have conferred a\r\ngreater benefit on the student of plant-distribution than in his clear\r\ndelineation of the connection between the habit or organisation of a\r\nplant and its station. Nature has imposed an important structural\r\ndistinction between plants that have been endowed with the means of\r\nchecking excessive transpiration or water-loss in stations where there\r\nis risk of drought, as in deserts and in similar arid localities, and\r\nthose that live in stations where such safeguards are not needed. Hence\r\narises the distinction between Xerophytes on the one hand, and\r\nHygrophytes on the other. This contrast is shown not only in minute\r\nstructural features, but also, as my readers are aware, in the external\r\ncharacters, as in hairiness, succulency, a leathery cuticle, the\r\noccurrence of thorns, and in several other characters of the plants of\r\nthe steppe and the desert. This important subject is dealt with by\r\nProfessor Schimper in his recent work on Plant-Geography; but it was\r\nfrom his earlier work on the Indo-Malayan strand-flora that I learned\r\nthis valuable lesson in plant-distribution.\r\n\r\nIt has been ascertained, however, that a safeguard against excessive\r\nwater-loss by transpiration is not only needed by plants living in arid\r\nlocalities, but also by those placed at the coast. Both the shore plant\r\nand the plant of the steppe and the desert present the same xerophilous\r\norganisation, provision against excessive transpiration being also\r\nrequired by the beach plant to prevent the injury of the green cells\r\nfrom the accumulation of salt in the tissues. It would thus appear that\r\nplants of the Hygrophytes that possess buoyant seeds or fruits are\r\ngathered at the borders of ponds and rivers, whilst those of the\r\nXerophytes that are similarly endowed find their station on the\r\nsea-shore. This important distinction penetrates very deeply into the\r\nconditions defining the stations of plants. The connection between the\r\nplant of the coast and the plant of the steppe or the desert is\r\nstrikingly shown on those occasions when the beach plants extend inland\r\nover parched and arid plains, such as occurs for instance in North\r\nAfrica, and in the larger islands of Fiji, as described in Chapter V.\r\n\r\nThe causes of the buoyancy of fruits and seeds, as pointed out in\r\nChapter XII, are so various, that it appears at first sight impossible\r\nto connect them with the xerophilous or hygrophilous organisation of a\r\nplant, or, in other words, with any structural characters associated\r\nwith particular stations; yet behind all lies the general principle\r\nthat, given a plant of the buoyant group, if it is a Xerophyte it finds\r\nits way to the coast, and if a Hygrophyte it makes its home by ponds and\r\nrivers. In the case of a tropical littoral flora, such as we find in a\r\nPacific island, the large proportion of plants with buoyant fruits or\r\nseeds gives so much prominence to the subject of their distribution by\r\ncurrents that the question of “station” is often masked. On the other\r\nhand, in the shore-flora of a temperate region like that of Great\r\nBritain, the plants with buoyant seeds or fruits are in the minority,\r\nand the question of “station” is the first to obtrude itself.\r\n\r\nIn establishing the principle that most of the plants with buoyant seeds\r\nor fruits have been gathered at the water-side, it was never implied\r\nthat all the plants by the river or by the pond or at the coast are thus\r\ncharacterised. There is much to learn from the circumstance that whilst\r\nnearly all plants with buoyant seeds or fruits are placed at the\r\nwater-side, not all water-side plants have buoyant seeds or fruits. In\r\nthe first place, it is to be inferred in the light of what has been said\r\nabove that the first determining principle in the selection of a station\r\nis concerned not with the buoyancy of the seeds or fruits, but with the\r\nxerophytic or hygrophytic organisation of a plant. In other words, it is\r\nthe fitness or the unfitness of a plant for living in situations where\r\nthe loss of water by transpiration requires to be checked that primarily\r\ndetermines the station at the coast. We thus see in the internal\r\norganisation of the plant the primary determining influence on station.\r\nBuoyancy of seed or fruit comes subsequently into play, the Xerophyte\r\nand the Hygrophyte, thus endowed, ultimately finding their way, the\r\nfirst to the beach, the second to the bank of the river or to the margin\r\nof the lake or pond.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, when we regard the composition of the British\r\ncoast-flora, and examine the distribution of the plants in other\r\nsituations than on the beach, we obtain some interesting results. There\r\nis first a group of plants, including such as Armeria vulgaris,\r\nArtemisia maritima, Cochlearia officinalis, Erodium maritimum,\r\nMatricaria inodora, Plantago coronopus, Polycarpon tetraphyllum,\r\nRaphanus maritimus, Spergularia rubra, Silene maritima (see Note 15),\r\nand others, all of which occur not only at the coast and on the adjacent\r\nhill-slopes, but also often far inland, and sometimes at considerable\r\nelevations in mountainous districts, as in Central Europe. It is on this\r\noccurrence of certain shore-plants in alpine regions that Prof. Schimper\r\nlays much stress in his memoir on the Indo-Malayan strand-flora (p. 28),\r\nand in his later work on Plant Geography (Engl. edit., p. 716), when\r\npointing out that here temperature does not play a determining part, and\r\nthat in both stations, whether on the sandy beach or on the\r\nmountain-top, the same xerophilous organisation is needed to obviate the\r\nrisk of impeded water-supply. He quotes in this connection the\r\nobservation of Battandier that many alpine species from the Atlas\r\nMountains occur on the Algerian beaches, but not in intervening regions.\r\nMr. Druce, in his discussion of the British species of Sea-Thrifts and\r\nSea-Lavenders (Armeria, Statice), brought the subject of the occurrence\r\nof maritime plants on mountain summits again to the front; but he did\r\nnot advance any general explanation, and seems to regard it as the\r\nresult, as it doubtless is, of the recurrence of suitable stations\r\n(_Jour. Linn. Soc. Bot._, Dec. 1900).\r\n\r\nVery few of these plants have any capacity for dispersal by currents, a\r\nsubject dealt with in Note 16. Several of them have dehiscent,\r\nsmall-seeded fruits which, as pointed out in the previous chapter,\r\nhardly ever come into the buoyant category. I have experimented on the\r\ngreater number of them, and in only one species, Matricaria inodora\r\n(var. maritima), do the results indicate a capacity for dispersal over\r\nwide tracts of sea.\r\n\r\nIf we look again at a list of British shore-plants, we find another\r\ngroup of plants frequenting salt marshes and muddy shores, and found\r\nalso often far inland, as in the saline plains of Central Asia. Here we\r\nhave such plants as Aster tripolium, Glaux maritima, Plantago maritima,\r\nSalicornia herbacea, Salsola kali, Samolus valerandi, Scirpus maritimus,\r\nSuæda fruticosa, S. maritima, Triglochin maritimum, T. palustre, &c. It\r\nbecomes in this connection a subject of peculiar interest to the student\r\nof plant-distribution when he reads in Mr. Hemsley’s paper on the flora\r\nof Tibet (_Jour. Linn. Soc. Bot._, vol. 35) that amongst the British\r\nshore-plants above-named the two species of Triglochin and the same\r\nspecies of Glaux and Salsola occur in the salt marshes of the Tibetan\r\nuplands at elevations of 15,000 to 16,000 feet, Scirpus maritimus also\r\nbeing found in the swamps of the lower levels. We have the same thing,\r\naffecting much the same plants, illustrated in America. Thus we learn\r\nfrom Asa Gray that Salicornia herbacea, Scirpus maritimus, Triglochin\r\nmaritimum, &c., which are common in salt marshes on the coast of the\r\nUnited States, occur also in the interior of the continent in the\r\nvicinity of salt-springs.\r\n\r\nFacts of this sort are well known, and I merely refer to them here in\r\norder to emphasise the importance of this little group of British\r\nlittoral plants, those of the salt marsh. Their very wide distribution\r\nis connected with the frequent recurrence of suitable conditions, not\r\nonly in space, but what seems of greater import, also in time. One can\r\nscarcely doubt when the Saltwort (Salsola kali) is seen on the\r\nDevonshire coast, on a beach in Chile, and in the elevated regions of\r\nCentral Asia that here a very ancient type of plant finds its still more\r\nancient conditions of existence. In the capacity which most of the\r\nplants of the salt marsh possess of germinating in sea-water, this group\r\nof littoral plants is sharply distinguished, as far as my observations\r\nshow, from the other groups of British shore-plants. For instance, in my\r\nexperiments the seeds of Aster tripolium, Salicornia herbacea, and\r\nTriglochin maritimum germinated freely in sea-water, whilst those of\r\nSpergularia rubra, Cakile maritima, Convolvulus soldanella and others\r\nfailed to do so (see Note 19). It will also be noticed with respect to\r\nthis group of littoral plants that, except in the case of Scirpus\r\nmaritimus, the seeds or fruits have little or no floating power, the\r\nexception offered by Salsola kali being not very striking. This feature\r\nis brought out in the Table given in Note 10; but some of the details of\r\nmy observations are given in Note 17.\r\n\r\nThere yet remains a third group of the British shore-plants, namely,\r\nthat comprising the plants that rarely stray far from the beach and\r\noften possess seeds or seedvessels that will float for months. Here we\r\nhave such species as Arenaria (Honckeneya) peploides, Beta maritima,\r\nCakile maritima, Crambe maritima, Crithmum maritimum, Convolvulus\r\nsoldanella, Eryngium maritimum, Euphorbia paralias, Glaucium luteum,\r\nLathyrus maritimus, Polygonum maritimum, &c. The seeds or seedvessels of\r\nquite half of these species will float for months unharmed in sea-water,\r\nbut in a few, as with Cakile maritima and Eryngium maritimum, they float\r\nfor only a week or two, whilst in others again like Glaucium luteum they\r\nhave no buoyancy. (Some details of the buoyancy experiments on these\r\nplants are given in Note 18; and the long list in Note 10 may be first\r\nconsulted.)\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to enter here into more detail with respect to\r\nBritish shore-plants. Enough has been said to disclose cleavage-lines in\r\nwhat might have appeared as a homogeneous plant-formation. We can thus\r\ndiscern the elements of at least three groups amongst the plants of our\r\nbeaches, each group bearing the impress of an independent history:—\r\n\r\n(_a_) The plants of the beach and of the inland plain or of the distant\r\nmountain peak, excluding those of the salt marshes. Armeria vulgaris,\r\nSilene maritima, and Spergularia rubra may be taken as examples. The\r\ncurrents here as a rule take little or no part in their dispersal.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The “saline” group, including the plants of the saline plains and\r\nthe salt marshes of the interior of continents. Of these Glaux maritima,\r\nSalsola kali, and Triglochin maritimum are examples. The capacity of\r\ngerminating in sea-water is a distinguishing character of most of the\r\nplants; and but few of them possess seeds or seedvessels that are\r\nmarkedly buoyant.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The true beach plants that rarely stray far from the beach, of\r\nwhich Arenaria peploides, Cakile maritima, and Convolvulus soldanella\r\nare examples. Many of them have buoyant seeds or fruits capable of\r\ndispersion over wide areas through the agency of the currents.\r\n\r\nThe reader will be able to extend this subject for himself if he is so\r\ninclined, but we have gone far enough together to learn that the plants\r\nwith buoyant seeds or fruits are in the minority on our beaches,\r\nscarcely a third of the total being fitted for dispersal by the currents\r\nover broad tracts of sea. The British strand-flora thus differs\r\nstrikingly from the littoral flora of a Pacific island, or indeed of any\r\nordinary tropical coast, and in this respect it is to be regarded as\r\ntypical of the temperate regions. It has been remarked before that on a\r\nbeach in the tropics we would expect to find that quite three-fourths of\r\nthe plants are provided with buoyant fruits or seeds distributed far and\r\nwide over the tropical seas by the currents.\r\n\r\nWe pass on now to briefly discuss from the same standpoint the British\r\nplants that find their homes on the borders of rivers and ponds. It is\r\nhere that the hygrophytes with buoyant seeds or fruits gather together,\r\njust as the xerophytes with similar seeds or fruits collect on the\r\nbeaches. We have seen before that only a portion of the beach plants\r\nbelong to the buoyant group, and the same applies to the plants at the\r\nedges of rivers and ponds. The plant-formation is no more homogeneous\r\nthere than it is in the case of the strand-flora. Let us see if we can\r\ndiscern some lines of division there also, or in other words let us\r\nendeavour to connect the absence or presence of floating power in the\r\nfruits and seeds with some variations in the placing of the plants. We\r\nstill pursue the clue to the study of the complicated problems connected\r\nwith plant-stations by taking the floating seed as our guide.\r\n\r\nWe will carry ourselves in thought to the Thames-side between Teddington\r\nand Twickenham at the end of August, 1892. The river is at the\r\nhigh-water level, and we see flourishing at the margins, sometimes a\r\nlittle above the water and sometimes a little within its reach,\r\nRanunculus repens, R. sceleratus, Spiræa ulmaria, Lycopus europæus,\r\nScutellaria galericulata, different species of Rumex, Alnus glutinosa,\r\nIris pseudacorus, Sparganium ramosum, and different species of Carex,\r\nwith several other plants, all contributing their seeds or fruits to the\r\ndrift that floats in the river from the autumn to the spring.\r\n\r\nBut besides these plants there are a number more or less submerged in\r\nthe stream, including Nasturtium amphibium, N. sylvestre, Stellaria\r\naquatica, Myosotis palustris, and Veronica beccabunga; and as the water\r\nfalls other plants still more submerged come into view on the exposed\r\nflats, such as Nasturtium officinale, Apium nodiflorum, and Polygonum\r\nhydropiper. None of these plants are represented by their seeds or\r\nfruits in the floating river-drift. Several of them possess dry\r\ndehiscent fruits with small seeds, such as Nature ignores in the matter\r\nof buoyancy, and the small fruits of Myosotis, Apium, and Polygonum have\r\nlittle or no floating power.\r\n\r\nWe have thus here a clear dividing line between the plants with buoyant\r\nseeds or fruits that were more or less exposed above the high-water\r\nlevel, and those that were more or less submerged at that state of the\r\ntide. That which occurs in the Lower Thames twice in the day within the\r\nreach of the tide represents what happens in the higher part of the\r\nriver during the seasonal floods, but in the last case the effects\r\ncannot be so readily distinguished. We thus perceive that the buoyant\r\nseed or fruit is as a rule only characteristic of the plants of the\r\nriver-side that grow more or less exposed above the water, whilst those\r\nplants liable to periodic submergence have seeds or fruits that sink.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is of especial interest to observe that as a\r\ngeneral rule the truly aquatic plants of English rivers contribute\r\nlittle or nothing to the floating seed-drift. I pointed this out several\r\nyears ago, in my paper on the Thames, as an agent in plant-dispersal,\r\nand it has been already noticed in this work (page 30). We look in vain\r\namongst the floating winter drift of our rivers for the seeds or fruits\r\nof Ranunculus aquatilis, Nuphar luteum, Nymphæa alba, and of the species\r\nof Myriophyllum, Limnanthemum, Callitriche, Ceratophyllum, Zannichellia,\r\nand of several of the Potamogetons, all of which give character in\r\nsummer to the aquatic vegetation of the river. In their place we find\r\nonly the seeds and fruits of the plants growing on the banks.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another small group of river plants, which in their\r\nstructure and habits and in the behaviour of their floating fruits come\r\nbetween the true aquatics and the plants of the river-banks. They belong\r\nmostly to the Alisma family, and Alisma plantago and Sagittaria\r\nsagittifolia may here be specially mentioned. Their fruits display great\r\nvariation in their floating power; and on this point M. Kolpin-Ravn,\r\nwriting to me in 1895, made the following interesting suggestion, that\r\nsince these plants approach true aquatics in structure they may be also\r\nregarded as approaching them in the inconstancy of the buoyant capacity\r\nof their fruits, those of aquatics having typically little or no\r\nfloating power.\r\n\r\nSeed-buoyancy, however, does not play quite such an important part in\r\nthe plant-economy of a river as the examination of the floating drift\r\nwould lead one to expect. Only a portion of the bank-plants have buoyant\r\nseeds or fruits, whilst amongst the true aquatics, the semi-aquatics,\r\nand the plants periodically submerged, the rule of non-buoyancy\r\nprevails. And, indeed, when we look at all the possible stations for the\r\nplants of the British flora, we discover that seed-buoyancy can rarely\r\nbe connected with station. It is, however, in those few stations that\r\nplants with buoyant seeds have mainly gathered. There it is, probably,\r\nthat the remnants of a past floral age find a refuge, since it would\r\nseem likely that the tendency has been in the course of geological time\r\nfor the development of dry stations for plants at the expense of the wet\r\nstations.\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of some of the points discussed in this\r\nchapter:—\r\n\r\n(1) In the case of the strand-flora of a Pacific island, and indeed in\r\nthat of an ordinary tropical region, the large proportion of plants with\r\nbuoyant seeds or fruits tends to mask all other issues, and we are\r\nseemingly only concerned with dispersal by currents.\r\n\r\n(2) But in the British strand-flora where plants with buoyant seeds and\r\nfruits are in a minority, constituting less than a third of the total,\r\nit is seen that the issue is primarily an affair of station, an\r\ninference that may be applied generally to temperate regions.\r\n\r\n(3) All British shore-plants may be regarded as owning certain\r\ncharacters in common which may be collectively designated the\r\nxerophilous habit, and we may extend this view to other temperate\r\nstrand-floras.\r\n\r\n(4) But this xerophilous habit is also characteristic of inland plants\r\nin certain localities, as of those of the steppe, the desert, the rocky\r\nmountain-top, and of other exposed situations, in all of which checks to\r\nthe loss of water by transpiration are required. Whilst the risks of\r\ndrought are thus guarded against in the case of plants stationed in arid\r\nlocalities, the risk of injury to the plant from the accumulation of\r\nsalt in the tissues is obviated in the instance of the plants of the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\n(5) On the other side we have the hygrophilous habit characteristic of\r\nplants living under conditions where checks to transpiration are\r\nrelatively little needed. All the plants of the margins of rivers and\r\nponds belong here, and indeed all plants living under moist conditions.\r\n\r\n(6) This distinction between the xerophilous and hygrophilous habits\r\npenetrates deeply into all questions connected with stations, and lies\r\nbehind all matters relating to the buoyancy of seeds or fruits. It is\r\nthe fitness or unfitness of a plant for living in dry situations that\r\nprimarily determines the station. If a xerophilous plant has a buoyant\r\nseed or seedvessel it finds its way ultimately to the coast; if it is\r\nhygrophilous and its seeds or fruits can float, then it is finally\r\nestablished on the side of a pond or river.\r\n\r\n(7) The composite character of the British strand-flora is to be\r\nexplained on the above principles. We have in the first place the plants\r\nconfined to the sandy beach, many of which possessing buoyant seeds or\r\nfruits are dispersed by the currents. Next come the plants of the sandy\r\nbeach which are found also far inland in open plains and on\r\nmountain-tops; and afterwards come the plants of the salt-marsh and\r\nmud-flats of the coast, which appear again in the saline plains and\r\nswamps in the interior of the continents.\r\n\r\n(8) The plant-formation of the river’s border displays also lines of\r\ndivision, and is by no means homogeneous; and indeed other factors\r\nbesides those connected with seed-buoyancy have here been in operation.\r\n\r\n(9) In only a few of the possible stations of British plants can a\r\ndirect connection be traced with seed-buoyancy. Yet it is at these few\r\nstations, such as at the coast and by the pond or river, that the plants\r\nwith buoyant seeds and fruits have mainly gathered.\r\n\r\n(10) The plants now frequenting wet stations may often be regarded as\r\nthe remains of an age when moist conditions for plant-life prevailed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                        THE FIJIAN STRAND-FLORA\r\n\r\nThe inland extension of the beach plants.—The grouping of the coast\r\n  plants.—Their modes of dispersal.—The zone of change.—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAVING learned from the British flora the real significance of the\r\nbuoyant seed or fruit in a littoral flora, we will now return to the\r\nPacific and proceed to deal with the composition and general character\r\nof the strand-plants.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Malayan strand-plants, Professor Schimper remarks (pp.\r\n11, 12) that both in outward appearance and in anatomical structure they\r\nare xerophilous in character, whether in the case of those of the\r\nmangrove-swamp or in those of the beach. Since the tropical shore-flora\r\nof the Pacific islands is essentially Malayan, the identity usually\r\nextending to the species, the same conclusion may be applied to its\r\ncharacter. The xerophilous habit may show itself externally in a variety\r\nof ways, as in hairiness, leaf-structure, a leathery cuticle,\r\nsucculency, &c.\r\n\r\nFrom this xerophilous habit of the Pacific strand-flora we should expect\r\nto find that many of the plants stray far from the coast, wherever the\r\nsuitable conditions for their type of organisation occur, whether in the\r\ninland plain or on the mountain-top. This is indeed the case; but in\r\ndealing with this subject it will be necessary to discuss in some\r\ngeneral detail the littoral floras of the Fijian, Hawaiian, and Tahitian\r\ngroups in succession.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE FIJIAN STRAND-FLORA\r\n\r\n                THE INLAND EXTENSION OF THE BEACH PLANTS\r\n\r\nViewed from the old standpoint of “station,” where one would distinguish\r\nsharply between the coast and the inland plants, the Fijian strand-flora\r\nexhibits a number of inconsistencies, all at first sight extremely\r\npuzzling. When, however, we regard their xerophilous character and\r\nreflect that this habit, and not mere fitness for growing at the coast,\r\nis the primary determining factor of their station, much that is strange\r\nappears normal and plain.\r\n\r\nLet me refer in this connection to the impression that the distribution\r\nof the Fijian shore-plants made on Mr. Horne, the director of the\r\nBotanic Gardens of Mauritius, who spent a year in the botanical\r\ninvestigation of the group about a quarter of a century ago. In his\r\naccount of the group (pp. 59, 60) he says that several of “what are\r\nknown as sea-shore plants” are found far in the interior of the larger\r\nislands; and amongst others he names such characteristic beach plants as\r\nCerbera Odollam, Hibiscus tiliaceus, Ipomœa pes capræ, and Pandanus\r\nodoratissimus. On the other hand, he remarks that several species of\r\ninland plants occur at the coast, and that several plants growing on the\r\nmountain-tops are found near the sea. This apparent confusion of station\r\nhe seems to attribute to the circumstance that the mountains of Fiji are\r\nnot high enough for the development of an alpine flora. But such a view\r\ncould not be held now, since the effect of an alpine flora would be the\r\nintroduction of further elements of confusion in the occasional\r\noccurrence of some of the alpine plants on the sea-coast, as we find in\r\nHawaii.\r\n\r\nYet this apparent mingling of the littoral and inland floras in Fiji\r\nbecomes intelligible when we perceive that the seeming confusion of\r\nstation is mainly restricted to the xerophilous plants of the arid\r\ninland plains and of the bare mountain-tops. The rank humid forests that\r\ncover so much of the interior of the islands, and the luxuriant\r\nvegetation of the mountain-gorges, are not here concerned. Such a\r\nmingling occurs it is true under certain conditions; but in the general\r\nphysiognomy of the flora the distinction between the shore and inland\r\nplants holds good. The same shore plants that are distributed far and\r\nwide over the Pacific here present themselves; and although some of them\r\nextend far inland, where the scantily-vegetated plains descend to the\r\ncoast, this does not deprive them of the right of being still regarded\r\nas littoral plants.\r\n\r\nStill, when we look at a fairly complete list of the shore-plants of\r\nFiji, numbering in all about eighty, we perceive that about two-thirds\r\nof them also occur inland, either in Fiji or in some other tropical\r\nregion; and if we reflect that many of the residue are plants of the\r\nmangroves that would not be found inland except under estuarine\r\nconditions, it becomes evident that with this reservation there are very\r\nfew littoral plants in Fiji that do not at times leave the coast.\r\n\r\nCæsalpinia Bonducella may be taken as a type of those shore-plants that\r\nstray far away from the coast, even into the interior of continents,\r\nsince in India it reaches the Himalayas. Although Terminalia Katappa and\r\nCalophyllum Inophyllum often owe their existence inland in different\r\nparts of the tropics to man’s agency, this cannot be said of most\r\nothers, as Cassytha filiformis, Casuarina equisetifolia, Cycas\r\ncircinalis, Ipomœa pes capræ, Pandanus odoratissimus, Premna tahitensis,\r\nTacca pinnatifida, Tephrosia piscatoria, Vitex trifolia, &c., when they\r\noccupy the extensive inland plains that slope to the coasts on the lee\r\nsides of the large islands of Fiji. Plants, like Hibiscus tiliaceus, are\r\nfound in a Pacific island almost as frequently away from the beach as on\r\nthe beach itself; and this is true of most other regions of the tropics\r\nwhere it occurs.\r\n\r\nOther plants that appear to be altogether confined to the sandy beach in\r\nFiji, break away on rare occasions from their usual station and appear\r\non the bare rocky summits of hills near the coast, even though the\r\nhill-slopes are densely wooded. On such bare hilltops in Vanua Levu,\r\nvarying from 500 to 1,100 feet in elevation, one is surprised at times\r\nto find shore creepers and climbers like Canavalia obtusifolia and\r\nDerris uliginosa associated with other beach-plants more frequently\r\nfound inland, such as Tephrosia piscatoria and Vitex trifolia, and in\r\nthe company of climbing species of Morinda and of small trees of Fagræa\r\nBerteriana. When the “talasinga” (sun-burnt) districts, as the Fijians\r\nterm the plains on the north sides of the islands, extend a long\r\ndistance from the coast into the heart of the island, they carry with\r\nthem their peculiar vegetation and the intruding beach-plants up to\r\nconsiderable elevations above the sea. We then find familiar\r\nbeach-plants like Cerbera Odollam and Ipomœa pes capræ growing far\r\ninland at heights of 1,000 feet and over above the sea. (See Notes 20\r\nand 21.)\r\n\r\nOne is never quite sure of the behaviour of shore-plants in Fiji when\r\nthe “talasinga” plains lie behind the beach, since even Scævola Kœnigii,\r\nusually a steadfast beach-plant, occurs at times some miles inland. (See\r\nNotes 20 and 55.) There are, however, a few that never came under my\r\nnotice inland, such as Pemphis acidula, Triumfetta procumbens, and\r\nTournefortia argentea. The extension of sea-coast plants for any\r\ndistance inland depends a good deal on the occurrence of\r\nscantily-vegetated plains, or of scrub-covered, rolling country at the\r\nback of the beaches; and doubtless that which I have described in the\r\ncase of Fiji is to be found in other tropical coast-regions. Professor\r\nSchimper informed me by letter that he had noticed a similar inland\r\nextension of the shore-plants in the Seychelles.... I have only here\r\ntouched on this subject. In Notes 20 and 21 the reader will find further\r\ndetails of the inland extension of the beach-plants, and in Note 22 is\r\ngiven a general account of the “talasinga” plains, in which the\r\nwandering beach-plants mingle with the peculiar vegetation of the plains\r\nthemselves. Covered with reeds and bracken, and dotted over with clumps\r\nof Casuarinas and Acacias, with the Cycad and Pandanus distributed\r\nirregularly over their surfaces, such level districts possess, as\r\nremarked by Seemann, a South Australian look.\r\n\r\n\r\n              THE GROUPING OF THE FIJIAN LITTORAL PLANTS.\r\n\r\nThe littoral plants readily divide themselves into three principal\r\ngroups as concerning their station, namely:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The “beach-formation,” typically exhibited on the whitish\r\ncalcareous beaches of reef-bound coasts.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The “mangrove-formation,” found at intervals all along the coasts,\r\nbut most fully developed at the estuaries, and for the most part\r\noccupying flats regularly overflown by the tide.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The “intermediate formation,” comprising the plants of the tracts\r\nbetween the beach and the mangrove-swamp and at the borders of the\r\nswamps.\r\n\r\nThis grouping does not differ materially from that adopted by Professor\r\nSchimper in the instance of the Indo-Malayan strand-flora. (See Note\r\n23.)\r\n\r\nTo the beach-formation belong, amongst the trees and shrubs,\r\nBarringtonia speciosa, Calophyllum Inophyllum, Guettarda speciosa,\r\nPemphis acidula, Scævola Kœnigii, Tournefortia argentea, &c., and\r\namongst the creepers and procumbent plants, Canavalia obtusifolia,\r\nIpomœa pes capræ, Triumfetta procumbens, &c. To the mangrove-formation\r\nbelong the Asiatic and the American species of Rhizophora, and species\r\nof Bruguiera, Carapa, Lumnitzera, &c. Amongst the trees that gather\r\naround the borders of the mangrove-swamp, constituting the intermediate\r\nformation, occur Barringtonia racemosa, Excæcaria Agallocha, Heritiera\r\nlittoralis, Hibiscus tiliaceus, and several other species, all of them\r\nbeing equally at home on the sandy beach, at the border of a\r\nmangrove-swamp, and on the banks of an estuary. The climbers, such as\r\nEntada scandens, Mucuna gigantea, Derris uliginosa, &c., belong more to\r\nthe mangrove and to the intermediate formations than they do to that of\r\nthe beach. Referring the reader to the more complete lists given in Note\r\n24, I may remark that it is not always possible to distinguish sharply\r\nbetween the three formations, since some of the plants belong to two,\r\nand a tree like Cerbera Odollam may, in different localities, be\r\nreferred to all three formations. The general distinction, however,\r\nprevails in the physiognomy of the coast-flora.\r\n\r\nThe mangrove-formation comprises, it may be pointed out, many plants\r\nother than mangroves, plants that find a home in the mangrove-swamps of\r\nFiji, either within their limits or at their borders. It presents,\r\nindeed, a world in itself. When the mangroves establish themselves in a\r\nnew locality they carry along with them a host of hangers-on, both\r\nplants and animals, that only find a home under the favourable\r\nconditions of a mangrove-swamp. Thus, the absence of the\r\nmangrove-formation from a Pacific island deprives its littoral flora of\r\nmany very striking features. For this reason the Tahitian shore-flora\r\nmust seem to a botanist coming from Fiji comparatively tame and\r\nmonotonous; whilst that of Hawaii, for this and for other reasons to be\r\nsubsequently mentioned, is still less interesting, and scarcely even\r\ngives a character to the coasts.\r\n\r\nWe are now, therefore, prepared to learn that a large number of the\r\nplants other than true mangroves, that thrive in or around the Fijian\r\nmangrove-swamp, are not to be found in those Polynesian islands where\r\ntrue mangroves do not exist; and that a law of association here exists.\r\nMany of the plants of the intermediate formation are so closely bound up\r\nwith the mangroves in their life-conditions that they are not to be\r\nfound where the mangroves are absent, even though their seeds or fruits\r\nare pre-eminently fitted for dispersal by the currents. The influence of\r\n“station” here rules supreme. This matter will be treated more in detail\r\nwhen discussing the Tahitian and Hawaiian strand-floras in Chapters VI.\r\nand VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n          THE MODES OF DISPERSAL OF THE FIJIAN STRAND-PLANTS.\r\n\r\nThe predominant influence of the currents having been already\r\nestablished, there remains for consideration the distribution of the\r\nfloating capacity of the seeds or fruits among the different formations.\r\nOne can say that almost without exception the seeds or fruits or\r\nseedlings of the mangrove and intermediate formations float for long\r\nperiods. In the case of some of the true mangroves, as in Rhizophora and\r\nin Bruguiera, where germination takes place on the tree, it is the\r\nseedling that floats, whilst in others, as in Carapa and Lumnitzera, it\r\nis the seedvessel that floats. The plants with non-buoyant seeds or\r\nfruits that belong to the littoral flora are all confined to the beach\r\nformation, but they do not form more than a sixth of the total. Almost\r\nall the “good floaters” of the beach-plants are widely spread over the\r\nshores of the Pacific and of much of the tropics, and include such\r\nfamiliar species as Barringtonia speciosa, Cæsalpinia Bonducella,\r\nTerminalia Katappa, and many others mentioned in the lists of Notes 2\r\nand 24.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, we come to the dozen or so of beach-plants that possess\r\nseeds or fruits with little or no floating power, we find that several\r\nof them have a limited distribution in the Pacific, such as Acacia\r\nlaurifolia, Drymispermum Burnettianum, Eugenia Richii, &c., whilst\r\nothers, such as Casuarina equisetifolia, Tephrosia piscatoria,\r\nTriumfetta procumbens, and Wikstrœmia fœtida, are widely spread. This\r\nsmall non-buoyant group of the beach-plants has a nondescript\r\nappearance, and it is here that the inland flora is most likely to make\r\nits influence felt by additions to the number. It is here indeed that\r\nthe littoral floras of the tropics mostly differ, the accessions from\r\nthe inland flora varying in each region. It is in fact the zone of\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nA number of these plants, such as the species of Drymispermum, Eugenia,\r\nand Wikstrœmia, have probably been dispersed by frugivorous birds;\r\nwhilst others, like Triumfetta procumbens, possess fruits that might\r\nhave been transported in birds’ plumage. From the frequency with which\r\nTephrosia piscatoria is associated on hilltops in Fiji with Fagræa\r\nBerteriana and climbing species of Morinda that are well suited for\r\ndispersal by frugivorous birds, it seems likely that it is also\r\ndistributed by birds fond of a drier diet. It is possible that the\r\nPolynesians, who much value the wood of Casuarina equisetifolia, have\r\noften assisted in dispersing the tree.\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the contents of the chapter.\r\n\r\n(1) The extension inland of the Fijian strand-flora is to be attributed\r\nto the xerophilous organisation of the plants, and to the exceptionally\r\nfavourable conditions that are offered to such plants on the plains, and\r\nin other scantily vegetated localities, lying usually on the drier sides\r\nof the larger islands.\r\n\r\n(2) Excluding the mangroves and the plants associated with them in the\r\ncoast-swamps, there are few littoral plants of the islands of the\r\ntropical Pacific that do not extend inland in one region or another.\r\n\r\n(3) The Fijian shore-plants can be rudely arranged in three groups,\r\nthose of the mangrove-swamp, those of the sandy beach, and those of the\r\nintermediate districts, the last including those plants that occur\r\ntypically at the borders of a mangrove-swamp, though some of them can\r\nthrive equally well on a beach.\r\n\r\n(4) There is a law of association connecting many plants with a\r\nmangrove-swamp in such a manner that when the true mangroves are not\r\nrepresented in a Polynesian group, as in Tahiti or in Hawaii, the plants\r\nin question are also absent, notwithstanding that in many cases, such as\r\nthose of Clerodendron inerme and Heritiera littoralis, they possess\r\nseeds or seedvessels of great floating power.\r\n\r\n(5) The fruits or seeds or seedlings, as the case may be, of the plants\r\nof the mangrove-swamp and of the bordering districts float almost\r\nwithout exception for long periods. This is true also of five-sixths of\r\nthe beach-plants, whilst the remainder owe their dispersal chiefly to\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\n(6) The small non-buoyant group of the beach-plants represents that\r\nportion of the strand-flora that is most likely to be recruited from the\r\ninland flora. It is here that exists the zone of change; and it is in\r\nthis respect that the littoral floras of the tropics differ principally\r\namongst each other, the recruits from inland varying naturally with the\r\nfloras of different regions.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThough it does not come within my plan to discuss the littoral floras\r\nof the adjacent smaller groups of Tonga and Samoa, it may be remarked\r\nthat they reflect most of the principal features of the strand-flora\r\nof Fiji. In particular it may be observed that they possess the\r\nmangrove-formation, but to a more limited extent. Both own the\r\nmangrove genera Rhizophora and Bruguiera, whilst Carapa is also found\r\nin Tonga. The intermediate formation is represented in Tonga by\r\nClerodendron inerme, Excæcaria Agallocha, and Heritiera littoralis;\r\nwhilst in Samoa we find, besides the first-named species, Barringtonia\r\nracemosa and Scirpodendron costatum. In both the beach-formation is\r\nwell represented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                       THE TAHITIAN STRAND-FLORA\r\n\r\n  (_From materials supplied mainly by the work of Drake del Castillo_)\r\n\r\nLacks the mangroves and their associated plants.—Possesses mainly the\r\n  plants of the coral beach.—Predominant agency of the currents.—Inland\r\n  extension of shore-plants.—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUST as the littoral plants of Fiji may be regarded as typical of\r\nWestern Polynesia, so the strand-flora of Tahiti, or, rather, of the\r\nTahitian Islands, may be considered as representing Eastern Polynesia.\r\nWe have thus the Tahitian area, comprising generally the Cook and\r\nAustral Groups, the Society Islands, the Paumotus, and also the\r\nMarquesas, as contrasted with the Fijian area, including the\r\nneighbouring Samoan and Tongan groups. For the sake of brevity the terms\r\nFiji and Tahiti are often used as equivalents of the entire areas (see\r\nNote 25).\r\n\r\nThe littoral flora of this part of the Pacific lacks the mangroves and\r\nmost of the plants that are associated in the Fijian region with a\r\nmangrove-swamp, either at its borders or within its interior. Thus we\r\nmiss here the true mangroves of the genera Rhizophora, Bruguiera,\r\nCarapa, and Lumnitzera, as well as the accompanying trees and shrubs,\r\nsuch as Barringtonia racemosa, Excæcaria Agallocha, and Heritiera\r\nlittoralis. The climbers and straggling plants that are so\r\ncharacteristic of the borders of the mangrove-creeks in Fiji proper are\r\nalso wanting, such as Clerodendron inerme, Derris uliginosa, and Smythea\r\npacifica; and we do not find in the Tahitian region the Giant-Sedge\r\n(Scirpodendron costatum) that is so common in the mangrove-swamps of\r\nFiji, and occurs also in Samoa.\r\n\r\nIt is not at first sight easy to account for the absence from Tahiti of\r\nthe mangrove-formation and of so many of the plants that grow at the\r\nborders of a mangrove-swamp in Fiji. Their absence can scarcely be due\r\nto the want of suitable stations, as is indicated by the common\r\noccurrence in the Tahitian coast-marshes of Chrysodium aureum, the Great\r\nSwamp-fern, that not only abounds in the mangrove belts of Fiji, Tonga,\r\nand Samoa, but is associated with mangrove-swamps over much of the\r\ntropical zone. Nor can it be said that the currents are ineffective, or\r\nthat the seeds or fruits of the missing plants possess, as a rule,\r\ninsufficient floating powers. Most of the plants of the Tahitian beaches\r\nhail, like those of Fiji, from Malaya, and have been brought through the\r\nagency of the currents; and many of the absent littoral plants that have\r\nthe same home, such as Heritiera littoralis and Clerodendron inerme,\r\nhave fruits or seeds just as capable of floating unharmed over the same\r\nextent of ocean. It is not any defect in floating-power that has\r\nprevented the establishment of two such plants in the Tahitian area.\r\nEntada scandens, which in some parts of the world is a typical climber\r\nof the mangrove-formation, and in other places thrives well in the\r\nabsence of mangrove-swamps, has only been recorded from Rarotonga in\r\nthis region by botanists, but I believe Wyatt Gill refers to its\r\noccurrence in Mangaia in one of his books.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is likely that the floating seedlings of\r\nRhizophora and Bruguiera, which represent the only means of dispersal by\r\nthe currents at the service of these mangroves, would not arrive at\r\nTahiti in a condition favourable for the establishment of the plants. My\r\nobservations, which are described in Chapter XXX., go to show that,\r\nthough the seedlings will float uninjured in still sea-water for months,\r\nthey will not withstand prolonged sea-buffeting. These two genera of\r\nmangroves, it is most important to remember, supply the pioneers and the\r\nprincipal components of a mangrove-swamp in the Western Pacific. Where\r\nthey fail to establish themselves, the requisite conditions for the\r\nlarge number of plants and animals that find their home in and around a\r\nmangrove-swamp would not be provided. We thus perceive that the absence\r\nfrom the Tahitian coast flora of several plants that are associated in\r\nFiji with the mangrove-swamps depends on a law of association, which has\r\nalready been referred to in the preceding chapter, and is not concerned\r\nwith incapacity for dispersal by currents (see Note 26).\r\n\r\nWhilst the Tahitian coast flora does not, therefore, possess the plants\r\nof the mangrove-swamp and its vicinity, it includes most of the typical\r\nbeach-trees of the coral islands and reef-fronted coasts of other parts\r\nof the South Pacific. Thus we find here on the sandy beaches\r\nBarringtonia speciosa, Calophyllum Inophyllum, Cerbera Odollam,\r\nHernandia peltata, Guettarda speciosa, and numerous other plants that\r\nare indicated by the letter T in the list of Fijian littoral plants\r\ngiven in Note 2. The total number of Tahitian shore-plants is thus\r\nconsiderably less than that of Fiji (there are about 55 in Tahiti and\r\nabout 80 in Fiji); but in its turn, as will subsequently be shown, it is\r\nmuch larger than that of Hawaii, where the number is about 30.\r\n\r\nQuite three-fourths of the strand-flora of this region have buoyant\r\nseeds or seedvessels capable of floating for long periods; and there is\r\nno difficulty in assigning by far the greater share in the stocking of\r\nthe beaches with their plants to the agency of the currents. The\r\ncurrents in their operations have indeed carried the fruits or seeds of\r\nmany of these plants across the South Pacific as far as the islands\r\nextend, namely, to Ducie Island and to Easter Island. There are few more\r\nsignificant proofs of the efficacy of the currents in distributing\r\nplants over the Pacific than the discovery, by Mr. Arundel, of\r\nBarringtonia speciosa in Ducie Island in association with Tournefortia\r\nargentea (Challenger, Botany, III. 116).\r\n\r\nThe residue of the Tahitian coast flora possessing fruits or seeds that\r\nare unsuited for dispersal by currents includes such plants as\r\nHeliotropium anomalum, Triumfetta procumbens, Tephrosia piscatoria,\r\nWikstrœmia fœtida, &c. The small nucules of the first-named are perhaps\r\ndispersed by granivorous birds; the fruits of Triumfetta are probably\r\ntransported in birds’ plumage; those of Wikstrœmia are distributed by\r\nfrugivorous birds; and the seeds of Tephrosia may be dispersed like\r\nthose of Heliotropium.\r\n\r\nThe recruits or intruders from the inland flora do not appear to be\r\nnumerous or to give any special character to the shore flora. (See Note\r\n27.)\r\n\r\nFrom not having a personal acquaintance with this region it is not\r\npossible for me to discuss the extension of the shore-plants inland\r\nexcept in a general way. From the pages of the work of Drake del\r\nCastillo we can, however, infer that several plants such as Cassytha\r\nfiliformis, Cerbera Odollam, Colubrina asiatica, Hernandia peltata,\r\nMorinda citrifolia, and Pandanus odoratissimus have extended inland to\r\nthe mouths of the Tahitian valleys, and have ascended the lower slopes\r\nof the hills that lie near the coast. Others, like Cæsalpinia Bonduc,\r\nGyrocarpus Jacquini, and Ochrosia parviflora, have climbed far up the\r\nmountain-sides to elevations of from 2,000 to 2,400 feet above the sea.\r\nIt is also evident from Mr. Cheeseman’s memoir on the Rarotongan flora\r\nthat coast plants also stray inland in that island. In an island like\r\nRarotonga, where a sorry substitute for a mangrove-swamp exists in the\r\nform of a few coastal muddy places occupied by Vitex trifolia and\r\nSesuvium Portulacastrum, Entada scandens takes to the hills; and thus it\r\nis that in this island it is most abundant in the interior, climbing to\r\nthe tops of the highest trees and “covering acres of the forest with a\r\ndense canopy of green.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Summary of the Chapter._\r\n\r\n(1) The Tahitian region possesses most of the plants that frequent the\r\nsandy beaches of the Pacific islands.\r\n\r\n(2) But it lacks the mangroves and the associated plants of the\r\nmangrove-swamp.\r\n\r\n(3) It also wants many of the plants that grow in the vicinity of such\r\nswamps.\r\n\r\n(4) But since the plants last-mentioned often possess fruits or seeds\r\ncapable of being carried great distances by the currents, their absence\r\nis to be attributed to the necessary conditions being lacking on account\r\nof the failure of the mangroves.\r\n\r\n(5) Most of the beach plants, however, owe their existence in this\r\nregion to the transport of their buoyant fruits or seeds by the\r\ncurrents.\r\n\r\n(6) The negative features of the Tahitian strand-flora are mostly to be\r\nconnected with the absence of Rhizophora and Bruguiera, the pioneers of\r\nthe mangrove-swamp; and their absence is, in turn, to be attributed to\r\nthe inability of their floating seedlings to reach this region in a fit\r\ncondition for establishing themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                       THE HAWAIIAN STRAND-FLORA\r\n\r\nIts poverty.—Its negative features.—Their explanation.—The subordinate\r\n  part taken by the currents.—The Oregon drift.—The inland extension of\r\n  the beach plants.—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARED with the rich strand-flora of Fiji, that of Hawaii presents but\r\na sorry aspect. In the number of species (30) it does not amount to\r\nhalf; whilst it lacks the great mangrove-formation and the luxuriant\r\nvegetation accompanying it that gives so much character to the shores\r\nand estuaries of Fiji. Strangely enough, it is also deprived of most of\r\nthe familiar trees that, whether in foliage, in flower, or in fruit,\r\nform the chief attraction of the sandy beaches of the Pacific islands.\r\n\r\nNeither the mangroves, therefore, nor the plants of the intermediate\r\nformation, are to be found in Hawaii; and when we reflect that the\r\nabsentees from the beach formation include most of the trees, under the\r\nshade of which the visitor to the Pacific islands can nearly always find\r\nprotection from the fierce rays of a tropical sun, it cannot be a matter\r\nof surprise that this littoral flora has such a poverty-stricken\r\nappearance. We look in vain for such shady beach trees as Barringtonia\r\nspeciosa, Terminalia Katappa, and Hernandia peltata; and we are lucky if\r\nwe find some small trees under which we can obtain a scanty shade.\r\n\r\nI have been speaking, of course, of the indigenous shore-plants, those\r\nthat have arrived at these islands without the assistance of man. Yet it\r\nmust be added that the existing littoral flora does include some of the\r\nmissing indigenous trees, though rarely in any number. There is,\r\nhowever, scarcely one of them that is regarded by Dr. Hillebrand as\r\nhaving formed part of the original flora. That botanist would indeed rob\r\nthe present beach flora, scanty as it is, of most of its conspicuous\r\nplants, as far as their claims to be considered indigenous are\r\nconcerned. Dr. Hillebrand indeed includes Calophyllum Inophyllum,\r\nHibiscus tiliaceus, Thespesia populnea, Morinda citrifolia, Cordia\r\nsubcordata, and Pandanus odoratissimus in the present Hawaiian flora,\r\nand nearly all of them are to be found at times at the coast as well as\r\ninland; but he regards all, excepting the last-named, as having been\r\nintroduced by the aborigines. I was not inclined at first to go quite so\r\nfar as Dr. Hillebrand in this direction; but he carefully considered the\r\ncase of each individual plant, and, remembering his sojourn of twenty\r\nyears in the islands, his authority cannot be lightly put aside. In the\r\nlist of Hawaiian strand-plants given in Note 28 there are several\r\nspecies not always littoral in the group, but typically littoral in\r\nother tropical regions. One species, Ipomœa glaberrima, Boj., has not\r\nbeen recorded before from these islands.\r\n\r\nA strong reason in favour of the contention of this botanist is that all\r\nthe trees above-named are useful in some way to the natives; and,\r\nindeed, when we look at the works dealing with the floras of the islands\r\nof the South Pacific, we observe that in almost all the groups one or\r\nother of these six trees bears the reputation of having been introduced\r\nby the aborigines. All of them in their turn lose their fame as truly\r\nindigenous plants in some group or other. The occurrence of two or three\r\nuseless South Pacific beach trees, that are known to be dispersed by the\r\ncurrents, in the indigenous strand-flora of Hawaii, would go far to\r\ninvalidate Dr. Hillebrand’s argument, since the six trees in dispute are\r\nalso known to be dispersed by the currents. But such trees are not to be\r\nfound; and we look in vain for trees like Cerbera Odollam, Guettarda\r\nspeciosa, Gyrocarpus Jacquini, and Hernandia peltata, that are spread\r\nfar and wide over the beaches of the South Pacific.\r\n\r\nIt is also of interest to notice how trees like Morinda citrifolia and\r\nTerminalia Katappa, concerning the non-indigenous character of which\r\nthere can be but little doubt, are in our own day acquiring a littoral\r\nstation. The second is not even regarded by Dr. Hillebrand as having\r\nbeen introduced by the natives, but is referred by him to the European\r\nepoch. After having been extensively planted, it is now, as I found,\r\nbecoming a littoral tree on the coast of Oahu, and supplies its buoyant\r\nfruits in a regular way to the beach drift. Its native name of Kamani is\r\nmerely that of Calophyllum Inophyllum. All the six trees in dispute are\r\nknown in Hawaii by the names by which they are distinguished far and\r\nwide over the South Pacific, a fact of which the reader may satisfy\r\nhimself by referring to my paper on Polynesian plant-names. The\r\nHawaiians, when their ancestors abode in the South Pacific, must have\r\nbeen well acquainted with one or other of the prevailing names of\r\nTerminalia Katappa (Talie, Tara, &c.); but it had lapsed in the memory\r\nof the race when the Europeans introduced the tree into Hawaii.\r\n\r\nIt may be added in this connection that Dr. Hillebrand weakens his\r\nargument by regarding Pandanus odoratissimus as of pre-aboriginal origin\r\nor as truly indigenous. Like the other six trees in question, its fruits\r\nare known to be capable of dispersal far and wide by the currents; and\r\nif this species of Pandanus is indigenous, we are obliged to assume that\r\nits fruits were first brought by the currents. That being so, we cannot\r\nexclude the probability of the currents having been also effective with\r\nseveral of the other plants regarded by Hillebrand as of aboriginal\r\nintroduction, more especially those with large fruits like Calophyllum\r\nInophyllum, and Cordia subcordata, where the alternative agency of\r\nfrugivorous birds would be impracticable, at least over a wide extent of\r\nocean. Pandanus odoratissimus is, as I venture to think, a tree that was\r\nintroduced ages since by the aborigines. Next to the Coco palm, few\r\ntrees have been more utilised by island-peoples, more particularly\r\nperhaps in the ruder stages of their history.\r\n\r\nThis point has been discussed at some length, because on the correctness\r\nof Dr. Hillebrand’s view depends the explanation to be subsequently\r\ngiven of the origin of the shore-flora of Hawaii. Though differing in\r\nsome details, my observations on the Hawaiian coast plants, which are\r\ngiven in Note 29, tend to strengthen his contention.\r\n\r\nI now return to the consideration of some of the negative features of\r\nthe Hawaiian strand-flora, and will allude first to the absence of the\r\nmangroves and of the numerous other plants that live in and around a\r\nmangrove-swamp. This cannot be connected with a total absence of\r\nsuitable stations. Although it is true that there are but few large\r\nrivers and but few suitable localities, yet such localities exist. The\r\nshores of Hilo Bay might readily have been the home of a mangrove-swamp;\r\nand one can point to different places on the coast of Oahu, such, for\r\ninstance, as Pearl Harbour, which in Fiji would have been occupied by a\r\nluxuriant growth of mangroves. The same argument applies to the missing\r\nbeach trees, such as Barringtonia speciosa, Hernandia peltata, Guettarda\r\nspeciosa, &c., that adorn the beaches of many a coral island or of many\r\na coral-bound coast in the South Pacific. Although in a large island\r\nlike Hawaii with its lava-bound coasts but few white calcareous beaches\r\nexist where we might expect to find such a flora, yet such beaches occur\r\nwherever the scanty coral reefs are found off the coast; and it is just\r\nin those localities, as is pointed out in the account of my observations\r\nin Note 29, that the “plantes madréporiques” of the French botanists,\r\nthe plants of the coral atoll and of the reef-girt coast, make their\r\nbest endeavours to establish themselves. In other islands like Oahu,\r\nwhere coral reefs are more developed, calcareous beaches are more\r\nfrequent, and there the few “madreporic” plants of Hawaii make a home.\r\n\r\nNor can the deficiencies in the Hawaiian strand-flora be connected with\r\nclimatic conditions. That its meagre character cannot be so explained is\r\nindicated by the manner in which the Indo-Malayan shore-plants have\r\npushed their way northward on the western side of the Pacific to the\r\nLiukiu and Bonin Islands. Here in latitude 26-27° N. we find several\r\nFijian littoral trees and shrubs, such as Hernandia peltata, Pemphis\r\nacidula, Pongamia glabra, Sophora tomentosa, Terminalia Katappa,\r\nTournefortia argentea, &c., that do not occur in Hawaii, although this\r\ngroup is some degrees nearer the equator, namely, in latitude 19-22° N.\r\nThey are accompanied by the mangroves (Rhizophora, Bruguiera, &c.) in\r\nstrength as far as South Liukiu in latitude 25° N.; but we learn from\r\nDr. Warburg that the mangroves thin off further north, though they reach\r\nto South Japan, where Döderlein found in latitude 32° N. solitary\r\nexamples of Rhizophora mucronata. These interesting facts of\r\ndistribution, which are taken from Schimper’s work on the Indo-Malayan\r\nshore-plants (pp. 85, 90), show us that we can scarcely look to climatic\r\nconditions for the explanation of the absence of mangroves and of many\r\nother tropical littoral plants from Hawaii. We form the same opinion\r\nwhen we regard the extension northward of the mangrove-formation on the\r\nAmerican coasts of the North Pacific Ocean. According to the account of\r\nDr. Seemann given in the “Botany of the Voyage of H.M.S. _Herald_,” the\r\nmangroves with the coco-nut palm, and many other littoral plants common\r\non the western shores of tropical America, reach their northern limit a\r\nlittle north of Mazatlan within the mouth of the Gulf of California in\r\nlatitude 24° 38ʹ N. The parallel of 25° N. latitude, as indicated in\r\nDrude’s Atlas, probably represents the extreme northern limit, which is\r\nthus five or six degrees north of the latitude of the large island of\r\nHawaii.\r\n\r\nNeither can the explanation be found in the deficient floating powers of\r\nthe seeds or seedvessels of many of the “absentees.” Those of\r\nBarringtonia speciosa, Guettarda speciosa, Heritiera littoralis, the two\r\nspecies of Terminalia, &c., possess great buoyant powers equal to, and\r\nprobably often exceeding, those of the plants that, like Ipomœa pes\r\ncapræ, have succeeded in establishing themselves in Hawaii. One has only\r\nto look at the lists giving the results of flotation experiments in\r\nNotes 2 and 3, in order to realise that there are very few of the\r\n“absentee” littoral plants, the non-existence of which in Hawaii could\r\nbe attributed to deficient floating powers of the fruit or seed. Being\r\nable to float unharmed for months, and in several cases even for years,\r\nthe seeds or fruits of the shore-plants unrepresented on the Hawaiian\r\nbeaches have been carried far and wide by the currents over the tropical\r\nPacific even to Ducie and Easter Islands, that is, as far as the islands\r\nextend.\r\n\r\nThe only plants about which one could express a doubt concerning their\r\nability to reach Hawaii through the agency of the currents, and to\r\nestablish themselves there, are the true mangroves of the genera\r\nRhizophora and Bruguiera. Since germination takes place on the tree, it\r\nis only through the floating seedlings that they could reach these\r\nislands; but, as shown in Chapter XXX., it is doubtful whether the\r\nseedlings would be in a fit condition for reproducing the plant after\r\nsuch a long oceanic voyage. If they had been as successful in\r\nestablishing themselves in Hawaii as they have been in the Liukiu\r\nIslands, which lie in latitude a few degrees farther north, these two\r\nspecies through their reclaiming agency would alone have prepared the\r\nway for the whole mangrove formation. We have seen in the preceding\r\nchapter that the absence of the mangrove formation from Tahiti appears\r\nto be mainly due to the failure of the pioneer species of Rhizophora and\r\nBruguiera to establish themselves there. This evidently also applies to\r\nHawaii, the cause of their exclusion being connected neither with\r\nclimate nor with station, but as in Tahiti with the general unfitness of\r\nthe floating mangrove seedlings for crossing broad tracts of ocean\r\nwithout injury to the growing plantlet.\r\n\r\nWith regard, however, to the bulk of the “absentee” littoral plants,\r\nthose of the beach-formation, no such incapacity on the part of the\r\nbuoyant seed or fruit can be accepted. These plants, which have reached\r\nTahiti in numbers, have in the mass failed to reach Hawaii. It will,\r\ntherefore, be of interest to glance at the character of the fruits of\r\nthe “absentee” trees, which a traveller fresh from a visit to the coral\r\nislands and reef-girt coasts of the South Pacific sadly misses on the\r\nHawaiian beaches. We notice in the first place that the absent trees,\r\nsuch as Barringtonia speciosa, Cerbera Odollam, Guettarda speciosa,\r\nHeritiera littoralis, Terminalia Katappa, &c., have large fruits which\r\ncould only have been carried to Hawaii by the currents, the agency of\r\nbirds being quite out of the question. On the other hand, almost all the\r\nlittoral plants of Hawaii, whether trees, shrubs, or herbs, which are\r\nregarded as truly indigenous by Mann, Hillebrand, and other Hawaiian\r\nbotanists, have only small fruits or seeds available for dispersal, from\r\nwhich the agency of birds cannot, on the point of size, be excluded.\r\nAmongst these shore plants possessing buoyant seeds or fruits are\r\nCassytha filiformis, Colubrina asiatica, Ipomœa pes capræ, Scævola\r\nKœnigii, Vigna lutea, and Vitex trifolia; whilst amongst the plants with\r\nnon-buoyant fruits or seeds are to be reckoned Heliotropium anomalum, H.\r\ncurassavicum, Tephrosia piscatoria, Tribulus cistoides, &c. The seeds or\r\nseedvessels of the plants of the buoyant group possess great floating\r\npowers; and it seems at first sight scarcely credible that the currents\r\nwhich have failed to establish Barringtonia speciosa, Guettarda\r\nspeciosa, and the other trees that through this agency have often found\r\na home on the remotest islands of the Pacific, should have succeeded in\r\nthe instances of plants like Scævola Kœnigii and Vitex trifolia.\r\n\r\nIt would indeed almost seem that in nearly all cases where it would be\r\nimpossible in point of size for a bird to transport the fruit or seed of\r\na shore-plant to Hawaii, such a plant is not to be found in the\r\nstrand-flora of that group, even though it is well adapted for dispersal\r\nby the currents. Many of the littoral trees missing from the Hawaiian\r\ncoast-flora, having large buoyant fruits, come into this category; and\r\ngrave suspicion is thus apparently cast on the agency of the currents in\r\nthe case of the plants with small fruits and seeds that really compose\r\nthe strand-flora, even when their capacity for sea-transport has been\r\nwell established by observation and experiment. The efficacy of the\r\ncurrents would thus seem to be called into question for the whole\r\nlittoral flora of Hawaii.\r\n\r\nIf, however, we were to adopt such a sweeping conclusion we should be\r\nled into an error. It is pointed out in the following chapter that\r\nnearly all these large-fruited beach trees that are found far and wide\r\nover the South Pacific, but are absent from Hawaii, do not occur as\r\nindigenous plants in America. If, therefore, the fruits of such Old\r\nWorld littoral trees as Barringtonia speciosa, Cerbera Odollam,\r\nGuettarda speciosa, Ochrosia parviflora, Terminalia Katappa, &c., that\r\ncould be dispersed only by the currents, have failed to reach Hawaii, it\r\nis essential to remember that they have also failed to reach America.\r\nThis suggests that Hawaii may have received some of its littoral plants\r\nfrom America through the agency of the currents; and it is shown in the\r\nfollowing chapter that, as a rule, when a South Pacific plant with\r\nbuoyant fruits or seeds is not found in America, it is equally absent\r\nfrom Hawaii. The question thus acquires quite a different aspect, and we\r\nshall accordingly have to regard tropical America in the next chapter as\r\na possible centre of diffusion of littoral plants over the globe, a\r\ncentre possibly as important as that connected with the tropics of the\r\nOld World.\r\n\r\nAlthough, however, the currents have played a part in stocking the\r\nHawaiian beaches with their plants, their share in the work has been\r\nunimportant, and the number of plants concerned is limited. If we take\r\naway the seven or eight littoral plants introduced by the aborigines, as\r\nwell as the three endemic species as indicated in the list in Note 28,\r\nand then remove from the residue the plants with small fruits or seeds\r\npossessing little or no buoyancy, there remain only the following eight\r\nspecies, the presence of which in Hawaii might be attributed to the\r\ncurrents, namely, Cæsalpinia Bonducella, Cassytha filiformis, Colubrina\r\nasiatica, Ipomœa glaberrima, Ipomœa pes capræ, Scævola Kœnigii, Vigna\r\nlutea, and Vitex trifolia. Of these plants, three species, those of\r\nCassytha, Scævola, and Vitex, possess fruits that would be likely to\r\nattract frugivorous birds, and are in some cases known to be dispersed\r\nby them (see Chapter XIII.); so that we are not in these instances\r\nrestricted to the agency of the currents. With the other five the\r\ncurrents offer the readiest explanation, but, as is indicated in the\r\ncases of Cæsalpinia Bonducella and Ipomœa glaberrima (Chapter XVII.), it\r\nis quite possible that birds have occasionally intervened. Altogether we\r\nmay infer that in stocking the Hawaiian beaches with their littoral\r\nplants the currents have taken a subordinate part.\r\n\r\nComing to the Hawaiian littoral plants having seeds or fruits that have\r\nno floating power, we find that they present a motley group. It has been\r\nalready remarked that this is the group of shore plants that derives\r\nmost recruits from the inland flora, and that it is in this group that\r\nthe differences between the shore-floras of tropical regions find their\r\nexpression. Yet a very odd collection of plants is here exhibited.\r\nSometimes the beach-flora is composed in great part of these plants; and\r\na sorry spectacle is presented by a beach possessing such plants as\r\nGossypium tomentosum, Heliotropium anomalum and H. curassavicum,\r\nLipochæta integrifolia, Tephrosia piscatoria, Tribulus cistoides, &c.\r\nYet to the student of plant-distribution such a motley collection would\r\nbe full of suggestiveness. From the circumstance that species of\r\nCuscuta, Jacquemontia, and Lipochæta, that are peculiar to the Hawaiian\r\nIslands, have made their homes on the beach, he would infer that since\r\nNature has been compelled to borrow from the endemic inland flora, there\r\nhas been some difficulty in stocking the beaches with their plants. The\r\noccurrence of endemic species amongst the strand-plants would be viewed\r\nby him as especially indicating incapacity on the part of the ocean\r\ncurrents.\r\n\r\nYet in the quantities of drift timber, showing evidence of many months\r\nand probably even of years of ocean-transport, to be seen stranded on\r\nthe weather coasts of these islands, the observer discerns undoubted\r\nevidence of the efficacy of the ocean currents. But what he finds are\r\nhuge stranded pine logs of “red-cedar” and “white-cedar” from the\r\nnorth-west coasts of America. He may search the drift for days together,\r\nas I have done, and discover no tropical fruits or seeds except such as\r\ncould be supplied by the present Hawaiian flora. The subject of this\r\ndrift is especially discussed in Note 30; and it need only be mentioned\r\nhere that it is not improbable that, as shown in the next chapter, some\r\ndrift may reach Hawaii from tropical America under exceptional\r\nconditions, and that its presence is masked by the Oregon drift.\r\n\r\nThe agency of the drifting log in carrying small seeds in its crevices\r\nwould be effectual in the instance of plants from the temperate coasts\r\nof North America. For example, the nutlets of Heliotropium curassavicum,\r\nwhich have no buoyancy, might easily be washed, together with sand, into\r\nthe cracks of a pine log stranded temporarily on the Oregon coast where\r\nthis plant occurs. The _modus operandi_ was brought home to me when\r\nexamining the drift brought down by the Chancay River on the coast of\r\nPeru. Here I found this species of Heliotropium growing on the margin of\r\na swamp near some stranded logs, that would probably be carried out to\r\nsea when the river was next in flood.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, I may add, that the seeds or fruits of some of the\r\nplants of the non-buoyant group of the Hawaiian littoral flora may be\r\ndispersed in birds’ plumage. For instance, the spiny fruits of Tribulus\r\ncistoides sink in sea-water; but they are well suited for entangling\r\nthemselves in birds’ feathers.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the hairy seeds of Gossypium tomentosum may have\r\nbeen thus distributed; but there is much that is enigmatical about this\r\nplant (see Chapter XXVI).\r\n\r\nTHE INLAND EXTENSION OF THE BEACH PLANTS OF HAWAII.—When we regard the\r\ninland extension of littoral plants in Hawaii, we get fresh indications\r\nof the meagreness of the strand-flora. Several of the species, as\r\nCæsalpinia Bonducella, Cassytha filiformis, Tephrosia piscatoria, &c.,\r\nshow themselves only occasionally on the sandy beaches, though they are\r\ncommon enough on the old scantily vegetated lava-flows near the coast\r\nand are often found miles inland. Indeed, Dr. Hillebrand not\r\ninfrequently in describing the station only gives prominence to the\r\nsituation of the plants away from the beaches, and places most of them\r\non the old lava plains that extend inland from the coast. It is only by\r\na detailed examination of extensive coast lines in these islands that I\r\nhave succeeded in preserving to a small degree their reputation as beach\r\nplants. A few of them behave somewhat strangely in their inland station.\r\nThus, the seeds of Cæsalpinia Bonducella obtained from various\r\nlocalities showed no buoyancy in my experiments; and had I not found a\r\nsolitary buoyant seed in the stranded drift I should have inferred that\r\nthis was a rule without exception.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remarked that whilst some plants like Scævola Koenigii\r\noccasionally stray a few hundred yards inland on the surface of the old\r\nlava-flows, others like Ipomœa pes capræ and Vitex trifolia, that are\r\nspread far and wide over the inland plains of Fiji, are confined in\r\nHawaii to the beaches and their immediate vicinity. Some of the plants\r\nlike Hibiscus tiliaceus, Morinda citrifolia, and Pandanus odoratissimus,\r\nthat are regarded as having been introduced by the aborigines, behave\r\nexactly like indigenous plants in the inland plains; but this is not\r\nnecessarily an indication of an indigenous plant in this group, since\r\nthe Cactus (Opuntia Tuna) and the Castor-Oil Plant (Ricinus communis)\r\nhave spread all over the drier lower regions of the islands, whilst\r\nAleurites moluccana, the Candle-Nut Tree, which has no means of reaching\r\nthese islands without man’s agency, now forms entire woods on the\r\nmountain slopes, usurping the place often of the original forests....\r\nFurther details relating to this subject are given in Note 31.\r\n\r\nThe principal points in the foregoing discussion of the strand-flora of\r\nHawaii may be thus summed up:—\r\n\r\n(1) The indigenous, that is, the pre-aboriginal, strand-flora of this\r\ngroup lacks not only the mangroves and their associated plants, but also\r\nmost of the characteristic beach-trees of the South Pacific, which are\r\nknown to owe their wide distribution in tropical regions to the\r\ncurrents.\r\n\r\n(2) The meagreness of the littoral flora is intensified by the tendency\r\nof some of the plants to extend inland and to desert the coasts, and by\r\nthe occurrence on the beaches of peculiar species not found outside the\r\nHawaiian Islands.\r\n\r\n(3) The absence of the mangrove formation and of so many of the typical\r\nbeach trees of the Pacific cannot be attributed either to the lack of\r\nsuitable stations, or to climatic conditions, or to deficient floating\r\npower of the seed or fruit.\r\n\r\n(4) As in the case of Tahiti, the mangroves and their associated plants\r\nare lacking because the floating seedlings of Rhizophora and Bruguiera,\r\nthe pioneer plants of a mangrove-swamp, have failed to reach Hawaii in a\r\nfit condition for establishing themselves. The numerous plants that\r\naccompany a mangrove-swamp have thus been unable to find a home, though\r\nthe buoyant powers of their fruits or seeds are often great.\r\n\r\n(5) With the missing beach-trees, however, which possess fruits that can\r\nfloat for years unharmed in sea-water, no such incapacity is suggested.\r\nMost of them have large fruits, which could only reach Hawaii through\r\nthe currents. This absence from the Hawaiian indigenous strand-plants of\r\nmost, if not all, of the large-fruited species, where on account of size\r\nthe agency of birds is absolutely excluded, is very remarkable; and it\r\nat first seems to throw grave suspicion on the efficacy of the currents\r\nfor the whole strand-flora.\r\n\r\n(6) It is, however, to be noticed that these large-fruited beach trees\r\nhave not only failed to reach Hawaii but have also failed to reach\r\nAmerica. The question thus acquires quite a different aspect, and\r\nAmerica becomes the possible source of most of the Hawaiian plants with\r\nbuoyant seeds or fruits.\r\n\r\n(7) This subject is discussed in the next chapter; but it is here shown\r\nthat at their best the currents have taken but a secondary part in\r\nstocking the Hawaiian beaches with their plants, since many of the\r\nplants have non-buoyant seeds or fruits.\r\n\r\n(8) The drift stranded on the shores of the Hawaiian Islands is composed\r\nof logs from the north-west coast of North America. No drift from the\r\nsouth has been discovered; but it is not unlikely that future\r\ninvestigators will find some seed-drift from tropical America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE WORLD\r\n  SHOWING\r\n  OCEAN CURRENTS\r\n\r\n  John Bartholomew & Co., Edin^r.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n          THE LITTORAL PLANTS AND THE CURRENTS OF THE PACIFIC\r\n\r\nThe working value of the currents as plant-dispersers.—The relation\r\n  between the currents and the distribution of shore-plants.—The clue\r\n  afforded by the American plants.—Two regions of tropical shore-plants,\r\n  the American and the Asiatic.—America, the home of the cosmopolitan\r\n  tropical shore-plants that are dispersed by the currents.—Hawaii and\r\n  the currents.—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTIVE as the currents are in dispersing seeds and fruits over the\r\nPacific, it should be remembered that those plants that owe their\r\ndistribution to this agency are only shore-plants, and not, indeed, all\r\nthe shore-plants, but only those with buoyant seeds or fruits. Even the\r\ncoral atoll owes a great deal to the agency of the fruit-pigeon and of\r\nother birds; for instance, their species of Ficus, Eugenia, and Pisonia.\r\nIn order, therefore, not to form an exaggerated notion of the efficacy\r\nof the currents, it will be necessary to obtain some numerical idea of\r\nwhat they have really accomplished in transporting seeds and seedvessels\r\nover the oceans in a state fit for successful germination on the shores\r\nupon which they are stranded. It is requisite to make this proviso,\r\nbecause in some cases the currents work to no purpose. Thus, the empty\r\nnuts of Aleurites moluccana are carried far and wide over the Indian and\r\nPacific Oceans, and are stranded on the beaches of the various islands,\r\nas I have found myself in the cases of Keeling Atoll, Java, and Fiji.\r\nThe Coco-de-Mer, or the Double Coco-nut Palm, is another apt instance.\r\nThough its fruits have been carried far and wide over the Indian Ocean,\r\nthe species is restricted to the Seychelles. So also the acorns of\r\nvarious species of Quercus are widely but ineffectually distributed by\r\nthe currents both in temperate and tropical regions. (This subject of\r\nuseless dispersal is dealt with in Chapter XIII.)\r\n\r\nIt is essential to bear in mind at the outset that for their inland\r\nplants the Pacific islands can draw on the floras of a relatively large\r\nportion of the globe. Such plants, having as a rule fruits or seeds that\r\nsink in sea-water, or are incapable of floating for long periods, could\r\nonly have arrived at these islands, where man’s interference is\r\nexcluded, through the agencies of winds and birds, assisted by other\r\nlesser agencies, as those of bats, insects, &c. On the other hand, for\r\ntheir littoral plants, which are for the most part dispersed by the\r\ncurrents, the source of supply is very restricted. The shore-plants with\r\nbuoyant seeds or fruits of the islands of the tropical Pacific, that are\r\nhere dealt with, number only about seventy, and it is not likely that\r\nthis number will be greatly increased, since, whatever may be the\r\ndeficiencies in our acquaintance with the inland floras of these\r\nislands, we have a fairly complete knowledge of the strictly littoral\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nI do not suppose, indeed, that the number of such plants with seeds or\r\nfruits capable of being transported unharmed over wide tracts of sea\r\nwould much exceed 100 for the whole Indo-Pacific region from India to\r\nTahiti. Professor Schimper gives a list containing 117 tropical plants\r\ndistributed far and wide over the shores of this region, and made up of\r\nspecies dispersed by currents, birds, and man. Taking a liberal\r\nestimate, not over two-thirds of the plants mentioned in this list are\r\ndispersed by currents. Then, again, if the flora of a coral atoll, like\r\nthat of Diego Garcia or of the Keeling Islands, is taken as affording an\r\nindex of the work of the currents, the number of plants dispersed by the\r\ncurrents would appear to be indeed restricted, since in either case\r\ntheir indigenous flowering plants, including those of both the buoyant\r\nand non-buoyant groups, do not exceed fifty.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty years ago, Mr. Hemsley, who, in his work on the botany of\r\nthe _Challenger_ Expedition, prepared the way for the investigation of\r\nthis subject, made a list of not less than 120 plants, almost all\r\ntropical, that are “certainly or probably dispersed” by the currents\r\n(Introd. _Chall._ Bot., p. 42). This is admittedly only a preliminary\r\nlist, and as the result of recent investigations some plants have to be\r\nomitted and others to be added; but I doubt whether, numerically, it is\r\nfar below the mark. The relative efficacy of the currents seems to have\r\nbeen first systematically discussed by De Candolle in his _Géographie\r\nBotanique_, which was published in 1855. Data were then very scanty, and\r\nout of a list of nearly 100 inter-tropical species (Old World plants\r\nfound in the New World and New World plants found in the Old World) he\r\ndesignates nine only as exclusively dispersed by the currents. Even this\r\nlist, in one respect, needs correction (see Note 33); but it is of\r\ninterest to note that this eminent botanist from the first never looked\r\nupon the agency of the currents as a very important factor in\r\nplant-dispersal; and, finding in the specially directed and carefully\r\nperformed experiments of Thuret confirmation of his views, he reiterated\r\nhis opinion in a note to that author’s paper in 1873 (cited in Chapter\r\nIII.).\r\n\r\nHowever, De Candolle was quite right in minimising the effect of\r\ncurrents on the distribution of plants. His extensive survey of the\r\nplant-world from the standpoint of dispersal gave him that sense of\r\nproportion in assigning values to dispersing agents which enabled him to\r\nfeel his way almost intuitively, even where exact data were often\r\nlacking. It is, however, a little disappointing to find such a slight\r\ntreatment of the subject in Kerner’s great work on the Natural History\r\nof Plants, though one can scarcely controvert his opinion that the\r\ndispersion of plants, as a whole, is not appreciably affected by this\r\nprocess. Numerically speaking, this is in the main correct; yet it is\r\nhere that the genius of Schimper led him to recognise and to mark out a\r\nline of investigation, fruitful in important results, in connection with\r\nthe weighty question of “Adaptation.” If the author of this work has\r\nbeen able to add a little to our acquaintance with this subject, he owes\r\nmuch to the inspiration he received from Schimper’s memoir on the\r\nIndo-Malayan Strand-Flora.\r\n\r\nStill, it must be admitted that the effectual operations of the currents\r\nas plant-dispersers are limited to the shore-plants with buoyant seeds\r\nor fruits. If we were to include in our list the shore-plants of\r\ntemperate regions that possess seeds or fruits capable of floating in\r\nsea-water for long periods, and of afterwards germinating, the total for\r\nthe whole world would not, I imagine, reach 200. We cannot here concern\r\nourselves with those purely river-side plants that contribute their\r\nbuoyant seeds and seed-vessels to river-drift, since there is no\r\nevidence indicating that river-side plants are effectively dispersed by\r\nthe currents unless they also frequent the estuary and the coast-swamp;\r\nand in that case they come under the head of littoral plants. The total\r\nfor the whole British flora would probably not far exceed a dozen, and\r\nnearly all of them are very widely dispersed.\r\n\r\nThe working value of the currents as plant-dispersers in the Pacific can\r\nbe rudely estimated by the number of littoral plants with buoyant seeds\r\nor fruits that occur in the various groups. Most of these plants hail\r\nfrom the Indo-Malayan region. Speaking generally of the extension\r\neastward of the Indo-Malayan strand-plants over the Pacific, Prof.\r\nSchimper (page 195) remarks that they become fewer and fewer in number\r\nas they extend farther from their original home, their number shrinking\r\nto a very few in the most remote groups of the Marquesas and the\r\nHawaiian Islands. This is well illustrated in the following numerical\r\nresults that I have prepared. Of the whole number, some seventy in all,\r\nof the littoral plants of the tropical Pacific with buoyant seeds or\r\nfruits, Fiji possesses about sixty-five, Tahiti about forty, and Hawaii\r\nonly about sixteen. As shown, however, in Chapter VII., some of the\r\nHawaiian littoral trees that are useful to the aborigines were probably\r\nintroduced by them. The number actually introduced through the currents\r\ninto Hawaii in all likelihood therefore does not exceed ten. There is a\r\nmethod in this diminution in numbers, as the plants migrate eastward and\r\nnorthward over the Pacific, which has been described in detail in the\r\npreceding chapter. The efficacy of the currents as plant-dispersers in\r\nthe tropical Pacific therefore diminishes as we proceed eastward.\r\n\r\nIn the South Pacific the littoral plants preserve their Old World origin\r\nas far as the Polynesian archipelagoes extend eastward across to\r\nPitcairn, Elizabeth, and Ducie Islands, where we find in one or other of\r\nthem such characteristic Indo-Malayan beach trees as Barringtonia\r\nspeciosa, Cerbera Odollam, Guettarda speciosa, Hernandia peltata, and\r\nTournefortia argentea (see Note 34). In the more distant Easter Island\r\nthere is a suspicion, for the first time, of immigration from South\r\nAmerica in the presence of Sophora tetraptera. In the islands relatively\r\nclose to the American continent, as in Juan Fernandez and in the\r\nGalapagos group, the Indo-Malayan strand-plants are no longer\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\nWe come now to consider the relation between the distribution of the\r\nshore-plants and the currents. It is quite legitimate to discuss the\r\ncurrents of the Pacific from the botanist’s point of view, that is to\r\nsay, from the standpoint of the distribution of littoral plants with\r\nbuoyant seeds or fruits. For ages the buoyant seeds and fruits of the\r\nstrand-plants of the tropical Pacific have been drifting over that\r\nocean, and we have the results now before us in the dispersal of the\r\nspecies to which they belong. There is no necessity to endeavour to make\r\nthe distribution of such littoral plants square with the arrangement of\r\nthe currents as shown in a chart. The usual result of such a comparison\r\nhas been to lead the investigator, whether an anthropologist, a\r\nzoologist, or a botanist, to find his facts at variance with the course\r\nof the prevailing currents. Man, animals, and plants have entered the\r\nPacific from the west, whilst the most available currents are from the\r\neast; and one may be perhaps permitted the solecism that the Pacific\r\nislands have apparently been stocked with their shore-plants, with their\r\naborigines, and with much of their fauna by currents running in the\r\nwrong direction. These Pacific islands could only have had a direct\r\ncommunication with the Old World, from which they have mainly derived\r\ntheir shore-plants, by the currents; but since both the aborigines and\r\nthe plants have forced their way across the ocean to the Tahitian region\r\nin the teeth of the regular currents, indicated as such in the chart, we\r\nare compelled to assume that they have availed themselves either of the\r\nEquatorial Counter-Current or of the occasional easterly drift currents\r\nthat mark the prevalence of westerly winds during the short season of\r\nthe year when the easterly trade-winds do not prevail.\r\n\r\nThe Equatorial Counter-Current hypothesis would involve a preliminary\r\ncrossing of the whole breadth of the Pacific Ocean, that is to say, a\r\nvoyage of some 8,000 miles, before the drifting seed doubled back to the\r\nPolynesian Islands. The other view is a much more probable one, as is\r\nsufficiently indicated by the following extract from the “Admiralty\r\nSailing Directions for the Pacific Islands” (II., p. 25, 1900).... “In\r\nthe western part of the Pacific these trades ... are frequently\r\ninterrupted by winds which blow from west or north-west, especially\r\nduring the months of January, February, and March, when the north-west\r\nmonsoon of the Indian Ocean extends out in the Pacific as far as the\r\nSamoa Islands.” In various works on this region one may find reference\r\nto canoes blown off the shore during this season and carried some\r\nhundreds of miles to the eastward. A ship can then sometimes sail with a\r\nfair wind from the southern end of the Solomon Group to the Fijis; and\r\nas we learn from Mariner, the crocodile may be at such times carried\r\naway from the Solomon Islands and stranded in Fiji. Mr. Hedley, in his\r\nexceedingly interesting paper on a zoogeographic scheme for the\r\nmid-Pacific (_Proc. Linn. Soc. N.S.W._, 1899), gives many details of\r\nthis nature; but there is no space to deal further with the matter here.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the botanist must take his cue from the drifting seed and the\r\ndistribution of the plant. He finds the seed floating in the open sea as\r\nwell as stranded on the beach. He then discovers the plant growing on\r\nthe beaches, and by experiment he tests the floating capacity of the\r\nfruit or seed. Finally he ascertains the home of the plant. He does this\r\nfor all the littoral plants with buoyant seeds or fruits, and he forms\r\nhis own conclusions of the efficacy of the currents independently of the\r\ncurrent-chart, remembering that he has in Time an important factor that\r\nthe geographer does not possess in dealing with the currents. The effect\r\nof time has often been to obscure the differential results of the\r\noperations of the currents in the case of those species that, like\r\nBarringtonia speciosa, are almost universally distributed in the islands\r\nof the Pacific. It is obvious that such plants cannot aid us much in the\r\nmatter of ascertaining the track followed by the drifting seed in\r\nentering this ocean. But if we find a littoral plant with buoyant seed\r\nor fruit that has only partially performed the traverse we shall possess\r\nin the interrupted operation an important piece of evidence.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago, in my paper on Polynesian plant-names, read before\r\nthe Victoria Institute, I developed this argument when endeavouring to\r\nfind in the floating seed a clue to the route pursued by the Polynesians\r\nin entering the Pacific. Since that time my acquaintance with these\r\nislands and their plants has been considerably extended; but no\r\nimportant modification of the principal argument is now needed. It was\r\nthen pointed out that in Nipa fruticans, the swamp-palm of the Malayan\r\nIslands and of tropical south-eastern Asia, we have a plant well fitted\r\nfor the purpose and one well known to be dispersed by the currents over\r\nsmall tracts of ocean. The Nipa Palm has attempted to enter Polynesia\r\nfrom the Malayan region by two routes, namely, by Melanesia and by\r\nMicronesia. Along the first route it has in the course of ages reached\r\nthe Solomon Islands, where I found it in 1884. Along the second route it\r\nhas extended its range to Ualan at the eastern end of the Caroline\r\nGroup, where it was observed by Kittlitz many years ago, as indicated in\r\nthe narrative of his voyage (_Reise nach russische America, nach\r\nMikronesien_, etc., 1858, ii. 35), and in Dr. Seemann’s English edition\r\nof the same author’s _Vierundzwanzig Vegetationsansichten ... des\r\nstillen Oceans_.\r\n\r\nThe question now arises as to which of these two routes was taken by the\r\ndrifting seed. In my paper I adopted the view that the shore plants\r\nreached Fiji and Samoa by Micronesia, that is to say, by the Caroline,\r\nMarshall, and Gilbert Groups. This is the route which, as mentioned by\r\nMr. Hedley in the paper above quoted, Mr. Woodford prefers for some of\r\nthe Lepidoptera; and it is the one that is favoured by Mr. Wiglesworth\r\nfor the birds, since in his memoir entitled _Aves Polynesiæ_ he remarks\r\nthat certain indications tend to show that the Pelew Islands have served\r\nas a sort of bridge for the spread of species from Indo-Austro-Malaya\r\nright across the Pacific. Though I still think that the beach trees,\r\nmost of which would find a home on the numerous coral atolls of the\r\nMarshall, Gilbert, and Ellice Groups, often followed that track, yet I\r\nam now inclined to consider that the mangroves and their associates,\r\nplants which find their most suitable home in the estuaries of large\r\nelevated islands, like those of the Solomon Group, in all probability\r\nreached Fiji in the mass by the Melanesian route.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  TRADE ROUTES\r\n\r\n  OF THE\r\n\r\n  PACIFIC OCEAN\r\n\r\n  (_On Mercator's projection_)\r\n\r\n  John Bartholomew & Co., Edin^r.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Old World has supplied to the Pacific islands most of their\r\nlittoral plants that are dispersed by the currents, that is to say, the\r\nplants with buoyant seeds or seed vessels, yet there is an appreciable\r\nAmerican element, and it is with the plants occurring in the New World\r\nthat we are now concerned. The total number of the littoral plants of\r\nthese islands that possess buoyant seeds or fruits is, according to the\r\nlists given under Note 35, about seventy. Of these about forty-five are\r\nexclusively Old World species, sixteen occur in both the Old and New\r\nWorlds, three are exclusively American, and six are Polynesian.\r\n\r\nThe question we have now to ask ourselves is whether the shore plants\r\ncommon to both the Old World and America have their homes in America, or\r\nwhether they have been derived from the other hemisphere. With one or\r\ntwo exceptions, as in the cases of the Australian genera Dodonæa,\r\nScævola, and Cassytha, which, as shown in a later page in this chapter,\r\npresent no great difficulty, there does not seem to be any serious\r\nobjection, as far as the numerical distribution of the species is\r\nconcerned, in regarding America as a possible home of the genus. It is\r\nnot often we shall come upon such a striking instance of the principle\r\nthat where the species are most numerous there is the home of the genus,\r\nas in the instance of Cocos. The Coco-nut palm has been carried around\r\nthe world through the agencies of man and the currents, whilst the home\r\nof the genus is in America.\r\n\r\nNow assuming that in having to choose between the Old World and the New\r\nWorld as the home of most of the genera in the list we selected the\r\nlatter, we have to ask ourselves in what degree this would be consistent\r\nwith the place America holds with regard to the distribution of tropical\r\nshore-plants dispersed by the currents and with reference to the\r\narrangement of the currents. If we except the African continent, there\r\nis no part of the world that bears such a definite relation to the\r\ncurrents as America, and with an ordinary chart of these regions their\r\narrangement is to be understood at a glance. Yet strange to say, as far\r\nas the distribution of tropical littoral plants is concerned, America\r\nholds a position that the present system of the currents on its coasts\r\nwill not altogether explain. Within the lifetime of the species of\r\nmangroves and other plants of the coast swamps that are found on both\r\nthe Pacific and Atlantic coasts of tropical America the two continents\r\nof this name have been united by the emergence of the Isthmus of Panama.\r\n\r\nFew things are more significant in plant-distribution than the\r\narrangement of the tropical littoral plants with buoyant seeds or\r\nfruits, a subject that is discussed with some detail by Professor\r\nSchimper in his work on the Indo-Malayan strand-flora (page 190). These\r\nplants group themselves into four sections:—\r\n\r\n(_a_) Those of the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of tropical America\r\n(including the West Indies) and of the West Coast of Africa. They\r\ninclude mostly plants of the mangrove-swamps and their vicinity, such as\r\nAnona paludosa, Avicennia tomentosa, A. nitida, Conocarpus erectus,\r\nLaguncularia racemosa, Rhizophora mangle, etc.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Those of the Old World excluding the African West Coast and\r\nextending from the East Coast of Africa eastward to the Pacific islands.\r\nThis is much the largest group and comprises many of the plants named in\r\nthe list given in Note 35 under Old World species. One may cite as\r\nexamples of plants ranging almost all over this area, Barringtonia\r\nspeciosa, B. racemosa, Bruguiera gymnorhiza (in its most comprehensive\r\nsense), Carapa moluccensis, Derris uliginosa, Guettarda speciosa,\r\nHernandia peltata, Heritiera littoralis, Pemphis acidula, Rhizophora\r\nmucronata, etc. Plants of the mangrove-swamp and of the beach are,\r\ntherefore, here included.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Those occurring all around the tropics and including many of the\r\nplants mentioned under Note 35 as Pacific island shore-plants found also\r\nin America. Most of them belong to the Leguminosæ, and there may here be\r\nmentioned Canavalia obtusifolia, Cæsalpinia Bonducella, Entada scandens,\r\nGyrocarpus jacquini, Ipomœa pes capræ, Sophora tomentosa, and Vigna\r\nlutea.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Those confined to a portion of the two great regions, such as Nipa\r\nfruticans in the Old World, and the Manchineel (Hippomane mancinella) to\r\ntropical America.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that the ubiquitous species do not include any of the\r\nmangroves. Each of the two regions has its own species, none being\r\ncommon to both the American and Asiatic regions, although, as is shown\r\nin Chapter XXX., the American species of Rhizophora is now seemingly\r\nbreaking its bounds and intruding into the Pacific islands. On the other\r\nhand, some of the mangrove genera, Avicennia, Carapa, and Rhizophora,\r\nare found all round the globe, whilst others are restricted to one or\r\nother of the two regions, Bruguiera, Lumnitzera, and Sonneratia, for\r\ninstance, to the Old World region, and Laguncularia to the American and\r\nWest African region.\r\n\r\nFor convenience we may designate the two great regions of tropical\r\nstrand-plants, with buoyant seeds or fruits, the American and the\r\nAsiatic regions, remembering that the first includes both coasts of\r\nAmerica as well as the African West Coast, whilst the second extends\r\nfrom the East Coast of Africa to Polynesia. Excluding the ubiquitous\r\nspecies, these two regions are well distinguished from each other. If we\r\nlook at the chart of the currents we perceive the reason of the American\r\nregion including the West African Coast, and we see why none of the\r\nindigenous plants of this region occur on the African East Coast. So\r\nalso with the Asiatic region, a glance at the chart will show that all\r\nthe portions of its area are in connection with each other directly or\r\nindirectly through the currents, and that only time is required for the\r\ntransport of buoyant seeds over most of the region.\r\n\r\nHitherto I have mainly followed Professor Schimper in this matter; but\r\nsince my visit to Ecuador and the Panama Isthmus some further\r\nconsiderations have presented themselves to me. If the reader will look\r\nagain at the map of the currents, he will observe that there is little\r\nreason for supposing that the Asiatic region can lend its littoral\r\nplants to the American region. On the other hand there are greater\r\nfacilities, as far as currents are concerned, for America supplying the\r\nAsiatic region, namely by means of the great equatorial currents that\r\ncourse westward across the Pacific to the tropics of the Old World.\r\n\r\nIt would therefore seem that the American region can receive nothing by\r\nthe currents from the Asiatic region. If accordingly it gives but gets\r\nnothing back, we are compelled to assign an origin in the American\r\nregion to all littoral plants dispersed by the currents that are found\r\nin the tropics around the globe. This is what we have already regarded\r\non other grounds as possible for nearly all the littoral plants of the\r\ntropical Pacific with buoyant seeds or seedvessels that are found in\r\nAmerica. These plants are practically the same as those distributed\r\naround the tropical zone which are enumerated in the list given under\r\nNote 35, _b_. With their home in America, by crossing the Pacific they\r\nwould ultimately arrive at the East African coast, where their course\r\nwestward would terminate; whilst commencing their journey from the east\r\nside of the American continent they would reach the West African coast;\r\nand their distribution around the tropics of the world would be\r\nexplained. There follow from these considerations the corollaries that a\r\ntropical strand-plant dispersed by the currents which has its birthplace\r\nin Asia could never reach the American region, and that American\r\nstrand-plants are for the most part native-born, excepting those, if\r\nthere are any, that hail originally from the African West Coast.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary in passing to explain the similarity of shore plants on\r\nthe Pacific and Atlantic coasts of Tropical America. For the mangroves\r\nand their accompanying plants inter-communication between the two coasts\r\nis now impossible; and a communication between the two oceans must be\r\npostulated within the lives of the existing species. For the plants like\r\nEntada scandens and Ipomœa pes capræ, which occur inland as well as at\r\nthe coast, it is easy to show that in the case of the Panama Isthmus,\r\ntheir seeds could be readily carried into the Atlantic and Pacific\r\nOceans by rivers draining the opposite slopes of the same “divide,” so\r\nthat the dispersal of the same species from a common centre into two\r\noceans may be seen in operation in our own day. My observations on this\r\nsubject are given in Chapter XXXII., to which the reader is referred.\r\n\r\nI have now gone far enough to indicate the place that America holds with\r\nregard to the distribution of tropical shore-plants dispersed by the\r\ncurrents and with regard to the currents. There is every probability, as\r\nI venture to think I have shown, that the Pacific islands have derived\r\nmost of their ubiquitous shore-plants with buoyant seeds or fruits from\r\nAmerica. But one of the results of our discussion of America in this\r\ndouble aspect was that excepting in the case of the African West Coast\r\nit gives but does not receive plants from the Old World. We apply this\r\ntest, with perhaps a little hesitation, to the shore-plants of the\r\nPacific islands that are dispersed by the currents; and we find, as will\r\nbe seen below, that it is responded to in a remarkable manner.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed in the previous chapter that scarcely any of the\r\nlarge-fruited beach-plants of the South Pacific islands, that could only\r\nhave been dispersed by the currents, have reached Hawaii. We do not find\r\namongst the truly indigenous coast flora of this group any of the\r\nfollowing trees: Barringtonia speciosa, Calophyllum Inophyllum, Cerbera\r\nOdollam, Guettarda speciosa, Hernandia peltata, Ochrosia parviflora,\r\nPongamia glabra, Terminalia Katappa, Terminalia littoralis, &c. It was\r\nalso noted that the currents had not only failed to establish these\r\nplants in Hawaii, but that they had also failed to establish them in\r\nAmerica, the suggestion being that the Hawaiian Islands had been, in\r\npart at least, stocked by the currents from America. That the\r\nIndo-Malayan strand-plants in their extension eastward over the Pacific\r\nshould have failed to reach America, is a result we might have expected\r\nfrom the arrangement of the currents. Yet mingled with them we have\r\nplants like Ipomœa pes capræ, Canavalia obtusifolia, and Sophora\r\ntomentosa, that also occur in America. Since, however, their seeds are\r\nnot better adapted for accomplishing the passage across the Pacific from\r\nthe Old World to America than the equally buoyant fruits of the\r\nabove-named littoral trees that have failed, the presumption arises that\r\ntheir home is in America, and that they have performed the easier\r\npassage across the Pacific westward from America to the Old World.\r\n\r\nThe exclusion of so many characteristic shore-trees from America that\r\nrange often over the whole tropical region from the African East Coast\r\nto the islands of the Central Pacific, is not a matter of seed or\r\nfruit-buoyancy, but a matter concerned with the home of the species, and\r\nwith the arrangement of the currents. Those shore-plants of this region\r\nthat occur also in America have their home in that continent, and have\r\nsubsequently been carried across the Pacific by the currents westward to\r\nthe Asiatic shores.\r\n\r\nThe only exceptions, that I can recall, to the rule that America does\r\nnot receive shore-plants dispersed by the currents from the Old World,\r\nare presented by the three Australian genera, Dodonæa, Scævola, and\r\nCassytha, of which widely spread littoral species occur in America,\r\nnamely, Scævola Lobelia, Dodonæa viscosa, and Cassytha filiformis. They\r\noffer, however, but little difficulty, since, as pointed out in other\r\nparts of this work, Dodonæa viscosa has probably been in part dispersed\r\nby man, whilst the other two species are as well fitted for dispersal by\r\nbirds as by currents. The occurrence therefore of these species in\r\nAmerica does not necessarily raise the question of the currents.\r\n\r\nThe same exclusive principle is illustrated in the scanty littoral flora\r\nof Hawaii. Deprived, like America, of the characteristic large-fruited\r\nbeach-trees of the South Pacific, species that could only have reached\r\nit through the agency of the currents, it is scarcely to be expected\r\nthat it would have received its few littoral plants with buoyant seeds\r\nfrom the source which has failed it in the cases of the numerous\r\nabsentees. It is to America therefore that we look for the source of its\r\nlittoral plants as far as the agency of the currents is concerned.\r\n\r\nThe Hawaiian Islands contain about twelve plants, named in the list\r\ngiven in Note 36, that possess seeds or fruits known to be dispersed by\r\nthe currents, and capable, as experiments indicate, of floating in\r\nsea-water for prolonged periods. Not all of them are at present littoral\r\nin their station in this group; but their claim to be considered such in\r\nother regions is established in the Note above mentioned. Of these\r\nplants, seven at least are found in America, five in the Old World also,\r\nand two exclusively in America. This proportion of American plants is\r\nfar greater than that characterising the whole littoral flora of the\r\nPacific islands dispersed by currents, where out of some seventy species\r\nonly nineteen are found in America (see Note 35). As far as the\r\ndistribution of the plants is concerned, it is therefore quite possible\r\nthat Hawaii has received most of its plants that are dispersed by the\r\ncurrents from tropical America.\r\n\r\nWe will now consider how such a possibility is in accordance with the\r\narrangement of the currents in the North Pacific. If we look at the\r\nQuarterly Current Charts for this ocean published by the British\r\nAdmiralty we notice that all through the year the Hawaiian Group lies\r\nmore or less within the area of currents flowing from the West Coast of\r\nAmerica, the Northern Equatorial Currents as they are collectively\r\nnamed. Except in the winter months these currents come from the N.E. and\r\nE.N.E., and bring drift from the coasts of British Columbia, Oregon, and\r\nNorthern California. It is then that they pile up huge pine logs on the\r\nshores of the Hawaiian Islands, as I have described in Chapter VII. and\r\nin Note 30; and, according to Dr. Hillebrand, they transport this drift\r\ntimber much farther south to the shores of the Marshall and Caroline\r\nGroups. One might cite other facts illustrative of the working of these\r\ncurrents, such as one finds in the pages of Fornander and other authors;\r\nbut this would scarcely come within the province of this work. I may\r\nhere remark that when in Honolulu I was informed that a bell-buoy which\r\nhad got adrift on the Californian coast was subsequently washed up on\r\nthe coasts of Kauai. It is stated in Findlay’s “North Pacific Directory”\r\n(1886, p. 1068), that a junk carrying nine hands that had been blown off\r\nthe south coast of Japan in a typhoon, anchored, after ten or eleven\r\nmonths at sea, in December, 1832, near Waialea in Oahu, the view taken\r\nof its course being that after drifting along in the Japan Current it\r\ncame within the range of the south-west current that carries pine timber\r\nto Hawaii from the West Coast of America.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the Northern Equatorial Current that strikes the Hawaiian\r\nGroup during the greater part of the year is no doubt a south-westerly\r\ndeflection of the Japan Current from the American West Coast; and it\r\nwould be impossible to find any tropical drift mingled with the pine\r\nlogs stranded on the islands during that period. However, in the winter\r\nmonths, centering in January, the Japan Current flows down the West\r\nCoast of America to about the latitude of Cape Corrientes on the coast\r\nof Mexico, before being deflected westward. Here it meets with a portion\r\nof the Peruvian Current, and both flow westward, the united stream\r\nstriking probably only the southernmost islands of the Hawaiian Group.\r\nIt is at this season alone that there would be any likelihood of drift\r\nfrom tropical America being stranded on the Hawaiian beaches, and it is\r\nquite possible that at such a time the Northern Equatorial Current may\r\ncarry intermingled in its stream pine logs from Oregon and seed-drift\r\nfrom Panama.\r\n\r\nI am not inclined to attach any value except in the Western Pacific to\r\nthe agency of the Equatorial Counter-Current in transporting seeds and\r\nfruits over the Pacific. It presents seemingly the only opportunity of\r\nthe transportal of the seeds and fruits of Asiatic littoral plants to\r\nAmerica; but if at all effective in this way, it would have endowed the\r\nlittoral flora of the western shores of tropical America with many of\r\nthe trees so characteristic of the coral islands of the Pacific. In this\r\nsense, it has failed completely as an effective agency in\r\nplant-dispersal; and judging by results we may, I think, dismiss it from\r\nour consideration. However, Dr. Hillebrand (p. xv.) assumes that during\r\nthe prevalence of south-westerly gales in winter in the Hawaiian\r\nIslands, the Equatorial Counter-Current would be pushed northward so as\r\nto mingle to the east of the group with the North Equatorial Current. In\r\nthis manner it is supposed that seed-drift brought direct from the\r\nAsiatic side of the Pacific would be stranded on these islands. This\r\nappears to me to be most improbable, since some ten or twelve degrees of\r\nlatitude usually intervene between the Hawaiian Group and the Equatorial\r\nCounter-Current (_see_ Admiralty Sailing Directions, Pacific Islands,\r\n1900, II., 31, and the Quarterly Current Charts; also Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica, vol. 18, p. 118).\r\n\r\nThe most serious objection from the botanist’s standpoint against such a\r\nview as that of Dr. Hillebrand is the absence from Hawaii of most of the\r\nshore-plants that we should expect the currents to have brought from the\r\nOld World. It is also evident that as far as the currents are concerned\r\nthe Hawaiian Islands are far more likely to receive littoral plants from\r\nAmerica than from the Old World. Though no tropical drift has yet been\r\nfound stranded on the coasts of these islands, yet it is not unlikely\r\nthat future investigators may find some seed-drift from Central America\r\non the most southerly coasts of the group, as on the south-east shores\r\nof the large island of Hawaii. It would only be stranded in the winter\r\nmonths and then probably in small quantities.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Summary of the Chapter._\r\n\r\n(_a_) Since the effective operations of the currents are limited to the\r\nshore-plants with buoyant seeds or fruits, such plants forming but a\r\nsmall proportion of any flora, it must be acknowledged that, numerically\r\nspeaking, the results of the dispersing-agency of the currents on\r\nplant-distribution in general are but slight.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Yet the importance of the subject is by no means to be measured by\r\na numerical scale of results, a line of inquiry being here opened up\r\nleading to fields of investigation full of promise for the student of\r\nplant-distribution.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Whilst dealing with the relation between the distribution of\r\nshore-plants and the arrangement of the currents, it is quite legitimate\r\nto discuss the currents of the Pacific from the point of view of the\r\nbotanist, who, after all, must take his cue from the drifting seed and\r\nthe resulting distribution of the plant.\r\n\r\n(_d_) The shore-plants of the Pacific islands that are dispersed by the\r\ncurrents being mainly Indo-Malayan in origin, it follows that they have\r\nextended eastward over the Pacific to the Tahitian islands against the\r\nstream of the South Equatorial Current and against the trade-wind. It\r\nis, however, shown that they could have availed themselves of the\r\ninterval between January and March when the North-west Monsoon reaches\r\nthe Pacific.\r\n\r\n(_e_) It is claimed that whilst the mangroves and their associated\r\nplants have for the most part entered the Pacific by the Melanesian\r\nroute through the Solomon Islands, the beach-plants have also followed\r\nthe route through Micronesia by the Caroline, Marshall, and Ellice\r\nGroups.\r\n\r\n(_f_) A small number of the strand-plants of the Pacific islands that\r\nare dispersed by currents occur in America as well as in the Old World;\r\nand questions of prime importance arise when we have to decide whether\r\ntheir home is in the Old World or in the New World.\r\n\r\n(_g_) Good reasons are given for regarding them as chiefly of American\r\norigin; and it is shown that America with regard to the arrangement of\r\nthe currents stands in the singular relation of being a disperser but\r\nnot a recipient of shore-plants.\r\n\r\n(_h_) It is pointed out that the tropical shore-plants that are\r\ndistributed by currents belong to two great regions which are the effect\r\nof the present arrangement of the currents, viz., the American including\r\nthe West Coast of Africa, and the Asiatic comprising the remainder of\r\nthe tropical zone. Each region has its own plants, and those that occur\r\nin both, being in fact distributed all round the tropics, are regarded,\r\naccording to the principle above stated, as having their home in the\r\nAmerican region.\r\n\r\n(_i_) The occurrence of the same strand species on the Pacific and\r\nAtlantic coasts of tropical America is regarded as indicating that the\r\narrangement of the existing species of its shore-plants, more\r\nparticularly of the mangroves, antedates the emergence of the Panama\r\nIsthmus. This hypothesis is not needed for the coast plants like Entada\r\nscandens that occur inland, since we can now observe their seeds being\r\ncarried down into the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans by rivers draining the\r\nopposite slopes of the same “divide” in the Panama Isthmus.\r\n\r\n(_j_) It is shown that the currents of the Pacific have failed to\r\nestablish the numerous beach-trees (possessing buoyant fruits) of the\r\nPacific islands, not only in the Hawaiian Group, but also on the coast\r\nof America; and it is therefore argued that we should expect the\r\nHawaiian Group to have received through the currents its shore-plants\r\nwith buoyant seeds or fruits from the tropical west coasts of America.\r\n\r\n(_k_) In support of this contention it is pointed out that most of the\r\nHawaiian strand-plants that are dispersed by the currents are found in\r\nAmerica, and some indeed in America to the exclusion of the Old World.\r\n\r\n(_l_) The arrangement of the currents in the North Pacific also favours\r\nthe view that the Hawaiian Islands are more likely to receive plants by\r\nthe agency of the currents from America than from the Asiatic side of\r\nthe Pacific.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                   THE GERMINATION OF FLOATING SEEDS\r\n\r\nGermination in the floating seed-drift of tropical estuaries.—A strain\r\n  of vivipary.—Abortive germination of seeds in warm seas.—A barrier to\r\n  plant dispersal.—The borderland of vivipary.— Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE tendency of the floating seed or fruit to germinate in the estuaries\r\nof tropical rivers is especially characteristic of the plants of the\r\nmangrove-swamps and of their borders. In the Fijian rivers, and\r\nparticularly in the estuary of the Rewa, where the river-water is\r\nusually mixed with that of the sea, there are frequently to be found in\r\na state of germination floating fruits of Barringtonia racemosa, Carapa\r\nobovata, Clerodendron inerme, Derris uliginosa, Smythea pacifica, &c.;\r\nwhilst the floating fruits of more characteristic beach-trees like\r\nBarringtonia speciosa and Cerbera Odollam, that grow also on the sides\r\nof the estuaries, were never noticed in this condition. That this\r\ntendency should be restricted to the plants of the mangrove-formation\r\nand is not to be observed in the beach-trees is a singular fact. There\r\nis, however, an intermediate group of littoral plants mostly belonging\r\nto genera of the Leguminosæ and Convolvulaceæ, such as Mucuna and\r\nIpomœa, where germination of the floating seed is apt to begin but ends\r\nabortively, and results in the sinking and death of the seed. The\r\nsubject of the germination of seeds in the floating drift of tropical\r\nestuaries presents itself, therefore, in three aspects:—\r\n\r\n(1) As concerning the plants of the mangrove-formation, where, excluding\r\nthe viviparous species (when germination takes place on the plant),\r\ngermination is frequent in the water:\r\n\r\n(2) As concerning the beach-trees where it is rare or absent altogether:\r\n\r\n(3) As concerning certain Leguminous and Convolvulaceous littoral plants\r\nwhere germination is not infrequent but always abortive.\r\n\r\nDealing first with the plants of the mangrove-formation, it may be\r\nremarked that the same tendency of the floating fruits or seeds to\r\ngerminate, which is above noticed in the case of the estuaries of Fiji,\r\ncame under my observation in the floating drift of the estuary of the\r\nGuayaquil River in Ecuador, the germinating fruits and seeds being\r\ncarried far out to sea. The seeds of Anona paludosa, which float in\r\nquantities in the river-drift, were often found germinating; and the\r\nsame may be said of the fruits of Laguncularia racemosa and of the\r\n“joints” of Salicornia peruviana which abound in the creeks of the\r\nmangrove-delta and are carried out to sea in the germinating condition.\r\n\r\nIt might be expected that this readiness to germinate in the brackish\r\nwater of estuaries would prove to be a formidable obstacle to the\r\ndispersal of these plants over wide tracts of ocean. The exposed\r\nportions of the seedling might be deemed ill-suited to withstand,\r\nwithout injury, the “wear-and-tear” of transport by currents over long\r\ndistances, even when not affected by the sea-water; and it might be\r\nthought that they would be often nibbled off by fish or destroyed by\r\nother aquatic animals. Only the specially organised seedlings produced\r\nby a viviparous process on the tree, such as those of Rhizophora and\r\nBruguiera, might be regarded as able to survive the effects of prolonged\r\nimmersion in the oceanic currents.\r\n\r\nObservation, indeed, shows that such seedlings are exposed to and suffer\r\nfrom these perils; yet it is evident from the distribution of the\r\nspecies that, whether in the germinating condition or not, the seeds and\r\nfruits of Anona paludosa and Laguncularia racemosa have been carried by\r\nthe currents from America to the West Coast of Africa. The seedlings of\r\nAvicennia and of Rhizophora mangle have also performed the same\r\ntrans-Atlantic voyage. Those of both these mangroves are to be observed\r\nfloating off the coasts and in the estuaries of both coasts of America.\r\nThe seedlings of Avicennia are particularly abundant in the\r\nmangrove-creeks of the delta of the Guayaquil River; and I observed them\r\nin a healthy condition, ten to twenty miles out at sea, floating\r\ntogether with those of the Rhizophora. Since, as in the case of\r\nRhizophora, germination occurs normally on the plant, Avicennia can only\r\nbe dispersed by its floating seedlings. Yet it is noteworthy that\r\nalthough Avicennia seedlings appear, to a marked degree, less fitted for\r\nocean transport than those of Rhizophora and Bruguiera, the species have\r\na much wider distribution. Avicennia officinalis has a cosmopolitan\r\ndistribution in the tropics and beyond, occurring as it does on the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific coasts of America, on both coasts of Africa, over\r\nAsia and Australia, as well as in New Caledonia and New Zealand, but not\r\nin Polynesia (_Bot. Chall. Exped._, III., 178).... I have now gone far\r\nenough to show that the tendency displayed by the seeds and fruits of\r\nseveral of the plants of the mangrove-formation to germinate either on\r\nthe tree or in the floating drift of estuaries has not affected the\r\ngeneral distribution of the species in its main outlines. Few fruits are\r\nfound more often in a germinating condition in the floating drift of the\r\nRewa River in Fiji than those of Barringtonia racemosa, yet the species\r\nranges from the African East Coast eastward to Polynesia. Seedlings as\r\nwell as seeds or fruits, whether or not in a germinating condition, are,\r\ntherefore, able in such cases to disperse the species.\r\n\r\nThis readiness of the floating fruits of plants of the mangrove\r\nformation (excluding the viviparous species) to germinate in the\r\nestuaries is, I am inclined to think, due in the main to the strain of\r\nvivipary that runs through nearly all the plants of the mangrove-swamp\r\nand of its borders. It would, indeed, appear that the viviparous habit\r\n(the capacity of germinating on the plant) which finds its extreme\r\ndevelopment in Rhizophora and Bruguiera of the Fijian swamps is\r\nrepresented in its earliest stage in the readiness of the floating\r\nfruits of Barringtonia racemosa, Carapa obovata, &c., to germinate in\r\nthe Fijian estuaries, and as remarked in Note 37 there is a suspicion of\r\nvivipary in the instances of both the species just named. Intermediate\r\ncases, as that of Laguncularia in the Ecuador swamps, occur in other\r\nregions with species where germination only takes place at times on the\r\nplant. This subject is, however, generally discussed in Chapter XXX. and\r\nneed not be further dealt with here.\r\n\r\nA predisposing cause of the germination of floating seeds and fruits in\r\ntropical estuaries would seem to be afforded by the super-heating of the\r\nwater of the estuary. This came under my notice both in the Rewa River\r\nin Fiji and in the Guayaquil River in Ecuador, where the water of the\r\nestuary is often noticed to be some degrees warmer than that of the sea\r\noutside, and of the water from the river above the estuary. (See Note\r\n38.)\r\n\r\nWe come now to the subject of the non-germination in tropical estuaries\r\nof the floating fruits of the beach-trees, such as Barringtonia speciosa\r\nand Cerbera Odollam, that in the Pacific islands may contribute to\r\nriver-drift. Such trees may grow on the banks of the estuary, and their\r\nfruits would thus readily fall into the water; but in the Rewa estuary\r\nin Fiji it was evident that the fruits and seeds of beach-plants, such\r\nas Scævola Koenigii, are also brought in by the tide. The seeds of\r\nMorinda citrifolia were often noticed in the Rewa drift together with\r\nthe fruits of Heritiera littoralis, which is both a beach and a swamp\r\nplant, but never in a germinating condition. The same remark applies\r\nalso to the fruits of beach trees found afloat in the sea between the\r\nislands, such as Cordia subcordata, Guettarda speciosa, and Terminalia.\r\nIt is possible that a few of these plants, as in the case of\r\nBarringtonia speciosa, display traces in the structure of their fruits\r\nof a lost viviparous habit. (See Note 50.) It is pointed out in\r\ndiscussing Guettarda that germination is much more easily induced than\r\none would expect in the case of fruits with such a hard ligneous\r\nputamen.\r\n\r\nAn interesting subject is presented in the abortive germination of the\r\nfloating seeds of many plants of the Leguminosæ and Convolvulaceæ both\r\nat sea and in a tropical estuary. My conclusions on this matter are\r\nbased partly on observations made in Fiji, but mainly on the results of\r\nnumbers of experiments, this being unavoidable, since the abortive\r\ngermination causes the sinking of the seed. The principal determining\r\ncause of the germination in water of one of these floating seeds is\r\nevidently to be sought in the temperature of the water, it being\r\nimmaterial for the earliest stage of germination, as many of my\r\nexperiments indicate, whether the seed or fruit is afloat in the sea or\r\nin the river. In these flotation experiments, when conducted under warm\r\nconditions with sea-water, the earliest signs of germination were\r\nfrequently displayed in the softening, swelling, and sinking of the\r\nseed. If the swelling seed is taken out in time and planted after a\r\npreliminary soaking in fresh water, the germinating process is at once\r\nresumed and is often successfully and rapidly completed; but if the seed\r\nis allowed to remain in the vessel after it has absorbed sea-water the\r\nvitality of the embryo is destroyed and the seed decays.\r\n\r\nThat many seeds would fail from this cause to cross an ocean my\r\nexperiments repeatedly demonstrated. Nor does the appearance of a seed\r\nafford any indication of its probable failure to cross an ocean. Some\r\nseeds of Mucuna, as far as their hard coverings could guide one, would\r\nseem to be quite secure from such a risk. The stony seeds, for instance,\r\nof M. urens D.C. look as if they might safely be transported by the\r\ncurrents round and round the globe; and De Candolle very rightly placed\r\nthis species in his scanty list of plants dispersed by currents. Yet few\r\nseeds are more treacherous when their buoyancy in sea-water is tested in\r\na warm place, as in a hot-house. They may take up water, swell, and sink\r\nin a week, or they may float unharmed for a year.\r\n\r\nThe seeds most exposed to this risk are those of the Leguminous giant\r\nclimbers, the lianes of the coast and inland forests of the islands of\r\nthe tropical Pacific. They belong to the genera Mucuna, Strongylodon,\r\n&c.; and thus several of the plants that constitute for the student of\r\nplant-dispersal the enigmas of the Pacific are here included. The seeds\r\nof Mucuna are especially liable when afloat in sea-water under warm\r\nconditions to display the early signs of germination, swelling up and\r\nsinking to the bottom of the vessel, a process, however, soon arrested\r\nand followed by the death of the embryo unless the seed is removed in\r\ntime. Yet the seeds of this genus are notably long “floaters.” Those of\r\nan American species, variously designated as Mucuna pruriens D.C. and M.\r\nurens D.C., have long been known to be washed ashore together with the\r\nseeds of Entada scandens on the western shores of Europe, and\r\nparticularly on the Scandinavian coast, where they form regular\r\nconstituents of what the Scandinavian botanists correctly term the\r\nGulf-stream Drift.\r\n\r\nMucuna urens D.C. occurs with other American shore-plants that are\r\ndispersed by the currents on the African West Coast; and there is no\r\nreason to doubt that its seeds perform the trans-Atlantic voyage. It is\r\nfound in Polynesia, in Hawaii, in the Marquesas, and according to\r\nReinecke also in Samoa; and probably it occurs in other groups. The\r\nspecific determinations of the genus, however, need thorough\r\noverhauling, so that it is not possible to deal more than in general\r\nterms with the distribution of a species. The distribution of Mucuna\r\nurens in the Pacific is, however, irregular, and no doubt this is to be\r\nconnected with the uncertain behaviour of its seeds when transported by\r\ntropical currents. The seeds would, I venture to think, often sink\r\nthrough abortive germination in the warm areas of equatorial seas.\r\n\r\nWhen in Hawaii I kept ten of the seeds of this species (M. urens D.C.)\r\nin sea-water for four and a half months, none of them sinking in that\r\nperiod, the temperature of the water rarely reaching over 80°F., the\r\naverage daily temperature being 76-77°. However, when four years\r\nafterwards in England I placed five of the seeds obtained at the same\r\ntime in sea-water under conditions where the water-temperature ranged\r\nfor the first few weeks between 75° and 90°, three of them began to\r\nswell within ten days, and on removal at once germinated healthily. The\r\nremaining two were afloat at the end of twelve months, and when planted\r\none of them germinated a month afterwards.\r\n\r\nHaving experimented on the seeds of about half a dozen different species\r\nof Mucuna in sea-water, all with buoyant qualities, it is possible for\r\nme to lay down the general rule for the buoyant seeds of the genus that\r\nsinking is the result of an attempt at germination, which, as before\r\nobserved, proves abortive unless the seed is removed in time. It is\r\nobvious that the gardener wishing to raise plants of this genus without\r\ndelay might profitably adopt the method of keeping them afloat in water\r\nat a temperature of 80-90° F. until they begin to swell, which may\r\nhappen in some cases in a few days. Sea-water seems to produce the most\r\nrapid results.\r\n\r\nWhen on Keeling Atoll in the Indian Ocean I collected, amongst the\r\nstranded seed-drift brought by the currents to those islands, the seeds\r\nof five or six species of Mucuna, two of which were identified at Kew as\r\nM. macrocarpa, Wall., and M. gigantea D.C. (see my paper on the\r\ndispersal of plants at Keeling Atoll). No plant of this genus appears up\r\nto that time to have been recorded from the Keeling Islands, so that at\r\nall events most if not all of the seeds had been brought by the currents\r\nfrom the Indian Archipelago, some 700 miles away. It may be added that\r\namongst the drift gathered by me on the south coast of Java the seeds of\r\nthree species of Mucuna were identified at Kew, including the two\r\nabove-named species from Keeling Atoll.\r\n\r\nThese current-borne seeds of the Keeling beaches had probably performed\r\nan ocean journey of a thousand miles, since the route could scarcely\r\nhave been direct. Yet their behaviour when placed eighteen months after\r\nin sea-water in a hothouse in England was most erratic. Of three seeds\r\nof Mucuna gigantea all swelled and sank within eight days. Two seeds of\r\nM. macrocarpa sank after floating from sixty to a hundred days; whilst\r\nof two seeds of another species both remained afloat after a year. In a\r\nsea-water experiment in England on five Hawaiian seeds of M. gigantea,\r\nunder the conditions referred to in the Mucuna urens experiment, one\r\nsank within ten days, whilst three of them were afloat after twelve\r\nmonths, one of them subsequently germinating. This species, it may be\r\nremarked, is widely distributed as a coast plant over tropical Asia,\r\nAustralia, and in Polynesia. It seems to take the place in the Old World\r\nwhich Mucuna urens takes in America, and it is curious that they meet in\r\nPolynesia, being sometimes associated as in Hawaii. In the chapter on my\r\nobservations in Ecuador and in Panama it is remarked that Mucuna seeds\r\nare frequent constituents of river, sea, and stranded drift. I,\r\ntherefore, have enjoyed the opportunity of observing the behaviour of\r\nthe seeds of this genus in a variety of localities, namely, in the\r\nKeeling Islands, in West Java, in Fiji, Hawaii, and tropical America;\r\nand this may be pleaded as an excuse for entering into so much detail\r\nrespecting them.\r\n\r\nThe large seeds of Strongylodon lucidum (S. ruber), a Leguminous liane\r\nthat ranks with the species of Mucuna amongst the huge climbers of the\r\nforest of the Pacific islands, behaved in a similar way in my flotation\r\nexperiments in sea-water. Though, as shown in Note 3, these seeds can\r\nfloat for a year and retain their germinating power, some of them\r\nbrought their buoyant capacity prematurely to an end by an abortive\r\nattempt at germination. These black rounded seeds form a common object\r\namongst the river seed-drift stranded on some of the Fijian beaches in\r\nthe vicinity of estuaries. They are so hard and durable that they are\r\nmounted in brooches in Honolulu. Yet these pebble-like seeds will\r\nsometimes begin to swell in a few days in sea-water. Out of five seeds\r\nplaced in sea-water in England under warm conditions (the water\r\ntemperature for the first few weeks ranging between 75° and 90° F.), one\r\nswelled and sank within ten days, another did so after two months,\r\nwhilst the other three were afloat after twelve months, and one of them\r\nsubsequently germinated. There is some disagreement amongst botanists as\r\nto the limits of the specific characters of the plants of this genus\r\n(see Note 39); but the plan seemingly most in accord with the\r\nfundamental principles regulating plant-distribution in this region of\r\nthe Pacific is to regard the forms found in Hawaii, Tahiti, and Fiji, as\r\nreferable to one species. In addition to the Polynesian forms there are\r\nonly two or three species, found in the Philippines, Madagascar, and\r\nCeylon, and it is with the species from the last-named locality that the\r\nPolynesian species is by some identified.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of several other Leguminous climbers would probably act in a\r\nsimilar way, for instance, those of Entada scandens; but the seeds of\r\nthis plant experimented on by me were too few to enable an opinion to be\r\nformed. Of four seeds of Dioclea violacea from Fiji that were subjected\r\nto the same experiment as those of Strongylodon lucidum, all floated in\r\nsea-water after a year, with the exception of one that did not swell and\r\nsink until after ten months. On the other hand, in my experiment in Fiji\r\non the fresh seeds of Canavalia obtusifolia, a plant found on tropical\r\nbeaches all round the globe, seventy per cent. sank in the first six or\r\nseven weeks, swelling and displaying the first signs of germination, but\r\nquite ten per cent. were afloat after three months.\r\n\r\nMy experiments on the foregoing and other littoral species of the\r\nLeguminosæ merely indicate that under the ordinary temperature of\r\ntropical currents a portion of the seeds will probably sink owing to\r\nabortive attempts at germination. It is likely that if in the\r\nexperiments in England a constant temperature of 85° to 90° F. had been\r\nsustained throughout, most if not all of the seeds would have swelled\r\nand sunk within a month or two. The temperature of the experiments in\r\nFiji and Hawaii did not exceed that of many tropical currents; but there\r\nare areas of superheating in equatorial seas, which I think would prove\r\ninsurmountable barriers in the path of most drifting Leguminous seeds, a\r\nsubject to which further reference will be made.\r\n\r\nComing to the Convolvulaceæ, my experiments show that the buoyant seeds\r\noften lose their floating powers from the same cause. Those of Ipomœa\r\npes capræ may be taken as an example. I was surprised to find when\r\nexperimenting on the buoyancy in sea-water of these seeds in Fiji and\r\nHawaii that a considerable proportion, about a third, sank in the first\r\ntwo months, swelling and sinking to the bottom. That this swelling\r\nrepresented the early stage of germination was well brought out in\r\nparallel experiments in fresh water and sea-water made in England on the\r\nbuoyant seeds of the British littoral species, Convolvulus soldanella. A\r\ngood proportion of the seeds in the first part of the experiment\r\nabsorbed water, swelled, and sank, those in fresh water proceeding at\r\nonce to germinate healthily at the bottom, whilst those that sank in\r\nsea-water merely decayed. Of the survivors about fifty per cent. in\r\neither case floated after six months. It may be added that the seeds of\r\nother tropical littoral species, such as those of Ipomœa glaberrima and\r\nI. grandiflora, behaved in the same way.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from my experiments, and it is a result that we should\r\nexpect, that buoyant seeds of the Leguminosæ and Convolvulaceæ would\r\noften float for much longer periods under cool than under warm\r\nconditions. There must be areas of high temperature in mid-ocean that\r\nwould prove much more fatal to the chances of a drifting tropical seed\r\nthan the icy waters of a Polar current. In my paper on Keeling Atoll I\r\nhave described how I procured the germination of a seed of Ipomœa\r\ngrandiflora, Lam., after a year’s flotation in sea-water in London,\r\nwhich included a period of three weeks when the water temperature was at\r\nor about 32° F. These seeds from this point of view would be exposed to\r\nmuch more risk of sinking through abortive attempts at germination when\r\ndrifting across some parts of the Pacific Ocean. It would appear from\r\nthe Admiralty Chart of Surface-Temperatures, published in 1884, that\r\nsuch an area with a surface-temperature of 83° to 86° throughout the\r\nyear extends north and east of New Guinea well into the Pacific,\r\nreaching in the first half of the year as far east as the Tahitian\r\nregion. It would seem highly probable that the immersion of Leguminous\r\nor Convolvulaceous seeds for many months in these tepid waters would in\r\nmost if not in all cases induce incipient germination which would lead\r\nto the sinking of the seed. There are, however, exceptional cases, as\r\nthat of Cæsalpinia bonducella, which, as my experiments recorded in\r\nChapter XVII. indicate, appear to be quite proof against any conditions\r\nof temperature such as are likely to be found in tropical seas in the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nThere are a few general considerations arising out of the foregoing\r\nobservations to which reference may now be made. The study of the\r\nbehaviour of the floating seed or fruit often carries us, as I have\r\nbefore implied, to the borderland of vivipary. When from a canoe on a\r\nFijian river we lift up the germinating fruit of Barringtonia racemosa\r\nfrom amongst the drift floating past in the stream and pull down from\r\nthe branches overhead the seedling a foot in length of Rhizophora, we\r\nhold in our hands the two extremes of the series of vivipary. With many\r\nof the plants of the mangrove-formation there is a fine adjustment with\r\nrespect to the germinating capacity of the seed, or in other words a\r\ndelicate balancing of organisation on one side and of physical\r\nconditions on the other. A slight disturbance of the equilibrium would\r\nproduce great results in plant distribution. Thus, an elevation of the\r\ntemperature of the sea-water in the tropics to 90° F. would, I\r\napprehend, produce the abortive germination of nearly every floating\r\nseed and fruit in equatorial seas, even of those of the beach-trees like\r\nBarringtonia speciosa and Terminalia littoralis that are regarded as\r\nproof against such risks under existing conditions where the\r\nsurface-temperatures would average 78° to 80°.\r\n\r\nThere would thus be a barrier to the dispersal of plants by currents as\r\neffective as that of a frozen ocean. In the warm, humid climates of the\r\nearly geological ages, seed-transport by currents may have been often\r\nimpossible, since the seeds that did not begin to germinate on the\r\nplants of the swamps would probably do so in the tepid water of the sea.\r\nViviparous plants would, however, be placed at no greater disadvantage\r\nthan they are at present, since the genera Rhizophora, Avicennia, and\r\nothers are now only dispersed by the floating seedlings. But such an\r\nincrease of temperature at the present time would mean the death in the\r\ncurrent of the floating seeds and fruits of nearly all non-viviparous\r\nshore-plants. As a rule every Leguminous and Convolvulaceous seed would\r\nswell up and go to the bottom; whilst fruits like those of Barringtonia\r\nracemosa and Carapa obovata, that often germinate afloat in tropical\r\nestuaries, would invariably do so under the changed conditions, and the\r\nseedlings not being adapted for ocean transport would perish.\r\n\r\nYet we know that with the seeds of many inland plants temperature has\r\nseemingly very little to do with starting the process of germination. We\r\nare familiar with the fact that the seeds of many plants that fail to\r\ngerminate in the summer of their production habitually germinate under\r\napparently less favourable conditions of temperature in the following\r\nspring. This is attributed by botanists to the immaturity of the seed on\r\nfirst falling from the plant, a further period of maturation being\r\nnecessary before, under any conditions, germination is possible.\r\n\r\nWe see this also well illustrated in the floating seeds and fruits of\r\nthe Thames drift. Most of them fail to germinate in the drift at the end\r\nof the summer and the beginning of autumn, and defer the process until\r\nthe following spring, when they germinate freely in the water under much\r\ncooler conditions than those which they experienced in the early part of\r\ntheir flotation in the drift. There are, however, exceptions to this\r\nrule. Plants like Caltha palustris, for instance, are rarely represented\r\nin the spring seed-drift of ponds and rivers, because most of the fruits\r\nor seeds germinated soon after falling into the water in the previous\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nIn most of my sea-water experiments in England the immersion had a very\r\nmarked influence, not in causing premature germination and destroying\r\nthe germinating capacity, as often happens with the floating seeds of\r\nConvolvulaceæ and Leguminosæ, especially in the tropics, but in\r\npostponing without injury to the seed the process of reproducing the\r\nplant. Such seeds or fruits when placed in fresh water after many months\r\nof flotation in sea-water germinated very freely in a few days, whilst\r\nthose left in the sea-water under precisely the same conditions remained\r\nunchanged. This is true of many of the seeds and fruits found in the\r\nThames drift, such as those of Ranunculus repens, Lycopus europæus,\r\nRumex, &c. A striking instance was also afforded by the seeds of\r\nArenaria (Honckeneya) peploides, where seeds transferred directly to\r\nfresh water, after many months flotation in sea-water, germinated in a\r\nfew days; whilst those left in the sea-water remained unchanged. This\r\nsubject is discussed at length in Note 19, and needs no further mention\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nIf the seeds of many plants in Great Britain postpone through immaturity\r\ntheir germination to the following or even to the second spring, it goes\r\nwithout saying that this does not exclude temperature as the ultimate\r\ndetermining factor in germination. The immaturity of seeds adds another\r\nlink to the series of the germination-range in plants. This range begins\r\nwith the plants where germination takes place on the tree and the\r\nseedlings hang suspended from the branches, as in the typical mangroves\r\nRhizophora and Bruguiera. Here, as is shown in Chapter XXX., there is\r\nevidently no period of repose between the completion of the maturation\r\nof the seed and the commencement of germination. The range ends with the\r\ndetachment of immature seeds which ripen apart from the parent plant,\r\nand may postpone the germinating process for months and often for years.\r\nAll intermediate stages exist between these two extremes. Thus the\r\nseedling may at once detach itself from the parent as in Avicennia, or\r\nthe germinating process on the plant may be limited to the protrusion of\r\nthe radicle as in Laguncularia, or the seeds may be quite mature and\r\nready to germinate as soon as they fall to the ground, as we find with\r\nmany small seeded plants. All the stages, of which only a few are here\r\nindicated, are full of suggestiveness for the student of plant-life.\r\n\r\nThis subject is dealt with from other standpoints in Chapter XXX., but\r\nthe reader will now see more clearly what was meant when I said that the\r\nstudy of the behaviour of the floating seed leads us to the borderland\r\nof vivipary. In this range of the germinating process we may possess an\r\nepitome of the history of the climatic conditions of plant-life from an\r\nearly era in the world’s story, beginning with those ages when perhaps\r\nunder the uniform conditions that then prevailed, all plants were more\r\nor less coast-plants and more or less viviparous, and coming down to the\r\npresent era when with an extensive and varied land-surface there is\r\ngreat variety both in climate and in the range of germination. The\r\nmangrove-swamp and its viviparous trees would thus represent from this\r\npoint of view a condition of things once more or less universal on the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Summary of the Chapter._\r\n\r\n(_a_) The tendency of the floating seed or fruit to germinate in the\r\nbrackish water of tropical estuaries is especially characteristic of the\r\nplants of the mangrove-swamp and their vicinity; but with those of the\r\nbeach trees that occur in the river-drift it is rarely if at all to be\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n(_b_) From the wide distribution of plants of the mangrove-formation it\r\nis evident that this readiness of the floating seed or fruit to\r\ngerminate is not prejudicial to the dispersal of the species.\r\n\r\n(_c_) It may perhaps be in the main attributed to a strain of vivipary\r\nrunning through all the plants of the mangrove-formation, which finds\r\nits extreme development in the viviparous species, where germination\r\ntakes place on the tree. But it is probably favoured by the superheating\r\nof the waters of tropical estuaries.\r\n\r\n(_d_) In the case of the buoyant seeds of several climbers and creepers\r\nof the Leguminosæ and Convolvulaceæ, more or less littoral in their\r\nstation, it is shown that in warm water, whether fresh or salt, a good\r\nproportion are apt to sink through incipient germination, which results\r\nwhen the experiment is made in sea-water in the death of the embryo.\r\n\r\n(_e_) Though in tropical currents of ordinary temperature a good number\r\nof such floating seeds would escape this risk, it is argued that there\r\nare certain warm areas in the tropical seas that would prove much more\r\nfatal to the chances of these drifting Leguminous and Convolvulaceous\r\nseeds than the icy waters of a polar current. It is thus held that these\r\nseeds often sink in mid-ocean in tropical latitudes through abortive\r\ngermination.\r\n\r\n(_f_) The study of the behaviour of the floating seed or fruit leads us\r\nto the borderland of vivipary. In the scale of the germinative capacity\r\nof plants it is possible to arrange a continuous series that commencing\r\nwith the mangroves, where germination takes place on the tree, ends with\r\nthose numerous inland plants where seeds are liberated in an immature\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n(_g_) It is suggested that the viviparous habit may have been the rule\r\nunder the uniform climatic conditions of early geological periods and\r\nthat with the differentiation of climates that marked the emergence and\r\nextension of the continental areas the viviparous habit has been lost,\r\nexcept in those regions of the mangrove-swamps which to some extent\r\nretain the climatic conditions once general over the globe. With\r\ndifferentiation of climate the true seed-stage with its varying\r\nrest-periods has been developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE RELATION OF THE BUOYANCY OF SEEDS AND SEEDVESSELS TO THE DENSITY OF\r\n                               SEA-WATER\r\n\r\nThe general principles concerned.—The subject assumes a statistical\r\n  character.—Seeds and seedvessels are as a rule either much heavier\r\n  than sea-water or much lighter than fresh water.—The present littoral\r\n  plants with buoyant seeds or seedvessels could be equally well\r\n  dispersed by currents in oceans of fresh water.—Seed-buoyancy has no\r\n  relation either in the present or in the past to the density of the\r\n  sea.—Though an accidental attribute, the specific weight of seeds has\r\n  had a profound influence on plant-distribution.—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO find amongst the results of my numerous experiments examples\r\nillustrating the influence of density on flotation has not been so easy\r\nas I at first imagined. Excluding all adventitious causes of buoyancy, a\r\nmatter discussed in Note 40, it may be inferred that the great majority\r\nof seeds and fruits sink both in fresh water and sea-water. Of those\r\nthat are buoyant many float indefinitely in both waters, whilst in a\r\nvery few cases, where the floating power is derived from an outer fleshy\r\ncovering, as with the fruits of Potamogeton natans, the fruits float a\r\nmuch shorter time in sea-water than in fresh water, on account of the\r\ninjurious effect of the salt upon their coats.\r\n\r\nExperiments have to be specially directed towards this subject. It would\r\nbe useless to experiment in fresh water at one time and in sea-water a\r\nmonth later. Nor would it answer to employ seeds and fruits from\r\ndifferent localities, since variations in this way sometimes occur. It\r\nis necessary that the experiments should be made on seeds or fruits\r\ncollected at the same time and place, and that they should be\r\nsimultaneous and carried on under the same conditions. As the discussion\r\nproceeds, the reader will perceive that many interesting points are\r\nopened up, and that such an investigation, instead of being, as the\r\ntitle of this chapter might suggest, an abstruse and disconnected\r\ninquiry, is of considerable importance in relation to the dispersal of\r\nplants through the agency of currents.\r\n\r\nGuided by the results of my experiments in this direction I will proceed\r\nto lay down certain general principles:—\r\n\r\n(A) In the first place it may be accepted as a general rule that _seeds\r\nor seedvessels that sink in fresh water sink also in sea-water_, the\r\ndifference in density between the two being rarely a factor of any\r\nimportance in determining buoyancy. The great majority of seeds and\r\nfruits come under this category, since, as is pointed out in Chapter\r\nVIII., only a small proportion of the whole, say a tenth, possess\r\nfloating power. We might cite, as illustrative of this principle in\r\ntemperate regions, almost all the 240 species included in the\r\nnon-buoyant group of the British plants experimented on (see Chapter\r\nIII. and Note 10). As a general rule this is true alike of the small\r\nseeds of the Cruciferæ and Scrophulariaceæ, of the nutlets of the\r\nLabiatæ and Boragineæ, of the genus Scirpus, and of the dust-like seeds\r\nof Juncus. The results of my experiments on the plants of the tropical\r\nPacific are no doubt typical of other tropical regions; and if I wished\r\nto quote instances, I should have to enumerate not only most of the\r\nplants without buoyant seeds or fruits that are mentioned in the Fijian\r\nand Hawaiian lists given under Notes 2, 4, and 6, but also to appeal to\r\ntropical regions generally.\r\n\r\n(B) One can carry the principle above-named yet further and say that not\r\nonly as a rule do seeds or fruits that sink in fresh water sink also in\r\nsea-water, but that so far as tested _many of them sink in water of much\r\ngreater density than that of ordinary sea-water_ (1·026). Thus, for\r\ninstance, the seeds of Nuphar luteum, Scrophularia aquatica, and\r\nStellaria aquatica, the nutlets of Polygonum persicaria, and the achenes\r\nof Aster tripolium sank in sea-water the density of which had been\r\nraised to 1·050, the limit of the experiment. The minute seeds of Juncus\r\ncommunis and J. glaucus and the larger seeds of Luzula campestris, even\r\nafter drying for six months, sank in salt water having a density of\r\n1·075. It would, however, seem probable that for most of these small\r\nseeds and seedvessels a density of 1·100 would prove to be the critical\r\npoint. If this is so, then most of those that sink in sea-water would\r\nfloat in the dense water (1·160) of the Dead Sea.\r\n\r\nHowever, my investigations have only gone a small way in this direction;\r\nand perhaps some of my readers will pursue the inquiry. I will take the\r\ncase of the nutlets of Scirpus palustris. They sink in fresh water and\r\nin sea-water, or may float in rare cases for a day or two. Out of 100 of\r\nthese seed-like fruits, 25 floated in salt water of a density of 1·075,\r\n13 in water of 1·050, 7 in sea-water (1·025), and 3 in fresh water,\r\n(1·000). It would thus appear that the proportion of buoyant nutlets is\r\ndoubled with every increase of ·025 of the density scale. At this rate\r\nof increase they would all float in salt water of a density of 1·125,\r\nwhich may be regarded as the suitable medium for the flotation of the\r\nfruits of this Scirpus.... The seeds of Glaucium luteum, the Sea-Poppy,\r\nhave no buoyancy either in fresh water or in sea-water even after\r\nprolonged drying. They all sank in water of a density of 1·050, but 18\r\nper cent. floated when the density was raised to 1·075. At the rate of\r\nincrease noticed in the case of Scirpus palustris, all the seeds would\r\nfloat in water of a density of 1·130-1·140.... The acorns of the Common\r\nOak (Quercus robur) have usually but little buoyancy unless they have\r\nbeen long drying. After soaking in fresh water for half an hour 100\r\nmature fruits, without the cupule, that had been kept a fortnight, I\r\nfound that only 2 floated in fresh water, 6 in sea-water (1·025), and 18\r\nin water of 1·050. At this rate of increase all would float in water\r\nhaving a density of 1·080-1·090.\r\n\r\n(C) There is also another general rule, and it is this:—_Seeds or fruits\r\nthat float for a long time in sea-water usually float almost as long in\r\nfresh water_. Here belong the greater number of buoyant seeds and\r\nfruits, those only able to float for a few weeks being comparatively\r\nfew. Now with the long-floating seeds and fruits, those for instance\r\nthat float in the drift of English rivers from the autumn to the spring,\r\nor those that are transported by currents over the tropical zone, there\r\nis, as a rule, but a slight difference between their flotation periods\r\nin fresh water and sea-water. If one of them sinks after floating for\r\nseveral months in fresh water, it will sink in sea-water a few days\r\nafter. Fruits of Scævola Kœnigii, pyrenes of Morinda citrifolia, and\r\nseeds of Thespesia populnea, Ipomœa grandiflora, Cæsalpinia bonducella,\r\nand of different species of Mucuna, that had been kept afloat for a year\r\nin sea-water, floated just as buoyantly in fresh water at the close; and\r\nin those cases where any sank during the course of the experiment, it\r\nwas ascertained that they were able to float in fresh water almost to\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\nThat many of the seeds and fruits of tropical littoral plants that are\r\nknown to be dispersed by the ocean-currents will float well in fresh\r\nwater is shown in the constant occurrence in the floating drift of\r\nFijian estuaries, where the water may be quite fresh or brackish, of the\r\nseeds and fruits of plants like Cerbera odollam, Clerodendron inerme,\r\nEntada scandens, Heritiera littoralis, Ipomœa pes capræ, Morinda\r\ncitrifolia, Mucuna, Vigna lutea, &c. In the same way I noticed afloat in\r\nthe Guayaquil River in Ecuador, when the water was quite fresh, seeds\r\nand fruits characteristic of the sea-drift, such as those of Anona\r\npaludosa (seeds), Entada scandens, Ipomœa, Mucuna, Vigna, &c.; and when\r\nwe supplement observation with experiment, as for instance in the case\r\nof Anona paludosa, we find that they will float equally long in fresh\r\nand sea-water.\r\n\r\nThe same rule prevails with most of the buoyant seeds and seedvessels of\r\nplants of the British flora—seeds and fruits, as I may remind the\r\nreader, that are mostly to be found in river and pond drift. I am not\r\nable to distinguish any difference of importance in the results of the\r\nseparate fresh-water and sea-water experiments. Thus with the seeds or\r\nseedvessels of Bidens cernua, several species of Carex, Galium palustre,\r\nIris pseudacorus, Lycopus europæus, Ranunculus repens, and numerous\r\nothers, the difference after a flotation of many months was but slight.\r\nIf the results of the separate experiments were to be compared, there\r\nwould be at least ninety afloat in fresh water for every hundred afloat\r\nin sea-water; and if at the end of a sea-water experiment, whether\r\noccupying three, six, or twelve months, the seed or fruits were to be\r\nplaced in fresh water, quite nine-tenths and sometimes more would remain\r\nafloat. A striking illustration of the principle that the excess in\r\ndensity of sea-water, as compared with fresh water, adds but little to\r\nthe floating capacity of seeds is to be found in the results given in\r\nNote 41 of simultaneous experiments made some years since by Mr. Millett\r\nand myself at Marazion and in London on the seeds of Convolvulus\r\nsoldanella.\r\n\r\n(D) In their relation, therefore, to the density of fresh water and\r\nsea-water, most seeds and seedvessels may be placed in _two principal\r\nclasses, the first including quite four-fifths of the total, where they\r\nare much heavier than sea-water, and the second comprising most of the\r\nremainder, where they are much lighter than fresh water_.\r\n\r\n(E) It would be surprising, however, if there were not some seeds or\r\nseedvessels that come between these two extreme groups; some, indeed,\r\nthat have a specific weight approximating to that of fresh water, or to\r\nthat of sea-water, or fluctuating between them, and presenting such\r\nevidence of a fine adjustment that the observer, forgetting that they\r\nare members of a series, might be apt to regard them as specially\r\nadaptive in their origin. It will thus be seen that this subject is\r\ngradually assuming a statistical character; and in truth we shall\r\nultimately recognise here the play of the laws of numbers.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the plants where the specific weight of the seeds or\r\nfruits is near that of fresh water, Alisma plantago may be taken. In the\r\ncourse of an experiment, by lowering the density of the water from 1·025\r\nto 1·020, I sent a shower of floating carpels to the bottom. The results\r\nvary considerably, as one might expect; but, generally, during the first\r\nfew days of an experiment about twice as many (sometimes in all as much\r\nas 80 per cent.) sank in fresh water as in sea-water, a few only\r\nfloating in either water for long periods.... The seeds of Arenaria\r\npeploides present an example where the specific weight is between that\r\nof fresh water and of sea-water. For the purposes of dispersal they may\r\nbe considered as heavier than fresh water and lighter than sea-water.\r\nThe details are given in Note 18; but it may be remarked here that\r\nplants possessing seeds or fruits that sink in fresh water and float in\r\nsea-water are very rare. As indicated below, this is what we might look\r\nfor on statistical grounds.\r\n\r\nPlants whose seeds or fruits are not much lighter than sea-water are\r\nexceptional. In such cases the effect of increased density of the water\r\nis to extend the period of flotation. Thus, in my experiments on the\r\nnutlets of Scirpus maritimus, the majority of the fruits floated in\r\nfresh water only eight to ten days; whilst in ordinary sea-water they\r\nfloated in most cases two to three weeks; but when the density was\r\nraised to 1·050, the greater number of them were afloat after two\r\nmonths. In a few plants, as with Spiræa ulmaria, the effect of the\r\ndifference in density between fresh and sea-water was not to extend the\r\nperiod of flotation, but to increase the number that floated for a given\r\nperiod, the extreme limit of the buoyancy of the carpels in either water\r\nwith this species being about three weeks.\r\n\r\nAmongst tropical plants, as illustrated by those of the Pacific islands,\r\ncases also came under my notice where the mean specific weight of the\r\nseed is somewhere between those of fresh water and sea-water. The seeds\r\nof Afzelia bijuga, an inland as well as a littoral tree in Fiji, offer\r\nan interesting example. If we place 100 seeds of a littoral tree in\r\nsea-water, we find that on the average about 70 float. If then we lower\r\nthe density gradually, some of the seeds begin to sink at once; and on\r\nthe removal of the survivors to fresh water, about 47 will remain\r\nafloat. The results may thus be stated:—Out of 100 littoral seeds, 30\r\nare specifically heavier than sea-water (1·025); 23 are between\r\nsea-water and fresh water in specific weight; whilst 47 are lighter than\r\nfresh water (1·000). When, however, we take 100 seeds of inland trees,\r\nwe find that on the average 87 are heavier than sea-water, 5 are in\r\nweight between sea-water and fresh water, and 8 are lighter than fresh\r\nwater. The significance of these figures becomes evident when we arrange\r\nthem in curves. The combined result for littoral and inland seeds is\r\ngiven in the diagram below; and we see there, what is also indicated\r\nwith the separate curves that we are dealing with a double series, one\r\nconcerned with seeds lighter than fresh water, and the other with seeds\r\nheavier than sea-water. The reader can himself supply the separate\r\ncurves for the littoral and inland seeds. The point, however, to notice\r\nis that if a botanist with a statistical bent were to make a\r\nmiscellaneous collection of the seeds of the Vesi (Afzelia bijuga) in\r\none of the Fijian islands, in order to test their buoyancy, he would\r\nobtain such a result as is given in this diagram. Two varieties of the\r\ntree would be at once indicated, and further research would indicate\r\nthat these varieties were connected with littoral and inland stations.\r\nThis subject is further dealt with in Chapter XVII.\r\n\r\n +------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n |Combined results for 200 seeds of Afzelia bijuga (100 littoral; 100 inland).  |\r\n +--------------------------------+------------------------+--------------------+\r\n |           |                    |                        |                    |\r\n |Percentage.|  Heavier than sea- | Between sea-water and  | Lighter than fresh |\r\n |           |  water, or +1·025. | fresh water in weight. | water, or -1·000.  |\r\n +-----------+--------------------+------------------------+--------------------+\r\n |           |                    |                        |                    |\r\n |    100    |                    |                        |                    |\r\n |           |                    |                        |                    |\r\n |           +--------------------+------------------------+--------------------+\r\n |           |                    |                        |                    |\r\n |     80    |                    |                        |                    |\r\n |           |                    |                        |                    |\r\n |           +--------------------+------------------------+--------------------+\r\n |           |                    |                        |                    |\r\n |     60    |                    |                        |                    |\r\n |           |                    |                        |                    |\r\n |           +--------------------+------------------------+--------------------+\r\n |           |          .         |                        |                    |\r\n |     40    |            .       |                        |                    |\r\n |           |              .     |                        |                    |\r\n |           +--------------------+------------------------+--------------------+\r\n |           |                 .  |                        |                    |\r\n |     20    |                   .|                        |          .         |\r\n |           |                    |.                       |   .                |\r\n |           +--------------------+------------------------+--------------------+\r\n |           |                    |    .            .      |                    |\r\n |      0    |                    |      .                 |                    |\r\n |           +--------------------+------------------------+--------------------+\r\n |           |                    |                        |                    |\r\n +-----------+--------------------+------------------------+--------------------+\r\n\r\nIt might seem strange that the seeds of Entada scandens should come into\r\nthe category of seeds with a specific weight near that of fresh water;\r\nyet my observations in Fiji indicate that such is the case. In the\r\ndiscussion of this plant in Chapter XVII. it is pointed out that, as a\r\nrule, not more than a fourth will float in a river when they are first\r\nfreed from the pod, and not more than fifty per cent. will float in the\r\nsea. Those that float, however, in either water will usually float\r\nindefinitely. The seeds also of Mucuna gigantea D.C. are not very much\r\nlighter than fresh water. Out of six seeds that floated in sea-water\r\nbuoyantly, five floated in fresh water, but heavily.\r\n\r\nIt is of interest to notice in this connection that the\r\nmangrove-seedlings produced by germination on the tree, as in the case\r\nof Rhizophora and Bruguiera, have a mean specific weight somewhere\r\nbetween fresh water and sea-water. This is often illustrated in a\r\ncurious way, when the seedling has not been prematurely detached from\r\nthe tree. Thus in the sea off the coast of tropical America, as well as\r\namongst the Fijian Islands, the seedlings of Rhizophora mangle are as a\r\nrule to be observed floating horizontally; whilst in the fresh or\r\nbrackish water of the estuaries of these regions they assume a more or\r\nless vertical position, only the plumular portion protruding above the\r\nwater. This is also true of the seedlings of Rhizophora mucronata, the\r\nAsiatic mangrove, and of Bruguiera rheedii. This subject is discussed in\r\ndetail in Chapter XXX.; but it may be here remarked that a good\r\nproportion of Rhizophora seedlings, when detached in the mature\r\ncondition from the tree, have no buoyancy, between 20 and 50 per cent.\r\ngoing to the bottom when they fall into a river, and between 5 and 10\r\nper cent. when they drop into the sea. The navigator might often obtain\r\nan indication of the density of the sea-surface when approaching the\r\nmouth of a large river by observing the floating Rhizophora seedlings (a\r\nfoot long) which are carried out to sea in numbers. If he sees them from\r\nthe deck of his ship floating horizontally he will infer that the\r\nsurface-water is mainly sea-water. In ordinary fresh water when they\r\nfloat vertically he would not be able to distinguish them from floating\r\nseeds or fruits.\r\n\r\nIt has only been possible to treat this subject in an illustrative\r\nmanner. More details might have been given; but I have gone far enough\r\nto bring the following points into relief and to justify one in drawing\r\nthe conclusions to be now stated.\r\n\r\n_Most seeds and seedvessels in respect of their floating powers tend to\r\ngather around two centres or means and to form two groups, the sinking\r\ngroup and the buoyant group._\r\n\r\n_In the sinking or non-buoyant group, which includes 80 per cent. of the\r\nwhole, the mean specific weight is considerably greater than that of\r\nsea-water (1·026), which would require its density to be raised to 1·100\r\nin order to serve as a floating medium for many of them._\r\n\r\n_In the buoyant group the mean specific weight is much lighter than that\r\nof fresh water (1·000); and from this it is to be inferred that in\r\noceans of fresh water the same fruits and seeds in the mass would be\r\ndistributed by the currents that are transported by them at the present\r\nday. Even though it arose from an ocean of fresh water, the coral island\r\nwould receive the same littoral plants through the agency of the\r\ncurrents that it receives under its existing conditions._\r\n\r\nThe number of plants with seeds or fruits between fresh water and\r\nsea-water in specific weight is very small, probably not over 2 per\r\ncent. of the total. Most seeds or fruits that sink in fresh water sink\r\nalso in sea-water, and most that float in sea-water float also in fresh\r\nwater. _Nature has thus created a wide gap between the sinking and the\r\nfloating seed; and nearly all of the work of the present currents in\r\nplant-dispersal might have been effected, so far as the density is\r\nconcerned, in fresh water._ She has not arranged seeds and seedvessels\r\nin what the statistician would term “a good series.” As indicated in the\r\ndiagram below, there are two series that meet in the neutral region\r\nwhere the density is between fresh water and sea-water, but with\r\nculminating points placed on the one side far above the density of\r\nsea-water and on the other far below that of fresh water.\r\n\r\n +-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n |  Relation of the specific weight of seeds and fruits to the density of        |\r\n | fresh and sea-water.                                                          |\r\n +--------------+--------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+\r\n | Percentage. | Heavier than sea-  |Between fresh and sea- | Lighter than fresh |\r\n |             | water, or +1·026.  | water, 1·000-1·026.   |  water, or -1·000. |\r\n +-------------+--------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+\r\n |             |                    |                       |                    |\r\n |     100     |                    |                       |                    |\r\n |             |                    |                       |                    |\r\n |             +--------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+\r\n |             |                    |                       |                    |\r\n |      80     |                    |                       |                    |\r\n |             |                    |                       |                    |\r\n |             +--------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+\r\n |             |        .           |                       |                    |\r\n |      60     |          .         |                       |                    |\r\n |             |            .       |                       |                    |\r\n |             +--------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+\r\n |             |               .    |                       |                    |\r\n |      40     |                 .  |                       |                    |\r\n |             |                   .|                       |                    |\r\n |             +--------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+\r\n |             |                    | .                     |                    |\r\n |      20     |                    |   .                   |                    |\r\n |             |                    |     .                 |                    |\r\n |             +--------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+\r\n |             |                    |        .              |        .           |\r\n |       0     |                    |          .           .|                    |\r\n |             |                    |            .          |                    |\r\n |             +--------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+\r\n |             |                    |                       |                    |\r\n +-------------+--------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+\r\n\r\nI do not, therefore, think that the buoyancy of seeds and fruits has had\r\nany relation either in the present or in the past to the density of the\r\nsea. Nor is it to be supposed that any slight variations in density in\r\nthe course of ages would have materially affected the dispersal of\r\nplants by currents. It is to be inferred that the physicist and the\r\ngeologist would be prepared to grant only small variations, such as a\r\nchange from 1·020 to 1·025. It will be gathered from what has been said\r\nbefore that changes of this nature would have a very slight influence on\r\nthe buoyancy of seeds and fruits, since the plants they would affect\r\nwould be very few. The change that the student of plant-dispersal would\r\nrequire to produce any marked alteration in distribution would be in\r\namount alarming to the physicist.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the oceans have been getting fresher or salter in the\r\ncourse of ages (see Note 42), we will be moderate in our demands, and\r\nwill listen to the physicist when he argues that a diminishing density,\r\nfor instance, from 1·035 to 1·025, in the course of ages might explain\r\nsome of the peculiar features in the present isolation of insular\r\nfloras. Many seeds, he would contend, that could float across an ocean\r\nhaving a density of 1·035 would be unable to accomplish it when the\r\ndensity fell to 1·025. It has, however, been remarked that the critical\r\npoint of density for the flotation of seeds or fruits that sink under\r\npresent conditions is probably about 1·100. Cases of such a fine\r\nadjustment to the density of sea-water are too few to endow this\r\nargument with any weight. Or it might be suggested that with a gradual\r\nincrease in density in the lapse of ages seeds might float now that sank\r\nbefore, or they might float for a longer period. Such a change, however,\r\nwould not have much effect, since nearly all the seeds and seedvessels\r\nthat sink in our rivers sink also in our seas, and a much greater\r\nincrease of density is required to make any difference.\r\n\r\nYet, although we might term the sinking of a seed or fruit an accidental\r\nattribute of certain plants, just as we might regard the floating of a\r\nlog as an accidental attribute of a pine, since in either case the\r\nspecific weight might have been acquired without any direct relation to\r\nthe density of water, still the sinking of the seed or fruit signifies a\r\nprofound distinction not only, as is stated below, in plant\r\ndistribution, but, as we shall see later on, in plant-development.\r\nEspecially striking, says Prof. Schimper (p. 153), is the dependence\r\nbetween an over-sea area of distribution and a station at the coast in\r\nthe case of species of the same genus of which some belong to the\r\nlittoral and some to the inland flora. In the first place, as has been\r\noften remarked in these pages, we have a wide distribution generally\r\nassociated with considerable buoyancy of the seeds or fruits. In the\r\nsecond case the areas are usually very restricted and there is little or\r\nno buoyancy. The better fitted a seed or fruit is for dispersal by\r\ncurrents the greater, therefore, is the area of the plant. Whether such\r\nan important relationship depends on an accidental attribute of the seed\r\nor fruit is the question that immediately presents itself. But it is\r\nobvious that in raising such a question we touch on a very vital point\r\nin adaptation, since if attributes developed in one connection have a\r\nprofound influence in another we may have to rearrange some of our\r\nfundamental notions of the inner workings of Nature.\r\n\r\nLet us, therefore, look a little closer into this matter, and turn again\r\nto the Pacific islands. The present state of things may be thus tersely\r\ndescribed. Whilst the shore-plants dispersed by the currents have\r\nremained relatively the same, changes of all kinds, from the production\r\nof a variety and of a species to the development of a genus, have taken\r\nplace in the inland floras. Now, let us imagine that all this is altered\r\nand that every seed or fruit is buoyant. There would then be but little\r\ndistinction between the strand and inland floras, since they would be in\r\na constant state of interchange, and most species would be widely\r\ndistributed. A relatively monotonous aspect would belong to all insular\r\nfloras, and indeed to much of the plant-world, since isolation, one of\r\nthe principal conditions for the origin of new species and new genera,\r\nwould often not exist.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, let us suppose that all seeds and fruits were\r\nnon-buoyant. The agency of birds would then be alone available for\r\nstocking new islands with most of their plants. The conditions of\r\nisolation would be intensified. There would be no widely-ranging\r\nstrand-flora, since every island and every stretch of continental\r\nsea-board would possess its own littoral plants that could only reflect\r\nthe peculiarities of the inland flora. The only determining factor\r\nbetween coast and inland plants would be the presence or absence of the\r\ncapacity or organisation for occupying a station on the sea-shore.\r\n\r\nWe have now proceeded far enough to disclose the far-reaching influence\r\non plant-distribution and on plant-development that the relation between\r\nthe specific weight of seeds and fruits and the density of sea-water\r\nmust possess. Yet it has been shown that when such a relation is viewed\r\nstatistically it has an accidental aspect. We will accordingly devote\r\nthe next few chapters to the discussion of the buoyancy of seeds and\r\nfruits from the structural standpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Summary of the Chapter._\r\n\r\n(_a_) The great majority of seeds and seedvessels (quite 80 per cent.)\r\nare much heavier than sea-water, but a noticeable proportion are\r\nconsiderably lighter than fresh water, whilst those with a specific\r\nweight near that of fresh water or of sea-water are very few.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The buoyancy of seed and fruit has no direct relation to the\r\ndensity of sea-water, and even if the ocean was deprived of all its\r\ndissolved salts, the agency of the dispersal of plants by currents would\r\nnot be materially affected.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Small changes in sea-density, such as the physicist would allow,\r\nwould, therefore, have no appreciable influence on the operations of the\r\ncurrents as plant dispersers; and only great changes in density, such as\r\nare presented by the waters of the Dead Sea, would add materially to the\r\nnumber of floating seeds and fruits.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Although the specific weight of seeds and fruits in its relation\r\nto sea-density may be regarded as an accidental attribute, their\r\nnon-buoyancy in the great majority of plants has had a far-reaching\r\ninfluence not only on plant-distribution, but on plant-development. The\r\nplant-world would be transformed if all seeds and fruits floated in\r\nsea-water.\r\n\r\n(_e_) If the floating seed or fruit displays a quality that, so far as\r\nthe density of the sea is concerned, has been developed in quite another\r\nconnection, we have next to inquire whether the structure of such\r\nbuoyant seeds and fruits also affords evidence of non-adaptation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                   ADAPTATION AND MEANS OF DISPERSAL\r\n\r\nNature has never concerned herself directly with providing means of\r\n  dispersal.—Fleshy fruits not made to be eaten.—Nor “sticky” seeds to\r\n  adhere to plumage.—Nor prickly fruits to entangle themselves in fur\r\n  and feathers.—The dispersal of seeds a blind result of the struggle\r\n  between the intruding Evolutionary power and the controlling influence\r\n  of Adaptation.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEFORE entering into a discussion of the causes of the floating powers\r\nof seeds, it is necessary that I should state my general position on the\r\nrelation between capacities of dispersal in the organic world and the\r\nquestion of adaptation. Adaptation runs through all the organic and\r\ninorganic worlds, and we cannot conceive an universe without it. The\r\nnaturalist who looks only for the end in the purpose served makes but a\r\npartially legitimate use of the phrase. On the other hand, it has been\r\nimproperly appropriated by those who hold to the theory of Natural\r\nSelection, as indicating the result of small fortuitous variations that\r\nhave chanced to be of service to the species in the struggle for\r\nexistence. There is no question here of any end in view. Nature is\r\nrepresented as working blindly, and the result of such “fortuitous\r\nvariation” is termed an adaptation. We cannot, however, pick and choose\r\nonly adaptations that are very evident in their character. We must\r\ninclude everything in the organic world as an adaptation, whether\r\napparent or not, that is in direct relation with the organism’s\r\nconditions of existence. It is not conceivable that an organism can be\r\nadapted to conditions outside its environment, and yet many so-called\r\nadaptations are of this character.\r\n\r\nNature—and I here confess my belief in a determining agency working\r\nabove and through all living and dead matter, but largely controlled and\r\nchecked by the laws of the physical world—Nature, as I apprehend, has\r\nnever concerned herself directly with providing means of dispersal\r\neither for plants or animals. With regard to plants, she makes no direct\r\nprovision for the distribution of their fruits or seeds. If she had done\r\nso, she would have employed some uniformity in her methods, as in the\r\ninstance of the means of reproduction; whereas the modes of dispersal\r\nare almost infinite in their variety. When I say that Nature makes no\r\ndirect provision for the dispersal of plants and animals, I mean not in\r\nthe sense that a bird is adapted for an aerial life, or an aquatic plant\r\nfor a more or less submerged existence. That a bird is often able to\r\ndistribute its kind over a great area is the “accident” of its\r\nconditions of existence. In a similar way the wide distribution of the\r\n“ticks” that they carry round the world is due to the parasitical habits\r\nof these insects, habits that have been acquired without any view to\r\ntheir mode of dispersal by birds.\r\n\r\nSimilarly it cannot be said of seeds or fruits that are transported by\r\nbirds, whether adhering to their plumage by means of hooks or hairs, or\r\nthrough some viscid excretion, or inclosed in soil adhering to the feet\r\nor legs, or carried in the stomach and intestines, that Nature has made\r\nany special provision for their dispersal. The dispersing agencies take\r\nadvantage of certain capacities or characters of a seed or fruit that\r\nhave been developed in the plant for quite other reasons and in\r\nconformity with quite other principles. There may be mentioned as\r\nexamples the mucosity of seeds, the fleshiness of fruits, the occurrence\r\nof hairs and prickles, &c. Yet as far as their connection with dispersal\r\nis concerned, such capacities and characters are blind results in the\r\nhistory of the plant’s development, the dispersing agencies making use\r\nof what was not intended for them.\r\n\r\n“Adaptation to definite life-purposes,” as Sachs terms it (_Physiology\r\nof Plants_, 1887, p. 122), is seen everywhere; but it is adaptation\r\nrestricted to the organism’s conditions of existence. It is not\r\nconceivable, as I have said, that an organism can be adapted to\r\nconditions outside its environment. If there is such a seeming\r\nadaptation, it is but a blind result, the accidental outcome of\r\ncollision or contact between two sets of conditions. If we represent a\r\nnumber of these sets of conditions by several circles gradually\r\nincreasing in size until they encroach on each other, we find that the\r\ncircles lose their form and acquire a polygonal shape. All characters\r\nseemingly connected with modes of dispersal have only this indirect\r\nrelation to such agencies; and their utility in these respects is an\r\naccident in the plant’s life. They have not been acquired in connection\r\nwith the dispersing medium, but are the products of the laws of growth\r\nand heredity, guided by a determining agency, and acting within the\r\norganism’s conditions of existence. It is within these narrow limits\r\nthat all evident adaptations lie. In matters outside the conditions of\r\nthe development of seeds and fruits, the evolutionary or determining\r\nprinciple “lets them go.” Detached from the plant, they come in contact\r\nwith conditions for which they were never created. The predominant power\r\nin Nature, that brings to a successful issue the development of an\r\norganism, has its limitations, and this is one of them, the evolutionary\r\nor determining influence being ever checked and hampered by the laws of\r\nthe inorganic world.\r\n\r\nI can only refer briefly to some of the reasons that have led me to\r\napply this view of the duality of forces in Nature to the subject of\r\nplant-dispersal. The principles of evolution and adaptation rule the\r\nworld except in matters of dispersal. Take, for instance, the fleshy\r\nfruits which the gardener often makes more attractive to birds than they\r\nare in the wild condition. The result is certainly to increase their\r\nfacilities for dispersal by birds; but such a result was as little\r\nintended by man as it was by Nature when species of Cornus, Ficus,\r\nPrunus, Viburnum, and other genera matured their drupes, berries, and\r\nfleshy fruits in the Cretaceous epoch.\r\n\r\nChildren are now taught in several excellent little books on\r\n“Nature-Study” that fleshy fruits are specially adapted to be eaten by\r\nanimals to secure the distribution of the seeds. We read in one book\r\nthat plants produce these fruits “on purpose to be eaten,” in another\r\nthat they are “intended to be eaten,” and in a third that the\r\nseed-coverings are adaptations, all with the ulterior object of\r\ndistribution by frugivorous animals. I must be pardoned if I venture to\r\nexpress my dissent from these statements, more especially since they are\r\nmade by authors from whom it might be thought almost impertinent for me\r\nto differ. Yet authority can be claimed for holding the opposite view.\r\n\r\nWhen the botanist speaks of “useless secretions” in a plant, he is\r\nalluding amongst other things to the sugar and organic acids of fruits.\r\n“How and why all these substances originate is,” as Professor Sachs\r\nobserved in the work before quoted, “not known.” It is, however,\r\nsuggested by Dr. Kerner, in his _Natural History of Plants_ (Engl. edit.\r\ni, 460-462), that such secretions, though useless to plants, may exist\r\nfor the purpose of alluring animals to assist in seed-dispersal. There\r\nare some botanists, it may be remarked, that would reject such a view of\r\nthe nature of fruits. Dr. Stapf in his memoir on the flora of Kinabalu\r\nobserves in this connection that the fact that a fruit is fleshy and\r\nattractive to birds is “no proof that it is really devoured by them, and\r\nstill less that it is dispersed by them.” Neither in fleshy fruits, nor\r\nin minute seeds, nor in seeds capable of being transported by the wind\r\ndoes he regard the general object of the particular character as\r\nprimarily to act as a means of dispersion.\r\n\r\nThe same plea is made for the mucosity of seeds like those of Capsella\r\nand Plantago (see Note 43), or for the “stickiness” of other seeds and\r\nfruits like those of Pisonia, qualities that favour adherence to passing\r\nobjects. This is the reason, we are told, why seeds are “sticky.” Such\r\nsecretions I infer are often materials lost to the plant; and being in\r\nthat sense excretory we are not called on to supply a use for them. They\r\ncan, therefore, not be regarded as having any teleological significance,\r\nsince adaptation arises only from the requirements of the plant’s\r\nconditions of existence. If they are serviceable in assisting the\r\ndistribution of seeds, such an event can only be described as an\r\naccident in the plant’s life arising from chance contact with another\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nThe appendages of seeds and fruits, such as hooks and hairs, that render\r\nthem liable to adhere to fur or feathers, are also regarded as special\r\nadaptations to this end. Without entering into the physiological\r\nsignificance of hairs and prickles generally, concerning which, as many\r\nof my readers will know, much might be said not in favour of such a\r\nview, I would refer to cases like that of Cæsalpinia Bonducella, where\r\nthe large prickly pods could not possibly be intended to aid the plant’s\r\ndispersal, whilst the leaf-branches are also prickly, and the seeds are\r\nwell known to be distributed by the currents. There are other cases like\r\nthat of Bidens cernua where the achenes, by reason of their barbed\r\nbristles, and on account of a layer of “buoyant tissue” in the\r\nfruit-coats, are dispersed both by birds and by water. We may fitly ask\r\nto which capacity the theory of adaptation should be applied. Spiny\r\nfruits may be sometimes so large, as in the instance of Trapa natans,\r\nthat the question of adaptation to dispersal cannot be raised.\r\n\r\nThe great variety of the modes of dispersal of seeds is in itself an\r\nindication that the dispersing agencies avail themselves in a hap-hazard\r\nfashion of characters and capacities that have been developed in other\r\nconnections. Seeds and fruits, having developed certain characters under\r\na particular set of life-conditions, on being detached from the parent\r\nplant are brought into contact with conditions quite outside their\r\noriginal environment. Qualities and capacities are then brought into\r\nplay which have no connection with the life-history of the plant. The\r\ncare with which the mother plant guards the maturing seeds, and the\r\nprotection of the environment, are at a certain period withdrawn, and\r\nthe seeds are left to take their chance under strange conditions. It\r\nwould be idle to see anything purposeful in the waste that results.\r\nRather we would see in it the effect of one of the numerous limitations\r\nof the determining or evolutionary power in Nature. Such a power has to\r\nadapt its workings to the laws of the physical world, checked here,\r\nfrustrated there, at times, as in this particular case, losing all\r\ncontrol, but in the end prevailing.\r\n\r\nMy general position may be thus summarised. As concerning the\r\ndistribution of fruits and seeds, the dispersing agencies take advantage\r\nof characters and capacities that were never intended for them,\r\ncharacters and qualities indeed that are often only brought out in\r\nrelation to another environment. Thus no question of adaptation as\r\nregards means of dispersal can arise, since such capacities for\r\ndispersal have no connection with the plant’s life-history. That seeds\r\nare dispersed at all is a blind result of the ever-continued struggle\r\nbetween the opposing forces of evolution and adaptation; that is to say,\r\nbetween the determining power that lies behind organic life and the\r\nphysical conditions to which it has to adapt its ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n THE CAUSES OF THE BUOYANCY OF SEEDS AND FRUITS OF LITTORAL PLANTS WITH\r\n           ESPECIAL REFERENCE TO THOSE OF THE PACIFIC ISLANDS\r\n\r\nThe classification of buoyant seeds and fruits.—The first group, where\r\n  the cavity of the seed or seedvessel is incompletely filled.—The\r\n  second group, where the kernel is buoyant.—The third group, where\r\n  there is air-bearing tissue in the seed-tests or fruit-coats.—The\r\n  buoyant seeds and seedvessels of the littoral plants of the British\r\n  flora.—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the following pages I have adopted in its main features the\r\nclassification of buoyant seeds and fruits employed by Professor\r\nSchimper in his work on the strand-flora of the Indo-Malayan region. The\r\ncauses of buoyancy, as he points out, are very various, but they can be\r\narranged in a few categories; each category, however, usually admitting\r\ngreat variety within its limits. It is this want of uniformity that\r\nfirst attracts our attention when we come to study the structure of\r\nseeds and fruits from the standpoint of their buoyancy. Whilst in the\r\nPacific I went over most of the field traversed by Professor Schimper in\r\nMalaya (the majority of littoral plants of these regions being common to\r\nboth), and as a result I have added not a few plants to his original\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the following synopsis that there are three\r\nprincipal groups. The first group includes those seeds and fruits where\r\nthe buoyancy is derived from unfilled space in the seed or fruit cavity.\r\nThe second group comprises those seeds or fruits where the floating\r\npower is due to the buoyant kernel or nucleus. The third group includes\r\nthose where the buoyancy arises from the existence of air-bearing tissue\r\nin the coverings of the seed or fruit.\r\n\r\nThe first two groups I will term the mechanical or non-adaptive groups,\r\nnot only on account of the structure inducing the buoyancy, but because,\r\nas Professor Schimper remarks, the same structure often occurs with\r\ninland fruits and seeds possessing little or no floating power. In many\r\nof these cases, as he points out, the question of adaptation to\r\ndispersal by ocean currents cannot, therefore, be raised. The third\r\ngroup may be named the adaptation group, because it is on these examples\r\nof buoyant seeds and fruits that this investigator chiefly based his\r\ncontention that in the main the structures concerned with buoyancy\r\nrepresent adaptations to dispersal by currents effected through the\r\nagency of Natural Selection. It is accordingly to this group that\r\nProfessor Schimper especially directed his attention, and the result of\r\nhis observations made in the home of the plants and of his\r\ninvestigations in the laboratory has been the elucidation of many\r\ndifficult points in the structure of their fruits and seeds. To the two\r\n“mechanical” groups he did not pay the same attention; and as their\r\nexamination came more within the limits of my own capacity as an\r\ninquirer I have worked them out with some detail, the subdivisions of\r\nthe first group being my own as well as much of the material.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the buoyant fruits and seeds of littoral plants of the\r\ntropical Pacific classified according to the cause of buoyancy._ (The\r\nauthorities are indicated by the initial letter, S = Schimper, G =\r\nGuppy. Details are given under some of the species in latter part of\r\nvolume.)\r\n\r\nFIRST GROUP.—The floating power is derived from unoccupied space in the\r\n cavity of the seed or fruit, no part of the seed or fruit as a rule\r\n possessing independent floating power.\r\n\r\n SUB-GROUP I., where the seed is concerned.\r\n\r\n  SECTION I. The seeds have little or no albumen, and neither the tests\r\n   nor the seed-contents have any buoyancy. The cotyledons are generally\r\n   large, foliaceous, and crumpled or folded, or otherwise arranged, so\r\n   that the seed-cavity is incompletely filled.\r\n\r\n   S. G. Hibiscus tiliaceus.\r\n      G. Hibiscus diversifolius.\r\n   S. G. Thespesia populnea.\r\n      S. Suriana maritima.\r\n      G. Kleinhovia hospita, _variable_.\r\n   S. G. Colubrina asiatica.\r\n      S. Dodonæa viscosa.\r\n      G. Argyreia tiliæfolia, _variable_.\r\n      G. Ipomœa bona nox, _variable_.\r\n      G. Ipomœa glaberrima, Boj.\r\n   S. G.

Euphorbia atoto.\r\n\r\n_Notes._—The species marked “variable” have seeds that sometimes sink\r\nand sometimes float. With the exception of Kleinhovia they are only at\r\ntimes littoral in station.\r\n\r\nThe plants of the British flora are represented by Convolvulus\r\nsoldanella and C. sepium, the last being “variable” and not a littoral\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n  SECTION II. All the seeds belong to the Leguminosæ. Neither the tests\r\n   nor the seed-contents have any buoyancy, the floating power arising\r\n   from a large central cavity produced by the bending outward of the\r\n   cotyledons during the final shrinking stage of the maturation of the\r\n   seed.\r\n\r\n      S. Mucuna (generically).\r\n      G. Mucuna urens D.C. (Hawaii).\r\n      G. Mucuna, species of.\r\n   S. G. Vigna lutea.\r\n   S. G. Cæsalpinia bonducella.\r\n      G. Cæsalpinia bonduc.\r\n      G. Entada scandens.\r\n\r\n SUB-GROUP II., where the fruit is concerned.\r\n\r\n  SECTION III. The seed only partially fills the fruit-cavity, and as a\r\n   rule is not buoyant. The fruit shell, usually woody, may be also\r\n   buoyant.\r\n\r\n   S. G. Heritiera littoralis.\r\n      G. Smythea pacifica.\r\n      G. Dalbergia monosperma.\r\n   S. G. Derris uliginosa.\r\n   S. G. Pongamia glabra.\r\n      G. Desmodium umbellatum.\r\n      G. Gyrocarpus jacquini.\r\n\r\n  SECTION IV. The floating power is derived from empty seed-cavities,\r\n   where owing to abortion of the ovule or some similar cause the seed\r\n   is not developed.\r\n\r\n   S. G. Morinda citrifolia.\r\n      G. Premna tahitensis.\r\n\r\n_Note._—Professor Schimper, in the case of Morinda citrifolia, holds the\r\nview that we have here a special adaptation to dispersal by currents.\r\n\r\nSECOND GROUP.—Here the floating power is due mainly or entirely to\r\n buoyant kernels. In the case of seeds the tests are non-buoyant; but\r\n with “stones” the floating capacity may be aided by a layer of\r\n air-bearing tissue inside the shell.\r\n\r\n SECTION I. Non-Leguminous.\r\n\r\n  S. G. Ximenia americana (drupe).\r\n  S. G. Calophyllum inophyllum (drupe).\r\n\r\n_Note._—Professor Schimper would place these two plants in the second\r\nsection of the third group on account of the layer of air-bearing tissue\r\ninside the shell of the “stone”; but they are assigned to this section,\r\nsince the floating power is mainly due to the buoyant kernel.\r\n\r\nArenaria (Honckeneya) peploides, a British beach plant, belongs here.\r\n\r\n SECTION II. Leguminous seeds.\r\n\r\n     G. Dioclea.\r\n     G. Strongylodon lucidum.\r\n     S. Canavalia (generic).\r\n     G. Canavalia sericea.\r\n  S. G. Canavalia obtusifolia.\r\n     S.

Lathyrus?\r\n\r\nTHIRD GROUP.—The floating power is due to the presence of air-bearing\r\n tissue in the seed-tests or fruit-coats.\r\n\r\n SECTION I. The buoyant tissue occurs at the outside or forms the\r\n  periphery of the seed or fruit. Unless otherwise indicated the fruit\r\n  is implied in the list below.\r\n\r\n  S. G.

The buoyant tissue forms a layer inside the hard test of a\r\n  seed or inside the shell of the “stone” of a drupaceous fruit, and to\r\n  this cause the floating power is mainly or entirely due.\r\n\r\n  G.

Anona paludosa (seed) of tropical America.\r\n\r\n_Note._—I have followed Schimper in respect to Pandanus, but it might be\r\nby some placed in the first section of this group.\r\n\r\nHere belongs Euphorbia paralias, a British littoral plant, the buoyant\r\nseeds of which occur in the stranded seed-drift of English and\r\nMediterranean beaches.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following general discussion of the groups, reference will be\r\nmade only to the plants best illustrating the different varieties of\r\nstructure connected with buoyancy; whilst mention of the other plants\r\nwill in some cases be found in other parts of this volume, as shown in\r\nthe Index; and the matter is discussed at some length in not a few of\r\nthe species.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE FIRST GROUP.\r\n\r\nOf the first group, where the floating power is due to the unoccupied\r\nspace in the cavity of the seed or fruit, the Convolvulaceæ offer the\r\nmost typical examples. Here as a rule the crumpled embryo fills the\r\nseed-cavity more or less incompletely; and it is on the relative size of\r\nthe unoccupied space that the sinking or floating of the seed depends.\r\nIn those plants where the seed sinks the seed-cavity may be almost\r\nfilled, as in Ipomœa tuberculata, or densely packed, as in Ipomœa\r\npentaphylla, and in species of Cuscuta. When the seed floats, as with\r\nIpomœa pes capræ, I. glaberrima, &c., the unoccupied space is relatively\r\nlarge; and when, as with I. bona nox and I. turpethum, the behaviour of\r\nthe seeds is irregular, some floating, and others sinking, a\r\ncorresponding variation exists in the extent to which the seed-cavity is\r\nfilled. This applies also to the irregular behaviour of the seeds of\r\nIpomœa peltata and of Argyreia tiliæfolia. A singular instance is\r\nafforded by the seeds of Ipomœa insularis, collected by me in Fiji and\r\nHawaii. Those from Fiji were incompletely filled, and consequently\r\nbuoyant. Those from Hawaii were more densely packed and sank.... The\r\nthree British species of Convolvulus illustrate the same principle,\r\nnamely, C. arvensis, with non-buoyant seeds; C. soldanella, with buoyant\r\nseeds; and C. sepium, with seeds irregular in behaviour.\r\n\r\nIn the case of plants of the Convolvulaceæ, possessing buoyant seeds,\r\nthere is always evidence of marked shrinking of the seed-contents before\r\nthe final setting and hardening of the seed-coats. The embryo often\r\nappears shrivelled and dried up, and is almost brittle, so that large\r\nspaces are produced in the seed-cavity. If we partly divide such a seed\r\nand place it in water, the embryo absorbs water rapidly, and within an\r\nhour is soft, healthy-looking, and much swollen, the interspaces being\r\nfilled with a jelly-like mucilage. It is therefore evident that absolute\r\nimpermeability of the seed-coats is essential for the successful\r\ntransport by sea-currents of the floating seed; and we can only suppose\r\nthat the shrinking of the seed-contents takes place before the final\r\nsetting of the tests. That with the buoyant seeds the coats are quite\r\nwaterproof was illustrated in many of my experiments where, after a\r\nperiod of flotation covering several months, and sometimes a year or\r\nmore, the seed-contents were still quite dry and shrunken. The limit of\r\nbuoyancy, as I have shown in Chapter IX., depends on an attempt at\r\ngermination on the part of the floating seed, which then absorbs water,\r\nsoftens, swells, and sinks.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, not a matter of surprise that non-buoyant seeds of the\r\nConvolvulaceæ do not gain floating power after prolonged drying of many\r\nmonths. It is also to be expected that, as we find in Fiji, when a\r\ncharacteristic shore-species with buoyant seeds like Ipomœa pes capræ\r\nextends far inland, the seeds retain their floating powers.\r\nSeed-buoyancy of this description is, on the face of it, purely\r\nmechanical.\r\n\r\n\r\n  EXPLANATION OF THE DIAGRAMS ILLUSTRATING THE CAUSES OF SEED-BUOYANCY\r\n\r\n1. _Entada scandens_ (natural size): (_a_), the shell; (_b_), the\r\n  kernel; (_c_), the intercotyledonary cavity. The shell consists of\r\n  three coats—an outer and an inner hard chitinous coat, and an\r\n  intermediate layer of brown cellular tissue containing little or no\r\n  air. The buoyancy is due entirely to the central cavity, neither the\r\n  seed-tests nor the seed contents possessing any floating power (see\r\n  page 181).\r\n\r\n2. _Mucuna urens_, from Hawaii (natural size). The kernel (_b_) sinks,\r\n  and the shell has no floating power except where it possesses (under\r\n  the raphe) a layer of dark brown, air-bearing, spongy tissue (_a_).\r\n  This, however, is not sufficiently developed to endow the seed with\r\n  buoyancy, which is due to the intercotyledonary cavity (_c_). (see\r\n  page 111).\r\n\r\n3., 4. _Mucuna gigantea_, from Fiji (natural size). The kernel (_b_)\r\n  sinks, and the seed owes its floating power entirely to the existence\r\n  in the shell (_a_) of a layer of brown, spongy, air-bearing tissue\r\n  which is mostly developed at the circumference and is almost wanting\r\n  at the flat sides of the seed (see page 115).\r\n\r\n5., 6. _Dioclea_ (_violacea?_), from Fiji (natural size). Here the\r\n  kernel (_b_) is buoyant and endows the seed with floating power.\r\n  Though the shell (_a_) possesses a thick layer of reddish-brown\r\n  cellular tissue, this tissue contains but little air and aids the\r\n  floating power but slightly (see page 113).\r\n\r\n7. _Strongylodon lucidum_, from Fiji (natural size). The floating power\r\n  is due entirely to the buoyant kernel (_b_). There is a very scanty\r\n  amount of loose brown tissue (_a_) under the raphe; but it has no\r\n  appreciable effect on the buoyancy (see page 113).\r\n\r\n8., 9., 10. _Cæsalpinia bonducella_ and _C. bonduc_, from Fiji (natural\r\n  size). Neither the seed-tests (_a_) nor the kernel (_b_) have any\r\n  floating power in themselves, the buoyancy being connected with a\r\n  large internal cavity (_c_), which normally is intercotyledonary, as\r\n  in Fig. 8 (C. bonducella). With both plants, but more especially with\r\n  C. bonduc (Figs. 9 and 10), there may be a lateral cavity (_d_), or\r\n  the kernel may be loose in the shell (Fig. 10), but this does not\r\n  necessarily imply buoyancy (see page 194).\r\n\r\n11., 12. _Arenaria peploides_ (enlarged: seeds 4 mm. in size). Here the\r\n  curved embryo (_a_) sinks, and the spongy air-bearing albumen (_b_)\r\n  gives buoyancy to the seed (see page 116).\r\n\r\n13. _Euphorbia paralias_ (enlarged: seeds 3 mm. in size). The kernel\r\n  (_b_) sinks, and the seed owes its buoyancy to a layer of air-bearing\r\n  tissue (_a_) in the shell (see page 116).\r\n\r\n14. _Morinda citrifolia_ (enlarged pyrene 7 mm. long). The floating\r\n  power is due to the bladder-like air cavity (_a_). The seed (_b_)\r\n  proper is enclosed in the woody tissue behind the bladder (see page\r\n  112).\r\n\r\n15. _Cucurbita_ (seed enlarged), from the Valparaiso beach-drift (see\r\n  page 125). The kernel (_b_) has no buoyancy. The shell (_a_) is formed\r\n  of two layers of air-bearing tissue, the outer composed of prismatic\r\n  cells and the inner of a spongy vacuola-material.\r\n\r\n                                                    [_To face page 111._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagrams illustrating some of the causes of\r\nseed-buoyancy.]\r\n\r\nAnother type of the buoyant seeds of the first group is presented by\r\nseveral species of Leguminosæ, as with Entada scandens, some species of\r\nMucuna, and Cæsalpinia bonducella. As with the Convolvulaceous seed, the\r\nembryo sinks and the seed-shell has no buoyancy; but here the floating\r\npower is due to the existence of a more or less symmetrical long central\r\ncavity produced by the arching or bending outwards of the large\r\ncotyledons which lie usually in close contact with the seed-shell. This\r\narching outward of the cotyledons depends on a shrinking process in the\r\nsetting or final stage of the maturation of the seed. The stages of the\r\nprocess may be traced in the immature seeds, which are much larger and\r\nin some cases twice the size of the mature seed. In this immature\r\ncondition the seed-coats are soft, and the flabby fleshy and thick\r\ncotyledons fill up the seed-cavity. As the hardening and setting process\r\ncontinues, the cotyledons diminish in size, become firmer, and gradually\r\nbend outward, leaving a central cavity. This arching outwards is no\r\ndoubt in part the result of the contraction of the seed-tests during the\r\nshrinking process. Considerable variation prevails in the results, and\r\nwhere the cavity is very small the seed sinks. Further details relating\r\nto this subject will be given in my treatment of some of the plants, and\r\nespecially under Cæsalpinia. But it may be here remarked with reference\r\nto Hawaiian seeds of Mucuna urens D.C., that although they are strictly\r\nreferable to this group, they display beneath the hard test, on the side\r\nbeneath the raphe, a scanty layer of dark spongy air-bearing tissue\r\nwhich is sufficiently buoyant to float up detached portions of the test,\r\nbut does not of itself give buoyancy to the seed. The significance of\r\nthis structure will be subsequently pointed out. The seed owes its\r\nfloating power to the large central cavity, but this layer of spongy\r\ntissue adds to its buoyancy.\r\n\r\nThe section where the buoyancy of the fruit is connected with unoccupied\r\nspace in the fruit-cavity is extremely heterogeneous in its composition.\r\nEvery fruit has a method of its own, and the great variety of causes of\r\nbuoyancy of a mechanical character is here exemplified. For instance,\r\nwith Gyrocarpus jacquini and Cassytha filiformis the cause of buoyancy\r\nis in the main the same as that described in the case of the\r\nConvolvulaceæ. The origin of the floating power of the pods of Derris\r\nuliginosa is two-fold. In the first place the seed or seeds but partly\r\nfill the pod, and in the second place the seed is able to float of\r\nitself by reason of its possessing, as in the seeds of Entada scandens,\r\na large central cavity produced by the arching out of the cotyledons\r\nduring the final stage of maturation. A double cause is also to be\r\nassigned to the buoyancy of the fruits of Heritiera littoralis and of\r\nSmythea pacifica, where, in addition to the unoccupied space produced by\r\nthe shrinking of the seed, the fruit-case itself floats, though nothing\r\nbut a mechanical explanation is to be given of the floating of empty\r\nligneous fruits.\r\n\r\nOne of the most suggestive types of buoyancy belonging to the first\r\ngroup is presented by those cases, which are, however, not very\r\nfrequent, where the floating power is to be attributed to empty\r\nseed-cavities produced by the abortion of the ovule or failure of the\r\ndevelopment of the seed. A significant instance of this is afforded by\r\nthe fruits of Premna taitensis, a coast plant. The buoyant “stone” of\r\nthe drupe, which is often found afloat in the Rewa estuary in Fiji, is\r\n4-locular, each cell containing normally one seed, but as a rule only\r\none cavity contains a mature seed, the three other cavities becoming\r\nmore or less empty through the failure of their seeds. It can be proved\r\nthat neither the seeds nor the substance of the “stone” are buoyant, and\r\nthat the “stone” owes its capacity of floating for months to the empty\r\ncavities arising from the failure in development of three out of the\r\nfour seeds. In Fiji we see the rivers distributing these small fruits,\r\nand we find the “stones” stranded on the beaches and floating in the\r\ncurrents amongst the islands; and there can be no doubt that this is one\r\nof the effective modes of dispersal of the species; yet, if there was\r\never a case of accidental buoyancy concerned with dispersal by currents,\r\nwe have it here. Further details are given in Note 32.\r\n\r\nIt is probably also to the abortion of the ovule, or to the failure of\r\nthe seed, that the remarkable air-cavity (see Note 8) to which the\r\npyrenes of Morinda citrifolia owe their floating power, is to be\r\nattributed. To this structure Professor Schimper (pp. 165, 183, 200)\r\nattaches considerable importance as an example of special adaptation to\r\ndispersal by currents through the influence of Natural Selection. He\r\nsuggests, however, that possibly its morphological significance may be\r\nfound in its being a peculiarly modified seed-chamber. The case of\r\nPremna taitensis above cited indicates that the latter view is the most\r\nprobable. The subject awaits a careful microscopical study of the\r\nseed-development of the genus Morinda since, as elsewhere remarked, the\r\nnon-buoyant pyrenes of inland species have not such an air-chamber. An\r\noutline sketch of a pyrene of Morinda citrifolia is given in the\r\npreceding plate. A good figure of it occurs in Schimper’s _Plant\r\nGeography_, p. 28. A very suggestive instance of this nature is\r\ndescribed under Brackenridgea in Note 46 and in Chapter XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE SECOND GROUP.\r\n\r\nHere are included those seeds and stone-fruits that possess buoyant\r\nkernels. Professor Schimper points out that since this is a feature both\r\nwith inland as well as coast plants such a character cannot be viewed as\r\nan adaptation to dispersal by currents. The plants concerned belong\r\nmostly to the Leguminosæ, and we find here some of the most widely\r\nspread of strand species, such as Canavalia obtusifolia and Sophora\r\ntomentosa, as well as some of the giant climbers of the coast forests\r\nbelonging to the genera Dioclea and Strongylodon. The kernels when\r\ndivested of their coverings float buoyantly, but they soon absorb water\r\nand sink usually in a day or two, a circumstance indicating that it is\r\nto the impervious coverings that they indirectly owe their capacity to\r\nkeep the seed or fruit afloat. It is noteworthy that seeds of\r\nStrongylodon lucidum from Fiji display beneath the raphe a trace of an\r\ninternal layer of loose cellular tissue which, however, has no\r\nappreciable effect on the buoyancy; whilst with seeds of Dioclea\r\n(violacea?) from the same locality there is a thick layer of loose\r\ntissue which aids the floating power of the kernel but is not of itself\r\nsufficiently aeriferous to buoy up the seed.\r\n\r\nThis leads one to refer to two other plants belonging to this group,\r\nCalophyllum inophyllum (Guttiferæ) and Ximenia americana (Olacineæ),\r\nwhere, though the floating power is mainly due to the buoyant kernel, it\r\nis also aided by a layer of air-bearing tissue inside the hard shell of\r\nthe “stone” of the drupe. Professor Schimper places these fruits in the\r\nthird or adaptive group on account of the layer of buoyant tissue, but\r\nit would be more correct to class them according to the predominant\r\ncause of their buoyancy. It can be shown that with a non-buoyant kernel\r\nthe “stone” no longer floats. This double cause of the floating power\r\nrenders an explanation very difficult, since it would seem indefensible\r\nto give conflicting interpretations of their nature. With Ximenia\r\namericana there is another great difficulty. Its drupes are known to be\r\ndispersed by fruit-pigeons (_Introd. Chall. Bot._ p. 46); and judging\r\nfrom the rare occurrence of the “stones” in the drift there is good\r\nreason to believe that bird agency in the Western Pacific is predominant\r\nin the dispersal of the plant. It is by such test cases as this that we\r\nmust put to the proof the reality or non-reality of the influence of\r\nadaptation on seed-buoyancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE THIRD GROUP.\r\n\r\nWe have here those plants where the floating-power is entirely or mainly\r\ndue to an air-bearing tissue in the seed-tests or fruit-coats. Several\r\nof the fruits are figured in Schimper’s _Indo-malayische Strand-flora_,\r\nand one or two are figured in the English edition of his work on\r\n_Plant-Geography_, p. 29.\r\n\r\nIn the first section, where the buoyant tissue occurs at the outside or\r\nforms the periphery of the seed or fruit, are included several of the\r\nmost familiar of the littoral trees and shrubs of the Pacific islands,\r\nsuch as Barringtonia speciosa, Cerbera Odollam, Guettarda speciosa,\r\nPemphis acidula, Scævola Kœnigii, Terminalia katappa, and several others\r\nnamed in the synopsis. I cannot enter into detail here, but the reader\r\nwill find fuller particulars of each plant in most cases in Professor\r\nSchimper’s work, and in some instances in my separate discussion of the\r\nplants concerned. In nearly all cases we are concerned here with the\r\nfruits, and only in a few cases with the seeds, as with Carapa and\r\nPemphis acidula.\r\n\r\nThis investigator observes that to this sub-group belong the fruits and\r\nseeds usually described in systematic works as provided with corky or\r\nsuberous coverings; but he points out (p. 167) that the resemblance is\r\nnearly always quite superficial, and is limited to colour and\r\nconsistence, suberous tissue occurring in only a few cases, as in the\r\nfruit-coats of Clerodendron inerme. The buoyant tissues, he remarks, are\r\noften more or less ligneous, and in those cases where there is no lignin\r\nreaction they resist the action of sulphuric acid much more effectively\r\nthan pure cellulose; whilst in their physical characters, as well as in\r\ntheir behaviour with reagents, they differ just as much from ordinary\r\ncork. Thus, they are but little elastic and often easily crumble away;\r\nwhilst in large fruits, like those of Cerbera and Terminalia, they would\r\nsoon be stripped off entirely when subjected to the “wear-and-tear” of\r\ntransport by currents, if they were not traversed by numbers of stout,\r\ntough fibres which hold the materials together. Where the buoyant\r\ntissues are firmer, as with Clerodendron inerme and Cordia subcordata,\r\nthe fibrous framework is scanty or absent, whilst very small seeds or\r\nfruits, like those of Tournefortia argentea and Pemphis acidula, where\r\nthe “wear-and-tear” would be comparatively slight, often possess no\r\nprotecting fibres in the buoyant tissues.\r\n\r\nIn one or two fruits, like those of Cerbera Odollam, these tissues\r\ndisplay large intercellular spaces; but in the majority of cases such\r\nspaces are insignificant in size or absent altogether. Speaking\r\ngenerally, however, there is, as Professor Schimper observes, great\r\nsimilarity in the structure of the buoyant tissue in the coverings of\r\nthese fruits and seeds. The cell-walls are thin or only slightly\r\nthickened, and detached air-bearing portions of the tissue will float\r\nfor many weeks. The great floating capacity of these fruits and seeds is\r\nstated by this investigator to be entirely due to the tenacity with\r\nwhich the air is retained in the covering tissues. It is, however,\r\nnoteworthy that in the case of Scævola Kœnigii the fruits are just as\r\nwell suited for dispersal by frugivorous birds as by the currents, a\r\nsignificant circumstance discussed in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nThe second section contains those plants where the buoyant tissue occurs\r\ninside the hard shell of the fruit or seed, such as is found, for\r\nexample, in Anona paludosa, Mucuna gigantea, Hernandia peltata, Cycas\r\ncircinalis, &c. Professor Schimper here includes Calophyllum inophyllum\r\nand Ximenia americana; but I have before remarked that the buoyancy of\r\ntheir fruits is mainly due to their buoyant kernels. This aeriferous\r\ntissue forms a layer between the seed or nucleus and the hard outer\r\nshell. It is described by the above-named authority as soft or friable\r\nand dark brown. The cells contain air and may be closely arranged or\r\nseparated by small interspaces, their walls being neither woody nor\r\nsuberous.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _The structure of the buoyant seeds and seedvessels of the littoral\r\n                     plants of the British flora._\r\n\r\nThe littoral plants with floating seeds or fruits form but a section of\r\nthe strand-plants of the British flora, scarcely a third, as is pointed\r\nout in Chapter IV., of the total number. Though small in number they\r\nexhibit great variety in structure; and notwithstanding that as far as\r\nthey have been examined they may all be referred to one or other of the\r\ngroups and sections of the classification adopted in the synopsis for\r\nthe plants of the Pacific islands, nearly every plant presents in the\r\nstructure of its seeds or seedvessels a type of buoyant structure\r\ndifferent from the others.\r\n\r\nThe first group is represented by the seeds of Convolvulus soldanella,\r\nwhich owe their floating power to the incomplete filling of the\r\nseed-cavity. The second group, where the buoyancy arises from the\r\nbuoyancy of the kernel or nucleus, is illustrated by the seeds of\r\nArenaria (Honckeneya) peploides, but in a fashion quite unique. The test\r\nis thin but impervious, and has no buoyancy; the curved embryo also\r\nsinks; and the floating power arises from the air contained in the loose\r\nspongy albumen, around which the embryo is coiled (see figure). A more\r\nnormal component of the second group is represented in some Leguminous\r\nseeds, perhaps of Lathyrus maritimus, that occur regularly amongst the\r\nstranded seed-drift of the north coast of Devon. Here the kernel of the\r\nseed is buoyant. The seeds of Euphorbia paralias are indebted for their\r\nfloating capacity to a layer of spongy tissue containing large\r\nair-spaces placed between the kernel and the chitinous outer test,\r\nneither of which possess any floating power (see figure). They thus\r\nbelong to the second section of the third group.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of Cakile maritima, Crithmum maritimum, Matricaria inodora,\r\nand Scirpus maritimus, all belong to the first subdivision of the third\r\ngroup where the air-bearing tissue exists in the peripheral coverings,\r\nthe seed or nucleus in all cases sinking. With Cakile maritima there is\r\na light spongy outer case of aeriferous tissue, which, however, soon\r\nloses the epidermis, a circumstance that probably explains the limited\r\nperiod of flotation of about a week. The walls of the mericarp of\r\nCrithmum maritimum are composed of spongy cellular air-bearing tissue\r\nwith a persistent epidermis, and the floating powers of the fruits are\r\nconsequently great. The achenes of Matricaria inodora have beneath the\r\nepidermis a layer of buoyant tissue, and their structure is similar to\r\nthat found with the buoyant achenes of littoral species of Wedelia,\r\nplants of the same order of Compositæ that are found on the Pacific\r\nislands. The cause of the floating power of the fruits of Scirpus\r\nmaritimus lies entirely, according to Kolpin Ravn, in the air-bearing\r\ncells of the epidermis. The reader will find the results of my\r\nexperiments on the buoyancy of the seeds in Notes 16, 17, and 18.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Summary of the Chapter._\r\n\r\n(1) Following the main lines of Schimper’s classification of those of\r\nthe Indo-Malayan region which possesses for the most part the same\r\nspecies, the buoyant seeds and fruits of the littoral plants of the\r\nPacific islands are classed in three groups: the _first_ where the\r\ncavity of the seed or fruit is incompletely filled, the floating power\r\narising from the empty space; the _second_ where the buoyancy is derived\r\nfrom the buoyant nucleus or kernel; and the _third_ where it arises from\r\nair-bearing tissues in the coats of the seed or fruit.\r\n\r\n(2) The first and second groups, in which the question of adaptation to\r\ndistribution by currents through the agency of Natural Selection is not\r\nraised, since the same structural characters are found in seeds and\r\nfruits of inland plants not dispersed by the currents, are termed the\r\nmechanical or non-adaptive groups. The third is distinguished as the\r\nadaptive group, because it is here that Schimper finds evidence in\r\nfavour of the Selection Theory.\r\n\r\n(3) The first group is best represented by the Convolvulaceous and the\r\nLeguminous types. In the former, which is well illustrated by Ipomœa pes\r\ncapræ, the seed-cavity is imperfectly filled by the crumpled embryo, the\r\nresult of the shrinking process during the final setting of the seed. In\r\nthe latter, which is exemplified by Entada scandens and Cæsalpinia\r\nbonducella, the seed displays a large central cavity produced by the\r\narching outward of the cotyledons during the shrinking process\r\naccompanying the last stage of the maturation of the seed. As an\r\ninstance of fruits belonging to the group, those of Heritiera littoralis\r\nmay be cited. An uncommon type is presented in the “stones” of the\r\ndrupes of Premna taitensis, and in the pyrenes of Morinda citrifolia,\r\nwhere the buoyancy arises from empty seed-cavities resulting from the\r\nfailure of some of the seeds.\r\n\r\n(4) The second group with buoyant kernels includes mostly widespread\r\nLeguminous species, such as Canavalia obtusifolia and Sophora tomentosa.\r\n\r\n(5) The third or “adaptive” group comprises many of the characteristic\r\nlittoral trees and shrubs of the Pacific islands, such as Barringtonia\r\nspeciosa, Guettarda speciosa, Terminalia katappa, Tournefortia argentea,\r\n&c., that contain in their fruit-coverings a buoyant cork-like material\r\noften bound together by fibres, but which proves on examination to\r\nresemble cork only in appearance. In another type, illustrated by the\r\nfruits of Cycas circinalis and the seeds of Anona paludosa, the buoyant\r\ntissue forms a layer inside the shell of the seed or “stone.”\r\n\r\n(6) Some fruits like those of Ximenia americana and Calophyllum\r\ninophyllum illustrate both the so-called mechanical and adaptive\r\nprinciples in their structure; whilst with the first-named species they\r\nare as well adapted for dispersal by frugivorous birds and are known to\r\nbe a favourite food of fruit-pigeons. The same difficulty arises with\r\nthe fruits of some other characteristic littoral plants, as with Scævola\r\nKœnigii, the drupes of which are equally well fitted for dispersal by\r\nbirds and currents.\r\n\r\n(7) The same general principles have been at work in determining the\r\nstructures concerned with the buoyancy of the fruits and seeds of\r\nBritish littoral plants. Although the species are few in number they\r\nexhibit in this respect great variety, eight species illustrating six or\r\nseven types of buoyant structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                      ADAPTATION AND SEED-BUOYANCY\r\n\r\nThe question of the operation of Natural Selection.—Are there two\r\n  principles at work?—The presence of buoyant tissue in the seed-tests\r\n  and fruit-coats of inland plants, both wild and cultivated.—Useless\r\n  buoyancy.—The buoyancy of seeds and fruits is not concerned with\r\n  adaptation.—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN we speak of a certain structure as an adaptation to dispersal by\r\ncurrents through the agency of Natural Selection, it is necessary at the\r\noutset to be quite clear as to what is implied. Professor Schimper, who\r\nbrought his great and varied knowledge of many other phases of\r\nplant-life to bear on this subject, is careful to clear the ground of\r\npreliminary erroneous conceptions in such a perspicuous and impartial\r\nmanner that we cannot do better than follow his guidance. There are, he\r\nobserves (p. 178), many mechanisms or contrivances in plants, which,\r\nthough they seem to have arisen with a fixed purpose, can in no wise be\r\nregarded as having been developed for that end, since they were produced\r\nin quite a different connection and have merely acquired a new or\r\nsupplementary function, of which they are the cause and not the effect.\r\n\r\nThis is very much the position that I have taken up for the whole\r\nsubject of the relation between plants and their dispersing agencies,\r\nand it will be found discussed in Chapter XI. It involves, as I venture\r\nto think, a dominant principle in the organic world, which it is one of\r\nthe objects of this work to emphasise, namely, that Nature in dispersing\r\nplants habitually makes use of structures and capacities that were\r\noriginally developed in quite another connection. Behind this change of\r\nfunction, this new purpose, lies the secret of the organic world. There\r\nis for me no more pregnant fact in plant-life than the thistle-seed\r\nblown before the wind, or the seed of our sea-convolvulus floating in\r\nthe sea. It proves to my mind that the evolutionary power in nature is\r\nchecked and hampered by conditions not of its own creation, and that two\r\nopposing forces are ever at work, the one creating and the other\r\nlimiting the creative power, the actual mode of dispersal being but a\r\nblind and accidental result of the struggle.\r\n\r\nThe question of the operation of Natural Selection is not raised, as\r\nProfessor Schimper indicates, until we consider whether the new function\r\nhas had any bettering influence on the structure or mechanism with which\r\nit has come to be concerned. If such a modification is thus brought\r\nabout it might be legitimately claimed as a result of this agency, and\r\nthe term “adaptation” could be used. But if there is no evident change\r\nproduced, we should be compelled to assign very subordinate limits to\r\nthe capacity of Natural Selection; and in the instance of buoyant fruits\r\nand seeds it would be restricted to determining a plant’s station by the\r\nwater-side and in increasing its area. It is only in the first case that\r\nwe could speak of them as adaptations in the meaning attached to this\r\nterm in the language of the Selection Theory. It would at first sight\r\nseem easy to ascertain whether the characters of fruits and seeds, to\r\nwhich the buoyancy is due, are adaptations in this sense of the word;\r\nbut in reality it is far from being so. We can, however, proceed with\r\nunanimity up to a certain stage in the argument; but there agreement\r\nends.\r\n\r\nIt has been before established that in the Pacific islands, and indeed\r\nin the tropics generally, the plants with buoyant seeds or seedvessels\r\nare mainly stationed at the coast. It has also already been shown that\r\nthis littoral station is often associated with a special buoyant-tissue\r\nin the coverings of the seed or fruit; and it will now be pointed out\r\nthat this tissue is, as a rule, absent or but scantily developed in the\r\ncase of inland species of the same genus. Of great importance, remarks\r\nProfessor Schimper (p. 179), in relation to the Selection Theory and the\r\ndevelopment of adaptations, is the comparison of the fruits and seeds of\r\nstrand-plants with those of allied inland species; and he finds here\r\nevidence in support of the Darwinian view. He takes the cases of the\r\ngenera Terminalia and Calophyllum, which contain both inland and\r\nlittoral species; and he shows that although the same buoyant-tissue\r\noccurs in the fruit-coats of inland species, it is there much\r\ndiminished, and in consequence the floating powers are considerably\r\nlessened or lost altogether (see Chapter II.). It is not pretended that\r\nthis tissue has had any connection in its origin with dispersal by\r\ncurrents, but merely that its greater development in the shore species\r\nis an adaptation to this mode of transport.\r\n\r\nFurther testimony is adduced by this investigator (p. 182) in supporting\r\nhis view in the fruits of the genera Barringtonia, Clerodendron, Cordia,\r\nand Guettarda, where the buoyant tissues extensively developed in the\r\ncoast species are either non-existent or only represented by a trace in\r\nthe inland species of the same genus, a difference in structure\r\nassociated with the loss or great diminution of the floating capacity of\r\nthe fruits concerned. I have been able to establish other examples in\r\nthe cases of the genera Scævola and Tacca, which will be found referred\r\nto in Chapter II.\r\n\r\nProfessor Schimper (p. 200) points to the circumstance that the\r\n“adaptations” in these fruits all belong to the diagnostic marks of the\r\ngenera and the species, and contends that these plants abundantly prove\r\nthe erroneous nature of the contention that Natural Selection could have\r\nplayed no part in the elimination of the strand-flora. My own contention\r\nis that Natural Selection has played such a part, but that in doing so\r\nit has merely availed itself of characters previously existing, without\r\noriginating, modifying, or improving them in any way. The foregoing\r\nevidence might with equal fitness be employed to show, as pointed out in\r\nChapter II., that in the course of ages there has been a great sorting\r\nprocess by which, excluding the mangroves, plants of the xerophilous\r\nhabit possessing buoyant seeds and fruits have been sorted out and\r\nplaced at the coast. Direct evidence does not lead us farther than to\r\nthe establishment of a littoral station for plants thus endowed. The\r\nproblem whether the characters of their fruits and seeds that are\r\nconcerned with buoyancy may be regarded as adaptive in the Darwinian\r\nsense lies beyond the reach of direct testimony. We can, however,\r\napproach it from the outside by several directions, and from some of\r\nthese we will now proceed to deal with it.\r\n\r\nThere is first the singular circumstance that in Fiji, when the littoral\r\nplants with buoyant seeds or fruits leave the beach and extend far\r\ninland, they, as a rule, retain their floating powers and, of course,\r\ntheir buoyant structures. I found this to be true of Cassytha\r\nfiliformis, Cerbera Odollam, Ipomœa pes capræ, Morinda citrifolia,\r\nScævola Kœnigii, and one or two other plants mentioned in Note 44, where\r\nthis subject is discussed. My experiments on these plants indicated that\r\ntheir fruits or seeds floated equally long, whether obtained from coast\r\nor from inland plants. This, at first sight, appears to present a\r\nserious objection to the adaptation theory; but it was not so regarded\r\nby Professor Schimper, who in a letter to me, dated March 8th, 1900,\r\nobserved that he did not see “why littoral plants growing inland should\r\nlose their adaptations to littoral life, especially if those adaptations\r\nare not conflicting with the conditions of life beyond the littoral\r\nzone, and if the competition does not require special adaptations.”\r\n\r\nMy view, however, is that any process of adaptation is unnecessary. All\r\nthese plants, it is contended, were originally inland plants that\r\nacquired the buoyant qualities of their seeds and fruits in the inland\r\nstations, and ultimately found a station at the coast through the\r\nsorting process above referred to. In the case of plants like Ipomœa pes\r\ncapræ and Cassytha filiformis this would be conceded, since they belong\r\nto the acknowledged non-adaptive groups discussed in the preceding\r\nchapter. It is only to some of these plants, such as Scævola Kœnigii and\r\nCerbera Odollam, that the adaptation view of Professor Schimper is\r\napplied; and the question arises whether we are justified in making such\r\na distinction, or, in other words, whether it is antecedently probable\r\nthat two independent principles have been at work in determining the\r\nfitness of seeds and fruits for dispersal by the currents.\r\n\r\nThe plants for which the influence of adaptation through Natural\r\nSelection is claimed belong, as stated in Chapter XII., almost entirely\r\nto the third group. It is admitted that with the other two groups the\r\nutmost that any sorting or selecting process would effect would be to\r\ndetermine a station at the coast and to extend the area of distribution.\r\nThe numerical aspect of the question therefore acquires some importance;\r\nand the reader’s attention is accordingly directed to the results\r\ntabulated in Note 45, where it is shown (assuming for the time that\r\nthere is no difference of opinion about the adaptive significance of the\r\nseeds and fruits concerned) that the plants of the third or adaptive\r\ngroup make up only about half the total. It would therefore appear that\r\nif the agencies of Natural Selection have been at work here either in\r\nbettering or in developing buoyant structures, half of the shore-plants\r\nwith buoyant seeds or fruits have not come within their influence.\r\n\r\nBut the subject takes another aspect when we reflect that in some\r\nbuoyant fruits, as with Ximenia americana and Calophyllum inophyllum,\r\nthe two principles would seem to have been at work. Whilst from this\r\nstandpoint Natural Selection is regarded as having either developed or\r\nincreased in amount the layer of buoyant tissue in the fruit-coats, the\r\nbuoyant kernels are not viewed as adaptive in their origin. In the case\r\nof Ximenia americana the dispersing agency of frugivorous birds adds\r\nanother factor, since, as before stated, its drupes are known to be\r\ndispersed by fruit-pigeons. In the cases of Scævola Kœnigii and of Vitex\r\ntrifolia, two plants belonging to the adaptive group, Professor Schimper\r\n(pp. 156, 188) admits also the dispersing agency of frugivorous birds,\r\nand he claims it for Morinda citrifolia, in the pyrenes of which he also\r\ndetects a special adaptation to dispersal by currents. It may be added\r\nthat, as he also points out, fruits of the non-adaptive group of\r\nlittoral plants, such as Premna integrifolia (P. taitensis) and Cassytha\r\nfiliformis, would sometimes also attract birds. In fact, those of the\r\nlast-named have been found in the crops of pigeons (_Introd. Chall.\r\nBot._, p. 46).\r\n\r\nLooking at all these littoral plants with fruits that are equally fitted\r\nfor dispersal by birds and by currents, we may now ask, Where does the\r\ngeneral principle of adaptation to dispersal lie? Whatever view we\r\nadopt, we must apply the same view to all, whether it be a question of\r\ndispersal by birds or by currents. We cannot choose between two sets of\r\nprinciples determining the buoyancy of seeds and fruits any more than we\r\ncan regard a fleshy drupe and a buoyant seed as illustrating different\r\nprinciples regulating the dispersal of plants. Nature works with\r\nuniformity in these matters, and if the Natural Selection theory is held\r\nto explain one case it ought to account for all. Yet nobody would go so\r\nfar as this; and this view of dispersal is on many grounds antecedently\r\nimprobable. These difficulties disappear if we assume that in all cases\r\nthe dispersing agencies have without modification made use of characters\r\nand capacities that were developed, as we now see them, in quite other\r\nconnections and under quite other conditions.\r\n\r\nIt will now be necessary to look a little closer into the subject of the\r\nbuoyant tissue, to the existence of which in their coats about half of\r\nthe littoral plants concerned owe the floating power of their fruits or\r\nseeds. In the first place, it is to be remarked that in the case of some\r\nof the seeds of the plants of the non-adaptive groups it is also\r\nrepresented to a small degree in the seed-coats, although, as with\r\nStrongylodon lucidum and Mucuna urens, it is not present in sufficient\r\namount to float the seed. In the next place, it should be noted that\r\nwith some genera possessing, like Terminalia, both inland and coast\r\nspecies it is to be found alike in the fruit-coverings of inland and of\r\nlittoral plants, though in a less degree in the case of the fruits of\r\ninland species, the floating power of which is proportionately\r\ndiminished. There are, however, a few cases where this buoyant tissue is\r\ndeveloped in inland species which belong to genera or subgenera that\r\nhave no littoral species. This is what we would expect, if Natural\r\nSelection has merely concerned itself with placing plants of xerophilous\r\nhabit possessing buoyant seeds or fruits at the coast. Under such\r\nconditions we would now and then expect to find an inland plant\r\npossessing buoyant fruits or seeds of this description that has never\r\nbeen able to establish itself at the coast.\r\n\r\nA good instance is afforded by Pritchardia Gaudichaudii, a fan palm\r\npeculiar to Hawaii, the drupes of which float for several weeks and have\r\na covering of spongy buoyant tissue (see Chapter XXV.). The seeds of\r\nHibiscus Abelmoschus, a species distinguished subgenerically from the\r\nlittoral Hibiscus tiliaceus, offer another example. They float for\r\nmonths, and owe their buoyancy to a layer of air-bearing tissue between\r\nthe kernel and the test, in this respect differing from the seeds of the\r\nlittoral species, where the floating power is due to unoccupied space in\r\nthe seed-cavity. The buoyancy of the seeds of Hibiscus Abelmoschus thus\r\noffers another example of ineffectual floating power, since it is not a\r\nlittoral plant, is often cultivated, and has accompanied aboriginal man\r\nover much of the tropical zone.\r\n\r\nA singular instance of the dispersal by currents of an inland plant that\r\noccurs both wild and cultivated in tropical America, the West Indies,\r\nand on the West Coast of Africa, is afforded by Spondias lutea, Linn.,\r\nwhich is referred to at the end of Chapter XXXII. Its “stones,” which\r\nare provided with a cork-like covering much as we find with those of\r\nCordia subcordata and Guettarda speciosa, possess great buoyancy, and\r\nare found in the river and beach drift of those regions with the seeds\r\nin a sound condition.\r\n\r\nA very remarkable case of ineffectual buoyancy is presented by the\r\nseedvessels of Brackenridgea, which have been found floating in the\r\ndrift off the coast of New Guinea. They owe their floating power to\r\nclosed cavities which would seem to arise from the failure of one of the\r\nseeds or from the abortion of an ovule. But, according to Beccari, their\r\nfleshy coverings would aid their dispersal by frugivorous birds; and\r\nsince the species are all much localised and are rarely littoral in\r\ntheir habit, it is very probable that birds have mainly effected the\r\ndispersal of the genus (see Note 46). It has, however, been shown in the\r\nprevious chapter that Premna taitensis and Morinda citrifolia owe their\r\ndispersal by currents to similar cavities in the seeds or “stones.”\r\n\r\nAmongst the inland plants possessing seeds or fruits that are dispersed\r\nby the currents without aiding the distribution of the species may be\r\nrecognised types of both the adaptive and non-adaptive groups. A\r\nsingular instance is afforded by the large seeds almost an inch long of\r\na huge pumpkin (Cucurbita) which, in sound condition, form one of the\r\ncommonest constituents of the beach drift on the coast of Chile from\r\nValparaiso northward to Iquique. The fruit is commonly eaten by the\r\nlower classes. The seeds, which are very buoyant, contain a kernel that\r\ndoes not float, the buoyancy being due to the water-tight coats which,\r\nas shown in the plate in Chapter XII., possess well developed\r\nair-bearing tissues. It may here be observed that Martins refers to the\r\ngermination of seeds of Cucurbita pepo after 45 and 93 days’ flotation\r\nin sea-water.\r\n\r\nOne sometimes finds buoyant tissue developed in the seeds of\r\nbottle-gourds, where it can serve no useful purpose of dispersal. Thus\r\nsmall bottle-gourds, seemingly of the genus Cucurbita rather than of\r\nLagenaria, are to be commonly found afloat in the Guayaquil River and\r\nstranded on the Ecuador beaches. They will float for many months, and\r\ncontain the seeds dried up into a small loose compacted mass in their\r\ninterior. These seeds, which contain a layer of spongy air-bearing\r\ntissue in their coverings, will in several cases float for months. Some\r\nthat I had been keeping two months afloat in sea-water germinated\r\nfreely. It is shown in Note 47 that bottle-gourds containing sound seeds\r\nare dispersed far and wide by the currents. In some species the seeds\r\nare buoyant, and in others they sink in sea-water; but the gourds\r\nthemselves will float for probably a year or more, and the floating\r\ncapacity of the seeds when it exists is too insignificant to affect the\r\nfruit’s buoyancy.\r\n\r\nOther instances of the useless buoyancy of fruits of inland plants are\r\nafforded by different species of Citrus. In the floating drift of the\r\nFijian rivers the fruits of the wild and indigenous Shaddock (C.\r\ndecumana) and of an inedible Orange, also wild and indigenous (C.\r\nvulgaris?), are at certain times to be found, the latter often in\r\nnumbers. The first-named floats four to five weeks in sea-water, and the\r\nlast-named nearly two months, and both are to be observed floating out\r\nat sea between the islands. The fruits of the Tahitian Orange, a variety\r\nof C. aurantium, floated in sea-water between three and four weeks. The\r\nseeds of these and other species of Citrus sank in from a few hours to a\r\nday or two. The buoyancy of the fruit depends on the rind—the thicker\r\nthe rind the greater the floating power. This was not only shown in the\r\nlength of the period of flotation, but also in the buoyant behaviour of\r\nthe fruit. With the Tahitian Orange, where the rind is relatively thin,\r\nthe fruits floated heavily in sea-water and only protruded slightly\r\nabove the surface. With the Shaddock and with the other indigenous\r\nspecies of Citrus, the fruits floated lightly and protruded half-way out\r\nof the water.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing trivial in these examples of buoyant fruits. That they\r\nhave at times aided in the dispersal of the genus, with man’s assistance\r\nin planting the seeds of the stranded fruits, I cannot doubt; but\r\nunaided by man such buoyant capacities would be useless for purposes of\r\neffective dispersal by currents. Between the two genera Terminalia and\r\nCitrus there is this great distinction, that the former is more or less\r\nhalophilous, some of its species being at home on the sea-beaches,\r\nwhilst the latter, as Schimper would term it, is salt-shy, and includes\r\nno halophytes or plants of the sea-shore amongst its species. The only\r\neffect of buoyancy of the fruits on the distribution of the species of\r\nCitrus would be to place them by the side of the river and the pond.\r\nThis has evidently been its result in the case of the Shaddock in Fiji,\r\nwhere, as Seemann remarks, it often thickly lines the banks of the\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nAs also indicating that the buoyancy of the seed or fruit would never,\r\napart from the halophilous habit, endow an inland plant with a littoral\r\nstation, the examples of the Oak (Quercus robur) and of the Hazel\r\n(Corylus avellana) may be taken. As shown in Note 48, these fruits\r\nacquire floating power by drying, on account of the space formed by the\r\nshrinking of the kernel. They occur commonly in beach drift, but rarely\r\nin a sound condition; yet experiment has proved that they will sometimes\r\ngerminate after prolonged sea-water flotation. The fruits of other\r\nspecies of Quercus are also transported in tropical regions by the\r\ncurrents, but never, as far as I could learn, effectively. The Amentaceæ\r\nas an order are “salt-shy,” and with only a few exceptions shun the\r\nsea-beach.\r\n\r\nIn the great sorting-process, by which xerophytic plants with buoyant\r\nseeds or fruits have been placed at the coast, and hygrophytic plants\r\nwith similar fruits or seeds have been stationed at the riverside or by\r\nponds and lakes, one might expect to find that other influences may have\r\nat times been in conflict with the selecting operation here indicated.\r\nTo this cause may probably be attributed the cases of “useless buoyancy”\r\nabove referred to. Here we find in some inland plants fruits and seeds\r\nwith buoyant tissues in their coverings that in the case of littoral\r\nplants would have been regarded as the result of adaptation to dispersal\r\nby currents. Such cases go to emphasize the conclusion already indicated\r\nthat these tissues could not have been developed through the agency of\r\nNatural Selection. But the great objection against the application of\r\nthe Darwinian view to the general subject of the buoyancy of the seeds\r\nand fruits of littoral plants lies in the circumstance that quite half\r\nof the plants concerned are admitted to be outside the scope of the\r\ntheory, and that for these another explanation has to be found. I think\r\nwe may fairly claim that in a matter which finally resolves itself into\r\na question of buoyancy one explanation should cover all. We have thus to\r\ndecide whether to regard as adaptations to dispersal by currents the\r\nstructures of the buoyant seeds and fruits of littoral plants; or\r\nwhether to hold the view that as far as dispersal by currents is\r\nconcerned such structures are purely accidental, and that Nature has\r\nnever directly concerned herself in the matter at all. The first\r\nexplanation lies under the disadvantage above alluded to, and it remains\r\nto be learned whether the second view could be made to cover all cases\r\nof dispersal by currents. Further investigation on many points is yet\r\nrequired; but, apart from the evidence against Natural Selection as the\r\nprincipal agency that has been produced in this chapter, a powerful\r\nargument in favour of the view that the buoyancy of seeds and fruits is\r\nnot concerned with adaptation is, that as a rule the floating capacity\r\nof the seed or fruit has no direct relation with the density of\r\nsea-water. Generally speaking, as shown in Chapter X., these seeds and\r\nfruits are much more buoyant than they need to be, that is to say, if\r\nthey owe their floating power to adaptation to dispersal by currents.\r\nThis is quite in accordance with the argument developed in Chapter XI.\r\nwith regard to the general question of plant-distribution, that\r\ndispersing agencies make use of characters and capacities of seeds and\r\nfruits that were never intended for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Summary of the Chapter._\r\n\r\n(1) There are many mechanisms or contrivances in plants that now serve a\r\npurpose for which they were not originally developed.\r\n\r\n(2) Of this nature, it is contended, is the relation between fruits and\r\nseeds and the agencies of dispersal.\r\n\r\n(3) If, however, the structure or mechanism is made more effective by\r\nthe new function, such a modification may be regarded as an “adaptation”\r\nin the language of the theory of Natural Selection.\r\n\r\n(4) It is held by Professor Schimper that the structures connected with\r\nthe buoyancy of the fruits or seeds of several tropical littoral plants\r\nare, in the above sense, adaptations; and he points to several genera\r\nwhere the buoyant tissues in the coverings of the fruits or seeds of the\r\ncoast species are scantily represented or absent in the inland species\r\nof the same genus, a difference corresponding with the loss or\r\ndiminution of the floating powers.\r\n\r\n(5) This contrast in structure and in floating capacity between the\r\nfruits or seeds of inland and coast species of the same genus is beyond\r\ndispute, and the author adduces fresh data in support of it.\r\n\r\n(6) But he contends that it is not proved that the relatively great\r\ndevelopment of buoyant tissues in the case of littoral plants is the\r\neffect of adaptation; and that if the selecting process had been\r\nconfined to sorting out the xerophilous plants with buoyant seeds or\r\nfruits and to placing them at the coast, the same contrast would have\r\nbeen produced.\r\n\r\n(7) In support of this contention he points out that when such littoral\r\nplants extend inland the floating capacity and the buoyant tissues are\r\nas a rule retained; and that in those exceptional cases where inland\r\nplants possess buoyant fruits or seeds these tissues are sometimes well\r\ndeveloped under conditions in which they could never aid the plant’s\r\ndispersal.\r\n\r\n(8) But the most serious objection against the adaptation view is that\r\nadmittedly only about half of the shore-plants with buoyant fruits or\r\nseeds come within its scope. Therefore a second explanation has to be\r\nframed for the other plants concerned.\r\n\r\n(9) As showing the difficulties raised by regarding some of the\r\nstructures connected with buoyancy as “adaptive” and others as\r\n“accidental,” it is pointed out that some fruits possess the two kinds\r\nof structure. It is also shown that in several cases fruits endowed with\r\nbuoyant tissues are just as well adapted for dispersal by frugivorous\r\nbirds; and the instance of Ximenia americana is cited where a drupaceous\r\nfruit, known to be dispersed by fruit-pigeons, possesses also in its\r\n“stone” both the “adaptive” and “non-adaptive” types of “buoyant\r\nstructures.”\r\n\r\n(10) It is urged that whatever is the relation between the buoyancy of\r\nthe seeds and fruits of shore-plants and dispersal by currents, there\r\nhas been a uniform principle affecting all.\r\n\r\n(11) The weight of evidence is regarded as adverse to the Natural\r\nSelection theory, an inference which is consistent with the conclusion\r\narrived at in Chapter X. that there is no direct relation between the\r\ndensity of sea-water and the buoyancy of seeds and fruits, the floating\r\ncapacities being as a rule far greater than the adaptation view would\r\nexplain. Nature, it is held, has never made any provision for dispersal\r\nby currents, the buoyancy of seeds and fruits being, as concerns the\r\ncurrents, a purely accidental quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n            THE RELATION BETWEEN LITTORAL AND INLAND PLANTS\r\n\r\nProfessor Schimper’s views.—Great antiquity of the\r\n  mangrove-formation.—Problem mainly concerned with the\r\n  derivation of inland from littoral plants.—Grouping of\r\n  the genera possessing both coast and inland\r\n  species.—Scævola.—Morinda.—Calophyllum.—Colubrina.—Tacca.—Vigna.—Premna.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN discussing the relation between the littoral and inland floras in the\r\nPacific it will be at first necessary to pick up some of the threads of\r\nthe various lines of investigation dealt with in the previous portion of\r\nthis work. Apart from considerations connected with the genetic history\r\nof the plants concerned, when we come to inquire into the sources of any\r\nindividual strand-flora, whether in the temperate or in the tropical\r\nregions, we arrive at the rough and ready inference that it is composed\r\nof “what the sea sends and the land lends.” But it has been already\r\nshown that the relative proportion of the current-borne and in\r\nconsequence widely dispersed plants in a strand-flora varies greatly in\r\ndifferent regions. Thus in the Pacific islands, as typified by those of\r\nFiji, about 90 per cent. have buoyant seeds or seedvessels originally\r\nbrought from distant localities; and in the tropics, as a rule, the\r\naverage would probably be never under 75 per cent. On the other hand, in\r\na temperate region the plants derived from inland would be most\r\npredominant, making up probably some three-fourths of the whole, whilst\r\nthe proportion of current-dispersed plants hailing from distant places\r\nwould be relatively few.\r\n\r\nIt is on this account that there is such uniformity in the general\r\ncomposition of the strand-flora over a large part of the tropics, since\r\ncurrent-dispersed plants are widely spread. But in the temperate regions\r\nwe find a great contrast in this respect. There are, it is true, a few\r\ncurrent-borne plants that one meets everywhere. For instance,\r\nConvolvulus soldanella is to be gathered on English beaches and on those\r\nof New Zealand and of the coast of Chile. But these littoral plants with\r\nbuoyant fruits hardly give a feature to the strand-flora. A multitude of\r\nintruders, either characteristic of the inland flora of the region or\r\nconfined only to the seaboard of that part of the world, also make their\r\nhome on the beach and frequently endow a beach-flora with its leading\r\nfeatures. The possible associations of plants on a beach in a temperate\r\nregion are thus very great; and I have already discussed this in part in\r\nChapter IV. as concerning the British shore-flora. One has only to look\r\nat a work like that of Dr. Willkomm on the vegetation of the strand and\r\nsteppe-regions of the Iberian peninsula to realise how the few littoral\r\nplants familiar to the English eye cut but a sorry figure amongst the\r\nnumbers of strange intruders from the arid regions inland. So again, as\r\nI found on the Chilian beaches, Convolvulus soldanella finds odd\r\nassociates amongst the species of Nolana and Franseria that are peculiar\r\nto the coasts of that part of the globe (see Chapter XXXII.); and\r\ndifferent grotesque American forms of the Cactaceæ with a\r\nMesembryanthemum and a host of strange-looking plants descend from the\r\narid slopes of the hills behind to keep company with the far-travelled\r\nEnglish beach-plant (see Note 49). Or again, a glance at the pages of\r\nProfessor Schimper’s great work on _Plant-Geography_ will bring the same\r\nfact home in a still more varied fashion.\r\n\r\nYet on tropical coasts the intruding inland element is also\r\ndistinguishable, though it may influence only to a small degree the\r\ngeneral character of the strand-flora. Dividing it, as we have described\r\nin Chapter V., into the plants of the sandy beach and of the\r\nmangrove-swamp, we find in the mangroves the most stable element and in\r\nthe beach-plants those most liable to change. Professor Schimper\r\nobserves that whilst the physiognomy of the beach-flora varies to some\r\nextent with the alterations in the inland flora, the mangrove-formation\r\nmakes but a slow response to such changes. As he points out in his work\r\non the Indo-Malayan Strand-Flora (p. 199), seeds and seedvessels are\r\nbeing continually brought down to the sea-coast through the agencies of\r\nrivers, winds, and birds; and in this manner, in the course of ages, the\r\nbeach-flora is recruited from the inland plants. But for the mangroves\r\nsuch additions to their numbers are rarely possible. Whilst the same\r\ngenera are often shared by both the beach and inland floras, we have in\r\nthe mangrove-formation families, sub-families, and genera almost\r\npeculiar to itself, and including plants, like those of the Rhizophoreæ,\r\nthat in their characters betray but little kinship with others and give\r\nbut little indication of their descent. The mangroves have remained\r\nthrough the ages as something apart from other coast-plants, isolated\r\nboth in their history and in their characters, and especially\r\ndistinguished by their “adaptations” to their surroundings.\r\n\r\nSuch is the line of argument followed by this eminent German botanist in\r\nhis account of the development of a tropical strand-flora. In various\r\nparts of this work I have ventured to suggest that the mangroves may be\r\nthe remnant of an ancient flora widely distributed over the lower levels\r\nand coastal regions of the globe in an age when vivipary (meaning,\r\nthereby, germination on the plant) was the rule rather than the\r\nexception. At such a period, as I imagine, the climatic conditions of\r\nthe earth were much more uniform than they are at present, at least in\r\nthe lower levels; and a warm atmosphere, charged with aqueous vapour and\r\nheavy with mist and cloud, enveloped a large portion of the globe. The\r\nmangroves, it may be remarked, are by no means universally distributed\r\non tropical coasts in our own time. (Professor Schimper describes their\r\ndistribution in his _Indo-malayische Strand-Flora_, pp. 85, 86, and in\r\nthe English edition of his _Plant-Geography_, p. 409.) They are not\r\nfound on rainless coasts even when under the Line, except where there\r\nhappen to be large estuaries; but where a rank and luxuriant inland\r\nflora betokens a high degree of humidity, there they thrive. This is\r\nwell illustrated on the rainless shores of tropical Peru, a locality\r\ndescribed in Chapter XXXII. of this work.\r\n\r\nYet if, as it is here contended, the mangroves form a remnant of a once\r\nwidely spread viviparous flora, it might be expected that the\r\nbeach-plants of that age would have been also viviparous, and that with\r\ntheir present descendants, as well as with some of the inland plants\r\nallied to them, we ought to find in the anomalous structure of the seed\r\nsome indication of the lost viviparous habit. This appears to be the\r\ncase, as described in Note 50, with the Barringtoniæ, a tribe that has\r\nsupplied some of the most characteristic beach-trees, and also with some\r\ngenera of the Guttiferæ. Perhaps, indeed, when the seeds of several\r\nother littoral beach-trees come to be examined, for instance, Guettarda,\r\nanalogous structures may be found.\r\n\r\nAlthough the beach-flora of the tropics is less stable in its\r\ncomposition than the mangrove-formation, it is not to be assumed that in\r\nthe Pacific region or in the tropics generally it is at all modern in\r\nits character. Though in the main, no doubt, more recent than the\r\nmangroves, since it is likely that in early geological periods the swamp\r\nrather than the sandy beach formed the predominant feature of the\r\nsea-border throughout the tropics, yet it bears in several respects the\r\nimpress of a high antiquity. There are few beach plants in the tropical\r\nPacific that are not found over the tropics of a large portion of the\r\nglobe, a circumstance that would in itself warrant our assigning a great\r\nage to the beach-flora; and it is highly probable that some at least of\r\nthe beach plants of the Pacific that occur on the east and west coasts\r\nof tropical America are, for reasons given in Chapter XXXII., older than\r\nthe barrier now interposed by Central America between the Atlantic and\r\nPacific oceans. There are, it is true, a few species, like Acacia\r\nlaurifolia and Drymispermum Burnettianum, which, on account of their\r\nrestriction to the beaches of the Western Pacific and their lack of\r\ncapacity for dispersal by currents, may be regarded as local\r\nproductions; but for the great majority, ranging as they do over much of\r\nthe tropics, it is not possible to determine when and where they assumed\r\ntheir littoral habits. That except in a few instances their home in some\r\nbygone age lay outside the Pacific can scarcely be doubted.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore to be expected that in a discussion of the relation\r\nbetween the strand and inland floras in the Pacific islands the problem\r\nwill be mainly concerned with the possible derivation of inland from\r\nlittoral plants. In such a discussion the relation between the beach and\r\ninland species of the same genus becomes a subject of great interest. It\r\nis a subject that had a peculiar fascination for Professor Schimper, who\r\nrefers to it more than once in his pages; and though never able to take\r\nit up, he viewed it as a very promising field of inquiry. The question\r\nhas been frequently alluded to in this work; and it is especially dealt\r\nwith in one connection in Chapter II. It is there shown that whilst, as\r\na general rule, the seeds or seedvessels of the coast species possess\r\ngreat floating power, those of the inland species of the same genus have\r\nlittle or none, and that both may have independent modes of dispersal,\r\nthe first by currents, and the last through frugivorous birds.\r\n\r\nA close connection between the beach and inland floras is apparently\r\ndisplayed in the circumstance that quite a third of the genera of the\r\nPacific insular floras containing littoral species (some 70 in all,\r\nexcluding the mangroves) possess in this region also inland species. But\r\nthe further examination of this interesting group of genera, which are\r\nenumerated in the list below, goes to show that the connection between\r\nthe inland and coast species of a genus is by no means always so close,\r\nor of such a character, as one might have expected. It will not be\r\npossible, however, to do much more than indicate in this chapter the\r\nresults of this inquiry; but the details will usually be found either in\r\nthe separate discussion of the genus or in other parts of this work. For\r\nconvenience of treatment these genera may be grouped in the following\r\nsections.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Grouping of the Plant-Genera of the Islands of the Tropical Pacific\r\n            that possess both Littoral and Inland Species._\r\n\r\nSection I. Where the littoral and inland species are most probably of\r\nindependent origin, both possessing their own means of dispersal;\r\nCalophyllum, Hibiscus, Colubrina, Morinda, Scævola, Cordia, Ipomœa,\r\nVitex, Tacca, Casuarina.\r\n\r\nSection II. Where the littoral species have probably given rise to\r\ninland species, and both still exist in the group of islands: Vigna,\r\nPremna.\r\n\r\nSection III. Where inland species have been probably developed from\r\nlittoral species no longer existing in the group: Canavalia, Erythrina,\r\nSophora, Ochrosia.\r\n\r\nSection IV. Where the littoral and inland species are evidently of\r\nindependent origin, and there is no means of accounting for the\r\nexistence of the inland species by agencies of dispersal at present in\r\noperation: Barringtonia, Pandanus.\r\n\r\nSection V. Where in the same genus some inland species are derivatives\r\nof the coast species and others are of independent origin: Guettarda.\r\n\r\nSection VI. Where the coast species, having little or no capacity for\r\ndispersal by currents, are regarded as derived from the inland species\r\nin one group of islands and as afterwards distributed to those in the\r\nvicinity: Eugenia, Drymispermum, Acacia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SECTION I\r\n\r\nThis group, which includes those genera where the coast and inland\r\nspecies are regarded as of independent origin, both possessing their own\r\nmeans of dispersal, contains about half of the total number of genera\r\nhere concerned. We will first deal with the genera Calophyllum, Morinda,\r\nand Scævola, where the littoral species have buoyant fruits or seeds\r\nthat are dispersed by currents, whilst the inland species have more or\r\nless non-buoyant fleshy fruits that could only be dispersed by\r\nfrugivorous birds. Here the inland and coast species could have arrived\r\nindependently at the island, and we are not called upon either on this\r\nground or by reason of affinity of characters to connect the one with\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nThe genus Scævola is very typical of its kind and has been already in\r\npart discussed in Chapter II. The wide-ranging shore-species, S.\r\nKœnigii, that is distributed over the Pacific may sometimes, as in\r\nHawaii, be accompanied by numerous inland species, all endemic, seven of\r\nthem being enumerated by Hillebrand; or, as in Fiji and Tonga, there may\r\nbe associated with it a solitary inland species, S. floribunda (see Note\r\n51); or, as in Tahiti, it may exist by itself. On the other hand, as in\r\nthe Kermadec Islands, a single inland peculiar species may alone\r\nrepresent the genus. The inland species have fleshy drupes which, as far\r\nas examined, have no floating power and possess no buoyant tissues in\r\ntheir coverings; and their independent dispersal by birds cannot be\r\ndoubted. The endemic character of most of the inland species of the\r\nPacific islands is most probably due to the suspension of the\r\ntransporting agency of frugivorous birds, just as the wide range of the\r\nsolitary littoral species may be attributed to the uninterrupted agency\r\nof the currents. There is nothing in the description of the endemic\r\nspecies given in Hillebrand’s _Hawaiian Flora_ to indicate any especial\r\ngenetic connection between the inland species and the beach plant, S.\r\nKœnigii; and the occurrence of a solitary inland peculiar species in the\r\nKermadec Islands clearly proves an origin independent of any littoral\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nMorinda is another critical genus in this discussion. Besides the\r\nwidespread littoral species (M. citrifolia) that is distributed by the\r\ncurrents and is also dispersed by man, there are in the Pacific islands\r\na number of inland species, mostly climbers and denizens of the forests.\r\nIn the _Index Kewensis_ six are accredited to Fiji and five to New\r\nCaledonia. Hillebrand gives a peculiar Hawaiian species, and there is a\r\nwidespread species (M. Forsteri) that ranges over the South Pacific from\r\nNew Caledonia to the Marquesas and the Paumotu Islands. Since, as\r\nindicated in Chapter II. and in Note 8, the pyrenes of the fruits of the\r\ninland species are not dispersed by the currents and could readily be\r\ntransported by frugivorous birds, we are not called upon to connect them\r\nin their origin with M. citrifolia, the wide-ranging species of tropical\r\nbeaches.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the dispersal of certain inland species of the genus over\r\nlarge areas of the tropics, such as in the case of Morinda umbellata\r\nthrough tropical Asia and Malaya, and M. Forsteri in the Pacific, is\r\nindeed sufficient proof that these inland plants are independent of any\r\nlittoral species in the Pacific and possess their own means of\r\ndistribution. Though the genus, comprising at least forty species, is\r\nmainly confined to the Old World, there are a few species in America;\r\nbut M. citrifolia, the familiar beach species of the Old World and the\r\nPacific, is not indigenous there, and, as far as I can gather, all the\r\nAmerican species belong inland. Facts of distribution of this nature\r\nnegative the possibility that the Pacific islands have received their\r\ninland species of Morinda through the intervention of the far-ranging\r\nlittoral plant.\r\n\r\nAs respecting Calophyllum, which is represented all over the tropical\r\nSouth Pacific by the wide-ranging C. inophyllum and by a tree of the\r\ninland forests found also in Malaya and in Ceylon (C. spectabile), there\r\nare, apart from questions of affinity, grave objections against the\r\nderivation of the same inland species from the coast species all over\r\nthis area. The fruits of the two inland species of Fiji, C. spectabile\r\nand C. burmanni, have sappy outer coverings and are quite suited for\r\ndispersal by fruit-pigeons. As observed in Chapter II. and Note 9, they\r\nhave limited floating capacities and their dispersal by birds is\r\nnecessary to explain their distribution. Since the timber is greatly\r\nvalued by the Polynesians, it is not unlikely, however, that those\r\nislanders have assisted in the distribution of the inland species. It is\r\nnot possible to do more than touch on this subject here; but it may be\r\ninferred that the history of Calophyllum in the Pacific has not been one\r\nthat would warrant our regarding the inland trees as derivatives of a\r\ncoast species.\r\n\r\nThere are other genera of this section where, for reasons of a different\r\ncharacter, there is no cause for assuming that the inland species are\r\nderived from the coast species, or _vice versâ_. Thus, in Fiji,\r\nCasuarina equisetifolia, a widely distributed species of the Old World,\r\noccurs at the coast and in the scantily wooded plains behind; while C.\r\nnodiflora, a New Caledonian species, finds its home in the lower\r\nforests. There are many endemic species in Australia and New Caledonia;\r\nand we are not called on to connect together these two species in Fiji.\r\nIn the same way we are not under any obligation in the case of the\r\nnumerous inland species of Ipomœa of the Pacific islands to connect them\r\nwith the coast species. They are all widely ranging species, and their\r\nseeds have been carried to the islands, each in its own fashion. So\r\nagain with the inland species of Hibiscus found in the Polynesian\r\nislands and often cultivated, we cannot either from the point of view of\r\ndispersal or of affinity connect them with the far-ranging littoral\r\nspecies, H. tiliaceus, which belongs to a section of the genus distinct\r\nfrom those sections to which the inland species belong.\r\n\r\nIn a similar way there is no ground for supposing that Cordia aspera, an\r\ninland species confined to Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa, is derived from C.\r\nsubcordata, the widely distributed littoral species of the Pacific and\r\nof the Old World, since they belong to different sections of the genus.\r\nBut, apart from any question of affinity, the drupes of inland species\r\nof Cordia are known to be well suited for dispersal by frugivorous\r\nbirds, though, unlike the littoral species above named, not adapted for\r\ntransportal by the currents. The genus Vitex, which is represented by a\r\nwide-ranging littoral species in the Pacific (V. trifolia), appears to\r\nbe associated with inland species only in Fiji, where one or two,\r\nseemingly endemic, occur. But there is nothing in Dr. Seemann’s\r\ndescription of V. vitiensis, one of these species, that at all suggests\r\nits derivation from the strand species, a very variable plant that often\r\nextends far inland into the plains, adopting a different habit of growth\r\nin those localities. It is known that Vitex fruits can be dispersed both\r\nby birds and by currents. This genus is more fully discussed in a later\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nOf the genus Colubrina there seem to be only two Pacific species\r\nknown—one the widely distributed shore-plant, C. asiatica, a straggling\r\nshrub with alternate leaves found in all the Pacific groups and on the\r\nbeaches of much of the tropics of the Old World; the other a tree, C.\r\noppositifolia, with opposite leaves, that is peculiar to the Hawaiian\r\nislands, where it frequents the open-wooded and scrubby inland\r\ndistricts. The seeds of the shore-plant float unharmed for many months,\r\nwhilst the fruits of the inland plant, which differ in some important\r\nrespects (see Note 52), would float only for a week or two. The strand\r\nspecies is also quite at home inland in many parts of the world; and\r\nthere is nothing from the standpoint of affinity to indicate that in\r\nHawaii it has given birth to an inland species so divergent in habit and\r\nin character. There is of course the difficulty of explaining how a\r\nplant like C. oppositifolia, with such a dry, unattractive fruit, could\r\nbe indebted to birds for its original introduction into the group; but\r\nthe same difficulty arises with a host of Hawaiian plants. It is,\r\nhowever, evident from its distribution over the islands of this\r\narchipelago that it possesses or has possessed some means of\r\ninter-island dispersal, and since it is not of much service to the\r\naborigines we must look therefore to the bird.\r\n\r\nIn the instance of the genus Tacca there is in Fiji an inland species,\r\nT. maculata, associated with a wide-ranging beach species, T.\r\npinnatifida, which also grows inland. The first-named is recorded from\r\nthe north coast of Australia and from Samoa, and though, unlike the\r\nbeach plant, its seeds are unfitted for dispersal by currents (see\r\nChapter II.), they might be distributed by birds. Dr. Reinecke describes\r\nanother inland species from Samoa, T. samoensis. The beach plant, T.\r\npinnatifida, grows so typically (sometimes side by side with T.\r\nmaculata) in the inland plains of Fiji that one would not be justified,\r\napart from questions of affinity, in regarding it as the parent form of\r\ninland species in the Pacific islands.\r\n\r\nFor food and other purposes Tacca pinnatifida is or was much valued by\r\nthe Pacific islanders, and it grows so abundantly that cultivation is\r\nrarely practised. That the Polynesians have aided the currents in the\r\ndistribution of the plant there can be no doubt, and this is\r\nparticularly indicated by its occurrence in Hawaii. The genus contains\r\nten or a dozen species, of which at least three are peculiar to America;\r\nbut T. pinnatifida, the characteristic shore-plant of the Old World, and\r\naccording to Schimper the only one that can be so designated, is not\r\nfound in America, where, as far as I can gather, there is no\r\nwidely-spread beach species dispersed by the currents from which the\r\npeculiar species could have been derived. In the case of the Pacific\r\nspecies, however, it should be noted that I am not endeavouring to prove\r\nthe improbability of the inland species having been derived from the\r\ncoast species in other regions, as in Australia, but that my point is to\r\nshow there is no reason to suppose that this has taken place in the\r\nPacific. There is no difficulty in attributing the dispersal of inland\r\nspecies to birds; and we are therefore not called on to connect them\r\nwith the beach plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SECTION II\r\n\r\nThis division includes those genera where the littoral species has\r\napparently given rise to one or more inland species and both still exist\r\nin the same group of islands. Two genera alone, Vigna and Premna, come\r\ninto this category. The first-named seems to present a good case for the\r\nderivation of an inland from a coast species in Hawaii. Besides Vigna\r\nlutea, the beach species, which is found not only all over the Pacific\r\nislands but on the tropical beaches of the Old World, there are in\r\nHawaii two endemic species (V. sandwicensis and V. oahuensis) that occur\r\nin the mountains, usually at elevations of from 1,500 to 5,000 feet; but\r\nI do not find any more inland species recorded from the other Polynesian\r\narchipelagoes. It may at first be noted that Vigna lutea, which in some\r\nparts of the world strays inland, displays considerable variety in its\r\nlittoral station in the Pacific. Thus, in Hawaii, I found it sometimes\r\non the sandy beach, sometimes on a rocky shore, and sometimes on the\r\nedge of old lava-cliffs overlooking the sea. In Fiji, though usually a\r\ntrailer on the beach, it may become a climber hanging from the trees\r\nbordering the creeks in the mangrove-swamps. Though Hillebrand makes no\r\nmention of forms intermediate between coast and inland species in\r\nHawaii, I found in one locality at the coast some specimens of Vigna\r\nlutea displaying the twisted pods and two callosities on the standard\r\nthat are characteristic of V. sandwicensis, one of the inland species.\r\nThe seeds of Vigna lutea float in sea-water unharmed for months, and\r\nthey are to be found in the stranded drift of the Hawaiian and Fijian\r\nbeaches, and floating in the drift of the Fijian rivers. I was unable to\r\nobtain the mature seeds of the inland species, and it has therefore yet\r\nto be determined whether they follow the rule in the loss of buoyancy.\r\nIt may be added that a plant of Vigna lutea raised in Hawaii from seed\r\ndisplayed some small tubers of the size of a pea on its roots.\r\n\r\nThe case for Premna is stated in Note 32. In this genus, as with Vigna,\r\nthe final test of experiment is needed; but the data at my disposal\r\npoint to the probability that an inland species has here been derived\r\nfrom a littoral plant.\r\n\r\nThe summary of this chapter is given at the end of Chapter XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n            THE RELATION BETWEEN LITTORAL AND INLAND PLANTS\r\n                             (_continued_)\r\n\r\nInland species of a genus developed from littoral species originally\r\n  brought by the currents but no longer existing in the\r\n  group.—Illustrated by the Leguminous genera, Erythrina, Canavalia,\r\n  Mezoneuron, and Sophora, and by the Apocynaceous genus, Ochrosia.—The\r\n  Hawaiian difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION III\r\n\r\nHERE we have three genera of the Leguminosæ, namely, Erythrina,\r\nCanavalia, and Sophora, and one Apocynaceous genus, Ochrosia, in which\r\nit is considered that inland species have been probably developed from\r\nlittoral species no longer found in the group. In this case the shore\r\nspecies, possessing buoyant seeds or fruits that are known to be\r\ndispersed by the currents, is absent from the particular group in which\r\nthe inland species occurs; and since the last-named displays no capacity\r\nfor distribution by currents, or seemingly by birds, we are driven to\r\ninfer that it was originally derived from a coast species, brought by\r\nthe currents, that has since disappeared.\r\n\r\nHawaii is the only region concerned here; and these four genera may be\r\nsaid to well illustrate the particular “Hawaiian difficulty.” If this\r\nexplanation of the origin of the inland species is legitimate, then it\r\noffers us a mode of explaining still more perplexing cases in the\r\nHawaiian flora, such as those relating to the endemic species of\r\nMezoneuron (Leguminosæ) and to Hillebrand’s Vallesia (Apocynaceæ), where\r\nthere is apparently no littoral species known from any region.\r\n\r\nDealing with the three Leguminous genera, it is at first to be remarked\r\nthat the great floating powers of the seeds of the littoral species are\r\nin all three cases to be attributed to the buoyant kernel; whilst on\r\naccount of the non-buoyancy of the kernel the seeds of all the inland\r\nspecies possess no floating power. Some very interesting points are\r\nraised in each of the three genera, and I will first deal with the genus\r\nErythrina.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ERYTHRINA.\r\n\r\nIf we look over the Pacific islands in search of a critical locality for\r\nthe investigation of the genetic relation between the littoral and coast\r\nspecies of Erythrina, we discover it, as far as I can gather, only in\r\none group. In Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa we find only the littoral species;\r\nin Hawaii there is only an inland species; whilst in Tahiti occur both\r\nthe littoral and the inland species—E. indica, the wide-ranging\r\nshore-tree of the South Pacific, and E. monosperma, the inland tree of\r\nHawaii—the last found nowhere else in Polynesia, and confined to the\r\nPacific. In Tahiti there are no other species, and it is between these\r\ntwo species that the connection, if it exists, is to be sought. (Further\r\ndetails relating to the genus are given in Note 53. In this place only\r\nthe facts bearing on the argument will be discussed.)\r\n\r\nThe buoyant seeds of Erythrina indica are well known to be dispersed by\r\nthe currents; whilst those of E. monosperma, as obtained from Hawaii,\r\nhave no floating power and sink at once, or in a day or so, even after\r\ndrying for two years. In Tahiti the first-named species is a\r\ncharacteristic plant of the beach, whilst the last grows there in the\r\nvalleys and on the mountains up to elevations of 700 to 800 metres. We\r\nhave now to inquire whether there is any decided affinity between the\r\ntwo species, and whether the divergent characters of the inland species\r\ncan be connected with its station. With regard to the first query we may\r\nquote in reply the observation of Drake del Castillo, that as concerning\r\nthe foliage and the inflorescence E. monosperma is very nearly related\r\nto E. indica, differing only from it in the more hairy calyx, in the\r\nmore permanently tomentose and much shorter pod, and in the paucity of\r\nseeds (one or two in number).\r\n\r\nWe will now see whether it is possible to connect these differences in\r\ncharacter with differences of station. Neither Nadeaud nor Drake del\r\nCastillo give precise descriptions of the station of Erythrina\r\nmonosperma in Tahiti; but Nadeaud and Lepine remark that it grows on\r\nprecipices as well as in the valleys on the north or dry side of the\r\nisland; and we may infer that it affects exposed dry rocky stations. In\r\nHawaii, according to Hillebrand, it is found on the dry rocky hills and\r\nplains of all the islands up to 1,000 feet. I was particularly\r\ninterested in this tree whilst in the group, and found it in the large\r\nislands of Maui and Hawaii thriving in rocky arid districts of little\r\nrainfall, accompanied by Cactus opuntia, Ricinus communis, and\r\nCæsalpinia bonducella. It is often to be observed on scantily vegetated\r\nlava-flows, a solitary tree growing here and there out of a crack in the\r\nold lava, or it may dot the rocky slopes of some barren declivity. I\r\nfound it in the dry gulches behind Lahaina at elevations of 800 to 1,200\r\nfeet above the sea, growing amongst huge blocks of stone in clumps of\r\nten or twelve trees. When one contrasts the inland station of E.\r\nmonosperma with that of E. indica on the beach where the atmosphere is\r\nmore humid and the conditions more suited for plant-growth, it appears\r\nprobable that the differences between these two species may be largely\r\nconnected with station, especially as regards hairiness and the\r\ndiminished size of the pods.\r\n\r\nAssuming, therefore, that Erythrina monosperma is but the inland form of\r\nE. indica and that the differences between the two species are mainly an\r\naffair of station, we have next to account for the occurrence of the\r\ninland species in Hawaii without the littoral species. The agency of\r\ncurrents in explanation of the existence of E. monosperma in Hawaii is\r\nat once excluded, since the pods dehisce on the tree, and the seeds, as\r\nalready remarked, have no floating power. Nor does it seem likely that\r\nbeans half an inch (13 mm.) long could be transported unharmed in a\r\nbird’s stomach over the two thousand miles of sea that intervene between\r\nTahiti and Hawaii. Yet one cannot doubt that the pyrenes and “stones” of\r\ngenera like Coprosma, Nertera, Cyathodes, and Osteomeles have been\r\ncarried by frugivorous birds to Hawaii. But a bean is somewhat different\r\nfrom the crustaceous pyrene of Coprosma or the hard “stone” of\r\nCyathodes; and although, as indicated by the occurrence of an endemic\r\nspecies of Erythrina in Fernando Noronha, birds may carry large beans\r\nunharmed over a couple of hundred miles of sea, one hesitates to\r\nconclude that they could effect this when the tract of ocean to be\r\ntraversed is ten times as great. There are again reasons for believing\r\nthat the seeds of Erythrina monosperma are particularly ill-suited for\r\ndispersal by birds, since, notwithstanding their hardness, they soon\r\nabsorb water through the micropylar opening; and they germinated so\r\nreadily in my experiments that the digestive juices in a bird’s stomach\r\nwould probably soon find access and destroy the kernel. It is, however,\r\nknown from the observations of the Messrs. Layard in New Caledonia that\r\na small crow and different species of parrots feed on the seeds of\r\nErythrina, and they may aid in the local dispersal (_Ibis_, vol. 6,\r\n1882).\r\n\r\nTo admit man’s agency in carrying to Hawaii the seeds of a tree which is\r\nonly useful in supplying him with light wood for his outriggers and his\r\nfishing-net floats would compel us to place in the same category a great\r\nnumber of plants in some way useful to him which are recognised as\r\nindigenous. The Polynesian ransacks the vegetable world for his wants,\r\nand carries with him in his migrations only his food-plants and the\r\nseeds of his sacred trees.\r\n\r\nThere remains then the possibility that the parent species, Erythrina\r\nindica, was once in Hawaii but has since disappeared. In order to\r\nestablish this, it will be requisite to show not only that the\r\nextinction of a shore-plant is probable, but also to explain why the new\r\nspecies has selected such arid inland localities for its stations, to\r\naccount for the loss of buoyancy of the seeds, and, if possible, to give\r\nan instance of the production of a new species of Erythrina in a small\r\nisolated oceanic island.\r\n\r\nA study of the special circumstances of Hawaii leads one to conclude\r\nthat a shore-tree may become extinct in one of two ways. It may be\r\nexterminated by insect pests, or it may be forced inland through\r\nunsuitable coast-conditions and there be lost in the resulting new\r\nspecies. One characteristic shore-tree, Cordia subcordata, has indeed\r\nbeen almost exterminated by insects, and even Erythrina monosperma is\r\nnow from the same cause on its road to extinction (see Note 53); but\r\nthere is no indication of their leaving modified descendants behind that\r\nare pest-proof. The most probable view then is that the littoral tree,\r\nhaving been driven inland through the unsuitability of the\r\ncoast-conditions, such as lack of beaches or want of moisture, has there\r\nbecome modified. This is what has really happened, as I have shown, with\r\nCæsalpinia bonducella in Hawaii. As indicated in Chapter XVII., this\r\ncharacteristic beach-plant has here been driven off the beach. There\r\nwould thus be no difficulty in assigning a reason why a littoral tree\r\nlike Erythrina indica should select arid localities when it extends\r\ninland, since, as is pointed out in Chapter IV. and in other parts of\r\nthis work, the plants of the beach and of the arid inland district\r\npossess the same xerophilous habit.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the loss of buoyancy of the seeds in the case of\r\nErythrina monosperma, it may be remarked that this is precisely what has\r\nhappened with the seeds of Cæsalpinia bonducella, its usual associate on\r\nthe old lava-wastes in Hawaii, and with an inland species of Cæsalpinia\r\nin Fiji. It is argued that the same thing has occurred with the inland\r\nHawaiian species of Canavalia and Sophora, as shown in later pages of\r\nthis chapter. It has certainly happened with the inland form of Afzelia\r\nbijuga in Fiji, a tree dealt with in Chapter XVII. These are all\r\nLeguminous genera; and in all of them, with the exception of Cæsalpinia,\r\nwhere the floating power arises from a central cavity in the seed, the\r\nseeds of the littoral species possess, like Erythrina indica, buoyant\r\nkernels. Whilst most littoral plants with buoyant seeds or fruits retain\r\nthe floating capacity of the seed or fruit when they extend inland, the\r\nLeguminosæ often offer exceptions to the rule.\r\n\r\nThat inland endemic species of Erythrina can be developed in isolated\r\nislands is illustrated by the existence in Fernando Noronha, some two\r\nhundred miles from the coast of Brazil, of a peculiar species, E.\r\naurantiaca, described by Mr. Ridley. Here also is found an inland\r\nspecies of Guettarda peculiar to the locality; but in neither genus does\r\nthe littoral species occur.\r\n\r\nMany difficulties will yet have to be explained before it can be finally\r\nestablished that Erythrina monosperma has been derived from E. indica or\r\nsome similar shore species that was originally dispersed by the\r\ncurrents; but we are almost driven towards such a view, since it is hard\r\nto believe that the beans were carried to Hawaii by birds over some two\r\nthousand miles of sea. Observers in other regions where littoral and\r\ninland species of the genus occur may perhaps devote their attention to\r\nthe relation between the two; and if they are able to supplement\r\nobservation and experiment by a microscopical investigation, some\r\ninteresting results would be obtained. For instance, I would suggest\r\nthat in Queensland a thorough examination of the littoral E. indica and\r\nthe inland E. vespertilio might be undertaken; or perhaps there may be\r\nsome other littoral form.\r\n\r\nWith the two other Leguminous genera, Canavalia and Sophora, to be\r\nimmediately discussed, we have for the most part the same questions\r\nraised. Both possess wide-ranging current-dispersed littoral species in\r\nother parts of the Pacific, but only endemic inland species with\r\nnon-buoyant seeds in Hawaii. The pivot of the discussion will be here\r\nalso the impracticability of these inland species ever having reached\r\nthe Hawaiian Islands through the agency of the currents, and the great\r\ndifficulty in believing that their beans were carried unharmed by birds\r\nover half the breadth of the Pacific Ocean. If we reject alike the\r\ncurrent, the bird, and the parentage of a lost littoral species, we must\r\nfall back on the continental hypothesis, against which in the case of\r\nHawaii the evidence is overwhelming.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CANAVALIA.\r\n\r\nThis genus is represented in the tropical islands of the South Pacific\r\nfrom Fiji to Tahiti by three littoral species, none of which have been\r\nfound in Hawaii, where only an endemic inland species exists. Reference\r\nwill alone be made here to such facts as bear on the probable history of\r\nthe mysterious Hawaiian species, additional particulars being given in\r\nNote 54. The littoral species, Canavalia obtusifolia (D.C.), C. sericea\r\n(Gray), and C. ensiformis (D.C.), have buoyant seeds and are dispersed\r\nby the currents; whilst the inland Hawaiian species, C. galeata (Gaud.),\r\na forest climber peculiar to that group, has non-buoyant seeds. We thus\r\nhave repeated the problem of Erythrina monosperma. The absence of the\r\nlittoral species from Hawaii can scarcely be attributed to the failure\r\nof the currents, since Ipomœa pes capræ, which accompanies C.\r\nobtusifolia as a beach-creeper all round the tropical globe, is present\r\non the Hawaiian beaches. Nor can it arise from lack of floating-power on\r\nthe part of the seeds, since experiment indicates that the seeds of C.\r\nobtusifolia will float for months unharmed in sea-water. Nor can it be\r\nascribed to climatic conditions, since this tropical shore species\r\nextends into cooler latitudes than those of the Hawaiian Islands, being\r\nfound in the Kermadec Group and in the Bermudas, which are subtropical\r\nboth in position and as regards much of their vegetation. The reason\r\nperhaps we may never learn from the plants themselves, though it may be\r\npossible to obtain some light on the problem from outside sources.\r\n\r\nCanavalia galeata differs much in its habits, as well as in some of its\r\ncharacters, from the existing littoral species of regions outside the\r\nHawaiian Group. It is a stout climber ascending the forest trees to a\r\nconsiderable height, though, as is indicated in Note 54, the shore\r\nspecies sometimes display a tendency in the same direction. It is\r\ndescribed by Hillebrand as occurring “on all islands, in forests up to\r\n2,000 feet.” Like those of the inland species of Erythrina (E.\r\nmonosperma), its seeds sink in sea-water even after being kept for four\r\nyears, nor could the pods be utilised for dispersal by the currents,\r\nsince they float, when unopened, only for four or five days. Here also,\r\nas with Erythrina, the seeds of the inland species no longer possess the\r\nbuoyant kernels to which the floating capacity of the seeds of the coast\r\nspecies is due. Though we have to exclude the currents, we can scarcely\r\nin its case appeal to bird-agency when we wish to account for the\r\ntransportal of the original seeds to Hawaii, as that would imply that\r\nbirds can carry beans nearly an inch, or 2 to 2.5 centimetres, in length\r\nunharmed in their stomachs over a tract of ocean some 1,500 or 2,000\r\nmiles across. We should have to learn much that is unexpected of the\r\nmodes of dispersal of the Leguminosæ before we could accept such an\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\nCanavalia galeata indeed presents to the student of dispersal one of the\r\nenigmas of the Hawaiian flora; and it should be noted that the mystery\r\nof its distribution is concerned not only with the means of transportal\r\nof the seeds of the original species to the group, but also with its\r\npresent dispersal among the islands. It is, however, suggestive that Dr.\r\nHillebrand mentions two varieties, one of them found on Kauai, with\r\nsomewhat smaller seeds; so that some inter-island differentiation is\r\nevidently in progress. No attempt is made here to connect this inland\r\nspecies directly with the absent beach-plants. That is a matter for the\r\nsystematist; but we are not tied down to existing shore-plants in\r\nfinding an ancestor, since the common parent of the littoral and inland\r\nspecies may have been a shore-plant dispersed by the currents.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              MEZONEURON.\r\n\r\nAnother closely parallel instance, offering, from the standpoint of\r\ndispersal, the same difficulties presented by Canavalia galeata, is to\r\nbe found in Mezoneuron kauaiensis (Hillebr.), a tall inland shrub also\r\npeculiar to the group and belonging alike to the Leguminosæ. The\r\ndifficulties are so nearly identical that the same explanation will have\r\nto cover both; but it is significant that with Mezoneuron there is no\r\nlittoral species to which we can appeal to extricate us from the\r\ndifficulty. Yet the genus is related to Cæsalpinia, and the species was\r\nfirst described by Mann as C. kauaiensis, so that it may have once\r\npossessed a littoral species that has ceased to exist as such. When we\r\ncome to discuss Cæsalpinia and Afzelia (Chapter XVII.) we shall obtain\r\nfrom those genera many suggestions as to the probable past of Canavalia\r\ngaleata and Mezoneuron kauaiensis, two of the greatest riddles presented\r\nby the Leguminosæ of Hawaii.\r\n\r\nThe flat seeds of this species of Mezoneuron measure about an inch (2·5\r\ncm.), and seem most unsuitable for dispersal by birds over a wide extent\r\nof ocean. Nor can we appeal to the currents, since my experiments in\r\nHawaii show that the seeds have no buoyancy and that the pods only float\r\nfor a week in sea-water. Dr. Hillebrand records this shrub from Kauai,\r\nOahu, and Maui; I found it also on the lower slopes of Hualalai in\r\nHawaii and therefore the same question of inter-island dispersal here\r\npresents itself that was connected with Canavalia galeata, since we have\r\nalso to explain the transport of the seeds between islands 70 to 150\r\nmiles apart. The critical point in the history of these two enigmatic\r\ninland plants of the Hawaiian Islands was doubtless concerned with the\r\nloss of buoyancy of the seeds of the original littoral plant. It will\r\nsubsequently be shown that this is what is now in actual operation with\r\nCæsalpinia and Afzelia in different parts of the Pacific.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                SOPHORA.\r\n\r\nIn this genus, as in Erythrina and Canavalia, we have a littoral\r\nspecies, Sophora tomentosa, that ranges over the tropical beaches of the\r\nglobe, including most of the islands of the Pacific, but does not occur\r\nin Hawaii, where the genus is represented by an endemic inland species,\r\nS. chrysophylla. Here also we find the shore-species with seeds capable\r\nof floating for months on account of their buoyant kernels, and the\r\ninland species with seeds that sink even after years of drying (see Note\r\n56). Unless other inland species of Sophora have recently been described\r\nfrom the tropical Pacific, the Hawaiian species is the only one of its\r\nkind known from this region.\r\n\r\nBut the problem wears a different aspect in the case of this genus,\r\nsince the endemic inland species of Hawaii is a tree of the mountains\r\nwhere a temperate climate prevails, whilst Sophora tomentosa is a shrub\r\nof the tropical beach that only at times extends into subtropical\r\nlatitudes. The Mamani tree, as the Hawaiians name S. chrysophylla,\r\nextends up to 9,000 or 10,000 feet above the sea, forming, with Myoporum\r\nsandwicense and one or two other trees and shrubs, the highest belt of\r\nthe forest in the larger islands. It is in the open woodland between\r\n6,000 and 7,000 feet that it is most at home, and here it attains a\r\nheight of 20 to 30 feet. It descends in places to as low as 2,000 feet\r\nabove sea-level; but here is living under uncongenial conditions, and,\r\nlike Myoporum sandwicense, becomes dwarfed and shrubby. The climatic\r\nconditions under which S. chrysophylla thrives in the Hawaiian mountains\r\nare therefore those of the temperate zone. From the data given in\r\nChapter XIX., the mean annual temperature at an elevation of 6,000 to\r\n7,000 feet would probably be about 55°, the average temperature of New\r\nZealand.\r\n\r\nWe must therefore look to the temperate and not to the tropical zone for\r\nthe home of the parent species of Sophora chrysophylla; and if it was\r\noriginally derived from a shore-plant dispersed by the currents, the\r\nwidespread S. tomentosa could scarcely have been the species concerned.\r\nBut this strand-plant is disqualified for another potent reason, since\r\nit belongs to a different section of the genus. Whilst S. tomentosa\r\nbelongs to the section possessing smooth pods, S. chrysophylla is\r\nreferred to the section Edwardsia having four-winged pods, which\r\ncomprises about ten species found in Chile and Peru, Hawaii, New\r\nZealand, Further India, and the Isle of Bourbon. What strange principle\r\nin distribution, we may fitly ask, has linked together in this odd\r\nfashion the continents of the Old and New World and the islands of the\r\nIndian and Pacific oceans?\r\n\r\nYet, discredited as Sophora tomentosa is as a possible parent of the\r\nHawaiian mountain species, it may yet afford us a clue. It is\r\nsignificant that the distribution of this wide-ranging beach-shrub in\r\nthe tropics of the southern hemisphere is almost coterminous with that\r\nof Sophora tetraptera, a species widely spread in the south temperate\r\nzone from Chile to New Zealand and extending towards the tropics as far\r\nas Juan Fernandez in lat. 33° S. and to Easter Island in lat. 27° S.\r\nThough not strictly a beach-plant, S. tetraptera is a plant of the\r\nsea-border; and it is remarkable, but not surprising, how in New\r\nZealand, one of its principal homes, its behaviour in respect of its\r\nvertical distribution presents a great contrast to that of S.\r\nchrysophylla in the tropical latitudes of Hawaii. We have seen that, in\r\nHawaii, S. chrysophylla, which thrives as a tree 20 to 30 feet high in\r\nthe mountains, becomes shrubby when it descends to the lower levels. In\r\nNew Zealand, S. tetraptera is, as we learn from Kirk, a prostrate shrub\r\nin the mountains, whilst in the lower elevations towards the sea it\r\nbecomes a tree 30 and even 50 feet in height. It can scarcely be doubted\r\nthat, if we exchanged the habitats of these Hawaiian and New Zealand\r\nspecies, each would to a great extent take up the other’s station and\r\nthe other’s habit.\r\n\r\nThe whole problem of the dispersal of Sophora was brought immediately to\r\nmy notice at Corral, in latitude 40° S. on the coast of Chile. Here a\r\nsmall tree of the section Edwardsia was growing in fruit on the lower\r\nslopes of the hills, becoming bushy when descending to the beach.\r\nSpecimens of its four-winged pods have been identified at the Kew Museum\r\nas those of Sophora tetraptera; and, as far as the pod is concerned, I\r\ncannot distinguish between my specimens of the Hawaiian S. chrysophylla\r\nand the Chilian species. Subsequently I found the buoyant seeds of the\r\nsame plant amongst the stranded beach-drift at Bahia San Vincente,\r\nnearly 200 miles further north. This led to my experimenting on the\r\ncapacity of the plant for dispersal by the currents, and as a result it\r\nwas ascertained (see Note 56) that whilst, as in the case of S.\r\nchrysophylla, the pods floated only one or two weeks, the seeds on\r\naccount of their buoyant kernels floated for several months in\r\nsea-water, retaining their power of germination. The Chilian plant thus\r\ndiffers significantly in its capacity for dispersal by currents from the\r\nHawaiian species, the seeds of which sink in sea-water even after years\r\nof drying.\r\n\r\nThe Mamani tree in Hawaii had always been an object of great interest to\r\nme. I was attracted by the mystery surrounding its origin and had long\r\nsuspected that the clue was to be found in the non-buoyancy of its seeds\r\nand in the absence of a littoral species of the genus. When in Fiji it\r\nwas to the littoral Sophora tomentosa that I looked in vain for a\r\nsolution of the riddle, and seven years afterwards on the coast of Chile\r\na solution of this enigma of the Hawaiian mountains presented itself in\r\nthe form of an argument somewhat in this shape.\r\n\r\nOn account of the elevated station of the Mamani tree (S. chrysophylla)\r\nin Hawaii it is to be inferred that the original species was a plant of\r\nthe temperate regions or of the uplands of some tropical mountains. If\r\nit has had its origin in some shore-plant dispersed by the currents,\r\nthat species can only now be found on the coasts of extra-tropical\r\nregions. Such a maritime plant had buoyant seeds; and plants of this\r\ntype are presented by Sophora tetraptera and its allied species that are\r\nat home in the cool latitudes of the southern hemisphere, as in Chile\r\nand New Zealand. No difficulty, as I argued, could be connected with the\r\nloss of buoyancy of the seeds of the Hawaiian mountain species, since it\r\nfollows the general principle (laid down in Chapter II.) that in the\r\nsame genus coast species have buoyant seeds or fruits, and inland\r\nspecies those that sink; and in support of this view it was recalled\r\nthat this is what happens to the seeds of Cæsalpinia bonducella and\r\nAfzelia bijuga when the plants extend inland in the Pacific islands. It\r\nwas held, in short, that the original form of Sophora chrysophylla in\r\nHawaii was a coast plant with buoyant seeds, and therefore indebted for\r\nits presence to the currents. Hailing from an extra-tropical region, it\r\nabandoned the beach and found suitable conditions of existence in the\r\nmountains, where it underwent specific differentiation. Such was the\r\nexplanation that presented itself to me on a Chilian beach.\r\n\r\nThe first objection that offers itself against this view is that Sophora\r\nchrysophylla is one of several species characterising the antarctic\r\nelement of the mountain flora of Hawaii, and that many of these plants,\r\nsuch as those of the genera Astelia, Coprosma, Gunnera, Myoporum, &c.,\r\ncould only have reached these islands through the agency of frugivorous\r\nbirds (see Chapter XXIII.). There is, therefore, something to be said\r\nfor this mode of dispersal; but though one can understand how hard seeds\r\nand the “stones” and crustaceous pyrenes of fleshy fruits might be\r\ntransported unharmed in a bird’s stomach half-way across the Pacific\r\nOcean to the distant group of Hawaii, it is difficult to understand how\r\nLeguminous seeds, except in such cases as Tephrosia piscatoria, could be\r\nejected unharmed by a bird after an ocean passage of some 1,500 or 2,000\r\nmiles. Yet evidence pointing to such a possibility is not lacking. It\r\nwas pointed out by W. O. Focke (_Nat. schaft. Ver. zur Bremen_,\r\nAbhandl., Band 5, 1876) that for many Leguminosæ we are driven to the\r\nagency of birds in order to explain their dispersal. In this connection\r\nhe mentions the case of a pigeon killed by some beast of prey that he\r\nfound in his garden in the early winter. In the following spring he\r\nnoticed numerous seedlings of Vicia faba sprouting up from amongst the\r\nfeathers that alone remained of the bird. In this observation he\r\ndetected the normal method of the dispersal of the Leguminosæ by birds,\r\nthe seeds not being ejected by the bird but being set free by its death.\r\nIt is well known that Darwin had this idea in his mind when he conducted\r\nhis experiments on the dispersal of seeds; and reference may here be\r\nmade to one that is recorded in _More Letters of Charles Darwin_ (i.,\r\n436). Out of a number of seeds left in the stomach of an eagle for\r\neighteen hours, the majority were killed; but amongst the few that\r\ngerminated afterwards was a seed of clover (Trifolium). If such a bird\r\nhad carried a Sophora seed to Hawaii, this would have involved a\r\ncontinuous flight of, on the average, 100 miles per hour for a period of\r\nfifteen to twenty hours. This would just come within the limitations\r\nlaid down by Gätke as regards length and velocity of flight—a subject\r\ndiscussed in Chapter XXXIII.\r\n\r\nWe will now turn to the Sophora seeds themselves for evidence of their\r\ncapacity of surviving the perils of such a journey. The seeds of Sophora\r\nchrysophylla, which are about a quarter of an inch (6 to 7 mm.) in\r\nlength, possess unusually hard coverings for the order, and in that\r\nrespect appear fitted for dispersal by animals. Indeed, in the large\r\nisland of Hawaii wild pigs and sheep feed on the pods, and no doubt aid\r\nin the distribution of the plant over the island through the germination\r\nof ejected undigested seeds. But since the species is found on most of\r\nthe larger islands, it is apparent that to birds we must look for the\r\nexplanation of its inter-island dispersal. Mr. Wilson, in his _Aves\r\nHawaienses_, remarks that one of the Hawaiian finches (Loxioides) feeds\r\non the seeds of this tree, which probably, he adds, also serve as the\r\nfood of Chloridops kona, another big finch; and it is to be inferred\r\nfrom the observations of Mr. Perkins, quoted by Mr. Evans in his book on\r\nBirds, that the Drepanididæ, a family peculiar to Hawaii, are in the\r\nhabit of splitting the pods of trees like Acacia koa and Sophora\r\nchrysophylla to obtain the seeds. It would, however, seem that the\r\nagency of birds confined to these islands does not carry us very far\r\nwhen we wish to explain the original transport of the seeds over a\r\nbreadth of ocean of some 1,500 miles and more. Yet we know that this\r\nmust have happened with some of the Hawaiian plants, such as Osteomeles\r\nanthyllidifolia and Nertera depressa, that are not confined to these\r\nislands and possess fruits that would attract frugivorous birds. But\r\nwhether it has occurred with the dry beans of the Hawaiian species of\r\nSophora is another matter.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I am inclined to the view, bearing in mind the general\r\nindications of the Leguminosæ in the Pacific, that S. chrysophylla\r\noriginally reached Hawaii as a littoral plant through the agency of the\r\ncurrents. Many points still need investigation; but it may be pointed\r\nout that South America probably received Sophora tetraptera from New\r\nZealand by the West Wind Drift Current.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          OCHROSIA (Apocyneæ).\r\n\r\nThis genus seems to offer the strongest testimony in support of the\r\nderivation of an inland species from a strand-plant. The drupes are so\r\nlarge, the minimum size of the “stone” being 1-1/2 or 2 inches (37 to 50\r\nmm.), and so dry and unattractive for birds, that any other agency but\r\nthat of the currents appears to be out of the question. Indeed their dry\r\nappearance would suggest to my readers that only birds of the habits of\r\nthe ostrich would venture on such a diet. It is, however, worth noting\r\nthat whilst in the Keeling Islands I learned that a cassowary that had\r\nbeen kept on the atoll was a very efficient distributor of the seeds of\r\nOchrosia parviflora, scattering the undigested stones everywhere, and\r\ncausing the young trees to become so numerous that they had to be\r\ndestroyed. A similar habit of the cassowary in the Aru Islands is\r\nrecorded by Beccari, where the dry fruits of a palm, 2-1/2 inches\r\nacross, are swallowed by these birds and the seeds dispersed.\r\nCassowaries are active agents in dissemination, for they swallow every\r\nkind of pulpy fruit, and convey them long distances undigested; they are\r\nalso excellent swimmers and traverse considerable expanses of water\r\n(Beccari, quoted in _Chall. Bot._, iv., 297, 313).\r\n\r\nModern ornithologists would probably not object to our appealing to the\r\nformer volant habits of the cassowary and its allies even across a wide\r\ntract of sea; but, excepting in New Zealand and its vicinity, such birds\r\nare not at our disposal in the island groups of the open Pacific. There\r\nis a possibility that the extinct Columbæ and other exterminated birds\r\nof the Mascarene Islands might account for some anomalies in their\r\nfloras; and in Chapter XVI. reference is made to the fact that these\r\nislands possess more endemic species of Pandanus than any other oceanic\r\ngroups, a genus possessing drupes that in the case of inland species\r\nseem unfit for any mode of dispersal with which we are familiar. In the\r\nislands of the tropical Pacific, however, it is not possible to find\r\nsuch a way out of the difficulty, since, as shown in Chapter XXXIII.,\r\nthe birds are lacking.\r\n\r\nThe genus, according to the _Index Kewensis_, includes about ten species\r\ndistributed over the islands of the Indian Ocean, and found also in\r\nMalaya, Australia, and throughout the Pacific. It is essentially an\r\ninsular genus, and two at least of the species are wide-ranging littoral\r\ntrees, one, Ochrosia borbonica, mainly distributed over the islands of\r\nthe Indian Ocean and of Malaya, and the other, O. parviflora, chiefly of\r\nthe islands of the Pacific. It will be out of place to deal here in any\r\ndetail with this interesting genus, and my remarks will be confined to\r\nsuch matters as concern the origin of the inland species of the Hawaiian\r\nIslands, species that are peculiar to that group. Some confusion has\r\nprevailed amongst different authors in the determination of the limits\r\nof the various species, and to avoid this I have mainly followed\r\nSchumann in his monograph on the order (Engler’s _Naturl. Pflanz. Fam._,\r\nTheil 4, Abth. 2, 1895), as indicated in Note 57.\r\n\r\nBesides the littoral species Ochrosia parviflora, Hensl., that ranges\r\nover most of the archipelagoes of the Pacific from the Solomon Islands\r\nto Tahiti, but is not found in Hawaii, we have in the Pacific, O.\r\nelliptica, Lab., of New Caledonia and Fiji; another species of New\r\nGuinea and the Ladrones; and one or two inland species of Hawaii.\r\nOchrosia parviflora was familiar to me on Keeling Atoll, in the coral\r\nislets of the Solomon Group, and on the islets and coasts of certain\r\nparts of Fiji. Its fruits, which are dispersed by the currents, were\r\nfound amongst the stranded drift of the Keeling and Fijian beaches.\r\nAlthough usually a coast-tree in Fiji, it came under my notice in one\r\nlocality growing inland; and it is a very suggestive circumstance in\r\nconnection with the inland species of Hawaii, that in Tahiti this tree\r\nis only described by the French botanists as growing in the mountains at\r\nelevations of 700 to 800 metres above the sea, it having for some reason\r\nabandoned the beach. The process which we thus see in operation in\r\nTahiti is completed in Hawaii, and we there find a peculiar inland\r\nspecies far away in the interior of the islands which is placed by\r\nSchumann in the same section of the genus with the littoral O.\r\nparviflora, that is not, however, found in the group. It may be remarked\r\nthat Gray describes only one species from Hawaii, O. sandwicensis, but\r\nSchumann makes two species of it—one, O. compta, Sch., peculiar to the\r\ngroup and referred to the same section as O. parviflora; the other, the\r\noriginal species of Gray, which he considers as probably a variety of O.\r\nborbonica. These determinations of the German botanist, who had no\r\ntheory to serve, are especially interesting. It is with the littoral\r\ntrees now missing from the Hawaiian beaches that he compares the inland\r\nspecies of the group, trees now chiefly characteristic the one of the\r\nIndian Ocean and the other of the South Pacific; and we can scarcely\r\ndoubt that originally one littoral tree ranged over both oceans.\r\n\r\nHillebrand describes Ochrosia sandwicensis of Gray as a shrub or small\r\ntree, 6 to 12 feet in height, growing in the open woods of the lower and\r\nmiddle regions on all the islands. Its dry ellipsoid fruit is two inches\r\n(5 cm.) long, and possesses a thin suberose covering on one side and a\r\nvery thick woody endocarp, one-quarter to one-third of an inch (6 to 8\r\nmm.) in depth. The other species which he characterises as a variety is\r\nnot so generally distributed in the group. We have to explain not only\r\nhow the original species reached the group, but also how they have been\r\ndistributed over the islands. The currents could scarcely have\r\ntransported the fruits as we now see them. Those of O. sandwicensis have\r\nonly a trace of a buoyant covering, and, judging from some fruits that I\r\nexamined, they could possess little or no floating power. Even the most\r\nenthusiastic advocate of dispersal by birds must pause here; and there\r\nremains the view, supported by evidence of a striking character, that\r\nthe inland Hawaiian species are derived from littoral species that,\r\nhaving been originally brought by the currents, like O. parviflora in\r\nFiji, abandoned the beach and took to the mountains, where they have\r\nbecome differentiated.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the lesson of Ochrosia in Hawaii can be applied to\r\none or two of the other Hawaiian “difficulties,” and that plants that\r\nnow set at defiance all the attempts of the student of dispersal to\r\nexplain their occurrence in this group may have commenced their\r\nexistence in these islands as littoral species brought originally by the\r\ncurrents and afterwards driven off the beach. One of the greatest\r\nenigmas of the Hawaiian flora is connected with another small\r\nApocynaceous tree peculiar to the group and described by Hillebrand as\r\nVallesia macrocarpa and by other Hawaiian botanists as a species of\r\nOchrosia. Schumann, however, places it in a new genus, Pteralyxia, near\r\nto Alyxia, a genus already in the islands. However this may be, its dry\r\ndrupaceous fruits two inches (5 cm.) in length, and its pyrenes almost\r\nas long, could never have been transported as such by the birds of our\r\nown time; and if they could have been carried in the stomach of a bird\r\ngiven to the dietetic humours of the cassowary, such birds in their\r\ntrans-oceanic passages would have left some trace behind in the groups\r\nof the mid-Pacific. In our perplexity we read again the lesson of\r\nOchrosia.\r\n\r\n\r\n            _Summary of Chapter_ (see end of Chapter XVI.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n            THE RELATION BETWEEN LITTORAL AND INLAND PLANTS\r\n                             (_continued_)\r\n\r\nThe Fijian difficulty.—Inland species of a genus possessing\r\n  fruits not known to have any means of dispersal through\r\n  agencies now at work in the Pacific.—Pandanus.—Its remarkable\r\n  distribution in oceanic groups.—To be attributed perhaps\r\n  to extinct Columbæ or extinct Struthious\r\n  birds.—Barringtonia.—Guettarda.—Eugenia.—Drymispermum.—Acacia\r\n  laurifolia.—Conclusions to be drawn from the discussion.—Summary of\r\n  chapters XIV, XV, XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SECTION IV\r\n\r\nHERE we deal with two genera, Pandanus and Barringtonia, where inland\r\nendemic species occur in the same group with the wide-ranging coast\r\nspecies, but possess fruits concerning which it is either difficult or\r\nalmost impossible to suggest a mode of dispersal by existing agencies.\r\nThis section is especially concerned with Fiji, and represents the\r\npeculiar “Fijian difficulty” that is illustrated by other genera as—for\r\ninstance, the Coniferous genus Dammara—which are not in any sense\r\nlittoral. Further investigation is, however, requisite in the case of\r\nBarringtonia, and to a less degree with Pandanus; and I can only here\r\npoint to the general indications of the data at my disposal. We have in\r\nthese genera to assume either that the inland species are derived from\r\nthe coast species, or that the seeds were brought by one of the extinct\r\nbirds of the Western Pacific, by a megapode or by one of the Columbæ, or\r\nby some Struthious bird like the moa or the cassowary, or, if these two\r\nassumptions fail, that there has been a continental connection through\r\nthe islands to the westward with the mainland beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PANDANUS.\r\n\r\nI take this genus first because the recent monograph on the Pandanaceæ\r\nby Dr. Warburg (Engler’s _Das Pflanzenreich_, 1900) enables me to tread\r\non relatively safe ground in making my deductions. The three genera of\r\nthe order, Freycinetia, Pandanus, and Sararanga, each tell their own\r\nstory; and in each and all of them I have taken an especial interest\r\nfrom the standpoint of their dispersal. Freycinetia is fully discussed\r\nin Chapter XXV., and presents no difficulties respecting its dispersal.\r\nIn the discovery of Sararanga the author has had a share. It was first\r\nestablished by Mr. Hemsley from specimens sent by me to Kew in 1885; and\r\nit has received from the botanist the name given to it by the natives of\r\nthe islands of Bougainville Straits in the Solomon Group, where I first\r\ncollected it. It contains only one species and was also discovered by\r\nDr. Beccari, the celebrated Italian botanist, in Jobie Island, New\r\nGuinea. From the other two genera of the order, Pandanus and\r\nFreycinetia, it stands quite apart; and it apparently presents us with a\r\nrelic of some ancient flora on the western borders of the Pacific. Its\r\nfleshy drupes (one-half to three-quarters of an inch in size) inclosing\r\nseveral small osseous pyrenes seem suited for dispersal by birds; and it\r\nis not at first sight easy to understand why its distribution should be\r\nso limited, unless this is connected with its diœcious habit (see\r\nGuppy’s _Solomon Islands_, p. 302; _Journ. Linn. Soc. Bot._ vol. xxx.;\r\nand Warburg’s monograph).\r\n\r\nIt is, however, with the genus Pandanus that we are here especially\r\nconcerned. If the advocate of the previous continental connections of\r\nFiji and the groups around were to look for evidence in support of his\r\nviews, he apparently could not do better than take this genus. Whilst P.\r\nodoratissimus, the littoral species of tropical Asia and Malaya, is\r\nfound on the coasts of almost all the Pacific islands from Fiji to\r\nTahiti and northward to Hawaii, it is only in the archipelagoes of the\r\nWestern Pacific, namely, in Fiji and Samoa, that inland endemic species\r\nhave been found. (Such species occur also in the more western islands\r\nnot dealt with here—New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, &c.) Not even in\r\nHawaii, with all its botanical evidence of antiquity, has an inland\r\nendemic species been found, although the coast species extends miles\r\ninland, and for nearly 2,000 feet up the mountain slopes. When, however,\r\nwe turn to Fiji and Samoa, we find in each group two endemic inland\r\nspecies. To endeavour to connect the inland species of Fiji and Samoa\r\nwith the widespread littoral Pandanus odoratissimus, that owes its\r\ndispersal largely to the currents, is out of the question, at least for\r\nthe student of plant-dispersal, since they belong to different sections\r\nof the genus, and in their characters are often far removed (see Note\r\n58).\r\n\r\nAs regards the agency of birds, it is of course possible that\r\nfruit-pigeons that can disperse the “stones” of Canarium and Elæocarpus\r\ncould transport the smaller drupes of Pandanus to oceanic islands like\r\nthe Fijis, Samoa, and the Mascarene Islands; and in Note 58 reference is\r\nmade to the size of the drupes of the endemic species of Pandanus in\r\nthose groups. But my difficulty is that I have not come upon any record\r\nof birds eating these fruits; and I should imagine that amongst living\r\nbirds only those like the cassowary and its kin would prefer such a kind\r\nof diet; whilst the only pigeon that could have ever attempted it must\r\nhave been able to swallow pebbles like the dodo. It is remarkable that\r\nthe Mascarene Islands, the home of the extinct Columbæ, possess more\r\nendemic species of Pandanus than any other groups.\r\n\r\nDr. Warburg points out that, with the exception of some three or four\r\nspecies dispersed by the currents (P. dubius, P. leram, P. polycephalus,\r\nP. odoratissimus), almost all the species (156 in number) are very\r\nrestricted in their areas. When we look at his table of the distribution\r\nof the genus we notice that, excepting the islands of the Hawaiian and\r\nTahitian regions, nearly all the elevated or mountainous islands of the\r\ntropical and subtropical latitudes of the Indian and Pacific oceans have\r\ntheir peculiar species, whether in the case of Mauritius, Rodriguez,\r\nRéunion, and the Seychelles in the one ocean, or of Lord Howe Island,\r\nNew Caledonia, Fiji, and Samoa in the other. The student here hesitates\r\neven to raise the question of present plant-dispersal in the face of\r\nsuch evidence of isolation all over the area of the genus. He is almost\r\ninclined to evade the issue and to place the matter beside that of the\r\ndying or extinct Columbæ that have been found in some of these islands,\r\nas in Mauritius, Rodriguez, Réunion, and Samoa.\r\n\r\nFor reasons above given in the instance of Fiji and Samoa, it would seem\r\nfutile to attempt to connect in their origin the inland with the coast\r\nspecies; and it may be inferred that, excepting the few dispersed by the\r\ncurrents, the species are in the main inland in their stations. Those\r\npeculiar to Fiji, for instance, occur in the swampy forests of the lower\r\nregions of the interior, as well as high up towards the mountain\r\nsummits. When traversing the Fijian forests I often used to speculate on\r\nthe modes of dispersal of the plants familiar to me; but the sight of a\r\nstrange Pandanus usually brought my speculations to a close. Many of the\r\nenigmas of insular floras would be solved if we could interpret aright\r\nthe 156 species of Pandanus that are enumerated and described by Dr.\r\nWarburg in his monograph. Observers like myself obtain little peeps into\r\nthe conditions of existence of these interesting plants; and the\r\ntravelled botanist, who becomes a systematist in his later years,\r\nattains to a far more extensive view, yet even he can only penetrate the\r\nmystery for a little way.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether Pandanus odoratissimus, the shore-tree of the\r\ntropical beaches of the islands of the Pacific and Indian oceans, of\r\nAustralia, Malaya, and Southern Asia, can aid us much in any one\r\nlocality, since its distribution has no doubt been often assisted by\r\nman. Yet it is probable that the currents have played a predominant part\r\nin its dispersal. Its fruits occur commonly in beach-drift, both in the\r\nIndian and Pacific oceans, and are often incrusted with serpulæ,\r\npolyzoa, and cirripedes. At certain seasons the currents bring them to\r\nKeeling Atoll in abundance. When, however, we come to inquire why it is\r\nthat this beach species is the only representative of the genus in\r\nHawaii and Tahiti, we are met with the possibility of its having been\r\nintroduced by the aborigines. The tree is almost as useful to a\r\nPolynesian as the coco-nut palm, and it has been cultivated by him in\r\nsome of the atoll-groups, as in the Marshall and in the Radack\r\narchipelagoes. In Chapter VII. good reasons are advanced for regarding\r\nit as an aboriginal introduction into Hawaii. When, therefore, we learn\r\nthat in the group just named it extends from the sea-coast to nearly\r\n2,000 feet above the sea, that in Samoa it may at times be found at a\r\nsimilar elevation though usually restricted to the sea-border, and that\r\nin the same way in Tahiti and in Fiji it may leave the coast-region and\r\nextend into the heart of the islands, we are not inclined to look for\r\nany marked differentiation in its character. This indeed appears to be\r\nthe case. Numerous varieties in different regions are referred to by Dr.\r\nWarburg; but the only important one in the Pacific islands here\r\nmentioned is a cultivated form from the Marshall Group. A variety from\r\nHawaii is distinguished chiefly by the smaller size of its drupes.\r\n\r\nAssuming, therefore, that the inland species are as a rule not derived\r\nfrom littoral species originally brought by the currents, and that no\r\nbirds of our own time are in the habit of carrying the drupes of\r\nPandanus to oceanic islands, in order to explain the distribution of\r\nsuch species we have to choose between the possibility of the agency of\r\nextinct Columbæ and birds similar in their habits and the alternative of\r\na continental connection. Dr. Warburg, who says but little of the mode\r\nof dispersal of Pandanus drupes, regards the genus as having now two\r\ncentres, one in the East African islands (Madagascar, the Mascarenes,\r\nand the Seychelles), and the other in Papuasia (New Guinea, extending\r\ndoubtless to New Caledonia). My readers will recall to their minds that\r\nzoologists have at times felt bound to postulate a continent in both the\r\ncentres of the genus Pandanus. There is the well-known Lemuria of the\r\nIndian Ocean, and then we have in the Western Pacific Forbes’ Antipodea\r\nand Hedley’s Melanesian Plateau.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, we accept the indications of the distribution of\r\nPandanus as favouring a continental hypothesis for either area it is\r\nessential to exclude the agency of the extinct Aves. In this connection\r\nit is of prime importance to notice that the Mascarene Islands are\r\nremarkable, when contrasted with all other oceanic islands, not only for\r\nthe predominance of peculiar species of Pandanus, but also as having\r\nbeen the home of extinct Columbæ like the dodo and the solitaire. The\r\ndodo’s habit of swallowing pebbles of the size of a nutmeg\r\n(_Encyclopædia Britannica_, vii., 322), and the solitaire’s inclination\r\nfor swallowing stones as large as a hen’s egg (_Birds_, by A. H. Evans,\r\np. 331), doubtless represent, as explained below, a capacity for the\r\ndispersal of large fruits and seeds that would be regarded as\r\n“impossible” for distribution by birds now. It is quite possible that at\r\nsome time the ancestors of these birds possessed the powers of flight\r\nnow owned by the Nicobar pigeon, in the gizzard of which, in the Solomon\r\nIslands, I found quartz pebbles half an inch across (_Solomon Islands_,\r\np. 324). In the work just quoted I refer on page 325 to the observation\r\nof Messrs. Chalmers and Gill that the Goura pigeon of New Guinea usually\r\ncarries a good-sized pebble in its gizzard. We do not, however, seem to\r\npossess any record of extinct Columbæ in the tropical islands of the\r\nWestern Pacific. The nearly extinct Didunculus of Samoa apparently\r\nprefers berries and soft fruits. Dr. Reinecke says that it especially\r\nfavours the berries of Cananga odorata, the seeds of which are not over\r\na third of an inch (8 mm.) in length.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from Mr. Hamilton’s note in the _Transactions and\r\nProceedings of the New Zealand Institute_ (vol. 24) that the extinct\r\nStruthious birds of New Zealand, as in the case of the moa, carried\r\ncrop-stones sometimes as large as a pigeon’s egg. These pebbles are, of\r\ncourse, swallowed by birds to enable them to crush the hard seeds, and\r\n“stones” of fleshy fruits, on which they feed. In the Solomon Islands I\r\nnoticed that the Nicobar pigeon was able in this way to crack the seeds\r\nof Adenanthera pavonina, which for their fracture require a blow with a\r\nhammer. The implication is that the extinct Columbæ were able to\r\ntransport to oceanic groups seeds and “stones” which no existing pigeon\r\ncould now carry over a tract of ocean. I am inclined to extend this view\r\nalso to extinct Struthious birds, and to suppose that they were able,\r\nlike the cassowary (see page 152), to fly across tracts of sea in ages\r\ngone by. Though such an agency would come under discussion in connection\r\nwith the floras of New Zealand and Madagascar, we have no evidence to\r\nshow that birds of this family ever reached the tropical islands of the\r\nopen Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe Megapodidæ of the Western Pacific are a family of birds that suggest\r\nthemselves in this connection. Their distribution corresponds with that\r\nof Pandanus in the Western Pacific, excepting the littoral species; and\r\nlike Pandanus the Megapodes have “differentiated” in every group. The\r\nlimited powers of flight possessed by existing species would unfit them\r\nfor crossing wide tracts of sea; but the parent form or forms of all\r\nthese species must have been able to traverse broad tracts of ocean.\r\nThese birds subsist on fallen fruits, seeds, &c.; but I have no data\r\nrelating to them as seed-dispersers.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the endemic character of most of the species of\r\nPandanus in oceanic islands that, except with a few widely-spread\r\nlittoral species, the dispersal of the genus has been for ages\r\nsuspended. Whether the explanation is to be found in the isolation and\r\ndifferentiation of the extinct Columbæ of the Mascarene Islands, where\r\nthe endemic species of Pandanus are most numerous, has yet to be\r\nestablished. It seems to offer the only way out of the difficulty,\r\nunless we accept the old view concerned with the continent of Lemuria.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BARRINGTONIA.\r\n\r\nThere are two littoral species of this genus in the Pacific, B. speciosa\r\nand B. racemosa, both widely spread over the Old World, but only the\r\nfirst is generally distributed over the Polynesian region reaching east\r\nto Ducie Island, whilst the second does not extend east of Fiji and\r\nSamoa. With the exception of one or two inland species in Fiji and Samoa\r\nno inland species have been recorded from the groups of the open\r\nPacific, and the genus is not represented at all in Hawaii. If it were\r\nnot for a suspicion that the aborigines may have aided in the\r\ndistribution of the inland species, the advocate of the previous\r\ncontinental connections of the islands of the Western Pacific would\r\nreceive from their occurrence in these islands considerable support for\r\nhis views. The fruits of the inland Fijian species are large, the\r\nsmallest being three inches in length; and the agency of birds seems to\r\nbe out of the question.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of the littoral species possess dry buoyant husks that enable\r\nthem to be carried by the currents over wide tracts of ocean. Those of\r\nthe Fijian inland species display only a trace of these buoyant\r\ncoverings and the floating power is much diminished or absent\r\naltogether. These inland species are two or three in number. One of\r\nthem, described as a new species by Seemann under the name of B. edulis,\r\nhas edible kernels and is sometimes cultivated. A species that I found\r\ngrowing in the plantations of the Solomon Islanders in Bougainville\r\nStraits may be near the Fijian tree just named (_Solomon Islands_, pp.\r\n85, 297). Its kernels are edible; and I may add that the Solomon\r\nIslanders cultivate other species with edible fruits. We cannot,\r\ntherefore, exclude the agency of the aborigines in the distribution of\r\nthe inland species of this genus. Horne found an undescribed species in\r\nFiji, which may be that which I found on the slopes of Mount Seatura in\r\nVanua Levu, as described in Note 50; and it is quite possible that it\r\nwas originally a cultivated tree, though not necessarily within the\r\nmemory of the later generations of the aborigines.\r\n\r\nThis retrocession to the wild state of cultivated plants and the\r\nresulting production of apparently new species is a point on which Dr.\r\nBeccari lays considerable stress in the English edition of his book on\r\nthe Great Forests of Borneo. He takes the case of Nephelium and other\r\nfruit-trees and shows how in old clearings, long since abandoned, they\r\nhave undergone singular alteration in characters. For these reasons,\r\ntherefore, Barringtonia can scarcely be regarded as offering in its\r\ninland species unequivocal evidence of a previous continental condition\r\nof the islands of the Western Pacific. Nor, as shown in Note 50, should\r\nwe be justified in establishing a genetic connection between the inland\r\nand coast species; but a great deal of research is needed before we can\r\nhandle the numerous interesting problems connected with the genus; and\r\nindeed it cannot be said that the specific limits of the inland\r\nPolynesian trees have been definitely determined, or the species\r\nthemselves diagnosed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SECTION V.\r\n\r\nIn this section are included those genera where within the same genus\r\nsome inland species have been derived from the coast species whilst\r\nothers have been originally brought by birds. Guettarda alone belongs\r\nhere. In this genus we find, as is so frequently the case, a littoral\r\ntree (G. speciosa) widely spread in the Old World and ranging over the\r\nwhole tropical Pacific as far east as Pitcairn and Elizabeth islands,\r\nbut absent from Hawaii. Here also as with Pandanus it is only in the\r\nWestern Pacific that we find inland endemic species so distinct in\r\ncharacter from the littoral tree that they may be regarded as of\r\nindependent origin.\r\n\r\nSince, however, there is an inland form of the coast species in Tahiti\r\n(Guettarda speciosa, var. tahitensis) which, according to Drake del\r\nCastillo, is distinguished only by its more rounded leaves and by the\r\nmore marked pubescence of the under leaf-surfaces, we evidently have\r\nthere an inland species in process of development from the littoral\r\nspecies. This inland tree is found at elevations as great as 600 metres\r\nor almost 2,000 feet above the sea; and indeed if we follow Nadeaud the\r\nspecific differentiation is complete. However, there is no doubt raised\r\nas to its close affinity to the beach tree; and we are almost compelled\r\nfor another reason to regard it as a derivative of the shore species,\r\nbecause, as pointed out in Chapter XXVII., there are very few inland\r\nplants in the Tahitian flora possessing fruits as large as those of\r\nGuettarda that owe their presence in those islands to frugivorous birds.\r\n\r\nOf the two inland species of the genus found in Fiji, G. inconspicua and\r\nG. vitiensis, it may at once be said that, as indicated in Dr. Seemann’s\r\nwork, their characters are far from suggesting any connection in origin\r\nwith G. speciosa, the shore-species, the inland and littoral plants\r\nbelonging to different sections of the genus. In their case we can only\r\nlook to the frugivorous bird for the explanation of their existence in\r\nthe group. The fruits would be probably small; and in this connection it\r\nis to be noted that Mr. H. N. Ridley in his paper on the flora of\r\nFernando Noronha evidently looks to birds to account for the presence of\r\na species of Guettarda on the island, a species not found elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBut another inland Fijian form of Guettarda found by me in Vanua Levu at\r\nelevations of 1,000 to 1,400 feet above the sea, and dubbed by the\r\nnatives with the name of the littoral tree (Mbua-mbua), corresponds in\r\nits close relation to G. speciosa with the inland Tahitian form of that\r\ntree, and is to all appearance a derivative of it. It is chiefly\r\ndistinguished by its thinner, more hairy leaves, which taper at each end\r\nand are not subcordate at the base as is often the case with the leaves\r\nof G. speciosa. The coverings of the fruit are less fibrous and the\r\nputamen is not so deeply notched or grooved. The difference also extends\r\nto the buoyancy of the fruits in accordance with the principle laid down\r\nin Chapter II. Whilst those of G. speciosa float for many months and are\r\nof common occurrence amongst the stranded drift of tropical beaches, as\r\nfor instance in the Keeling Islands, in the Solomon Group, and in Fiji,\r\nthose of the inland species float only for a few weeks, their softer\r\ncoverings decaying more rapidly in sea-water.\r\n\r\nWe seem therefore to have had two principles at work in Fiji in\r\ndetermining the origin of the inland species of Guettarda. Whilst in one\r\ncase the inland species is so sharply distinguished from the coast\r\nspecies as to require the independent agency of frugivorous birds to\r\nexplain its presence, in the other the inland form, as in the instance\r\nalso of the Tahitian variety, is so much akin to it that the probability\r\nof derivation from it is very great.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION VI.\r\n\r\nIn this section are contained genera possessing littoral species\r\nrestricted to the Western Pacific islands, and dispersed by birds, but\r\nhaving little or no capacity for dispersal by the currents. They are\r\nregarded as derived from the inland species of the genus in the western\r\npart of the Pacific, and as distributed from thence over the islands in\r\nthat part of the ocean. We are here only concerned with Fiji, Tonga, and\r\nSamoa and the neighbouring islands. The genera Eugenia, Drymispermum,\r\nand Acacia are here comprised.\r\n\r\nThe genus Eugenia, though essentially inland in its station, is apt to\r\nlend species to the beach-flora in different parts of the tropics. Such\r\nspecies, being dispersed by frugivorous birds and other animals, and\r\npossessing but slight capacity for distribution by the currents, are\r\nusually restricted in their areas. Thus, Schimper (p. 118) names two or\r\nthree species, including E. javanica, as amongst the Indo-Malayan\r\nstrand-flora. Ridley notices that E. grandis is a common sea-shore tree\r\nin the Malay peninsula; and the author observed two littoral trees of\r\nthe genus in the islands of Bougainville Straits in the Solomon Group,\r\nthe fruits of one of them that flourished in the interior of the coral\r\nislets being found in the crops of fruit-pigeons. So also in Fiji, some\r\nof the inland species, as E. rariflora, appear at times amongst the\r\nstrand vegetation and in the coral islets. There is, however, one Fijian\r\nspecies found also in Samoa and Tonga that is a characteristic beach\r\ntree, namely E. richii (Gray), and it is more or less confined to that\r\nstation. The fruits will float a fortnight in sea-water, which is nearly\r\ntwice as long as most other Eugenia fruits will float; and it is quite\r\npossible that the currents may assist the pigeons in distributing the\r\nspecies. This genus is dealt with more in detail in Chapter XXVI.\r\n\r\nThe genus Drymispermum (Thymeleaceæ) comprises in the Western Pacific a\r\nnumber of species, of which two range over the groups of Fiji, Tonga,\r\nand Samoa, whilst some four or more are peculiar to Fiji. All are inland\r\nplants with the exception of D. Burnettianum, a characteristic littoral\r\nshrub of these three groups. Its bright red drupes float only from five\r\nto ten days, even after some weeks of drying; and like those of the\r\ninland species they are well suited for dispersal by fruit-pigeons. This\r\nbeach-plant may be regarded as probably an intruder in the strand-flora\r\nfrom the interior of one of the islands of the Western Pacific, whence\r\nbirds, perhaps assisted a little by currents, have carried it to the\r\nneighbouring groups.\r\n\r\nThe very remarkable coast tree, Acacia laurifolia, alone represents its\r\ngenus in the littoral flora of the Pacific islands. It is confined to\r\nthe Western Pacific, having been found in New Caledonia, the New\r\nHebrides, Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa; but it is doubtful whether it is truly\r\nindigenous in all these localities. Thus, in Samoa, though restricted to\r\nthe coast districts, as we learn from Reinecke it seldom flowers, and\r\naccording to that botanist it was probably introduced through\r\ncultivation. It is, however, evidently regarded by the Samoans as a tree\r\nof their group, as is shown in a curious legend, given by Dr. George\r\nTurner in his latest book on those islands, which I have quoted in my\r\nbook on the Solomon Islands, p. 287. Both in Fiji and Samoa it bears the\r\nname “tatangia” or “tatania,” whilst its hard wood was employed for\r\nvarious purposes, the leaves being used as spoons. The tree flowers and\r\nseeds freely on the Fijian beaches. The pods dry up on the plant, and do\r\nnot dehisce, but are apt to break across between the seeds into\r\narticle-like portions, the seeds being ultimately liberated by the decay\r\nof the pod or its fragments. The seeds either sink at once or in the\r\ncourse of a day or two; whilst the pods or their fragments float at\r\nfirst in sea-water, but all are at the bottom in a week or less. With\r\nits absence of any apparent means of dispersal this small tree presents\r\nquite an anomaly in the strand-floras of the Western Pacific, and can\r\nonly be regarded as a loan from the inland flora, though probably of a\r\nvery ancient date, and perhaps going back like Acacia koa, the\r\nforest-tree of Hawaii to some early epoch in the history of these\r\nislands.\r\n\r\n\r\n   _The conclusions to be drawn from the discussion of the relations\r\nbetween the littoral and inland species of the same genus in the Pacific\r\n                  islands._ (Chapters XIV., XV., XVI.)\r\n\r\nIn ten of the twenty-two genera here dealt with (Calophyllum, Hibiscus,\r\nColubrina, Morinda, Scævola, Cordia, Ipomœa, Vitex, Tacca, Casuarina)\r\nthe shore and inland species have their own independent modes of\r\ndispersal, usually by currents in the case of coast plants, and by birds\r\nin that of inland plants; and the relations between the two are not such\r\nas to suggest a derivation of one from the other.\r\n\r\nIn six genera the inland species are regarded as derived from the\r\nlittoral species. In two of them, as in Vigna and Premna, where the\r\ncoast and inland species occur in the same group of islands and are\r\nconnected by intermediate forms, there is direct evidence in favour of\r\nthis conclusion; but such a development of inland species need not have\r\ntaken place in every group, since in the instance of Premna it has\r\napparently occurred only in the Western Pacific, and the inland and\r\ncoast species have extended independently to the eastern groups through\r\nthe agencies of birds and currents.... In the other four genera\r\n(Canavalia, Erythrina, Sophora, Ochrosia) we have presented the\r\nso-called “Hawaiian difficulty,” that group being alone concerned.\r\nAlthough these genera have no littoral species in Hawaii, they have\r\ninland species in those islands, which are in three genera endemic.\r\nSince these inland species have non-buoyant seeds or seedvessels, the\r\ntransport of which by birds half-way across the Pacific Ocean is in the\r\ncase of the first three genera unlikely and in the last impossible, it\r\nis assumed that they are all derived from original coast species with\r\nbuoyant seeds or fruits, such as are widely distributed over the Pacific\r\nbut are not now existing in Hawaii. This assumption, in the instance of\r\nthe Leguminosæ, to which the first three genera belong, derives support\r\nfrom the singular fact in the distribution of the order pointed out by\r\nMr. Hemsley, that it is wanting in many oceanic islands where there is\r\nno littoral flora.\r\n\r\nIn one genus, Guettarda, the inland species are regarded as having been\r\nsometimes developed independently of the coast species, and as at other\r\ntimes derived from it, both principles having been at work in Fiji and\r\nonly the last in Tahiti.\r\n\r\nIn two genera, Pandanus and Barringtonia, which represent the “Fijian\r\ndifficulty,” there is no reason on grounds of affinity to connect the\r\ninland with the coast species; and since the agency of existing birds is\r\nimprobable in the first genus and out of the question in the second,\r\nwhilst the operation of the currents is excluded for the inland species\r\nof both genera, it is assumed that we must either appeal to the agency\r\nof extinct birds, such as those of the Mascarene Islands, or we must\r\nfall back on the hypothesis of a continental connection. In the instance\r\nof Barringtonia it is also possible that some of the inland species may\r\nhave been derived from species spread through cultivation.\r\n\r\nLastly, in three genera (Eugenia, Drymispermum, Acacia) the coast\r\nspecies are viewed as derivatives of the inland flora in the Western\r\nPacific, not necessarily in Fiji, but it may be in New Caledonia or in\r\none of the other large groups. In this case the coast species of all\r\nthree genera are either unfitted for dispersal by currents, or display\r\nthe capacity only in a small degree.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that in only seven of these twenty-two genera, containing\r\nboth littoral and inland species in the Pacific islands, can it be\r\nargued from the standpoint of dispersal that the inland species are or\r\nmay have been derived from the shore species; and in most instances the\r\nevidence is largely presumptive in its character. In three genera the\r\nreverse has been the case, and here the coast has borrowed from the\r\ninland flora. In twelve, or more than half of the genera, the shore and\r\ninland species have been evidently independent in their origin. It is\r\naccordingly apparent that in the Pacific the strand flora has lent more\r\nto the inland flora than it has borrowed from it; but with a large\r\nproportion of these coast genera no interchange has taken place.\r\nTwo-thirds of the genera of the beach-plants have no inland species, and\r\nin their case the question of such a connection cannot be raised. With\r\nthe remaining genera such a relation can be suggested in only two-fifths\r\nof the cases, or in about one-seventh of the total number of beach\r\ngenera. Where a connection can be traced, it points more frequently to\r\nthe derivation of the inland from the shore plant. Taking all the\r\nevidence together, the beach flora presents itself in the Pacific as\r\npractically independent of the inland flora as regards its origin. It\r\nhas received in these regions but few recruits from inland. It has\r\nyielded, except in Hawaii, but few recruits to the inland flora. In this\r\nocean it bears the stamp of a high antiquity, though in the mass no\r\ndoubt of more recent origin than the mangrove flora.\r\n\r\nYet, as I have remarked in different parts of this work, even with the\r\nbeach genera possessing no inland species, considerable variety is\r\ndisplayed in the behaviour of the strand species. Thus, whilst some,\r\nlike Pemphis acidula, Tournefortia argentea, and Triumfetta procumbens,\r\nrarely if ever leave the beach, others, like Heritiera littoralis and\r\nExcæcaria agallocha, find a home on the borders of the mangrove swamps,\r\nand one or two extend inland and take their place in the forests, either\r\nas trees (Afzelia bijuga) or as giant climbers (Entada scandens). Others\r\nagain, like Cassytha filiformis, Cerbera Odollam, and Cycas circinalis,\r\nwith a number of other beach-plants, may invade the interior of the\r\nisland wherever arid plains or exposed scantily wooded districts offer\r\nconditions conformable to the xerophytic habit of the beach-plants.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be perceived that although the inland and coast floras of\r\nan island are in the mass distinct, the line of separation is by no\r\nmeans always well defined. Beach-plants are something more than\r\nsalt-lovers in their ways. They are in the first place xerophilous, or,\r\nin other words, they will be equally at home in exposed situations away\r\nfrom the coast where the soil is dry and the rainfall scanty. Whenever\r\nthese conditions are presented by the districts backing the coast, as we\r\nfind for instance in the plains on the lee or dry sides of many a\r\nPacific island, the shore-plants will often leave the beach and travel\r\nfar inland.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Summary of Chapters XIV., XV., XVI._\r\n\r\n(1) Though littoral floras are as a rule chiefly made up of two sets of\r\nplants, one brought through the agency of the currents from regions\r\noutside, and the other derived from the inland flora of the region\r\nconcerned, the proportion of the two varies much amongst temperate and\r\ntropical strand-floras, the current-borne plants forming the majority in\r\nthe tropics, and those from the inland flora of the region prevailing in\r\nthe temperate zone.\r\n\r\n(2) There is, therefore, far greater uniformity as a rule amongst\r\ntropical strand-floras than in the temperate zone, since in temperate\r\nlatitudes the prevailing constituents of the strand flora vary with the\r\ninland flora of every region, whilst in the tropics the predominant\r\nplants are those ranging far and wide on the shores of the warm regions\r\nof the globe.\r\n\r\n(3) Regarding the tropical strand-flora as comprising two formations,\r\nthat of the beach and that of the mangrove swamp, the last, which is the\r\nolder of the two, may, it is suggested, be viewed as the remnant of an\r\nancient flora widely spread over the lower levels and coastal regions of\r\nthe globe, during an age when, in a warm atmosphere charged with watery\r\nvapour and heavy with mist and cloud, vivipary or germination on the\r\nplant was not the exception but the rule.\r\n\r\n(4) But it is contended that even in the beach formation some of the\r\nplants may date back to this age of vivipary, as is indicated by the\r\nanomalous seed-structures of some of the genera, such as Barringtonia,\r\nwhich seem to indicate a lost viviparous habit.\r\n\r\n(5) Since the beach formation of the islands of the tropical Pacific is\r\nlargely formed of plants ranging over great areas in the tropics, there\r\nis no reason to expect that it owes much to recruits from the inland\r\nfloras of this region. The discussion, therefore, of the relation\r\nbetween the littoral and inland floras is mainly concerned with the\r\npossible origin of inland from coast plants in these islands.\r\n\r\n(6) Yet there are numerous cases of genera possessing both coast and\r\ninland species that are of peculiar interest in determining the true\r\nrelation between the beach and inland floras.\r\n\r\n(7) As the result of a detailed discussion of these genera, the\r\nconclusion is formed that the beach and inland floras have been in the\r\nmain developed on independent lines, the beach flora receiving from the\r\ninland flora but few recruits, and except in Hawaii yielding but few\r\nplants to the inland flora. Only a third of the genera of the beach\r\nflora have also inland species, and in only a few of these genera, or\r\nabout a seventh of the whole beach flora, can any question of a\r\nconnection between coast and inland species of the same genus be raised.\r\n\r\n(8) Two special difficulties arise in this discussion. The first is the\r\n“Hawaiian difficulty,” which is more particularly concerned with genera\r\nof the orders Leguminosæ and Apocynaceæ. Here are genera which possess\r\nboth inland and littoral species, but only the first occur in Hawaii. In\r\nthe absence of any likely means of dispersal, whether by currents or by\r\nbirds, it is assumed that the inland species are derived from shore\r\nplants, originally brought by the currents, that have since disappeared,\r\na view supported by the fact that Leguminosæ are wanting in oceanic\r\nislands where there is no littoral flora. The second is the “Fijian\r\ndifficulty” which is best represented by Pandanus. From our inability to\r\nregard the inland species as derivatives of the coast species, or to\r\nsupply them with a means of dispersal, we are compelled to regard them\r\neither as having been a part of the original continental flora of Fiji\r\nor as owing their existence there to the agency of extinct birds having\r\nthe habits of the Nicobar pigeon and of the extinct Columbæ of the\r\nMascarene Islands. Since the Mascarene Islands are noted not only for\r\ntheir extinct Columbæ but also for their number of peculiar species of\r\nPandanus, the implication seems to lie against the continental view. The\r\nsubject, however, awaits further investigation. In the Western Pacific\r\nthe possible agency of the parent forms of the existing species of\r\nMegapodidæ is worthy of attention. Like the Columbæ and Pandanus in the\r\nMascarene Islands, the Megapodes and Pandanus have “differentiated”\r\ntogether in the Western Pacific.\r\n\r\n(9) The general view of the independent origin of the beach and inland\r\nfloras of the Pacific islands is supported by the large number of genera\r\nin the strand flora that only possess littoral species.\r\n\r\n(10) Such shore species, together with other strand plants, sometimes\r\nextend into the interior of an island, but only as a rule where the\r\nrequisite conditions for a plant of xerophilous habit exist.\r\n\r\n(11) Shore plants, it is pointed out, are xerophytes first and\r\nhalophytes afterwards; and under certain conditions the purely\r\nxerophilous inclination prevails and the plants travel far inland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n     THE STORIES OF AFZELIA BIJUGA, ENTADA SCANDENS, AND CÆSALPINIA\r\n                               BONDUCELLA\r\n\r\nAfzelia bijuga.—The African home of the genus.—The double station of\r\n  Afzelia bijuga, inland and at the coast.—The nature of the buoyancy\r\n  of its seeds.—Summary relating to Afzelia bijuga.—Entada\r\n  scandens.—Its station and distribution.—Darwin’s opinion of the\r\n  plant.—The dispersal of its seeds by the currents.—Summary relating\r\n  to the plant.—Cæsalpinia bonducella and C. bonduc.—Their station and\r\n  distribution.—Their characters in various Pacific groups.—The\r\n  parents of inland species.—Their dispersal by the currents.—The\r\n  germination of their seeds.—A dream of vivipary.—The causes of the\r\n  seed-buoyancy.—Summary of results.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN this chapter we have a study of Leguminous strand plants that are of\r\ngreat interest. It can be safely said that the student of\r\nplant-dispersal in the Pacific will be brought into contact with the\r\nproblems here involved wherever he goes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         AFZELIA BIJUGA (Gray).\r\n\r\nThis Old World tree, which belongs to the sub-family Cæsalpiniæ, is of\r\ngreat interest to the student of plant-dispersal. It is one of that\r\nlarge group of Indo-Malayan plants that extend into the Western Pacific,\r\nand give the prevailing character to the floras of such archipelagoes as\r\nthat of Fiji. It is a large tree yielding a valuable timber used by the\r\nFijians and Samoans for many purposes, such as for canoes, house-posts,\r\nclubs, kava bowls, &c., but it has not been recorded from the Tahitian\r\nregion, and is unknown from Hawaii. In the fact of its being a littoral\r\nas well as an inland tree, it possesses a peculiar interest from the\r\nstandpoint of plant-dispersal, and especially since this difference in\r\nstation is associated with a difference in buoyancy, the seeds of the\r\ninland trees usually sinking, whilst those of the coast trees usually\r\nfloat, and often for a period of months.\r\n\r\nA glance at the distribution of the genus will enable us to appreciate\r\nsome of the points that will be touched upon in the following\r\ndiscussion; and it may be here remarked that the explanation of the\r\ndistribution of these Leguminous trees will go far to make clear some of\r\nthe most difficult points in plant-geography. Of the eleven species\r\nenumerated in the _Index Kewensis_, five belong to tropical Africa,\r\noccurring on both the east and west coasts as well as in the interior,\r\nthree are confined to the mainland of tropical Asia, and two are\r\npeculiar to Malaya. In the last place we have the wide-ranging Afzelia\r\nbijuga, which, if it does not actually occur on the east coast of\r\nAfrica, is found at all events in Madagascar and in the Seychelles, and\r\nis to be followed by the way of the Chagos Archipelago to the Malayan\r\nIslands and Queensland, and eastward to Fiji and Samoa.\r\n\r\nThe most suggestive feature in the distribution of the genus is to be\r\nseen in the frequent station of the species by rivers. We learn from\r\nOliver’s _Flora of Tropical Africa_ that these trees find a home along\r\nriver-courses on both sides of the continent, as on the banks of the\r\nCongo, the Niger, the rivers of Senegambia, and the Zambesi, the Zambesi\r\nspecies being found also on the shores of Lake Nyassa. Since tropical\r\nAfrica possesses about half of the species, it would seem highly\r\nprobable that it is the home of the genus, and that from the\r\nrain-forests in the heart of the continent rivers flowing east and west\r\nhave borne the buoyant seeds of the wandering species to the coasts of\r\nthe Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The operation that I witnessed on a\r\nminiature scale in the case of a _species_ of Entada (E. scandens) in\r\nthe Isthmus of Panama, as described in a later page of this chapter, has\r\nbeen in progress through the ages with the _genus_ of Afzelia in the\r\nbreadth of the African continent. According to the principle illustrated\r\nby Afzelia bijuga in the forests of Fiji, the seeds of the African\r\nforest-trees would, as a rule, possess no floating power; but now and\r\nthen in the lapse of long periods of time buoyancy in some species would\r\nbe developed, and such species would ultimately, through their buoyant\r\nseeds, find their station along the lower courses of the rivers.\r\n\r\nTo sustain this view it is not necessary that continuous rain-forests\r\nshould now clothe the elevated regions in the interior of tropical\r\nAfrica; but it is requisite that there should be sometimes a generic\r\nsimilarity between the plants of the East African and West African\r\nrain-forests; and it is evident that this is the case. Pechuel-Lösche,\r\nas quoted by Schimper (_Plant-Geography_, p. 299), describes the\r\nrain-forest on the Loango coast as covering the mountain ranges and as\r\nextending to the river-plains. In such a locality the operation would be\r\nrapid. In advancing this hypothesis I am referring to the possibility,\r\nhowever, of such an operation having effected the distribution of\r\nAfzelia in tropical Africa in the past rather than in the present. I\r\nwould suggest that botanists in other habitats of the genus, as for\r\ninstance in Queensland, might put it to the test of observation and\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nThe interest that attaches itself to the story of the genus in its\r\nAfrican home may be extended to the species that forms its outpost in\r\nthe Pacific, and we shall see there a littoral species that doubtless\r\nhad its home in the interior of a continent endeavouring, with a\r\nconsiderable measure of success, to become again an inland plant. Horne\r\n(p. 112), who was familiar with Afzelia bijuga at the two extremes of\r\nits range, namely, in the Mascarene Islands and in Fiji, speaks of it as\r\ncharacteristic of the shores of tropical regions; and Schimper, who\r\nincludes it in the Indo-Malayan strand-flora, implies that it is more or\r\nless exclusively confined to the coast and its immediate vicinity (pages\r\n121, 191-2). In the Seychelles, according to Mr. Button, this tree\r\nattains gigantic dimensions on the sandy flats. Still larger trees occur\r\nin the coral islands of the Chagos Archipelago; but in the atoll of\r\nDiego Garcia, as we learn from Mr. Bourne, it is almost extinct only\r\nsome four or five trees existing there about twenty years ago, the\r\nincrease of the tree being prevented through the destruction of the\r\nfallen seeds by the rats (_Journ. Linn. Soc. Bot._, vol. 22, 1887).\r\n\r\nAfzelia bijuga may, therefore, be safely regarded as a littoral tree. We\r\nshall now see the importance of this conclusion when we come to consider\r\nits station in the Pacific islands, where it grows both inland and at\r\nthe coast, and we have to decide to which station we must assign the\r\npriority. Speaking of its occurrence in Fiji, Dr. Seemann says it is\r\n“common in the forests all over Viti,” but makes no allusion to it as a\r\nlittoral tree either in Fiji or elsewhere. On the other hand, Mr. Horne\r\n(p. 112) describes it as “generally growing on the shore or sandy\r\nbeaches, and in rocky clefts, and by the sides of streams in the\r\ninterior of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu.” It was on or near the coast in\r\nFiji that the present writer was most familiar with this tree, sometimes\r\nbordering the sandy beach, at other times growing behind the\r\nmangrove-belt, or again thriving in the half sandy and half swampy soil\r\nof some low islet off the mouth of the Rewa. Especially is it to be\r\nfound on those parts of the coast where the hill-slopes descend rapidly\r\nto the beach, or where some lofty spur from the mountains of the\r\ninterior reaches the shore. It is also not uncommon on the banks of\r\nrivers both in their lower and upper courses. But it is as a forest-tree\r\nof the interior that it is most valued by both the white men and the\r\nnatives on account of the superior quality of its timber in that\r\nstation. There, far removed from stream or river, the Vesi, as the\r\nFijians name Afzelia bijuga, takes its place amongst the lofty\r\nforest-trees, such as the Ndamanu (Calophyllum), the Ndakua (Dammara),\r\nand the Wathi-wathi (Sterculia). It is not often that one finds a tree\r\nin these islands that, like the Vesi, is able to make its home in almost\r\nany station, excepting, however, the “talasinga” or “sun-burnt” regions\r\nof the plains. Wherever tall trees grow gregariously in Vanua Levu, one\r\nwill probably find Afzelia bijuga, whether beside a sandy beach, or\r\nbordering a swamp, or on a river’s bank, or on some rocky declivity, or\r\non the great forest-clad mountain-slopes and plateaux of the interior.\r\nNo doubt the same diversity of station is displayed in Samoa, where,\r\naccording to Dr. Reinecke, the tree is most frequent in the\r\n“coast-bush.”\r\n\r\nFrom the variety in station it might be expected that corresponding\r\nvariations in character would be found. There are differences, such as\r\nin the quality of the timber and in the size of the seeds between coast\r\nand inland trees; but the most important distinction in connection with\r\nthe study of the dispersal of the species is to be found in the\r\ncircumstance that whilst the seeds of the coast trees are, as a rule,\r\nbuoyant, and often float for months, those of the inland trees usually\r\nsink, even after being kept for three or four years. I made a\r\nconsiderable number of experiments on the buoyancy of the seeds of this\r\ntree in Vanua Levu, and found that with the coast trees, as a rule,\r\neither all the seeds or the majority of them floated in sea-water,\r\nwhilst with the inland trees either all of them or the majority of them\r\nsank. The buoyant seeds are able in most cases to float for a long time.\r\nThus, in one experiment half were afloat after two months, and in\r\nanother half were afloat after five months. It is probable that several\r\nof the exceptions, where inland seeds float, will prove to be connected\r\nwith an inland station by a river. (I experimented on eight sets of\r\nseeds of coast trees from eight different localities, and found 70 to be\r\nthe mean percentage of buoyant seeds. In the same way, four sets of\r\nseeds from four different inland localities gave 13 as the mean\r\npercentage of buoyant seeds.)\r\n\r\nAs in the case of Entada scandens, there is a rather fine adjustment\r\nbetween the mean specific weight of seeds and the density of water. If\r\nwe place a number of the buoyant seeds in sea-water and begin to lower\r\nthe density, some of the seeds will at once commence to float heavily\r\nand afterwards sink; and when the density has been lowered to\r\napproximately that of fresh water, usually about a third will be found\r\nat the bottom of the vessel. Out of 100 coast seeds, 70 will, as a rule,\r\nfloat in the sea and about 47 in the river; whilst of the same number of\r\ninland seeds, 13 on the average will float in sea-water and 8 or 9 in\r\nfresh water. The bearing of facts of this kind is especially discussed\r\nin Chapter X.\r\n\r\nComing to the causes of the floating-power of the seeds, we find that\r\nwith the buoyant seeds the kernel floats, whilst with the non-buoyant\r\nseeds it sinks, the seed-tests in neither case possessing any\r\nfloating-power. In this respect, therefore, the seeds of Afzelia bijuga\r\nbelong, with the seeds of some other Leguminous littoral plants of the\r\nPacific islands, such as Canavalia obtusifolia, Erythrina indica, and\r\nSophora tomentosa, to the second section of the second non-adaptive\r\ngroup of buoyant seeds (page 107). But though we can in a measure\r\nexplain the cause of the buoyancy, we are still ignorant of the manner\r\nin which the difference in the buoyant behaviour of coast and inland\r\nseeds has been brought about. It is possible that this may be connected\r\nwith another difference between the coast and inland seeds, the latter\r\nbeing markedly smaller, and it is noteworthy that in my experiments the\r\nsmaller seeds were generally those that sank. (Whilst the inland seeds\r\naveraged between 8/10 and 1 inch, or 20 to 25 mm., in greatest diameter,\r\n12 to 16 being required to make an ounce, the coast seeds measured 1 to\r\n1-2/10 inch, or 25 to 30 mm., and only 10 or 11 were needed to weigh an\r\nounce.)\r\n\r\nThere can be no question that the seeds are at times transported by the\r\ncurrents over wide tracts of sea, and this no doubt explains the\r\noccurrence of Afzelia bijuga in oceanic islands. They may be usually\r\nseen lying free in numbers on the ground beneath the tree or else still\r\ninclosed in the fallen dehiscing and decaying pods; and they might be\r\nswept sometimes into the sea or washed down into an adjacent stream.\r\nThey thus came under my notice amongst the stranded beach drift at the\r\nmouths of estuaries in Fiji. But it is remarkable that the seeds have\r\nnot apparently been recorded from the beach drift of other tropical\r\nregions. Penzig does not note them amongst the seeds stranded on the\r\nshores of Krakatoa. They did not occur amongst my collections from the\r\nbeaches of Keeling Atoll or of the south coast of Java; nor does\r\nSchimper mention them amongst the drift of the Java Sea. In the _Botany\r\nof the “Challenger” Expedition_ the species is not even referred to in\r\nany connection. Although, however, the capacity of these seeds for\r\ndispersal by currents is for the first time established by me, their\r\nfitness in this respect was surmised by Schimper (p. 191), when he\r\nplaced the species in his list of tropical shore plants evidently\r\ndistributed by the currents.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be gathered that we have yet much to learn in this matter;\r\nand I would recommend any resident in the tropics to take up this\r\nsubject. When indeed we remember the fine adjustment existing between\r\nthe specific weight of the seeds and the density of water, and recall\r\nthe unknown factor determining the difference in buoyancy between the\r\nkernels of coast and inland seeds, we can understand how under\r\nparticular conditions in certain portions of its range the seeds of\r\nAfzelia bijuga may perhaps never possess any floating power. It would\r\nseem, in fact, that the seeds are much more buoyant in the Western\r\nPacific than they are in the Java Sea; or it may be that the tree is\r\nmuch less frequent; or that the stranded seeds are soon destroyed by\r\ncrabs, such as is the fate of much seed-drift on the Keeling beaches; or\r\nlastly that, as in Diego Garcia, rats in destroying the fallen seeds are\r\nbringing about the extermination of the species.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Summary relating to Afzelia bijuga._\r\n\r\n(1) Assuming that the genus has its home in the African continent, and\r\nthat the species have frequently a riverside station, it is argued that\r\nthe distribution of the genus on both sides of that continent can only\r\nbe explained by its dispersal by rivers from a centre in the interior.\r\n\r\n(2) Afzelia bijuga, a widely distributed shore tree of tropical Asia,\r\noccurs in Fiji both at the coast and in the inland forests.\r\n\r\n(3) This double station is associated _inter alia_ with a different\r\nbuoyant behaviour of the seeds, those of the coast trees usually\r\nfloating for long periods, whilst those from inland generally sink.\r\n\r\n(4) There can be no doubt that this widely ranging littoral tree has\r\nbeen dispersed by the currents; but the specific weight of the coast\r\nseeds is on the average but slightly less than that of sea-water; and it\r\nis to this fine adjustment, always liable to be disturbed by variations\r\nin the environment, that the irregularities in the distribution of the\r\nspecies are to be attributed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ENTADA SCANDENS (Benth.).\r\n\r\nThe story of Entada scandens, a plant familiar to many of my readers\r\nunder the name of the Queensland Bean, is a story of three continents,\r\nAfrica, Asia, and America. From the point of view of its dispersal two\r\nfeatures at once attract attention in the case of this giant-climber; in\r\nthe first place its wide distribution over the tropics of the Old and\r\nNew Worlds, and in the second place the great capacity of its large\r\nseeds, often two inches across, for dispersal by the currents. But\r\nbefore discussing these matters it will be necessary to glance at the\r\ndistribution of the genus, since much light will thereby be thrown on\r\nsome of the numerous difficult points affecting this extremely\r\ninteresting tropical plant. Of the thirteen species enumerated in the\r\n_Index Kewensis_, seven are African, three are American, one is Burmese,\r\none hails from Madagascar, and, lastly, there is the world-ranging\r\nEntada scandens, concerning whose home botanists are not agreed. Most of\r\nthe species would seem to be inland plants, whilst Entada scandens\r\nthrives both inland and at the coast. Africa would thus appear to be, as\r\nwith Afzelia, the principal home of the genus, but with America as a\r\nsubsidiary centre.\r\n\r\nIn many points Entada scandens presents a parallel to Cæsalpinia\r\nbonducella, another Leguminous tropical plant which occurs also at the\r\ncoast and inland. But since they both owe their wide distribution to\r\ntheir littoral station, it will be as coast plants that they will be\r\nmost properly considered in this and the following chapter. Yet if the\r\nstudent were to regard the distribution of these two plants in a\r\ncontinental region as in India, where they extend inland to the\r\nHimalayas, he might fail to discern their true station. To accurately\r\ngauge the matter of their station, it is necessary for him to look at\r\nthe plants as they occur in the islands of the Pacific. There he will\r\nfirst see the stranding of the seeds on a shore by the currents, then\r\ntheir germination and their development into giant-climbers over the\r\nlittoral trees or into straggling bushes on the beach; and afterwards he\r\nwill observe the plants of both species extending inland, and in these\r\nthree stages he will learn their history in the Pacific; but a history,\r\nit may be observed, that in this region represents their efforts to\r\nreturn to an inland station, such as they once possessed in their\r\nbirthplace in some distant region of the globe.\r\n\r\nDealing first with the station of Entada scandens, it may be remarked,\r\nas Dr. Seemann points out, that in Fiji it is most characteristic of the\r\nmangrove-formation. But it also occurs amongst the trees at the back of\r\nthe mangrove swamp, on the beaches, on the banks of the estuaries, and\r\nat the edge of the inland forests where they border on the plains.\r\nSometimes in the company of Derris uliginosa it grows not as a climber,\r\nbut as a prostrate plant on the sandy beaches; and here, not being able\r\nto assume its normal habit of a climber, it does not seed. It is to be\r\nfound at times far inland in open-wooded districts. Thus in Vanua Levu I\r\nfound it growing in the Mbua district four miles inland, and 1,400 feet\r\nabove the sea. Reinecke speaks of it in Samoa only in connection with\r\nthe “urwald,” or primeval forest. Cheeseman describes it as most\r\nabundant in the interior of Rarotonga, covering the trees with a\r\nwide-spreading canopy of green. In the Malayan region Schimper refers to\r\nit as a plant of the beach-tree formation. In Ecuador and on the Panama\r\nIsthmus it grows not only at the coast, but also on the hill-slopes in\r\nthe rear of the mangrove-belt.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the distribution of the plant, it may be remarked\r\nthat, although it is found all round the tropics and possesses great\r\ncapacity for dispersal by currents, there are certain difficulties in\r\nexplaining its wide area and in accounting for its very peculiar\r\ndistribution in the Pacific islands. It was doubtless in allusion to\r\nsome of these difficulties that Mr. Darwin, in a letter to Sir Joseph\r\nHooker, remarked: “Entada is a beast” (_More Letters_, &c., i, 93).\r\nThere is at first the question of the identity of the species in the Old\r\nand New Worlds. It is here assumed that it is the same in both\r\nhemispheres; but it must not be forgotten that the identity is “not\r\nbeyond doubt” (_Bot. Chall. Exped._ iv, 147).\r\n\r\nThen there is the difficulty connected with its occurrence on both\r\ncoasts of tropical America. In this respect it is at one with some other\r\nlittoral plants, like Ipomœa pes capræ, as well as with the plants of\r\nthe mangrove formation, as is pointed out in Chapter VIII. Whilst with\r\nthe mangroves it is necessary to assume that they antedate the land\r\nconnection between North and South America, this is not requisite in the\r\ncase of Entada scandens, since it grows in the interior of the Panama\r\nIsthmus, and rivers on the north and south sides now carry its seeds\r\nseaward from the same “divide” to the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as\r\ndescribed in Chapter XXXII.\r\n\r\nBut, as I have also shown in Chapter VIII, America forms with the West\r\nCoast of Africa a region characterised by the same tropical littoral\r\nflora. This region, on account of the arrangement of the currents,\r\nstands in a very peculiar relation with the Asiatic region, which\r\ncomprises the rest of the tropics, and to a great extent possesses its\r\nown peculiar strand-flora. There are a few littoral plants, like Entada\r\nscandens, Canavalia obtusifolia, Sophora tomentosa, and Ipomœa pes capræ\r\nthat occur in both areas; but the large majority are confined to one or\r\nother of them, either to the American region, including the African West\r\nCoast, or to the Old World region, which includes the African East\r\nCoast. The American region gives to the Old World, but it can receive\r\nnothing in return. For this reason, it is argued, we are compelled to\r\nregard most, if not all, of the cosmopolitan tropical shore plants that\r\nare dispersed by the currents, such as those above named, as having\r\ntheir home in the American region. Entada scandens would, therefore,\r\nfrom this standpoint have its home in America.\r\n\r\nThen, again, there is the difficulty connected with the distribution of\r\nthis plant on both sides of tropical Africa. Though Oliver in his _Flora\r\nof Tropical Africa_ mentions this species only in connection with the\r\nWest Coast, he says it is probably widely spread in that continent, and\r\nhe refers to a pod in the Kew Museum indistinctly labelled “Lake Ngami.”\r\nI have not come upon any reference to its being a littoral plant on the\r\nEast Coast, but since numerous littoral plants of tropical Asia are\r\nfound on that coast its occurrence there or in the East African islands\r\nwould be expected. However, as the genus has a centre in America, and as\r\nthis species is regarded as of American birth, we are not called upon to\r\nemploy the argument used in assigning to a non-American genus like\r\nAfzelia an African home. Since the African West Coast belongs to the\r\nAmerican region of tropical shore plants dispersed by the currents, the\r\npresence of Entada scandens on that coast of Africa can be readily\r\nexplained, whilst if it has reached the Malayan Archipelago from America\r\nby way of the Pacific, it would, by extending like many other Malayan\r\ncoast-plants along the shores of the Indian Ocean, almost complete its\r\ncircuit of the globe. It is in this fashion, I believe, that the other\r\nlittoral plants,, like Cæsalpinia bonducella, Canavalia obtusifolia, and\r\nIpomœa pes capræ, that are found all round the tropics, have performed\r\nthe circuit of the globe with America as their home.\r\n\r\nOne may remark in passing that the double home of the genus in America\r\nand the Old World, though offering a serious difficulty in plant\r\ngeography, has no immediate bearing on the present mode of distribution\r\nof Entada scandens. Questions relating to the distribution of tropical\r\nshore-plants that are dispersed by the currents at first resolve\r\nthemselves into considerations of the arrangement of the currents.\r\nEntada is not alone amongst the genera containing littoral species in\r\nhaving a home both in the Old and in the New World. Carapa is another\r\ninstance, and additional cases might be cited.\r\n\r\nThe next peculiarity in the geographical range of this species is\r\nconcerned with its irregular distribution in the archipelagoes of the\r\ntropical Pacific. Notwithstanding its great capacity for dispersal by\r\nthe currents, although it occurs in all the groups of the Western\r\nPacific as well as in the Cook Islands, it has not been recorded from\r\nthe Society Islands, the Paumotus, the Marquesas, and Hawaii. Since,\r\nhowever, its seeds have been gathered by Mr. Arundel on the beaches of\r\nFlint Island, lying about six degrees north of Tahiti (_Bot. Chall._ iv,\r\n302), it is not unlikely that it will be found growing in other parts of\r\nEastern Polynesia south of the equator. One might have looked for an\r\nexplanation of its rarity in Eastern Polynesia to the absence of\r\nmangrove swamps, in which, as in Fiji, it is sometimes most at home; but\r\nthis is negatived by its abundance in Rarotonga, where mangrove swamps\r\ndo not exist.\r\n\r\n_The dispersal of Entada scandens by the currents._—This plant offers\r\none of the most conspicuous examples of the transport of seeds across\r\noceans through the agency of the currents. In the pages of many\r\nbotanical works, from the close of the 17th century onward, reference is\r\nmade to the transport of its beans (often in association with those of\r\nMucuna urens and Cæsalpinia bonducella) by the Gulf Stream or other\r\ncurrents across the Atlantic to St. Helena, the Azores, the west coast\r\nof Ireland, the Hebrides, the Orkney Islands, the coasts of Scandinavia,\r\nand even as far north as Nova Zembla (see Hemsley’s _Bot. Chall.\r\nExped._; Sernander’s _Skand. Veg. Spridningsbiologi_, &c.). That the\r\nseeds of Entada scandens retain their germinating capacity after this\r\nocean-transport has been demonstrated not only by the germination of\r\nstranded seeds on the shores of St. Helena, but also by the germination\r\nwhen sown at Kew of seeds drifted to the Azores, as well as by the\r\nresults obtained by Lindman, who procured the germination of the seeds\r\nof this plant and of Mucuna urens that had been washed up on the\r\nScandinavian beaches (see Sernander, pp. 7, 390).\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting references to the conveyance by currents of\r\nthese seeds to the coasts of Europe is to be found in Dr. Sernander’s\r\nrecent work on the modes of dispersal of the Scandinavian flora, where\r\nhe sums up the results of Lindman’s investigations respecting the Gulf\r\nStream drift. The stranded seeds of Entada scandens, it appears, have\r\nbeen found all along the Norwegian coast, but occur most frequently\r\nnorth of the Söndmöre district. They have even been found in a\r\nsub-fossil condition in the peat-bogs of Tjörn on the Bohuslän coast in\r\nSweden, having been originally stranded on a beach in that locality at\r\nsome distant, but post-glacial, epoch. Few phenomena in\r\nplant-distribution are more suggestive than this ineffectual transport\r\nthrough the ages of these large tropical beans to coasts within the\r\nArctic Circle. The seed, no longer under the care of the mother-plant,\r\nbecomes a waif, exposed to the pitiless laws of the physical world which\r\nhere prevail. It was not thus that the plant was reared, but it is in\r\nthis haphazard fashion that its seeds are spread. The philosopher could\r\nunravel most of the tangled problems connected with present and past\r\nplant-dispersal, if he could follow the clue supplied by this stranded\r\ntropical seed on a Scandinavian beach.\r\n\r\nIt is a far jump from the North Cape to the coral islands of the Pacific\r\nand Indian Oceans; yet it is within the area covered by the drifting\r\nEntada bean. The stranded seeds occur commonly on the Fijian beaches and\r\non other islands of the South Pacific; but I never found them in Hawaii.\r\nThey were gathered by me on the shores of Keeling Atoll in the Indian\r\nOcean, and on the south coast of Java. Penzig found on the Krakatoa\r\nbeaches, in 1897, not only the stranded seed but the established plant.\r\nThey came under my notice in numbers on the beaches of Ecuador and on\r\nthe Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the Panama Isthmus; and, as I\r\nlearned, they are equally common on the other parts of the coasts of\r\nCentral America. Not uncommonly these stranded seeds in various parts of\r\nthe world are to be found incrusted with polyzoa and tubicular annelids,\r\nwhich afford proof of prolonged flotation in the sea. These seeds are\r\nalso to be frequently noticed floating in the drift of the tropical\r\nestuaries. Thus they came under my observation afloat in numbers in the\r\nFijian estuaries, in the Guayaquil river, in the estuary of the Chagres\r\nat Colon, and in the mouth of a river on the Panama side of the isthmus.\r\n\r\nThe mode of liberation of the seeds is worthy of a passing remark. The\r\nhuge pods, often several feet in length, ultimately break up into\r\nseparate joints bearing the seeds. The joints may decay on the ground,\r\nand the seeds are thus freed; or not infrequently in a mangrove-swamp\r\nthey fall at once into the water, and there they float, as may often be\r\nobserved in Fijian rivers, until their decay sets free the seed.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of Entada scandens are often quoted, and justly so, as\r\nstriking examples of the dispersal of seeds by currents. Yet in few\r\nplants could the nature or the structural cause of the buoyancy have so\r\nlittle claim to be considered as adaptive in its character. Quite half,\r\nand sometimes even the majority, of the seeds freshly liberated from the\r\nplant have no buoyancy at all. The mean specific weight of the seed is\r\nabout that of sea-water, but markedly higher than that of fresh water;\r\nwhilst the principal determining cause of the buoyancy is, as shown\r\nbelow, purely mechanical, and one that, whilst favouring the wide\r\ndistribution of the species, could not be improved by or come within the\r\nscope of Natural Selection.\r\n\r\nFrom experiments made in Fiji and Ecuador, it appears that at least 50\r\nper cent., and often more than half, of the seeds when first liberated\r\nfrom the pod have no buoyancy in sea-water. Of those that float in\r\nsea-water, a proportion varying between one-third and one-half sink in\r\nfresh water, so that in the case of plants growing on the banks of a\r\nriver only about one-fourth or one-third would be carried down to the\r\nsea. So fine is the adjustment of the specific weight of these seeds to\r\nthe density of water, a subject discussed in its general bearings in\r\nChapter X, that if one gathers a number of drift seeds on a beach, let\r\nit be in Fiji or in Ecuador, although, of course, all will float in the\r\nsea, only one-half or two-thirds will float in the neighbouring\r\nfresh-water stream. Those that float appear to be able to float almost\r\nindefinitely. This is sufficiently established by the transport of the\r\nseeds in a sound condition by the currents across the Atlantic, and by\r\nsuch evidence as the stranding of seeds incrusted with polyzoa and\r\nserpulæ on the beaches of Keeling Atoll. It has been also proved by the\r\nfollowing experiment. Several years since, I placed a seed in a vessel\r\nof sea-water, where it still floated buoyantly in a perfectly sound\r\ncondition twelve months afterwards.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the cause of the buoyancy, investigation shows that\r\nneither the seed tests nor the seed contents have any floating power,\r\nthe buoyancy arising from a large central cavity produced by the\r\nshrinking and bending outward of the cotyledons during the drying and\r\nhardening of the maturing seed (see figure in Chapter XII). With the\r\nseeds that sink, this cavity is, as a rule, reduced to small dimensions,\r\nand may be represented only by a narrow slit. In some cases, however,\r\nwhere the cotyledons are unusually thick and heavy, even a large central\r\ncavity will not give floating power to the seed. There is an indication\r\nin my experiments that seeds from inland plants that have matured their\r\npods in the forests sink in a much greater proportion than seeds of\r\ncoast plants, or of those growing on the banks of estuaries. This we\r\nmight expect, since in the shade of the forests the drying process that\r\naccompanies the setting and final maturation of the seed would be less\r\ncomplete and the intercotyledonary cavity smaller than with the seeds\r\nmatured in more exposed situations. This is a point, however, that\r\nrequires further investigation.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that in respect of buoyancy the seeds of Entada\r\nscandens are to be referred to the mechanical or non-adaptive group of\r\nbuoyant seeds, described in Chapter XII, which comprises several other\r\nLeguminous strand-plants, including Cæsalpinia bonducella. I especially\r\nstudied the various stages in the development of the buoyancy of seeds\r\nin this mechanical group in the case of the species of Cæsalpinia just\r\nnamed, and the description of the process as given under that plant will\r\napply to all.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Summary relating to Entada scandens_\r\n\r\n(1) This plant, which has been distributed by the currents over the\r\ntropics of the globe, has its station in the mangrove swamp, on the\r\nbeach, by the estuary, and in the inland forest.\r\n\r\n(2) It is regarded as an American plant that has reached the shores of\r\nthe Indian Ocean by crossing the Pacific, and the coast of West Africa\r\nby crossing the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n(3) Its occurrence on both coasts of America is attributed to its having\r\na focus of dispersal in the forests of Central America, from which its\r\nseeds have been transported by the rivers to the shores of the Atlantic\r\nand Pacific Oceans.\r\n\r\n(4) Its irregular distribution in the Pacific islands, to wit, its\r\nabsence from Hawaii and its rarity in the Tahitian region, is not to be\r\neasily explained, but it is more than likely that it will be\r\nsubsequently recorded from other localities in Eastern Polynesia.\r\n\r\n(5) Although the seeds offer a striking example of dispersal by\r\ncurrents, since they are to be found stranded on beaches over much of\r\nthe globe, from within the Arctic Circle to the Coral Sea, in few plants\r\ncould the character of the buoyancy and the structure connected with it\r\nhave so little claim to be considered as adaptive in their nature. At\r\nleast 50 per cent. of the seeds sink in sea-water, and the cause of the\r\nbuoyancy of the other seeds is only to be connected with the large size\r\nof a cavity produced by the shrinking of the embryo within the seed\r\ntests during maturation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CÆSALPINIA\r\n\r\nThis genus is represented in the tropics of both the Old and the New\r\nWorld by some eighty species of trees, shrubs, and climbers, some of\r\nwhich are noted for their dye-woods, and others for the beauty of their\r\nflowers. In the Pacific islands the botanist is only concerned with\r\nthree widely distributed species, all more or less littoral in their\r\nstation, and in great part dispersed by the currents, namely, Cæsalpinia\r\nnuga (Ait.), C. bonducella (Flem.), and C. bonduc (Roxb.).\r\n\r\nWith Cæsalpinia nuga we have little to do, since, although widely\r\ndistributed in tropical Asia and the Malayan region, and reaching to\r\nboth New Guinea and North Australia, it has not apparently penetrated\r\ninto the Pacific further east than the Solomon and New Hebrides groups.\r\nI found it growing on the coasts of the larger islands of the Solomon\r\ngroup, but no observations were made on its mode of dispersal. However,\r\nas its seeds were identified at Kew (_Bot. Chall. Exped._ iv, 311)\r\namongst my collections of stranded drift from those islands, it would\r\nappear to be to some degree dispersed by the currents, though since it\r\ndoes not extend far into the Pacific, its capacity for dispersal by this\r\nagency would seem to be limited. Schimper includes it among the\r\nstrand-plants of the Indo-Malayan region.\r\n\r\nIt is with the other two species, Cæsalpinia bonducella and C. bonduc\r\nthat we are especially interested. Their extremely hard, marble-like\r\nseeds at once attract attention, and when pale in colour they look not\r\nunlike quartz pebbles as they lie stranded on a beach. The prickly pods\r\nand the recurved prickles of the leaf-branches often make these plants\r\nprovokingly evident to a stranger. Though usually to be characterised\r\nwhen growing on a beach as straggling shrubs, they will often climb\r\ntrees when opportunities occur, and they then display themselves as\r\nstout-stemmed climbers. I have seen one or other of them in the mangrove\r\nswamps of Fiji ascending the Bruguiera trees to a height of 30 feet and\r\nmore, the stem quite bare below, but leafing and flowering in the\r\ntree-branches above.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of dispersal there are few more interesting plants\r\nin the Pacific islands; but their discussion raises several difficult\r\nquestions, and it will be, therefore, requisite to treat them somewhat\r\nin detail. With regard first to the diagnostic characters between the\r\nspecies, it may be observed that, as a rule, they are sufficiently\r\nevident, such, for instance, as the number, size, and form of the\r\nleaflets, the presence or absence of foliaceous stipules, and the colour\r\nof the seeds, though, as shown below, the seed-colour in the case of\r\nFijian plants does not always present a constant distinction. Yet as I\r\nfound in Fiji the difference between the two species is not in all cases\r\nwell pronounced, and intermediate forms occur, about which it is\r\nsometimes difficult to decide to which of the two species they should be\r\nassigned.\r\n\r\nMr. Hemsley remarks (_Bot. Chall. Exped._ iii, 114, 145, 300) that the\r\ntwo species have been often confused. I venture to think that this has\r\nbeen in some cases due to the occurrence of these intermediate forms.\r\nOne has only to look at the different “distributions” given by botanists\r\nfor C. bonduc, as indicated below, in order to suspect that the cause of\r\nconfusion has been at times with the plants themselves. When in Fiji I\r\npaid a good deal of attention to this subject, and the results of the\r\ncomparison of the foliage and seeds of the plants obtained from fourteen\r\ndifferent localities in Vanua Levu are given below.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen in this table that I distinguish in Fiji three littoral\r\nforms and one inland or mountain variety, which may perhaps be a\r\ndistinct species. Those of the strand include Cæsalpinia bonducella, C.\r\nbonduc, and an intermediate form. C. bonduc is typically distinguished\r\nby its large leaflets, by the absence of foliaceous stipules, and by its\r\npale yellow seeds; whilst C. bonducella is similarly characterised by\r\nits small leaflets, its foliaceous stipules, and its lead-coloured or\r\ndarkish grey seeds. But in the first species the colour of the seeds may\r\noften be yellow mixed with pale-grey, or almost white; whilst in the\r\nsecond species the seeds may be stained with brownish-yellow patches.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me when examining fresh specimens in Hawaii and Fiji that\r\nthe ultimate colour of the seed is a good deal determined by the degree\r\nof alteration of the original olive-green colour of the immature seed.\r\nAll gradations may be noticed from the olive-green of immaturity to the\r\nyellow, pale grey, and dirty white hues of the mature seeds of\r\nCæsalpinia bonduc and to the lead or slate-colour of those of C.\r\nbonducella. It almost appeared as if the changes might be compared to\r\nthe bleaching which a dark volcanic rock undergoes in the weathering\r\nprocess through the hydration and removal of the iron oxides.\r\n\r\n\r\n                CÆSALPINIA IN FIJI, TAHITI, AND HAWAII.\r\n\r\n A = Locality.\r\n B = Species.\r\n C = Foliaceous stipules.\r\n D = Pairs of pinnæ.\r\n E = Leaflets—Pairs.\r\n F - Leaflets—Length in inches.\r\n G = Leaflets—Form.\r\n H = Seeds—Size in tenths of inch.\r\n I = Seeds—Colour\r\n\r\n +--------+---------------+--------+------+------+-------------+-------------------+-------------+----------------------+\r\n |  A     |     B         |   C    |   D  |   E  |      F      |       G           |      8      |        9             |\r\n +--------+---------------+--------+------+------+-------------+-------------------+-------------+----------------------+\r\n |       {| Bonducella    |Present |  8-9 | 9-11 |1-1/4 - 1-1/2| Oblong, obtuse    |6-1/2 - 7-1/2| Usually lead-        |\r\n |       {|               |        |      |      |             | mucronate: base   |             | colour with at       |\r\n |       {|               |        |      |      |             | rounded and in—   |             | times brownish-      |\r\n |       {|               |        |      |      |             | equilateral       |             | yellow patches.      |\r\n |       {|               |        |      |      |             |                   |             |                      |\r\n |Coast, {| Bonduc        |Absent  |  5-6 |  4-6 |  2-1/2 - 5  | Oblong, acuminate | 5-1/2 - 6   | Pale yellow          |\r\n |Fiji   {|               |        |      |      |             | mucronate, base   |             |                      |\r\n |       {|               |        |      |      |             | rounded or        |6-1/2 - 7-1/2| Pale grey, sometimes |\r\n |       {|               |        |      |      |             | subcordate        |             | mixed with           |\r\n |       {|               |        |      |      |             |                   |             | yellow.              |\r\n |       {|               |        |      |      |             |                   |             |                      |\r\n |       {| Intermediate  |Present |  7-8 |  7-9 |    2-3      | Oblong, obtuse    | 6-7         | Lead-colour or       |\r\n |        |               |        |      |      |             | mucronate, rounded|             | pale grey with       |\r\n |        |               |        |      |      |             | at base;

Drake del Castillo is quoted for Tahiti, and Hillebrand\r\n  for Hawaii. Reinecke observes that the pods of C. bonducella in the\r\n  inland forests have no prickles.\r\n\r\nIn Fiji all three coast forms may be found on the same beach, or they\r\nmay exist apart. The large-leaved species (C. bonduc) appears to be much\r\nthe most frequent in Vanua Levu; and the intermediate form is common\r\nenough to disturb the serenity of the observer’s mind when he is anxious\r\nto diagnose rather than to collect cumbersome specimens. The mountain\r\nform, which came under my notice as a climber in the forest at an\r\nelevation of 1,700 feet on the slopes of Koro-mbasanga in Vanua Levu,\r\nacquires from the lanceolate shape of its leaflets quite a character of\r\nits own, though it comes nearest to Cæsalpinia bonducella. Mountain\r\nforms also occur, as indicated in a later page, in the forests of Samoa\r\nand in Tahiti; but in the first-named group they are referred by\r\nReinecke to C. bonducella, and in Tahiti by Drake del Castillo to C.\r\nbonduc. In the Samoan forests the inland plants possess pods deprived of\r\nthe prickles that are so characteristic of the beach plants. Before one\r\ncan pronounce definitely on the relation between the coast and inland\r\nforms in any of the groups, a thorough investigation of the connections\r\nbetween the two shore-species is needed. I am inclined to think that\r\nthey will prove to belong to a single dimorphic (or perhaps polymorphic)\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n_The distribution of Cæsalpinia bonducella and C. bonduc._—Botanists\r\nagree in giving C. bonducella a distribution around the tropics of the\r\nglobe; but they are not at all unanimous with respect to the other\r\nspecies. According to Mr. Hemsley this species is by no means so\r\nuniversally dispersed as C. bonducella. It is unknown from Africa and\r\nAustralia; but it is generally characteristic of tropical Asia and the\r\nMalay Archipelago. The same authority alludes to specimens in the Kew\r\nHerbarium from Florida and the West Indies (_Bot. Chall._ iv, 300).\r\nDrake del Castillo gives both species a range through the tropics,\r\nwhilst Schimper seems in doubt about the occurrence of C. bonduc in the\r\nNew World, and Mr. Burkill makes no allusion to its American habitat in\r\nhis paper on the Tongan flora. The cause of this confusion is doubtless\r\nto be mainly attributed to the variation in characters of the plants,\r\nand to the occurrence of intermediate forms.\r\n\r\nWe should be scarcely consistent if we assumed that of two kindred\r\nshore-species dispersed by the currents one had its home in America and\r\nthe other in the Old World. The same home must belong to both. According\r\nto the principle laid down in Chapter VIII, and referred to under Entada\r\nscandens, it is held that a strand-plant, with its home in Asia, on\r\naccount of the arrangement of the currents could never reach the\r\nAmerican continent, and that American shore-plants are for the most part\r\nnative-born except those hailing from the African West Coast, which,\r\nhowever, lies within the American province of tropical strand-plants.\r\nFrom this standpoint Cæsalpinia bonducella would be regarded as now\r\nhaving its home in the New World, and since it is found on both the\r\nPacific and Atlantic coasts of that continent (as well as on both coasts\r\nof Africa), it is assumed, as with Entada scandens, that it has reached\r\nthe African West Coast by crossing the Atlantic, and the African East\r\nCoast by way of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The genus, I may remark,\r\nis distributed over the tropics of the eastern and western hemispheres.\r\n\r\nAs regards the general distribution of the two species in the Pacific\r\nislands, it would appear from the writings of Seemann, Hillebrand,\r\nHemsley, Drake del Castillo, Reinecke, Cheeseman, and Burkill that with\r\nthe exception of Hawaii and Samoa, where Cæsalpinia bonducella alone\r\noccurs, and of Rarotonga where C. bonduc alone is found, they are\r\ngenerally associated in the larger groups, as in Fiji, Tonga, Tahiti,\r\nand the Marquesas.\r\n\r\n_The station of Cæsalpinia bonducella and C. bonduc._—Both the species\r\nare to be regarded as littoral plants likely to stray inland. The\r\nfirst-named is described in the _Botany of the “Challenger” Expedition_\r\nas essentially a sea-side plant, though flourishing equally well inland,\r\nand in India extending to the Himalayas as far as Kumaon, and up to\r\nelevations of 2,500 feet. Schimper speaks of both species as\r\ncharacteristic of the Indo-Malayan strand-flora, and he quotes Kurz when\r\nreferring to C. bonduc as a constituent of the beach-jungle of Pegu.\r\n\r\nIn the Pacific islands they are typically littoral in their station; but\r\nthey may extend inland, and in one or two groups they are only known in\r\ntheir inland station. Dr. Seemann speaks of both species only in\r\nconnection with the beaches in Fiji, and alludes to Cæsalpinia\r\nbonducella (p. 72) as sometimes climbing over the mangroves. In Vanua\r\nLevu both came under my notice on the beaches, and in their immediate\r\nvicinity, usually as straggling bushes, whilst at times they were to be\r\nobserved climbing the mangroves at the borders of the adjacent swamp. In\r\nthis island of the Fijis they do not, as a rule, stray far from the\r\nbeach, and strange to say are not to be ranked amongst those seashore\r\nplants that frequent the “talasinga” regions or inland plains. Judging\r\nfrom the mountain form found in the forests of Koro-mbasanga, if they\r\nextend inland in Fiji they prefer the forests and become differentiated\r\nin character. In Tahiti, as we learn from Nadeaud and Drake del\r\nCastillo, C. bonducella occurs on the beach and extends inland to the\r\nmouths of the valleys; whilst C. bonduc is only recorded from the\r\nmountains at elevations of 600 to 700 metres (2,000 to 2,300 feet).\r\nJouan is quoted by Mr. Hemsley as remarking that C. bonduc is as common\r\nin the Marquesas as brambles are in Europe (_Bot. Chall. Exped._ iii,\r\n145). In Rarotonga, according to Cheeseman, C. bonduc is restricted to\r\nthe interior. In Samoa, as we are informed by Reinecke, C. bonducella is\r\nfrequent both in the coast districts and in the mountain-forests. In the\r\nSamoan mountains the pods lose their prickles, and from this\r\ncircumstance, as well as from the extremely widespread distribution of\r\nthe species over the islands, the German botanist concludes that the\r\nplant has been for ages established in the group.\r\n\r\nIn Hawaii, Cæsalpinia bonducella, which alone occurs, rarely figures as\r\na beach plant; but it is found, as Hillebrand observes, in the lower\r\nplains of all the islands. In the large island of Hawaii I found it not\r\non the scanty beaches of the coast, but on the partly vegetated surface\r\nof the old lava-flows at distances varying usually between a hundred\r\nyards and a mile from the sea, but extending at times a few miles\r\ninland, and in one locality reaching an elevation of 2,000 feet above\r\nthe sea. It was mostly observed by me on the dry side of the island,\r\nwhere, associated with Erythrina monosperma, the Cactus, and the\r\nCastor-Oil plant, it thrives in very arid localities, where the rainfall\r\nis only a few inches in the year. Farther inland, where the old\r\nlava-surfaces were more vegetated, it was associated with such shrubs as\r\nOsteomeles anthyllidifolia and Cyathodes tameiameiæ. Dr. Hillebrand,\r\nwriting of a generation and more ago, says that in his time the plant\r\nwas less common than formerly.\r\n\r\n_The Methods of Dispersal of Cæsalpinia bonducella and C. bonduc._—We\r\ncome now to the modes of dispersal of these plants; and in so doing we\r\nhave to choose between the agencies of birds and of currents. The seeds\r\nof C. bonducella are on the average 7/10 of an inch (18 mm.) in\r\ndiameter, whilst those of C. bonduc are rather smaller (6/10 of an inch\r\nor 15 mm.). As far as their size and character go, it would seem\r\nscarcely likely that birds could transport these seeds across an ocean;\r\nbut our knowledge of the agency of birds is of a very imperfect nature.\r\nYet their occasional dispersal by birds is not improbable. When I was in\r\nthe Keeling Islands the residents informed me that the seeds of C.\r\nbonducella are sometimes found in the stomachs of sea-birds, such as\r\nfrigate-birds and boobies. (See Note 59.)\r\n\r\nHowever, it has long been known that the seeds of one or both of these\r\nspecies are carried great distances by the currents; but it is to be\r\ngathered that the older botanists, in alluding to this fact, more\r\nusually referred under the synonym of Guilandina bonduc to Cæsalpinia\r\nbonducella. De Candolle, loth to attach much importance to the effective\r\ntransport of seeds by currents, was compelled to admit this species in\r\nhis scanty list of current-dispersed plants (see Note 33). For more than\r\ntwo centuries it has been known that the seeds of C. bonducella are\r\ncarried in the Gulf Stream drift to the coast of Europe from the\r\nAmerican side of the Atlantic; and ever since they were recorded by\r\nSloane in 1696 as stranded in a fresh condition on the beaches of the\r\nOrkney Islands, they have been found washed up on other localities, as\r\non the coasts of Ireland and of Scandinavia and on the shores of the\r\nislands of the Western Atlantic. According to Robert Brown, a plant was\r\nraised from a seed cast up on the west coast of Ireland; and with\r\nrespect to Scandinavia, Dr. Sernander informs us that the seeds of\r\nCæsalpinia bonducella, like those of Entada scandens and of Mucuna\r\nurens, are of frequent occurrence amongst the “Gulf Stream products”\r\nstranded on the Norwegian coasts. The seeds of this species are commonly\r\nwashed ashore at St. Helena, and there are specimens in the Kew Museum\r\nthat were stranded on Tristan da Cunha. (Those interested in the subject\r\nwill find it discussed by Mr. Hemsley in the _Botany of the “Challenger”\r\nExpedition_, and also by Dr. Sernander in his recent work on\r\nScandinavia.)\r\n\r\nThe seeds of Cæsalpinia bonducella have been also found stranded on\r\nbeaches in other parts of the world. Thus Prof. Schimper found them in\r\nthe beach-drift of the south coast of Java. Prof. Penzig noticed them\r\namongst the stranded seeds of the Krakatoa beaches; but it does not\r\nappear that the plant had established itself up to the date of his visit\r\nin 1897, or fourteen years after the great eruption. They have been\r\npicked up on the other side of the Indian Ocean on the east shores of\r\nAfrica (_Bot. Chall. Exped._ iv, 300). They came frequently under my\r\nnotice stranded on the beaches of Keeling Atoll in the same ocean; and\r\nseedlings sprouting from the seeds were sometimes to be seen growing\r\namongst the drift just above the high-tide level. The seeds of both C.\r\nbonducella and C. bonduc have been found also on the shores of Jamaica.\r\nThose of both species are not uncommon amongst the stranded drift of the\r\nFijian beaches; but notwithstanding a careful search I found only a\r\nsolitary seed of C. bonducella in the Hawaiian beach-drift, a\r\ncircumstance explained below as arising from the usual non-buoyancy of\r\nHawaiian seeds.\r\n\r\nThat the seeds of Cæsalpinia bonducella stranded on the coasts of an\r\noceanic island are able to germinate and reproduce the plant is, of\r\ncourse, established by the distribution of the species; and we have just\r\nobserved that the process was noticed by the author on Keeling Atoll\r\nwhere the plant has found a home. It is to be noted that the plant\r\ncollected by Darwin in this atoll was identified by Prof. Henslow as C.\r\nbonduc; but the plant observed by me was more like C. bonducella, and\r\nthe stranded seeds collected by me were referred at Kew to this species.\r\nSome curious considerations arise from the fact that although, just as\r\nin the Keeling Islands, the plants of C. bonducella have evidently\r\nestablished themselves from drift seed in one locality in the Bermudas,\r\nthey do not seem to have done so either on the shores of Krakatoa, or of\r\nSt. Helena, where, although they are frequently washed ashore, Mr.\r\nMelliss never met with an instance of germination (see _Bot. Chall.\r\nExped._ iv, 300, and Penzig). This is doubtless in part the result of\r\nthe destructive efforts of the crabs, which, as I have shown in my paper\r\non Keeling Atoll, nibble off the shoots of many germinating seeds in\r\nbeach drift.\r\n\r\nThe readiness or non-readiness of seeds to germinate on a beach, and the\r\nnature of the conditions essential for the process, are matters that are\r\ndirectly concerned with their effective dispersal by currents. On\r\naccount of the stony character of the seeds of these two species, it\r\nmight be expected that germination would only take place under\r\nexceptional conditions. It should, however, be observed that the fine\r\ntransverse striæ on their outer surface represent original fissures or\r\ncracks in the epidermis of the soft immature seed; and as such may be\r\nregarded as lines of weakness in the seed-tests. If a pod is opened\r\nbefore the seeds are mature, we find the seeds about twice the size of\r\nmaturity, and so soft that they can be indented by the nail. The\r\ntransverse striæ that mark the mature seed are displayed as indistinct\r\ncracks in the epidermis; and if the immature seed is exposed to the sun,\r\nin a few hours these cracks gape widely, and the seed has the grooved\r\nappearance of a top. If a pod opens prematurely on a plant, as sometimes\r\nhappens, the immature seeds will be noticed with the epidermis scaling\r\noff. It is evident that the “setting” or the induration of the\r\nseed-coats and the final great contraction of the seed take place in the\r\npod before dehiscence. From these remarks it would seem probable that\r\nseeds lying exposed to the fierce rays of the sun on a tropical beach\r\nwould be liable to develop cracks along the old fissures, and that such\r\ncracks by permitting the entrance of moisture would favour germination.\r\n\r\nMy experiments show that high temperature under moist conditions will\r\nnot of itself induce germination or in any way affect the seed. Thus in\r\ntwo sets of experiments, in 1890 and 1902, I failed to induce the\r\ngermination of seeds which, after floating a year in sea-water, were\r\nkept in moist soil at a high temperature. In one case a temperature\r\nvarying from 80° to 110° F. was sustained for several weeks, and in the\r\nother experiment a temperature of 80° to 90° was kept up for five\r\nmonths. When, however, an incision was made into the epidermis, or the\r\nseed-coats were partially penetrated with a file, the seeds swelled up\r\nin a day or two, and in a few days began to germinate.\r\n\r\nThe rapid transformation of the stone-like seed into a softened,\r\nswollen, germinating mass ranks amongst the numerous little wonders of\r\nthe plant world. The seed, in fact, assumes again the appearance of\r\nimmaturity, and in so doing it suggests to us that the rest-stage\r\nexemplified in the hard, pebble-like seed is but an adaptation to\r\ngeneral climatic conditions, and that in a region of great heat and\r\nhumidity, where there are no seasons, and where the sun’s rays are for\r\never screened off by mist and cloud, it could be dispensed with\r\naltogether. One of my Hawaiian dreams was to establish vivipary in\r\nCæsalpinia bonducella by subjecting the maturing pod on the plant to\r\nvery warm and humid conditions, my expectation being that the soft,\r\nswollen seed would at once proceed to germinate in the pod, and that the\r\nfinal process of setting, as indicated by the induration and contraction\r\nof the coats, or in other words the rest-stage, would be done away with.\r\nThe dream, however, bore some fruits in enlarging my standpoint in the\r\nmatter of vivipary, and I have referred to the subject in Chapter XXXI.\r\n\r\nThe seed-shell, about 1·5 mm. in thickness, consists of three coats: the\r\nouter skin very tough and waterproof; the inner skin seemingly\r\npermeable; and the intermediate layer of hard prismatic tissue, the\r\n“prismenschicht” of Schimper (p. 164). This middle layer absorbs water\r\nrapidly and in large quantity, so that if a fragment of the shell is\r\nplaced in water it will be found after a day’s soaking to be three times\r\nas thick as it was in the dry state. If one files a seed, or makes a\r\nsmall incision, so as to expose the middle layer without piercing the\r\ninner coat, and then places it in water, it will be noticed that the\r\nmiddle layer at once begins to absorb water; and within a couple of days\r\nthe whole seed will swell and attain the size it possessed in the\r\nso-called immature condition. During the process the outer skin\r\nstretches, usually without rupturing; and all three coats, previously so\r\nhard that a heavy blow with a hammer is required to break the seed,\r\nbecome in a day or two soft enough to be easily cut with a knife. The\r\nseeds thus treated swell in two days to three times their original size\r\nand increase their weight fourfold. Water finds its way to the nucleus\r\nor embryo partly through the dilated inner opening of the micropylar\r\npassage and partly through the inner skin. The nucleus then swells up\r\ninto a fleshy mass, filling the seed-cavity, and in two or three days\r\nmore germination begins.\r\n\r\nI pass now to the discussion of the buoyancy of the seeds. Considering\r\nthat both species occur in oceanic islands, and that the currents are\r\nactive agents in transporting the seeds, their behaviour under\r\nexperiment appears at first sight to be full of anomalies. Thus, it was\r\nascertained at Kew (_Bot. Chall. Exped._ iv., 301), both with\r\ncomparatively fresh and with older seeds, that those of Cæsalpinia\r\nbonducella floated in salt water, whilst those of C. bonduc sank; but in\r\nthe record given of the experiment no mention is made of the original\r\nstation of the parent plants; and it will be shown later on that the\r\nstation of the plant, whether at the coast or inland, has an important\r\ndetermining influence on the buoyancy.\r\n\r\nIn Fiji I found that almost without exception the seeds of littoral\r\nplants of Cæsalpinia bonducella floated both in sea-water and in fresh\r\nwater. On the other hand, in Hawaii the seeds of this species, obtained\r\nfrom three typical localities removed inland from the beach, sank\r\nwithout exception, even after drying for several months; and the only\r\nbuoyant seed noted in these islands was a solitary seed collected from\r\nthe beach drift. In Hawaii, however, as before remarked, the species is\r\nnot strictly a littoral plant, occurring as it does in the lower levels,\r\nbut not necessarily in the vicinity of the coast. In the case of seeds\r\nof littoral plants of C. bonduc in Fiji, I found that sometimes all\r\nfloated in sea-water and sometimes only a portion of them, whilst their\r\nspecific weight was on the whole rather greater than that of the seeds\r\nof the other species. Thus, in one experiment half the seeds floated in\r\nsea-water and a quarter in fresh water, whilst with seeds from another\r\nlocality 90 per cent. of the seeds floated in sea-water and 80 per cent.\r\nin fresh-water; and in a third set of seeds all floated in both waters.\r\n\r\nThe above experiments on Fijian seeds all relate to littoral plants. In\r\nthe instance, however, of the inland species from the mountains of Vanua\r\nLevu, all the seeds sank in sea-water, even after being kept for five\r\nyears. If we follow the indications of these several experiments we\r\nshall find that Cæsalpinia presents another illustration of the general\r\nprinciple established in Chapter II that the seeds of inland plants sink\r\nand those of coast plants float.\r\n\r\nMy data, therefore, show that with the seeds of Cæsalpinia buoyancy goes\r\nwith station and not necessarily with species. It is probable,\r\ntherefore, that with the two widespread species, C. bonducella and C.\r\nbonduc, varying results will be obtained with seeds from different\r\nlocalities, whether insular or continental, according to the original\r\nstation. The typically buoyant seeds of the former species may, as we\r\nhave seen in Hawaii, lose their floating powers when they grow inland;\r\nand the seeds of an inland species from the mountains of Fiji sink at\r\nonce. It is essential in interpreting the results of experiments on the\r\nseeds of these plants to be acquainted with the stations; and in this\r\nrespect those of the Tahitian plants may be regarded as probable test\r\ncases. We have seen that in Tahiti, C. bonduc is an inland plant, and C.\r\nbonducella usually a beach plant; and I have no doubt that experiments\r\nin that island on the seeds of these two species from the particular\r\nstations just referred to will give results in agreement with the\r\nprinciple here laid down.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the duration of the floating powers of these seeds it\r\nmay be observed that a seed of Cæsalpinia bonducella, originally found\r\nstranded on the beaches of Keeling Atoll, floated after a year in\r\nsea-water as buoyantly as at the commencement of the experiment. Seeds\r\nof Fijian littoral plants of both C. bonducella and C. bonduc floated in\r\nmy experiments after two and a half years’ immersion in sea-water,\r\nshowing no change whatever. Some of the seeds removed at the end of the\r\nfirst year were filed and placed in soil, when they germinated\r\nhealthily. In Chapter IX it is pointed out that some buoyant seeds of\r\nother Leguminous plants, such as Mucuna urens, would be apt to germinate\r\nabortively and to sink in crossing the more heated areas of tropical\r\nseas. The seeds of Cæsalpinia, judging from my experiments and\r\nobservations noted on page 84, seem to be quite proof against such\r\nrisks. This was well brought out in an experiment where seeds of the two\r\nspecies of Cæsalpinia were kept afloat for two and a half years in a\r\nvessel of sea-water together with seeds of Mucuna and Strongylodon. None\r\nof the Cæsalpinia seeds attempted to germinate in the sea-water; but\r\nwith the other genera some of the seeds began to germinate, and sank in\r\nthe course of the first warm season, when the water-temperature ranged\r\nfrom 75 to 90° Fahr.\r\n\r\nThe seeds develop their buoyancy during the great contraction that, as\r\nbefore described, marks the final setting of the seed-coats and the\r\nultimate maturation, as it is termed, of the seed. During this shrinking\r\nprocess the kernel also shrinks within the seed-tests, and cavities are\r\nthus produced within the seed-shell, on the relative size of which\r\ndepends the buoyancy of the seed, neither the seed-shell nor the kernel\r\npossessing independent floating-power. These cavities, as illustrated in\r\nthe figures given in Chapter XII, are of two kinds. That usually\r\nproduced, being the one that mainly determines the buoyancy, is a large\r\ncentral hollow caused by the arching outwards of the cotyledons during\r\nthe shrinking process, such as is found also in the seeds of Entada\r\nscandens, Mucuna urens, and some other Leguminous littoral plants. With\r\nsuch seeds the kernel never rattles when the seed is shaken, since the\r\ncotyledons lie in close contact with the seed-shell. The other kind of\r\ncavity is produced between the seed-shell and the kernel by the general\r\nor partial shrinking of the kernel away from the shell, the cotyledons\r\nremaining in apposition, as shown in the figures. When the shrinking\r\naway from the shell is general, the kernel lies loose within the shell,\r\nand the seed rattles when shaken. When the shrinking is partial the\r\ncavity is on one side of the seed and the kernel is fixed.\r\n\r\nProfessor Schimper (p. 164) remarks that the buoyant seeds of Cæsalpinia\r\nbonducella all rattle when shaken, and that it is to the incomplete\r\nfilling of the seed-cavity, thus indicated by the loose kernels, that\r\nthe buoyancy of the seed is due. The rattling of the kernel was,\r\nhowever, quite exceptional in the seeds handled by me, even in the case\r\nof originally buoyant seeds kept for five years. Seeds with loose\r\nkernels were, in fact, more frequent with non-buoyant seeds than with\r\nthose that floated. Thus in Fiji I found that whilst with the buoyant\r\nseeds 17 to 20 per cent. had loose kernels, with non-buoyant seeds the\r\nproportion was as much as 60 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe normal cause of buoyancy is, therefore, a large intercotyledonary\r\ncavity with the cotyledons lying in close contact with the seed-shell;\r\nbut the two kinds of cavity may sometimes be combined. Out of a number\r\nof buoyant seeds of Cæsalpinia bonducella examined by me, 80 per cent.\r\nowed their buoyancy solely to a large central cavity (4 to 5 mm.\r\nacross). In 6 per cent. it was due solely to the shrinking of the kernel\r\naway from the seed-shell; whilst in 14 per cent. it was to be attributed\r\npartly to a reduced central cavity (2 to 3 mm. wide), and partly to a\r\nspace outside the kernel. The only difference noted in the structure of\r\nthe buoyant seeds of C. bonduc was that the two kinds of cavities were\r\nmore often combined.\r\n\r\nThe reason of the absence of floating power was clearly indicated in the\r\nnon-buoyant Hawaiian seeds, where there was no central cavity, or it was\r\nrepresented by a narrow slit. The solitary buoyant seed found in the\r\nbeach drift had a typical large central cavity. With the non-buoyant\r\nseeds of the inland species of the mountains of Vanua Levu it was\r\nascertained that two-thirds had loose kernels with the cotyledons\r\nclosely appressed. In the others there was a lateral cavity outside the\r\nkernel, the central cavity being only represented by a slit, a hair’s\r\nwidth in breadth. In the non-buoyant seeds of C. bonduc, the central\r\ncavity was only 2 to 3 mm. wide, and the lateral cavities were small.\r\n\r\nRespecting the influence of “station” in producing the differences in\r\nbuoyancy, it cannot be said to be connected with the maturation of the\r\nseeds of inland plants under more humid conditions than those which\r\nprevail at the coast. In Fiji some of the littoral plants with buoyant\r\nseeds grow on the mangrove-trees in the shade and humidity of the\r\nswamps; whilst in Hawaii the inland plants of Cæsalpinia bonducella with\r\ntheir non-buoyant seeds thrive in exposed arid situations in districts\r\nof little rainfall, such as on scantily vegetated lava-flows. With\r\nnon-buoyant seeds, where there is little or no cavity, the cotyledons\r\nare always thicker and moister than in the case of the seeds that float.\r\nThough associated with differences in station, as implied in the terms\r\n“coast” and “inland,” the cause of the difference in buoyancy is not\r\nconnected with different degrees of humidity, but with some other cause\r\nor causes acting on the spot which, while they favour the drying of the\r\nkernel in coast plants before the seed-coats finally set, impede it in\r\nthe inland plants. That the seed does not subsequently acquire floating\r\npower, even after years of drying, was shown in several of my\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nThe light, unopened prickly pods of both species float buoyantly, even\r\nwhen the inclosed seeds have no floating power. In an experiment on\r\nCæsalpinia bonduc in Fiji the pods remained afloat after a month in\r\nsea-water. With those of C. bonducella in Hawaii I found that they\r\nfloated for several weeks, and in one case a pod was afloat after three\r\nmonths. The pods dehisce on the plant; but they sometimes do not open\r\nsufficiently to allow the seeds to fall out. The pods, however, have to\r\nbe torn off from the plant, and are not likely to occur in the drift.\r\nIndeed, they never came under my notice in any locality in the drift,\r\nand as an effective aid to dispersal they must be disregarded. The\r\nbuoyancy of the seeds and their well established distribution by\r\ncurrents render unnecessary an appeal to the floating pod.\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the foregoing remarks on Cæsalpinia\r\nbonducella and C. bonduc.\r\n\r\n(1) The two species in Fiji are not always sharply distinguished, since\r\nintermediate forms occur, and here probably lies the explanation of the\r\nconfusion that has sometimes occurred in diagnosing the species.\r\n\r\n(2) Both are typical littoral plants, distributed over most of the\r\ntropical zone, and occurring in company in most of the Pacific\r\narchipelagoes; but they at times extend far inland.\r\n\r\n(3) Though it is not unlikely that sea-birds may have aided in their\r\ndispersal, the oceanic currents have been the great agencies in their\r\ndispersal, as is indicated by the frequent transport of seeds in the\r\nGulf Stream drift across the Atlantic, and by their occurrence in beach\r\ndrift in various parts of the world.\r\n\r\n(4) Having regard to the present arrangement of the currents and the\r\ndistribution of the two species, reasons are given for the belief that\r\ntheir original birthplace was in the interior of the American continent.\r\n\r\n(5) Notwithstanding the stony hardness of the seeds, when a notch is\r\nmade in the outer skin a seed rapidly takes up water, and in a few days\r\nit becomes a soft and much swollen germinating mass. The author is\r\ninclined to think that this was the original condition of the seed, and\r\nthat the rest-stage is an adaptation to secular differentiation of\r\nclimate in later epochs.\r\n\r\n(6) Unlike the seeds of other Leguminous littoral plants, those of\r\nCæsalpinia are not likely to germinate abortively when floating in warm\r\ntropical seas, a risk that restricts the distribution of several\r\nlittoral species.\r\n\r\n(7) As tested by experiment, the seeds of both species are often able to\r\nfloat unharmed for years; but on the other hand seeds not infrequently\r\nhave no floating power.\r\n\r\n(8) Observation, however, shows that buoyancy goes with station, and\r\nthat the general rule here applies that the seeds of coast plants float\r\nand those of inland plants sink.\r\n\r\n(9) The nature of the influence of “station” on the seed-buoyancy is\r\nobscure; but it is evidently not connected with the usual differences\r\nbetween coast and inland localities, such as those concerned with\r\nexposure or shade, dryness of soil, relative humidity, and similar\r\ncontrasts.\r\n\r\n(10) The buoyancy of the seed is developed during the final shrinking\r\nprocess associated with its maturation, a large cavity between the\r\ncotyledons being usually produced.\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\n_Note._—Since most of the principal conclusions of this work are\r\ninvolved in my especial study of the littoral species of Afzelia,\r\nCæsalpinia, and Entada, the reader is advised, if he wishes to form an\r\nopinion of the author’s method of investigation, to read this chapter\r\ncarefully through. With most other shore-plants, though in not a few\r\ncases studied with the same detail, the exigencies of space have often\r\nlimited me to the employment of the general results in the appropriate\r\nchapters without entering into details. Should he desire to test any\r\nview of his own relating to plant-dispersal, he could not do better than\r\nbegin with the materials here provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n          THE ENIGMAS OF THE LEGUMINOSÆ OF THE PACIFIC ISLANDS\r\n\r\nLeguminosæ predominate in tropical littoral floras.—The anomalies of\r\n  their distribution in the Pacific islands.—They conform to no one rule\r\n  of dispersal or of distribution.—Strangers to their stations.—The\r\n  American home of most of the Leguminous littoral plants.—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is my intention here to gather up some of the “ends” of the great\r\ntangle presented by the Leguminosæ in the Pacific. When we look at the\r\nindigenous phanerogamic floras of Fiji, Samoa, Tahiti, and Hawaii we\r\nfind that the Leguminosæ form 5 or 6 per cent. of the total in each of\r\nthe three first-named groups, and only about 2·5 per cent. in Hawaii.\r\nThe paucity of Leguminosæ in oceanic floras was long ago pointed out by\r\nSir Joseph Hooker, whose work forms the foundation of much of our\r\nknowledge of insular plant-life. This is emphasised by Mr. Hemsley in\r\nhis volume on the _Botany of the “Challenger” Expedition_ (Introd. p.\r\n25), where he makes the very significant remark that the Leguminosæ are\r\nwanting in a large number of oceanic islands where there is no truly\r\nlittoral flora. The islands, however, here more especially referred to,\r\nare those of the southern Atlantic and Indian oceans, such as St.\r\nHelena, Tristan da Cunha, and Amsterdam. It is especially true of New\r\nZealand, where the Leguminosæ barely make 2 per cent. of the total. Of\r\nthe Polynesian islands, as he points out, it is not so correct; and, in\r\nfact, the proportion found in the Fijian, Samoan, and Tahitian floras,\r\nrespectively, is much the same as that which characterises the British\r\nflora, namely, 5 to 6 per cent.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to explain the paucity of the Leguminosæ in the Hawaiian\r\nflora we bring to light the singular principle that _Leguminosæ are far\r\nmore characteristic of the littoral flora than of the inland flora of a\r\nPacific island._ About half of the Leguminosæ of Fiji and Tahiti are\r\ncoast plants; and about 30 per cent. of the littoral plants of the\r\nislands of the tropical Pacific belong to this order. Since, therefore,\r\nHawaii possesses much fewer shore-plants (30) than does Tahiti (55) or\r\nFiji (80), the paucity of its Leguminous plants is readily accounted\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nWe have next to notice a principle, which is, in fact, deducible from\r\nthe first, namely, that _buoyant seeds are much more characteristic of\r\nthe Pacific Leguminosæ than of any other order_. Three-fourths of the\r\nspecies have buoyant seeds, and, in fact, about a third of the littoral\r\nPolynesian plants with buoyant seeds or fruits belong to this order.\r\n\r\nIt may, therefore, be inferred that _the Leguminosæ owe their presence\r\nin the islands of the tropical Pacific mainly to the currents_.\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Hemsley’s conclusion that the Leguminosæ are wanting in a large\r\nnumber of islands where there is no truly littoral flora, the\r\npresumptions arise that _when inland species exist that possess no\r\ncapacity for dispersal by currents they are to be regarded as\r\nderivatives from the littoral flora, and that they owe their origin to a\r\nstrand-plant possessing buoyant seeds originally brought by the\r\ncurrents_. It has been shown in the case of Afzelia bijuga and of\r\nCæsalpinia that when Leguminous shore-plants extend inland the seeds\r\noften lose their buoyancy, and it is probable that divergence in other\r\ncharacters may occur, leading, as in the mountains of Fiji, to the\r\ndevelopment of a new species of Cæsalpinia. It is urged that by a\r\ncontinuation of the same process the inland species, Erythrina\r\nmonosperma, has been developed in Tahiti and Hawaii, and the inland\r\nspecies, Canavalia galeata and Sophora chrysophylla, have been produced\r\nin the last-named group. All these species have non-buoyant seeds, and\r\nin all three cases there is no littoral species in Hawaii, it being\r\nassumed that the parent strand-plant has been driven inland from the\r\nbeach. _It is not necessary that the littoral species should be now\r\nrepresented in the flora._\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that _in almost all cases the cause of buoyancy is of\r\nthe non-adaptive or mechanical kind, due either to cavities formed by\r\nthe shrinking of the seed-nucleus during the setting of the seed or to\r\nthe light specific weight of the kernel_. There is but little to show\r\nthat the buoyancy of the seeds of Leguminosæ is anything but an\r\nadventitious character of the seed, as far as its relation to dispersal\r\nby currents is concerned. Although this capacity has been the great\r\nfactor in the wide distribution of the species, yet it is evident that\r\nNature here takes advantage of a quality that could never by its aid\r\nbecome a specific distinction. The upshot of the selecting process would\r\nbe the dispersal by the currents of nearly empty seeds or seeds that\r\nhave lost their germinating capacity.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the Leguminosæ in the Pacific islands, and indeed of\r\ntropical islands generally, is often full of inconsistencies. This is\r\nthe only order that sets at nought most of the principles established\r\nfor the other plants of the sea-coast, and that defies the application\r\nof the laws of plant-dispersal now most in evidence. Take, for instance,\r\nthe inexplicable affinity of Acacia koa, the well-known Koa tree of the\r\nHawaiian forests, to Acacia heterophylla, a tree restricted to the\r\nMascarene islands of Mauritius and Bourbon. Mr. Bentham, who placed them\r\nin the same group with three or four Australian species, even doubted\r\nwhether the difference between the Hawaiian and Mascarene species\r\namounted to specific rank. These two closely related Acacia trees of\r\nfar-separated islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans represent\r\noutliers of the great formation of phyllodineous Acacias that have their\r\nhome in Australia (_Introd. Chall. Bot._ p. 26). As far as I can gather\r\nAcacia seeds have no known means of dispersal. Not even when the tree\r\nhas a littoral station, as in the case of Acacia laurifolia in Fiji,\r\nhave the seeds or pods any capacity worth speaking of for dispersal by\r\ncurrents. We must appeal to the birds; but to what birds we may ask,\r\nunless it be to the extinct Columbæ and their kin, or to the Megapodes.\r\nSome of the other Hawaiian difficulties connected with the inland\r\nLeguminosæ are repeated in the Mascarene Islands. Thus, Bourbon, like\r\nHawaii, has its inland species of Sophora of the section Edwardsia.\r\n\r\nIn their irregular distribution the Leguminosæ of the Pacific islands\r\nare often a source of perplexity to the student of plant-dispersal.\r\nTake, for example, the inland Erythrina, E. monosperma, of Hawaii,\r\nTahiti, and perhaps New Caledonia. Then look at the singular\r\ndistribution of the Sophoras of the Edwardsia section in Chile and Peru,\r\nHawaii, New Zealand, Further India, and Bourbon. The botanist, again,\r\nfinds a climber like Strongylodon in the forests of Fiji, Tahiti, and\r\nHawaii, and he picks up the seeds on the beaches of those islands and\r\nnotices that they float unharmed for many months in the sea, yet when he\r\npays heed to the distribution of the genus he finds that it only\r\ncomprises four or five species, and that it occurs outside the Pacific\r\nonly in the Philippines, Ceylon, and Madagascar. The extraordinary\r\ndistribution of Entada scandens in the Pacific islands has been before\r\nalluded to in these pages. Here we have a plant, the seeds of which are\r\nknown to be transported unharmed by currents all round the tropics. Yet\r\nit is absent from Hawaii and from almost all of the islands of Eastern\r\nPolynesia. In many cases an endeavour has been made in this work to\r\nexplain these difficulties. But the order in the Pacific teems with such\r\ndifficulties. We may ask with astonishment why it is that the genera,\r\nand sometimes even the separate species, of the Leguminosæ seem so often\r\nto follow in each case a principle of their own.\r\n\r\nPlants of this order in the Pacific conform to no one rule of dispersal\r\nor distribution, whether we regard a species, a genus, or the whole\r\norder. Take, for instance, the presence in Hawaii of Canavalia galeata,\r\na plant that, as we know it now, could not possibly have reached there\r\nthrough the agency of the currents, and the absence from the same group\r\nof Entada scandens that could have been readily transported there by the\r\ncurrents from America. Or, if we take the whole order and look at the\r\nstructures connected with the buoyancy of the seeds, we find two types\r\nof structure and the elements of a third. Then, again, whilst most\r\nlittoral plants with buoyant seeds retain the buoyancy of their seeds\r\nwhen they extend inland, Leguminous shore-plants, like Afzelia bijuga\r\nand Cæsalpinia bonducella, when they extend inland in Fiji and Hawaii,\r\nlose in great part or entirely the floating power of their seeds.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, most strand-plants, being typically xerophilous in\r\ncharacter, when they extend inland shun the forests and prefer the dry\r\nsoil and sparsely vegetated surface of the open plain; but the\r\nLeguminous genera and species (Mucuna, Afzelia, Entada, &c.) when they\r\nleave the coast take to the forests, growing usually as stout lianes,\r\nbut sometimes as tall trees. Here again the Leguminosæ seem to follow a\r\nprinciple of their own. As far as I know, this is the only order in the\r\nPacific possessing forest-trees which, as in the case of Afzelia bijuga\r\nin Fiji, are equally at home in the woods of the interior and of the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nIndeed, judging from Professor Schimper’s observations, the littoral\r\nLeguminosæ of the tropics often display a physiological constitution\r\nthat seems in some respects out of touch with their surroundings. They\r\nmay, as in Sophora tomentosa and in Canavalia, present the xerophytic\r\ncharacter of strand-plants, but frequently they are not halophilous or\r\n“salt-loving,” like other plants associated with them on the same\r\nshore-station. They are often shy of salt in their tissues, though able\r\nto thrive in salt-rich localities. That capacity which strand-plants\r\nusually possess of storing up chlorides in their tissues, and especially\r\nin their leaves, without injury to themselves, is but slightly possessed\r\nby such characteristic shore-plants as Canavalia, Pongamia glabra, and\r\nSophora tomentosa. This capacity, which, as Professor Schimper\r\nindicates, goes to determine whether or not plants are capable of living\r\nin salt-rich localities, has often no determining influence with the\r\nLeguminosæ. (See Note 60.)\r\n\r\nThough the plants of this order form such a large element in the\r\nstrand-flora of the Pacific islands and of the tropics generally, they\r\nseem in other respects, besides those just referred to, to act as if\r\nthey were strangers to the station. Look, for instance, at the readiness\r\nof the floating beans of Mucuna, Strongylodon, &c., to germinate, as\r\nshown in Chapter IX, in the tepid waters of the warmer areas of the\r\ntropical oceans. This is a great deal more than a disturbing factor of\r\ndistribution. It is significant also of the plants being out of touch\r\nwith their dispersing agencies.\r\n\r\nOne may notice in conclusion the fact brought out in Chapter VIII that\r\nnearly all the littoral plants dispersed by the currents that are common\r\nto the Old and the New Worlds belong to the Leguminosæ. This is held to\r\nindicate that their home is in America, since that continent distributes\r\nbut does not receive tropical littoral plants dispersed by currents.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Summary._\r\n\r\nThe Leguminosæ are far more characteristic of the littoral flora than of\r\nthe inland flora of the Pacific islands; and since the greater number of\r\nthem have buoyant seeds, it follows that this order mainly owes its\r\npresence in this region to the currents.\r\n\r\nAs it has been shown that in a large number of islands where there is no\r\nlittoral flora the Leguminosæ are wanting, the presumption arises that\r\nwhen, as in Hawaii, inland species occur which at present have no\r\ncapacity for dispersal by currents, they have been derived from\r\nstrand-plants originally brought by the currents, even though such shore\r\nspecies no longer belong to the flora.\r\n\r\nAs far as its relation to dispersal by currents is concerned, the\r\nbuoyancy of the seeds of Leguminosæ is merely an adventitious character,\r\nand the structure connected with it has no specific value.\r\n\r\nPlants of this order in the Pacific are a source of much perplexity and\r\nconform to no one rule of dispersal, whether as regards their\r\ndisconnected distribution, their means of dispersal, the structural\r\ncause of buoyancy, the loss of buoyancy of inland species, and in other\r\nparticulars. Even in their physiological constitution they are often at\r\nvariance with the bulk of littoral plants when they grow on the\r\nsea-shore, since typical beach-plants of the order, though thriving in\r\nsalt-rich localities, are shy of salt in their tissues.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that whilst the Pacific islands have derived most of\r\ntheir littoral plants that are dispersed by currents from the tropics of\r\nthe Old World, they have received most of their strand Leguminosæ from\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n                THE INLAND PLANTS OF THE PACIFIC ISLANDS\r\n\r\n PRELIMINARY COMPARISON OF THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OF HAWAII, FIJI, AND\r\n                                 TAHITI\r\n\r\nIntroductory remarks.—The tranquil working of the winds and currents\r\n  contrasted with the revolutionary influence of the bird.—The Hawaiian,\r\n  Fijian, and Tahitian groups.—Their surface-areas and elevations.—Their\r\n  climates.—The mountain climate of Hawaii.—The rainfall of the three\r\n  groups.—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.\r\n\r\nI WILL carry my readers back to that moment when we began to investigate\r\ntogether the composition of the floras of the islands of the tropical\r\nPacific from the standpoint of dispersal. It will be remembered that\r\nafter collecting all the fruits and seeds of a particular island we\r\nplaced them in sea-water, and that some nine-tenths of them went to the\r\nbottom at once or in a few days. We found, speaking generally, that the\r\nbuoyant seeds and fruits belonged to coast plants, whilst those at the\r\nbottom of the vessel proved to be obtained from inland plants. Since\r\nthat period we have been occupied in following up the clue supplied by\r\nthe floating seeds and fruits. In their company we have travelled far\r\nbeyond the Pacific islands. We have not only seen their fellows in other\r\nparts of the tropics, both on the coral atoll and on the continental\r\ncoast, but we have met their representatives on the beaches of Europe\r\nand of temperate South America. We have followed them in their ocean\r\ntraverses round most of the tropical zone, and on the way we have\r\nnaturally interested ourselves in the question of the currents. We have\r\nweighed these seeds and fruits and have compared their specific weight\r\nwith that of sea-water. We have cut them up and carefully examined them,\r\nand under their guidance we have explored the mangrove-swamps both of\r\nPolynesia and of Ecuador, and have penetrated the mysterious _cul de\r\nsac_ of vivipary. Having formed our opinion of them, we now bid the\r\nsubject farewell, and stand once more on the same Pacific beach where,\r\nit seems so long ago, our investigations began.\r\n\r\nFor the seed and fruits lying at the bottom of the sea-water we have to\r\nappeal to other agencies than to that of the currents if we wish to\r\ninquire into their means of arriving at this island. In imagination we\r\nleave the reef-lined shores for the interior, and exchange the\r\nexhilarating surroundings of a coral beach, where “the sky is always\r\nblue and the wind is always true,” for the arid conditions of an inland\r\nplain, or for the humid conditions of the forest, where the rain is\r\nincessant and the cloud-cap and mist seemingly eternal. When we look at\r\nthe motley collection of fruits and seeds obtained in such localities,\r\nwe are at a loss to know where to take up the clue. After vainly\r\nendeavouring to obtain some inspiration as to the manner of commencing\r\nthe inquiry, we do what all good naturalists in the Pacific islands do\r\nfrom force of habit when they meet with difficulties of any kind—we sit\r\ndown and light our pipes. Then come a flood of old memories and old\r\ntrains of thought that came to us years before on some mountain-top or\r\nin a shady gorge or on some river-bank, in regions Pacific and\r\nnon-Pacific, and by degrees our ideas shape themselves and we begin to\r\nthink the matter over in an orderly fashion.\r\n\r\nWhen the winds first brought the spores of ferns to this Pacific island,\r\nthe ocean currents brought the seeds and fruits of littoral plants, and\r\nthe birds transported the seeds and “stones” of various inland species.\r\nAll three agencies have been working side by side since the earliest\r\nstage in its history. Yet it is only in the work of the wind and the\r\ncurrent that we find any indication of stability in the floral history\r\nof the island. With the work of the bird it has been very different.\r\nSince the first bird carried seeds to this locality all else has been\r\nturmoil and change. Wave after wave of migrant plants has overrun the\r\ninterior of the island, and all have left their mark; but the great\r\ndistributing factor and disturbing agent has always been the bird.\r\nGenera have been born and have disappeared, and in their place new\r\ngenera have arisen. Whole families even have participated in the\r\nrevolutions of the plant-world, and species have grown rankly in the\r\ngreat confusion. Last of all came man with his cultivated plants and his\r\nweeds, introducing new elements of change and discord into the island,\r\nand often upsetting the floral economy altogether. The history of man’s\r\nmost troubled epoch would not be more full of catastrophes and great\r\nevents than the history of the plants of this Pacific island. Yet\r\nthrough all these changes the winds and currents have been quietly\r\ncarrying on their work, bringing the same plants to beach and hillside\r\nthat they did before the age of unrest began.\r\n\r\nThe monotonous character of an island flora that has been supplied by\r\nthe winds and currents can be readily imagined. For their variety the\r\nfloras of the Pacific islands are mainly indebted to the bird, the great\r\ndisturber of the peace of the plant world. We cannot attach too much\r\nimportance to the contrast in the results produced by these several\r\nagencies in stocking a Pacific island with its plants. On the one hand\r\nwe have the tranquil working through the ages of the winds and currents.\r\nOn the other hand there has been the revolutionary influence of the\r\nbird. One cannot doubt that many of the species of flowering plants now\r\ngrowing on the beach and many of the ferns on the upper mountain-slopes\r\nhave witnessed changes within the forest-zone of the island, such as an\r\nantediluvian might record if he had lived through the ages to the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nNow, what are these changes? How has the bird acted unconsciously such a\r\ndetermining part? These are questions which I will endeavour in some way\r\nto answer as one picks one’s path slowly through the various epochs in\r\nthe plant-history of these islands. We already are fairly well\r\nacquainted with the beginnings of a flora either on a coral atoll or on\r\nan ordinary tropical beach. What we have yet to learn is the subsequent\r\nhistory of the flora. When Dr. Treub undertook, in 1886, his now\r\ncelebrated examination of the new flora of Krakatoa after the great\r\neruption, he commenced a series of observations which will no doubt be\r\nprolonged into future centuries. Botanists a hundred and two hundred\r\nyears hence will complete a long chain of observations which will be\r\nunique as a record of plant-colonisation; and science is deeply indebted\r\nto Prof. Penzig for making, in 1897, the second examination of the new\r\nflora. Though deprived of the valuable record that future generations\r\nwill possess for Krakatoa, we yet have at our disposal in the completed\r\nprocess displayed by many a Pacific island a means of working backward\r\nand in a sense completing the history.\r\n\r\nIn order to attack this problem I have mainly confined myself to the\r\nFijian, Tahitian, and Hawaiian floras, taking the three archipelagoes\r\njust named as the centres of the regions in which they occur. These\r\nthree groups lie near the three angles of the triangular area of the\r\nPacific over which the various archipelagoes are scattered. They are\r\nthus geographically well placed for an inquiry into the subject of\r\nplant-dispersal over this ocean, and each of their floras has been\r\ninvestigated by botanists of various nationalities—American, Austrian,\r\nBritish, French, German, and Italian. The Fijian area may be regarded as\r\nincluding the adjacent Samoan and Tongan groups, though the individual\r\ngroup or the whole area will always be in this work particularised. In\r\nthe same way Tahiti will be viewed as usually representative of the\r\nlarger islands of the surrounding groups of the Cook and Austral Islands\r\nand of the Marquesas; and under the designation of the Tahitian area or\r\nTahitian region there will be generally included the Paumotu\r\narchipelago.\r\n\r\n\r\n   COMPARISON OF THE AREAS AND ALTITUDES OF HAWAII, FIJI, AND TAHITI.\r\n\r\nSince differences in physical conditions have played an important part\r\nin plant distribution in these groups—such, for instance, as in\r\ndetermining the development of a mountain flora or in favouring the\r\nrelative abundance of particular types of plants—it is at first\r\nessential to obtain a general idea, in the case of the larger islands of\r\neach group, of their size and elevation, and of the more conspicuous\r\ndifferences in their climates.\r\n\r\nHawaii, the largest island of the Hawaiian archipelago, has an area of\r\n4,210 square miles. All the other islands of the group are considerably\r\nsmaller—Maui, the second in size, having a surface of 760 square miles;\r\nOahu coming next; and after it Kauai, with an area of 590 square miles.\r\nThe area of Viti Levu, the largest island of the Fijis, is 4,112 square\r\nmiles, being thus closely similar to that of the island of Hawaii; Vanua\r\nLevu, the second in size, is 2,433 square miles in extent; whilst the\r\nother important islands of the group are much smaller, Taviuni, the\r\nthird in size, having an area of 218, and Kandavu an area of 125 square\r\nmiles. Tahiti, the largest and loftiest island of Eastern Polynesia, has\r\na surface of about 400 square miles; whilst most of the other elevated\r\nislands of the groups around are considerably smaller.\r\n\r\nIn respect of elevation above the sea, there is a great contrast between\r\nthe islands of these three regions. Taking the Hawaiian Group first, we\r\nnotice that the three principal mountains of the large island of Hawaii\r\nrise in the cases of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa to between 13,000 and\r\n14,000 feet, and in that of Hualalai to rather over 8,000 feet. Situated\r\nbetween these three mountains there is an extensive tableland or\r\nplateau, known as the Cattle Plains, which is elevated between 4,000 and\r\n6,000 feet, and has an area of not less than 200 square miles. At least\r\na third of the whole area of the island exceeds 4,000 feet in altitude.\r\nIn the eastern portion of Maui the huge mass of Haleakala rises to\r\nrather over 10,000 feet; whilst Mount Eeka, in West Maui, rises in bulk\r\nto some 6,000 feet. The island of Kauai, which is elevated between 5,000\r\nand 6,000 feet, possesses in its interior an elevated tableland 40\r\nsquare miles in extent and 4,000 feet in altitude. Oahu attains in Mount\r\nKaala a maximum elevation of 4,000 feet, but 3,000 feet is the limit of\r\nthe other peaks, and much of the island is low in elevation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the two largest islands of Fiji, namely, Viti Levu\r\nand Vanua Levu, we find in the first-named only two or three of the\r\nhighest mountain peaks rising to between 4,000 and 5,000 feet; whilst\r\nthe highest peak of Vanua Levu reaches only to about 3,500 feet. Amongst\r\nthe lesser islands, Taviuni just reaches the level of 4,000 feet, and\r\nKandavu, the next in height, about 2,750 feet. The area of the\r\nland-surface in this group that is above a level of 4,000 feet is very\r\nscanty, and for the botanist a negligible quantity, so that for purposes\r\nof comparison the Fijian Islands, as far as elevation is concerned,\r\ncorrespond to the lower levels of the Hawaiian Islands, that is, to the\r\nareas below 4,000 feet. The same may be said of the Samoan Islands with\r\nthe exception of a limited area in the centre of Savaii, where a peak\r\nrises to 5,400 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nComing to the Tahitian region, we find that Tahiti, the most elevated\r\nisland, attains an extreme height of about 7,300 feet; but from its\r\nsurface-configuration it is evident that not one-tenth of the area\r\nexceeds 5,000 feet; yet since its total extent is about 400 square miles\r\nthere must be an elevated region of some 30 square miles in amount\r\ncomparable in some degree with the uplands of Hawaii. The Marquesas,\r\nnext in order in size and height, attain a maximum elevation of about\r\n4,000 feet; whilst, amongst the Cook and Austral Groups, Rarotonga\r\nreaches a height, according to Mr. Cheeseman, of 2,250 feet. Excepting\r\nthe limited elevated area of the uplands of Tahiti, there is nothing in\r\nEastern Polynesia corresponding to the higher levels of the Hawaiian\r\nIslands over 4,000 feet. We formed the same conclusion for Fiji, and I\r\nmay add that it applies to the whole area of Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga,\r\nsince the solitary peak of Savaii in the second-named group, which\r\nreaches 5,400 feet, alone represents a high-level area. The uplands of\r\nHawaii—that is to say, the elevated region between 4,000 or 5,000 feet\r\nand 14,000 feet (strictly speaking 13,800 feet)—are therefore almost\r\nunrepresented amongst the Oceanic groups of the South Pacific; and it is\r\nonly in the peak of Savaii and in the limited high levels of Tahiti that\r\nwe would expect to find their conditions reproduced. The great effect\r\nthat this contrast implies in determining differences between the floras\r\nof the Hawaiian, Fijian, and Tahitian regions will become apparent as we\r\nproceed in this discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n        COMPARISON OF THE CLIMATES OF HAWAII, FIJI, AND TAHITI.\r\n\r\nBefore comparing the climatic conditions in the three groups, it may\r\nfirst be remarked that since they lie, roughly speaking, at not very\r\ndissimilar distances north and south of the equator a great contrast is\r\nnot to be expected in so far as they agree in elevation. The mean\r\nlatitudes do not differ greatly, that of Hawaii being 20° to 21° N., and\r\nthose of Fiji and Tahiti both about 18° S. The climate of both groups is\r\ntempered by the north-east trade in the one region and by the south-east\r\ntrade in the other. Still there is a difference in the temperature and\r\ndryness of the air which noticeably distinguishes Hawaii from Fiji, and\r\nto a less extent from Tahiti. The mean temperature of the Hawaiian\r\nIslands would be 74° or 75°; whilst that of Tahiti is placed at 76° to\r\n77°, and that of Fiji at 79°. But it is to be observed that to a person\r\nresiding in Fiji after a residence in Hawaii the climate is perceptibly\r\nwarmer, more humid, and more enervating. No doubt this is in part\r\nconnected with the greater dryness of the air in Hawaii, where the\r\naverage relative humidity at Honolulu is placed at 72 per cent., and it\r\nmust be much less on the Kona coast on the dry side of the largest\r\nisland. It is, however, probable that the Hawaiian climate was less dry\r\nbefore the destruction of the forests, and that the contrast with the\r\nFijian climate was then less pronounced.\r\n\r\nThe great distinguishing feature, however, of the Hawaiian Islands is to\r\nbe found in their mountain climate. This is not represented in Fiji, but\r\nslightly in Samoa, and to a small extent in Tahiti; and I will now refer\r\nmore particularly to this important subject.\r\n\r\nIn the uplands of the large island of Hawaii, on the tops of the lofty\r\nmountains 10,000 to 14,000 feet above the sea, we have a mean\r\ntemperature only found far north. Snow lies often on these barren\r\nsummits in winter, more particularly on Mauna Kea, which thus derives\r\nits native name of the White Mountain. The details of my meteorological\r\nobservations on Mauna Loa will be found in Note 61; and only some of the\r\ngeneral results will be referred to here.\r\n\r\nThe mean temperature for the period of twenty-three days passed by me on\r\nthe summit of Mauna Loa (13,600 feet) between August 9th and 31st, 1897,\r\nwas 38·5° F. The mean temperature for a period of twenty days from\r\nDecember 24th, 1840, to January 12th, 1841, during which Commodore\r\nWilkes and his party were making pendulum observations on the summit of\r\nthe same mountain, was approximately 33·5° (see Note 61). From these\r\nresults, which are tabulated below, it will be seen that the mean annual\r\ntemperature would be probably about 36°, which is scarcely comparable\r\nwith any continental climate, since only a difference of a few degrees\r\nis indicated between the mean temperatures of August and of a similar\r\nperiod in mid-winter. I may add that although it was in the summer month\r\nof August, water froze inside my tent during twenty out of the\r\ntwenty-three nights passed on the top. We may, therefore, infer that the\r\ntemperature falls below the freezing point at night practically\r\nthroughout the year. It will be seen from the table that the mean annual\r\ntemperature for the summit of Mauna Loa, as here computed from the\r\nobservations of Commodore Wilkes and myself, comes very near to that\r\nwhich might be estimated by employing Hann’s tables of variation in\r\ntemperature with altitude on tropical mountains (see Schimper’s\r\n_Plant-Geography_, iv. 691).\r\n\r\n\r\n       WINTER AND SUMMER TEMPERATURES ON THE SUMMIT OF MAUNA LOA\r\n                 (13,600 FEET), IN DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.\r\n\r\n +---------+---------------+--------------+-------+--------+--------+------------+\r\n |Observer.|    Period.    |  Mean daily  |Lowest.|Highest.|Mean for|Approximate |\r\n |         |               |    range.    |       |        |period. |yearly mean.|\r\n +---------+---------------+--------------+-------+--------+--------+------------+\r\n |Wilkes   |Dec. 24, 1840- |17°-50°=33°   |  13°  |  55°?  | 33·5°  | }          |\r\n |         |Jan. 12, 1841  |              |       |        |        | }          |\r\n |         |               |              |       |        |        | }  36°     |\r\n |Guppy    |Aug. 9-31, 1897|23·2-53·8=30·6|  15   |  61·2  | 38·5   | }          |\r\n +---------+---------------+--------------+-------+--------+--------+------------+\r\n\r\nEstimated mean annual temperature of the summit of Mauna Loa, taking\r\nthat of the coast at 75°, would be 34° if the rate of increase was the\r\nsame as on Mount Pangerango in Java (1° per 328 feet).\r\n\r\nThe great daily range of temperature is one of the most striking\r\nfeatures of the climate of the summit of Mauna Loa. The extreme recorded\r\nby me was 38·7°, whilst Wilkes registered as much as 42°. As on most\r\nlofty mountains the dryness of the air, as indicated by the relative\r\nhumidity, was usually great. The average percentage during my stay\r\nbetween 8 and 9 A.M. was 44, at midday 43, and between 5 and 6 P.M. 56.\r\nThis may be contrasted with 72, the average for the year at Honolulu. In\r\nthe tropics the mean for the year in the lower levels often rises to 80\r\nand over; and it can scarcely be doubted that the Hawaiian climate is\r\ngenerally drier than it was before the destruction of the forests. The\r\nlowest relative humidity recorded by me on the summit of Mauna Loa was\r\n20 per cent. Junghuhn on the summits of two mountains in Java, 10,500\r\nand 11,500 feet in height, recorded percentages as low as 5 and 13.\r\nFurther details relating to this subject are given in Note 61. The\r\nrainfall on the top of Mauna Loa is probably very slight. During my\r\nsojourn rain was noted on six days, but on only two could it be\r\nmeasured, and the total fall could not have amounted to over a third of\r\nan inch.\r\n\r\nThe mean annual temperature of the great forest-zone at the elevations\r\nwhere it displays the greatest luxuriance of growth on the island of\r\nHawaii, that is, between 4,000 and 6,000 feet, would be estimated at 63°\r\nand 57° F., if we take the rate of decrease before employed of about\r\nthree degrees per 1,000 feet. But remembering the heavy rainfall in this\r\nregion and the usual occurrence of a protecting belt of cloud during the\r\nday, this might seem to be too high. According, however, to a table\r\ngiven by Mr. Jared G. Smith in his annual report of the Hawaii\r\nAgricultural Experiment Station for 1902, the average temperature at\r\n4,000 feet would be 65°. I cannot help thinking this is excessive as an\r\naverage for the island. In the latter part of May, 1897, the mean\r\ntemperature during my sojourn of twelve days at elevations between 6,000\r\nand 6,700 feet around the slopes of Mauna Kea was 51·2°; whilst for\r\neight days in the first part of June in the same region the mean\r\ntemperature was 58·2° at an altitude of 4,000 to 4,300 feet.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, as I have pointed out on a later page, to recognise in\r\nthe different zones of vegetation the floras of a variety of latitudes;\r\nand these zones are to a large extent controlled by temperature as well\r\nas by other conditions. Thus the Fijian would be amongst familiar\r\nvegetation on the lower slopes of Mauna Kea, whilst the Maori would be\r\nat home halfway up the mountain-slopes, and the African from the upper\r\nforests of Kilima Njaro and Ruwenzori would find in the higher levels\r\nmuch to remind him of his native land.\r\n\r\nThe upper woods extend usually to 8,000 or 9,000 feet above the sea, and\r\nvegetation of a scrubby character occurs as high generally as 10,000 or\r\n11,000 feet. The highest regions present only a barren rocky waste.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE RAINFALL.\r\n\r\n_The Hawaiian Islands._—Although on account of the extensive deforesting\r\nof the Hawaiian Islands since their discovery the contrast between this\r\ngroup and that of Fiji is now, as regards rainfall, somewhat emphasised,\r\nit is almost certain that in early times the contrast was much less\r\nmarked. In the lower levels the natives and sandal wood traders in the\r\npast, and the agriculturists in the present, have accomplished much in\r\nthis direction. Between 1,000 and 3,000 feet, whole forests were in my\r\ntime disappearing under fire and axe for the coffee plantations. Above\r\nthose levels up to the higher limits of the woods, cattle were\r\ndestroying the forests in a wholesale fashion; whilst foreign insects\r\nwere proving themselves almost as great enemies to the vegetation. I\r\nremember an enterprising agriculturist explaining to me how he cleared\r\nthe land of forest around his station. A large tract having been fenced\r\nin, the cattle were introduced. After destroying the undergrowth and the\r\nyoung trees, the animals attacked the bark of the trees, and in a year\r\nor two, without fire or axe, the land was cleared. The consequence of\r\nthis unchecked destruction of the forests was in my time becoming only\r\ntoo evident. When I passed through Ookala, on the Hamakua coast, at the\r\nend of May, 1897, there was a water famine. Water was sold at a quarter\r\nof a dollar a bucket, and the allowance for a family was three oil-cans\r\na week. Stealing water was a crime and punished by the plantation\r\nauthorities by dismissal or a five-dollar fine.\r\n\r\nIf we could look back for fifty or sixty years—I am now quoting from the\r\nreports of Prof. Koebele and Dr. Stubbs—we should see large forests\r\nwhere we now see barren slopes and plains. Originally forests covered\r\nthe upland plateaux and mountain slopes of all the islands. Now much of\r\nthe original forests has been removed, and large areas of naked soils\r\nand bare rocks remain. The present forest area, writes Mr. Giffard, the\r\neditor of the _Hawaiian Forester_ (August, 1904), is about 20 per cent.\r\nof the islands, a small fraction of what it was a hundred years ago. It\r\nis, however, very satisfactory to learn that American energy is now\r\ncombating this evil. Already in the January number of the same journal\r\nis to be found a report by Mr. W. L. Hall, of the Bureau of Forestry, on\r\n“The Forests of Hawaii”; and now, under the charge of Mr. Jared G.\r\nSmith, institutions have been formed and experiment stations have been\r\nestablished for “the intelligent and skilful cultivation of the soil.”\r\nHawaii owes much to the United States Department of Agriculture. May we\r\nin England take the cue in the case of our own Crown colonies!\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the comparison of the present rainfall of\r\nHawaii must be carried out with discrimination. But it may be at once\r\nobserved that to make a contrast in detail between the rainfalls of\r\nthese three groups is quite beyond the province of this work; and this\r\nremark applies also to the other observations on the climatic\r\nconditions. I can only treat the subject in an illustrative fashion in\r\nconnection with the general subject of their floras.\r\n\r\nThanks to Professor Lyons, the Government meteorologist, the rainfall\r\nhas long been systematically investigated. It may be said to range\r\nanywhere between 10 and 300 inches. As in most groups within the\r\ntrade-wind belts, there is a great contrast in the rainfall between the\r\nweather and leeward sides of the islands, which is well exhibited in the\r\nlarge island of Hawaii. Whilst in the Hilo district on the wet side of\r\nthe island the annual rainfall near the coast is about 120 inches, on\r\nthe Kona coast of the dry side of the island it may be anything between\r\n20 and 50 inches and it may fall to less than 10. The effect of\r\nelevation is, however, evident on both the weather and lee sides of the\r\nisland. Thus at a height of 1,650 feet in the Hilo district it is as\r\nmuch as 180 inches, and at a greater elevation 210 inches. At a height\r\nof about 1,600 feet at Kealakekua, on the dry side of the island the\r\naverage yearly rainfall, according to the results kindly supplied to me\r\nby the Rev. S. H. Davis, was for the six years, 1891-6, 60 inches. On\r\nthe beach, as he says, it is “very much less,” probably not 30 inches.\r\nDr. Maxwell, in his report on “Irrigation in Hawaii,” mentions a\r\nlocality in Maui where the rainfall at the sea-shore was 28 inches, and\r\nat a height of 2,800 feet up the mountain side as much as 179 inches. In\r\nthe region of the cloud-belt, which coincides with that of the\r\nforest-zone on the slopes of the great mountains of Hawaii and extends\r\nup from about 3,000 to 7,000 or 8,000 feet above the sea, the average\r\nannual rainfall would probably be rarely under 200 inches, and in some\r\nlocalities it might approach 300 inches. There are some particularly wet\r\nmountains, and amongst these may be placed the high table-land of Kauai\r\n(4,000 feet) and the flat summit of Mount Eeka (6,000 feet) in West\r\nMaui. Here in a region almost of eternal mist we have developed a\r\nspecial bog-flora.\r\n\r\nHillebrand describes the flat top of Mount Eeka as “wrapt in a cloud of\r\nmist nearly the whole year.” Whilst descending this mountain I was\r\novertaken by the darkness at a little under 5,000 feet above the sea.\r\nThrough the night there was a continuous soft rain, or rather a heavy\r\nwet mist, and I passed it under conditions suggestive of living in a\r\nsponge. Everything was reeking with moisture. The air was saturated with\r\nit, and water dripped from every leaf and branch, whilst the ground on\r\nwhich I stood was soft and yielding and soaked with water like a sponge.\r\nThe surface was cut up by numerous narrow water-channels ten to twenty\r\nfeet deep and only a couple of feet wide, their very existence almost\r\nconcealed by ferns, whilst torrents rushed along at the bottom and kept\r\nup a strange music through the night. This was the longest night I have\r\never experienced, as my standing-ground was very limited, and with a\r\nwater-channel a foot or two away on either side I had to keep on my legs\r\nuntil the dawn.\r\n\r\nAbove the cloud-belt, at elevations of 10,000 feet and over, the\r\nrainfall is evidently very small. I have before remarked that during my\r\nstay of twenty-three days (August 9-31) on the summit of Mauna Loa\r\n(13,600 feet) the rain did not exceed one-third of an inch in amount. I\r\nhave by my side the report to the Weather Bureau, compiled by Prof.\r\nLyons, on the rainfall of this large island of Hawaii for the entire\r\nmonth (August, 1897); and it enables one to make a comparison, in some\r\nrespects unique, of the distribution of the August rainfall on Mauna\r\nLoa, from its base to its summit, where it occupies the breadth of the\r\nisland. Whilst on the east or wet side from the coast up to 1,500 feet\r\namounts ranging from 11 to 15 inches were measured, on the west or dry\r\nside between one and two inches were registered at the coast, and 10\r\ninches at Kealakekua, about 1,600 feet above the sea. But the level of\r\nmaximum precipitation would lie much further up the mountain slopes on\r\neither side, probably at an altitude of 4,000 or 5,000 feet, and here\r\nthe rainfall for the month could not have been less in either case than\r\n20 inches. Above this line of greatest rainfall the amount of\r\natmospheric precipitation would become less and less until beyond the\r\nupper forest zone above 10,000 feet to the summit (13,600 feet) the\r\nquantity would be very small; and judging from my observations, that\r\ncovered three-fourths of the month, the rainfall on the top of the\r\nmountain for August would not have far exceeded half an inch.\r\n\r\nThe dry climate of the summits of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa is reproduced\r\non the tops of the Java mountains and on the summits of the Owen Stanley\r\nRange in New Guinea. Sir W. Macgregor found a fine and dry climate on\r\nthe top of the mountains last named, beyond the limits of the forests,\r\nwhich extend to 12,000 feet above the sea. Below lay the cloud belt, a\r\nzone of moss and fog, where at an elevation of 7,000 to 8,000 feet\r\neverything was reeking with moisture (_Journ. Roy. Geogr. Soc._ 1890).\r\nObservers at the coast often little imagine, when looking at a\r\ncloud-concealed mountain peak, that although the cloud-belt from below\r\nlooks black and lowering and rain is falling heavily in the gloomy\r\nforests, there is on the upper side a region of bright sunshine, and\r\nthat the peak stands out, unseen by them, above a sea of clouds\r\nsparkling brilliantly in the sun and dazzling in their whiteness. It\r\nwill be seen from the table given in Note 61, that during my sojourn on\r\nthe summit of Mauna Loa the sky was cloudless or almost free from cloud\r\nduring nearly half the time. The mean cloudiness in the forenoon for\r\ntwenty-two days was 1·3 and for the afternoon 3·5, whilst the nights\r\nwere cloudless.\r\n\r\n_The Rainfall of Fiji._—The rainfall of Fiji is known to be very large.\r\nIn illustration I will take Vanua Levu, the second largest island,\r\npartly because of my familiar acquaintance with it, and partly because I\r\nhave at my disposal measurements for both the lee and weather sides of\r\nthe island—the first dry and characterised by a scanty and peculiar\r\nvegetation, the second humid and densely forested. At Davutu, near the\r\nsea-level on the weather or wet side of the island, the average yearly\r\nfall for a period of sixteen years up to 1898 was 160 inches (these\r\nobservations were made in the grounds of the manager’s house and I am\r\nindebted to Mr. Barratt for allowing me to inspect them). The\r\nmountainous backbone of the island, which has an elevation ranging\r\nusually from 2,000 to 3,000 feet, is generally in the rain-clouds.\r\nDuring the months I was occupied in examining the geology of these\r\nmountains, it was a common experience to be drenched to the skin all day\r\nlong, and I cannot doubt that the annual rainfall in the higher levels\r\nmust often reach 300 inches. Those familiar with the “sun-burnt” lands\r\nor “talasinga” plains that mainly form the north or lee side of the\r\nisland, would expect a great difference in rainfall as compared with the\r\nsouth or weather side. There is a marked difference, it is true, but it\r\nis far less than we might have looked for. At Delanasau on the north\r\ncoast, less than a hundred feet above the sea, the mean rainfall for\r\nseven years (1871-77), according to the observations of Mr Holmes, was\r\n113 inches, and the range 80 to 159 inches (see Horne’s _Year in Fiji_).\r\nIn discussing the origin of the arid-looking plains on the north or lee\r\nside of the island in Note 22, I have shown that the explanation is to\r\nbe found not so much in the rainfall as in the dryness of the air as\r\nindicated by the relative humidity.\r\n\r\nThe rainfall varies greatly in and around Vanua Levu, but there is\r\nlittle doubt that by far the greatest bulk of the rain is precipitated\r\non the upper weather slopes of the mountainous backbone of the island.\r\nTaviuni, which lies off its weather coast, is probably the wettest among\r\nthe smaller islands of the group. In 1877, when 80 inches were recorded\r\nby Mr. Holmes at Delanasau on the north side of Vanua Levu and 73 inches\r\nat Levuka in the island of Ovalau, 251 inches were measured in Taviuni\r\nat Ngara Walu 564 feet above the sea; and in 1875 the rainfall recorded\r\nat Taviuni was 212 inches, and at Delanasau 126 inches (Horne).\r\n\r\nFortunately, the Fijian islands have not been long enough occupied by\r\nthe whites to produce much effect on the rainfall through the\r\ndestruction of the forests. A significant warning, however, has been\r\ngiven in the vicinity of Levuka. The woods of the hills around the town,\r\nas we learn from Mr. Horne, were cut down to prevent them from affording\r\nshelter to the unfriendly natives of the interior, the result being to\r\nreduce the number of rainy days in a few years from 256 to 149 per\r\nannum.\r\n\r\n_The Tahitian rainfall._—The annual rainfall of the coast districts of\r\nTahiti is placed at about 50 inches (_Encycl. Brit._ vol. 23); but, as\r\nis observed by Nadeaud and Drake del Castillo, the rain-clouds gather\r\nround the peaks, and the precipitation is much greater in the interior\r\nthan at the “littoral,” with a corresponding result in a striking\r\ndifference between the vegetation of the two regions. Probably,\r\ntherefore, the rainfall for the year on the wooded mountain slopes and\r\nat the heads of valleys where the vegetation is most luxuriant would be\r\nover 100, and perhaps as much as 150 inches in places. (The annual\r\nrainfall in Rarotonga is, according to Cheeseman, about 90 inches.)\r\n\r\nIt is evident that in the three groups of Hawaii, Fiji, and Tahiti, the\r\nrainfall varies greatly with situation and with elevation; but the\r\ncontrast is much greater in Hawaii than in Fiji. Thus there would be\r\nscarcely any place on the lee side of Vanua Levu where the average\r\nannual fall would be less than 80 or 90 inches, except perhaps in the\r\nUndu Promontory, whilst on the lava-bound coast of the west or lee side\r\nof Hawaii, it may be reduced to 20 inches and less. There is no doubt\r\nthat this was to some extent the case in pre-European times, since Fiji\r\nmust have possessed for ages, on the northern sides of the larger\r\nislands, its arid “talasinga” or “sun-burnt” plains; and in the island\r\nof Hawaii there must have always been vast, scantily vegetated lava\r\nfields at the sea-border. It is probable, however, that it is in the\r\nolder islands of the Hawaiian group, those where the volcanic forces\r\nhave been long extinct, that the rainfall has been chiefly affected by\r\ndeforestation. Speaking generally, in pre-European times the climatic\r\nconditions of the lower levels of the group, that is below 4,000 feet,\r\nwhich are alone comparable with Fiji, were less contrasted with the\r\nclimatic conditions of the Fijian islands than they are at present. By\r\nreason of their great elevation, the Hawaiian islands present a mountain\r\nclimate not found in Fiji, and scantily represented in Tahiti. It is,\r\ntherefore, in the flora of the Hawaiian uplands that we should expect to\r\nfind the great distinguishing feature between that group and Fiji.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Summary of the Chapter._\r\n\r\n(1) Whilst the winds and the currents have been working tranquilly\r\nthrough the ages, bringing always the same vascular cryptogams and\r\nshore-plants to the Pacific islands, the bird has ever been a disturbing\r\nfactor in the inland flora, and changes often of a revolutionary\r\ncharacter have taken place from time to time within the forest-zone.\r\n\r\n(2) In the discussion of the inland plants of these islands, the Fijian,\r\nTahitian and Hawaiian areas are taken as centres of development and\r\ndispersal, and as including the groups around.\r\n\r\n(3) On account of the contrast in physical conditions presented by these\r\narchipelagoes, differences with which some of the most distinctive\r\nfeatures of the floras are to be connected, a comparison of the islands\r\nfrom this standpoint is first necessary.\r\n\r\n(4) Since the largest islands of the Fijian and Hawaiian areas are from\r\nfive to ten times the size of Tahiti, the largest island of the Tahitian\r\nregion, we would expect to find in the two first-named groups a much\r\nmore varied flora.\r\n\r\n(5) There are three huge mountain-masses in the Hawaiian group which\r\nrise to between 10,000 and 14,000 feet, and there is in the aggregate a\r\nlarge area elevated more than 4,000 feet above the sea. These elevated\r\nregions are almost unrepresented in the southern groups, the Fijian\r\nislands being only comparable with the lower levels of the Hawaiian\r\nislands below 4,000 feet, and the same is true of all the groups with\r\nthe exception of a limited area in Tahiti, where the mountains reach a\r\nheight of 7,300 feet, and of the solitary peak of Savaii in Samoa, which\r\nattains an altitude of 5,400 feet. Thus the conditions for a high-level\r\nor mountain flora which exist in Hawaii are not to be found in Fiji, but\r\nslightly in Samoa, and to a limited extent in Tahiti.\r\n\r\n(6) From their position with regard to the equator and with reference to\r\nthe trade-winds a great contrast between the climates of these three\r\nregions—the Fijian, the Tahitian, and the Hawaiian—is, as far as the\r\nislands agree in elevation, not to be expected, and in fact does not\r\nexist. The Fijian climate, however, is now warmer and more humid, and\r\nthe general rainfall is greater than in the case of Hawaii, but it is\r\nprobable that these differences were much less pronounced before the\r\ndestruction of the Hawaiian forests, which has been in progress since\r\nthe discovery of the group.\r\n\r\n(7) Anywhere around the coasts of the larger Fijian islands we might\r\nexpect an annual rainfall of not less than 80 or 100 inches. In the\r\nHawaiian group the rainfall at the coast may be anything between 10 and\r\n100 inches, but is generally less than 50 inches. In Tahiti, at the\r\ncoast, it is 50 inches. In all cases the rainfall increases greatly with\r\nelevation. In the Fijian mountains the rainfall probably varies between\r\n200 and 300 inches. In the Hawaiian forest-zone it would range probably\r\nbetween 100 and 200 inches, though this is probably exceeded in a few\r\nlocalities. In the Tahitian uplands it would doubtless exceed 100 inches\r\nand approach 150 inches.\r\n\r\n(8) Quite a different climate prevails on the lofty summits of Hawaii\r\n13,000 to 14,000 feet above the sea. Here the snow lies in winter, and\r\nthe mean annual temperature is only a few degrees above the freezing\r\npoint, probably about 36° F. The difference between the mean summer and\r\nwinter temperatures is very small, and does not exceed five or six\r\ndegrees. Water freezes here during nearly every night of the year. The\r\ndaily variation of temperature is very large, the average being probably\r\nabout thirty degrees. Great dryness of the air prevails, the average\r\nrelative humidity in August, 1897, being about 43 per cent. There is but\r\nlittle rain. The sun shines fiercely, and the sky is usually clear.\r\n\r\n(9) All Pacific climates are represented in the Hawaiian mountains, that\r\nof Fiji on the lower slopes, that of New Zealand half way up, and that\r\nof the Antarctic islands on the summits.\r\n\r\n(10) When contrasting the floras of Fiji, Tahiti, and Hawaii, it will be\r\nnecessary to restrict our comparison in the case of Hawaii to the lower\r\nslopes below 4,000 or 5,000 feet; and we should expect the Hawaiian\r\nmountain flora to be scantily represented in Tahiti, and scarcely at all\r\nin Fiji and Samoa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n        THE EPOCHS IN THE FLORAL HISTORY OF THE PACIFIC ISLANDS\r\n\r\n                            THE AGE OF FERNS\r\n\r\nThe epochs in the plant-stocking.—The age of ferns and lycopods.—The\r\n  relative proportion of vascular cryptogams in Hawaii, Fiji, and\r\n  Tahiti.—The large number of peculiar species in Hawaii.—The mountain\r\n  ferns of Hawaii.—The origin of peculiar species.—Dr. Hillebrand’s\r\n  views.—Their origin connected not with greater variety of climate in\r\n  Hawaii, but with isolation.—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Introductory Remarks_\r\n\r\nIN the endeavour to follow the various stages in the floral history of\r\nthe Pacific islands from the standpoint of plant-dispersal, a method is\r\nhere adopted which is not often employed. The usual mode of making a\r\ngeneral description of a flora is not intended to bring out its genesis\r\nin point of time. We describe the result of a long series of changes\r\ndating back to some unknown period, much as one might describe the\r\npresent condition of a people without reference to their history; and\r\nfor obvious reasons rarely is an effort made to differentiate the epochs\r\nof the stocking of the region with its plants. The difficulties\r\ninvesting such a task in the case of a region situated within a\r\ncontinental area would be almost insuperable. With the oceanic groups of\r\nthe Pacific such difficulties, though still very numerous, would at all\r\nevents be fewer in number and less formidable in appearance.\r\n\r\nTaking my cue from the well-known instance of Krakatoa, it is here\r\nassumed that the earliest epoch is connected with the arrival of the\r\ncryptogamic flora (ferns, mosses, lichens, &c.) through the agency of\r\nthe winds, and with the arrival of the littoral plants through the\r\nagency of the currents. The next era is represented by the genera now\r\npeculiar to each group, since it is implied that they have descended\r\nfrom the earliest phanerogams that established themselves in the group.\r\nThe following epoch, which ends only with the arrival of man, is\r\ncharacterised by the genera found outside the group; and here different\r\ndegrees of antiquity are indicated according as the genus is represented\r\nwholly or in part by peculiar species, or contains only species found in\r\nother regions. The following eight chapters will be devoted to the\r\ndevelopment of the method here briefly indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE AGE OF FERNS.\r\n\r\nIt was established by Dr. Treub in the case of Krakatoa that ferns and\r\nalgæ formed the earliest vegetation of this island after it had been\r\ncompletely stripped of all its plants in the great eruption of 1883. It\r\nis, therefore, but natural that the vascular cryptogams should first be\r\ndealt with in any discussion relating to the historical aspects of these\r\nfloras.\r\n\r\nIt has been before remarked that the epoch of ferns and lycopods, which\r\nbegan with the earliest stage in the island’s floral history, may be\r\nregarded as extending to our own day. It is thus implied that the\r\nvascular cryptogams of those early times are yet brought there, and\r\nthat, alike with the littoral plants, these ferns and lycopods have\r\nwitnessed almost unchanged the great revolutions that have marked the\r\nhistory of the inland flowering plants, more particularly those of the\r\nforest flora. This, as I will show, is true in Hawaii, though only in a\r\npartial sense in comparison with the other island-groups of Fiji and\r\nTahiti, since in Hawaii nearly half the ferns and lycopods are peculiar\r\nto that group, whilst in Fiji and Tahiti not more than 8 or 9 per cent.\r\nappear to be endemic. (Rarotonga, according to Cheeseman, possesses one\r\nnew species amongst its seventy-two ferns and lycopods, and probably in\r\nthis it is typical of the smaller elevated islands of Eastern\r\nPolynesia.)\r\n\r\nThe large proportion of peculiar Hawaiian species is the central fact in\r\nthe distribution of vascular cryptogams in the Hawaiian, Fijian, and\r\nTahitian archipelagoes, and indeed in the Pacific islands; and it is\r\naround this fact that much of the following discussion will lie. (For\r\nthe data relating to the Tahitian region, I have almost exclusively\r\nfollowed Drake del Castillo.)\r\n\r\nOn looking at the table given below, it will be noticed that whilst\r\nthere are about the same number of species of ferns and lycopods in the\r\nTahitian and Hawaiian islands there are at least half as many again in\r\nFiji. When we reflect that the total areas of the Fijian and Hawaiian\r\ngroups are in each case about 7,000 square miles and that the extent of\r\nthe whole Tahitian region does not amount to 2,000 square miles, these\r\nfacts acquire a fresh significance. Ferns and lycopods might, therefore,\r\nbe expected to figure more largely in the Tahitian flora than in those\r\nof Fiji and Hawaii; and this is indeed the case. When we examine the\r\nrelative proportion of the vascular cryptogams to the indigenous\r\nflowering plants in each area we find that whilst in Hawaii they form\r\nabout 18 per cent. of the total flora and in Fiji not much more than\r\nthis (see Note 62), in Tahiti they constitute just a third. This excess\r\nof vascular cryptogams is reflected in the flora of the outlying groups,\r\nthe proportion in Rarotonga being, according to Cheeseman, 30 per cent.\r\nIt is, therefore, evident that in comparison with the other groups\r\nTahiti possesses a marked preponderance in ferns and lycopods. In this\r\nrespect the Tahitian islands resemble those of Juan Fernandez, where\r\njudging from the data relating to the indigenous flora given in\r\nHemsley’s _Botany of the Challenger Expedition_, the proportion of\r\nvascular cryptogams amounts to between 30 and 38 per cent.\r\n\r\nBut it has been already implied that the proportion of endemic species\r\nof ferns and lycopods is from four to five times as large in Hawaii as\r\nit is in Tahiti or Fiji. In Hawaii, therefore, there has been a\r\nproduction of many new species, whilst in Fiji and Tahiti there has been\r\na great rush of immigrants. “Formative energy” in Hawaii (to adopt an\r\nexpression of Dr. Hillebrand) and “active colonisation” in Fiji and\r\nTahiti, such would appear to be the most conspicuous features in the\r\nhistory of the vascular cryptogams of these three archipelagoes.\r\n\r\nIn these floras it is, therefore, apparent that respecting the vascular\r\ncryptogams the average number of species in a genus does not supply a\r\nmeans of contrasting them. As indicated in the table, the fern and\r\nlycopod floras of Fiji and Hawaii are similar in this respect. Yet in\r\neach the average number of species to a genus has a separate\r\nsignificance. A genus may acquire its species through immigration, or\r\nthey may arise from its formative energy within the particular area. The\r\nfirst principle has been largely dominant in Fiji, the last in Hawaii,\r\nand the resemblance between the average number of species in a genus in\r\nthese two groups is to a large extent accidental. Between the vascular\r\ncryptogams of Fiji and Tahiti, however, such a comparison is legitimate;\r\nand since the average formative energy is in these groups about the\r\nsame, the difference is to be attributed to a lessened number of\r\nimmigrants into the Tahitian area.\r\n\r\n\r\n   TABLE OF VASCULAR CRYPTOGAMS (FERNS AND LYCOPODS) IN THE GROUPS OF\r\n                TAHITI, HAWAII, AND FIJI.

They lie in the track of the main line of migration\r\ninto and across the South Pacific, a track which has been followed by\r\nflowering plants and animals as well as by aboriginal man. Assuming that\r\nthe migration of the vascular cryptogams extended from Fiji eastward to\r\nTahiti, fewer of the immigrants would reach the last-named group. Fewer\r\nstill would reach the Hawaiian islands, which excluding the groups of\r\nlow coral islands to the southward are cut off on all sides, whether\r\nfrom the Fiji-Samoan and Tahitian areas, from the coasts of North\r\nAmerica, or from the regions north and west, by a breadth of ocean that\r\nis never less than 1,500 miles.\r\n\r\nThat the main track of the ferns and lycopods across the South Pacific\r\nto Tahiti has been eastward there can be little doubt. This is indicated\r\nin the tables given by Drake del Castillo for Eastern Polynesia, and\r\nalso by an analysis I have prepared of the distributions that he gives\r\nfor the species of the Tahitian region (see Note 64). Out of the 154\r\nspecies there are only two that belong exclusively to the American side\r\nof the Pacific; whilst 58 are derived exclusively from the Asiatic side,\r\nand mainly from Indo-Malaya. The drift of the ferns and lycopods\r\neastward from Fiji is also brought out in the number of Tahitian species\r\ncommon to Hawaii and Fiji. Of these about 76 per cent. are common to\r\nFiji or to the groups around, and only 30 per cent. occur in Hawaii. The\r\nTahitian species found in Hawaii occur also in Fiji with the exception\r\nof two or three mountain species which have doubtless failed to find a\r\nsuitable elevation in Fiji. These two or three mountain ferns and\r\nlycopods are probably the only vascular cryptogams possessed in common\r\nby Hawaii and Tahiti to the exclusion of other groups. (See Note 64.)\r\n\r\nThe prevailing Indo-Malayan origin of the ferns and lycopods of the\r\narchipelagoes of the Fijian area (Fiji, Tonga, Samoa) is so well\r\nestablished in the writings of Seemann, Baker, Hemsley, Christ, and\r\nBurkill that there is no necessity to enter into details here. That the\r\nstream of vascular cryptogams to Hawaii has proceeded mainly from the\r\nOld World side of the Pacific is shown in the circumstance that of the\r\neighty and odd species found outside the group nearly half are from the\r\nAsiatic side exclusively and only three from America alone, whilst about\r\na fourth occur in both continents, and a fourth are confined to\r\nPolynesia. One point, says Dr. Hillebrand, comes out in strong relief,\r\nand that is “the great number of ferns scattered over the long track\r\nwhich leads from the Hawaiian islands through Polynesia and Malaysia to\r\nthe east coast of tropical Africa.” But he adds significantly that “it\r\ncannot be inferred from this fact that all the species in question have\r\ntravelled eastward to find the terminus of their long migration on this\r\ngroup, unless the principle be established, that the formative energy of\r\na species or genus be greatest at the circumference or farthest\r\nextremity of its area” (p. 542).\r\n\r\nThough evidently prepared to admit the general eastward trend of plants\r\nin the Pacific, Dr. Hillebrand (p. xxviii) puts forward in the case of\r\nthe ferns the startling view that originally spores of a few simple\r\nspecies have been diffused over various countries and that they have\r\nthere evolved on parallel lines “predetermined by the structure of the\r\noriginal immigrant” a series of higher forms, so that the same form\r\nmight have been produced in two widely distant localities, as, for\r\ninstance, in Ceylon and Hawaii. The editor, Mr. W. F. Hillebrand, gives\r\ngood reasons for his belief that this does not represent the matured\r\nopinion of the author. It is, however, worth noting in this connection\r\nthat Dr. Karl Mueller has advanced a similar view with respect to the\r\nlower orders of plants. (See a translation of his paper in _Trans. and\r\nProc. N. Z. Inst._ Vol. 25.) Bearing in mind the known capacity of ferns\r\nfor dispersal by the winds, an hypothesis of this kind, even if\r\nestablished, seems scarcely needed in the study of fern-dispersal.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that many of the ferns and lycopods reached Hawaii\r\ndirectly and not through South Polynesia. The mountain-ferns of this\r\ngroup could hardly have been received by that route, since, as is shown\r\nbelow, they do not as a rule occur in that region.\r\n\r\nSome other interesting relations present themselves in connection with\r\nthe Hawaiian ferns and lycopods when we consider the distribution of its\r\nnon-endemic species in the other two groups of Fiji and Tahiti. Out of\r\nthese species, some eighty in all, not more than half are common to all\r\nthree groups, and about two dozen have not been found either in Fiji or\r\nin Tahiti. Of these last quite half are mountain species in Hawaii,\r\nhaving their station at elevations exceeding those of the highest\r\ndistricts of Fiji and of the several islands of the Tahitian area,\r\nexcepting the limited region comprised in the uplands of Tahiti itself.\r\n\r\nA glance at the list, given in Note 65 of some of the mountain ferns of\r\nHawaii not recorded from Fiji and Tahiti will show that these species\r\nare very widely distributed. Ferns and lycopods found in the Himalayas\r\nand in the Andes meet on the higher slopes of the lofty mountains of\r\nHawaii and in no other of the less elevated island-groups of the open\r\nPacific. This distribution of the vascular cryptogams thus foreshadows a\r\nprinciple that will come into prominence in the case of the flowering\r\nplants, namely, that difference in elevation has been an important\r\nfactor in determining some of the contrasts between the Hawaiian,\r\nFijian, and Tahitian floras. The contrasts here implied are those\r\nconnected with the climatic conditions of station, since several plants\r\nof temperate regions, such as Aspidium filix mas, Asplenium trichomanes,\r\nAsplenium adiantum nigrum, &c., that are at home in the highlands of\r\nHawaii, do not occur in either Fiji or Tahiti. We can infer that widely\r\nranging ferns and lycopods have been dispersed over the oceanic groups\r\nof the tropical Pacific with a fair degree of uniformity, and that any\r\nmarked contrasts in their distribution may be attributed to considerable\r\ndifferences in the altitude of the islands.\r\n\r\nIn appreciating such a conclusion, and in dealing with apparent\r\nexceptions to the rule, the relation between the vertical range of a\r\nspecies and its lateral distribution has to be considered. We find, for\r\ninstance, that whilst the Common Bracken (Pteris aquilina) is a mountain\r\nplant in Hawaii, it occurs also in Fiji and Tahiti. Since, however, it\r\nis found all over the temperate and tropical regions, and has a vertical\r\nrange in Hawaii of from 800 to 8,000 feet, any difficulty in this\r\nrespect is thus explained. Aspidium aculeatum, a characteristic fern of\r\ntemperate latitudes, seems at first to present a difficulty, which,\r\nhowever, proves to be more apparent than real. Whilst it has been\r\nrecorded from Hawaii at heights of 6,000 to 9,000 feet, and from Tahiti\r\nat 4,000 feet, it has also been found in Fiji and Samoa; but since it\r\nwas not collected by Seemann in Fiji, it can scarcely be common, and\r\nHorne seems only to have obtained it from the tops of mountains in Vanua\r\nLevu at an elevation of 1,800 feet.\r\n\r\nUp to this point the non-endemic ferns and lycopods have been chiefly\r\ndiscussed. We will now briefly deal with the probable cause of the\r\nrelative preponderance of peculiar or endemic species in Hawaii as\r\ncontrasted with Fiji and Tahiti. In this respect the Hawaiian islands,\r\nas remarked at the commencement of this chapter, come into sharp\r\ncontrast with the other two groups; but it would seem that the\r\ndifferentiation has rarely acquired a generic value (see Note 66). In\r\nthis respect the age of ferns is markedly distinguished from the\r\nsucceeding era, the age of the arborescent Compositæ and of\r\nTree-Lobelias, to which a large number of peculiar genera belong. This,\r\naccording to my view, is to be attributed to the circumstance that\r\nwhilst the dispersion of spores by the wind is probably as active in our\r\nown time as it was in the earliest stage of the floral history of\r\nHawaii, the dispersion of seeds by birds, to which the flowering plants\r\nin the main originally owe their presence in this group, has been\r\ngreatly influenced by the various changes that have affected the\r\nmigration of birds over the Pacific, a subject discussed in later pages.\r\n\r\nRespecting the origin of the species of ferns and lycopods peculiar to\r\nHawaii, it is first of importance to quote the remarks of Dr. Hillebrand\r\non the subject. Speaking of the whole flora (p. xxv), but evidently with\r\nthe ferns more especially in his mind, he says:—“Nature here luxuriates\r\nin formative energy. Is it because the islands offer a great range of\r\nconditions of life? Or is it because the leading genera are in their age\r\nof manhood, of greatest vigour? Or is it because the number of types\r\nwhich here come into play is limited, and, therefore, the area offered\r\nto their development comparatively great and varied?” It is deeply to be\r\nregretted that sickness and death intervened before the author was able\r\nto give to the world his matured views on the very important points here\r\nraised. Yet they are much the same questions that man is ever putting to\r\nthe life around him. There is the same querulous note that we find in\r\nall, the question that begins, the question that ends, and the reply\r\nthat never comes.\r\n\r\n“The evolution theory (writes Dr. Hillebrand, p. xxix) could hardly find\r\na more favourable field for observation than an isolated island-group in\r\nmid-ocean, large enough to have produced a number of original forms, and\r\nat the same time so diversified in conditions of temperature, humidity,\r\nand atmospheric currents as to admit an extraordinary development in\r\nnearly every direction of vegetable morphology, uninfluenced by\r\nintercrossing with foreign elements.” Isolation thus admittedly offers\r\nthe preliminary determining or favouring conditions. This is directly\r\nindicated by the fact that Hawaii possesses fewer genera of ferns and\r\nlycopods than either Fiji or Tahiti, notwithstanding that it has the\r\nsame area as Fiji, and is in extent three or four times the size of the\r\nwhole Tahitian area. One effect of isolation in Hawaii has, therefore,\r\nbeen greater room for the development of new forms. It has, however,\r\nalready been remarked that the islands of the Fijian area are much less\r\nisolated than those of the Hawaiian group, and that in consequence the\r\nfree immigration possible in the one group has been checked in the\r\nother. Fiji possesses in respect to vascular cryptogams at least half as\r\nmany species again as Hawaii, but Hawaii has three or four times the\r\nnumber of peculiar species. Yet before this great contrast can be\r\nascribed to different degrees of isolation, it is necessary to exclude\r\nanother possible cause presented by the greater range of life-conditions\r\nin Hawaii. It is possible that all the Hawaiian peculiar species may\r\nbelong to the higher levels, elevations, as before shown, not\r\nrepresented in the Fijian islands, which correspond only to the lowlands\r\nof Hawaii, that is, to levels below 4,000 feet. If this is the case, the\r\ncontrast between Fiji and Hawaii would be connected mainly with a\r\ndifference in life-conditions, and, however potent the isolating\r\ninfluences might have been in Hawaii, they could hardly have been\r\nconcerned with this striking difference.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine this point, I went carefully through the account\r\ngiven by Hillebrand of the Hawaiian ferns and lycopods, noting the\r\naltitudes there given, and making use of the maps and of my own local\r\nknowledge of the islands of Oahu and Hawaii, where the elevation is\r\nneither directly nor indirectly implied. As a result, I found that out\r\nof sixty-six endemic species available for my purpose, forty-seven had\r\ntheir stations at levels below 4,000 feet, that is in the region\r\ncorresponding to Fiji, and nineteen at elevations exceeding this height.\r\nThis, however, did not finally decide the question, since the proportion\r\nof endemic species may be much smaller in the region below 4,000 feet\r\nthan in that above it. I, therefore, went over the ground again, and\r\nfound, as shown in the table below, that the percentages of peculiar\r\nspecies amongst the total available for my use were not very far apart,\r\n58 per cent. for the upper region and 43 per cent. for the lower region.\r\n\r\n\r\n Distribution of the Hawaiian ferns and lycopods above and below 4,000\r\n                                 feet.\r\n\r\n +------------------------+-------+--------+----------------+\r\n |                        |Number.|Endemic.| Percentage of  |\r\n |                        |       |        |endemic species.|\r\n +------------------------+-------+--------+----------------+\r\n |Species below 4,000 feet|  110  |   47   |       43       |\r\n +------------------------+-------+--------+----------------+\r\n |Species above 4,000 feet|   33  |   19   |       58       |\r\n +------------------------+-------+--------+----------------+\r\n\r\nFrom the above it would appear that although the process of\r\nspecies-production in the Hawaiian islands has seemingly been rather\r\nmore active above than below 4,000 feet, if we were to compare the\r\nentire vascular cryptogamic flora of Fiji with that of the corresponding\r\nlower levels of the Hawaiian group we should obtain much the same\r\ncontrast in the proportion of peculiar species that we obtained when\r\ncomparing all the ferns and lycopods of both groups. In other words, if\r\nwe were to restrict our comparison with Fiji, and I may add Tahiti, to\r\nthat lower portion of Hawaii that corresponds in elevation, we should\r\nnot get results very different from those to be obtained by including\r\nthe Hawaiian upland regions as well.\r\n\r\nWe are, I think, on these grounds justified in assuming that the\r\nrelatively great development of new species of ferns and lycopods in\r\nHawaii as contrasted with Fiji is not to be connected with the greater\r\nelevation of those islands. The only thing that we have been able to\r\nassociate with the greater altitude of the Hawaiian Islands, and the\r\nconsequent greater range of climatic conditions, when contrasting the\r\nFijian and Hawaiian vascular cryptogams, is the occurrence of a number\r\nof peculiar mountain species and of wide-ranging temperate species that\r\nare found in the uplands of Hawaii, but not in the less elevated islands\r\nof Fiji.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, therefore, it is to be inferred that the greater display\r\nof formative power among the ferns and lycopods of the Hawaiian Islands\r\nis in great part to be associated with the isolation of this group as\r\ncompared with those of Fiji and Tahiti. The indications supplied by the\r\nvascular cryptogams resemble in kind those we shall obtain from the\r\nstudy of the flowering plants, but there is this important distinction.\r\nIn formative power, as shown in the development of new specific and\r\ngeneric types, the Hawaiian vascular cryptogams are far exceeded by the\r\nflowering plants where the proportion of endemic species amounts to 80\r\nper cent. We have no reason to believe that the winds, to which the\r\nferns and lycopods chiefly owe their dispersal, are less effective now\r\nin carrying their spores than they were in the earliest era of the\r\nfloral history of Hawaii or in the intervening periods. In the course of\r\nages the winds have been more uniform in their action as\r\nplant-dispersers even than the currents, and certainly far more than\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the case of the Hawaiian flowering plants that\r\ndepend on the varying influence of the migrant bird, the agency of\r\ndispersal has often been suspended altogether, and far greater\r\ndifferentiation or departure from the original type has resulted, the\r\namount of change often reaching to the value of a generic distinction.\r\nIt is a question, however, whether the isolation of the Hawaiian Islands\r\nis to be entirely connected with their mid-oceanic position. It will be\r\nshown in Chapter XXXIII. that effects almost as great have been produced\r\nin continental regions and in continental islands, and that the isolated\r\nsituation of Hawaii has not induced but has intensified these results.\r\nIn the later eras of plant-life a process of segregation has been ever\r\nactive throughout the tropical world whether in the case of an elevated\r\noceanic island or of a mid-continental mountain.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the principal points that have been emphasised\r\nin the foregoing discussion of the ferns and lycopods of the Hawaiian,\r\nFijian, and Tahitian Islands:—\r\n\r\n(_a_) In all three groups the vascular cryptogams (ferns and lycopods)\r\nhave been largely supplied from the warmer regions of the Old World. But\r\nwhilst in the South Pacific the migration has been mainly from Fiji\r\neastward to Tahiti, it is probable that Hawaii in the North Pacific has\r\nbeen in part independently stocked.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Whilst in Hawaii many peculiar species of ferns and lycopods have\r\nbeen developed, in Fiji and Tahiti there have been comparatively few.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Whilst there has been more or less free immigration into Fiji and\r\nTahiti there has been comparative isolation in Hawaii. Though the areas\r\nof the Fijian and Hawaiian archipelagoes are about the same, Fiji\r\npossesses at least half as many species again as Hawaii; but Hawaii owns\r\nthree or four times the number of peculiar species.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Though the land-area of the Tahitian region does not exceed a\r\nfourth part of that of Hawaii, it has the same number of species. The\r\nTahitian islands therefore display a predominance of ferns and lycopods.\r\n\r\n(_e_) The non-effective influence of the greater elevation of the\r\nHawaiian Islands on its preponderance of peculiar species is shown by\r\ncomparing all the ferns and lycopods of the Fijian and Tahitian Islands\r\nwith those of the corresponding lower levels of the Hawaiian Islands,\r\nwhen we find much the same contrast exhibited in the number of peculiar\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n(_f_) Whilst a large proportion of the ferns and lycopods are common to\r\nall three groups, Hawaii possesses a number of mountain species, widely\r\ndistributed in temperate regions and on the higher levels of mountainous\r\nareas in the tropics, that are not found either in Fiji or in Tahiti.\r\nTheir absence from these two groups is due to the insufficient elevation\r\nof the islands and to the non-existence there of extensive areas of any\r\naltitude.\r\n\r\n(_g_) The agency of the winds in dispersing the spores of ferns and\r\nlycopods has been relatively uniform through the ages when compared with\r\nthe varying agency of the migrant bird, to which the flowering plants\r\nmainly owe their distribution. Thus it is that in the Pacific islands\r\nthe vascular cryptogams have experienced much less differentiation than\r\nthe flowering plants, though as a rule far older denizens of the\r\nislands. Yet we cannot doubt that the same principle has been at work in\r\nboth cases, the difference arising in the instance of the flowering\r\nplants from the interrupted and often suspended agency of birds in the\r\nwork of dispersal.\r\n\r\n(_h_) It is a question whether there is not something more concerned in\r\nthe isolation of the Hawaiian group than its mid-oceanic position, since\r\neffects almost as great have been produced in continental regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n                    THE ERAS OF THE FLOWERING PLANTS\r\n\r\n                         THE AGE OF COMPOSITÆ.\r\n\r\nThe islands of the tropical Pacific as the homes of new genera and new\r\n  species.—The significance of a large endemic element.—Synopsis of the\r\n  eras.—The era of endemic genera.—The endemic genera of\r\n  Compositæ.—Their affinities and mode of dispersal.—The mystery of the\r\n  suspension of the dispersing agencies.—Mr. Bentham’s views.—The\r\n  remnant of an ancient Composite flora in the tropical Pacific.—The\r\n  dispersion of the Compositæ antedates the emergence of the\r\n  island-groups of the Fijian region at the close of the Tertiary\r\n  period.—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\n              _The Endemism of the Pacific Island Floras._\r\n\r\nAS far as the production of new species is concerned, the Hawaiian group\r\npresents the same contrast with the Fijian and Tahitian groups in\r\nrespect of the flowering plants that it does as regards the ferns and\r\nlycopods. The proportion of endemic species, after excluding all\r\nintroduced plants, is in Hawaii 80 per cent., in Fiji about 50 per\r\ncent., and in Tahiti 35 per cent. (see Table A). The same contrast is\r\nalso displayed in the number of peculiar genera. In Hawaii there are,\r\naccording to Dr. Hillebrand, 37 or 38, and in Fiji Dr. Seemann\r\ndiscovered 16; whilst, as we learn from Drake del Castillo, there are\r\nonly 3 or 4 in the Tahitian Islands. (As will be pointed out later on,\r\nthese numbers for Fiji and Hawaii have to be reduced, but the general\r\ninference to be drawn from them is not materially affected; see Table\r\nB.)\r\n\r\nBut if we look at the accompanying table (Table B) we notice that the\r\nflora of Hawaii is sharply contrasted with those of Fiji and Tahiti not\r\nonly in the large proportion of endemic genera, but also in the large\r\nnumber of non-endemic genera with peculiar species, and in the small\r\nproportion of genera possessing no peculiar species. There is an endemic\r\nelement of greater or less degree in about 70 per cent. of the Hawaiian\r\ngenera, whilst in Fiji only about 53 per cent. and in Tahiti as few as\r\n34 per cent. of the genera contain to a varying extent peculiar species.\r\nAnother feature brought out in this table is the relative poverty of\r\ngenera in the Hawaiian Islands. Fiji, though about the same size as\r\nHawaii, contains nearly half as many genera again, whilst the islands of\r\nthe Tahitian region, which in the aggregate amount to only one-third or\r\none-fourth of the area of the islands of Hawaii, possess nearly as many\r\ngenera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      TABLE A (FLOWERING PLANTS).\r\n\r\n _Proportions of Endemic Species in the Hawaiian, Fijian, and Tahitian\r\n                           floras, with those\r\n                for Samoa, Tonga, and Rarotonga added._\r\n\r\n +---------+------------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n | Groups. |Number of species.|   Number of    | Percentage of  |\r\n |         |                  |endemic species.|endemic species.|\r\n +---------+------------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n | Hawaii  |        686       |       546      |       80       |\r\n |         |                  |                |                |\r\n |  Fiji   |    {S. 617       |      {288      |      {47       |\r\n |         |    {H.1086       |      {620      |      {57       |\r\n |         |                  |                |                |\r\n | Tahiti  |        315       |       112      |       35       |\r\n +---------+------------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n |  Samoa  |        326       |       110      |       34       |\r\n |         |                  |                |                |\r\n |  Tonga  |        285       |        17      |        6       |\r\n |         |                  |                |                |\r\n |Rarotonga|        140       |        17      |       12       |\r\n | Island  |                  |                |                |\r\n +---------+------------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n\r\n_Remarks._—The materials for this table have been obtained from the\r\nworks of Hillebrand for Hawaii, Seemann and Horne for Fiji, Drake del\r\nCastillo for Tahiti, Reinecke for Samoa, Hemsley and Burkill for Tonga,\r\nand Cheeseman for Rarotonga. The two estimates for Fiji are marked S.\r\nfor Seemann and H. for Horne, the last being a rough preliminary\r\ncomputation made by Horne himself.\r\n\r\nThe results given are only to be considered as approximations liable to\r\nemendation, but as regards the proportion of endemic species in the\r\nseveral groups they no doubt illustrate fairly well the relative degree\r\nof endemism in the various archipelagoes. The results for Samoa, Tonga,\r\nand Rarotonga are merely added in order to enable a comparison to be\r\nmade with sub-groups of a region and with solitary islands, the\r\nHawaiian, Fijian, and Tahitian groups being regarded as the three\r\nprincipal centres of plant-life in the open Pacific.\r\n\r\nAll plants introduced by the aborigines and the white man are excluded.\r\nIn so doing, I have mainly followed Seemann, a safe guide in all matters\r\nrelating to weeds and to cultivated plants. The flora of a Pacific\r\nisland thus treated undergoes serious diminution in its extent. In the\r\ncase of the Rarotonga flora, for example, which according to Cheeseman\r\nincludes about 260 flowering plants, the number of truly indigenous\r\nplants, in the sense here implied, is only 140.

Horne discovered, according to Hemsley, no new\r\ngenera, but several genera from outside regions were added to the Fijian\r\nflora. Taking them as twenty-five (two-thirds of his own computation), I\r\nhave apportioned them as in Seemann’s results. The Tahitian region here\r\nincludes Eastern Polynesia.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary before proceeding further to obtain a correct idea of\r\nthe significance of a large endemic element in the phanerogamic flora of\r\na Pacific archipelago. We have therefore at the outset to inquire\r\nwhether it is indicative of isolation or of antiquity. If the number of\r\npeculiar genera is to be regarded as the test of the relative antiquity\r\nof different Pacific floras and, by implication, of the islands to which\r\nthey belong, these three groups, as shown in Table B, would arrange\r\nthemselves in the following order, namely, Hawaii, Fiji, Tahiti. This\r\ntest might be reliable if the several groups were in the same condition\r\nof isolation. Since, however, as we have previously seen, the Fijian\r\nIslands still enjoy a fairly free communication with the islands\r\nwestward, whilst the Hawaiian group is largely cut off, it is apparent\r\nthat the tendency to generic differentiation in Fiji might have been\r\noften swamped by immigration, and that Fiji with its much smaller number\r\nof endemic genera may even be older than Hawaii. This objection does not\r\napply quite as forcibly to a comparison between Hawaii and Tahiti, yet\r\nfor reasons before given it may be regarded as sufficient to negative\r\nany inferences concerned with relative antiquity.\r\n\r\nOn account, therefore, of the great differences in the degree of\r\nisolation of these three groups, we cannot be guided in our estimation\r\nof the relative antiquity of their floras by their number of peculiar\r\ngenera. With the evidence at our disposal we are compelled to accept the\r\nview, which indeed a single glance at a map would suggest, that the\r\nnumber or proportion of endemic genera is to be connected with the\r\ndegree of isolation. Whether a parallelism can be traced in the original\r\nstocking of these groups with their earliest flowering-plants is a\r\nmatter that can only be elucidated by a further analysis of the peculiar\r\ngenera.\r\n\r\n\r\n SYNOPSIS OF THE ERAS OF THE FLOWERING PLANTS IN THE TROPICAL PACIFIC.\r\n\r\nA. _The Era of the Endemic Genera._—Mostly American in their affinities.\r\nRepresented particularly by Compositæ and Lobeliaceæ.\r\n\r\n B. _The Era of Non-Endemic Genera._\r\n\r\n  (1) The mountain genera, either cosmopolitan in temperate latitudes or\r\n  derived from the New Zealand or the Antarctic flora. Mostly\r\n  represented in Hawaii.\r\n\r\n  (2) The genera forming the low-level flora of Hawaii below 4,000 or\r\n  5,000 feet and composing almost the entire floras of the Fijian and\r\n  Tahitian regions. Predominantly Indo-Malayan.\r\n\r\n   (_a_) The age of general dispersal over the tropical Pacific, the\r\n   genera with only peculiar species being first treated, and afterwards\r\n   those possessing a non-endemic element.\r\n\r\n   (_b_) The age of local dispersal over the tropical Pacific.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE FIRST ERA OF THE FLOWERING PLANTS, BEING THE AGE OF THE ENDEMIC\r\n                                GENERA.\r\n\r\nWith the above preliminary remarks I pass on to the next stage in the\r\nhistory of the stocking of these islands with their plants. The age of\r\nthe ferns and lycopods is left behind, and it is assumed that the next\r\nera is mainly indicated by those genera of phanerogams that are now\r\npeculiar to their respective groups. In this connection by far the most\r\ninteresting of the three regions, the Hawaiian, the Tahitian or East\r\nPolynesian, and the Fijian, is that of Hawaii, which, as before\r\nobserved, is distinguished from the groups of the Fijian and Tahitian\r\nregions, or, in other words, from all the oceanic archipelagoes of the\r\ntropical Pacific, by its large number of endemic genera.\r\n\r\nPeculiar genera of shrubby and arborescent Compositæ and of arborescent\r\nLobeliaceæ form the most striking characteristics of the endemic genera,\r\nand therefore of the ancient flora of Hawaii. It is in this connection\r\nof singular interest to remark that of the three endemic genera of the\r\nTahitian flora one is an arborescent genus of the Compositæ, and the\r\nother two are shrubby genera of the Lobeliaceæ. There are, therefore,\r\nindications here of an ancient insular flora of the Pacific,\r\ncharacterised mainly by the prevalence of Compositæ and Lobeliaceæ. It\r\nis, however, remarkable that not only are no endemic genera of these\r\norders known from Fiji or from the adjacent groups of Samoa and Tonga,\r\nbut that the Lobeliaceæ are not represented at all, whilst amongst the\r\nFijian Compositæ, with the exception of Lagenophora, the genera display\r\nno endemic element as far as the data at my disposal indicate.\r\n\r\nThe problem we are brought face to face with is clearly stated by Mr.\r\nHemsley in the _Introduction to the Botany of the Challenger Expedition_\r\n(p. 68). “In Polynesia as elsewhere,” he remarks, “the Compositæ more\r\nparticularly are perplexing to the botanical geographer, for although\r\nthey have their greatest affinities in America, as well as the\r\nsub-arboreous Lobeliaceæ, so numerous in the Sandwich Islands, yet the\r\nbulk of the vegetation seems to have been derived from the\r\nAustralo-Asiatic region.”\r\n\r\nIn attempting to approach this problem I do so from the standpoint of\r\ndispersal. There are so many intricate questions bound up with the\r\nsystematic position of these genera that in dealing with them the\r\nstudent of plant-distribution would require the capacities and\r\nopportunities of the eminent botanist who dealt with the distribution of\r\nten thousand species of Compositæ. On such ground, therefore, and only\r\nunder the guidance of others, I will lightly tread.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE ENDEMIC GENERA OF COMPOSITÆ.\r\n\r\nOn account of their endemic character the peculiar genera of Compositæ\r\nare regarded as belonging to the oldest era of the flowering plants of\r\nthe island-groups lying in the tropical latitudes of the open Pacific.\r\nThis is the view of Bentham, but it is, of course, the opinion that most\r\nbotanists would arrive at with the facts before them. With the exception\r\nof the solitary Tahitian genus Fitchia, they are all restricted to the\r\nHawaiian Islands, and nearly all are either shrubby or arborescent, the\r\ngreatest height of 25 to 30 feet being attained in the Tahitian genus\r\nand in Hesperomannia of Hawaii.\r\n\r\nNine Hawaiian genera are included in this era, though, strictly\r\nspeaking, we ought only to concern ourselves with the six genera, Remya,\r\nArgyroxiphium, Wilkesia, Dubautia, Raillardia, and Hesperomannia, since\r\nthe other three, Tetramolopium, Lipochæta, and Campylotheca, are only on\r\nthe borderland of generic distinction. It is, however, necessary that we\r\nshould include these three genera in our treatment of the Hawaiian\r\nendemic genera, more especially because they appear to have been the\r\nlast arrivals of the early Compositæ. They still display, as shown\r\nbelow, a very suggestive connection with the land of their birth, a\r\ncircumstance that is of much importance in finally determining the\r\nsource of the other strictly endemic genera, where the links with their\r\noriginal homes have been in most cases largely severed.\r\n\r\nIt would, however, be quite out of place here to enter into any details\r\ninto the affinities of these Hawaiian genera of Compositæ, and I will\r\nlimit myself here to such general conclusions as may be derived from the\r\npages of Bentham, Hillebrand, Hemsley, and other writers, and such as\r\nare in accordance with the facts of distribution given in the _Index\r\nKewensis_. Most ancient of all are the genera Remya, Argyroxiphium,\r\nWilkesia, and Hesperomannia, which, although belonging to tribes that\r\nonly occur on the American continent, as in the Mexican region, stand\r\nquite isolated, and, as Dr. Hillebrand remarks, probably belong to the\r\noldest denizens of the Hawaiian Islands. It is noteworthy that these\r\nfour ancient genera only contain two species apiece, a circumstance that\r\nfavours their priority in point of age.\r\n\r\nThe American affinities, however, are not always of the character that\r\nwe might have expected. Thus, it was remarked by Mr. Bentham that\r\nalthough the tribe Mutisiaceæ attains a great development in South\r\nAmerica, and especially in Chile, its only representative in the Pacific\r\nislands is the very rare arboreous Hesperomannia of Hawaii.\r\n\r\nRather less isolated in character, and we would presume therefore of\r\nsomewhat less antiquity, are the two closely allied genera of Raillardia\r\nand Dubautia, which have a close relative in Raillardella of the Sierra\r\nNevada in California. Then we come to the three genera, Tetramolopium,\r\nLipochæta, and Campylotheca, that, being still in touch with the world\r\noutside, may be regarded as the latest arrivals of the early genera of\r\nthe Compositæ. Tetramolopium, concerning which botanists were unable to\r\nagree, would seem, according to the _Index Kewensis_, to possess Mexican\r\nand Ecuadorian as well as Hawaiian species. Lipochæta, nearly related to\r\nother American genera, contains a dozen species, of which eleven are\r\nfound only in Hawaii, whilst the twelfth occurs, according to the _Index\r\nKewensis_, in California, and, according to Dr. Hillebrand, in the\r\nGalapagos group. Of the generic value of Campylotheca there seems a\r\ndoubt, and its distinctness is scarcely recognised in the _Index\r\nKewensis_. It is, however, closely allied to Coreopsis, an American\r\ngenus represented, according to Drake del Castillo, in the Marquesas.\r\n\r\nIn the Tahitian region, that is to say in Eastern Polynesia, the genus\r\nFitchia alone belongs to the early age of the Compositæ, so\r\ncharacteristic of Hawaii. Indications of the former widespread range of\r\nthe genus over this region of the South Pacific are afforded by its\r\nbeing now represented by two species in Tahiti and by one species in\r\nRarotonga, localities nearly 700 miles apart. It was thus regarded by\r\nBentham, who saw in it a solitary remnant of the ancient South Pacific\r\nflora. Like the Hawaiian genera, as shown below, it is often restricted\r\nto the higher levels. Botanists differ about its affinities, and a\r\ndiscussion of the subject will be found on pages 20 and 66 of the\r\n_Introduction to the Botany of the Challenger Expedition_.\r\n\r\nThe restriction of these ancient genera of the Polynesian Compositæ to\r\nthe upland regions is of some interest. “The preponderance of Compositæ\r\namong the high-level plants obtains almost throughout the world.” This\r\nobservation was made by Mr. Hemsley in connection with the flora of the\r\nhighlands of Tibet (_Journ. Linn. Soc. Bot._ vol. 35, 1902), where the\r\nCompositæ constitute about 19 per cent. of the flowering plants; and I\r\nmay remark in passing that, according to Mr. Ball, one of the most\r\nconspicuous elements in point of frequency in the higher flora of the\r\nGreat Atlas is presented by the Compositæ which make up between 12 and\r\n13 per cent. of the whole flora (Hooker and Ball’s _Marocco and the\r\nGreat Atlas_). This feature of alpine floras is brought into great\r\nprominence in Schimper’s recent book on Plant Geography.\r\n\r\nSome of the most lasting reminiscences that the naturalist will bear\r\naway with him from the highlands of Hawaii are connected with the\r\nCompositæ. Those who have ascended the mountains of Mauna Kea and Mauna\r\nLoa, will remember that amongst the last plants occurring above the\r\nforest zone, and scattered about on the ancient lava fields at\r\nelevations exceeding 10,000 feet above the sea, are species of\r\nRaillardia and the beautiful “Ahinahina” (Argyroxiphium). It is,\r\nhowever, in the open, scantily wooded region, elevated 6,000 to 9,000\r\nfeet, and lying between the true forest zone below and the bare lava\r\nslopes above, that the shrubby and arborescent Compositæ of the large\r\nisland of Hawaii are most at home. Such regions, as Hillebrand well\r\ndescribes (p. xxiv), are characterised by stunted trees, chiefly\r\nSophora, Cyathodes, Myoporum, and others, associated with arborescent\r\nRaillardiæ of the order of Compositæ. Between them luxuriate other\r\nshrubby Compositæ of the genera Raillardia, Dubautia, Campylotheca, and\r\nArtemisia, together with Strawberries, Raspberries, and species of\r\nVaccinium.\r\n\r\nBotanists have not given us much account of the associates of the\r\ninteresting genus Fitchia on the uplands of Tahiti. We learn, however,\r\nfrom Nadeaud that in his time these Composite trees and shrubs were\r\nspread over the higher region of the island of Tahiti above 800 and\r\n1,000 metres. Cheeseman, to whom we are indebted for the discovery and\r\nthe description of the Rarotongan species, tells us that this tree,\r\nwhich attains a height of 25 feet in the sheltered valleys, and is much\r\ndwarfed on the exposed ridges and hill-tops, often forms the greater\r\npart of the forest above 500 feet, and reaches the highest peaks of the\r\nisland (2,250 feet).\r\n\r\nIn discussing the probable mode of dispersal of these early Composite\r\nplants of the Pacific we shall be treading on somewhat debatable ground.\r\nWe will, however, point out that the mere possession of structures that\r\ncould be utilised for dispersal of the seeds is not the only important\r\nquestion here involved. If we could demonstrate that all these genera\r\npossess exceptional capacities for distribution over the ocean, we\r\nshould prove too much, since the process has been in the main suspended\r\nfor ages. If, on the other side, it could be shown that their fruits are\r\nnot at all suited for such dispersal, we should prove too little, since\r\nthe ancestors of these genera must have been transported to these\r\nislands in some fashion or other. This clearly indicates that other\r\nimportant factors have also come into play in determining the\r\ndistribution of the early Compositæ of the Pacific islands.\r\n\r\nIt was long ago pointed out by De Candolle that the possession of a\r\npappus does not, as a rule, increase the area of a Composite plant,\r\nalthough as regards hooks and barbed appendages, such as occur in\r\nBidens, the greater areas of the plants thus provided may be, as he\r\nthought, in some measure explained. Even in respect to hooks and barbs\r\nit would be easy to point to cases where, as Bentham remarks, unusual\r\npowers of adherence are by no means indicative of wide dispersal in all\r\ncases. In any event it will be also incumbent on us to explain why these\r\ngenera no longer possess facilities for distribution. This suspension of\r\nthe means of dispersal is not, however, peculiar to the age of the\r\nendemic genera of the Pacific islands. It is a character but in a less\r\ndegree of the succeeding age, the age of genera found outside the group,\r\nbut represented within it by endemic species; and from this we may\r\nsuspect that we have had in operation in the Pacific an influence,\r\nfar-reaching both in time and space, to which the agencies of dispersal\r\nhave been compelled to adapt themselves, an influence which has acted as\r\na distributor of the distributing agencies.\r\n\r\nComing to the fitness for dispersal of the achenes of the early\r\nComposite genera of the Pacific islands, it will be assumed that they\r\nhave been, as a general rule, transported in birds’ plumage. The fruits\r\nare usually 2·5 to 12 millimetres (1/16 to 1/2 inch) in length, and are\r\nprovided either with a pappus of soft or stiff bristles, or with awns or\r\nteeth, but these appendages vary much in size in the different genera\r\nand in different species of the same genus. The instance of Lipochæta is\r\nespecially significant as indicating the alterations which the\r\nappendages of the achene may have undergone in the cases of other\r\ngenera. With most species there are usually two or three teeth or short\r\nawns, but in some species these are obsolete, and in others they are\r\nlong and stout.\r\n\r\nBearing these facts in mind we should hesitate to rely too much on the\r\npresent condition of the achenes in the other genera as an indication of\r\nthe fitness for dispersal of the fruits of their ancestors. In one\r\ngenus, Campylotheca, which may be regarded as among the youngest of the\r\ngenera, the achenes are provided with barbed or hooked awns which cause\r\nthem to adhere as tenaciously to one’s clothes as in the case of those\r\nof Bidens, an allied genus. In Fitchia, the Tahitian genus, which may be\r\nlooked upon as one of the oldest of the Pacific genera of Compositæ, the\r\nachene is furnished with two long awns or setæ, which, as Drake del\r\nCastillo observes, recall those of Bidens. The achenes of the other\r\nHawaiian genera, as regards their fitness for dispersal in plumage, may\r\nbe said to give less definite indications. In some, as in Dubautia and\r\nRaillardia, there is a typical pappus of ten to twenty long hair-like\r\nbristles. In others again, as in Wilkesia and Argyroxiphium, the pappus\r\nis much reduced, and in some species of Lipochæta it is, as above\r\nremarked, quite obsolete.\r\n\r\nThe chances of the achenes of the parent plants having in some cases\r\nbeen originally transported to the islands in the plumage of birds would\r\nbe increased by a bird making its nest of the plant-materials or amongst\r\nthe plants themselves, or by its pecking at the fruit-heads. In our own\r\ntime different species of the grouse family on the slopes of the\r\nCalifornian and Columbian mountains make their nests on the ground under\r\nthe shade of Artemisia bushes and find a portion of their sustenance in\r\ntheir fruits. Artemisias also form one of the features of the vegetation\r\nof the Hawaiian uplands; but since they present only specific\r\ndifferentiation they are referred to a later era. Yet it will be on the\r\nslopes of the Rocky Mountains and of the Californian Sierra Nevada,\r\namongst the “sage-brush” and the grouse, that we may have to stand when\r\nwe look in thought across the Pacific towards far distant Hawaii and ask\r\nourselves whence came its tree-like Raillardias, its shrubby Dubautias,\r\nits tall Wilkesias, and the silvery Ahinahinas (Argyroxiphium).\r\n\r\nIt is possible that in some genera the achenes have, or had, a means of\r\nadhering to plumage through a “sticky” secretion, such as is sometimes\r\nfound with Lagenophora, an Hawaiian genus of the next era, and also with\r\nthe weed-plant Adenostemma viscosum; but this is a point that has not\r\nyet been investigated. Nor can we altogether exclude the chance of the\r\nachenes having in some cases been transported unharmed to Hawaii in a\r\nbird’s stomach. The possibility of this has been above implied in the\r\ncase of Artemisia; and it is pointed out in Chapter XXXIII. that pigeons\r\nin Hawaii feed sometimes on the achenes of Compositæ. The Hawaiian goose\r\n(Bernicla sandwicensis) lives, according to Mr. Dole, on Sonchus asper,\r\nan introduced plant, as well as on berries (Wilson’s _Aves\r\nHawaiiensis_). There are numerous references of this nature in books\r\nabout birds, and it should always be remembered that birds in pecking at\r\nthe fruit-heads scatter the seeds on their feathers. (See Note 67.)\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing remarks it may, I think, be inferred that the achenes\r\nof the ancestors of the original Composite genera of the Pacific islands\r\nwere in all probability not unfitted for transport by birds, more\r\nespecially in their plumage. Some of my readers, however, may express a\r\ndoubt as to whether birds likely to disperse seeds would be found in any\r\nnumbers at the great heights where some of the continental Compositæ\r\noccur. But it is well known that birds of the grouse and partridge\r\nfamily frequent high levels in continental regions over much of the\r\nglobe. Arborescent Compositæ are found at heights of 10,000 to 14,000\r\nfeet on the mountains of Central Africa; and it should be noticed that\r\nSir Harry Johnston observed “francolins” on the slopes of Ruwenzori up\r\nto 13,000 feet (_Uganda Protectorate_, vol. 1; _Trans. Linn. Soc. Bot._,\r\nSer. II. vol. 2). Sir Martin Conway in the Bolivian Andes found geese,\r\nducks, gulls, snipe, &c., numerous in suitable places up to 17,000 feet\r\n(_Journ. Roy. Geogr. Soc._, 1899); whilst geese and teal were noticed by\r\nSir Joseph Hooker and others at elevations of 17,000 feet in the\r\nmountains of Tibet (Hooker’s _Himalayan Journals_; _Journ. Linn. Soc.\r\nBot._, vol. 35, p. 147). These are all birds, as shown in Chapter\r\nXXXIII., that are likely to disperse plants, and probably none more\r\neffectually than the goose, of which Hawaii possesses a particular\r\nvariety or species. It may be remarked that geese, ducks, gulls, and\r\nother birds use Cotula plumosa in Kerguelen for making their nests (Dr.\r\nKidder quoted by Mr. Dixon in his book on Birds’ Nests).\r\n\r\nSea-birds were probably the principal agents in carrying the achenes of\r\nthe early genera of the Compositæ to Hawaii. Dr. Hillebrand attached\r\nimportance to the tropic-bird (Phaethon) in the distribution of species\r\n(Introd., p. 30); and since these birds breed at the crater of Kilauea\r\nin Hawaii, 4,000 feet above the sea, and also high up in Tahiti\r\n(Moseley), its agency is not unlikely, I am inclined to think, however,\r\nthat birds like the petrels and puffins, that in nesting burrow in the\r\nground, choosing places where the vegetation is thickest, and where they\r\nwould be likely to get seeds on their feathers, would be more efficient\r\nagents. This is the view expressed by Prof. Moseley in Wallace’s _Island\r\nLife_, p. 250. He considered that albatrosses, petrels, and puffins have\r\nplayed a great part in the distribution of plants, and to some degree\r\nespecially account for the otherwise difficult fact that widely distant\r\nislands in tropical seas have similar mountain plants. Birds, he says,\r\nthat in high latitudes, as at Tristan da Cunha and Kerguelen, often\r\nburrow near the sea-level, in the tropics choose the mountains for their\r\nnesting-place; and he refers to a puffin that nests on the top of one of\r\nthe high mountains of Viti Levu at an altitude of 4,000 feet, to a\r\npetrel nesting among ferns at Tahiti at an elevation of 4,400 feet, and\r\nto another petrel breeding in like manner in the high mountains of\r\nJamaica at a height of several thousand feet above the sea. He gives\r\npoint to these interesting remarks, which might be supplemented by data\r\nfrom other parts of the world, by observing that it is not necessary\r\nthat the same species should now cover the range of the plants\r\nconcerned. The ancestor of the species might have carried the seeds, and\r\nthe range of the genus is alone sufficient. It may be added that, as I\r\nhave shown in Chapter XXXIII., sea-birds have been far more active\r\nagents in the distribution of plants than many people might imagine. The\r\nmore recent observations of Ekstam in Spitzbergen have thrown\r\nconsiderable light on this subject.\r\n\r\nHaving in the first place formed the opinion that the achenes of the\r\nearly Hawaiian Compositæ are suited for dispersal by birds, and then\r\nshown that sea-birds were probably the principal agents, we are met with\r\nthe curious difficulty that in the case of the early Hawaiian genera of\r\nCompositæ the complete suspension for ages of the means of dispersal is\r\ninvolved in the circumstances that these genera are confined to the\r\nHawaiian group. We can attribute to the agency of existing sea-birds the\r\noccurrence of the genus Lagenophora in the uplands of Hawaii, on the\r\nmountain-tops of Fiji, and in Australia and New Zealand; but the agency\r\nof birds as at present in operation does not assist us except indirectly\r\nin the case of the genera restricted to Hawaii or to Tahiti. Is it\r\npossible, we may inquire, to penetrate this mystery? Why, we may ask\r\nwith Mr. Hemsley, has the agency ceased acting, and why have its\r\noperations been confined to the conveyance of seeds _to_ the islands and\r\nnot _from_ the islands as well (_Intr. Bot. Chall. Exped._, p. 66)? I\r\nneed scarcely add that the same question presents itself with all the\r\nother peculiar genera of these islands, and in fact with endemic genera\r\nall over the world. What can be stranger, it may be remarked, than the\r\nlimited distribution of the Pandanaceous genus Sararanga in the Western\r\nPacific, although suited for dispersal by frugivorous birds. This is\r\nnot, indeed, a special difficulty connected with oceanic islands; it\r\napplies to the whole plant-world; yet it is possible that, as it is\r\nexhibited by the Compositæ in these islands, we may be in a better\r\nposition to grapple with the problem. But before doing so it will be\r\nrequisite to look a little closer at these early Hawaiian genera of the\r\nCompositæ.\r\n\r\nThe distribution within the archipelago of the genera and species of the\r\nearly Compositæ of Hawaii is worthy of notice from the light it throws,\r\nnot only on the relative antiquity of the genera, but also on the\r\nsubsequent conditions of isolation. Of the nine genera here referred to\r\nfive are distributed over most of the islands of the group. These\r\ninclude all the genera possessing a number of species, namely,\r\nTetramolopium with seven species, Lipochæta with eleven, Campylotheca\r\nwith twelve, Dubautia with six, and Raillardia with twelve species. Of\r\nthe four genera remaining all have only two species, and are restricted\r\nto two or three islands, Remya and Wilkesia being in both cases found in\r\nKauai and Maui, whilst Argyroxiphium is confined to the adjacent islands\r\nof Maui and Hawaii, and Hesperomannia to those of Oahu, Lanai, and Maui.\r\nThese four genera that are restricted to only two or three islands are\r\nthe same before referred to as regarded by Hillebrand as the oldest,\r\npartly on account of their isolated generic position, and partly because\r\nin each case they only possess two species.\r\n\r\nAlthough the early Hawaiian Compositæ were evidently originally\r\ntransported to most of the islands of the group, it is noteworthy that\r\ntheir subsequent isolation from the rest of the world has in the later\r\nages been repeated within the limits of the archipelago. Of the 56\r\nspecies, all of which are now endemic, 28, or just half, as shown in the\r\ntable on the following page, are confined to a single island. Of the\r\nremainder, almost all are restricted to two or three adjacent islands.\r\nHillebrand gives only a solitary species, Lipochæta connata, as\r\noccurring in all the islands. This suspension, to a great extent, of the\r\nmeans of dispersal between the islands is also strikingly illustrated by\r\nthe Lobeliaceæ.\r\n\r\nWe have only to mention the flora of Fiji and those of the adjacent\r\ngroups of Samoa and Tonga to exclude them from any share in the early\r\nera of the Compositæ in the Pacific. The prevailing adventitious\r\ncharacter of the Fijian Compositæ is indicated in the fact that the\r\nspecies of the majority of the genera are included by Seemann in his\r\nlist of Fijian weeds. There are only one or two Fijian Compositæ, such\r\nas the mountain species of Lagenophora and the littoral species of\r\nWedelia, that merit the special attention of the student of dispersal.\r\nSo also with Samoa, Reinecke enumerates eight species, of which six are\r\nweeds either of aboriginal or of European introduction, the others being\r\nthe littoral Wedelia above alluded to, and a species of Blumea found\r\nalso in Fiji.\r\n\r\n\r\n DISTRIBUTION OF THE ENDEMIC GENERA OF COMPOSITÆ IN THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.\r\n\r\n +--------------+-----------------------------------------------------+-------+\r\n |              |            Distribution of the Species.             |       |\r\n |              +---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+       |\r\n |    Genus.    |   One   |   Two    |  Three   |   Four   |          |       |\r\n |              | island. | islands. | islands. | islands. | General. | Total.|\r\n +--------------+---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+-------+\r\n |Remya         |    2    |     —    |     —    |     —    |     —    |   2   |\r\n |Tetramolopium |    1    |     4    |     2    |     —    |     —    |   7   |\r\n |Lipochæta     |    3    |     4    |     3    |     —    |     1    |  11   |\r\n |Campylotheca  |    5    |     4    |     3    |     —    |     —    |  12   |\r\n |Argyroxiphium |    1    |     1    |     —    |     —    |     —    |   2   |\r\n |Wilkesia      |    2    |     —    |     —    |     —    |     —    |   2   |\r\n |Dubautia      |    4    |     —    |     2    |     —    |     —    |   6   |\r\n |Raillardia    |    9    |     1    |     —    |     2    |     —    |  12   |\r\n |Hesperomannia |    1    |     1    |     —    |     —    |     —    |   2   |\r\n +--------------+---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+-------+\r\n |              |   28    |    15    |    10    |     2    |     1    |  56   |\r\n +--------------+---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+-------+\r\n\r\nWe have now, I venture to think, gone far to establish the existence of\r\nan early “Composite” flora with mainly American affinities in the\r\nPacific islands, an ancient flora of which only the remnants now occur\r\nin the uplands of Hawaii, Tahiti, and Rarotonga. That the achenes were\r\noriginally transported in birds’ plumage is, as we have seen, probable;\r\nbut we are still quite in the dark as to the causes of the subsequent\r\nsuspension of the means of dispersal and of the resulting period of\r\nisolation, during which the original immigrant plants acquired their\r\nendemic characters. In our uncertainty, therefore, we will look to Fiji\r\nin the hope that in the absence of the early Compositæ from that group\r\nwe may find a clue that will enable us to divest this problem of some of\r\nits difficulties.\r\n\r\nIt might be at first considered that since these peculiar genera of\r\nCompositæ occur in the higher levels of Hawaii and Tahiti their absence\r\nfrom Fiji might be connected with the relatively low altitude of those\r\nislands, a character that is concerned with the exclusion from the\r\nFijian flora of many Hawaiian and Tahitian mountain plants (see Chapters\r\nXXIII. and XXIV.). But this view is at once negatived by the fact that\r\nFitchia thrives in Rarotonga, an island which does not far exceed 2,000\r\nfeet in elevation. It is negatived also by the extensive development of\r\nshrubby and arborescent Compositæ in the Galapagos Islands, on the\r\nequator, in St. Helena in 16° South latitude, and in other tropical\r\nislands, which are less than, or do not exceed, the Fijian Islands in\r\ntheir altitude.\r\n\r\nDuring the age of the Compositæ it is reasonable to suppose that the\r\ndispersal was general over the Pacific. The absence of genera indicating\r\nthis era from the islands of the Fijian region, that is, from Fiji,\r\nTonga, and Samoa, would become intelligible if these groups were\r\nsubmerged during this age of the general dispersal of the order over\r\nthis ocean. In my volume on the geology of Vanua Levu in Fiji, I have\r\nshown that these island-groups of the Western Pacific emerged from the\r\nsea towards the close of the Tertiary period, a conclusion that would\r\nenable us to assign the age of the general dispersal of the Compositæ\r\nover the tropical Pacific to an earlier portion of the same period.\r\n\r\nIn order, however, to make further progress in the discussion of this\r\ndifficult problem we are obliged to approach it from the outside. We\r\nmust in fact regard these genera from the standpoint of their position\r\nas members of the vast and ancient order of the Compositæ. It is now\r\nmore than thirty years since Mr. Bentham completed his remarkable memoir\r\non the classification, history, and geographical distribution of the\r\nCompositæ (_Journal Linnean Society, Botany_, London, Vol. 13, 1873).\r\nLike De Candolle, when dealing with the facts of distribution, he\r\nhandled thousands of species, and as a result he drew certain inferences\r\nwhich are of prime importance to students of plant-dispersal. In his\r\ntime the order included nearly 10,000 known species, and although this\r\nnumber has since no doubt been considerably increased, it is not likely\r\nthat his main conclusions, in so far as they are free from purely\r\nhypothetical considerations, will be materially affected by the later\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\nAccepting the antiquity of the order, and regarding it as probably\r\ndating far back in geological time, he observes that the evidence points\r\nto a very wide dispersion of its original stock at an early period.\r\nAfrica, West America, and possibly Australia, possessed the order at the\r\nearliest recognisable stage. There must have existed, he contends, at\r\nthis early period some means of reciprocal interchange of races between\r\nthese regions. Then followed a stoppage of communication, or a\r\nsuspension of the means of dispersal, between the tropical regions of\r\nthe Old and New Worlds; but long after communication was broken off in\r\nthe warmer regions, it still existed, as he holds, between the alpine\r\nheights in those regions and also between the high northern latitudes of\r\nboth hemispheres. Referring particularly to the Hawaiian Group, he\r\nconsiders that the large endemic element among the Compositæ indicates\r\nthat the ancient connection, whether with America or with Australasia,\r\nhas been so long severed as not to have left a single unmodified common\r\nform. Fitchia, the Tahitian genus, as we have already remarked, is\r\nregarded as the only remnant of an ancient Composite flora in the\r\ntropical islands of the South Pacific.\r\n\r\nIn the light of these reflections it will be interesting to glance at\r\nthe general distribution of the shrubby and arborescent or woody\r\nCompositæ. Mr. Hemsley, having generally discussed the subject, arrived\r\nat the conclusion that, “although they form so large a proportion of the\r\nfloras of St. Helena, Juan Fernandez, the Sandwich Islands, and some\r\nother islands, they are not specially insular.” There are scores of\r\nthem, he goes on to say, in South America, Africa, Madagascar, India,\r\nAustralia, and New Zealand from twenty to forty feet high, and more\r\ntruly arboreous than the insular ones; whilst nearly every sub-order has\r\nits arboreous representatives. He was, however, unable to form any\r\ndefinite opinion of the method of distribution of the woody Compositæ.\r\nTaking those of St. Helena and Juan Fernandez, he observes that they are\r\nnot more closely allied to the Compositæ of the nearest continents than\r\nthey are to those of more distant regions. The occurrence of arboreous\r\nCompositæ, belonging in each case to different tribes, in so many remote\r\noceanic islands, coupled with the distribution of the genera to which\r\nthey bear the greatest affinity, seems, he observes, to indicate that\r\nthey are the remains of very ancient types (_Introd. Bot. Chall.\r\nExped._, pp. 19-24, 66, 68; also Parts ii. p. 61, and iii. p. 23).\r\n\r\nThe further discussion of this subject would lead us into a wide field\r\nof inquiry, quite beyond the scope of this work. There is, however, an\r\ninference that I think we may legitimately draw from geological evidence\r\nin this region. With respect to the antiquity of the woody Compositæ of\r\nthe Pacific as illustrated by the endemic genera, both Mr. Bentham and\r\nMr. Hemsley view them as belonging to ancient types. Mr. Wallace, in his\r\n_Island Life_, a book that becomes more and more indispensable for the\r\nstudent of dispersal as years progress, dwells on the importance of\r\nthese ancient Compositæ in the floral history of the Pacific islands. We\r\nmay look upon the Hawaiian Compositæ, he remarks, as representing the\r\nmost ancient portion of the existing flora, carrying us back to a very\r\nremote period when the facilities for communication with America were\r\ngreater than they are now. The date of this period of oceanic dispersal\r\nof the Compositæ we can now approximately determine, since these plants\r\nare absent from the Fijian region, an area of submergence during the\r\nTertiary era. Before the island-groups of the Fijian region had emerged\r\ntowards the close of the Tertiary period the achenes of the early\r\nCompositæ had been dispersed far and wide over the tropical Pacific.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all that we can infer from the convergence of these\r\nindependent lines of botanical and geological investigation. Mr. Bentham\r\nobserves that the tribes of the Compositæ had acquired the essential\r\ncharacters now employed in classification before the dispersion of the\r\norder over the Pacific. Since this general dispersion took place, as we\r\nhold, during the Tertiary submergence of the island-groups of West\r\nPolynesia (Fiji, Tonga, Samoa), it follows that the birth of the tribes\r\nof the Compositæ antedates that period. If this interesting order could\r\nsupply us with a “datum-mark” in the history of the Pacific floras, it\r\nwould be stated in terms of the development of specific and generic\r\ncharacters, but not of those of a tribe.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Summary of Chapter._\r\n\r\n(1) The Hawaiian Islands present the same contrast with the Fijian and\r\nTahitian groups as regards the development of new species in the case of\r\nthe flowering plants that they offer in the case of the vascular\r\ncryptogams (ferns and lycopods). But the contrast is intensified, and it\r\nis further emphasised as respecting the flowering plants by the\r\nevolution of a large number of endemic genera.\r\n\r\n(2) This great preponderance of peculiar species and genera in Hawaii is\r\nnot to be connected with the relative antiquity of the group but with\r\nits degree of isolation.\r\n\r\n(3) The earliest stage of the flowering plants of the islands of Hawaii\r\nand of Eastern Polynesia (the Tahitian region) is indicated by the\r\nendemic genera, particularly those of the Compositæ and Lobeliaceæ. Such\r\ngenera are numerous in Hawaii, and occur also in the Tahitian region, as\r\nin Tahiti and Rarotonga; but do not exist in the groups of the Fijian\r\nregion (Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa).\r\n\r\n(4) The endemic genera of the Hawaiian Compositæ are mainly American in\r\ntheir affinities. The relationship of the solitary Tahitian genus\r\n(Fitchia) is still a subject of discussion.\r\n\r\n(5) In the Hawaiian Islands, as well as in Tahiti and Rarotonga, the\r\nplants of the endemic genera of Compositæ are, as a rule, arborescent or\r\nshrubby; and in the first two localities they are mainly restricted to\r\nthe higher levels.\r\n\r\n(6) In discussing the mode of dispersal of the achenes of the original\r\ngenera we have also to explain why the process of dispersal has been in\r\nthe main suspended.\r\n\r\n(7) It is shown that the achenes of these early Compositæ were in all\r\nprobability suited for dispersal in birds’ plumage.\r\n\r\n(8) Yet the isolating influence that cut off these genera from the\r\noutside world has, in later ages, been active within the limits of the\r\nHawaiian archipelago, with the result that half the species are not\r\nfound in more than a single island. Inter-island dispersal has,\r\ntherefore, been also largely suspended.\r\n\r\n(9) The absence of endemic genera of Compositæ from Fiji, Tonga, and\r\nSamoa cannot be attributed to unsuitable climatic conditions connected\r\nwith the relatively low elevation of those islands as contrasted with\r\nthose of Hawaii, since a species of Fitchia abounds in Rarotonga, which\r\nis not far over 2,000 feet in elevation. Shrubby and arborescent\r\nCompositæ of peculiar types also occur in the Galapagos and other\r\ntropical islands not more elevated than the Fijis.\r\n\r\n(10) These endemic genera are the remains of an ancient Composite flora\r\nin the islands of the tropical Pacific, and ages have elapsed since the\r\nseverance of their connections with regions outside.\r\n\r\n(11) According to Mr. Bentham the Compositæ were distributed over\r\nAfrica, West America, and possibly Australia, at an early period, but\r\nsubsequent to the differentiation of the tribes of the order. Some means\r\nof reciprocal interchange of races between these regions then existed.\r\nThen followed a suspension of the means of dispersal between the\r\ntropical regions of the Old and New Worlds except between the alpine\r\nheights of those latitudes.\r\n\r\n(12) It is inferred by the author of this volume that the general\r\ndispersion of the early Compositæ over the Pacific took place during the\r\nTertiary submergence of the island-groups of the Fijian region (Fiji,\r\nTonga, and Samoa), and that their absence from that region may be thus\r\nexplained. At the time of this general dispersion, as above pointed out,\r\nthe tribes of the Compositæ had been already differentiated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n              THE ERA OF THE ENDEMIC GENERA (_continued_)\r\n\r\n               THE COMPOSITÆ AND LOBELIACEÆ (_continued_)\r\n\r\n                      THE AGE OF THE TREE-LOBELIAS\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the arborescent Lobeliaceæ.—On the upper flanks of\r\n  Ruwenzori.—The Lobeliaceæ of the Hawaiian Islands.—The Lobeliaceæ of\r\n  the Tahitian or East Polynesian region.—The capacities for\r\n  dispersal.—The explanation of the absence of the early Lobeliaceæ from\r\n  West Polynesia.—The other Hawaiian endemic genera.—The Fijian endemic\r\n  genera.—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Lobeliaceæ rank with the Compositæ in the prominence of their\r\nposition in the early Pacific floras. Though absent, as far as is known,\r\nfrom Fiji, they are represented in Hawaii by 58 species, all endemic and\r\nbelonging to six genera, of which five are not found elsewhere. All\r\npossess, as Hillebrand remarks, a woody stem, by far the greater number\r\nbeing either tall shrubs, 5 or 6 feet high, or small trees, 10 to 20\r\nfeet or more in height. In the East Polynesian or Tahitian region, the\r\norder is represented by two genera containing in all five known species\r\nand restricted to those islands. One genus is common to the islands of\r\nTahiti and Rarotonga, and the other is confined to Raiatea. The species\r\nmay be shrubby or arborescent.\r\n\r\nIt was for some time considered that the oceanic archipelagoes of the\r\nPacific were the exclusive centres of these singular arborescent\r\nLobeliaceæ (I am here quoting Baillon in his _Natural History of\r\nPlants_). And indeed this idea would receive some support from the\r\ncircumstance that Dr. Hillebrand, in his work on Hawaii, says little or\r\nnothing about the affinities or general relations of plants which he\r\nenthusiastically termed “the pride of our flora.” His death in 1886\r\ndeprived his work of its crowning piece, a discussion of “the\r\ninteresting questions of the origin and development of the Hawaiian\r\nflora” (see the Editor’s Introduction, p. ix.). In no group of plants is\r\nthis want more keenly felt than with the Lobeliaceæ. Yet in his time the\r\nexplorations had yet to be made that could set the student of\r\nplant-distribution on the road to investigate this problem.\r\n\r\nIt was true, no doubt, that types analogous to those of the Hawaiian\r\nLobeliaceæ were known from the American and African continents. Thus\r\nOliver in his _Flora of Tropical Africa_, published in 1877, gives an\r\naccount of the species of Lobelia then known from the mountains of this\r\nregion. The genus was, however, not entirely confined to mountainous\r\ndistricts, but it would almost seem that most of the high mountains of\r\nEquatorial Africa had their peculiar species, some of them being\r\ntree-like and others shrubby. Two mountain species were recorded from\r\nAbyssinia, one of them from an elevation of 11,000 to 13,000 feet and\r\ngrowing to a height of 12 to 15 feet, the other from an altitude of\r\nabout 8,000 feet; another, Lobelia Deckenii, attaining a height of 4\r\nfeet, was recorded from the uplands of Kilimanjaro, 12,000 to 13,000\r\nfeet above the sea, and yet another from the mountains of Fernando Po,\r\nat an altitude of 9,000 feet. So again, in the case of the American\r\ncontinent, Hemsley, writing in 1885 (_Intr. Bot. Chall. Exped._, p. 32),\r\nspeaks of arborescent species of the American genera Centropogon,\r\nSiphocampylus, &c.; and Baillon in his _Natural History of Plants_\r\n(Engl. edit. viii. 350) refers to the similar Tupas and Haynaldias from\r\nSouth America. But what the student of plant-distribution looked for was\r\nnot merely the occurrence of “tree-lobelias” in other parts of the\r\nworld, but also the reproduction of these wonderful plants under the\r\nsame conditions and on the same scale as those familiar to him on the\r\nHawaiian mountains. He has accordingly had to wait for the results of\r\nthe more recent explorations of the mountains of Central Africa in order\r\nto obtain his wish.\r\n\r\nOn the upper flanks of Ruwenzori, Kilimanjaro, and Kenya, at elevations\r\nof 9,000 to 13,000 feet and reaching to the snow-line, there flourish in\r\nboggy portions of the forest arborescent Lobeliaceæ that attain a height\r\nof 15 or 20 feet. They have the habit sometimes of a Dracæna and\r\nsometimes of an Aloe, and do not exhibit the branching trunks so\r\ncharacteristic of the Hawaiian genus of Clermontia. They all belong,\r\nhowever, to the genus Lobelia, and thus do not display the extensive\r\ndifferentiation of the endemic genera of Hawaii. Nor, apparently, has\r\nthere been the same degree of formative energy in the development of\r\nspecies, since only about half a dozen species are hitherto known. We\r\nfind, however, produced on these lofty mountains of Equatorial Africa\r\nthe same climatic conditions under which the arborescent Lobeliaceæ\r\nflourish in Hawaii, namely, the very humid atmosphere, the heavy\r\nrainfall, and the mild temperature; and if there are important contrasts\r\nin their character and in the amount of differentiation which they have\r\nundergone in the two regions, the one a continental and the other an\r\ninsular region, it will be from such contrasts that some of the most\r\ninteresting results of this comparison of a mountain of Central Africa\r\nwith an island of the open Pacific will be ultimately derived (see Sir\r\nH. Johnston’s _Uganda Protectorate_, 1902, and _Kilimanjaro Expedition_,\r\n1886; also _Trans. Linn. Soc.

Some of those relating to the elevations in Hawaii\r\n  are supplemented from my notes. All the genera are endemic except\r\n  Lobelia, of which all the species are apparently endemic, excepting\r\n  perhaps one, which, according to Hillebrand, resembles greatly a\r\n  species from the Liukiu Islands.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  The range of the heights of different species of Clermontia is from 5\r\n  or 6 feet for shrubs to 25 feet for trees.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  The heights attained by different species of Cyanea range from 3 or 4\r\n  feet to between 30 and 40 feet, thus:—\r\n\r\n  In 8 species 3 to 6 feet.\r\n  In 9 species 6 to 10 feet.\r\n  In 7 species 10 to 15 feet.\r\n  In 3 species 15 to 25 feet.\r\n  In 1 species 30 to 40 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE LOBELIACEÆ OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nHaving thus prepared the way, I will proceed to the discussion of the\r\nHawaiian Lobeliaceæ, dealing first with their “station.” Their vertical\r\ndistribution is well illustrated in the large and lofty island of\r\nHawaii. Whilst the woody Compositæ, as before described, are most at\r\nhome on the open-wooded and often scantily-forested slopes between 5,000\r\nand 9,000 feet, the Lobeliaceæ are most characteristic of the middle or\r\ntrue forest zone that extends from 2,000 or 3,000 feet to between 5,000\r\nand 6,000 feet above the sea. This lies within the region of clouds and\r\nmists, and it is here that the rain-belt or area of greatest rainfall is\r\nsituated, the annual amount averaging probably 150 to 200 inches. It is\r\nin such humid conditions that, as Hillebrand observes, trees and jungle\r\nare developed in greatest luxuriance; and it is here that “the\r\nLobeliaceæ exhibit their most striking forms.” The traveller, as he\r\nascends the mountains, finds the Tree-Lobelias in the region of mist and\r\nrain-cloud; and he is lucky if he escapes the usual downpour and\r\nencounters only a fine drizzling rain.\r\n\r\nThe mild climate of this region is indicated by a mean annual\r\ntemperature ranging probably with elevation from 65° to 55° F. It is\r\nsecure from the frosts of the upper slopes of the mountain; whilst at\r\nthe same time it is above the regions of tropical heat. There is,\r\nhowever, no doubt that when the forests extended to the coasts, as they\r\noccasionally do now on the north side of Hawaii, the Lobeliaceæ occurred\r\nmuch lower down than they do at present, though still only attaining\r\ntheir greatest development in size and number in the higher levels.\r\nThus, at rare intervals, I noticed in the forests of Hamakua and Kohala,\r\nwhere they descended to the coasts, species of Clermontia at an\r\nelevation of only 500 or 600 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nProbably in no part of the Hawaiian Islands are the conditions under\r\nwhich the “Tree-Lobelias” thrive better illustrated than on the higher\r\nslopes of Mount Eeka, a bulky mountain mass about 6,000 feet in height,\r\nforming the western portion of Maui. Its flat top, as Hillebrand\r\nobserves, is wrapped in a cloud of mist nearly the whole year. On the\r\nboggy surface of the summit, where Acæna exigua gives a tussocky\r\nappearance, and Sphagnum or bog-moss abounds, flourish Cyperaceæ,\r\nLycopods, and Selaginellæ; and here Drosera longifolia and a peculiar\r\nspecies of marsh violet (Viola mauiensis) find a home. The upper slopes,\r\ndown to 4,000 feet, present similar moist conditions, and here in an\r\nopen-wooded district, associated with Cyrtandræ, Marattias, and true\r\nTree-Ferns, the ground being covered with Lycopods, the “Tree-Lobelias”\r\nabound. I noted four kinds within two hundred yards. Of the humidity of\r\nthe upper slopes of Mount Eeka I have a very vivid recollection, and my\r\nexperience of passing a night on that mountain is described in Chapter\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\nThe Lobeliaceæ, as Hillebrand remarks, occur invariably as isolated\r\nindividuals. I was often struck, however, with the preference the genera\r\nshowed for particular localities. Thus, Clermontia is well represented\r\non the western slopes of Mount Eeka, Delissea on the northern slopes of\r\nHualalai (3,800 to 4,500 feet), Cyanea on the Hamakua slopes of Mauna\r\nKea (2,300 to 4,100), and Lobelia on the southern slopes of Mauna Loa\r\nbehind Punaluu (2,000 to 3,500 feet).\r\n\r\nTo the student of geographical distribution the Hawaiian Lobeliaceæ are\r\nof especial interest. Mr. Hemsley observes that they have their greatest\r\naffinities in America (_Intr. Bot. Chall. Exped._, p. 68). M. Drake del\r\nCastillo, in his “Mémoire couronné par l’Académie des Sciences” (Paris,\r\n1890), remarks that these plants connect Hawaii with America just as the\r\nGoodeniaceæ link the same group with Australia. This is what we might\r\nhave expected since the centre of the order is in America, principally\r\nin the Mexican and Andine regions (Drake del Castillo, _Flore Polyn.\r\nFranc._, xi.).\r\n\r\nThough five out of the six genera are endemic, the sixth, that of\r\nLobelia, has a world-wide distribution. Here then, we have a genus that\r\nbelongs strictly to the next or second stage of the plant-stocking of\r\nthe Hawaiian Group, namely, when the non-endemic genera now containing\r\nendemic species were introduced. As with the Composite genera,\r\nCampylotheca and Lipochæta, Lobelia marks the beginning of the new or\r\nthe close of the old era. It is, however, necessary to point out that\r\nmany of the conditions favouring luxuriant and rank vegetable growth are\r\npre-eminently represented in the zone of the Lobeliaceæ. In these\r\nsoft-stemmed plants with their copious milky sap and large fleshy\r\nflowers, sometimes two or three inches long, the very redundancy of\r\ngrowth would tend both to exaggerate and to disguise the generic\r\ndistinctions. To the ordinary observer these “Tree-Lobelias” call up\r\nvague notions of a flora of a bygone age, and by their _bizarre_\r\nappearance he might with some excuse be led to give play to his\r\nimagination when describing them; but the systematic botanist, seeing\r\nthrough their disguise, frames rather more prosaic notions of their\r\nantiquity and degree of differentiation. According to my view, the first\r\nHawaiian Lobeliaceæ occupied open, exposed localities such as are held\r\nby the decadent genus Brighamia now, and acquired their monstrous form\r\nin the humid forests of a later age. (See Perkins in Note 80.)\r\n\r\nIn his monograph on the Campanulaceæ (Engler’s _Nat. Pflanz. Fam._, teil\r\n4, abth. 5, 1894), S. Schönland, speaking of the sub-family Lobelioideæ,\r\nplaces the seven endemic Hawaiian and Tahitian genera in a group by\r\nthemselves. Though, as he observes, the Hawaiian tree-forms appear at\r\nfirst sight to constitute a natural group, they cannot be sharply\r\ndistinguished from other forms, and even in habit come near some Indian\r\nand Abyssinian types of Lobelia. In their treatment, he says, they\r\nshould all go together, and he does not approve of the endeavours of\r\nsome botanists to isolate one of them (Brighamia) from the rest and to\r\nconnect it with the Australian genus Isotoma.\r\n\r\nIt is also to be noted that whilst four of the Hawaiian genera are more\r\nor less dispersed over the group, one (Brighamia) with only one species\r\nis confined to the islands of Molokai and Niihau, the double habitat\r\nbeing suggestive of its approaching extinction. Another (Rollandia) with\r\nsix species is restricted to the island Oahu. Cyanea, which possesses\r\ntwenty-eight out of the total of fifty-eight species, may, from the\r\npoint of view of its formative energy, be regarded as in its prime. It\r\nis thus apparent that, as with the Compositæ, the early Lobeliaceous\r\nimmigrants were not all contemporaneous arrivals.\r\n\r\n\r\n       DISTRIBUTION OF THE LOBELIACEÆ IN THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.[4]\r\n\r\nColumn headings:\r\n\r\n A: Brighamia.\r\n B: Lobelia.\r\n C: Clermontia.\r\n D: Rollandia.\r\n E: Delissea.\r\n F: Cyanea.\r\n G: Total.\r\n\r\n +----------------------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n |      Hawaiian Lobeliaceæ.        | A  | B  | C  | D  | E  | F  | G  |\r\n +----------------------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n | Species confined to one island   |  — |  — |  6 |  6 |  4 | 22 | 38 |\r\n | Species confined to two islands  |  1 |  2 |  2 |  — |  2 |  5 | 12 |\r\n | Species confined to three islands|  — |  1 |  2 |  — |  1 |  1 |  5 |\r\n | Species generally distributed,   |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n |   but still endemic              |  — |  2 |  1 |  — |  — |  — |  3 |\r\n |                                  +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n |                                  |  1 |  5 | 11 |  6 |  7 | 28 | 58 |\r\n +----------------------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  All the species are endemic.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting fact of distribution, brought out by an analysis of\r\nHillebrand’s materials and illustrated in the subjoined table, is that\r\nout of the fifty-eight Hawaiian species, all of which are endemic,\r\nthirty-eight, or 66 per cent., are recorded from only one island. In\r\nmost of the other cases they are recorded from two or three islands,\r\nusually adjacent, like Maui and Molokai; and except in the instance of\r\ntwo species of Lobelia and one species of Clermontia they never range\r\nover the length of the group.\r\n\r\nThese facts speak eloquently of the suspension to a great extent of the\r\nagencies of dispersal in recent times within the group. Some corrections\r\nof the figures will be rendered necessary by future investigations, but\r\nthe main conclusion will not be materially affected. Such facts are\r\nparalleled in the distribution of the Hawaiian insects, mollusca, &c.;\r\nbut these matters need only be mentioned here. We might, indeed, have\r\nexpected, apart from other considerations, that the isolation of the\r\nHawaiian Lobeliaceæ from their kindred in other parts of the world would\r\nnot have been reproduced within the group itself. This, however, is not\r\nthe case; and we now see that not only have they been deprived for ages\r\nof their means of distribution over the Pacific, but that even within\r\nthe archipelago their transportal from island to island has been largely\r\nsuspended. We have before arrived at similar conclusions with regard to\r\nthe early Compositæ, when we saw that about half the species were not\r\nfound in more than one island. It is therefore evident that the same\r\ngreat principle regulating the operations of the distributing agencies\r\nhas influenced to a similar extent both the Compositæ and the Lobeliaceæ\r\nof the Hawaiian Group.\r\n\r\n\r\n       THE LOBELIACEÆ OF THE TAHITIAN OR EAST POLYNESIAN REGION.\r\n\r\nThe order is represented in this region by two endemic genera,\r\nSclerotheca of Tahiti and Rarotonga, and Apetahia of Raiatea. These\r\nislands are, however, not sufficiently large for the extensive\r\ndevelopment of the arborescent Lobeliaceæ, such as we find in Hawaii.\r\nThe species in both genera are either arborescent or shrubby; but I do\r\nnot gather that they give any character to the floras of these islands.\r\nAccording to the data given by Drake del Castillo for one of the two\r\npeculiar species of Sclerotheca occurring in Tahiti, these plants grow\r\non the humid wooded slopes of the mountains at elevations of 2,000 to\r\n3,000 feet. Whilst in one species the plants attain a height of 10 to 25\r\nfeet, in the other they do not exceed 10 feet. Rarotonga possesses a\r\npeculiar species of Sclerotheca, 4 to 6 feet high, which was discovered\r\nby Cheeseman growing plentifully on the upper slopes of the highest\r\nmountain of the island at altitudes of 1,500 to 2,200 feet. The same\r\nbotanist also came upon a second species of the genus on another\r\nmountain in Rarotonga at elevations of 1,000 to 1,500 feet, but it was\r\nrare and has not yet been described. The other genus, Apetahia, has only\r\nbeen recorded from Raiatea, where it is represented by a solitary\r\nspecies (6 feet high) growing, according to Nadeaud, in the mountains of\r\nthat island.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that the dispersal of these genera of the Lobeliaceæ\r\namongst the groups of Eastern Polynesia ceased long ago. From the\r\ncircumstance that Sclerotheca exists in Tahiti and in Rarotonga, which\r\nare about 650 miles apart, it may be inferred either that the genus was\r\nintroduced into this region from outside, or else, which is perhaps more\r\nprobable, that it was developed in Tahiti whence it was transported to\r\nRarotonga. Hemsley speaks of this Tahitian genus as seemingly marking a\r\nformer wide extension of the Hawaiian arborescent type of the Lobeliaceæ\r\n(_Introd. Bot. Chall. Exped._, p. 68). This is the view that will be\r\nadopted in this chapter, and it is precisely the view advocated by\r\nBentham and followed here, in the case of the early Compositæ of the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the absence of these arborescent Lobeliaceæ from the\r\nisland-groups of the Western Pacific, and notably from Fiji and Samoa,\r\nwhere no members of the order seem to occur, it is probable that, as in\r\nthe case of the similar distribution of the early Compositæ described in\r\nthe preceding chapter, this is to be attributed to the fact that the\r\nWestern Pacific archipelagoes were more or less submerged during the\r\ngeneral dispersion of the Compositæ and Lobeliaceæ over the Pacific in\r\nthe earliest age of the floral history of these islands. The occurrence\r\nof the early Compositæ and Lobeliaceæ in Rarotonga, which is almost\r\nhalf-way between Tahiti and Tonga on the outskirts of the Fijian region,\r\nsufficiently indicates that they are not lacking in that region from\r\ninability to reach there in the past. During the age of general\r\ndispersal of these two orders over the Pacific, probably only a few\r\nrocky islets, tenanted perhaps by Conifers, marked the situation in the\r\nTertiary period of the present archipelagoes of Fiji and Samoa.\r\n\r\nOne may note in passing the general absence of these arborescent types\r\nof the Lobeliaceæ from Malaya, since they do not seem to have been\r\nrecorded either from the Owen Stanley Range in New Guinea or from\r\nKinabalu in North Borneo, the highest mountain in the Malayan Islands,\r\nor from the mountains of Java.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of the occurrence of these plants in other tropical or\r\nsubtropical oceanic islands need not detain us long, since, with the\r\nexception of the solitary Lobelia scævolifolia of St. Helena, they seem\r\nrarely to be found. This species, which is endemic, is a shrub growing\r\non the upper slopes and summit of the island at elevations of 2,000 to\r\n2,700 feet (_Introd. Bot. Chall. Exped._, p. 40, and Part ii. pp. 54,\r\n76).\r\n\r\nThere are two herbaceous species of Lobelia in Juan Fernandez, of which\r\none only, according to Hemsley, could be regarded as indigenous. This is\r\na showy Chilian and Peruvian species (Lobelia tupa) noticed by Bertero\r\nas very common in 1829 (_Bot. Chall. Exped._, Part iii.). Since,\r\nhowever, it would belong to the present age of plant-dispersal in the\r\nPacific, it does not require further mention here; and indeed it would\r\nalmost appear, when we bear in mind the geographical position and the\r\nhistory of this island since its discovery in 1563, that even as a truly\r\nindigenous plant it is not above suspicion. Lobelias of this type are\r\nnow amongst the commonest plants of the coast regions of northern Chile,\r\nwhere I noticed some as much as 9 or 10 feet high.\r\n\r\n_On the Capacities of Dispersal of the Lobeliaceæ of the Pacific._—Of\r\nactual observations, with the exception of the instance of birds pecking\r\nat the capsules of our garden Lobelias, I have come upon few that bear\r\ndirectly on this point. When writing of the flora of the Kermadec Group,\r\nmany years ago, Sir Joseph Hooker referred (_Journ. Linn. Soc. Bot._,\r\nvol. i.) to the minute seeds of Lobelia as not adapted for transport\r\nunless their minuteness and number fit them for it; but since he\r\nassociates in this connection the tiny seeds of Metrosideros, which is\r\nnow represented by a species found all over the Pacific, it would seem\r\nthat the difficulty in the case of Lobelia is not connected so much with\r\nthe nature as with the suspension of these means of distribution during\r\nthe later stages of the plant-stocking of the oceanic islands of the\r\ntropical Pacific. It will be gathered from the following remarks that\r\nthe descendants of the early Pacific Lobeliaceæ are probably as well\r\nfitted for dispersal as their ancestors, and that the break in the\r\ncommunication is the ultimate subject for inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of the Hawaiian endemic genera are in four out of five cases\r\nbaccate, with usually fleshy or pulpy contents. Such berries, which are\r\ngenerally yellow, but sometimes bluish in colour, vary in size from\r\nabout half an inch in Rollandia and Delissea to an inch in Cyanea, and\r\nnot infrequently to more than an inch in Clermontia. The fruits of\r\nLobelia and Brighamia are capsular and dehiscent. With regard to the two\r\ngenera of the Society Islands and Rarotonga, the fruits of Sclerotheca\r\nare hard-walled capsules, opening by two pores; whilst those of Apetahia\r\nare seemingly dry and indehiscent. I do not imagine, therefore, that the\r\ncharacter of the fruit has determined to any important degree the\r\ndistribution of these plants.\r\n\r\nNor is there reason to suppose that the fruits have acquired their\r\nbaccate character in Hawaii, and that they were originally dry and\r\ncapsular. Both types of fruit are found among the arborescent Lobeliaceæ\r\nof America, with which the Hawaiian genera have their affinities.\r\nCentropogon, for instance, which occurs in Central America and in the\r\nwarm parts of North and South America, has, according to Baillon, a\r\nsomewhat fleshy berry. It is noteworthy that a similar question is\r\nraised with respect to Cyrtandra as to the relation between fleshy\r\nfruits in the Pacific islands and dry or capsular fruits in the\r\ncontinental home of the genus (see Chapter XXV.).\r\n\r\nThe berries of the Tree-Lobelias would attract birds. We learn from Mr.\r\nPerkins that one of the Hawaiian Drepanids, the Ou, is very partial to\r\nthe berries of some of the Tree-Lobelias and especially those of\r\nClermontia, the seeds passing unharmed in the droppings. The mode of\r\ndispersal of the seeds of the dry-capsular fruits is not so apparent;\r\nbut the fruits could scarcely be less inviting to birds than the dry\r\ncapsules of Metrosideros, the small seeds of which have in some way or\r\nother been carried to almost every island-group of the Pacific. I have\r\nbeside me the dark brown, smooth crustaceous seeds of a species of\r\nClermontia. They measure 1/42 of an inch or 0·6 of a millimetre, and\r\nabout 500 go to a grain. Mr. Wallace, in his book on Darwinism,\r\nadvocates the paramount influence of winds over birds for carrying small\r\nseeds, like those of Orchis and Sagina, over tracts of ocean a thousand\r\nmiles across. I am, however, not inclined to think that, except as\r\nregards the spores of cryptogams, winds have done very much for Hawaii.\r\nFor small seeds we can appeal not only to the agency of birds and bats\r\nbut also to insects (see Chapter XXXIII.).\r\n\r\nObservations of this kind, however, merely indicate that these early\r\nLobeliaceæ possessed the same capacities for dispersal that in the\r\nsucceeding stages of the plant-stocking of the Pacific islands have\r\nbelonged to Metrosideros, Cyrtandra, Ophiorrhiza, Freycinetia, and many\r\nother small-seeded genera. They go no way to explain why the same\r\nagencies which transported the minute seeds in a later age could not\r\nhave been available for continuing the dispersal of the early\r\nLobeliaceæ. To find an explanation we are compelled to go behind the\r\nmere capacities for dispersal and to appeal to the general laws of\r\ndistribution in so far as our facts enable us to interpret them.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the two principal components of the early Pacific\r\nflora, the Compositæ and the Lobeliaceæ, have American affinities. The\r\nplants of the later ages are mainly Old World in their connections.\r\nThough containing often endemic species in the various groups, the\r\ngenera occur also outside each group. The stream of migration that came\r\nfrom America during the early age of the Compositæ and the Lobeliaceæ,\r\nwhen the islands of the Western Pacific were more or less submerged, was\r\nduring the later ages (after these islands had re-emerged) suspended or\r\ndiverted, giving place to a stream that brought plants in numbers from\r\ntropical Asia, Malaya, and Australia. The general dispersion of the\r\nCompositæ and Lobeliaceæ took place during the Tertiary submergence of\r\nthe islands of the Western Pacific, including the island-groups of Fiji,\r\nSamoa, and Tonga. The migration from the west, mainly Indo-Malayan in\r\ncharacter, occurred after the re-emergence of those archipelagoes. Thus\r\nwe get to understand how genera like those of the early Lobeliaceæ and\r\nCyrtandra, which possess, as regards the minute size of their seeds,\r\nclosely similar capacities for dispersal, have such different\r\ndistributions, the first confined to Hawaii and Tahiti and American in\r\ntheir affinities, the second widely spread over the Pacific with its\r\nhome in Malaya.\r\n\r\nWe have yet to inquire whether this suspension of the means of transport\r\nin the later ages of the Pacific Lobeliaceæ is confined to the tropics\r\nor whether it extends to the colder latitudes in the southern\r\nhemisphere. The indications of the Lobeliaceæ of the “antarctic flora”\r\ngo to establish that the dispersal of the order is still, or was very\r\nrecently, in operation in these high latitudes. It is well illustrated,\r\namong other plants, by Lobelia anceps, which is found in extra-tropical\r\nSouth America, Australia and New Zealand, and South Africa. This,\r\nindeed, recalls Bentham’s view concerning the Compositæ, that whilst\r\ncommunication was broken off in the tropics, it was kept up in higher\r\nlatitudes.\r\n\r\nHere ends, therefore, our consideration of the Tree-Lobelias of the\r\nPacific islands; but as it is not quite complete without a discussion of\r\nthe remaining endemic genera of other orders than the Compositæ and\r\nLobeliaceæ which also belong to the same early age of the Pacific\r\nfloras, I will proceed at once to their consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE HAWAIIAN ENDEMIC GENERA EXCEPTING THOSE OF THE COMPOSITÆ AND\r\n                              LOBELIACEÆ.\r\n\r\nIt will not be possible for me to do more than point out a few general\r\nindications that can legitimately be drawn from these genera. The\r\nsubject bristles with difficulties for the systematist; but on one point\r\nthere can be but little danger of going astray, namely, in imputing to\r\nthem a high antiquity in the floral history of Hawaii. This can be said\r\nof all of them, whether or not the generic distinction adopted in Dr.\r\nHillebrand’s work is always adopted by botanists. It is therefore in\r\nthis general sense that they may be regarded as belonging to the early\r\nage of the Hawaiian flora.\r\n\r\nAlthough the genera of Compositæ and Lobeliaceæ are prominent amongst\r\nthe representatives of the original flora of the Hawaiian Islands,\r\nforming about two-fifths of the whole, the genera of other orders are by\r\nno means inconspicuous, and their variety is shown in the fact that\r\nthough twenty-three in number they belong to twelve orders. It is\r\npossible to divide these genera into two groups—one the older and\r\nperhaps more or less contemporaneous with the Lobeliaceæ and Compositæ,\r\nthe affinities when apparent being American; the other the more recent\r\nand marking the close of the first era of the plant-stocking of these\r\nislands, the affinities being all with the Old World, and especially\r\nwith Malaysia. This grouping is indicated in the list subjoined; and it\r\nmay be here remarked that whilst shrubs, undershrubs, and perennial\r\nherbs of the Caryophyllaceæ, Labiatæ, and Urticaceæ form the features of\r\nthe earlier group, trees of the Rubiaceæ and Araliaceæ are the most\r\nconspicuous members of the later group. At the close of the earliest era\r\nknown to us of the floral history of the Hawaiian Islands we observe the\r\ncommencement of those forests that now throughout Polynesia as well as\r\nin Hawaii betray their Asiatic origin.\r\n\r\nIn making this distinction I am proceeding on the assumption that the\r\nstream of migration, at first chiefly American in its source, came\r\nultimately in the main from the Asiatic side of the Pacific. The change\r\ncommenced, as I hold, in the latter portion of the first era of\r\nplant-stocking, an era characterised by the arrival of those early\r\nplants that are now represented by the endemic genera of the\r\narchipelago. The genera of this early period that belong neither to the\r\nCompositæ nor to the Lobeliaceæ are, as above observed, arranged by me\r\nin two groups, one regarded as contemporaneous with, the other as of\r\nlater origin than, the genera of these two orders. To the first belong\r\nthe shrubby, highly differentiated genera of the Caryophyllaceæ,\r\nSchiedea and Alsinidendron, and the Labiate genera, similarly\r\ndifferentiated, of Phyllostegia and Stenogyne. To the second belong the\r\nRubiaceous genera Kadua, Gouldia, Bobea, and Straussia, the Araliads\r\nCheirodendron, Pterotropia, and Triplasandra, and the Loganiaceous\r\nLabordea.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier group the fruits are dry in half the genera, and in such\r\ncases granivorous birds probably were usually the transporting agents.\r\nOnly in one case (Nothocestrum) is the fruit a berry, and in the other\r\ncases we have fruits like the fleshy nucules of Phyllostegia and\r\nStenogyne which would probably attract birds. In the later group\r\ntwo-thirds or three-fourths of the genera have moist fruits such as\r\nwould be eaten by frugivorous birds. Of these most are drupes,\r\npossessing not a single stone, but two or more pyrenes. This is the\r\nfirst appearance of the drupe in the plant-history of the archipelago.\r\nThe Rubiaceous type of drupe inclosing two or more pyrenes plays a very\r\nconspicuous part in the distribution of plants over the Pacific in the\r\nsucceeding eras.\r\n\r\nI would here lay stress on an important characteristic of all the fruits\r\nof the endemic genera of the Hawaiian Islands. There are no “impossible”\r\nfruits of this era in Hawaii, such as we occasionally find in the\r\nsucceeding eras. I mean by this term, fruits that defy the efforts of\r\nthe student of distribution to explain their transport in their present\r\ncondition. The discovery of a new inland genus possessing dry\r\nindehiscent fruits three or four inches long, or even of a single\r\nspecies of the coniferous Dammara, would play havoc with all our views\r\nrespecting the stocking of these islands with their plants. The finding\r\nhere of a large marsupial would scarcely produce more astonishment. The\r\nfruits indeed of this early era are very modest in their size, the dry\r\nindehiscent fruits and the stone-fruits rarely exceeding half an inch\r\n(12 mm.) in size.\r\n\r\nThere is another interesting point which is connected with the\r\ndeterioration of some of the fruits in their capacity for dispersal.\r\nSome of the species of Phyllostegia, and a few also of the Araliads, as\r\nwell as those of Nototrichium, are ill fitted for dispersal by birds\r\nnow, the coverings of the seeds being not sufficiently hard to protect\r\nthem from injury in a bird’s stomach. At the same time there are in some\r\ncases other species of the same genera that are better suited for this\r\nmode of transport. The effect of dispersal by frugivorous birds is that\r\nonly the hard-coated seeds propagate the plant in a new locality. When,\r\nhowever, as has occurred in the Hawaiian Islands, bird-agency largely\r\nceases to act, this selective influence is removed (see Note 68).\r\n\r\n\r\nENDEMIC HAWAIIAN GENERA, EXCLUDING THOSE

As in the case of\r\nthe Compositæ and Lobeliaceæ, but few of the species are generally\r\ndistributed, most being restricted to one island or to two or three\r\nadjacent islands. The suspension of the dispersal among the islands is,\r\nhowever, not so marked as with the species of the two orders just named.\r\n\r\nNOTE.—Some further remarks on some of these genera are given in Note 68.\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE ENDEMIC GENERA OF THE FIJIAN ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nThe interest that is associated with the endemic genera of Hawaii fails\r\nto attach itself to those of Fiji. For this there are several reasons.\r\nIn the first place, our acquaintance with the Fijian flora is much less\r\ncomplete. In the next place, the group holds a much less isolated\r\nposition, and the history of an endemic genus may have a significance\r\nquite different from that connected with it in Hawaii. Fiji also lacks,\r\non account of its submergence in the Tertiary period, those highly\r\ninteresting genera of the Compositæ and Lobeliaceæ that form the chief\r\nfeature in the early history of the flowering plants of Hawaii. Then,\r\nagain, on account of our imperfect knowledge of the floras of the\r\nneighbouring groups of continental islands to the westward, the New\r\nHebrides, Santa Cruz, and Solomon Groups, we can never feel quite\r\nconfident that any particular genus is really peculiar to the Fijian\r\narchipelago. This is well brought out in the later history of the genera\r\ndesignated by Dr. Seemann in his _Flora Vitiensis_ as peculiar to Fiji.\r\n\r\nOf the sixteen genera enumerated by Dr. Seemann, and given in the table\r\nbelow, only about half now retain their character of being restricted to\r\nFiji. Nor does it seem likely that future investigations will increase\r\nthis number, since, judging from a remark made by Mr. Hemsley in his\r\npaper on the botany of the Tongan Group, explorations subsequent to\r\nthose of Dr. Seemann, more especially those of Mr. Horne, have not\r\napparently added a single new endemic genus to the Fijian flora. It will\r\nbe seen from the list that at least four of the sixteen genera have\r\nsince been found in the Malayan region, and in one case (Smythea\r\npacifica) the same species occurs in both regions; whilst a fifth genus\r\n(Haplopetalon) has been recorded from New Caledonia.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some peculiarities about the Fijian endemic genera\r\nthat will attract our attention from the standpoint of dispersal. One\r\nremarkable feature is the paucity of species. Almost all the genera are\r\nmonotypic, that is to say, they are only known by a single species.\r\nAmongst the twenty-eight Hawaiian genera that are strictly endemic, only\r\nfour or five are monotypic, and they are mostly regarded by Hillebrand\r\nas worn-out, decadent types found in only one or two islands. In Hawaii\r\nthere are on the average six species to each endemic genus; and it is\r\nthus apparent that in the display of formative energy Nature has worked\r\non very different lines in these two groups. Since the nine Fijian\r\nendemic genera belong to nearly as many different orders, the\r\ncomposition of this endemic generic flora is by no means homogeneous. It\r\nis, I venture to think, such a motley collection as one might expect in\r\na region that has been exposed to wave after wave of migration from the\r\nwest, with no lofty mountains, as in Hawaii, to afford a refuge against\r\nextinction. It by no means follows that all these endemic genera have\r\nbeen produced in Fiji. Some of them may represent genera that have\r\nbecome extinct in the large continental groups to the westward.\r\n\r\n\r\n                SEEMANN’S SIXTEEN FIJIAN ENDEMIC GENERA.\r\n\r\n

indicated: (C)=Drake del Castillo; (H)=Horne;\r\n(IK)=_Index Kewensis_ (S)=Seemann; (Sc)=Schimper; (So)=Solereder in\r\nEngler’s _Nat. Pflanz. Fam._\r\n\r\nThe fact that several of them are fitted for dispersal by frugivorous\r\nbirds is very suggestive of the lack of means of transport in later\r\ntimes. In the instance of Couthovia corynocarpa the drupes are known to\r\nbe the food of fruit-pigeons at the present time (Seemann), whilst this\r\nis also true of Oncocarpus vitiensis, though this genus has since been\r\nfound in New Guinea. Since, as will be pointed out in a later chapter,\r\nbirds must still be fairly active in carrying seeds to Fiji from regions\r\nwestward, it would seem that genera only become peculiar to Fiji when\r\nthey fail at their source, and it is indeed doubtful whether any of the\r\nFijian peculiar genera are home productions. One may instance in this\r\nconnection the genus Pimia, the fruits of which are especially well\r\nsuited for attachment to a bird’s plumage, yet it is only known from\r\nFiji.\r\n\r\nIt should be here observed that no peculiar generic types have been\r\nrecorded from the adjacent Tongan Group, and scarcely any from Samoa.\r\nExcept perhaps with the Palmaceæ, no peculiar genera seem to be\r\nmentioned in Dr. Reinecke’s memoir on Samoa.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Summary._\r\n\r\n(1) The Lobeliaceæ, like the Compositæ, take a prominent place in the\r\nearly Pacific flora, being represented, more particularly in Hawaii but\r\nalso in the East Polynesian or Tahitian region, by endemic genera of\r\ntall shrubby and tree-like species.\r\n\r\n(2) Tree-Lobelias occur in other parts of the world, as in South America\r\nand tropical Africa; but it is especially on the higher slopes of the\r\nmountains of Equatorial Africa that they attain a development comparable\r\nwith that of Hawaii.\r\n\r\n(3) In Hawaii the Tree-Lobelias are most characteristic of the middle\r\nforest-zone (3,000-6,000 feet), where the temperature is mild, the\r\nrainfall heavy, and the atmosphere laden with humidity.\r\n\r\n(4) The affinities of these endemic genera of the Lobeliaceæ are mainly\r\nAmerican; but their generic distinctions have been both exaggerated and\r\ndisguised by redundant growth.\r\n\r\n(5) From the distribution of the genera and species within the Hawaiian\r\nGroup it is evident that, as with the early Compositæ, the original\r\nLobeliaceous immigrants were not all contemporaneous arrivals. Some of\r\nthe genera are on the point of extinction, whilst others are in their\r\nprime.\r\n\r\n(6) The absence of the Lobeliaceæ from the groups of the Fijian area\r\n(Fiji, Tonga, Samoa) is probably to be connected, as in the case of the\r\nabsence of the early Compositæ, with the circumstance that the general\r\ndistribution of these two orders over the tropical Pacific occurred\r\nduring the Tertiary submergence of these archipelagoes.\r\n\r\n(7) These endemic genera of the Lobeliaceæ possess the same facilities\r\nfor dispersal that are owned by other genera with minute seeds, such as\r\nCyrtandra, &c., that are dispersed over the Pacific; but in the case of\r\nthe Lobeliaceæ the agencies of dispersal have been for ages suspended.\r\n\r\n(8) This suspension is to be associated with the diverting of the main\r\nstream of migration from its source in America, during the early age of\r\nthe Lobeliaceæ and Compositæ, to a source on the Asiatic side of the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\n(9) The Hawaiian endemic genera other than those of the Compositæ and\r\nLobeliaceæ arrange themselves in two groups—an earlier group containing\r\nhighly differentiated Caryophyllaceæ and Labiatæ, and belonging to the\r\nage of the Compositæ and Lobeliaceæ; and a later group, characterised by\r\nRubiaceæ and Araliaceæ, which marks the close of the first era, as well\r\nas the change in the main source of the plants from America to the Old\r\nWorld, the beginning of the Hawaiian forests, the appearance of the\r\nRubiaceous drupe, and the first active intervention of frugivorous\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\n(10) Though there are no “difficult” or “impossible” fruits (fruits, the\r\ndispersal of which is not easy to explain) amongst the forty and odd\r\nendemic genera of Hawaii and Tahiti, it is noteworthy that in some cases\r\nthe fruits are seemingly little fitted for dispersal now, and that this\r\ndeterioration in capacity for dispersal is to be frequently associated\r\nwith more or less failure of the inter-island dispersal in the case of\r\nHawaii.\r\n\r\n(11) The interest associated with the Hawaiian endemic genera fails to\r\nattach itself to those of Fiji, where genera only seem to have become\r\npeculiar because they have failed at their sources in the regions to the\r\nwest. The endemic genera of the Compositæ and Lobeliaceæ are here\r\nlacking, and this is true also of the neighbouring Samoan and Tongan\r\nGroups, it being held that the age of the general dispersion of these\r\norders over the Pacific corresponded with the Tertiary submergence of\r\nthe archipelagoes of the Western Pacific. Those of Fiji, which do not\r\namount to ten in number, belong to nearly as many orders and present a\r\nmotley collection such as one might look for in a group much less\r\nisolated than Hawaii and exposed to wave after wave of migration from\r\nthe west.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n         THE ERA OF THE NON-ENDEMIC GENERA OF FLOWERING PLANTS\r\n\r\n    THE MOUNTAIN-FLORAS OF THE PACIFIC ISLANDS AS ILLUSTRATED BY THE\r\n                           NON-ENDEMIC GENERA\r\n\r\nThe mountain-flora of Hawaii.—A third of it derived from high southern\r\n  latitudes.—An American element.—Compared with Tahiti and\r\n  Fiji.—Capacities for dispersal of the genera possessing only endemic\r\n  species.—Acæna, Lagenophora, Plantago, Artemisia, Silene, Vaccinium,\r\n  &c.—Capacities for dispersal of the genera possessing non-endemic\r\n  species.—Cyathodes, Santalum, Carex, Rhynchospora.—Fragaria chilensis,\r\n  Drosera longifolia, Nertera depressa, Luzula campestris.—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\n           THE AGE OF THE ENDEMIC GENERA OF FLOWERING PLANTS.\r\n\r\nWE are now entering an era distinguished from the preceding age of the\r\nendemic genera, the age chiefly of the Compositæ and Lobeliaceæ, by the\r\nfact that the extreme isolation that followed that era no longer\r\nprevails. In a sense these island-floras are in touch again with the\r\nworld around, though the main stream of plant-migration now comes from\r\nthe south and from the west. Yet in a large number of cases, the amount\r\nvarying greatly in the different groups, it is evident that this stream\r\nhas not flowed continuously to the present day. The agencies of\r\ndispersal are often no longer active; but the period of inactivity has\r\nnot been sufficiently prolonged to produce generic distinction, and the\r\ndifferentiating energy has been restricted to the development of new\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nYet within these limits the development of new forms, as indicated in\r\nTable B on p. 233, has often been very great. Thus, nearly half the\r\nHawaiian genera that are non-endemic are composed entirely of species\r\nnot found outside the group; and in this sense they may be regarded as\r\ncut off from the regions around. In Fiji and Tahiti only about a fourth\r\nare in this manner isolated, the agencies of dispersal being still\r\neffective with the majority of the genera. It is apparent, therefore,\r\nthat the same question concerning the cause of the failure of the means\r\nof dispersal presents itself in this era as in the last, and most\r\nmarkedly in the instance of Hawaii.\r\n\r\nThe simplest and quickest plan for bringing into relief the prominent\r\nfeatures of this age is first to regard the genera from the standpoint\r\nof the elevation of their stations. We have before remarked that in the\r\noccurrence of extensive regions of great altitude the Hawaiian Islands\r\ndiffer conspicuously from the groups of Tahiti and Fiji (and I may add\r\nSamoa); and that they present conditions for the development of a\r\ntemperate mountain-flora that are not found at all in Fiji and are\r\nbarely represented in Tahiti. That the Hawaiian flora responds to this\r\ncontrast between the elevations of the three groups is well established;\r\nand I will now proceed to refer more in detail to the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n              THE MOUNTAIN-FLORAS OF THE PACIFIC ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nIn the Hawaiian Islands there are at least 37 or 38 genera, making up\r\nabout 19 or 20 per cent. of those belonging to this era, that may be\r\ndesignated mountain genera, nearly all of them being characterised as\r\nappertaining exclusively or in the main to temperate regions, or as\r\nfrequenting mountain-tops in tropical latitudes. In Tahiti there are\r\nonly 7 or 8 of such genera, about 4 per cent. of the total for the era.\r\nIn Fiji, excluding the Conifers, there are only 4 or 5, or not 2 per\r\ncent. of the whole. In Samoa, which may be included in the Fijian area,\r\nthere are 3, or about 2 per cent. of the total. These are results which\r\nwe might have expected from the varying altitudes of these groups, as\r\ndescribed in Chapter XIX.\r\n\r\nFew things give more pleasure to the botanist than his recognition in\r\nsome remote locality of plants long familiar to him in other regions.\r\nThis will often be his lot on the mountain summits of Hawaii. If he has\r\nbeen a mountain-climber in many countries, he will there notice again\r\nthe genera Artemisia, Geranium, Plantago, Ranunculus, Rubus, Sanicula,\r\nVaccinium, and others that he has met perhaps either in the Rocky\r\nMountains or in the Andes or in Equatorial Africa or in the Himalayas.\r\nIf fresh from Chile he will find on these heights the familiar Gunnera\r\nand the Chilian Strawberry (Fragaria chilensis). If he has been in New\r\nZealand and in the islands of the Southern Ocean he will find old\r\nfriends in the genera Acæna and Coprosma. He may handle once again\r\nplants like Nertera depressa, that he gathered on Tristan da Cunha; and\r\non the boggy summits of some of the mountains he will find the\r\nubiquitous Sun-dew (Drosera longifolia).\r\n\r\nWithin the limited area occupied by the peaks of Tahiti he will find\r\ngenera like Astelia and Coprosma that are at home in New Zealand or in\r\nAntarctic America, and may even find, as in the cases of Coriaria\r\nruscifolia and Nertera depressa, the identical species that are at home\r\nin those distant regions. Even on the summit of Rarotonga he will gather\r\na species of Vaccinium. In Fiji, here and there on some isolated\r\nmountain-top he may come upon a remnant of this Antarctic flora, such as\r\na solitary species of Coprosma or Lagenophora, that will carry him back\r\nfor a moment to high southern latitudes; and in the highlands of Savaii,\r\nin the neighbouring Samoan Group, he will find again Nertera depressa\r\nand a species of Vaccinium. But that which will interest him most in\r\nFiji will be the tall conifers of the genera Dammara, Podocarpus, and\r\nDacrydium, which will bring to him memories perhaps of New Zealand and\r\nsouthern Chile, of South Africa, and of the mountain-woods of Java and\r\nof Southern Japan.\r\n\r\nYet the influence of isolation has been at work amongst the\r\nmountain-plants of all these groups. The agencies that have dispersed\r\nover the tropical Pacific plants from the cold latitudes of the southern\r\nhemisphere, and those that have borne the seeds of Plantago, Sanicula,\r\nand Vaccinium from mountain-top to mountain-top, even though it be to a\r\npeak in mid-ocean, are to a great extent inactive now.\r\n\r\n\r\n THE MOUNTAIN-FLORA OF HAWAII AS ILLUSTRATED BY THE NON-ENDEMIC GENERA.\r\n\r\nLet us look in the first place at Hawaii, where the breaking off of\r\ncommunication with the outside world is especially pronounced. Here, all\r\nthe species of two-thirds or more of the mountain-genera are confined to\r\nthat group. Only in a relatively small number of cases are the species\r\nin touch with the regions outside. The mystery of disconnection that is\r\nso evident in the instance of the peculiar or endemic mountain-genera of\r\nthe Compositæ and Lobeliaceæ and other orders is here again presented to\r\nus, and once more in the upland regions 4,000 to 10,000 feet above the\r\nsea. We will now endeavour to discover from an examination of the\r\npresent distribution of the isolated mountain-genera (those non-endemic\r\ngenera possessing only peculiar species) along what tracks they arrived\r\nat the Hawaiian uplands, tracks, as indicated by the local distribution\r\nof the species, that have been more or less abandoned since.\r\n\r\n_The Mountain Genera with only Endemic Species._—By referring to the\r\nTable on the following page it will be observed that nearly a third of\r\nthese mountain genera have now their principal homes in the high\r\nlatitudes of the southern hemisphere. They are components of what\r\nForster and Hooker have termed the “Antarctic” flora, a collection of\r\nplants that range round the globe in high southern latitudes, namely,\r\nover Fuegia, New Zealand, southern Australia, South Africa, and the\r\nislands of the Southern Ocean, the “Antarctic” islands, as they have\r\nbeen termed. These genera are Acæna, Gunnera, Coprosma, Lagenophora,\r\nAstelia, Oreobolus, and Uncinia. (It is necessary to observe that I am\r\nentirely indebted to the Introduction to the _Botany of the “Challenger”\r\nExpedition_ for my information on the “Antarctic” flora.)\r\n\r\nWe are thus led to expect that some of the other mountain genera may\r\nhave been similarly derived from cool southern latitudes, even though\r\nthey may be scarcely included in the “Antarctic” flora. This is very\r\nprobably true of Myoporum and Exocarpus, two genera that are chiefly\r\ncentred in Australia. A species of Sophora (S. tetraptera) is now one of\r\nthe most widely dispersed of the plants of high southern latitudes, a\r\ncircumstance which at all events explains the capacity for transport\r\nthat the ancestor of the Hawaiian “Mamani” (S. chrysophylla) must have\r\noriginally possessed (see Chapter XV.). Kinship between the Hawaiian\r\nspecies and southern forms has been found in the case of a few of the\r\nwidely ranging genera here represented. Thus Decaisne placed Plantago\r\nprinceps next to P. fernandeziana of Juan Fernandez; whilst according to\r\nHillebrand, Plantago pachyphylla resembles P. aucklandica from the\r\nAuckland Islands. These resemblances are consistently associated with\r\nthe respective range in altitude of the Hawaiian plants, since Plantago\r\nprinceps occurs usually between 2,000 and 4,000 feet, and P. pachyphylla\r\nbetween 6,000 and 8,000 feet, the species of greatest elevation being\r\nrelated with the species of highest latitude. It is thus seen that these\r\nendemic mountain genera with peculiar species have very evident\r\naffinities with the plants of extra-tropical southern latitudes, and\r\nespecially with the “Antarctic” flora. This affinity will also be found,\r\nas will subsequently be noticed, in the case of genera like Cyathodes\r\nand Nertera, where there is still a specific connection with the outside\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE MOUNTAIN-FLORA OF HAWAII, AS REPRESENTED BY THE NON-ENDEMIC\r\n               GENERA (Compiled from Hillebrand’s Flora).\r\n\r\n

between the\r\nrepresentatives of the “Antarctic” genera on the Hawaiian uplands and\r\nthose of high southern latitudes has only been recently broken off. Thus\r\nwith reference to the Hawaiian species of the Cyperaceous genus,\r\nUncinia, it may be observed that although Hillebrand regards it as a\r\ndistinct species, Hemsley (_Intr. Bot. Chall. Exped._, p. 31) remarks\r\nthat it is very near if not the same as a New Zealand species, an\r\naffinity very significant of the source of the mountain plants of this\r\ngroup that are derived from these southern latitudes.\r\n\r\nThe next component to be recognised in these Hawaiian mountain genera\r\nwith peculiar species is a small special American element; and in this\r\nconnection Sanicula and Sisyrinchium may be especially mentioned. The\r\nfirst is mainly North American, and particularly Californian; but there\r\nare two solitary species found on the continents and in oceanic islands\r\nsuch as the Azores. The continental species, Sanicula europæa, occurs\r\nnot only in Europe and Central Asia, but in South Africa, and at high\r\nelevations on the mountains of Equatorial Africa and of Madagascar. It\r\nis not, however, with this widely ranging species that Sanicula\r\nsandwicensis is related, but with S. menziesii, a species from\r\nCalifornia and Oregon (Hillebrand). Sisyrinchium is confined to\r\ntemperate and tropical America; but a singular and suggestive outlier of\r\nthe genus (S. bermudiana) is found in Bermuda.\r\n\r\nThe mountain genera that are distributed on both sides of the Pacific\r\nconstitute about three-fifths of the total. So far as my scanty data\r\nshow, they seem to have reached Hawaii from the four quarters of the\r\ncompass. The probable southerly origin of Plantago has been already\r\nindicated. Hillebrand notes the great resemblance between Lobelia\r\ngaudichaudii and an undescribed species from the Liukiu Islands, lying\r\non the west side of the Pacific. It is likely, also, that the genus\r\nRanunculus reached Hawaii from the west, since one of the species, R.\r\nmauiensis, resembles R. repens of the Old World (Hillebrand); whilst the\r\nother, R. hawaiiensis, comes near R. sericeus of Mauritius (Drake del\r\nCastillo). On the other hand, the genus Rubus may hail from an American\r\nsource, since, in the opinion of Gray, Rubus hawaiiensis, one of the\r\nmountain raspberries, finds its nearest relative in R. spectabilis from\r\nthe north-west coast of America; and there are reasons for believing, as\r\nwill subsequently be shown, that the genus Artemisia has an American\r\nsource. It is also probable that some of these genera have reached\r\nHawaii from the north, since it is likely, as pointed out in a later\r\npage, that the Carices of the Hawaiian uplands came originally from\r\nnorth-eastern Asia.\r\n\r\nIn the previous paragraphs the mountain genera have been considered with\r\nespecial reference to their distribution and source beyond the confines\r\nof the Pacific. If we now briefly discuss them from the standpoint of\r\ntheir distribution within the Pacific, or rather as concerning their\r\npresence or absence in the Fijian and Tahitian groups, we shall see that\r\nto a large extent Hawaii has received its mountain genera of this era\r\nindependently of the other Pacific groups.\r\n\r\n Mountain genera possessing only peculiar species, in Hawaii only        20\r\n Mountain genera possessing only peculiar species, in Hawaii and Fiji     2\r\n Mountain genera possessing only peculiar species, in Hawaii and Tahiti   0\r\n Mountain genera possessing only peculiar species, in all three groups    4\r\n                                                                          —\r\n                                                                         26\r\n\r\nIt is here shown that three-fourths of the genera of the Hawaiian\r\nmountains in this era are not found either in Fiji or Tahiti. This, as\r\nbefore pointed out, is mainly to be attributed to the greater elevation\r\nof the Hawaiian Islands. Had there been an island 13,000 to 14,000 feet\r\nin height in Fiji, we cannot think that any such contrast in the floras\r\nwould have existed. The temperate genera of the Hawaiian uplands would\r\nhave been largely represented in the Fijian flora. Yet although we do\r\nnot find such genera as Ranunculus, Geranium, Sanicula, Uncinia, &c., in\r\nFiji and Tahiti, a small number of the Hawaiian mountain genera have\r\nobtained a scanty footing. This is what we might have expected. Thus,\r\nLagenophora has been found on the mountains of Vanua Levu, and Vaccinium\r\nin Tahiti and Rarotonga; whilst Coprosma and Astelia occur on the tops\r\nof some of the mountains in both regions. In Fiji their distribution\r\nseems sporadic, as shown not in Lagenophora alone, but also by Astelia,\r\nwhich has been found only on the summit of Kandavu.\r\n\r\n_The Capacities for Dispersal of the Hawaiian Non-endemic Mountain\r\nGenera possessing only Peculiar Species._—As shown in the Table, seven,\r\nor 27 per cent., of these genera have fleshy fruits that would attract\r\nfrugivorous birds. In three cases (Gunnera, Coprosma, Myoporum) they are\r\ndrupes, in three others (Rubus, Vaccinium, Astelia) they are berries,\r\nand in one (Exocarpus) there is a nut with a fleshy perigone. It is\r\nparticularly interesting to notice that frugivorous birds, and I include\r\nhere granivorous birds that are known to be frugivorous at times, could\r\nhave transported seeds of the “Antarctic” flora to this group. We can\r\nobserve the process in operation in our own time within the limits of\r\nthe group. It has been long known, and we find it referred to in the\r\npages of Hillebrand’s work, that the wild mountain-goose (Bernicla\r\nsandwicensis) feeds upon the fruits of Coprosma ernodeoides, and of\r\nVaccinium reticulatum, the famous “ohelo.” The fruits of the first are\r\nknown to the natives as “kukai neenee” (droppings of geese), and the\r\nhard stones or pyrenes are very well suited for withstanding the risks\r\nof the digestive process. I found a number of these pyrenes in the\r\nstomach of a mountain-goose shot by my companion, Dr. Krämer, high up\r\nthe slopes of Mauna Loa.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Perkins, Chloridops kona, a big Hawaiian finch, feeds\r\non the fruits of the bastard sandal-tree (Myoporum sandwicense). There\r\nare no “impossible fruits” among the mountain genera of Hawaii, that is\r\nto say, fruits so large that bird agency must be excluded. All of them\r\nare practicable in point of size. Thus amongst the largest, the “stones”\r\nof Gunnera would not exceed 1/5 of an inch (5 mm.), and those of\r\nMyoporum scarcely 1/4 of an inch (6 mm.); whilst the nuts of Exocarpus\r\nrange in the Hawaiian species from 3/10 to 6/10 of an inch (7-15 mm.),\r\nand the beans of Sophora chrysophylla do not at the most exceed 1/4 of\r\nan inch (6 mm.).\r\n\r\nThe principal feature, however, which these mountain genera exhibit from\r\nthe point of view of their dispersal is the number of plants possessing\r\nseeds or fruits capable of adhering to plumage. Half of these genera are\r\nthus characterised. Of these Sanicula and Acæna represent the ordinary\r\nhooked fruits; whilst the fruits of the Grasses and Sedges, Agrostis,\r\nDeschampsia, Trisetum, Poa, Oreobolus, and Uncinia, are enabled by means\r\nof their awns or of their serrated beaks to attach themselves to\r\nplumage, and the same may be said of the carpels of Geranium. The fruits\r\nof Lagenophora and the seeds of Plantago display the capacity of\r\nadhesiveness by means of a gummy secretion.\r\n\r\nOne or two of these genera need further mention. I will first take\r\nAcæna, which is spread all over the south temperate zone both on the\r\ncontinents and on the islands. The Hawaiian species (A. exigua) forms\r\ntussocky growths on the swampy summits of Mount Eeka in Maui, and in\r\nKauai, at an elevation of 6,000 feet above the sea. Numerous observers\r\nrefer to the probable mode of dispersal of the genus in the “Antarctic”\r\nand neighbouring islands. Captain Carmichael, in the instance of Acæna\r\nsanguisorbæ on Tristan da Cunha, observes that it overruns the low\r\nground. Its burr-like fruit, as he describes, “fixes itself on the\r\nslightest touch into one’s clothes, and falling into a hundred pieces\r\ncovers one all over with an unseemly crust of prickly seeds not to be\r\ngot rid of without infinite labour” (_Trans. Linn. Soc._, xii. 483,\r\n1818). Both Mr. Moseley (Wallace’s _Island Life_, p. 250) and Dr. Kidder\r\n(_Bull. U.S. Nat. Mus._, 2) refer to the burrowing habits of the\r\nPetrels, Puffins, and other sea-birds amongst the vegetation covering\r\nthe ground in Tristan da Cunha, Marion Island, Kerguelen, &c., in places\r\nwhere Acæna, amongst other plants, thrives. Mr. Moseley remarks that the\r\nfruits of this genus stick like burrs to feathers, and he looks to\r\nsea-birds for the dispersal of this and similar plants over the ocean.\r\nHe especially notes that the Petrels and other seafowl burrow and breed\r\nhigh up the mountain-slopes of tropical islands as in Tahiti, Viti Levu,\r\nHawaii, and Jamaica.... It should be noted in the case of the Hawaiian\r\nendemic species that it has been found only on two mountain tops; and\r\nthat however active may be the dispersal of the genus in south temperate\r\nlatitudes now, the Hawaiian Islands lie outside the present area of\r\ndispersal.\r\n\r\nThe next mountain genus I will specially refer to is Lagenophora, one of\r\nthe Compositæ. The solitary Hawaiian endemic species, L. mauiensis, is\r\nrestricted to the summit of Mount Eeka, in Maui. In the mountains of\r\nVanua Levu, Fiji, another peculiar species, L. pickeringii, has been\r\nfound; and there is a species, L. petiolata, in the Kermadec Islands\r\n(Hooker, in _Journ. Linn. Soc._, i. 127); but the genus is chiefly\r\ncharacteristic of Australia, New Zealand, and temperate South America,\r\none species occurring both in Fuegia and Tristan da Cunha. The genus has\r\nno pappus; but Hooker in the case of the Kermadec species considered\r\nthat the “viscid fruit” favoured its dispersal; and this may probably be\r\ntrue of the genus.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the capacity for dispersal of the seeds of Plantago, it\r\nmay be pointed out that the seeds of Plantago major, P. lanceolata, &c.,\r\nbecome coated with a mucilaginous material when wetted. In 1892, when\r\nexperimenting on these plants, I found that the wetted seeds adhered\r\nfirmly to a feather, so that it could be blown about without their\r\nbecoming detached. Species of Plantago are so characteristic of the\r\n“alpine” floras of the summits of lofty mountains in the tropics, as in\r\nJava and many other regions, that the mode of dispersal has always been\r\na subject of curiosity. I cannot myself doubt that this is the\r\nexplanation of the occurrence of the representatives of the genus that\r\nnow thrive as endemic species on the higher slopes of the Hawaiian\r\nmountains. This method of dispersal for Plantago is recognised by recent\r\nwriters on the subject of seed-dispersal. (In a paper in _Science\r\nGossip_ for September, 1894, I dealt with the “mucous adhesiveness” of\r\nsuch seeds as a factor in dispersal. The subject had previously been\r\ndiscussed by Kerner in one of the earlier volumes of his\r\n_Pflanzenleben_; and I have summed up some of the results in Note 43 of\r\nthe present volume.) My readers can readily ascertain by a simple\r\nexperiment that a bird pecking the fruit-spikes in wet weather would\r\noften carry away some of the sticky seeds in its plumage. Several years\r\nago, when I was endeavouring to examine the condition of these seeds in\r\nthe droppings of a canary, my efforts were defeated by the bird itself,\r\nsince, in spite of all my care, some seeds and capsules were always\r\ncarried by the bird on its feathers into the clean cage reserved for the\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nThe plants of these mountain genera possessing dry seeds or fruits\r\nneither very large nor very minute and suitable for bird-food are\r\nRanunculus, Viola, Vicia, Sophora, Artemisia, Sisyrinchium, six in all,\r\nor 24 per cent. of the total. On the probable method of transport of the\r\nancestors of these endemic species the following remarks may be made.\r\nWith regard to Ranunculus, some authors like C. M. Weed\r\n(_Seed-Travellers_, p. 48, Boston, 1899) perceive in the curved or\r\nhooked beaks of the achenes a means of attaching the fruit to plumage.\r\nThis no doubt applies to some species, and it is advocated by Ekstam for\r\nsome of the plants of the Nova Zembla flora. There are others to which\r\nthis explanation would not be applicable, and the achenes of the\r\nHawaiian species do not appear to be specially fitted for this mode of\r\ntransport. I have found the achenes of Ranunculus frequently in the\r\nstomachs of birds in England, in partridges frequently, and in wild\r\nducks at times. Those of certain species that possess buoyancy are\r\ncommon in the floating seed-drift of rivers, as of the Thames (_Journ.\r\nLinn. Soc. Bot._, xxix. 333), and they would probably in this way be\r\noften swallowed by waterfowl.\r\n\r\nI have but few data directly relating to the dispersal of seeds of Viola\r\nby birds. From the frequent occurrence of species in alpine floras, as\r\nin the Caucasus, the Great Atlas, in the mountains of Equatorial Africa,\r\nin Madagascar, &c., it may be inferred that birds transport the seeds\r\nbetween the higher levels of many continental ranges in tropical regions\r\nand to the mountain-slopes of neighbouring large islands. Viola\r\nabyssinica, for instance, which occurs in Madagascar, is spread over the\r\nelevated mountain ranges of tropical Africa. With regard to the five\r\nHawaiian species, it may be remarked that three of them are bog species\r\nand two occur in dry situations. The first are most characteristic of\r\nthe mountains, one species occurring on the summit of Mount Eeka, 6,000\r\nfeet above the sea. Judging from the stations alone, at least two\r\nspecies were originally introduced into the Hawaiian Group.\r\n\r\nViola seeds, as indicated by my experiments on the different British\r\nspecies, including Viola palustris, are not buoyant, and there is no\r\npossibility of the seeds being picked up by birds in floating drift.\r\nThere is, however, a possible means of dispersal in birds’ plumage by\r\nmeans of the mucosity of the seeds of some species. Thus, although this\r\nis not exhibited, as shown by my experiments, by Viola canina and V.\r\npalustris, it is well displayed by the Field-Pansy (V. tricolor). I\r\nfound that the seeds of this species, after lying a little time in\r\nwater, were thickly covered with mucus, and that they adhered to a\r\nfeather, on drying, as firmly as if gummed. This did not, however, come\r\nunder my notice in the case of the seeds of one of the Hawaiian species,\r\nV. chamissoniana, examined by me. One sometimes observes Viola canina in\r\nEngland growing in places, as in the crevices and on the tops of old\r\nwalls, where its seeds could have only been carried by birds. In some\r\ncases the propellent force of the seed ejected by the contracting valves\r\nof the capsule would explain queer stations. In its power of\r\nseed-expulsion, Viola chamissoniana, the common Hawaiian species, is\r\njust as active as our British species.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Leguminous genus Vicia we have the observation of\r\nFocke on the dispersal of its seeds by pigeons, as described before on\r\npage 150.\r\n\r\nSophora chrysophylla, the “Mamani” of the natives and one of the most\r\nfamiliar of the trees of the Hawaiian mountains, is discussed at length\r\nin Chapter XV., where the difficulty of supposing that its seeds could\r\nbe transported unharmed in a bird’s stomach half-way across the Pacific\r\nis pointed out; and it is suggested that it was more probably derived\r\nfrom a littoral species brought by the currents. However, the point is a\r\ndebatable one, and the seeds of the “Mamani” can scarcely be regarded as\r\n“impossible” from the standpoint of dispersal.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the possibilities of dispersal of the achenes of\r\nArtemisia, some very suggestive indications are to be obtained from a\r\npaper by Mr. D. Douglas on the North American Tetraonidæ published in\r\nthe _Transactions of the Linnæan Society_ for 1833. The “Cock of the\r\nPlains” (Tetrao urophasianus), as we here learn, makes its nest on the\r\nground under the shade of Artemisia bushes, and lives on the foliage and\r\nfruits of these and other plants. This bird is plentiful in Columbia and\r\nNorth California, and another allied species is mentioned which lives on\r\nthe same sort of food. Later authors refer to these and other birds of\r\nthe same family as living chiefly on the Sage-brush (Artemisia\r\ntridentata), a plant prevailing over great regions of the plains as well\r\nas on the slopes of the Sierra Nevada and of the Rocky Mountains.\r\nAccording to Dr. Sernander (page 228), birds when feeding on the fruits\r\nof Artemisia vulgaris in the district of Upsala scatter them about and\r\nthus aid in its dispersal. Artemisia achenes, since they have neither\r\npappus nor other appendages, nor any special adhesiveness when wetted,\r\ndepend largely on their small size and light weight to aid them in\r\ndispersal. (Those of A. absinthium measure a millimetre in length, or\r\n1/25 of an inch, whilst those of A. vulgaris measure 1·8 mm., or 1/14 of\r\nan inch.) Driven as we are to look to bird-dispersal for the means of\r\ntransport of Artemisia achenes, it is interesting to find a possible\r\nsource of the Hawaiian endemic species on the nearest American mainland,\r\neven though it is some 2,000 miles away. It is assumed that they would\r\nbe ordinarily carried in adherent soil or entangled in the feathers, and\r\non rare occasions in the bird’s stomach.\r\n\r\nThe small seeds of Sisyrinchium possess no means of adherence to\r\nplumage. They are crustaceous, and in cases where the stomach and\r\nintestines of a bird are well filled with other food they are quite\r\ncapable of resisting injury. The solitary Hawaiian species has,\r\naccording to Hillebrand, a range in altitude from 3,500 to 7,000 feet. I\r\nfound this pretty herb most abundant on the “cattle-plains” of Hawaii\r\nbetween 5,000 and 6,000 feet, where it is evidently in part dispersed by\r\nthe cattle and other animals. The seeds are very small, being about a\r\nmillimetre in size, and when dried nearly 100 go to a grain (0·65\r\ndecigramme). They might thus also be transported in mud on birds’ feet.\r\n\r\nFor the mode of dispersal of the minute seeds of Lobelia, the last of\r\nthe mountain genera to be specially noticed, I must refer the reader to\r\nthe remarks on this subject in Chapter XXII. They would probably be\r\ncarried in soil adhering to the legs or feet of a bird.\r\n\r\nThere are one or two interesting points relating to the temperate genus\r\nSilene, which is represented on these mountains. The four Hawaiian\r\nspecies show a great range in altitude. Thus, whilst S. struthioloides\r\nfinds its home in Hawaii and Maui at elevations of 5,000 to 9,000 feet,\r\nanother species (S. lanceolata) thrives equally at elevations of 5,000\r\nor 6,000 feet on the central plateau of Hawaii and at heights only of\r\n300 to 500 feet above the sea. Although I have not yet come upon any\r\ndirect reference to the mode of dispersal of the small seeds of this\r\ngenus, there is little doubt that their rough tuberculated surfaces\r\nwould favour their attachment to plumage. A very significant\r\nobservation, however, is made by Jens Holmboe in a paper on littoral\r\nplants in the interior of Norway. He refers to the occurrence in no\r\nsmall quantity of Silene maritima on the top of “Linnekleppen,” 331\r\nmetres high, one of the highest peaks of Smaalenene, and distant about\r\n29 kilometres from the nearest coast (_Strandplanter i det indre af\r\nNorge_, “Naturen,” Bergen, 1899). Sernander (p. 405), commenting on this\r\nobservation, remarks that since bare hill-tops are frequented by birds,\r\nsuch an agency in this instance is not impossible.\r\n\r\nI will conclude these remarks on the non-endemic Hawaiian mountain\r\ngenera possessing only peculiar species, with a few observations on the\r\ngenus Vaccinium in the Pacific. This genus is known to be distributed\r\nover the northern hemisphere and to occur on the uplands of tropical\r\nmountains, as, for instance, on the summits of the Java mountains and on\r\nthe high levels of the Equatorial Andes at altitudes even of 15,000 to\r\n16,000 feet. There are apparently only some four or five species known\r\nfrom the Pacific islands, from Hawaii, the Marquesas, Tahiti, Rarotonga,\r\nSamoa, and the New Hebrides, and it would almost seem that these can be\r\nreduced to one or two species. Although not yet recorded from Fiji, the\r\nprobability of the genus being represented on some of the mountains is\r\npointed out by Seemann. Of these Pacific forms a single species, V.\r\ncereum, is spread over the East Polynesian region including the\r\nMarquesas, Tahiti, and Rarotonga; and, according to Hillebrand, V.\r\nreticulatum, one of the two endemic Hawaiian species, is nearly related\r\nto it. Even the New Hebrides species (V. macgillivrayi) resembles it,\r\naccording to Seemann, in general appearance. That there has been a\r\nsingle Pacific polymorphous species is, as shown below, not impossible;\r\nbut Reinecke, in describing in 1898 the Samoan species, V. antipodum,\r\nwas under the impression that it was the only species known from the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, and says nothing of its affinity to other Pacific\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nA few words on the station and habit of Vaccinium in the Pacific islands\r\nmay be here of interest. In Hawaii there are, according to Hillebrand,\r\ntwo species, a high-level form, V. reticulatum, occurring at elevations\r\nof 4,000 to 8,000 feet, and a low-level form, V. penduliflorum, ranging\r\nbetween 1,000 and 4,000 feet. I may, however, remark that the last\r\nspecies occasionally came under my notice at elevations of 6,000 to\r\n7,000 feet. This species exhibits much variation, and Gray, Wawra, and\r\nother botanists have evidently not been always able to distinguish\r\nbetween the two species in their varying forms. It is not only\r\ndistinguished from the high-level species by its lower station, but also\r\nby its epiphytic habit, a circumstance that, as pointed out below, may\r\nexplain some of the differences, since such a habit is bound up with the\r\ndifference in station. It seems, therefore, safer to regard them as\r\nstation forms of one species which is closely allied to V. cereum, the\r\nspecies of the South Pacific, an inference which, if well founded, would\r\nmake highly probable the view that there has been a single polymorphous\r\nPacific species.... In Tahiti, as we learn from Nadeaud, V. cereum\r\noccurs on the mountain-tops at altitudes exceeding 800 metres (2,600\r\nfeet). In Rarotonga, according to Cheeseman, it is found on the summits\r\nof most of the higher hills extending almost to the summit of the\r\nisland, 2,250 feet above the sea. The Samoan species, V. antipodum of\r\nReinecke, which that botanist considers as probably one with V. whitmei,\r\na Polynesian (Samoa?) species originally described by Baron F. von\r\nMüller, grows in the central mountains of Savaii at an elevation of\r\n1,500 metres (4,920 feet).\r\n\r\nThese Pacific species of Vaccinium, as on tropical mountains of the\r\ncontinents, occasionally assume an epiphytic habit, and it is here, as\r\nabove observed, that lies one of the distinctions between the Hawaiian\r\nspecies. V. penduliflorum, the low-level form, occurs typically in the\r\nforests, where, according to Hillebrand, it grows on the trunks of old\r\ntrees. The trees, however, may be quite in their prime, and I have\r\nobserved it growing in the fork of the trunk of an Olapa tree\r\n(Cheirodendron gaudichaudii). It is in this connection of significance\r\nto notice that a variety found in open glades and on grassy slopes is\r\ndescribed by Hillebrand as terrestrial in habit. The other high-level\r\nform, V. reticulatum, grows gregariously on open ground, and is\r\ntypically terrestrial in its habit. The Samoan species, as we learn from\r\nReinecke, grows on trees, as on the branches of Gardenia. The epiphytic\r\nhabit of species of Vaccinium is especially discussed by Schimper in the\r\ncase of plants growing on the Java mountains. He there shows\r\n(_Plant-Geography_, i. 14) that species which are epiphytes in the\r\nvirgin forest become terrestrial plants in the treeless alpine region.\r\nThis interchange of station, which is exhibited by several other plants,\r\nincluding orchids and ferns, is connected with their xerophilous\r\ncharacteristics, and is given by Schimper as an example of the\r\ninterchange of physiologically dry habitats.\r\n\r\nOf the mode of dispersal of Vaccinium by frugivorous birds, much has\r\nbeen written and much will be familiar to my readers. The berries of V.\r\nreticulatum are known to be the principal food of the Hawaiian\r\nmountain-goose. But probably birds of the grouse family have been the\r\nchief agents in distributing the genus over the continents. I have\r\nfrequently found the fruits in the stomachs of the Black Cock (Tetrao\r\ntetrix), the Scotch Grouse (Lagopus scoticus), and the Capercailzie\r\n(Tetrao urogallus); but the same story comes from all over the northern\r\nhemisphere. The Willow Grouse (Lagopus albus), which travels round the\r\nglobe, is known to feed on them. Hesselman in Sweden and Ekstam in Nova\r\nZembla have especially investigated the dispersal of Vaccinium by Tetrao\r\ntetrix and Lagopus (see Sernander, pp. 6, 226); and according to Mr.\r\nDouglas and others the different species of Tetrao that frequent the\r\nsubalpine regions of the Rocky Mountains and the uplands of Columbia and\r\nNorth California subsist on Vaccinium fruits. This family is not now\r\nrepresented in the Hawaiian avifauna; but it is noteworthy, as indicated\r\nby the differentiation of the Pacific species of Vaccinium, that\r\ndispersal of the genus is there almost suspended except within the\r\nregion of Eastern Polynesia. It is probable that numerous other birds,\r\nexcept the Hawaiian goose, aided the original dispersal.\r\n\r\n_The Mountain Genera with both Endemic and Non-endemic Species._—I pass\r\non now to consider those Hawaiian mountain genera that possess species\r\nsome of which are confined to the group, whilst others occur in regions\r\noutside the islands. They are not many, as may be seen from the table\r\nbefore given, and but few of them are entirely restricted to the high\r\nlevels, a range in altitude that may be frequently associated with great\r\nlateral extension of the genus over different latitudes. Here the agents\r\nof dispersal have through some species in each genus preserved a\r\nconnection with the outer world, though it may be restricted to the\r\nlimits of the Pacific islands.\r\n\r\nCyathodes tameiameiæ, an Epacridaceous species found also in the uplands\r\nof Tahiti, occurs, according to Hillebrand, on all the Hawaiian Islands,\r\nfrom 1,800 feet up to the limit of vegetation 10,000 feet and over above\r\nthe sea. I found it, however, at even lower levels. On the Puna coast of\r\nHawaii, associated with Metrosideros polymorpha, Osteomeles\r\nanthyllidifolia, and other inland plants, it descends on the surface of\r\nancient lava-flows to the coast wherever the bolder spurs reach the\r\nsea-border. The other species, C. imbricata, is more exclusively\r\nconfined to the greater altitudes. It is endemic, and may possibly be a\r\nstation form of the other species.\r\n\r\nThe six species of Lysimachia are found at different elevations, one\r\nnear the sea-shore, others at altitudes of 2,000 to 3,000 feet, and\r\nothers again at elevations of 6,000 feet. Chenopodium sandwicheum occurs\r\nat all elevations from near the coast to the high inland plains of\r\nHawaii and to the upper slopes of Mauna Kea, that is to say, up to\r\naltitudes of 6,000 or 7,000 feet. Hillebrand observes that it is a low\r\ndecumbent plant at the coast, and may become arborescent with a height\r\nof 12 to 15 feet in the upper forests of Mauna Kea.\r\n\r\nThe species of Santalum (sandal-wood trees) also display great vertical\r\nrange in these islands. Though S. freycinetianum, which is also a\r\nTahitian species, is most at home in the forests 2,000 to 4,000 feet\r\nabove the sea, it has, as Hillebrand informs us, a dwarfed form that\r\nextends far up the mountain slopes of Mauna Loa and Hualalai to\r\nelevations of 7,000 or 8,000 feet, and another dwarfed shrubby variety\r\nthat grows only near the sea-shore. Another species, S. haleakalæ,\r\noccurs as a tall shrub on Haleakala at elevations of 8,000 to 10,000\r\nfeet. Among the sedges, most of those of the genera Carex and\r\nRhynchospora are found at altitudes of between 3,000 and 7,000 feet, and\r\ntwo grasses of the genus Deyeuxia occur at elevations of 6,000 to 8,000\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nAmongst these Hawaiian mountain genera with both endemic and non-endemic\r\nspecies there are no plants possessing fruits which from their size\r\ncould be with difficulty regarded as dispersed by birds. The mode of\r\ndispersal of these plants is in some cases indeed not far to seek. Thus\r\nin the stomach of an Hawaiian goose (Bernicla sandwicensis), shot by my\r\ncompanion Dr. Krämer on the slopes of Mauna Loa, I found a number of the\r\n“stones” of Cyathodes tameiameiæ, the plant being abundant in fruit in\r\nthe immediate vicinity. It is highly probable that the seeds of Santalum\r\nhave been carried over the Pacific by frugivorous birds. We learn from\r\nDr. Brandis that Santalum album in India is mainly spread through the\r\nagency of birds (_Bot. Chall. Exped._, iii. 13). The drupes of the\r\nPacific species, S. freycinetianum, that occurs alike in Hawaii, the\r\nMarquesas, and Tahiti (Drake del Castillo), measure about half an inch.\r\nThere can be little doubt that with this tree, as with the species of\r\nCyathodes above mentioned, which also links together Tahiti and Hawaii,\r\nthere has been up to recent times an interchange by means of frugivorous\r\nbirds between these two regions, some 2,000 miles apart.\r\n\r\nThe small seeds of the capsular fruits of Lysimachia could be\r\ntransported in birds’ plumage or in dried soil attached to their feet or\r\nfeathers. The seed-like fruits of Chenopodium were probably dispersed by\r\nsome granivorous bird, much as nowadays our partridges carry about in\r\ntheir stomachs the similar fruits of Atriplex. The long-awned fruits of\r\nDeyeuxia were, it is likely, transported in birds’ plumage, and\r\ndoubtless also those of Panicum; whilst the nutlets of Carex and\r\nRhynchospora might have been carried about in a similar fashion.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the non-endemic species of these Hawaiian mountain\r\ngenera may perhaps aid us in determining the original source of the\r\ngenus as well as in confirming the conclusions formed concerning the\r\nother mountain genera that only possess species restricted to the group.\r\nLysimachia, Chenopodium, Carex, Rhynchospora, Deyeuxia, and Panicum are\r\nfound in both the Old and New Worlds. Since Hillebrand remarks that one\r\nof the six species of Lysimachia (L. spathulata) occurs in Japan and in\r\nthe Liukiu, Bonin, and Marianne groups, we have here a valuable\r\nindication of the route followed by a genus that has not been recorded\r\nfrom the oceanic groups of the South Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe capricious distribution of the genus Carex in the Pacific is\r\nremarkable, and it is noticed by Hemsley in the Introduction to the\r\n_Botany of the “Challenger” Expedition_. No species have been recorded\r\nfrom Tahiti, the Marquesas, and Rarotonga, but three Fijian species are\r\nmentioned by Hemsley, and there is another in Samoa. Of the five\r\nHawaiian species given by Hillebrand, two are endemic. Of the rest, C.\r\nwahuensis (oahuensis), Meyer, occurs also in Korea and Japan, whilst C.\r\nbrunnea, Thunb., is found in Japan and Australia, and the third, C.\r\npropinqua, Nees., occurs all round the border of the Pacific Ocean, from\r\nKamschatka through Alaska south to the Straits of Magellan. These three\r\nspecies all possess a home in common in north-east Asia, and probably\r\nthere lies the source of the Hawaiian species of Carex—a conclusion\r\nwhich would help to explain the irregular distribution of the genus\r\namongst the South Pacific groups.\r\n\r\nThe genus Rhynchospora occurs alike in the Hawaiian, Tahitian, and\r\nFijian islands; but the groups in the North and South Pacific seem to\r\nhave been independently supplied with the original species, since R.\r\naurea, a widely spread tropical species, ranging the South Pacific from\r\nNew Caledonia to Tahiti, has not been recorded from Hawaii. A connection\r\nbetween Hawaii and the Australian region seems to be indicated by a\r\nspecies of Deyeuxia (D. forsteri) that is found also in Easter Island,\r\nAustralia, and New Zealand, and by the presence of the Australian and\r\nNew Zealand genus Cyathodes in Hawaii, though the existence of a species\r\ncommon to both Tahiti and Hawaii goes to show that the route followed by\r\nthe genus lay through Eastern Polynesia. It is also not unlikely that\r\nthe genus Santalum reached Hawaii through Eastern Polynesia, since two\r\nforms found in Hawaii and Tahiti are closely allied, and are, in fact,\r\nregarded by Drake del Castillo as the same species. The genus occurs in\r\ntropical Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.\r\n\r\nLooking at the indications above given, I should be inclined to think\r\nthat the genera Lysimachia and Carex reached the Hawaiian mountains from\r\ntemperate Asia or the islands off its Pacific coast, and that Cyathodes,\r\nSantalum, and Deyeuxia hail from the Australian or New Zealand region by\r\nway of Eastern Polynesia.\r\n\r\n_The Mountain Genera possessing no Endemic Species._—The few remaining\r\nmountain plants of Hawaii to be considered are solitary, widely ranging\r\nspecies of genera that here possess no peculiar species. Such may be\r\nregarded as belonging to the latest age of the indigenous plants. They\r\nstill keep up, or kept up until recently, the connection with the world\r\noutside Hawaii, and among them one may name here Fragaria chilensis,\r\nDrosera longifolia, Nertera depressa, and Luzula campestris.\r\n\r\nFragaria chilensis, the Chilian strawberry, flourishes at elevations of\r\nbetween 4,000 and 6,000 feet on the Hawaiian mountains. Its fruits,\r\naccording to Hillebrand and other authors, are much appreciated by the\r\nwild goose of the islands. This plant ranges in America from Chile north\r\nto Alaska; and Drake del Castillo is doubtless on safe ground when he\r\nassumes that a congener of this bird originally brought the species from\r\nthe nearest part of the American continent, namely from California\r\n(_Remarques_, &c., p. 8). In this connection it should be remembered\r\nthat one of the endemic mountain-raspberries of Hawaii (Rubus\r\nhawaiiensis) finds its nearest relative, according to Gray, in Rubus\r\nspectabilis, a species from the north-west coast of America.\r\n\r\nThe species of Sun-dew, Drosera longifolia, hitherto found only on the\r\nmarshy tableland of Kauai at an elevation of 4,000 feet above the sea,\r\noccurs both in Asia and North America. Its minute fusiform seeds are\r\nvery light in weight, and might readily become entangled in a bird’s\r\nplumage, or they could be carried in adherent dried mud.\r\n\r\nLuzula campestris, which grows on the high mountains of the Hawaiian\r\ngroup from 3,000 feet upward, is also found in Tahiti. It is widely\r\ndistributed in cool latitudes, and there is no special indication of its\r\nsource. Its seeds are especially well suited for adhering to birds’\r\nfeathers. When experimenting on these seeds in 1893 I ascertained that\r\nwhether freshly gathered or kept for more than a year they became on\r\nwetting coated with mucus, and adhered firmly to a feather on drying.\r\nThere are many ways in which the “sticky” seeds in wet weather might\r\nfasten themselves to a bird’s plumage. The plant-materials might be\r\nused, for instance, for making nests. The Sea Eagle (Aquila albicilla),\r\nas we learn from Mr. Napier (_Lakes and Rivers_), uses materials derived\r\nfrom Luzula sylvatica in the construction of its nest.\r\n\r\nNertera depressa, a creeping Rubiaceous plant, with red, fleshy drupes\r\ncontaining two coriaceous pyrenes, is found in all the Hawaiian Islands\r\nat elevations of 2,500 to 5,000 feet, and it grows on the mountains of\r\nTahiti at altitudes over 3,000 feet. The genus is widely diffused over\r\nthe southern hemisphere. This particular species is characteristic of\r\nthe Antarctic flora, being found all round the south temperate zone\r\n(excepting South Africa) in New Zealand, Fuegia, the Falkland Islands,\r\nand Tristan da Cunha, and extending up the Andes to Mexico, occurring\r\nalso on the summits of Malayan mountains at elevations of 9,000 to\r\n10,500 feet above the sea, as on Pangerango in West Java (Schimper), and\r\non Kinabalu in North Borneo (Stapf). Captain Carmichael, who resided on\r\nTristan da Cunha in the early part of last century, states (_Trans.\r\nLinn. Soc._, xii. 483) that its drupes are eaten by a species of thrush\r\nand by a bunting. Professor Moseley, who visited the island in the\r\n_Challenger_ many years after, remarks that its fruits are “the\r\nfavourite food of the remarkable endemic thrush, Nesocichla eremita,”\r\nthe bunting being Emberiza brasiliensis (_Bot. Chall. Exped._, ii. 141).\r\nIt would seem most likely that the Hawaiian Islands received this\r\nrepresentative of the Antarctic flora through the Tahitian Islands, as\r\nin the case of the species of Cyathodes common to both these groups.\r\n\r\nLooking at the indications of these four widely ranging plants, the\r\nChilian strawberry (Fragaria chilensis), the Sun-dew (Drosera\r\nlongifolia), Nertera depressa, and Luzula campestris, it may be inferred\r\nthat with the exception of Nertera they all reached Hawaii from either\r\nthe Asiatic or American sides of the North Pacific, the last route being\r\nevident in the case of the strawberry. Nertera depressa was probably\r\nderived from southern latitudes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Summary._\r\n\r\n(1) The second era of the flowering plants of the Pacific islands is\r\nindicated by the non-endemic genera. Here also the isolating influences\r\nhave been generally active, and the work of dispersal is in some regions\r\nlargely suspended. Thus in Hawaii nearly half the non-endemic genera\r\npossess only species that are restricted to the group, whilst in Fiji\r\nand Tahiti about a fourth are thus isolated.\r\n\r\n(2) The contrast in the elevations of the islands of the Hawaiian,\r\nTahitian, and Fijian regions is reflected in the development of an\r\nextensive mountain-flora in Hawaii, in its scanty development in Tahiti,\r\nand, excluding the Fijian conifers, in a mere remnant in Fiji and Samoa.\r\n\r\n(3) The influence of isolation has been very active in the Hawaiian\r\nmountains, since about two-thirds of the genera contain only species\r\nconfined to the group, and are thus disconnected from the world outside.\r\n\r\n(4) Amongst these disconnected Hawaiian mountain genera, Antarctic or\r\nNew Zealand genera, like Acæna, Gunnera, Coprosma, and Lagenophora,\r\nconstitute nearly a third. The American element, represented, for\r\ninstance, by Sanicula and Sisyrinchium, is small; whilst the genera\r\nfound on both sides of the Pacific form more than one-half of the total,\r\nand include genera like Ranunculus, Viola, Rubus, Artemisia, Vaccinium,\r\nand Plantago, that often represent the flora of the temperate zone on\r\nthe summits of tropical mountains. Three-fourths of these genera are not\r\nfound either in Fiji or in Tahiti.\r\n\r\n(5) The proportion of the disconnected Hawaiian mountain genera\r\npossessing seeds or seedvessels suited for dispersal in a bird’s plumage\r\nis very large, quite half belonging to this category; whilst only about\r\na fourth have fruits that would be dispersed by frugivorous birds.\r\n\r\n(6) The Hawaiian mountain genera that still remain in touch with the\r\nexternal world through species found outside the islands whilst other\r\nspecies are confined to the group, present a later stage in the\r\nplant-stocking. Their widely ranging species, which would be dispersed\r\neither by frugivorous birds, as with Santalum and Cyathodes, or in\r\nbirds’ plumage, as with Lysimachia, Carex, and Deyeuxia, seem to\r\nindicate that the main lines of migration for these genera have been\r\nfrom temperate Asia and from the Australian and New Zealand region, the\r\nlast by way of Eastern Polynesia.\r\n\r\n(7) The latest stage of the Hawaiian mountain-flora is exemplified by\r\nthose genera that are only represented in the group by a solitary\r\nwidely-ranging species, such as Fragaria chilensis, Nertera depressa,\r\nDrosera longifolia, and Luzula campestris. It is our own age; and birds\r\nare shown to be actual agents in the dispersal of the two first-named\r\nspecies and to be probable agents with the two other species. The two\r\nlast-named species probably reached Hawaii from one or other side of the\r\nNorth Pacific; whilst Fragaria chilensis doubtless hails from the\r\nadjacent part of the American continent, and Nertera depressa from high\r\nsouthern latitudes by way of Tahiti.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n         THE MOUNTAIN-FLORAS OF THE TAHITIAN AND FIJIAN REGIONS\r\n\r\nThe mountain-flora of the Tahitian region, as illustrated by the\r\n  non-endemic genera.—Derived chiefly from high southern\r\n  latitudes.—Weinmannia, Coprosma, Vaccinium, Astelia, Coriaria,\r\n  Cyathodes, Nertera depressa, Luzula campestris.—The mountain flora of\r\n  Rarotonga.—The mountain-flora of the Fijian region, as illustrated by\r\n  the non-endemic genera.—Weinmannia, Lagenophora, Coprosma, Astelia,\r\n  Vaccinium, Nertera depressa.—The Fijian Coniferæ.—Dammara, Podocarpus,\r\n  Dacrydium.—Not belonging to the present era of dispersal.—The age of\r\n  dispersal of the Coniferæ in the Pacific.—Earlier than the age of\r\n  Compositæ and Lobeliaceæ.—The first in the Mesozoic period.—The last\r\n  in the Tertiary period.—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE MOUNTAIN-FLORA OF THE TAHITIAN REGION AS ILLUSTRATED BY THE\r\n                           NON-ENDEMIC GENERA\r\n\r\nTHIS floral region of the Pacific corresponds with the limits of Eastern\r\nPolynesia, and includes not only the Tahitian group proper, but also the\r\nCook, Austral, Paumotuan, and Marquesan groups. It is only, however, in\r\nTahiti, the peaks of which rise to over 7,000 feet above the sea, that\r\nwe should expect to find such a mountain-flora, since the islands of the\r\nother groups are much lower, the highest of them in the Marquesan group\r\nbarely exceeding 4,000 feet. Yet even in Tahiti it is not possible to\r\nspeak of a mountain-flora in the sense that we attach to it in Hawaii.\r\nThe elevated area of its interior is, as described in Chapter XIX.,\r\nrelatively very small; whilst, as Drake del Castillo points out, the\r\nconditions presented by the steep mountain-slopes rarely afford a hold\r\nfor trees of any size, ferns often predominating in the higher levels.\r\nStill, we can observe the traces of such a flora, and it is in this\r\nsense only that the term “mountain-genera” is used in relation with this\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\n\r\n      _Mountain-Genera of the Tahitian or East Polynesian Region._\r\n\r\n Weinmannia, Saxifragaceæ, from New Zealand.           }\r\n Coprosma, Rubiaceæ, from New Zealand.                 }all species\r\n Vaccinium, Vacciniaceæ, from the northern hemisphere. }endemic.\r\n Astelia, Liliaceæ, from New Zealand.                  }\r\n\r\n Coriaria, Coriariaceæ, from New Zealand   }some\r\n Cyathodes, Epacridaceæ, from New Zealand  }species\r\n                                           }endemic\r\n\r\n Nertera depressa, Rubiaceæ, a species of the Antarctic flora.\r\n Luzula campestris, Juncaceæ, from the northern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe Tahitian non-endemic mountain-genera, though scanty in number, are\r\nof considerable interest to the student of plant-dispersal. Among those\r\npossessing only species that are confined to Eastern Polynesia, genera\r\nthat would be regarded as belonging to a past era of dispersal,\r\nWeinmannia, Coprosma, Vaccinium, and Astelia may be mentioned.\r\n\r\nWeinmannia, a Saxifragaceous genus of trees and shrubs, not represented\r\nin Hawaii, but recorded from almost all the elevated oceanic groups of\r\nthe tropical South Pacific, as well as from the New Hebrides and New\r\nCaledonia, has its home in South America, more particularly in the\r\nAndes, and also occurs in New Zealand, Tasmania, and the Mascarene\r\nIslands. One can scarcely doubt that, as in the case of Coprosma, the\r\nPacific Islands derived their species originally from high southern\r\nlatitudes, as from New Zealand, the absence of the genus from Hawaii\r\nnegativing an American origin. Of the two Tahitian species, one is\r\npeculiar to Tahiti, whilst the other, W. parviflora, which is\r\nconspicuous on the mountain-crests at elevations of 3,000 feet and over,\r\noccurs also in the Marquesas. Another species grows in abundance in the\r\ninterior of Rarotonga. Samoa possesses two species, one of which, W.\r\naffinis, occurs in Fiji, and the other, W. samoensis, which frequents\r\nthe mountains at elevations of 1,500 to 3,300 feet, is seemingly\r\nendemic. Fiji possesses four or five species of Weinmannia occurring at\r\nall altitudes up to 2,000 feet, of which some are evidently peculiar.\r\nThe capsular fruits of this genus contain hairy seeds that would\r\nprobably become entangled in a bird’s plumage. Dispersal by birds is\r\ndistinctedly indicated in the curious observation of Dr. Reinecke in the\r\ncase of the Samoan peculiar species. The seeds, he says, appear to\r\ngerminate by preference on the bark of other trees, young plants growing\r\nepiphytically being of frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nThere is some evidence that the species of Weinmannia, about ten in all,\r\nfound in the tropical islands of the open Pacific are derived from one\r\nor two polymorphous species. As we learn from Mr. Cheeseman, the\r\nRarotongan species, W. rarotongensis, has considerable affinity to\r\nseveral closely allied Polynesian species, and its nearest allies are a\r\nFijian and Samoan species, W. vitiensis and W. samoensis. Possibly, he\r\nremarks, fuller materials may lead to the union of several of these\r\nforms under one species.\r\n\r\nThe interesting New Zealand genus Coprosma, which we have noticed in\r\nHawaii, occurs also in the Tahitian region and Fiji; and it will be\r\nfurther discussed under the last-named locality. The genus Vaccinium has\r\nbeen previously dealt with in Chapter XXIII.\r\n\r\nThe Liliaceous genus Astelia may be considered as representing, like\r\nCoprosma, the Antarctic or New Zealand flora in the higher levels\r\n(usually) of the islands of the tropical Pacific, where it grows both on\r\ntrees and on the ground. The genus, according to Hemsley, is chiefly at\r\nhome in New Zealand, but is also found in Fuegia and in South-east\r\nAustralia. It is represented in Hawaii, Tahiti, Samoa, and Fiji. In\r\nHawaii there are two peculiar species ranging between 2,000 to 6,000\r\nfeet in elevation. The solitary Tahitian species, A. nadeaudi, is found\r\nin the central mountains of Tahiti, reaching to the crests of Mount\r\nAorai, which attains a height of 6,700 feet. Fiji and Samoa possess a\r\nspecies in common, A. montana, which is only recorded by Seemann, from\r\nthe summit of Kandavu, 2,750 feet above the sea; whilst in Samoa it\r\nfrequents, according to Reinecke, moist coast districts. The fruits of\r\nAstelia are berries with crustaceous seeds that would be dispersed by\r\nfrugivorous birds.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Tahitian mountain-genera that possess species ranging far\r\nbeyond this region as well as species confined to the group may be\r\nmentioned Coriaria and Cyathodes. It is to their non-endemic species\r\nthat we look for further clues as to the general lines of migration by\r\nwhich the mountain-genera that only possess peculiar species reached\r\nthis group. The evidence afforded by Coriaria is of some importance. The\r\ngenus has not been recorded from Hawaii, and, so far as the collections\r\nof Seemann and Home show, not from Fiji. It is found in the\r\nMediterranean region, the Himalayas, Japan, New Zealand, and Antarctic\r\nAmerica, including Chile; and there are two particular species, C.\r\nruscifolia and C. thymifolia, that occur in both cases in New Zealand\r\nand the adjacent islands and in South America (Introd. _Chall. Bot._ p.\r\n53). The first of these, which is very common in Chile, exists also in\r\nTahiti on the crest of Aorai, 6,700 feet above the sea. Drake del\r\nCastillo also describes a peculiar Tahitian species, C. vescoi, of which\r\nthe altitude is not given. Here one is in doubt whether Tahiti derived\r\nits wide-ranging species from New Zealand or from Chile; but in the New\r\nZealand home of Coprosma, another Tahitian mountain-genus, we are\r\nafforded the clue. The fruits of Coriaria possess fleshy cocci that\r\nattract birds, though it would seem that the seeds of plants of this\r\ngenus are poisonous for man. Among the numerous fruits that form the\r\ndiet of the New Zealand fruit-pigeon (Carpophaga novæ zealandiæ) are\r\nincluded, as we learn from Sir W. Buller in his _Birds of New Zealand_,\r\nthose of the “tupakihi” or “tutu” shrub, which Kirk identifies with C.\r\nruscifolia, the species that also occurs on the summit of Tahiti.\r\n\r\nThe Australian and New Zealand genus Cyathodes (Epacridaceæ) has been\r\nalready noticed in the case of Hawaii (page 282). The two Tahitian\r\nspecies occur on the elevated mountain-ridges forming the summits of\r\nTahiti, one of them, C. tameiameiæ, occurring also in Hawaii, and the\r\nother, C. pomaræ, being restricted to the group. I have shown that the\r\nfruits are dispersed by frugivorous birds, and I can only include the\r\ngenus as another example of the representation of the New Zealand flora\r\nin Tahiti.... There remain of these so-called Tahitian mountain-genera\r\nthe Antarctic Nertera and the north-temperate Luzula, each represented\r\nby a solitary widely ranging species, N. depressa and L. campestris,\r\nwhich I have fully discussed under Hawaii (Chapter XXIII), in which\r\ngroup they also occur.\r\n\r\nWhen we look at the evidence of origin supplied by the four Tahitian\r\nmountain-genera possessing species that are found outside the group,\r\nnamely Coriaria, Cyathodes, Nertera, and Luzula, we find that the first\r\nthree hail from high southern latitudes, and more especially from New\r\nZealand; and when with this clue in our hands we take up the four genera\r\nWeinmannia, Coprosma, Vaccinium, and Astelia, possessing only species\r\nrestricted to the Tahitian region, we find that all but the third-named\r\ngenus hail also from the south. It would thus appear that the element of\r\nthe Antarctic flora is much more evident in the Tahitian mountain-genera\r\nthan with those of Hawaii. In the Hawaiian mountain-flora, excluding, of\r\ncourse, the endemic genera, it includes about a fourth of the\r\nmountain-genera, which number about thirty-eight or forty in all; whilst\r\nin the Tahitian mountain-flora it comprises six out of the eight genera.\r\nIt may, indeed, be said that the resemblance between the mountain-genera\r\nof Hawaii and Tahiti is mainly restricted to genera that are found in\r\nhigh southern latitudes, namely, Nertera, Coprosma, Cyathodes, and\r\nAstelia, the only other genera linking the mountain-floras of both\r\ngroups together being Vaccinium and Luzula, which probably hail from\r\nhigh northern latitudes. The agency of the frugivorous bird is plainly\r\nmarked in the case of five out of the six genera that connect the\r\ncloud-capped peaks of Tahiti and Hawaii. In two of these genera,\r\nCyathodes and Nertera, the same species occurs in both archipelagoes.\r\n\r\n_The Mountain-flora of Rarotonga._—A word may here be said on the\r\nrepresentation of these mountain-genera in Rarotonga, a small island\r\n2,250 feet in height and about eight miles in length, which is, however,\r\nthe most important island of the Cook group. The recent important\r\nexplorations of Mr. Cheeseman show that its flora is essentially\r\nTahitian in character. As in Tahiti, the early age of the Compositæ and\r\nLobeliaceæ is well represented in the high levels by peculiar species of\r\nFitchia and Sclerotheca which are discussed in Chapters XXI and XXII. On\r\naccount, however, of its relatively low altitude and its small size, we\r\ncould not expect any extensive representation of the eight non-endemic\r\nmountain-genera of Tahiti. Yet three of these occur, a Tahitian species\r\nof Vaccinium (page 281) growing on its summits, whilst peculiar species\r\nof Weinmannia (page 290) and Coprosma (page 295) are found in its\r\ninterior. The prevailing condition of many of the genera growing in the\r\nhigher levels is one of isolation, since other genera, like Pittosporum\r\nand Elæocarpus, only possess peculiar species; but seeing that in\r\nseveral cases the species are closely allied to others found in the\r\nWestern Pacific, as in Samoa, Fiji, and the Kermadec group, it is\r\napparent that the period of isolation has not long commenced.\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE MOUNTAIN-FLORA OF THE FIJIAN REGION.\r\n\r\n Weinmannia, Saxifragaceæ, Fiji and Samoa. } Derived from\r\n Lagenophora, Compositæ, Fiji.             } New Zealand or\r\n Coprosma, Rubiaceæ, Fiji.                 } from the\r\n Astelia, Liliaceæ, Fiji and Samoa.        } Antarctic flora.\r\n\r\n Vaccinium, Vacciniaceæ, Samoa, from the northern hemisphere.\r\n Nertera depressa, Rubiaceæ, Samoa, from the Antarctic flora.\r\n\r\n Dammara, Coniferæ, Fiji.              }Not as a rule belonging\r\n Podocarpus, Coniferæ, Fiji and Tonga. }to the present age\r\n Dacrydium, Coniferæ, Fiji.            }of dispersal\r\n\r\nBut little can be said of the mountain-flora of Fiji, since on account\r\nof the relatively low elevation of the islands there are but few special\r\nmountain-genera; and as a rule we find only here and there a solitary\r\nspecies on some isolated peak that recalls the upland flora of the\r\nHawaiian mountains. “None of the mountains of Fiji,” remarks Horne (page\r\n60), “are high enough for an alpine flora to exist. Many of the plants\r\nfound on the tops of the mountains are also found near the level of the\r\nsea. On the other hand sea-level plants may also be found on the tops of\r\nthe hills.”\r\n\r\nFiji lacks the endemic genera of Compositæ and of Lobeliaceæ that often\r\ngive a character to the mountain-floras of the Hawaiian and Tahitian\r\nregions, though, as remarked in Chapters XXI and XXII., their absence\r\ninvolves something more than a question of station. We find, however,\r\nfour genera of the Antarctic or New Zealand flora, Weinmannia,\r\nLagenophora, Coprosma, and Astelia. The first-named genus possesses four\r\nor five species ranging up to 2,000 feet, some of which are endemic, and\r\nit has been already discussed in this chapter. The United States\r\nExploring Expedition found a single species of Lagenophora (L.\r\npickeringii) on the mountains of the Mathuata coast of Vanua Levu, and\r\nno other species seems to have since been found. The subject is dealt\r\nwith in Chapter XXIII in the case of Hawaii, but it may be here observed\r\nthat there is an Hawaiian mountain species, and that the route followed\r\nby the ancestor of the Fijian species from the New Zealand home of the\r\ngenus is indicated by a species in the intermediate Kermadec group. The\r\ngenus Astelia has been discussed on page 291. It is represented in\r\nHawaii and in most of the oceanic groups of elevated islands. The\r\nsolitary species, A. montana, discovered by Seemann on the summit of\r\nKandavu in Fiji, has since been found in Samoa, and probably Mr. Horne’s\r\ncollections contain another species.\r\n\r\nThe Rubiaceous genus Coprosma needs a few special remarks, since a\r\nparticular genus of birds seems to have been concerned in dispersing it\r\nin the South Pacific. About fifty species are enumerated in the _Index\r\nKewensis_, and if we include a few other species from the collections of\r\nHillebrand, Horne, Cheeseman, &c., the total would be about sixty. Of\r\nthese, about half are restricted to New Zealand, which may be justly\r\nregarded as the home of the genus, the rest being confined to Australia\r\nand the islands of the Pacific, excepting a Chilian and three or four\r\nMalayan species. Hawaii with its nine species, Tahiti with two,\r\nRarotonga with one, and Fiji with two or three species represent\r\napproximately the distribution of the genus in the oceanic archipelagoes\r\nof the tropical Pacific. (It most probably exists on the high peaks of\r\nSamoa, though it has not yet been recorded from the group.) In all, or\r\nin almost all cases, the species are restricted to their particular\r\ngroups, so that we may regard the dispersal of the genus over the\r\nPacific as suspended, though, as will be observed below, the period of\r\nsuspension in the South Pacific has not been of sufficient duration to\r\nobliterate the affinities of species in distant groups and to prevent us\r\nfrom tracing out the route followed by the genus.\r\n\r\nThis genus of temperate latitudes, which in its New Zealand home ranges\r\nfrom near the sea-level to the region of the alpine floras, finds its\r\nusual station in the tropics on the summits of mountains. Thus, on Mount\r\nKinabalu, in Borneo, it is found at altitudes of 10,500 to 13,000 feet\r\n(Stapf), and on the mountains of East Java at elevations exceeding 9,000\r\nfeet (Schimper). In Hawaii its species grow at elevations ranging from\r\n3,000 to 9,000 feet, and in Tahiti at altitudes of 2,600 to 3,300 feet;\r\nwhilst in Rarotonga it grows in the hilly parts of the island, its\r\nelevation in Fiji not being recorded.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to consider the route by which the genus (Coprosma) entered\r\nthe tropical Pacific, we must remember that unless we establish some\r\nspecial connection with its New Zealand home it will always be open for\r\nany one to suggest that the genus might have been derived, like\r\nVaccinium, from other regions than the south, as from the summits of the\r\nMalayan mountains. However, a curious connection has been discovered by\r\nMr. Cheeseman in his examination of the Kermadec and Rarotongan floras,\r\nand it would indeed appear that he has traced the Rarotongan peculiar\r\nspecies to its New Zealand home. Thus, he says that Coprosma lævigata,\r\nhis new Rarotongan species, is very closely allied to the Kermadec\r\nendemic plant, C. acutifolia, Hook., which itself comes near C. lucida,\r\nForst., a New Zealand species. The connection between Rarotonga and New\r\nZealand by way of the Kermadec group is rendered yet more probable by\r\nthe occurrence of two New Zealand species of Coprosma in the Kermadec\r\nflora (_Journ. Linn. Soc._ i. 1857; _Trans. Linn. Soc. Bot._ vi. 1903;\r\n_Trans. N.Z. Instit._ xx. 1887).\r\n\r\nWhen speaking of the genus in Hawaii (page 275), mention was made of the\r\ninter-island dispersal of the fruits of one of the species by the native\r\nmountain-goose, Bernicla sandwicensis. We learn from Sir W. Buller’s\r\n_History of the Birds of New Zealand_ that when the Coprosma is in fruit\r\nthe Swamp-Hens (Porphyrio melanotus) come out to feed on it. These\r\nbirds, he says, are capable of prolonged flight; and I chance to have\r\nbeside me a cutting from the _Field_ of July 9, 1904, in which “Hy. S.”\r\nrefers to a Black-backed Porphyrio that was captured in 1876 four\r\nhundred miles off the coast of New Zealand. This genus, which is widely\r\ndispersed in the tropics, the birds being commonly known as Sultanas,\r\nBlue Gallinules, Purple Water-Hens, &c., has probably been a very\r\nimportant factor in the dispersal of plants, especially in connection\r\nwith insular floras. The birds live on a variety of food. The Messrs.\r\nLayard observed that Porphyrio vitiensis, which abounds in the swamps of\r\nNew Caledonia, fed on maize, yams, &c. (_Ibis_, 1882); whilst in the\r\nstomach of a bird of the same genus shot in the Rewa swamps in Fiji I\r\nfound a number of the stony fruits of Scleria, a genus of the Cyperaceæ.\r\nAccording to Mr. Wiglesworth, each region in the South Pacific has its\r\nown species of Porphyrio. There is one in the Tahitian Islands, and\r\nanother common to Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa; whilst New Caledonia and the\r\nNew Hebrides have their species (“Aves Polynesiæ”). However, it is\r\nevident that the power of dispersing seeds from group to group is not\r\nquite suspended, since, as we learn from Sir W. Buller, the New Zealand\r\nspecies, above named as partial to Coprosma drupes, is distributed over\r\nTasmania and Australia, and reaches also Niue and New Caledonia; whilst\r\nthe Messrs. Layard evidently regarded one species as common to Fiji and\r\nNew Caledonia.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless to birds of this description that we owe some of the\r\nspecific connections of Coprosma between groups of the Western Pacific.\r\nThat the dispersal of the species over distant regions was recently in\r\nactive operation is shown by the close affinity, according to Dr. Stapf,\r\nof two species growing on the summit of Kinabalu, the Bornean mountain,\r\nwith certain species from New Zealand and South-east Australia. Other\r\nRubiaceous species, like Nertera depressa, possessing Coprosma-like\r\nfruits and fitted for the same mode of dispersal, link the heights of\r\nKinabalu with the flora of high southern latitudes.\r\n\r\nBeing included in the Fijian area, the scanty mountain-flora of Samoa\r\nmay be here referred to. As in Fiji, the endemic genera of Compositæ and\r\nLobeliaceæ are not to be found, but we find in the central elevated\r\ndistrict of Savaii, which rises to over 5,000 feet above the sea, a\r\npeculiar species of Vaccinium (4,900 feet), the Antarctic Nertera\r\ndepressa (4,000 feet), and two species of Weinmannia, a genus hailing\r\nprobably from high southern latitudes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE FIJIAN CONIFERÆ.\r\n\r\nIt has been found most convenient to discuss here these interesting\r\nplants, which belong in a general sense to the mountain-flora of this\r\narchipelago. That which the Fijian flora loses in interest in the eyes\r\nof the student of plant-dispersal in not possessing the mysterious\r\nComposite and Lobeliaceous genera of Hawaii and Tahiti, it regains in\r\nthe possession of its genera of Coniferæ. If he felt loth to apply his\r\nempirical principles to the above-named Hawaiian and Tahitian endemic\r\ngenera, he feels more than uneasy when he comes to deal with the three\r\nConiferous genera of Fiji, Dammara (Agathis), Podocarpus, and Dacrydium.\r\n\r\nThese three genera represent an order that has not found a home either\r\nin Tahiti or in East Polynesia generally, or in the more distant Hawaii;\r\nand they present at first sight in their existence in Fiji a powerful\r\nargument in favour of the previous continental condition of the islands\r\nof the Western Pacific. But in advocating this view we should remember\r\nthat it involves the original continuity of the Fijian land-area, not\r\nonly with the neighbouring islands of the New Hebrides and of New\r\nCaledonia where these genera alike occur, but also with New Zealand,\r\nTasmania, and Australia, where they sometimes attain a great\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nIn Fiji these trees often chiefly form the forests of the larger\r\nislands, extending in the moister regions from near the sea to the\r\nmountain-tops, and being often abundant on the great mountain-ridges of\r\nthe interior. It may be at once remarked that, viewed merely from the\r\nstandpoint of dispersal, there is no great difficulty in regarding it as\r\nprobable that the seeds of Podocarpus and Dacrydium have been dispersed\r\nby frugivorous birds over tracts of ocean 500 or 600 miles across.\r\nDammara, however, so far as my Fijian observations show, possesses none\r\nof the means of dispersal across oceans that we are at present\r\nacquainted with. The two first-named genera occur in South America as\r\nwell as in the Australo-Polynesian region, some of the species in these\r\ntwo regions, though the Pacific Ocean divides them, being closely\r\nrelated. Dammara is, on the other hand, confined to a much more limited\r\narea, extending from New Zealand to Borneo. It is from the distribution\r\nof this genus that the continental theory derives its chief support.\r\n\r\nYet it may be remarked that something more than questions relating to\r\nthe capacity for dispersal are involved here. This is at once indicated\r\nby the circumstance that although Podocarpus is known to be dispersed by\r\nfrugivorous birds, it is not found in Polynesia east of Tonga, and the\r\nsame may be said of Dacrydium, which does not occur east of Fiji. In\r\nthis connection it is necessary to notice the intrusion of Araucaria\r\ninto the tropical Pacific from Eastern Australia to New Caledonia and\r\nthe New Hebrides. The fact of this genus not having been recorded from\r\nFiji or any of the groups east of the New Hebrides is very remarkable,\r\nand scarcely in accordance with the continental hypothesis. There is a\r\npersistence in type of these genera of the Coniferæ during geological\r\ntime that prevents us from dealing with them on the lines that are\r\nrequired by the mass of the flowering-plants. Other factors intervene,\r\nand we apply with hesitation the same canons of dispersal that we employ\r\nfor the general bulk of the plants of the Pacific islands. If, as often\r\nhappens, a specific distinction alone separates the Conifers of the same\r\ngenus on either side of the Pacific Ocean, it must possess in point of\r\ntime a very different value from that which we would usually attach to\r\nspecific distinctions in the floras of the Pacific islands.\r\n\r\nDAMMARA (AGATHIS).—The Dammara region includes Eastern Australia, New\r\nZealand, New Caledonia, with the New Hebrides, Fijian, and Santa Cruz\r\ngroups, and extends north-west to Java and Borneo. Only ten species are\r\nnamed in the _Index Kewensis_, and of these four are assigned to New\r\nCaledonia and two to Fiji, the focus of geographical distribution being,\r\ntherefore, as Seemann long since pointed out, in the islands of the\r\nWestern Pacific. The absence of the genus from the neighbouring Samoan\r\nand Tongan groups is very significant; and it is evident that the\r\nordinary agencies of dispersal, whether birds, winds, or currents, have\r\nhere failed to extend the genus over a few hundred miles of sea.\r\n\r\nWhen by means of observation and experiment we turn to the fruits and\r\nlook for a reply, we find in the first place that they are never to be\r\nnoticed either whole or in part in the floating drift of sea or river,\r\nor amongst the stranded materials of the beaches. This is at once\r\nexplained when we ascertain that the fresh cones sink in the\r\nriver-water, and thus could never reach the coast in their entire\r\ncondition. Nor could they do so in fragments, since the detached cone\r\nfalls to pieces on the ground and the separate scales and seeds sink at\r\nonce or float only for a few hours. In order to test the buoyancy of a\r\ncone after drying, it is necessary to bind it round with string to keep\r\nit from breaking down. One such fruit, after being kept for ten days,\r\nwas placed in sea-water, where it floated heavily for eleven days and\r\nthen sank. This is, of course, a most unnatural experiment, but it was\r\nwell to have carried it out. That the entire fruit could never be\r\ntransported by water is indirectly implied by Kirk respecting the fruit\r\nof Dammara australis, the Kauri Pine of New Zealand. In this case, when\r\nthe fruit reaches maturity the scales, he remarks, fall away from the\r\nwoody axis of the cone and the seeds are freed.\r\n\r\nThe fleshy, unprotected seeds, which, as above noted, possess little or\r\nno floating power, could scarcely withstand the injurious effect of\r\nsea-water; and they are absolutely unfitted for any known mode of\r\ndispersal by birds. It is observed by Kirk that the seeds of the New\r\nZealand tree are widely spread by winds. But this could only avail them\r\nfor local dispersion, and they appear ill-suited for being transported\r\nfor more than a few paces. The seeds are winged, and are in form a\r\nlittle like the samara of the Maple (Acer); but they have not the same\r\nprotective coverings, the wing being, however, only a little more than\r\nhalf the length of the entire seed. Those of both Dammara australis and\r\nD. vitiensis are about two-thirds of an inch in length, and are\r\nheavy-looking; and the agency of the wind could never be invoked except\r\nfor local dispersion.\r\n\r\nLooking at these results, the cones of Dammara may be regarded as most\r\nunsuited for any of the ordinary means of dispersal over an ocean except\r\nthrough the agency of man. There is, however, no necessity to introduce\r\nman’s aid here, unless the gum or resin which the Fijian burns in his\r\ntorches and employs as a glaze for his pottery gave his ancestors an\r\nobject in carrying the cones with them in their migrations. But in that\r\ncase the same argument would have to be applied to all partially useful\r\nplants, and much of the Fijian flora would lose its indigenous\r\nreputation. The endemic character of the Fijian species also militates\r\nagainst such a view, and we should have to apply the same explanation to\r\nthe New Zealand species, concerning which no one, so far as I know, has\r\never ventured to suggest that it was introduced by the Maoris.\r\n\r\nThe native names of the trees seem to have been sometimes connected with\r\ngeneral words for gums or resins; whilst at other times the tree and the\r\nresin have separate designations. Thus the Fijians call the tree\r\n“ndakua” and the resin “makandre,” which last Hazlewood in his\r\ndictionary seemingly connects with “ndrenga,” the word for “gum.” In my\r\nwork on the Solomon Islands, page 190, I have endeavoured to show that\r\nthe Maori name of “kauri” may be connected with “gatah,” the general\r\nMalayan word for gums and resins, transitional stages being presented in\r\nthe names of resin-yielding trees in the intermediate regions, as, for\r\ninstance, by “gutur,” a species of Canarium, on the Maclay coast of New\r\nGuinea, and by “katari,” a species of Calophyllum, in Bougainville\r\nStraits, Solomon group. It may be pointed out that these facts of\r\nplant-nomenclature do not promise us any aid in determining the mode of\r\ndispersion of Dammara in the Western Pacific. There is a suspicious\r\nresemblance between the Fijian name of “ndakua” and “dundathu,” the\r\nQueensland aboriginal name for Dammara robusta; but even if the\r\ncomparison is legitimate, its explanation may lie far back in the ages\r\nin some root-word as ancient as the Malayan “gatah.”\r\n\r\nIf there is a real difficulty in applying our canons of\r\nplant-dispersal to the distribution of Dammara, it is merely the same\r\ndifficulty that has so often perplexed the botanist with other\r\nConiferous genera in continental regions, such as, for instance, the\r\noccurrence of Pinus excelsa on the far-removed mountains of Europe and\r\nof the Himalayas, and the existence of the cedar in its isolated homes\r\non the Atlas, the Lebanon mountains, and the Himalayas. Such\r\ndifficulties largely disappear if we regard the present distribution\r\nof the Coniferæ as the remnant of what it was in an ancient geological\r\nperiod. In the case of Dammara it seems almost as idle to puzzle over\r\nits means of dispersal as to consider the mode of dispersal of the\r\nMarsupials. The questions, indeed, that affect the Dammaras of Fiji\r\nand the Western Pacific far ante-date any questions concerning a\r\nprevious continental condition of those regions. The attitude of the\r\npalæobotanist to such questions would probably be one of indifference;\r\nyet to the student of plant-distribution they are of prime importance;\r\nand _nolens volens_ we must admit that Dammara may well be cited in\r\nsupport of any continental hypothesis affecting the Western Pacific.\r\n\r\nPODOCARPUS.—In this connection I will mainly depend on Pilger’s recent\r\nmonograph on the Taxaceæ (heft 18, Engler’s _Das Pflanzenreich_, 1903).\r\nMore than sixty species are here enumerated, which are distributed in\r\nAfrica, Asia, Australasia, and South America. With a range that extends\r\nnorth to Japan and south to Southern Chile in latitude 48°, this genus\r\nattains its greatest development in respect of species in Malaya, in the\r\nregion comprised by Australia, New Zealand, and New Caledonia, in South\r\nAmerica, and in Africa. Eastward of New Caledonia it is found in Fiji\r\nand in Tonga, but not in Samoa, and it is altogether absent from the\r\nTahitian region as well as from Hawaii. Of the four species accredited\r\nby Seemann to Fiji, two are enumerated by Pilger, namely, P. affinis and\r\nP. vitiensis. The first-named, according to Stapf, is allied to P.\r\nbracteata, which occurs on the upper slopes of Kinabalu, in Borneo, and\r\nis distributed not only over Malaya, but occurs in Japan and in the\r\nHimalayas. The Tongan species, P. elatus, is, according to Hemsley,\r\nfound in East Australia.\r\n\r\nThis Tongan tree is suggestive of bird-agency in the dispersal of the\r\ngenus, and the same may be said of the occurrence of another species, P.\r\nferrugineus, found in both New Caledonia and New Zealand. Since the\r\nseeds of the genus possess an outer fleshy and an inner bony covering,\r\nthey would appear to be well fitted both to attract and to be dispersed\r\nby birds. In fact, we learn from Sir W. Buller that the New Zealand\r\nfruit-pigeon feeds on the seeds of the “matai” tree (Podocarpus spicata)\r\nand of the “kahikatea” (P. dacrydioides), and no doubt to the agency of\r\nfrugivorous birds we can attribute the presence of the genus in Fiji and\r\nTonga. Yet it is strange that bird-agency should have failed both with\r\nTahiti and Hawaii. In point of size the seeds, which range from\r\none-quarter to an inch across, present no great difficulty, and one\r\nwould have thought that the birds that carried the “stones” of\r\nElæocarpus to Hawaii could have also carried the seeds of Podocarpus.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, necessary to remember, in dealing with a genus that has\r\na wide distribution both in time and space, that specific affinities may\r\nhave a very different significance with the Gymnosperms than with most\r\nother flowering plants. When Hemsley remarks (_Introd. Chall. Bot._ p.\r\n56) that the New Zealand Podocarpus spicata is closely allied to the\r\nSouth American P. andina, he does not imply that the two regions are in\r\ntouch with each other though some 5,000 to 6,000 miles of ocean\r\nintervene. One is prepared to credit these seeds with a capacity of\r\ndispersal by birds over tracts of sea such as the extent of ocean\r\nseparating New Caledonia and New Zealand, which are some 900 miles\r\napart; but one hesitates to admit that frugivorous birds could carry\r\nthem across the Southern Ocean. If we assign a home in the high\r\nlatitudes of the northern hemisphere to a genus that was well\r\nrepresented in Europe in the Tertiary period, a movement of migration\r\nsouthward would explain most of the difficulties in its present\r\ndistribution. The great vertical range of some of the species leads us\r\nto attribute a corresponding power of adaptation to the genus in respect\r\nof widely different climates. Thus, according to Stapf, the vertical\r\nrange of P. bracteata in the Malay Archipelago extends, including\r\nvarieties, from the coast to an altitude of 12,000 feet. With such a\r\ncapacity for adaptation, migrations of the genus would be rendered easy\r\nover the globe.\r\n\r\nDACRYDIUM.—It may happen that some additional light on the mystery of\r\nthe Fijian Coniferæ may be afforded by Dacrydium elatum, a tree that\r\noccurs not only in Fiji, but in Further India and in Malaya. Pilger\r\nconfirms Seemann’s view in his identification of the Fijian tree, and\r\nthis opinion is, in the main, shared by Stapf. This species, so to\r\nspeak, affords us a _point d’appui_ in the history of the distribution\r\nof the genus in the Western Pacific. This distribution somewhat\r\nresembles that of Dammara in extending from New Zealand (its principal\r\ncentre) to Malaya and Further India; but, unlike Dammara, Dacrydium is\r\nrepresented in America by a solitary species in South Chile. Of the\r\nsixteen species enumerated by Pilger, seven belong to New Zealand, four\r\nto New Caledonia, three to Malaya, one to Tasmania, and one to Chile.\r\nThe seeds are, as a rule, smaller than those of Podocarpus, and on\r\naccount of their somewhat similar structure would serve as bird-food,\r\nand might be distributed in this fashion. Yet the genus has been only\r\nrecorded from Fiji, and is not only unrepresented in Hawaii and Tahiti,\r\nbut is also not known from the Tongan and Samoan groups that belong to\r\nthe Fijian floral region of the Pacific. Capacities for dispersal appear\r\nmeaningless here, especially when we have regard to the solitary\r\nAmerican species, Dacrydium fonkii, that as a shrub finds a refuge in\r\nthe bleak region of Southern Chile.\r\n\r\nThe three Fijian genera of the Coniferæ, Dammara, Podocarpus, and\r\nDacrydium, appear at first sight to be beyond the reach of our canons of\r\nplant-dispersal, by which we connect specific affinity with a continuity\r\nof range, and by which we co-ordinate means of dispersal and area of\r\ndistribution. We begin to realise that there may have been an age of\r\nConiferæ in the Pacific islands that is even less amenable to our\r\nmethods than the later era of the Compositæ and Lobeliaceæ in Hawaii and\r\nTahiti. Such an age would be concerned only with that region in the\r\nWestern Pacific which is now held by the genera Dammara, Podocarpus, and\r\nDacrydium, a region that did not participate in the era of the Compositæ\r\nand Lobeliaceæ. We thus have evidence of an ancient era of the Coniferæ\r\nthat was confined to the Western Pacific, and of a later era indicated\r\nby the peculiar genera of Compositæ and Lobeliaceæ that was restricted\r\nto Hawaii and to Eastern Polynesia (Tahiti, Rarotonga, &c.). The key to\r\nthe situation here presented seems to lie in the following\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nIt is assumed that there was an age of Coniferæ in the Pacific, or\r\nrather that this region shared in an era of dispersion of existing\r\ngenera of the order. In this age only the islands of the Western Pacific\r\nparticipated, neither the Hawaiian nor the Tahitian islands taking a\r\npart in it. Such a result is to be attributed either to the inability of\r\nthese genera of Conifers to reach Hawaii and the islands of East\r\nPolynesia, or to the non-existence of the Hawaiian and Tahitian\r\narchipelagoes at that epoch. The first explanation seems scarcely\r\nacceptable, since, although the powers of dispersal of the genus Dammara\r\nare very limited, there seems no reason why the genera Podocarpus and\r\nDacrydium could not have reached those distant regions of the Pacific.\r\nThe second explanation is most probable, and it is the one suggested by\r\nHillebrand (p. xxx) in the case of Hawaii, namely, that “the absence of\r\nGymnosperms militates for the view that the islands were formed\r\nsubsequent to the age in which these were universally distributed.”\r\n\r\nIf this conclusion is legitimate we have here a datum-mark in the\r\nhistory of the islands of this ocean. Before the appearance of the\r\nHawaiian and Tahitian islands (using the term Tahitian to cover the East\r\nPolynesian region) there existed a land-area in the Western Pacific held\r\nby the Coniferæ, probably in the late Secondary period. After the\r\nformation of the Hawaiian and Tahitian islands, perhaps in the early\r\nTertiary epoch, came the age characterised by the ancestors of the\r\npresent endemic genera of the Compositæ and Lobeliaceæ, and of a few\r\nother orders in Hawaii and Tahiti. In this age the islands of the\r\nWestern Pacific do not seem to have participated, and it is to be\r\ninferred that this was an age of extensive but probably not of complete\r\nsubmergence in that part of the ocean, since at least the genus Dammara\r\nwas able in places to hold its ground. Then ensued the great Tertiary\r\nemergence of the land-areas of the Western Pacific, when small islands\r\nthat dotted the sea-surface in this region became the nuclei for the\r\nformation of the large islands of the present Fijian, New Hebrides, and\r\nSolomon groups. This prepared the way for the migration of Malayan\r\nplants which now predominate over the islands of the tropical Pacific;\r\nand in a later age man, following the same track from Indo-Malaya,\r\noccupied these islands.\r\n\r\nIn my volume on the geology of Vanua Levu it was shown that the Tertiary\r\nperiod was an age of submergence in the Western Pacific, and a disbelief\r\nin any previous continental condition was expressed. My later view is\r\nmore in accordance with that of Wichmann, who, on geological grounds,\r\ncontended that the islands of the Western Pacific were in a continental\r\ncondition during the Palæozoic and Mesozoic periods, and that their\r\nsubmergence and subsequent emergence took place in Tertiary times. The\r\ndistribution of the genus Dammara has thus led me to modify the views\r\nexpressed in the final chapter of my first volume on the geology of\r\nVanua Levu. Though still holding that there is no geological evidence\r\nthat the various islands of the Fijian group were ever amalgamated, or\r\nthat they were joined as such to the westward groups, it is quite\r\npossible that their position was indicated by a few small islands a few\r\nmiles across and a few hundred feet in height in early Tertiary times.\r\nOn these small islands, which probably represented the remains of a\r\nsubmerged Mesozoic land-area, such as is in part implied in Dr. Forbes’\r\n_Antipodea_, or in Mr. Hedley’s _Melanesian Plateau_, the genus Dammara\r\nsurvived. Such islands merely indicated the situation of some of the\r\npresent groups of the Western Pacific, which have been since largely\r\nbuilt up by submarine eruptions, and the greater number of the islands\r\nwere no doubt completely submerged. Between the groups as we know them\r\nnow there never was any land connection, since they are the product of\r\nlater eruptions, mainly submarine; and they have acquired their present\r\ncomposite character during the emergence that followed the period of\r\nvolcanic activity. Except, perhaps, in New Caledonia, which does not\r\nseem to have shared in the Tertiary submergence, the islands of the\r\nWestern Pacific have a configuration acquired in comparatively recent\r\ntimes, and one that gives no idea of the character of the Mesozoic\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nSuch, as I understand them, are the indications of the Fijian Coniferæ\r\nand particularly of Dammara. In the distribution of this genus we have\r\noutlined an ancient, more or less continuous land area which, with the\r\nexception of a few isolated points, disappeared beneath the sea in\r\nTertiary times to re-appear near the close of that period in the form of\r\na number of archipelagoes that were largely built up by submarine\r\neruptions, and probably altogether mask the form of the original\r\nland-area. It may be remarked that New Zealand, which largely shared in\r\nthe Tertiary submergence, especially in the Miocene age, is included in\r\nthe range of the genus Dammara, as well as in those of the genera\r\nPodocarpus and Dacrydium.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Summary._\r\n\r\n(1) The evidences of a mountain-flora in Tahiti, as indicated by the\r\nnon-endemic genera, though, as we would expect, of a scanty nature when\r\ncontrasted with Hawaii, are nevertheless of considerable interest. There\r\nis much kinship with the Hawaiian mountain-flora, but it is mainly\r\nconfined to genera from high southern latitudes, such as Nertera,\r\nCoprosma, Cyathodes, and Astelia, which are all dispersed by frugivorous\r\nbirds. Amongst other plants linking the Tahitian mountains with the\r\nregion of the Antarctic flora, and with New Zealand in particular, may\r\nbe mentioned Coriaria ruscifolia and the genus Weinmannia.\r\n\r\n(2) On account of their relatively low altitude the Fijian islands do\r\nnot present the conditions for an alpine flora. Traces, however, of the\r\nAntarctic flora, or of the New Zealand flora, occur on occasional\r\nmountain-tops, as is indicated by the occurrence of species of\r\nLagenophora, Coprosma, and Astelia. In Samoa the mountain-flora is also\r\nscantily developed, as we might have expected; but here occurs the genus\r\nVaccinium as well as a widely-ranging species of the Antarctic flora,\r\nNertera depressa.\r\n\r\n(3) The route by which some of the representatives of the flora of high\r\nsouthern latitudes reached the mountains of the islands of the tropical\r\nPacific is directly indicated by the genus Coprosma to have been from\r\nNew Zealand by way of the Kermadec Islands.\r\n\r\n(4) In the distribution of plants possessing drupes or berries that\r\nconnect the tropical islands of the South Pacific with New Zealand, it\r\nis highly probable that birds of the genus Porphyrio (Swamp-Hens or\r\nPurple Water-Hens) have taken a prominent part.\r\n\r\n(5) In the possession of species of the three genera of Coniferæ,\r\nDammara, Podocarpus, and Dacrydium, which often largely form the forests\r\nof the mountain-slopes, Fiji is distinguished from all the other groups\r\nof the open Pacific with the exception of Tonga, which owns a species of\r\nPodocarpus probably introduced by birds. From the circumstance that\r\nDammara has no known means of crossing a tract of ocean, whilst\r\nPodocarpus and Dacrydium could be dispersed by frugivorous birds, all\r\nthree genera having, however, much the same limited distribution in the\r\nWestern Pacific, it is apparent that something more than a question of\r\nmeans of dispersal is here involved. It is assumed that they mark the\r\nsite of a Mesozoic continental area in this region, and that at this\r\nperiod the Tahitian and Hawaiian groups which possess no Conifers did\r\nnot exist. This area was submerged during the Tertiary period with the\r\nexception of a few peaks that formed small islands on which the Conifers\r\nheld their ground. During the Tertiary submergence of the Western\r\nPacific region, the Hawaiian and Tahitian islands were built up by\r\nsubaërial volcanoes and received the ancestors of the Compositæ and\r\nLobeliaceæ that now exist as endemic genera in those groups. Then\r\nfollowed the emergence of the islands of the Western Pacific and their\r\noccupation mainly by Indo-Malayan plants that extended eastward over the\r\nPacific. Thus in the Pacific there has been first an age of Conifers in\r\nwhich the islands of the Hawaiian and Tahitian regions could not\r\nparticipate, since they did not exist. Then ensued an era of American\r\nforms of Compositæ and Lobeliaceæ in which only Hawaii and Tahiti\r\nparticipated, since the Western Pacific region was submerged. Lastly\r\ncame the invasion of Indo-Malayan plants, which have largely occupied\r\nevery group in the tropical Pacific.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n  THE ERA OF THE NON-ENDEMIC GENERA OF FLOWERING PLANTS (_continued_)\r\n\r\n THE AGE OF THE MALAYAN PLANTS AS REPRESENTED IN THE LOW-LEVEL FLORA OF\r\nHAWAII AND IN THE BULK OF THE FLORAS OF THE FIJIAN AND TAHITIAN REGIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n         _The Age of Wide Dispersal over the Tropical Pacific._\r\n\r\nThe widely dispersed genera which possess only peculiar species in\r\n  Hawaii.—Pittosporum.—Reynoldsia.—Gardenia.—Psychotria.—Cyrtandra—Freycinetia.—Sapindus.—Phyllanthus.—Pritchardia.—Summary.\r\n\r\nWE pass now from the consideration of the mountain-flora of Hawaii and\r\nits scanty representation in the Fijian and Tahitian regions to a\r\ndiscussion of the low-level Hawaiian flora, belonging to stations under\r\n4,000 or 5,000 feet, and of the corresponding floras of the other two\r\nregions. It has been previously pointed out that in mass the plants of\r\nFiji and Tahiti correspond to the low-level flora of Hawaii.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous ways of comparing this era of the non-endemic genera\r\nof these three regions of the Pacific. The necessities of space,\r\nhowever, compel me to treat the subject only in an illustrative fashion,\r\nand in adopting the plan which seems easiest and simplest I have also\r\nbeen obliged to keep my limitations mainly in view.\r\n\r\n\r\n   THE WIDELY-DISPERSED GENERA WHICH POSSESS ONLY PECULIAR SPECIES IN\r\n                                HAWAII.\r\n\r\nAmongst the oldest denizens of the Pacific islands in this era of the\r\nnon-endemic genera may be taken those genera of flowering plants which\r\nare found in all three regions, Hawaii, Fiji, and Tahiti, but possess in\r\nthe first group only endemic species, whilst in the other two regions\r\nthey may include species both confined to and occurring outside the\r\nrespective groups. They represent an age of wide dispersal over the\r\nPacific, an age which for Hawaii has long since passed away, since all\r\nthe genera have been disconnected from the outer world, whilst in the\r\ngroups of the South Pacific they as a rule in each case remain in touch\r\nthrough some of the species with the groups around.\r\n\r\nThe problem of plant-distribution in the Pacific thus assumes a\r\ndifferent aspect in an age which we term Malayan or Indo-Malayan, since\r\nthe bulk of the plants are thence derived. The earliest age of the\r\nConiferæ was, as we have seen in the previous chapter, restricted to the\r\nregion of the Western Pacific. The following age of the Compositæ and\r\nthe Lobeliaceæ was concerned with the regions of Tahiti and Hawaii. Now,\r\nhowever, in the Malayan era, the whole of the tropical Pacific is\r\nconcerned. Yet, although we shall still regard, for purposes of\r\nconvenience, the groups of Fiji, Tahiti, and Hawaii as the three foci of\r\nplant-distribution, it will soon become apparent that in future there\r\nwill be in reality only two regions to deal with, the Hawaiian in the\r\nNorth Pacific, and the whole region of the South Pacific extending from\r\nFiji to Tahiti and as far east as the islands stretch. It will be also\r\nseen that in making our comparison we shall sometimes have to regard\r\neach of the principal Hawaiian islands as the equivalent as a\r\nplant-centre of an entire archipelago of the South Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe genera that are here selected to represent this epoch of wide\r\ndispersion are very characteristic of the floras of the Pacific islands.\r\nGenera like Pittosporum, Gardenia, Psychotria, Cyrtandra, Freycinetia,\r\nand others one meets with everywhere in the larger islands, and it\r\nshould be observed that they are predominantly Old World, and more\r\nespecially Malayan, in their origin, not a single purely American genus,\r\nunless we except the decadent genus of fan-palms, Pritchardia, occurring\r\namong them. Here we notice [what we shall see is especially typical of\r\nthe era of the non-endemic genera, excepting those of the lofty uplands\r\nof Hawaii] that the frugivorous bird has been the principal agent in\r\ndispersing the plants, quite two-thirds of the total genera possessing\r\ndrupes or berries that would attract such birds. The transport of seeds\r\nor seedvessels in birds’ plumage, which was a conspicuous feature in the\r\ncase of the mountain-flora of Hawaii, is not a feature of this age of\r\nwide dispersal of tropical plants over the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe genera selected to represent this age are given in the following\r\ntable. Those on which my observations directly bear, or in which I was\r\nparticularly interested when in the Pacific, will be discussed in detail\r\nfrom the standpoint of dispersal; whilst only a brief reference will be\r\nmade to a few of the others, not, however, from lack of materials at my\r\ndisposal, but merely to keep this volume within moderate bounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Genera selected to represent the Age of Wide-dispersal of Indo-Malayan\r\nor Malayan Plants over the Pacific, and possessing in Hawaii only\r\nEndemic Species._—Most of the genera of this age are exclusively from\r\nthe tropics of the Old World, whilst those found on both sides of the\r\nPacific can be shown in most cases to have been derived from the same\r\nsource, and only very few, like Pritchardia, can be traced to America.\r\n\r\n Pittosporum (Pittosporeæ).\r\n Sapindus (Sapindaceæ).\r\n Reynoldsia or Trevesia (Araliaceæ)\r\n Gardenia (Rubiaceæ).\r\n Psychotria (Rubiaceæ).\r\n Cyrtandra (Gesneraceæ).\r\n Phyllanthus (Euphorbiaceæ).\r\n Pritchardia (Palmaceæ).\r\n Freycinetia (Pandanaceæ).\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PITTOSPORUM (Pittosporeæ).\r\n\r\nThis genus, which contains nearly a hundred species, usually of small\r\ntrees, is widely spread in the warmer regions of Africa, Asia,\r\nAustralia, and New Zealand. It is also especially a genus of oceanic\r\nislands, occurring not only in those of the Pacific but also in Madeira\r\nand Teneriffe in the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThough found in most of the larger Pacific groups, it has apparently\r\nnever been recorded from Samoa. From Hawaii ten species are known, all\r\npeculiar to that group. About half a dozen have been described from\r\nFiji, of which three at least have been observed outside the group in\r\nthe neighbouring Tongan Islands. Rarotonga possesses a peculiar species\r\nwhich, however, is so near to two other Fijian and Tongan species that,\r\naccording to Cheeseman’s memoir, they may have to be subsequently\r\nunited. Tahiti is credited by Drake del Castillo with a solitary species\r\nwidely distributed in the Old World, whilst in the _Index Kewensis_ a\r\npeculiar species is assigned to it. They form small trees of the wooded\r\nmountain-slopes of Fiji; whilst in Hawaii, beside occurring in the lower\r\nforests, they may extend to altitudes of between 5,000 and 7,000 feet.\r\nIn the connection that more or less exists between the species of the\r\nSouth Pacific archipelagoes, and in the endemic character of all the\r\nHawaiian species, we see the principle exemplified that there are two\r\nregions of distribution in the islands of the tropical Pacific—the\r\nHawaiian region and the South Pacific region.\r\n\r\nBefore their dehiscence, the wrinkled, woody capsules would seem very\r\nunlikely to attract birds; but the observer on handling an opening\r\nfruit, with its orange or brightly coloured lining and displaying black\r\nor dark-purple seeds immersed in a semi-liquid pulp, would form a\r\ndifferent idea of the plant’s capacity for this mode of dispersal. The\r\nmature dehiscing fruits are very conspicuous on the tree; and the seeds\r\ncovered with the “sticky” material of the pulp might possibly adhere to\r\nbirds pecking at the fruit. But this would only aid in local dispersion,\r\nsince the weight and size of the seeds, 5 to 8 millimetres (2/10 to 3/10\r\ninch), would unfit them for this mode of transport across an ocean. They\r\nare, however, sufficiently protected by their hard tests to be able to\r\npass unharmed through a bird’s intestinal canal.\r\n\r\nYet the distribution of the species of Pittosporum in the Pacific would\r\nshow that their dispersal is more a matter of the past than of the\r\npresent. Out of the ten peculiar Hawaiian species, Hillebrand designates\r\nnone as generally distributed over the group. But it is evident that,\r\nthough it is on the point of breaking off, some sort of connection still\r\nexists in the South Pacific between the Tongan and Fijian species, and\r\nuntil recently between the species of those two groups and of Rarotonga.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        REYNOLDSIA (Araliaceæ).\r\n\r\nThe Polynesian genus of Reynoldsia, originally established by Gray, is\r\nmerged by Hooker and Bentham into the Malayan genus Trevesia, a step\r\nthat brings the Pacific plants into line with many other of the plants\r\nhailing originally from the Old World. The significant fact in the\r\ndistribution of this genus of small trees in the Pacific is that its\r\ndispersal over the ocean has ceased long ago, since the three species\r\nhere occurring are restricted each to a particular group, namely, to\r\nHawaii, Tahiti, and Samoa. Yet the inter-island dispersal still\r\ncontinues in the Hawaiian Group, the species characteristic of that\r\narchipelago being found in all the islands.\r\n\r\nReynoldsia sandwicensis came frequently under my notice in Hawaii, and\r\nthe fairly fleshy drupes, about one-third of an inch, or 8 millimetres,\r\nin size, with their crustaceous pyrenes appeared to me well fitted for\r\nassisting the dispersal of the plant by frugivorous birds. Yet here the\r\nsame question arises that presents itself with so many other Hawaiian\r\nplants, and that is, How has it happened that the birds have continued\r\nto disperse the species over the scattered islands of this group long\r\nafter they ceased to transport fresh seeds from the outside world? The\r\nanswer is an obvious one. The birds that originally brought the seeds of\r\nthe parent species from some distant region came at last to remain\r\npermanently in the Hawaiian Group, and not only the plant but probably\r\nalso the bird has since undergone specific differentiation. This link\r\nbetween bird and plant in the floral history of a group of Pacific\r\nislands is the common theme of the story of most of the endemic species\r\nof plants in this region of the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          GARDENIA (Rubiaceæ).\r\n\r\nThis genus, comprising about a hundred known species, is spread over\r\ntropical Africa, Asia, and America, and over all the groups of the\r\ntropical Pacific. On account of their handsome, white, scented flowers\r\nthese shrubs are much appreciated by the Pacific islanders, who employ\r\nthe flowers for personal decoration. Some ten species have been\r\ndescribed from the groups of the open Pacific, all of which, with the\r\nexception of Gardenia tahitensis, which ranges the South Pacific from\r\nFiji to the Marquesas and Tahiti, are seemingly peculiar to the\r\ndifferent archipelagoes. Thus there are some six species endemic to\r\nFiji, one to Samoa, and two to Hawaii.\r\n\r\nThe Hawaiian Islands are, however, quite isolated in this respect, since\r\nthe group possesses only peculiar species; whilst a solitary species\r\nkeeps up the connection between the groups on the south side of the\r\nequator. The Gardenias thus tell the same story of complete isolation in\r\nHawaii, and of partial isolation in the archipelagoes of the South\r\nPacific that is repeated by many other Pacific genera. Yet in Hawaii\r\nthere has subsequently been some inter-island dispersal, since the\r\nspecies are not restricted each to a single island, but are found on two\r\nor three islands. The significance of the relation of the Hawaiian\r\nGardenias to those of the combined Fijian and Tahitian areas consists in\r\nregarding the two regions, the Hawaiian and the South Pacific, as of\r\nequivalent value, and each large Hawaiian island as equivalent to one of\r\nthe southern archipelagoes.\r\n\r\n_The Station of the Pacific Gardenias._—Although they may occur in the\r\nforests, the Gardenias of the Pacific are most characteristic of dry,\r\nthinly vegetated localities, and they have an inclination for the\r\nvicinity of the coast. In the Tahitian Group, as we learn from the\r\nwritings of Nadeaud and Drake del Castillo, Gardenia tahitensis thrives\r\nmuch better on coral islands than on volcanic soils, and, in fact,\r\nrarely quits the “_région madréporique_.” It is sometimes planted in\r\nPolynesia near the houses, and both Nadeaud in Tahiti and Cheeseman in\r\nRarotonga consider that it was probably introduced into those islands\r\nbefore the arrival of Europeans. The aborigines may have assisted in the\r\ndispersal of the genus to a small extent, but from the presence of\r\npeculiar species in Hawaii, Samoa, and Fiji it is apparent that the\r\ngenus is truly indigenous in the Pacific islands, and long antedated\r\ntheir occupation by man. This is also evident from the station of the\r\nspecies in Hawaii, Samoa, and Fiji. In Hawaii they may be found on the\r\ndry forehills in the vicinity of the sea-border. In Samoa, as Reinecke\r\ninforms us, Gardenia tahitensis is very widely spread in the\r\nmountain-forests, whilst the endemic species is found thriving in\r\ninundated coast districts. In Fiji I found the Gardenias to be\r\nespecially characteristic (as is also pointed out by Horne) of the dry\r\ndistricts on the leeward side of the larger islands. On the rolling\r\n“talasinga” or “sun-burnt” plains of the north side of Vanua Levu they\r\nthrive in numbers; and here their leaf-buds and the extremities of the\r\nyoung shoots are often tipped or covered over with an amber-like\r\ngum-resin which the natives chew.\r\n\r\n_The Mode of Dispersal of the Pacific Gardenias._—The fruits of this\r\ngenus are usually described as indehiscent. If this were true of Pacific\r\nplants it would be very difficult to explain the dispersal of hard, dry\r\nfruits an inch in size over this region. In the case of two or three\r\nFijian species, I paid especial attention to this point by examining the\r\nplants in fruit. As exhibited in Fiji the fruits are globose, hard, and\r\nalmost stony, with persistent adherent calyx, the seeds lying\r\nhorizontally in a pulp at first firm and subsequently softening as the\r\nfruit matures. The fruits are not as a rule to be observed opening on\r\nthe plant; but they are to be seen dehiscing septicidally on the ground\r\nbeneath, the detached woody valves being scattered around. If one of the\r\nfruits gathered from the plant is kept soaking in water for some time it\r\nwill begin to dehisce; and this is probably what occurs with fallen\r\nfruits in wet weather. Dr. Hillebrand regards the fruits of the Hawaiian\r\nspecies as indehiscent. I did not myself examine them, but it is not\r\nimprobable that, like those in Fiji, they dehisce whilst lying soaking\r\non the ground.\r\n\r\nJudged merely from the dispersal standpoint, the fruits of the Fijian\r\nGardenias come near to those of Pittosporum, and both can be in a sense\r\ndescribed as baccate capsules. The flat, crustaceous seeds of Gardenia,\r\nwhich are usually two or three millimetres in size, are also well fitted\r\nfor passing without injury through the digestive canal of a bird. It is\r\nlikely that the two genera have been dispersed in the Pacific by the\r\nsame kind of birds; and it should be remarked that their distribution is\r\nsomewhat similar, both belonging to the warm regions of the Old World.\r\n\r\nIt might at first appear from some experiments of mine made in Fiji that\r\nthe dried fruits of Gardenia could be dispersed over oceans by the\r\ncurrents. This receives some support by the preference for a littoral\r\nstation sometimes shown by G. tahitensis in Tahiti, and by the\r\noccurrence of G. zanguebarica in the East African strand-flora\r\n(Schimper’s _Ind. Mal. Strand-flora_, p. 131). It will, however, be\r\npointed out that currents could only have aided the dispersal of the\r\ngenus to a limited extent. The fresh fruits of Fijian species, with or\r\nwithout the adherent calyx, have little or no buoyancy, and the seeds\r\nsink even after drying for months. But it was ascertained that fruits\r\nwhich had been kept for three months floated after four or five weeks’\r\nimmersion in sea-water. On examination, however, it was found that the\r\nvalves gaped a little, being only held in apposition by the adherent\r\ncalyx, and that water had penetrated into the interior, the pulp being\r\nin a state of decay. The fruits were, in fact, kept afloat in the latter\r\npart of the experiment partly by the investing calyx and partly by gas\r\ngenerated in the decomposing pulp. Ultimately they broke down altogether\r\nand the seeds sank. In the “rough-and-tumble” of ocean-transport this\r\ncould scarcely be deemed an effective means of dispersal; and in the\r\nopen sea a fortnight would probably represent the limit of the floating\r\npower. It is to the agency that has distributed the genus Pittosporum\r\nover the Pacific that we must look for the explanation of the dispersal\r\nof Gardenia over the same ocean, namely, to birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PSYCHOTRIA (Rubiaceæ).\r\n\r\nWe find in this large genus of the Old and New Worlds a typical example\r\nof the plants with fleshy drupes containing hard pyrenes that represent,\r\nfrom the standpoint of dispersal, a common Rubiaceous type of plant in\r\nthe tropical Pacific. Such plants, of which those of Coprosma and\r\nNertera may be cited as other instances, are in a generic sense always\r\nwidely distributed in these islands. They are eminently suited for\r\ndispersal by frugivorous birds; and it is a matter for surprise,\r\ntherefore, that in a genus like Nertera the solitary Pacific species has\r\nsuch a wide range, whilst with Psychotria and Coprosma the numerous\r\nspecies are usually restricted to particular groups. Genera doubtless\r\nhave their periods of development and decadence in the Pacific, and\r\nprobably Nertera is to be regarded as a decadent genus. These Rubiaceous\r\ngenera, however, appear to be well fitted for the investigation of the\r\ncentres of dispersal of particular genera and of their relative age.\r\n\r\nThe Psychotrias in these islands are typically shrubs of the shady\r\nwoods, and they may be seen thriving best where the forest-growth is\r\nrank and the humidity greatest. Their bright red ovoid drupes, which\r\nrange from eight to twenty-five millimetres in length (1/3 to 1 inch),\r\nwould readily attract birds, and their crustaceous pyrenes, that vary\r\nbetween five and eight millimetres (1/5 to 1/3 inch) in length, would\r\npass unharmed through a bird’s digestive canal. That fruit pigeons can\r\ndistribute their seeds over the Pacific has been long established, and\r\nMr. Hemsley includes Psychotria amongst those genera which, from the\r\ncollections of fruits and seeds found in the crops of fruit-pigeons,\r\nmade by Professor Moseley, myself, and others, in the groups of the\r\nWestern Pacific, are “known to be dispersed by birds in Polynesia”\r\n(_Introd. Bot. Chall. Exped._, p. 45). It is thus hardly necessary to\r\npoint out that neither the entire fruits nor the separate pyrenes could\r\nbe transported by the currents, my observations showing that in both\r\ncases they sink at once or in a day or two.\r\n\r\nPsychotria, however, is an enormous genus including, according to the\r\n_Index Kewensis_, some 600 or 700 described species, distributed in the\r\ntropics all over the world, and also extending into subtropical regions,\r\nthe greatest concentration being in America. It is described in the\r\n_Genera Plantarum_ as a polymorphous genus distinguished by no certain\r\ncharacters from some other genera of the tribe of the Rubiaceæ to which\r\nit has given its name. We have here a genus that has overrun the\r\ntropical regions of the world, probably originating in America; and we\r\nmay contrast it with the relatively small Rubiaceous genus of Coprosma\r\n(with its three score of species, and quite comparable with it from the\r\nstandpoint of capacity for dispersal), that, having its birthplace in\r\nNew Zealand, is only beginning to reach the mainlands of the New and the\r\nOld World.\r\n\r\nOne is a genus of the tropics and the other is a genus of south\r\ntemperate latitudes; and both have occupied the Pacific islands; but\r\nCoprosma naturally finds its most appropriate station on the cool\r\nuplands of Hawaii and Tahiti. We may ask, indeed, whether the great\r\ncontrast in the fecundity of the two genera, dispersed as they are in\r\nthe same fashion by the agency of frugivorous birds, is to be connected\r\nwith questions of relative antiquity or with geographical position. It\r\nwould certainly have been a more difficult task in the past, other\r\nthings being similar, for a New Zealand genus to stock the temperate\r\nregions with its species than for a tropical American genus to overrun\r\nthe warmer regions of the globe. However that may be, the age of\r\ndispersal of both genera is largely over now.\r\n\r\nA vast genus like Psychotria, that is not sharply defined from other\r\ngenera, presents difficulties to the systematic botanist which are\r\nreflected in a complex synonymy; but there are certain broad facts which\r\nthe student of dispersal can gather for himself without much difficulty.\r\nWhen we look at its distribution in the islands of the open Pacific, we\r\nfind that the genus attains its greatest development in the Western\r\nPacific, there being from thirty to forty species known from Fiji and\r\nquite a dozen from Samoa, and that it shades away as we proceed eastward\r\nand northward, some six species being recorded from Tahiti and the\r\nMarquesas, two from Hawaii, and one from Juan Fernandez near the South\r\nAmerican mainland. The arrangement of the species shows fairly\r\nconclusively that the genus Psychotria, as it is found in the Pacific,\r\nhas, like most of the other plants of this era of non-endemic genera,\r\nbeen derived from the Asiatic side of the ocean. (The absence of species\r\nof this genus from Mr. Cheeseman’s Rarotongan collections seems strange.\r\nIt is represented by some species in Tonga, and it is extremely probable\r\nthat it will be subsequently found also in the Rarotongan group.)\r\n\r\nThat the age of dispersal of the genus Psychotria over the Pacific\r\nislands has almost passed away is evident from the circumstance that of\r\nthe half-hundred species known from these groups, all but some four or\r\nfive are confined to particular groups. There is one species, P.\r\ninsularum, that ranges over the South Pacific from Fiji to the Tahitian\r\nregion; and there are two or three others that keep up a connection\r\nbetween the adjacent groups of Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga, the last having\r\nno peculiar species; but, apart from these indications, isolating\r\ninfluences generally prevail. The two Hawaiian species are both endemic\r\nand are only recorded from the island of Kauai, so that in that\r\narchipelago there has not even been inter-island dispersal of the genus.\r\nFor Fiji it would seem from the _Index Kewensis_ and other authorities\r\nthat at least two-thirds of the species are confined to the group. Of\r\nthe dozen Samoan species only two or three are known outside the\r\nislands. Four out of the five Tahitian species are peculiar, and the\r\nonly Marquesan species named by Drake del Castello is endemic. Even the\r\nsolitary species of Juan Fernandez is endemic, there attaining the\r\ndimensions of a fair-sized tree. It forms the subject of an illustration\r\nin Schimper’s _Plant-Geography_, page 491.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, birds may be said to have almost ceased dispersing\r\nthis genus over the Pacific. This is not because birds have ceased to be\r\npartial to the fruits, but because the frugivorous birds that used to\r\nrange over the Pacific archipelagoes now restrict their wanderings to\r\nthe limits of a single group. If we find occasionally in other parts of\r\nthe world, as in the occurrence of a Florida species of Psychotria in\r\nthe Bermudas, some evidence of a dispersal still in operation, this is\r\nnothing more than we observe in the case of a few of the Polynesian\r\nspecies now. The connection between birds and plants in the Pacific is\r\ndiscussed in Chapter XXXIII. In this ocean the dispersal of the genus is\r\nnow practically dead, and Psychotria presents no exception to that\r\ngeneral tendency towards isolation and differentiation exhibited by most\r\ngenera of the tropical Pacific as the result of failure of the means of\r\ndispersal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CYRTANDRA (Gesneraceæ).\r\n\r\nThis remarkable genus of shrubs, which forms the subject of an important\r\nmemoir by Mr. C. B. Clarke (_De Cand. Mon. Phan._ v. 1883-87), offers,\r\nas Mr. Hemsley remarks, an example of a Malayan genus extending to\r\nPolynesia and there developing numerous species. Of some 180 known\r\nspecies, about 80 or nearly half are confined to Polynesia, the rest\r\nbeing mainly Malayan. Of the Polynesian species about thirty are\r\nHawaiian, twenty Fijian, fifteen Samoan, and twelve Tahitian; whilst\r\nsolitary species are restricted to Tonga and Rarotonga respectively.\r\n\r\nThe most significant feature in the distribution of this genus in\r\nPolynesia is not only, as is pointed out by Mr. Clarke, that every group\r\nhas its peculiar species, but that very few species are found in more\r\nthan one group, and that even in the same archipelago each island has\r\nits own species. Thus, of the thirty Hawaiian species, all of which are\r\npeculiar to the group, only two or three, according to Hillebrand, are\r\nat all generally distributed over the islands, whilst four-fifths have\r\nnot yet been found to be common to more than one island. So again, all\r\nthe species found in the Tahitian Group proper are peculiar, with the\r\nexception of one extending to the neighbouring Paumotu Islands; and even\r\nRarotonga has its own species. In the region comprising Fiji, Tonga, and\r\nSamoa the same rule prevails, only two or three species connecting the\r\nthree groups together. There thus seems to be not only a complete\r\nsuspension of the dispersal agencies between the various archipelagoes,\r\nbut also often between the several islands of a group. This is\r\nparticularly to be remarked with the relatively contiguous groups of\r\nFiji, Samoa, and Tonga, since with most other genera a number of species\r\nare common to all three archipelagoes. “The polymorphism of the Hawaiian\r\nCyrtandras,” says Hillebrand, “is extraordinary: no single form extends\r\nover the whole group, and not many are common to more than one island.\r\nThe variations affect nearly every part of the plant, and branch out and\r\nintercross each other to such an extent that it is next to impossible to\r\ndefine exact limits of species.” Genera, however, run riot in other\r\ngroups of the Pacific besides Hawaii, and Reinecke uses much the same\r\nlanguage with reference to Elatostema, an Urticaceous genus in Samoa,\r\nattributing the wealth of forms to the sensitiveness of the plants to\r\nthe varying conditions of station (see Chapter XXVII).\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of Cyrtandra in the Pacific is rather startling to the\r\nstudent of plant-dispersal when he reflects on the suitability of the\r\nberries for dispersing the plant through the agency of birds. That the\r\nvegetation of oceanic islands should be of an endemic character is a\r\nfact, remarks Mr. Clarke, that is illustrated by many other orders\r\nbesides the Gesneraceæ. But the point we have to remember is that not\r\nonly does the genus Cyrtandra display the same prolific character in the\r\nlarge continental islands of Malaya, such as Java, Sumatra, and Borneo,\r\neach of which possesses at least a couple of dozen species, but that\r\nthis seems to be a feature of the tribe Cyrtandreæ and of the whole\r\norder. The genera, as observed by Mr. Clarke, are very continuous in\r\ntheir areas of distribution, and in the tribe Cyrtandreæ there are very\r\nfew species that extend to more than one region, whether on the mainland\r\nor in an oceanic archipelago. In the Himalayas, he says, closely allied\r\nspecies of Didymocarpus are confined to single districts, although there\r\nappears no reason either in soil or climate why they should not spread\r\nto the adjacent valleys.\r\n\r\nThere is therefore, we may infer, nothing peculiarly characteristic of\r\ninsular floras in this prolific display of the genus Cyrtandra in the\r\nPacific, except that it is rather more pronounced in an oceanic group\r\nthan in a continent. The same general cause is working alike in an\r\nisland in mid-ocean, in a large continental island bordering the\r\nmainland, and on the mainland itself. With the Pacific Cyrtandras as\r\nwith the British species of Rubus the variability may be so great that\r\nthe ordinary agencies of dispersal fail to keep it in check; and when,\r\nas in the Pacific islands, the suspension of the activity of these\r\nagencies is complete, the formative energy of the species knows no\r\nbounds other than the determining limits of station. Our lesson from the\r\nPacific Cyrtandras is therefore this. The isolation of the oceanic\r\narchipelagoes may not explain the endemic character of the flora, but\r\nonly the extreme degree to which the endemism is carried. When a genus\r\nis in its prime, it can defy all the limiting conditions imposed by\r\nsimilarity of station and by free and unchecked means of dispersal, the\r\nessential marks of a species or a genus having probably in their\r\ndevelopment little or no connection with environment.\r\n\r\nThe Cyrtandras of the Pacific Islands are most frequent where vegetation\r\nis rank, as in moist woods, in humid valleys, and in shady ravines and\r\ngorges; but they may also occur in more exposed and drier stations. They\r\noften grow gregariously, and Schimper says the same of them in the Java\r\nforests (_Plant-Geography_, pp. 291, 297).\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the genus is described by Clarke as a fleshy or a\r\ncoriaceous berry. Almost everywhere in the Pacific groups the berry is\r\nwhite and fleshy; but it is noteworthy that out of the nine Tahitian\r\nspecies where the fruit is particularised by Drake del Castello, in two\r\ncases it is designated a capsule and in seven a berry. It is in this\r\nconnection worth remarking that in Malaya other genera of the tribe\r\noften have capsular or dry and coriaceous berries. The conspicuous white\r\nberries of the Pacific species would readily attract birds, and their\r\nminute roughened seeds scattered through the pulp might readily adhere\r\nto their plumage or even be ejected unharmed in their droppings. As\r\nrespecting the capacity for dispersal, the Pacific Cyrtandras come near\r\nthe Hawaiian endemic genera of Lobeliaceæ with baccate fruits and minute\r\nseeds. Speaking of Malayan genera of the tribe Cyrtandreæ, Mr. Ridley\r\nsays that their dry, dull-coloured, and inconspicuous corky fruits are\r\noften devoured by animals. The seeds, on account of their roughened\r\nsurface, adhere to rocks and other surfaces and readily germinate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       FREYCINETIA (Pandanaceæ).\r\n\r\nIf there is any genus of tropical plants to which the student of\r\ndistribution can look for guidance in the region of the Pacific, it is\r\nto Freycinetia as dealt with by Dr. Warburg in his monograph on the\r\norder (Engler’s _Pflanzenreich_, iv. 9, 1900). Its characters and its\r\ndistribution are well defined; and here, if anywhere, we might be able\r\nto work out the history of a genus. In the words of the German botanist,\r\nit stands quite apart from Pandanus and Sararanga, the two other genera\r\nof the order. When Hillebrand was preparing his work on the Hawaiian\r\nflora, more than a quarter of a century ago, only about thirty species\r\nwere known. Warburg’s list, excluding doubtful forms, comprises sixty\r\nspecies, and even this number the author surmises will be doubled in\r\nfuture years. The later investigators, however, have not materially\r\nextended the range of the genus; and the statement of the botanists of a\r\ngeneration ago, that it extends from Ceylon through Malaya and Australia\r\nto New Zealand, and is found on almost every elevated island of the\r\nPacific, can only be supplemented by extending its area to the Asiatic\r\nmainland in Burma where a wide-ranging Malayan species exists.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, remarkable that no endemic species can be with certainty\r\naccredited to the mainland of Asia either in Burma or in the Malay\r\npeninsula where the genus also occurs. The Malayan region from Java to\r\nthe Philippines possesses quite three-fifths of the species, and it is\r\nsingular how few wide-ranging species there are. The Philippine Islands,\r\nBorneo, Celebes, Sumatra, Java, New Guinea, &c., have all their own\r\nspecies, the only wide-ranging plant being Freycinetia angustifolia,\r\nwhich occupies the region from Burma to Java and Borneo. So also in the\r\nPacific, there is no widely distributed species, every group possessing\r\nits own plant or plants, and there does not appear to be any Freycinetia\r\nthat is common to two groups. Thus, Hawaii and Tahiti each have their\r\nown species. Rarotonga, according to Cheeseman, owns a peculiar but not\r\nyet fully described form. Samoa has two and Tonga has one species.\r\nWestward from Tonga and Samoa the numbers of species increase, Fiji\r\npossessing five and New Caledonia four. Australia and New Zealand each\r\nclaim two species as their own.\r\n\r\nDr. Warburg, who has studied the genus in its home, remarks on page 43\r\nthat none of the species possess any means of dispersal enabling them to\r\ncross an ocean; and he connects with this the fact that the genus is\r\nonly found (to use his own words) on islands like those of Samoa,\r\nTahiti, and Hawaii, that possess a “palæobiotic” nucleus\r\n(_paläobiotischen Kern_) and not on islands like the Bonin Islands of\r\nnew formation (_auf Neubildungen_). This attitude towards the problem of\r\nplant-distribution in the Pacific is backed by a great experience; but\r\nit is one, of course, that is directly opposed to the line of argument\r\nfollowed in these pages; and it is needless to say that it is not\r\nencouraging to the student of plant-dispersal. Yet one could hardly look\r\nupon the islands of the Tongan Group with their representative of the\r\nendemic Freycinetias as of more ancient origin than the Bonin Islands\r\nthat have none; and plants that find their homes on the peaks and in the\r\nforests of mountainous islands would rarely find a suitable station on\r\nthe low coral islands of the Pacific. It is, however, noteworthy that\r\nProfessor Schimper is inclined to include a species of Freycinetia as\r\namongst the strand-flora of the coral islands of the Java Sea (_Ind.\r\nMal. Strand-flora_, p. 134). With regard to the question of the means of\r\ndispersal of Freycinetias, it will at once be shown that these plants\r\npossess many opportunities for dispersal by birds.\r\n\r\nThough in our own time dispersal by birds between the various Pacific\r\narchipelagoes is often largely suspended, the inter-island dispersal in\r\neach group is usually active through the agency of birds, now like the\r\nplants they distribute confined to each group. Thus with Freycinetia we\r\nfind that, notwithstanding that each Pacific group is, as regards this\r\ngenus, isolated from the others, the separate islands, as in the case of\r\nthose of Hawaii, may possess a common species dispersed over the area.\r\nThe ripe fruit, which consists of a number of berries in a head or\r\nspike, is juicy and pulpy, and contains in each berry a large number of\r\nminute oblong or fusiform seeds, usually one or two millimetres long and\r\npossessing thick toughish tests. Birds, indeed, are fond of pecking at\r\nthe ripe fruit-heads in Hawaii. Thus we learn from the _Aves\r\nHawaiienses_ of Wilson and Evans that a Grosbeak (Psittacirostra) and\r\nthe Hawaiian Crow (Corvus tropicus) feed principally on ripe Freycinetia\r\nfruits, the seeds having been often found by Mr. Wilson in the stomach\r\nof the former bird. No doubt these birds distribute the seeds over the\r\nislands of the group. Mr. Perkins tells me that the Grosbeak is found\r\nunmodified all over the group, and that it no doubt frequently gets\r\ncarried _nolens volens_ from one island to another. In his memoir on the\r\nbirds in the _Fauna Hawaiiensis_, he remarks that the essential food of\r\nthe “Ou,” the native name of this bird, is the fruiting inflorescence of\r\nFreycinetias. The “Oo” (Acrulocercus) and the Hawaiian Crow above\r\nmentioned, as he also observes, feed on these ripe red fruits. Like Mr.\r\nWilson, he sometimes found the Crow absolutely filled with this food to\r\nthe exclusion of all others (see Chapter XXXIII). Facts of a similar\r\nkind came under my notice whilst in these islands. Thus on one occasion\r\nI observed, on a leaf below a fruit-head that had been partly eaten by a\r\nbird, a pellet half an inch long composed entirely of Freycinetia seeds\r\nwell soaked with the gastric juices and apparently only recently\r\ndisgorged. Sir W. Buller refers to different New Zealand birds, as the\r\nBanded Rail (Rallus philippensis), the Kaka Parrot (Nestor\r\nmeridionalis), and the “Tui” (Prosthemadera), that live on the “sugary\r\nflowering spadices” of Freycinetia Banksii. One can legitimately suppose\r\nthat they also attack the juicy berries. It is singular that as we learn\r\nfrom Dr. Warburg (p. 17), Flying-Foxes (Pteropidæ) feed on the flowers\r\nand top-leaves of many species of Freycinetia, and he considers that\r\nthey would aid in fertilisation by carrying about the pollen in the hair\r\nof the head. Here again it would seem to us highly probable that whilst\r\nbrushing past a ripe fruit-head these bats might readily carry away in\r\ntheir fur some of the minute seeds, which in the fresh berry are\r\n“sticky” or adhesive.\r\n\r\nJust as it was possible in the case of Coprosma in the South Pacific\r\n(see page 296) to connect its distribution with the range of the Purple\r\nWater-Hens (Porphyrio), so it may perhaps be legitimate to associate the\r\nrange of Freycinetia over Polynesia with the distribution of the\r\nHoney-Eaters (Meliphagidæ) in the Pacific, a family sometimes possessing\r\npeculiar genera as in New Zealand and Hawaii, and one in which the\r\nspecies have usually a very confined range, being sometimes limited to a\r\nsingle island (Newton in _Encycl. Brit._ xii. 139). To this family\r\nbelongs the New Zealand “Tui” above mentioned; and it may be remarked\r\nthat these birds as a rule feed on soft fruits, such as figs, and\r\nbananas. It is to Acrulocercus, one of the Hawaiian genera of the\r\nMeliphagidæ, that Mr. Perkins refers me, on my asking him to name some\r\nof the fruit-eaters in that group.\r\n\r\nThese climbing shrubs, as Dr. Warburg observes, mostly frequent the\r\ntropical forests up to 4,000 feet and over. Though their most familiar\r\nhabit is as tree-climbers in the forests, in localities where there are\r\nno trees they adopt a trailing habit and cover mountain peaks and ridges\r\nwith a dense growth to the exclusion of almost all other plants. Many a\r\npeak in the Pacific islands would be inaccessible if it were not for the\r\ndense growth of these plants on their precipitous sides. It was owing to\r\nthe friendly aid of a tangled mass of Freycinetia stems that Lieutenant\r\nHeming and myself were able to clamber to the summit of Fauro Island\r\n(1,900 feet) in the Solomon Group, where I discovered a tree that under\r\nthe name of Sararanga forms the type of the third genus of the\r\nPandanaceæ.\r\n\r\nWhilst describing their station, it will be of interest to also record\r\nthe altitudes at which these plants have been observed in the tropical\r\nPacific. Since they can be independent of trees and are as much at home\r\non treeless rocky peaks and mountain crests, the upper limit would\r\nusually be determined by climatic conditions, abundance of rain and\r\ngreat humidity being the chief requisites; but, as will be seen below,\r\nthis limit does not seem to be reached in the tropical islands of the\r\nSouth Pacific except perhaps in Tahiti. In the Fijis the Freycinetias\r\nascend to the highest mountain peaks. Thus, three of the species\r\ndiscovered here by Seemann were found at elevations of about 4,000 feet\r\non Voma Peak in Viti Levu and in the highlands of Taviuni. In Vanua\r\nLevu, as I found, they cover the highest peaks 3,500 feet above the sea.\r\nThey are especially abundant on the lofty mountain ridges, and clothe\r\nthe higher slopes of the Mbatini Ridge which terminates in the highest\r\npeak of the island. In no locality did I find them growing in such\r\ndensely tangled masses as on the long ridge-like crest that forms the\r\nupper part of Mount Freeland, 2,740 feet above the sea. For more than an\r\nhour in order to reach the summit I had to clamber along the crest of a\r\nridge covered with a dense growth several feet deep of these trailing\r\nplants, without touching the ground beneath.\r\n\r\nIn Samoa, as we learn from Reinecke, Freycinetias are common on the\r\nmountain ridges, climbing the trees and forming also a dense undergrowth\r\ncovering the ground and concealing the rocks. They occur at all levels\r\nfrom 1,000 feet above the sea up to the highest region of Savaii, rather\r\nover 5,000 feet in elevation. In Rarotonga, according to Mr. Cheeseman,\r\nthe Freycinetias are very abundant on the mountains, which reach a\r\nheight of 2,200 feet, the plants scrambling up the trunks of trees or\r\nover rocks and frequently rendering the forest almost impenetrable. In\r\nTahiti, Nadeaud tells us, the Freycinetias often cover in an\r\ninextricable network the sides of the valleys at elevations of 2,000 to\r\n3,300 feet, extending in their vertical range from the lower levels of\r\nthe island to the highest inaccessible peaks which attain a maximum\r\nheight of about 7,300 feet.\r\n\r\nThese plants in the Hawaiian group are common in the lower woods as\r\nHillebrand informs us, that is to say, at elevations of 2,000 or 3,000\r\nfeet. During my descent from Mauna Kea through the Hamakua forests on\r\nthe north-east side I observed that the Freycinetias commenced at an\r\naltitude of 3,900 feet, and that they attained their greatest\r\ndevelopment between 3,200 and 2,000 feet. These plants ascended quite a\r\nthousand feet higher on these mountain slopes than the Bird’s Nest Fern\r\n(Asplenium Nidus), which reached an altitude of 2,800 feet. In the\r\nforests on the west side of Mauna Loa they were abundant at altitudes of\r\n3,500 to 4,000 feet and were not noticed above 4,500 feet. On the slopes\r\nof Mount Eeka in West Maui they abounded between 3,500 and 4,400 feet.\r\nIn those localities where the forest descends to the sea, Freycinetias\r\noccur at the coast, and on Oahu they are often found at elevations under\r\na thousand feet.\r\n\r\nI have but few data showing the altitude obtained by Freycinetias in\r\nother regions, as, for instance, in their most southerly habitat in New\r\nZealand, where they give a tropical luxuriance to the forests, or in\r\ntheir chief home in Malaya. From Schimper’s observations\r\n(_Plant-Geography_, p. 293) it would seem that they thrive in the Gedeh\r\nforest of Java at elevations of about 5,000 feet. Except for the lower\r\nlevels, Warburg makes but few references to this subject in dealing with\r\nthe species. It appears to me that some very interesting results might\r\nbe obtained by comparing the vertical range of this genus in different\r\nregions, as, for instance, in New Zealand and in Borneo or in Java. We\r\nmight get indications that since the age of Freycinetia began the\r\nclimate in tropical latitudes has been getting warmer, and that the\r\nerstwhile plants of the lower levels are now as a result climbing the\r\nmountain slopes. The student of distribution may find here a genus that\r\nhas been “cornered” not only in space and time, but as regards its\r\nconditions of existence. Since it is obvious that during a gradual\r\nincrease of temperature it would ascend the mountains and during a\r\nlowering of temperature it would descend to the plains, it follows that\r\nin the mountains of an oceanic island it might be driven into the sea or\r\nawait extinction on a mountain-top. In the tropics also there would be\r\nno escape during a gradual increase of temperature. Here again it would\r\nmake its last stand on the strand, and, forced to choose between Death\r\nand Adaptation, the genus might select the latter alternative and\r\npresent us with a startling new form. In this sense Freycinetia seems to\r\noffer itself as “fair game” for the speculative botanist, and at all\r\nevents he will be able to interrogate it as to the connection between\r\nits existing range of altitude and the climatic conditions of the\r\nearlier phases of its history.\r\n\r\nThe Freycinetias bear the same name over Polynesia, “ie-ie” in Hawaii,\r\n“ie” and “ie-ie” in Tahiti and Samoa, which appear in their full form in\r\nthe Rarotongan and Maori “kie-kie.” The secret of the wide distribution\r\nof the name lies in the circumstance that this is a mat-word over much\r\nof Polynesia, as in Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, the Gilbert group, Tahiti, &c.,\r\nFreycinetia leaves being often employed for making mats, as in Samoa and\r\nNew Zealand. The same word is applied in some groups to small species of\r\nPandanus that were also used in mat-making. Thus in Fiji “kie-kie” was\r\nnot only the name for a mat-dress, but also of Pandanus caricosus that\r\nsupplied the material. In the home of the Polynesians in Malaya and its\r\nvicinity the same word for mat and Pandanus occur. Thus, “gerekere” in\r\nthe Motu dialect of New Guinea and “keker” or “kekel” in Amboyna are the\r\nnames of small species of Pandanus employed in mat-manufacture; whilst\r\n“kihu” and “kiel” in Celebes are the words for the mats themselves.\r\nTherefore in one form or another the word, originally applied to the\r\nmats, but now often restricted to the plants from which the materials\r\nwere derived, ranges over the great region extending from Malaya to New\r\nZealand, Tahiti, and Hawaii, and, as I have shown in the table given in\r\nmy paper on Polynesian Plant-Names (_Journ. Victor. Inst._, London,\r\n1896), it may be traced even to Further India, as in Annam, and to\r\nNorth-East Australia. It thus covers the area to which the migrations of\r\nthe Polynesians of the Pacific have been confined, and it covers also\r\nthe area of the genus Freycinetia. There is something far more than mere\r\nanalogy between man and plants in their occupation of the Pacific\r\nislands. The plants are Malayan and the Polynesians are from Malaya\r\nalso, whilst in both man and plants we experience the same difficulty in\r\nexplaining their dispersal over the ocean. Divesting his mind of all\r\nprevious conceptions, the ethnologist might profitably study _de novo_\r\nthe dispersion of man in the Pacific from the standpoint of\r\nplant-dispersal (see Chapter XXVIII).\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SAPINDUS AND PHYLLANTHUS.\r\n\r\nBrief reference can alone be made to these two genera. Foremost comes\r\nSapindus, which is represented by two endemic species, one in Hawaii and\r\none in Fiji, and by another species, found in Tahiti, the Marquesas, and\r\nEaster Island, which is identified by some botanists with the well-known\r\nAmerican “soap-tree,” S. saponaria. There are several difficulties\r\nconnected with the presence of this genus of the Old and New World in\r\nthe Pacific. Not the least of them is connected with the transport of\r\nthe large seeds of this genus, an inch in size, to the isolated Hawaiian\r\nGroup, where it is represented by a solitary endemic species in the\r\nisland of Oahu. The fleshy mesocarp of the fruits might attract birds;\r\nbut it is not easy to perceive how birds could carry such large seeds\r\nover some 1,500 or 2,000 miles of ocean. Yet the same difficulty exists\r\nwith a few other genera, such as Osmanthus and Sideroxylon, that are\r\nonly represented in Hawaii by endemic species, genera which require the\r\nagency of birds to explain their occurrence unless we wish to postulate\r\na continental connection for this group. (See under those genera in\r\nChapter XXVII.)\r\n\r\nThe large Euphorbiaceous genus Phyllanthus, spread universally over the\r\ntropics and containing some 500 known species, clearly indicates by its\r\ndistribution in the Pacific islands that genera with dry fruits, such as\r\nare typical of the order, are as widely distributed and just as much at\r\nhome in these islands as the genera with fleshy fruits, such as\r\nPsychotria and Cyrtandra. The small trees and shrubs of Phyllanthus are\r\ncommon in dry, open, partially wooded districts near the sea-border. The\r\ngenus attains its greatest development in this ocean in New Caledonia\r\nand Fiji; and since the number of species diminishes the further we\r\npenetrate the Pacific, it can be scarcely doubted that the genus has\r\nentered this ocean from the west. In Fiji there are at least 20 species,\r\nof which probably half are not recorded from elsewhere. In Samoa there\r\nare seemingly but few peculiar species. In Hawaii there is only one\r\nindigenous species, and that is endemic. The genus, however, has\r\ndeveloped a lesser centre of distribution in East Polynesia, there being\r\nabout a dozen species known from Tahiti and the Marquesas, of which half\r\nare peculiar to one or other of those groups. From experiments made by\r\nme in Fiji on the fruits and seeds of two species it was evident that\r\nthey possessed little or no capacity for dispersal by the currents. We\r\nlook, therefore, to the birds, and in this connection it is of interest\r\nto note that this genus is included amongst those known to be dispersed\r\nby birds in the Pacific, some of the fruits having been found in the\r\ncrops of fruit-pigeons shot by Prof. Moseley in the Admiralty Islands\r\n(_Bot. Chall. Exped._, Introd. 46; iv. 308).\r\n\r\n\r\n                        PRITCHARDIA (Palmaceæ).\r\n\r\nThis genus of Fan Palms supplies an instructive lesson for the student\r\nof plant-distribution, more especially with reference to the loss of the\r\nendemic reputation of a genus. Regarded by the earlier botanists who\r\nvisited the Pacific as identical with the familiar Asiatic Talipot Palm\r\n(Corypha umbraculifera), the Fan Palms of this region, as represented in\r\nFiji and Hawaii, were subsequently placed by Seemann and Wendland in a\r\nnew genus restricted to Polynesia and named after a former British\r\nConsul in Fiji. Since that time it has lost its reputation as a\r\npeculiarly Pacific genus, since a species (Pritchardia filifera) has\r\nbeen found lingering in a few valleys in Arizona, where it enjoys the\r\ndistinction of being the most northerly in station of all the world’s\r\npalms (Linden in _Illustr. Hort._ vol. 24, 1876-77). It would thus\r\nappear that the Pacific islands have derived this genus of palms from\r\nthe western part of North America, but the whole question is beset with\r\nmany difficulties, and not the least is that connected with the\r\nconfusion that seems to reign in several cases as regards the allocation\r\nand identity of the species.\r\n\r\nSix species are named in the _Index Kewensis_, viz.: Pritchardia\r\nmacrocarpa, restricted to Hawaii; P. martii and P. gaudichaudii, of the\r\nPacific islands; P. pacifica, assigned to Fiji; P. vuylstekeana, from\r\nthe Paumotus; and P. filifera, from the west side of North America.\r\nThough it is sometimes difficult to reconcile this account of the\r\ndistribution of the genus in the Pacific with views held by other\r\nbotanists, it offers the safest basis for the future investigation of\r\nthe subject. It would be, however, necessary to remember that\r\nPritchardia gaudichaudii and P. martii are regarded by Hillebrand as\r\npeculiar to the Hawaiian Islands, and that the exact locality of the\r\nPaumotu species is not very definitely settled, if it depends on the\r\nremarks made on this species in the _Gardeners’ Chronicle_ for 1883. No\r\nmention is indeed made by Drake del Castillo of any Tahitian or\r\nPaumotuan species.\r\n\r\nWhilst in Hawaii and Fiji I was much interested in these palms, and the\r\nfollowing remarks are merely intended to be a contribution to the\r\nsubject. According to Seemann, Hemsley, Drake del Castillo, and Burkill,\r\nPritchardia pacifica, which often attains a height of thirty to\r\nthirty-five feet, occurs in Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, and the Marquesas, but\r\nit does not exist in Tahiti, and Cheeseman does not include it in the\r\nRarotongan flora. Except in the Tonga Group, where, according to Lister\r\nas quoted by Hemsley, the palms form conspicuous objects along the\r\nweather shore of the island of Eua, this species is rarely found in the\r\nwild state in the South Pacific. This especially applies to Fiji, as Mr.\r\nHorne also observes; and at most one is accustomed to see (to employ the\r\nwords of Dr. Seemann) one or two trees outside a village which are\r\nreserved, as in many parts of Polynesia, for the use of the chiefs who\r\nemploy the leaves for fans and for other purposes. But even this reason\r\nfor preserving the palms scarcely now exists in Fiji, and at the time of\r\nmy sojourn in Vanua Levu (1897-99) the trees were rare enough to be\r\nregarded as curiosities. In the Marquesas, according to Bennett (quoted\r\nby Seemann), they grow in groves in the valleys of the interior. Dr.\r\nReinecke does not even include the species in the Samoan flora, but\r\nmentions it with the Date-Palm (Phœnix dactylifera) as if it were\r\nrecently introduced. It was, however, found in that group by the United\r\nStates Exploring Expedition about 1840, and this is evidently the palm\r\nreferred to by Captain Cook as existing at his time in the Tongan Group.\r\n\r\nThe Hawaiian species of the palm appear to be three in number,\r\nPritchardia gaudichaudii and P. martii, both regarded by Hillebrand as\r\nconfined to the group, and P. macrocarpa of Linden, also endemic\r\n(_Illustr. Hort._ vol. 26). The two first-named species are evidently on\r\nthe road to extinction in the wild state, and often find their last\r\nrefuge on rocky, almost inaccessible, inland cliffs. Pritchardia\r\ngaudichaudii, about twenty feet in height, is found in the wild state,\r\nas we learn from Hillebrand, on the islands of Molokai and Hawaii. It\r\nwas at one time frequently met with near native dwellings; but during my\r\nsojourn in 1896-97 on the last-named island it was not at all frequent,\r\nand as a rule only came under my notice occasionally in clumps of three\r\nor four trees on the Kona and Puna coasts, as near Kiholo, Milolii, and\r\nKalapana. However, it was more frequent in the Waimanu district of\r\nKohala in the same island. Here I noticed it growing in clumps in\r\nprecipitous rocky situations at elevations ranging from 1,200 to 2,000\r\nfeet. The other palm mentioned by Hillebrand, P. martii, is only five or\r\nsix feet high, and is confined mostly to Oahu and Molokai.\r\n\r\nThe agency of man in introducing these interesting Fan-Palms into the\r\nHawaiian Islands seems out of the question, since they are home\r\nproductions in a specific sense and are doubtless ancient components of\r\nthe flora; and, of course, grave objections exist on ethnological\r\ngrounds, if this genus had originally its home in America. With\r\nreference, however, to Pritchardia pacifica of the South Pacific, it is\r\nnot unlikely that man has aided in the distribution of a palm mainly\r\npreserved by planting in and about the villages and set apart from time\r\nimmemorial for the use of the chiefs.\r\n\r\nIn this connection the aboriginal names are of some importance and may\r\nbe very briefly here referred to. The Fijian “Viu,” the “Piu” of Samoa,\r\nTonga, and Futuna, and the Tongan “Biu” are forms of the same name\r\napplied to this palm all over West Polynesia; and I have shown in my\r\npaper on Polynesian Plant-Names that in the form of “Firo” in the\r\nSolomon Islands (Bougainville Straits) and of “Wiru” in Sundanese, one\r\nof the Malayan languages, the same name is given to another genus of Fan\r\nPalms, namely, Licuala. But since these West Polynesian names do not\r\nalways conform with the laws of consonantal interchange in this region,\r\nthey cannot all be considered as indigenous in the languages concerned.\r\nIf, for instance, “Viu” is an indigenous Fijian name, as no doubt it is,\r\nsince it follows the phonetic laws affecting the Malayan and Fijian\r\nlanguages, “Piu” must be a foreign word in Samoa and Tonga, and “Biu”\r\nmust be another introduced Tongan name.... The Fijians have in “Sakiki”\r\n(contracted into “Saii” in the Somosomo dialect) another name for this\r\npalm. This is probably derived from “Kiekie,” a mat-word in different\r\nforms in various Polynesian groups, and applied in many islands to the\r\nplants that supply the materials for mat-making, such as Pandanus and\r\nFreycinetia.\r\n\r\nThe Hawaiian generic name of “Loulu” for these palms appears to be quite\r\nlocal; but it may possibly have a common origin with “Roro,” one of the\r\nFijian names of Cycas circinalis. It is pointed out by Hillebrand that\r\nthe Hawaiian name of the edible kernels of these palms, “Hawane” or\r\n“Wahane,” occurs in the Marquesas as “Vahana” applied to the palm, a\r\ncomparison that is on linguistic grounds quite legitimate. “Vaake” is\r\nanother Marquesan name, which recalls “Vakoa,” the Malagasy word for\r\nPandanus.\r\n\r\nWhen we compare the variety of the names of the Pritchardia fan-palms in\r\nthe Pacific Islands with the prevailing uniformity of the names of\r\ncultivated plants transported by the aborigines in their migrations from\r\nMalaya, such as the taro, the yam, the sugar-cane, the coco-nut, and the\r\nMalay-apple, we perceive that the testimony of the names points to the\r\nsame conclusion as the botanical evidence, namely, that the ancestors of\r\nthe Hawaiians found these palms in the group at the time of its\r\noccupation. In the South Pacific much uncertainty prevails. The\r\nancestors of the West Polynesian peoples evidently brought the word for\r\na fan-palm from their Malayan home; but it is doubtful if they found\r\nPritchardia already established in all the islands; and the apparent\r\nhome of the genus in America prevents us from attributing to a palm,\r\nthat is by some botanists regarded as confined to the Western Pacific, a\r\nhome in the neighbouring regions to the west. There is thus a lack of\r\nagreement between the botanical and ethnological indications as regards\r\nthe original American origin of Pritchardia in the South Pacific.\r\n\r\nThere remain then the agencies of the currents and of birds. A singular\r\nfeature in the distribution of the Hawaiian species, Pritchardia\r\ngaudichaudii, at once affords a clue as concerning the dispersal in the\r\nNorth Pacific. Dr. Hillebrand remarks that this palm covers part of Bird\r\nIsland, a small volcanic rock forming an outlier of the Hawaiian group\r\nabout 400 miles north-east of Kauai. Here the agency of birds is\r\nsuggested, since it is scarcely likely, though, as shown below, not\r\nimpossible, that stranded fruits of the palm could have established\r\nthemselves in this fashion. Mr. Perkins has an interesting note on the\r\nfood of Ciridops anna, an Hawaiian bird, now nearly extinct, that feeds\r\nprincipally on the blossoms and unripe fruits of the Loulu palms,\r\nprobably of this species. The drupes when fresh have a somewhat fleshy\r\nmesocarp and are about 9/10 of an inch (22 mm.) across, and their\r\ncrustaceous inner shell would undoubtedly fit the seeds for dispersal by\r\nfrugivorous birds like pigeons. The fruits of the other two Hawaiian\r\nspecies are considerably larger, that of P. macrocarpa being, according\r\nto Linden, of the size of a nut of Juglans regia, that is, about 1-1/8\r\ninch or 29 mm., whilst that of P. martii, as we learn from Hillebrand,\r\nis from 1-1/2 to 2 inches or 37 to 50 mm. Allowing for the variation in\r\nsize of the fruits within the limits of the genus, there need be no more\r\ndifficulty in assuming that the original species had fruits that could\r\nhave been brought by birds, than in holding that the fruits of\r\nElæocarpus have been carried to Hawaii in the same fashion. The drupes\r\nof Pritchardia pacifica are barely half an inch in diameter. They are\r\nfitted by reason of their hard crustaceous endocarp for dispersal by\r\nfruit-pigeons; and I may here add that these birds are known to\r\ndistribute the fruits of other palms, such as Kentia and Areca, in the\r\nislands of the South Pacific (_Bot. Chall. Exped._ iv. 308, 312).\r\n\r\nBoth in Hawaii and in Fiji I experimented on the capacity of Pritchardia\r\ndrupes for dispersal by the currents. Those of the Hawaiian species, P.\r\ngaudichaudii, have when well dried a light buoyant rather fibrous\r\nmesocarp which enables them to float in the case of a good proportion of\r\nthe fruits for at least five weeks. I had no opportunity of testing the\r\nbuoyancy of the fruits of P. martii, another Hawaiian species; but,\r\njudging from the existence in the coats of a fibrous layer as described\r\nby Hillebrand, they ought to display some floating power. The fruits of\r\nP. pacifica, the South Pacific species, lack the light buoyant covering\r\nof the Hawaiian species above referred to, and display little or no\r\nfloating power even after drying for weeks. Looking at the results of\r\nthese experiments, it would seem that it is not impossible that Hawaii\r\nreceived the genus through the agency of the currents; but it seems\r\nscarcely probable, since it could only have been derived from America,\r\nand the American species grows in the interior of the continent and not\r\nnear the sea-border. The possibility of course exists; but I am inclined\r\nto attribute the presence of Pritchardia in Hawaii to bird-agency.\r\n\r\nMy position from the standpoint of dispersal with regard to Pritchardia\r\nin the Pacific is this. The Hawaiian species I would consider as\r\nAmerican in origin. The Marquesan species, unless recently described,\r\nstill awaits detailed investigation. The West Polynesian species of Fiji\r\nand Tonga, according to the principles of distribution prevailing in the\r\nSouth Pacific, ought to hail from the west.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Summary._\r\n\r\n(1) Whilst the earliest age characterised by the Coniferæ was restricted\r\nto the Western Pacific, and whilst the following age of the Compositæ\r\nand Lobeliaceæ, mainly American in their affinities, was concerned with\r\nthe regions of Hawaii and Tahiti, we have now to discuss the Malayan era\r\nduring which the bulk of the plants were derived from the nearest\r\ntropical regions of the Old World. Here we have to deal with the\r\nlow-level flora of Hawaii, that is to say, with the plants of the levels\r\nbelow 4,000 or 5,000 feet, and with almost the entire floras of the\r\nareas of Fiji-Samoa and of East Polynesia. The whole of the tropical\r\nPacific is here concerned, and not a portion of it, as in the two\r\npreceding eras; and in our comparison we shall see that there are two,\r\nand not as heretofore three, regions to be regarded—the Hawaiian in the\r\nNorth Pacific, and the whole Polynesian area of the South Pacific\r\nextending from Fiji to Tahiti.\r\n\r\n(2) Here the frugivorous bird has been the principal agent in dispersing\r\nthe plants, quite two-thirds of the genera possessing drupes or berries\r\nthat would attract such birds.\r\n\r\n(3) The genera representative of the first part of this era are those\r\nwhich have only peculiar species in Hawaii, and are composed in the\r\nSouth Pacific either entirely of peculiar species or sometimes of a\r\nmixture of endemic and non-endemic species. It is an era of complete\r\nisolation in Hawaii and often of a partial connection between the groups\r\nof the southern region. Except to some extent in the South Pacific, the\r\ndispersing agencies are now no longer active between the groups.\r\n\r\n(4) Amongst the genera typical of this period are Pittosporum, Gardenia,\r\nPsychotria, Cyrtandra, and Freycinetia.\r\n\r\n(5) The two genera of the Rubiaceæ, Psychotria and Coprosma (the last\r\nbelonging to the mountain-flora), appear to be well suited for the\r\ninvestigation of the effect on distribution of the geographical position\r\nof the home of the genus, the first with 600 to 700 species distributed\r\nover the tropics of the Old and New Worlds, the second with some sixty\r\nspecies having its home in New Zealand.\r\n\r\n(6) From the Pacific Cyrtandras we derive the lessons that the display\r\nof great formative power in a genus may not be a peculiarity of an\r\ninsular flora; that the isolation of an oceanic archipelago does not\r\nnecessarily induce “endemism,” but merely intensifies it; and that the\r\nproduction of new species within the limits of a genus like Cyrtandra\r\nmay be nearly as active on the mainland as in an island in mid-ocean.\r\n\r\n(7) From the Freycinetias we learn that it may be possible to connect\r\nthe distribution of a genus of plants with that of a genus or a family\r\nof birds. Just as in Chapter XXIV we endeavoured to connect Coprosma and\r\nPorphyrio (the Purple Water-Hens), so we here suggest a connection, in\r\ntheir range over the Pacific, between the Freycinetias and the\r\nMeliphagidæ (the Honey-eaters), a connection that in the last case at\r\nleast belongs to the past.\r\n\r\n(8) From the genus Phyllanthus we learn that genera with dry fruits may\r\nbe as widely distributed and may display the same formative power in the\r\nPacific as those with fleshy fruits that would seem much more likely to\r\nbe dispersed by birds. Here again we obtain an indirect indication that\r\nspecies-making in these islands is not altogether dependent on\r\nisolation.\r\n\r\n(9) In the case of the genus Sapindus we are apparently compelled to\r\ninfer that its large seeds (in the present species an inch in size) have\r\nbeen transported by birds to Hawaii. Yet in point of size the\r\ndifficulties here raised are no greater than those arising from the\r\nexistence of such genera as Sideroxylon and Elæocarpus in Hawaii, the\r\nfruits of which are known to attract frugivorous birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n     THE MALAYAN ERA OF THE NON-ENDEMIC GENERA OF FLOWERING PLANTS\r\n                             (_continued_)\r\n\r\n   THE AGE OF WIDE DISPERSAL OVER THE TROPICAL PACIFIC (_continued_)\r\n\r\nThe widely dispersed genera that are as a rule not entirely\r\n  represented by endemic species in any\r\n  archipelago.—Elæocarpus.—Dodonæa.—Metrosideros.—Alyxia.—Alphitonia.—Pisonia.—Wikstrœmia.—Peperomia.—Eugenia.—Gossypium.—The\r\n  last stage in the general dispersal of plants of the Malayan\r\n  era as illustrated by the widely-dispersed genera having\r\n  as a rule no peculiar\r\n  species.—Rhus.—Osteomeles.—Plectronia.—Boerhaavia.—Polygonum.—Pipturus.—Dianella.—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nA LATER period in the era of the general dispersal of Malayan plants\r\nover the Pacific is indicated by those genera that as a rule are never\r\nentirely represented by endemic species in any archipelago. Hawaii now\r\ncomes into touch with the world outside, and all the groups possess some\r\nconnecting link. But the beginning of the effect of the isolating\r\ninfluence is shown in the association in each principal archipelago of\r\npeculiar species with those that occur in other groups.\r\n\r\nWe see here illustrated in all but the final stage that process by which\r\na solitary widely-ranging species, alone representing its genus, becomes\r\nultimately in each group the parent of a number of peculiar species. The\r\npolymorphous, or extremely variable, species plays in this period the\r\nall-important part. The earliest stage is exhibited by such genera as\r\nAlphitonia, Dodonæa, Metrosideros, Pisonia, and Wikstrœmia, that possess\r\nin the tropical Pacific a solitary widely-ranging species, varying\r\nindependently in every group and giving rise to forms that, in their\r\ndegree of differentiation, sometimes approach a specific value. Later\r\nstages are shown when the polymorphous species, having done its work of\r\ndistributing the genus, settles down and “differentiates” in every\r\ngroup; and this we see now illustrated in the genera Elæocarpus, Alyxia,\r\nPeperomia, and others.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the genera of this period, of which only a few can be\r\nmentioned here, hail from the tropics of the Old World through Malaya.\r\nThus Alyxia, Elæocarpus, Morinda, and Wikstrœmia are Malayan; whilst\r\ngenera like Eugenia, Peperomia, and Pisonia, that occur in the Old and\r\nNew Worlds, can similarly be traced to the Asiatic side of the ocean by\r\nthe distribution of their species. Others again have their home in New\r\nZealand like Metrosideros, or in Australia, as with Dodonæa and Scævola.\r\nNone are exclusively American. Some of the genera, as Morinda and\r\nScævola, have littoral as well as inland species; but, as shown in\r\nChapter XIV, there is rarely anything to suggest a derivation of the\r\ninland from the coast species, both being, from the standpoint of\r\ndispersal, of independent origin.\r\n\r\nAbout half of the plants have fleshy or sappy fruits (drupes and\r\nberries) that would attract frugivorous birds, such as we find in\r\nXylosma, Elæocarpus, Eugenia, Scævola, Wikstrœmia, &c., whilst the\r\nothers have often dry capsular fruits, with minute seeds as in\r\nMetrosideros, or with larger seeds as in Dodonæa. Some of them, like\r\nPisonia, have fruits that excrete a viscid material that causes them to\r\nadhere firmly to plumage. Birds both granivorous and frugivorous have\r\nbeen actively at work; and there are few difficulties relating to\r\ndispersal connected with the genera, except with such as Gossypium and\r\nElæocarpus.\r\n\r\nI will adopt the method employed in the preceding chapter of discussing\r\nin detail from the standpoint of dispersal some of the genera that came\r\nmost frequently under my notice, or in which I am greatly interested,\r\nand of dealing briefly with some of the rest. Those dealt with in other\r\nconnections will not be treated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ELÆOCARPUS (Tiliaceæ).\r\n\r\nThis is a genus of trees containing, according to the _Index Kewensis_,\r\nabout 130 species, most of which are confined to tropical Asia,\r\nincluding Malaya; but a fair number occur in the Pacific region, in\r\nAustralia, New Zealand, and the islands of the tropical Pacific, and the\r\ngenus is also found in Japan. It will thus be seen that Elæocarpus is\r\nnot only a continental but also a typical insular genus. It has reached\r\nnot only some of the most isolated island-groups of the Pacific, but it\r\nis to be found also in the smaller islands of the Indian Ocean, there\r\nbeing an endemic species in Mauritius. Amongst the Pacific Islands, a\r\nregion with which we are more immediately concerned, it has been\r\nrecorded from the Solomon Islands, New Caledonia, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa,\r\nRarotonga, and Hawaii. It is strange that the genus is not accredited to\r\nTahiti, but since it is represented in Rarotonga we may regard it as not\r\naltogether absent from East Polynesia. Reinecke does not include it\r\namongst the Samoan plants, but Horne, in a short list of plants\r\ncollected in Upolu about 1878, mentions Elæocarpus græffei, a Fijian\r\nspecies (_Year in Fiji_, p. 285).\r\n\r\nNew Caledonia represents the principal centre of the genus in the\r\ntropical Pacific, thirteen species being accredited to it in the _Index\r\nKewensis_. Seemann found six species in Fiji, a number that does not\r\nseem to have been added to by Horne. Of these one is found in Tonga and\r\nSamoa, and of the rest perhaps most are peculiar; but one of them is\r\nclosely allied to a second peculiar Tongan species. Tonga possesses the\r\ntwo species just alluded to, whilst Rarotonga and Hawaii have each a\r\npeculiar species.\r\n\r\nFrom an interesting comparison made by Mr. Burkill of some of the\r\nPolynesian species, it would seem that Elæocarpus, if not actually\r\npossessing a widely-spread polymorphous species in the tropical Pacific,\r\npresents us with the next stage in the differentiation of the species.\r\nThus, he says in his paper on the flora of Vavau that an endemic Tongan\r\nspecies, E. tonganus, is allied to three different species—E. græffei\r\nfrom Fiji, E. floridanus from the Solomon Group, and E. glandulifer from\r\nCeylon—three species, he remarks, which are “so closely allied that it\r\nis possible to regard them as insular subspecies.” It would thus appear\r\nthat some of the species of the Western Pacific are almost in touch with\r\nAsiatic species. It would be of importance to determine whether some\r\naffinity can be detected between the species of this part of the Pacific\r\nand some of the widely-ranging species of Indo-Malaya, such as E.\r\nganitrus and E. oblongus. Mr. Burkill goes on to say that the solitary\r\nHawaiian and Rarotongan species are closely allied, an inference which\r\nis of interest as indicating the route by which Hawaii received its\r\nspecies. The genus, we may fairly infer, once possessed a widely-ranging\r\npolymorphous or very variable Asiatic species in the tropical Pacific;\r\nand we see it now in the next stage of specific differentiation in\r\nvarious far-removed regions. In this connection Seemann significantly\r\nremarks that all the Fijian species are evidently very local in the\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\nIt will be appropriate here to refer briefly to the station and mode of\r\noccurrence of the species. They occur most typically as forest-trees,\r\noften of considerable height. In New Zealand, according to Hochstetter,\r\nthey form a feature in the temperate rain-forest; and, as we learn from\r\nKurz, they are similarly conspicuous in the tropical rain-forests of\r\nPegu. To this seeming indifference to the varying thermal conditions of\r\ndifferent latitudes we shall have subsequently to refer again. The tree\r\nof the Hawaiian Group, as Hillebrand tells us, is common in the forests\r\nof Oahu and Kauai, but is scarce in Maui and Hawaii, a singular\r\ndistribution that may be due to the inflorescence being “often\r\nmonstrously deformed by oviposition of some dipterous insect.” The\r\nRarotongan species, according to Cheeseman, is common throughout the\r\nisland from the sea-level to the tops of the hills. In Vanua Levu I\r\nfound that these trees preferred the crests of wooded mountain-ridges or\r\nthe partially vegetated mountain peaks. They came under my notice in the\r\nforests of the island of Fauro, in the Solomon Group, associated with\r\nother large trees of the genera Canarium and Calophyllum.\r\n\r\nMuch interest is attached to the mode of dispersal of this genus, since\r\nin some species the size of the drupes and of the included “stone” is so\r\ngreat that, judged by those species only, it might be deemed impossible\r\nto attribute the existence of the genus in isolated oceanic groups to\r\nthe agency of frugivorous birds. We are, however, compelled to appeal to\r\nthe bird, since, as my experiments in Fiji indicate, the genus has\r\nlittle or no capacity for dispersal by currents, the “stone” when\r\ncontaining a seed always sinking, whilst the entire fruit either sinks\r\nat once or floats heavily for a few days.\r\n\r\nThe degree of fleshiness of the drupes of Elæocarpus varies in different\r\nspecies, being sometimes slight and at other times pronounced, but,\r\nspeaking generally, they would be expected to attract frugivorous birds.\r\nThe colour of the fruits of some species is dark and purplish, whilst in\r\nothers it is a bright blue. In the last case the fruits are very\r\nconspicuous and sappy. A Solomon Island species collected by me and a\r\nMalayan species observed by Ridley had bright blue fruits, and Cheeseman\r\nrefers to the Rarotongan species as possessing fruits of this hue. Their\r\ncolour, therefore, would often aid in attracting birds, and we are not\r\nsurprised to learn that they form a favourite food with fruit-pigeons,\r\nparrots, and other frugivorous birds in different regions. Amongst the\r\nfruits found by Professor Moseley in the crops of fruit-pigeons in the\r\nAdmiralty Islands were those of Elæocarpus; whilst in the Solomon\r\nIslands I noticed that the blue fruits of the “Toa,” a species of the\r\ngenus, were a favourite food of the same birds (_Bot. Chall. Exped_.,\r\niv. 307, 308; Guppy’s _Solomon Islands_, 293, 295). We learn also from\r\nHochstetter and from Sir W. Buller that the drupes of the “Hinau”\r\n(Elæocarpus) form a favourite food of the parrots and fruit-pigeons of\r\nNew Zealand (Hochstetter’s _New Zealand_; Buller’s _Birds of New\r\nZealand_).\r\n\r\nThe question of size acquires considerable importance when we come to\r\nconsider the transport of the seeds of the genus to a group of islands\r\nlying, like Hawaii, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. The protection\r\nof the seed is also another important matter. There can, however, be no\r\ndoubt that the hard woody or often osseous “stone” sufficiently protects\r\nthe seed. With regard to size, if we were to judge from the dimensions\r\nof the fruits of some of the Fijian species, where, as I found, the\r\n“stone” measures from 3 to 5 centimetres (1-1/4 to 2 inches) in length,\r\nwe might be led to form a very erroneous opinion of the capacity of the\r\ngenus for conveyance through the agency of frugivorous birds to Hawaii.\r\nBut when we turn to the Hawaiian species we find the difficulty much\r\ndiminished, though still serious, the fruits being smaller and\r\npossessing a “stone” 2-1/2 centimetres or about an inch long. In other\r\nregions, however, the genus may possess fruits yet smaller in size. The\r\nTongan endemic species, as described by Burkill, has fruits 1·7 cm. or\r\n7/10 of an inch in length; and closely similar dimensions are given by\r\nKirk for a New Zealand species. In both these cases the “stone” would\r\nnot be more than half an inch or 1·2 cm. in length, and this would also\r\napply to the Solomon Island species above mentioned. In another New\r\nZealand species, where the drupe is only half an inch, the “stone” would\r\nbe still smaller. It is thus evident that the fruits of different\r\nspecies vary greatly in size in different regions, and that there is no\r\ndifficulty in assuming that a small-fruited species could be dispersed\r\nover the Pacific by frugivorous birds, and carried either to Hawaii or\r\nNew Zealand.\r\n\r\nIt might be an interesting point to determine to what extent a species\r\nin an oceanic island could effect its own isolation by developing a\r\n“stone” too large and too heavy to be transported across an ocean by\r\nbirds, such as seems to have happened with some Fijian species. But a\r\nsimilar curious question is raised by the deterioration of a drupe in\r\nits capacity for dispersal by frugivorous birds, when, as in the case of\r\nthe Hawaiian species of Elæocarpus, the drupes become dry and almost\r\nsapless. As remarked in Note 68, this same feature is to be noticed in\r\nthe fruits of some of the Hawaiian endemic genera. This, of course,\r\nwould be quite in accord with what we should expect from the standpoint\r\nof dispersal.\r\n\r\nI will conclude these remarks on Elæocarpus with a reference to the\r\nsimilarity of its distribution with that of Freycinetia. Both genera are\r\nat home in the temperate rain-forests of New Zealand and in the tropical\r\nrain-forests of the Pacific islands and of Malaya. Their capacities for\r\ndispersal are so different and so unequal, the dispersal of Freycinetia\r\nbeing seemingly so much more readily effected, that we can only suppose\r\nthat time has long since discounted any special advantage one genus\r\npossesses over the other as regards distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         DODONÆA (Sapindaceæ).\r\n\r\nThis genus of small trees and shrubs includes between fifty and sixty\r\nknown species, of which about forty are confined to Australia; but a few\r\nspecies are found over the tropical and subtropical regions of the\r\nworld, extending sometimes into temperate latitudes. There are, it\r\nseems, only three species known from the oceanic groups of the tropical\r\nPacific: one, the cosmopolitan Dodonæa viscosa, that occurs in every\r\nisland of volcanic formation; and two others associated with it in the\r\nHawaiian Group, to which they are restricted. We have thus repeated in\r\nthis genus what is true of several other genera in Hawaii, such as\r\nMetrosideros and Wikstrœmia, namely, the occurrence in that group of a\r\nwidely-ranging species accompanied by other species peculiar to those\r\nislands. In the case of Dodonæa in Hawaii we should not expect to find\r\nit very difficult to connect the endemic species with the widely-ranging\r\nD. viscosa, which is a very variable species. The extreme forms in\r\ndifferent parts of the world are so different in character that Bentham\r\nviewed this species as probably including the whole of the\r\nextra-Australian species, excepting perhaps the Hawaiian endemic species\r\nand one or two South African and Mexican plants (_Bot. Chall. Exped._,\r\niii. 136).\r\n\r\nOf the two Hawaiian peculiar species, one, Dodonæa eriocarpa, is a\r\nmountain shrub found in most of the large islands and occurring\r\nsometimes at elevations of 6,000 to 8,000 feet. The other species, D.\r\nstenoptera, is, according to Hillebrand, a very distinct species found\r\nonly on Molokai. Bentham was only acquainted with the first-named, and\r\nhis hesitation to include it as one of the innumerable forms of the\r\nwidely-ranging D. viscosa is very suggestive. However, whether or not\r\none or both of these peculiar forms are connected in their origin with\r\nthis species, it is certain that the genus has been established for ages\r\nin Hawaii; and from D. viscosa we can learn how a species of the genus\r\ncan cross an ocean, and also how from a widely-ranging species\r\nexhibiting extreme variability species peculiar to a group of islands\r\ncould have been derived.\r\n\r\nThe great variability of Dodonæa viscosa is associated with great\r\nadaptability to different stations. Thus, as Mr. Hemsley tersely puts\r\nit, it is one of those plants that thrive on the sea-coast as well as\r\ninland, and in almost any soil or situation—provided, it may be added,\r\nthat the station is well exposed to the sun. Although Mr. Ridley\r\ncharacterises it as a regular sea-shore plant in the Malay peninsula,\r\nand although Prof. Schimper places it in the Indo-Malayan strand-flora,\r\nit is as an inland plant that it is most characteristic of the Pacific\r\nislands; and the key to its powers of adaptation to different stations\r\nis to be found in its xerophilous habit. It is essentially a plant of\r\nsunny places, and is equally at home on the parched inland plain, in the\r\nopen wood, on the sandy beach, on an old lava-field, or on rocky\r\ndeclivities. It is not a plant of the rain-forest, preferring dryness to\r\nhumidity and sunshine to shade.\r\n\r\nThe following remarks on the mode of dispersal of the wide-ranging\r\nDodonæa viscosa will serve to roughly indicate the capacity of the genus\r\nfor distribution. It is a subject, however, that requires further\r\ndetailed investigation. The light, inflated, winged capsules of this\r\nspecies, about an inch across, could be blown for long distances along\r\nthe ground and carried for short distances in the air by strong winds,\r\nbut, as is also remarked by Prof. Schimper (_Ind. Mal. Strand-flora_, p.\r\n157), they are much too large to be transported by winds across a broad\r\ntract of sea. The currents, however, may have aided in the dispersal of\r\nthe species in the case of island-groups 500 or 600 miles apart.\r\nAlthough the membranous capsules before dehiscing would be unable to\r\nwithstand the “rough-and-tumble” of ocean-transport for more than a few\r\ndays, the seeds possess some floating powers of a purely accidental\r\nnature due to the imperfect filling up of the seed-cavity in some of the\r\nseeds. In an experiment made in Hawaii I found that only half the seeds\r\nfloated in sea-water. Prof. Schimper, in an experiment conducted in\r\nGermany with seeds that must have been well dried by keeping, found that\r\nthey floated for from ten to sixty days. This limited capacity for\r\nflotation might possibly allow the species to reach Tahiti by easy\r\nstages from Fiji; but it is not sufficient to explain its occurrence in\r\nthe more isolated Hawaiian Group. The fruits and seeds of this plant\r\nnever, however, came under my notice in the floating or stranded\r\nseed-drift of Fiji; and I am not inclined, for this and the reasons\r\nabove mentioned, to consider that the currents have been very effective\r\nagents in dispersing this plant over the Pacific islands.\r\n\r\nHillebrand endeavoured to account for the wide distribution of Dodonæa\r\nviscosa by “the glutinous capsules which would easily adhere to the\r\nplumage of birds.” It may be here remarked that in the dried state\r\nspecimens of the plant have a varnished appearance as respecting the\r\nleaves, branchlets, and capsules. In the living condition this is\r\nrepresented by a glutinous or viscid condition of the surface of these\r\nportions of the plant, rendering them adhesive to the touch. I found,\r\nhowever, that only the immature capsules are markedly “sticky,” and that\r\nin any case the adhesive power was quite insufficient to allow of\r\nadherence for any length of time of fruits of this size to a bird’s\r\nfeathers. Mr. Ridley, who allows much latitude to birds in matters of\r\ndispersal, remarks that the stickiness only appears when the specimen is\r\ndry (_Trans. Linn. Soc. Bot._, 1888-94, p. 289). It is, nevertheless,\r\nlikely that the crustaceous seeds, which do not exceed 1/5 of an inch (5\r\nmm.) in size, when swallowed by a bird granivorous in its diet, might be\r\nvoided unharmed, and the dispersal of the species assured. It is in this\r\nfashion, I imagine, that the plant reached distant groups like Tahiti\r\nand Hawaii.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, the possibility that man has in past times aided in\r\nthe distribution of Dodonæa viscosa over the warmer regions of the\r\nglobe. But such an agency seems largely discounted in the case of an\r\nisolated archipelago like Hawaii by the occurrence of endemic species.\r\nNor does the usual station in the Pacific islands support the view that\r\nit was introduced by the aborigines. According to Hillebrand, it\r\npossesses a variety (var. spathulata) in Hawaii which seems also to\r\noccur in Tahiti and New Zealand. Nadeaud observes that in Tahiti it\r\ngrows as a bush on dry crests, and as a small tree, ten feet in height,\r\nin the mountains.\r\n\r\nNor do the aboriginal names of Dodonæa viscosa point in the direction of\r\nman’s agency. It possesses a different name in every group, and is\r\nevidently not a plant with which the ancestors of the Polynesians were\r\nfamiliar in the home of the race. Thus it is named “aalii” in Hawaii,\r\n“apiri” in Tahiti, “ake” in Rarotonga, “lala vao” in Samoa, and I may\r\nadd “usi” or, as Seemann writes it, “wase” in Fiji.\r\n\r\nLooking at these various facts, I am not inclined to exclude altogether\r\nany one of the three agencies above discussed; but I should imagine\r\nthat, placed in their order of effectiveness, we should have first\r\nbirds, then the currents, and lastly man.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        METROSIDEROS (Myrtaceæ)\r\n\r\nWhilst this genus of trees and shrubs has its home in New Zealand and\r\nAustralia, there is an extremely variable Polynesian species,\r\nMetrosideros polymorpha, ranging over all the volcanic groups of the\r\ntropical Pacific, from Fiji to Pitcairn Island and from Hawaii to the\r\nKermadec group, but seemingly only in the Hawaiian group associated with\r\nendemic species. According to the _Index Kewensis_ the genus comprises\r\nabout forty known species, of which two-thirds are confined to New\r\nZealand and Australia in equal proportions; whilst, among the rest, six\r\nspecies belong to New Caledonia, two to Hawaii, and three to Malaya, and\r\nthere are solitary species in Chile, Madagascar, and South Africa.\r\n\r\nI will attack the problem connected with the distribution of the genus\r\nthrough the widely-ranging Polynesian species, Metrosideros polymorpha.\r\n“This genus,” wrote Dr. Seemann, “is in a fair way of becoming in\r\nPolynesia what Rubus is in Europe. It is very much given to variation,\r\nand it is very difficult to find out the limits of the different\r\nspecies.” In making these remarks he had this species in view, and his\r\nadoption of Gaudichaud’s specific name of “polymorpha” to cover almost\r\nall the Polynesian forms has been generally followed. Although so widely\r\ndistributed over the Pacific, it is in the Hawaiian Islands that this\r\ntree attains its greatest development, growing gregariously and often\r\nforming almost exclusively entire forests; and it is here that it\r\ndisplays the greatest variation. But it was remarked by Seemann, and\r\nthis was confirmed by Hillebrand, that almost all the Hawaiian forms\r\noccur in the Society or Tahitian Islands.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the great variability of Metrosideros polymorpha must\r\nbe considered its variety of stations and its great range in altitude.\r\nHillebrand describes seven Hawaiian forms of this species, and their\r\nvarious stations and characters are well illustrated in his\r\ndescriptions. Thus, whilst the trees may attain a height of forty feet\r\nin the forests, in elevated exposed situations they may be small and\r\ngnarled or low and shrubby; whilst in the bogs and swamps of the high\r\nlevels of Maui and Kauai the plant grows as a prostrate shrub. It is not\r\nat all unlikely that the two peculiar Hawaiian species of the genus had\r\na common origin from a widely-ranging species, which, if not the present\r\nM. polymorpha, was its immediate ancestor. One of them was, indeed,\r\nincluded by Dr. Seemann within the wide limits of this species, and the\r\nother was accepted with a doubt.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the great vertical range in the Hawaiian Group of\r\nMetrosideros polymorpha, I will take it as I found it in the island of\r\nHawaii. Here it ranges from the coast up to about 8,000 feet above the\r\nsea. But it is in the middle forest-zone at elevations of 2,000 to 4,000\r\nfeet, where it is often associated with the Koa and Olapa Trees (Acacia\r\nkoa and Cheirodendron Gaudichaudii), that it is most at home and attains\r\nits greatest size. Higher up at heights of 5,000 to 7,000 feet in the\r\nmore open forests it is still in the company of the trees just named\r\ntogether with Sophora chrysophylla and Myoporum sandwicense. At 8,000\r\nfeet it becomes very stunted and is accompanied usually by bushes of\r\nCyathodes and other plants of similar bushy growth. In the lower parts\r\nof its range, from 2,000 down to 1,000 feet, it forms forests with the\r\nKukui Tree (Aleurites moluccana), mingled also with smaller trees such\r\nas the Hawaiian Olive (Osmanthus), and the Kopiko (Straussia). Below\r\n1,000 feet, and wherever bold promontories reach the coast and the\r\ninland forest descends to the sea, we find it associated with such trees\r\nand shrubs as the Lama (Maba sandwicensis) and different Akeas\r\n(Wikstrœmia). On the partially vegetated surfaces of old lava-flows near\r\nthe coast it grows beside bushes of the Ulei (Osteomeles\r\nanthyllidifolia) and of Cyathodes.\r\n\r\nCompared with its behaviour in Hawaii, Metrosideros polymorpha takes a\r\nrelatively unimportant part in the vegetation of Fiji. As Horne\r\nobserves, the trees are most common in the dry parts of the two largest\r\nislands and grow in the poorest soil. I found them in Vanua Levu usually\r\nin open exposed situations, generally in the dry “talasinga” plains on\r\nthe north side of the island, where they were associated with Acacia\r\nRichii, Dodonæa viscosa, and Casuarinas; and sometimes they occurred in\r\na shrubby form on the rocky peaks of the highest mountains. In Rarotonga\r\nalso, as we learn from Cheeseman, it is on the tops of the rocky peaks\r\nand along the crests of the ridges that this species, which is abundant\r\nin the island, is frequently found.\r\n\r\nI may here allude to the curious fact observed by me on the upper open\r\nwooded slopes of Mauna Kea at elevations of 6,000 to 7,000 feet, and\r\ntherefore on the outskirts of the true forest-zone. Here the Ohia Tree,\r\nas the Hawaiians name Metrosideros polymorpha, often grows in close\r\nassociation with the Olapa Tree (Cheirodendron Gaudichaudii). In one\r\nlocality, for instance, a large Olapa was growing in the fork of an Ohia\r\nat about eight feet from the ground, and sending down roots on either\r\nside. Sometimes the trunks of the Olapa and the Ohia were to be seen\r\ngrowing in such close contact as to look like one tree. In one such case\r\na young tree, four feet high, of Myoporum sandwicense was growing in a\r\nfork of the Ohia, whilst in a fork of the Olapa a plant of Vaccinium\r\npenduliflorum, three or four feet in height, had established itself.\r\nThis remarkable instance of epiphytic growth also proved to be quite a\r\nrevelation with regard to the dispersal of seeds in this island. Amongst\r\nthese four associated plants, which include three trees and one shrub,\r\nall except the Ohia, which was probably the original tree, have fruits\r\nthat would attract frugivorous birds; and in succession these birds had\r\nfirst dropped a pyrene of the Olapa in the fork of the Ohia, and\r\nafterwards the seeds of Myoporum again on the Ohia, whilst finally the\r\nVaccinium seeds were dropped into the fork of the Olapa after it had\r\ndeveloped into a tree.\r\n\r\nThe mode of dispersal of the seeds of Metrosideros polymorpha now\r\ninvites our attention. Since the fruits are dry, dehiscent capsules\r\npossessing minute fusiform seeds, we are not able to appeal directly to\r\nthe agency of frugivorous birds to explain the wide dispersal of this\r\nspecies. The seeds are light in weight and remind one a little of those\r\nof the succulent fruits of Freycinetia. For purposes of dispersal,\r\nhowever, they must be placed in the same category with other plants with\r\ndry, dehiscent fruits and small seeds, such as the Vota (Geissois\r\nternata) of Fiji, a tree that in those islands grows in similar\r\nstations. On a later page I have suggested that the seeds of the Vota\r\nare dispersed by large bats that visit the trees for the sake of the\r\nhoney in the red flowers. With Metrosideros polymorpha birds act\r\nprobably in the same way. We are, in fact, informed by Mr. Perkins that\r\nthe nectar-feeding birds of the Hawaiian Drepanids now obtain their main\r\nsupply of this food from the blossoms of this tree. If bats or birds\r\nvisit the large red flowers of Metrosideros polymorpha for the same\r\npurpose, it is not difficult to imagine that they might carry away in\r\ntheir fur or in their plumage some of the small seeds shaken out of old\r\ndehiscent capsules. In this connection we may note that the Kaka Parrot\r\n(Nestor meridionalis) of New Zealand is said to feed largely on the\r\nscarlet blossoms and nectar of Metrosideros robusta (Evans’ _Birds_, p.\r\n374).\r\n\r\nThe seeds of Metrosideros polymorpha might no doubt be carried by winds\r\nfrom one mountain-top to another and across narrow straits, but only\r\nwhilst adherent to a bat or a bird could they be carried across a wide\r\ntract of ocean. Speaking of the genera Metrosideros and Lobelia in\r\nconnection with their occurrence in the Kermadec Islands, Sir J. Hooker\r\nlong ago referred to their minute seeds as not adapted for transport\r\nacross oceans unless their minuteness and number fitted them for it\r\n(_Journ. Linn. Soc._, i. 127). The point that is raised here for these\r\ngenera in the Kermadec Group can be raised for the same two genera in\r\nHawaii and for a multitude of other small-seeded genera in those\r\nislands.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ALYXIA (Apocynaceæ).\r\n\r\nThis genus of climbing or straggling shrubs tells its own story of the\r\nwidely dispersed Indo-Malayan genera in the Pacific islands. Containing\r\nabout forty known species, it is distributed over the tropical regions\r\nfrom Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands eastward to the Paumotu Group\r\nand Pitcairn Island in mid-Pacific, and has its focus in the area\r\ncomprised by Malaya, Australia, and New Caledonia. In the _Index\r\nKewensis_ about eight species are assigned to New Caledonia, seven to\r\nAustralia, and seven to Malaya. One species, Alyxia stellata, ranges\r\nover nearly the whole of the area of the genus from tropical Asia,\r\nthrough Malaya, across the South Pacific to Tahiti. It will be for the\r\nfuture investigator to determine how far the present distribution of the\r\ngenus can be connected with one or two widely-ranging polymorphous\r\nspecies. The data at my disposal seem to show that in the open Pacific,\r\nat all events, the history of the genus has gone a step beyond this\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nOf the seven or eight species recorded from the Pacific islands east of\r\nNew Caledonia, only two or three seem to be now recognised as restricted\r\nto particular groups, namely, one in Hawaii (Schumann), one in Fiji, and\r\none in Rarotonga. The other species indirectly connect together all the\r\ngroups, although no single species occurs over the whole region. Thus\r\nthe Hawaiian species, Alyxia olivæformis (Gaud.) has in recent years\r\nbeen found in Upolu, in the Samoan Group, by Dr. Reinecke, an\r\nexceedingly interesting though unusual specific link between these two\r\narchipelagoes. Two species, A. stellata and A. scandens, range over the\r\nSouth Pacific from Fiji to Tahiti, the last-named also occurring in the\r\nPaumotu or Low Archipelago; whilst Rarotonga possesses a form closely\r\nallied to the first-named, and to it Cheeseman has given specific rank.\r\nAnother species, A. bracteolosa, links together the contiguous Fijian,\r\nTongan, and Samoan groups. This distribution is what we should have\r\nexpected if one or two polymorphous species had originally ranged over\r\nthe Pacific and were advancing towards that stage of differentiation\r\nwhen each group possesses its own peculiar species. (It may be here\r\nremarked that an undetermined species of Alyxia is accredited by Maiden\r\nto Pitcairn Island, which indicates that the genus has extended east in\r\nthe Pacific almost as far as the extreme limit of the Polynesian\r\nregion.—_Australas. Assoc. Reports_, Melb., 1901, viii.)\r\n\r\nAll visitors to these islands that are interested in their floras will\r\nbe familiar with the Alyxias; and there are few of their plants that the\r\nnatives take more pleasure in pointing out to white men. They are\r\nreadily recognised on account of their black moniliform drupes and their\r\nmilky sap. All over Polynesia, whether in Hawaii, Tahiti, Samoa, or\r\nFiji, the aborigines value the plants on account of the delicate\r\nfragrance of their foliage and bark. These materials they use for\r\npersonal decoration and in making wreaths, stripping off the bark of the\r\nyoung branches with their teeth in the same fashion in Fiji and Hawaii\r\nand probably in all the Pacific islands. Throughout Polynesia, excluding\r\nFiji, they bear the same name, which takes the form of “maile” in Hawaii\r\nand Samoa, and of “maire” in Tahiti and Rarotonga—a name which the\r\nMaoris, remembering the Alyxias of their tropical home in the South\r\nPacific, have applied to New Zealand species of Olea and Eugenia. The\r\nFijian generic name for Alyxia is “vono.”\r\n\r\nA word may be said about the station of these plants in the Pacific\r\nislands. In Hawaii they occur in the middle and lower forests, and\r\nusually between 2,000 and 4,000 feet in elevation. In Tahiti they\r\nfrequent the crests and precipitous rocky slopes of the mountains at\r\nelevations of from 3,000 to over 6,000 feet. The Rarotongan species\r\noften forms extensive thickets in rocky localities on the hills. In\r\nSamoa they are found usually in the mountain forests. In Fiji they grow\r\non the outskirts of the virgin forests and on rocky sparingly vegetated\r\nmountain peaks. I found them often in Vanua Levu growing amongst the\r\nopen vegetation on the summits of isolated mountains at elevations of\r\n2,000 to 2,500 feet, where they were associated with other plants like\r\nElæocarpus, Pleiosmilax, and Scævola, possessing similar fleshy fruits\r\nlikely to be dispersed by frugivorous birds.\r\n\r\nThe Alyxias indeed seem well suited for dispersal by birds. The black\r\nfleshy drupes would readily attract them; and the solitary seed\r\nprotected by a very tough horny albumen might be ejected unharmed in\r\ntheir droppings.\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\nIt would be possible to enter into similar detail with several other\r\ngenera of this period; but here I can only direct attention to their\r\nprincipal indications, permitting myself a little more license when\r\ndiscussing the means of dispersal.\r\n\r\nALPHITONIA (Rhamnaceæ).—Amongst other genera with polymorphous species\r\nclosely following the lines taken by Metrosideros in the Pacific is\r\nAlphitonia, a small Malayan and Polynesian genus of tall trees,\r\ncontaining at most three or four species, one of which (A. excelsa) has\r\nalmost the range of the genus and is found in most of the Pacific\r\narchipelagoes. So variable is this widely-ranging tree that Bentham\r\nsuggested that there was only one species in the genus (_Bot. Chall.\r\nExped._, iii. 133), a suggestion especially interesting in connection\r\nwith the _rôle_ taken by polymorphous species in the Pacific. As bearing\r\non the mode of dispersal of this species, it may be observed that my\r\nFijian experiments show that the fruits are not fit for transport by\r\ncurrents. With the mature drupe the outer coverings become pulverulent,\r\nand the fruit breaks down, freeing the pyrenes which do not float; nor\r\nhave the seeds any buoyancy. Although the dry drupes would seem\r\nunattractive to birds, it is to birds we must look for the dispersal of\r\nthe genus.\r\n\r\nPISONIA (Nyctagineæ).—Like Dodonæa, Metrosideros, and Alphitonia, the\r\ncosmopolitan genus Pisonia possesses a polymorphous species that\r\ndisplays its variation in every Pacific group and occupies a\r\nconsiderable number of stations. The earlier botanists in the Pacific\r\ndiffered much as to the species of this region, and this led Mr. Hemsley\r\nto observe in his paper on the Tongan flora that it is difficult to\r\nunderstand the various Polynesian and Australian species except on the\r\nassumption that there is one very variable species. Recognising this\r\ndifficulty, Drake del Castillo deals somewhat summarily with nearly all\r\nthese forms, uniting them under one comprehensive species, P.\r\numbellifera (Seem.), thus constituting “une espèce très-polymorphe” that\r\nranges (generally in maritime districts) over tropical Asia and the\r\nislands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, extending to North-East\r\nAustralia and to New Zealand. On account of the unusual capacity for\r\ndispersal possessed by this species—a subject to be immediately\r\ndiscussed—the tendency to specific differentiation has been kept in\r\ncheck, though the process has gone farther in some groups than in\r\nothers, as in the case of Hawaii, where Hillebrand’s endemic species\r\nhas, however, been included by Drake del Castillo in his polymorphous\r\nspecies, P. umbellifera.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of this genus possess no capacity for dispersal by currents.\r\nThey never came under my notice either in floating or stranded\r\nseed-drift, and have little or no buoyancy. Prof. Schimper,\r\nexperimenting on the well-dried fruits of Pisonia aculeata, a seaside\r\nshrub common in America and in the Old World, and destined probably to\r\nbe brought by the systematist into touch with the polymorphous P.\r\numbellifera, found that they sank in a day or two (_Ind. Mal.\r\nStrand-flora_, p. 156). Dismissing the agency of the current, he looked\r\nto that of the bird for the explanation of the dispersal. The\r\nprobability of the effectiveness of this last-named agency has long been\r\nsurmised. It attracted the notice of Darwin and especially invited the\r\nattention of another student of plant-dispersal, Dr. H. O. Forbes. The\r\nlong, narrow, often fusiform fruits are invested by a somewhat\r\ncoriaceous perigone and range from less than an inch to three inches in\r\nlength (2-7·5 cm.). They excrete a very viscid fluid often in quantity,\r\nand sometimes also possess glandular spines. The Hawaiians, according to\r\nHillebrand, used this material as bird-lime for catching birds, and the\r\nfruits, he says, will stick fast to the paper in the herbarium for\r\nyears. In that group I often found the fruit adhering firmly to my\r\nclothes. Writing of these trees on Keeling Atoll, Forbes observes that\r\ntheir sticky fruits are often such a pest to birds roosting in their\r\nbranches that they have proved fatal to herons and boobies by collecting\r\nin their plumage. “It is easy to perceive,” he remarks, “how widely this\r\ntree might be disseminated by the birds that roost on it” (_The Eastern\r\nArchipelago_, p. 30). In New Zealand, as we learn from Kirk, the viscid\r\nfruits of Pisonia brunoniana attract small birds which become firmly\r\ncaught and die miserably. A cat has been known to wait under a tree\r\nwatching its opportunity of preying on the entangled birds. Sir W.\r\nBuller states that the New Zealand fruit-pigeon feeds at times on the\r\ngreen fruits of P. umbellifera; and we can infer that it occasionally\r\ncarries off some of the riper fruits in its feathers.\r\n\r\nWIKSTRŒMIA (Thymelæaceæ).—This is a small genus of shrubs and small\r\ntrees, with red or yellowish drupes fitted for dispersal by frugivorous\r\nbirds, that is confined mainly to tropical Asia, Australia, and\r\nPolynesia. Following Seemann and Drake del Castillo, we may say, that\r\nlike several other genera of this period, this genus possesses in the\r\ntropical Pacific a widely-ranging species, W. indica, that occurs in\r\nHawaii, the Marquesas, Tahiti, Samoa, and Fiji, growing amongst the\r\nvegetation immediately behind the beaches and in the plains and open\r\nwooded districts inland. In Hawaii it is associated with half a dozen\r\npeculiar species, and in Tonga there is also an endemic species. The\r\nwidely-ranging species has its home in the Indian Archipelago and in the\r\nAsiatic mainland, and occurs also in Australia. According to Gray, the\r\nAmerican botanist, it is represented by a different variety in almost\r\nevery group in the tropical Pacific, and it presents us therefore with\r\nanother example of a polymorphous species which links Polynesia directly\r\nwith Malaya. As bearing on the dispersal of the genus by birds, it may\r\nbe added that Mr. Perkins in the _Fauna Hawaiiensis_ speaks of some of\r\nthe Drepanids and of a species of Phaeornis as feeding at times on the\r\nfruits of these plants.\r\n\r\nPEPEROMIA (Piperaceæ).—All observers of tropical plant-life will be\r\nfamiliar with this genus of low herbs growing on tree-trunks, on the\r\nsoil, on rocks, and on stonewalls, and comprising about 500 known\r\nspecies distributed over the warmer regions of the globe and sometimes\r\nextending into cooler latitudes. In Polynesia it attains its greatest\r\ndevelopment in Hawaii, where Hillebrand enumerates about twenty species,\r\nof which, after excluding doubtful forms, at least a third must be\r\nendemic. Tahiti, Samoa, and Fiji are each known to possess three or four\r\nspecies, of which one is usually restricted to the group. Two species,\r\nP. reflexa and P. leptostachya, link together nearly all the groups of\r\nthe tropical Pacific, including Hawaii, the first cosmopolitan, and the\r\nsecond hailing from North-East Australia and indicating that the genus\r\nhas entered Polynesia from the west.... These plants possess spikes of\r\nsmall berries containing a single seed, and are evidently, like other\r\nPiperaceæ, dispersed by frugivorous birds. It is to be noted that the\r\npresence of a West Indian and Mexican species in the Bermudian caves is\r\nattributed by Mr. Hemsley to frugivorous birds (_Bot. Chall. Exped._,\r\nIntrod. 49, i. 62). In Vanua Levu they occur on the bare rocky peaks of\r\nsome of the mountains under such conditions that the seeds could only\r\nhave been brought by birds. Thus, on the bare surface of a large block\r\nof tuff forming the highest peak of Koro-Mbasanga, 2,500 feet above the\r\nsea, I found only two plants, Oxalis corniculata and a species of\r\nPeperomia.\r\n\r\nEUGENIA (Myrtaceæ).—This is a very extensive genus split up into\r\ndifferent subgenera, and comprising some 600 or 700 known species\r\nscattered over the warm regions of the globe. Their fleshy, usually red,\r\nberries contain as a rule one or two large seeds, and attract birds and\r\nanimals of all descriptions. The feature most interesting to us is the\r\ndispersal of the genus over the Pacific islands eastward to the Low\r\nArchipelago and northward to Hawaii. The track by which it has entered\r\nthe Pacific from the west is indicated in the distribution of the\r\nspecies. The genus is only well represented in the Western Pacific,\r\nwhilst eastward and northward of Samoa and Tonga the distribution is\r\nfitful and irregular, it being evident that the extension beyond these\r\ntwo groups has been accomplished with difficulty.\r\n\r\nThere are at least twenty-five species in Fiji, of which perhaps half\r\nwould be peculiar; in Tonga eight species, of which two may be endemic;\r\nin Samoa thirteen species, of which four are peculiar; in Rarotonga\r\nnone; in Tahiti a single non-endemic species; and in Hawaii two species,\r\nof which one is peculiar. Only truly indigenous species are here\r\nrecorded, and Eugenia malaccensis, which has accompanied the aborigines\r\nin their migrations, is not included. A solitary species, E. rariflora,\r\nconnects together all the principal archipelagoes from Fiji to Tahiti\r\nand the Gambier Islands, and northward to Hawaii. Nine species are known\r\nto be common to the region in which lie the three groups of Fiji, Tonga,\r\nand Samoa; and since some of these species occur in the groups further\r\nwest they may be regarded as keeping up the connection with the original\r\nhome of their ancestors in the Malayan region.\r\n\r\nLooking at these facts of distribution of the genus Eugenia in the open\r\nPacific, it is evident that whatever dispersal of the genus is now in\r\nprogress in this ocean is mainly confined to an interchange between the\r\ngroups of Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa in the Western Pacific, and doubtless\r\nbetween the islands further west of these groups. The smaller islands\r\nlying between and around these three groups participate in the\r\ndistribution of the species common to all. Thus Wallis Island, according\r\nto Drake del Castillo, possesses two of these species. Over the rest of\r\nthe ocean the dispersal of the genus seems to be no longer effective,\r\nsince Eugenia rariflora, which links together Fiji, Tahiti, and Hawaii,\r\nshows signs of differentiation in nearly every group. In Hawaii, where\r\nit is very rare and is only recorded from two of the islands, it has\r\ndeveloped a small-leaved variety. In Tahiti it displays the same\r\nvariation; and Seemann observes that there are differences between the\r\nTahitian and Fijian species which may be almost specific in value. It\r\nwould also appear that both in Hawaii and Tahiti the fruits have become\r\nless attractive to birds, being described as “dryish” and “dry,” which\r\nis, as Dr. Seemann remarks, certainly not true of the Fijian plant.\r\n\r\nIn Fiji the Eugenias, as small trees and shrubs, find their home usually\r\non the banks of streams and rivers, on the outskirts of forests, and\r\noccasionally at the coast. One of them, E. richii (Gray), is a\r\ncharacteristic littoral tree in the group. A tree near it in character\r\nwas found by me of common occurrence in the interior of coral islets in\r\nthe Solomon Group (_Solomon Islands_, p. 297). E. rariflora occurs also\r\nin the interior of coral islets in Fiji and amongst the vegetation at\r\nthe back of the mangrove-swamps.\r\n\r\nComing to the mode of dispersal of the genus in the Pacific, I may\r\nremark that all the species, with the doubtful exception of the Fijian\r\nand Samoan Eugenia neurocalyx (the Lemba of Fiji), are wild trees and\r\nshrubs useless to man, but much appreciated by pigeons, pigs, &c., on\r\naccount of their fleshy fruits. Since exact observations on the\r\npossibility of their dispersal by currents seemed to be wanting, I made\r\nsome experiments in Fiji. Out of six species, which included E.\r\ncorynocarpa, rariflora, richii, and rivularis, the mature fruits of most\r\nspecies sank in sea-water in from seven to ten days. However, those of\r\nthe beach tree, E. richii, floated for a fortnight. The cause of sinking\r\nin all cases lay in the decay of the outer fleshy covering. As I have\r\nobserved in river and sea drift, fish bite at the floating fruits, and\r\nin this manner the seeds would soon be liberated and sink. The seeds of\r\nall the plants sank at once in my experiments except with one species,\r\nwhere the seed loosely filled its test and thus a floating-power of a\r\nfew days was acquired. Currents, it is apparent, could never account for\r\nthe dispersal of the genus over a broad extent of ocean, though in a few\r\ncases, as in that of the littoral tree above noted, it is quite possible\r\nthat the fruits could be successfully transported across a tract of sea\r\n200 or 300 miles in width.\r\n\r\nIt has long been known that fruit-pigeons are fond of the fruits of wild\r\nspecies of Eugenia, and I found the Solomon Islanders and the Fijians\r\nwell acquainted with the fact. The fruits of a tall Eugenia tree, near\r\nE. richii, common in the interior of the coral islets of Bougainville\r\nStraits in the Solomon Group, were found by me in quantities in the\r\ncrops of fruit-pigeons shot by Lieut. Heming and Lieut. Leeper on the\r\nislets (_Solomon Islands_, pp. 293, 297; _Bot. Chall. Exped._, Introd.\r\n46, iv. 312). Dr. Seemann remarks that in Fiji the red fruits of E.\r\nbrackenridgei are eaten by pigeons. The somewhat thin coverings of the\r\nseeds of this genus would seem to offer but a slight protection in a\r\nbird’s stomach, though in one species the test was almost crustaceous.\r\n\r\nMost species possessed only one or two large seeds in each fruit, though\r\nthis number may vary in the same individual. Thus, out of ten fruits of\r\nEugenia rariflora in Fiji, six had one seed, three had two seeds, and\r\none had three seeds. In the fruit of E. neurocalyx, however, the seeds\r\nrange from three to five.\r\n\r\nIt is the question of size that is of importance in considering the\r\npossibility of birds transporting the seeds over a broad tract of ocean.\r\nEugenia rariflora, the species found all over the Pacific, has seeds\r\nthat measure in the Fijian plant one-fourth to one-third of an inch (6\r\nto 8 mm.) across; and in Hawaii, according to Hillebrand, they would\r\nperhaps be rather smaller. In point of size there is less difficulty\r\nwith regard to the transport by birds across the ocean to Hawaii of the\r\nseeds of Eugenia rariflora than with the “stones” and seeds of some\r\nother genera, like Elæocarpus, Osmanthus, and Sideroxylon, that must\r\nhave been conveyed there by the same agency. The fruits of several of\r\nthe Fijian species are of the size of a large cherry; but it is\r\nnoteworthy that in those species like E. corynocarpa and E. neurocalyx,\r\nwhere the fruits are large and the seeds about an inch in size, the\r\nplants are confined to the Western Pacific only, namely, to the\r\nFiji-Samoa region.\r\n\r\nThere is therefore no difficulty, from the standpoint of size, in\r\naccounting for the distribution by birds of the widely-ranging Eugenia\r\nrariflora over Polynesia; but at first sight there seems to be a real\r\ndifficulty with regard to the protective coverings of the seed. Yet\r\nNature speaks with no hesitating voice in the matter. The West Indian\r\nand Florida species, E. monticola, regarded as indigenous in the\r\nBermudas, must have reached that group through the agency of birds that\r\ncarried its seeds over quite 800 or 900 miles of sea; and it may here be\r\nnoted that South Trinidad, lying some 600 miles off the coast of Brazil,\r\nand Rodriguez, distant about 330 miles from Mauritius, each possess\r\nspecies (_Bot. Chall. Exped._, Introd., 12, i. 32, ii. 128). If\r\nfruit-pigeons can transport Eugenia seeds across 600 or 800 miles of\r\nocean, there would be no difficulty in accounting for the stocking of\r\nthe Fijian, Tongan, and Samoan Islands with the genus from regions to\r\nthe west. But the occurrence of the genus in Hawaii seems to compel us\r\nto assume that the seeds have been carried in a bird’s stomach over\r\n1,500 to 2,000 miles of ocean. This difficulty, however, does not really\r\nexist. Eugenia rariflora, the Polynesian species found in Hawaii,\r\nfrequents, as before observed, coast districts and coral islets in Fiji,\r\nand if we suppose that the low islands of the Fanning and Phœnix Groups,\r\nlying between Hawaii and Samoa, have served as stepping-stones, a\r\ncapacity of crossing 1,000 miles of ocean would be alone required. This\r\nis not much in excess of the distance that must have been traversed by\r\nthe bird that first brought the seeds of Eugenia monticola to the\r\nBermudas.\r\n\r\nOther genera like Morinda and Scævola, possessing fleshy fruits\r\ndispersed by frugivorous birds, have been mentioned in different\r\nconnections in other parts of this work, and will not be further dealt\r\nwith here. But before concluding this chapter I will refer briefly to\r\none of the disquieting mysteries in the flora of the Pacific which is\r\npresented to us in the genus Gossypium. Three species are, or were,\r\ntruly indigenous in this region. One is Gossypium drynarioides, a small\r\nendemic tree found by Nelson, the companion of Captain Cook, in Hawaii,\r\nwhich was very rare in Hillebrand’s time, and is perhaps now extinct.\r\nThe second is G. tomentosum (Nuttall), which is also peculiar to Hawaii,\r\nwhere it is found on the beaches. I am following here the _Index\r\nKewensis_; but it should be remarked that this species occurs also in\r\nFiji, though Seemann regards it as introduced. The third is G.\r\nreligiosum (L.), found by Captain Cook’s botanists growing wild in\r\nTahiti, and hailing from the tropics of the Old World. The seeds of the\r\nfirst species are covered with a short brownish tomentum, and could\r\nnever have been of any value. The tawny wool of the seeds of the second\r\nspecies has a staple too short for cultivation; whilst the Tahitians do\r\nnot seem to have made any use of the third species. It is difficult to\r\ndraw any conclusion concerning the presence of these plants in the\r\nPacific islands at the time of their discovery; nor can Dr. Seemann, who\r\nwas especially well informed in these matters, aid us much in our\r\nendeavours to solve the mystery. From the aboriginal names we get no\r\nclue. The Hawaiian name of “huluhulu” seemingly refers to the hairy\r\ncovering of the seed; whilst the Tahitian “vavai” and “ovari” simulate\r\nthe Fijian “vauvau,” which is merely the reduplicated form of “vau” (the\r\nword in many shapes for Hibiscus tiliaceus in Malaya and Polynesia), and\r\nis applied by the Fijians to Hibiscus esculentus and to the introduced\r\nspecies of Gossypium.\r\n\r\nWhen in Hawaii I ascertained that neither the seeds of the littoral\r\nplant, Gossypium tomentosum, nor those of two cultivated species\r\npossessed any fitness for dispersal by the currents, the scraped seeds\r\nsinking at once, whilst when covered with the wool they floated only for\r\na few days.

The few genera that are still dispersed have no\r\npeculiar species in particular groups. The species which often range\r\nover all the groups, and retain as a rule their characters in most of\r\nthem, do not therefore display, except in a few cases, that extreme\r\nvariation which would give them a place in the ranks of the polymorphous\r\nspecies. The dispersing agencies, in fact, are sufficiently active to\r\ncheck marked variations, and the process of isolation has scarcely\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nWe perceive the reason of this when we look at the nine genera which are\r\ntaken as samples of this period, viz., Rhus, Osteomeles, Viscum,\r\nPlectronia, Boerhaavia, Polygonum, Pipturus, Boehmeria, and Dianella,\r\nmost of them being known to be dispersed by birds at the present day.\r\nSix of the genera possess fruits likely to attract frugivorous birds;\r\nwhilst one of them, Boerhaavia, has sticky fruits that would be apt to\r\nadhere to plumage. Actual observations in the cases of Rhus, Viscum, and\r\nPlectronia establish the fact of their dispersal by fruit-eating birds;\r\nand there is no difficulty in postulating the same agency for\r\nOsteomeles, Pipturus, and Dianella. A method by which Boerhaavia fruits\r\nwould be transported in the plumage of birds has been observed by Mr.\r\nLister; whilst the nutlets of Polygonum are known to afford food to a\r\nvariety of birds and to be thus distributed.\r\n\r\nIn this period the plants all hail from the Asiatic side of the Pacific.\r\nThree of the genera, Plectronia, Pipturus, and Dianella, belong almost\r\nexclusively to the Old World. Five occur in both the Old and New Worlds,\r\nbut, as with Rhus, Viscum, Boerhaavia, and Boehmeria, are represented by\r\nOld World species in the Pacific, or, as with Polygonum, possess a\r\ncosmopolitan species (P. glabrum) ranging over the warm regions of the\r\nglobe. Even Osteomeles presents no exception to the rule, since the\r\nPacific plant is the only one of its species that is not American.\r\n\r\nWe have in Polygonum glabrum the only aquatic or semi-aquatic plant\r\nwidely distributed over the Pacific islands that can lay claim in all\r\ngroups to be indigenous. It is associated in Hawaii with species of\r\nPotamogeton and Naias, aquatic genera that have, however, a limited\r\ndistribution in Polynesia.\r\n\r\nI will now make a few remarks on each genus such as bear on their\r\ndistribution and on their mode of dispersal in the Pacific.\r\n\r\nRHUS (Anacardiaceæ).—The representation of this genus by indigenous\r\nspecies in oceanic islands not only in the Pacific but also in the\r\nAtlantic, as in the Bermudas, is of especial interest in connection with\r\ndispersal by frugivorous birds, since the drupes are typically dryish\r\nand might appear to be not very attractive to birds. There are two Old\r\nWorld species known from the Pacific islands: one being R. simarubæfolia\r\n(Gray), distributed over the South Pacific groups from Fiji to Tahiti\r\nand hailing from Malaya; the other, R. semialata (Murray), alone\r\nrecorded from the Hawaiian Group and derived probably from China or\r\nJapan. This indication that the groups of the North and South Pacific\r\nhave derived their species, the first from Temperate Asia and the second\r\nfrom Tropical Asia, is of some interest. In Samoa, according to\r\nReinecke, the fruits of R. simarubæfolia, which are of the size of a\r\npea, form the favourite food of the fruit-pigeons. That birds disperse\r\nthe seeds of the various Sumachs is familiarly known. In the United\r\nStates, as we learn from Barrows, Beal, and Weed, crows, woodpeckers,\r\nand other birds feed extensively in winter on the fruits of different\r\nspecies of Rhus, including the Poison Ivy (R. toxicodendron). The crows\r\ndischarge the seeds in pellets after retaining them for about thirty\r\nminutes. Some seeds we must infer would pass into the intestines, where\r\nthey might be retained for ten to twelve hours (see Chapter XXXIII.),\r\nwhich would be long enough, according to Gätke’s views of bird-velocity,\r\nto enable them to be transported over a thousand miles of ocean.\r\n\r\nOSTEOMELES (Rosaceæ).—One of the most interesting cases of dispersal in\r\nrecent times over the Pacific islands is that of O. anthyllidifolia. Of\r\nthe ten known species of the genus, nine are confined to South America;\r\nwhilst the Pacific species, which is not recorded from America, has been\r\nfound in Upper Burma, Japan, the Liukiu and Bonin Groups, Hawaii,\r\nPitcairn Island, Mangaia, and Rarotonga. The remarkable distribution of\r\nthe Pacific plant at once attracts attention. I was very familiar with\r\nit in Hawaii, where it forms one of the commonest bushes in open-wooded\r\nand thinly vegetated districts at elevations usually ranging from the\r\ncoast to 3,000 feet. Its small, white, somewhat fleshy fruits would\r\nattract birds, and the hard pyrenes would be able to pass unharmed\r\nthrough a bird’s digestive canal. It seems probable that, like Rhus\r\nsemialata, this plant entered the Pacific Ocean from the north-west,\r\ntaking the route by Japan and the Bonin Islands, and following the trend\r\nof the archipelagoes over Polynesia (see _Bot. Chall. Exped._, Introd.\r\np. 18; _Journ. Linn. Soc. Bot._, vol. 28, 1891, &c.).\r\n\r\nVISCUM (Loranthaceæ).—A single species, V. articulatum, which has its\r\nhome in Southern Asia, is found in most of the Pacific groups, such as\r\nHawaii, Marquesas, Tahiti, Rarotonga, Fiji, &c. The dispersal of the\r\ngenus by frugivorous birds is well known.\r\n\r\nPLECTRONIA (Rubiaceæ).—I have found it more convenient to place this\r\ngenus here, although there are probably one or two species peculiar to\r\nFiji. This genus of shrubs, which is spread over the warm regions of the\r\nOld World, is represented by two widely distributed species in\r\nPolynesia, Plectronia odorata (B. and H.) and P. barbata (B. and H.),\r\nthe first alone extending to Hawaii. I was very familiar with P. odorata\r\nin Hawaii and was much interested in its mode of dispersal, since the\r\nspecies has also been found in Fiji, Tahiti, the Marquesas, and Pitcairn\r\nIsland (Maiden). In one locality, where an old lava-field was partially\r\ncovered by its bushes then in fruit, the doves were feeding greedily on\r\nthe drupes, the “stones” of which, as well as the partially digested\r\nfruits, were to be seen in quantity in their excrement near a\r\nwater-hole. The stones are very hard and about a third of an inch (8\r\nmm.) in length, and are exceedingly well suited for transport by\r\nfrugivorous birds. It was very probably to one of these species of\r\nPlectronia that Peale alluded when he wrote of the berries of a species\r\nof Canthium forming the principal food, on one of the Paumotu Islands,\r\nof Numenius tahitensis, a curlew that has its home in Alaska, migrating\r\nsouth in autumn to Hawaii, Tahiti, and the Paumotu Group (Wilson’s AVES\r\nHAWAIIENSES).\r\n\r\nBOERHAAVIA (Nyctagineæ).—Two or three Asiatic species of this genus, B.\r\ndiffusa, B. tetranda, &c., are spread all over the Pacific islands from\r\nthe Fijis to the Paumotus and northward to Hawaii. Similar or allied\r\nspecies occur on the coral islands of the Indian Ocean, as on Diego\r\nGarcia and on Keeling Atoll. Though these plants have often been\r\naccidentally spread by man with his cultivated plants, it is probable\r\nthat sea-birds have regularly aided in their dispersal. The fruits, on\r\naccount of their small size and their glutinous sticky surfaces, are\r\nwell suited for transport in a bird’s feathers. Mr. Lister, as quoted by\r\nHedley (from _Proc. Zoolog. Soc._, 1891), made an interesting note in\r\nthis connection on one of the islands of the Phœnix Group, where he\r\nfound a fruit of Boerhaavia tetrandra entangled in some of the down that\r\nhad been preened by a booby (Sula piscatrix) out of its feathers whilst\r\nroosting in a clump of Tournefortia trees.\r\n\r\nPOLYGONUM (Polygonaceæ).—This genus is represented by the cosmopolitan\r\nPolygonum glabrum, the only aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that is\r\ngenerally distributed in the Pacific islands. It occurs in fresh-water\r\nswamps and beside streams and ponds in Tahiti, Tonga, Fiji, Hawaii, &c.,\r\nand was gathered by Banks and Solander when Captain Cook first visited\r\nTahiti. That this plant has been distributed by geese, ducks, and\r\nwaterfowl over the tropics of the globe can scarcely be doubted. In\r\nEngland I have found the nutlets of Polygonum convolvulus, P.\r\npersicaria, and P. aviculare in the stomachs of a wild duck and a\r\ncurlew; and they came frequently under my notice in the crops and\r\nintestines of different kinds of partridges and of wood-pigeons. Though\r\nmost of the fruits were generally injured, a few of them were not\r\nuncommonly obtained in a sound condition.\r\n\r\nPIPTURUS (Urticaceæ).—This is a genus of small trees and shrubs found in\r\nthe Mascarene Islands, Malaya, Australia, New Zealand, and throughout\r\nPolynesia. Besides P. albidus, which is confined to Hawaii and Tahiti,\r\nthere are two Malayan species, P. argenteus and P. velutinus, which are\r\nwidely distributed over the islands of the South Pacific, extending to\r\nTahiti and the Marquesas. The fleshy receptacle and small achenes of the\r\ncompound fruit of Pipturus give it the appearance of a white immature\r\nstrawberry, and as such it would be likely to attract frugivorous birds.\r\nPlants of this genus are included amongst the numerous plants from the\r\nbast of which the natives used to prepare their native cloth or from\r\nwhich they obtained the fibres for their fishing-lines.\r\n\r\nBŒHMERIA (Urticaceæ).—There is an Asiatic species widely spread in the\r\nSouth Pacific and another closely-allied species in Hawaii; but I\r\npossess no data relating to the dispersal of the genus. The fruits are\r\ndry and consist of an achene in a persistent perianth.\r\n\r\nDIANELLA (Liliaceæ).—This is a genus of herbs, possessing often pretty\r\nblue berries, that extends over tropical Africa, tropical Asia, the\r\nMascarene Islands, Malaya, Australia, and New Zealand, and is found in\r\nall the larger Pacific archipelagoes. Of the twelve species named in the\r\n_Index Kewensis_ only two belong to America, occurring respectively in\r\nCuba and Venezuela. There are two species in the islands of the tropical\r\nPacific: (_a_) Dianella ensifolia, found in Hawaii and ranging over the\r\nMascarene Islands, India, China, Malaya, and tropical Australia; and\r\n(_b_) D. intermedia, recorded from most of the groups of the South\r\nPacific (Fiji, Tonga, Rarotonga, Tahiti), and occurring also in Norfolk\r\nIsland and New Zealand. These two plants occur in similar stations all\r\nover Polynesia, sometimes growing in the grassy plains on the dry side\r\nof an island, at other times extending up the thinly wooded mountain\r\nslopes and reaching the hill-crests some 2,000 or 3,000 feet above the\r\nsea. Their berries would readily attract birds; and their seeds, about\r\none-fifth of an inch (5 mm.) in size in the case of D. ensifolia, could\r\nbe carried uninjured in the stomach and intestines of a bird.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Summary._\r\n\r\n(1) A later period in the era of the general dispersal of Malayan plants\r\nover the Pacific is indicated by the genera that contain species found\r\noutside each group as well as species restricted to it.\r\n\r\n(2) In this period the extremely variable or polymorphous species plays\r\na conspicuous part, as represented in such genera as Alphitonia,\r\nDodonæa, Metrosideros, Pisonia, and Wikstrœmia.\r\n\r\n(3) The first stage is displayed by a solitary widely-ranging species\r\nfound over most of the Polynesian archipelagoes, and varying\r\nindependently in every group.\r\n\r\n(4) The next stage is shown where the polymorphous species, having done\r\nits work of distributing the genus, ceases to wander and settles down\r\nand “differentiates” in all the groups; and the genus thus includes both\r\npeculiar and widely-ranging species in each group. Most of the genera\r\npossessing polymorphous species are in this stage.\r\n\r\n(5) The following stage is displayed by those genera like Elæocarpus,\r\nEugenia, and Peperomia, where peculiar species are especially developed\r\nin particular groups, and we get subcentres of distribution for the\r\ngenus, that is to say, small gatherings of peculiar species. A few\r\nspecies, however, still keep up a connection with neighbouring\r\nisland-groups. Should this be severed we get the type of genus belonging\r\nto the earlier period of the Malayan era as described in the preceding\r\nchapter, a genus possessing only peculiar species and destined, after\r\nages of further isolation through the failure of the dispersing\r\nagencies, to give rise to a new generic type or types.\r\n\r\n(6) Frugivorous birds were chiefly active in dispersing these genera\r\nover the Pacific. Some of the genera possess seeds or “stones” of such a\r\nsize that at first sight their transport by frugivorous birds to Hawaii\r\nseems improbable; but, as in the case of Elæocarpus, it is shown that\r\nthis difficulty does not apply to all species of a genus, some of them\r\nhaving much smaller seeds or stones.\r\n\r\n(7) The close of the era of the general dispersal of Malayan plants over\r\nthe Polynesian Islands is indicated by those genera that are represented\r\nmore or less entirely by widely ranging species. Though such species may\r\nvary among the different groups, they rarely take the rank of\r\npolymorphous species, the agencies of dispersal being sufficiently\r\nactive to check marked variations.\r\n\r\n(8) Several of the genera of this concluding stage, like Rhus, Viscum,\r\nand Plectronia, are known to be dispersed by frugivorous birds, whilst\r\nothers, like Osteomeles and Dianella, are equally well suited for this\r\nmode of dispersal.\r\n\r\n(9) Distinct indications are afforded by the genera Rhus, Osteomeles,\r\nand Dianella that the Hawaiian Group has been often supplied with its\r\nplants directly from the Old World by the Asiatic mainland, whilst the\r\ngroups of the South Pacific have received different species of the same\r\ngenus by Malaya and tropical Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n     THE MALAYAN ERA OF THE NON-ENDEMIC GENERA OF FLOWERING PLANTS\r\n                             (_continued_)\r\n\r\n                       THE AGE OF LOCAL DISPERSAL\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Synopsis of the Chapter._\r\n\r\nHAWAII.—(1) _The Hawaiian residual genera, being those not found in\r\n  either the Fijian or the Tahitian regions._ The genera especially\r\n  discussed are Osmanthus, Sicyos, Jacquemontia, Cuscuta, Rumex,\r\n  Dracæna, Naias, Potamogeton; and amongst others mentioned are\r\n  Perrottetia and Embelia.\r\n\r\n  (2) _The Hawaiian genera found in Tahiti and not in Fiji._ Very few,\r\n  and illustrated by Byronia, Reynoldsia or Trevesia, Phyllostegia, and\r\n  Pseudomorus, though it is likely that most of these will be\r\n  subsequently discovered in Fiji.\r\n\r\n  (3) _The Hawaiian genera found in Fiji and not in Tahiti._ Illustrated\r\n  by Eurya, Gouania, Maba, Sideroxylon, Antidesma, Pleiosmilax, Ruppia.\r\n\r\n  (4) _The absentees from Hawaii._ Illustrated amongst the orders by the\r\n  Sterculiaceæ (see text), the Meliaceæ, the Rhizophoreæ, the\r\n  Melastomaceæ, and the Coniferæ, and amongst the genera by\r\n  Trichospermum Loranthus, Stylocoryne, Ophiorrhiza, Alstonia, Hoya,\r\n  Ficus; and a great many others might be cited.\r\n\r\nTAHITI.—(1) _The Tahitian residual genera._ Only six in number—Cratæva,\r\n  Buettneria, Berrya, Coriaria, Bidens, Lepinia.\r\n\r\n  (2) _The Tahitian genera found in Hawaii and not in Fiji._ See above\r\n  under (2).\r\n\r\n  (3) _The Tahitian genera found in Fiji and not in Hawaii._ (a) Those\r\n  possessing only species confined to the Tahitian region or to East\r\n  Polynesia, of which Meryta, Ophiorrhiza, Alstonia, and Loranthus are\r\n  examples.\r\n\r\n  (b) Those possessing widely-ranging species besides, often, species\r\n  confined to the Tahitian region, such as Grewia, Nelitris, Melastoma,\r\n  Randia Geniostoma, Tabernæmontana, Fagræa, Bischoffia, Macaranga, and\r\n  Ficus. The widely-ranging species is in many genera polymorphous.\r\n\r\n  (4) _The absentees from Tahiti._ Amongst the orders are the Meliaceæ,\r\n  the Rhizophoreæ, and the Coniferæ. Amongst the genera, usually those\r\n  with “stones” or large seeds an inch in size, such as Canarium,\r\n  Dracontomelon, Myristica, Sterculia, Veitchia, &c. Numerous other\r\n  absent genera might be named.\r\n\r\nFIJI.—_The Fijian genera not found either in Tahiti or Hawaii._ These\r\n  genera compose about half the Fijian flora, being at least 160 in\r\n  number. Those especially discussed here are the following:—Hibbertia,\r\n  Cananga, Sterculia, Trichospermum, Micromelum, Canarium,\r\n  Dracontomelon, Begonia, Geissois, Dolicholobium, Lindenia, Myrmecodia,\r\n  Hydnophytum, Couthovia, Limnanthemum, Myristica, Elatostema,\r\n  Ceratophyllum, Gnetum, Veitchia, Rhaphidophora, Lemna, Wolffia,\r\n  Scirpodendron. The Coniferæ are dealt with in Chapter XXIV.\r\n\r\n                             --------------\r\n\r\nNote appended on Marsilea\r\n\r\n\r\nHAVING completed our discussion of the general dispersal of tropical\r\ngenera, chiefly Indo-Malayan, over the Pacific islands, we pass on now\r\nto consider the more restricted distribution of non-endemic genera over\r\nthis region. Here as before we take Hawaii, Tahiti, and Fiji as the\r\nthree centres of distribution; and here also we deal with the flowering\r\nplants after excluding the orchids, the sedges, the grasses, the\r\nmountain-plants, and all plants introduced either by the aborigines or\r\nby white men.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HAWAII.\r\n\r\nAfter excluding the endemic genera as well as those that are confined to\r\nthe mountains, we find that this group possesses very few genera that do\r\nnot occur in the Fijian and Tahitian regions, and fewer still that it\r\nowns in common with Tahiti to the exclusion of Fiji. On the other hand,\r\nwe observe that Fiji possesses a great number of genera, mostly Asiatic\r\nin origin, that have not reached Hawaii, and in several cases are not\r\nknown, from the Tahitian region. These contrasts might have been\r\nexpected, since the Pacific islands have in later ages been mainly\r\nstocked from the Asiatic side of the Pacific, the principal route lying\r\nthrough the Fijian region.\r\n\r\nAs far as the flora of the lower levels (below 4,000 feet) is concerned,\r\nHawaii only possesses a portion of that which Fiji has derived from the\r\nOld World, chiefly through Malaya. Although, as will be shown below,\r\nthere is a noticeable contribution from America, it is very far from\r\ncounterbalancing the loss which the Hawaiian flora has sustained in\r\ncomparison with Fiji through the isolated position of the group. The\r\nwant of variety, however, in the flora of the Hawaiian lower levels,\r\nwhich up to 4,000 or 5,000 feet represent the islands of the less\r\nelevated Fijian region, is in a small degree compensated for by the\r\ndevelopment of new genera and new species and by the great number of\r\nindividuals. Trees like Metrosideros polymorpha and Aleurites moluccana,\r\nthat in the southern groups form only one of many contributors to the\r\nforests, rise suddenly into prominence in the northern archipelago and\r\nform entire forests. Pandanus odoratissimus largely composes extensive\r\nforests in the province of Puna in the large island of Hawaii, extending\r\nseveral miles inland and nearly 2,000 feet up the mountain slopes.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable contrast between the Fijian flora, which is almost\r\nentirely tropical, and the Hawaiian flora, which on account of the great\r\nelevation of the islands is temperate as well as tropical, is brought\r\ninto yet greater prominence when we look at it more closely and treat it\r\nnumerically. The Hawaiian Group, it must be first observed, though\r\npossessing the same area as Fiji and presenting a far greater variety of\r\nclimatic conditions, has only two-thirds the number of genera of\r\nflowering plants (see Chapter XXI., Table B). Whilst at least 200 of the\r\nFijian genera of indigenous plants (excluding the orchids and the\r\ngrasses) are not found in Hawaii, only about 100 of the Hawaiian genera\r\nare absent from Fiji, and the two groups possess about 100 genera in\r\ncommon. When we look more closely at the hundred Hawaiian genera not\r\nfound in Fiji, we find that about sixty represent endemic genera\r\n(thirty-seven) and non-endemic mountain-genera (twenty-two), which\r\nnaturally are not to be found in Fiji, so that there remain but a small\r\nnumber of genera distinguishing the tropical flora of Hawaii from the\r\nFijian flora. When we take from them a few that occur in the Tahitian\r\nregion, there is left a very small residuum characteristic of Hawaii\r\nalone to the exclusion of the Fijian and Tahitian regions of the South\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE HAWAIIAN RESIDUAL GENERA.\r\n\r\nIt is my purpose now to deal in an illustrative fashion with this\r\nHawaiian residual flora which is composed, as above explained, of the\r\nnon-endemic tropical genera that are not represented in the Fijian and\r\nTahitian regions. Up to the present we have been dealing with the\r\ncharacters that the floras of Fiji, Tahiti, and Hawaii possess in common\r\nas far as tropical genera are concerned. We will now proceed to discuss\r\ntheir differences in this respect, and will begin with the residual\r\nHawaiian flora.\r\n\r\nAfter eliminating two or three genera that will probably be found in\r\nFiji, but including one or two others that are best treated under the\r\nendemic genera, about twenty-seven present themselves for our purpose.\r\nNearly all of them possess only endemic species, and belong therefore to\r\nan age of dispersal that has passed away. These residual genera plainly\r\nindicate that although Hawaii largely received its flora during the age\r\nof general dispersal of Old World genera over the Pacific, it was at the\r\nsame time independently stocked with plants from other sources. They\r\ninclude among others—Cocculus (4), Cleome (1), _Perrottetia_ (1),\r\nMezoneuron (1), _Lythrum_, _Sicyos_ (8), Peucedanum (2), Campylotheca\r\n(12), Senecio (2), Lobelia (5), Embelia (1), _Chrysophyllum_ (1),\r\nRauwolfia (1), _Nama_ (1), Osmanthus (1), _Jacquemontia_ (1), Breweria\r\n(1), Cuscuta (1), Lycium (1), _Sphacele_ (1), _Phytolacca_, Rumex (2),\r\n_Urera_ (2), Pilea, Dracæna (1), Naias, Potamogeton. Those printed in\r\nitalics are regarded as derived from America; whilst the figures in\r\nbrackets indicate the number of endemic species, nearly all of the\r\ngenera except the five above indicated possessing only peculiar species,\r\nand these five (Lythrum, Phytolacca, Pilea, Naias, Potamogeton) are only\r\nrepresented by species found outside the group.\r\n\r\nAmerican genera form a more conspicuous element than they do amongst the\r\ngenera that have been generally dispersed over the Pacific, those\r\nexclusively American being fairly represented, making a third of the\r\nwhole. We find, for instance, in the Hawaiian “Olomea,” Perrottetia\r\nsandwicensis, a small tree that represents in the woods of all the\r\nislands the Perrottetias of Mexico and the Andes; whilst with some of\r\nthose genera that, like Sicyos and Urera, are at home in both the Old\r\nand New Worlds, we obtain indications of America being the source of the\r\nHawaiian plants. A few genera again, like Lythrum and Phytolacca, are\r\nrepresented in Hawaii by American species.\r\n\r\nPlants with drupes, berries, or other fleshy fruits likely to attract\r\nfrugivorous birds compose about a third of the total number of these\r\nresidual genera, whilst fruits or seeds, that were in all probability\r\noriginally brought entangled in a bird’s feathers, are represented by\r\nSicyos. Some of the genera with stone fruits, such as Osmanthus, to\r\nwhich belongs the Hawaiian Olive, present special difficulties on\r\naccount of the size of the stone, in this case two-thirds of an inch in\r\nlength. There are also a number of genera with large dry fruits and\r\nsometimes large seeds, of which the method of dispersal is not easy to\r\ndiscover. Thus, Mezoneuron, a Leguminous genus with seeds an inch across\r\n(2·5 cm.), and Peucedanum, of the Umbelliferæ, with mericarps half to\r\nthree-quarters of an inch (1·2 to 1·8 cm.) in length, offer serious\r\ndifficulties to the student of plant-dispersal. In discussing the\r\ndifficulty connected with Mezoneuron (see Chapter XV.) he will keep in\r\nview the possibility that the original species may have been a littoral\r\nplant possessing seeds dispersed by the currents, seeds that lost their\r\nbuoyancy when the plant established itself inland, just as is now taking\r\nplace with Afzelia bijuga, a Leguminous littoral tree of Fiji (see\r\nChapter XVII.).\r\n\r\nHe will also find much to puzzle him in the mode of dispersal of the\r\nHawaiian residual genera of the Convolvulaceæ (Breweria, Jacquemontia,\r\nand Cuscuta) that possess only endemic species, and he will speculate as\r\nto the manner in which seeds that would seem to possess but little\r\nattraction for birds and have no capacity for transportation by the\r\ncurrents could ever have reached these islands, and he will ask himself\r\nwhy it is that the agencies of dispersal, whatever they are, have now\r\nceased to be active. He will perhaps see a way out of his difficulties\r\nwhen he perceives that if isolation has led to the development of\r\npeculiar species in Hawaii, it has strangely enough in the case of the\r\nMyrsinaceous genus Embelia produced the same effect over the whole range\r\nof the genus, and that Hawaii has in this respect derived no advantage\r\nfrom being an oceanic group. According to Carl Mez, nearly all the\r\nninety species of this Old World genus are restricted in their areas,\r\nwhether continental or insular (“Myrsinaceæ,” _Das Pflanzenreich_,\r\n1902); and indeed we do not seem justified in assuming that the\r\nisolating influences in the case of this genus have been more effective\r\nin Hawaii in the mid-Pacific, or in Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, than\r\nthey have been in continental regions like the Deccan and Nyassa Land,\r\nin all of which localities endemic species occur.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable development of the Cucurbitaceous genus Sicyos, in Hawaii\r\nalone of all the tropical Pacific groups, will attract his attention,\r\nand he will find here another instance of that predominant principle in\r\nthe distribution of Pacific plants, where in a widely-ranging genus we\r\nfind one of its species covering most of its area, whilst the other\r\nspecies are more or less localised. He will wonder at the limitation to\r\nHawaii of a genus like Dracæna, that is so well adapted for dispersal\r\nover the Pacific by frugivorous birds; and in endeavouring to explain\r\nthe presence in the Hawaiian forests of the gigantic Rumex, R.\r\ngiganteus, he will remember that the small group of Tristan da Cunha,\r\nequally isolated in the South Atlantic, possesses an endemic species of\r\nthe same genus. He will discover in the recognised dispersing agencies\r\nof wild ducks and other waterfowl an explanation of the occurrence in\r\nHawaii of the aquatic genera Naias and Potamogeton; but he will be\r\npuzzled at their restriction to this group alone of the three tropical\r\nPacific archipelagoes here especially discussed.\r\n\r\nAmidst these various perplexities he will probably look with relief on\r\nthe appearance of Phytolacca brachystachys, an endemic species of the\r\nAmerican “pokeweeds”; and he will feel grateful to the American\r\nbotanists like Professor Weed when they tell him that in the United\r\nStates crows, blackbirds, and other birds successfully disperse these\r\nplants, the seeds of which are sometimes able to pass through the\r\nalimentary canal undigested.\r\n\r\nBut by far the most significant lesson that the student of distribution\r\nwill carry away from his study of the Hawaiian residual genera will be\r\nthat which he learns from the genera Embelia and Naias. He perceives\r\nhere that not only with a typical land-genus has specific\r\ndifferentiation occurred to much the same extent in the continental and\r\ninsular localities of its range, but that even with a typical genus of\r\nsubmerged aquatic plants, where the conditions of existence are as\r\nuniform as they are varied in the case of land plants, the process of\r\ndifferentiation has proceeded on the same broad lines in the interior of\r\na continent and in an island in mid-ocean.\r\n\r\nThe following notes on some of the residual genera refer more\r\nparticularly to matters connected with distribution and dispersal.\r\n\r\n_Osmanthus_ (Oleaceæ).—This genus, according to the _Index Kewensis_,\r\ncontains six species localised in their several habitats of North\r\nAmerica, Hawaii, Japan (two), Hongkong, and the Himalayas. Its\r\nrepresentative in this group is the Hawaiian Olive, the Olea\r\nsandwicensis of Gray, a prevailing tree in the lower and middle woods\r\n(1,000 to 4,000 feet) of all the islands, which, like other Hawaiian\r\nplants, such as those of the genera Eurya and Antidesma, indicates that\r\nthe group has been sometimes independently stocked from the regions of\r\nthe northern hemisphere. The drupe of this tree contains a stone\r\ntwo-thirds of an inch (17 mm.) in length, and suitable for dispersal by\r\nfrugivorous birds; and birds have evidently distributed the tree all\r\nover the group. In fact Mr. Perkins in mentioning the favourite food of\r\nbirds of the Hawaiian genus, Phaeornis, refers to the fruits of this\r\ntree as well as of the Opiko (Straussia) and of the Olapa\r\n(Cheirodendron). When, however, we come to consider the feasibility of\r\nthe stones of the genus having been thus originally carried to Hawaii\r\neither from Japan or from North America, we meet with the difficulty\r\npresented to us by other Hawaiian genera with stone-fruits, such as\r\nElæocarpus, or with berries containing large seeds, such as Sideroxylon.\r\n\r\n_Sicyos_ (Cucurbitaceæ).—This genus comprises about thirty-five known\r\nspecies, of which three-fourths are confined to the New World, being\r\nmainly South American, whilst the remainder are restricted to Hawaii,\r\nwith the exception of two species in the Galapagos Group and Norfolk\r\nIsland, and a widely-ranging species, S. angulatus. The plant just\r\nnamed, the small fruits of which possess hooked spines, adapting them\r\nfor dispersal in a bird’s plumage, occurs in Africa, Australia, New\r\nZealand, and America, but has only been recorded in the Pacific islands\r\nfrom the Kermadec Group.\r\n\r\nNorth America was probably the home of the original Hawaiian species.\r\nHillebrand describes eight species, of which five are not found in more\r\nthan one island, whilst one species is spread over most of the islands.\r\nThe fruits vary much in size, and only in a couple of species do they\r\nnow possess any fitness for attaching themselves to plumage, some of\r\nthem being pubescent or even glabrate, so that deterioration in the\r\ncapacity for dispersal has here taken place. Their size is usually a\r\nquarter to half an inch (6-12 mm.); but it is noteworthy that the\r\nspecies with the largest fruit (Sicyos cucumerinus, one to two inches,\r\nor 25 to 50 mm.) is the species most widely dispersed over the group.\r\nThis appears to indicate that there is some other means of inter-island\r\ndispersal in this archipelago than by attachment to birds’ plumage. The\r\nisolation of the genus in Hawaii from the rest of the world is, however,\r\ncomplete, since all the species are endemic; and when, therefore, we\r\ncome to ask how Sicyos angulatus, that has been dispersed in the recent\r\nera over America, Australia, and New Zealand, is not found in these\r\nislands, we are brought face to face with the ever-recurring difficulty,\r\nthe suspension in later times of the agency of dispersal in the tropical\r\nNorth Pacific.\r\n\r\n_Jacquemontia_ (Convolvulaceæ).—This genus, which is chiefly American,\r\nis represented in Hawaii by a peculiar species, J. sandwicensis. This\r\nspecies grows occasionally on the sandy beaches associated with\r\nHeliotropium anomalum and Tribulus cistoides; but it is most at home on\r\nrocky ground and on old lava-flows near the sea-border, making its abode\r\noften in the pockets of black sand produced by the disintegration of the\r\nlava. Its small seeds sink in sea-water even after prolonged drying; and\r\nit can perhaps be supposed that the original seeds were brought from\r\nNorth America in the crevices of a drifting log. According to Ridley,\r\nFernando Noronha possesses a peculiar species also growing near the sea;\r\nand it may be that the drifting log has here been the agent also: but in\r\nneither case would this explanation account for the endemic character of\r\nthe species.\r\n\r\n_Cuscuta_ (Convolvulaceæ).—It would seem that with the exception of\r\nHawaii, where an endemic species, C. sandwichiana, occurs, no other\r\noceanic group in the globe possesses a peculiar species of the Dodders.\r\nWith the exception of an endemic species in New Zealand, and an\r\nintroduced species in Fiji which is found usually near the gardens of\r\nthe white residents on Viti Levu, the genus takes but little part in the\r\nPacific floras. The Hawaiian species is a characteristic beach-plant\r\ngrowing on Ipomœa pes capræ, Scævola Kœnigii, Tribulus cistoides, and on\r\nother plants that find a permanent or a temporary abode on the beaches.\r\nWe learn from Ridley and Moseley that Cuscuta americana in Fernando\r\nNoronha finds its host also in Ipomœa pes capræ. Since the seeds of the\r\nHawaiian plant and of the introduced Fijian species possess no buoyancy,\r\neven after drying for years, we cannot look to the agency of the current\r\nunless we call the drifting log to our assistance, and in that case the\r\nendemic character of the Hawaiian species would present the difficulty\r\nalready alluded to in the case of Jacquemontia. The seeds of the\r\nHawaiian plant are about one-twelfth of an inch (2 mm.) in diameter, and\r\nas far as size is concerned they might have been transported in a bird’s\r\nstomach; but, on account of the rapidity with which the seeds of the\r\ngenus absorb moisture and swell up, it is most unlikely that they would\r\nescape injury. This is one of the several difficulties in\r\nplant-dispersal which New Zealand and Hawaii share in common. Further\r\nremarks on the germination of the Hawaiian species are made in Note 69.\r\n\r\n_Rumex_ (Polygonaceæ).—Hawaii possesses two peculiar species of Rumex, a\r\ngenus not recorded from any other of the Polynesian groups. One of these\r\nspecies, R. giganteus, is a very remarkable plant, growing to a height\r\nof thirty or forty feet when supported by trees. It is noteworthy that\r\nthe small group of Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic possesses a\r\nspecies, R. frutescens, confined to those islands (_Bot. Chall. Exped._,\r\nii. 154). Both Hawaii and Tristan da Cunha lie in mid-ocean, cut off\r\nfrom the nearest continent by some 1,800 or 2,000 miles of sea; and we\r\nmay have to choose between the bird and the current in selecting the\r\nagency concerned with the transportation of the original seeds; or\r\nperhaps they have co-operated. Birds could disperse the nutlets of Rumex\r\nas readily as they do those of Polygonum, and I have found these fruits\r\nat times in the stomachs of partridges. On the other hand, Rumex fruits\r\noccur amongst the drift stranded on beaches in England and in\r\nScandinavia; and, as indicated by the observations of Sernander and\r\nmyself in these two localities, they float through the winter in ponds\r\nand rivers, germinating afloat in the spring. The nutlets sink, but they\r\nowe their buoyancy to the persistent perianth. In my sea-water\r\nexperiments the fruits of Rumex hydrolapathum and R. conglomeratum were\r\nstill afloat after from six to twelve months’ immersion, and their seeds\r\nsubsequently germinated. It is quite possible, therefore, that currents\r\ncan carry these fruits unharmed to oceanic island-groups like Hawaii and\r\nTristan da Cunha.\r\n\r\n_Dracæna_ (Liliaceæ).—This Old World genus, which on account of its\r\nberries is eminently suited for dispersal by frugivorous birds, is\r\nrepresented in Polynesia by a solitary species (D. aurea) peculiar to\r\nthe Hawaiian Group. Attaining a height of twenty to twenty-five feet, it\r\noften forms a striking feature in the vegetation of the open wooded\r\nregions up to altitudes of 3,000 feet. I found it growing in abundance\r\nin the large island of Hawaii between Waimanu and Waipio, and on the\r\nnorthern slopes of Hualalai. It grows in a variety of stations, and I\r\ncame upon it once in the broken-down caverns of an old lava-flow that\r\nwere frequented by pigeons which no doubt brought the seeds. Its\r\nconspicuous yellow berries have hard rounded seeds a quarter of an inch\r\n(6 mm.) across and weighing two to three grains when dry, which would\r\nprobably withstand injury in a bird’s stomach, the minute embryo being\r\nprotected by a very tough albumen. Neither the entire berry nor the seed\r\ncould be transported by currents, the last sinking even after drying for\r\nsix years.\r\n\r\n_Naias_ (Naiadaceæ).—If we except New Caledonia, where two or three\r\nspecies have been found, Hawaii is the only island-group in the tropical\r\nPacific from which this interesting world-ranging genus of submerged\r\naquatic plants has been recorded. Chamisso, the celebrated naturalist of\r\nKotzebue’s expedition, collected Naias marina in Oahu in the early part\r\nof last century; but apparently it did not come under Hillebrand’s\r\nobservation in the group. However, in 1897 I found it in another\r\nlocality, namely, just within the mouth of the Waipio, a river on the\r\nnorth-west side of the island of Hawaii. The mature fruits of this genus\r\nhave never been experimented on by me; but there is nothing in the\r\nstructure of the fruits to indicate that they have any buoyancy, or to\r\nshow that they differ in this respect from the fruits of other\r\ncompletely submerged aquatic plants like Ceratophyllum, Ruppia, and some\r\nof the Potamogetons. It is to ducks and other waterfowl that we must\r\nattribute the dispersal of this and the other genera just mentioned over\r\nwide tracts of ocean, a subject dealt with in discussing those plants.\r\n\r\nThe Hawaiian Group probably represents the most isolated locality\r\noccupied by this genus, since none of the other islands from which\r\nspecies have been recorded, such as New Caledonia, Mauritius, and\r\nBourbon, are so far removed from continental regions. The source of the\r\nHawaiian form of Naias marina lies evidently on the Asiatic side of the\r\nPacific, since it is referred by Mr. Rendle to the variety\r\n“angustifolia,” an Asiatic plant found also in the island of Bourbon and\r\nin West Australia, but not recorded from the New World. The important\r\nlittle monograph of the genus by Mr. Rendle (“Naiadaceæ,” in Engler’s\r\n_Das Pflanzenreich_, 1901) is full of suggestiveness for the student of\r\nplant-distribution. His interest is excited when he discovers that one\r\nof the most typical genera of aquatic plants displays the same principle\r\nof differentiation at work that is so well illustrated by many of the\r\nland genera of the Pacific islands. I refer to the principle implied in\r\nthe existence of a widely-ranging genus comprising “a polymorphic\r\nspecies occurring over almost the whole area of the genus,” as well as a\r\nnumber of less widely distributed species, most of which have\r\n“restricted areas and fall for the most part into small geographical\r\ngroups.” I have just been quoting Mr. Rendle’s description of the\r\ndistribution of Naias, the “polymorphic” species concerned being N.\r\nmarina; but it need scarcely be remarked that it would apply just as\r\nwell to several of the land genera dealt with in the previous chapter\r\n(XXVI.), such as Alphitonia, Metrosideros, Pisonia, &c.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is such a contrast in the degree of uniformity of their\r\nlife-conditions between land and water plants, a strictly aquatic plant\r\nbeing but slightly affected by changes in the physical conditions that\r\nare accompanied by a complete transformation in the character of the\r\nterrestrial vegetation, yet—and this is the important point—we find the\r\nsame principle of differentiation at work with both land and water\r\nplants. If one wished to produce proof of the contention that the\r\nproduction of new species is largely independent of external conditions,\r\none could not do better than take the cases of Elæocarpus, Metrosideros,\r\nand Naias. In all cases we see a widely-ranging polymorphous species\r\nsettling down and “differentiating” in particular localities or regions,\r\nand forming subcentres for the distribution of the genus.\r\n\r\n_Potamogeton_ (Potameæ).—Though well suited for dispersal by waterfowl,\r\nthe Potamogetons have been recorded from the Hawaiian and Marianne\r\nIslands alone among the tropical groups of the open Pacific. The genus,\r\nthough not so well represented in insular floras as we might have\r\nexpected, is still not infrequently to be found. Widely-ranging species\r\nhave been observed in the Azores, Madeira, and the Canaries in the\r\nAtlantic, as well as in Hawaii in the Pacific; whilst species have been\r\nrecorded that are peculiar to Martinique, the Mascarene Islands, and to\r\nthe Marianne Group. Hillebrand gives for Hawaii, Potamogeton fluitans, a\r\nplant of the Old and New Worlds, and P. pauciflorus, a North American\r\nspecies; whilst in the _Index Kewensis_ a peculiar species, P.\r\nowaihiensis of Chamisso (which is, however, regarded by Hillebrand as a\r\nform of P. fluitans), is also accredited to the group. Owing, however,\r\nto the paucity of streams and rivers this genus takes no prominent part\r\nin the Hawaiian flora, and the species seem to have been recorded alone\r\nfrom Oahu. As they were discovered by Chamisso in the early part of last\r\ncentury they are in all probability truly indigenous in Hawaii, even if\r\nnone are peculiar to the group.\r\n\r\nThat ducks and similar birds are the agents in carrying the seeds of\r\nPotamogeton to oceanic islands cannot be doubted. About twelve years ago\r\nI examined the stomachs and intestines of thirteen wild ducks obtained\r\nin the London market. Three of them contained in all forty-one\r\nPotamogeton seeds, or rather “stones,” most of which subsequently\r\ngerminated in water. In one of my experiments, carried out in the month\r\nof December, I fed a domestic duck with the fruits of Potamogeton\r\nnatans. They appeared in quantity in the droppings, for the most part\r\ndivested of their soft coverings, but otherwise uninjured. Sixty per\r\ncent. germinated in the following spring; whilst of those left in the\r\nvessel, from which the duck had been fed, only one per cent. germinated\r\nin the next spring, and another year elapsed before any number did so.\r\nThese results were published in _Science Gossip_ for September, 1894.\r\n\r\nOne often reads in books of travel interesting remarks bearing\r\nindirectly on the dispersal of the Potamogetons. Thus, when Sir Joseph\r\nHooker (then Dr. Hooker) noted in his _Himalayan Journals_ the\r\noccurrence of P. natans in the Neongong Lake in the Himalayas, and the\r\npresence of coots, he most probably mentioned the bird that brought the\r\nplants, coots being active distributors of the seeds of water plants. It\r\nis of importance to remember that (as shown in my experiment on the\r\nduck) seeds of water-plants are voided in a condition peculiarly\r\nfavourable to early germination. Ducks, coots, and other water birds\r\nmight often be characterised as “travelling germinators.” My experiment\r\nshowed that seven to eight hours at least were occupied by Potamogeton\r\nnutlets in passing through the digestive canal of a duck, and that\r\nprobably nine or ten hours would be required after an average full meal.\r\nBut this does not represent the possible maximum period, since the bared\r\n“stone” may remain in the gizzard for a long time with ordinary gravel.\r\nMost of the Potamogeton fruits found by me in wild ducks were obtained\r\nfrom the gizzard, where they were mixed with gravel and other hard seeds\r\nor seedvessels, as described in Chapter XXXIII. Such fruits afterwards\r\ngerminated. With regard to the chances, therefore, of the fruits of\r\nPotamogeton being carried by a bird without injury across an ocean, we\r\nmay infer that, whether they are retained in its body for only ten hours\r\nor for as long as three or four days, they will preserve in some cases\r\ntheir germinating power.\r\n\r\n\r\n       HAWAIIAN GENERA FOUND IN TAHITI TO THE EXCLUSION OF FIJI.\r\n\r\nTaking only the genera that are strictly indigenous, and excluding\r\ntherefore all those introduced by the aborigines, the number available\r\nfor establishing an independent connection between the Hawaiian and\r\nTahitian regions is exceedingly few. Amongst the Hawaiian shore-plants\r\nnot found in Fiji proper but occurring in the Tahitian region are\r\nHeliotropium anomalum and Sesuvium portulacastrum. The last-named,\r\nhowever, has been recorded from Tonga, which lies within the Fijian\r\narea; whilst the first will probably be found in the same region.\r\nAmongst the Hawaiian and Tahitian mountain genera not recorded from Fiji\r\nproper are Nertera, Vaccinium, Cyathodes, and Luzula. As is pointed out\r\nin Chapter XXIII., the absence of these genera from Fiji is connected\r\nwith the relatively low elevation of those islands, though it is quite\r\npossible that one or more of them may yet be found on the highest\r\nsummits of Fiji; and indeed Nertera depressa and Vaccinium have been\r\ndiscovered in the more elevated uplands of Savaii in Samoa.\r\n\r\nAfter removing the littoral plants and the mountain genera, there are\r\nprobably not more than half a dozen inland genera that connect the\r\nHawaiian lowlands with the Tahitian region to the exclusion of the\r\nFijian Group; and Byronia (Ilicineæ), Reynoldsia or Trevesia\r\n(Araliaceæ), Phyllostegia (Labiatæ), and Pseudomorus (Urticaceæ) may be\r\ntaken as examples. Of these, Pseudomorus, which has a small drupaceous\r\nfruit suitable for dispersal by frugivorous birds, has been recorded\r\nfrom New Caledonia, and not improbably it exists in the Fijian area; and\r\nthe same may be postulated of Reynoldsia, which is discussed in a later\r\npage, since it has been found in Samoa. We may almost form the same\r\nopinion of Byronia, since it exists in Australia. This genus of small\r\ntrees contains only three known species, one in Australia, one in\r\nTahiti, and one in Hawaii. Its fleshy drupes, about a third of an inch\r\n(8 mm.) in size, would attract birds, and their numerous cartilaginous\r\npyrenes would probably pass unharmed through a bird’s alimentary canal.\r\nPhyllostegia, a Labiate genus with fleshy nucules that might attract\r\nbirds, is, with the exception of a solitary Tahitian species, entirely\r\nconfined to Hawaii (see Chapter XXII.).\r\n\r\nFrom these data it may be inferred that the interchange of plants\r\nbetween the regions of Hawaii and Tahiti to the exclusion of Fiji has\r\nbeen very slight. The facts of distribution are just such as we might\r\nlook for in the case of a general dispersal over the oceanic groups of\r\nthe tropical Pacific, with the altitudes of the islands playing a\r\ndetermining part. In this general dispersal Hawaii has shared; and\r\nexcept in the case of Phyllostegia it is evident that this group has\r\nkept nearly all it received and has distributed but little.\r\n\r\n\r\n       HAWAIIAN GENERA FOUND IN FIJI TO THE EXCLUSION OF TAHITI.\r\n\r\nWe shall be able to throw further light on the floral history of Hawaii\r\nby discussing the few tropical genera, not a score in all, that it\r\npossesses in common with Fiji to the exclusion of the Tahitian region.\r\nThe following genera offer themselves for treatment:—Eurya\r\n(Ternstrœmiaceæ), Gouania (Rhamnaceæ), Maba (Ebenaceæ), Sideroxylon\r\n(Sapotaceæ), Antidesma (Euphorbiaceæ), Pleiosmilax (Smilaceæ), and\r\nRuppia (Potameæ).\r\n\r\nThese seven genera, which with the exception of Ruppia, an aquatic\r\ngenus, are only represented in Hawaii by peculiar species, possess in\r\nall cases, except Gouania and the last-named genus, drupaceous or\r\nbaccate fruits likely to attract frugivorous birds. Two of them, Eurya\r\nand Antidesma, have their home in Malaya and in the Asiatic continent;\r\nthree of them, Gouania, Maba, and Sideroxylon, are found on both the\r\nAsiatic and the American sides of the Pacific Ocean; whilst Pleiosmilax\r\nshould, strictly speaking, be regarded as a Polynesian subgenus of\r\nSmilax, a world-ranging genus; and Ruppia is a cosmopolitan brackish-\r\nand salt-water genus.\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable that Fiji received almost all these genera from\r\nthe Old World through Malaya; and in some cases the resemblance between\r\nthe Malayan and the Fijian species is so close that, as in Gouania, Dr.\r\nSeemann questioned if they were not forms of the same species. In other\r\ninstances, as with Maba, we find a widely-ranging Asiatic and Malayan\r\nspecies, like Maba buxifolia, extending into Western Polynesia, where it\r\nis accompanied by other species peculiar to that region. But if the\r\ngenera were able subsequently to extend their range thence to Hawaii, it\r\nis difficult to understand why they have not reached the Tahitian\r\nregion. It is therefore likely that Hawaii received most of these genera\r\nby a northern route and not through the South Pacific; and it is\r\nlegitimate to suppose that when Old World genera like Eurya and\r\nAntidesma occur in north-eastern Asia, as in Japan and in the\r\nneighbouring mainland, Hawaii received the genus by that route. In the\r\ncase of Eurya it is noteworthy that Fijian and Samoan forms, regarded by\r\nSeemann and Gray as distinct species, are viewed by Reinecke as forms of\r\nE. japonica, an extremely variable species found in Japan. With genera\r\nlike Gouania and Maba, that exist on both sides of the Pacific, it is\r\npossible that they may have originally reached Hawaii from America.\r\n\r\nA noticeable feature in the instance of genera like Maba and Sideroxylon\r\nis that hard seeds or pyrenes 3/4 to 1 inch (18 to 25 mm.) in length\r\nhave seemingly been transported by frugivorous birds across the ocean to\r\nHawaii. This at first sight seems improbable; but it is known that\r\nfruit-pigeons can swallow very large drupes, as in the case of those of\r\nCanarium, Dracontomelon, and Elæocarpus, afterwards disgorging the\r\n“stones.” They have carried such stones to Fiji, across some 500 or 600\r\nmiles of ocean; and unless we impute a continental origin to Hawaii we\r\nmust assume that in some cases, as with Elæocarpus, Maba, and\r\nSideroxylon, they have been able to transport these large stones or\r\npyrenes to that group. The extent of ocean to be crossed is no doubt\r\nmuch greater, but this area of the Pacific is not without some small\r\nhalf-way groups that would serve as resting-places.\r\n\r\nThat fruits of the order Sapotaceæ are much appreciated by fruit-pigeons\r\nis already known. We learn from Kirk that the fruits of Sideroxylon\r\ncostatum (Sapota costata) are a favourite food of the New Zealand\r\nfruit-pigeon, the fruits, about an inch long, containing three hard\r\ncrescentic bony seeds nearly as long as the fruit. The natives of Vanua\r\nLevu informed me that a Fijian species of Sideroxylon with hard seeds\r\nabout an inch long was much appreciated on account of its fruit by the\r\npigeons. I found the hard, sound seeds of a species of Sapota,\r\ntwo-thirds of an inch (or 16 mm.) in size, in the crop of a Fijian\r\nfruit-pigeon. The similarly large seeds of a species of Achras were\r\nidentified by Mr. Charles Moore, of Sydney, amongst a collection of\r\nseeds, &c., found by me in the crops of fruit-pigeons shot in the\r\nSolomon Islands (Guppy’s _Solomon Islands_, p. 293). It may be added\r\nthat the difficulty concerned with Sideroxylon in Hawaii is the\r\ndifficulty concerned with other large-seeded Sapotaceous trees in Fiji\r\nand New Zealand, and the same explanation must be applied to all. Some\r\nfurther remarks on the Sapotaceæ in the Pacific are given below.\r\n\r\nThe mode of dispersal of some of these genera is illustrated in other\r\nregions. The berries of Pleiosmilax, a subgenus of Smilax, are well\r\nsuited for aiding the dispersal of the genus by frugivorous birds; and\r\nwe learn from Prof. Barrows (Weed, p. 42) that in the United States\r\ncrows feed on the fruits of Smilax rotundifolia and disperse the seeds.\r\nOn the other hand, it is not at first sight easy to understand how a\r\ngenus like Gouania has been distributed over the tropics of the globe,\r\nsince it possesses dry capsular fruits about half an inch across,\r\nseparating into three woody cocci that appear most unlikely to attract\r\nbirds. The same difficulty exists, however, with other dry-fruited\r\nwidely-ranging genera like Alphitonia and with many of the Euphorbiaceæ.\r\n\r\nAmongst these genera found in Hawaii and Fiji to the exclusion of Tahiti\r\nwe can at times detect indications of the operations of a polymorphous\r\nspecies as described in Chapter XXVI., when a widely-ranging highly\r\nvariable species is associated in some groups with peculiar species. We\r\nsee some evidence of this in the genera Gouania, Maba, and Eurya,\r\nalluded to on a previous page. (See also _Bot. Chall. Exped._, iii. 134,\r\nunder “Gouania.”)\r\n\r\nOne of the mysteries of the Pacific is concerned with the distribution\r\nof the Sapotaceæ, the dispersal of which by frugivorous birds has been\r\ndealt with above. It is strange that whilst the order seems to have\r\nfound a _rendezvous_ in Tonga, no one except Horne appears to have\r\nrecorded any of the genera from Samoa. They are fairly well represented\r\nin Fiji; but it is in Tonga that we especially note the gathering\r\ntogether of several Sapotaceous trees with large heavy seeds, of the\r\ngenera Bassia, Mimusops, and Sideroxylon. Besides owning one or two\r\nspecies of Sideroxylon in common with Fiji (Burkill), this small group\r\npossesses Bassia amicorum and Mimusops kauki, both of which were found\r\nthere by Forster at the time of Cook’s visit. In a list of a small\r\ncollection of plants made by him in Upolu in the Samoan Group about\r\n1879, Horne includes two species of Sideroxylon (_Year in Fiji_, p.\r\n286); and according to Seemann there is a Sapotaceous tree in Wallis\r\nIsland. A species of Bassia exists in Rarotonga, the seeds of which,\r\nfrom Mr. Cheeseman’s description of the fruit, must be almost an inch\r\nlong. Drake del Castillo refers to an endemic Tahitian tree near\r\nMimusops; but its fruit was not known to him.\r\n\r\nAs already indicated, the difficulties connected with the Sapotaceæ\r\naffect the whole Pacific from New Zealand north to Hawaii and from Fiji\r\neast to Tahiti. We are driven to appeal to the agency of frugivorous\r\nbirds, at least in the case of Sideroxylon, since some fruits\r\nexperimented on by me in Fiji sank at once or in a day or two, the seeds\r\nhaving no buoyancy. That birds actually disperse the seeds of this and\r\nother genera of the order has been already pointed out, yet it is\r\npossible that currents have at times aided in the dispersal of some of\r\nthe genera. This is indicated by the circumstance that, as we learn from\r\nSchimper, some Sapotaceous trees are to be included in the Malayan\r\nstrand-flora, namely, Sideroxylon ferrugineum, Mimusops kauki, and M.\r\nlittoralis, all occurring as well on the Asiatic mainland, the first\r\ngrowing also in the Liukiu Islands, and the last in the Andaman and\r\nNicobar Groups.\r\n\r\n_Ruppia maritima_ (Potameæ).—This cosmopolitan aquatic plant has only\r\nbeen recorded in Polynesia from Hawaii, Samoa, and Fiji. It had not been\r\ncollected in Fiji before my discovery of it in 1897. Amongst other\r\noceanic islands where it occurs may be mentioned the Bermudas, where,\r\naccording to Hemsley, it exists as an indigenous plant in the lagoons.\r\nChamisso first noticed it in Hawaii, and Hillebrand remarks that it\r\ngrows in shallow waters along the coasts. Amongst other localities where\r\nI noticed it in this group may be mentioned the north-west coast of the\r\nlarge island of Hawaii between Kailua and Keahole Point. Here in 1896 it\r\nwas thriving in brackish-water ponds, with Sesuvium portulacastrum\r\ngrowing at the edges. Reinecke observes that it occurs in similar ponds\r\nin Samoa. In 1897 I found it in abundance in the Rewa estuary (Fiji),\r\nboth in the creeks and in the main channel. In the following year it was\r\nnot to be found in this locality, a circumstance noticed both by the\r\nnatives and by resident whites. The fruits of this plant possess no\r\nfloating power, sinking, even after prolonged drying, in a few hours. It\r\nis to ducks and to birds of similar habit that its dispersal must be\r\nattributed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE ABSENTEES FROM HAWAII.\r\n\r\nIt has been before remarked that of the 330 or 340 genera of\r\nflowering-plants recorded from Fiji some 200 are not known in Hawaii. It\r\nwill only be possible to deal with the absent genera in a cursory\r\nmanner; but enough will be done to show that we are face to face here\r\nwith a multitude of the seeming inconsistencies that so often beset the\r\nstudy of plant-distribution.\r\n\r\nA host of plants are unrepresented in Hawaii, of which it may be said\r\nthat their seeds or fruits are not less suited for being carried across\r\nthe Pacific than those of many that are now in that group. On the other\r\nhand, a number of genera exist there which we should never expect to\r\nhave been endowed with the capacity, and to have received the\r\nopportunity, of crossing nearly 2,000 miles of ocean. Yet perhaps when\r\nNature acts in a wholesale fashion and excludes entire orders we may be\r\nable to perceive the dim outlines of a principle of exclusion at work.\r\nBut even here much caution and some clearing of the ground are needed.\r\n\r\nFor example, having regard to the several modes of dispersal possessed\r\nby the great variety of fruits and seeds of the Sterculiaceæ, it would\r\nbe almost meaningless to remark that the order so well represented in\r\nFiji is practically non-existent in Hawaii as far as truly indigenous\r\nplants are concerned. It is true that two species of Waltheria are here\r\npresent, but one of them W. americana, is a weed probably introduced by\r\nthe aborigines whilst the other, W. pyrolæfolia, recorded from a\r\nsolitary locality by the Wilkes Expedition, has seemingly never been\r\nfound since. From the standpoint of dispersal the genera Sterculia,\r\nHeritiera, Kleinhovia, Melochia, and Commersonia, that are represented\r\nin Fiji but not in Hawaii, cannot be discussed together. With Sterculia\r\nis concerned the dispersal by birds of large seeds, an inch in length,\r\nnot particularly well protected, the genus being confined to Fiji alone\r\nof all the oceanic Pacific groups. Heritiera is only represented by a\r\nlittoral species, the large fruits of which are carried great distances\r\nby the currents; and no other agency of dispersal is here possible. The\r\nlast three genera are distributed over the South Pacific, their\r\nrelatively small seeds being probably in the main dispersed by\r\ngranivorous birds; whilst the setose fruits of Commersonia may have been\r\nat times transported in birds’ plumage.\r\n\r\nIt is more legitimate, perhaps, to speak collectively of the orders\r\nMeliaceæ and Melastomaceæ as absent from Hawaii; but even here the issue\r\nraised is one concerned rather with opportunities than with capacities\r\nfor dispersal. Several years ago, M. Casimir de Candolle remarked that\r\n“it is hardly credible that the Meliaceæ should be entirely absent from\r\nthe Sandwich archipelago” (_Trans. Linn. Soc. Bot._, vol. i. 1880). Yet\r\nit can scarcely be said that this is a matter connected with means of\r\ndispersal. Amongst the Meliaceous genera represented in Fiji, Vavæa and\r\nAglaia have a berry, Melia has a drupe, and Dysoxylum has a capsule. So\r\nagain with the Melastomaceæ; it possesses at least six genera in Fiji,\r\ntwo in Tahiti, and none in Hawaii. Whilst the genera Melastoma and\r\nMedinilla have baccate fruits with minute seeds, Astronia has a capsule\r\nwith similar seeds, and Memecylon has a single-seeded berry. Since,\r\nhowever, minute seeds are most typical of the order, those of Melastoma\r\ndenticulatum being about one-fiftieth of an inch or ·5 mm. in size, it\r\nwould seem that this character has not aided its dispersal in the\r\nPacific so far as Hawaii is concerned. From the circumstance that\r\nberries, drupes, and capsules are represented in these two Fijian orders\r\nwe may form the opinion that their non-occurrence in Hawaii is due not\r\nso much to lack of capacities for dispersal as to failure of\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\nThis opinion is much strengthened when we come to deal with the\r\nindividual genera, where the predominant cause of the absence of so many\r\nFijian genera from Hawaii is concerned with the failure of the agencies\r\nof dispersal. It is not a question of a difference in size between the\r\ngroups, since, although the surface-area is approximately the same in\r\nboth groups, Hawaii possesses only two-thirds of the number of genera\r\noccurring in Fiji. It is not a question of capacity for dispersal across\r\nan ocean, since birds have transported across the Pacific to Hawaii the\r\n“stones” and large seeds of genera like Elæocarpus and Sideroxylon, a\r\nfeat that would have been deemed impossible by many botanists. It is no\r\nlack of capacity for dispersal that has excluded Loranthus from Hawaii\r\nand has admitted Viscum.\r\n\r\nFew genera, indeed, would seem to be better fitted for dispersal by\r\nfrugivorous birds in the Pacific than that of Ficus. Its fruits are\r\nknown to be eaten by birds all over the area of the genus; and we find\r\nthe species distributed over the South Pacific from Fiji to Tahiti, but\r\nthey are quite absent from Hawaii. This is the more remarkable on\r\naccount of the occurrence of a species of Ficus resembling a banyan in\r\nFanning Island about 900 miles south of the group (_Bot. Chall. Exped._,\r\niii. 116, 194), and because the Hawaiian Islands possess the Meliphagidæ\r\nor Honey-eaters, which are widely distributed in Polynesia and are known\r\nto feed on these fruits—a matter further discussed in my treatment of\r\nFicus later on in this chapter.\r\n\r\nOf several Rubiaceous genera with fleshy fruits that are represented\r\nboth in Fiji and Tahiti, such as Stylocoryne and others, and of those\r\nRubiaceous genera with minute seeds that, like Ophiorrhiza, are\r\ndistributed over the South Pacific, none occur in Hawaii. Here we find\r\nrepresented other genera of the order, like Gardenia, Plectronia, and\r\nCoprosma, that do not appear to be better fitted for dispersal by\r\nfrugivorous birds than many of the genera not existing there. If birds\r\nhave carried to Hawaii in their plumage the fruits of Pisonia and\r\nSicyos, it cannot be merely a question of capacity for dispersal that is\r\nconcerned with the restriction to the South Pacific of genera with hairy\r\nseeds, such as Trichospermum, Alstonia, and Hoya.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to dwell longer here on the subject of the Hawaiian\r\nabsentee-genera, since many of the absent plants will be discussed when\r\ndealing with the peculiarities of the Fijian flora. The data there given\r\nall go to show that mere lack of capacity for dispersal over the Pacific\r\noften counts for little in supplying us with an explanation of the\r\nabsence of so many likely genera from the Hawaiian flora. Hawaii has\r\nonly been stocked with those genera common to Fiji and Tahiti that could\r\nhave reached it during each age of general dispersal over the Pacific.\r\nIn later eras the dispersing agencies have been mainly active in the\r\ntropical South Pacific; and thus it is that, as will be pointed out in a\r\nlater page, the bulk of the plants of the Malayan era are confined to\r\nthe region between Fiji and Tahiti. In a still later period the\r\ndispersing agencies have confined their operations mainly to Western\r\nPolynesia and the last immigrant genera have not reached beyond the\r\nFijian region.\r\n\r\nThe whole story of plant-life in the tropical Pacific is bound up with\r\nthese successive stages of decreasing activity of the dispersing\r\nagencies. The story of plant-distribution in this region is well\r\nillustrated in its earlier phases of general dispersion in the floral\r\nhistory of Hawaii, in its later phase by those Asiatic genera that have\r\nonly crossed the South Pacific to Tahiti, and in its last phase by those\r\ngenera that have never extended beyond the groups of the Fijian area.\r\nThe area of active dispersion, that first comprised the whole of the\r\ntropical Pacific, was afterwards restricted to the South Pacific, and\r\nfinally to the western portion of that area. It can scarcely be doubted\r\nthat these successive stages in the contraction of the area of active\r\ndispersion of plants in the Pacific were accompanied by a corresponding\r\ndiminution in the general distribution of birds in the same ocean, to\r\nwhich it stood in the relation of an effect to a cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                TAHITI.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarities of the Tahitian flora as compared with Hawaii and Fiji\r\nmay be discussed by treating first those genera that are alone\r\nrepresented in Tahiti, the “residual” genera; then those that it\r\npossesses in common first with Hawaii and then with Fiji; and lastly by\r\npointing out the more noticeable gaps in the flora. By Tahiti is\r\ntypically signified the whole Tahitian region, which includes the\r\nAustral and Cook Groups, the Society Islands, the Paumotus, and the\r\nMarquesas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE TAHITIAN RESIDUAL GENERA.\r\n\r\nThe non-endemic genera occurring alone in the Tahitian region and not\r\nfound either in Hawaii or in one or other of the three groups of the\r\nFijian region (Fiji, Tonga, Samoa) are not more than half a dozen. These\r\nsix genera are exceedingly interesting; but since each tells a different\r\nstory and gives its own independent indication they cannot be treated in\r\na collective sense. Nor are they all to be regarded as anomalies in\r\nplant-distribution, since with a single exception there is scarcely one\r\nconcerning which it is not in some way possible to give an explanation\r\nof its isolation without coming into conflict with the principles of\r\nplant-dispersal. The exception is Lepinia tahitensis, which, without\r\npresenting any very evident capacity for dispersal, has not been\r\nrecorded from any other localities in the Pacific than the far-separated\r\nSolomon and Tahitian Groups. There is a suspicion that, as in the case\r\nof the residual genera of Hawaii, America may have contributed some of\r\nthe original plants, since three of the genera, Buttneria, Coriaria, and\r\nBidens, occur in that continent, and in the case of Coriaria Tahiti\r\npossesses a species found in South America as well as in New Zealand.\r\n\r\nOne of the trees in question is Cratæva religiosa, an Asiatic species,\r\nwhich may be placed among a group of trees, including Cananga odorata\r\nand Fagræa Berteriana, which, whilst they are much esteemed by the\r\ninhabitants of the South Pacific for their fruits or their flowers, and\r\nare often planted in and around their villages, possess fruits that\r\nattract birds, and in the case of Cananga are known to be dispersed by\r\nfruit-pigeons. Probably the aborigines and the birds have worked\r\ntogether in the distribution of these trees.\r\n\r\nThe genera Buttneria of the Sterculiaceæ and Berrya of the Tiliaceæ are\r\nrepresented in this region by species that must owe their dispersal to\r\nbirds, though I have no data relating to the matter of their dispersal,\r\ntheir fruits being capsular, in the first case prickly. Coriaria is a\r\nmountain genus in Tahiti and will be found discussed in Chapter XXIV. in\r\nconnection with the Tahitian mountain-flora. Its absence from the West\r\nPolynesian groups is no doubt to be connected with their insufficient\r\naltitude. In addition to the introduced Bidens pilosa, a common tropical\r\nweed, Tahiti possesses two other truly indigenous species of Bidens, of\r\nwhich one at least is peculiar to the region. The achenes of this genus\r\nare well known to be adapted for dispersal in a bird’s feathers; and\r\nsince the genus has its principal home in America, no other indigenous\r\nspecies having been recorded from South Polynesia, it is not unlikely\r\nthat the parent species was American.\r\n\r\nOne of the numerous enigmas of the Pacific floras is concerned with the\r\npresence in the islands of Tahiti and Moorea (Eimeo), in the Society\r\nGroup, of the Apocynaceous tree, Lepinia tahitensis. The genus contains\r\nthis solitary species, which has been collected only in one other\r\nlocality, namely, in the Solomon Group, where it was obtained by the\r\nRev. R. B. Comins. Such an instance of disconnected distribution is rare\r\nin the Pacific Islands, and undoubtedly it represents one of the\r\ndifficulties of the Tahitian flora. The fruits, which are indehiscent\r\nand five or six inches in length, possess a fibrous pericarp and a\r\nsingle seed. No data are to hand relating to the capacities for\r\ndispersal possessed by this plant, but it is certain that it has had\r\nsome means of crossing the sea between the adjacent islands of Tahiti\r\nand Moorea. (See Hemsley, _Journ. Linn. Soc. Bot._, xxx. 165.)\r\n\r\n\r\n       TAHITIAN GENERA FOUND IN HAWAII TO THE EXCLUSION OF FIJI.\r\n\r\nThis subject has been already discussed in this chapter in dealing with\r\nthe genera restricted to Hawaii and Tahiti.\r\n\r\n\r\n       TAHITIAN GENERA FOUND IN FIJI TO THE EXCLUSION OF HAWAII.\r\n\r\nExcluding the orchids, sedges, and grasses, as well as the few endemic\r\ngenera, between sixty and seventy genera, or rather less than half of\r\nthe genera of the flowering-plants of Tahiti, are found in Fiji to the\r\nexclusion of Hawaii. Of these, rather over a half are Old World genera;\r\nabout a third occur in both the Old and the New World; four are confined\r\nto Polynesia, and not one is exclusively American. One-third are genera\r\nnow possessing in the Tahitian region endemic species either entirely or\r\nin part, and in such cases we may consider that the agencies of\r\ndispersal are now inactive or partially suspended; the others belong\r\nentirely to the present era of dispersal. About half have more or less\r\nfleshy fruits fitted for dispersal by frugivorous birds. About a fourth\r\nhave capsular or other dry fruits that must have been also dispersed by\r\nbirds preferring a drier diet. Three only possess hairy seeds or fruits\r\nsuitable for being carried in a bird’s plumage, namely, Commersonia,\r\nWeinmannia, and Alstonia. There remain about a fourth of the total that\r\nare shore-plants dispersed by the currents, being in two cases (Ximenia\r\nand Kleinhovia) assisted by birds; whilst Triumfetta, another littoral\r\ngenus, is probably distributed by birds alone.\r\n\r\nThere are no cases of special difficulty from the standpoint of\r\ndispersal in these sixty and odd non-endemic genera that Tahiti\r\npossesses in common with Fiji to the exclusion of Hawaii. The lack of\r\ndifficulties connected with the dispersal of all these Tahitian genera\r\nis worthy of note, because there are very few difficult genera amongst\r\nthe rest of the Tahitian flora. Excluding Lepinia tahitensis, which has\r\nbeen already referred to, there are scarcely any “impossible” plants in\r\nthe Tahitian region; and even in this case, when the modes of dispersal\r\nof Lepinia come to be investigated, it is likely that much of the\r\ndifficulty will disappear. Hawaii, as we have before seen, abounds with\r\nperplexing questions of this nature. When dealing with the absentee\r\nTahitian genera, later on in this chapter, it will be shown that “size”\r\nhas played a prominent determining part in the exclusion of genera from\r\nTahiti, genera with seeds or “stones” exceeding half an inch or twelve\r\nmillimetres in dimension being, as a rule, unrepresented amongst the\r\ntruly indigenous plants.\r\n\r\nMy further remarks on these Tahitian genera found in Fiji but not in\r\nHawaii will be limited to some general observations from the standpoint\r\nof dispersal. I will first discuss some of those genera that possess\r\nonly peculiar species. They belong to an era of dispersal that, as far\r\nas Tahiti is concerned, is passing or has passed away. Here we have the\r\nspecies of each genus more or less localised in the various South\r\nPacific archipelagoes; but, as with Meryta, Alstonia, and Loranthus, it\r\nis often apparent that, although the Tahitian region is mainly outside\r\nthe zone of present dispersal, the different groups of the Western\r\nPacific are kept in touch by the possession of species in common. This\r\ntestifies to the activity of dispersal in that region after it had\r\nbecome suspended in Eastern Polynesia. The connection between the\r\nisolated endemic species of Eastern Polynesia and a species ranging over\r\nthe Western Pacific can sometimes be shown, as in the case of Loranthus,\r\nwhere a species confined to the Society Islands and to the Marquesas is\r\nvery closely related to L. insularum, a widely-ranging West Polynesian\r\nspecies that reaches eastward as far as Rarotonga.\r\n\r\nWe next have those genera like Grewia, Nelitris, Melastoma, Randia,\r\nGeniostoma, Tabernæmontana, Fagræa, Bischoffia, Macaranga, and Ficus,\r\nthat possess in Polynesia one or more widely-ranging species. The agency\r\nof the polymorphous species, which I have described in the preceding\r\nchapter in connection with the general dispersal of Malayan plants over\r\nthe whole of Polynesia, is evidently also active when the work of\r\ndispersal is restricted to the South Pacific. Its operation is to be\r\ndistinctly traced in all the genera above named except in Fagræa and\r\nFicus. Thus, in the genera Grewia, Melastoma, Randia, Geniostoma, and\r\nMacaranga we find a single variable species ranging over the South\r\nPacific from Fiji to Tahiti, keeping all the groups in touch, but\r\nassociated in each, as a rule, with one or more peculiar species. A yet\r\nearlier stage in the process is to be seen in those genera which, like\r\nNelitris, Tabernæmontana, and Bischoffia, possess only a solitary\r\nspecies ranging over the South Pacific, varying in each group, but not\r\nusually associated with endemic species. As with Melastoma, Macaranga,\r\nand others, we can often trace the widely-ranging species of Polynesia\r\nback to its home in Malaya, and with these and other genera the\r\nconnection between a species confined to a group and a variable species\r\nranging through all the archipelagoes of the South Pacific can sometimes\r\nbe detected in the affinity of their characters.\r\n\r\nIt is thus seen that one of the principal determining causes of the\r\ndifferentiation of species in Polynesia lies in the failure of the\r\ndispersing agencies, a widely-ranging species becoming in consequence\r\ngradually isolated in the various groups. With some genera, as with\r\nOphiorrhiza, it is possible to show that the resulting endemic species\r\npass into each other by intermediate forms.\r\n\r\nMy further remarks on the Tahitian genera occurring in Fiji but not in\r\nHawaii will be devoted mainly to those with which I was most familiar\r\nfrom the standpoint of dispersal.\r\n\r\nThe Tiliaceous genus GREWIA offers a good example of those Polynesian\r\ngenera which possess in the South Pacific a single widely-ranging\r\nspecies associated often with endemic species in the individual groups.\r\nIt is likely that a polymorphous form, including most of the Polynesian\r\nspecies, could be here constituted. The fruits are dryish drupes,\r\nbecoming black and moist when over-ripe, and containing three or four\r\npyrenes suitable for distribution by birds and five or six millimetres\r\nin size.\r\n\r\nThe berries of NELITRIS, a genus of the Myrtaceæ, contain a few hard\r\nseeds that are well fitted for dispersal by frugivorous birds. I am\r\ninclined to follow Drake del Castillo, who considers that there is only\r\none varying species, N. vitiensis (Gray), which is distributed over the\r\nwhole of the South Pacific from the Solomon Islands to Tahiti. The\r\ntendency of this widely-ranging species to vary in different groups is\r\nindicated in the fact that some botanists have distinguished other\r\nspecies within these limits. It is noteworthy that N. paniculata in\r\nIndo-Malaya and N. vitiensis in the Pacific cover the whole range of the\r\ngenus. It would be interesting to establish a connection between them.\r\n\r\nMELASTOMA, an Old World genus of forty and more species, has one very\r\nvariable species, M. denticulatum, which, as defined by Bentham, has the\r\nrange of the genus from tropical Asia across the Pacific to Tahiti. This\r\nplant is associated in some groups, as in Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa, with\r\nother more or less localised species, and it affords a good example of\r\nthe principle of polymorphism in species-making. The berry-like fruits\r\ncontain an abundance of minute seeds, half a millimetre in size, which,\r\nwhen rendered adhesive by adherent pulp, might readily stick to\r\nfeathers, or they might pass unharmed through the alimentary canal of a\r\nbird. It is noteworthy that amongst the plants regarded by Prof. Penzig\r\nas introduced by frugivorous birds into Krakatoa since the eruption is a\r\nspecies of Melastoma.\r\n\r\nFew genera in these islands would better repay a careful study of their\r\nspecies with regard both to the influence of station on specific\r\ncharacters and to the question of “mutations” than OPHIORRHIZA. I found\r\nthe three Fijian species of this Rubiaceous genus so often in close\r\nassociation, that I cannot doubt there is some connection between them.\r\nSeemann and Gray, indeed, characterise two of them as confluent species.\r\nThe island of Tahiti alone possesses five peculiar species, and it is\r\nevident that this island has been a centre of development for species of\r\nOphiorrhiza, just as Samoa has become the birthplace of many species of\r\nthe Urticaceous genus Elatostema. The minute angular seeds of\r\nOphiorrhiza would probably be transported in a bird’s feathers or in\r\nadherent soil. As my experiments showed, they do not become adhesive\r\nwhen wet.\r\n\r\nThe genus LORANTHUS as distributed in the South Pacific has already been\r\nbriefly noticed. There is a species confined to the Tahitian region, and\r\nthere is another peculiar to Samoa, whilst one widely-ranging species,\r\nL. insularum, that connects these regions together, reaching east to\r\nRarotonga, is closely related with the Tahitian species. There was no\r\ndoubt originally a single polymorphous plant that ranged over the\r\ntropical South Pacific. With regard to the mode of dispersal of the\r\nseeds of this genus of parasites, I should at once refer to the\r\nsystematic and careful observations made by Mr. F. W. Keeble in Ceylon\r\n(_Trans. Linn. Soc._, v. 1895-1901). He formed the opinion that the\r\nseeds of Loranthus usually reach their host without passing through the\r\nalimentary canal of a bird, being merely wiped off its bill. This method\r\nwould never carry the seeds to Tahiti or even to Fiji; and since this\r\nobserver remarks that, although most of the seeds in the droppings were\r\ncompletely rotten, some of them “possibly pass through the gut\r\nuninjured,” we may accept this possibility as sufficient for the purpose\r\nof dispersal in the Pacific Ocean. Mr. Keeble notes the observation in\r\nTeil 3 of Engler’s _Die Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien_ that the seeds may\r\ngerminate after passing through a bird’s intestine; and we may therefore\r\ninfer that whilst the method he describes is typical of local dispersal,\r\nthe other method is required in the instance of oceanic dispersal.\r\n\r\nALSTONIA, an Apocynaceous genus of tropical Asia and Australia, yields\r\nthe caoutchouc of Fiji. Besides possessing in Fiji and Samoa peculiar\r\nspecies, the islands of Western Polynesia have in A. plumosa a species\r\ncommon to Fiji, Samoa, and New Caledonia. Another species, A. costata,\r\nis restricted to Eastern Polynesia, occurring in the different islands\r\nof the Tahitian Group as well as in Rarotonga. It is possible that the\r\nPacific species may be connected with A. scholaris, a species possessing\r\nthe range of the genus with the exception of Polynesia. The long\r\nciliated or hairy seeds, six to nine millimetres in length, are fitted\r\nfor transport by the winds and in birds’ plumage. The follicles dehisce\r\non the tree, and, according to Horne, the light seeds are distributed\r\nlocally by the wind. It is probable that the thick white juice oozing\r\nfrom a broken branch would at times aid the adhesion of the seeds to a\r\nbird’s feathers.\r\n\r\nGENIOSTOMA, a genus of the Loganiaceæ, is found in Malaya, Australia,\r\nand New Zealand. It possesses in G. rupestre a species that ranges\r\nacross the South Pacific from New Caledonia to Tahiti, being associated\r\nwith one or more endemic species in most of the groups. The fruit is a\r\ndehiscent capsule containing numerous small seeds imbedded in a\r\nyellowish pulp; and from the standpoint of dispersal it may be placed in\r\nthe same category with Pittosporum and Gardenia (see pages 310, 313).\r\n\r\nThe same principle involved in the occurrence of a species ranging the\r\nSouth Pacific from New Caledonia to Tahiti, and associated with one or\r\nmore endemic species in most of the principal groups, is illustrated in\r\nthe Euphorbiaceous genus MACARANGA. It is specially noteworthy that M.\r\ntanarius, which ranges from India to East Australia and the New\r\nHebrides, comes in touch in the group just named with M. harveyana, the\r\nwidely-ranging plant of the South Pacific above alluded to, and itself\r\nan Asiatic species (see Burkill; _Bot. Chall. Exped._, iii. 191; _Index\r\nKewensis_). The connection between M. harveyana, the widely-ranging\r\nspecies of the South Pacific, and the endemic species in the various\r\ngroups is indicated by its affinity with M. reineckei, a Samoan species.\r\nThe Macarangas in Fiji grow in a variety of situations, on the borders\r\nof estuaries, in the mountain forests, and on the isolated mountain\r\npeaks. It is to birds that we must look for the dispersal of the genus.\r\nIn the case of a species, apparently M. seemanni, common in the Rewa\r\ndelta, the seeds, which soon fall out of the cocci, are not infrequently\r\nfound in the drift of the estuary, but they sink in a week or two. Other\r\nspecies examined showed no capacity for dispersal by currents. The fruit\r\nof M. harveyana is provided with a few prickles, but since it breaks up\r\ninto the cocci, from which the seeds soon fall out, these appendages\r\ncould scarcely aid its dispersal.\r\n\r\nLike many other genera, TABERNÆMONTANA, an Apocynaceous genus\r\ndistributed through the tropics, is represented in Polynesia by a\r\nwidely-ranging species, T. orientalis, which extends from Malaya and\r\nEastern Australia through all the large groups of the South Pacific from\r\nthe New Hebrides to Tahiti, and is associated in Fiji with one or two\r\npeculiar species, one of which, according to Mr. Burkill, is nearly\r\nrelated to it. This genus therefore seems to illustrate the earliest\r\nstage in the Pacific of that process by which a widely-ranging species\r\ntakes on a polymorphous habit and through its variations gives rise to\r\ndifferent species in various groups. Prof. Schimper ranks T. orientalis\r\namongst the Malayan strand-flora; but in Fiji the Tabernæmontanas are\r\nonly littoral where the soil is rich as in alluvial regions; and they\r\nhave no capacity for dispersal by currents that is worth speaking of,\r\nthe seeds in the case of T. orientalis and another species sinking after\r\ndrying for years, whilst the follicles soon open in water and go to the\r\nbottom in a few days. The observations of Gaudichaud and Moseley\r\nindicate that some Malayan species are dispersed locally by the currents\r\n(_Bot. Chall. Exped._, iii, 279, 293); but the fruits of the genus are\r\nevidently quite unfit for oceanic dispersal by this agency. We find in\r\nthe bird the agent that has carried the genus to the distant\r\nisland-groups of the Pacific; and from the standpoint of dispersal the\r\nfruits may be placed with those of Pittosporum and Gardenia, being\r\nfollicular, and in the Fijian plants possessing seeds, 5 to 10\r\nmillimetres in size, embedded in a pulp.\r\n\r\nFAGRÆA, an Asiatic and Malayan genus of the Loganiaceæ, is represented\r\nin the Pacific by F. berteriana ranging through all the groups and\r\nislands of the South Pacific from the Solomon Islands and New Caledonia\r\nto Tahiti and the Marquesas, and by one or two other species in Fiji. It\r\nis with Fagræa berteriana that we are entirely concerned. The tree is\r\noften planted by the Pacific islanders near their villages; and since\r\nthey value its timber and use its large fragrant flowers for personal\r\ndecoration and for other purposes, it is probable that they have aided\r\nin its dispersal. But, as shown below, it behaves in most localities as\r\nan indigenous plant; and its berries are well fitted for promoting its\r\ndispersal by frugivorous birds.\r\n\r\nI was familiar with Fagræa berteriana both in the Solomon Islands and in\r\nFiji; and in the last-named locality I especially studied it from the\r\nstandpoint of dispersal. All over the South Pacific, whether in the\r\nSolomon Islands, in Fiji, in Rarotonga, or in Tahiti, this tree, though\r\nthriving also in the lower levels, especially frequents rocky scantily\r\nvegetated or open-wooded hill-tops and crests up to 2,000 or 2,500 feet\r\nabove the sea. In the rich alluvial soil of the Rewa delta in Fiji it\r\nattains a height of 25 or 30 feet or more, whilst in the poor, dry soil\r\nof the “talasinga” plains in this group it is much dwarfed, and often\r\ndoes not exceed 10 feet, and may be only 6 feet high. It is in these\r\n“talasinga,” or “sun-burnt,” plains of Fiji, especially in the Mbua\r\nprovince of Vanua Levu, that the tree, although dwarfed, seems most at\r\nhome. Here it flowers and fruits abundantly whilst associated with\r\nAcacia, Casuarina, and Pandanus trees, and it is in such dry localities\r\nthat this tree reflects in its choice of station the behaviour of\r\ndifferent species of the genus in the Malay Peninsula, where they grow\r\nin open heath-country and sometimes on sandy heaths (Ridley in _Trans.\r\nLinn. Soc. Bot._, iii, 1888-94). The fruits and seeds of F. berteriana\r\nhave little or no capacity for dispersal by currents. On the Fijian\r\nplains the berries partially wither and rot on the tree. In the western\r\npart of its area this tree almost comes in touch with the Asiatic\r\nspecies, F. obovata, that ranges from India and Ceylon to the Malayan\r\nregion, a species that must be indebted to frugivorous birds for its\r\nwide distribution.\r\n\r\nThe Euphorbiaceous genus BISCHOFFIA seems to offer another example of\r\npolymorphism in a wide-ranging species. Following Drake del Castillo, I\r\ntake the genus as including only a single species, B. Javanica, a tree\r\ndistributed over tropical Asia, Malaya, and Polynesia as far east as\r\nTahiti. The variable character of the species is indicated by the\r\ndifferent views held by the several botanists who have discussed the\r\nSouth Pacific species. Whilst it is a common forest-tree in Indo-Malaya,\r\nit affects in the Pacific islands the open-wooded districts of the lower\r\nlevels, and it is not uncommon on the dry “talasinga” plains of Fiji.\r\nThe fruits and seeds displayed in my experiments little or no capacity\r\nfor dispersal by currents; nor do these dryish berries, with seeds four\r\nor five millimetres long, seem to be especially attractive for\r\nfruit-eating birds; and it is likely that the same birds that distribute\r\nMacaranga seeds also disperse those of this genus. The tree bears the\r\nsame name over the South Pacific, “koka” in Fiji and Rarotonga, and “oa”\r\nin Samoa. Like many other Polynesian trees, it has its uses, but there\r\nis no reason to believe that the natives have aided materially in its\r\ndispersal.\r\n\r\nFICUS, a large genus comprising several hundred species, attains its\r\ngreatest development in tropical Asia and in Malaya. It is well\r\nrepresented in the Western Pacific from the Solomon Islands to Fiji and\r\nSamoa; but in Eastern Polynesia the species are very few, and the genus\r\nis altogether absent from Hawaii, although a species has been found in\r\nthe North Pacific in Fanning Island, about 900 miles south of the\r\nHawaiian group (see page 377).\r\n\r\nThe Polynesian species are for the most part restricted to the Pacific\r\nislands, but there are only two species that range over the South\r\nPacific as far east as Tahiti, namely, Ficus prolixa, the Tahitian\r\nbanyan, and F. tinctoria. Some species are confined to Western\r\nPolynesia, such as F. obliqua, the Fijian banyan, F. scabra, and F.\r\naspera, the last occurring in East Australia. Among the individual\r\ngroups Fiji possesses probably fourteen or fifteen species, of which,\r\nperhaps, a third would be peculiar. According to Dr. Warburg, as cited\r\nin Dr. Reinecke’s paper, Samoa owns eight species, of which six may be\r\nendemic. In Rarotonga and Tahiti we find only F. prolixa and F.\r\ntinctoria. The species in the groups where they are best represented\r\nbelong to three or four sections of the genus.\r\n\r\nThe banyans of the South Pacific are represented by three or four\r\nspecies, namely, Ficus prolixa, the Tahitian banyan, found all over the\r\ntropical groups of the South Pacific from the New Hebrides and New\r\nCaledonia to Tahiti, the Marquesas and Pitcairn Island (Maiden); F.\r\nobliqua, the Fijian banyan, confined to the islands of the Western\r\nPacific from the New Hebrides to Tonga; and two new banyans in Samoa, as\r\ndescribed by Dr. Warburg in Dr. Reinecke’s paper. In my paper on\r\nPolynesian plant-names it is shown that the banyans possess two names in\r\nthe Pacific, one being “aoa,” the Polynesian name, found in all the\r\ngroups from Samoa eastward, and connected linguistically with the\r\nMalayan and Malagasy banyan-words; the other, the Melanesian name\r\ntypified in the Fijian “mbaka,” and represented in a variety of forms in\r\nthe New Hebrides and neighbouring groups.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the Pacific islanders have assisted in the dispersal\r\nof one or two of the species of Ficus, such as F. tinctoria, which they\r\nemploy for different purposes, but, generally speaking, birds are active\r\nagents in distributing the genus. I need scarcely say that the agency of\r\nthe currents is quite insufficient to explain the distribution of Ficus.\r\nWhen in Fiji I experimented on three or four different species of Ficus\r\nbelonging to the sections of the genus there represented. The fruits may\r\nfloat at first, but within a week or ten days they break down, and the\r\nseeds escape and sink. Beneath a tree of F. scabra growing on the banks\r\nof the Wai Tonga in Viti Levu, I noticed a number of its fruits floating\r\nin a sodden condition among the reeds at the river-side.\r\n\r\nIt is with the banyans that the dispersal of the seeds by frugivorous\r\nbirds becomes most evident. This is at once indicated by the frequent\r\noccurrence of these trees in the interior of coral islets in the Western\r\nPacific, as in Fiji and in the Solomon Islands. Fruit-pigeons roost in\r\ntheir branches, and birds shot on these islets often contain the fruits\r\nin their crops (_Bot. Chall. Exped._, iv, 310). The process may also be\r\nseen in operation in Krakatoa. Professor Penzig found in 1897 that three\r\nspecies of Ficus had established themselves there since the eruption of\r\n1883 through the agency of frugivorous birds. Besides pigeons, we find\r\nthat parrots, hornbills, honey-eaters, &c., feed on these fruits, and I\r\npossess a large number of references to this subject. The Messrs. Layard\r\nin New Caledonia, Dr. Meyer in Celebes, Mr. Everett in Borneo, Dr.\r\nForbes in Sumatra, and several other contributors to _Ibis_ might be\r\nhere mentioned. Dr. Beccari, in his _Wanderings in the Great Forests of\r\nBorneo_, speaks of “the facile dissemination of the various species of\r\nFicus through the agency of birds,” and he arrives at certain important\r\nconclusions which are discussed in Chapter XXXIII.\r\n\r\nI have before alluded to the absence of Ficus from Hawaii. This group\r\npossesses the Honey-Eaters (Meliphagidæ), birds well suited for\r\ndispersing species of Ficus over Polynesia; but this family of birds is\r\nonly represented by peculiar genera in Hawaii, and therein lies the\r\nexplanation. At the time when the Honey-Eaters roamed over Polynesia,\r\nthe genus Ficus had not arrived from Malaya. The connection between the\r\nbird and the plant is well shown on Fernando Noronha, which possesses a\r\npeculiar species of Ficus and a peculiar species of dove, the only\r\nfruit-eating bird in the island (Ridley).\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE ABSENTEES FROM TAHITI\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, all the “difficult” genera which puzzle the student\r\nof plant-dispersal in Fiji and Hawaii are absent from the Tahitian\r\nregion. Those with stone-fruits and with large seeds, where the stone or\r\nseed is an inch in size and over, are absent from Tahiti. Thus the\r\ngenera Canarium, Dracontomelon, Myristica, Sterculia, and others, of\r\nwhich the three first-named are known to be dispersed by fruit-pigeons,\r\nhave not advanced into the Pacific eastward of the Fijian region. We\r\nmiss in the Tahitian islands the large-fruited palms of Fiji, such as\r\nthe Veitchias with fruits two to two and a half inches (5 to 6 cm.)\r\nlong, and we find in their place a Ptychosperma, evidently very rare,\r\nand the widely spread Pritchardia pacifica, that may have been\r\nintroduced by man, both with drupes not far exceeding half an inch (1·2\r\ncm.) in size. The islands of the Tahitian region also lack the Coniferæ;\r\nand genera like Dammara, Dacrydium, and Podocarpus that give such a\r\ncharacter to the Fijian forests are not to be found. In this region we\r\ndo not find many of the large-seeded Leguminous genera, such as\r\nCynometra, Storckiella, and Afzelia, that occur in Fiji, the only\r\nlarge-seeded genera that it possesses being such as are brought by the\r\ncurrents, namely, Mucuna, Strongylodon, Cæsalpinia. The difficulties\r\npresented by the occurrence of the inland species of Canavalia and\r\nMezoneuron in Hawaii do not offer themselves in Tahiti (see Chapter XV).\r\nTahiti also lacks, as often before observed, the mangroves and most of\r\nthe plants of the mangrove-formation.\r\n\r\nAs above remarked, the Fijian trees with large “stones” and heavy seeds\r\nan inch in size are not to be reckoned amongst the indigenous Tahitian\r\nplants, “size” being an important determining factor in the exclusion.\r\nThe occurrence of Elæocarpus in Rarotonga presents no real difficulty,\r\nas I have explained in Chapter XXVI. An apparent exception is presented\r\nby the existence in Tahiti of Calophyllum spectabile, where the stones\r\nare about an inch across; but since its fruits can float in sea-water\r\nfor nearly a month, and on account of the value placed on its timber by\r\nthe Polynesians, we cannot altogether exclude the agencies of man and\r\nthe currents. One seeming exception is also offered by the presence of\r\nSerianthes myriadenia, a tree which in Fiji grows both in the forests\r\nand on the banks of the tidal estuaries. Its seeds, which are six to\r\nseven-tenths of an inch (15 to 18 mm.) in length, have no buoyancy, and\r\nthe pods float only two or three weeks. The case of Lepinia tahitensis\r\nis alluded to elsewhere, but it may be added that these and other\r\ndifficulties await further investigation.\r\n\r\nA great many Fijian plants are not found in the Tahitian region, such as\r\nMicromelum, those of the order Meliaceæ, the Melastomaceous genus\r\nMedinilla, Myrmecodia, Ophiorrhiza, &c., which are often quite as well\r\nfitted for over-sea transport as are several of the plants already\r\nestablished there. But it should be remembered that crowding out would\r\noften come into play in such a contracted region. The area, however, has\r\nbeen very generously dealt with as regards plant genera. Though the\r\ntotal land-surface cannot be more than one-fourth or one-third that of\r\nFiji or Hawaii, it possesses more than half the number of genera found\r\nin Fiji, and four-fifths of the number found in Hawaii.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  FIJI\r\n\r\n_The Fijian Genera not found in either the Tahitian or Hawaiian Regions_\r\n\r\nWe have already in some degree dealt with Fiji in so far as the partial\r\ndispersal of genera over the Pacific islands is concerned. We have seen\r\nthat it possesses very few genera (not a score in all) in common with\r\nHawaii that are not found in the Tahitian region, and it is assumed that\r\nin most cases such genera reached Hawaii independently and not through\r\nthe South Pacific. On the other hand, excluding the grasses, sedges, and\r\nvascular cryptogams, Fiji owns in common with Tahiti between sixty and\r\nseventy genera that do not occur in Hawaii. This shows unmistakably the\r\ntrend of plant migration in the Pacific islands. Several interesting\r\nfeatures in plant-distribution have been already brought out, and\r\nnotably the fact that Indo-Malayan genera with large seeds or “stones”\r\nan inch in size have been arrested in the Fijian region in their passage\r\ninto the South Pacific. Thus Canarium, Dracontomelon, Myristica, and\r\nSterculia have not extended eastward of the Fijian area.\r\n\r\nYet a very large proportion of the Fijian genera, quite half of the\r\ntotal number, are not represented either in the Tahitian or in the\r\nHawaiian region; and of many of them it is obvious that they are as well\r\nfitted to be carried over the Pacific as are those that have actually\r\nreached Tahiti and Hawaii. Take, for instance, Begonia, which has not\r\nextended east of Fiji, though Hillebrandia, a genus of the order, is\r\npeculiar to Hawaii. Nor can we explain why with three genera like\r\nGeissois, Dolicholobium, and Alstonia, possessing seeds dispersed by the\r\nwinds, only the last-named has passed beyond Fiji. However, as before\r\nremarked, it is probable that lack of opportunity rather than capacity\r\nfor dispersal has determined the matter, and we must, therefore, assume\r\nthat many of the genera have halted in the Fijian region because they\r\nentered the Pacific after the age of active general dispersal over that\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nOccasionally we notice in this region that which we have observed in the\r\ncase of Cyrtandra in different Pacific groups, namely, a sudden\r\ndevelopment of what Hillebrand terms “formative energy” in a genus, such\r\nas we find in the case of Elatostema in Samoa, and in that of Psychotria\r\nin Fiji and Samoa. The principle of polymorphism in the development of\r\nspecies is also illustrated by Micromelum and by Limnanthemum. In the\r\nlast case we possess a typical polymorphous species in Limnanthemum\r\nindicum that has played in this respect the _rôle_ of Naias marina in\r\nthe warm waters of the globe.\r\n\r\nWith several genera that like Gnetum, Myristica, and Sterculia occur\r\nboth in the Old and the New World, it is evident that in explaining\r\ntheir distribution we are dealing with something more than questions of\r\nmeans of dispersal. With these genera, and with others like Lindenia, it\r\nseems almost futile to talk of means of dispersal, when to all\r\nappearance their existing distribution is but the remnant of an age of\r\ngeneral dispersion over the greater part of the warm regions of the\r\nworld. These genera, with others, might be cited in favour of the\r\ncontinental hypothesis relating to the islands of the Western Pacific.\r\nTrees with stone-fruits, such as Canarium, Couthovia, Dracontomelon, and\r\nVeitchia, where the stones are an inch and more in length, might be also\r\nadduced by some in evidence of this theory. But in these cases the\r\nlesson of Elæocarpus (Chapter XXVI) should always be remembered, since\r\nthe “stones” of drupes may vary greatly in size amongst the different\r\nspecies of a genus, and species seemingly “impossible” from the\r\nstandpoint of dispersal in one group may be represented in other groups\r\nby species where the size of the “stone” presents no difficulty in\r\nattributing the dispersal of the genus to frugivorous birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Sterculia_\r\n\r\nThe problem connected with the presence of this genus in Fiji is but a\r\npart of the still more difficult problem connected with the dispersal of\r\nthe genus over the tropics. The riddle presented by the Fijian species\r\nseems, indeed, difficult enough; but it merely presents in miniature the\r\ngreat mystery surrounding the whole genus. According to the _Index\r\nKewensis_ no other species have been found in oceanic islands except\r\nthose occurring in the Western Pacific, as in Fiji, the New Hebrides,\r\nand New Caledonia, and most of these seem to be confined to those\r\nislands. We have here a genus that repeats the Dammara difficulty of the\r\nWestern Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe trees are common in places in the Vanua Levu forests, where the\r\nlarge, woody, open follicles may be seen lying in numbers on the ground,\r\nempty and in all stages of decay. The seeds of one species, near\r\nSterculia vitiensis, were nearly an inch long and sank like stones. The\r\nunopened follicles will float for weeks; but it is evident that Nature\r\ndoes not disperse the genus in this fashion, since the fruits before\r\ndehiscence remain on the tree. It is also noteworthy that Gaudichaud,\r\nwhen describing the floating drift of the Molucca seas, refers to the\r\nopen follicles of two or three species of Sterculia (_Bot. Chall.\r\nExped._, iii, 279). The fruits never came under my notice in the drift\r\nof Fiji. The seeds of a Fijian species examined by me were four-fifths\r\nof an inch (2 cm.) long. They had a thin, brittle, outer skin and\r\ncrustaceous inner test, and, being edible, might attract birds; but such\r\nbirds would be ground feeders, like the Megapod, and the Goura pigeon of\r\nNew Guinea, and the Nicobar pigeon, birds of this habit being rare in\r\nFiji. I should doubt whether the seeds are sufficiently protected to be\r\npreserved from injury in a bird’s stomach during a long sea-passage; and\r\nthey may thus be placed in the same category with the seeds of\r\nMyristica, a genus that has also failed to reach Tahiti and Hawaii.\r\n\r\nBut the distribution of Sterculia raises other more important questions\r\nthan that connected with its occurrence in Fiji, which involves an\r\nover-sea passage of only 500 or 600 miles. As in Podocarpus amongst the\r\nConiferæ, which has a similar distribution in the Western Pacific, we\r\nhave to explain the existence of the genus in the three great\r\ncontinental masses of Africa, Asia, and America, now separated by oceans\r\nseveral thousands of miles across. Here also we must look far back into\r\nthe ages for a common centre of diffusion in the extreme north, such as\r\nis in a sense suggested by the occurrence of the order in the Eocene\r\nbeds of Europe.\r\n\r\nAs showing unmistakably that Fiji received its species from the Old\r\nWorld, it may be observed that one of its trees, Sterculia vitiensis, is\r\nvery closely allied to S. fœtida, widely spread in tropical Asia, in\r\nMalaya, and Australia, as well as in Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Trichospermum_ (Sterculiaceæ)\r\n\r\nThere are only two species of this tree recorded in the _Index\r\nKewensis_, one in Java, and one in Fiji as well as in Samoa. The fruit\r\nis a capsule with small, flat seeds, margined by long hairs, that might\r\npossibly attach themselves to a bird’s feathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Micromelum_ (Rutaceæ)\r\n\r\nThis small genus of tropical Asia, Malaya, tropical Australia and the\r\nislands of the Western Pacific, has one species, Micromelum pubescens,\r\npossessing the range of the genus with other species that are restricted\r\nto different localities. We thus have apparently another illustration of\r\nthe part played by a wide-ranging polymorphous plant in providing new\r\nspecies. The red berries would easily attract frugivorous birds; but the\r\nseed-tests seem too delicate to allow the seeds to remain more than a\r\nfew hours in a bird’s stomach without injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Cananga odorata_ (Anonaceæ)\r\n\r\nThis tree, which is cultivated in many places in tropical Asia and\r\nMalaya, but is certainly indigenous, according to the authors of the\r\n_Flora Indica_, in Ava and Tenasserim, has apparently extended into the\r\nPacific by cultivation. But though much valued by the natives on account\r\nof its fragrant flowers, and in consequence often planted by them near\r\ntheir villages, it grows in some localities in Fiji and Samoa as an\r\nindigenous plant. The berries are especially suited for dispersal by\r\nfrugivorous birds, their flat seeds, 8 mm. in length, possessing hard\r\ncrustaceous tests that would enable them to pass unharmed in a bird’s\r\ndroppings. According to Reinecke the fruits are sought after by pigeons,\r\nand particularly by Didunculus strigirostris, the Samoan Tooth-Billed\r\nPigeon. The tree has not travelled eastward of Tonga and Samoa, with the\r\nexception of its occurrence in Rarotonga; and according to Mr. Cheeseman\r\nthe Rarotongans received it from Samoa several years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Geissois_ (Saxifragaceæ)\r\n\r\nThis genus of seven or eight known species is found in Australia, New\r\nCaledonia, the New Hebrides, and Fiji. Since New Caledonia possesses\r\nfour species, it may be considered the home of the genus. To the Fijian\r\nendemic species, G. ternata, I paid special attention. The capsules\r\ndehisce on the tree and allow the small seeds to escape. These seeds,\r\nwhich are very light, 150 to 200 going to a grain, are 3 to 4 mm. long\r\nand are winged at one end. They could no doubt be carried some distance\r\nby strong winds; but they possess no buoyancy. Large bats probably aid\r\nin their dispersal. The Fijians assert that these animals are in the\r\nhabit of visiting the trees for the sake of the honey furnished by the\r\nconspicuous red flowers. When they see a bat flying towards these trees,\r\nthey are wont to remark that it is going to drink the “se ni vota,” that\r\nis, to suck the flowers of the Vota tree. It is very likely that seeds\r\nwould sometimes be carried in their fur for considerable distances.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Begonia_\r\n\r\nBefore the discovery of Hillebrandia, a new genus of the Begoniaceæ, in\r\nHawaii, the order was not known from Polynesia. However, in 1878 Mr.\r\nHorne collected a species of Begonia in Fiji, and it was probably this\r\nspecies that frequently came under my notice in the rain-forests of the\r\nVanua Levu mountains. In 1883 I collected a Begonia in the Solomon\r\nIslands, which I gave to Baron F. von Mueller, who informed me that it\r\nwas the first record of the genus east of New Guinea, the description of\r\nMr. Horne’s Fijian plant apparently not having been published (see\r\nGuppy’s _Solomon Islands_, p. 288). It is not easy to explain why a\r\ngenus with such minute seeds, which are apparently as well fitted for\r\ndispersal as those of the orchids, should have such a limited\r\ndistribution in the Pacific.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Dolicholobium_ (Rubiaceæ)\r\n\r\nIn the _Index Kewensis_ this genus, containing five species, is\r\nrestricted to Fiji. It must, however, be more generally distributed in\r\nthe Western Pacific, since the genus was identified at Kew among my\r\nSolomon Island collections, and it is recorded in the list given in my\r\nbook on that group (pages 283, 288, 297).\r\n\r\nThe showy, large, white, fragrant flowers of these small trees recall\r\nthose of Lindenia, with which Dolicholobium is often associated in Fiji\r\nby the sides of streams and rivers. As Horne observes, the Fijian\r\nDolicholobiums range from the sea-shores and the heads of the estuaries\r\nto the tops of the highest mountains. As noticed by me in the Solomon\r\nIslands they affected the same station, being especially common on the\r\nbanks of streams. The genus has a long, narrow capsule six inches or\r\nmore in length. The linear seeds, though very light, are an inch or more\r\nlong, the coats being drawn out into a long tail at either end, and thus\r\ndiffering greatly from those of Lindenia, the other Rubiaceous genus,\r\nwith which these plants are so frequently associated at the river-side.\r\nI can only suppose that the seeds are transported by the winds. The\r\nhistory of the genus is suggested in my remarks on Lindenia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Lindenia_ (Rubiaceæ)\r\n\r\nRespecting its distribution in the Pacific, this genus of showy\r\nriver-side shrubs takes the same place amongst the plants that Galaxias\r\ntakes among the fishes. It is full of mystery. Of the four species\r\nknown, two grow on the river-banks of Central America and two in similar\r\nstations in the islands of the Western Pacific. Of the last-named both\r\noccur in New Caledonia, one of them being endemic, whilst the other,\r\nLindenia vitiensis, is found also in Fiji and Samoa. Reinecke seemingly\r\nrecords no Samoan species, but in the list of additions at the end of\r\nhis _Flora Vitiensis_, Seemann refers to the Fijian species as having\r\nbeen found in Samoa by Dr. Graeffe.\r\n\r\nLindenia vitiensis, as Horne aptly remarks, adorns the rocky banks of\r\nmany Fijian streams with its cream-coloured flowers, which impregnate\r\nthe air with their sweet odour. I found it in Vanua Levu, both at the\r\nheads of the estuaries and beside the stream and the torrent in the\r\nheart of the mountains. It was often associated with a species of\r\nDolicholobium, which it resembled strangely in its large, showy, scented\r\nflowers and in the form of the leaf. Seemann says it is also accompanied\r\nat the river-side in Viti Levu by Ficus bambusæfolia and Acalypha\r\nrivularis. It is noteworthy that all the four plants here mentioned as\r\nbeing associated river-side plants in Fiji possess the long, narrow\r\nleaves of the willow type, a subject that is discussed in note 79.\r\n\r\nThe capsules of Lindenia vitiensis contain numbers of small, angular\r\nseeds about 1·5 mm. across, some 400 of them when well dried going to a\r\ngrain. The seeds float buoyantly by reason of their outer covering of\r\ncrisp, air-bearing, cellular tissue. When this outer covering is\r\nstripped off, the minute nucleus, or seed proper, which is barely a\r\nmillimetre across and is but slightly protected, sinks at once. As the\r\nseeds float on the surface of a stream they might readily get on the\r\nplumage of an aquatic bird; but they have no special means of\r\nattachment; though, if they dried on the feathers they might adhere to\r\nsome extent. That they could be carried in mud adhering to a bird across\r\nan ocean’s breadth I think most unlikely; and it should be remembered in\r\nthis connection that only the dead or sickly seeds would be found at the\r\nbottom of a stream.\r\n\r\nThe most reasonable explanation of the extraordinary distribution of\r\nLindenia is that it was in a past age found over the tropical regions of\r\nboth America and the Old World, and that it has died out over the\r\ngreater part of its original area. To study the means of dispersal of\r\nplants with such a distribution seems almost futile. I am inclined to\r\nthink that the limited range of Dolicholobium, so frequently its\r\nstation-companion in Fiji, may be similarly explained.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Limnanthemum_ (Gentianaceæ)\r\n\r\nThis interesting genus of aquatic plants is dispersed over the tropical\r\nand temperate regions of the globe, but with the exception of Fiji and\r\nthe New Hebrides it is not found in oceanic groups, though it occurs in\r\nlarge continental islands like New Caledonia and Cuba. About twenty\r\nspecies are enumerated in the _Index Kewensis_, but it is stated in the\r\n_Genera Plantarum_ that they can probably be reduced to ten, the\r\nreduction being chiefly applicable to the tropical species, nearly all\r\nof which are reducible to varieties of L. indicum, the temperate species\r\nbeing often very distinct. It would thus appear that although dispersal\r\nis still active in the tropics, it is in part suspended in the temperate\r\nzone, and we seem to possess in L. indicum a typical polymorphous\r\nspecies that has played the _rôle_ of Naias marina in the warm, fresh\r\nwaters of the globe (see page 368).\r\n\r\nAlthough some of the temperate species, like Limnanthemum nymphæoides in\r\nEurope and Northern Asia, have a wide range, it is probable that this is\r\nconnected not so much with means of dispersal, as with its relation to\r\npresent and past drainage-areas. Rivers in the lapse of ages change\r\ntheir courses and carry their aquatic floras with them, leaving,\r\nhowever, a few of their plants around the springs and in the lakes which\r\nserve still as centres of dispersal. Rivers may even exchange their\r\nplants in flood-time in extensive level districts. Nor is the occurrence\r\nof the genus in the Old and New Worlds in the northern hemisphere to be\r\nconnected with questions of dispersal across an ocean. Except in the\r\ncase of small-seeded plants, like Nasturtium and Lythrum, where the\r\ndispersal could be carried on by water-fowl, the plant-species being\r\noften identical on both sides of the Atlantic, it is probable that most\r\nof the large-seeded river-side genera common to Europe and North\r\nAmerica, such as Iris and Acorus, had in past ages their home in the\r\nextreme north, whence the plants spread as from a focus into the\r\ncontinents of America and Eurasia. It is also to be doubted whether even\r\nin the tropics there has been much over-sea dispersal of Limnanthemum\r\nwithout the aid of man, and reasons will be given for the belief that\r\nprobably in Fiji, in the New Hebrides, and in New Caledonia the seeds of\r\nthe first plants were unintentionally introduced by the aborigines.\r\n\r\nFollowing Bentham we may regard the species of the Western Pacific\r\nIslands as a form of the wide-ranging Limnanthemum indicum. These plants\r\nin Fiji do not play the part in river-vegetation that they do in the\r\ntemperate regions, as for instance in the Upper Thames. They are not\r\ncommon except in places, and seem to be chiefly confined to Viti Levu,\r\nparticularly to ponds in the Rewa delta, where their _rôle_ is that of\r\nan Indian tank plant. In the Rewa delta they may be sometimes seen\r\nthriving in brackish water having a density of 1·005.\r\n\r\nLooking at the mode of dispersal to which the Limnanthemums owe their\r\nexistence in the Western Pacific, we cannot disregard, especially in\r\nFiji, the possibility of the seeds having been unintentionally\r\ntransported by the natives when they carried in their migrations their\r\nedible tubers, such as Colocasia antiquorum, Alocasia indica, and\r\nCyrtosperma edulis, that are cultivated in wet places. It is in the\r\nponds around which these plants grow that the Limnanthemums thrive. The\r\nChinese, with their peculiar methods of cultivation, are now carrying\r\nwith them strange water-plants over the warmer regions of the globe; and\r\nit would be surprising if the Pacific islanders in their migrations did\r\nnot do the same. If such an introduction, however, took place, it must\r\nhave happened before the time of Captain Cook, when the plant was found\r\nin New Caledonia. (It may be remarked in this connection that the seeds\r\nof the genus will germinate after being kept dry for years. Seeds of the\r\nBritish species which I had kept dry for two and a half years germinated\r\nhealthily when placed in water.)\r\n\r\nSome years ago I ascertained that the seeds of the British plants were\r\nenabled, by means of their fringe of hairs, to attach themselves firmly\r\nto the downy plumage of a bird’s breast. This could not happen with the\r\nFijian plant as the seeds are naked, and the same may be said of some\r\nspecies described by Gray and Chapman as widely spread over the United\r\nStates. The seeds of the genus appear quite unsuited for safe transport\r\ninside the body of a bird. The Fijians give the plants a variety of\r\nnames, nearly all of which are associated with the word for a duck, and\r\nnone of them bear an ancient impress. Thus we find such names as\r\n“Ndambe-ndambe-ni-nga” and “Vothe-vothe-ni-nga,” meaning respectively\r\n“the duck’s seat” and “the duck’s paddle.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Ceratophyllum demersum_\r\n\r\nThis wonderful aquatic has been dispersed over most of the globe; but I\r\nwill only mention its occurrence in oceanic islands, such as Fiji,\r\nSamoa, the Bermudas, and the Azores, to indicate the necessity of\r\nattributing its distribution in islands to birds. Several years ago I\r\nmade a careful study in England of the habits and mode of germination of\r\nthis plant, the results of which are given in _Science Gossip_ for\r\nNovember, 1894; but reference can only be made here to such points as\r\nbear on the occurrence of the plant in the Pacific islands.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that in our English ponds and rivers the plant\r\npropagates itself, as a rule, by budding; and that it is only in\r\nunusually hot and dry summers, such as that of 1893, when many ponds\r\nbecame very low and were excessively heated, that the fruits mature in\r\nany quantity. My observations clearly showed that a higher temperature\r\nis required for the completion of maturation than for the early stage of\r\nthe fruiting process and for the flowering. After a comparison of my\r\nriver and pond temperatures, I formed the conclusion that whilst in\r\nwater 12 to 18 inches deep this plant requires for a week or more an\r\naverage daily maximum water temperature of 70° F. to produce its\r\nflowers, a warmth of 80° and over is necessary to mature its fruit, a\r\ncondition to be found in England only in shallow ponds, where the plants\r\nmay fruit abundantly, but not in rivers, where they flower and rarely\r\nmature the fruit (see also for the thermometric conditions my paper in\r\n_Proc. Roy. Phys. Soc. Edin._, xii, 296). Since a yet lower temperature\r\n(an average maximum water temperature of 66° for a week or more) is\r\nsufficient for germination, it follows that the thermal conditions of\r\nour English climate will allow Ceratophyllum to germinate and to flower,\r\nthough but rarely to mature the fruit.\r\n\r\nEven in Fiji we can notice the distinction between the cooler river and\r\nthe superheated ponds and swamps of the Rewa delta as regards the\r\nmaturation of the fruit. In 1897 I found Ceratophyllum thriving in the\r\nmain channel of the Lower Rewa where the water was quite fresh; whilst\r\nlower down where the water was often brackish its place was taken by\r\nRuppia maritima. In the main river, where the water unmixed with\r\nsea-water rarely acquires a temperature of 80° F., the reading being\r\nusually 78° to 79°, I never found the plants in fruit, and it is only in\r\nthe superheated shallow waters of the swamps and back-waters that they\r\nmature their fruits.\r\n\r\nSince Ceratophyllum even in tropical climates would probably only mature\r\nits fruits in the superheated waters of shallow ponds, tanks, and\r\nditches, it follows that its dispersal by birds is confined to warm\r\nregions. In the cold waters of the Siberian lakes and rivers it would\r\nnever mature its seeds, and could only be propagated by budding. If it\r\nexisted in the head-springs of the sources of a river in these\r\nlatitudes, it would be distributed by means of its floating shoots and\r\nfragments along the length of the river basin, and in the times of flood\r\nit might pass in the lower plains from one river system to another. When\r\nrivers changed their courses it would be left behind in the lakes and\r\nponds and springs, and would also be carried away to the new region. In\r\nthis manner it would in the course of ages be distributed over a\r\ncontinent without the aid of seed, propagating itself in a vegetative\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nIn the case of oceanic islands, however, we have to appeal to the seed.\r\nSince the fruits sink in sea-water even after prolonged drying, and\r\nsince a few days’ immersion in sea-water, as I found, kills the floating\r\nplant, we are driven to the agency of birds. The fruits, which without\r\nappendages are a quarter of an inch (6 mm.) in length, are too large and\r\nheavy to be carried in dry mud adhering to birds. The chances of their\r\nbecoming entangled in a bird’s feathers by means of their basal spines\r\nand terminal style seem small, since they would be lying usually on the\r\nmud under the water. They are quite fitted for safe transport in the\r\nstomach and intestines of birds, such as is established in Chapter\r\nXXXIII for Potamogeton and Sparganium in the case of ducks. As my\r\nexperiments show, drying for a period of three months does not injure\r\nthe germinating capacity of the seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Dracontomelon_ (Anacardiaceæ)\r\n\r\nThis is a genus accredited in the _Index Kewensis_ with eight species,\r\nof which three belong to Borneo, one to Sumatra, one to Java, one to the\r\nPhilippines, and two to Fiji, all the species being restricted in their\r\nrange. My observations were confined to D. vitiense, Engler (D.\r\nsylvestre in Seemann’s work), the Tarawau of the Fijians, who regard it\r\nas a tree that is planted by the dead in Naithombothombo, the place of\r\ndeparted spirits, according to the legend given by Hazlewood in his\r\nFijian Dictionary. Its method of dissemination in the Fijian forests is,\r\nhowever, far more prosaic. Pigs and fruit-pigeons assist in the\r\ndispersal of the seeds in these islands. Pigs are often found in the\r\nvicinity of a Tarawau tree; and evidently they much appreciate the\r\nfallen fleshy fruits, which are about 1-1/3 inch (3·3 cm.) across and\r\ninclose a large stone 7/8 inch (2·2 cm.) in diameter. The entire fruit\r\nand the detached stone sink in sea-water, the last floating only a few\r\nhours, even after drying for four years. Mr. Hemsley regards the genus\r\nas probably dispersed by the currents, since a stone was found amongst\r\nthe floating drift collected by the _Challenger_ Expedition off the\r\ncoast of New Guinea. The stone, however, is described as seedless, which\r\nmay explain its buoyancy. It is, however, to the fruit-pigeon that we\r\nmust look for the dispersal of this genus. In the crop of one of these\r\nbirds shot in Fiji I found the entire fruit of a Tarawau tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Canarium_ (Burseraceæ)\r\n\r\nThis genus of trees, to which nearly a hundred species are referred in\r\nthe _Index Kewensis_, belongs mainly to tropical Asia and Malaya, a few\r\nspecies occurring in tropical Africa, Madagascar, the Mascarene Islands,\r\nand Polynesia. Its great home is in Malaya, to which two-thirds of the\r\nspecies are confined; but its distribution in the oceanic islands of the\r\nIndian and Pacific Oceans is especially interesting, Mauritius, Bourbon,\r\nFiji, Tonga, and Samoa (Horne) each possessing a species.\r\n\r\nThe large drupes of the genus, as I found in Fiji, have no capacity for\r\ndispersal by currents; and we are, therefore, compelled to appeal to the\r\nagency of the frugivorous bird. Yet to a person unaccustomed to the ways\r\nof fruit-pigeons the transportation across a broad tract of ocean of\r\nlarge heavy “stones,” an inch and more in size, would seem impossible;\r\nand even to a student of dispersal improbable. Unless, however, we\r\nprefer to accept the Lemurian theory for the Indian Ocean and the theory\r\nof a Melanesian continent for the Pacific we are compelled to appeal to\r\nthese birds; and it can scarcely be said that our appeal is without some\r\njustification. Both in the Solomon Islands and in the Fijis I was\r\nfamiliar with the dispersal of the stones of these trees by\r\nfruit-pigeons; and Wallace, amongst other writers, observed the same\r\nlong ago in the Malayan Islands (_Malay Archipelago_). Stones obtained\r\nfrom the crops of Fijian pigeons measured 1-2/10 × 1 inch (3 × 2·5 cm.).\r\nIn the Solomon Islands these birds stock the interior of the coral\r\nislets with trees of the genus, and the ground below the trees is often\r\nstrewn with the disgorged stones (_Bot. Chall. Exped._, iv, 310; Guppy’s\r\n_Solomon Islands_, p. 85).\r\n\r\nAlthough the difficulty concerned with the transport of the seeds across\r\na broad tract of ocean seems very great, it is quite possible that\r\nfurther investigation will enable us to overcome this objection, just as\r\nwe have done in Chapter XXVI when explaining how the genus Elæocarpus\r\nmay have reached Hawaii. It is, indeed, not unlikely that, as with\r\nElæocarpus, the stones of the drupes may in some species be much smaller\r\nand far more fitted for being carried in a bird’s body over several\r\nhundred miles of ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Couthovia_ (Loganiaceæ)\r\n\r\nReference is here made to this genus because its mode of dispersal is\r\nknown, and because I was familiar with it in Fiji. Seemann gives two\r\nspecies for Fiji, C. corynocarpa and C. seemanni, and the few other\r\nspecies known seem to be confined to the Western Pacific. Solereder\r\ngives a third species, C. densiflora, for Kaiser-Wilhelmsland in New\r\nGuinea (Engler’s _Pflanz. Fam._ teil 4, abth. 2); and a Solomon Island\r\nspecies, nearly allied to, if not a variety of, the Fijian species, C.\r\nseemanni, is referred to in the list of plants from that group given in\r\nmy book on those islands. I found C. corynocarpa not infrequently\r\ngrowing on the banks of small rivers in the heart of Vanua Levu. Its\r\ndrupes, which float for a few days in sea-water, are, according to\r\nSeemann, eaten by fruit-pigeons. The “stone” varies from 2 to 4\r\ncentimetres (3/4 - 1-1/2 inch) in length; and from the standpoint of\r\ndispersal the genus ranks with Canarium and Dracontomelon. Seemann\r\ndescribes and figures this species, which was constituted by Gray, in\r\nhis _Flora Vitiensis_; but, apparently through an error, it is in the\r\n_Index Kewensis_ accredited to Hawaii. Hillebrand makes no reference to\r\nthe genus in his book on the Hawaiian flora.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Veitchia_ (Palmaceæ)\r\n\r\nThis genus of palms is closely allied to Ptychosperma, a Malayan genus\r\nalso represented in Fiji. The _Index Kewensis_ names four species, one\r\nNew Hebridean, and three Fijian. The fruits of two of the last-named\r\nspecies tested by me had no floating power. The seed is about an inch\r\nlong, and the genus would be likely to be spread by fruit-pigeons. From\r\nthe standpoint of dispersal the genus would be placed with Canarium and\r\nCouthovia; but possibly its presence in the Pacific may be indicative of\r\nan ancient Western Pacific continent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Hibbertia_ (Dilleniaceæ)\r\n\r\nThis genus of some eighty known species is almost entirely Australian,\r\nwith the exception of a few species found in New Caledonia, Tasmania,\r\nand apparently also in the Mascarene Islands. Horne was the first to\r\nrecord a species from Fiji, where it grows commonly in the “talasinga”\r\nplains on the lee sides of the islands, and also on the scantily\r\nvegetated mountain summits. In Vanua Levu I often found these plants\r\ngrowing on the rocky peaks of the highest mountains of the island, as on\r\nMbatini, 3,500 feet, and on Mariko, 2,900 feet. Their presence on these\r\nisolated peaks can only be attributed to birds. The carpels contain one\r\nor two seeds, which have a membranous aril; but in the plains the seeds\r\nare usually destroyed by grubs.\r\n\r\n\r\n               _Myrmecodia_ and _Hydnophytum_ (Rubiaceæ)\r\n\r\nThese two genera of epiphytes, distributed over Malaya and extending to\r\nthe islands of the Western Pacific, possess tuber-like stems, which are\r\nextensively chambered by ants that find a home in the interior. They\r\nwere familiar to me in the Solomon Islands, where they frequently grow\r\non the mangroves and on other littoral trees. They do not form such a\r\nfeature in the shore vegetation of Fiji, and judging from the\r\nobservations of Dr. Seemann and myself they occur most often on the\r\nwooded mountain-peaks. The berries of these plants would attract\r\nfrugivorous birds; and their pyrenes, which in a Fijian Myrmecodia I\r\nfound to be 4 millimetres long, appear quite suitable for dispersal\r\nthrough this agency. It would seem that germination may occur in the\r\nberry on the plant. A specimen of Myrmecodia in fruit, that had been\r\nlying overlooked for a fortnight between newspapers during one of my\r\nmountain journeys, displayed on examination the pyrenes in a germinating\r\ncondition, the process being subsequently completed. The reader will\r\nfind these interesting plants described and illustrated in the English\r\nedition of Schimper’s work on _Plant-Geography_, pp. 149, 150.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Myristica_\r\n\r\nThe Nutmeg trees, though principally at home in Indo-Malaya, are found\r\nalso in the warm regions of Africa and America, as well as in the\r\nislands of the Western Pacific from the Solomon group eastward to Fiji,\r\nTonga, and Samoa. The Tongan and Samoan groups possess two species in\r\ncommon, whilst Fiji seems to possess its own species, four or five in\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of this genus have long been known to be dispersed by\r\nfruit-pigeons. Mr. Moseley, in his _Notes of a Naturalist_, and in the\r\n_Journal of the Linnean Society_ (vol. xv), tells us how at one time\r\nthese birds in their dissemination of the seeds in the Banda Islands\r\nwere active opponents of the policy of the Dutch Government in\r\npreserving their monopoly of the cultivation of the nutmeg of commerce.\r\nHe found numbers of wild nutmegs in the crops of these birds in the\r\nAdmiralty Islands, some of which were partially digested and others\r\nseemingly sound; and Mr. Hemsley includes the genus as amongst those\r\ndispersed in the Western Pacific by birds (_Bot. Chall. Exped._, Introd.\r\n46; iv, 229, 308). In my book on the Solomon Islands I refer to the\r\noccurrence of these seeds in the crops of fruit-pigeons; and I found\r\nthat the seeds were similarly dispersed by these birds in Fiji. It is\r\nlikely that the absence of the genus from Eastern Polynesia is to be\r\npartially connected with the insufficient protection of the seeds\r\nagainst injury during such a long ocean passage in a bird’s body.\r\n\r\nGaudichaud, as quoted by Hemsley, refers to the occurrence of the fruits\r\nof three or four species of Myristica in the drift floating in the\r\nMolucca Sea. When in the Solomon Islands I noticed that the unopened\r\nfruits of a species floated in sea-water. In later years in Fiji I\r\ntested this point, and found that whilst the fruits just before\r\ndehiscing will float between three and seven days in sea-water, the\r\nseeds sink. As I have pointed out in the chapter on Drift, rivers carry\r\ndown to the sea an abundance of seeds and fruits that can float a few\r\ndays but do not imply dispersal by currents.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as I have above remarked, the localised range of the genus in\r\nPolynesia may be in part connected with the insufficient protection of\r\nthe seed, it is apparent that in the case of a genus found in Asia,\r\nAfrica, and America we are brought into contact with questions other\r\nthan those of means of dispersal. No one would pretend that Myristica\r\nseeds could be carried by birds uninjured across the Pacific Ocean; and\r\nto explain the present distribution of the genus we must recall cases of\r\na similar kind, such as Podocarpus, where the genus in past ages had a\r\nhome in the north, from which, as from a focus of dispersion, it\r\nextended into the continents of the Old and the New World (see p. 302).\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Rhaphidophora_ (Araceæ)\r\n\r\nThis genus of climbing aroids, which gives a character to the forests of\r\nIndo-Malaya as well as to those of the Western Pacific, is represented\r\nin the New Hebrides, Fiji, Tonga, and Rarotonga by a variety of the\r\nwidely spread R. pertusa that ranges over Indo-Malaya and Eastern\r\nAustralia. The ripe berries would readily attract birds; and the seeds,\r\n4·5 millimetres long in the case of a Fijian plant, appear hard enough\r\nto pass unharmed through a bird’s digestive canal. We seem here to have\r\nevidence of a somewhat recent connection between Indo-Malaya and\r\nPolynesia through the agency of frugivorous birds. That the genus has\r\nbeen long established in Polynesia is, however, indicated by the\r\noccurrence there of a species seemingly peculiar to Fiji. We are\r\ndisappointed that in Engler’s recent contribution to the _Pflanzenreich_\r\n(in his volume on the Araceæ-Pothoideæ) he has not been able to include\r\nthis genus in the field of his studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Gnetum_ (Gnetaceæ)\r\n\r\nThis Gymnospermous genus, which is found in the warm regions both of the\r\nOld and the New World, is represented in Fiji by a Malayan species,\r\nGnetum gnemon, which exists also in the Solomon group with other species\r\nof the genus (Guppy’s _Solomon Islands_, pp. 288, 301). I was familiar\r\nwith this species in both Fiji and the Solomon group; but in the\r\nfirst-named locality it is seemingly restricted to the borders of\r\nWainunu Bay on the south side of Vanua Levu, where Dr. Harvey first\r\nfound it. It grows there abundantly in young wood.\r\n\r\nIt seems almost idle to discuss the mode of dispersal of a genus that is\r\nplaced in a class apart with the African Welwitschia and the European\r\nEphedra, possessing with them a history of which we know nothing. Yet it\r\nis ranked by Mr. Hemsley amongst those genera that are dispersed in\r\nPolynesia by birds, and he produces better evidence in support of this\r\nview than we possess for many other plants. Thus a fruit of a species of\r\nGnetum, perhaps G. gnemon, has been found in a New Guinea fruit-pigeon;\r\nand the fruits of two species of the genus were found in the crops of\r\nfruit-pigeons shot by Mr. Moseley in the Admiralty Islands (_Bot. Chall.\r\nExped._, Introd. 46; iv, 308). The red drupes of Gnetum gnemon of Fiji\r\nwould readily attract birds, and their nut-like stones, about 8\r\nmillimetres long, are well suited for this mode of dispersal. My\r\nexperiments in Fiji show that neither the drupe nor the stone of this\r\nspecies floats in sea-water; and it is probable that the fruits of this\r\ngenus referred to by Mr. Hemsley as having been picked up on the beach\r\nin the Aru Islands possessed only a temporary buoyancy.\r\n\r\nThis genus presents us with the same puzzling question put to us by\r\nseveral Fijian genera, such as Myristica and Podocarpus, that occur in\r\nboth Asia and America; and until we answer that query it seems almost\r\nfutile to study modes of dispersal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Elatostema_ (Urticaceæ)\r\n\r\nThis genus of annual and perennial herbs belongs to the tropical regions\r\nof the Old World. It is represented in Samoa by fifteen known species\r\nand by at least four or five in Fiji, whilst with the exception of a\r\nsolitary Tahitian species it is not recorded from East Polynesia.\r\nReference is here made to it particularly on account of its great\r\ndevelopment in Samoa. We have here a genus that, like Psychotria in Fiji\r\nand Cyrtandra in Fiji, Samoa, and Hawaii, runs riot in respect to the\r\nproduction of species (see p. 317). Dr. Reinecke describes fifteen\r\nSamoan species, of which, with the exception of two found in Malaya, all\r\nseem to be described for the first time. So sensitive, he remarks, is\r\nthe genus to external conditions that station-forms abound; and he\r\npoints out that if we were to follow the dividing lines usually\r\nrecognised between species, we should account every station-form a new\r\nspecies. It is, of course, obvious that the polymorphism of the Samoan\r\nElatostemas depends primarily not on the varying influence of station\r\nbut on their sensitiveness to external conditions. One might put the\r\nquestion to the Samoan Elatostemas that Hillebrand put to the Hawaiian\r\nCyrtandras, and ask why nature in this particular genus in this\r\nparticular locality thus luxuriates in formative energy. Almost every\r\nPacific group in respect of some of its plants presents the problem so\r\nwell stated by Dr. Reinecke for this genus in Samoa. It is noteworthy\r\nthat Schimper, in his work on _Plant-Geography_ (English edition, pp.\r\n291, 297, 299), especially singles out Elatostema and Cyrtandra as\r\ngrowing socially in the tropical rain-forests of Java and of the Asiatic\r\nmainland.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _Scirpodendron costatum_ (Cyperaceæ)\r\n\r\nAs far as I can gather, this giant-sedge has not been previously\r\nrecorded from Fiji; but it is included in the Samoan flora, and has also\r\nbeen found at Penang and Singapore, as well as in Borneo, Java, and\r\nQueensland. In Samoa, as we learn from Reinecke, it grows both in the\r\ncoast swamps and on dry ground. In Fiji it is very common in the\r\nmangrove-swamps at the mouths of rivers, especially in the Lower Rewa;\r\nbut in Vanua Levu it is also frequent in the marshy localities of inland\r\nplateaux, 700 to 800 feet above the sea, as well as by the side of\r\nstreams in swampy districts on the lower hill slopes. This double\r\nstation in the salt-water swamp of the coast and in the fresh-water\r\nmarsh of the interior seems to be repeated in Java, where the plant was\r\nfirst discovered by Zippelius on the banks of torrents in mountainous\r\nregions and in swampy places.\r\n\r\nThe genus comprises, according to the _Index Kewensis_, only this\r\nspecies, though variations are to be observed in plants from different\r\nlocalities. The species was described by Kurz in the _Journal of the\r\nAsiatic Society of Bengal_ (vol. 38, 1869) and by Bentham in his _Flora\r\nAustraliensis_; and an illustration is given by Miquel in his\r\n_Illustrations de la Flore de l’Archipel Indien_ (1871). The plant is so\r\ncommon in Fiji that one can only suppose that its resemblance to a\r\nstemless Pandanus, from which, as Kurz observes, it is with difficulty\r\ndistinguished except when in flower or fruit, led to its being\r\noverlooked by both Seemann and Horne. Its leaves, from 9 to 12 feet in\r\nlength, are commonly used for making mats and for thatching, both in\r\nFiji and Samoa. The plant usually attains a height of 3 to 5 feet.\r\n\r\nThe fruits occur abundantly in the floating and stranded river and sea\r\ndrift in Fiji, a circumstance that led to my discovery of the parent\r\nplant in the swamps. The fruit, which is about half an inch (12 mm.)\r\nlong, consists of a hard, stony nut invested by a thick ribbed cork-like\r\ncovering, to which it owes its buoyancy, since the nut sinks. The\r\ndetached fruit is perforated at the base through both coverings, and\r\nonly a little soft tissue closes the aperture in the inner shell, the\r\nprotection against the entry of sea-water in the case of floating fruits\r\nbeing quite inadequate. This explains also why the stranded fruits were\r\nso frequently found by me germinating on the beach, where, as my\r\nobservations showed, they never established the plant. This early\r\ngermination would prove to be an advantage in the case of fruits\r\nstranded in a suitable locality.\r\n\r\nBut though the perforation in the fruit favours its early germination,\r\nit lessens its ability to withstand a long sea-passage without injury to\r\nthe embryo. I found in different experiments on fruits of plants growing\r\nin the mangrove swamps, that when placed in sea-water 40 per cent. sank\r\nduring the first fortnight, whilst 15 per cent. floated after five or\r\nsix weeks, but all were at the bottom in two months. On the other hand,\r\nfruits from plants of the swamps of the inland plateaux displayed much\r\nfeebler floating power, in some cases sinking at once, in others\r\nfloating for a few days, and in others again floating for a week or two.\r\nIn this case the outer cork-like covering proved to have lost most of\r\nits floating power.\r\n\r\nFrom the number of empty seed-vessels found, both in the floating and\r\nstranded drift, it appeared evident that the seed had often rotted away\r\nduring the flotation. It is apparent from these observations and\r\nexperiments that Scirpodendron costatum is not suited for dispersal by\r\ncurrents over wide tracts of ocean. The fruits might be able to float\r\nunharmed for a few weeks, but they would be unable to accomplish much\r\nmore than the 500 or 600 miles intervening between Fiji and the nearest\r\ngroups to the west.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Lemnaceæ_\r\n\r\nThis order, judging from the writings of Hegelmaier, Schenck, and\r\nHemsley, is represented by one or other of the common species, Lemna\r\nminor, L. gibba, L. polyrrhiza, in various Atlantic islands, as in the\r\nBermudas, the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands, and St. Helena; but\r\ndoubts frequently arise as to their being truly indigenous. Lemna\r\ntrisulca is regarded by Hemsley as indigenous in the Bermudas. Lemna\r\nminor has been introduced in recent years into Hawaii, where I observed\r\nit flowering and sometimes fruiting abundantly in the heated waters of\r\nthe ponds. Two species found in other regions were recorded by Seemann\r\nfrom Fiji, and I have come upon few other records of the occurrence of\r\nthe order in the tropical islands of the open Pacific. I am inclined to\r\nthe opinion, based not only on the facts of distribution, but also on\r\nthe results of numerous experiments on the means of dispersal, that this\r\norder has in most cases reached oceanic islands with man’s assistance.\r\n\r\nSome years ago I made a systematic study of the habits of the British\r\nLemnæ, most of the results being published in the _Linnean Society’s\r\nJournal_ (vols. xxix and xxx), as far as concerned Lemna minor, L.\r\ngibba, and L. polyrrhiza. During this inquiry I ascertained that with\r\nthese species, as well as with L. trisulca, the chances of a bird’s\r\ncarrying their fronds uninjured in its plumage over a wide extent of\r\nocean were small. None of them survived twenty-four hours’ drying in\r\nfine weather, whether in the sun or in the shade; but in rainy weather\r\nthey withstand an exposure of one or two days. It is, therefore,\r\nunlikely, even if the fronds were entangled by their rootlets in a\r\nbird’s feathers, that they would be able under ordinary conditions to\r\nreproduce the plants after a day’s flight of some five hundred miles\r\nacross the sea. It must also be remembered that the drying capacity of\r\nthe air when a bird is in full flight in ordinary weather would be that\r\ndisplayed during a gale of wind with a velocity of at least thirty to\r\nforty miles an hour. For this reason I do not think with Kerner that\r\nunder usual conditions drops of water would be a factor of importance in\r\ncausing the adherence of minute seeds of any kind to birds’ plumage.\r\nWhere the seeds are not available, it is most probable that birds\r\ndisperse the duckweeds by their fronds over short distances, but not\r\nacross broad seas. This would certainly apply to temperate latitudes,\r\nwhere these plants rarely seed. Thus with Lemna, as with Ceratophyllum,\r\nit would seem that the dispersal of the seeds by birds takes place\r\nnormally only in warm latitudes. Those of the duckweeds could be\r\ntransported in adherent mud over land-areas.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hegelmaier, the two species of Lemna found in Fiji are L.\r\npaucicostata, an Asiatic species, and a variety of an Australian\r\nspecies, L. oligorrhiza, possessing dark root-sheaths. These plants\r\nmostly came under my notice in the Rewa delta. They were rarely seen in\r\nVanua Levu, where in one locality I found the typical Lemna minor. The\r\nfirst species is also Samoan.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 and in 1899, in a pool near Notho in the Rewa delta, in Viti\r\nLevu, Fiji, I found a great abundance of a species of Wolffia, specimens\r\nof which were sent to Prof. Schimper with my mangrove collections, but\r\nhis death intervened, and I have not been able to follow up the matter.\r\nOn comparing the specimens with Hegelmaier’s descriptions and plates, it\r\nwould seem that the species is near W. arrhiza and W. brasiliensis, but\r\ndiffers from both in the greater length of the fronds. As concerning the\r\nmeans of dispersal of the genus, I may add that the fronds were killed\r\nafter being allowed to dry for eighteen hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Marsilea_ (Marsileaceæ)\r\n\r\nA species of this genus, apparently near Marsilea villosa, was common in\r\nthe ditches and ponds around Notho, in the Rewa delta, Fiji, in 1897-99.\r\nThe genus is included by Horne in his list of Fijian plants; but is not\r\ngiven by Seemann. The villous sporocarps, when dry, are very light and\r\nreadily catch in cloth and in feathers. Hillebrand includes in the\r\nHawaiian flora M. villosa and M. crenulata. The first-named, which was\r\ncollected by Chamisso and Gaudichaud, finds (he says on the authority of\r\nBraun) its nearest relative in a species from Oregon and California. The\r\nother has been collected in the Liukiu Islands, the Philippines,\r\nMauritius, and Bourbon. It is very probable that the occurrence of the\r\ngenus in oceanic islands is due to the agency of birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Summary of the Chapter_\r\n\r\n(1) We are here concerned with the more restricted distribution of\r\nnon-endemic tropical genera over the Pacific. The general trend eastward\r\nof these genera is well brought out in the fact that whilst Fiji\r\npossesses some sixty or seventy genera in common with Tahiti to the\r\nexclusion of Hawaii, it does not possess a score in common with Hawaii\r\nto the exclusion of Tahiti. The grasses and sedges and the mountain\r\ngenera are not here included; and we are comparing the flora of the\r\nHawaiian lowlands below 4,000 feet with the floras in mass of Fiji and\r\nTahiti.\r\n\r\n(2) Hawaii possesses very few genera (less than thirty) that are not\r\nfound either in Fiji or in Tahiti, or in both; and of these quite a\r\nthird are to be traced to America.\r\n\r\n(3) From two of these genera, Embelia, a land genus, and Naias, an\r\naquatic genus, we obtain two important indications, namely, that\r\nspecific differentiation has taken place to much the same extent in a\r\nwater plant as in a land plant, whether in a continent or in an island.\r\nIn other words, new species have been developed or are developing\r\nindependently of the immediate environment and of isolating influences.\r\n\r\n(4) The interchange of plants between the regions of Hawaii and Tahiti\r\nto the exclusion of Fiji has been very slight. Probably not half a dozen\r\ngenera belong to this category.\r\n\r\n(5) Excluding plants brought by man and by the currents, Tahiti\r\npossesses very few that present any difficulty from the standpoint of\r\ndispersal, plants with seeds or “stones” an inch in size being, as a\r\nrule, absent.\r\n\r\n(6) With the genera (60-70) common to Fiji and Tahiti, and distributed,\r\ntherefore, over the South Pacific, the wide-ranging highly variable\r\nplant is an important factor in the development of peculiar species in\r\nthe different groups, just as it has been shown to be in the previous\r\nchapter in the case of genera dispersed over the whole Pacific. The\r\n_rôle_ of the polymorphous species has always been an important one in\r\nthis region.\r\n\r\n(7) In the case of several Fijian genera it seems almost futile to talk\r\nof existing means of dispersal, since the present distribution of genera\r\nlike Sterculia and Gnetum, that occur on both sides of the Pacific, in\r\nAmerica and in Asia, is not to be thus explained.\r\n\r\n(8) On account of the large size of their seeds and “stones” it might be\r\nargued that certain of the Fijian plants afford evidence of a previous\r\ncontinental condition of the islands of the Western Pacific, since it is\r\nnot easy to understand how such large seeds and “stones” could have been\r\ntransported over broad seas by birds. It is, however, pointed out that\r\nin these respects the species of a genus may vary greatly, and that the\r\nseeds and stones may be large in some species and small in others.\r\n\r\n(9) The greater number of the genera that have entered the Pacific from\r\nthe Old World have not advanced eastward of the Fijian region, half of\r\nthe Fijian genera not occurring in the Hawaiian and Tahitian regions;\r\nand the explanation of this is to be found not in any lack of capacities\r\nfor dispersal, but in a want of opportunities. The story of\r\nplant-distribution in the Pacific is bound up with the successive stages\r\nof decreasing activity in the dispersing agencies. The area of active\r\ndispersion that at first comprised the whole of the tropical Pacific was\r\nafterwards restricted to the South Pacific, and finally to the Western\r\nPacific only. The birds that in an early age carried seeds all over this\r\nocean became more and more restricted in their ranges, probably on\r\naccount of increasing diversity of climatic conditions. The plants of\r\nnecessity responded to the ever narrowing conditions of bird-life in\r\nthis ocean, and the differentiation of the plant and of the bird have\r\ntaken place together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n                     THE POLYNESIAN AND HIS PLANTS\r\n\r\nIdentity of the problems presented by the indigenous plants and the\r\n  peoples of the Pacific islands.—The food-plants of the Polynesians and\r\n  the pre-Polynesians.—Their weeds.—The aboriginal weeds.—The white\r\n  man’s weeds.—Weeds follow the cultivator but are distributed by\r\n  birds.—The general dispersion of weeds antedates the appearance of the\r\n  Polynesian in the Pacific.—Weeds of little value to the\r\n  ethnologist.—Aleurites moluccana.—Inocarpus edulis, Gyrocarpus\r\n  Jacquini, Serianthes myriadenia, Leucæna Forsteri, Mussænda frondosa,\r\n  Luffa insularum.—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MAN AND THE SEED\r\n\r\nMAN in his distribution in the islands of the Pacific reproduces in a\r\nminor degree nearly all the difficulties presented there by plants,\r\nbirds, and other forms of animal life. Like the plant he entered the\r\nocean from the west; and as with the plants, so with the aborigines,\r\nthere was an era of general dispersion over this ocean, followed by an\r\nage in which Polynesian man, ceasing to migrate, tended to settle down\r\nin the several groups, there undergoing differentiation in various\r\nrespects, as in physical characters, in language, and in manners. Just\r\nas we can now recognise the type of a plant, of a bird, or of an insect,\r\nthat belongs to a particular group of islands, so we can distinguish\r\nbetween the Hawaiian, the Tahitian, and the Maori, whether in physical\r\ncharacters, in his speech, or in his customs. Fiji possesses in the\r\nPapuan element of its Melanesian population the earliest type of man in\r\nthe Pacific, just as it also possesses in the Coniferæ the most ancient\r\ntypes of trees in this region. Divesting his mind of all previous\r\nconceptions, the ethnologist, as I have remarked in my discussion of the\r\ndistribution of Freycinetia in Chapter XXV, might profitably study _de\r\nnovo_ the dispersion of man in the Pacific from the standpoint of\r\nplant-dispersal.\r\n\r\nMan and the seed have battled their way over the Pacific apparently in\r\ndefiance of the prevailing winds and currents, and both have failed to\r\nreach the New World. Man in the Pacific is almost as enigmatical as the\r\nplant. As a denizen of this region he is by no means a recent\r\nintroduction; and though his food-plants are mainly Asiatic, they belong\r\nto distinct ages in the history of man’s occupation of these islands.\r\n\r\nI venture to think that a great deal lies behind the Indo-Malayan mask\r\nof the Polynesian, and that there is a story concerned with his origin\r\nthat has yet to be told. We have by no means solved the riddle when by\r\nfollowing the evidence we assign to him a home in Asia. It is only then\r\nthat the real difficulties begin. It required many centuries of European\r\ncivilisation for the discovery of America; but the voyages of Columbus\r\nsink into insignificance when we reflect on what had been dared and\r\naccomplished by uncivilised man when he first landed on the shores of\r\nHawaii and Tahiti.\r\n\r\nThe problem of man in the Pacific bristles with difficulties differing\r\nin degree but not in kind from those relating to the flora. Whenever a\r\nparticular theory seems on the point of being well established, some\r\ndisturbing question arises, and as with the plant, we are never able to\r\npush our facts quite home. Since I first visited the Solomon Islands,\r\nnow twenty-four years ago, the Pacific islander and his flora have\r\ndeeply interested me. The history of man and of the plant cannot be\r\nseparated in the Pacific; and the same determining principles of\r\ndistribution have affected both.\r\n\r\n\r\n         THE FOOD-PLANTS OF THE POLYNESIANS AND PRE-POLYNESIANS\r\n\r\nOne can imperfectly distinguish two sets of food-plants in this region;\r\nthe first comprising such plants as Pachyrrhizus trilobus, Tacca\r\npinnatifida, Amorphophallus campanulatus, the Mountain Bananas, the Wild\r\nYams, and several others that grow wild, and, as a rule, only serve as\r\nfood in times of scarcity; the second including the plants that are\r\nextensively cultivated by the present islanders, such as the Breadfruit,\r\nthe Banana (Musa paradisiaca), the Taro (Colocasia antiquorum) and the\r\ntwo Yams (Dioscorea alata and D. sativa), &c. Those of the first set\r\nprobably formed the food of the earliest inhabitants of the Pacific\r\nIslands, pre-Polynesian peoples that practised only a rude sort of\r\ncultivation, as with the present “bush-men” of the islands of the\r\nWestern Pacific. Those of the second set belong to the later occupants\r\nof these islands, the Polynesians.\r\n\r\n(a) _The Pre-Polynesian food-plants._—In addition to those above named\r\none may mention Cycas circinalis, Cyrtosperma edulis, Lablab vulgaris,\r\nPandanus odoratissimus, Saccharum officinarum, Sagus vitiensis, &c.\r\nInocarpus edulis is probably to be here included, and amongst the Wild\r\nYams should be named Dioscorea nummularia and D. pentaphylla. Some of\r\nthem are now occasionally cultivated; but most of them only occur in the\r\nwild condition, either as weeds or as larger plants growing\r\nspontaneously in uncultivated localities. Even the knowledge of them as\r\nfood-plants has sometimes been altogether lost, the present inhabitants\r\nof the Fijis, for instance, knowing nothing of Lablab vulgaris and Sagus\r\nvitiensis as sources of food. The question of the antiquity of the\r\nCoco-nut Palm in Polynesia was discussed at length by Seemann; but for\r\nvarious reasons we cannot be absolutely certain whether or not it is an\r\nolder denizen of the Pacific islands than the Polynesian. It is,\r\nhowever, to be inferred that it came originally from the home of the\r\ngenus in America, perhaps as a gift brought by the Equatorial Current\r\nfrom the New World to Asia. Several chapters might be devoted to the\r\ndiscussion of the earlier food-plants of these islanders; but here only\r\na brief reference can be made to a few of them.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the oldest of the earliest aboriginal food-plants are those\r\nthat, like Cyrtosperma edulis and Sagus vitiensis, are apparently\r\nconfined to Fiji. Here we seem to possess indications of the development\r\nof new species since that group was first occupied by man. Others, like\r\nPachyrrhizus trilobus and Cycas circinalis, that are restricted to the\r\ngroups of the Western Pacific may come next in relative antiquity.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the early food-plants hail from the Old World, the home\r\nof Pachyrrhizus is in America. One may indeed wonder how a plant with\r\nsuch a history ever reached the Western Pacific. It seems to be\r\ngenerally distributed in this part of the ocean, having been recorded\r\nfrom New Caledonia, the New Hebrides, Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa. Although\r\nits edible roots are only used in times of scarcity, the plant grows\r\nwild all over Fiji, being especially frequent in the “talasinga” plains.\r\nThough I searched diligently, it never presented me with its seed. In\r\nTonga, according to Graeffe (as quoted by Reinecke) the plant is much\r\nemployed in preparing the land for yam-cultivation, since it restrains\r\nthe growth of weeds and keeps the soil moist.\r\n\r\nAmongst the food-plants of this early period that are distributed over\r\nthe South Pacific as far east as Tahiti may be mentioned the Wild Yams\r\n(D. nummularia and D. pentaphylla), the Mountain Bananas, Tacca\r\npinnatifida, Amorphophallus campanulatus, and others. Of these Tacca\r\npinnatifida and Dioscorea pentaphylla are alone found in Hawaii. I will\r\nonly now refer to the Mountain Bananas.\r\n\r\nThe Mountain Bananas of the tropical South Pacific, distinguished by\r\ntheir erect fruit bunches and their seeded fruits, present us with one\r\nof the mysteries connected with aboriginal man in this ocean. Whether in\r\nNew Caledonia, Fiji, Samoa, Rarotonga, or in Tahiti, they grow wild in\r\nthe interior, and form often a conspicuous feature of the vegetation in\r\nthe mountains and at the heads of the valleys. They are occasionally\r\ncultivated. Their Fijian and Samoan names of “Soanga” and “Soa’a”\r\nreproduce the names of the banana, “Saguing” and “Saing” in the Tagalog\r\nlanguage of the Philippine Islands. The Tahitian appellation is “Fehi”\r\nor “Fei,” and this reappears in Samoa in the form of “Fa’i,” the word\r\nfor the common cultivated banana, Musa paradisiaca. The Rarotongan name\r\nof “Uatu,” as given by Cheeseman, is suggestive of the Micronesian form\r\n(Ut, Uut, &c., in the Carolines) of a widely spread banana word in\r\nMalaya, Melanesia, and West Polynesia (Fudi, Vundi, Undi, &c., &c.). It\r\nis not unlikely that all these South Pacific mountain bananas with erect\r\ninflorescences and seeded fruits belong to one species, variously\r\ndesignated by botanists as Musa fehi, M. uranoscopus, M. troglodytarum,\r\n&c., and confined to this region. Under the name of Musa fehi Schumann\r\nincludes the New Caledonian and Tahitian plants, and he views the Samoan\r\nplant as probably identical with them. This botanist, in his monograph\r\non the Musaceæ (Engler’s _Das Pflanzenreich_, 1900), establishes the\r\nhome of the bananas in tropical Asia, and considers that their\r\noccurrence in America before the time of Columbus has not been proved.\r\nBirds have no doubt often assisted in the dispersal of the wild, seeded\r\nplants; but it is likely that man is responsible for the occurrence of\r\nthe mountain forms in the Pacific, and probably their fruits formed when\r\ncooked one of the principal articles of diet of the earliest immigrants.\r\n(There evidently exists in Vanua Levu a plant very like the African Musa\r\nEnsete. Its presence was only indicated by the occurrence of its empty\r\nseeds in the stranded beach-drift, and reference is made to it in that\r\nconnection in Chapter XXIX.)\r\n\r\n(b) _The Polynesian food-plants._—The cultivation of the yams, the\r\ntaros, the breadfruits, and the bananas in later ages all over the\r\nPacific islands cannot here be dealt with. My readers will already know\r\nthat a very ancient cultivation is in each case indicated by the\r\noccurrence of a great number of varieties. Much has been written upon\r\nthis matter, and amongst the recent contributions to the subject may be\r\nreckoned Mr. Cheeseman’s interesting paper published in the\r\n_Transactions and Proceedings of the New Zealand Institute_ (vol.\r\nxxxiii).\r\n\r\nI may here mention in connection with the Sweet Potato (Batatas edulis),\r\na plant that may have an American origin, though much mystery surrounds\r\nits home, that it rarely seeds in Fiji except when it is grown in poor,\r\nsandy soil, and in dry, rocky situations. The Fijians were quite\r\nincredulous as to its maturing seed; but after much searching I found a\r\nsolitary plant in seed and removed their doubts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE POLYNESIAN WEEDS\r\n\r\nSome curious questions are raised in connection with the weeds of this\r\nregion. Polynesia, says Dr. Seemann, presents a most interesting problem\r\nwith regard to its weeds. It is, however, necessary to point out that\r\nthese plants arrange themselves into two groups, the aboriginal weeds\r\ncomprising those existing in the islands at the time of Captain Cook’s\r\nexpeditions in the latter half of the eighteenth century, and the white\r\nman’s weeds that have been since introduced.\r\n\r\nAs concerning the Fijian Islands, Dr. Seemann remarked that although the\r\nmajority of the non-endemic plants of the flora is Asiatic, “the bulk of\r\nthe weeds is of American origin, or, at all events, is now found in\r\nAmerica.” His principal point was to show that American weeds displayed\r\na greater disposition than Asiatic weeds to spread in Fiji, because Fiji\r\nwas to American plants altogether virgin ground. This is a purely\r\nbotanical matter, and we are not in a position to oppose a conclusion\r\nformed by such a careful observer of plant life. But to the ethnologist\r\nit is a very different matter whether most of the Fijian weeds are of\r\nAmerican origin or merely now exist in America. His interest lies\r\nentirely in the aboriginal weeds. To the student of plant-dispersal this\r\ndistinction is also a very important one; and his interest again is all\r\non the side of the aboriginal weeds.\r\n\r\nDr. Seemann enumerates 64 Fijian weeds, of which at least 37 were in the\r\nPacific islands when Captain Cook’s botanists made their collections\r\n(see Note 82). Of these 22 occur in continental regions on both sides of\r\nthe Pacific, 13 are natives of the Old World alone, and two only are\r\nseemingly American exclusively, namely, Waltheria americana and Teucrium\r\ninflatum. The first is claimed to be American because most species of\r\nthe genus are American, but it is now widely distributed in the Old\r\nWorld as well as in America. The second, though widely distributed in\r\ntropical America, has strangely enough only been found in the islands of\r\nthe Western Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe important point is thus brought out that although in Captain Cook’s\r\ntime the food-plants cultivated by the Polynesians, such as the banana,\r\nthe breadfruit, the taro, and the yams, were almost exclusively Asiatic\r\nin origin and bore Malayan names, a large proportion of the weeds were\r\nnot exclusively Asiatic, but occurred in America as well as in the Old\r\nWorld. The inference to be drawn, however, is not, as Dr. Seemann\r\nimplies, that the Polynesians derived several of their weeds from\r\nAmerica (since with few exceptions all the aboriginal weeds named in\r\nNote 82 occur in the Old World, and in more than a third of the plants\r\nin the Old World only), but that many so-called cosmopolitan weeds were\r\ndistributed very much as they are now, when the Polynesians brought\r\ntheir food plants from Indo-Malaya into the Pacific.\r\n\r\nWeeds follow the cultivator in all climates; and it is very natural\r\nthat, as Mr. Hemsley points out, plants which seem to owe their wide\r\ndispersal to cultivation are not found in Australia (_Bot. Chall.\r\nExped._, iii, 142). The Australian native as a rule cultivates nothing.\r\nYet I fancy that man’s share in weed dispersal is as often as not merely\r\nrestricted to producing the conditions favourable to the growth of\r\nweeds, and that the seeds are often brought by birds and other agencies.\r\nMany weeds of the genera Atriplex, Polygonum, and Ranunculus are\r\ndispersed by partridges in England, and I have often found the uninjured\r\nfruits of the plants in the stomachs of these birds. Many weeds, like\r\nPrunella vulgaris, Plantago major, Capsella bursa-pastoris, Luzula\r\ncampestris, and several others named in Note 43, possess seeds or fruits\r\nthat become “sticky” when wet, and would readily adhere to a bird’s\r\nplumage.\r\n\r\nWe can also say of tropical weeds that many of them are distributed by\r\nbirds. In the crop of a dove in Hawaii I found a number of the small dry\r\nfruits of Waltheria americana, the widely spread tropical weed before\r\nmentioned, and of another weed of the order Compositæ. On the bare rocky\r\npeak of one of the Vanua Levu mountains the only plants found growing\r\nwere Oxalis corniculata and a species of Peperomia, both of them\r\nevidently growing from seed dropped by birds. The fruits of Urena lobata\r\nand of species of Sida, as well as those of Bidens pilosa and Ageratum\r\nconyzoides, could be readily dispersed, entangled by their appendages in\r\nthe plumage of birds, whilst the sticky achenes of Adenostemma viscosum\r\nwould easily adhere to feathers. Weeds with drupes or berries like\r\nGeophila reniformis and Solanum oleraceum would attract frugivorous\r\nbirds, and I have often seen berries of the last-named pecked by birds.\r\nMan has doubtless often been the agent in dispersing the seeds of\r\nLeguminous weeds like Lablab vulgaris. On the other hand, we know from\r\nthe observations of Focke (see page 150) that birds can distribute the\r\nseeds of a plant like Vicia faba; and in the Pacific islands it is\r\nevident from the frequent occurrence of Tephrosia piscatoria on bare\r\nrocky hill tops that its seeds are dispersed through the same agency.\r\nBirds also probably carry about the seeds of Cardiospermum halicacabum.\r\n\r\nIf we based our conclusion solely on the distribution of weeds without a\r\nprevious study of their means of dispersal we might, as students of the\r\ndistribution of man, acquire some startling and very erroneous notions\r\non the history of the races of man, especially in the New World. Lacking\r\nsuch an acquaintance with existing modes of dispersal it would not be\r\nprudent to attach too much importance to the occurrence of Asiatic weeds\r\nin America and of American weeds in Asia. Mr. Hemsley, in his work on\r\nthe botany of Central America (_Biologia Centrali-Americana_), gives a\r\nlist of ten British plants of world-wide range, which we will designate\r\nplants of waste places rather than weeds. They are plants often found\r\nnot only in the Old and New Worlds, but also in the southern hemisphere,\r\nand I will here name them: Radiola millegrana, Alchemilla vulgaris,\r\nCotyledon umbilicus, Lythrum salicaria, Convolvulus sepium, Sibthorpia\r\neuropæa, Prunella vulgaris, Lycopus europæus, Aira cæspitosa, Luzula\r\ncampestris. According to this authority these plants “are most unlikely\r\nto have been aided, intentionally or unintentionally, by man” and\r\n“possess no special means of dispersion by animals or birds or the\r\nelements” in the way, as is implied, of appendages like hooks, hairs, a\r\npappus, &c.\r\n\r\nFive of these plants are referred to in various connections already in\r\nthis work. In all I have tested the means of dispersal of six or seven\r\nof them; and although my results are not always conclusive, I venture\r\nhere to indicate some of them. The nutlets of Prunella vulgaris and the\r\nseeds of Luzula campestris emit mucus when wetted and adhere firmly to\r\nfeathers on drying, whilst the nutlets of Lycopus europæus are sticky in\r\nthe dry state and adhere to the fingers on handling. This last-named\r\nplant is occasionally to be noticed on rubbish heaps growing with other\r\nwaste-plants. No such adhesive qualities, whether in the wet or dry\r\ncondition, came under my notice with Alchemilla arvensis or with Lythrum\r\nsalicaria. With Alchemilla the seed-like fruits fall from the plant,\r\ninclosed in the dried-up calyx. The seeds of Cotyledon umbilicus are so\r\nminute (1/3 mm. or 1/75 inch) that they can be compared with Juncus\r\nseeds from the standpoint of dispersal. They are naturally a little\r\nsticky and tend to adhere to feathers, but more probably they are\r\ntransported in adherent soil. The case of Convolvulus sepium is a very\r\nremarkable one, and I have referred to it on page 29 and in the notes\r\nthere indicated. The species of Radiola, Sibthorpia, and Aira have not\r\nbeen tested by me. Dispersion, however, would be favoured by the small\r\nsize of the seeds in the first two species and by the awned glumes in\r\nthe case of Aira.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of aboriginal weeds might be expected by some to supply\r\ndata of profound interest to the student of the races of mankind; and I\r\nthink the botanist rarely realises how often he tantalises the\r\nethnologist by the remark that certain weeds have been spread by\r\ncultivation all round the tropics. De Candolle many years ago, in his\r\n_Géographie Botanique_, gave a list of nearly 100 plants, made up of Old\r\nWorld species naturalised in America and of American species naturalised\r\nin the Old World, and quite half of them were classed as plants\r\ndistributed in one way or another through man’s agency. Now this is\r\neither a subject of supreme importance or it is of no interest to the\r\nstudent of man’s history. If it should prove that birds have done most\r\nof this dispersal, then the story of the aboriginal weed would be of\r\nlittle interest in connection with the races of man in the New World.\r\n\r\nI will now refer briefly from the standpoint of dispersal to a few\r\ninteresting Polynesian plants in which man has been in most cases more\r\nor less concerned in their distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n               ALEURITES MOLUCCANA (THE CANDLE-NUT TREE)\r\n\r\nMuch interest is attached to this tree, which is found in India, Malaya,\r\nand North-east Australia, and occurs all over the Pacific, extending\r\nnorth to Hawaii, south to the Kermadec Islands, and east to Tahiti and\r\nPitcairn Island (Maiden). In the Hawaiian Islands it is often so\r\nfrequent as to form whole forests, or at all events to give a character\r\nto the forest zone up to 2,000 feet above the sea. Its prevalence in\r\nHawaii might be regarded as evidence of its indigenous character; but\r\nits predominance there is due to the circumstance that it is one of the\r\nfew forest-trees that the cattle and other animals avoid, most other\r\ntrees falling victim to their depredations by the loss of the bark. In\r\nFiji, though frequent in places, it does not form such a conspicuous\r\nfeature in the vegetation as in Hawaii. In Samoa it is abundant in the\r\ncoast-bush. In Rarotonga it forms with Hibiscus tiliaceus, as we learn\r\nfrom Cheeseman, the major portion of the lower forests, a circumstance\r\nwhich seems to indicate, since both these trees were probably introduced\r\nby the natives, that this island like Hawaii has lost or is losing many\r\nof its original forest-trees. In Tahiti, according to Nadeaud, it is\r\ncommon from the sea-level up to 3,000 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nAs a Polynesian tree, Aleurites moluccana presents itself to me as an\r\nintruder which has often taken the place of trees of the primeval\r\nforests of these islands. That the natives usually employ the oily seeds\r\nfor illuminating purposes is well known; and its prevailing name of\r\nTuitui (Kukui in Hawaii) is derived from the Polynesian custom of\r\nthreading the seeds before using them for lighting purposes. One of the\r\nFijian names, “Sikethi,” is suggestive of “Saketa,” a name for the tree\r\nin the Ternate dialect of the Indian Archipelago. To the modes of\r\ndispersal of this tree, I have devoted much attention.\r\n\r\nThe more or less empty seeds of this tree are to be commonly found\r\nfloating in rivers and stranded on beaches. I have found them in numbers\r\non the beaches of Fiji and Hawaii in the Pacific, and of the south coast\r\nof Java and of Keeling Atoll in the Indian Ocean. In all I have examined\r\nmany hundreds of these seeds, whether stranded on the beaches in the\r\nlocalities above named, or floating in the Fijian rivers and at sea\r\namongst the islands of that archipelago. The seeds were always either\r\nempty or contained a kernel in an advanced stage of decay. A sound seed\r\nhas no floating power under any condition; and sound seeds are only to\r\nbe found in beach drift near the mouths of estuaries, where they have\r\nbeen freed by the decay of the fruits brought down by the rivers. During\r\nsome dredging operations in the harbour at Honolulu several years ago,\r\nquantities of old Aleurites fruits and seeds were brought up. It is only\r\nby means of the floating fruit that the sound seed can be carried any\r\ndistance by the currents; but even in this case the opportunities of\r\nwide dispersal are very limited. If one places in sea-water a number of\r\nwell-dried fruits, most of them will sink within a week, and all will be\r\nat the bottom in a fortnight.\r\n\r\nThe seeds stranded on a beach are often found cracked. This I think\r\narises from long exposure to the scorching rays of the sun. On account\r\nof the hardness of the shell it is very difficult to obtain the kernel\r\nentire; but the Mangaians get over this difficulty, as we learn from the\r\nRev. Wyatt Gill, by slightly baking the seeds; whilst the Fijians,\r\naccording to Mr. Horne, effect the same object by throwing the heated\r\nseeds into cold water. On one occasion I placed an empty seed on a tin\r\nplate kept at a temperature 115° to 120° F., a temperature near that\r\nwhich the seed would acquire when lying exposed to the sun on a tropical\r\nbeach. After five days I found it had reproduced the cracks noticed in\r\nanother empty seed from the Keeling beach.\r\n\r\nFacts are not wanting with regard to the dispersal of the seeds by\r\nbirds; but since the kernel alone is sought for by birds, and as there\r\nis no means of cracking the shell in their stomachs, such an agency is\r\nonly available for local distribution. The Messrs. Layard inform us that\r\nin New Caledonia a small crow (Physocorax moneduloides) and a parrot\r\n(Nymphicus cornutus) are very partial to these seeds (_Ibis_, 1882).\r\nThey were told that the crow cracked them by carrying them to a\r\nconsiderable height and letting them fall on a stone. We are not told\r\nhow the parrot cracks the seed, which has a shell so hard that the\r\nMalays, I may remark, term the seed “bua kras,” or “the hard seed,”\r\nwhilst a hammer is required to break it. However, since Indian parrots,\r\naccording to Mr. J. Scott, are able to split open with their beaks the\r\nhard beans of Adenanthera pavonina (_More Letters of Charles Darwin_,\r\nii, 349), they evidently possess ingenuity in seed-cracking.\r\n\r\nMy general conclusion with reference to this tree in Polynesia is that\r\nit could not have been distributed, except locally, by birds and\r\ncurrents; and that it owes its dispersion there principally to man. A\r\ncontrary indication seems to be offered by the occurrence of the tree in\r\nthe uninhabited Kermadec group; but since Cordyline terminalis also\r\nexists there, a cultivated plant widely dispersed by the Polynesians, it\r\nwould appear that these islanders have formerly visited the group. It is\r\nalso contended by Canon Walsh that the Cordyline of the Maoris was\r\nintroduced into New Zealand by that race. (See Cheeseman in vols. xx and\r\nxxxiii, _Trans. N.Z. Inst._, for papers on the Kermadec flora and on the\r\nfood-plants of the Polynesians.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                INOCARPUS EDULIS (THE TAHITIAN CHESTNUT)\r\n\r\nLike Aleurites moluccana this tree presents a _primâ facie_ case for\r\ndispersal by currents. As the result of inquiries in this direction I\r\nhave formed the opinion, however, that it has been mainly distributed by\r\nman. Though occurring in all the South Pacific groups, as far east as\r\nTahiti and the Marquesas, it does not occur in Hawaii. With its home in\r\nMalaya it possesses a range closely resembling that of the breadfruit\r\ntree; and yet, although its fruits are often a common article of food in\r\nPolynesia, it requires no cultivation, and reproduces itself so\r\nabundantly in favourable situations that, as Dr. Seemann observes, only\r\nthe dense shade of the parents checks the occupation by the seedlings of\r\nall the adjacent ground. It possesses in the Pacific two sets of names,\r\nneither of which I have been able to identify with any Malayan names,\r\nand both occur over much of the region. Thus the Fijian “Ivi” and the\r\nSamoan and Tongan “Ifi” are represented by “Ii” in Rarotonga, “Ihi” in\r\nTahiti and the Marquesas, “Hi” in Ualan in the Carolines, “Ifi” in\r\nFutuna in the New Hebrides, and “If” in a New Guinea dialect. Then we\r\nhave the Tahitian “Mape,” the “Marap” of Ponape in the Carolines, and\r\nthe “Mamape” of Fate in the New Hebrides, besides other forms found in\r\nMelanesia.\r\n\r\nIn the South Pacific islands, as in Fiji, Samoa, Rarotonga, and in the\r\nTahitian group, it flourishes in low, moist localities at and near the\r\ncoast, by the side of streams and estuaries, and in the rich soil of the\r\nlower valleys. In the Rewa delta in Fiji it is especially abundant,\r\noften bordering the creeks in the mangrove swamps, and occupying\r\nstations that are under water when the river is in flood. It may extend\r\ninland in the various groups, but it is in the low-lying, moist, coast\r\nregions that it mostly thrives; and in Fiji it presented itself to me as\r\nessentially a tree of the estuaries, a station strongly suggestive of\r\ndispersal by currents. Schimper, it may be remarked, includes it amongst\r\nthe shore vegetation of the Indian Archipelago.\r\n\r\nWhen in Fiji I paid especial attention to the dispersal by currents of\r\nthese large fruits, the agency of birds being, of course, negatived by\r\ntheir size. They are to be commonly observed floating in the rivers when\r\nin flood, as well as at sea between the islands, and stranded on the\r\nbeaches. Of those found afloat in the Rewa River not more than a fourth\r\nhad a sound seed. Of those stranded on the beaches two-fifths were\r\nempty, two-fifths displayed a rotten seed, and one-fifth had sound\r\nseeds. Of those picked up at sea all were empty. These fruits, unlike\r\nmany others in the drift of the Fijian rivers, do not germinate afloat.\r\nThey soon lose in the water their outer, fleshy, non-buoyant coat;\r\nwhilst the inner fibrous coat, to which the floating power of the fruit\r\nis due, the seed having no buoyancy, is not water-tight, and moisture\r\nsoon enters and leads to the decay of the seed. In order to test their\r\nfloating power, I placed in sea-water ten mature fruits. Five of them\r\nfloated after forty-five days, having then lost most of the outer,\r\nfleshy coat. Two were afloat after sixty days, but their seeds were\r\nrotting. One fruit that sank after five weeks had a sound seed. Most of\r\nthem were sown out afterwards in a place where the trees were thriving,\r\nbut none germinated, and of two or three examined all had a decaying\r\nseed. The empty fruits may float a long time after the decay of the\r\nseed. Forty days would probably be the extreme limit for the flotation\r\nin sea-water of a fruit with a seemingly sound seed, though a very small\r\nproportion would reach this limit, and I much doubt whether such a fruit\r\nwould germinate afterwards.\r\n\r\nI, therefore, inferred that currents are only available for the local\r\ndispersion of the fruits of Inocarpus edulis. It is to man that the tree\r\nowes its existence in Tahiti and other groups of the open Pacific; and\r\nit is to be concluded that the occurrence of this tree on Christmas\r\nIsland in the Indian Ocean marks an early Malayan occupation of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          GYROCARPUS JACQUINI\r\n\r\nThe cosmopolitan distribution of this seemingly useless tree, growing,\r\nas Hemsley remarks, in maritime districts throughout the tropics, in\r\nAmerica, Australia, Asia, and Africa, presents one of the puzzles of\r\nplant-distribution. It is by no means universally spread in the Pacific\r\nislands, and I find reference to it only in Fiji and Tahiti. Seemann\r\nsays that in Fiji it is common on the beaches of Taviuni and other\r\nislands. I found it to be a rare coast tree on Vanua Levu. It does not\r\nseem to have been recorded by the botanists of the 18th century in the\r\nPacific. It, however, has evidently been long established there. Nadeaud\r\ndoes not speak of its littoral station in Tahiti, and says that it grows\r\nbest in the regions of the interior up to elevations of 2,000 feet,\r\nwhere it attains a great size; and its abundance is implied by his\r\nremark that he had to fell many trees to collect the fruits.\r\n\r\nThe singular fruit, which has two long wings and looks like a\r\nshuttlecock, dries up on the tree; and in course of time it is detached\r\nand falls to the ground. The falling fruit in its descent twists round\r\nlike a screw, and hence the Fijians call the tree the Wiri-Wiri tree,\r\nthe same name in the form of Wili-Wili being given for a similar reason\r\nto Erythrina monosperma in Hawaii. Schimper (p. 157) truly remarks that\r\nthe fruits are too heavy to be carried by the wind across a wide extent\r\nof sea; and I ascertained by experiment that in an ordinary trade-breeze\r\nthey would only be carried a few paces. Birds are quite out of the\r\nquestion as agents of their transport to oceanic islands. We are driven\r\nthen either to the agency of man or to that of the current. The trees\r\ngrow rapidly and the timber is soft and perishable. The fruits are not\r\nedible, and as far as I could ascertain the tree is of little or no\r\nvalue to the Pacific Islander, there being at all events no reason to\r\nbelieve that he has distributed it.\r\n\r\nWe appeal lastly to the currents, the agency which Mr. Bentham selected\r\non _a priori_ grounds (Presidential address, _Linnean Society_, 1869).\r\nMy experiments in Fiji showed that the fruits, when dried on the tree\r\nand afterwards detached, are able to float over long distances in\r\nsea-water. After two months they were still afloat, the seeds inside\r\nbeing dry and unharmed. The fruit’s buoyancy was tested in different\r\nconditions, either without the wings, or with both wings, or with but\r\none wing, and it was found that the wings, which float for only a day or\r\ntwo by themselves, lessen the buoyancy of the fruit. Of fruits with both\r\nwings attached forty per cent. floated after two months, whilst of those\r\ndeprived of the wings all floated after two months. In the ordinary\r\ncourse of flotation the wings in most cases break off during the first\r\nfew weeks, and in the rough-and-tumble of current-transport this would\r\noccur sooner, so that the floating power of most of the fruits would not\r\nbe much affected. The cause of the buoyancy in a structural sense\r\nbelongs to the Convolvulaceous type. The kernel has no buoyancy, but it\r\nincompletely fills the cavity of the seed-vessel, the coats of which are\r\nquite waterproof, but have no independent floating power.\r\n\r\nIt is thus evident that like many other shore-trees Gyrocarpus Jacquini\r\nis distributed by the currents. It is not unlikely that its present\r\nsporadic occurrence in the Pacific islands may be due to the gradual\r\nextinction of the tree in this region, either on account of some insect\r\npest introduced since Cook’s time or from the use of the timber for\r\nfire-wood by the aborigines.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SERIANTHES MYRIADENIA\r\n\r\nThis is a striking looking Acacia-like tree that might have been fitly\r\ndiscussed in the chapter on the enigmas of the Leguminosæ. Only four or\r\nfive species are named in the _Index Kewensis_, of which one occurs in\r\nMalacca and in the Philippines, a second in New Caledonia, a third in\r\nFiji, and the fourth, S. myriadenia, over the South Pacific groups of\r\nFiji, Tonga, and Tahiti. Reinecke does not include the genus in the\r\nSamoan flora; and it is merely assigned to that group by Seemann on the\r\nauthority of Mr. Pritchard, the British Consul in Fiji. Though common in\r\nthe forests of the larger islands of Fiji, S. myriadenia is most at home\r\non the banks of the estuaries, usually behind the mangrove belt, but not\r\nbeyond tidal influence. The peculiar species, S. vitiensis, I found on\r\nthe banks of the estuary of the Mbua River in Vanua Levu, the locality\r\nfrom which Gray described it. According to the French botanists, S.\r\nmyriadenia, in Tahiti, ranges from near the sea to an elevation of 800\r\nmetres. The Fijian name of the trees is “Vaivai,” the name also of\r\nLeucæna Forsteri, and of some other introduced trees of the Acacia\r\nhabit. The Tahitians apply the same name in the form of “Faifai” to S.\r\nmyriadenia.\r\n\r\nThe Fijians value the trees on account of the wood; but unless the\r\nPolynesians were in the habit of transporting the seeds of their\r\nnumerous timber trees, which is most unlikely, it seems at first sight\r\nuseless to look to man’s agency for an explanation of the wide dispersal\r\nof a tree like S. myriadenia in the South Pacific. The tough, woody,\r\nindehiscent pods, from 3-1/2 to 4 inches long, floated in my sea-water\r\nexperiments in the case of both S. myriadenia and S. vitiensis between\r\nseven and twenty-five days, after drying for some months. The seeds,\r\nabout two-thirds of an inch (17 mm.) in length, are only freed by the\r\ndecay of the fallen pod, and have no buoyancy. The agency of birds is\r\nevidently excluded; and it is, therefore, to the currents that we must\r\nmake our final appeal; but their powers of dispersing the species appear\r\nquite insufficient to explain the occurrence of these trees in Tahiti.\r\nPerhaps, as in the case of Calophyllum spectabile, another Polynesian\r\ntimber-tree found in Tahiti (see p. 136), man and the currents have\r\nworked together.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            LEUCÆNA FORSTERI\r\n\r\nThis bush of the Mimoseæ frequents maritime sands in the South Pacific,\r\nand is confined to this region. It has been found in New Caledonia,\r\nFiji, Tonga, Rarotonga, and Tahiti. The seeds sink and the pods dehisce\r\non the plant, so that the agency of currents, unless we invoke the\r\nintervention of the drifting log, bearing the seeds in its crevices,\r\nseems to be excluded. Sea-birds might carry the seeds unharmed in their\r\nstomachs, but there is no evidence bearing on birds as agents in the\r\ndispersal of the species. Since the plant has not been recorded from\r\nlocalities outside the Pacific islands, and since it was collected by\r\nCook’s botanists in Tonga and Tahiti, it cannot be placed amongst plants\r\nof recent introduction. Although growing on maritime sands in Fiji,\r\nRarotonga, and Tahiti, it may grow inland, and according to Cheeseman is\r\nparticularly abundant in Rarotonga. In Fiji it is apt to occupy\r\nnewly-formed alluvial land at the mouth of the rivers, as in the case of\r\nthe Rewa; but the “how and why” caused me much fruitless speculation,\r\nand I abandoned the plant in despair. The Fijians sometimes give it the\r\nnative name of Serianthes myriadenia, which they then term “Vaivai ni\r\nViti,” or the Fijian Vaivai. In Tahiti it is named “Toroire,” and in\r\nTonga “Toromiro.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MUSSÆNDA FRONDOSA\r\n\r\nMussænda frondosa is the only one of the sixty species of this tropical\r\nAsiatic and African genus that extends into Polynesia. This beautiful\r\nshrub, which is easily recognised by its conspicuous white, leaf-like\r\ncalyx lobe, is common everywhere in Fiji, decorating, as Horne fitly\r\nremarks, in the contrast presented by its golden flowers, its large\r\nwhite calyx leaf, and its green foliage, many an acre of waste, grassy\r\nland, where the orange-coloured doves and the red and the green parrots\r\nflit to and fro. With its home in India, China, and Malaya, it ranges\r\nall over the South Pacific, from the Solomon Islands to Tahiti. Its\r\nberries contain an abundance of small, minutely-pitted seeds, 0·7 mm. or\r\n1/35 of an inch in size, and weighing when well dried about 600 to the\r\ngrain. The seeds retain after years of drying the property of clinging\r\nto passing objects by means of a few microscopic, thread-like fibres,\r\nthat are attached to their surfaces. In this manner they will fasten\r\nthemselves to the point of a knife, and the observer is astonished to\r\nsee them dangling in the air from a pin’s point. I suppose that this is\r\nconnected with some hygroscopic quality. At all events, it would enable\r\nthese light seeds to be carried about not only by birds and bats but\r\nalso by insects. It is possible that man has aided in the dispersal of\r\nthis interesting plant; but birds, bats, and insects have, I think,\r\nmainly done the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            LUFFA INSULARUM\r\n\r\nThis is regarded as a maritime form of Luffa cylindrica, a plant\r\ncommonly cultivated throughout the tropics. The South Pacific plant,\r\nwhich occurs also in Australia and Malaya, has been found in New\r\nCaledonia, Fiji, Tonga, Rarotonga, and Tahiti. In Fiji it grows chiefly\r\non the “talasinga” plains and in places once under cultivation. I\r\nnoticed it in one locality climbing over the branches of an Inocarpus\r\ntree on the banks of the Rewa. In Rarotonga it is common in the lower\r\nregions. It is, according to Nadeaud, fairly frequent on the shore and\r\nin the lower valleys of Tahiti, where it was collected by Banks and\r\nSolander, the companions of Cook. The Pacific islanders, as far as can\r\nbe gathered, make little or no use of the plant; and unless it was\r\nintroduced accidentally with their cultivated plants, they could\r\nscarcely have been concerned in its dispersal.\r\n\r\nIn Fiji I made a special point of investigating the mode of dispersal of\r\nthis plant. The fruits, which ultimately become dry and fibrous, are to\r\nbe seen hanging vertically from the plant as it climbs among the\r\nbranches of a tree. The apical disk usually falls off, and many of the\r\nseeds drop out through the hole thus produced; but a few remain\r\nentangled in the fibrous material occupying the interior of the fruit. I\r\nhave noticed such fruits floating down the stream of the Rewa River; but\r\nmy experiments showed that they do not float more than a week, whether\r\nin fresh or salt water. The seeds, however, possess a hard, impervious\r\nshell, and are well adapted to withstand unharmed prolonged immersion in\r\nthe sea. They will evidently float for months. Out of one hundred\r\nselected seeds placed in sea-water, sixty were found afloat and sound\r\nafter two months. The cause of the seed-buoyancy is purely mechanical.\r\nNeither the shell nor the kernel has any floating power, the buoyancy\r\narising, as with Convolvulaceous seeds, from the unfilled space in the\r\nseed-cavity. When in Fiji, I tested the seeds of the ordinary cultivated\r\ntropical form of the plant which had been introduced into a garden from\r\nAustralia. They all sank in a few days, and on being cut across the seed\r\ndisplayed but little unoccupied space in its cavity. I have no doubt\r\nthat the Pacific form of this plant has been at times dispersed by the\r\ncurrents, not, however, through the fruits, but through the seeds. It is\r\nalso quite possible that it may have been introduced by a pre-Polynesian\r\npeople into the Pacific.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Summary of the Chapter_\r\n\r\n(1) Man in his distribution over the Pacific islands reproduces, but in\r\na less degree, nearly all the difficulties presented by the plant in its\r\ndispersal. In both we have the age of general dispersion followed by a\r\nsuspension more or less complete of the migrating movements; and in both\r\nwe have differentiation associated with the isolation.\r\n\r\n(2) The Pacific islanders possess two sets of food-plants. In addition\r\nto those commonly cultivated in our own time, such as the yam, the taro,\r\nthe banana, &c., there are a number of food-plants now growing wild, but\r\nrarely cultivated, and only used when the others fail. These plants,\r\nwhich include the wild yams, the mountain bananas, Tacca pinnatifida,\r\nPandanus odoratissimus, and several others, are regarded as older than\r\nthe Polynesians in the Pacific, and as having probably formed the food\r\nof a pre-Polynesian race that practised only a rude sort of cultivation.\r\n\r\n(3) The weeds of Polynesia also fall into two groups. In the first place\r\nthere are the aboriginal weeds, of which those found in this region by\r\nCaptain Cook’s botanists in the latter part of the 18th century are\r\ntaken as examples. These include species of Urena and Sida, besides\r\nWaltheria americana, Oxalis corniculata, Bidens pilosa, and many other\r\nweeds. In the second place, there are the numerous weeds that are known\r\nto have been introduced by the white man since the voyages of the\r\nEnglish and French navigators of Captain Cook’s time.\r\n\r\n(4) There is reason to believe that many weeds now cosmopolitan in the\r\ntropics had obtained their present distribution in America and in the\r\nOld World before the Polynesians entered the Pacific. It is thus that we\r\ncan explain how there existed in these islands at the time of their\r\ndiscovery by Cook, Bougainville, and other navigators of that period, a\r\nnumber of weeds that have their homes in America.\r\n\r\n(5) It is not considered that the distribution of aboriginal weeds can\r\nmaterially aid the ethnologist in his study of the early history of man,\r\nsince birds are regarded as the chief distributors of their seeds and\r\nfruits. Whilst man has prepared the conditions for the growth of weeds,\r\nthe bird has usually brought the seeds.\r\n\r\n(6) Amongst interesting plants concerned with man in the Pacific are\r\nAleurites moluccana and Inocarpus edulis, which are regarded as in the\r\nmain distributed through man’s agency. Gyrocarpus Jacquini is viewed as\r\na tree originally widely dispersed by the currents in the Pacific, but\r\nnow becoming extinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n                         BEACH AND RIVER DRIFT\r\n\r\nIn the south of England.—On the coast of Scandinavia.—In the\r\n  Mediterranean.—Southern Chile.—Very little effective dispersal by\r\n  currents in temperate latitudes.—Cakile maritima.—In tropical\r\n  regions.—River drift.—River and beach drift of Fiji.—Musa Ensete.—The\r\n  coco-nut.—River and beach drift of Hawaii.—Comparison of the beach\r\n  drift of the Old and New Worlds.—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE BEACH DRIFT OF TEMPERATE LATITUDES\r\n\r\nDISPERSAL by currents seems to be mainly restricted to warm latitudes.\r\nWhilst in the tropics seed-drift is abundant on the beaches, in the\r\ncooler regions of the globe it is usually very scanty and often masked\r\nby other vegetable _débris_.\r\n\r\nLet us take, for instance, a beach in the south of England. We can find\r\nby careful searching amongst the stranded drift the seeds and\r\nseed-vessels of various littoral plants of the buoyant group, such as\r\nArenaria (Honckeneya) peploides, Cakile maritima, Crithmum maritimum,\r\nConvolvulus soldanella, Euphorbia paralias, &c., and such sundries as\r\nbits of stems of Salsola kali bearing fruits; but their amount is\r\nscanty; and they are often difficult to find on account of the great\r\namount of rubbish with which they are associated, such as empty stones\r\nof cherries, plums, and peaches; empty seeds of grapes; hazel-nuts,\r\nbeech-nuts, chestnuts, acorns, all either empty or with decaying seed;\r\nthe spiral pods of Medicago; besides quantities of leaves, sticks, and\r\nbark. Although the occasional shell of a Spirula, or the horny skeleton\r\nof a Velella, or a genuine pumice pebble (see Note 76), may tell us of\r\nlong wanderings in mid-ocean, we find little that is not English or\r\nderived from neighbouring coasts on a beach in the south of England. I\r\nhave examined numerous beaches on the coasts of Devon and Cornwall, and\r\nhave never come upon any indubitable tropical seed-drift.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion I examined many of the beaches between Ilfracombe and\r\nPadstow with the object of finding tropical seeds, but to no purpose.\r\nPortions of bark, generally 2 to 4 inches across and much water-worn,\r\ntogether with a quantity of steamer-slag or cinders, often largely\r\ncomposed the stranded drift. No doubt this bark is stripped off by the\r\nwaves from floating trees, which are generally stranded in a bare\r\ncondition after a long ocean voyage. This is the case with the timber\r\nbrought in the Oregon drift to Hawaii; and Sernander (p. 117) remarks\r\nthat bark seldom occurs on the trees washed ashore with the Atlantic\r\ndrift on the coasts of Scandinavia. Modern marine deposits ought to\r\ncontain much bark _débris_.\r\n\r\nOn the beaches in the vicinity of estuaries we find a certain amount of\r\nriver drift, and amongst it fruits or seeds of Sparganium ramosum, Iris\r\npseudacorus, Alnus glutinosa, Rumex, and many other river-side plants,\r\nsuch as I have mentioned in my paper on the Thames drift (_Journ. Linn.\r\nSoc. Bot._, xxix). Most of them are capable of reproducing the plant,\r\nbut not on the sandy beach where the waves have stranded them; and we\r\nthus see here one of the limits of the efficacy of currents as\r\nseed-dispersers.\r\n\r\nFrom the labours of Lindman and Norman, the results of which are summed\r\nup by Sernander (p. 116) we can learn what are the components of the\r\n“Atlantic Drift” on the Scandinavian coast; and a strange assortment we\r\nhere find, in which it is difficult to detect much indication of\r\neffective seed dispersal. Besides the seeds of Cæsalpinia Bonducella,\r\nEntada scandens, and Mucuna urens, familiar to us as occurring in the\r\ndrift of tropical beaches, there is a quantity of vegetable drift\r\nhailing sometimes from North America, sometimes from the Canary Islands,\r\nand sometimes from the West Indies, mingled with much local drift in\r\nwhich the larch and steamer-slag or cinders predominate. The seed-drift\r\nderived from the proper beach-plants of the coast plays a subordinate\r\npart, though it is stated by Norman and others that seeds and\r\nseed-vessels, as the case may be, of Arenaria peploides, Cakile\r\nmaritima, Convolvulus soldanella, and Lathyrus maritimus, with those of\r\nother plants, are also to be found.\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean beach drift, as illustrated by the results of my\r\nexamination of numerous beaches in Sicily as well as in the islands of\r\nStromboli and Lipari, and of the beach at Cumæ, is of a scanty nature.\r\nIf we eliminate the various evidences of cultivation which seem to occur\r\nover much of the temperate regions of the globe, very little remains of\r\nan interesting character. As in the south of England and in other\r\nregions, the empty stones of the cherry, plum, and peach, the empty nuts\r\nof the oak, hazel, &c., together with the spiral pods of Medicago figure\r\nlargely in the drift; and here and there we come upon the seeds of\r\nlittoral plants, such as Convolvulus soldanella and Euphorbia paralias.\r\n\r\nI have found Medicago fruits in all these localities on the beaches.\r\nThey often contain seeds, which, it may be added, have no buoyancy, the\r\nseeded pods themselves floating from two to five days. The pods of\r\nseveral kinds of Medicago form the great feature of Sicilian drift and\r\nare often indications in other places of the vicinity of cultivated\r\ndistricts. A small hairy species thrives on Letojanni beach near\r\nTaormina, and I observed its seeds together with those of Euphorbia\r\nparalias germinating in the drift stranded on the same beach. Arcangeli,\r\nin his _Flora Italiana_, enumerates as many as thirty-three species of\r\nMedicago. Many of the species grow in maritime districts, and their\r\nfruits must often get into the beach drift independently of cultivation.\r\nI noticed the pods amongst the drift brought down by the Alcantara, a\r\nriver near Taormina, a fact which goes to explain their presence in\r\nbeach drift.... On the beach of Trogilus Bay, near Syracuse, I gathered\r\nseveral fruits of a Vitex, apparently V. agnus castus. After being kept\r\nafloat for six weeks in sea-water some were placed in soil, when they\r\nsoon germinated and reproduced the plant.\r\n\r\nThe beach drift of temperate Chile is described in Chapter XXXII. There,\r\nas in other beaches of cool latitudes, it is not easy to find seeds\r\namongst the rubbish; but amongst the scanty seed-drift may be recognised\r\nmuch of what we are familiar with in the Old World, such as the seeds of\r\nConvolvulus soldanella, bits of the fruiting stems of Salsola kali, as\r\nwell as the rubbish indicating the white man’s presence, such as empty\r\nstones of cherry, plum, and peach, Medicago pods, &c. In addition, we\r\nfind the seed-vessels of plants like Franseria and Nolana that are\r\npeculiar to American beaches; and now and then, the seeds of Sophora\r\ntetraptera, a tree of the immediately adjacent hill-slopes, come under\r\nour notice.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting this subject of the beach seed-drift of temperate\r\nlatitudes, it may be observed that when at San Francisco I visited the\r\nbeach running south from the Golden Gate. With the exception of the\r\nfruits of Cakile maritima, a plant growing on the beach, few other seeds\r\nor fruits were observed in the drift.\r\n\r\nThe inference that there is very little effective dispersal by currents\r\nin temperate regions is of some importance, and Sernander arrived at a\r\nsimilar conclusion when discussing the origin of the Scandinavian flora.\r\nThe few plants with buoyant seeds and fruits, such as Arenaria\r\npeploides, Cakile maritima, Crithmum maritimum, Convolvulus soldanella,\r\nEuphorbia paralias, and Lathyrus maritimus, are no doubt thus dispersed,\r\nand Norman is quite right in attaching some value to the distribution by\r\ncurrents of certain plants within the region of the Arctic flora; but\r\nafter all it amounts to little, and geographical and climatic conditions\r\nhave often had a predominant influence in determining the distribution\r\nin the temperate latitudes of littoral plants possessing buoyant seeds\r\nor fruits.\r\n\r\nNowhere is this shown more plainly than with the littoral plants with\r\nbuoyant seeds or seed-vessels that are found on our English beaches.\r\nSome have evidently acquired their present distribution before ice and\r\nsnow reigned supreme in the extreme north. Though it may be possible, it\r\nseems highly improbable, that either Arenaria peploides or Lathyrus\r\nmaritimus, both of which occur on beaches in high northern latitudes in\r\nthe Atlantic and Pacific Oceans (as in Arctic Norway, Spitzbergen, and\r\nBehring’s Straits), could possess in our own day any means of\r\ncommunication between their areas of distribution on the borders of\r\nthese two ocean-basins.\r\n\r\nSo again with Cakile maritima, the occurrence of this or of two closely\r\nallied species on both sides of North America cannot be attributed to\r\nany present working of the currents for two reasons. In the first place,\r\nas is remarked in Note 18, the results of two independent experiments\r\nmade by me show that the fruits will not float more than a week or ten\r\ndays in the sea, a capacity that will not admit of their transportation\r\nby the currents over tracts of ocean more than one or two hundred miles\r\nacross. In the second place, this species is not an Arctic plant like\r\nArenaria peploides and Lathyrus maritimus; and the possibility of\r\ninter-communication between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans having any\r\neffective value from the standpoint of dispersal, shadowy as it is with\r\nthe two Arctic species, is still more so in the case of Cakile maritima.\r\nNorman’s observations on the coast of Norway, as quoted by Sernander\r\n(page 123), indirectly indicate how hopeless it would be for this plant\r\nto attempt to traverse the Arctic region. Just as I have noticed on the\r\nnorth coast of Devonshire, the fruits occur plentifully in the beach\r\ndrift and germinate freely in the upcast wrack as far north as Senjen in\r\nlatitude 69°. Further north the plant has been recorded from only eight\r\nlocalities, and since it is there sterile and but a summer annual, the\r\nseed-vessels, it is argued, must have been brought by the currents from\r\nthe south.\r\n\r\nThe reference to Cakile maritima as a summer annual on the north coast\r\nof Norway is of interest; but I may point out that it displays a similar\r\nbehaviour in England on the north coast of Devonshire. Here, during the\r\nlatter half of July, 1903, I found the fruits common in the stranded\r\ndrift, and often in a germinating condition, whilst numerous seedlings\r\none to two inches high with the fruit-shell still attached were growing\r\nout of the sand. From this arises the curious reflection that an annual\r\nwhich germinates in the end of July could scarcely be expected to mature\r\nits fruit before the winter. It would seem that this beach plant hampers\r\nits own dispersal by its misdirected efforts; and the idea suggests\r\nitself that we have here the explanation of its sterility in the north\r\nof Norway. Had it been a perennial like Arenaria peploides and Lathyrus\r\nmaritimus it might have had a similar distribution within the Arctic\r\nCircle.\r\n\r\nQuite other considerations seem to be suggested by the perennials\r\nCrithmum maritimum and Euphorbia paralias. In these cases, although the\r\nseeds or fruits, as the case may be, will float for months in sea-water\r\nwithout apparently sustaining any injury, the species are confined to\r\nthe warmer parts of the European region.\r\n\r\nFrom Convolvulus soldanella we obtain another story. Its occurrence in\r\nthe temperate regions of both the northern and southern hemispheres,\r\ngreat as the floating powers of the seeds may be, is concerned with\r\nsomething more than with questions relating to modes of dispersal. The\r\ncircumstance that in its distribution in the temperate regions it is\r\npractically coterminous with Ipomœa pes capræ in the tropics is very\r\nsignificant (see Note 49).\r\n\r\nEach one of the English beach plants with buoyant seeds and fruits has\r\nits own story of the past to tell. Time has indeed gathered on our\r\nbeaches current-dispersed plants, which, if they could speak, would tell\r\nus strange stories of many latitudes, stories of change within the\r\nArctic Circle, and stories of great events within the temperate regions,\r\nand, as in the case of Convolvulus soldanella, stories of a past within\r\nthe tropical zone. It cannot be said that investigators lack clues\r\nleading to lines of inquiry into the age that immediately precedes our\r\nown.\r\n\r\nYet valuable as our British plants would be for this purpose, they do\r\nnot afford any indication that currents have played an important part in\r\nplant distribution in temperate and arctic latitudes. Ekstam strikes the\r\ntrue note for these regions when discounting the agency of currents in\r\nthe instance of the Spitzbergen flora, he regards the wind as the\r\ngreatest factor in seed-dispersal and after that the bird. The several\r\ninteresting points raised by this botanist are discussed in Chapter\r\nXXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE BEACH-DRIFT OF TROPICAL LATITUDES.\r\n\r\nTropical beaches, as a rule, present a much greater abundance and\r\nvariety of stranded seeds and fruits than we find on beaches in\r\ntemperate latitudes. Observers in different parts of the tropics have\r\nalluded to the enormous amount of vegetable drift floating in the sea\r\noff the coasts, particularly in the vicinity of estuaries. Though much\r\nof it is brought down by rivers, a good proportion is also derived from\r\nthe luxuriant vegetation that lines the beaches. Gaudichaud speaks of\r\nthe immeasurable quantity of drift (trees, branches, leaves, flowers,\r\nfruits, and seeds) floating amongst the islands of the Molucca Sea; and\r\nHemsley, who quotes this author, gives other facts illustrating the same\r\npoint. Moseley tells us that seventy miles off the coast of New Guinea,\r\nH.M.S. _Challenger_ found the sea in places blocked with drift (_Bot.\r\nChall. Exped._ iv. 279, 284). When the author of this book was in the\r\nSolomon Group, long lines of vegetable drift were frequently observed\r\nfloating among the islands. The Rewa River in Fiji carries down a great\r\namount of drift to the sea; and as described in Chapter XXXII, the\r\nGuayaquil River in Ecuador bears seaward an enormous quantity of these\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nWhen we come upon this floating drift out at sea off an estuary, we\r\nfind, as Mr. Moseley pointed out, that the leaves have gone to the\r\nbottom, whilst the floating islets, composed of the matted vegetation\r\nlifted up from the shallows of a river channel, which form such a\r\nfeature in the Guayaquil River, have been dispersed or sent to the\r\nbottom. However, a very large proportion of the seed-drift brought down\r\nby a river from the interior has no effective value for the purposes of\r\ndispersal. Many of the fruits and seeds brought down from inland owe\r\ntheir presence in river-drift entirely to the buoyancy acquired by the\r\ndecay of the seeds. It is in its lower course when it traverses the\r\nmangrove belt that a river picks up most of the material that is of\r\nservice in distributing the species; and this is mingled out at sea with\r\nthe numerous buoyant seeds and fruits of littoral plants that are swept\r\noff the beaches by the currents.\r\n\r\nA description is given in Chapter XXXII of the enormous amount of\r\nvegetable drift brought down by the Guayaquil River to the coast of\r\nEcuador. Besides the huge tree-trunks and the floating Pistias, we\r\nobserve large islets formed mainly of Pontederias and Polygonum,\r\ntogether with a host of seeds and seed-vessels, both large and small,\r\nincluding those of Anona paludosa, Entada scandens, Erythrina, Hibiscus\r\ntiliaceus, Ipomœa, Mucuna, Vigna, &c., accompanied by the empty seeds of\r\nPhytelephas macrocarpa and of many other strange plants from the slopes\r\nof the Chimborazo mountains. In addition, we notice the seedlings of\r\nAvicennia and of Rhizophora mangle together with the seeded joints of\r\nSalicornia peruviana and the germinating fruits of Laguncularia.\r\n\r\nWhen in Fiji I made an especial study of the drift of the Rewa Estuary\r\nwithin tidal influence, the results of which are incorporated in various\r\nparts of this work. In the rainy season, when the drift is most\r\nabundant, the following would be its most characteristic components:\r\n\r\n Seedlings of Bruguiera and Rhizophora.\r\n Fruits of Barringtonia racemosa and B. speciosa, the first-named most\r\n abundant and often germinating.\r\n Seeds of Carapa obovata, most of them far advanced in germination.\r\n Fruits of Lumnitzera coccinea.\r\n Fruits of Cerbera odollam, abundant.\r\n Fruits of Inocarpus edulis, with the seed generally rotten.\r\n Fruits of Heritiera littoralis, Parinarium laurinum, and Pandanus.\r\n Empty seeds of Aleurites moluccana.\r\n Fruits of Scirpodendron costatum, abundant.\r\n Fruits of Clerodendron inerme and Smythea pacifica, both of them in\r\n some cases germinating.\r\n Pyrenes of Morinda citrifolia.\r\n Small fruits of Vitex trifolia and Premna taitensis, both sometimes\r\n abundant.\r\n Seeds of Entada scandens, Mucuna, and Vigna lutea.\r\n Pods of Dalbergia monosperma and Derris uliginosa, the last sometimes\r\n in a germinating condition.\r\n Seeds of Hibiscus tiliaceus and of different species of Ipomœa, such as\r\n I. peltata and I. pes capræ.\r\n\r\nAmongst other seeds and fruits brought down by the Fijian rivers and\r\nstranded with a large amount of miscellaneous vegetable _débris_ on the\r\nbeaches in the vicinity of the estuaries are the seeds of Dioclea,\r\nStrongylodon lucidum, and Afzelia bijuga; the empty seeds of Musa Ensete\r\n(as identified with a query at Kew); the empty stones of the Sea tree,\r\napparently a species of Spondias; the seeds of Colubrina asiatica; the\r\nfruits of an inedible indigenous Orange (Citrus vulgaris?) referred to\r\nin Chapter XIII; the cocci of Excæcaria Agallocha and Macaranga; and\r\nCoco-nuts.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence in Fijian beach-drift of the seeds of Musa Ensete, or of\r\na wild banana much like it, is very remarkable. This species is found in\r\nthe mountains of Abyssinia and on the slopes of Kilima-njaro in\r\nEquatorial Africa; but according to the monograph by Schumann on the\r\nMusaceæ (Engler’s _Pflanzenreich_, 1900) the species is confined to\r\nAfrica, whilst all the other species of the subgenus are mostly\r\nrestricted to the same continent with the exception of one or two in\r\nFurther India. The empty seeds are frequent on the beach at Duniua at\r\nthe mouth of the Ndreke-ni-wai in Savu-savu Bay, Vanua Levu, and are\r\ndoubtless brought down by that river. Strangely enough the natives could\r\ngive me no information about the parent plant which I never discovered.\r\nThe seeds did not come under my notice in any other locality in Fiji.\r\nThey answer to the description and to the figure given by Schumann for\r\nMusa Ensete; and their presence in the drift is one of the mysteries of\r\nthe Pacific floras.\r\n\r\nTo enumerate the seeds and fruits found stranded on beaches in Fiji\r\nwould be to give a list of all the littoral plants with buoyant seeds or\r\nfruits that are included in the list given in Note 2. I may here allude\r\nto the fact that the Coco-nut, whether brought down by a river or\r\ntransported by a current, is able to germinate and establish itself when\r\nwashed up on the Fijian beaches. I have found these fruits germinating\r\namongst the drift stranded on the beaches near the mouths of rivers,\r\nsome just beginning to germinate and others already striking into the\r\nsand and showing the first leaves. White residents living for years in\r\none locality were quite convinced that this frequently happens. One of\r\nthem pointed out to me some newly formed land at a river’s mouth, not\r\nover two years old, on which were growing young plants three or four\r\nfeet high of Barringtonia speciosa, Calophyllum Inophyllum, and several\r\nother plants including young Coco-nut palms, all growing from fruits\r\nwashed up by the waves and therefore self-sown.\r\n\r\nLike the littoral flora the beach-drift proper to the Hawaiian Islands\r\nis very scanty. This is due to the scarcity of rivers, to the absence of\r\nthe mangrove-formation from which much of the drift is derived in other\r\ntropical regions, and to the paucity of shore-plants with buoyant seeds\r\nor fruits. As is observed in Note 30, where the composition of the beach\r\ndrift is described, the presence of a large amount of timber and of\r\nother materials brought by the currents from the north-west coast of\r\nAmerica masks much of the local drift.\r\n\r\nRemarks on the beach-drift of the Panama Isthmus, and of the Ecuadorian,\r\nPeruvian, and Chilian coasts of South America will be found in Chapter\r\nXXXII. I have examined beach drift in other tropical regions, as in the\r\nSolomon group, on Keeling Atoll, and on the south coast of West Java;\r\nwhilst there are at my disposal the data supplied by Schimper and Penzig\r\nfor the Malayan region including Krakatoa, and by Hemsley for tropical\r\nregions generally. It will, I think, be best, if instead of describing\r\nin detail the composition of the drift for each locality, I refer\r\nbriefly to the features that distinguish the tropical beach-drift of the\r\nOld World from that of the New World.\r\n\r\nThe beach-drift reflects the characters of the coast flora; and since\r\ntropical littoral floras belong to two great regions, the Asiatic\r\nincluding Polynesia and the African East Coast, and the American\r\nincluding the African West Coast, the seeds and fruits stranded on the\r\nbeaches may be similarly referred to the same two regions.\r\n\r\nAll over tropical Asia, as well as in the tropical islands of the Indian\r\nand Pacific Oceans, the drift stranded on the beach presents the same\r\ngeneral character, and as a rule possesses seeds and fruits of the same\r\nspecies that range over the whole or the greater part of this region.\r\nAlmost everywhere we find seeds or fruits of the same plants of the\r\nbeach formation, such as Barringtonia speciosa, Cæsalpinia Bonducella,\r\nCalophyllum Inophyllum, Canavalia obtusifolia, Cerbera Odollam, Cordia\r\nsubcordata, Entada scandens, Guettarda speciosa, Hernandia peltata,\r\nHibiscus tiliaceus, Ipomœa pes capræ, Mucuna, Scævola Kœnigii, Sophora\r\ntomentosa, Terminalia Katappa, and Tournefortia argentea. In those\r\nlocalities where mangrove-swamps occur we find generally diffused in the\r\nstranded drift of this region the seedlings of Bruguiera and Rhizophora,\r\nthe seeds of Carapa moluccensis, the fruits of Heritiera littoralis and\r\nLumnitzera coccinea, and the pods of Derris uliginosa. Amongst sundries\r\nfound over much of this region may be mentioned, the drupes of Pandanus,\r\nthe seeds of Erythrina, Vigna lutea, and Hibiscus tiliaceus, and the\r\n“nuts” of Aleurites moluccana. With the exception of the last-named all\r\nthe fruits and seeds here enumerated are effectively dispersed by\r\ncurrents over great areas. The sound nuts of Aleurites have no buoyancy;\r\nand the nuts only acquire their floating power through the decay of the\r\nkernel (see p. 419).\r\n\r\nThe beach drift of the American region, a region which comprises both\r\nthe Pacific and Atlantic coasts of tropical America as well as the\r\nAfrican West Coast, has some features in common with the Asiatic\r\nbeach-drift and other features peculiar to itself. The plants, however,\r\nthat are represented in the drift of both regions are comparatively few,\r\nand none of the large fruits of the Asiatic region are here to be\r\nnoticed. We observe, however, that the drift of the two regions possess\r\nin common the seeds of Cæsalpinia Bonducella, Canavalia obtusifolia,\r\nEntada scandens, Erythrina, Mucuna, Sophora tomentosa, and Vigna lutea,\r\nall belonging to the Leguminosæ; and to these we must add the seeds of\r\nHibiscus tiliaceus and of Ipomœa pes capræ, and the seedlings of\r\nRhizophora and Avicennia. (Avicennia occurs in tropical Asia, but not in\r\nPolynesia.) The distinctive characters of the beach-drift of both coasts\r\nof America and of the west coast of Africa would be shown in the\r\npresence of seeds of Anona paludosa, the fruits of Laguncularia\r\nracemosa, Conocarpus erectus, Spondias lutea, and other plants. But the\r\nbeach-drift of the American region is much more scanty. Of the shore\r\nplants generally dispersed in this region there could not be more than a\r\ncouple of dozen that are indebted for their wide dispersal to the\r\ncurrents, and these alone figure in the effective beach drift. In the\r\nAsiatic region these plants would number at least seventy or eighty.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Summary._\r\n\r\n(1) Effective dispersal by currents is mainly restricted to warm\r\nlatitudes, as is indicated by the scanty character of the seed-drift\r\nstranded on the beaches of the south of England, Scandinavia, the\r\nMediterranean, and Southern Chile.\r\n\r\n(2) The present distribution in temperate latitudes of littoral plants\r\npossessing buoyant seeds or seed-vessels is to be attributed more to the\r\ninfluence of geographical and climatic conditions than to the agency of\r\ncurrents. With some of them, such as those that occur on both sides of\r\nNorth America, it is evident that their distribution antedates the\r\npresent climatic conditions within the Arctic Circle.\r\n\r\n(3) Time has gathered on an English beach current-dispersed plants that\r\ncould tell us strange stories of many latitudes.\r\n\r\n(4) The seed-drift that is often found in such abundance in tropical\r\nseas is partly brought down by rivers and partly swept off the coast.\r\nVery little of the seed-drift brought down by the rivers from the\r\ninterior is of any service for plant-dispersal, nearly all the floating\r\nseed-drift found at sea which has any effective value being derived from\r\nthe plants of the beach and of the mangrove belt.\r\n\r\n(5) The tropical beach drift of the Old and New Worlds reflects the\r\ncharacters of the littoral floras of those regions, more especially with\r\nregard to the plants provided with buoyant seeds or seed-vessels. The\r\nplants represented in the beach drift common to both these regions\r\nbelong mostly to the Leguminosæ. The large fruits so characteristic of\r\nOld World beach-drift are not found in the New World. The number of\r\nshore plants with buoyant seeds or seed-vessels that are widely\r\ndispersed in the American region are only one-quarter or one-third of\r\nthose in the Old World region; and this difference is reflected in the\r\nscanty character of tropical American beach-drift.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n                    THE VIVIPAROUS MANGROVES OF FIJI\r\n\r\n                        RHIZOPHORA AND BRUGUIERA\r\n\r\n_Rhizophora._—Represented by Rhizophora mucronata, Rhizophora\r\n  mangle, and the Selala, a seedless intermediate form.—Their\r\n  mode of association and characters.—The relation of the\r\n  Selala.—Polyembryony.—The history of the plant between the\r\n  fertilisation of the ovule and the detachment of the seedling.—Absence\r\n  of a rest period.—Mode of detachment of the seedling.

I did not make\r\nany collections in Fiji until Prof. Schimper asked me to obtain\r\nspecimens; and a fair-sized collection containing specimens dried, and\r\npreserved in spirit, was sent to him. His illness and death shortly\r\nfollowed, and I lost the advantage of his great experience in these\r\nmatters. In a letter written to me in 1898 he expressed the hope that I\r\nwould publish my notes on the mangroves of Fiji. Years have since passed\r\nby, and as I read again his words of encouragement I take up once more\r\nthe interrupted task.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               RHIZOPHORA\r\n\r\nOf the three species of this genus, two of them, Rhizophora mucronata\r\nand R. conjugata, are Asiatic and are unknown in America; whilst the\r\nthird, R. mangle, was until recently regarded as peculiar to the\r\nAmerican and West African regions.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Hemsley wrote the Report on the Botany of the Challenger\r\nExpedition he remarked (iii, 149) that the American Rhizophora (R.\r\nmangle) appeared to be restricted to that region, and he questioned its\r\nexistence in the Pacific Islands as indicated by Jouan for New\r\nCaledonia. The same view was taken by Prof. Schimper in his work on the\r\nIndo-Malayan strand-flora published in 1891. There was, in fact, much to\r\nsupport this view, since Dr. Seemann, one of the most accomplished\r\nbotanists who have explored the Pacific, describes only the Asiatic\r\nRhizophora (R. mucronata) in Fiji, and nothing is said of any other\r\nspecies collected by the United States Exploring Expedition under Wilkes\r\nin Fiji and Samoa.\r\n\r\nHowever, in a paper on the flora of Tonga, read before the Linnean\r\nSociety in 1893, Mr. Hemsley includes the American mangrove, Rhizophora\r\nmangle, amongst the collections made there by Mr. Lister; and he refers\r\nto its occurrence also in Stewart Island (I suppose in the Solomon\r\nGroup), but he suggests that it was accidentally introduced with ballast\r\nin both these localities. In 1897 I found a species of Rhizophora, to\r\nall appearances identical with the American species, in great abundance\r\nin the Rewa delta in Fiji. Subsequently the same mangrove came under my\r\nnotice as the prevailing species in Vanua Levu in the same group; and on\r\nsending photographs of a branchlet in flower and fruit and of the\r\ngerminating fruit to Prof. Schimper he expressed the opinion that they\r\nbelonged to the typical Rhizophora mangle.\r\n\r\nThere are four typical mangroves in Fiji, namely (1) Bruguiera rheedii,\r\nthe “Dongo” proper of the natives; (2) Rhizophora mangle, usually known\r\nas “Tiri-wai,” that is to say, the Tiri of the river, or rather of the\r\nestuary; (3) Rhizophora mucronata, the “Tiri-tambua” of the Fijian,\r\nsignifying the Whale’s Tooth Tiri in allusion to the form of its fruit;\r\nand (4) a seedless form intermediate between the two species of\r\nRhizophora, which the Fijians designate “Selala,” a name signifying “the\r\ntree with empty flowers.”\r\n\r\nBruguiera rheedii and Rhizophora mucronata were alone recorded by Dr.\r\nSeemann and his predecessors; but he significantly refers to the natives\r\nspeaking of four mangroves. Mr. Horne, who spent twelve months in the\r\ngroup some years later, also overlooked the American Rhizophora; but it\r\nis apparent that both these botanists were naturally more interested in\r\nthe vegetation of the inland regions than of the coast swamps, and we\r\nhave before observed that they failed to record Scirpodendron costatum,\r\na giant-sedge very common and conspicuous in the swamps. It is not easy\r\nto understand Dr. Seemann’s remark that “mangroves are restricted to but\r\nfew parts of the larger islands.” Horne, who was in the islands eighteen\r\nyears afterwards, makes frequent allusion to them. The natives whom I\r\nquestioned closely on this subject scouted the idea that any of the four\r\nmangroves above named were recent arrivals. The coasts, as they said,\r\nhad always been extensively fringed by mangroves; and the reader has\r\nonly to refer to my remarks in the second chapter of my volume on the\r\ngeology of Vanua Levu to convince himself that mangrove swamps of\r\nconsiderable extent existed in the time of Commodore Wilkes (1840).\r\n\r\n\r\n  _The Relative Abundance and Mode of Association of the three Fijian\r\n                         forms of Rhizophora._\r\n\r\nStated in their order of frequency, we have first Rhizophora mangle, the\r\nAmerican species, then Rhizophora mucronata, the Asiatic species, and\r\nlastly the Selala. The first is equally at home at the sea-border and on\r\nthe banks of brackish estuaries. The second is, as a rule, more\r\nexclusively at home on the sea-coasts; and the same may be said for the\r\nSelala. Usually all three kinds occur in the lower part of an estuary;\r\nbut as we ascend the river and the water freshens, the Asiatic\r\nRhizophora and the Selala disappear, and the American plant is alone\r\nfound in the higher reaches, where the density of the water ranges\r\naccording to the state of the tide between 1·000 and 1·010. I examined\r\nthe distribution of these three forms of Rhizophora in numerous\r\nestuaries of Vanua Levu, as well as in the Rewa estuary in Viti Levu;\r\nand it was ascertained that in all cases they followed the rule above\r\nindicated. When the estuary receives but few streams and the water is\r\nmostly salt, the three Rhizophoras may extend miles inland; but when it\r\ncontains a large body of fresh-water, Rhizophora mangle may be the only\r\nform observed from the mouth of the river to the head of the estuary,\r\nand it may monopolise the adjacent coasts. On the other hand, Rhizophora\r\nmucronata may occupy almost exclusively a long extent of coast; or the\r\nSelala may prevail in certain localities, as on parts of the Mathuata\r\ncoast of Vanua Levu.\r\n\r\nThe manner of association of these three Rhizophoras is of interest in\r\nconnection with the origin of the seedless Selala. They very rarely\r\noccur mingled together, but grow gregariously in contiguous colonies;\r\nand not uncommonly all three may occur on the same line of coast within\r\na distance of a few hundred yards. The colonies pass into each other\r\nwithout a break, and there is no fixed rule of association. Whilst on\r\nthe south side of Vanua Levu the Selala is generally associated with the\r\nAmerican Rhizophora, on the north side it is usually in touch with the\r\nAsiatic species. In other localities all three occur in contiguous\r\ncolonies. The Selala colony may be exposed on the line of a river-bank\r\nor along the sea-coast, or it may lie in the heart of an extensive\r\nmangrove tract. The most extensive mangrove region in Fiji, that of the\r\nRewa delta, is in great part occupied by Rhizophora mangle; but all\r\nthree forms grow together in the eastern part of the delta; and here,\r\nstrangely enough, as at Daku, the Selala may grow sporadically, and all\r\nthree may grow mixed together with their branches intercrossing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Characters of the Selala or Seedless Rhizophora compared with those\r\n   of the American Mangrove (R. mangle) and the Asiatic Mangrove (R.\r\n                              mucronata)._\r\n\r\nThe three kinds of Rhizophora, when seen at the same time along a tract\r\nof coast, may be readily distinguished by the different shades of green\r\nof their foliage, that of Selala being dark green, that of Rhizophora\r\nmucronata light green, and that of Rhizophora mangle intermediate in\r\nshade. The Selala is usually the tallest of the three, and attains a\r\nheight of from 20 to 30 feet or even 40 feet and over, the aerial roots\r\ndropped from the higher branches giving it a characteristic aspect.\r\nRhizophora mangle is generally the shortest, and at the coast is from 10\r\nto 12 feet high; but where the mangrove vegetation is most luxuriant, as\r\nin the great swamps in the interior of the Rewa delta, it forms tall\r\ntrees as much as 40 feet in height, displaying the aerial roots hanging\r\nfrom the higher branches. Rhizophora mucronata is, as a rule,\r\nintermediate in height, and is distinguished by its stout, reddish trunk\r\nand reddish aërial roots.\r\n\r\nThe trunks of Selala are often in an inclined position and supported\r\nentirely by the trestle-like aërial roots, the lower end raised some 5\r\nor 6 feet above the ground with the rest of the trunk inclined upwards.\r\nThey then look like gigantic walking-stick insects. The same habit may\r\nbe sometimes observed with the larger trees of Rhizophora mucronata, and\r\nin fact all three may present at times the same habit of growth. The\r\ntaller trees of Rhizophora mangle may resemble the Selala in habit, and\r\nthe smaller trees of the Selala may approach the habit of Rhizophora\r\nmangle.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive characters of the Selala are given in the table\r\nopposite. It will be there seen that this form is intermediate between\r\nthe other two species as regards the form and size of the petioles and\r\npeduncles; the size of the bracts and bracteoles; the colour, form, and\r\nsize of the flowers; and in the length of the style. Its leaves are\r\nsmaller than in the case of the other two species, but pointed and\r\nsemi-aristate like those of Rhizophora mucronata. There are, however,\r\ntwo varieties of the Selala, both with larger foliage than that\r\nbelonging to the prevailing type of the tree, and from 10 to 15 feet in\r\nheight. In one the flowers are more numerous, each flowering stem\r\nbranching four or five times and bearing at least twenty-four flowers,\r\nthe first branch being trichotomous and the rest dichotomous. In the\r\nother, which is the prevailing form on the Mathuata coast, there is a\r\nnearer approach to Rhizophora mucronata in the rounding of the peduncles\r\nand in the length of the style. Then, again, there are divergent\r\nvarieties of Rhizophora mangle which in the larger bracts and bracteoles\r\nand in the greater size, form, and paler hue of the flowers come nearer\r\nto the Selala. Taking all the characters together, the Selala, though\r\nintermediate between the Asiatic and the American species, comes in the\r\nmost critical diagnostic points, as in the inflorescence, in the\r\nindividual flowers, and in the form of the apex of the leaf, nearest to\r\nRhizophora mucronata, the Asiatic species.\r\n\r\nThe seedless character of the Selala is well known to most Fijians of\r\nthe coast districts, the native name signifying empty (lala) flowers\r\n(se). Now and then they aver that it produces fruit, but the numerous\r\noffers of rewards in money never resulted in their bringing me the\r\nfruits. During my residence of two years in the group I examined the\r\nSelala trees in a great number of localities and never succeeded in\r\nfinding them in fruit.\r\n\r\nWith all three kinds the anthers burst in the bud before it begins to\r\nopen, and we may ask why the process of self-fertilisation, which is\r\neffectual with the other two kinds, produces no result with the Selala.\r\nIn all three cases the flower-buds and expanded flowers hang downwards,\r\nand the expanded flowers retain their parts for the first twenty-four\r\nhours, the pollen being caught in quantity on the hairy edges of the\r\npetals. During the next day the withering stamens fall out, and on the\r\nfollowing day the petals fall too. With the Selala, the style soon\r\nbegins to blacken and wither, and in a few days the flower becomes\r\ndetached and drops off. With Rhizophora mucronata and Rhizophora mangle,\r\nthe style preserves its healthy condition, and shortly evidences of\r\nfertilisation appear in the altered shape of the ovary. It is apparent,\r\ntherefore, that in the case of the Selala fertilisation has not\r\noccurred, although the mechanical processes connected with it have been\r\ncarried out. The cause of this is not far to seek.\r\n\r\n +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------+\r\n |                 |                          FIJI                          |\r\n |   CHARACTERS    +------------------+------------------+------------------+\r\n |                 |   RHIZOPHORA     | SELALA (a        |   RHIZOPHORA     |\r\n |                 |   MUCRONATA.     | seedless form).  |    MANGLE.       |\r\n +-----------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+\r\n |Height of tree   |                  |                  |                  |\r\n | in feet         |    12-20.        |     20-40.       |      9-12.       |\r\n |                 |                  |                  |                  |\r\n |Colour of foliage|Pale green.       |Dark green.       |Intermediate      |\r\n |                 |                  |                  |shade.            |\r\n |                 |                  |                  |                  |\r\n |Base of leaf     |Tapering.         |Sub-rounded.      |Tapering.         |\r\n |                 |                  |                  |                  |\r\n |Apex of leaf     |Acute, and        |Acute, and        |Very obtuse,      |\r\n |                 |terminating       |terminating in    |with no           |\r\n |                 |in a twisted      |a twisted point   |twisted point.    |\r\n |                 |point a line      |less than a line  |                  |\r\n |                 |(2·5 mm.) long.   |(2·5 mm.) long.   |                  |\r\n |                 |                  |                  |                  |\r\n |Leaf-stalk       |Rounded, 1 -      |Rather flattened  |Length as in      |\r\n | (petiole)       |1-2/10 inch,      |horizontally,     |Selala, but       |\r\n |                 |(25-30 mm.) long, |5-8/10th inch     |flattening        |\r\n |                 |about as long as  |(12-20mm.) long,  |very marked.      |\r\n |                 |the peduncle.     |shorter than the  |                  |\r\n |                 |                  |peduncle.         |                  |\r\n |                 |                  |                  |                  |\r\n |Inflorescence    |Branching         |Branching usually |Usually branching |\r\n |                 |(dichotomous) two |twice, but        |only once         |\r\n |                 |or three times    |sometimes three   |(trichotomous) and|\r\n |                 |with four to eight|times;

The pollen of these three mangroves\r\nwas examined in five localities far apart from each other, and in all\r\nthe same results were obtained. The pollen-grains of the Selala are much\r\nsmaller than those of the other two, and differ much from them in form.\r\nThey are irregularly oval in outline, and have a shrunken look beside\r\nthe spherical symmetrical grains of the two species with which they are\r\ncompared. They are from one-fourth to one-third the size of those of\r\nRhizophora mucronata, and from one-third to one-half the size of those\r\nof Rhizophora mangle.\r\n\r\nThere is much to support the view that the Selala is a cross between the\r\nother two species, its intermediate characters and its seedless\r\ncondition being especially indicative of such a derivation; but there\r\nare several difficulties in accepting this explanation.\r\n\r\n(1) The circumstance of the anthers bursting in the flower-bud would\r\nconsiderably lessen the chances of cross-fertilisation; but this\r\nobjection is not insurmountable, since numerous insects, such as flies,\r\nants, and small coleoptera, visit the newly opened flowers, and they\r\nmight sometimes produce a result. When I made this suggestion to Prof.\r\nSchimper he replied that insect-pollination was quite possible after the\r\nexpansion of the flowers.\r\n\r\n(2) If, as seems highly probable, the pollen of Selala is impotent\r\nand the ovules fertilisable, then its seedless condition implies not\r\nonly an incapacity for self-fertilisation, but also for\r\ncross-fertilisation; and if Selala with its impotent pollen does not\r\nadmit of cross-fertilisation, this would still less be expected of\r\nRhizophora mucronata and R. mangle where the pollen is potent and\r\nwhere fertilisation takes place in the bud. I endeavoured to\r\nfertilise the Selala flowers with the pollen of the two other\r\nspecies; but there were no results, the flowers falling off in a few\r\ndays. It may here be remarked that on one Selala tree I found a\r\nsolitary flower with an enlarged ovary, as if through fertilisation.\r\n\r\n(3) It is not easy to explain the gregarious growth of the Selala if it\r\nis a seedless hybrid. The colonies could not be renovated by mere\r\nintercrossing, especially in places where, as on the north coast of\r\nVanua Levu, the dense belt of mangrove is for many miles composed in\r\nmass of Selala trees, with a few trees of the Asiatic and American\r\nRhizophoras growing on the outskirts.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that in order to clear the way for considering this\r\nproblem the means of renovating the Selala colonies should be inquired\r\ninto. In the first place, whilst seedlings occur in numbers under the\r\ntrees of the other two Rhizophoras they are never to be found under the\r\nSelala trees. The mode of reproduction of the Selala is evidently\r\nvegetative, and the question arises as to what mode of vegetative\r\nreproduction occurs. The Selala trunks, as already observed, are often\r\ninclined, the trunks being supported on trestle-like aërial roots. These\r\ntrunks send out branches which in their turn drop aërial roots; and when\r\nthe decay of the parent trunk takes place, the branches are able to live\r\nindependently. The primary branches in due time send out secondary\r\nbranches which also let fall aërial roots; and thus the process is\r\nrepeated indefinitely, the result being a maze of semi-prone trunks,\r\nbranches, and aërial roots. The first stage of the process ends with the\r\ndeath of the parent trunk, and the primary branch, supported by its own\r\naërial roots, is often all that the observer can distinguish in the\r\ncentre of a colony. This is evidently the mode by which the Selala\r\ncolonies are renovated in their interior. One sometimes observes in the\r\nmidst of one of these colonies extensive bare mud-flats 100 to 500 yards\r\nacross from which apparently the trees have died off _en masse_. The\r\nnatives assert that when part of a Selala tract is cleared the trees\r\nnever grow again.\r\n\r\nBut _pari passu_ with this process of vegetative reproduction of the\r\nSelala, by which the mass of the colony is preserved and renovated,\r\nthere is evidently some other process of reproduction in operation\r\namongst the trees of Rhizophora mangle and R. mucronata at the edge of\r\nthe colony, as a result of which Selala seedlings are produced. Whilst\r\nno seedlings are to be observed striking into the mud under the Selala\r\ntrees, numbers occur, as before observed, under the trees of the other\r\ntwo species. Those under the trees of R. mangle possess in nearly all\r\nthe cases the distinctive leaf-characters of that mangrove, and would be\r\nrecognised at once as belonging to that species. On the other hand,\r\nthose beneath the trees of R. mucronata are of two kinds, some of them\r\nbeing readily recognised by their foliage as of the Selala type others,\r\nagain, being typical seedlings of R. mucronata. Only those seedlings, or\r\n“keimlings” as we might term them, were noted that had dropped plumb\r\nfrom the branches above.\r\n\r\nSuch were the results of my investigations on Vanua Levu. My field of\r\ninquiry was then shifted to the Rewa delta, where, with the assistance\r\nof the Daku natives, who, like most Fijians, display a keen interest in\r\nmatters relating to their plants, I spent a few days in investigating\r\nthe origin of the Selala trees that grow sporadically in that locality.\r\nOn pulling up some of the young trees we found that the original\r\nradicular or hypocotyledonary portion of the keimling could be still\r\ndistinguished. My zealous native friends also pointed out to me that\r\nthough the leaves in form and colour were those of the Selala, the\r\nrootstock was reddish like that of R. mucronata, and not white as with\r\nR. mangle. The natives averred that the Selala trees are produced in the\r\nfirst place from fruits of R. mucronata. When young, they said, they are\r\nTiri-tambuas (R. mucronata), but when old, Selalas. Yet although R.\r\nmucronata may be now regarded as the source of the Selala trees, and my\r\nVanua Levu observations pointed unmistakably in this direction, it could\r\nnot be definitely settled whether this was the result of a cross with\r\nthe male element of R. mangle or whether the Tiri-tambua (R. mucronata),\r\nin producing two types of seedlings, one fertile with the parent\r\ncharacters and the other seedless of the Selala type, brought about the\r\nsame end. On the whole I am inclined to the view that the Asiatic\r\nRhizophora presents us in the dimorphism of its seedlings the true\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nThis inference is supported by the behaviour of Rhizophora mangle on the\r\ncoast of Ecuador, a subject which is discussed in Chapter XXXII, and I\r\nhave given the results of my observations on the Ecuadorian Rhizophoras\r\nside by side with those on the Fijian trees in the table before given.\r\nThere are two very distinct forms of the American Rhizophora (R. mangle)\r\nin the swamps of Ecuador. There is the low coast tree, the “Mangle\r\nchico” of the Ecuadorians, ten to fifteen feet in average height, which\r\ngrows on the sea-front of the swamps and has all the general appearance\r\nand the more conspicuous characters of the American Rhizophora in Fiji.\r\nThere is also a tall tree, 60, 80, or even 100 feet high, that forms the\r\ngreat mass of the mangrove swamps. In its inflorescence, in the dark\r\ngreen colour of its foliage, and in other characters, it comes near the\r\nFijian Selala; but it differs in fruiting abundantly. This is locally\r\ntermed the “Mangle grande,” and its true relation to the Fijian Selala\r\nappears to be as follows. Whilst both as regards the flowers approach\r\nthe Asiatic Rhizophora (R. mucronata), the Fijian Selala resembles the\r\nAsiatic tree also in its foliage, whilst the “Mangle grande” or the\r\nEcuadorian Selala more resembles the typical American tree (R. mangle)\r\nin its leaves and also in its seedlings. Here in the Ecuadorian swamps\r\nthere can be no question of crossing, since both, according to Baron von\r\nEggers, belong to one species. Therefore I am inclined to the opinion\r\nthat whilst the Asiatic Rhizophora displays dimorphism in Fiji, the\r\nAmerican Rhizophora displays dimorphism in Ecuador. The reversion on the\r\npart of the “Mangle grande” of Ecuador to some of the characters of the\r\nAsiatic plant is remarkable, and points to the greater antiquity of the\r\nAsiatic R. mucronata as compared with the American R. mangle.\r\n\r\nThis accords with the opinion expressed by Schimper in his work on the\r\nIndo-Malayan strand flora that the American Rhizophora is either a\r\ndegenerated descendant of the Asiatic R. mucronata or a sister form\r\nderived from a common ancestor. America, as we have seen, possesses only\r\none of the three species of Rhizophora, and this is the only\r\nrepresentative that it owns of the four Asiatic genera (Rhizophora,\r\nKandelia, Ceriops, Bruguiera) that constitute the tribe Rhizophoreæ. The\r\nrule prevailing with current-dispersed plants that America is a\r\ndistributor and not a recipient evidently does not apply to the\r\nRhizophoreæ; and to explain their distribution we must go back to some\r\nepoch very remote from the present. That Fiji derived its\r\nrepresentatives of Rhizophora mangle from America by the agency of the\r\ncurrents I do not for a moment admit. The restriction of the species and\r\nindeed also of the genus to the Western Pacific is very significant. It\r\nis far more likely that, as I have pointed out in the case of Lindenia\r\n(see page 396), the American Rhizophora was once widely distributed over\r\nthe tropics of the Old and New Worlds, and that it is now on the “down\r\ngrade” towards extinction. Its survival in the Western Pacific could\r\nthus be explained without our being obliged to suppose that the\r\nseedlings or keimlings have been carried uninjured across the Pacific\r\nOcean, an ocean voyage for which, as shown in a later page, they are not\r\nwell fitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n   _The Occasional Occurrence of more than one Seed in the Fruits of\r\n      Rhizophora mucronata and Rhizophora mangle (Polyembryony)._\r\n\r\nThe bilocular ovary contains four ovules, one of which only as a rule\r\nbecomes a seed. But it is incorrect to say that the fruits are always\r\none-seeded, since two or even three seeds are occasionally produced, and\r\nthey may all germinate. In November, 1897, I noted eight hundred fruits\r\nof Rhizophora mangle germinating on the trees in one of the creeks of\r\nthe Rewa delta. Out of this number eight fruits had two germinating\r\nseeds and one had three, the protruding radicles being in all stages of\r\ngrowth. Just two years afterwards I counted eight hundred more fruits in\r\nthe same locality, and then observed seven with two germinating seeds\r\nand none with three, the radicles protruding in all cases. On another\r\noccasion at Wailevu in Savu-Savu Bay I counted four hundred, and none\r\nhad more than a single radicle protruding. The results appear to vary\r\nwith the locality, but in the Rewa creek the proportion of fruits in\r\nwhich more than one seed germinated was fairly constant at dates two\r\nyears apart, namely, about one per cent. Occasionally, however, in\r\nparticular localities a greater proportion may be noticed. Thus near\r\nDaku in the Rewa delta I found that the proportion was between two and\r\nthree per cent. for the same species (R. mangle), those with three\r\ngerminating seeds being about half per cent.\r\n\r\nThe case of more than one seed germinating in the fruits of Rhizophora\r\nmucronata never came under my observation; but in one locality, where I\r\nexamined a considerable number of fruits near the stage of germination,\r\nbetween ten and fifteen per cent. showed two seeds approaching maturity.\r\n\r\nWarming thoroughly investigated the polyembryony of Rhizophora more than\r\ntwenty years ago, seemingly from materials brought to him from the West\r\nIndies (Engler’s _Botanische Jahrbücher_, band iv., 1883). With the\r\nusual German thoroughness he deals with the work of earlier observers,\r\nand goes back to Piso in the middle of the 17th century. Of the four\r\novules, he remarks, three usually abort, and only in rare cases are two\r\nseeds developed. He quotes Baron von Eggers to the effect that only in\r\nthree per thousand cases was more than one seedling observed protruding\r\nfrom a germinating fruit. These remarks evidently all apply to the\r\nAmerican species. I do not find any reference in my notes to\r\npolyembryony in Ecuador, and evidently its occurrence is not so frequent\r\nthere as in Fiji.\r\n\r\nIt is frequently apparent in the cases where more than one seed\r\ngerminates in a fruit that on account of the difference in the length of\r\nthe protruding seedlings germination does not always begin at the same\r\ntime. Thus in Fiji the difference in the length varied between one and\r\nthree inches, an amount representing at least from ten to twenty days’\r\ngrowth, as will be subsequently pointed out. Warming in one of his\r\nfigures gives a fruit where an interval of some months seems to be\r\nindicated, since one of the seedlings has fallen out and the other is\r\nprotruding less than an inch. By cutting across a fruit containing two\r\nseeds one may sometimes observe one seed quiescent and the other\r\nbeginning to germinate. The significance of this occasional interval\r\nbetween the germination of seeds in the same fruit will be referred to\r\nin a later page.\r\n\r\n\r\n _The Seasons of Flowering and Fruiting of the Species of Rhizophora in\r\n                                 Fiji._\r\n\r\nThe Selala flowers all the year. With the two American and Asiatic\r\nspecies there are considerable variations between different localities.\r\nGenerally speaking, they flower and fruit all the year through; but the\r\nflowers are usually less abundant in the warm season from December to\r\nFebruary, and the germinating fruits which are to be observed on the\r\ntrees every month of the year are more numerous in that season.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _The History of the Reproductive Process in Rhizophora from the\r\n Fertilisation of the Ovule to the Falling of the Plantlet or Seedling\r\n                            from the Tree._\r\n\r\nI devoted great attention to this subject in the instance of Rhizophora\r\nmangle, being desirous of determining two points, in the first place as\r\nto whether there was any period of rest between the maturation and\r\ngermination of the seed, and in the second place as to the period that\r\nelapsed between the commencement of germination and the fall of the\r\nseedling.\r\n\r\nThe principal change in the ovary for the first three or four weeks\r\nafter fertilisation is shown in its increased breadth. The increase in\r\nheight is but slight during this period; and in fact after thirty days\r\nthe ovary only added 2 millimetres to its original height of 3\r\nmillimetres. After this the growth of the fruit proceeds until the tip\r\nof the radicle pierces its summit, the fruit being then about eleven\r\nlines (2·8 cm.) long. _From the date of fertilisation to the time the\r\nradicle pierces the top of the fruit a period of about fifteen weeks\r\nelapses._ (The fruit, it should be here remarked, continues to grow in\r\nlength and breadth after the radicle has protruded, attaining a length\r\nof thirteen or fourteen lines [3·5 cm.] when the seedling or “keimling”\r\nis ready to fall.)\r\n\r\nBy referring to the table below it will be observed that there is no\r\nperiod of rest in the growth of the fruit up to the date of the\r\nprotrusion of the radicle. It will now be shown that there is normally\r\nno pause between the epoch of the maturation of the seed and the\r\nbeginning of germination, or, in other words, that from the time of the\r\nfertilisation of the ovule to the onset of germination there is no\r\ncessation in the process of growth of the embryo. That period of dormant\r\nvitality which almost all seeds pass through forms no normal feature in\r\nthe life-history of this species of Rhizophora.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  RHIZOPHORA MANGLE AND R.

It\r\nwould be out of place here to deal with the biological significance of a\r\nprocess to which observers like Warming, Goebel, Karsten, Schimper and\r\nHaberlandt have applied their greater talents as well as their greater\r\nexperience. I investigated the subject carefully from my own standpoint\r\nof inquiry, and whilst the reader will find in my rough sketches of the\r\nvarious stages of the process a little aid in following the argument, he\r\nis referred for detailed treatment of the subject to the memoirs of the\r\nabove-named botanists as well as to those of yet more recent\r\ninvestigators.\r\n\r\nAfter fertilisation, according to Prof. Schimper (_Ind. Mal.\r\nStrandflora_), the embryo-sac is filled with endosperm, which\r\nsubsequently protrudes and forms a plug completely closing the micropyle\r\n(see my figures). As my observations showed, the seed during the first\r\neight weeks after fertilisation increases continuously in size, and the\r\nplug of endosperm, at first inconspicuous, becomes of considerable size,\r\nthe seed attaining a length of seven millimetres. The embryo meanwhile\r\ngrows rapidly, and at the end of this period of eight weeks the\r\nradicular tip or the point of the hypocotyl begins to protrude from the\r\nmicopyle, still covered by the plug of endosperm, the fruit being\r\nbetween four and five lines (10-12 mm.) in length (figures 11-14). In\r\nanother week, when the fruit has grown another line in length, the tip\r\nof the radicle is on the eve of piercing the plug, and this may be\r\ntermed _the commencement of germination, nine weeks after the act of\r\nfertilisation_. The next stage, after an interval of one and a half\r\nweeks, is illustrated in figure 15; and _after a period of about fifteen\r\nweeks from the date of fertilisation the tip of the radicle pierces the\r\ntop of the fruit_. As shown in the figures, the fruit grows in length\r\nthroughout the process.\r\n\r\nThe question as to whether the matured seed passes through a stage of\r\nquiescence before it germinates finds its answer in the statement that\r\nonly nine weeks elapse between fertilisation and germination. It may,\r\nhowever, be urged that the maturation of the seed could be accomplished\r\nin a few weeks, and that after this a period of dormant vitality might\r\nfollow. This objection can be at once disposed of and the whole matter\r\nplaced beyond reasonable doubt by making, as I did, a large number of\r\nvertical sections of the fruit in all its stages. It will then be\r\nperceived that there is a fairly constant relation in all stages of\r\ngrowth between the seed and the fruit, whether maturating or\r\ngerminating. Since the growth of the fruit is continuous (see Table) up\r\nto the time of the protrusion of the tip of the hypocotyl through its\r\ncoats, it follows that there can be no appreciable pause between the\r\ncompletion of maturation and the commencement of germination of the\r\nseed. In other words, both fruit and seed preserve the same relation\r\nduring the process, and the absence of any period of rest is to be\r\ninferred from the uninterrupted growth of the fruit.\r\n\r\nWe will take, to illustrate this point, a fruit between four and five\r\nlines long in the stage that immediately precedes germination (see\r\nfigure 11). The fruit proceeds with its growth, and the seed, we will\r\nsuppose, remains quiescent for a month. At the end of that time (see\r\nTable) the fruit would be eight lines long, and the seed, of course,\r\nwould be unchanged. This condition of things never presented itself to\r\nme. Fruits eight lines long were always far advanced in germination (see\r\nfigure 15). If the seed passes through an interval of rest before\r\ngermination, it must be of a very short duration and practically _nil_.\r\n\r\nThis absence of any period of rest between the final maturation of the\r\nseed and its fertilisation had already been assumed by Prof. Schimper.\r\nWriting to me on July 14, 1898, when my observations were in progress,\r\nhe says:—“I am ready to assume, according to my own experience, that\r\nthere is continuous development until the falling off of the embryo.\r\nMore accurate observations on the subject would be interesting, and\r\nwould not present any great difficulties.” At the end of the same month\r\nhe wrote the preface to his great work on Plant-Geography; and he\r\nexpresses himself decidedly on this point. Speaking of Rhizophora\r\nmucronata (English edition, p. 396), he says that “the fruit ... soon\r\nafter the completion of its growth is pierced at its summit by the green\r\nhypocotyl, as the embryo does not undergo any period of rest, but\r\ncontinues to develop without interruption.”\r\n\r\nThough the rest-period is normally non-existent with the seeds of\r\nRhizophora, it has already been observed that it is indicated in rare\r\ncases and under exceptional conditions. Thus I have already remarked\r\nthat in Fiji about one per cent. of the germinating fruits of the\r\nAmerican species exhibit more than one seed. These seeds usually begin\r\nto germinate about the same time, but in a few cases, say, one in ten, a\r\nmarked difference in the length of the protruding hypocotyls points to\r\nthe fact that one of the seeds began to germinate some weeks after the\r\nother. We at times also meet with fruits which when cut across display\r\ntwo seeds, of which only one is beginning to germinate. Such cases\r\nindicative of a pause between the maturation of the seed and the\r\nbeginning of germination would be very rare. With Rhizophora mangle,\r\nprobably one in a thousand fruits would be a generous estimate.\r\n\r\nIn passing it may be remarked that the same stages occur with Rhizophora\r\nmucronata in the development of the seed and in the subsequent\r\ngerminating process. When the fruit is three lines long the micropyle is\r\nbut slightly dilated (see figures 1 and 2). When it is four lines long\r\nthe endosperm begins to escape from the gaping micropyle and forms a\r\nprojecting plug. The growth of the embryo now becomes rapid, the\r\nendosperm escapes in greater quantity, and by the time the fruit is five\r\nlines long the tip of the radicle is on a level with the micropyle,\r\nalthough still covered by the plug (see figures 4, 5). After this,\r\ngermination begins; and when the fruit is six lines in length the\r\nradicle is in the act of penetrating the plug. Ultimately the tip of the\r\nradicle pierces the top of the fruit when this last is nine or ten lines\r\nlong. As shown in the figures there is continuous growth of the fruit\r\nduring the maturation and germination of the seed, until, in fact, the\r\nplantlet drops into the water. With reference to the stage when\r\ngermination begins, it should be remarked that the formation of the\r\nlarge plug of endosperm outside the micropyle does not necessarily\r\nindicate the beginning of germination. Germination is in progress only\r\nwhen the hypocotyl or radicle begins to lengthen and is on the point of\r\npiercing the plug of endosperm that fills up the gaping micropyle. This\r\nis well shown in this species in the case of fruits with two seeds. Both\r\nseeds may have large plugs of endosperm, and yet only one may show\r\nindications of germination in the lengthening hypocotyl.\r\n\r\nWe must now return to the subject of the growth of the hanging seedling\r\nof Rhizophora mangle. We have already remarked that, as shown in the\r\nTable, about fifteen weeks (107 days) is the average time elapsing\r\nbetween the fertilisation of the ovule and the protrusion of the tip of\r\nthe radicle through the top of the fruit. A further period of seventeen\r\nand a half weeks (122 days) is occupied by the growth of the seedling on\r\nthe tree, at the end of which period it drops into the water or mud\r\naccording to the state of the tide. This gives a total period of nearly\r\nthirty-three weeks (229 days) as the duration of the time between\r\nfertilisation and the fall of the seedling. This may be divided, as has\r\nbeen already implied, in the following manner:—\r\n\r\n   (1) Period between fertilisation and germination.         9 weeks.\r\n\r\n   (2) Period between the commencement of germination           6-1/2\r\n    and the protrusion of the tip of the       radicle         weeks.\r\n   through the top of the fruit.\r\n\r\n   (3) Period occupied by the growth of the hypocotyl          17-1/2\r\n    outside the fruit, and terminating in       the fall       weeks.\r\n   of the seedling from the tree.\r\n\r\n                                                                   ——\r\n\r\n   Total                                                    33 weeks.\r\n\r\nThis represents the average of numerous observations, the deviations\r\nbeing from two to three weeks on either side. In the latter part of its\r\ngrowth, the lower end of the hypocotyl becomes thickened or club-like,\r\nand during the last week or ten days the increase in length is arrested\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nMy observations on the growth of the seedling on the tree of Rhizophora\r\nmucronata were comparatively few; but, as shown in the Table on page 453\r\nthey give nearly the same rate of growth. Taking the average length\r\nattained by the hypocotyl on the tree at sixteen inches, and employing\r\nas well the data supplied by Rhizophora mangle, a period of 26-1/2 weeks\r\nwould elapse from the time the hypocotyl pierces the top of the fruit\r\nuntil the plantlet falls from the tree. If we then add, as in the case\r\nof the other species, 15-1/2 weeks for the preceding period between\r\nfertilisation and the protrusion of the hypocotyl, we get a total of 42\r\nweeks for the whole period from fertilisation to the fall of the\r\nseedling. In the extreme cases where a length of almost two feet is\r\nattained on the tree, the period would somewhat exceed twelve months;\r\nand in those rare instances in other regions, when, according to\r\nSchimper, the seedling is a metre in length, probably eighteen months\r\nwould be required. The period for Rhizophora mucronata is thus\r\nconsiderably longer than for R. mangle, which is sufficiently indicated\r\nby the difference in the average length of their hypocotyls on the tree\r\nin Fiji, that for R. mucronata being sixteen inches, and that for R.\r\nmangle nine or ten inches.\r\n\r\nThe only other observations that have come under my notice relating to\r\nthis subject are those made by Jacquin on Rhizophora mangle in the West\r\nIndies in the middle of the eighteenth century. The results are\r\nliterally quoted by Warming; but I have referred to the original account\r\nin the work of Jacquin, entitled _Selectarum Stirpium Americanarum\r\nHistoria_, Vindobonæ, 1763. According to this observer the seedling\r\nfalls from the tree in the twelfth month from the fecundation of the\r\nflower. This happened in my observations on the same species in Fiji in\r\nthe eighth or ninth month. Jacquin states that the tip of the radicle\r\nprotrudes from the fruit in the third month, whilst my results give it\r\nas taking place in the fourth month. The difference in the length of the\r\ntotal period, it may be remarked, would be to a great extent determined\r\nby the varying length acquired by the seedling before it drops from the\r\ntree. In ordinary conditions it averages about ten or eleven inches, and\r\nthe hypocotyl itself attains a length of nine or ten inches on the tree,\r\nboth in Fiji and Ecuador; but in sheltered localities it may attain a\r\nlength half as long again. I have already pointed out in the case of the\r\nfruits of Rhizophora mucronata that a year and more would be sometimes\r\nrequired, and the same remark would apply to unusually long fruits of R.\r\nmangle. Local conditions would often produce varying results, both in\r\nthe rate of growth of the hanging seedling and in the duration of the\r\nperiod of its attachment to the tree; but it is probable that nine or\r\nten months would represent for the genus the average length of the\r\nperiod between fertilisation of the ovule and the detachment of the\r\nseedling from the parent tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n   _The mode of separation of the seedlings of Rhizophora mangle and\r\n                         Rhizophora mucronata_\r\n\r\nThis is a process of expulsion almost akin to parturition, and is\r\nbrought about by the outward growth of the neck of the cotyledonary\r\nbody. There is much that is of great interest in this subject; and I may\r\nadd that Haberlandt, in a memoir published in the _Annales du Jardin\r\nBotanique de Buitenzorg_ for 1894, gives the results of an elaborate\r\nstudy of the viviparous process in this and other genera of mangroves.\r\nThe same analogy seems also to have presented itself to him, but only in\r\nconnection with the means employed in some of the genera, as with\r\nBruguiera, for conveying nourishment to the growing embryo. He remarks\r\nthat he was involuntarily reminded by these structures of the\r\nchorion-tufts and lobes in the placenta of mammals, and that such\r\nstructures in the mammal are functionally nothing more than true\r\n_haustoria_ as found in the viviparous mangroves.\r\n\r\nWhen studying the germination of the American and Asiatic Rhizophoras in\r\nFiji, I observed that the neck of the cotyledonary body did not begin to\r\nform, nor the inclosed plumular bud to show signs of differentiation,\r\nuntil the hypocotyl had protruded about 4-1/2 inches with R. mangle, and\r\nbetween 6 and 7 inches with R. mucronata. The neck of the cotyledonary\r\nbody then proceeds to grow in length, pushing before it the plumular end\r\nof the embryo-seedling, which it surrounds as a sheath. This operation\r\ncontinues until the hypocotyl has acquired a length of about seven\r\ninches with R. mangle, and about nine inches with R. mucronata, when the\r\nneck begins to protrude outside the fruit. The cotyledonary neck\r\nproceeds with its growth, and by the time the seedling is ready to fall\r\nfrom the tree it protrudes about an inch from the fruit-shell, having\r\ncarried the growing plumular bud with it. The plumular end of the\r\nseedling has been now more or less expelled from the fruit-cavity, and\r\nthe connection between the suspended seedling and the fruit now alone\r\ndepends on a slight bond between the base of the plumule and the inner\r\nmargin of the cotyledonary neck, as indicated by a cross in the figures\r\ngiven in the plate. The union is soon broken and the seedling falls.\r\n\r\nWhether there is anything more than an analogy between the expulsion of\r\na Rhizophora seedling and the birth of a mammal seems most unlikely; but\r\nthe process is at all events a very remarkable one.\r\n\r\n\r\n            _The means of dispersal of the genus Rhizophora_\r\n\r\nMy experiments and observations were for the most part made on the\r\nAsiatic and American species in Fiji; but I enjoyed the opportunity of\r\nconfirming some important points on the coast of Ecuador. We can only\r\nlook to the currents for the explanation of the capacity of the genus to\r\ncross tracts of ocean; but, given this capacity, there is much that is\r\ndifficult to understand in the distribution of the genus and of a\r\nspecies like Rhizophora mangle; and it is probable that we shall have to\r\nlook behind the means of dispersal to a distant age in the distribution\r\nof shore-plants of the mangrove type.\r\n\r\nWhen Schimper published his work on the Indo-Malayan strand flora in\r\n1891, but little was known of the duration of the floating capacity of\r\nRhizophora seedlings (p. 166). In giving the results of my\r\ninvestigations I am merely describing the agencies of dispersal at\r\npresent in operation. Such agencies have their limitations, and we may,\r\nperhaps, be thus able to explain why Rhizophora is restricted in the\r\nPacific islands to the archipelagoes of the Western Pacific; but many\r\nserious objections would at once present themselves if we regarded the\r\noccurrence of the genus in America, as well as in Asia and Africa, as a\r\nmatter depending on capacities and means of dispersal.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of Rhizophora, as they display themselves before the\r\nprotrusion of the germinating seed, have no buoyancy, and the\r\ngerminating fruits until the hypocotyl has protruded for some inches (6\r\ninches in the case of R. mangle) also sink in sea-water. With a further\r\nincrease in the length of the hypocotyl, the germinating fruit acquires\r\nbuoyancy; and when the seedling, usually 10 or 11 inches in length,\r\nbecomes detached from the fruit on the tree and falls into the sea, it\r\nfloats readily in 95 per cent. of the cases. Such seedlings occur very\r\ncommonly in the floating drift of the estuaries and out at sea both in\r\nFiji and in Ecuador.\r\n\r\nOut of five seedlings of the Asiatic species, Rhizophora mucronata, that\r\nhad fallen naturally from the tree, three were afloat and healthy after\r\neighty-seven days’ immersion in sea-water. Out of twenty seedlings of\r\nthe American mangrove, Rhizophora mangle, sixteen floated after ninety\r\ndays and four were afloat and healthy after one hundred and twenty days,\r\nthe greater number sinking during the fourth month. These results\r\nindicate considerable powers of buoyancy, and go to show that extensive\r\ntracts of ocean could be traversed by the floating seedling.\r\n\r\nIt should, however, be observed that not all the full-sized seedlings\r\nfloat. With Rhizophora mangle about 5 per cent. sink in sea-water and\r\nfrom 20 to 50 per cent. sink in fresh-water; whilst with R. mucronata\r\nthe proportion of non-buoyant seedlings is rather greater. There would\r\nthus appear to be a rather nice adjustment of the specific weight of the\r\nseedlings to the density of sea-water. Generally speaking, they may be\r\nseen floating vertically or steeply inclined in the fresh-water of\r\nestuaries and horizontally in the sea. With the buoyant seedlings of\r\nRhizophora mucronata, as a rule, about 90 per cent. float horizontally\r\nin sea-water, and about 70 per cent. float vertically or steeply\r\ninclined in fresh-water. The same general rule applies to R. mangle,\r\nwhether in the rivers and seas of Fiji or in those of Ecuador. In those\r\ncases where the seedling drops prematurely on account either of storms\r\nand floods or of the depredations of a grub that frequently attacks the\r\nfruit, this rule would not apply. One may frequently notice in Fiji\r\nafter heavy weather that seedlings detached prematurely, and often\r\ncarrying the fruit, are floating in numbers horizontally in the rivers.\r\nIn a few days, as a rule, the fruit-case becomes detached and sinks.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that the horizontal position is much better adapted\r\nfor the safety of the seedling in transport than the vertical position.\r\nIn the last case the plumule, which protrudes above the water, would be\r\nunable, as indicated in my experiments, to withstand the scorching rays\r\nof the sun in a smooth sea; whereas in the horizontal position, which\r\nthe seedlings assume in sea-water, the plumule is more or less\r\ncompletely submerged, and the risk of withering in the sun is very much\r\nless. The Rhizophora seedlings would certainly have little chance of\r\ncrossing in safety a large tract of sea, if they floated, as they do in\r\nriver-water, with the plumule exposed above the surface. It is not\r\nunlikely that the comparatively restricted area occupied by Rhizophora\r\nconjugata may be due to the attitude its seedlings assume when floating\r\nin sea-water.\r\n\r\nThe stranded seedlings of Rhizophora readily establish themselves for a\r\nwhile in very different situations; and it is by no means necessary that\r\nthey should be washed ashore on a muddy coast. When half-buried amongst\r\nthe heap of vegetable drift piled up on a sandy beach they are\r\nfrequently to be found striking into the sand and showing their first\r\nleaves. Here they ultimately perish in the great majority of cases; but\r\nwhen protected long enough to reach the moist sand four or five inches\r\nbelow, they may give rise to a little mangrove colony. When caught in a\r\nfissure in the bare reef-flats these plantlets are sometimes able to\r\nestablish themselves. Rhizophora seedlings would, however, require a\r\ncoast prepared by them by the work of ages before they could form\r\nextensive swamps. It is, therefore, not surprising that Prof. Penzig\r\nfound no evidence of mangrove-settlements on the shores of Krakatoa\r\nfourteen years after the eruption.\r\n\r\nYet suited as Rhizophora seedlings are for crossing tracts of sea, I\r\nregard them as quite unfitted for being transported by the currents\r\nunharmed across an ocean. The plumular bud is insufficiently protected\r\nfor such a long voyage of many months, and perhaps of years. Though the\r\nhorizontal position of the seedling would secure the plumule against\r\nbeing scorched in the sun, it increases considerably the risk of injury\r\nfrom direct impact.\r\n\r\nAs bearing on their capacity for dispersal in other fashions, it may be\r\nremarked that Rhizophora seedlings can withstand long drying. Five which\r\nhad been kept dry for nine weeks, after having been found stranded on a\r\nbeach, were planted in the mud of a mangrove-swamp. In a fortnight two\r\nof them were developing the first leaves and throwing out roots. As long\r\nas they are protected by a covering of vegetable _débris_ and sand, the\r\nstranded seedlings might retain their vitality for months.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       BRUGUIERA RHEEDII (Blume)\r\n\r\nThis species is reduced in Hooker’s _Flora of British India_ to\r\nBruguiera gymnorhiza (Lam.), and thus viewed it has a very wide range in\r\nthe Old World, corresponding very much to that of Rhizophora mucronata,\r\nnamely, tropical East Africa, tropical East Asia to the Liukiu Islands,\r\nthe Indian Archipelago, New Guinea, tropical Australia, and Western\r\nPolynesia, as in New Caledonia, Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa. There are four\r\nor five species of the genus, but all are confined to the Eastern\r\nHemisphere, none occurring in America.\r\n\r\nAs with the species of Rhizophora, this plant is indebted for its\r\npresent dispersal to the floating seedling, which, however, often falls\r\nfrom the tree whilst still attached to the fruit, but is generally freed\r\nin a day or two. The seedlings float for a long time in sea-water. I\r\nkept one of them afloat for 117 days, when it was quite sound and\r\nhealthy. They appear to be better fitted than the species of Rhizophora\r\nfor the “rough-and-tumble” of ocean transport, since the plumule is much\r\nless prominent, projecting only one line (2·5 mm.) or less, whilst with\r\nthe two Fijian species of Rhizophora the plumule measures from seven to\r\ntwelve lines (18 to 30 mm.). In the latter part of the year they are to\r\nbe found in abundance in the floating drift of rivers, and there they\r\nreadily develop the first leaves and roots. They are also frequent in\r\nthe sea off the coasts, and they are stranded in large numbers on the\r\nbeaches, where they readily strike into the sand when partially buried\r\namongst the vegetable drift.\r\n\r\nThe empty flowers and the germinated fruits containing the cotyledons\r\nare very common in floating drift. They look much alike, but the flowers\r\nare much smaller and possess the long style, whilst the fruits contain\r\nthe cotyledons at the bottom of the seed-cavity.\r\n\r\nAs with Rhizophora, there is a rather curious adjustment of the buoyancy\r\nof the seedling to the density of sea-water. About 75 per cent. of those\r\nafloat in the fresh-water of rivers assume the vertical position, the\r\nplumular end protruding between two and five lines (5 to 12 mm.) above\r\nthe surface, while the remainder float horizontally or nearly so. In\r\nsea-water about 50 per cent. float either vertically or steeply\r\ninclined, and the other half float horizontally.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the times of flowering and fruiting, it may be remarked\r\nthat the trees are mostly in flower during the hot months from November\r\nto February, and that the fruiting is in active operation in the latter\r\nhalf of March. The floating seedlings occur in abundance in the\r\nriver-drift at the end of the year, a circumstance which corresponds\r\nwith the fact that a period of six months passes between the\r\nfertilisation of the ovule and the fall of the seedling into the water.\r\n\r\nFertilisation, or, more correctly speaking, the discharge of the pollen,\r\ntakes place after the opening of the flower, and not before, as in the\r\ncase of the species of Rhizophora. The flower-bud is at first erect, but\r\nsubsequently it begins to bend downwards, and ultimately it hangs more\r\nor less vertically. The provision to secure fertilisation under these\r\ncircumstances is rather curious. Without some such contrivance as is\r\nbelow described, the pollen would merely fall out of the flower. Each\r\npetal has its sides rolled or folded inwards so as to completely inclose\r\ntwo stamens. In the bud the folded petals are white and flexible, but as\r\nthe flower expands they redden and become dry and elastic, and are only\r\nprevented from flying open with a spring by the interlocking of the\r\nhairy tips of their lobes. Whilst the folded petals are becoming stiff\r\nand elastic during the opening of the flower, the inclosed stamens are\r\nat the same time preparing themselves for their function. The anthers\r\nare dehiscing and the filaments are acquiring elasticity. All is now\r\nready, and a slight shake or a touch puts the mechanism into action. The\r\npetals unfold themselves with a spring, and the stamens thus suddenly\r\nexposed and released fly forward, and a little shower of pollen is\r\nthrown towards the centre of the flower. This process is accomplished in\r\nordinary fine weather during the first twenty-four or thirty-six hours\r\nafter the expansion of the flower. When the opening occurs in the early\r\nmorning, half of the stamens will be found released in the evening and\r\nthe rest on the following day. During the next day or two the petals and\r\nthe stamens fall out of the flower. In wet weather, the petals never\r\nacquire elasticity, and in consequence do not unfold. In this case\r\npollenisation is never effected, and the folded petals soon fall to the\r\nground, carrying the stamens within them. Cross-fertilisation would be\r\nmuch more likely to occur with species of Bruguiera (if, as is probable,\r\nthe same process of pollenisation is usually followed) than with species\r\nof Rhizophora, since the stamens are securely inclosed in the petals for\r\nsome hours after the expansion of the flower.\r\n\r\nNearly eight weeks pass between the date of fertilisation and the\r\ncommencement of germination. This is somewhat similar to the period\r\ngiven for Rhizophora mangle, namely, nine weeks, and it obviously leaves\r\nlittle or no time for any stage of quiescence or dormant vitality in the\r\ncase of the seed. The changes which the fruit undergoes in this interval\r\nare a considerable increase in girth and a thickening of the calycine\r\nwalls, together with a contraction of the mouth of the tube. However, I\r\nfound no method sufficiently accurate for recording the rate of increase\r\nof the fruit.\r\n\r\nIt is known that germination is in progress when the end of the\r\nhypocotyl begins to lift up the lining membrane at the bottom of the\r\ncalycine tube (see Figs. 21 to 26). The floor of the tube begins to\r\nbulge up, but since this cannot be well seen at first, a better index is\r\nafforded in the elevation of the style which accompanies it. The top of\r\nthe style preserves previous to this time a constant level with regard\r\nto the tips of the calycine teeth. But this does not indicate the actual\r\nbeginning of germination. As shown in Fig. 21, the seed lies about two\r\nand a half lines (6 mm.) below the floor of the calycine tube, and the\r\ntip of the hypocotyl has to penetrate the intervening tissues before it\r\ncan push up the lining membrane and raise the style. Judging from the\r\nsubsequent rate of growth, seven or eight days at least, and perhaps as\r\nmuch as two weeks, are requisite for this purpose. It is not necessary\r\nto give further details here, and it may be at once stated that the\r\naverage of numerous observations on the length of the interval between\r\nfertilisation and the elevation of the style was sixty-four days, the\r\nrange being fifty-nine to sixty-nine. After deducting ten days for the\r\ntime occupied for the radicle in reaching the floor of the calycine tube\r\n(see Figs. 22 and 23), we obtain, as already remarked, nearly eight\r\nweeks as the time elapsing between fertilisation and germination.\r\n\r\nThe radicle or hypocotyl, therefore, in the first stage of germination\r\npierces the tissues above it and reaches the floor of the calycine tube.\r\nIt does not, however, pierce the lining membrane of the tube but pushes\r\nit upward until it ruptures about 4 millimetres below the base of the\r\nstyle which is carried up with it. Thus a kind of cap is formed, as\r\nshown in Fig. 24, which does not fall off from the end of the hypocotyl\r\nuntil it has protruded rather more than an inch. The hypocotyl attains a\r\nlength varying between 5 and 11 inches, the average being about 8\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nThe whole period may be thus divided up:—\r\n\r\n (1) Period between fertilisation and germination                  7-1/2\r\n                                                                  weeks.\r\n\r\n (2) Period between the beginning of germination and the           1-1/2\r\n protrusion of the point of the hypocotyl at the floor of the     weeks.\r\n calycine tube\r\n\r\n (3) Period occupied in the growth of the hypocotyl 8 inches   18 weeks.\r\n outside the fruit and terminating in the fall of the\r\n seedling\r\n\r\n                                                                      ——\r\n\r\n Total                                                         27 weeks.\r\n\r\nThe total period of twenty-seven weeks between fertilisation and the\r\nfall of the seedling is thus six weeks shorter than that estimated for\r\nRhizophora mangle. On comparing the two tables it will be seen that the\r\ndifference mainly lies in the length of the second period, namely, that\r\nbetween the commencement of germination and the protrusion of the\r\nhypocotyl from the fruit. With Rhizophora mangle the fruit grows\r\nconsiderably in length during this period of the germinating process. On\r\nthe other hand with Bruguiera rheedii there is, during this period,\r\npractically no increase in the length of the fruit, and the radicle has\r\nonly to penetrate the tissues, 2-1/2 lines in thickness, between the\r\nseed and the floor of the calycine tube.\r\n\r\nIn the mode of separation of the seedling there are very marked\r\ndifferences between this species of Bruguiera and the species of\r\nRhizophora. With Bruguiera rheedii the four small cotyledons, which are\r\nunited at the base, are, however, left behind at the bottom of the\r\nseed-cavity, when the seedling is detached. But there is no expulsion of\r\nthe seedling, the connection being ultimately severed at the contracted\r\nbase of the cotyledons inside the fruit. When the seedling is full-sized\r\nthe nutritive supply begins to fail, and in consequence the pressure of\r\nthe sides of the fruit on the inclosed plumular end of the seedling\r\nbecomes slacker, the union with the cotyledons becomes weaker, and the\r\nconnection of the fruit with its peduncle at the basal joint becomes\r\nslighter. Usually the fruit falls before the seedling is ready to drop\r\nout, and the connection is severed after a few days’ flotation in the\r\nwater; but sometimes the union between the seedling and fruit is weaker\r\nthan that between the fruit and its peduncle, and in that case the\r\nseedling falls and leaves the fruit containing the cotyledons on the\r\ntree. The whole process of separation is much simpler than with species\r\nof Rhizophora. Here it is mainly a matter of the failure of the\r\nnutritive supply, whilst with Rhizophora it is almost a process of\r\nparturition.\r\n\r\nHaberlandt, in the memoir before quoted, describes quite a different\r\nmode of detachment in the case of Bruguiera eriopetala. Here the\r\nseedling falls normally whilst still attached to the fruit, and the\r\nseparation is subsequently effected by the expansion of the mouth of the\r\ncalyx-tube due to the swelling of the “endosperm-neck” from the entrance\r\nof water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Summary_\r\n\r\n(1) There are four typical mangroves of the Rhizophoraceæ in Fiji,\r\nBruguiera rheedii, Rhizophora mucronata (the Asiatic species),\r\nRhizophora mangle (the American species), and the Selala, a seedless\r\nform intermediate between the two species of Rhizophora just named, but\r\nnearest to the Asiatic species.\r\n\r\n(2) It is shown that the sterility of the Selala is connected with the\r\nimpotent character of the pollen; and since the ovules appear capable of\r\nfertilisation this is held to indicate that cross fertilisation has not\r\nbeen in operation in producing the barren form.\r\n\r\n(3) Good reasons are given for the belief that the Asiatic species of\r\nRhizophora is the parent of the Selala, not as the result of a cross\r\nbetween the Asiatic and American species, but as connected with\r\ndimorphism, the Asiatic species producing two kinds of offspring, one of\r\nthem with impotent pollen.\r\n\r\n(4) In support of this view it is pointed out that there are two forms\r\nof Rhizophora mangle in Ecuador, one of which comes near the Fijian\r\nSelala, though producing seed. There could thus be no question of\r\ncrossing, since but one species occurs there.\r\n\r\n(5) The Selala reproduces itself in a vegetative fashion when growing,\r\nas it often does, in an inclined position. The parent trunk dies and the\r\nprimary branches supported by the aërial roots, remain alive and in\r\ntheir turn give rise to secondary branches similarly supported.\r\n\r\n(6) Although, as a rule, only one of the four ovules of Rhizophora\r\nbecomes a seed, occasionally a fruit contains more than one seed. With\r\nR. mangle in Fiji about one per cent. of the germinating fruits\r\ndisplayed more than one hypocotyl.\r\n\r\n(7) As a result of a protracted series of observations in Fiji, it was\r\nestablished that in the case of a seedling of average length of\r\nRhizophora mangle a period of thirty-three weeks elapsed between the\r\ndate of fertilisation of the ovule and the detachment of the seedling\r\nfrom the tree. In the instance of R. mucronata it was placed at\r\nforty-two weeks. A period of thirty-eight weeks, or nine to ten months,\r\nis regarded as typical for the genus.\r\n\r\n(8) It is established that normally there is no rest-period for the seed\r\nin the case of Rhizophora, the seed at once beginning to germinate on\r\nreaching maturity. In those exceptional instances, however, where there\r\nis more than one seed, it is shown that in some cases the seeds do not\r\nbegin to germinate together, and that a rest-period of at least some\r\nweeks can be at times postulated for one of the seeds.\r\n\r\n(9) An analogy exists between the process of expulsion ending in the\r\ndetachment of the seedling of Rhizophora from the fruit and the process\r\nof parturition.\r\n\r\n(10) Experiments show that Rhizophora seedlings can float unharmed in\r\nsea-water for a period of at least three or four months. Though\r\nnine-tenths or more float in sea-water, as much as a fourth or a half\r\nsink in fresh-water. As a rule they float vertically in fresh-water and\r\nhorizontally in sea-water, the horizontal position safe-guarding the\r\nplumule against the risk of being withered up by the sun in a calm sea.\r\n\r\n(11) It is shown that in the case of Bruguiera rheedii the seedlings\r\nwhen detached from the tree can float unharmed in sea-water for months.\r\nIn their specific weight they display a similar fine adjustment to the\r\ndensity of sea-water, as is above described in the case of Rhizophora.\r\n\r\n(12) With this species of Bruguiera, fertilisation takes place not in\r\nthe unopened flower, as in Rhizophora, but after the flower’s expansion;\r\nand a very singular mechanism is here described which secures the\r\ncompletion of the process.\r\n\r\n(13) A period of twenty-seven weeks elapses between the fecundation of\r\nthe ovule and the detachment of the seedling from the tree in the case\r\nof Bruguiera rheedii; and it is shown that there is normally little or\r\nno room for any rest-period, and that, as with Rhizophora, the seed on\r\nreaching maturity begins to germinate.\r\n\r\n(14) Though the seedlings of Rhizophora and Bruguiera could be\r\ntransported in safety a few hundred miles across the sea, it is held\r\nthat they could never cross the Pacific and reproduce the plant. That\r\nthe American species of Rhizophora has reached the Western Pacific from\r\nthe New World is not accepted. Rather is its present distribution\r\nregarded as representing its original wide range over much of the\r\ntropical zone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n                         A CHAPTER ON VIVIPARY\r\n\r\nThe significance of vivipary.—The scale of germinative capacity.—A lost\r\n  habit with many inland plants.—The views of Goebel.—The shrinking in\r\n  the course of ages of tropical swamp areas.—The variation in the\r\n  structures concerned with vivipary.—Abnormal vivipary.—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was remarked in Chapter IX that the study of the germination of the\r\nfloating seed carried us to the borderland of vivipary; and we may now\r\nobserve that our study of the mangroves, Rhizophora and Bruguiera, in\r\nthe previous chapter, has brought us into contact with vivipary in its\r\nmost complete development in the tropical swamps of our age. There is a\r\ngreat gap between the two extremes, represented by the occasional\r\ngermination of a seed in a capsule or in a berry on the plant, and by\r\nthe elaborate process of vivipary exemplified by Rhizophora; but most of\r\nthe intermediate stages can be illustrated by known examples of\r\nvivipary. There is, however, no pretension to deal with this subject\r\nhere in anything but a cursory fashion; but it will, I venture to think,\r\nadd completeness to a work in which germination on and off the plant has\r\nbeen such a frequent theme if I endeavour to connect together some of\r\nthe various sets of facts known to us concerning germination from the\r\nstandpoint of vivipary.\r\n\r\nThe principal argument here followed has been already outlined in\r\nChapter IX, where I have remarked that it is possible to construct a\r\nscale of the germinative capacities of plants, presenting a continuous\r\nseries beginning with the mangroves, where germination takes place on\r\nthe tree, and ending with those numerous inland plants where seeds are\r\nliberated in an immature condition. It is suggested that vivipary was\r\nthe rule under the uniform climatic conditions of early geological\r\nperiods, and that with the differentiation of climates that has marked\r\nthe emergence of the continents the viviparous habit has been lost over\r\nmuch of the globe, the mangrove-swamps alone illustrating the climatic\r\nconditions once prevailing. The rest-period of the seed is regarded as\r\nan adaptation to climatic differentiation and to seasonal variation; and\r\neven the seed-stage may be broadly regarded as the price paid for\r\nadaptation on the part of the evolutionary or determining power that\r\nlies behind plant-development. When discussing the germination of\r\nCæsalpinia in Chapter XVII, I have shown that the contraction and\r\ninduration of the seed-tests appear merely as an adaptation to climatic\r\ndifferentiation and to seasonal variation, and that it would be quite\r\npossible by exposing the maturing seed to very warm and moist conditions\r\nto induce germination without any rest-period, as actually occurs with\r\nRhizophora. One would then dispense altogether with the final processes\r\nof the contraction and induration of the seed-coats, as illustrated in\r\nthe Leguminosæ; and the rest-stage would appear as an adaptation to\r\nsecular differentiation of climate in the later epochs of the world’s\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe significance of occasional vivipary was long ago pointed out by\r\nGoebel in his _Pflanzenbiologische Schilderungen_ (teil I., 117-134,\r\nMarburg, 1889), when he observed that vivipary, as displayed in the\r\nmangroves, and particularly in the Rhizophoreæ, represented the fullest\r\nexpression of a habit that is only occasionally exhibited by other\r\nplants under exceptionally moist conditions. His view was that the seeds\r\nof plants living in wet places are suited in a varying degree for rapid\r\ngermination, and that vivipary presents itself as the most complete\r\ndevelopment of this capacity. If I regard the views of Goebel and of\r\nKerner aright, vivipary as normally developed in the mangrove is to be\r\ntraced in a descending scale to small beginnings, the principal\r\ndetermining condition lying in the great difference that exists amongst\r\nplants in the readiness of the seed to germinate. In the ascending scale\r\nwe would have first the detachment of the immature seed, where the\r\nembryo is often in a rudimentary state, the ripening of the seed taking\r\nplace in the soil. Then would come those plants where the seeds on being\r\ndetached are quite mature and are ready to germinate as soon as they\r\nfall to the ground. Then would follow the stage represented by those\r\nplants where the seeds merely begin to germinate on the plant, such as\r\noccurs more or less normally with some mangroves like Laguncularia, and\r\nabnormally with a number of plants living in drier stations. After this\r\ncome those mangroves, where, as in Avicennia, germination is completed\r\non the tree or shrub, but the seedling at once liberates itself from the\r\nparent. Last of all there is the stage of the typical mangroves,\r\nRhizophora and Bruguiera, where the seedling remains for months growing\r\non the tree and hangs from the branches.\r\n\r\nVivipary, as above stated, presents itself as a matter of small\r\nbeginnings. My own view, however, is that it is a matter of small\r\n“endings”; and that if we were to commence the scale not with the\r\nimmature seed lying on the soil, but with the seedling suspended from\r\nthe branches of a Rhizophora tree, we should record the various epochs\r\nin the history of vivipary throughout the plant-world. From this\r\nstandpoint the occasional cases of incomplete vivipary displayed outside\r\nthe mangrove-swamp represent a lost habit belonging to a primeval period\r\nwhen the climatic conditions were uniform over most of the earth, an age\r\nalmost of eternal gloom, when the air was ever saturated with aqueous\r\nvapour, and when the sun’s rays were screened off by a dense\r\ncloud-covering that enveloped the globe, an age of which the existing\r\nmangrove swamps alone afford an imperfect indication. Yet even now we\r\ncan say with Schimper that “dense and frequently repeated cloudiness\r\napparently represents the most essential climatic condition for the\r\noccurrence of mangrove in the tropics” (_Plant Geography_, p. 409).\r\n\r\nBut, to return to the subject immediately under consideration, if my\r\nview is correct we ought to find indications of the lost habit in the\r\nanomalous structure of the seeds of some inland plants; and, indeed, it\r\nis shown in Note 50 that this view can be taken of the singular\r\nstructure of the seeds of the Myrtaceous genera, Barringtonia and\r\nCareya, and of the genera of some other orders, and can be extended by\r\nimplication to several other plants possessing similar seed-structures.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the subject generally, it may be remarked that although\r\nnormal vivipary is mainly restricted to the plants of a mangrove swamp,\r\nby no means all mangrove plants are typically viviparous. This habit in\r\nits most complex form is exhibited as a rule by plants with firm,\r\nsomewhat fleshy, usually one-seeded, indehiscent fruits, such as we find\r\nwith Rhizophora and Bruguiera; but plants with follicular fruits, such\r\nas occur with Ægiceras, may also display it in a fashion nearly as\r\ncomplex. Generally speaking, however, plants with hard, dry fruits, such\r\nas are owned by Excæcaria, Heritiera, and Lumnitzera, are\r\nnon-viviparous, though to all appearances quite at home in a\r\nmangrove-swamp. Others again, like Carapa, Laguncularia, and Nipa,\r\nwhilst displaying vivipary in a varying degree, in some cases as a\r\ngeneral rule, in others only occasionally, exhibit no special structures\r\nconnected with it. This point is well brought out by Schimper in his\r\nwork on the Indo-Malayan strand-flora (p. 43), and no further mention\r\nneed be made of it here.\r\n\r\nThe structures connected with vivipary vary greatly in their degree of\r\nspecialisation. At the one end of the scale we have highly complex\r\nstructures, such as are described in the preceding chapter. At the other\r\nend we have those cases of occasional germination on the parent plant\r\nwhere there is seemingly no special structure of any sort. That the\r\ncomplex arrangements concerned with the vivipary of Rhizophora,\r\nBruguiera, Ægiceras, and Avicennia are adaptations is argued by\r\nHaberlandt and Schimper, both of whom devoted much attention to the\r\nstudy of these plants. This is seemingly indicated by the circumstance\r\nthat complex structures concerned with vivipary are found in plants so\r\ndivergent in their characters (the four genera above-named representing\r\nthree orders, Rhizophoreæ, Myrsinaceæ, and Verbenaceæ) that they only\r\npossess their stations in common. It does not, however, follow that all\r\nmangroves that exhibit a complex form of vivipary are of the same\r\nantiquity. I should be inclined to regard those of the Rhizophoreæ as\r\nthe more primitive types, whilst it is possible that plants of other\r\norders, though ancient denizens of a mangrove-swamp, may be more recent\r\nintruders into the mangrove-formation after the differentiation of a\r\ndry-land flora.\r\n\r\nOf particular interest in this connection are the cases of abnormal\r\nvivipary, or of “precocious germination,” that have been recorded from\r\ntime to time respecting a number of plants not denizens of a mangrove\r\nswamp, none of which would appear, according to Schimper’s views, to\r\npresent anything of the nature of an adaptation. Goebel mentions a\r\nnumber of instances, such as that of wheat-grains germinating on the\r\nstalk in a wet summer, and that of Dryobalanops camphora, the Borneo\r\ncamphor-tree, when during a prolonged wet season in Java the seed\r\ngerminates in the fruit on the parent tree. Amongst other examples he\r\ncites the Cacti, Epilobium, Agrostemma, and Juncus, the last case coming\r\nalso under my observation in a wet season in England. One may here\r\nnotice the instance of Dracæna, of which Mr. Hemsley, in April, 1902,\r\nexhibited at a meeting of the Linnean Society of London a specimen\r\nshowing the seeds germinating in the berries on the plant.\r\n\r\nSeveral cases of this kind came under my notice in Fiji. Pulpy fruits\r\nrather favour the precocious germination of seeds. Thus I sometimes\r\nfound the seeds germinating in the Mandarin orange and in the Papaw\r\nfruit (Papaya) shortly after they had been gathered. But more\r\ninteresting examples were displayed in those instances where the seed\r\nwas found germinating on the plant. When the Convolvulaceæ grew in wet\r\nsituations, as on the borders of a mangrove swamp, the seeds were\r\nsometimes observed germinating in the capsule. This came under my notice\r\nwith Ipomœa glaberrima (Boj.) and with I. peltata, more particularly in\r\nwet weather. With some other plants, like Hibiscus diversifolius, that\r\ngrow in wet places, this at times occurs. A species of Croton, employed\r\nas a support for the Vanilla plants in a plantation near Suva, displayed\r\nseeds germinating on the plant. I was informed that the seeds of the\r\ncommon cultivated Luffa (L. cylindrica) growing in a garden on Vanua\r\nLevu sometimes germinated in the fruit still attached to the parent. It\r\nis possible that the seeds of the parasitical genus, Myrmecodia, may\r\noccasionally germinate on the plant, since I found them germinating\r\ninside some of the small berries that had been lying forgotten within a\r\nnewspaper for a fortnight.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most curious case of abnormal vivipary observed by me in\r\nFiji was that concerned with the Coco-nut palm. Though not known to many\r\nresidents in the island, this habit was described to me by Mr. Matthew\r\nSimpson, a planter on Vanua Levu, who told me that he had noticed nuts\r\ngerminating on the tree in unusually dry seasons. Coco-nut palms\r\ndisplaying the nuts germinating on the tree came under my observation\r\nnear Bale-bale, Savu-Savu Bay. In these cases the mature fruit, instead\r\nof falling, remains attached and dries on the stalk. In one case the\r\nseedling was about eighteen inches high. This seems to be what takes\r\nplace normally according to Blume with Nipa fruticans, the swamp palm of\r\nIndo-Malaya. Goebel quotes this author to the effect that the fruits are\r\nnot separated from the head before germination is so far advanced that\r\nsea-water can no longer injure the seedling. The fruits, we are told,\r\nmay remain for years attached in a state of incomplete germination.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Summary_\r\n\r\nThe scale of germinative capacity, that begins with the seedling hanging\r\nfrom the branches of a mangrove like Rhizophora and ends with the\r\ndetached immature seeds of many inland plants that only germinate after\r\nlying for some time in the soil, is regarded as supplying a record of\r\nthe various epochs in the history of vivipary throughout the\r\nplant-world. In the occasional cases of incomplete vivipary occurring\r\namong inland plants and in the singular structure presented by the seeds\r\nof certain genera of the Myrtaceæ and other orders we perceive\r\nindications of a lost viviparous habit belonging to a primeval period\r\nwhen vivipary was the exception and not the rule, an age when the same\r\nclimatic conditions prevailed over much of the globe. At such a period\r\nthe sun’s rays were screened off by a dense cloud-covering that\r\nenveloped the earth, and the atmosphere was ever charged with moisture.\r\nWith the differentiation of climate that has marked the emergence of the\r\ncontinents during the secular drying of the earth, the viviparous habit\r\nhas been alone retained within the confines of the mangrove-swamp, where\r\nthe conditions once almost universal now survive; and as an adaptation\r\nto the differentiation of climate and to the resulting seasonal\r\nvariation the rest-period of the seed has been developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n                    THE WEST COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA\r\n\r\nThe littoral floras of the West Coast of South America.—The Convolvulus\r\n  soldanella zone of Southern Chile.—The plantless or desert zone of\r\n  Northern Chile.—The Sesuvium zone of Peru.—The Mangrove zone of\r\n  Ecuador and Colombia.—The two varieties of Rhizophora mangle, the\r\n  “mangle chico” and the “mangle grande.”—The floating vegetable drift\r\n  of the Guayaquil River.—The Humboldt current and the climate of the\r\n  West Coast of South America.—The advance northward of the arid\r\n  climatic conditions of the Peruvian sea-border.—The retreat of the\r\n  mangroves.—Evidence of ancient coral reefs on the coast of Peru.—The\r\n  shore plants and stranded seed-drift of the Panama Isthmus.—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY acquaintance with the strand-flora of the west coast of South America\r\nbegan at Corral, the port of Valdivia, in Southern Chile in lat. 40° S.,\r\nand terminated at the mouth of the Guayaquil River, in Ecuador, about 2°\r\nsouth of the equator. During the period December 23, 1903, to March 17,\r\n1904, I examined the coast plants at sixteen localities in this region,\r\nwhich covers 38 degrees of latitude and thus measures about 2,300 miles.\r\nTravelling in a steamer to Callao that was trading on the coast I had\r\nopportunities of staying for periods ranging from half a day to a couple\r\nof days at a considerable number of places; and a week spent at\r\nValparaiso gave me a good opportunity of examining the beaches north and\r\nsouth of it. At Lima I spent some weeks, and from that centre examined\r\nthe shore-plants at Callao, Ancon, and Chancay to the northward. North\r\nof this I had not the same opportunities, until we passed the Peruvian\r\nand Ecuadorian boundary; but from a visit to the shore at Paita, from\r\nthe general look of the country in places as we coasted along, and from\r\ninformation derived from other sources, I was able to obtain a fair\r\ngeneral idea of the prevailing character of the beach plants. After my\r\nprevious experience to the southward, one could fairly gauge the\r\ncharacter of the beach-flora from the appearance of the land behind. In\r\nthe Gulf of Guayaquil and in the vicinity of the city of that name I\r\nspent about three weeks in the investigation of the coast flora.\r\n\r\nIf it were not for the interposition of the great rainless deserts of\r\nNorthern Chile and for the scantily vegetated, scantily watered and\r\nsemi-sterile condition of almost the whole coast of Peru, the botanist\r\nwould be presented with a splendid opportunity of studying the\r\ndistribution of shore-plants along a meridian stretching through some\r\nfifty degrees of latitude from Patagonia to Ecuador. As it is, drought\r\nand sterility in one form and another reign over about half of this\r\ngreat stretch of continental coast. This is reflected in the\r\nbeach-flora; and though the observer will often have his interest\r\nattracted by the wonderful climatic anomalies arising from the presence\r\non the coast of the cold Humboldt current, to which the sea-border of\r\nNorth Chile owes its desolation and the coast of Peru its\r\nsemi-sterility, yet for a long time he will feel as if Nature had hardly\r\ndealt fairly with him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE WEST COAST\r\n  OF\r\n  SOUTH AMERICA\r\n\r\n  John Bartholomew & Co., Edin^r.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAlong the sea-border corresponding to the deserts of North Chile there\r\nwould seem to be practically no plants growing on the beaches, except\r\nhere and there where some stray plant from the saline districts inland\r\nintrudes on the coast. Along the whole sea-border of Peru from Arica\r\nnorth to Tumbez on the borders of Ecuador, the coast-districts, though\r\nmore or less rainless, receive the benefit of the drizzly garuas and\r\nsea-fogs, and the sterility of the land immediately backing the beaches\r\nis much less pronounced than with the sea-border corresponding to the\r\ndeserts of Northern Chile. This difference shows itself in a peculiar\r\ntype of littoral vegetation, a strand-flora that is very scanty but one\r\nwhere on the beaches Sesuvium prevails. North of Tumbez the\r\nmangrove-formation predominates along the sea-borders of Ecuador and\r\nColombia to Panama, excepting on a stretch of sterile coast extending\r\nnorth from the Gulf of Guayaquil to the equator.\r\n\r\nThough in one sense the botanical observer will be disappointed with the\r\nlittoral floras of the west coast of South America, in another sense\r\nwhen he remarks the manner in which the coast-vegetation reflects the\r\nabrupt changes in the prevailing climatic conditions he will be\r\nfascinated by the interesting problems presented to him. We are\r\naccustomed to connect a tropical coast with mangroves, coral-reefs, and\r\nbeaches of calcareous sand supporting a luxuriant littoral flora.\r\nClimatic conditions banish all these from the tropical west coast of\r\nSouth America until within four degrees of the equator, and then with\r\nstartling suddenness the dominion of the mangrove begins, the\r\nneighbouring hills commence to be clothed with tropical jungle, and the\r\nclimate is completely changed. Mr. John Ball, who sailed along this\r\ncoast about twenty years ago, referring to this remarkable phenomenon on\r\nthe borders of Peru and Ecuador, remarks that no such abrupt and\r\ncomplete change both in climate and vegetation is known elsewhere in the\r\nworld, and he adds that few parts of the American coast better deserve\r\ncareful examination (_Naturalist in South America_). This subject has\r\nsince been discussed at length by Dr. Wolff in his “Geografia y\r\nGeologica del Ecuador,” and by Baron von Eggers in a paper to be\r\nsubsequently quoted, two very competent observers, but the latter\r\nconsiders that the subject still requires a systematic investigation,\r\nand suggests that an observing station should be established on this\r\ncoast by the combined meteorological societies of Europe. A sojourn of\r\nmore than a week in the swamps at Puerto Bolivar, a few miles from\r\nTumbez, enables me to appreciate the nature of the problem, and to throw\r\na little light on the line of investigation required.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the general subject of the littoral floras of the west\r\ncoast of South America, I may say that beginning with the island of\r\nChiloe in lat. 42° S., this coast may be divided into four zones.\r\n\r\n(1) The Convolvulus soldanella zone of Southern Chile, which extends as\r\nfar north as Coquimbo about 30° S. lat.\r\n\r\n(2) The Plantless or Desert zone stretching north to the vicinity of\r\nArica in lat. 18° 30ʹ, and corresponding to the coast of Northern Chile.\r\n\r\n(3) The Sesuvium zone, extending north from Arica to the 4th parallel of\r\nsouth latitude in the vicinity of Tumbez, a sea-border of semi-sterility\r\nthat comprises the entire coast of Peru.\r\n\r\n(4) The Mangrove zone, stretching from Tumbez, on the frontiers of\r\nEcuador, to the equator and on to Central America, but interrupted at\r\nfirst by a strip of sterility on the coast extending from the Gulf of\r\nGuayaquil to the borders of Colombia, or, strictly speaking, to the\r\nequator.\r\n\r\n\r\n           THE CONVOLVULUS SOLDANELLA ZONE (SOUTHERN CHILE).\r\n\r\nThis zone, which answers to the coast of Southern Chile, from Chiloe as\r\nfar north as Coquimbo, corresponds to watered and vegetated inland\r\nregions, in which, however, the amount of rain and the degree of\r\nfertility decreases from south to north, that is to say, as we approach\r\nthe desert regions. Here we find none of the dry beaches that prevail\r\nfor twenty-five degrees of latitude north of Coquimbo. When we scoop\r\nwith our hands to a depth of three or four inches in the sand we find it\r\nrelatively cool and more or less moist, as in an English beach. In a hot\r\nsummer’s day on a Valparaiso beach we should find that the temperature\r\nof the sand at the surface (half-inch deep) was about 112° F., and at a\r\ndepth of four inches about 80°. This would be above the average for the\r\nzone, which would be probably near the typical summer-temperature of an\r\nEnglish beach, namely, 102° at the surface and 77° four inches down.\r\nThis subject of beach temperature is discussed in Note 70.\r\n\r\nPlants typical of the beaches of this zone, and evidently occurring over\r\nthe length of it, are Convolvulus soldanella, Nolana (paradoxa?);\r\nPolygonum maritimum, Salsola Kali, and Selliera radicans. Nolana is a\r\nChilian and Peruvian genus. This beach plant, which is especially\r\nabundant on the beaches near Coronel and at Bahia San Vincente, has the\r\ncreeping habit of its associate, the Convolvulus. However, it possesses\r\nseeds, or rather seedvessels, of more limited buoyancy; and it is shown\r\nin Note 71 that prolonged drying is needed for effective dispersal by\r\ncurrents over great distances. This beach species of Nolana has narrowly\r\nescaped being a widely-spread littoral plant; whereas it is now\r\nrestricted to the Chilian beach flora. Selliera radicans, a little\r\ncreeping Lobeliaceous plant, growing under the shade of tall clumps of\r\nJuncus at the edge of the beach or in wet places where springs ooze out\r\nin the sand, is a very interesting species that occurs also on the other\r\nside of the Pacific in Australasia. Of the mode of dispersal of its\r\nsmall seeds I know nothing, as the fruits were not ripe at the time of\r\nmy visit; but I would suggest that some resident botanist should\r\ninvestigate this important point. I found it at Corral and at Coquimbo;\r\nand Gay speaks of it as growing on wet coast places from Chiloe to\r\nCoquimbo, a range of 12-1/2° of latitude.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that all the shore-plants of this zone extend south to\r\nChiloe in latitude 42° S.; and it is likely that some of them reach\r\ntowards the Straits of Magellan. I did not find any of them within the\r\nStraits on the beaches in the vicinity of Punta Arenas, where, however,\r\nI noticed the three plants recorded by Ball, namely, Armeria maritima,\r\nvar. andina; Senecio candidans, also found in the Falkland Islands; and\r\nPlantago maritima; besides a Chenopodiaceous plant not in fruit. The\r\nPlantago has no capacity for dispersal by currents, and probably none of\r\nthe other plants are thus dispersed. I formed the opinion when in the\r\nStraits that the beach plants on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of\r\nPatagonia could have but little communication by the currents, and that\r\nthey are in this respect quite cut off from each other. A botanist who\r\ninvestigates the strand-flora of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego in\r\nconnection with the littoral plants of the opposite coasts ought, if he\r\nhas not already done so, to obtain some very interesting results from\r\nthe standpoint of plant-dispersal.\r\n\r\nThe northern limit of the plants of this zone near Coquimbo, in lat. 30°\r\nS., is not determined by the change in climatic conditions that goes\r\nnormally with decrease in latitude, but by the vicinity of the great\r\ndeserts of Northern Chile, the aridity extending to the beaches.\r\n\r\nAmongst the other plants occurring generally in the Convolvulus\r\nsoldanella zone of Southern Chile, species of Salicornia and Samolus are\r\nto be observed in wet places. On the beaches near Valparaiso and in the\r\nvicinity of Talcahuano there thrives a species of Franseria, a Composite\r\nplant possessing prickly fruits well suited for conveyance in bird’s\r\nplumage, but not adapted, as shown in Note 71, for dispersal by\r\ncurrents. Mesembryanthemum is a typical beach-plant at Coquimbo, and an\r\nintruder from the adjoining hill-slopes at Valparaiso. Raphanus,\r\nseemingly R. maritimus, occurs in places, but apparently only as an\r\nintruder from the cultivated districts behind the beaches. One or two\r\nspecies of Euphorbia are not uncommon. A few small trees or bushes of\r\nAcacia farnesiana grow typically on the beach at Coronel and in\r\nneighbouring sandy tracts at Talcahuano, though the plant, as Gay\r\nobserves, has been introduced. Sophora tetraptera, found also in New\r\nZealand, and one of the most interesting plants of the Antarctic flora,\r\nthrives as a small tree on the hill slopes overlooking the harbour of\r\nCorral, becoming bushy where in places it intrudes on the beaches, and\r\nfruiting there as freely as on the slopes above. It was by testing the\r\nbuoyancy of the seeds of this plant that I was led to the discovery of\r\nits mode of dispersal by the currents (I am indebted to Mr. Holland for\r\nthe specific determination of the fruits sent by me to the Kew Museum).\r\nOther shore-plants, of course, occur in this zone; but I have gone far\r\nenough to illustrate the subject. Of the numerous occasional intruders\r\nfrom the neighbouring inland districts, frequently Compositæ, I say\r\nnothing. The results of my observations on the floating power of the\r\nseeds and seed-vessels of some of the shore-plants of this zone are\r\ngiven in Note 71.\r\n\r\nStranded seeds and fruits that belong to the proper beach-drift are not\r\neasily found on the beaches of Southern Chile, as they are often buried\r\nin rubbish. Those most characteristic are seeds of Convolvulus\r\nsoldanella and drupes of Nolana (paradoxa?), both typical beach-plants\r\nof the zone. Portions of Salsola Kali bearing mature fruits, as\r\ndescribed in Note 17, are also frequent. Seeds of Sophora tetraptera\r\nwere found on the beach of Bahia San Vincente, whither they must have\r\nbeen brought by the Humboldt Current from the south, as I did not\r\nobserve the tree in the vicinity. On this beach, as well as at\r\nValparaiso, the prickly fruits of Franseria were abundant in the drift,\r\ndoubtless derived from the plants growing on the same beaches. In\r\naddition we get as frequent components of the beach-drift materials that\r\nmark the white man’s presence over much of the globe. Corks are widely\r\ndistributed over the beaches of the world; but on no coast have I found\r\nthem more numerous than on the Valparaiso beaches. Here we find Medicago\r\nfruits, the empty stones of the cherry, the plum, and the peach, empty\r\nfilberts and other materials, all of which I have gathered on the shores\r\nof the Straits of Messina and on English beaches. Amongst this medley we\r\nfind also Casuarina cones and fruits of Eucalyptus. Then we find special\r\nindications of the New World in the pea-nut (Arachis hypogæa) and in the\r\nabundant seeds of a huge pumpkin (Cucurbita), which is a favourite food\r\nwith the Chilian indigenes. These seeds are cited as an example of\r\nfutile buoyancy in Chapter XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n             THE PLANTLESS OR DESERT ZONE (NORTHERN CHILE).\r\n\r\nThis zone of the coast, which stretches north for some 700 miles from\r\nCoquimbo to near Arica (30°-18°30ʹ S. lat.), corresponds to the great\r\ndesert region of North Chile. On the beaches of Antofagasta, Tocopilla,\r\nand Iquique, which are situated in the midst of this zone, I found no\r\nplants. This rainless sea border of barren mountains, presenting to the\r\neye of the traveller from the deck of a passing steamer nothing but rock\r\nand sand, must be one of the most desolate coasts on our globe. It is\r\ntherefore not a matter for surprise that the beaches are of dry loose\r\nsand in which the hand fails to find on scooping below the surface that\r\nrefreshing coolness which is the character of beaches in all latitudes\r\nwhere the land is vegetated and a subsoil drainage seaward exists. Under\r\nordinary conditions the sensation of moisture in the sand a few inches\r\ndown is not produced by the mere proximity of the sea. On the\r\nAntofagasta and Iquique beaches the temperature in the heat of the day\r\nof the surface half inch ranged from 120° to 130° F., whilst four inches\r\ndown it was 95° to 100°, and no moisture was found by scooping five or\r\nsix inches down. On the Taltal beach, which lies towards the southern\r\nend of the desert region, I noticed, besides a few plants of Suæda\r\nfruticosa, two other species of the orders Santalaceæ and Nolanaceæ,\r\nevidently intruders from the inland regions. Where the zone of extreme\r\naridity terminates at the north between Pisagua and Arica a few bushes\r\nare to be seen on the hill-slopes behind the beaches.\r\n\r\nVery little seed-drift came under my notice on the beaches of the desert\r\nzone. Here and there I found a few Medicago pods and some seeds of the\r\nlarge pumpkin above noticed, but that was all. This is due as a rule to\r\nthe seed-drift being masked by an enormous amount of rubbish, mostly\r\nbrought from the south by the Humboldt Current. My walk for five miles\r\nalong the beaches immediately north of Antofagasta gave me an experience\r\nin the way of stranded drift such as I have never met with on the\r\nbeaches of any other region. All the dead bodies of the Chilian coast to\r\nthe southward seem to have been stranded in the bend of Moreno Bay, on\r\nthe shore of which Antofagasta lies; and the air was tainted with\r\ndecaying flesh, the past being mixed up with the present in a most\r\nunrefreshing fashion. Besides carcases of sea-lions, six feet in length,\r\nsharks, dog-fish, and fish of many sorts, some of them dried up, others\r\nin a state of putrefaction, there were dead penguins, dead pelicans,\r\ndead sea-birds of other kinds, the bodies of horses, cattle, dogs, &c.,\r\nall preyed upon by the numerous vultures and skuas, and in some\r\nlocalities by hungry-looking dogs of large size that took no notice of\r\nme as they slunk along. The past was represented by great quantities of\r\nbones that lay bleaching on the sand, with here and there a vertebra of\r\na whale, making in all quite a varied osteological collection. But this\r\nwas not all. Carcases of all sorts were drifting towards the beach. Here\r\na vulture, there a skua, there again a dog stood just beyond the\r\ntide-wash looking keenly seaward; and by following the direction of\r\ntheir gaze one could see that each had marked down a carcase slowly\r\ndrifting in. Now and then they would make a dash, scarcely waiting for\r\nthe new arrival to be washed up by the waves. But there was no\r\ncompetition, since there was enough for all.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions my investigation into the seed-drift was out of\r\nthe question; but I saw what would be considered by some as more\r\ninteresting, namely, the dead of many latitudes piled up on the beach by\r\nthe Humboldt Current.\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE SESUVIUM ZONE (THE PERUVIAN COAST).\r\n\r\nThis zone, which comprises the whole Peruvian sea-border from Arica in\r\n18°30ʹ S. to the vicinity of Tumbez in about 3°30ʹ S., usually possesses\r\nin its scanty littoral flora one or two species of Sesuvium, and in some\r\nplaces Sesuvium alone occurs on the beach. The beaches here do not line\r\na region of almost complete aridity, as in the coast corresponding to\r\nthe great desert region of North Chile. Though here also scarcely any\r\nrain falls, the sea-border receives the benefit of the “garuas” or\r\ndrizzling sea-fogs; whilst the region immediately behind the coast may\r\neither be desert or semi-sterile during much of the year, or may be\r\nscantily vegetated, or, as along the river-valleys, may display a\r\nvegetation more fitting to the latitude. The general aspect, however, of\r\nthe coast of Peru is one of aridity; but there are probably few beaches\r\nwhere a certain amount of subsoil drainage from the land sea-ward does\r\nnot exist. This is well exhibited at Ancon, north of Callao, where in\r\nthe most unlikely situations water is reached by digging wells; but in\r\nspite of this the Sesuvium alone grows on the beach. The beaches\r\nexamined by me in the heat of the day in February, as at Mollendo and\r\nAncon, had much the same surface-temperature noticed in the preceding\r\nmonth on the beaches of North Chile, namely, 120° to 130° F., and in one\r\nplace 135°; whilst at a depth of four inches the sand was rather cooler,\r\nand instead of being between 95° and 100°, as on the Antofagasta and\r\nIquique beaches, it was here usually only about 90°. But it was only\r\noccasionally that the sand felt at all moist at a depth of five or six\r\ninches; and in this zone, therefore, only a few shore plants of a\r\npeculiar type could be expected to find a station on the beaches,\r\nexcepting, of course, those localities where low marshy districts or\r\nlagoons lie behind the beach.\r\n\r\nThe beach plants of the coast of Peru as observed by me though usually\r\nscanty, presented two types according to the character of the district\r\nbordering the beach. I make no mention here of those local plants, often\r\nbelonging to the Compositæ, that as at Callao and Arica descend the\r\nvalleys to the beaches, or to those numerous introduced plants that\r\naccompany cultivation, such as we find at Arica. In those coast\r\nlocalities, as at Arica, Callao, and Chancay, where salt-water pools or\r\nbrackish lagoons lie behind the beach, or where a stream or a river\r\nempties into the sea, Sesuvium portulacastrum, Heliotropium\r\ncurassavicum, and a Salicornia are to be generally noticed, and, as at\r\nCallao, Batis maritima may also abound. On the Chancay coast, about 30\r\nmiles north of Callao, there lies inside the shingle-beach a large\r\nshallow lagoon of brackish water (spec. gr. 1·012) with extensive muddy\r\nmarginal flats, the temperature of the water at the edge being at\r\nmid-day on Feb. 3rd, 90° F. In the water flourished Ruppia maritima,\r\nwhich was also exposed in dead, dry, matted masses on the bordering\r\nmud-flats. On these mud-flats grew Sesuvium portulacastrum, which near\r\nthe water’s edge was associated with a small species of Salicornia,\r\nwhilst further away from the water it was accompanied by Heliotropium\r\ncurassavicum.\r\n\r\nBut the most typical beach-flora of the Peruvian coast is such as we\r\nfind on the dry beaches skirting the base of sand-covered or barren\r\nhill-slopes such as occur at Mollendo, Ancon, and Paita. As at Ancon,\r\nsand-covered hills and plains may extend miles inland, displaying here\r\nand there lines of shifting sand-mounds or “medanos.” On such beaches we\r\nmay often find only a solitary plant, a species of Sesuvium which seems\r\nto differ only in its larger flowers, its much larger leaves (2 inches\r\nlong), and its stout stems, of the thickness of the little finger, from\r\nthe ordinary Sesuvium portulacastrum. This seems to be the only plant\r\nthat can make its home on such beaches. At Mollendo, where there are\r\nsigns of desiccated pools behind the beach which are occasionally filled\r\nwith sea-water, the vegetation was of an intermediate character and more\r\nabundant; and here grew Sesuvium portulacastrum, a tall Salicornia, and\r\nSuæda fruticosa; whilst the commonest plant was a prostrate Nolanaceous\r\nspecies with a handsome purplish flower.\r\n\r\nExcepting with the fruits of Batis maritima, and perhaps the buoyant\r\njoints of Salicornia, scarcely any of the prevailing shore-plants of the\r\ncoast of Peru possess a capacity for dispersal by currents. In this zone\r\nI rarely found any seed-drift on the beaches. Much rubbish, such as\r\nroots of bamboos, however, may be brought down by the rivers; and where\r\nthe Humboldt Current strikes a bend in the coast we get a repetition, on\r\na smaller scale, of the scenes on the Antofagasta beaches. Ancon Bay,\r\nfor instance, receives much of the floating offal of the south.\r\n\r\n\r\n         THE MANGROVE ZONE (THE COASTS OF ECUADOR AND COLOMBIA)\r\n\r\nWe come now to the mangrove zone which comprises, with the remarkable\r\nexception of a long stretch of arid sea-border to the north of the Gulf\r\nof Guayaquil, the whole remaining western sea-border of South America,\r\nnamely, the Ecuadorian and Colombian coasts. My own acquaintance with\r\nthis region is limited to the estuary of the Guayas or the Guayaquil\r\nRiver and to the southern shore of the Gulf of Guayaquil; but I am able\r\nto avail myself of the researches of Baron von Eggers, which cover the\r\nentire Ecuadorian coast; and with Ecuador, therefore, I will bring this\r\nbrief sketch of the littoral flora of one side of a large continent to a\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nThe Ecuadorian coast, lying, as Baron von Eggers observes, between the\r\nrainless and desert coasts of Peru and the “ewig grüne” coasts of\r\nColombia, may be regarded as a transition-area presenting very varied\r\nand complicated conditions. With the cause of the remarkable contrasts\r\nexhibited by the strand-flora, not only on the coast of Ecuador, but\r\nalong the whole west coast of South America through some forty-five\r\ndegrees of latitude from Patagonia to Colombia, I will presently deal.\r\nHere it may be remarked in passing that the Humboldt Current has played\r\nthe determining part in producing the abnormal climatic conditions to\r\nwhich these remarkable contrasts in the strand-flora of this coast of\r\nthe continent are mainly due.\r\n\r\nThe mangrove zone, marking a more or less abrupt transition from a\r\nregion of drought and semi-sterility to one of humidity and rank\r\ntropical vegetation, begins about lat. 3° 30ʹ S., that is, in the\r\nvicinity of Tumbez, or perhaps nearer the boundary-line between Ecuador\r\nand Peru in lat. 3° 20ʹ (see Note 72). Occupying the southern shore of\r\nthe Gulf of Guayaquil it extends up the Guayas estuary to Guayaquil and\r\nrather beyond. But when we follow the coast of Ecuador northward from\r\nthe island of Puna towards Santa Elena Point, we come upon one of the\r\nmost remarkable phenomena presented on the west coast of South America.\r\nThe dry region begins again and the mangroves disappear; and these\r\nconditions continue through about 2-1/2 degrees of latitude until we\r\nreach the equator, when the mangrove zone soon recommences, and, as I\r\ninfer, continues northward without a break to the coast of Central\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nDealing first with the mangrove districts of the south side of the Gulf\r\nof Guayaquil and of the Guayas or Guayaquil estuary, we may observe that\r\nprobably in few localities of the globe have the forces of nature worked\r\nmore in unison to produce the conditions favouring the growth of the\r\nmangrove. The reason why this particular locality has been thus favoured\r\nwill be discussed later on in this chapter. I may here observe that\r\nBaron von Eggers was so struck with the exceptional features of the\r\nmangrove-growth in this region that he was inclined to look for the\r\nAmerican centre of the genus Rhizophora, the prevailing mangrove, in the\r\nestuary of the Guayas River.\r\n\r\nI will not enter into a detailed description of the mangrove-formation\r\nof this coast, which has indeed been given by the German botanist; but I\r\nwill merely refer to the leading features such as they presented\r\nthemselves to me. In the first place, reference will be made to the\r\nsea-border of the province of Eloro, where I spent nine or ten days,\r\nmaking Puerto Bolivar, the port of Machala, my headquarters—a locality\r\nabout thirty miles east of Tumbez. Except in the Guayas estuary I have\r\nnever seen such a magnificent growth of mangrove.\r\n\r\nBy following the line of light railway that runs about six kilometres\r\ninland from Puerto Bolivar to Machala, the capital of the province, we\r\nobtain a good section of the mangrove-belt, which may be thus described.\r\nThe mangrove-swamp proper extends about three kilometres inland. Whilst\r\nthe small variety of Rhizophora mangle (mangle chico) immediately fronts\r\nthe sea, Laguncularia grows on the islets close to the seaward margin of\r\nthe swamp. When we enter one of the numerous broad creeks that intersect\r\nthe border of the mangrove-belt we soon find ourselves in the true\r\nmangrove forest, where prevail tall trees of Rhizophora mangle (mangle\r\ngrande) that rise to a height of 70 or 80 feet or more. Gloomy as the\r\ndepths of the swamp are, they acquire quite a funereal aspect, the\r\nbranches of the trees being draped with pendent Tillandsias. These long,\r\nhair-like, tangled growths hang vertically from the branches of the\r\ntrees and may be 20 or 30 feet in length. In the rear of the zone of\r\ntall mangroves we come upon a more open district of the swamp. The\r\nforest proper gives place to a tract occupied by small trees of\r\nRhizophora, Laguncularia, and Avicennia, with here and there whole acres\r\noccupied only by the shrubby Salicornia peruviana which attains the\r\nheight of a man.\r\n\r\n                                                    [_To face page 484._\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Emery Walker sc.\r\n  Rough Plan of the Gulf of Guayaquil.\r\n]\r\n\r\n(The main stream of the Humboldt current, as indicated by the arrows,\r\n  turns off to the north-west at Cape Blanco; whilst a small branch\r\n  crosses the mouth of the Gulf of Guayaquil and flows along the Ecuador\r\n  coast north of Santa Elena Point.)\r\n\r\nHere terminates the mangrove-swamp proper, and about three kilometres\r\nfrom the sea it passes gradually into a region of extensive bare\r\nmud-flats which are penetrated by salt-water creeks, two or three yards\r\nacross and a foot or two in depth, that are bordered by low and shrubby\r\nAvicennias, the Salicornia bushes above noted, and dwarfed trees of\r\nRhizophora mangle only four or five feet high. These flats, which are\r\nevidently only overflowed by the sea at the higher spring tides, were at\r\nthe time of my visits much sun-cracked and in some parts incrusted with\r\nsalt; but the mud was rather soft, and in places Sesuvium portulacastrum\r\nand Batis maritima flourished in quantity on it. These mud-flats, about\r\ntwo kilometres across, pass by degrees into the low-lying level district\r\nknown as the Machala plains, on which the capital of the province is\r\nbuilt. Here the soil is dryish, and, notwithstanding that it displays on\r\nits surface when exposed to the sun a white saline efflorescence, a dry\r\njungle type of vegetation of the xerophilous character here thrives. I\r\nnoticed casually the Algaroba (Prosopis), a yellow-flowered Cordia,\r\ncacti of the Opuntia and Cereus kinds, besides several small trees and\r\nshrubs often thorny.\r\n\r\nThese Machala plains, on account of the fine saline incrustation above\r\nmentioned, are of much interest, since at a distance of six kilometres\r\nfrom the coast they thus display on their surface the effect of\r\nsea-water infiltration, their level above the sea being only a few feet.\r\nWe have seen the three stages of this infiltration landward of\r\nsea-water: first, the mangrove-swamps daily overflowed by the tide;\r\nsecond, the mud-flats behind them which are only overflowed by the\r\nfortnightly spring-tides; third, the vegetated plains behind all, which\r\nare sufficiently raised to be above the reach of the tides, but which\r\nare nevertheless soaked with sea-water that displays its presence in the\r\nsalt left by evaporation on the surface of the soil.\r\n\r\nBut another interesting point is here raised. At the back of the\r\nmangrove-belt, in most parts of the world, we usually find a\r\nparticularly rank and luxuriant vegetation where the Scitamineæ often\r\ntake a leading part; whereas on the sea-border of this part of Ecuador\r\nthe mangrove-swamps pass gradually into arid saliniferous plains. With\r\nthis singular fact is to be associated the circumstance that we see here\r\nin operation, some four or five miles from the coast, a process by which\r\ngreat quantities of sea-salts are accumulating below the surface. This\r\nmay possibly be concerned with the origin of the great saline deposits\r\nof Northern Chile. However this may be, there is some reason for\r\nbelieving—and I understand that this is the opinion of Dr. Wolff, the\r\nhistorio-geographer of Ecuador—that in the course of ages the tendency\r\nwill be towards an extension of the dry, sterile regions of Northern\r\nPeru into Ecuador. This subject is referred to again in a later page of\r\nthis chapter.\r\n\r\nWhilst in this neighbourhood I made the ascent for some fifteen miles of\r\nthe Santa Rosa River, which opens into the sea near Puerto Bolivar. It\r\nis a tidal estuary that has no proportion in size to the small river\r\nthat enters it. In its lower third we passed at first between long\r\nmangrove-islands formed almost entirely, as viewed from the boat, of the\r\ntall Rhizophora trees draped with Tillandsias, and presenting really a\r\nmagnificent spectacle. In the middle third we were penetrating into the\r\nrear of the mangrove-belt. The giant swamp-fern (Chrysodium aureum)\r\nabounded, and here and there we passed by a patch entirely held by the\r\nlarge shrubs of Salicornia peruviana. The tall Rhizophora trees were\r\nreplaced by the short variety, the “mangle chico,” which ceased\r\naltogether about ten miles from the mouth of the estuary, but probably\r\nonly about five miles from the nearest part of the coast. The water at\r\nthe place where the Rhizophora trees ceased was evidently quite fresh\r\nduring nine out of the twelve hours, being only salt in the latter part\r\nof the rising tide. Above the mangroves, in the upper third of the\r\nascent, Hibiscus tiliaceus, with Chrysodium aureum, flourished on the\r\nbanks. The shallows at the margins were occupied by a considerable\r\nvariety of semi-aquatic and other plants, such as Pontederia (two\r\nspecies); one of the Alismaceæ, with the flower and fruit of Sagittaria\r\nand the leaves of Alisma; Typha, Polygonum, and an Amaryllid like\r\nCrinum. Plants of Pistia and Pontederia floated in the stream.\r\n\r\nI have said enough to give a general idea of the composition of the\r\nmangrove-belt of the Ecuador littoral, and will refer but briefly to the\r\nmangroves and other river-side plants in the neighbourhood of the city\r\nof Guayaquil, some forty miles up the Guayas estuary. As I have remarked\r\nin Note 38, the water of the river off the city is usually quite fresh\r\nexcept at high water; but the sea has much freer access to the channels\r\nat the back of Guayaquil, where at high water the density was 1·014. In\r\nthese channels are displayed the typical mangrove formation, trees of\r\nRhizophora mangle bordering the water, whilst behind they are mingled\r\nwith Avicennia tomentosa and Laguncularia. On the banks of the main\r\nriver, where they are overflowed at high water, Anona paludosa was the\r\nmost frequent tree, being associated with the Rhizophora, Hibiscus\r\ntiliaceus, and other trees. Above the city, Polygonum glabrum was\r\ngrowing in dense masses at the river’s edge, whilst Pontederia and\r\nPistia flourished on the low muddy banks and floated in quantities in\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the subject of the mangrove-formation of Ecuador, I will\r\nrefer shortly to the two varieties of Rhizophora mangle that here occur.\r\nBaron von Eggers received the impression that the common type of this\r\nspecies, a low tree bordering the coast, did not exist in Ecuador, such\r\na type as he says is characteristic of the West Indies and of Central\r\nAmerica, and, I may add, also of Fiji. The species he regards as\r\nacquiring a new facies in Ecuador, where it exists as tall forest-trees,\r\nbranchless for half their height, and exhibiting other divergent\r\ncharacters. However, I found that the common type of the species occurs\r\nnormally on the coast in the vicinity of Puerto Bolivar, thirty miles\r\neast of Tumbez, a district above described.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct forms of Rhizophora mangle exhibited in the\r\nmangrove-belt of the coasts around Puerto Bolivar. One of them, which\r\nthe indigenes name “mangle chico,” is a small tree, 10 to 15 feet high,\r\nwith useless timber, that immediately borders the sea, and, in fact,\r\nlargely forms the margin of the swamp, not only on its seaward side, but\r\nalso on the land side, where it passes into drier ground. The other, the\r\n“mangle grande,” a tall tree reaching to 60 or 80 and sometimes perhaps\r\nto 100 feet in height, composes the interior, and indeed the bulk, of\r\nthe mangrove-belt, and possesses a hard and durable timber much employed\r\nin the district.\r\n\r\nDistinct as these two types are, it is not difficult to find\r\nintermediate forms, and, in truth, in some localities they prevail. But\r\nthe interesting point is that this peculiar Ecuadorian type of the\r\nspecies, a type that attracted the attention of the eminent German\r\nbotanist, comes near the “Selala,” the mysterious seedless Rhizophora of\r\nthe Fijian swamps—a subject fully discussed in Chapter XXX., where I\r\nhave compared the Fijian and Ecuadorian Rhizophoras. Both the “Selala”\r\nof Fiji and the “mangle grande” of Ecuador are intermediate between the\r\nAmerican Rhizophora mangle and the Asiatic R. mucronata, resembling the\r\nlast in their inflorescence, but in other points approaching the\r\nAmerican species. The “Selala,” however, comes nearer to the Asiatic\r\ntree, whilst the “mangle grande” comes nearer to the American tree.\r\nUnlike the Fijian tree, that of Ecuador is not sterile, but matures its\r\nfruit; and it displays no evidence of the vegetative reproduction so\r\ncharacteristic of the “Selala.”\r\n\r\nSandy beaches are not common on the mangrove-fronted shores of the south\r\nside of the Gulf of Guayaquil. However, on the seaward side of the long\r\nlow mangrove island of Jambeli, on which the lighthouse is placed off\r\nPuerto Bolivar, there is a long stretch of beach of whitish, mainly\r\nnon-calcareous, sand. The Coco palms behind the beach give the coast\r\nquite the aspect of a Pacific island strand. Ipomœa pes capræ flourishes\r\non the sand nearest to the sea; and immediately behind, the beach is\r\nmore or less occupied by a Cyperus 2 to 3 feet high, and by Canavalia\r\nobtusifolia. Further back grows a small Acacia tree, and behind it the\r\nyellow-flowered Cordia tree of the district; and in the rear of all lie\r\nextensive mud-flats, partly occupied by stunted bushes of Avicennia\r\ntomentosa and by Sesuvium portulacastrum, which in their turn pass into\r\nthe mangrove-swamps.\r\n\r\nOn account of the enormous amount of drift of all descriptions that is\r\ncarried to the sea by the Guayas or Guayaquil River, floating vegetable\r\nmaterials are abundant in the Gulf of Guayaquil, and are thrown up in\r\nquantity on the coasts of Ecuador. One of the most interesting\r\nspectacles at Guayaquil is presented by the floating river-drift. Huge\r\ntree-trunks and floating islets, the last-named ranging from 3 or 4 to\r\n30 or 40 feet or more across, were, at the time of my visit in February,\r\nbeing carried to and fro unceasingly in front of the city by the tide,\r\ngradually making their way down the river, and ultimately reaching the\r\nopen waters of the gulf. Floating plants of Pistia were in abundance;\r\nand their fate when they reached the sea must have been tragical. The\r\nislets were exceedingly interesting; they were evidently formed of\r\nmaterials lifted up bodily from the shallows at the margin of the river,\r\nand then carried off in the stream. They were mainly composed of two\r\nspecies of Pontederia and of Polygonum glabrum in the position of\r\ngrowth; the first often in flower. Pistia and a variety of smaller\r\nplants nestled among them, such as Salvinia, portions of Azolla, Lemna,\r\n&c.; and in one islet I noticed, oddly enough, the growing rhizome of a\r\nsensitive plant (Mimosa pudica). A great quantity of floating seeds\r\ncollect amongst the roots and stems of the plants composing the islets,\r\nand here I obtained much of the smaller seed-drift.\r\n\r\nMost frequent in the floating drift of the river at Guayaquil were the\r\nseeds of Anona paludosa, often in a germinating condition. The seeds are\r\nliberated by the decay of the floating fruit, which was also common in\r\nthe drift. Amongst the larger materials were the seeds of Entada\r\nscandens and of Mucuna; the empty seeds of the vegetable-ivory palm\r\n(Phytelephas macrocarpa), the sound seed possessing no floating power;\r\nthe “stones” of Spondias lutea, L., as identified by Mr. Holland, of the\r\nKew Museum; the empty small nuts of several palms, including,\r\napparently, Oreodoxa, &c. Amongst miscellaneous materials were small\r\ngourds, which are referred to in Note 47, and an occasional empty cacao\r\nfruit. Smaller seeds were also abundant, and included those of Hibiscus\r\ntiliaceus, Erythrina, Vigna, Ipomœa, and others. Carried into the river\r\nfrom the neighbouring mangrove-creeks, where they abound, there were\r\nfloating seedlings of Rhizophora and Avicennia, fruits of Laguncularia\r\noften germinating, and the seeded joints of Salicornia peruviana.\r\n\r\nThere was of course, in addition, much that was strange in the floating\r\ndrift of the Guayas River, which received its contributions not only\r\nfrom the river-side vegetation and the neighbouring mangrove-swamps, but\r\nalso from the interior mountain ranges culminating in Chimborazo, the\r\nslopes of which are drained by its tributaries. I had several\r\nopportunities of meeting the drift of the Guayas River in the open\r\nwaters of the Gulf of Guayaquil. Much of it is carried along the south\r\nside of the gulf; and I picked up at sea, ten to twenty miles from the\r\nmouth of the estuary, many of the things above enumerated, such as\r\nErythrina and Mucuna seeds, seeds of Hibiscus tiliaceus, the empty\r\nvegetable-ivory seeds, the seedlings of Rhizophora and Avicennia, and\r\nthe germinating fruits of Laguncularia and Salicornia peruviana. Much of\r\nthese materials mingled with local drift is stranded on the long beach\r\nof Jambeli Island, thirty miles from the mouth of the estuary. Here,\r\nbesides the seeds of Canavalia obtusifolia and Ipomœa pes capræ derived\r\nfrom the locality, I found the seedlings of Rhizophora and Avicennia,\r\nand the fruits of Laguncularia and Salicornia peruviana, that might have\r\nbeen in part derived from the adjacent swamps, as well as much of the\r\ndrift of the Guayas River, such as the seeds of Anona paludosa, Entada\r\nscandens, Erythrina, and Mucuna, the small gourds, the same small\r\npalm-nuts, the empty seeds of Phytelephas, the “stones” of Spondias\r\nlutea, and much other material previously familiar to me, but nowhere a\r\nsign of the floating Pistias and of the flowering Pontederia islets of\r\nthat estuary.\r\n\r\n_The Stretch of Dry Coast from the Vicinity of Puna Island to the\r\nEquator._— This remarkable piece of sea-border, covering nearly three\r\ndegrees of latitude, and in its aridity and general character recalling\r\nthe sterile sea-coast of Peru, is placed between the humid\r\nmangrove-fronted coast of the Guayas estuary and the similarly humid and\r\nmangrove-fronted coasts of Northern Ecuador and Colombia. The mangrove\r\nseems to be almost absent from this stretch of dry coast. Mr. F. P.\r\nWalker, of the Santa Elena Cable Station, tells me that some time ago a\r\nlittle mangrove-growth existed near the Point, but that it has\r\ndisappeared; and Baron von Eggers implies the absence of mangroves from\r\nthe whole coast. The first-named speaks of the dry character of the\r\ncoast district from Santa Elena Point to within half a degree of the\r\nequator; and the last-named, in his description of the coast, mentions\r\ncacti and thorny plants as typical of the vegetation. Since this region\r\nrepresents a typical locality where the direct influence of the Humboldt\r\ncurrent on the climate of almost the whole west coast of South America\r\ncan be put to the proof, I will refer to its peculiar climatic\r\nconditions below in my discussion of the general question, and will here\r\ncontent myself with saying that on this dry portion of the coast of\r\nEcuador we have reproduced, but in a less pronounced degree, the\r\nclimatic conditions of the coast of Peru.\r\n\r\n_The Humboldt or Peruvian Current and the Climate of the West Coast of\r\nSouth America._—The question we will now briefly consider is one that is\r\nconcerned with the determining causes of the singular distribution of\r\ncoast-plants on the west coast of South America. The reader will have\r\nalready seen that the matter is an affair of climate; but it is an\r\naffair of climate in which (although it affects forty or more degrees of\r\nlatitude), latitude, in a general sense, scarcely counts. All the\r\nnaturalists, from Humboldt onward, who have sojourned in this region of\r\nthe globe have displayed a deep interest in this subject; and I suppose\r\nthere can be no region of the globe where there are so many climatic\r\nanomalies as interesting to the meteorologist. Here, for instance, might\r\nbe obtained materials for solving the irritating mystery of a London\r\nfog; and if the suggestion of Baron von Eggers, before alluded to, is\r\ncarried out, and a station is established by the Meteorological\r\nSocieties of Europe and America at some suitable locality like Santa\r\nElena on the coast of Ecuador, we might obtain, among other results,\r\nanother line of investigating the causes of the fogs of our metropolis,\r\na subject about which Captain Carpenter has recently made an important\r\npreliminary inquiry.\r\n\r\nI will assume that my readers are already acquainted with the nature of\r\nthe problem to be discussed relating to the climate of the west coast of\r\nSouth America, and that they are familiar with the view generally held\r\nthat the aridity of this extensive coast region, stretching from the\r\nthirtieth parallel of south latitude to the equator, arises from the\r\nloss by the trade-winds of all their moisture in the interior of the\r\ncontinent before reaching the western countries of Chile and Peru. Mr.\r\nBall, in his book on South America, opposed this view, though from\r\nreasons only partially valid, since he instanced the Ecuador coast as\r\nbeing, contrary to the theory, a wet coast, whereas we know that a large\r\nstretch of it is arid and not unlike Peru. The parting of the ways in\r\nthis discussion lies in the answer to the query, Why should the\r\nsouth-east trade carry so much moisture to the east side of South\r\nAmerica, whilst the south-west winds, that are equally prevalent on the\r\nwest coast of the continent, are drying winds which convert the\r\nsea-border into a desert, as in Northern Chile, or into a region of\r\nsemi-sterility, as in the instance of Peru? Other things being equal, we\r\nshould expect both sea-borders of the continent in these latitudes to be\r\nwell watered. In the answer to the question why the south-east trade\r\nshould be a wet wind and the south-west wind a dry one lies a fatal\r\nobjection to the prevailing view.\r\n\r\nWhen Professor Davis, in his article on North America in the\r\n_Encyclopædia Britannica_ (vol. 25), observes in connection with the\r\narid coast regions on the west side of the continent that the southerly\r\nflow of the winds along the Pacific coast gives them a drying quality,\r\nthus causing the extension to the coast in South California and in North\r\nMexico of the arid regions of the interior, he seems to imply that these\r\nwinds acquire their drying capacity in flowing from cooler to warmer\r\nlatitudes. On this view all trade-winds should be drying winds, whereas\r\nthe reverse would appear to be the case.\r\n\r\nThere is some condition, present on one coast of the South American\r\ncontinent and absent on the other, which determines why a southerly\r\nwind, blowing landward, is in the one case moist and in the other dry.\r\nAccording to my own view the winds of the arid coast regions of western\r\nNorth America cross the cool waters of the Californian current, and thus\r\nacquire their drying quality on striking a sea-border more highly heated\r\nthan the winds themselves. On the tropical west coast of South America\r\nthe winds also become drying winds by passing over the cold waters of\r\nthe Peruvian or Humboldt current, where mists are in consequence of\r\nfrequent occurrence; and on striking the more highly heated land-surface\r\nat the sea-border the moving air does not part with any more moisture\r\nuntil an altitude of some thousands of feet above the sea is reached,\r\nwhen the cloud-belt forms. On the mountains bordering the coast of the\r\nAntofagasta province, in January, the clouds gathered at an elevation of\r\n4,000 to 5,000 feet. Perhaps the best way to contrast the east and west\r\ncoasts of tropical South America in this respect would be to say that\r\nwhilst the wind blows landward in both regions, the land is the\r\ncondenser on the east side, and the sea, owing to the interposition of\r\nthe cold Humboldt current, is the condenser on the west side.\r\n\r\nDuring a fortnight spent in February at Ancon, about twenty miles north\r\nof Callao, I noticed that with the prevailing cool south-westerly wind\r\nthe coast was clear, but it was misty at sea. On the few days when there\r\nwere warm westerly and north-westerly breezes, the weather was thick at\r\nsea; and if this condition was pronounced, the whole coast was enveloped\r\nin mist; but more usually the coast-line was fairly clear except at the\r\npromontories, along the sides of which clouds blown in from the sea\r\nrolled in lines inland, not generally attaining an elevation over 300 or\r\n400 feet, but sometimes reaching 900 or 1,000 feet, and gradually\r\ndisappearing a mile or two inside the coast-line. These sea-born clouds\r\nthus vanished as they traversed the more highly heated land-surface; and\r\nthe air-current continuing its inland course mounted the slopes of the\r\nadjacent mountain ranges of the Andes, some three or four miles from the\r\ncoast, until at an altitude of some 5,000 or 6,000 feet condensation\r\nagain occurred and the cloud-belt was formed at those cooler levels.\r\n\r\nFrom the summit of a range rising to a height of about 2,500 feet to the\r\nnorth-west of Lima I had presented to me a splendid spectacle, on\r\nFebruary 12th, in the formation of the coast-belt of clouds. The\r\nforenoon was clear, but about 2 p.m. the sea-born clouds began to roll\r\ninland, concealing the lower two-thirds of the island of San Lorenzo,\r\nwhich has an elevation of almost 1,400 feet, and completely covering up\r\nCallao and the low country bordering the sea, but extending only a mile\r\nor two from the coast-line. The dense cloud that covered Callao\r\nappeared, as I looked down upon it from my mountain-peak, like a billowy\r\nfield of snow sparkling in the sun, with the summit of San Lorenzo\r\nstanding out like some bare alpine summit from amidst the snows. Yet\r\nbeneath that dazzling covering Callao lay all in gloom; whilst only six\r\nmiles up the broad valley of the Rimac the city of Lima stood in a blaze\r\nof sunlight, its domes and towers reflecting back the light as I looked\r\nat the strange contrast it presented with the buried city of the coast.\r\nThe mystery of a London fog seemed to lie unfolded at my feet, ready for\r\nthe man who can read the signs aright.\r\n\r\nThat the mere presence of a cold current on a coast with the winds\r\nblowing off the land (as in the case of the Labrador current, which\r\nextends down the Atlantic coast of North America to Cape Hatteras and\r\nbeyond) produces no sterilising effect on the vegetation of the\r\nsea-border of a continent is well brought out in the beautifully\r\nexecuted maps in Prof. Russell’s recent work on North America. The\r\nessential condition for producing sterility on the sea-border of a\r\ncontinent is not only that the waters of a cold current should wash its\r\ncoasts, but that the regular winds should blow landward across its cool\r\nsurface. These are what we find on the west coast of South America.\r\n\r\nNot with the hope of adding anything new to our knowledge of the\r\nclimatology of this region, but with the purpose of becoming personally\r\nacquainted with the problem involved, I paid considerable attention to\r\nthis subject during the three months passed on the west coast of South\r\nAmerica between Port Valdivia and Guayaquil. It was not until I had\r\ndropped my thermometer into the cool water of the Humboldt current and\r\nhad watched the formation of the fogs on the sterile coast of Peru that\r\nthe real nature of the problem presented itself. From the pages of a\r\nwork like Tschudi’s _Travels in Peru_ one acquires an excellent idea of\r\nthe extraordinary climatic conditions of this region, and the same may\r\nbe said of the narratives of Darwin and other travellers; but it is\r\nnecessary to be brought into personal contact with these conditions\r\nbefore one can appreciate their significance.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, says Baron von Eggers, the Humboldt current explains\r\nthe anomalous climate of the coast of Peru, and one may add of North\r\nChile and Ecuador. The current, which represents the extension\r\nnorthwards of the west wind-drift of the Roaring Forties (see Dickson in\r\n_Encycl. Brit._, xxxi. 404; and Admiralty Current Charts of the\r\nPacific), begins on the coast between the 33rd and 40th parallels of\r\nsouth latitude, according to the season. North of Valdivia, as we\r\napproach Valparaiso, in lat. 33°S., the effect of its presence is at\r\nonce seen in the increasing dryness of the climate and in the alteration\r\nin the character of the vegetation. It has, however, been shown that the\r\ncurrent needs the co-operation of the prevailing southerly and westerly\r\nwinds as they blow landward over its cool waters. On the coast of Peru\r\nthese moist winds often generate fog and mist as they cross the current.\r\nThey reach the coast as drying winds, having a temperature much cooler\r\nthan the lower coast regions; and the air-currents do not precipitate\r\nany moisture on the land until an elevation of 4,000 to 6,000 feet is\r\nattained where the cloud-belt is formed.\r\n\r\nIn order to establish this theory it is, however, necessary to show that\r\nwhen the Humboldt current leaves the coast normal conditions of humidity\r\noccur, to which the vegetation responds, and that when the current\r\nstrikes the coast again the conditions of aridity reappear. In its\r\ncourse northward the current divides off Cape Blanco, the principal mass\r\nof its waters making towards the Galapagos Group, whilst the remainder,\r\nafter crossing the Gulf of Guayaquil, flow along the coast of Ecuador\r\nbetween Santa Elena and the equator. Now, it is along this stretch of\r\nthe Ecuador coast that the conditions of aridity reappear and that the\r\nclimate of the Peruvian sea-border is in a modified form reproduced. In\r\nthe interior of the Gulf of Guayaquil, on the other hand, where the\r\nsea-border is no longer subjected to the influence of the cold waters of\r\nthe Humboldt current, the genius of the tropics, repressed through so\r\nmany degrees of latitude, bursts its bonds, and presents us with a\r\nspectacle of littoral vegetation that, so far as mangrove-growth is\r\nconcerned, is probably unrivalled on our globe.\r\n\r\nThis contrast is well shown in the mean annual temperatures on the\r\nopposite sides of the Gulf of Guayaquil. Baron von Eggers, quoting Dr.\r\nWolff, states that whilst the mean for the year at Puna is about 75° F.,\r\nand at Santa Elena about 73°, on the south side of the gulf at Balao it\r\nis several degrees warmer and is evidently not under 80°. The mean\r\ntemperature for the second week of March during my sojourn at Puerto\r\nBolivar, which is near the beginning of the mangrove region on the south\r\nside of the gulf, was 79°, the mean daily range being 74° to 83·5°. This\r\nstretch of dry coast reaching north from Puna to the equator is\r\nevidently regarded by Baron von Eggers and others who have studied the\r\nclimatology of Ecuador as the critical area required to confirm the\r\ntheory connecting the aridity of the west coast of South America with\r\nthe Humboldt current. Here the sea for the greater part of the year has\r\na temperature (according to the British Admiralty chart of\r\nsurface-temperatures) of 70° to 75°; the mean temperature of the air is\r\n73° to 75°; the rainy season, instead of covering a period of six months\r\nand over, as in the humid regions north and south of this coast, has a\r\nduration of only two or three months; the prevailing wind is south-west;\r\nwhilst the direct influence of the cool waters of the current is shown\r\nin the general cloudiness that prevails during the last half of the year\r\nand in the drizzling mists that are frequent from June to October.\r\nReference has already been made to the manner in which the vegetation on\r\nthis dry coast of Ecuador responds to the arid conditions, as, for\r\ninstance, in the absence of mangroves and in the prevailing character of\r\nthe plants of the sea-border, cacti, thorny plants, and such like. For\r\nmy information on this exceedingly interesting tract of coast, which is\r\nthe test-ground of the Humboldt current theory, I am indebted to the\r\npapers of Baron von Eggers (see end of this volume) and to Mr. F. P.\r\nWalker, of the Central and South American Telegraph Company’s Station at\r\nSanta Elena, who very kindly communicated with me by letter. Some\r\nadditional remarks are given in Note 73, and my own observations on the\r\ntemperature of the Humboldt current from Antofagasta northward are\r\nsummarised in Note 74.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the Ecuador coast a word may be said relating to the\r\nprediction of Villavicencio that the climate of this sea-border will\r\nassimilate itself to that of the rainless coasts of Peru. This is, I\r\nbelieve, also the opinion expressed by Dr. Wolff in his _Geografia y\r\nGeologia del Ecuador_ (Leipzig, 1892); and it is referred to by Mr.\r\nWebster in his article on Ecuador in the seventh volume of the\r\n_Encyclopædia Britannica_. There is a prevailing impression amongst the\r\nmore observing residents that I met in the Ecuadorian province of Eloro,\r\non the Peruvian border, that the country is drying up. A few pages back\r\nI have described how in the Machala district of this province the\r\nmangrove-belt passes landward into an arid region suggestive of the\r\nsea-border of Peru. This transition is startling to one who expects to\r\nfind behind the mangrove-belt, as he would find in most parts of the\r\nworld, a humid region where Nature revels in the rank luxuriance of\r\nplant-growth. This is, however, not always the case, since on the lee or\r\ndry sides of the large islands of Fiji the mangrove-belt is backed by\r\nextensive arid plains, for an explanation of which, as I have shown in\r\nNote 22, we have to appeal rather to the hygrometer than to the\r\nrain-gauge. This is true also of Ecuador; but whilst the reason is\r\nintelligible enough in Fiji, it only carries us a step farther back in\r\nthe case of the Machala plains in Ecuador. These plains are continuous\r\nwith similar districts across the Peruvian border where they reach the\r\ncoast; and if the reader will refer again to my description of the\r\nsection of the mangrove-belt and the plains in its rear from Puerto\r\nBolivar to Machala, he will incline to the view that the desiccation of\r\nthe sea-border of Ecuador is now in progress.\r\n\r\nEvidence of a more direct nature could doubtless be supplied by those\r\nwho have long resided on the coast of Ecuador, and in illustration I\r\nwill give an extract from one of Mr. Walker’s letters dated May, 1904,\r\nfrom Santa Elena.—“The rainfall here might for the last ten years be put\r\ndown at two showers per year. It is said that the last good rainy season\r\nwas in 1891. The inhabitants say that formerly it always rained enough\r\nto make the grass grow every year, but during the eleven years I have\r\nbeen here there appears to be a marked falling off of the rainfall.”\r\n\r\nIt has been only possible to touch the fringe of this interesting\r\nquestion here; but from the standpoint of the study of the littoral\r\nflora of the west coast of South America it is of some importance.\r\nImmediately behind the epoch of the present marine molluscan fauna of\r\nthis coast there lies an age when, as we learn from Philippi, the shells\r\nof Chile were more akin to those of the Atlantic and Mediterranean\r\nfaunas than to those now found on the Chilian coasts. The transition is\r\na sudden one; and amongst other explanations of this strange\r\ntransformation Suess suggests the sealing up of a communication through\r\nthe Panama isthmus by volcanic eruptions and the appearance of the\r\nHumboldt current (_Das Antlitz der Erde_, French edit. by Margerie, ii.\r\n825). May it not be, my readers may ask, that the west coast of South\r\nAmerica is still in the age of progressive sterility; and that before\r\nthis age began Peru possessed a normal tropical strand-flora? It has\r\nbeen remarked in Chapter VIII. that the same species of mangroves occur\r\non both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of America, and that at all\r\nevents their present distribution belongs to an age when the Gulf of\r\nMexico was in communication with the Pacific Ocean. May we not, again,\r\nsuppose that in that age the mangroves extended far south on the coast\r\nof Peru, just as they do now on the coast of Brazil?\r\n\r\nCoral reefs are stated not to exist in tropical latitudes on the west\r\ncoast of South America in our own day; but we might almost expect that\r\nat the close of the Tertiary period, and perhaps before the appearance\r\nof the Humboldt current, they existed with the mangroves on the coast of\r\nPeru. As bearing on the subject of a change of climate on that coast in\r\ntimes geologically not remote, I may allude to the circumstance, which\r\nis discussed more in detail in Note 75, that I found, sometimes in fair\r\nquantity, blocks of massive coral, long since dead, much pierced by\r\nboring shells, and in places undergoing a chemical change, at Arica\r\n(lat. 18° 25ʹ S.), at Callao (12° 3ʹ S.), and at Ancon (11° 45ʹ S.) on\r\nthe coast of Peru.\r\n\r\nThese masses, which varied from a few inches to two or three feet in\r\nsize, gave me the impression of having been torn off the bottom, in some\r\ncases in recent times, in others perhaps centuries ago, by the huge\r\nsea-waves that from time to time overwhelm this coast. At Ancon, where\r\nthey were sufficiently abundant to be used for bordering the flower beds\r\nin the hotel garden, they were most numerous in the vicinity of a rocky\r\nspur of andesite that protruded from the beach between the tide levels\r\nand was more or less covered at high water. A few paces inland from the\r\nbeach some of these coral masses, evidently stranded long ago, were\r\nundergoing that queer process of disintegration which everything\r\ncalcareous seems to undergo on the beaches and plains of this almost\r\nrainless coast. Like the bones of the Incas lying bleaching on the\r\nneighbouring plains, like the sea-shells and bones of bird and beast\r\ncast up long ago on the beach, they were falling to powder where they\r\nlay, and the coral fragment lay often in the midst of its own _débris_.\r\nThe blocks on the beach proper were for the most part still hard and\r\ncompact, and the same may be said of those observed on the beaches of\r\nCallao and Arica.\r\n\r\nThe corals were quite different from those with which I was familiar in\r\nthe reefs of the Pacific islands, and, bearing in mind the known\r\ndistribution of coral reefs, I was a little dubious about them.\r\nAccordingly I sent some specimens to the British Museum, and Mr. Jeffrey\r\nBell has kindly informed me that they seem to be decayed and much\r\ninjured perforated examples of Porites. When powdered they effervesce in\r\nan acid, but the bulk of the material remains undissolved.\r\n\r\nNo more eloquent testimony could be afforded of the rainless climate\r\nthan these corals crumbling on the Ancon plains when washed a few paces\r\ninland from the beach. They could be noticed in all stages of\r\ndisintegration from the block surrounded by a little line of\r\ndisintegrated material, representing the initial products of its own\r\ndecay, to the crumbling mass, almost friable in the fingers, that was\r\nlying in the midst of its own dust and loose polyp-tubes, and finally to\r\nthe little mound of _débris_ that alone remained. Mr. Darwin, in his\r\n_Journal of Researches_ (chap. xvi.), refers to a similar process of\r\ndecay in the elevated shell-beds of San Lorenzo, off the coast of\r\nCallao. On the higher terraces a layer of saline powder, consisting of\r\nsulphates and muriates of lime and soda but with very little carbonate\r\nof lime, was the sole indication of the shell-beds. Dry climatic\r\nconditions at the sea-border evidently favour, as he observes, the early\r\ndecay of exposed calcareous remains.\r\n\r\n\r\n   _The Shore-plants and Stranded Seed-drift of the Panama Isthmus._\r\n\r\nI spent two days at Panama and two days at Colon in examining the\r\nneighbouring beaches and estuaries of the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of\r\nthe isthmus. On the Panama side the mangrove-belt was formed on the\r\nseaward border of “mangle chico” (the small prevailing type of\r\nRhizophora mangle), Laguncularia, and Avicennia; whilst behind it passed\r\ninto extensive swampy tracts occupied by the Swamp Fern (Chrysodium\r\naureum), Hibiscus tiliaceus, and other plants. On the Colon or Atlantic\r\nside the mangrove-belt had precisely the same composition and presented\r\nthe same species, Rhizophora and Avicennia usually forming the outposts\r\non the reef-flat, whilst Laguncularia was abundant in the rear. In the\r\nestuary of the Rio Chagres, Rhizophora and Laguncularia were abundant\r\nnear the mouth, and Chrysodium aureum and Hibiscus tiliaceus by the\r\nwaterside higher up. Dr. Seemann, in his volume on the botany of the\r\nvoyage of H.M.S. _Herald_, observes that the species of Laguncularia\r\ncommon on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the Panama isthmus is\r\nL. racemosa. This species differs in the form of its fruit from the\r\nEcuador tree. Laguncularia racemosa, Rhizophora mangle, and I may add\r\nAnona paludosa and Conocarpus erecta, are all plants of the\r\nmangrove-formation that occur not only on the Pacific and Atlantic\r\ncoasts of America but also on the west coast of Africa. It is likely, I\r\nmay add, that the “mangle grande,” the Ecuadorian type of Rhizophora\r\nmangle, exists in the Panama isthmus, since in the higher part of the\r\nestuary of the Chagres I found trees approaching it in characters.\r\n\r\nAmongst the plants growing on the Panama beaches I noticed Canavalia\r\nobtusifolia, Hibiscus tiliaceus, and Ipomœa pes capræ, all of which\r\noccur also on the Atlantic side of the isthmus. The Manchineel\r\n(Hippomane mancinella), found also on the Atlantic side of the\r\ncontinent, grows on the Panama beaches. Its fruits, which look like\r\ncrab-apples, lose their outer fleshy covering when drying on the sand.\r\nNot being familiar with this poisonous tree, I allowed some of the milky\r\nsap of the fruits to touch the skin, and suffered great pain for five or\r\nsix hours. The fruit possesses an inner coat of air-bearing cork-like\r\ntissue; and the stone, if I may so term it, thus acquires great floating\r\npower. I kept some afloat in sea-water for five weeks, and no doubt they\r\nwill float for months.\r\n\r\nThe seed-drift to be observed stranded on the beaches and floating in\r\nthe estuaries on both sides of the isthmus is, generally speaking, the\r\nsame—a circumstance of great importance in plant-distribution, since we\r\ncan here see rivers bringing down the same seeds from the same “divide”\r\nto the shores of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. In the case of a plant\r\nlike Entada scandens, which grows in the interior, this is a matter of\r\nmuch interest, as it thus possesses here a centre of dispersal from\r\nwhich its seeds can be carried by the currents eastward to the West\r\nAfrican coast and westward across the Pacific to Malaya and (given time)\r\naround the shores of the Indian Ocean to the East African coast. In\r\ndescribing the possible routes of dispersion from this centre I have\r\ndescribed the distribution of the species.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Mr. Holland, of the Kew Museum, for the identification\r\nof some of the drift-seeds and fruits collected by me on the isthmus,\r\nthose identified by him being followed by the letter H. On the beaches\r\nand floating in the estuaries on both sides of the isthmus I found\r\nRhizophora seedlings; seeds of Entada scandens and Mucuna urens\r\n(medic.), H.; seedvessels of Spondias lutea (Linn.), H.; Prioria\r\ncopaifera (Griseb.), H., with decayed seed; and the empty nuts, 1-1/2 to\r\n2 inches in size, of more than one species of Astrocaryum, H. Although\r\nin the case of the two last-named genera the seedvessels were useless\r\nfor dispersal, being evidently brought down from the interior by the\r\nrivers, they serve to illustrate the important principle that the rivers\r\nbring down the same seed-drift on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts\r\nof Central America. Mr. Hemsley includes amongst the seed-drift stranded\r\non the coast of Jamaica the seedvessels of Spondias (probably S. lutea)\r\nand of Astrocaryum (_Bot. Chall. Exped._, iv. 299, 304).\r\n\r\nThose of Spondias lutea were found by me floating in the Guayaquil River\r\nand stranded on the beaches of Ecuador and of the Pacific and Atlantic\r\ncoasts of the Panama isthmus. This is the Hog-plum, which in tropical\r\nAmerica and the West Indies is both wild and cultivated. Its buoyant\r\n“stone” has a covering of cork-like air-bearing tissue. This is a\r\nremarkable case of non-adaptation in the matter of buoyancy. The\r\nseedvessels cut across contained sound seeds; and they are provided with\r\nthe essential qualities of “long floaters.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Summary._\r\n\r\n(1) The strand-district of the west coast of South America is divided\r\ninto four zones:—\r\n\r\n(_a_) The Convolvulus soldanella zone of Southern Chile.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The Desert or Plantless zone of Northern Chile.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The Sesuvium zone of Peru.\r\n\r\n(_d_) The Mangrove zone of Ecuador and Colombia.\r\n\r\n(2) The mangroves do not extend south of Ecuador or, more strictly,\r\nsouth of Tumbez (3° 30ʹ S.).\r\n\r\n(3) The absence of mangroves on the tropical coasts of Chile and Peru is\r\nattributed to the Humboldt current, which has so influenced the climate\r\nthat it has converted the sea-border of North Chile into a desert and\r\nthat of Peru into a region of semi-sterility.\r\n\r\n(4) It is considered that this has been effected through the prevailing\r\nwinds acquiring drying qualities on crossing the cold waters of the\r\ncurrent in tropical latitudes.\r\n\r\n(5) To establish this it is shown that when the Humboldt current leaves\r\nthe coast at Cape Blanco mangroves thrive in the Gulf of Guayaquil, and\r\nthat when it strikes the coast again near Santa Elena Point and courses\r\nalong that seaboard to the equator we find the Peruvian conditions of\r\nsemi-sterility reproduced.\r\n\r\n(6) The probability that the arid climate of Peru is in our own time\r\nextending northward into Ecuador is pointed out; and from the presence\r\nof old coral blocks on the Peruvian beaches it is considered likely that\r\nwhen these corals throve the mangroves extended far down the coast of\r\nPeru.\r\n\r\n(7) It is shown from the presence of the same species of mangroves on\r\nthe Pacific and Atlantic coasts of America that there must have been,\r\nnot long ago, a communication between these two oceans across Central\r\nAmerica; but it is at the same time observed that this could not be\r\ninferred from shore-plants with buoyant seeds that, like Entada\r\nscandens, occur inland, since, although they occur on both sides of the\r\ncontinent, their distribution can be explained by the transport of their\r\nseeds by rivers to the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, such as we see in\r\noperation on the Panama isthmus in our own day.\r\n\r\n(8) Stress is laid on the great development of mangroves in the Gulf of\r\nGuayaquil and in the Guayas estuary; and it is pointed out that there\r\nare in this locality two varieties of Rhizophora mangle, a large and a\r\nsmall variety, the first approaching in some of its characters the\r\nAsiatic species, R. mucronata, and being akin also to the seedless\r\nintermediate form of Fiji.\r\n\r\n(9) Amongst other matters dealt with in this chapter are the floating\r\nseed-drift of the Guayas or Guayaquil River and the shore plants and\r\nstranded seed-drift of the Panama isthmus. From the locality last named\r\nwe learn that rivers bring down from the interior to the Atlantic and\r\nPacific coasts much the same seed-drift, and that from this centre\r\nlittoral plants with buoyant seeds can be distributed over the whole\r\ntropical zone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n                   SEED-DISPERSAL AND GEOLOGICAL TIME\r\n\r\nThe shifting of the source of the Polynesian plants from the New to the\r\n  Old World.—The floral history of Polynesia stated in terms of\r\n  geological time.—The suspension of the agencies of dispersal in later\r\n  periods.—Parallel differentiation in the course of ages of climate,\r\n  bird, and plant.—New Zealand.—Insects and bats as agents in\r\n  plant-dispersal.—The effective agency of sea-birds in other\r\n  regions.—The observations of Ekstam.—The Spitzbergen controversy.—The\r\n  efficacy of ducks as distributors of aquatic plants.—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the matter of the dispersal of seeds by birds in the tropical\r\nPacific, there are at least two questions which my readers must have\r\nfrequently put to themselves. The one would be concerned with the\r\nshifting of the source of the Polynesian plants from America to the Old\r\nWorld, which occurred probably near the close of the Tertiary period.\r\nThe other would be connected with the suspension of the work of\r\ndispersal over a large portion of Polynesia, which has become more and\r\nmore pronounced as we approach our own day.\r\n\r\n_Suggested Cause of the Shifting of the Source of the Polynesian Plants\r\nfrom the New to the Old World._—In previous chapters we have discussed\r\nthe various epochs in the plant-stocking of these islands. There was\r\nfirst the age of Coniferæ, in which the islands of the Western Pacific\r\nwere only concerned, an age prior to the appearance of the volcanic\r\ngroups of the Tahitian and Hawaiian regions, and placed in the Secondary\r\nperiod. Then followed, in the Tertiary period, after the birth of Hawaii\r\nand Tahiti, and when the island-groups of the Western Pacific were\r\nmainly submerged, the general dispersion from America of the Compositæ,\r\nLobeliaceæ, and other orders, now represented only by genera peculiar to\r\nthe Hawaiian and Tahitian islands. Last of all, towards the close of the\r\nTertiary period, when the island-groups of the Western Pacific had\r\nre-emerged, a general dispersion of Old World plants, mainly Malayan,\r\ntook place over all the present archipelagoes of the tropical Pacific.\r\n\r\nSince the climate of Hawaii must have, to a great extent, shared in the\r\nvicissitudes of the continental climates of the northern hemisphere\r\nbefore, during, and after the Glacial epoch, it is assumed that in the\r\nIce Age no tropical plants reached the group, and that only the plants\r\nnow represented in its mountain-flora could have then reached there. The\r\narea of active dispersion of tropical plants was pushed far south.\r\nDuring the Ice period, Indo-Malayan plants doubtless crowded into the\r\nequatorial region of the Western Pacific; but, cramped and confined\r\nwithin this limited area, they were cut off by a climatic barrier from\r\nthe cool latitudes of Hawaii. As the cold ages passed away, migratory\r\nbirds, confined during that period to the southern hemisphere, would\r\nextend their ranges north, sometimes reaching Hawaii, and transporting\r\nto it the seeds of New Zealand and Antarctic genera, now represented by\r\nendemic species on its mountain-slopes. The Indo-Malayan plants, with\r\nthe increasing warmth in the climate of the northern hemisphere, would\r\noverrun the Pacific, set free from their prison in the south-west\r\nportion of that ocean. Dispersal, we might imagine, would be at first\r\nvery active over the whole ocean.\r\n\r\nMy point is, then, that whilst the Malayan era of the plant-stocking\r\nbegan after the Ice Age in the northern hemisphere, the dispersion of\r\nthe New Zealand and Antarctic genera over the Pacific took place during\r\nthat period; whilst, as before noticed, the dispersion of the Compositæ,\r\nLobeliaceæ, and other orders, represented now in Hawaii by endemic\r\ngenera, would be pre-Glacial and well back in the Tertiary epoch. I\r\nwould, therefore, suggest the following scheme, in illustration of the\r\nfloral history of the tropical Pacific.\r\n\r\n(1) The Age of Conifers of the Western Pacific during the Mesozoic\r\nperiod, and before the appearance of the Hawaiian and Tahitian\r\narchipelagoes.\r\n\r\n(2) The Age of Compositæ and Lobeliaceæ, and of other genera. This is an\r\nera of American plants, and it is referred to the Tertiary period. In it\r\nonly the newly-formed Hawaiian and Tahitian groups shared, the islands\r\nof the Western Pacific being largely submerged.\r\n\r\n(3) The Age of Malayan plants, regarded as mainly post-Glacial, and\r\nsubsequent, therefore, to the re-emergence of the Western Pacific\r\nislands at the close of the Tertiary period.\r\n\r\nDispersion then was general over the Pacific. The distribution of the\r\nNew Zealand and Antarctic genera, plants that take a subordinate part in\r\nthe floras of the Pacific islands, is regarded as having occurred during\r\nthe glaciation of the northern hemisphere.\r\n\r\n_On the Suspension of the Agencies of Dispersal in the Tropical\r\nPacific._—If the remark of Drake del Castillo that genera possessing\r\nonly non-endemic species in the Pacific islands owe their presence in\r\nthis region to existing agencies of dispersal looks something like a\r\ntruism, we must remember that, assuming Nature to be uniform in her\r\nmethods, it involves not merely the original co-operation of the same\r\nagencies with genera that own only peculiar species, but also the\r\nsubsequent suspension of the work of these agencies.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the connection between freedom of dispersal and specific\r\ndifferentiation is well brought out by Beccari in contrasting the\r\nspecies of Ficus and the palms of Borneo; whilst out of fifty-five\r\nspecies of Ficus collected by him in that island, 30 per cent. were\r\napparently peculiar, 85 per cent. of the 130 Borneo palms had not been\r\nfound elsewhere. In the English edition of his _Nelle Foreste di Borneo_\r\nhe says that “the explanation lies in the fact of the facile\r\ndissemination of the various species of Ficus through the agency of\r\nbirds, an explanation which applies to all trees which produce edible\r\nfruits specially relished by animals.” He shows, also, that the same\r\nprinciple applies within the limits of the genus Ficus, since of those\r\nBornean species known to him as belonging to the section Urostigma,\r\nwhich possesses fruits most preferred by birds (pigeons, hornbills,\r\n&c.), nearly all (fourteen out of sixteen) are found elsewhere; whilst\r\nof ten species belonging to the section Covellia, where the fruits are\r\nmore or less hidden and inconspicuous, and with difficulty discovered by\r\nbirds that would effectively distribute the species, four, at the most,\r\nare found elsewhere. “Such facts,” he goes on to say, “show that in\r\ntropical countries the various kinds of Ficus are, to a large extent,\r\nbiologically connected with birds, which, perhaps, on their part, also\r\nowe some of their peculiarities in the shape of the bill or in the\r\nplumage to the nature and coloration of the fruits which form their\r\nfood.”\r\n\r\nWhilst Dr. Beccari as a botanist lays especial stress on the biological\r\nconnection in Malaya between the plant, as illustrated by the genus\r\nFicus, and the bird, Mr. Perkins, as a zoologist, is similarly emphatic\r\non the biological connection in Hawaii between the bird, as illustrated\r\nby the peculiar family of the Drepanididæ, and the plant. The plants\r\nhere are the arborescent Lobeliaceæ and the Freycinetias. To the flowers\r\nof the arborescent Lobeliaceæ the nectar-feeding Drepanids are\r\nparticularly partial; and the development of the extreme forms of these\r\nbirds, as Mr. Perkins observes in the _Fauna Hawaiiensis_, “is not\r\ncomprehensible without a knowledge of the island flora.” Not only does\r\nhe point to the modifications in the form of the bill of the bird in\r\nconnection with the tubular form of the flowers; but in at least one\r\nspecies of these arborescent Lobeliaceæ he shows that it is dependent on\r\nthe Drepanid for its fertilisation, and he inclines to the view that\r\nchanges such as that of lengthening of the bill may have taken place\r\nside by side with the increasing length of the tubular flowers. In\r\nconnection with the Freycinetias of Hawaii, Mr. Perkins regards the bill\r\nof the Ou, a finch-like Drepanid of the genus Psittacirostra, as\r\n“entirely formed and adapted for the purpose of picking out the\r\ncomponent parts” of the fruiting inflorescence.\r\n\r\nThat in an isolated island-group birds and plants often “differentiate”\r\ntogether is a fact well known in distribution. In Hawaii, for instance,\r\nas I learn from Mr. Perkins, quite 45 per cent. of the birds are\r\npeculiar; whilst according to Dr. Hillebrand 80 per cent. of the\r\nflowering plants are confined to the group. Then, again, in the\r\nGalapagos Islands, half of the plants and two-thirds of the birds are\r\nconfined to that archipelago. At the other end of the series we have the\r\nAzores, with about a tenth of its plants peculiar, and about 4 per cent.\r\nof its birds peculiar to the islands, and Iceland with no endemic plants\r\nand, as far as I can gather, few peculiar birds.\r\n\r\nAccepting Mr. Charles Dixon’s view (_The Migration of Birds_, 1897) that\r\nspecific differentiation does not occur along lines of migration, we\r\nmust assume that the differentiation of the avifauna of an isolated\r\ngroup like Hawaii began with the breaking off of its regular\r\ncommunication through birds with the outside world. I do not consider\r\nthat in the past these Pacific archipelagoes received their birds in any\r\nhaphazard fashion, as, for instance, in the guise of stragglers that had\r\nlost their way. From the circumstance pointed out to me by Mr. Perkins\r\nthat 25 of the 67 genera of Hawaiian birds are peculiar, we must\r\npostulate a high antiquity for the bird fauna dating far back into the\r\nTertiary period. Mr. Perkins, who kindly supplied me with his general\r\nviews of the nature of the Hawaiian fauna, tells me that it is\r\n“positively oceanic-insular and could be continental only on the\r\nsupposition that everything continental had been at some time destroyed\r\nand that the group had been subsequently re-stocked as would any oceanic\r\nisland.”\r\n\r\nThe view naturally presents itself that in past ages birds in the\r\nPacific were much more uniform in their characters, and the agencies of\r\ndispersal far more active in their operations and far more general in\r\ntheir range than in more recent times, “It may be accepted (says Mr.\r\nDixon) as an axiom of geographical distribution that all existing\r\nspecies are surviving relics of more ancient forms or ancestral types,\r\nwhose dispersal in a remoter past was more continuous, and whose\r\naffinities and characteristics were therefore more homogeneous.” I\r\nassume that in past ages the differentiation of birds has largely been\r\nfavoured by differentiation of climate acting through the limitation of\r\ntheir ranges. To these changes, plants, so often biologically connected\r\nwith birds, have largely responded.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, no difficulty in imputing to birds the capacity of\r\nreaching Hawaii in the mid-Pacific, and there are many regular migrants\r\nnow (sea-birds, waders, ducks, &c.). The only difficulty is in the\r\nestimation of the time occupied in the trans-oceanic journey. According\r\nto Gätke the journey, which is 1,500 to 2,000 miles, ought to be\r\naccomplished within the limit of fifteen hours, which he regards as “the\r\nlongest spell during which a bird is able to remain on the wing without\r\ntaking sustenance of any kind.” As he considers that a bird might cover\r\nthe 1,600 miles between Newfoundland and Ireland in nine hours\r\n(_Heligoland as an Ornithological Observatory_, p. 140), the Hawaiian\r\ntraverse would offer to him no difficulties. It has frequently occurred\r\nto me in this connection that in ancient times, when the volcanoes of\r\nthe mid-Pacific were in full activity, their light at night-time would\r\nhave often given a direction to the migrating bird, and that they might\r\nhave sometimes determined the line of migration across the Pacific.\r\n\r\nIt has not been possible to discuss here the capacity of pigeons to\r\ncross an ocean, a subject bearing directly on the floras of all the\r\nPacific groups (excepting Hawaii, which possesses no indigenous Columbæ)\r\nand as concerning these islands generally presenting no difficulty. Dr.\r\nH. de Varigny, who amongst his other studies has long displayed an\r\nactive interest in plant-dispersal, has directed my attention to two\r\nvery important papers on the flight of pigeons in the _Revue\r\nScientifique_, one by M. A. Thauziès (April 30, 1898) and the other by\r\nM. M. Dusolier (Nov. 28, 1903). That land birds, as well as swimmers and\r\nwaders, cross the Atlantic is well known, and in this connection the\r\nreader might profitably consult Prof. Heilprin’s _Geographical\r\nDistribution of Animals_ (vol. 58, _Internat. Sci. Ser._ 1887).\r\n\r\nMuch might be said of these matters, but it would be out of place here;\r\nand I will content myself with stating the view above indicated that the\r\nsuspension of the agencies of seed-dispersal over the Pacific is\r\nprobably connected with a general principle affecting the whole\r\nplant-world. The tendency in the course of ages has been towards the\r\ndifferentiation of climate, bird, and plant, the range of the bird being\r\nlargely controlled by the climate, and the range of the plant being\r\nmainly dependent on the range of the bird.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that in some cases the plants themselves may make the\r\nendemism of a flora more pronounced by creating their own difficulties\r\nand by standing in the way of their own dispersal to outside regions. It\r\nhas been shown that some of the endemic Hawaiian genera (see Note 68)\r\nhave deteriorated in their capacity for dispersal by birds; and similar\r\nremarks are made with reference to the genera Sicyos (page 365) and\r\nEugenia (page 350). Genera with stone fruits like Elæocarpus possess in\r\nthe different species stones of various sizes, some of them suitable in\r\npoint of size for conveyance in a bird’s body over an ocean, others so\r\nlarge that one could only predicate for them a limited capacity for\r\ndistribution by birds over a few hundred miles of sea. One, for\r\ninstance, could safely assume that species of Elæocarpus, with stones an\r\ninch and over in size, that occur in Fiji and Hawaii, are not suited for\r\ndistribution over an ocean now; whilst other species found in New\r\nZealand and Rarotonga have stones less than half this size, which are\r\nquite fitted for distribution by birds over broad tracts of ocean (page\r\n337).\r\n\r\nThis brings us to discuss the relative difficulties presented from the\r\ndispersal-standpoint by the forest floras of Hawaii, Fiji, and New\r\nZealand. It is with the forest floras that nearly all the difficulties\r\nof distribution lie; and I hope I shall not be considered presumptuous,\r\nor at all events too heterodox, in expressing the opinion that judging\r\nfrom the details given in Kirk’s _Forest Flora of New Zealand_ those\r\nislands present no greater difficulties for the student of\r\nplant-distribution, if we exclude the Coniferæ, than either Fiji or\r\nHawaii. Indeed, even with the Conifers included, New Zealand presents\r\nfewer problems than Fiji, and Hawaii has its own special difficulties\r\nconnected with the inland species of the Leguminosæ. There is, on the\r\nother hand, no special New Zealand difficulty. It possesses the Conifers\r\nin common with Fiji; and it shares with Fiji and Hawaii genera like\r\nElæocarpus and Sideroxylon, that take a foremost place amongst the trees\r\nof the Pacific forest flora presenting puzzling points to the student of\r\ndistribution. The existence of Elæocarpus in New Zealand admits of a\r\nsimpler explanation than the occurrence of the same genus in Hawaii.\r\nPandanus in Fiji is a more difficult genus from the standpoint of\r\ndispersal than Corynocarpus in New Zealand, and in fact, than any of the\r\nnon-coniferous genera of forest trees in that region.\r\n\r\nWhilst it is likely that birds of the genus Porphyrio have, up to almost\r\nrecent times, been active in distributing the seeds of New Zealand\r\nplants outside the region (see p. 296), it would seem that the\r\nfruit-pigeons, as represented by a solitary peculiar species of\r\nCarpophaga, have long since ceased to be active in this direction. It is\r\ntrue that Sir W. Buller gives a long list of trees, including\r\nCorynocarpus, Elæocarpus, Litsea, Olea, Podocarpus, and many others, the\r\nfruits of which are appreciated by this pigeon; but since the bird is\r\nconfined to this region its efforts in plant-dispersal possess only a\r\nlocal interest. Mr. G. M. Thomson, indeed, has expressed the opinion\r\n(_Trans. and Proc. N.Z. Instit._ vol. 33) that in recent times not a\r\nsingle plant has been added through the agency of birds to the New\r\nZealand flora. Besides the regular migratory birds two cuckoos only\r\nreach the region, the one from Australia and the other from Polynesia;\r\nwhilst Australian birds which had managed to survive the long flight\r\nacross the ocean have been met with only at times on the west coast of\r\nthe North Island. From the standpoint adopted in this work we should\r\nhave expected that, with the exception of current-dispersed plants, New\r\nZealand would be out of touch with the world outside. Varied only by\r\noccasional inrushes of plants, its history, dating back to the Mesozoic\r\nage, has been one of insular isolation.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, we apply the principles of plant-dispersal in the\r\nPacific, deducible from the study of the Hawaiian flora, we learn that\r\nthe stocking of New Zealand with its plants could have been carried out\r\n(with the exception of the Coniferæ and a few other genera like Fagus\r\nthat are in a geological sense ancient denizens in this region) by the\r\nagencies that stocked Hawaii with its flora. New Zealand genera like\r\nElæocarpus, Sideroxylon, Sophora, etc., that are represented in the\r\nforests of Hawaii, could not be taken to illustrate any former\r\ncontinental connection. If we, so-to-speak, put the New Zealand forest\r\nflora in the Hawaiian sieve, all will pass through with the exception of\r\nFagus, the genera of the Coniferæ, and plants of similar history in high\r\nsouthern latitudes. This residuum belongs more to the palæobotanist than\r\nto the student of means of dispersal.\r\n\r\nI should be inclined to think that the tropical genera of the New\r\nZealand flora, more especially of the forest flora, reached that region\r\nduring the glaciation of the northern hemisphere, when the Indo-Malayan\r\nplants were, so-to-speak, cornered in the Western Pacific. Yet it must\r\nbe noted that these are, as a rule, genera that either display an\r\nindifference to the varying thermal conditions of different latitudes or\r\nare known to at times extend their range beyond the tropics. Thus\r\nElæocarpus and Freycinetia are equally at home in the temperate\r\nrain-forests of New Zealand and in the tropical rain-forests of\r\nPolynesia and Malaya; whilst widely-spread tropical genera like\r\nPittosporum and Peperomia, that occur in New Zealand, exhibit their\r\npower of adaptation to varying climates by extending outside the tropics\r\nin other regions and by their vertical range in the Hawaiian mountains,\r\nwhere they are found alike at low elevations a few hundred feet above\r\nthe sea and at altitudes of 6,000 or 7,000 feet.\r\n\r\nAll these plants, however, are in a relative sense recent intruders.\r\nWhen the student of dispersal looks at the long list of the conifers of\r\nthe New Zealand forest flora and reflects that he knows but little of\r\ntheir means of dispersal, and that if his acquaintance were far greater\r\nit would not avail him much, he has no choice but to take his place\r\nbehind the earlier investigators of the flora, and to see in these trees\r\nevidence in favour of a remote continental period, probably referable to\r\nthe mesozoic age.\r\n\r\n_A Discussion of some Means of Dispersal._—Not many authors seem to have\r\ndiscussed the possibility of insects as agents of seed-dispersal in the\r\nPacific. They appear to me quite suited for transporting the spores of\r\nferns and lycopods as well as the minute seeds of plants like the\r\norchids and the begonias. Darwin, who allowed few possible means of\r\ndispersal to escape his notice, procured the germination, as my readers\r\nwill remember, of grass seeds found in the dung of Natal locusts. When\r\non the barren summit of Mauna Loa, I noticed that the recently dead\r\nbodies of some butterflies, that had been carried up the slopes from the\r\nforests below by the “southerly updraught,” were already attacked by\r\nbugs, parasites that must have been transported from the lower regions\r\nby some of the numerous larger insects that are blown up the slopes.\r\n\r\nIn Note 61 the occurrence of the wind-blown insects on the summit of\r\nMauna Loa is described. That insects can be transported into the upper\r\nregions of the atmosphere by ascending air-currents was long ago\r\nremarked by Humboldt, and the subject has been discussed with his usual\r\nacumen by Whymper (_Travels amongst the Great Andes of the Equator_).\r\nCarried along in the higher air-currents these insects might finally be\r\ndeposited at places far distant from their home. One reads occasionally\r\nextraordinary accounts of a rain of insects. A very circumstantial\r\naccount was given to me when I was on Keeling Atoll of a shower of\r\ndragon-flies that fell on the islands, their remains being found in\r\nquantities in the lagoon. Dragon-flies, it is known, are often found at\r\nsea far from land, and one species has been observed nearly all over the\r\nworld, including the Pacific islands. In this connection it is\r\ninteresting to recall Mr. M’Lachlan’s remark in his article on the\r\ndragon-fly in the seventh volume of the _Encyclopædia Britannica_ that\r\nsome of the earliest fossil forms seem to have been washed ashore after\r\nhaving been drowned at sea.\r\n\r\nAnother creature that has been often ignored as a possible agent in\r\nseed-dispersal is the bat. Bats are found all over the world, including\r\nthe oceanic groups, and one can scarcely doubt that they must have often\r\ntransported seeds, at all events in their hair. They are found at times\r\nhigh up in mountainous regions, and Sir H. Johnston, in his recent work\r\non the Uganda Protectorate, refers to the occurrence of bats at an\r\naltitude of 13,000 feet. The large frugivorous bats (Pteropidæ) are\r\nknown to be very destructive feeders; but I doubt whether they swallow\r\nthe seeds. Dr. Warburg, as is remarked in Chapter XXV, says that they\r\nfeed on the flowers of Freycinetias, and I have already observed that\r\nthey visit the flowers of Geissois ternata in Fiji (p. 394). In this\r\nfashion Dr. Warburg regards them as agents in pollenisation; and it\r\nseems to me that if, as appears likely, they are attracted by trees with\r\nlarge, brightly-coloured flowers, they would often aid in the dispersal\r\nof the minute seeds of trees like Metrosideros.\r\n\r\nUntil recently sea-birds, and some particular birds of passage, have\r\nbeen generally considered as only fitted for dispersing seeds in their\r\nplumage. That they can also transport seeds inside their bodies is shown\r\nbelow. Dr. R. Brown in his book entitled _Our Earth and its Story_,\r\n1888, gives a general account of plant-dispersal with numerous\r\nreferences to the Literature on the subject. On the direct route between\r\nScotland and Cape Farewell in Greenland snow-buntings (Plectrophanes\r\nnivalis) and other birds of passage frequently alight, as we are told,\r\non ships when hundreds of miles from land. Dr. Brown says that when\r\ntaking this voyage he examined dozens of these birds. Only in one case,\r\nhowever, did he find any seeds, namely, in the case of a snow-bunting\r\nwhich carried, attached to its plumage, an achene of, perhaps, a\r\nRanunculus, and in its gizzard a seed like that of a Suæda. My discovery\r\nof a small, hard seed in the gizzard of a Cape-pigeon (Daption capensis)\r\n550 miles east of Tristan da Cunha has been referred to by Mr. Hemsley\r\nin his introduction to the _Botany of the “Challenger” Expedition_ (p.\r\n45). On p. 188 I have mentioned the probable dispersal of the seeds of\r\nCæsalpinia by frigate-birds and boobies; and in Note 59 reference is\r\nmade to some large seeds found in the crop of the Fulmar petrel.\r\n\r\nGulls, when they nest at the coast, where the sea-thrift (Armeria\r\nvulgaris) and the sea-campion (Silene maritima) thrive, or inland\r\namongst the heather-covered slopes, must often carry the seeds of these\r\nplants from place to place in their plumage (see Notes 15 and 16); but,\r\nas shown below, they can also disperse plants with fleshy fruits which\r\nat times form their food. Gulls, geese, and arctic grouse take an\r\nimportant part in the dispersal of seeds in the cold latitudes of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere; and few things are more suggestive in this way to\r\nthe student of distribution than the data supplied by Ekstam, Hesselman,\r\nSernander, and others for the region including Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla,\r\nand Arctic Norway. The history of the discussion relating to the flora\r\nand fauna of Spitzbergen reproduces in its main features the various\r\nstages in the controversy that has been waged in connection with the\r\nPacific islands.\r\n\r\nWhen Ekstam published, in 1895, the results of his observations on the\r\nplants of Nova Zembla, he observed that he possessed no data to show\r\nwhether swimming and wading birds fed on berries; and he attached all\r\nimportance to dispersal by winds. On subsequently visiting Spitzbergen\r\nhe must have been at first inclined, therefore, to the opinion of\r\nNathorst, who, having found only a solitary species of bird (a\r\nsnow-sparrow) in that region, naturally concluded that birds had been of\r\nno importance as agents in the plant-stocking. However, Ekstam’s\r\nopportunities were greater, and he tells us that in the craws of six\r\nspecimens of Lagopus hyperboreus shot in Spitzbergen in August he found\r\nrepresented almost 25 per cent. of the usual phanerogamic flora of that\r\nregion, in the form of fruits, seeds, bulbils, flower-buds, leaf-buds,\r\n&c. This observer now also realised the importance of gulls and geese in\r\ndispersing certain types of plants in those latitudes. Species of Larus,\r\nhe says, consume greedily all kinds of berries, and especially those of\r\nEmpetrum nigrum, the stones of which were found uninjured in their\r\ndroppings by Professor Lagerheim in Arctic Norway. Geese, as we are also\r\ninformed, are hearty plant-eaters in Spitzbergen; and Ekstam found in\r\ntheir droppings the fruits of Oxyria digyna as well as an abundance of\r\nuninjured bulbils of Polygonum viviparum, some of which proved to be\r\ncapable of growth (See Ekstam in _Tromso Museums Aarshefter_, vols. 18\r\nand 20, 1895-7).\r\n\r\nThe result of Ekstam’s observations in Spitzbergen was to lead him to\r\nattach a very considerable importance in plant-dispersal to the agency\r\nof birds; and when in explanation of the Scandinavian elements in the\r\nSpitzbergen flora he had to choose between a former land connection and\r\nthe agency of birds, he preferred the bird.\r\n\r\nI have gone into some detail in this matter because the Spitzbergen\r\ncontroversy in some respects might have equally centred around New\r\nZealand or some of the large continental islands of the tropical\r\nPacific. There is at first the endeavour in the absence of precise\r\nknowledge to disregard the bird and to look for a land connection. With\r\nthe increase in our acquaintance with the efficacy of bird-agency in\r\nseed distribution there is the abandonment of such a view. In both\r\nlocalities, however, there are the same counter-indications of the\r\ninsect faunas, and the same considerations are raised by the absence or\r\npresence of larger animals in the regions concerned. The principal\r\ndifference lies in the frozen sea, and yet, strangely enough, it does\r\nnot seem to affect the problem much. It would indeed appear that the\r\nquestions raised by the floras and faunas of the Pacific islands are not\r\npeculiarly Pacific in their character; and it is probable that the\r\ndifficulties here presented are repeated in one form or other in the\r\ncase of large islands over all the globe.\r\n\r\n_On the efficacy of Ducks and other Waterfowl in the Distribution of\r\nAquatic Plants._—It is highly probable that aquatic plants, like the\r\nbeach plants distributed by the currents and the ferns and lycopods\r\ndistributed mainly by the winds, have changed much less in the course of\r\nages than the plants of the inland forest. This in all three cases is\r\nchiefly due to the uninterrupted freedom of communication by means of\r\nthe dispersing agency.\r\n\r\nWild ducks and their kind are active agents in the distribution of the\r\nseeds of aquatic plants; but it is curious that the early experiments of\r\nCaspary went far to discredit them in this respect. As quoted by Dr.\r\nSchenck in his _Die Biologie der Wassergewächse_, 1886, he fed tame\r\nducks with the seeds of water-lilies and found that in a short time they\r\nthoroughly digested the seeds. Those familiar with the seeds of our\r\nBritish species of Nuphar and Nymphæa will not be surprised at such a\r\nresult; but, unfortunately, the inference drawn from this experiment has\r\nbeen by some extended to aquatic plants in general. Since the seeds or\r\nseed-vessels of some aquatic or semi-aquatic plants of the genera\r\nPotamogeton, Sparganium, &c., appeared to me to be quite fitted for\r\nconveyance without injury in a duck’s body, I made several years ago a\r\nnumber of observations on this subject, the results of which were\r\npublished in _Science Gossip_ for September, 1894.\r\n\r\nOut of 13 wild ducks obtained in the London market and stated to have\r\nbeen sent from Norfolk and Holland, eleven contained in their stomach\r\nand intestines 828 seeds, which I thus classed:—\r\n\r\n 295 seeds of Sparganium in 8 birds\r\n 41 seeds of Potamogeton in 3 birds\r\n 270 seeds of Cyperaceæ in 5 birds\r\n 222 not identified\r\n\r\nIn the case of four birds the germinating capacity of the seeds was\r\ntested, and in three cases very successfully. The seeds of Potamogeton,\r\nSparganium, and of the Cyperaceæ germinated readily in water, but few of\r\nthem failing, the process beginning in a few days or a few weeks. At\r\nthat time I was conducting an extended series of observations on the\r\npostponement of germination of the seeds of aquatic plants, the results\r\nof which were published in the _Proceedings of the Royal Physical\r\nSociety of Edinburgh_ for 1897. It was there shown that the seeds of\r\nthese plants often postpone their germination to the second and even to\r\nthe third spring. It thus happened that, whilst seeds obtained from the\r\nstomach and intestines of the wild duck germinated in a few days or\r\nweeks, I had to wait often a year and more for such a result with seeds\r\nin their ordinary condition. This was well brought out in another\r\nexperiment made on a domestic duck, which I have described on page 369.\r\nThat wild ducks are to be regarded in the light of “flying germinators”\r\nis thus very evident.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Summary._\r\n\r\n(1) In explanation of the shifting of the source of the Polynesian\r\nplants from the New to the Old World, it is suggested that during the\r\nglaciation of the northern hemisphere the Indo-Malayan plants entering\r\nthis region were “cornered” in the tropical Western Pacific, and were\r\nonly set free after the cold period had passed away, when they overran\r\nPolynesia.\r\n\r\n(2) Whilst the age of the Conifers is placed in the Mesozoic period,\r\nthat of the Compositæ is accredited to the Tertiary period, and the era\r\nof Malayan immigration followed the glacial epoch.\r\n\r\n(3) The suspension to a great extent of the agencies of plant dispersal\r\nin the Pacific in later times is connected with a general principle\r\naffecting the whole plant-world. With the secular drying up of the globe\r\nthe differentiation of climate, bird, and plant have gone on together,\r\nthe range of the bird being mainly controlled by the climate and the\r\nrange of the plant being largely dependent on the bird.\r\n\r\n(4) Accepting Hawaii as entirely insular in its history, it is pointed\r\nout that the principles deducible from the study of its flora can be\r\napplied to the forest-flora of New Zealand, with the exception of the\r\nConifers and some genera that are ancient denizens of Antarctic\r\nlatitudes, and indicate a remote continental age dating back to the\r\nMesozoic period. It is suggested that the Indo-Malayan element in its\r\nflora arrived there during the glaciation of the northern hemisphere.\r\n\r\n(5) Insects and bats have probably been effective agents in\r\nseed-dispersal in the Pacific, and it is shown that sea-birds carry\r\nseeds in their stomach and intestines as well as in their feathers.\r\n\r\n(6) It is shown that birds of the grouse family, gulls, and geese are\r\nactive seed-dispersers in cold northern latitudes, and that the\r\ndiscussion of their influence in stocking Spitzbergen with its plants\r\nreproduces many of the points of the controversy concerning the floras\r\nof the continental islands of the South Pacific.\r\n\r\n(7) The results of experiments and observations are cited to establish\r\nthe efficacy of ducks in distributing the seeds of aquatic plants, the\r\nseeds ejected in their droppings germinating in a few days or weeks,\r\nwhilst those remaining in the pond or river often do not germinate for a\r\nyear or more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n                    GENERAL ARGUMENT AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE problems concerned in the study of the floras of the Pacific islands\r\nfrom the standpoint of dispersal are here approached through the buoyant\r\nquality of the seed and fruit; and it is shown when dividing the plants\r\ninto two groups, those with buoyant and those with non-buoyant seeds or\r\nfruits, that there has been at work through the ages a great sorting\r\nprocess, by which the plants belonging to the group first named have\r\nbeen mostly gathered at the coast. Its operation may be also observed\r\nwithin the limits of a genus, where the species possessing seeds or\r\nfruits that float is stationed at the coast, whilst the species with\r\nseeds or fruits that sink makes its home inland.\r\n\r\nWhen the principle here involved is applied to the British flora, it\r\npresents itself as part of a much wider principle, by which plants\r\nendowed with buoyant seeds and fruits have been stationed at the\r\nwater-side, whether on a river-bank, or beside a lake or pond, or on a\r\nsea-beach. The broader principle proves in its turn to belong to a far\r\nlarger scheme, in which the fitness or unfitness of a plant to live in a\r\nphysiologically dry station appears as the primary determining quality,\r\nthe xerophyte (the plant of the dry station), provided with buoyant seed\r\nor fruit, finding its way to the coast, and the hygrophyte (the plant\r\ngrowing under more moist conditions), that is similarly endowed,\r\nestablishing itself by the side of the river, or the lake, or the pond.\r\n\r\nWhen dealing with the general character and composition of the\r\nstrand-plants of the tropical Pacific, it is shown that in Fiji the\r\nbeach-plants often assert their primary xerophilous habit or fitness for\r\noccupying any dry station by extending into the inland plains on the dry\r\nsides of the islands. The Fijian shore-plants are divided into three\r\nformations, those of the beach, those of the mangrove-swamp, and those\r\nof intermediate stations on the borders of the swamps. The great\r\nmajority of the Fijian shore-plants are dispersed by the currents. The\r\nTahitian Islands, which are representative of Eastern Polynesia, lack\r\nthe mangroves and most of the plants that grow at the margin of a\r\nmangrove-swamp; and their strand-flora is mainly composed of plants of\r\nthe beach, such as are dispersed by the currents far and wide in\r\ntropical regions. The Hawaiian strand-flora is very meagre in its\r\ncharacter, lacking not only the plants of the mangrove and intermediate\r\nformations, but almost all the large-fruited beach-trees of the South\r\nPacific. Since Hawaii possesses but few current-dispersed shore-plants\r\nthat are not found in the New World, reasons are given for the inference\r\nthat such shore-plants were originally brought by the currents from\r\nAmerica, and not from the South Pacific.\r\n\r\nWe are led on various grounds to the conclusion that tropical\r\nshore-plants distributed by currents belong to two great regions, the\r\nAmerican including the west coast of Africa, and the Asiatic, or Old\r\nWorld Region, which includes the African east coast. It is held that\r\nAmerica is so placed with regard to the currents, that it is a\r\ndistributor, and not a recipient of tropical shore-plants dispersed by\r\nthat agency. From this it follows that all cosmopolitan tropical\r\nbeach-plants that are dispersed by the currents have their homes in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe results of observation and experiment are given to show that there\r\nis no direct relation between the specific weight of seeds and fruits\r\nand the density of sea-water. Yet, although the floating or sinking of a\r\nseed or fruit is but an accidental attribute, it has had indirectly a\r\nfar-reaching influence not only on plant-distribution, but on\r\nplant-development. In accordance with this want of relation between the\r\nspecific weight of seeds and fruits and the density of sea-water, the\r\ngreat variety of structures concerned with buoyancy are regarded in the\r\nmain, after a detailed examination of their character, as not arising\r\nfrom adaptation. Rather, it is urged, is buoyancy connected with\r\nstructures that now serve a purpose for which they were not originally\r\ndeveloped. Nature, it is held, has never concerned herself directly with\r\nproviding means of dispersal of any sort.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion of the relation between the littoral and inland\r\nPacific floras, it is shown, as a result of the examination of those\r\ngenera possessing both shore and inland species, that they have been on\r\nthe whole developed on independent lines. Two special difficulties in\r\nexplaining the modes of dispersal of plants of the Pacific islands here\r\ncome into prominence. There is the Hawaiian difficulty, where with\r\ngenera containing both shore and inland species only the last are found\r\nin Hawaii; and although the shore-plants are known to be dispersed by\r\nthe current, the inland plants display little or no capacity for this or\r\nany other mode of dispersal. Here belong the Leguminous genera\r\nCanavalia, Erythrina, Mezoneuron, and Sophora, and the Apocynaceous\r\ngenus Ochrosia; and it is assumed that the inland Hawaiian species are\r\nderived from a current-dispersed shore-plant that has since disappeared\r\nfrom the group. The Fijian difficulty is displayed in those genera where\r\nboth coast and inland species occur in the islands, but no known\r\nexisting means of dispersal across an ocean can be postulated for the\r\ninland plants, though the shore species are distributed by the currents.\r\nOf such genera Pandanus is the best example, and it is pointed out that\r\nthis genus presents the same difficulty in the Mascarene Islands, in\r\nwhich case the agency of the extinct Columbæ is invoked.\r\n\r\nAs illustrating the methods of observation and experiment employed by\r\nthe author, the Leguminous shore-plants Afzelia bijuga, Cæsalpinia\r\nbonducella, and Entada scandens are discussed at length; and in the\r\nchapters on the enigmas of the Leguminosæ in the Pacific it is pointed\r\nout that the behaviour of the plants of this order is a source of much\r\nperplexity, and that they conform to no single rule of dispersal.\r\n\r\nComing to the inland plants of this region, the Fijian, Tahitian, and\r\nHawaiian groups are taken as the chief centres of distribution in the\r\nPacific. After discussing the relative sizes, the altitudes, and the\r\nclimates of these three archipelagoes, it is shown that Hawaii, on\r\naccount of the far greater altitude of the islands, is characterised by\r\na special mountain flora, and that it is comparable with Fiji, and to a\r\ngreat extent also with Tahiti, only as regarding the plants of the\r\nlevels below 4,000 or 5,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe first era of the plant-stocking is designated the Age of Ferns, and\r\nit is observed that, whilst in Hawaii nearly half of the ferns and\r\nlycopods are peculiar to that group, very few new species have been\r\ndeveloped in the Fijian and Tahitian regions.\r\n\r\nThe next era in the floral history of these islands is represented in\r\nthe first era of the flowering plants. This is indicated by the endemic\r\ngenera, which are particularly numerous in Hawaii, relatively scanty in\r\nFiji, and very few in Tahiti. On account of their preponderance, the era\r\nis designated the Age of Compositæ and Lobeliaceæ. The genera of these\r\ntwo orders, though mainly characteristic of Hawaii, are also to be found\r\nin the Tahitian region, but they are absent from the Fijian area.\r\nChiefly American in their affinities, their dispersion over the Pacific\r\ntook place during the Tertiary submergence of the archipelagoes of the\r\nWestern Pacific, in which are included the groups of the Fijian area\r\n(Fiji, Samoa, Tonga). These early forms of Compositæ and Lobeliaceæ are\r\noften arborescent in habit; and it is observed that Tree-Lobelias also\r\noccur high up the slopes of lofty mountains in tropical regions, as in\r\nEquatorial Africa, under conditions similar to those prevailing on the\r\nslopes of the Hawaiian mountains, where the Tree-Lobelias, termed by Dr.\r\nHillebrand “the pride of our flora,” abound.\r\n\r\nThe other Hawaiian endemic genera, marking the first chapter in the\r\nhistory of the flowering plants, arrange themselves in two groups, one\r\nchiefly American in general affinities, and containing highly\r\ndifferentiated Caryophyllaceæ, Labiatæ, &c.; the other largely Malayan,\r\nand indicating the close of the first era of the flowering plants, when\r\nthe main source of the plants was shifted from America to the Old World.\r\nThe Fijian endemic genera, which are few in number, miscellaneous in\r\nappearance, and disconnected in character, are regarded as having\r\nprobably acquired their endemic reputation through their failure at\r\ntheir sources in the regions to the west.\r\n\r\nThe second era of the flowering plants is indicated by the non-endemic\r\ngenera. Here we are concerned on the one hand with a mountainous flora\r\nmainly Hawaiian, in which genera from the New Zealand and Antarctic\r\nfloras take a conspicuous part, and on the other with a low-level flora\r\nchiefly derived from Indo-Malaya, and including the plants of the lower\r\nslopes of Hawaii below 4,000 and 5,000 feet, and the floras in mass of\r\nFiji and Tahiti.\r\n\r\nOn account of their lower altitude, the extensive mountain flora of\r\nHawaii is but scantily developed in Tahiti, and is represented by a mere\r\nremnant in Fiji and Samoa. Two-thirds of the Hawaiian non-endemic\r\nmountain genera contain only species restricted to the group, and,\r\nalthough amongst these disconnected genera, Acæna, Gunnera, Coprosma,\r\nLagenophora, &c., of the New Zealand and Antarctic floras take a\r\nprominent part, a large proportion of the genera like Ranunculus, Rubus,\r\nArtemisia, Vaccinium, and Plantago represent generally the flora of the\r\nnorth temperate zone on the summits of tropical mountains. The Tahitian\r\nmountain flora, scanty as it is when judged by the non-endemic genera,\r\ndisplays much kinship with the Hawaiian mountain flora; but this kinship\r\nis mainly confined to genera from high southern latitudes, such as\r\nCoprosma, Cyathodes, Astelia, &c. In the possession on its mountain\r\nslopes of the three genera of the Coniferæ, Dammara, Podocarpus, and\r\nDacrydium, the Fijian region is distinguished from that of Tahiti and\r\nHawaii; and it is assumed that they mark the site of a continental area\r\nin the Mesozoic period, when the Tahitian and Hawaiian groups did not\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nThe era of the non-endemic genera, in so far as it is concerned with the\r\nlow-level flora of Hawaii and the floras in mass of the areas of Fiji,\r\nSamoa and East Polynesia, is termed Malayan, because many of the genera\r\nare thence derived. Here we are dealing with all the oceanic groups of\r\nthe tropical Pacific, and not with a portion of them, as in the case of\r\nthe Age of Coniferæ, in the Secondary period, that was limited to the\r\nWestern Pacific, or in the case of the Age of Compositæ and Lobeliaceæ\r\nthat was restricted during the Tertiary epoch to the Hawaiian and\r\nTahitian regions. The first part of this era, as is indicated by the\r\nendemic species, is an age of complete isolation in Hawaii, and of\r\npartial isolation in the groups of the southern region. Amongst the\r\ngenera typical of this period are Pittosporum, Gardenia, Psychotria,\r\nCyrtandra, and Freycinetia. A later period in this era of the general\r\ndispersal of Malayan plants over the Pacific is one where the extremely\r\nvariable or polymorphous species plays a conspicuous part, as\r\nrepresented in such genera as Alphitonia, Dodonæa, Metrosideros,\r\nPisonia, and Wikstrœmia, the general principle being that each genus is\r\nat first represented by a widely ranging very variable species, which\r\nultimately ceases to wander and settles down, and becomes the parent of\r\ndifferent sets of species in the several groups.\r\n\r\nThe facts of distribution in this age of general dispersion are just\r\nsuch as we might look for in the case of a general dispersal over the\r\noceanic groups of the Pacific, with the altitudes of the islands playing\r\na determining part. But it should be remarked that the greater number of\r\nthe genera that have entered the Pacific from the Old World have not\r\nadvanced eastward of the Fijian region, half of the Fijian genera not\r\noccurring in the Hawaiian and Tahitian regions. The explanation of this\r\nis to be found, not in any lack of capacities for dispersal, but in a\r\nwant of opportunities. The story of plant-distribution in the Pacific is\r\nbound up with the successive stages of decreasing activity in the\r\ndispersing agencies. The area of active dispersion, as illustrated by\r\nthe non-endemic genera, at first comprised the whole of the tropical\r\nPacific. It was afterwards restricted to the South Pacific, and finally\r\nto the Western Pacific only. The birds that carried seeds all over this\r\nocean became more and more restricted in their ranges, probably on\r\naccount of increasing diversity of climatic conditions. The plants of\r\nnecessity responded to the ever narrowing conditions of bird-life in\r\nthis ocean, and the differentiation of the plant and the bird have taken\r\nplace together.\r\n\r\nDuring the stages of decreasing activity in the dispersing agencies, the\r\nwidely-ranging highly variable species continued to be an important\r\nfactor in the development of new species in the different groups. The\r\n_rôle_ of the polymorphous species has always been a conspicuous one in\r\nthe Pacific.\r\n\r\nYet, as in the case of the Cyrtandras, it is shown that the display of\r\ngreat formative power within a genus is not a peculiarity of an insular\r\nflora; that the isolation of an oceanic archipelago does not exclusively\r\ninduce “endemism,” but only intensifies it; that the development of new\r\nspecies may be nearly as active on a mountain in a continent as on an\r\nisland in mid-ocean; and that this is equally true of a land genus, like\r\nEmbelia, exposed to an infinite variety of conditions, and of an aquatic\r\ngenus, like Naias, where the conditions of existence are relatively\r\nuniform all the world over.\r\n\r\nIn framing a scheme by which the eras of the floral history of the\r\nPacific are brought into correlation with those of geological time, the\r\nage of the Coniferæ is placed in the Secondary period, that of the\r\nCompositæ and Lobeliaceæ in the Tertiary period, whilst the era of\r\nMalayan immigration is regarded as mainly post-glacial. The age of the\r\nConiferæ is concerned only with the Western Pacific, since the Hawaiian\r\nand Tahitian islands had not then been formed. The age of the Compositæ\r\nand Lobeliaceæ is concerned only with Hawaii and Tahiti, since the\r\nislands of the Western Pacific were then more or less submerged. That of\r\nthe Malayan plants affects the whole Pacific as at present displayed to\r\nus.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on the viviparous mangroves of Fiji it is shown that both\r\nthe Asiatic and the American species of Rhizophora (R. mucronata and R.\r\nmangle) exist in that group, and that there is in addition a seedless\r\nform, the Selala, which, although intermediate in character between the\r\ntwo other species, comes nearest to the Asiatic plant. Reasons are given\r\nfor the belief that the Selala is derived from the Asiatic species (R.\r\nmucronata), not as the result of a cross but as connected with its\r\ndimorphism; and in support of this it is pointed out that on the Ecuador\r\ncoast of South America, where only the American species exists, a\r\ndimorphism is also displayed, one of the forms approaching in several of\r\nits characters the Fijian Selala, though fruiting abundantly and bearing\r\nthe impress of a closer connection with the typical American species\r\nthan with the Asiatic plant. The view that Rhizophora mangle reached the\r\nWestern Pacific from America is rejected, and it is considered that this\r\nspecies was originally as widely diffused in the Old World as in\r\nAmerica, and that it now survives only in a few places in the tropics of\r\nthe Old World. The results of detailed observations on the modes of\r\ndispersal and on the germinating process both with Rhizophora and\r\nBruguiera are given; and the absence, as a general rule, of any period\r\nof rest between the fecundation of the ovule and the germination of the\r\nseed is established.\r\n\r\nA special chapter is devoted to the significance of vivipary, and it is\r\nconsidered that a record of the history of vivipary on the globe is\r\nafforded in the scale of germinative capacity that begins with the\r\nseedling hanging from a mangrove and ends with the seed that is detached\r\nin an immature condition from an inland plant. It is suggested that with\r\nthe drying up of the planet in the course of ages the viviparous habit,\r\nwhich was once nearly universal, has been for the most part lost except\r\nin the mangrove swamp, which to some extent represents an age when the\r\nearth was enveloped in cloud and mist and the atmosphere was saturated\r\nwith aqueous vapour. The lost habit is at times revived in the abnormal\r\nvivipary of some inland plants, and traces of it are seen in the\r\nabnormal structure of the seeds of some genera of the Myrtaceæ, like\r\nBarringtonia, and in the seeds of genera of other orders. With the\r\ndesiccation of the planet and the emergence of the continents there has\r\nbeen continual differentiation of climate resulting in seasonal\r\nvariation and in the development of the rest-period of the seed.\r\n\r\nWith the secular drying of the globe and the consequent differentiation\r\nof climate is to be connected the suspension to a great extent of the\r\nagency of birds as plant-dispersers in later ages, not only in the\r\nPacific Islands but over all the tropics. The changes of climate, bird,\r\nand plant have gone on together, the range of the bird being controlled\r\nby the climate, and the distribution of the plant being largely\r\ndependent on the bird.\r\n\r\nThe history of climate, the history of the continents and of the oceans,\r\nthe history of life itself, but only in the sense below defined, all\r\nbelong to that of a desiccating world, or rather of a planet once\r\nsunless and enveloped in mist and cloud, that through the ages has been\r\ndrying up. Life’s types were few and the sea prevailed, and one climate\r\nreigned over the globe. With the diminution of the aqueous envelopes the\r\ncontinents began to emerge, climates began to individualise, and\r\norganisms commenced to differentiate, and thus the process has run on\r\nthrough the past, ever from the general to the special both in the\r\norganic and in the inorganic world.\r\n\r\nThe same story of a world drying up is told by the marine remains left\r\nstranded far up some mountain slope, or by the bird akin to no other of\r\nits kind that Time has stranded on some island in mid-Pacific. The bird\r\ngeneralised in type that once ranged the globe is now represented over\r\nits original range by a hundred different groups of descendants,\r\nconfined each to its own locality. Climate, once so uniform, now so\r\ndiversified, has by restricting the range of the bird favoured the\r\nprocess of differentiation, and the plant dependent on the bird for its\r\ndistribution has in its turn responded to these changes.\r\n\r\nThe _rôle_ of the polymorphous species belongs alike to the plant and to\r\nthe bird. A species that covers the range of a genus varies at first in\r\nevery region and ultimately gives birth to new species in some parts of\r\nits range. Then the wide-ranging species disappears and the original\r\narea is divided up into a number of smaller areas each with its own\r\ngroup of species. Each smaller area breaks up again, and forms, yet more\r\nspecialised, are produced; and thus the process of subdivision of range\r\nand of differentiation of form goes along until each island in an\r\narchipelago owns its bird and each hill and valley has its separate\r\nplants. This is not the path that Evolution takes, since beyond lies\r\nextinction whether of plant or of bird. Such is the upshot of the\r\nprocess of differentiation exhibited in the development of species and\r\ngenera in the Pacific Islands, or, indeed, in any oceanic groups. It can\r\nnever do more than produce a Dodo or a Kiwi, or amongst the plants a\r\nTree-Lobelia.\r\n\r\nEvolution here and elsewhere is a thing apart from species and genera,\r\nwhich are but eddies on the surface of its stream. It is a scheme of\r\nlife introduced into a much conditioned world, and adaptation in endless\r\nforms is the price it has had to pay. The whole story of life on this\r\nearth is a story of a sacrifice, of an end to be won, but of a price to\r\nbe paid. Immortality is in the scheme, but death is the price of\r\nadaptation. The same theme runs through our conceptions of the spiritual\r\nlife. There is the same duality, evolution adapting its scheme to the\r\nexigencies of the physical world, the good principle ever in conflict\r\nwith the evil, and at times compelled to adapt itself to attain its\r\nends. There is the tale of adaptation in the one case and of sacrifice\r\nin the other, and success is reached in both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                APPENDIX\r\n\r\n                             LIST OF NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 1.

The details would occupy many chapters: and it is only\r\npossible here to give the bare results. Since Professor Schimper went\r\nover much the same ground in the Malayan region, one enjoys in many\r\ncases the great advantage of his authority; but a fair proportion of the\r\nresults are new; and, besides, there are a number of plants included,\r\nthe buoyancy of whose seeds or fruits has long been well established. In\r\nall cases the seed or fruit is taken as it presents itself for dispersal\r\nby the currents. Many of the plants are discussed with some detail in\r\nvarious parts of this book, as indicated in the reference column of the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nSince the Gramineæ and the Cyperaceæ contain very few species suited for\r\ndirect transport by the currents over wide areas of sea, this list may\r\nbe regarded as containing nearly all the littoral flowering plants\r\npossessing seeds or seed-vessels with any buoyancy of importance.\r\n\r\nNearly all the Tahitian strictly littoral plants are represented in\r\nFiji, and the few that have not been found there yet, such as Sesbania\r\ngrandiflora, Heliotropium anomalum, &c., may exist, as in the\r\nfirst-named species, in the neighbouring Tongan group, and may probably\r\neven exist in Fiji. Two other Tahitian littoral plants, that are widely\r\nspread in the Pacific, namely, Suriana maritima and Sesuvium\r\nPortulacastrum, are found in Tonga, and are included in my list of\r\nFijian shore plants, though not yet recorded from that group, where,\r\nhowever, they will, without a doubt, be found by some future observer.\r\n\r\n TABLE SHOWING THE BUOYANCY OF THE SEEDS OR FRUITS OF THE LITTORAL PLANTS\r\n    OF FIJI, EXCLUDING THE GRASSES AND, WITH ONE EXCEPTION, THE SEDGES\r\n\r\nThe letters placed before the plant name indicate that the species is\r\nalso found in Hawaii (H), in Tahiti (T), and in the Marquesas (M). The\r\nMarquesan locality is only given where the plant is not in Tahiti.\r\n\r\nThe abbreviations in the reference column are as follows:\r\n\r\nS=Schimper; G=Guppy; P=Earlier authorities and particularly the list\r\ngiven by Hemsley in the Introduction to the _Botany of the Challenger\r\nExpedition_.\r\n\r\n Column headings:\r\n\r\n A. Buoyancy of seeds or fruits.\r\n B. Float for months.\r\n C. Sink at once or in a week or two.\r\n D. Authorities.\r\n E. Pages of further reference.

In all the species enumerated below,\r\nthe floating powers were retained after twelve months’ immersion, the\r\nseed-contents being to all appearance unharmed. In six species I\r\nsucceeded in getting the seeds to germinate after the experiment; and\r\nthere can be no doubt that the number of successful results would have\r\nbeen largely increased, if I had not been obliged to resort to very\r\nprimitive methods in conducting the experiments. Some of the results are\r\nreferred to in a note to my paper on the flora of Keeling Atoll, dated\r\nabout 1889; and if I remember aright, Mr. Hemsley mentioned those\r\nrelating to Thespesia populnea and Ipomœa grandiflora in the _Annals of\r\nBotany_, not long after. The others have not been previously published.\r\nIn one instance (Cæsalpinia bonducella) the flotation experiment was\r\nprolonged to two and a half years, the seeds floating buoyantly and\r\nbeing apparently quite sound at the end of the experiment.\r\n\r\nAs demonstrating that tropical seeds can be transported unharmed by\r\ncurrents through cold latitudes, it should be noted that all these\r\nexperiments were conducted in England. In the cases of the Keeling Atoll\r\nseeds the experiment was carried on through a very severe winter, the\r\nvessel of sea-water being exposed to a degree of cold that kept\r\nfresh-water frozen for three weeks on the same table. This did not\r\nprevent the subsequent germination of the seeds of Thespesia populnea\r\nand Ipomœa grandiflora. The same thing was established in a more natural\r\nway by Lindman, who planted seeds of Entada scandens and Mucuna urens,\r\nthat had been stranded on the Norwegian coast, and found that they\r\nretained their germinating capacity (see Sernander, p. 7).\r\n\r\nThe following are the seeds or seed-vessels that remained afloat after a\r\nyear’s flotation in sea-water, those that subsequently germinated being\r\npreceded by G. In the other cases the germinating capacity was not\r\ntested; but they were always sound in appearance when cut across at the\r\nclose of the experiment.\r\n\r\n G Thespesia populnea (Malvaceæ)\r\n   Dioclea (violacea?)

The extension of\r\nthe principle by which plants with buoyant seeds or fruits are located,\r\nnot only at the sea-side but at the water-side generally, is here\r\ninvolved, as explained in Chapter III.\r\n\r\n(b) Plants following the rule deduced by Schimper for Terminalia, that\r\nwhen a genus comprises several species possessing buoyant fruits, only\r\nthose having fruits with the greatest floating power are found at the\r\ncoast, the least buoyant plants occurring inland; examples, Calophyllum\r\nand Guettarda.\r\n\r\n(c) Plants that like Ipomœa behave irregularly in respect to\r\nseed-buoyancy, a difference in behaviour often associated with varying\r\nstations both at the coast and inland.\r\n\r\n(d) Plants with dehiscent buoyant capsular fruits, like Sterculia, where\r\ndehiscence takes place on the tree and the seeds have no buoyancy.\r\nAlthough the unopened fruit may float a long time, it does not in that\r\ncondition come under the influence of the currents.\r\n\r\n(e) Plants like Citrus Decumana, Gardenia, sp., &c., that, although\r\napparently exceptions to the principle, do not offer much opposition to\r\nit, since the first is most at home at the river-side and the second\r\noften displays a decided inclination for a station at the coast.\r\n\r\n(f) Genuine exceptions to the principle, such as Hibiscus Abelmoschus\r\n(see page 21).\r\n\r\n\r\n                            NOTE 6 (page 15)\r\n\r\n  TABLE SHOWING THE DEGREE OF BUOYANCY OF THE SEEDS AND FRUITS OF SOME\r\n                         INLAND HAWAIIAN PLANTS\r\n\r\n (Unless otherwise stated, the seeds or fruits sink at once or in a day\r\n                                or two)\r\n\r\n Acacia Koa.\r\n Aleurites moluccana (1-2 weeks).\r\n Alyxia olivæformis.\r\n Argemone mexicana.\r\n Argyreia tiliæfolia (_nil_ or months).\r\n Bidens pilosa.\r\n Campylotheca sp.\r\n Canavalia galeata.\r\n Capparis sandwicensis.\r\n Cassia Gaudichaudii.\r\n Cassia occidentalis.\r\n Cheirodendron Gaudichaudii.\r\n Colubrina oppositifolia (weeks).\r\n Commelina nudiflora.\r\n Coprosma ernodeoides.\r\n Coprosma sp.\r\n Coprosma sp.\r\n Cyathodes Tameiameiæ (a few days).\r\n Cyrtandra sp.

The buoyancy\r\nof the seeds of Argyreia tiliæfolia and of Ipomœa bona nox varies with\r\nstation and may be explained as under Ipomœa in Note 5. The floating\r\npower of the fruits of Colubrina oppositifolia may be akin to that of\r\ninland species of Terminalia as indicated in Note 5, since another\r\nspecies of the genus C. asiatica, which is a coast plant, has very\r\nbuoyant seeds. Mucuna urens was no doubt originally, as it now is in\r\ntropical America, a littoral plant. The buoyant fruits of Pritchardia\r\nGaudichaudii offer a genuine exception to the principle (see page 330).\r\n\r\n\r\n                         NOTE 8 (pages 18, 112)\r\n\r\n                         THE PYRENES OF MORINDA\r\n\r\nThe pyrenes of the two Malayan inland species of Morinda (M. umbellata\r\nand M. longiflora) examined by Professor Schimper do not possess the\r\nbladder-like cavity to which those of M. citrifolia owe their floating\r\npower, and it is to be inferred from his remarks (p. 183) that they have\r\nlittle or no buoyancy. The pyrenes of a Fijian inland species, near M.\r\nGrayi, had no floating power as tested by me, and they lacked the\r\nbladder-like cavity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            NOTE 9 (page 18)\r\n\r\n               THE BUOYANCY OF THE FRUITS OF CALOPHYLLUM\r\n\r\nProfessor Schimper found that whilst the fruits of Calophyllum\r\ninophyllum, the shore tree, remained afloat after 126 days, those of C.\r\namœnum, an inland species, sank in from three to fourteen days, both\r\npossessing similar buoyant structures, but to a less degree in the case\r\nof the inland species. This genus presents a parallel case to Terminalia\r\nreferred to on page 17; but the general discussion of the subject will\r\nbe found in Chapter XIII. According to the above authority C. Calaba, a\r\nWest Indian coast tree, has buoyant fruits. The same is also true of the\r\nfruits of a large inland tree in the Solomon Islands experimented on by\r\nme (_Solomon Islands_, p. 305). It would thus appear that the fruits of\r\nthe genus are as a rule buoyant, and that, as in Terminalia, the least\r\nbuoyant fruits belong to the inland species. Professor Schimper also\r\nshows (p. 182) that the diminished floating power of the fruits of the\r\ninland species is associated with diminution in thickness of the buoyant\r\nseed-shell which is most developed in the buoyant fruits of the strand\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 10 (page 24)\r\n\r\n               THE BUOYANCY EXPERIMENTS ON BRITISH PLANTS\r\n\r\nThe experiments in all cases were made to test the floating power of the\r\nseed or fruit in the condition in which it is detached from the plant.\r\nIt usually makes very little difference whether sea-water or fresh water\r\nis employed, since in my numerous experiments there were but few\r\nexceptions to the general rule that seeds or seed-vessels that sink in\r\nfresh water sink also in sea-water. This subject is discussed in Chapter\r\nX. However, it may be here observed that the chief effect of the\r\nincreased density of sea-water is merely to increase the proportion of\r\nbuoyant seeds or fruits in any particular species.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary in such experiments to imitate Nature as much as\r\npossible. The seed or fruit, as the case may be, must be experimented\r\nupon in the condition in which it falls from the plant, or in the\r\ncondition in which it would be ultimately found in river and pond drift.\r\nThe seed or fruit should be thoroughly wetted, and air-bubbles removed.\r\n\r\nProlonged drying has but a slight effect on the great majority of seeds\r\nand seed-vessels experimented on, and this is just as true of tropical\r\nplants. Those that sink at once in the mature and fresh condition rarely\r\nfloat more than a day or two even after drying for a year. The usual\r\neffect is to increase the floating capacity of seeds and fruits already\r\nbuoyant, and not to develop the capacity.\r\n\r\nThe results given in the table refer only to sound seeds. In fresh-water\r\nexperiments, in nearly all cases, the seeds ultimately germinate in the\r\nwater, and this is the usual cause of the close of the experiment. In an\r\nordinary collection of floating seed drift from a pond or river,\r\ngermination will go on for years at each successive spring, the\r\npostponement of germination being a very striking feature with a fair\r\nproportion of seeds in river and pond-drift. This subject is dealt with\r\nin detail in my paper published in the _Proceedings_ for 1897 of the\r\nRoyal Physical Society of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n      THE TABLE OF RESULTS OF OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS ON THE\r\n         BUOYANCY OF THE SEEDS OR SEED-VESSELS OF MORE THAN 300\r\n                        BRITISH FLOWERING PLANTS\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION OF TABLE.—The capacity of floating for months is thus\r\nindicated, ++; of floating for 1 to 4 weeks, +; and where sinking occurs\r\nat once or within a week there is no entry.

Of these, about 260 were tested by the author, the data for\r\nthe remaining species being mainly derived from the writings of Thuret,\r\nKolpin-Ravn, and Sernander, with a few from those of Darwin and Martins.\r\n\r\nNOTE.—Whilst this work has been going through the press, the author has\r\nadded thirteen species, seven genera, and two families to the list above\r\ngiven; but the general inferences are not affected by the additions. The\r\ncorrected total would, therefore, be 333 species, 199 genera, and 67\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _On the effect of drying on the buoyancy of seeds and seed-vessels_\r\n\r\nIt has been already observed that this is as a rule but slight, and that\r\nin the great majority of cases the effect of prolonged drying for many\r\nmonths, or even for years, is at the most to give a seed or fruit\r\noriginally non-buoyant a floating power of a few days’ duration. This is\r\na subject to which I have paid especial attention in my experiments,\r\nsince, of course, much depends on it in the way of dispersal by\r\ncurrents. It is obvious that a seed or fruit possessing impermeable\r\ncoverings at the time of its separation from the parent can scarcely be\r\ncompared with one where the coverings only attain their water-proof\r\ncapacity by drying. Most gardeners know that seeds which dry easily take\r\nup moisture easily, and the principle applies in a varying degree to the\r\ngreat majority of seeds and fruits.\r\n\r\nDarwin was inclined to attach importance to adventitious buoyancy\r\nacquired by drying; and in the _Origin of Species_ he refers to\r\ninstances offered by the fruits of the Hazel (Corylus), the Asparagus,\r\nand Heliosciadium. In Note 48 I have referred to the cases of the Oak\r\nand the Hazel; and, indeed, we have only to examine the beach-drift in\r\nvarious parts of the world, and to look at their respective stations, to\r\nlearn that this is not an effective mode of dispersal. Buoyancy of seed\r\nor fruit is only one of many other qualities that is concerned with\r\ndistribution by currents. Nature does not act in this way in\r\nseed-distribution, and there can be little doubt that the author of the\r\n_Origin of Species_ would have been the first to abandon this view, if\r\nhis researches had been continued. It should be especially noted that\r\nplants of the sea-beach, where the floating power happens to be _nil_,\r\nor limited only to a week or two, would have derived great advantage\r\nfrom the drying of their seeds or fruits if it was really effective in\r\naiding dispersal by currents. However, with plants like Cakile maritima,\r\nEryngium maritimum, Glaucium luteum, &c., the effect of drying is very\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 11 (page 25)\r\n\r\n THE EFFECT OF SEA-WATER IMMERSION ON THE GERMINATING CAPACITY OF SEEDS\r\n                            AND SEED-VESSELS\r\n\r\nBerkeley, Darwin, Martins, and others, long ago established the capacity\r\nof seeds to germinate after prolonged immersion in sea-water. The reader\r\nwill find a _resumé_ of their results in the appendix to Mr Hemsley’s\r\nvolume on the _Botany of the Challenger Expedition_. The subject is well\r\nillustrated in the original papers of those authors, and in my later\r\npapers on the flora of Keeling Atoll, and on the seed-drift of the\r\nThames.\r\n\r\nI may here remark that the earlier observers often pay more attention to\r\nthe retention of the germinating capacity after sea-water immersion than\r\nto the degree of buoyancy. For this reason I have not been able to make\r\ngreat use of the buoyancy results of Martins, since he frequently does\r\nnot distinguish between temporary and long-sustained buoyancy, an\r\nobjection also pointed out by Thuret and Hemsley.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 12 (page 27)\r\n\r\n              THE BUOYANCY OF THE FRUITS OF GALIUM APARINE\r\n\r\nNorman and Sernander (see p. 172) attribute considerable buoyancy to\r\nthese fruits on account of the hollow cavity in each. I used to find\r\nthem in England in floating river-drift in autumn; and Norman observed\r\nthem on the Scandinavian beaches. They do not, however, float long, as\r\nthe cavity is open; and in two sets of my experiments they sank within a\r\nfew days.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 13 (page 29)\r\n\r\n            THE BUOYANCY OF THE SEEDS OF CONVOLVULUS SEPIUM\r\n\r\nThis plant seeded freely in 1893 in the Lower Thames Valley, as at\r\nMolesey. I kept some of the seeds afloat for thirty-three months, of\r\nwhich the first nine months were spent in sea-water and the rest in\r\nfresh-water. One seed, at the end of the period, germinated healthily in\r\nthe fresh-water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 14 (page 26)\r\n\r\n                    OTHER LONG FLOTATION EXPERIMENTS\r\n\r\nWhilst keeping my collections of Thames seed-drift in water from year to\r\nyear, I obtained a number of records of long “flotations.” Thus in\r\nseveral cases, as with Bidens cernua and different species of Carex,\r\ngermination of the floating fruit took place in the water after a period\r\nof two years. The same is also true of the seeds of Iris pseudacorus and\r\nof the drupes of Sparganium ramosum. The last-named remained afloat in\r\nthe vessels, with the seed still sound, after four years; and the fruits\r\nof Carex paludosa germinated afloat after three years in water. Many\r\ndrift fruits and seeds did not germinate freely in the vessels until the\r\nsecond spring, that is, after a lapse of eighteen months; and in those\r\ncases where the experiments were still further prolonged, a few\r\ngerminated in the vessels in the third and sometimes even in the fourth\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        NOTE 15 (pages 33, 280)\r\n\r\n                THE OCCURRENCE INLAND OF SILENE MARITIMA\r\n\r\nProf. Schimper appeared to be in doubt as to the inclusion of this\r\nlittoral plant amongst those found in elevated mountain districts.\r\nHowever, an interesting note on the occurrence of this plant on the\r\nsummit of one of the inland Norwegian mountains is given by Sernander\r\n(p. 405), and is referred to by me on page 280 of this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 16 (page 34)\r\n\r\n  THE BUOYANCY OF THE SEEDS OR FRUITS OF THE BRITISH BEACH-PLANTS THAT\r\n                           ALSO OCCUR INLAND\r\n\r\nMy experiments in the case of Armeria vulgaris, Artemisia, Cochlearia\r\nofficinalis, Plantago, the maritime forms of Spergularia rubra with and\r\nwithout winged seeds, and Silene maritima disclose little or no floating\r\ncapacity even after prolonged drying. Thuret obtained similar results\r\nfor the Spergularia. It is unlikely that other plants of the group\r\npossess any floating power worth speaking of. As indicated in Note 71,\r\nthe fruits of Raphanus maritimus float only for 7 to 10 days.\r\n\r\nNature disperses the fruits of Armeria vulgaris inclosed in the\r\npersistent calyx; but in this condition they float only for 2 to 4 days\r\nin sea-water, and the buoyancy of the capsule and seed is still more\r\nlimited. They are sufficiently light to be blown some distance by strong\r\nwinds, and the stiff hairs would cause them to adhere to a bird’s\r\nplumage in the case of gulls nesting where the plants grow.\r\n\r\nReference to Matricaria inodora is made under Note 18.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 17 (page 35)\r\n\r\n  THE BUOYANCY OF THE SEEDS OR FRUITS OF THE GROUP OF BRITISH LITTORAL\r\n           PLANTS THAT FREQUENT SALT MARSHES AND MUDDY SHORES\r\n\r\n_Aster tripolium._ The achenes, with or without the pappus, sink in\r\nfresh and salt water in a day or two even after a year’s drying.\r\n\r\n _Glaux maritima_    }\r\n _Plantago maritima_ } The small seeds, or the seed-like nucules as\r\n _Samolus valerandi_ } in Suæda, have but little floating power\r\n _Suæda fruticosa_   } even after prolonged drying.\r\n _Suæda maritima_    }\r\n\r\n_Salicornia herbacea._ Would be dispersed probably by floating portions\r\nof the plant, which, however, soon break down and the liberated seeds\r\nsink. The floating seedling thrives in sea-water and could be carried\r\ngreat distances (see Note 19).\r\n\r\n_Salsola kali._ I experimented on this plant, both on the coast of\r\nDevonshire and in Chile, with the same results in both localities\r\nwhether in the fresh state or after drying for weeks. The fruit sinks,\r\nbut when the plant dries the fruit is often detached inclosed in the\r\nperianth, and floats in that condition in sea-water for a few days.\r\nPortions of the plant of various sizes bearing mature fruits all sank\r\nwithin ten days. It would seem at first sight, from the observations of\r\nProf. Martins, that the fruits float for several weeks; but his\r\nexperiments were mainly directed to testing the powers of germination\r\nafter sea-water _immersion_; and it is often not at all clear whether\r\n_flotation_ is implied or even to be correctly inferred. There is a\r\nslight suspicion of germination on the plant. Sea-birds doubtless aid in\r\nthe dispersion of this plant; the dry crisp portions of the plant\r\ncarrying fruits catch readily in one’s clothes on account of the\r\nprickly-pointed leaves.\r\n\r\n_Scirpus maritimus._ The fresh fruits float a few weeks in sea-water in\r\nmost cases, but 10 per cent. remain afloat after two months. After\r\ndrying for some months 30 per cent. remain floating after two months’\r\nimmersion.\r\n\r\n                        } The fruits float a few days or a week. Drying\r\n _Triglochin maritimum_ } somewhat increases the buoyancy. Sir W.\r\n _Triglochin palustre_  } Buller in New Zealand found in the gullet\r\n                        } of Anas superciliosa, the Grey Duck, numbers\r\n                        } of the fruits of Triglochin triandrum.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 18 (page 35)\r\n\r\nTHE BUOYANCY OF THE SEEDS OR FRUITS OF THE BRITISH LITTORAL PLANTS THAT\r\n                       ARE CONFINED TO THE BEACH\r\n\r\n_Arenaria (Honckeneya) peploides._ The seeds float for many months in\r\nsea-water unharmed, 75 per cent. floating after a year. They never\r\ngerminate in sea-water; but on being transferred to fresh water after\r\nmany months in sea-water they germinate healthily in a few days. These\r\nseeds only float a few days in fresh water, all sinking within 10 days,\r\nand even after a year’s drying they sink in a week or two. Precisely the\r\nsame results were produced in my experiments in 1892 on Cornish seeds,\r\nand in 1904 on Devonshire seeds. In the great contrast between their\r\nfloating capacity in sea-water and in fresh water the seeds of this\r\nplant defy the general rule that seeds that float a long time in\r\nsea-water float also a long time in fresh-water. According also to\r\nSernander the seeds float a long time in the sea. He says that the\r\ncapsules float, but since they ultimately dehisce this could scarcely be\r\nefficacious in dispersal. Floating portions of the plant also aid in its\r\ndispersal, according to the same authority (p. 174). The plant forms\r\ngreat extended masses on the pebbly shores of Spitzbergen (Ekstam, p.\r\n28).\r\n\r\n_Beta maritima._ Thuret found that the dried fruits of this plant\r\nfloated only two or three days in sea-water; whilst in my sea-water\r\nexperiments the freshly gathered fruits floated only one or two days.\r\nSernander speaks of them as fitted for dispersal from shore to shore;\r\nbut this could only be to a limited extent. Martins and Thuret\r\nestablished by experiment the capacity of the germination of seeds of\r\nother species of Beta after long immersion in sea-water; and the first\r\nseems to imply that those of Beta vulgaris float for many weeks; but I\r\nam inclined to think an error lies here.\r\n\r\n_Cakile maritima._ The fruits, even after long drying, float, as a rule,\r\nonly a week and sink within ten days, the same results being afforded in\r\nmy sea-water experiments in 1893 on fruits from Cornwall, and in 1904 on\r\nfruits from Devonshire. The fruits are common in the stranded drift on\r\nthe north coast of Devonshire and may often be seen germinating there.\r\nThey are also frequent in the beach drift of the Scandinavian coasts\r\n(Sernander, p. 156).\r\n\r\n_Crambe maritima._ The fruits were kept floating by Sernander more than\r\n13 days (p. 165). Martins implies that they floated for 45 days. Darwin\r\nsays that they germinated after 37 days’ immersion in sea-water, but\r\ndoes not specify that they floated all the time.\r\n\r\n_Crithmum maritimum._ The ripe fruits readily separate into the two\r\ncarpels, which are very buoyant and float in sea-water for months. In my\r\nexperiments, 95 per cent. remained afloat after 10 months. It is\r\nremarkable that whilst in sea-water the spongy covering of the carpels\r\nretains its vitality, in fresh-water it becomes sickly and decays and\r\nthe carpels lose their floating power, so that they float weeks instead\r\nof months as in the sea-water. The carpels are extremely light, being\r\nwashed up in the spray and blown up by the wind amongst the lightest of\r\nthe stranded drift of the Devonshire beaches. In a moderate gale they\r\nare often blown off the beach and up the cliff-faces.\r\n\r\n_Convolvulus soldanella._ From 40 to 50 per cent. of the seeds float\r\nafter six months in sea-water, and about 30 per cent. float after\r\neighteen months, retaining up to the end their germinating capacity.\r\nSernander implies that the plant is not found on the Scandinavian coast\r\nto the north of Nissum Fjord in Denmark. It is known, however, to occur\r\nin the south of Scotland. (I am indebted to Mr. Millett for his\r\nextremely kind assistance in experimenting on this plant about ten years\r\nsince.)\r\n\r\n_Eryngium maritimum._ The fruits float in sea-water, as a rule, only 3\r\nor 4 days and all sink within a week. After drying for three months, the\r\nfloating period is only increased by a day or two. Though not at all\r\nsuited for transport for any distance by the currents, the carpels, on\r\naccount of their long prickly calyx teeth, would readily become\r\nentangled in a bird’s plumage, and doubtless they are dispersed usually\r\nin that fashion.\r\n\r\n_Euphorbia paralias._ The seeds float a long time unharmed in the sea.\r\nIn my experiments at least 90 per cent. remained afloat after six weeks\r\nin sea-water. On account of their small size they are liable to be\r\noverlooked in beach drift; but they are to be found stranded on the\r\nsands of our southern coasts, and they came under my notice in abundance\r\nin the seed-drift of the Sicilian beaches.\r\n\r\n_Glaucium luteum._—The seeds have no proper buoyancy even after\r\nprolonged drying. On account of their oiliness they will float at first\r\non still water; but they can be made to sink at once or in a day by\r\ndropping water upon them. The mode of dispersal is problematical.\r\n\r\n_Lathyrus maritimus._—The seeds are evidently able to float a long time.\r\nThey were, according to Sernander (p. 178), found in quantities by J.\r\nSchmidt cast up on some sand-islets near Falster in Denmark; and the\r\nplant is regarded by Norman as distributed over the coasts of Arctic\r\nNorway through the agency of the currents. They have, as observed by\r\nSchmidt, considerable floating powers. Some small leguminous seeds,\r\nseemingly of this species, which I found in the beach drift of\r\nWoollacombe Sands, Devonshire, floated uninjured for many weeks in\r\nsea-water.\r\n\r\n_Matricaria maritima,_ maritime variety of M. inodora. The fruits\r\nfloated in my experiments unharmed after eight months in sea-water. In\r\nan experiment made some years since on the fruits of the inland form I\r\nnoted that they had little or no buoyancy; but it is necessary to repeat\r\nthe observation. Sernander (p. 181) supports Norman’s view that these\r\nplants are spread by the currents in Arctic Norway. The fruits occur in\r\nthe Baltic sea-drift and also in fresh-water drift. M. inodora is found\r\non sandy beaches in Nova Zembla. I am inclined to regard the maritime\r\nform from the dispersal standpoint as a distinct species.\r\n\r\n_Polygonum maritimum._—I have made observations on this plant in\r\nDevonshire, the Lipari Islands, and the coast of Chile. As in the case\r\nof several other species of Polygonum tested by me the fruits have\r\nlittle or no buoyancy, but inclosed in the perianth they float three or\r\nfour days. The entire plant floats; but portions placed in sea-water\r\nsank within five or six days. Shore-birds can alone explain the wide\r\ndistribution of this species.\r\n\r\nThe structural characters of some of these fruits or seeds are in their\r\nrelation to buoyancy discussed on page 115. It may be here observed that\r\nthe valuable results obtained by Prof. Martins in testing the\r\ngerminating capacity of the fruits and seeds of several of the\r\nshore-plants above mentioned, after long immersion in sea-water, are at\r\ntimes not to be depended on for the flotation indications, the\r\npersistence of the seed’s vitality being the special purpose of his\r\nresearch. His negative results as regards germination are not, however,\r\nalways conclusive, since the period employed from April to June was\r\nquite insufficient. In many of my experiments seeds after long flotation\r\nin sea-water did not germinate for a year or more afterwards. If his\r\ninvestigation had been extended, the opinion that the Ranunculaceæ, the\r\nMalvaceæ, and the Convolvulaceæ are apparently least able to resist the\r\naction of sea-water would never have been formed. A very large amount of\r\nevidence now shows that most seeds or fruits that are at all well\r\nprotected will germinate after long immersion in sea-water. But all\r\nexperiments must be well safeguarded and extended over a year or two.\r\nThe necessity of this was long since shown by Thuret. By employing\r\ndouble sets of seeds he ascertained that in a third of the species\r\ngermination failed not only in the case of the seeds immersed in\r\nsea-water, but also in those that had not been placed in sea-water at\r\nall. Future investigators may, however, regard the buoyant qualities of\r\nseeds or fruits with their associated structural characters as offering\r\nnow the true line of research. Observers beginning with Berkeley and\r\nDarwin down to the present time have quite established the fact that\r\nseeds as a rule germinate freely after long sea-water immersion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 19 (page 35)\r\n\r\n                      ON GERMINATION IN SEA-WATER\r\n\r\nDuring my experiments on the buoyancy of about 270 British plants, about\r\na fourth of them (including most of those with buoyant seeds or fruits)\r\nwere subjected to prolonged immersion in sea-water from periods varying\r\nfrom six to thirty-three months. If we except plants like Aster\r\ntripolium, Salicornia herbacea, Triglochin maritimum, &c., that live\r\nnormally in salt marshes, or on the muddy banks of estuaries, only one\r\nof the whole number, namely, Ranunculus sceleratus, displayed the\r\ncapacity of germination in sea-water. Amongst the plants that failed may\r\nbe mentioned the following that are confined to the sea-beach—Arenaria\r\npeploides, Cakile maritima, Convolvulus soldanella, Eryngium maritimum,\r\nEuphorbia paralias, Glaucium luteum, and we may here include Crithmum\r\nmaritimum of the rocky coasts. Of the beach-plants that also grow\r\ninland, Silene maritima and Spergularia rubra (excepting the form found\r\non muddy coast flats) likewise failed. Amongst the plants of\r\nmiscellaneous inland stations that failed were Atriplex patula, Bidens\r\ncernua, B. tripartita, Calla palustris, several species of Carex both\r\nfrom dry and wet situations, Convolvulus arvensis, C. sepium,\r\nHydrocotyle vulgaris, Iris pseudacorus, several species of Juncus,\r\nLycopus europæus, Mentha aquatica, Ranunculus repens, Rhinanthus crista\r\ngalli, several species of Rumex, Scutellaria galericulata, Sparganium\r\nramosum, &c.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all the plants that failed to germinate in sea-water the\r\ncapacity of readily germinating in fresh water was displayed. The\r\nrestraining power of immersion in sea-water was illustrated over and\r\nover again in my experiments. During the course of an experiment seeds\r\nremoved from the sea-water vessel and placed directly in a vessel of\r\nfresh water kept beside the other germinated in a few days, whilst those\r\nleft in the sea-water never germinated, though often kept there for\r\nmonths after. It was also noticeable that a previous sea-water immersion\r\nfavoured early germination in fresh water. It may be added that most of\r\nthe experiments were on floating seeds and seedvessels, though\r\ngermination also occurred in the sunken state.\r\n\r\nIt was ascertained in the exceptional case of Ranunculus sceleratus,\r\nthat although germination took place in sea-water, it was only after a\r\nprolonged soaking of months had prepared the way. Of a number of its\r\nseed-like fruits placed in fresh water and in sea-water in April and\r\nkept under the same conditions, those in fresh water germinated freely\r\nin a week or two, whilst those in sea-water did not begin to germinate\r\nuntil the following October. Whilst the floating seedlings produced by\r\ngermination in fresh water grew vigorously and developed roots, those\r\nresulting from germination in sea-water and left in the vessel only\r\nattained a length of four millimetres in two months, developed no roots,\r\nand showed only the first leaf. The sea-water seedlings were pale green,\r\nand in their stout fleshy appearance contrasted greatly with the slender\r\nfresh-water seedlings.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the germination in sea-water of the plants of the salt\r\nmarsh and of the mud-flats of estuaries, the following observations may\r\nbe made. With Aster tripolium the seeds germinate readily in sea-water\r\neven when its density is raised by evaporation to 1·040; and I think\r\nthat by a carefully graduated series of experiments they could be\r\ninduced to germinate in brine. The seeds of Salicornia herbacea\r\ngerminate in sea-water more readily than in fresh water; and the\r\nsea-water seedling is much the more vigorous and healthy of the two. I\r\nkept the floating seedlings in sea-water for about ten weeks from the\r\ndate of germination, when they had developed the second joint and were\r\nthrowing out rootlets. After that, unless placed in salt-mud, they\r\nbecame sickly and died. The floating seedling can evidently disperse the\r\nspecies. I found with Spergularia marina, the maritime form of S. rubra,\r\nthat seeds of the plants growing on a sandy beach did not germinate in\r\nsea-water, only those from plants growing on muddy coast-flats doing so.\r\nBut the sea-water seedlings, unlike those of Salicornia herbacea, but\r\nlike those of Ranunculus sceleratus, when left in sea-water did not\r\nthrive. The seeds of Triglochin maritimum, as well as those of T.\r\npalustre, behave very similarly in sea-water, germinating readily, the\r\nliberated seedlings thriving afloat and producing the plumule. The\r\nultimate test of the capacity for germinating in sea-water seems to lie\r\nin the behaviour of the seedling when left in the sea-water. Unless it\r\nbelongs to a characteristic plant of the salt marsh or of the estuary,\r\nlike Salicornia, it makes but little attempt at growth whilst afloat in\r\nsea-water, showing no rootlets, though at times developing the plumule.\r\n\r\nThe germination of seeds in sea-water also attracted the notice of\r\nDarwin; but his results in some respects are scarcely those I should\r\nhave looked for (_Gardener’s Chronicle_, May, 1855, and _Journ. Linn.\r\nSoc._, vol. i., p. 130, 1857). Out of the seeds of 87 plants placed in\r\nsea-water to test their capacity of germination when afterwards planted,\r\nin three cases, those of Tussilago farfara, Convolvulus tricolor, and\r\nthe garden Orache (Atriplex), the seeds germinated under the water, the\r\nfreed seedlings, as with the two first named plants, living in the\r\nsea-water for some time after. Darwin was evidently himself surprised at\r\nthese results, and I am quite unable to understand them. In England and\r\nin the tropics I have carried on prolonged sea-water experiments on the\r\nseeds of at least fifteen species of Convolvulus and Ipomœa (including\r\nthe beach plants C. soldanella and I. pes capræ) and have never obtained\r\nsuch a result. The seeds will nearly always germinate well in fresh\r\nwater; but in sea-water the process begins, as indicated by the swollen\r\nseed, and then aborts, the embryo dying (see page 83). The seeds of\r\nAtriplex patula, though a long time in sea-water in my experiments, made\r\nno attempt to germinate there. Neither Prof. Martins, who experimented\r\nupon the effects of sea-water immersion on the seeds of nearly 100\r\nplants, including many coast species, nor M. Thuret, who experimented in\r\nsea-water on the seeds of 251 plants, the experiments being in some\r\ncases prolonged for more than a year, make any reference, as far as I\r\ncould gather from their writings, to any cases of germination in\r\nsea-water. Darwin’s results, however, are always significant in matters\r\nof dispersal; and perhaps one of my readers will be able to experiment\r\nagain on his three plants.\r\n\r\nWhen in Hawaii, I made some observations on the germination of Batis\r\nmaritima in sea-water, a plan with which I was also familiar in its home\r\nin the salt-water pools of the coast of Peru. The mature fruits, on\r\nbeing freed from the parent plant in sea-water, float away, and in from\r\none to two weeks they break down from decay, setting free the seeds. The\r\nseeds float in sea-water indefinitely, their buoyancy only terminating\r\nwith their germination, the first seeds germinating afloat about six\r\nweeks after the breaking down of the fruit, whilst the rest continue to\r\nfloat in the sea-water during the next three months, some of them\r\ngerminating at intervals, and all of them doing so eventually. Strange\r\nto say, although the seedlings remained healthy whilst afloat in the\r\nsea-water, they made no effort either to separate the cotyledons or to\r\nproduce a plumule.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 20 (page 42).\r\n\r\n ON THE MAXIMUM HEIGHTS REACHED BY SOME SHORE PLANTS IN THEIR EXTENSION\r\n                       INLAND IN VANUA LEVU, FIJI\r\n\r\nSince they occupy the “talasinga” districts described in the following\r\nnote, these shore plants would be expected to extend as high as those\r\ndistricts extend, namely, to about 1,500 feet above the sea. This indeed\r\nrepresents their limit excepting in one instance; but many fall\r\nconsiderably short of this elevation.\r\n\r\n _Canavalia obtusifolia_, variety, 700 feet, rare.\r\n _Cassytha filiformis_, 950 feet.\r\n _Cerbera Odollam_, 1,200 feet: 2,600 feet in one exceptional case on\r\n the slopes of Mbatini.\r\n _Colubrina asiatica_, 400 feet.\r\n _Cycas circinalis_, 1,100 feet.\r\n _Derris uliginosa_, 1,000 feet, rare.\r\n _Ipomœa pes capræ_, 1,300 feet.\r\n _Morinda citrifolia_, 700 feet.\r\n _Scævola Kœnigii_, not common inland, and rarely over 100 feet above\r\n the sea; but it may occur miles from the beach, as near Vatu Levoni,\r\n where a few stunted plants were growing five miles from the coast.\r\n _Vitex trifolia_, 1,300 feet, usually more or less unifoliolate and\r\n procumbent.\r\n\r\nUnless otherwise stated all the plants above named are common inland, as\r\nalso are _Premna tahitensis_, _Tacca pinnatifida_, _Tephrosia\r\npiscatoria_, _Hibiscus tiliaceus_, &c.; but I have made no note of\r\n_Thespesia populnea_ occurring far off the beach.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         NOTE 21 (pages 42, 43)\r\n\r\n     ON THE DWARFING OF SHORE PLANTS WHEN EXTENDING INLAND INTO THE\r\n                   “TALASINGA” PLAINS IN VANUA LEVU.\r\n\r\n_Premna tahitensis_, 9 or 10 feet high at the coast, may here be only 3\r\nfeet high. Other trees like _Morinda citrifolia_ become also stunted.\r\n_Cerbera Odollam_, a moderate-sized tree at the coast, may in the\r\n“talasinga” plains be only 4 to 6 feet high, but it here displays\r\ndistinct varietal characters. Whilst the shore trees of Cerbera Odollam\r\nhave broad leaves (length 3 times the breadth) with obtuse points, and\r\nshort, stout flower-peduncles (1-1/2 - 2 inches), the inland or\r\n“talasinga” species has long lanceolate leaves (length 7 or 8 times the\r\nbreadth), and long, slender flower peduncles (3 inches). However,\r\nintermediate forms are common, the broad-leaved coast tree approaching\r\nthe inland plant and _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 22 (page 43)\r\n\r\n               THE “TALASINGA” PLAINS OF VANUA LEVU, FIJI\r\n\r\nAmongst the most conspicuous features of the north and north-west or lee\r\nsides of the large islands of Vanua Levu and Viti Levu are the extensive\r\nrolling plains that extend from the sea-border for some miles inland to\r\nthe foot of the mountains. It is to those of the first-named island that\r\nthe following remarks strictly apply; but no doubt they will serve\r\nequally well for those of the other island. In the first volume on the\r\ngeology of Vanua Levu, reference is frequently made to this subject, and\r\nthe reader may profitably look at the remarks there made.\r\n\r\nHere the mountain-forests more or less abruptly cease, and we have an\r\nundulating region of grass, reeds, and ferns dotted over with\r\nCasuarinas, Pandanus trees, Cycads, Acacias, and shrubby growths. Though\r\nthe list of plants characteristic of these plains is not small, they are\r\nnot, as a rule, numerous in any one locality, and the general appearance\r\nis one of aridity. A dry, crumbling soil, often deeply stained by\r\niron-oxide, is plentifully exposed; and blocks of basic volcanic rocks\r\nin all stages of disintegration are strewn over the surface in many\r\nlocalities. Rivers, fed by the heavy rainfall of the forested slopes of\r\nthe mountains, traverse these regions, but, as a rule, receive no\r\ntributaries; and the districts have, in fact, well earned the name given\r\nto them by the natives of the “talasinga,” or sun-burnt, lands.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation, though sparse and scanty in comparison with that of the\r\nforests, is sufficiently varied when it comes to be more closely\r\nexamined. In one locality we may have extensive tracts covered with\r\nGleichenia, Pteris, and other ferns of the bracken habit. In another,\r\ntall reeds (Eulalia) and grasses cover large areas. Here, more than one\r\nspecies of Tacca (T. pinnatifida and T. maculata) thrive. There, the\r\nTurmeric (Curcuma longa) abounds. Trailing over the soil in one place we\r\nnotice Ipomœa pes capræ, in another the Yaka (Pachyrrhizus trilobus),\r\nand in another the procumbent unifoliolate form of Vitex trifolia.\r\nAmongst the shrubs and small trees we observe in different localities\r\nthe Sama (Commersonia echinata), the Mbulei (Alstonia plumosa—one of the\r\nrubber plants), Mussænda frondosa, Melastoma denticulatum, and Nelitris\r\nvitiensis, the Nunga-nunga. Dodonæa viscosa, found in similar regions in\r\nAustralia and New Zealand, abounds in places; and here and there may be\r\nseen species of Hibbertia, another Australian genus. Fagræa Berteriana,\r\nthe Mbua tree, grows abundantly in certain districts, as in the Mbua\r\nplains, and Gardenias are at times abundant. One or two characteristic\r\nbeach-plants have been already mentioned, and amongst others\r\nparticularly frequent in these plains are Cassytha filiformis, Cerbera\r\nOdollam, Morinda citrifolia, and Premna tahitensis.\r\n\r\nWhen these talasinga districts approach the forests, patches of wood\r\noccur at intervals, and we observe here the Candle-nut Tree (Aleurites\r\nmoluccana), the Vunga (Metrosideros polymorpha), and the Thau-kuro\r\n(Casuarina nodiflora). Such are some of the botanical features of these\r\ndistricts; but the reader will acquire a sufficiently correct general\r\nnotion of the floral physiognomy of these regions if he bears in mind\r\ntheir most conspicuous characters, those of an undulating region more or\r\nless covered with ferns, tall reeds, and grass, and dotted over, either\r\nseparately or in clumps, with Casuarinas (C. equisetifolia), Screw-pines\r\n(Pandanus odoratissimus), Cycads (C. circinalis), and Acacias (A.\r\nRichii, &c.).\r\n\r\nHowever, the peculiar vegetation of these plains often ascends the lower\r\nslopes of the mountains, reaching to various elevations. In Vanua Levu\r\nit often ceases at 900 or 1,000 feet, but it may only reach to 400 or\r\n500 feet, and, on the other hand, not uncommonly it ascends to as much\r\nas 1,500 feet, the greatest elevation recorded by me being 1,600-1,700\r\nfeet in the Sealevu district. It extends miles inland, and where\r\nconditions are suitable it may reach the heart of the island.\r\n\r\nDifferent explanations have been offered of the origin of the peculiar\r\nvegetation of the leeward slopes of these islands. It is, however, a\r\nphenomenon that is presented over much of the globe by islands lying in\r\nthe track of regular winds, the weather, or wet, side being densely\r\nwooded, whilst the lee, or dry, side is covered with grass, ferns, and\r\nsimilar vegetation. The predisposing cause must be climatic; and\r\nalthough Mr. Horne’s explanation attributing it to the effect of fires\r\nand to a faulty system of native cultivation (pp. 80, 132) may be\r\ndoubtless true in certain localities, the influences at work here must\r\nbe the same as are at work in other islands and on continental coasts in\r\nother parts of the world.\r\n\r\nBut for all that it is not easy to give a definite explanation even from\r\na meteorological standpoint. Those who are interested in this subject\r\nwill recall the desert districts of Australia and the dreary sandy\r\nwastes of the coast of Northern Chile and Peru; and they will be\r\ncautious in venturing on a definite explanation even with such\r\nrelatively unimportant examples of the same principle as are exhibited\r\nby the islands of Fiji. Dr. Seemann, writing of these “talasinga” plains\r\n(p. xii), remarks that “their very aspect is proof that rain falls in\r\nonly limited quantity,” the mountainous backbone of the islands\r\nintercepting, as he holds, much of the rainfall. But the subsequent\r\nobservations of Mr. Holmes, at Delanasau, in the “talasinga” district on\r\nthe north-west side of Vanua Levu, have shown that there is by no means\r\na small rainfall in this locality, the average rainfall, for instance,\r\nfor the seven years ending December, 1877, being 113 inches, which must\r\nbe quite two-thirds or three-fourths of the fall on the weather side of\r\nthe island (see p. 215); whilst the average number of days on which rain\r\nfell was 156. The true cause would seem to lie in the excessive dryness\r\nof the air on the lee side of the islands between the rains, and the\r\nwhole matter may, perhaps, be one rather for the hygrometer than for the\r\nrain-gauge. I have no comparative data bearing on this point; but Mr.\r\nHolmes, whose observations as here quoted are from Horne’s _Year in\r\nFiji_, found that the mean relative humidity for 1875 at 1 P.M. was 63,\r\nwhich is certainly very low for the tropics. I may remark that, as far\r\nas personal experience goes, the climate on the lee side of Vanua Levu\r\nis much more enervating, much less healthy, and the air is far more\r\n“drying” than on the side exposed to the trade-wind.\r\n\r\nGeological characters, as I found, explained nothing in this connection,\r\nthe “talasinga” vegetation sometimes occurring on basaltic areas, at\r\nother times on the “soapstone” or calcareous mud-stone, and again on\r\ncoarser tufaceous rocks. In my volume on the geology of Vanua Levu (p.\r\n57), it is pointed out that the extensive disintegration of the basaltic\r\nrocks, that are exposed on these plains in places, affords evidence of\r\nthe great antiquity of these “talasinga” districts in their present\r\nunforested condition. The extent to which these rocks have weathered\r\ndownward is remarkable. In some places they are decomposed to a depth of\r\nten feet and more. The same inference is to be drawn from the occurrence\r\nof fragments of limonite, or bog-iron ore, over these plains, marking as\r\nthey do original swampy tracts that, with a few exceptions, have long\r\nsince disappeared. Such deposits indicate that these plains have been\r\nfor ages in the same condition. ... It may be added that, according to\r\nMr. Lister and Mr. Crosby, the features of the “talasinga” plains occur\r\nin the Tongan Group on the leeward sides of the islands of Eua and\r\nVavau.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 23 (page 43)\r\n\r\n          SCHIMPER’S GROUPING OF THE INDO-MALAYAN STRAND-FLORA\r\n\r\nIt is divided into four formations—the Mangrove, the Nipa, the\r\nBarringtonia, and the Pes-capræ. The two last make up my\r\nBeach-formation, the Barringtonia formation comprising the trees,\r\nshrubs, &c., immediately lining the beach, and the Pes capræ including\r\nthe creepers and bushes of the beach itself. In the Pacific islands it\r\nis not always easy to preserve this distinction. The Nipa formation\r\ncorresponds in some respects with my Intermediate or Transition\r\nformation, lying as it does between the mangrove-belts and the woods of\r\nthe interior; but the swamp-palm (Nipa fruticans) that forms it in the\r\nmass is not found in Fiji or, indeed, in the Pacific islands, excepting\r\nthe Solomon and Caroline Groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 24 (page 44)\r\n\r\n  GROUPING OF SOME OF THE CHARACTERISTIC PLANTS OF THE STRAND-FLORA OF\r\n                                  FIJI\r\n\r\n(a) _Beach-formation._—Calophyllum inophyllum, Thespesia populnea,\r\nTriumfetta procumbens, Carapa moluccensis, Canavalia obtusifolia, Vigna\r\nlutea, Pongamia glabra, Sophora tomentosa, Cæsalpinia Bonducella, Acacia\r\nlaurifolia, Barringtonia speciosa, Terminalia Katappa, Gyrocarpus\r\nJacquini, Pemphis acidula, Morinda citrifolia, Guettarda speciosa,\r\nWedelia biflora, Scævola Kœnigii, Cordia subcordata, Tournefortia\r\nargentea, Ipomœa pes capræ, Cassytha filiformis, Hernandia peltata,\r\nPandanus odoratissimus, &c.\r\n\r\n(b) _Mangrove-formation._—Carapa obovata, Rhizophora mucronata,\r\nRhizophora mangle, Bruguiera Rheedii, Lumnitzera coccinea, Scirpodendron\r\ncostatum, &c.

Several of the plants\r\nplaced in the intermediate formation, such as Heritiera littoralis,\r\nEntada scandens, Excæcaria Agallocha, &c., are just as much at home\r\namongst the mangroves. In the same way it is often difficult to\r\ndistinguish between the Beach and the Intermediate formations, and\r\nplants like Cerbera Odollam, Hibiscus tiliaceus, and Vitex trifolia\r\nbelong equally to both.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 25 (page 47)\r\n\r\n                THE STRAND-FLORA OF THE TAHITIAN REGION\r\n\r\nDrake del Castillo’s _Flore de la Polynésie française_ deals mainly with\r\nthe Society or Tahitian Islands, but also with the Marquesas, Paumotus,\r\nGambier Islands, and Wallis Island. The last-named, however, lies in\r\nWestern Polynesia, and is not dealt with in this connection. There is no\r\nreason to believe, judging from the general character of the islands and\r\nfrom Cheeseman’s memoir on the Rarotongan flora, that the strand-plants\r\nof the islands of the Cook and Austral Groups, which also belong to this\r\nregion, differ materially from those of the Tahitian islands proper.\r\nRarotonga, however, possesses Entada scandens, not recorded as a growing\r\nplant from any other part of East Polynesia, excepting perhaps Mangaia\r\nin the same group.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 26 (page 48)\r\n\r\n              THE FIJIAN SHORE-PLANTS NOT FOUND IN TAHITI\r\n\r\nAlthough most of these plants, such as Barringtonia racemosa,\r\nClerodendron inerme, Entada scandens, Excæcaria Agallocha, Heritiera\r\nlittoralis, Smythea pacifica, &c., have fruits that float for months,\r\nand could have reached Tahiti as readily as some of the beach-plants\r\nthat have successfully established themselves, there are a few like\r\nDalbergia monosperma, Derris uliginosa, and Scirpodendron costatum, the\r\nfruits of which only float for weeks, and it is possible that they may\r\nhave been unable to reach there.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 27 (page 49)\r\n\r\n  THE INTRUDERS INTO THE BEACH-FLORA FROM THE INLAND PLANTS OF TAHITI\r\n\r\nDrake del Castillo mentions several, such as species of Boerhaavia, that\r\ncould only be occasional intruders; but it is noteworthy that Gardenia\r\ntahitensis appears to be a genuine recruit from inland. The xerophilous\r\nhabit of the Pacific Gardenias and their station, usually near the\r\ncoast, however, would render this possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 28 (page 52)\r\n\r\n              THE LITTORAL PLANTS OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS\r\n\r\n Column headings:\r\n\r\n A: Indigenous.\r\n B: By aborigines in ancient times.\r\n C: By Europeans soon after discovery.\r\n D: Old World.\r\n E: New Worlds.\r\n F: Both Worlds.\r\n G: Large.\r\n H: Small.\r\n I: Float for months.\r\n J: Sink at once or in a few days.\r\n K: Attract frugivorous birds.\r\n\r\n +---------------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---------------------+\r\n |                           |  Origin.  |  Distri-  | Characters of fruit |\r\n |                           |           |  bution.  | or seed.            |\r\n |                           +---+---+---+---+---+---+-------+---------+---+\r\n |  Species.[5]              |   |Intro- |   |   |   | Size. |Buoyancy.|   |\r\n |                           |   |duced. |   |   |   |  [6]  |         |   |\r\n |                           |   +---+---+   |   |   +---+---+-----+---+---+\r\n |                           | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H |  I  | J | K |\r\n +---------------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+-----+---+---+\r\n |  Acacia Farnesiana        |...|...| + |...|...| + |...| + |weeks|...| ? |\r\n |  Cæsalpinia Bonducella    | + |...|...|...|...| + |...| + | ... | + |...|\r\n |  Calophyllum inophyllum   |...| + |...| + |...|...| + |...|  +  |...|...|\r\n |  Cassytha filiformis      | + |...|...|...|...| + |...| + |  +  |...| + |\r\n |  Colubrina asiatica       | + |...|...| + |...|...|...| + |  +  |...|...|\r\n |  Cordia subcordata        |...| + |...| + |...|...|...| + |  +  |...|...|\r\n |E Cuscuta sandwichiana     | + |...|...|...|...|...|...| + | ... | + |...|\r\n |  Cocos nucifera           |...| + |...|...|...| + | + |...|  +  |...|...|\r\n |P Gossypium tomentosum     | + |...|...|...|...|...|...| + | ... | + |...|\r\n |P Heliotropium anomalum    | + |...|...|...|...|...|...| + | ... | + |...|\r\n |  Heliotropium curassavicum| + |...|...|...|...| + |...| + | ... | + |...|\r\n |  Herpestis Monnieria      | + |...|...|...|...| + |...| + | ... | + |...|\r\n |  Hibiscus tiliaceus       |...| + |...|...|...| + |...| + |  +  |...|...|\r\n |  Ipomœa glaberrima        | + |...|...| + |...|...|...| + |  +  |...|...|\r\n |  Ipomœa pes capræ         | + |...|...|...|...| + |...| + |  +  |...|...|\r\n |E Jacquemontia sandwicensis| + |...|...|...|...|...|...| + | ... | + |...|\r\n |E Lipochæta integrifolia   | + |...|...|...|...|...|...| + | ... | + |...|\r\n |  Morinda citrifolia       |...| + |...| + |...|...|...| + |  +  |...| ? |\r\n |  Mucuna gigantea          | + |...|...| + |...|...| + |...|  +  |...|...|\r\n |  Pandanus odoratissimus   |...| + |...| + |...|...| + |...|  +  |...|...|\r\n |  Portulaca oleracea       |...| + |...|...|...|...|...| + | ... | + |...|\r\n |  Scævola Kœnigii          | + |...|...| + |...| + |...| + |  +  |...| + |\r\n |  Sesuvium Portulacastrum  | + |...|...|...|...|...|...| + | ... | + |...|\r\n |  Tacca pinnatifida        |...| + |...| + |...| + |...| + |  +  |...|...|\r\n |  Tephrosia piscatoria     | + |...|...| + |...|...|...| + | ... | + |...|\r\n |  Terminalia Katappa       |...|...| + | + |...|...| + |...|  +  |...|...|\r\n |  Thespesia populnea       |...| + |...| + |...|...|...| + |  +  |...|...|\r\n |  Tribulus cistoides       | + |...|...|...| + |...|...| + | ... | + |...|\r\n |  Vigna lutea              | + |...|...|...|...| + |...| + |  +  |...|...|\r\n |  Vitex trifolia           | + |...|...| + |...|...|...| + |  +  |...| + |\r\n +---------------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+-----+---+---+\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  There are three endemic species here included which are preceded by E.\r\n  Two species preceded by P are confined to Polynesia. Most of the\r\n  plants are at present typically littoral, though often also occurring\r\n  inland.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  All fruits or seeds, an inch or over in size, that could not have been\r\n  transported to Hawaii by birds are regarded as large.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 29 (page 54)\r\n\r\n      BOTANICAL NOTES ON THE COAST-PLANTS OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS\r\n\r\n[The following remarks have been extracted from my journals and\r\nrepresent some of the field-notes of journeys made in the more\r\ninteresting localities.]\r\n\r\n(1) _Walk along the Puna Coast, Hawaii, from Punaluu to Hilo_ (Dec. 26,\r\n1896, to Jan. 6, 1897).—For the first two to three miles to Kamehame\r\nPoint, the following plants were noticed on the flows of smooth ropy\r\nlava that formed the cliff-bound coast—Capparis sandwichiana,\r\nJacquemontia sandwicensis, Ipomœa insularis, Lipochæta lavarum,\r\nPortulaca villosa, Tephrosia piscatoria, Tribulus cistoides, Waltheria\r\namericana, &c. Beyond this point Scævola Kœnigii was abundant in places\r\non the old lava-flows near the sea, and further on patches of Myoporum\r\nsandwicense growing, not as a tree 20 to 30 feet high, as in the\r\nmountains, but as a prostrate shrub with fleshy leaves. Vegetation\r\nsimilar to that above described occurred on the surface of the old\r\nlava-flows that constituted the cliff-bound sea-border as far as\r\nKapapala Bay. On the sandy beach at Kapapala Bay grew Ipomœa pes capræ,\r\nserving as host to Cuscuta sandwichiana. In the vicinity of the house at\r\nKeauhou there were a few Coco palms and Pandanus trees, whilst Capparis\r\nsandwichiana and Morinda citrifolia were growing on the adjacent\r\nlava-fields.\r\n\r\nMorinda citrifolia and Tephrosia piscatoria grew on the lava flows\r\nbetween Keauhou and Apua. On the beach at Apua, Ipomœa pes capræ and\r\nScævola Kœnigii were abundant, the last extending a few hundred yards\r\ninland on the lava. Further east the inland bush, made up of Cyathodes\r\ntameiameiæ, Metrosideros polymorpha, &c., descended to the coast to\r\nwithin a few hundred yards of the sea. In crossing the lava coast plains\r\nto Kapa-ahu I observed Morinda citrifolia growing frequently out of the\r\ncracks in the bare lava-rock, and an occasional solitary tree of\r\nErythrina monosperma growing also from the fissures.\r\n\r\nBefore reaching Kapa-ahu we passed the site of an old coast village,\r\nnamed Laepuki, where there were growing from forty to fifty Coco-nut\r\npalms, as well as another village, represented by a solitary house, and\r\nnamed Kamomoa, where there were 27 Coco-nut palms and a few Pandanus\r\ntrees. Kapa-ahu, with its numerous Coco-nut palms, was more like a South\r\nSea coast village than any before seen; and the coast vegetation\r\nsuddenly acquired a South Pacific character.\r\n\r\nAt Pulama, for instance, about a mile west of Kapa-ahu, where the\r\nancient lava-flows, fairly vegetated, terminate at the sea in cliffs 20\r\nor 25 feet high, there is a curious and quite unexpected development of\r\na littoral flora such as we should see in the South Pacific. Here,\r\ngrowing on the broken lava surface at the brink of the cliffs and\r\noverlooking the sea, thrive Cæsalpinia Bonducella, Cocos nucifera,\r\nIpomœa pes capræ, Ipomœa glaberrima, Morinda citrifolia, Pandanus\r\nodoratissimus, Scævola Kœnigii, Sesuvium Portulacastrum, Thespesia\r\npopulnea, and Vigna lutea. This shore-belt of characteristic littoral\r\nplants is backed by vegetation more inland in its character, amongst\r\nwhich Aleurites moluccana, Dodonæa viscosa, Erythrina monosperma, Ipomœa\r\ninsularis, I. bona nox, Osteomeles anthyllidifolia, &c., are to be\r\nobserved. Such a shore-belt of typical littoral plants is rarely to be\r\nfound in the large island of Hawaii; and its usual position at the\r\nmargin of cliffs, and raised 20 or 25 feet above the sea, is rather\r\nsuggestive of an uplift in recent times of this part of the coast.\r\n\r\nBetween Kapa-ahu and Kalapana is a low country occupied mostly by\r\nGuavas, and often turfy. At Kalapana, which is a large village situated\r\non a grassy plain by the sea, Coco palms and Pandanus trees abound, and\r\nMucuna gigantea and Cæsalpinia Bonducella are frequent near the coast,\r\nwhilst Ipomœa pes capræ is common on the beach. Calophyllum inophyllum\r\nis planted near the houses. Here Osteomeles anthyllidifolia in its\r\ndwarfed form descends to the edge of the cliffs. About half a mile\r\nbeyond Kalapana is the hamlet of Kaimu, and here among the Coco palms\r\nclose to the beach I noticed four Loulu palms (Pritchardia\r\nGaudichaudii). Beyond Kaimu the trees and shrubs of the inland wood,\r\nMetrosideros polymorpha, Cyathodes tameiameiæ, &c., descend on the spurs\r\nof old lava-flows close to the coast; whilst Pandanus and Morinda\r\ncitrifolia with Mucuna gigantea are common near the sea as far as\r\nKehena, where there are plenty of Coco palms. I approached Opihikao\r\nthrough as fine a Pandanus forest as I have ever seen, the large Bird’s\r\nNest Fern (Asplenium nidus) growing half-way up their trunks, adding\r\npicturesqueness to the scene, whilst Mucuna gigantea was a common\r\nclimber. Beyond Opihikao the inland woods descend to the coast. Thence\r\non to Makuu the coasts are mostly occupied by Pandanus forests, and the\r\nlower coast road from Makuu to Hilo traverses a region where these\r\nPandanus trees abound, extending far inland. Scævola Koenigii and Ipomœa\r\npes capræ are common on the coast near Coco-nut Island, Hilo Bay.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that the agency of the wild goat explains the dispersal\r\nof Myoporum sandwicense, Morinda citrifolia, Tephrosia piscatoria,\r\nWaltheria americana, &c., over the almost bare surfaces of the lava\r\nflows on the Puna coast. Goat droppings were frequent under the patches\r\nof Myoporum and Waltheria. In some of them I found the entire seeds of\r\nPortulaca oleracea and the small cocci of Euphorbia pilulifera, weeds\r\ncommon in the district.\r\n\r\n(2) _Coasts of the Kalae Promontory and its Vicinity, Hawaii._— This is\r\nthe most southerly portion of the group, and it is on the eastern coasts\r\nof this district that many of the North American drift logs are embayed\r\nand stranded. At Kamilo, to the east of the promontory, there is a long\r\nbeach of calcareous sand where Heliotropium anomalum, Scævola Kœnigii,\r\nand Tribulus cistoides grow in abundance, whilst Sesuvium Portulacastrum\r\nthrives on the beach and in brackish pools. Portulaca lutea (Sol.),\r\nIpomœa glaberrima (Boj.), and Jacquemontia sandwicensis also occur.\r\nWhere the beach-sand has encroached on the adjacent lava surface, the\r\nScævola covers extensive tracts off the beach, and is stunted. I noticed\r\na solitary thicket of Thespesia populnea on the beach.\r\n\r\nThe actual headland of Kalae is wind-swept and covered with grass,\r\namongst which Portulaca villosa and Sida fallax thrive. By the sea occur\r\nScævola Kœnigii and Ipomœa pes capræ, and there is some Sesbania\r\ntomentosa near the point. Waiheiaukini beach is shut in between the\r\nlofty arid slopes of the promontory on one side and a modern lava-flow\r\non the other side. Here Scævola Kœnigii grows in quantity, together with\r\nIpomœa pes capræ, Tribulus cistoides, Sida fallax, and Jacquemontia\r\nsandwicensis, whilst Cuscuta sandwichiana is abundant, finding its hosts\r\nin the first four plants just named.\r\n\r\n(3) _South Kona Coast, Hawaii._—The coast here, as exemplified by that\r\nbetween Kapua and Hoopuloa, is mostly bare lava. Here and there, a\r\nlittle coral sand collects amongst the lava blocks of the rubbly shore,\r\nand it is in such places that Scævola Kœnigii and Ipomœa pes capræ find\r\na home and apparently thrive, whilst Hibiscus tiliaceus and Morinda\r\ncitrifolia grow behind. I observed Cordia subcordata and one or two\r\nspecimens of Pritchardia Gaudichaudii by the coast on the south side of\r\nMilolii. Around a brackish pool at Kapua I observed Heliotropium\r\ncurassavicum, and Acacia Farnesiana was to be seen growing on the beach\r\nat Okoe. On the lava coast between Hoopuloa and Papa, two miles to the\r\nnorth, Tephrosia piscatoria was very abundant.\r\n\r\n(4) _North Kona Coast, Hawaii._—I examined the coast between Kailua and\r\nKiholo. White beaches are common south of Keahole Point, the coast\r\nfurther north being usually lava-bound with sandy beaches here and\r\nthere. Heliotropium anomalum, Ipomœa pes capræ, and Sesuvium\r\nPortulacastrum are the commonest beach plants on this coast. Scævola\r\nKœnigii is also abundant in places, whilst Tribulus cistoides and\r\nMorinda citrifolia are also fairly common on the beaches. The Morinda\r\nalso grows on the adjacent lava flats; but on both sand and rock it is\r\nevidently usually self-sown, since seedlings are to be seen near the\r\nolder plants. Heliotropium curassavicum is to be seen here and there on\r\nthe sand all along the coast, but nearly always associated with H.\r\nanomalum. Jacquemontia sandwicensis occurs occasionally on the beach;\r\nand Cuscuta sandwichiana is abundant in places, growing generally on\r\nIpomœa pes capræ, but sometimes on Scævola Kœnigii. Brackish water ponds\r\nare common on the coast inside the beaches, Ruppia maritima flourishing\r\nin the water, with Sesuvium Portulacastrum growing at the edges.\r\nSometimes Hala trees (Pandanus odoratissimus) fringe the borders of the\r\npools. I noticed Pritchardia Gaudichaudii on the coast at Kiholo, and I\r\nlearned that Cordia subcordata was once common here as on other parts of\r\nthe Kona coast; but it has died out as in most other localities.\r\n\r\n(5) _Kohala Coast, Hawaii._—Several littoral plants are scantily\r\nrepresented on the beach of black sand at the mouth of the Waimanu\r\nvalley, especially Ipomœa pes capræ, Morinda citrifolia, Pandanus\r\nodoratissimus, and Scævola Kœnigii. The Pandanus covers the adjacent\r\nprecipitous slopes up to a height of several hundred feet above the sea.\r\nIpomœa pes capræ is abundant on the sand dunes backing the beach at\r\nWaipio. I observed Naias marina in the Waipio River just inside the\r\nmouth. No one seems to have recorded the plant from the group since\r\nChamisso found it in Oahu.\r\n\r\n(6) _Hamakua Coast, Hawaii._—Not many opportunities presented themselves\r\non this cliff-bound coast of finding littoral plants. At the mouth of a\r\ngulch between Ookala and Laupahoehoe I found growing at the coast Vitex\r\ntrifolia (var. unifoliolata) in quantity, together with Morinda\r\ncitrifolia, Scævola Kœnigii, and Pandanus odoratissimus, the last-named\r\nclothing the hill-slopes overlooking the sea.\r\n\r\n(7) _The Coasts of Oahu._—The littoral vegetation of the south-east\r\nportion of the island from Diamond Head round to Waimanalo is, as a\r\nrule, scanty. Ipomœa pes capræ and Tribulus cistoides prevail to Koko\r\nHead, and on the rubbly coast between that headland and Makapuu Point\r\noccur Tephrosia piscatoria, different species of Lipochæta, &c. Between\r\nMakapuu Point and Waimanalo, Scævola Kœnigii and Vitex trifolia (var.\r\nunifoliolata) are fairly abundant, the former growing on the rocky slope\r\nat the base of the cliffs, and raised perhaps some 20 feet above the\r\nsea. Along the whole east coast of the island the littoral vegetation is\r\nrarely well represented. However, Ipomœa pes capræ is common everywhere,\r\nwhilst Scævola Kœnigii occurs frequently, and here and there a few\r\nplants of Morinda citrifolia are seen on the beach, while thickets of\r\nHibiscus tiliaceus mark in some localities the mouths of streams.\r\n\r\nOn the north coast of Oahu, as on the Waialua and Waimea beaches, the\r\none-leaved variety of Vitex trifolia is common, together with Ipomœa pes\r\ncapræ and Euphorbia cordata; whilst Acacia Farnesiana is frequent on the\r\nWaialua beach, its pods being much appreciated by the cattle.\r\nOccasionally, as by the bridge at Waimea, Colubrina asiatica and\r\nThespesia populnea are to be noticed.\r\n\r\nShore vegetation is a little better represented on the beaches at and\r\nnear Kaena Point, the north-west corner of the island. Here on the sand\r\nwe find often in abundance Heliotropium anomalum, the same variety of\r\nVitex trifolia, Scævola Kœnigii, and Ipomœa pes capræ; whilst on the\r\nrocks bordering the beach occur Gossypium tomentosum, Jacquemontia\r\nsandwicensis, Tribulus cistoides, Vigna lutea, and more than one species\r\nof Lipochæta, the last being derivatives from the inland flora.\r\n\r\nOn the west coast of the island true shore-plants play an inconspicuous\r\npart. Ipomœa pes capræ is common on the beaches, and such plants as\r\nAcacia Farnesiana, Jacquemontia sandwicensis, Gossypium tomentosum, and\r\nTribulus cistoides immediately border the beach. Ipomœa tuberculata is a\r\nfrequent intruder as well as the recently introduced Algaroba tree\r\n(Prosopis dulcis). Acacia Farnesiana also extends inland, covering\r\nentire large areas and forming in the Waianae valley extensive thickets\r\nimpenetrable for the cattle. It occupies great districts near the coast\r\nin different parts of Oahu, and with Hibiscus tiliaceus is to be found\r\nfar inland. The cattle are active dispersers of its seeds. (See Note\r\n30.)\r\n\r\nTrue beach plants are infrequent at the mouth of Pearl Harbour, although\r\nthe coast is well suited for them. Here I found Heliotropium anomalum,\r\nH. curassavicum, Jacquemontia sandwicensis, Lipochæta integrifolia (a\r\ntrue beach plant), Herpestis Monnieria, &c. Batis maritima occurs in one\r\nor two localities around Oahu, but it is, according to Hillebrand, of\r\nrecent introduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 30 (page 58)\r\n\r\n                THE BEACH-DRIFT OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS\r\n\r\nIt was pointed out by Dole long ago in one of the Hawaiian Club Papers\r\n(1868) that the existing currents bring to this archipelago only huge\r\npine logs from Oregon, but no tropical fruits; and Hillebrand (p. xiv.)\r\nrefers to the driftwood of pine logs from the north-west coast of\r\nAmerica, stranded on the shores of these islands. This drift seems to\r\ncollect in quantity in particular localities, as on the south-east coast\r\nof Hawaii between Honuapo and the Kalae promontory (especially on the\r\nKamilo beach near Kaluwalu) and on the east coast of Oahu; and probably\r\nthere are other favourable localities for catching the drift on the\r\nnorthern shores of Maui and Molokai.\r\n\r\nIt was on the south-east coast of Hawaii (on the beach at Kamilo and on\r\nthe eastern side of the Kalae promontory) that this drift came\r\nparticularly under my notice. Here the logs are stranded in abundance,\r\nin sufficient quantity, in fact, to build a town, and they were employed\r\nfor building purposes by the manager of the neighbouring sugar-cane\r\nplantation. Several of the logs are of huge size, as much as 4 feet in\r\ndiameter; and they are known locally as “white cedar” and “red cedar,”\r\nand characterised as Oregon timber. Some of them are extensively\r\nburrowed by the “teredo” and other boring mollusks. Others recently\r\nstranded are covered with barnacles (Lepadidæ), whilst others that have\r\nlain long on the beach are bare. I have seen these logs occasionally\r\nwashed up at Punaluu and at different places on the lava-bound Puna\r\ncoast. They apparently first strike the Puna coast, and are drifted\r\nalong until they become embayed near the Kalae promontory, and\r\nultimately stranded. Mingled with them on the beaches Pandanus trunks\r\noccur in number; they evidently hail from those parts of the Puna coast\r\nwhere Pandanus forests prevail, and thus they indicate the direction of\r\nthe drift on the coast of this island. In places there was a\r\nconsiderable amount of small vegetable _débris_, sometimes partially\r\nconcealed by the sand, and containing seeds and fruits in fair quantity.\r\n\r\nThe following seeds and fruits were collected:—\r\n\r\n _Pandanus_ drupes, common; most of them fresh-looking, but a few much\r\n worn.\r\n _Thespesia populnea_, a few seeds.\r\n _Ipomœa pes capræ_, seeds, fair numbers.\r\n _Ipomœa bona nox_, seeds, a few.\r\n _Ipomœa glaberrima_, seeds, a few.\r\n _Argyreia tiliæfolia_, fruits and seeds, a few.\r\n _Strongylodon lucidum_, seeds, a few.\r\n _Cæsalpinia Bonducella_, a single seed.\r\n _Vigna lutea_, seeds, a few.\r\n _Calophyllum inophyllum_, a few fruits.\r\n _Ricinus communis_, a few, the seeds either free or in the cocci, and\r\n often empty or decaying.\r\n _Aleurites moluccana_, seeds, common, none sound, either empty or\r\n containing a rotten kernel: also a single fruit.\r\n One or two seeds not identified.\r\n\r\nThere was seemingly a total absence of the fruits or seeds of any\r\nlittoral plant not found in these islands, such as I was familiar with\r\nin the South Pacific. In the mass this seed-drift could have been\r\nderived from the neighbouring coasts of the island. This is especially\r\nindicated in the cases of the fruits and seeds of Aleurites moluccana,\r\nRicinus communis, and Argyreia tiliæfolia. The sound seeds of Aleurites\r\ndo not float, the buoyant seeds being always empty, or nearly so; and\r\nthe presence of the seeds in beach-drift, as explained on page 419, is\r\ndue partly to the buoyancy of the empty seed and partly to the decay of\r\nthe stranded fruit, the fruits being able to float for a week or two.\r\nSo, also, the seeds of Ricinus, whether free or inclosed in the coccus,\r\ndo not, when sound, float longer than a week or ten days. The capsules\r\nof the Argyreia can float two or three weeks, whilst the seeds vary in\r\ntheir behaviour, as observed on page 20. I noticed in places where the\r\nvegetable _débris_ was heaped up and exposed to the sun’s heat, that\r\nsome of the Ipomœa seeds were germinating. It is to be remarked that\r\nhorse-dung and goat-dung are always common in the beach-drift of these\r\nislands. Seeds are sometimes to be seen in the stranded material; and it\r\nwas evident that the droppings of these animals can float for some weeks\r\nbefore breaking down.... I may add that large sponges, apparently of no\r\nvalue, are thrown up in quantities on the east side of the Kalae\r\npromontory.\r\n\r\nExcepting the pine logs, the only things coming under my notice in this\r\nbeach-drift that could be characterised without hesitation as\r\nnon-Hawaiian, were two well-worn pieces of acid pumice, less than an\r\ninch in size. One of them was incrusted partially by the tubes of\r\nannelids, and both of them had evidently been drifting about in the\r\nPacific for a long period, perhaps for years. They were such as occur in\r\nabundance on the beaches of the South Pacific, and, in fact, on all the\r\nshores of the Pacific Ocean, both temperate and tropical. Although I\r\ncarefully searched the stranded drift of many beaches in this group, no\r\nother specimens of drift pumice were found.\r\n\r\nOn different parts of Oahu the beach-drift was always made up of\r\nmaterials derived from the vegetation of the coast adjacent. Of most\r\nfrequent occurrence were the seeds of Ipomœa pes capræ and Vigna lutea,\r\nand the fruits of Scævola Kœnigii, Vitex trifolia, and Pandanus\r\nodoratissimus. In addition, the empty seeds of Aleurites moluccana were\r\nnumerous, and there were occasional seeds of Thespesia populnea,\r\nColubrina asiatica, and Mucuna gigantea. On one beach there were a\r\nnumber of fruits of Terminalia Katappa, showing but little signs of\r\nocean travel, and evidently derived from trees in the vicinity. This\r\ntree was introduced by Europeans; but it is not unlikely that in a\r\ngeneration or two it will become, without man’s aid, one of the\r\ncharacteristic beach trees of Oahu. It may be remarked that the pods of\r\nAcacia Farnesiana, a shrub now growing abundantly in Oahu near the sea,\r\nare washed up in great quantities on the beaches of the west coast of\r\nthis island, and the seeds are to be seen germinating in numbers on the\r\nbeach, the seedlings striking into the sand. The pods float unharmed in\r\nsea-water for four or five weeks, but the seeds, when freed, sink.\r\n\r\nAlthough the above evidence gives no indication of tropical drift of\r\nnon-Hawaiian origin on the beaches, it is probable, for reasons adduced\r\nin Chapter VIII., that, in the winter, drift may be brought from\r\ntropical America.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 31 (page 59)\r\n\r\n           THE INLAND EXTENSION OF THE SHORE-PLANTS OF HAWAII\r\n\r\n_Cæsalpinia Bonducella._—According to Hillebrand, this plant, so\r\ncharacteristic of the littoral floras of tropical regions, grows “in\r\ngulches of the lower plains on all the islands,” no reference being made\r\nto its occurrence on the beaches. It is very rarely to be seen on the\r\nbeaches of the large island of Hawaii; but it is to be found on the\r\nlava-bound coasts, and from there it extends inland usually on old\r\nlava-flows for five or six miles, and reaches sometimes considerable\r\nelevations. In one locality I found it at 2,000 feet above the sea (see\r\npage 188).\r\n\r\n_Cassytha filiformis._—Though a typical shore-plant in Fiji and other\r\ntropical localities, it is rarely so in these islands. Hillebrand says\r\nnothing of its station. It grows well in the lower open wooded regions,\r\nand is frequently found amongst the blocks of old lava-flows near the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\n_Cuscuta sandwichiana._—Unlike its fellow parasite Cassytha filiformis,\r\nthis species of Cuscuta, which is confined to this group, never came\r\nunder my notice away from the beach; and Hillebrand speaks of finding it\r\nonly at the coast (see page 366).\r\n\r\n_Ipomœa pes capræ_, as I observed it in the islands of Hawaii and Oahu,\r\nis confined to the beach or to neighbouring sand-dunes. Hillebrand makes\r\nno reference to its occurrence inland. This species in these islands\r\noffers thus a great contrast to its behaviour in Fiji.\r\n\r\n_Scævola Kœnigii._—Whilst most at home on the sandy beaches, this plant\r\nis also frequently met with in the island of Hawaii on scantily\r\nvegetated lava-flows near the coast; but I never noticed it more than a\r\nfew hundred yards from the sea.\r\n\r\n_Tephrosia piscatoria._—Though it may occur on the beach, it is\r\ngenerally found as described by Hillebrand on the rocky or rubbly ground\r\nat the back of the beach, as well as further inland. It is common on the\r\nold lava-fields of the island of Hawaii near the coast; and, according\r\nto the natives, its seeds are disseminated by the wild goats that\r\nfrequent these localities.\r\n\r\n_Tribulus cistoides._—Hillebrand observes that this plant is found along\r\nthe sea-shore and on the lower plains. I found it most frequently on the\r\nbeaches and on the old lava-flows near the sea.\r\n\r\n_Vitex trifolia, var. unifoliolata._—It is confined, as Hillebrand\r\nremarks, to the beaches. Neither in Oahu nor in Hawaii did I ever find\r\nit straying inland, which is the more remarkable since this variety, or\r\none closely similar to it, is one of the most characteristic inland\r\nplants of the Fijian strand-flora.\r\n\r\n_Vigna lutea._—This plant was found by me growing on the beaches and in\r\ntheir vicinity. Hillebrand merely speaks of it as “growing at short\r\ndistances from the shore.”\r\n\r\nSome of the trees, usually littoral in their station in the tropical\r\nPacific, which are regarded as having been introduced in early times\r\ninto the Hawaiian group by the Aborigines (see Chapter VII.), behave,\r\nnevertheless, quite like indigenous plants in the inland regions and in\r\nthe lower levels. This is true, for instance, of Hibiscus tiliaceus and\r\nPandanus odoratissimus, the last-named forming forests at the sea-board\r\nextending in places far up the mountain slopes. The same, however, may\r\nbe said of other plants known to have been introduced since the\r\ndiscovery of the islands, as in the cases of Cactus Tuna and of Ricinus\r\ncommunis; and it also applies to Aleurites moluccana, the Candle-nut\r\nTree, which, although it could only have been introduced by the\r\nAborigines, now forms forests on the lower slopes of the mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      NOTE 32 (pages 19, 112, 165)\r\n\r\n                      THE FIJIAN SPECIES OF PREMNA\r\n\r\nI was much interested in the small trees and shrubs of this genus in\r\nFiji, more especially on account of the relation between the shore and\r\ninland species. This is an Old World genus containing some eighty\r\nspecies mainly characteristic of tropical Asia and Malaya, and\r\nrepresented in the South Pacific archipelagoes by two species, one\r\nPremna taitensis or tahitensis, spread over the region and very near P.\r\nintegrifolia, an Asiatic species; the other Premna serratifolia, an\r\nAsiatic plant found in Fiji, the Marquesas, and other groups. Without\r\nendeavouring to give a precise value to the Fijian plants, I will merely\r\ndescribe the prevailing forms, which are, however, connected by\r\nintermediate varieties. These trees, I may add, are known by the same\r\nname in the various Pacific groups, “Avaro” or “Avalo” in Tahiti,\r\n“Alo-alo” in Samoa, “Yaro” and “Yaro-yaro” in Fiji.\r\n\r\nThe Fijian plants may be thus described.... (_a_) Premna serratifolia,\r\nan inland tree, growing in open woods and on the outskirts of the\r\nforest, 25 to 30 feet high, more or less hairy, leaves coarsely serrated\r\nwith long tapering points, putamen prominently tuberculated and\r\nthick-walled.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Premna taitensis or P. integrifolia, a low straggling coast tree\r\nor shrub of the beaches, the coral islets, the swampy borders of the\r\nestuaries, and the inland talasinga plains, its usual height being eight\r\nto ten feet, except in the inland plains, where it is dwarfed, and three\r\nto five feet high. It is more or less glabrous, the leaves being\r\ntypically entire with obtuse or retuse and mucronate apices. The putamen\r\nis thin-walled and relatively smooth. (_c_) Intermediate forms found\r\ngenerally in the inland plains or talasinga regions.\r\n\r\n_On the Modes of Dispersal._—Speaking generally, the small drupes of\r\nboth species float at first, but the soft parts are soon removed by\r\ndecay, and the stone is freed. In the case of the coast species, P.\r\ntaitensis, the stones float indefinitely and are often found afloat in\r\nrivers. In the case of the inland tree, P. serratifolia, most of the\r\nstones sink at once, whilst the others sink in a few days. It is\r\nprobable that currents are one of the effective agencies in distributing\r\nthe coast species, but this could not apply to the inland tree. The\r\nfruits of both the inland and the coast species would attract birds, and\r\nthe stones would resist injury in their crops. This is the agency\r\nadvocated by Prof. Schimper for the shore species, P. integrifolia, of\r\nIndo-Malaya; and fruits referred with a query to this genus were found\r\nin the collection of seeds and fruits obtained by me from the crops of\r\npigeons in the Solomon Islands (_Bot. Chall. Exped._, Introd. p. 46,\r\npart IV. p. 312).\r\n\r\n_On the Cause of the Buoyancy of the Stone or Putamen of the Coast\r\nSpecies._—This is primarily connected with the empty seed-cavities, the\r\nfour-celled stone usually developing only one seed, the other cavities\r\nbeing empty. This inference was established by the dissection of a large\r\nnumber of stones, but it will be seen from the table below that\r\none-seeded stones are also frequent in the case of the inland tree (P.\r\nserratifolia), where they as a rule sink. With either species the\r\nsubstance of the stone has no floating power, but with the shore\r\nspecies, on account of the thin-walled stone, the empty seed-cavities\r\ncause it to be specifically lighter than water whilst with the inland\r\nspecies the walls of the stone are so thick that the empty spaces of the\r\nunfilled seed-cavities do not effect the same result. It may be remarked\r\nthat when the coast species grows in the inland plains the buoyancy of\r\nthe stone is preserved.\r\n\r\n +-----------------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n |                             | One-seeded  | Two-seeded  |Three-seeded |\r\n |                             | stones.     | stones.     |stones.      |\r\n +-----------------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n |Inland tree (P. serratifolia)| 73 per cent.| 23 per cent.| 4 per cent. |\r\n |Coast tree (P. taitensis)    | 92 per cent.|  8 per cent.|      —      |\r\n +-----------------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 33 (page 63)\r\n\r\n     DE CANDOLLE’S LIST OF PLANTS DISPERSED EXCLUSIVELY BY CURRENTS\r\n\r\nDrepanocarpus lunatus; Ecastaphyllum Brownei; Mucuna urens, D.C.;\r\nTephrosia piscatoria; Hibiscus tiliaceus; Rhizophora mangle; Guilandina\r\nBonduc, Linn.; Ipomœa pes capræ; Canavalia obtusifolia.\r\n\r\nI have experimented on the buoyancy of the fruits and seeds of all these\r\nplants excepting the two first named.

For the other authorities on the buoyancy of these seeds and\r\nfruits reference should be made to the list given under Note 2 and to\r\nother parts of this work. About one or two of the plants, like Ipomœa\r\npeltata, one scarcely knows whether they are most characteristic of the\r\ncoast-flora or of the inland-flora.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 36 (page 72)\r\n\r\n HAWAIIAN PLANTS WITH BUOYANT SEEDS AND FRUITS KNOWN TO BE DISPERSED BY\r\n   THE CURRENTS EITHER EXCLUSIVELY OR, AS IN A FEW SPECIES, WITH THE\r\n                    ASSISTANCE OF FRUGIVOROUS BIRDS\r\n\r\n_Colubrina asiatica._—Usually regarded as confined to the Old World; but\r\nsince nearly all the species are American, that continent may be\r\nconsidered as the probable home also of this species.

The genus is chiefly Australian, and it is possible\r\nthat the littoral species may have reached America through the agency of\r\nbirds, since all the species of the genus possess fruits that would\r\nattract frugivorous birds.\r\n\r\n_Ipomœa glaberrima_ (Boj.).—Old World.\r\n\r\n_Ipomœa pes capræ._—Old and New Worlds.\r\n\r\n_Vitex trifolia._—Old World. The genus is also dispersed by pigeons.\r\n\r\n_Cassytha filiformis._—Old and New Worlds. Like Scævola the genus is\r\nchiefly Australian, and here, also, the fruits of the littoral species\r\nare not only dispersed by the currents, but are known to be also\r\ndisseminated by fruit-pigeons.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that birds may have taken a predominant part in the\r\ndispersal of the species of Scævola, Vitex and Cassytha.\r\n\r\nThere thus remain nine species for consideration. Of these two are\r\nexclusively American, three are found in both the Old and New Worlds and\r\nfour are usually regarded as exclusively Old World plants, but one of\r\nthem (Colubrina asiatica) has a fair claim to be regarded as of American\r\norigin. Thus it is quite possible that six out of these nine plants were\r\nbrought to Hawaii from America through the agency of the currents.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 37 (page 78)\r\n\r\n ON VIVIPARY IN THE FRUITS OF BARRINGTONIA RACEMOSA AND CARAPA OBOVATA\r\n\r\nAs observed by me in the Rewa delta, Fiji, there was no external\r\nevidence of such a process in the case of the fruits on the trees; but I\r\ndid not pay very special attention to the matter, and it will be\r\ngathered from Chapter XXX. that the initial stage of germination may\r\nshow no indication in the appearance of the fruit. More observation is\r\nneeded for both species. As indicated in Note 50, the structure of the\r\nseed of Barringtonia racemosa is suggestive of a lost viviparous habit.\r\nWith regard to Carapa, Schimper (p. 43) remarks that he has never\r\nobserved vivipary; but Miquel, in his _Flora Indiæ Bataviæ_,\r\nparticularly speaks of the seeds germinating in the capsule. I think\r\nthis is very likely, and that perhaps even the rupture of the capsule\r\nmay be partly due to this cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 38 (page 78)\r\n\r\nON THE TEMPERATURE AND DENSITY OF THE SURFACE-WATER OF THE ESTUARIES OF\r\n     THE REWA RIVER IN FIJI, AND OF THE GUAYAQUIL RIVER IN ECUADOR\r\n\r\n(a) _The Rewa Estuary._—My observations were made mostly in the warm,\r\nwet seasons, from October to January, 1897-99, and generally in the\r\nvicinity of the Roman Catholic Mission. The density varied usually\r\nbetween 1·000 and 1·010, the water being quite fresh after heavy rains\r\ninland. Though the density was usually greatest at high water, this was\r\nby no means always the case. The temperature of the water in dry weather\r\nvaried from 79° to 84° F. With the river in flood after heavy rains it\r\nfell to 75° and 76°. As a rule, the fresher the water the lower the\r\ntemperature, but this was not invariable. There was evidence of\r\nsuper-heating in the estuary, the water there having sometimes a\r\ntemperature of 82° or 83°, when the water higher up the river as far as\r\nViria was two or three degrees cooler, the sea-temperature being 79° to\r\n80°. The average temperature of the water of the estuary during the\r\nseason would be 80 to 81°.\r\n\r\n(b) _The Estuary of the Rio Guayas, also known, as the Guayaquil\r\nRiver._—My observations were made in the last week of February and in\r\nthe first half of March, 1904. Whilst the sea-temperature a few miles\r\noff the Ecuador coast varied from 76° to 80° F., the water of the\r\nestuary from the mouth up to Guayaquil ranged from 79° to 86°, whilst\r\nrather higher up the river the temperature was about 79° or 80°. The\r\nsuper-heating of the estuary is thus directly indicated. It was well\r\nmarked in the lower part of the estuary during one of my ascents of the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n _Surface-temperatures of estuary of the Guayaquil River, March 13, 1904,\r\n                   11 a.m. to 4 p.m.; tide running up._\r\n\r\n   Sea-temperature 5-10 miles off the mouth                      79·7\r\n   Estuary-temperature at the mouth, off Puna                    82·7\r\n   Estuary-temperature  3 miles above Puna                       84·4\r\n   Estuary-temperature 15 miles above Puna                       86·5\r\n   Estuary-temperature 25 miles above Puna                       82·5\r\n   Estuary-temperature off Guayaquil                             81·8\r\n\r\nThe water of the estuary was, as a rule, cooler with the ebbing tide.\r\n\r\nThe density of the estuary-water at the mouth opposite Puna during the\r\ntwo days the ship was in quarantine ranged from 1·004 to 1·016, being\r\ngenerally about 1·010, and salter with the up-going tide. Off Guayaquil\r\nthe water during the ebbing tide was quite fresh and, from an Ecuadorian\r\nstandpoint only, potable, whilst at high water it may be a little\r\nbrackish. The sea-water has much freer access to the channels in the\r\nmangrove-district at the back of the city of Guayaquil, where at high\r\nwater I found the density to be 1·014.\r\n\r\nOff Puna, on Feb. 25, I noticed that the surface-current which was\r\nrunning down the stream was from one to two fathoms deep, whilst below\r\nit was a strong current running up the river which carried my\r\nthermometer up against the surface-current.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 39 (page 82)\r\n\r\n                 ON THE PACIFIC SPECIES OF STRONGYLODON\r\n\r\nHillebrand in his _Hawaiian Flora_, following Seemann, regards S.\r\nlucidum, Seem., and S. ruber, Vogel, as one species found in Fiji,\r\nHawaii, and Tahiti, and by the former placed also in Ceylon. Hillebrand\r\nand Seemann are followed by Drake del Castillo as regards the Tahitian\r\nspecies. Taubert, in his monograph on the Leguminosæ (Engler’s _Pflanz.\r\nFam._, Teil 3, Abth. 3, 1894), takes the same view of the Polynesian\r\nspecies and of its wide distribution. However, in the _Genera Plantarum_\r\nand in the _Index Kewensis_, the Asiatic and Polynesian species have\r\nbeen always kept apart. The two species of the genus mentioned in the\r\nfirst work are increased to five in the _Index Kewensis_, viz., one in\r\nFiji (S. lucidum), one in Hawaii (S. ruber), two in Madagascar, and one\r\nin the Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 40 (page 88)\r\n\r\n                  PRECAUTIONS IN TESTING SEED-BUOYANCY\r\n\r\nMany seeds and fruits require a few hours’ soaking before they sink; and\r\nwhen small they will rest a long time on the surface of still water, but\r\na touch with the finger or a drop of water will send them to the bottom.\r\nA few will float a few days (3 or 4) before sinking; but such are\r\nincluded in the non-buoyant group. Only in rare cases does prolonged\r\ndrying increase the period of flotation by more than a few days,\r\nexamples being given at the end of the Table of Buoyancy results under\r\nNote 10. Adherent air-bubbles, a common cause of adventitious buoyancy,\r\nmust always be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 41 (page 91)\r\n\r\n THE BUOYANCY OF THE SEEDS OF CONVOLVULUS SOLDANELLA IN FRESH WATER AND\r\n                           SEA-WATER COMPARED\r\n\r\nThe experiments were commenced at the close of September, 1894, and\r\ncovered six months. At the end of this period in Mr. Millett’s\r\nexperiment, 56 per cent. of the seeds were afloat in fresh water, and 62\r\nper cent. in sea-water; whilst in my own experiment 72 per cent. floated\r\nin fresh water, and 65 per cent. in sea-water. I was indebted to Mr.\r\nMillett’s courtesy for the seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 42 (page 96)\r\n\r\n                   ON SECULAR CHANGES IN SEA-DENSITY\r\n\r\nExact data bearing on this subject are not at my disposal; but it would\r\nseem that geologists have formed conflicting conclusions from similar\r\npremises. There is the view that the composition of the ocean water was\r\nvery different in early geological periods (_Encycl. Brit._, x., 221);\r\nbut I should imagine that the character of the crustacean fauna of those\r\nseas would negative any great divergence from the present condition.\r\nSuess implies that the ancient seas carried the same minerals in\r\nsolution that they do now, and it is to be inferred in a similar\r\nproportion (E. de Margerie’s French edition of _Das Antlitz der Erde_,\r\nii., 343 and 345).\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 43 (page 102)\r\n\r\n      ON THE MUCOSITY OF SMALL SEEDS AND SEED-LIKE FRUITS WHEN WET\r\n\r\nI paid considerable attention to this subject from the standpoint of\r\ndispersal some years ago, and published most of the results in _Science\r\nGossip_ for Sept., 1894. This peculiar quality of seeds had been noticed\r\nby Dr. Kerner in his _Pflanzenleben_ (vol. i., 1887-91), and was\r\nregarded as illustrating a mode of dispersal of seeds by adherence. As a\r\nrule, such seeds when placed in water become coated with mucus in a few\r\nminutes, or within an hour, and when allowed to dry on feathers they\r\nadhere as firmly as if gummed. I found that this quality is not affected\r\nby prolonged drying, as in the cases of Nepeta glechoma and Salvia\r\nverbenaca, where it was exhibited to the same degree after the seed-like\r\nfruits had been kept from one to three years. I especially tested about\r\n110 British plants that were likely to display this quality, and found\r\nthat about a dozen exhibited it in a marked degree, and if to these we\r\nadd those plants with seeds that display it to a limited extent so that\r\nthey merely become adhesive when wetted, the total would be nearly\r\ntwenty. It will be noticed from the list subjoined that the plants\r\nshowing marked mucosity belong to twenty genera and to ten families, the\r\nLabiatæ and Cruciferæ predominating. Although in some genera, like\r\nPlantago, there is reason to suppose that the seeds of all the species\r\nwould behave in this fashion, it would be wrong to infer that this is\r\nusually the case, six genera being indicated below to which such a rule\r\nwould not apply, and doubtless the number could be extended. These\r\nplants in England mostly occur at the roadside, on waste ground, and in\r\ndry meadows. It may be added that although in most cases the seeds\r\nappear in water to emit mucus, “exuded mucilage” being the expression\r\nused in the English edition of Kerner’s work, in some instances, as with\r\nHelianthemum vulgare, there appears to be a dissolving process affecting\r\nthe outer seed-covering.\r\n\r\nI. _Plants with Seeds or Seed-like Fruits that emit Mucus to a Marked\r\n  Degree when placed in Water._\r\n\r\n Arabis thaliana, G.

In all but\r\nCerbera Odollam, where I contented myself with establishing that the\r\nfruits floated buoyantly in sea-water, the experiments were prolonged\r\nfor many weeks and often for several months; and in some cases, as with\r\nIpomœa pes capræ, three or four experiments were made on seeds from\r\ndifferent inland localities. The result was to establish in all cases\r\nthat the floating powers were as great with the inland as with the coast\r\nplants of the same species; nor could any structural difference of\r\nimportance be noticed. It should be observed that there is every reason\r\nto believe that the “talasinga” plains of Fiji have been occupied by the\r\nintruding beach-plants for many ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 45 (page 122)\r\n\r\n    TABULATED RESULTS OF THE CLASSIFICATION, ACCORDING TO SCHIMPER’S\r\n APPLICATION OF THE NATURAL SELECTION THEORY, OF THE BUOYANT SEEDS AND\r\n FRUITS OF THE TROPICAL LITTORAL PLANTS ON THE BASIS OF THE STRUCTURAL\r\n                    CHARACTERS CONCERNED IN BUOYANCY\r\n\r\n Column headings:\r\n\r\n #: Number.\r\n %: Per cent.\r\n A: Percentage of non-adaptive species.\r\n B: Percentage of adaptive species.\r\n\r\n +------------------+-----------------------------+---------------+--------+\r\n |                  |  Classification of species. |               |        |\r\n |                  +-------------------+---------+ Proportion of | Total  |\r\n |                  |   Non-adaptive.   |Adaptive.| non-adaptive  | number |\r\n |                  +---------+---------+---------+ and adaptive  |  of    |\r\n |     Region.      |  First  | Second  |  Third  |   species.    | species|\r\n |                  |  group. | group.  |  group. |               | dealt  |\r\n |                  +----+----+----+----+----+----+-------+-------+ with.  |\r\n |                  |  # |  % |  # |  % |  # |  % |   A   |   B   |        |\r\n +------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+-------+-------+--------+\r\n |Pacific Islands   | 27 | 40 | 10 | 15 | 30 | 45 |  55   |  45   |   67   |\r\n |                  |    |    |    |    |    |    |       |       |        |\r\n |Pacific Islands,  |    |    |    |    |    |    |       |       |        |\r\n |tropical America, |    |    |    |    |    |    |       |       |        |\r\n |and Indo-Malaya   | 28 | 35 | 12 | 15 | 40 | 50 |  50   |  50   |   80   |\r\n +------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+-------+-------+--------+\r\n\r\nNOTE.—If to the last we add the eight British shore plants, the buoyant\r\nfruits of which are described in Chapter XII., three non-adaptive and\r\nfive adaptive, we get a proportion of adaptive species for temperate and\r\ntropical regions of fifty-one per cent.

In that case, the table can be\r\nused for the numerical results of the three groups which are based only\r\non structural characters without reference to any theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 46 (page 124)\r\n\r\n         ON THE MODES OF DISPERSAL OF THE GENUS BRACKENRIDGEA.\r\n\r\nSeed-vessels of this genus found afloat in the New Guinea drift are\r\ndescribed by Mr. Hemsley as having two curved cavities crossing each\r\nother one containing a seed, the other empty. “This empty cavity,” it is\r\nstated “gives the fruit its buoyancy” (_Bot. Chall. Exped._, iii., 289;\r\nplate 54) Dr. Beccari, in the English edition of his _Wanderings in\r\nBorneo_, p. 187, speaks of the closed air-containing cavities in the\r\nseed-vessels, or rather “stones,” of this genus as probably giving them\r\nbuoyancy and thus enabling them to be dispersed by currents. He points\r\nout that the fleshy covering of these fruits would also aid their\r\ndispersal by birds. The Italian botanist implies that the two Bornean\r\nspecies grow in swamps. The Fijian species, as observed by me in flower\r\nin Vanua Levu, grew in the dry talasinga districts bordering the\r\nMathuata coast, the locality where Seemann found the plant. One of the\r\nmost recent accounts of the genus is given by Van Tieghem in his memoir\r\non the Ochnaceæ in _Ann. des. Sci. Nat. Bot._, tome 16, 1902. According\r\nto him there are nine species, all from Malaya and New Guinea, with the\r\nexception of one in Fiji. Previous authors have also referred to\r\nQueensland and Zanzibar species. However, all the species have a limited\r\ndistribution, a fact which plainly assigns to birds the principal share\r\nin the dispersal of the genus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 47 (page 125)\r\n\r\n                 ON THE TRANSPORT OF GOURDS BY CURRENTS\r\n\r\nSmall calabashes or bottle-gourds are not uncommonly to be found\r\nfloating in the Fijian estuaries and stranded on the beaches; and I have\r\nalso found them in the sea off the coasts. They are usually more or less\r\nglobular, 3 or 4 inches across, and are evidently able to float for very\r\nlong periods and to carry the seeds unharmed. Most of those I examined\r\nfrom the drift were dry inside and contained the seeds dried together\r\ninto a loose ball about an inch in size. The seeds are not those figured\r\nin Gaertner’s _De Fructibus et Seminibus_, as belonging to Lagenaria\r\nvulgaris, and more resemble those of Cucurbita, but are non-buoyant. One\r\nof these gourds, picked up by me in the sea in Fiji, was placed in\r\nsea-water, and two months later was still floating buoyantly. After\r\nbeing then kept dry for seven months, it was broken open; and ten of the\r\nseeds were put in soil, two of them germinating in a few days.\r\n\r\nIn Ecuador gourds similar in size and shape were frequently observed by\r\nme floating in the drift of the Guayaquil River and stranded on the\r\nsea-beaches. The seeds are similarly caked together in a loose mass in\r\nthe cavity of the fruit. Their characters indicate that they belong to\r\nanother species of gourd; and they differ also from the Fijian seeds in\r\ntheir buoyancy, some of them in my experiments floating two months and\r\nafterwards germinating.\r\n\r\nIt has been known since the days of Ström and Gunnerus, two Norwegian\r\nnaturalists of the 17th century, that gourds and calabashes are from\r\ntime to time stranded with other Gulf-stream drift on the coasts of\r\nNorway. We learn from Sernander that those found are usually worked\r\ncalabashes; but he alludes to one that was unworked and contained\r\nseveral seeds (see Sernander, p. 119).\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely likely that a seed-carrying gourd stranded on a beach\r\nwould be able to establish the plant without the aid of man; but it\r\nseems highly probable that gourds have often been introduced into new\r\ncountries by the currents and that man has afterwards cultivated them.\r\nThese plants may be contrasted with that remarkable Cucurbit, Luffa\r\ninsularum, a genuine littoral plant, the seeds of which, and not the\r\nfruits, are dispersed in the Pacific by the currents (see page 426).\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 48 (page 126)\r\n\r\n ON THE USELESS DISPERSAL BY CURRENTS OF THE FRUITS OF THE OAK (QUERCUS\r\n  ROBUR) AND OTHER SPECIES OF QUERCUS, AND ALSO OF THE HAZEL (CORYLUS\r\n                               AVELLANA)\r\n\r\nThe fruits of different species of Quercus are of not infrequent\r\noccurrence in the seed-drift both of the temperate and tropical regions,\r\nbeing brought down by the rivers to the sea and then stranded on the\r\nneighbouring beaches. They were amongst the drift gathered by Mr.\r\nMoseley in the open sea, 70 miles off the New Guinea coast (_Bot. Chall.\r\nExped._, iv., 294). I found them on the beaches of Keeling Atoll where\r\nno oak exists, and on the beaches of the south coast of Java; whilst\r\nProf. Schimper noticed them among the stranded drift of the Java Sea,\r\nand Prof. Penzig found them stranded on the shores of Krakatoa. They\r\nalso came under my notice on the Sicilian beaches and on the Italian\r\ncoast at Cumæ. Those of Quercus robur are to be found on the English\r\nbeaches and in the autumn drift of the Thames, but they soon sink and\r\ndisappear from river-drift. They are referred to by Dr. Sernander as\r\nfrozen with other floating seeds in the ice of the Scandinavian rivers;\r\nbut he evidently does not regard them as possessing much independent\r\nfloating power.\r\n\r\nSome years ago the author made a number of experiments on the buoyancy\r\nof the acorns of Quercus robur, and he formed the conclusion that when\r\nfreshly collected not more than 4 to 8 per cent. of mature fruits will\r\nfloat in fresh-water, and not more than about 10 to 12 per cent. in\r\nsea-water, but that in either case they all sink in a day or two.\r\nImmature acorns float much longer, and it is these that mostly figure in\r\nthe drift. However, unlike most fruits of little initial buoyancy the\r\nmature fruits gain considerable floating power by drying. Of some that\r\nhad been kept for seven months 20 per cent. floated after four weeks in\r\nsea-water and 15 per cent. after 10 weeks.... It may be added that,\r\naccording to Thuret, the fruits of Quercus ilex have little or no\r\nfloating power.\r\n\r\nThe buoyancy of the fruits of Quercus is due entirely to the cavity left\r\nby the shrinking of the kernel. I never remember to have found one with\r\na sound seed amongst the drift in England and Sicily; and I should doubt\r\nmuch whether those in the tropical drift retain their germinating\r\npowers. But, apart from this, the genus Quercus finds in its own\r\nconstitution or habit the greatest obstacle in most species to the\r\nadoption of a littoral station. However, there are exceptional\r\ntendencies displayed by the evergreen oaks; and this is very\r\nsignificant, since in their xerophilous leaves they possess the\r\npreliminary qualification for a station near the sea. Quercus ilex, it\r\nis well known, shows a partiality for the sea-air, and Q. virens, the\r\n“live oak,” flourishes near the sea in the southern states of America, a\r\nmaritime variety being distinguished by botanists. One of the\r\nwillow-oaks of America, Q. phellos, which grows in swampy land, also has\r\na beach variety.\r\n\r\nThe Hazel-tree (Corylus avellana) must be placed in the same category\r\nwith Quercus. I found the empty nuts commonly amongst the stranded drift\r\nof the Sicilian and English beaches. The fruits were also frequently\r\nnoticed by Dr. Sernander in the Scandinavian sea-drift; but he says\r\nnothing of their empty condition. Mr. Darwin remarks, in the _Origin of\r\nSpecies_, that he found that fresh hazel-nuts sank, but that after\r\ndrying a long time they floated for ninety days and subsequently\r\ngerminated. The floating-power is no doubt due to the cavity arising\r\nfrom the shrinking of the kernel, and it is to this cause that Dr.\r\nSernander attributed the slight initial buoyancy observed by him.\r\nHowever, the hazel, like the common oak, lacks the habit that would fit\r\nit for a station by the sea, and, whatever capacity its fruits may\r\npossess for dispersal by currents, it is quite useless for the spread of\r\nthe species.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 49 (page 131)\r\n\r\n  ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF IPOMŒA PES CAPRÆ, CONVOLVULUS SOLDANELLA, AND\r\n                           CONVOLVULUS SEPIUM\r\n\r\nWhilst Ipomœa pes capræ is cosmopolitan in the tropical zones,\r\nConvolvulus soldanella is cosmopolitan in both the north and south\r\ntemperate zones; but, as might be expected, the two species at times\r\nmeet and their areas overlap. Thus, according to Mr. Cheeseman (_Trans.\r\nNew Zealand Inst._, xx., 1887), they meet in the Kermadec Islands, in\r\nthe South Pacific, in about latitude 30°. From my observations on the\r\ncoast of Chile it would seem that C. soldanella in its northward\r\nextension fails somewhere between Valparaiso and Coquimbo, that is to\r\nsay, between 33° and 30° S. lat. Gay merely refers to the plant as\r\nexisting in North Chile, which in his time would include the coast\r\nbetween 33° and 24° S. lat. It intrudes within the “thirties” on the\r\ncoast of California and is found in Madeira in about 33° N. lat. Ipomœa\r\npes capræ in its turn extends into subtropical regions, being recorded\r\nfrom the Kermadecs, as above noted, and from the Bermudas in 32° N. lat.\r\nOwing probably to special physical conditions of the coast, which are\r\nreferred to in Chapter XXXII., this plant is evidently limited to the\r\ntropics on the west coast of South America. It did not come under my\r\nnotice on the beaches of North Chile, and it is apparently not mentioned\r\nby Gay in his work on the Chilian flora.\r\n\r\nConvolvulus sepium, the frequent inland associate of the littoral C.\r\nsoldanella over the temperate regions of the globe, belongs to the same\r\nsection of the genus (Calystegia). Its extraordinary occurrence by\r\nitself in the island of St. Paul, in the Southern Ocean, about fifty\r\nyards from the shore (_Bot. Chall. Exped._, ii., 153, 264), almost\r\nsuggests that we have here a dimorphic species with a littoral and an\r\ninland form; and its existence in the Azores is in this connection very\r\nremarkable. It may be here noted that of three plants raised from seeds\r\nfound in the beach-drift near Palermo two had the foliage of C. sepium\r\nand one of C. soldanella. Perhaps one of my readers, in imitation of De\r\nVries with Œnothera, might be able to settle this point by raising some\r\nhundreds of seedlings from the seeds of the beach species. It is\r\npossible that the relation between these two species of Convolvulus may\r\nbe in some respects akin to that between Cæsalpinia Bonducella and C.\r\nBonduc, two littoral plants that accompany each other over much of the\r\ntropical zone.\r\n\r\nThe student of dispersal will, however, find some curious gaps in the\r\ndistribution of Convolvulus soldanella even in the temperate regions;\r\nand it will be curious to observe how they affect the distribution of C.\r\nsepium. He will have to answer the query of De Candolle:... “Admitting,\r\nif one wishes, that the currents have transported this marine species,\r\nhow comes it that it chances to be in the Pacific and in Europe, without\r\noccurring on the east coasts of America and on the east and west coasts\r\nof Africa?” (_Geographie Botanique_, ii., 1056). He will have to explain\r\nwhy some botanists give C. soldanella a habitat in the tropics, as in\r\nthe Indian region. Schimper, who investigated this point, says that he\r\narrived at no certain result (p. 127). See Notes 13 and 41 and pages 29,\r\n91, for further remarks on these two species of Convolvulus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        NOTE 50 (pages 79, 132)\r\n\r\n        ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE SEEDS AND FRUITS OF BARRINGTONIA\r\n\r\nAs regards the fruits and their coverings, the littoral and inland\r\nspecies of Fiji evidently fall into different sections, the first named\r\n(B. speciosa and B. racemosa) being distinguished by their outer fibrous\r\nhusk, to which the buoyancy is due, the last-named (B. edulis and an\r\nundescribed species) possessing a hard stone surrounding the seed, and\r\nhere the fruits sink or float only for limited periods.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of B. edulis have an outer almost fleshy covering, a little\r\nfibrous at the outside, and the hard ligneous “stone,” containing an\r\nedible seed, requires a hammer to break it. They float heavily for three\r\nor four weeks, whereas those of the littoral species float for many\r\nmonths. In the case of another inland species found by me growing as a\r\nsmall tree 12 feet high on the slopes of Mount Seatura in Vanua Levu at\r\nan elevation of 1,000 feet above the sea, the seed was similarly\r\nprotected by a hard “stone” that could only be broken with an axe, and\r\nthe fruit was non-buoyant, with thin and perishable outer coats.\r\n\r\nThis mountain species of Fiji, which I may name Barringtonia seaturæ,\r\nhas the general habit of B. racemosa, with which the natives persisted\r\nin linking it; whilst the fruit and foliage come nearer to those of B.\r\nedulis. The leaves are entire, taper at the base, and have a petiole 1\r\ninch long. The fruits are oblong, at least 3 inches in length, and are\r\nobscurely angled.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from Schimper’s description (p. 173) that the fruits of\r\nthe Malayan Barringtonia excelsa possess both the hard stone-shell of\r\nthe inland Fijian species and the dry air-bearing fibrous husk of the\r\nlittoral species. This is of special interest, since the tree is both a\r\ncoast and an inland species.\r\n\r\nThe following notes on the structure of the seeds of Barringtonia were\r\nmade whilst I was drifting about in my canoe in the creeks of the Rewa\r\ndelta in Fiji; and whatever may be their deficiencies they have the\r\nmerit of having been written in the home of the plants.... When we cut\r\nacross a seed like that of B. racemosa or B. speciosa, we observe that\r\nthe different parts of the embryo are indistinguishable, being united\r\ninto a homogeneous, firm, fleshy mass. But if we look closely we notice\r\na central fusiform portion marked out from the surrounding parts by a\r\nfaint line, along which a delicate membrane of vascular tissue has been\r\ndeveloped. When “germination” begins, though, as the reader will\r\nsubsequently perceive, this term is here hardly appropriate, the real\r\nnature of this singular structure becomes more apparent, as is indicated\r\nin the accompanying figure. The central fusiform portion proves to be\r\nthe young plant without cotyledons and growing at either end to form the\r\nroot and the stem. The delicate investing membrane becomes thicker and\r\nmore apparent as germination proceeds, extending upwards and downwards\r\nwith the growth of the stem and root and forming a cortical covering in\r\neither case. The investing fleshy portion of the seed, which is now\r\nseparable with the fingers, remains attached to the lower part of the\r\nseedling for some time, being evidently a source of nutriment, and gives\r\na bulbous appearance to the young plant. Young bulbous plants of B.\r\nracemosa, 1 to 2 feet high, are very common on the edge of Fijian\r\nmangrove swamps where the parent tree thrives. The seedlings of B.\r\nspeciosa have the same appearance, but the outer fleshy part of the bulb\r\nis not so thick.\r\n\r\n                                                    [_To face page 574._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _B. racemosa._, _B. speciosa._]\r\n\r\nDiagrams illustrating the structure of the growing seeds of Barringtonia\r\n(two-thirds the natural size). That of B. speciosa represents a seed\r\nremoved from a fruit displaying the young plant protruding two or three\r\ninches. That of B. racemosa represents the lower end of the seedling\r\nwhen the plant is eighteen inches high.\r\n\r\n _a_ = the exorhiza.\r\n _b_ = the neorhiza invested by the medullary sheath.\r\n\r\nThis structure of the seeds of Barringtonia speciosa and of B. racemosa\r\nwas for a long time meaningless to me, until one day, whilst seated on\r\nthe banks of the Lower Rewa, with a number of the sected seeds and\r\nbulbous seedlings gathered around, I reflected that the fruits of the\r\nlatter species that floated past me in the river-drift were nearly\r\nalways germinating. This called up “vivipary” to my mind; and as I\r\nlooked at the Rhizophora seedlings dangling from the branches of the\r\nmangrove-trees close by, it occurred to me that this seed-structure\r\nmight be the result of a lost viviparous habit. One apparently had to\r\ndeal here not with an ordinary seed containing an embryo in the midst of\r\nalbumen, but with a seed in an arrested stage of germination surrounded\r\nby a body that might perhaps prove homologous with the “cotyledonary\r\nbody” of Rhizophora. The process of development that goes on without a\r\nbreak in Rhizophora, from the fertilisation of the ovule to the\r\ndetachment of the seedling from the branch, was here, as I considered,\r\narrested after germination had begun, but before the protrusion of the\r\nseedling from the fruit. With nearly all plants, as I reflected, there\r\nis a rest-stage of varying length, which might be called the seed-stage.\r\nWith the mangrove-genera, Rhizophora and Bruguiera, I had convinced\r\nmyself by a long series of observations, the results of which are given\r\nin Chapter XXX., that this rest-stage does not exist. It occurs, I\r\nargued, in Barringtonia, but only after germination has begun, and,\r\ntherefore, displaced when compared with the typical seed-stage of most\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it may be noted that a difference in germinating\r\nbehaviour might be expected between the two shore species on account of\r\ntheir difference in stations, Barringtonia speciosa growing on the sandy\r\nbeach, and B. racemosa in the wet ground around a mangrove-swamp. There\r\nis a strong suspicion that the rest-stage in B. racemosa is very short,\r\nthough I never found germination in progress on a tree (see Note 37).\r\nThere is no doubt, on the other hand, that the rest-stage of B. speciosa\r\nis often, as with most other plants, very long. This, then, was my\r\nlesson from the Barringtonia fruits on the banks of the Rewa, and the\r\nquestion arose whether this interpretation of these curious\r\nseed-structures accorded with the opinion formed of their nature by\r\nbotanists.\r\n\r\nCurious seed-structures of this kind must have their significance in the\r\nhistory of the plant; and on returning to England I looked a little\r\nfurther into the matter. To follow up this kind of inquiry, however,\r\nwould carry me far beyond the limits prescribed for this note, and I\r\nhave only treated it here in a tentative fashion. Different botanists of\r\neminence have paid attention to this subject, amongst them Roxburgh,\r\nThomson, and Miers (see Dr. T. Thomson in _Journ. Linn. Soc. Bot._, vol.\r\nii., p. 47, 1858, and Mr. J. Miers in _Trans. Linn. Soc. Bot._, vol. i.,\r\n1880). It would appear that the seed-structure of Barringtonia is also\r\nfound in Careya, a genus of the same Myrtaceous tribe, and in Garcinia\r\nand other genera of the Guttiferæ, as well as in other inland plants.\r\n\r\nMr. Miers, after reviewing the opinions of his predecessors, gives the\r\nresults of his own investigations. The solid embryo found in\r\nBarringtonia and many other genera consists, he observes, (_a_) of an\r\nexternal portion, the “exorhiza,” which nourishes the germinating seed\r\nand then dies away; (_b_) of an internal portion, the “neorhiza,” which,\r\ngrowing at each end, forms the central portion of the stem and root; and\r\n(_c_) the “medullary sheath” of Mirbel, that lies between the two, and\r\nis composed of elementary vascular tissue, which ultimately gives origin\r\nto the wood, bark, and leaves of the stem and yields woody fibre to the\r\nroot. The exorhizal portion in some cases, as in Barringtonia\r\nacutangula, splits into four parts during germination. Mr. Miers\r\ncompares this seed-structure with that of Rhizophora, employing the same\r\nterms, “neorhiza” for the internal portion which forms the seedling, and\r\n“exorhiza” for the external portion which merely nourishes it. However,\r\nI may add that the exorhizal portion in Rhizophora, as shown in Chapter\r\nXXX., is now regarded as formed by the coalesced cotyledons, and is\r\ntermed the “cotyledonary body”; so that by implication the corresponding\r\npart of a Barringtonia seed should be regarded from the same standpoint.\r\n\r\nIt may be apposite to notice here that Barringtonia racemosa displays\r\none capacity which does not appear to belong to B. speciosa. The\r\nbranches stuck in wet soil throw out roots and establish themselves.\r\nThis capacity of vegetative reproduction is turned to account by the\r\nFijians, who make “live-fences” of this tree in wet localities.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 51 (page 135)\r\n\r\n       ON A COMMON INLAND SPECIES OF SCÆVOLA IN VANUA LEVU, FIJI\r\n\r\nThis is a tall shrub, or small tree, nine or ten feet high, which\r\ncorresponds with S. floribunda, Gray, as far as Seemann describes it. It\r\nhas small, black, juicy drupes, well suited for dispersal by birds,\r\nhaving no “suberous” mesocarp as in the shore species (S. Kœnigii), and\r\nno capacity for dispersal by currents. It grows, much like the Hawaiian\r\ninland species, in exposed situations where there is plenty of light, as\r\non mountain-peaks, at the borders of forests, in open-wooded districts,\r\nand in the plains, and is to be found at all elevations from near the\r\nsea up to the highest mountain summit (3,500 feet) when the station is\r\nsuitable. I noticed it on the higher slopes and frequently on the tops\r\nof nearly all the principal mountains that I climbed. It is evident that\r\nbirds carry the “stones” from one mountain-peak to another, and no doubt\r\nthey explain the presence of the species in Tonga. Dr. Seemann speaks of\r\nit as a beach plant in Viti Levu. The plant familiar to me in Vanua Levu\r\nis only on very rare occasions to be seen as an intruder in the\r\nbeach-flora.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          NOTE 52 (page 137).\r\n\r\nON THE CAPACITY FOR DISPERSAL BY CURRENTS OF COLUBRINA OPPOSITIFOLIA, AN\r\n                          INLAND HAWAIIAN TREE\r\n\r\nThe seeds in my experiments sank within ten days; but they are not\r\nreadily detached from the fruit, as in the case of the buoyant seeds of\r\nthe littoral species (C. asiatica). The fruits, which may float for a\r\nweek or two, break down, as Hillebrand observes, tardily and\r\nimperfectly, and could give but little assistance to dispersal by water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 53 (page 141)\r\n\r\n                         ON THE GENUS ERYTHRINA\r\n\r\nWe have in E. indica a widely distributed littoral species, ranging from\r\nIndia through Malaya to eastern Australia, and over nearly all the\r\ngroups of the Pacific, reaching to Tahiti and the Marquesas, but not\r\noccurring in Hawaii. It is associated in Fiji and Tonga with another\r\nshore-species, E. ovalifolia, Roxb., found also in India and Malaya. I\r\ndid not come on the second species in Fiji, and according to Seemann it\r\nis rare. It is possible that there is a genetic connection between the\r\ntwo; and it is noteworthy that in one case Seemann was uncertain (p.\r\n426) whether the species was E. ovalifolia or only a variety of E.\r\nindica.\r\n\r\nIn different parts of their areas both these species may be found\r\ninland. This no doubt is to be connected with their occasional\r\ncultivation. The Polynesians who esteem E. indica for its handsome\r\nscarlet flowers and its scarlet seeds often plant it near their houses;\r\nbut it is curious that if we look at the pages of Seemann, Horne, and\r\none or two other botanical authors who have written on the Pacific, we\r\nfind no reference to its littoral station, the first-named botanist\r\nmerely characterising it in Fiji as occurring “wild or planted.”\r\n\r\nHowever, in various localities in Fiji, as on the shores of Natewa Bay\r\nin Vanua Levu, Erythrina indica thrives as a characteristic beach tree.\r\nDr. Reinecke speaks of it as widely spread on the Samoan coasts; and the\r\nFrench botanists refer to it as a tree of the Tahitian beaches. Prof.\r\nSchimper frequently mentions the two littoral species of Erythrina as\r\namongst the components of the Malayan strand-flora. Dr. Treub, when he\r\nvisited Krakatoa in 1886, three years after the eruption, noticed some\r\nyoung plants of Erythrina growing on the shore; whilst Prof. Penzig in\r\n1897 found that both E. indica and E. ovalifolia had established\r\nthemselves on the beach. Mr. Kurz again is quoted by Prof. Schimper (p.\r\n170) as including E. indica amongst the “beach-jungle” of Pegu.\r\n\r\nThere is abundant evidence in support of the dispersal of the genus by\r\ncurrents. I have observed the seeds of Erythrina indica on the beaches\r\nof Keeling Atoll. Schimper noted Erythrina seeds amongst the stranded\r\ndrift of the Java Sea. Treub remarked young plants of the genus growing\r\non the shore of Krakatoa three years after the great eruption, and\r\nPenzig places Erythrina indica and E. ovalifolia amongst the\r\nbeach-plants brought to Krakatoa through the agency of the currents. The\r\nseeds of E. indica not infrequently came under my observation stranded\r\non the Fijian beaches and floating in the Rewa estuary; and in an\r\nexperiment made in Fiji they still floated after five months in\r\nsea-water. Mr. Hemsley years ago formed the opinion, from the drift\r\ncollections at Kew, that the genus was dispersed by the currents. I may\r\nhere add in further illustration of this point that Erythrina seeds were\r\nfound by me in South America floating in numbers in the Guayaquil\r\nestuary and stranded on the beaches of Ecuador.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that, unlike some of the other shore-plants, Erythrina\r\nindica has at least three sets of names in the South Pacific. Thus it is\r\nknown as Rara and Ndrala in Fiji, Ngatae in Samoa, Futuna, and\r\nRarotonga, Atae in Tahiti, and Kenae in the Marquesas. The Samoan and\r\nTahitian name recalls the Burmese name of Ka-thit, whilst the Marquesan\r\nword is suggestive of the Makassar name Kăne or Kanur. The Hawaiian name\r\nof E. monosperma is Wili-wili, which evidently has arisen from the\r\nscrew-like movement of the open pod when thrown into the air. The same\r\nname in the form of Wiri-wiri is applied for a similar reason to\r\nGyrocarpus Jacquini in Fiji. It is possible that the Polynesians have\r\nassisted the dispersal of the coast-species (E. indica); but the\r\ncurrents could have performed the distribution unaided, and the variety\r\nof aboriginal names is not in favour of human intervention.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the possible extermination by insects of Erythrina in\r\nHawaii, it has been before remarked (p. 143) that this would not account\r\nfor the survival of an inland species, such as E. monosperma in Hawaii.\r\nHowever, this species since the occupation of that group by the white\r\nman is on the road to extinction. Dr. Hillebrand observes that the\r\nspecies was much more common formerly than in his time (1851-1871), a\r\nresult evidently due to the ravages of the common tropical mealy bug, a\r\npest of relatively modern introduction (see Koebele in Stubb’s\r\n_Agricultural Report on Hawaii_). It may be added here that Cordia\r\nsubcordata, a littoral tree, had been almost exterminated by the ravages\r\nof a small moth even in Dr. Hillebrand’s time. During my examination of\r\nthe coasts of the large island of Hawaii, in 1896-7, I was shown several\r\nplaces not long before occupied by this tree; and, as indicated in Note\r\n29, it only came under my notice in a few localities.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 54 (page 145)\r\n\r\n                         ON THE GENUS CANAVALIA\r\n\r\nOf the three maritime species, C. obtusifolia, D.C., occurs on beaches\r\nall round the tropical zone. I was familiar with it on North Keeling\r\nIsland in the Indian Ocean, in Fiji, and in Ecuador. C. ensiformis,\r\nD.C., is just as widely spread; but it is both inland and maritime in\r\nits station, and except when collecting it in the Solomon Islands I have\r\nhad but little acquaintance with it. C. sericea (Gray) is a\r\ncharacteristic beach-plant in Fiji, but is infrequent. In Rarotonga,\r\naccording to Cheeseman, it is a common littoral plant. It was also found\r\nin Tahiti by Banks and Solander, and is seemingly peculiar to the\r\nPacific islands.\r\n\r\nBesides C. ensiformis, the other two shore species may at times be found\r\ninland. Thus it is singular that the French botanists do not, as a rule,\r\nspeak of C. sericea as a Tahitian beach plant; and Nadeaud only remarks,\r\nconcerning its station, that it frequents the wooded slopes of the\r\nvalleys of the interior. In North Keeling Island C. obtusifolia\r\npresented itself to me not only as a beach-creeper, its usual habit, but\r\nas a climber over the branches of the coast trees. In one locality in\r\nVanua Levu I found a variety of this species growing on a hill a mile\r\ninland and about 700 feet above the sea. On one of the beaches it\r\napproached C. sericea in some of its characters, as in the form of the\r\ncalyx and in the hairiness.\r\n\r\nAlthough the seeds of C. obtusifolia have long been known to be\r\ndispersed by the currents, having been found in Moseley’s collections of\r\nfloating drift off the New Guinea coast (_Bot. Chall. Exp._, IV, 291),\r\nthey displayed remarkable fickleness when experimented on by me in Fiji.\r\nAs a rule, however, about 10 per cent. sank at once in sea-water, 50 per\r\ncent. floated after three weeks, and 10 per cent. after twelve weeks. Of\r\nseeds that had been kept three years, 50 per cent. floated after eleven\r\nweeks. The seeds are to be found in numbers amongst the stranded drift\r\nof the Fijian and Ecuador beaches, and I noticed them also afloat in the\r\nRewa estuary of Fiji.\r\n\r\nI tested the floating-power of the seeds of C. sericea in Fiji, and\r\nfound that half of them remained afloat after sixty days. On the seeds\r\nof C. ensiformis I have not experimented; but their buoyancy is\r\nindicated by the frequent occurrence of the plant on the Solomon Island\r\ncoral islets (Guppy’s _Solomon Islands_, pp. 290, 292, 296), and\r\nprobably the Canavalia seeds identified at Kew from my drift collections\r\non these islets belong to this species. Schimper (p. 166) refers to the\r\nseeds of a Canavalia in Java that were still afloat after ten weeks.\r\nThese littoral plants are indebted for the floating capacity of the seed\r\nto the buoyant kernel.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     NOTE 55 (page 42 and Note 20)\r\n\r\n                THE INLAND EXTENSION OF SCÆVOLA KŒNIGII\r\n\r\nScævola sericea (Forst.), a hairy variety of this littoral plant, will\r\nprobably prove in some localities to be the inland form of the species.\r\nDr. Reinecke, who mentions only this variety for Samoa, says that it is\r\nfound in very moist ground in river-ravines, and no other station is\r\nreferred to. It would seem that both the glabrous and hairy forms occur\r\nin Hawaii. Dr. Seemann speaks of the hairy variety as littoral in Fiji.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 56 (page 149)\r\n\r\n   ON THE CAPACITY FOR DISPERSAL BY CURRENTS OF SOPHORA TOMENTOSA, S.\r\n                    CHRYSOPHYLLA, AND S. TETRAPTERA\r\n\r\n(1) _Sophora tomentosa, Linn._—The moniliform pods will float for few\r\nweeks, but it is to the seeds liberated by the breaking down of the pod\r\nthat the wide dispersal of this beach-plant by the currents is due. When\r\nexperimenting on the freshly obtained seeds in Fiji I found that\r\nfour-fifths of them floated after three months in sea-water. With seeds\r\nthat had been kept for three years, half floated after twelve months and\r\nretained their sound condition. The seeds owe their floating power to\r\nthe buoyant kernel.\r\n\r\n(2) _Sophora chrysophylla, Seem._—The dry pods of this Hawaiian mountain\r\nspecies float between one and two weeks in sea-water, but being brittle\r\nthey readily break down and the seeds escape. The seeds have no buoyancy\r\neven after drying for four years.\r\n\r\n(3) _Sophora tetraptera, Ait._, from the coast of Chile.—After floating\r\nfrom ten to fourteen days in sea-water, the dry pods become sodden and\r\nbegin to break up, the seeds escaping. Since, however, the pods tend to\r\ndecay and break open on the tree they would not be available for\r\ndispersal by currents. Out of a number of freshly gathered seeds all\r\nfloated buoyantly after a month in sea-water, when the experiment ended;\r\nand of seeds that had been kept over a year six out of ten floated after\r\nfour months in sea-water, two of them germinating afterwards in soil.\r\nLike those of S. tomentosa the seeds possess buoyant kernels to which\r\nthe floating power is due. On account of the hardness of the tests the\r\nseeds to ensure rapid germination require to be filed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 57 (page 153)\r\n\r\n                       ON THE SPECIES OF OCHROSIA\r\n\r\nSchumann distinguishes the following species:\r\n\r\n(_a_) O. parviflora, Hensl., widely spread in the Pacific islands.\r\n\r\n(_b_) O. compta, Schumann, confined to Hawaii and corresponding to var.\r\nB. of O. sandwicensis as given by Hillebrand.\r\n\r\n(_c_) O. borbonica, Spr., synonym O. oppositifolia, Lam., from Mauritius\r\nand Madagascar to Java and Singapore.\r\n\r\n(_d_){O. sandwicensis, Gray, of Hawaii.    } Both probably varieties of\r\n     {O. elliptica, Lab., of New Caledonia.}   O. borbonica.\r\n\r\n(_e_) O. parviflora, Schumann, of New Guinea, probably identical with O.\r\nmariannensis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 58 (page 156)\r\n\r\n                       ON PANDANUS (from Warburg)\r\n\r\n(a) _The size (length) of the drupes of endemic species in oceanic\r\nislands._—The drupes of P. reineckei of Samoa are 4-5 cm.

Mr. Charles Dixon in _Ibis_ (1885) refers to Sir W.\r\nMilner’s observation in the case of the Fulmar Petrel (Procellaria\r\nglacialis) and speaks of them as Brazilian seeds brought by the Gulf\r\nStream, adding that he himself found a nut in the crop of one of these\r\nbirds in the same locality. He supposes that the birds pick them up from\r\nthe water. Mr. Hemsley very kindly wrote to Sir Joseph Hooker recently\r\non this point with the object of obtaining some idea of the nature of\r\nthe seeds; but after this lapse of time it has not been found possible\r\nto satisfy my curiosity. I live in the hope of their proving to be\r\nCæsalpinia seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 60 (page 202)\r\n\r\n  SCHIMPER ON THE HALOPHILOUS CHARACTER OF LITTORAL LEGUMINOSÆ AND OF\r\n                         SHORE PLANTS GENERALLY\r\n\r\nAs a result of extensive microchemical investigations, this eminent\r\nGerman botanist arrived at the conclusion that plants living on the\r\nsea-shore, or in inland stations rich in chlorides, are able, as a rule,\r\nto store up in their tissues a large quantity of these salts, a capacity\r\nenabling them to live in localities where the subsoil is rich in these\r\nmaterials. This inference, as shown in his experiments, is just as\r\napplicable to the shore-plants of temperate regions, such as Aster\r\ntripolium, Crambe maritima, and Eryngium maritimum, as it is to such\r\ntypical littoral plants of the tropics as Barringtonia speciosa, Ipomœa\r\npes capræ, Scævola Koenigii, Tournefortia argentea, &c. However, with\r\nthe Leguminosæ experimented upon, this capacity of storing up chlorides\r\nwas often exhibited but slightly or not at all; and characteristic\r\nPacific beach-plants, such as Canavalia turgida, Pongamia glabra, and\r\nSophora tomentosa are especially cited as examples (Schimper’s _Ind.\r\nMal. Strand-flora_, pp. 140-151; Wolff’s ash-analyses are here quoted).\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 61 (page 215)\r\n\r\n         METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE SUMMIT OF MAUNA LOA\r\n\r\nThe summit is formed of bare rock and sand, the phanerogamic vegetation\r\nceasing a couple of thousand feet below. Some low plant-forms doubtless\r\noccur under the moist, warm conditions near the steam-cracks, since\r\nWilkes mentions his finding a small moss; but with this exception the\r\nsurface may be described as sterile.\r\n\r\n_Dryness of the Air and Electrical Phenomena._—Wilkes refers to the\r\nassociation of these conditions more than once in his narrative.\r\nWhenever, as sometimes happened, the dew point could not be obtained\r\nwith Pouillet’s hygrometer, electricity was easily excited, and was\r\ndeveloped in large sparks. On taking off the clothes at night, sparks\r\nwould appear. As shown in the table subjoined, electrical phenomena were\r\nnoticed during the first few days of my sojourn on the summit when the\r\nrelative humidity was very low. My red blanket at night crackled in my\r\nhands and emitted sparks, and a glowing line was produced by drawing the\r\nfinger along. Whilst the air was in this condition I observed that the\r\nwings of dead butterflies lying on the ground stuck to my fingers\r\ntenaciously like a needle to a magnet. The adhesiveness disappeared when\r\nthe excessive dryness gave place to humidity. The physiological effect\r\non me of the associated dryness and electrical state of the air was\r\ndisplayed in a hot, dry, sweatless skin (cracking and chapping rapidly),\r\nsevere headache and sore-throat, general lassitude, and great\r\nirritability. When the weather changed and the air became humid, these\r\nunpleasant symptoms quickly disappeared.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these dry conditions on the summit of Mauna Loa,\r\ndecomposition does not occur. I found in one place on the top, on the\r\nsite of an old camp, the remains of a quarter of beef, the meat fresh\r\nbut dried up. From a water-bottle left behind by one of the party and\r\nsubsequently restored to him, I learned that the visit had been made in\r\nthe previous summer. This non-decomposition seems a little strange,\r\nsince, as remarked below, flies and other insects were not infrequent on\r\nthe summit. However, as Hann remarks, when speaking of mountain\r\nclimates, everything dries much more quickly at great altitudes; animals\r\nthat have been shot, or killed by falling, become mummies without\r\nundergoing decay (Schimper’s _Plant-Geography_, 697).... The scorching\r\npower of the sun in a sky usually cloudless, or nearly so, was a trying\r\nfeature of my daily experiences; and I found that when I faced it with\r\nunshaded eyes during my walks I suffered from severe pain in the\r\neyeballs at night.\r\n\r\n_Insects on the Summit._—It may seem a strange thing to relate, that in\r\na region apparently absolutely sterile, the flies and other winged\r\ninsects caused me much discomfort in my small tent when I was confined\r\nto it through illness. When lying down one morning I noticed the\r\nhouse-fly, the blue-bottle, and two or three other flies, small beetles\r\nnot over a fifth of an inch in size, a moth, and a wasp. They were no\r\ndoubt quite happy in the heat, as the temperature inside was over 80°\r\nF., and the sun’s rays felt almost scorching through the thin duck\r\ncanvas. Butterflies (and occasionally large moths) were often observed\r\nflying in a drowsy condition about the summit and were easily caught.\r\nThey were fond of fluttering around the steam-holes. In places, numbers\r\nwere to be seen dead and dried up on the ground, the detached wings\r\nlying about. In the case of a recently dead butterfly I found its\r\ncarcase already attacked by numerous small bugs. The butterflies were\r\nmost frequent when there was a fresh southerly breeze, and were\r\ndoubtless blown up the slopes from the forests below.\r\n\r\nWhymper in his _Travels amongst the Great Andes of the Equator_ gives\r\nmany particulars of the occurrence of insects at great elevations. He\r\nnoticed beetles, diptera, butterflies, moths, and several other insects\r\nat altitudes of 15,000 to 16,000 feet. At 16,500 feet he obtained a\r\nsmall bug of the genus Emesa. He quotes Humboldt and Bonpland as showing\r\nthat insects are transported into the upper regions of the atmosphere\r\n16,000 to 19,000 feet above the sea, and he remarks that the\r\ntransportation of insects by ascending currents of air has occasionally\r\nbeen observed in operation. These facts bear directly on the dispersal\r\nof insects.\r\n\r\n_The Winds._—My tent, which was pitched near the middle of the western\r\nborder of the crater, happened to be situated in the battle-ground of\r\nthe northerly and southerly winds, in a region of gusty winds, fitful\r\nairs, and dead calms. The northerly winds were usually from N.-N.N.W.\r\nand the southerly winds from S.W.-S.S.W., easting in either case being\r\nrarely observed, the northerly winds rather prevailing at night. As a\r\nresult of this location miniature whirlwinds were frequent in the\r\nvicinity of my tent, which carried sand into the air and more than once\r\nthreatened to lift up my tent bodily and carry it off into the crater\r\nbelow. At the north end of the crater-border north-easterly winds\r\nprevailed, and at the south end southerly winds occasionally showing\r\neasting. When on one occasion I walked round the crater-margin, a fresh\r\nsouth-easterly wind prevailed at most parts of the circumference except\r\nin the vicinity of my camp, where there was a light S.S.W. wind both at\r\n8 a.m. and 6 p.m. when I started and returned. The local character of\r\nthe winds was often displayed in my walks. On one occasion, having left\r\nmy camp, where a southerly wind was blowing, and walked half a mile to\r\nthe north, I found a bitterly cold N.N.E. gale in my face which so\r\nimpeded my progress that I returned to my camp where the same southerly\r\nbreeze continued.\r\n\r\nCommodore Wilkes was encamped on the east side of the crater, and there\r\n(December and January) he experienced strong south-west winds, on at\r\nleast three days having the force of a gale. These are the prevailing\r\nwinds in this season over the group; whereas in August, the time of my\r\nsojourn, south-westerly winds are quite out of season, this being in the\r\nmidst of the period of the N.E. trades.\r\n\r\nIt will be gathered from the foregoing remarks that the mere record of\r\nthe winds is insufficient for the purpose of obtaining any definite\r\nnotion of the air-currents at this elevation (13,600 feet). It is to\r\nclose observation of the clouds that we must look for data of\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n_The Clouds._—The clouds on the summit of Mauna Loa were an unending\r\nsource of interest to me, and I will give briefly the results of my\r\nobservations. The highest clouds were wispy cirri, often arranged as in\r\na mackerel sky, and evidently at a great altitude. They were only\r\nobserved on four or five days. (The lower clouds are indicated in the\r\naccompanying diagram.) Below them and at no great height above the\r\nmountain were to be not infrequently observed isolated woolly clouds\r\nthat were carried in a few minutes across the sky and had a brief\r\nexistence, often forming and melting away as one gazed at them. Next,\r\nthere was a heavy bank of cumulus, which formed on the south-west slope\r\nnear the top of the mountain, from which lines of cloud extended along\r\neach flank. Lowest of all was a broad belt, or rather a sea, of cumulus\r\nthat was developed on both sides of the mountain about one-third way\r\ndown its slopes, and during the day-time isolated the peak from the\r\nworld below. It is with the last two cloud formations that we are most\r\nconcerned, and I will first describe the sea of cumulus.\r\n\r\nThe sea of cumulus, as in the case of similar cloud-formations of most\r\nother isolated mountains, when viewed from above, as from the\r\nmountain-top, presents a cloud-field of dazzling whiteness, sparkling in\r\nthe sun. Seen from below, as from the coast, it has the dark lowering\r\nappearance of the rain-cloud and indicates the rain-belt. Disappearing\r\nduring the night, this broad belt begins to form again between 8 and 9\r\na.m., and by 10 or 11 a.m. the lower regions are completely hidden and\r\nthe mountain’s summit, cut off from the world, rises above the level of\r\nthe sea of clouds like an island in an Arctic ocean. As the day\r\nprogresses the clouds become more compact and dense. The usual altitude\r\nof this broad belt of cloud is between 7,000 and 8,000 feet. This level\r\nis indicated by the burying of the Kohala mountains, which rise to a\r\nheight of 5,500 feet in the distant north-west corner of the island, and\r\nby the usual emergence of the highest summit of Hualalai, which rises,\r\nstill nearer, to an elevation of 8,275 feet. On some days, however, it\r\nattains a height of nearly 9,000 feet. On such occasions the highest\r\npeak of Hualalai kept reappearing and disappearing during the day, but\r\nthe distant summit of Haleakala in East Maui, 10,032 feet in elevation\r\nand 80 miles away, was always visible.\r\n\r\nWords fail to describe the magnificent aspect of this sea of cloud which\r\nshuts off the spectator from the world below. From the summit of the\r\nmountain he gazes down on its surface lit up by a sun shining in a\r\ntypically cloudless sky. At one time it appears as an undulating Arctic\r\nland covered with snow of dazzling whiteness. At another time it looks\r\nlike a hummocky frozen Polar sea sparkling in the sunshine. Through\r\noccasional rifts, however, one can discern a dark dismal region of mist\r\nand rain-cloud beneath. Miss Bird, who passed a night on the summit in\r\nJune, 1874, well describes this sea of cloud in her book on the Sandwich\r\nIslands as “all radiance above and drizzling fog below.”\r\n\r\n                                                    [_To face page 585._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram illustrating the prevailing cloud-formations of\r\nMauna Loa during August, 1897.]\r\n\r\nThe heavy bank of cumulus, that forms at noon on the south-west slope at\r\nan altitude of 10,000 to 13,000 feet above the sea, and sometimes rises\r\nabove the mountain, is one of the most conspicuous of the\r\ncloud-phenomena on the summit of Mauna Loa. Apparently extending from\r\nit, but in reality moving towards it, are two lines of small cumuli that\r\nfollow the same level along either flank above the sea of cumulus, as is\r\nindicated in the accompanying diagram. It was observed by Wilkes in\r\nmid-winter, 1840-41, but at a lower level. “Clouds would approach us (he\r\nwrites) from the south-west when we had a strong north-east trade wind\r\nblowing, coming up with their cumulus front reaching the height of about\r\n8,000 feet, spreading horizontally and then disappearing.” During my\r\nsojourn this bank formed a very striking feature in the landscape during\r\nthe early afternoon. On two or three occasions when I visited the south\r\nside of the summit and descended for about a thousand feet I passed\r\nthrough this bank, being then exposed to a driving mist coming up the\r\nslopes from the south-west. Though its upper surface viewed from a\r\ndistance is dazzling white, below it is dark and nimboid.\r\n\r\nIt is to an updraught of warm moist air on the south or south-west\r\nslopes of the mountain, and to the prevailing cool north-east trade that\r\nstrikes the north side of the summit, that we must look for the\r\nexplanation of the development and situation of this bank. Although the\r\ntrade-wind is markedly stronger than the south-west updraught, some of\r\nthe warm, moist, southerly air-currents find their way, as shown by the\r\nobservations at my camp, along the sides of the summit, and a line of\r\ncondensation is produced where they come into contact with the cool air\r\nof the north-east trade as it sweeps past the flanks of the mountain.\r\nSometimes at my camp, when there was a light southerly breeze blowing, I\r\nhave noticed the line of small cumuli moving south along the mountain\r\nside towards the bank of cumulus.... I may remark that on a few days a\r\nsmall bank of cumulus formed under similar conditions on the north-west\r\nside of the summit.\r\n\r\nFrom my study of the clouds I arrived at the conclusion that there were\r\nthree prevailing air-currents on the summit of Mauna Loa:\r\n\r\n(1) The updraught of warm moist air on the south and south-west slopes\r\nof the mountain.\r\n\r\n(2) The north-east trade wind, the upper limit of this air-current being\r\nprobably not far above the summit.\r\n\r\n(3) An upper air-current from the south-east (E.S.E.-S.S.E.), which,\r\nfrom the velocity of the clouds it carried, was often probably not over\r\na couple of thousand feet above the summit. It may be observed that on\r\nthe coast at the base of the southern slope of the mountain in the\r\nmiddle of September, when the wind was N.E. and carried the lower clouds\r\nwith it, the upper clouds were, on several occasions, noticed travelling\r\nin the opposite direction, namely, from the south.\r\n\r\nThe volcano was quiescent during my visit and could have exercised but\r\nlittle influence on the air-currents.\r\n\r\n_The Shadow of the Mountain._—Every morning and evening, in clear\r\nweather, for about twenty minutes after sunrise and before sunset, the\r\nshadow of the mountain was thrown back against the sky of the opposite\r\nhorizon. It seemed as if some Titanic brush, at work in the sky far\r\naway, had painted in the profile of the mountain with a very uncanny\r\nblue. At sunset the peak was the last to disappear. Commodore Wilkes,\r\nwho only records it once, namely, at sunset on the 1st of January,\r\ndescribes it as “a beautiful appearance of the shadow of the mountain\r\nprojected on the eastern sky ... as distinct as possible, its vast dome\r\nseemed to rest on the distant horizon.” This phenomenon is, of course,\r\nwell known in the case of other isolated mountains. According to\r\nMurray’s _Handbook of Southern Italy_ (1892), the correct thing for a\r\nvisitor to Stromboli is to make an early ascent of the cone to observe\r\n“the very curious triangular shadow of the mountain cast by the rising\r\nsun upon the _sea_.” Unfortunately I neglected my opportunity when on\r\nthe island. The shadow of the mountain is also one of the sights of\r\nEtna, a dark-violet, triangular shadow (Baedeker) being thrown at\r\nsunrise over the surface of West Sicily, that is, on the _land_. I saw\r\nthe shadow but imperfectly outlined, as the weather was not favourable\r\nat the time of my ascent. When at Nicolosi, on the south slope of Etna,\r\nI noticed at sunset a faint shadow of the mountain thrown against the\r\neastern sky. I gathered from a short conversation with Prof. Ricco, the\r\ndirector of the Catania Observatory, when I told him of the shadow of\r\nthe Hawaiian mountain, that the interest lay in its projection against\r\nthe sky. It is doubtless akin to the spectre of the Brocken and other\r\nmountain spectres.\r\n\r\n_Some Previous Meteorological Observations on Mauna Loa._—.... Mr.\r\nDouglas, the botanist, who was subsequently found dead in a cattle-pit\r\non Mauna Kea, spent a day on the summit of Mauna Loa in the middle of\r\nJanuary, 1834. He mentions that a little way below the top the\r\nthermometer fell at night to 19° F. The wind on the top was N.W. The air\r\nat 11.20 a.m. was 33°, the hygrometer registering 0·5. He remarks that\r\nthe great dryness of the air was evident without the assistance of the\r\nhygrometer (_Hawaiian Spectator_, vols. I and II, 1838-9).\r\n\r\nCommodore Wilkes, in vol. IV of his _Narrative of the United States\r\nExploring Expedition_, gives the following observations on the\r\ntemperature and winds on the top of Mauna Loa between Dec. 23, 1840, and\r\nJan. 13, 1841. Those on the temperature are incomplete, but they give a\r\nfair idea of the prevailing conditions. The degrees are in Fahrenheit’s\r\nscale.\r\n\r\n Dec. 23, 1840: elevation, 13,190 feet; 3 p.m., 25° F.; strong S.W.\r\n gale; night temperature, 15°.\r\n Dec. 24, 1840: summit (13,600 feet); night minimum, 22°.\r\n Dec. 26, 1840: summit (13,600 feet); violent S.W. gale; night min.,\r\n 17°.\r\n Dec. 27, 1840: summit (13,600 feet); sunrise temp., 20°; night min.,\r\n 17°; wind, S.W.\r\n Dec. 29, 1840: summit (13,600 feet); noon temp. in shade, 47°; night\r\n min., 20°.\r\n Dec. 30, 1840: summit (13,600 feet); noon temp., 55°; night min., 13°.\r\n Dec. 31, 1840: summit (13,600 feet); night min., 17°.\r\n Jan. 2, 1841: summit (13,600 feet); sunrise, 20°; wind, N.E.\r\n Jan. 3, 1841: summit (13,600 feet); night min., 17°.\r\n Jan. 4, 1841: summit (13,600 feet); daylight, 20°.\r\n Jan. 8, 1841: summit (13,600 feet); S.W. gale.\r\n Jan. 10, 1841: summit (13,600 feet); night temp., 16°.\r\n Jan. 12, 1841: summit (13,600 feet); night temp., 17°.\r\n Jan. 13, 1841: summit (13,600 feet); strong S.W. wind.\r\n\r\nThe usual variation of temperature in the twenty-four hours is given as\r\n17°-50°. The south-west was evidently regarded as the prevailing wind,\r\nand the clouds are spoken of as sometimes moving from opposite\r\ndirections towards the same centre.\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Bird spent a night on the summit of Mauna Loa during the\r\neruption of June, 1874, the cold was described as intense, eleven\r\ndegrees of frost (21° F.).\r\n\r\n_Observations on the Summit of Mauna Kea._—.... When Prof. Alexander\r\nwith a party of scientists ascended this mountain (in the summer of\r\n1892), the thermometer at night fell to 13° F., and the trade-wind was\r\nfound to be blowing as strongly on the summit as down below (Whitney’s\r\n_Tourist Guide to Hawaii_). It is to be inferred that the party camped\r\nby the small lake which is a few hundred feet below the actual summit\r\n(13,800 feet). This lake, which I visited on May 20, 1897, is about 120\r\nyards across, and evidently shallow, probably not more than three or\r\nfour fathoms deep. A carpet of algæ covered the bottom. At noon, by the\r\nlake, the air in the shade was 53° F., whilst the temperature of the\r\nsurface-water was 51°. The lower clouds were moving from S.S.E. This\r\nlake is said to be permanently frozen over in the winter, and to have\r\nbeen visited by skaters.\r\n\r\n_Permanent Water Supply on the Summit of Mauna Loa._—In this barren\r\nrocky region water derived from the winter-snow is to be found all the\r\nyear through at the bottom of the deep cracks or fissures in the\r\nlava-rock. Such fissures are from two to four feet wide, and in the case\r\nof that near my tent the bucket had to be lowered to a depth of\r\nseventeen or eighteen feet to reach the water, or rather the ice, since\r\nit was often necessary to break the surface ice. In these deep, narrow\r\nfissures, which the sun scarcely penetrates, the water would probably be\r\nfrozen over all through the seasons; but in those of less depth it would\r\nremain liquid in summer.\r\n\r\nREGISTER OF OBSERVATIONS ON WIND, RELATIVE HUMIDITY, CLOUD, RAIN, AND\r\n  TEMPERATURE, MADE BY H.

The instruments employed were a\r\nSixe’s maximum and minimum thermometer made by Negretti and Zambra,\r\nseveral unmounted thermometers, and a reference thermometer (with a Kew\r\ncertificate) by the above-named makers, which was used as a standard.\r\nThe freezing point was also tested for all the instruments on the summit\r\nin melting powdered ice. The maximum air observations and those on the\r\nrelative humidity were taken in a small cave with a hole in the roof,\r\nthrough which there was a steady flow of air. One day was occupied in\r\ncomparing the cave-observations with those obtained under a temporary\r\nscreen rigged up outside my tent, the only difference shown being as a\r\nrule less than a degree. The minimum observations taken in my tent,\r\nwhere there was no artificial heat, were usually only 1·5° higher than\r\nthose given by a thermometer outside the tent.\r\n\r\n _Results of the Observations on the Top of Mauna Loa, Aug. 9-31, 1897_\r\n\r\n     Mean minimum temperature of air in shade             23·2° F.\r\n     Mean maximum temperature of air in shade                53·8°\r\n     Mean daily range of temperature                         30·6°\r\n                    Lowest reading                           15·0°\r\n                    Highest reading                          61·2°\r\n     Mean temperature for the period                         38·5°\r\n\r\n                                          } Many observations\r\n Mean relative humidity, 8-9 a.m., 44·5 % }  included which\r\n Mean relative humidity, noon ...  43   % }  are not given in\r\n Mean relative humidity, 5-6 p.m., 56   % }  the register.\r\n\r\nOn Aug. 11th, at 10 a.m., wet bulb, 33·2°; dry bulb, 52°; difference,\r\n18·8°.\r\n\r\nOn Aug. 19th, at 11 a.m., wet bulb, 35·7°; dry bulb, 56°; difference,\r\n20·3°.\r\n\r\nOwing to the varying winds at my camp, the relative humidity fluctuated\r\ngreatly in a short time.

(All weeds and\r\ncultivated plants are here excluded.) The vascular cryptogams, however,\r\nseem to figure too prominently in Seemann’s collections. From Horne’s\r\ndata, who says that he added 363 flowering plants to the flora, the\r\nflowering plants would amount to about 980; and since Baker implies, in\r\n_Trimen’s Journal of Botany_, 1879, that Horne added 42 species of ferns\r\nand lycopods to the flora, this would increase the vascular cryptogams\r\nto 237, which enables us to estimate the relative proportion of vascular\r\ncryptogams in Fiji as about 20 per cent. of the whole flora of vascular\r\nplants. This is probably near the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 63 (page 222)\r\n\r\n    ON THE TABLE OF VASCULAR CRYPTOGAMS OF TAHITI, HAWAII, AND FIJI\r\n\r\nIn the case of Tahiti, I have gone carefully through the list given by\r\nDrake del Castillo, comparing it with other Polynesian lists given by\r\nSeemann, Horne, Hillebrand, Hemsley, &c., and have reduced his endemic\r\nspecies from 19 to 13. The same thing has been done with Hillebrand’s\r\nlist for Hawaii, some of his species having been found in other parts of\r\nPolynesia, thus reducing the endemic species from 75 to 70. The data\r\nrelating to Fiji are referred to in Note 62.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 64 (page 223)\r\n\r\n         ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE TAHITIAN FERNS AND LYCOPODS\r\n\r\nI have arranged them as follows, according to the distributions given by\r\nDrake del Castillo:—Cosmopolitan, 5; Tropics of Old and New Worlds, 33;\r\nTropics of Old World, mainly Indo-Malaya, 58; “Océanie,” including\r\nAustralia, 17; Polynesia, 26; South America, 2; peculiar to Tahiti, 13:\r\ntotal, 154.\r\n\r\nOut of 141 non-endemic Tahitian species, 107 at least have been recorded\r\nfrom the Fijian area comprising Samoa and Tonga, and 42 from Hawaii. Of\r\nthe last, all but four occur also in Fiji. There is thus a very small\r\nelement peculiar to Hawaii and Tahiti alone. Some of them will no doubt\r\nbe found in the Fijian area; whilst two of them, Acrostichum squamosum\r\nand Lycopodium venustulum, are high-mountain forms in Hawaii and Tahiti,\r\nwhich have evidently failed to find a suitable elevation in Fiji.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 65 (page 225)\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF SOME OF THE MOUNTAIN FERNS OF HAWAII THAT ARE NOT FOUND\r\n           EITHER IN FIJI OR TAHITI (mainly from Hillebrand)\r\n\r\n +-----------------------------+----------------+--------------------------------+\r\n |          Species.           |  Altitude of   |      General distribution.     |\r\n |                             |station in feet.|                                |\r\n +-----------------------------+----------------+--------------------------------+\r\n |Schizæa robusta, Bak.        |  3,000- 6,000  |Perhaps a form of S.            |\r\n |                             |                |australis, Gaud., from the      |\r\n |                             |                |Falkland and Auckland Islands.  |\r\n |                             |                |                                |\r\n |Polypodium serrulatum, Mett. |  3,000- 6,000  |Generally diffused in the       |\r\n |                             |                |tropics and subtropics.         |\r\n |                             |                |                                |\r\n |Aspidium caryotideum, Wall.  | In the forests |Himalayas, South Africa, &c.    |\r\n |                             |                |                                |\r\n |Aspidium filix mas, Sw.      |In the highlands|Over four continents, from the  |\r\n |                             |                |arctic circle to the higher     |\r\n |                             |                |levels of tropical mountains.   |\r\n |                             |                |                                |\r\n |Asplenium trichomanes, L.    |  5,000- 8,000  |Temperate zones and the higher  |\r\n |                             |                |levels of tropical mountains.   |\r\n |                             |                |                                |\r\n |Asplenium monanthemum, L.    |  3,000- 6,000  |American Andes, Madeira, Tristan|\r\n |                             |                |d’Acunha, Azores, Abyssinia, &c.|\r\n |                             |                |                                |\r\n |Asplenium fragile, Presl.    |  4,000- 6,000  |Andes.                          |\r\n |                             |                |                                |\r\n |Asplenium contiguum, K.      |  2,000- 5,000  |Lord Howe Island, Ceylon,       |\r\n |                             |                |Neilgherry Hills.               |\r\n |                             |                |                                |\r\n |Asplenium adiantum nigrum, L.|  4,000-10,000  |Europe, Asia, Africa,           |\r\n |                             |                |Atlantic Islands.               |\r\n |                             |                |                                |\r\n |Asplenium aspidioides, Sch.  |  1,000- 6,000  |Andes, Africa, India.           |\r\n +-----------------------------+----------------+--------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 66 (page 226)\r\n\r\n                   ENDEMIC GENERA OF FERNS IN HAWAII\r\n\r\nHillebrand gives two genera of ferns peculiar to Hawaii, one, Sadleria\r\nof Kaulfuss, “scarcely distinct from Blechnum,” and containing four\r\nspecies; the other, Schizostege, constituted by himself, and represented\r\nby a single species found in only one or two of the islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 67 (page 241)\r\n\r\n                 ON THE DISPERSAL OF COMPOSITÆ BY BIRDS\r\n\r\nThe goldfinch’s habit of pecking at the heads of thistles, and pulling\r\nout the achenes in bundles, is well known. Gätke mentions two suggestive\r\ninstances of birds feeding on the fruits of a Composite plant. According\r\nto this observer, the Scarlet Grosbeak (Pyrrhula erythrina), when it\r\nalights on Heligoland, always feeds on the achenes of Sonchus oleraceus,\r\nwhich it picks off the plant; whilst the Parrot Crossbill (Loxia sp.),\r\nfeeds in Heligoland on burrs and thistles (_Heligoland as an\r\nOrnithological Observatory_, pp. 407, 409). See Note 91.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 68 (page 264)\r\n\r\nON SOME OF THE HAWAIIAN ENDEMIC GENERA, EXCLUDING THOSE OF THE COMPOSITÆ\r\n                             AND LOBELIACEÆ\r\n\r\n_Haplostachys, Phyllostegia, and Stenogyne, all Labiate\r\nGenera._—Phyllostegia is not strictly peculiar to Hawaii, since out of\r\nthe 17 species enumerated in the _Index Kewensis_, 15 are Hawaiian, 1\r\nTahitian, and 1 is accredited to Unalaska (one of the Aleutian Islands).\r\nThe last locality appears to be an error. The species in question is P.\r\nmicrophylla, Benth.; and on looking up the original authority in\r\n_Linnæa_ (vi. 570, 1831), I find the locality is thus given: “insula\r\ncoralligena Romanzoffii,” which is either one of the atolls of the\r\nPaumotu Islands in about lat. 15° S. and long. 144° W., or a coral\r\nisland of the Marshall Group, most probably the former.... I paid some\r\nattention to the suitability of the fruits of these three Labiate genera\r\nfor dispersal by frugivorous birds, for which the fleshy nucules in the\r\ncases of Phyllostegia and Stenogyne apparently fit them. Out of the\r\nfruits of five species of Phyllostegia examined by me, the\r\nseed-coverings in three species, after the removal of the fleshy\r\ncovering of the nucule, were too soft for the protection of the seed in\r\na bird’s stomach. Hillebrand also observes (p. 347) that the nucules\r\nwhen dried are wrinkled, and absorb moisture easily, a quality which, if\r\ntrue of all the species, would make the distribution of the genus by\r\nbirds impossible. However, in two species I found the seed-coverings\r\nsomewhat harder. It would seem that since birds have largely ceased to\r\ndisperse these plants, the soft-skinned nucules would in the absence of\r\ntheir selective agency more frequently characterise the genus. It is\r\npossible that the dry nucules of Haplostachys, which according to\r\nHillebrand are not affected by drying, represent the original condition\r\nof those of Phyllostegia, and that the fleshy character has been\r\nacquired in this archipelago. It will be seen in the list on page 263,\r\nthat Haplostachys is regarded by Gray as a section of Phyllostegia. The\r\nremarks under Phyllostegia, regarding the softness of the seed-coverings\r\nbeneath the fleshy coat of the nucule, also apply to Stenogyne; and\r\nHillebrand, in contrasting its fleshy nucules with the dry nucules of\r\nHaplostachys, implies that they absorb water, which, I may remark, would\r\nrender them quite unfit for dispersal by frugivorous birds.\r\n\r\n_Touchardia (Urticaceæ)._—According to Hillebrand, the solitary species\r\nis by no means common in the group now. In 1897 I found it growing\r\nabundantly some miles up the Waipio gorge, Hawaii.\r\n\r\n_Cheirodendron (Araliaceæ)._—C. Gaudichaudii, the well-known “Olapa”\r\ntree, is common in the forests of all the Hawaiian Islands between 2,000\r\nand 5,000 feet; but I noticed it occasionally at greater elevations, as\r\non the south-east slopes of Mauna Kea, where it extends to 7,000 feet.\r\nAs described on page 343, the “Olapa” often grows in close contact with\r\nthe Lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha), the two trunks appearing as one.\r\nThe drupes would attract frugivorous birds and the pyrenes are well\r\nadapted for this mode of dispersal. Mr. Perkins states that the drupes\r\nare much sought after by the various species of Phæornis, a genus of\r\nbirds peculiar to Hawaii.\r\n\r\n_Deterioration of Fruits for Purposes of Dispersal._—Among fruits or\r\nendemic genera that have evidently deteriorated in the Hawaiian Group as\r\nfar as fitness for dispersal is concerned, may be mentioned, in addition\r\nto those of Phyllostegia and Stenogyne above noticed, those of the\r\nAraliaceous genera, Pterotropia and Triplasandra, and the Amarantaceous\r\nNototrichium. The pyrenes of the first two genera on account of their\r\nthin covering, and the seed of the last-named genus on account of its\r\nthin testa, seem ill-fitted now for transport in a bird’s stomach, yet\r\nwe cannot doubt that their ancestors originally arrived in this fashion.\r\nThe same principle is also illustrated by some Hawaiian non-endemic\r\ngenera of later eras that possess peculiar species, such, for instance,\r\nas in the case of Elæocarpus discussed in Chapter XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 69 (page 366)\r\n\r\n                     ON THE GERMINATION OF CUSCUTA\r\n\r\nMy observations were made on the Hawaiian endemic species (C.\r\nsandwichiana) and on a Fijian introduced species. Germination occurs\r\nreadily in fresh water, the floating seedling growing rapidly. When the\r\ngerminating seed is placed on wet soil in the shade, the seedling grows\r\nat the rate of 3/4 inch (19 mm.) a day. The store of nutriment contained\r\nin the swollen radicular end will support the seedling for a couple of\r\ndays, and if it has not then found a host it withers and dies. At first\r\nlying prone the seedling then lifts its upper end into the air, and it\r\nwas almost pathetic to notice it moving round and round, endeavouring\r\nvainly to find some object near. The seedlings make no effort to strike\r\ninto the soil, and when they are allowed to attach themselves to a plant\r\nthey ascend rapidly, growing at the upper end and dying at the lower\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NOTE 70 (pages 477, 480-1)\r\n\r\n                          ON BEACH-TEMPERATURE\r\n\r\nMy data are rather scanty; but, judging from observations made in\r\nHawaii, in South America, and in the south of England, the following\r\nscale would probably be true of typical beaches where the sand is found\r\nrelatively cool and moist at a depth of four or five inches. This\r\nmoisture seems to arise entirely from subsoil drainage seaward. When a\r\nbeach fronts an arid, rainless region, few if any plants grow on it; the\r\nsand is loose, hot, and dry at the depth indicated; and the temperature\r\nof the surface half-inch rises to between 130° and 140° F., whilst four\r\ninches down it is 95° to 100°. Salt-marshes situated behind a beach even\r\nin a desert-region change its thermal behaviour, and it would then be\r\nmore like a beach skirting a vegetated sea-border in the same latitude.\r\nThe method of observation was as follows:—An unmounted thermometer of\r\nthe size of a clinical thermometer, but graduated higher, was placed\r\nhorizontally in the sand half an inch below the surface and a reading\r\ntaken. It was then pushed vertically into the sand until the bulb was\r\nfour inches deep and another reading taken. Provided that the sand is\r\nmoist beneath, the colour does not seem to make much difference, except\r\nperhaps in very dark sands, none of which were tested.\r\n\r\n  _Ordinary Beach-Temperatures with an Unclouded Sky in the Hot Season\r\n                      during the Early Afternoon._\r\n\r\n +-----------------------------------+------------------+-----------------+\r\n |                                   |Surface half-inch.|Four inches deep.|\r\n |                                   +------------------+-----------------+\r\n |Temperate latitudes about    50-55°|    100-105° F.   |      77° F.     |\r\n |Sub-tropical latitudes about 30-35 |    105-110       |      80         |\r\n |Tropical latitudes about     10-20 |    110-120       |      85         |\r\n +-----------------------------------+------------------+-----------------+\r\n\r\nThis illustrates only the average condition. On a calm day in the case\r\nof a beach facing south in the South of England, I have obtained exactly\r\nthe same readings in July as at Valparaiso in January, 112° at surface,\r\n80° four inches deep.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 71 (page 479)\r\n\r\n   On the Buoyancy of the Seeds or Seed-vessels of some Chilian Shore\r\n                                 Plants\r\n\r\n(1) _Nolana_, probably _paradoxa_. Common on the beaches of Southern\r\nChile. The ripe drupes have a somewhat fleshy outer covering which they\r\nlose when lying on the sand, and present themselves then as dark-brown\r\nangular “stones,” often five to six millimetres across. Inside the outer\r\nhard covering of the stone is a layer of spongy tissue which gives it\r\nbuoyancy; but since these coverings are wanting at the scars marking the\r\nbasal insertion of the drupe, the embryo seems insufficiently protected\r\nagainst injury during flotation in sea-water; and the seed-vessel at\r\nfirst appears to be only fitted for conveyance by the currents over a\r\nlimited tract of sea. However, in a preliminary experiment on\r\nseed-vessels that had been kept a few weeks, I found that 30 per cent.\r\nfloated after three weeks in sea-water. Subsequently, after drying for a\r\nyear, the seed-vessels were again tested in sea-water, nearly all of\r\nthem floating after three months’ immersion. Two of them, removed after\r\nsix weeks’ flotation, germinated healthily. These fruits are common in\r\nbeach-drift between Corral and Valparaiso.\r\n\r\n(2) _Raphanus_, near R. maritimus. Growing near beaches in South Chile,\r\nand not infrequently represented in the stranded beach-drift by the\r\npods, which in my experiments floated seven to ten days in sea-water,\r\nafter drying some weeks.\r\n\r\n(3) _Franseria._ A species common on the beaches of Valparaiso and\r\nTalcahuano. Its prickly fruits, after being kept six weeks, floated only\r\ntwo to four days. They are well suited for transport in birds’ plumage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 72 (page 483)\r\n\r\n        THE SOUTHERN LIMIT OF THE MANGROVE FORMATION IN ECUADOR.\r\n\r\n... The southern limit of the mangrove formation on the west coast of\r\nSouth America is usually placed at 4° S. lat.; but it is probable that\r\nthe vicinity of Tumbez in lat. 3° 30ʹ S. would be more correct. Baron\r\nvon Eggers would place it rather further to the north-east, near the\r\nfrontier of Ecuador and Peru in lat. 3° 20ʹ S. I spent eight days in the\r\nlocality last named and saw no evidence of the beginning of the\r\nmangrove-formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 73 (page 495)\r\n\r\n ADDITIONAL NOTE ON THE TEMPERATURE OF THE DRY COAST OF ECUADOR BETWEEN\r\n                      PUNA ISLAND AND THE EQUATOR.\r\n\r\n... Baron von Eggers gives the mean annual temperature for El Recreo,\r\nabout half a degree south of the equator, at 75° F., which is near that\r\nof Rio de Janeiro in lat 23° S. on the east coast of the continent. Mr.\r\nF. P. Walker has kindly given me the results of temperature-observations\r\ncovering a period of ten years, taken in the room for testing cables at\r\nSanta Elena Point (2° 10ʹ S.), usually about 6·30 a.m. The range of the\r\nmonthly means was 71° F. (August) to 79·1° (March), and the mean for the\r\nyear was 74·8°. In that locality a typical daily range would be 65° to\r\n80°; and Mr. Walker believes that a minimum of 59° has been recorded.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 74 (page 495)\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS ON THE TEMPERATURE OF THE HUMBOLDT CURRENT FROM ANTOFAGASTA\r\n     NORTHWARD, BETWEEN JANUARY AND MARCH, 1904 (Fahrenheit scale)\r\n\r\nThe observations were usually taken at the anchorages, but in some\r\nplaces, as at Ancon and Puerto Bolivar, they were taken from a boat\r\noutside the roadstead.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to ascertain how the Humboldt Current retains its cool\r\ntemperature as it advances through the tropics to the equator, a glance\r\nat the following table will show that the surface-temperatures can aid\r\nus but slightly, since they do not vary in accordance with the latitude,\r\na subject further discussed below. We can, however, obtain some valuable\r\nindications from the deeper temperatures. Let us take for instance the\r\nplane of 60°. Whilst south of Ancon (lat. 11° 45ʹ S.) it was rarely\r\ndeeper than four fathoms, north of this latitude it descends rapidly,\r\nbeing probably about ten fathoms down at Salaverri and Eten and about\r\ntwenty fathoms deep at Payta, in latitude 5° S., where the Humboldt\r\nCurrent leaves the coast. Within the Gulf of Guayaquil it is probable\r\nthat the plane of 60° would descend to nearer thirty fathoms, the region\r\nbeing outside the influence of the current.\r\n\r\nSome interesting facts are also elicited from the variation of the\r\nsurface-temperatures. When we were coasting along at a distance of five\r\nor six miles from shore the readings were fairly constant from hour to\r\nhour varying only a degree or so. But nearer the land, for instance,\r\nabout two or three miles away, the variation from hour to hour amounted\r\nto two or three degrees, whilst within the limits of the anchorages, a\r\nmile and less from the coast, the change from hour to hour amounted to\r\nthree or four degrees. Nor was there any uniformity at the same hour\r\nover the surface of a roadstead. The temperature would often rise or\r\nfall a degree every few boat-lengths. Sometimes the inshore water was\r\nthe coolest and sometimes it was the warmest. Thus at Iquique the\r\ninshore water was three degrees warmer than the water half a mile out,\r\nwhilst at Mollendo, when the temperature one-third of a mile off the\r\nshore was 70°, it was 63° close to the rocky coast. The same thing was\r\nexhibited at Pisagua, where the surface-water two miles out at sea was\r\n61°, whilst close inshore at the anchorage it was 58°. It was evident\r\nthat there was a considerable intermingling of the warmer surface and\r\nthe colder, deeper waters on the coasts of Chile and Peru. This was\r\nparticularly noticeable on a rocky, steep-to coast, or where there was\r\nan uneven bottom. At some places, indeed, the warm upper layer did not\r\nexist, the cold water welling up all along the coast. This was\r\nespecially the case between the 22nd and 19th parallels of latitude, a\r\ntract of coast in which lie Tocopilla, Iquique, and Pisagua, and\r\nprobably the coolest part of the sea-border at this season of the year.\r\n\r\nDuring a fortnight spent at Ancon (11° 45ʹ S.), between January 27 and\r\nFebruary 10, I paid considerable attention to the local climatic\r\nconditions, and especially to the temperature of the inshore water. The\r\ndaily range of the air-temperature was only five or six degrees, the\r\naverage minimum and maximum being 71° and 75·9°, and the mean for the\r\nperiod 73·5°. The mean temperature of the surface-water at the head of\r\nthe pier, from observations taken at about 7 a.m. and 4 p.m., was 68·6°,\r\nor five degrees cooler than the air, the mean temperature in the morning\r\nbeing 69·1° and in the afternoon 68°.\r\n\r\n  OBSERVATIONS ON THE TEMPERATURE OF THE HUMBOLDT OR PERUVIAN CURRENT\r\n\r\n             (Made by H.

Ancon climate at this period is full of oddities and abnormalities,\r\nand in this way typifies much of the coast of Peru. Thus, since the heat\r\nof the day is tempered by the cool south-westerly winds which die away\r\nin the evening and give place usually to warm, light, northerly and\r\nnorth-westerly breezes, there is, as above remarked, but a small\r\ndifference between day and night temperatures. The coldest time of the\r\ntwenty-four hours is not in the early morning but at sunset. The sea off\r\nthe beach is, on the average, much cooler than the air, which is not a\r\nnormal state of things; and again, the water is often two or three\r\ndegrees colder in the evening than it is in the morning, which is very\r\nunusual. Though the sea-border is practically a desert for the greater\r\npart of the year and has no rain, it is frequently enveloped in\r\ndrizzling fogs or “garuas.” Judged from a European standard, things go\r\nby contraries on the coast of Peru; and this is entirely the effect of\r\nthe Humboldt Current.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the inshore waters of Ancon Bay varied considerably\r\nduring the twenty-four hours. During the day, with the prevailing\r\nsoutherly wind, the cool waters of the current had free access to the\r\nbay, and swept around its border in their course north; but in the\r\nnight, when northerly breezes occurred, the cold waters of the current\r\nwere pushed off the coast and their place taken by the warmer inshore\r\nwaters from the north; and this sometimes continued for a day or two.\r\nWhen the current again got mastery and its clean, cool waters filled the\r\nbay, the temperature of the water dropped suddenly five or six degrees,\r\nand the bay was filled with fish. At such times men in boats leave the\r\nbeach, and in a few minutes, with hand-nets and baskets, they obtain\r\nthousands of the small fry. Other men, fishing with lines from the\r\npier-head, seem ill-contented unless they can catch fish of the size of\r\nsmall mackerel at the rate of one a minute.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that on the coasts of Chile and Peru the\r\ninstincts of fish often lead them astray, on account of the sudden\r\nchanges of temperature arising from the conflict between the warmer\r\nwaters of the open sea and the cooler waters of the current. From the\r\npreceding remarks it will be inferred that sometimes the current is\r\npushed off the coast for a while and its place taken by the warm waters\r\nfrom the north. At other times it dives down, so to speak, and flows at\r\na deeper level, and warmer waters prevail both out at sea and inshore.\r\nAt other times again, and this must be most disconcerting to the fish,\r\nthe cold current suddenly appearing at the coast predominates at the\r\nsurface for days together, and we have stretches of coast which,\r\nalthough lying within tropical latitudes, are washed by waters having\r\nthe temperature of the temperate zone. It is to such causes that we must\r\nattribute the reckless habits of fish on these coasts. They are known to\r\nthrow themselves on the beaches in thousands, where by their decay they\r\ntaint the air long afterwards. Mr. Anderson Smith in his recent book on\r\n_Temperate Chile_ vividly describes what goes on on such occasions at\r\nthe port of Valdivia. At times the scene must be indeed a strange one,\r\nsince huge octopi are rolled up on the beaches in numbers, and are\r\nregarded by the indigenes as deliberately seeking their death. Whether\r\nthey commit suicide or not, “their beaks that blacken the edge of the\r\nsea-wash in places” afford a melancholy proof that their instinct has\r\nblundered.\r\n\r\n_The Mode of Observation._—A thermometer made on the Sixe pattern which\r\nI used several years ago for taking the bottom-temperatures of rivers,\r\nwas employed for the deeper temperatures, and at critical depths the\r\nobservations were always repeated. This instrument was compared after\r\neach set of observations with an ordinary thermometer graduated on the\r\nstem, which was compared with my standard thermometer provided with a\r\nKew certificate.... The observations in the Panama Roadstead have been\r\nadded for the sake of contrast.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 75 (page 496)\r\n\r\nON THE STRANDED MASSIVE CORALS APPARENTLY OF THE GENUS PORITES FOUND ON\r\nTHE COAST OF PERU AND NORTH CHILE, AT ARICA (18° 25ʹ S.), CALLAO (12° 3ʹ\r\n                      S.), AND ANCON (11° 45ʹ S.)\r\n\r\nAt Arica they occurred on the beach only. At Callao they also extended\r\ninland on the low spit at Punta for about 100 yards. At Ancon they were\r\nfound not only on the beach but also twenty or thirty paces inland on\r\nthe low adjoining plains. Their size varied from three inches to three\r\nfeet. They were all more or less rounded by wave action, and were\r\nextensively burrowed by boring molluscs. Whilst some on the beach still\r\ndisplayed the dried-up soft parts of the boring mollusc, others inland\r\nwere falling to pieces and undergoing chemical change. There was nothing\r\nto indicate that the corals were recently alive; and at Ancon they\r\nappeared to have been torn off a rocky spit of andesite that had become\r\nexposed on the beach during a recent movement of emergence, of which\r\nthere is other evidence on this coast. Further particulars are given on\r\npage 496.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 76 (page 429)\r\n\r\n          STRANDED PUMICE ON ENGLISH AND SCANDINAVIAN BEACHES\r\n\r\nSernander, in his description of the Atlantic drift of the Scandinavian\r\ncoast, refers to the occurrence of a small amount of true pumice. I have\r\nfound solitary fragments of acid pumice well rounded by wave-action at\r\nCroyde Bay on the north coast of Devonshire, at the mouth of Salcombe\r\nHarbour on the south coast of the same county, and at Maenporth, near\r\nFalmouth, in Cornwall. Steamer slag, in some cases rudely simulating\r\npumice, is common on all the South of England beaches I have examined.\r\nIt is also common on the Scandinavian coasts, though seemingly regarded\r\nby Helge Bäckström, who is quoted by Sernander, as derived from the\r\nfactories on the east coast of England. (See on these subjects a paper\r\nby Helge Bäckström, “Über angeschwemmte Bimsteine und Schlacken der\r\nnordeuropäischen Küsten”; Bihang till _K. Sv. V. A. Handl._ Bd. 16. Afd.\r\n3, 1890; also a letter in _Nature_, about 1886, by H. B. Guppy.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 77 (page 21)\r\n\r\n             ON THE MODE OF DISPERSAL OF KLEINHOVIA HOSPITA\r\n\r\nThis small tree has a very wide distribution in the tropics, ranging\r\nfrom East Africa and the Mascarene Islands through India, South-eastern\r\nAsia, Malaya, New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands to Fiji and Tahiti. It\r\nis a plant that grows in inland open woods as well as amongst the\r\nlittoral trees on the beach; and it is always doubtful (in Malaya, Fiji,\r\nand Samoa) whether to regard it as a shore plant or as an inland plant,\r\ndifferent authors varying on this point. In Vanua Levu I formed the\r\nopinion that it is only an intruder amongst the littoral vegetation. In\r\naccounting for its distribution we have to choose between man, the bird,\r\nand the current. Though it may sometimes be noticed in native\r\nplantations, as I observed in the Solomon Islands, the tree has no\r\nspecial use; and the Solomon Island natives themselves indicated to me\r\nthat the parrots that fed on the fruits of the tree aided in\r\ndistributing the plant. The buoyant behaviour of the seeds, which are\r\nfreed by the dehiscence of the bladder-capsules on the tree, is not\r\nconstant. Whilst in the case of the seeds of littoral trees in Fiji I\r\nfound that 30 per cent. floated after ten weeks, Prof. Schimper\r\nascertained in the case (seemingly) of Malayan seeds that they sank at\r\nonce. The seed-structure connected with the buoyancy is, as shown on\r\npage 105, accidental in character, and reference is made on page 20 to\r\nother plants of doubtful littoral reputation, in which the buoyant\r\nqualities are variable. The occasional buoyancy of its seeds will only,\r\nas I think, explain its occasional station at the coast; and I agree\r\nwith Prof. Schimper (p. 156) when he attributes its wide distribution to\r\nbirds, the seeds being hard, crustaceous, and about three millimetres\r\nacross.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 78 (page 436)\r\n\r\n         ON THE “SEA”: AN UNIDENTIFIED WILD FRUIT-TREE IN FIJI\r\n\r\nThis is a fair-sized forest tree common in places in the lower forests.\r\nI have never been able to identify it; but a “putamen” which was sent to\r\nthe Kew Museum was named Spondias with a query. It is to be hoped its\r\ntrue botanical name will be discovered by one of my successors. Seemann\r\nplaces it amongst the “desiderata” concerning which further information\r\nis needed. The fruit is a drupe 2 to 2-1/2 inches long possessing a\r\npleasant fruity odour and inclosing a hard two-celled stone about 1-2/3\r\ninch long, one cell containing a large fleshy seed covered with tawny\r\nhair, the other filled with the hair only and containing no seed. The\r\nFijians say that these fruits, large as they are, are swallowed by the\r\nfruit-pigeons, the stones being found in their gullet. The leaves are\r\ndistichous, alternate, lanceolate, eight or nine inches long, glabrous\r\nand dark green above, and covered below with a whitish woolly matted\r\ntomentum. The empty stones are not uncommon in the stranded beach-drift.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 79 (page 395)\r\n\r\n                   ON WILLOW-LEAVED RIVER-SIDE PLANTS\r\n\r\nA number of observers, beginning with Humboldt, in his _Ansichten der\r\nNature_, and including Seemann, L. H. Grindon, Ridley, Beccari, and\r\nothers, have referred to what is called “stenophyllism” in plants. These\r\nwillow-leaved river-side plants are found all over the globe, such\r\nplants usually growing close to the water’s edge in situations where\r\nthey are liable to be more or less submerged when the river is in flood.\r\nSeemann, Beccari, and Ridley mention more than two dozen genera\r\nbelonging to a great variety of orders, and including Acalypha,\r\nAntidesma, Calophyllum, Eulalia, Eugenia, Fagræa, Ficus, Garcinia,\r\nIxora, Lindenia, Melastoma, Podocarpus, Psychotria, &c., all tropical,\r\nand represented either in Fiji, Borneo, or in the Malay Peninsula;\r\nwhilst my readers will recall amongst temperate floras river-side plants\r\nof the genera Epilobium, Lythrum, Salix, &c., possessing the same form\r\nof leaf and the same station. The genus Eugenia comes under this\r\ncategory in Fiji, Borneo, and the Malay Peninsula, with reference to one\r\nor more of the species. In Fiji, species belonging to the genera\r\nLindenia and Dolicholobium especially attracted my attention in this\r\nrespect. It is noteworthy that several of the Bornean plants and some of\r\nthe Fijian plants here concerned are endemic. Just as I have remarked in\r\nthe question of the buoyancy of seeds and fruits, that not all\r\nwater-side plants have buoyant seeds or fruits, but that nearly all\r\nplants thus endowed are found at the water-side, so we may say of the\r\nwillow-leaved plants, that not all river-side plants have the\r\nwillow-form of leaf, but that plants thus characterised gather at the\r\nriver-side. Beccari and Ridley regard this willow-form of leaf as the\r\nresult of adaptation. Seemann remarks that we have here the old question\r\nwhether the webbed feet of a duck are the cause or the effect of the\r\nbird’s swimming; and I take the same position. (See Seemann’s _Flora\r\nVitiensis_; Ridley in _Trans. Linn. Soc. Bot._, vol. iii. 1888-94; and\r\nBeccari’s _Nelle Foreste di Borneo_, 1902, or the English edition of\r\n1904.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                        NOTE 80 (pages 255, 504)\r\n\r\n MR. PERKINS ON THE HAWAIIAN LOBELIACEÆ (_Fauna hawaiiensis_, vol. I.)\r\n\r\nMy view, that the early Hawaiian Lobeliaceæ acquired the monstrous form\r\nof their flowers in the humid forests of a later age, is supported by\r\nthe observations of Mr. Perkins on the connection between the\r\nhighly-specialised nectar-eating Drepanids of Hawaii and the\r\nhighly-specialised flowers of the Tree-Lobelias, a subject further\r\ndiscussed in Chapter XXXIII. This naturalist ascertained, in the case of\r\none of the trees, that fertilisation could only be effected by these\r\nbirds. So close is the biological connection between the Drepanid and\r\nthe Tree-Lobelia, that Mr. Perkins finds here in part the cause of the\r\ndevelopment of the most remarkable forms of the birds. The botanist,\r\nalso, would not dissociate the plants from this conclusion. There would\r\nbe every reason to look for abnormal growth in birds and plants when the\r\nbird depends on the flower for its food, and the flower is dependent on\r\nthe bird for its pollenisation. It is through such guises that the\r\nzoologist and the botanist have to penetrate when establishing the\r\nsystematic affinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NOTE 81\r\n\r\n ON THE VERTICAL RANGE OF SOME OF THE MOST TYPICAL AND MOST CONSPICUOUS\r\nOF THE PLANTS IN THE FORESTS ON THE HAMAKUA SLOPES OF MAUNA KEA, HAWAII\r\n\r\nDuring a descent of this mountain on its north side to near Ookala, the\r\nconditions were unusually favourable for recording the range of altitude\r\nfor some of the plants easily recognisable.\r\n\r\nAcacia koa began at 6,700 feet, and extended down to 2,300 feet.\r\n\r\nRubus (“akala”) began at 6,500 feet, and extended down to 2,500 feet.\r\n\r\nCheirodendron (“olapa”) began at 6,400 feet, and extended down to 2,200\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nCyanea, a lobeliad growing on trunks of tree-ferns, began at 4,000 feet,\r\nand extended down to 2,300 feet.\r\n\r\nFreycinetia began at 3,850 feet, and extended down to 2,000 feet.\r\n\r\nAsplenium nidus began at 2,800 feet, and extended down to 2,200 feet.\r\n\r\nAleurites moluccana began at 1,800 feet, and extended down to 50 feet.\r\n\r\nMetrosideros polymorpha, ranging through all the zones.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NOTE 82 (page 416)\r\n\r\n                          ABORIGINAL WEEDS[7]\r\n\r\n   (Found by Captain Cook’s Botanists, Banks, Solander, the Forsters,\r\n                              Nelson, &c.,\r\n                    in the Pacific Islands, 1768-80)\r\n\r\n +-------------------------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------------+\r\n |                               |   Locality given by Cook’s      |      General distribution.       |\r\n |                               |        botanists.               |                                  |\r\n +-------------------------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------------+\r\n |Cardamine sarmentosa           |  Tahiti                         |  Polynesia.

SEGETALIS\r\n\r\nThe seeds of both species have no proper buoyancy, and display no\r\nstructure in their testas suggesting it; though, through the shrinking\r\nof the nucleus, a temporary floating power may be acquired with less\r\nmature or imperfect seeds. They support the general principle indicated\r\nfor the British species on page 29.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NOTE 91\r\n\r\n        MR. E. KAY ROBINSON ON THE DISPERSAL OF ASTER TRIPOLIUM\r\n\r\nAccording to this naturalist, the seeds of this plant are eaten in\r\nwinter by snow-buntings on the English east coast. In reply to my query\r\nhe tells me that the “draggled fluff still containing seeds” might\r\neasily adhere to birds (_The Country-Side_, Sept. 30, 1905).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             GENERAL INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note._—Several subjects are worked up in this index, which, on account\r\nof the plan of the book, are not dealt with connectedly in the text.
