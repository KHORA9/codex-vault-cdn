APPLETON AND COMPANY\r\n1910\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHT, 1866, 1898,\r\nBY D. APPLETON AND COMPANY.\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nTO THE REVISED AND ENLARGED EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nRapid in all directions, scientific progress has during the last generation\r\nbeen more rapid in the direction of Biology than in any other; and had this\r\nwork been one dealing with Biology at large, the hope of bringing it up to\r\ndate could not have been rationally entertained. But it is a work on the\r\n_Principles_ of Biology; and to bring an exposition of these up to date,\r\nseemed not impossible with such small remnant of energy as is left me.\r\nSlowly, and often interrupted by ill-health, I have in the course of the\r\nlast two years, completed this first volume of the final edition.\r\n\r\nNumerous additions have proved needful. What was originally said about\r\nvital changes of matter has been supplemented by a chapter on \"Metabolism.\"\r\nUnder the title \"The Dynamic Element in Life,\" I have added a chapter which\r\nrenders less inadequate the conception of Life previously expressed. A gap\r\nin preceding editions, which should have been occupied by some pages on\r\n\"Structure,\" is now filled up. Those astonishing actions in cell-nuclei\r\nwhich the microscope has of late revealed, will be found briefly set forth\r\nunder the head of \"Cell-Life and Cell-Multiplication.\" Further evidence and\r\nfurther thought have resulted in a supplementary chapter on \"Genesis,\r\nHeredity, and Variation\"; in which certain views enunciated in the first\r\nedition are qualified and developed. Various modern ideas are considered\r\nunder the title \"Recent Criticisms and Hypotheses.\" And the chapter on \"The\r\nArguments from Embryology\" has been mainly rewritten. Smaller increments\r\nhave taken the shape of new sections incorporated in pre-existing chapters.\r\nThey are distinguished by the following section-marks:--§ 8a, § 46a, § 87a,\r\n§ 100a, § 113a, § 127a, §§ 130a-130d. There should also be mentioned a\r\nnumber of foot-notes of some significance not present in preceding\r\neditions. Of the three additional appendices the two longer ones have\r\nalready seen the light in other shapes.\r\n\r\nAfter these chief changes have now to be named the changes necessitated by\r\nrevision. In making them assistance has been needful. Though many of the\r\namendments have resulted from further thought and inquiry, a much larger\r\nnumber have been consequent on criticisms received from gentlemen whose aid\r\nI have been fortunate enough to obtain: each of them having taken a\r\ndivision falling within the range of his special studies. The part\r\nconcerned with Organic Chemistry and its derived subjects, has been looked\r\nthrough by Mr. W. H. Perkin, Ph.D., F.R.S., Professor of Organic Chemistry,\r\nOwens College, Manchester. Plant Morphology and Physiology have been\r\noverseen by Mr. A. G. Tansley, M.A., F.L.S., Assistant Professor of Botany,\r\nUniversity College, London. Criticisms upon parts dealing with Animal\r\nMorphology, I owe to Mr. E. W. MacBride, M.A., Fellow of St. John's\r\nCollege, Cambridge, Professor of Zoology in the McGill University,\r\nMontreal, and Mr. J. T. Cunningham, M.A., late Fellow of University\r\nCollege, Oxford. And the statements included under Animal Physiology have\r\nbeen checked by Mr. W. B. Hardy, M.A., Fellow of Gonville and Caius\r\nCollege, Cambridge, Demonstrator of Physiology in the University. Where the\r\ndiscoveries made since 1864 have rendered it needful to change the text,\r\neither by omissions or qualifications or in some cases by additions, these\r\ngentlemen have furnished me with the requisite information.\r\n\r\nSave in the case of the preliminary portion, bristling with the\r\ntechnicalities of Organic Chemistry (including the pages on \"Metabolism\"),\r\nI have not submitted the proofs, either of the new chapters or of the\r\nrevised chapters, to the gentlemen above named. The abstention has resulted\r\npartly from reluctance to trespass on their time to a greater extent than\r\nwas originally arranged, and partly from the desire to avoid complicating\r\nmy own work. During the interval occupied in the preparation of this volume\r\nthe printers have kept pace with me, and I have feared adding to the\r\nentailed attention the further attention which correspondence and\r\ndiscussion would have absorbed: feeling that it was better to risk minor\r\ninaccuracies than to leave the volume unfinished: an event which at one\r\ntime appeared probable. I make this statement because, in its absence, one\r\nor other of these gentlemen might be held responsible for some error which\r\nis not his but mine.\r\n\r\nYet another explanation is called for. Beyond the exposition of those\r\ngeneral truths constituting the Principles of Biology as commonly accepted,\r\nthe original edition of this work contained sundry views for which\r\nbiological opinion did not furnish any authority. Some of these have since\r\nobtained a certain currency; either in their original forms or in modified\r\nforms. Misinterpretations are likely to result. Readers who have met with\r\nthem in other works may, in the absence of warning, suppose, to my\r\ndisadvantage, that I have adopted them without acknowledgment. Hence it\r\nmust be understood that where no indication to the contrary is given the\r\nsubstance is unchanged. Beyond the corrections which have been made in the\r\noriginal text, there are, in some cases, additions to the evidence or\r\namplifications of the argument; but in all sections not marked as new, the\r\nessential ideas set forth are the same as they were in the original edition\r\nof 1864.\r\n\r\n  BRIGHTON,\r\n\r\n  _August, 1898_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aim of this work is to set forth the general truths of Biology, as\r\nillustrative of, and as interpreted by, the laws of Evolution: the special\r\ntruths being introduced only so far as is needful for elucidation of the\r\ngeneral truths.\r\n\r\nFor aid in executing it, I owe many thanks to Prof. Huxley and Dr. Hooker.\r\nThey have supplied me with information where my own was deficient;[1] and,\r\nin looking through the proof-sheets, have pointed out errors of detail into\r\nwhich I had fallen. By having kindly rendered me this valuable assistance,\r\nthey must not, however, be held committed to any of the enunciated\r\ndoctrines that are not among the recognized truths of Biology.\r\n\r\nThe successive instalments which compose this volume, were issued to the\r\nsubscribers at the following dates:--No. 7 (pp. 1-80) in January, 1863; No.\r\n8 (pp. 81-160) in April, 1863; No. 9 (pp. 161-240) in July, 1863; No. 10\r\n(pp. 241-320) in January, 1864; No. 11 (pp. 321-400) in May, 1864; and No.\r\n12 (pp. 401-476) in October, 1864.\r\n\r\n  _London, September 29th, 1864._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF VOL.

Of the four chief elements which, in various combinations, make up\r\nliving bodies, three are gaseous under all ordinary conditions and the\r\nfourth is a solid. Oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen are gases which for many\r\nyears defied all attempts to liquefy them, and carbon is a solid except\r\nperhaps at the extremely high temperature of the electric arc. Only by\r\nintense pressures joined with extreme refrigerations have the three gases\r\nbeen reduced to the liquid form.[2] There is much significance in this.\r\nWhen we remember how those redistributions of Matter and Motion which\r\nconstitute Evolution, structural and functional, imply motions in the units\r\nthat are redistributed; we shall see a probable meaning in the fact that\r\norganic bodies, which exhibit the phenomena of Evolution in so high a\r\ndegree, are mainly composed of ultimate units having extreme mobility. The\r\nproperties of substances, though destroyed to sense by combination, are not\r\ndestroyed in reality. It follows from the persistence of force, that the\r\nproperties of a compound are _resultants_ of the properties of its\r\ncomponents--_resultants_ in which the properties of the components are\r\nseverally in full action, though mutually obscured.  One of the leading\r\nproperties of each substance is its degree of molecular mobility; and its\r\ndegree of molecular mobility more or less sensibly affects the molecular\r\nmobilities of the various compounds into which it enters. Hence we may\r\ninfer some relation between the gaseous form of three out of the four chief\r\norganic elements, and that comparative readiness displayed by organic\r\nmatters to undergo those changes in the arrangement of parts which we call\r\ndevelopment, and those transformations of motion which we call function.\r\n\r\nConsidering them chemically instead of physically, it is to be remarked\r\nthat three out of these four main components of organic matter, have\r\naffinities which are narrow in their range and low in their intensity.\r\nHydrogen, it is true, may be made to combine with a considerable number of\r\nother elements; but the chemical energy which it shows is scarcely at all\r\nshown within the limits of the organic temperatures. Of carbon it may\r\nsimilarly be said that it is totally inert at ordinary heats; that the\r\nnumber of substances with which it unites is not great; and that in most\r\ncases its tendency to unite with them is but feeble. Lastly, this chemical\r\nindifference is shown in the highest degree by nitrogen--an element which,\r\nas we shall hereafter see, plays the leading part in organic changes.\r\n\r\nAmong the organic elements (including under the title not only the four\r\nchief ones, but also the less conspicuous remainder), that capability of\r\nassuming different states called allotropism, is frequent. Carbon presents\r\nitself in the three unlike conditions of diamond, graphite, and charcoal.\r\nUnder certain circumstances, oxygen takes on the form in which it is called\r\nozone. Sulphur and phosphorus (both, in small proportions, essential\r\nconstituents of organic matter) have allotropic modifications. Silicon,\r\ntoo, is allotropic; while its oxide, silica, which is an indispensable\r\nconstituent of many lower organisms, exhibits the analogue of\r\nallotropism--isomerism. No other interpretation being possible we are\r\nobliged to regard allotropic change as some change of molecular\r\narrangement. Hence this frequency of its occurrence among the components of\r\norganic matter is significant as implying a further kind of molecular\r\nmobility.\r\n\r\nOne more fact, that is here of great interest for us, must be set down.\r\nThese four elements of which organisms are almost wholly composed, exhibit\r\ncertain extreme unlikenesses. While between two of them we have an\r\nunsurpassed contrast in chemical activity; between one of them and the\r\nother three, we have an unsurpassed contrast in molecular mobility. While\r\ncarbon, until lately supposed to be infusible and now volatilized only in\r\nthe electric arc, shows us a degree of atomic cohesion greater than that of\r\nany other known element, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen show the least\r\natomic cohesion of all elements. And while oxygen displays, alike in the\r\nrange and intensity of its affinities, a chemical energy exceeding that of\r\nany other substance (unless fluorine be considered an exception), nitrogen\r\ndisplays the greatest chemical inactivity. Now on calling to mind one of\r\nthe general truths arrived at when analyzing the process of Evolution, the\r\nprobable significance of this double difference will be seen. It was shown\r\n(_First Principles_, § 163) that, other things equal, unlike units are more\r\neasily separated by incident forces than like units are--that an incident\r\nforce falling on units that are but little dissimilar does not readily\r\nsegregate them; but that it readily segregates them if they are widely\r\ndissimilar. Thus, the substances presenting these two extreme contrasts,\r\nthe one between physical mobilities, and the other between chemical\r\nactivities, fulfil, in the highest degree, a certain further condition to\r\nfacility of differentiation and integration.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. Among the diatomic combinations of the three elements, hydrogen,\r\nnitrogen and oxygen, we find a molecular mobility much less than that of\r\nthese elements themselves; at the same time that it is much greater than\r\nthat of diatomic compounds in general. Of the two products formed by the\r\nunion of oxygen with carbon, the first, called carbonic oxide, which\r\ncontains one atom[3] of carbon to one of oxygen (expressed by the symbol\r\nCO) is a gas condensible only with great difficulty; and the second,\r\ncarbonic acid, containing an additional atom of oxygen (CO_{2}) assumes a\r\nliquid form also only under a pressure of about forty atmospheres. The\r\nseveral compounds of oxygen with nitrogen, present us with an instructive\r\ngradation. Nitrous oxide (N_{2}O), is a gas condensible only under a\r\npressure of some fifty atmospheres; nitric oxide (NO) is a gas which\r\nalthough it has been liquefied does not condense under a pressure of 270\r\natmospheres at 46.4° F. (8° C.): the molecular mobility remaining\r\nundiminished in consequence of the volume of the united gases remaining\r\nunchanged. Nitrogen trioxide (N_{2}O_{3}) is gaseous at ordinary\r\ntemperatures, but condenses into a very volatile liquid at the zero of\r\nFahrenheit; nitrogen tetroxide (N_{2}O_{4}) is liquid at ordinary\r\ntemperatures and becomes solid at the zero of Fahrenheit; while nitrogen\r\npentoxide (N_{2}O_{5}) may be obtained in crystals which melt at 85° and\r\nboil at 113°. In this series we see, though not with complete uniformity, a\r\ndecrease of molecular mobility as the weights of the compound molecules are\r\nincreased. The hydro-carbons illustrate the same general truth still\r\nbetter. One series of them will suffice. Marsh gas (CH_{4}) is gaseous\r\nexcept under great pressure and at very low temperatures. Olefiant gas\r\n(C_{2}H_{4}) and ethane (C_{2}H_{6}) may be readily liquefied by pressure.\r\nPropane (C_{3}H_{8}) becomes liquid without pressure at the zero of\r\nFahrenheit. Hexane (C_{5}H_{12}) is a liquid which boils at 160°. And the\r\nsuccessively higher multiples, heptane (C_{7}H_{16}), octane (C_{8}H_{18}),\r\nand nonane (C_{9}H_{20}) are liquids which boil respectively at 210°, 257°,\r\nand 302°. Pentadecan (C_{15}H_{32}) is a liquid which boils at 270°, while\r\nparaffin-wax, which contains the still higher multiples, is solid.  There\r\nare three compounds of hydrogen and nitrogen that have been obtained in a\r\nfree state--ammonia (NH_{3}) is gaseous, but liquefiable by pressure, or by\r\nreducing its temperature to -40° F., and it solidifies at -112° F.;\r\nhydrazine (NH_{2}--NH_{2}) is liquid at ordinary temperatures, but\r\nhydrozoic acid (N_{3}H) has so far only been obtained in the form of a\r\nhighly explosive gas.  In cyanogen, which is composed of carbon and\r\nnitrogen, (CN)_{2}, we have a gas that becomes liquid at a pressure of four\r\natmospheres and solid at -30° F. And in paracyanogen, formed of the same\r\nproportions of these elements in higher multiples, we have a solid which\r\ndoes not fuse or volatilize at ordinary temperatures.  Lastly, in the most\r\nimportant member of this group, water (H_{2}O), we have a compound of two\r\ndifficultly-condensible gases which assumes both the fluid state and the\r\nsolid state within ordinary ranges of temperature; while its molecular\r\nmobility is still such that its fluid or solid masses are continually\r\npassing into the form of vapour, though not with great rapidity until the\r\ntemperature is raised to 212°.\r\n\r\nConsidering them chemically, it is to be remarked of these diatomic\r\ncompounds of the four chief organic elements, that they are, on the\r\naverage, less stable than diatomic compounds in general. Water, carbonic\r\noxide, and carbonic acid, are, it is true, difficult to decompose. But\r\nomitting these, the usual strength of union among the elements of the\r\nabove-named substances is low considering the simplicity of the substances.\r\nWith the exception of acetylene and possibly marsh gas, the various\r\nhydro-carbons are not producible by directly combining their elements; and\r\nthe elements of most of them are readily separable by heat without the aid\r\nof any antagonistic affinity. Nitrogen and hydrogen do not unite with each\r\nother immediately save under very exceptional circumstances; and the\r\nammonia which results from their union, though it resists heat, yields to\r\nthe electric spark. Cyanogen is stable: not being resolved into its\r\ncomponents below a bright red heat. Much less stable, however, are several\r\nof the oxides of nitrogen. Nitrous oxide, it is true, does not yield up its\r\nelements below a red heat; but nitrogen tetroxide cannot exist if water be\r\nadded to it; nitrous acid is decomposed by water; and nitric acid not only\r\nreadily parts with its oxygen to many metals, but when anhydrous,\r\nspontaneously decomposes. Here it will be well to note, as having a bearing\r\non what is to follow, how characteristic of most nitrogenous compounds is\r\nthis special instability. In all the familiar cases of sudden and violent\r\ndecomposition, the change is due to the presence of nitrogen. The explosion\r\nof gunpowder results from the readiness with which the nitrogen contained\r\nin the nitrate of potash, yields up the oxygen combined with it. The\r\nexplosion of gun-cotton, which also contains nitrogen, is a substantially\r\nparallel phenomenon. The various fulminating salts are all formed by the\r\nunion with metals of a certain nitrogenous acid called fulminic acid; which\r\nis so unstable that it cannot be obtained in a separate state.\r\nExplosiveness is a property of nitro-mannite, and also of nitro-glycerin.\r\nIodide of nitrogen detonates on the slightest touch, and often without any\r\nassignable cause. And the bodies which explode with the most tremendous\r\nviolence of any known, are the chloride of nitrogen (NCl_{3}) and hydrazoic\r\nacid (N_{3}H). Thus these easy and rapid decompositions, due to the\r\nchemical indifference of nitrogen, are characteristic. When we come\r\nhereafter to observe the part which nitrogen plays in organic actions, we\r\nshall see the significance of this extreme readiness shown by its compounds\r\nto undergo changes. Returning from these facts parenthetically introduced,\r\nwe have next to note that though among the diatomic compounds of the four\r\nchief organic elements, there are a few active ones, yet the majority of\r\nthem display a smaller degree of chemical energy than the average of\r\ndiatomic compounds. Water is the most neutral of bodies: usually producing\r\nlittle chemical alteration in the substances with which it combines; and\r\nbeing expelled from most of its combinations by a moderate heat. Carbonic\r\nacid is a relatively feeble acid: the carbonates being decomposed by the\r\nmajority of other acids and by ignition. The various hydro-carbons are but\r\nnarrow in the range of their comparatively weak affinities. The compounds\r\nformed by ammonia have not much stability: they are readily destroyed by\r\nheat, and by the other alkalies. The affinities of cyanogen are tolerably\r\nstrong, though they yield to those of the chief acids. Of the several\r\noxides of nitrogen, it is to be remarked that, while those containing the\r\nsmaller proportions of oxygen are chemically inert, the one containing the\r\ngreatest proportion of oxygen (nitric acid) though chemically active, in\r\nconsequence of the readiness with which one part of it gives up its oxygen\r\nto oxidize a base with which the rest combines, is nevertheless driven from\r\nall its combinations by a red heat.\r\n\r\nThese diatomic compounds, like their elements, are to a considerable degree\r\ncharacterized by the prevalence among them of allotropism; or, as it is\r\nmore usually called when displayed by compound bodies--isomerism. Professor\r\nGraham finds reason for thinking that a change in atomic arrangements of\r\nthis nature, takes place in water, at or near the melting point of ice. In\r\nthe various series of hydro-carbons, differing from each other only in the\r\nratios in which the elements are united, we find not simply isomerism but\r\npolymerism occurring to an almost infinite extent. In some series of\r\nhydro-carbons, as, for example, the terpenes, we find isomerism and at the\r\nsame time a great tendency to undergo polymerisation. And the relation\r\nbetween cyanogen and paracyanogen is, as we saw, a polymeric one.\r\n\r\nThere is one further fact respecting these diatomic compounds of the chief\r\norganic elements, which must not be overlooked. Those of them which form\r\nparts of the living tissues of plants and animals (excluding water which\r\nhas a mechanical function, and carbonic acid which is a product of\r\ndecomposition) belong for the most part to one group--the\r\ncarbo-hydrates.[4] And of this group, which is on the average characterized\r\nby comparative instability and inertness, these carbo-hydrates found in\r\nliving tissues are among the most unstable and inert.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. Passing now to the substances which contain three of these chief\r\norganic elements, we have first to note that along with the greater atomic\r\nweight which mostly accompanies their increased complexity, there is, on\r\nthe average, a further marked decrease of molecular mobility. Scarcely any\r\nof them maintain a gaseous state at ordinary temperatures. One class of\r\nthem only, the alcohols and their derivatives, evaporate under the usual\r\natmospheric pressure; but not rapidly unless heated. The fixed oils, though\r\nthey show that molecular mobility implied by an habitually liquid state,\r\nshow this in a lower degree than the alcoholic compounds; and they cannot\r\nbe reduced to the gaseous state without decomposition. In their allies, the\r\nfats, which are solid unless heated, the loss of molecular mobility is\r\nstill more marked. And throughout the whole series of the fatty acids, in\r\nwhich to a fixed proportion of oxygen there are successively added higher\r\nequimultiples of carbon and hydrogen, we see how the molecular mobility\r\ndecreases with the increasing sizes of the molecules. In the amylaceous and\r\nsugar-group of compounds, solidity is the habitual state: such of them as\r\ncan assume the liquid form, doing so only when heated to 300° or 400° F.;\r\nand decomposing when further heated, rather than become gaseous. Resins and\r\ngums exhibit general physical properties of like character and meaning.\r\n\r\nIn chemical stability these triatomic compounds, considered as a group, are\r\nin a marked degree below the diatomic ones. The various sugars and kindred\r\nbodies, decompose at no very high temperatures. The oils and fats also are\r\nreadily carbonized by heat. Resinous and gummy substances are easily made\r\nto render up some of their constituents. And the alcohols, with their\r\nallies, have no great power of resisting decomposition. These bodies,\r\nformed by the union of oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon, are also, as a class,\r\nchemically inactive. Formic and acetic are doubtless energetic acids; but\r\nthe higher members of the fatty-acid series are easily separated from the\r\nbases with which they combine. Saccharic acid, too, is an acid of\r\nconsiderable power; and sundry of the vegetable acids possess a certain\r\nactivity, though an activity far less than that of the mineral acids. But\r\nthroughout the rest of the group, there is shown but a small tendency to\r\ncombine with other bodies; and such combinations as are formed have usually\r\nlittle permanence.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of isomerism and polymerism are of frequent occurrence in\r\nthese triatomic compounds. Starch and dextrine are probably polymeric.\r\nFruit-sugar and grape-sugar, mannite and sorbite, cane-sugar and\r\nmilk-sugar, are isomeric. Sundry of the vegetal acids exhibit similar\r\nmodifications. And among the resins and gums, with their derivatives,\r\nmolecular re-arrangements of this kind are not uncommon.\r\n\r\nOne further fact respecting these compounds of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen,\r\nshould be mentioned; namely, that they are divisible into two classes--the\r\none consisting of substances that result from the destructive decomposition\r\nof organic matter, and the other consisting of substances that exist as\r\nsuch in organic matter. These two classes of substances exhibit, in\r\ndifferent degrees, the properties to which we have been directing our\r\nattention. The lower alcohols, their allies and derivatives, which possess\r\ngreater molecular mobility and chemical stability than the rest of these\r\ntriatomic compounds, are rarely found in animal or vegetal bodies. While\r\nthe sugars and amylaceous substances, the fixed oils and fats, the gums and\r\nresins, which have all of them much less molecular mobility, and are,\r\nchemically considered, more unstable and inert, are components of the\r\nliving tissues of plants and animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4. Among compounds containing all the four chief organic elements, a\r\ndivision analogous to that just named may be made. There are some which\r\nresult from the decomposition of living tissues; there are others which\r\nmake parts of living tissues in their state of integrity; and these two\r\ngroups are contrasted in their properties in the same way as are the\r\nparallel groups of triatomic compounds.\r\n\r\nOf the first division, certain products found in the animal excretions are\r\nthe most important, and the only ones that need be noted; such, namely, as\r\nurea, kreatine, kreatinine. These animal-bases exhibit much less molecular\r\nmobility than the average of the substances treated of in the last section:\r\nbeing solid at ordinary temperatures, fusing, where fusible at all, at\r\ntemperatures above that of boiling water, and having no power to assume a\r\ngaseous state. Chemically considered, their stability is low, and their\r\nactivity but small, in comparison with the stabilities and activities of\r\nthe simpler compounds.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, the nitrogenous constituents of living tissues, that\r\ndisplay most markedly those characteristics of which we have been tracing\r\nthe growth. Albumen, fibrin, casein, and their allies, are bodies in which\r\nthat molecular mobility exhibited by three of their components in so high a\r\ndegree is reduced to a minimum. These substances are known only in the\r\nsolid state. That is to say, when deprived of the water usually mixed with\r\nthem, they do not admit of fusion, much less of volatilization. To which\r\nadd, that they have not even that molecular mobility which solution in\r\nwater implies; since, though they form viscid mixtures with water, they do\r\nnot dissolve in the same perfect way as do inorganic compounds. The\r\nchemical characteristics of these substances are instability and inertness\r\ncarried to the extreme. How rapidly albumenoid matters decompose under\r\nordinary conditions, is daily seen: the difficulty of every housewife being\r\nto prevent them from decomposing. It is true that when desiccated and kept\r\nfrom contact with air, they may be preserved unchanged for long periods;\r\nbut the fact that they can be only thus preserved, proves their great\r\ninstability. It is true, also, that these most complex nitrogenous\r\nprinciples are not absolutely inert, since they enter into combinations\r\nwith some bases; but their unions are very feeble.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted, too, of these bodies, that though they exhibit in the\r\nlowest degree that kind of molecular mobility which implies facile\r\nvibration of the molecules as wholes, they exhibit in high degrees that\r\nkind of molecular mobility resulting in isomerism, which implies permanent\r\nchanges in the positions of adjacent atoms with respect to each other. Each\r\nof them has a soluble and an insoluble form. In some cases there are\r\nindications of more than two such forms. And it appears that their\r\nmetamorphoses take place under very slight changes of conditions.\r\n\r\nIn these most unstable and inert organic compounds, we find that the\r\nmolecular complexity reaches a maximum: not only since the four chief\r\norganic elements are here united with small proportions of sulphur and\r\nsometimes phosphorus; but also since they are united in high multiples. The\r\npeculiarity which we found characterized even diatomic compounds of the\r\norganic elements, that their molecules are formed not of single equivalents\r\nof each component, but of two, three, four, and more equivalents, is\r\ncarried to the greatest extreme in these compounds, which take the leading\r\npart in organic actions. According to Lieberkühn, the formula of albumen is\r\nC_{72}H_{112}SN_{18}O_{22}. That is to say, with the sulphur there are\r\nunited seventy-two atoms of carbon, one hundred and twelve of hydrogen,\r\neighteen of nitrogen, and twenty-two of oxygen: the molecule being thus\r\nmade up of more than two hundred ultimate atoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5. Did space permit, it would be useful here to consider in detail the\r\ninterpretations that may be given of the peculiarities we have been\r\ntracing: bringing to their solution, the general mechanical principles\r\nwhich are now found to hold true of molecules as of masses. But it must\r\nsuffice briefly to indicate the conclusions which such an inquiry promises\r\nto bring out.\r\n\r\nProceeding on these principles, it may be argued that the molecular\r\nmobility of a substance must depend partly on the inertia of its molecules;\r\npartly on the intensity of their mutual polarities; partly on their mutual\r\npressures, as determined by the density of their aggregation; and (where\r\nthe molecules are compound) partly on the molecular mobilities of their\r\ncomponent molecules. Whence it is to be inferred that any three of these\r\nremaining constant, the molecular mobility will vary as the fourth. Other\r\nthings equal, therefore, the molecular mobility of molecules must decrease\r\nas their masses increase; and so there must result that progression we have\r\ntraced, from the high molecular mobility of the uncombined organic\r\nelements, to the low molecular mobility of those large-moleculed substances\r\ninto which they are ultimately compounded.\r\n\r\nApplying to molecules the mechanical law which holds of masses, that since\r\ninertia and gravity increase as the cubes of the dimensions while cohesion\r\nincreases as their squares, the self-sustaining power of a body becomes\r\nrelatively smaller as its bulk becomes greater; it might be argued that\r\nthese large, aggregate molecules which constitute organic substances, are\r\nmechanically weak--are less able than simpler molecules to bear, without\r\nalteration, the forces falling on them. That very massiveness which renders\r\nthem less mobile, enables the physical forces acting on them more readily\r\nto change the relative positions of their component atoms; and so to\r\nproduce what we know as re-arrangements and decompositions.\r\n\r\nFurther, it seems a not improbable conclusion, that this formation of large\r\naggregates of elementary atoms and resulting diminution of self-sustaining\r\npower, must be accompanied by a decrease of those dimensional contrasts to\r\nwhich polarity is ascribable. A sphere is the figure of equilibrium which\r\nany aggregate of units tends to assume, under the influence of simple\r\nmutual attraction. Where the number of units is small and their mutual\r\npolarities are decided, this proclivity towards spherical grouping will be\r\novercome by the tendency towards some more special form, determined by\r\ntheir mutual polarities. But it is manifest that in proportion as an\r\naggregate molecule becomes larger, the effects of simple mutual attraction\r\nmust become relatively greater; and so must tend to mask the effects of\r\npolar attraction. There will consequently be apt to result in highly\r\ncompound molecules like these organic ones, containing hundreds of\r\nelementary atoms, such approximation to the spherical form as must involve\r\na less distinct polarity than in simpler molecules. If this inference be\r\ncorrect, it supplies us with an explanation both of the chemical inertness\r\nof these most complex organic substances, and of their inability to\r\ncrystallize.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6. Here we are naturally introduced to another aspect of our subject--an\r\naspect of great interest. Professor Graham has published a series of\r\nimportant researches, which promise to throw much light on the constitution\r\nand changes of organic matter. He shows that solid substances exist under\r\ntwo forms of aggregation--the _colloid_ or jelly-like, and the\r\n_crystalloid_ or crystal-like. Examples of the last are too familiar to\r\nneed specifying. Of the first may be named such instances as \"hydrated\r\nsilicic acid, hydrated alumina, and other metallic peroxides of the\r\naluminous class, when they exist in the soluble form; with starch, dextrine\r\nand the gums, caramel, tannin, albumen, gelatine, vegetable and animal\r\nextractive matters.\" Describing the properties of colloids, Professor\r\nGraham says:--\"Although often largely soluble in water, they are held in\r\nsolution by a most feeble force. They appear singularly inert in the\r\ncapacity of acids and bases, and in all the ordinary chemical relations.\" *\r\n* * \"Although chemically inert in the ordinary sense, colloids possess a\r\ncompensating activity of their own arising out of their physical\r\nproperties. While the rigidity of the crystalline structure shuts out\r\nexternal impressions, the softness of the gelatinous colloid partakes of\r\nfluidity, and enables the colloid to become a medium of liquid diffusion,\r\nlike water itself.\" * * * \"Hence a wide sensibility on the part of colloids\r\nto external agents. Another and eminently characteristic quality of\r\ncolloids is their mutability.\" * * * \"The solution of hydrated silicic\r\nacid, for instance, is easily obtained in a state of purity, but it cannot\r\nbe preserved. It may remain fluid for days or weeks in a sealed tube, but\r\nis sure to gelatinize and become insoluble at last. Nor does the change of\r\nthis colloid appear to stop at that point; for the mineral forms of silicic\r\nacid, deposited from water, such as flint, are often found to have passed,\r\nduring the geological ages of their existence, from the vitreous or\r\ncolloidal into the crystalline condition (H. Rose). The colloid is, in\r\nfact, a dynamical state of matter, the crystalloidal being the statical\r\ncondition. The colloid possesses _energia_. It may be looked upon as the\r\nprimary source of the force appearing in the phenomena of vitality. To the\r\ngradual manner in which colloidal changes take place (for they always\r\ndemand time as an element) may the characteristic protraction of\r\nchemico-organic changes also be referred.\"\r\n\r\nThe class of colloids includes not only all those most complex nitrogenous\r\ncompounds characteristic of organic tissues, and sundry of the\r\ncarbo-hydrates found along with them; but, significantly enough, it\r\nincludes several of those substances classed as inorganic, which enter into\r\norganized structures. Thus silica, which is a component of many plants, and\r\nconstitutes the spicules of sponges as well as the shells of many\r\nforaminifera and infusoria, has a colloid, as well as a crystalloid,\r\ncondition. A solution of hydrated silicic acid passes in the course of a\r\nfew days into a solid jelly that is no longer soluble in water; and it may\r\nbe suddenly thus coagulated by a minute portion of an alkaline carbonate,\r\nas well as by gelatine, alumina, and peroxide of iron. This last-named\r\nsubstance, too--peroxide of iron--which is an ingredient in the blood of\r\nmammals and composes the shells of certain _Protozoa_, has a colloid\r\ncondition. \"Water containing about one per cent. of hydrated peroxide of\r\niron in solution, has the dark red colour of venous blood.\" * * * \"The red\r\nsolution is coagulated in the cold by traces of sulphuric acid, alkalies,\r\nalkaline carbonates, sulphates, and neutral salts in general.\" * * * \"The\r\ncoagulum is a deep red-coloured jelly, resembling the clot of blood, but\r\nmore transparent. Indeed, the coagulum of this colloid is highly suggestive\r\nof that of blood, from the feeble agencies which suffice to effect the\r\nchange in question, as well as from the appearance of the product.\" The\r\njelly thus formed soon becomes, like the last, insoluble in water. Lime\r\nalso, which is so important a mineral element in living bodies, animal and\r\nvegetal, enters into a compound belonging to this class. \"The well-known\r\nsolution of lime in sugar forms a solid coagulum when heated. It is\r\nprobably, at a high temperature, entirely colloidal.\"\r\n\r\nGeneralizing some of the facts which he gives, Professor Graham says:--\"The\r\nequivalent of a colloid appears to be always high, although the ratio\r\nbetween the elements of the substance may be simple. Gummic acid, for\r\ninstance, may be represented by C^{12}H^{22}O^{11}; but, judging from the\r\nsmall proportions of lime and potash which suffice to neutralize this acid,\r\nthe true numbers of its formula must be several times greater. It is\r\ndifficult to avoid associating the inertness of colloids with their high\r\nequivalents, particularly where the high number appears to be attained by\r\nthe repetition of a small number. The inquiry suggests itself whether the\r\ncolloid molecule may not be constituted by the grouping together of a\r\nnumber of smaller crystalloid molecules, and whether the basis of\r\ncolloidality may not really be this composite character of the molecule.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 7. A further contrast between colloids and crystalloids is equally\r\nsignificant in its relations to vital phenomena. Professor Graham points\r\nout that the marked differences in volatility displayed by different\r\nbodies, are paralleled by differences in the rates of diffusion of\r\ndifferent bodies through liquids. As alcohol and ether at ordinary\r\ntemperatures, and various other substances at higher temperatures, diffuse\r\nthemselves in a gaseous form through the air; so, a substance in aqueous\r\nsolution, when placed in contact with a mass of water (in such way as to\r\navoid mixture by circulating currents) diffuses itself through this mass of\r\nwater. And just as there are various degrees of rapidity in evaporation, so\r\nthere are various degrees of rapidity in diffusion: \"the range also in the\r\ndegree of diffusive mobility exhibited by different substances appears to\r\nbe as wide as the scale of vapour-tensions.\" This parallelism is what might\r\nhave been looked for; since the tendency to assume a gaseous state, and the\r\ntendency to spread in solution through a liquid, are both consequences of\r\nmolecular mobility. It also turns out, as was to be expected, that\r\ndiffusibility, like volatility, has, other things equal, a relation to\r\nmolecular weight--other things equal, we must say, because molecular\r\nmobility must, as pointed out in § 5, be affected by other properties of\r\natoms, besides their inertia. Thus the substance most rapidly diffused of\r\nany on which Professor Graham experimented, was hydrochloric acid--a\r\ncompound which is of low molecular weight, is gaseous save under a pressure\r\nof forty atmospheres, and ordinarily exists as a liquid, only in\r\ncombination with water. Again, \"hydrate of potash may be said to possess\r\ndouble the velocity of diffusion of sulphate of potash, and sulphate of\r\npotash again double the velocity of sugar, alcohol, and sulphate of\r\nmagnesia,\"--differences which have a general correspondence with\r\ndifferences in the massiveness of their molecules.\r\n\r\nBut the fact of chief interest to us here, is that the relatively\r\nsmall-moleculed crystalloids have immensely greater diffusive power than\r\nthe relatively large-moleculed colloids. Among the crystalloids themselves\r\nthere are marked differences of diffusibility; and among the colloids\r\nthemselves there are parallel differences, though less marked ones. But\r\nthese differences are small compared with that between the diffusibility of\r\nthe crystalloids as a class, and the diffusibility of the colloids as a\r\nclass. Hydrochloric acid is seven times as diffusible as sulphate of\r\nmagnesia; but it is fifty times as diffusible as albumen, and a hundred\r\ntimes as diffusible as caramel.\r\n\r\nThese differences of diffusibility manifest themselves with nearly equal\r\ndistinctness, when a permeable septum is placed between the solution and\r\nthe water. The result is that when a solution contains substances of\r\ndifferent diffusibilities, the process of dialysis, as Professor Graham\r\ncalls it, becomes a means of separating the mixed substances: especially\r\nwhen such mixed substances are partly crystalloids and partly colloids. The\r\nbearing of this fact on the interpretation of organic processes will be\r\nobvious.  Still more obvious will its bearing be, on joining with it the\r\nremarkable fact that while crystalloids can diffuse themselves through\r\ncolloids nearly as rapidly as through water, colloids can scarcely diffuse\r\nthemselves at all through other colloids. From a mass of jelly containing\r\nsalt, into an adjoining mass of jelly containing no salt, the salt spread\r\nmore in eight days than it spread through water in seven days; while the\r\nspread of \"caramel through the jelly appeared scarcely to have begun after\r\neight days had elapsed.\" So that we must regard the colloidal compounds of\r\nwhich organisms are built, as having, by their physical nature, the ability\r\nto separate colloids from crystalloids, and to let the crystalloids pass\r\nthrough them with scarcely any resistance.\r\n\r\nOne other result of these researches on the relative diffusibilities of\r\ndifferent substances has a meaning for us. Professor Graham finds that not\r\nonly does there take place, by dialysis, a separation of _mixed_ substances\r\nwhich are unlike in their molecular mobilities; but also that _combined_\r\nsubstances between which the affinities are feeble, will separate on the\r\ndialyzer, if their molecular mobilities are strongly contrasted. Speaking\r\nof the hydrochloride of peroxide of iron, he says, \"such a compound\r\npossesses an element of instability in the extremely unequal diffusibility\r\nof its constituents;\" and he points out that when dialyzed, the\r\nhydrochloric acid gradually diffuses away, leaving the colloidal peroxide\r\nof iron behind. Similarly, he remarks of the peracetate of iron, that it\r\n\"may be made a source of soluble peroxide, as the salt referred to is\r\nitself decomposed to a great extent by diffusion on the dialyzer.\" Now this\r\ntendency to separate displayed by substances which differ widely in their\r\nmolecular mobilities, though usually so far antagonized by their affinities\r\nas not to produce spontaneous decomposition, must, in all cases, induce a\r\ncertain readiness to change which would not else exist. The unequal\r\nmobilities of the combined atoms must give disturbing forces a greater\r\npower to work transformations than they would otherwise have. Hence the\r\nprobable significance of a fact named at the outset, that while three of\r\nthe chief organic elements have the greatest atomic mobilities of any\r\nelements known, the fourth, carbon, has the least atomic mobility of known\r\nelements. Though, in its simple compounds, the affinities of carbon for the\r\nrest are strong enough to prevent the effects of this great difference from\r\nclearly showing themselves; yet there seems reason to think that in those\r\ncomplex compounds composing organic bodies--compounds in which there are\r\nvarious cross affinities leading to a state of chemical tension--this\r\nextreme difference in the molecular mobilities must be an important aid to\r\nmolecular re-arrangements. In short, we are here led by concrete evidence\r\nto the conclusion which we before drew from first principles, that this\r\ngreat unlikeness among the combined units must facilitate differentiations.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 8. A portion of organic matter in a state to exhibit those phenomena\r\nwhich the biologist deals with, is, however, something far more complex\r\nthan the separate organic matters we have been studying; since a portion of\r\norganic matter in its integrity, contains several of these.\r\n\r\nIn the first place no one of those colloids which make up the mass of a\r\nliving body, appears capable of carrying on vital changes by itself: it is\r\nalways associated with other colloids. A portion of animal-tissue, however\r\nminute, almost always contains more than one form of protein-substance:\r\ndifferent chemical modifications of albumen and gelatine are present\r\ntogether, as well as, probably, a soluble and insoluble modification of\r\neach; and there is usually more or less of fatty matter. In a single\r\nvegetal cell, the minute quantity of nitrogenous colloid present, is\r\nimbedded in colloids of the non-nitrogenous class. And the microscope makes\r\nit at once manifest, that even the smallest and simplest organic forms are\r\nnot absolutely homogeneous.\r\n\r\nFurther, we have to contemplate organic tissue, formed of mingled colloids\r\nin both soluble and insoluble states, as permeated throughout by\r\ncrystalloids. Some of these crystalloids, as oxygen,[5] water, and perhaps\r\ncertain salts, are agents of decomposition; some, as the saccharine and\r\nfatty matters, are probably materials for decomposition; and some, as\r\ncarbonic acid, water, urea, kreatine, and kreatinine, are products of\r\ndecomposition. Into the mass of mingled colloids, mostly insoluble and\r\nwhere soluble of very low molecular mobility or diffusive power, we have\r\nconstantly passing, crystalloids of high molecular mobility or diffusive\r\npower, that are capable of decomposing these complex colloids, or of\r\nfacilitating decompositions otherwise caused; and from these complex\r\ncolloids, when decomposed, there result other crystalloids (the two chief\r\nones extremely simple and mobile, and the rest comparatively so) which\r\ndiffuse away as rapidly as they are formed.\r\n\r\nAnd now we may clearly see the necessity for that peculiar composition\r\nwhich we find in organic matter. On the one hand, were it not for the\r\nextreme molecular mobility possessed by three out of the four of its chief\r\nelements; and were it not for the consequently high molecular mobility of\r\ntheir simpler compounds; there could not be this quick escape of the waste\r\nproducts of organic action; and there could not be that continuously active\r\nchange of matter which vitality implies. On the other hand, were it not for\r\nthe union of these extremely mobile elements into immensely complex\r\ncompounds, having relatively vast molecules which are made comparatively\r\nimmobile by their inertia, there could not result that mechanical fixity\r\nwhich prevents the components of living tissue from diffusing away along\r\nwith the effete matters produced by decomposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 8a. Let us not omit here to note the ways in which the genesis of these\r\ntraits distinguishing organic matter conforms to the laws of evolution as\r\nexpressed in its general formula.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the belief now widely entertained by chemists that the\r\nso-called elements are not elements, but are composed of simpler matters\r\nand probably of one ultimate form of matter (for which the name \"protyle\"\r\nhas been suggested by Sir W. Crookes), it is to be concluded that the\r\nformation of the elements, in common with the formation of all those\r\ncompounds of them which Nature presents, took place in the course of Cosmic\r\nEvolution. Various reasons for this inference the reader will find set\r\nforth in the Addenda to an essay on \"The Nebular Hypothesis\" (see _Essays_,\r\nvol. I, p. 155). On tracing out the process of compounding and\r\nre-compounding by which, hypothetically, the elements themselves and\r\nafterwards their compounds and re-compounds have arisen, certain cardinal\r\nfacts become manifest.\r\n\r\n1. Considered as masses, the units of the elements are the smallest, though\r\nlarger than the units of the primordial matter. Later than these, since\r\nthey are composed of them, and since they cannot exist at temperatures so\r\nhigh as those at which the elements can exist, come the diatomic\r\ncompounds--oxides, chlorides, and the rest--necessarily larger in their\r\nmolecules. Above these in massiveness come the molecules of the\r\nmultitudinous salts and kindred bodies. When associated, as these commonly\r\nare, with molecules of water, there again results in each case increase of\r\nmass; and unable as they are to bear such high temperatures, these\r\nmolecules are necessarily later in origin than those of the anhydrous\r\ndiatomic compounds. Within the general class of triatomic compounds, more\r\ncomposite still, come the carbohydrates, which, being able to unite in\r\nmultiples, form still larger molecules than other triatomic compounds.\r\nDecomposing as they do at relatively low temperatures, these are still more\r\nrecent in the course of chemical evolution; and with the genesis of them\r\nthe way is prepared for the genesis of organic matter strictly so called.\r\nThis includes the various forms of protein-substance, containing four chief\r\nelements with two minor ones, and having relatively vast molecules.\r\nUnstable as these are in presence of heat and surrounding affinities, they\r\nbecame possible only at a late stage in the genesis of the Earth. Here,\r\nthen, in that chemical evolution which preceded the evolution of life, we\r\nsee displayed that process of integration which is the primary trait of\r\nevolution at large.\r\n\r\n2. Along with increasing integration has gone progress in heterogeneity.\r\nThe elements, regarding them as compound, are severally more heterogeneous\r\nthan \"protyle.\" Diatomic molecules are more heterogeneous than these\r\nelements; triatomic more heterogeneous than diatomic; and the molecules\r\ncontaining four elements more heterogeneous than those containing three:\r\nthe most heterogeneous of them being the proteids, which contain two other\r\nelements. The hydrated forms of all these compounds are more heterogeneous\r\nthan are the anhydrous forms. And most heterogeneous of all are the\r\nmolecules which, besides containing three, four, or more elements, also\r\nexhibit the isomerism and polymerism which imply unions in multiples.\r\n\r\n3. This formation of molecules more and more heterogeneous during\r\nterrestrial evolution, has been accompanied by increasing heterogeneity in\r\nthe aggregate of compounds of each kind, as well as an increasing number of\r\nkinds; and this increasing heterogeneity is exemplified in an extreme\r\ndegree in the compounds, non-nitrogenous and nitrogenous, out of which\r\norganisms are built. So that the classes, orders, genera, and species of\r\nchemical substances, gradually increasing as the Earth has assumed its\r\npresent form, increased in a transcendent degree during that stage which\r\npreceded the origin of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 9. Returning now from these partially-parenthetic observations, and\r\nsumming up the contents of the preceding pages, we have to remark that in\r\nthe substances of which organisms are composed, the conditions necessary to\r\nthat re-distribution of Matter and Motion which constitutes Evolution, are\r\nfulfilled in a far higher degree than at first appears.\r\n\r\nThe mutual affinities of the chief organic elements are not active within\r\nthe limits of those temperatures at which organic actions take place; and\r\none of these elements is especially characterized by its chemical\r\nindifference. The compounds formed by these elements in ascending grades of\r\ncomplexity, become progressively less stable. And those most complex\r\ncompounds into which all these four elements enter, together with small\r\nproportions of two other elements which very readily oxidize, have an\r\ninstability so great that decomposition ensues under ordinary atmospheric\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nAmong these elements out of which living bodies are built, there is an\r\nunusual tendency to unite in multiples; and so to form groups of products\r\nwhich have the same chemical elements in the same proportions, but,\r\ndiffering in their modes of aggregation, possess different properties. This\r\nprevalence among them of isomerism and polymerism, shows, in another way,\r\nthe special fitness of organic substances for undergoing re-distributions\r\nof their components.\r\n\r\nIn those most complex compounds that are instrumental to vital actions,\r\nthere exists a kind and degree of molecular mobility which constitutes the\r\nplastic quality fitting them for organization. Instead of the extreme\r\nmolecular mobility possessed by three out of the four organic elements in\r\ntheir separate states--instead of the diminished, but still great,\r\nmolecular mobility possessed by their simpler combinations, the gaseous and\r\nliquid characters of which unfit them for showing to any extent the process\r\nof Evolution--instead of the physical properties of their less simple\r\ncombinations, which, when not made unduly mobile by heat, assume the unduly\r\nrigid form of crystals; we have in these colloids, of which organisms are\r\nmainly composed, just the required compromise between fluidity and\r\nsolidity. They cannot be reduced to the unduly mobile conditions of liquid\r\nand gas; and yet they do not assume the unduly fixed condition usually\r\ncharacterizing solids. The absence of power to unite together in polar\r\narrangement, leaves their molecules with a certain freedom of relative\r\nmovement, which makes them sensitive to small forces, and produces\r\nplasticity in the aggregates composed of them.\r\n\r\nWhile the relatively great inertia of these large and complex organic\r\nmolecules renders them comparatively incapable of being set in motion by\r\nthe ethereal undulations, and so reduced to less coherent forms of\r\naggregation, this same inertia facilitates changes of arrangement among\r\ntheir constituent molecules or atoms; since, in proportion as an incident\r\nforce impresses but little motion on a mass, it is the better able to\r\nimpress motion on the parts of the mass in relation to one another. And it\r\nis further probable that the extreme contrasts in molecular mobilities\r\namong the components of these highly complex molecules, aid in producing\r\nmodifiability of arrangement among them.\r\n\r\nLastly, the great difference in diffusibility between colloids and\r\ncrystalloids, makes possible in the tissues of organisms a specially rapid\r\nre-distribution of matter and motion; both because colloids, being easily\r\npermeable by crystalloids, can be chemically acted on throughout their\r\nwhole masses, instead of only on their surfaces; and because the products\r\nof decomposition, being also crystalloids, can escape as fast as they are\r\nproduced: leaving room for further transformations. So that while the\r\ncomposite molecules of which organic tissues are built up, possess that low\r\nmolecular mobility fitting them for plastic purposes, it results from the\r\nextreme molecular mobilities of their ultimate constituents, that the waste\r\nproducts of vital activity escape as fast as they are formed.\r\n\r\nTo all which add that the state of warmth, or increased molecular\r\nvibration, in which all the higher organisms are kept, increases these\r\nvarious facilities for re-distribution: not only as aiding chemical\r\nchanges, but as accelerating the diffusion of crystalloid substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE ACTIONS OF FORCES ON ORGANIC MATTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 10. To some extent, the parts of every body are changed in their\r\narrangement by any incident mechanical force. But in organic bodies, and\r\nespecially in animal bodies, the changes of arrangement produced by\r\nmechanical forces are usually conspicuous. It is a distinctive mark of\r\ncolloids that they readily yield to pressures and tensions, and that they\r\nrecover, more or less completely, their original shapes, when the pressures\r\nor tensions cease. Evidently without this pliability and elasticity, most\r\norganic actions would be impossible. Not only temporary but also permanent\r\nalterations of form are facilitated by this colloid character of organic\r\nmatter. Continued pressure on living tissue, by modifying the processes\r\ngoing on in it (perhaps retarding the absorption of new material to replace\r\nthe old that has decomposed and diffused away), gradually diminishes and\r\nfinally destroys its power of resuming the outline it had at first. Thus,\r\ngenerally speaking, the substances composing organisms are modifiable by\r\narrested momentum or by continuous strain, in far greater degrees than are\r\ninorganic substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 11. Sensitiveness to certain forces which are quasi-mechanical, if not\r\nmechanical in the usual sense, is seen in two closely-related peculiarities\r\ndisplayed by organic matter as well as other matter which assumes the same\r\nstate of molecular aggregation.\r\n\r\nColloids take up by a power called \"capillary affinity,\" a large quantity\r\nof water: undergoing at the same time great increase of bulk with change of\r\nform. Conversely, with like readiness, they give up this water by\r\nevaporation; resuming, partially or completely, their original states.\r\nWhether resulting from capillarity, or from the relatively great\r\ndiffusibility of water, or from both, these changes are to be here noted as\r\nshowing another mode in which the arrangements of parts in organic bodies\r\nare affected by mechanical actions.\r\n\r\nIn what is termed osmose, we have a further mode of an allied kind. When on\r\nopposite sides of a permeable septum, and especially a septum of colloidal\r\nsubstance, are placed miscible solutions of different densities, a double\r\ntransfer takes place: a large quantity of the less dense solution finds its\r\nway through the septum into the more dense solution; and a small quantity\r\nof the more dense finds its way into the less dense--one result being a\r\nconsiderable increase in the bulk of the more dense at the expense of the\r\nless dense. This process, which appears to depend on several conditions, is\r\nnot yet fully understood. But be the explanation what it may, the process\r\nis one that tends continually to work alterations in organic bodies.\r\nThrough the surfaces of plants and animals, transfers of this kind are ever\r\ntaking place. Many of the conspicuous changes of form undergone by organic\r\ngerms, are due mainly to the permeation of their limiting membranes by the\r\nsurrounding liquids.\r\n\r\nIt should be added that besides the direct alterations which the imbibition\r\nand transmission of water and watery solutions by colloids produce in\r\norganic matter, they produce indirect alterations. Being instrumental in\r\nconveying into the tissues the agents of chemical change, and conveying out\r\nof them the products of chemical change, they aid in carrying on other\r\nre-distributions.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 12. As elsewhere shown (_First Principles_, § 100) heat, or a raised\r\nstate of molecular vibration, enables incident forces more easily to\r\nproduce changes of molecular arrangement in organic matter. But besides\r\nthis, it conduces to certain vital changes in so direct a way as to become\r\ntheir chief cause.\r\n\r\nThe power of the organic colloids to imbibe water, and to bring along with\r\nit into their substance the materials which work transformations, would not\r\nbe continuously operative if the water imbibed were to remain. It is\r\nbecause it escapes, and is replaced by more water containing more\r\nmaterials, that the succession of changes is maintained. Among the higher\r\nanimals and higher plants its escape is facilitated by evaporation. And the\r\nrate of evaporation is, other things equal, determined by heat. Though the\r\ncurrent of sap in a tree is partly dependent on some action, probably\r\nosmotic, that goes on in the roots; yet the loss of water from the surfaces\r\nof the leaves, and the consequent absorption of more sap into the leaves by\r\ncapillary attraction, must be a chief cause of the circulation. The\r\ndrooping of a plant when exposed to the sunshine while the earth round its\r\nroots is dry, shows us how evaporation empties the sap-vessels; and the\r\nquickness with which a withered slip revives on being placed in water,\r\nshows us the part which capillary action plays. In so far, then, as the\r\nevaporation from a plant's surface helps to produce currents of sap through\r\nthe plant, we must regard the heat which produces this evaporation as a\r\npart-cause of those re-distributions of matter which these currents effect.\r\nIn terrestrial animals, heat, by its indirect action as well as by its\r\ndirect action, similarly aids the changes that are going on. The exhalation\r\nof vapour from the lungs and the surface of the skin, forming the chief\r\nescape of the water that is swallowed, conduces to the maintenance of those\r\ncurrents through the tissues without which the functions would cease. For\r\nthough the vascular system distributes nutritive liquids in ramified\r\nchannels through the body; yet the absorption of these liquids into\r\ntissues, partly depends on the escape of liquids which the tissues already\r\ncontain. Hence, to the extent that such escape is facilitated by\r\nevaporation, and this evaporation facilitated by heat, heat becomes an\r\nagent of re-distribution in the animal organism.[6]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 13. Light, which is now known to modify many inorganic compounds--light,\r\nwhich works those chemical changes utilized in photography, causes the\r\ncombinations of certain gases, alters the molecular arrangements of many\r\ncrystals, and leaves traces of its action even on substances that are\r\nextremely stable,--may be expected to produce marked effects on substances\r\nso complex and unstable as those which make up organic bodies. It does\r\nproduce such effects; and some of them are among the most important that\r\norganic matter undergoes.\r\n\r\nThe molecular changes wrought by light in animals are of but secondary\r\nmoment. There is the darkening of the skin that follows exposure to the\r\nSun's rays. There are those alterations in the retina which cause in us\r\nsensations of colours. And on certain eyeless creatures that are\r\nsemi-transparent, the light permeating their substance works some effects\r\nevinced by movements. But speaking generally, the opacity of animals limits\r\nthe action of light to their surfaces; and so renders its direct\r\nphysiological influence but small.[7] On plants, however, the solar rays\r\nthat produce in us the impression of yellow, are the immediate agents of\r\nthose molecular changes through which are hourly accumulated the materials\r\nfor further growth. Experiments have shown that when the Sun shines on\r\nliving leaves, they begin to exhale oxygen and to accumulate carbon and\r\nhydrogen--results which are traced to the decomposition, by the solar rays,\r\nof the carbonic acid and water absorbed. It is now an accepted conclusion\r\nthat, by the help of certain classes of the ethereal undulations\r\npenetrating their leaves, plants are enabled to separate from the\r\nassociated oxygen those two elements of which their tissues are chiefly\r\nbuilt up.\r\n\r\nThis transformation of ethereal undulations into certain molecular\r\nre-arrangements of an unstable kind, on the overthrow of which the\r\nstored-up forces are liberated in new forms, is a process that underlies\r\nall organic phenomena. It will therefore be well if we pause a moment to\r\nconsider whether any proximate interpretation of it is possible. Researches\r\nin molecular physics give us some clue to its nature.\r\n\r\nThe elements of the problem are these:--The atoms[8] of several ponderable\r\nmatters exist in combination: those which are combined having strong\r\naffinities, but having also affinities less strong for some of the\r\nsurrounding atoms that are otherwise combined. The atoms thus united, and\r\nthus mixed among others with which they are capable of uniting, are exposed\r\nto the undulations of a medium that is so rare as to seem imponderable.\r\nThese undulations are of numerous kinds: they differ greatly in their\r\nlengths, or in the frequency with which they recur at any given point. And\r\nunder the influence of undulations of a certain frequency, some of these\r\natoms are transferred from atoms for which they have a stronger affinity,\r\nto atoms for which they have a weaker affinity. That is to say, particular\r\norders of waves of a relatively imponderable matter, remove particular\r\natoms of ponderable matter from their attachments, and carry them within\r\nreach of other attachments. Now the discoveries of Bunsen and Kirchoff\r\nrespecting the absorption of particular luminiferous undulations by the\r\nvapours of particular substances, joined with Prof. Tyndall's discoveries\r\nrespecting the absorption of heat by gases, show very clearly that the\r\natoms of each substance have a rate of vibration in harmony with ethereal\r\nwaves of a certain length, or rapidity of recurrence. Every special kind of\r\natom can be made to oscillate by a special order of ethereal waves, which\r\nare absorbed in producing its oscillations; and can by its oscillations\r\ngenerate this same order of ethereal waves. Whence it appears that immense\r\nas is the difference in density between ether and ponderable matter, the\r\nwaves of the one can set the atoms of the other in motion, when the\r\nsuccessive impacts of the waves are so timed as to correspond with the\r\noscillations of the atoms. The effects of the waves are, in such case,\r\ncumulative; and each atom gradually acquires a momentum made up of\r\ncountless infinitesimal momenta. Note, further, that unless the members of\r\na chemically-compound molecule are so bound up as to be incapable of any\r\nrelative movements (a supposition at variance with the conceptions of\r\nmodern science) we must conceive them as severally able to vibrate in\r\nunison or harmony with those same classes of ethereal waves that affect\r\nthem in their uncombined states. While the compound molecule as a whole\r\nwill have some new rate of oscillation determined by its attributes as a\r\nwhole; its components will retain their original rates of oscillation,\r\nsubject only to modifications by mutual influence. Such being the\r\ncircumstances of the case we may partially understand how the Sun's rays\r\ncan effect chemical decompositions. If the members of a diatomic molecule\r\nstand so related to the undulations falling on them, that one is thrown\r\ninto a state of increased oscillation and the other not; it is manifest\r\nthat there must arise a tendency towards the dislocation of the two--a\r\ntendency which may or may not take effect, according to the weakness or\r\nstrength of their union, and according to the presence or absence of\r\ncollateral affinities. This inference is in harmony with several\r\nsignificant facts. Dr. Draper remarks that \"among metallic substances\r\n(compounds) those first detected to be changed by light, such as silver,\r\ngold, mercury, lead, have all high atomic weights; and such as sodium and\r\npotassium, the atomic weights of which are low, appeared to be less\r\nchangeable.\" As here interpreted, the fact specified amounts to this; that\r\nthe compounds most readily decomposed by light, are those in which there is\r\na marked contrast between the atomic weights of the constituents, and\r\nprobably therefore a marked contrast between the rapidities of their\r\nvibrations. The circumstance, too, that different chemical compounds are\r\ndecomposed or modified in different parts of the spectrum, implies that\r\nthere is a relation between special orders of undulations and special\r\norders of molecules--doubtless a correspondence between the rates of these\r\nundulations and the rates of oscillation which some of the components of\r\nsuch molecules will assume. Strong confirmation of this view may be drawn\r\nfrom the decomposing actions of those longer ethereal waves which we\r\nperceive as heat. On contemplating the whole series of diatomic compounds,\r\nwe see that the elements which are most remote in their atomic weights, as\r\nhydrogen and the noble metals generally, will not combine at all, or do so\r\nwith great difficulty: their vibrations are so unlike that they cannot keep\r\ntogether under any conditions of temperature. If, again, we look at a\r\nsmaller group, as the metallic oxides, we see that whereas those metals\r\nwhich have atoms nearest in weight to the atoms of oxygen, cannot be\r\nseparated from oxygen by heat, even when it is joined by a powerful\r\ncollateral affinity; those metals which differ more widely from oxygen in\r\ntheir atomic weights, can be de-oxidized by carbon at high temperatures;\r\nand those which differ from it most widely combine with it very\r\nreluctantly, and yield it up if exposed to thermal undulations of moderate\r\nintensity. Here indeed, remembering the relations among the atomic weights\r\nin the two cases, may we not suspect a close analogy between the\r\nde-oxidation of a metallic oxide by carbon under the influence of the\r\nlonger ethereal waves, and the de-carbonization of carbonic acid by\r\nhydrogen under the influence of the shorter ethereal waves?\r\n\r\nThese conceptions help us to some dim notion of the mode in which changes\r\nare wrought in light in the leaves of plants. Among the several elements\r\nconcerned, there are wide differences in molecular mobility, and probably\r\nin the rates of molecular vibration. Each is combined with one of the\r\nothers, but is capable of forming various combinations with the rest. And\r\nthey are severally in presence of a complex compound into which they all\r\nenter, and which is ready to assimilate with itself the new compound\r\nmolecules they form. Certain of the ethereal waves falling on them when\r\nthus arranged, cause a detachment of some of the combined atoms and a union\r\nof the rest. And the conclusion suggested is that the induced vibrations\r\namong the various atoms as at first arranged, are so incongruous as to\r\nproduce instability, and to give collateral affinities the power to work a\r\nrearrangement which, though less stable under other conditions, is more\r\nstable in the presence of these particular undulations. There seems,\r\nindeed, no choice but to conceive the matter thus. An atom united with one\r\nfor which it has a strong affinity, has to be transferred to another for\r\nwhich it has a weaker affinity. This transfer implies motion. The motion is\r\ngiven by the waves of a medium that is relatively imponderable. No one wave\r\nof this imponderable medium can give the requisite motion to this atom of\r\nponderable matter: especially as the atom is held by a positive force\r\nbesides its inertia. The motion required can hence be given only by\r\nsuccessive waves; and that these may not destroy each other's effects, it\r\nis needful that each shall strike the atom just when it has completed the\r\nrecoil produced by the impact of previous ones. That is, the ethereal\r\nundulations must coincide in rate with the oscillations of the atom,\r\ndetermined by its inertia and the forces acting on it. It is also requisite\r\nthat the rate of oscillation of the atom to be detached, shall differ from\r\nthat of the atom with which it is united; since if the two oscillated in\r\nunison the ethereal waves would not tend to separate them. And, finally,\r\nthe successive impacts of the ethereal waves must be accumulated until the\r\nresulting oscillations have become so wide in their sweep as greatly to\r\nweaken the cohesion of the united atoms, at the same time that they bring\r\none of them within reach of other atoms with which it will combine. In this\r\nway only does it seem possible for such a force to produce such a transfer.\r\nMoreover, while we are thus enabled to conceive how light may work these\r\nmolecular changes, we also gain an insight into the method by which the\r\ninsensible motions propagated to us from the Sun, are treasured up in such\r\nways as afterwards to generate sensible motions. By the accumulation of\r\ninfinitesimal impacts, atoms of ponderable matter are made to oscillate.\r\nThe quantity of motion which each of them eventually acquires, effects its\r\ntransfer to a position of unstable equilibrium, from which it can\r\nafterwards be readily dislodged. And when so dislodged, along with other\r\natoms similarly and simultaneously affected, there is suddenly given out\r\nall the motion which had been before impressed on it.\r\n\r\nSpeculation aside, however, that which it concerns us to notice is the\r\nbroad fact that light is an all-important agent of molecular changes in\r\norganic substances. It is not here necessary for us to ascertain _how_\r\nlight produces these compositions and decompositions. It is necessary only\r\nfor us to observe that it _does_ produce them. That the characteristic\r\nmatter called chlorophyll, which gives the green colour to leaves, makes\r\nits appearance whenever the blanched shoots of plants are exposed to the\r\nSun; that the petals of flowers, uncoloured while in the bud, acquire their\r\nbright tints as they unfold; and that on the outer surfaces of animals,\r\nanalogous changes are induced; are wide inductions which are enough for our\r\npresent purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 14. We come next to the agency of chief importance among those that work\r\nchanges in organic matter; namely, chemical affinity. How readily vegetal\r\nand animal substances are modified by other substances put in contact with\r\nthem, we see daily illustrated. Besides the many compounds which cause the\r\ndeath of an organism into which they are put, we have the much greater\r\nnumber of compounds which work those milder effects termed\r\nmedicinal--effects implying, like the others, molecular re-arrangements.\r\nIndeed, most soluble chemical compounds, natural and artificial, produce,\r\nwhen taken into the body, alterations that are more or less manifest in\r\ntheir results.\r\n\r\nAfter what was shown in the last chapter, it will be manifest that this\r\nextreme modifiability of organic matter by chemical agencies, is the chief\r\ncause of that active molecular re-arrangement which organisms, and\r\nespecially animal organisms, display. In the two fundamental functions of\r\nnutrition and respiration, we have the means by which the supply of\r\nmaterials for this active molecular re-arrangement is maintained.\r\n\r\nThe process of animal nutrition consists partly in the absorption of those\r\ncomplex substances which are thus highly capable of being chemically\r\naltered, and partly in the absorption of simpler substances capable of\r\nchemically altering them. The tissues always contain small quantities of\r\nalkaline and earthy salts, which enter the system in one form and are\r\nexcreted in another. Though we do not know specifically the parts which\r\nthese salts play, yet from their universal presence, and from the\r\ntransformations which they undergo in the body, it may be safely inferred\r\nthat their chemical affinities are instrumental in working some of the\r\nmetamorphoses ever going on.\r\n\r\nThe inorganic substance, however, on which mainly depend these\r\nmetamorphoses in organic matter, is not swallowed along with the solid and\r\nliquid food, but is absorbed from the surrounding medium--air or water, as\r\nthe case may be. Whether the oxygen taken in, either, as by the lowest\r\nanimals, through the general surface, or, as by the higher animals, through\r\nrespiratory organs, is the immediate cause of those molecular changes which\r\nare ever going on throughout the living tissues; or whether the oxygen,\r\nplaying the part of scavenger, merely aids these changes by carrying away\r\nthe products of decompositions otherwise caused; it equally remains true\r\nthat these changes are maintained by its instrumentality. Whether the\r\noxygen absorbed and diffused through the system effects a direct oxidation\r\nof the organic colloids which it permeates, or whether it first leads to\r\nthe formation of simpler and more oxidized compounds, which are afterwards\r\nfurther oxidized and reduced to still simpler forms, matters not, in so far\r\nas the general result is concerned. In any case it holds good that the\r\nsubstances of which the animal body is built up, enter it in either an\r\nunoxidized or in a but slightly oxidized and highly unstable state; while\r\nthe great mass of them leave it in a fully oxidized and stable state. It\r\nfollows, therefore, that, whatever the special changes gone through, the\r\ngeneral process is a falling from a state of unstable chemical equilibrium\r\nto a state of stable chemical equilibrium. Whether this process be direct\r\nor indirect, the total molecular re-arrangement and the total motion given\r\nout in effecting it, must be the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 15. There is another species of re-distribution among the component\r\nmatters of organisms, which is not immediately effected by the affinities\r\nof the matters concerned, but is mediately effected by other affinities;\r\nand there is reason to think that the re-distribution thus caused is\r\nimportant in amount, if not indeed the most important. In ordinary cases of\r\nchemical action, the two or more substances concerned themselves undergo\r\nchanges of molecular arrangement; and the changes are confined to the\r\nsubstances themselves. But there are other cases in which the chemical\r\naction going on does not end with the substances at first concerned, but\r\nsets up chemical actions, or changes of molecular arrangement, among\r\nsurrounding substances that would else have remained quiescent. And there\r\nare yet further cases in which mere contact with a substance that is itself\r\nquiescent, will cause other substances to undergo rapid metamorphoses. In\r\nwhat we call fermentation, the first species of this communicated chemical\r\naction is exemplified. One part of yeast, while itself undergoing molecular\r\nchange, will convert 100 parts of sugar into alcohol and carbonic acid; and\r\nduring its own decomposition, one part of diastase \"is able to effect the\r\ntransformation of more than 1000 times its weight of starch into sugar.\" As\r\nillustrations of the second species, may be mentioned those changes which\r\nare suddenly produced in many colloids by minute portions of various\r\nsubstances added to them--substances that are not undergoing manifest\r\ntransformations, and suffer no appreciable effects from the contact. The\r\nnature of the first of these two kinds of communicated molecular change,\r\nwhich here chiefly concerns us, may be rudely represented by certain\r\nvisible changes communicated from mass to mass, when a series of masses has\r\nbeen arranged in a special way. The simplest example is that furnished by\r\nthe child's play of setting bricks on end in a row, in such positions that\r\nwhen the first is overthrown it overthrows the second, the second the\r\nthird, the third the fourth, and so on to the end of the row. Here we have\r\na number of units severally placed in unstable equilibrium, and in such\r\nrelative positions that each, while falling into a state of stable\r\nequilibrium, gives an impulse to the next sufficient to make the next,\r\nalso, fall from unstable to stable equilibrium. Now since, among mingled\r\ncompound molecules, no one can undergo change in the arrangement of its\r\nparts without a molecular motion that must cause some disturbance all\r\nround; and since an adjacent molecule disturbed by this communicated\r\nmotion, may have the arrangement of its constituent atoms altered, if it is\r\nnot a stable arrangement; and since we know, both that the molecules which\r\nare changed by this so-called catalysis _are_ unstable, and that the\r\nmolecules resulting from their changes are _more_ stable; it seems probable\r\nthat the transformation is really analogous, in principle, to the familiar\r\none named. Whether thus interpretable or not, however, there is good reason\r\nfor thinking that to this kind of action is due a large amount of vital\r\nmetamorphosis. Let us contemplate the several groups of facts which point\r\nto this conclusion.[9]\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter (§ 2) we incidentally noted the extreme instability of\r\nnitrogenous compounds in general. We saw that sundry of them are liable to\r\nexplode on the slightest incentive--sometimes without any apparent cause;\r\nand that of the rest, the great majority are very easily decomposed by\r\nheat, and by various substances. We shall perceive much significance in\r\nthis general characteristic when we join it with the fact that the\r\nsubstances capable of setting up extensive molecular changes in the way\r\nabove described are all nitrogenous ones. Yeast consists of vegetal cells\r\ncontaining nitrogen,--cells that grow by assimilating the nitrogenous\r\nmatter contained in wort. Similarly, the \"vinegar-plant,\" which greatly\r\nfacilitates the formation of acetic acid from alcohol, is a fungoid growth\r\nthat is doubtless, like others of its class, rich in nitrogenous compounds.\r\nDiastase, by which the transformation of starch into sugar is effected\r\nduring the process of malting, is also a nitrogenous body. So too is a\r\nsubstance called synaptase--an albumenous principle contained in almonds,\r\nwhich has the power of working several metamorphoses in the matters\r\nassociated with it. These nitrogenized compounds, like the rest of their\r\nfamily, are remarkable for the rapidity with which they decompose; and the\r\nextensive changes produced by them in the accompanying carbo-hydrates, are\r\nfound to vary in their kinds according as the decompositions of the\r\nferments vary in their stages. We have next to note, as having here a\r\nmeaning for us, the chemical contrasts between those organisms which carry\r\non their functions by the help of external forces, and those which carry on\r\ntheir functions by forces evolved from within. If we compare animals and\r\nplants, we see that whereas plants, characterized as a class by containing\r\nbut little nitrogen, are dependent on the solar rays for their vital\r\nactivities; animals, the vital activities of which are not thus dependent,\r\nmainly consist of nitrogenous substances. There is one marked exception to\r\nthis broad distinction, however; and this exception is specially\r\ninstructive. Among plants there is a considerable group--the Fungi--many\r\nmembers of which, if not all, can live and grow in the dark; and it is\r\ntheir peculiarity that they are very much more nitrogenous than other\r\nplants. Yet a third class of facts of like significance is disclosed when\r\nwe compare different portions of the same organism. The seed of a plant\r\ncontains nitrogenous substance in a far higher ratio than the rest of the\r\nplant; and the seed differs from the rest of the plant in its ability to\r\ninitiate, in the absence of light, extensive vital changes--the changes\r\nconstituting germination. Similarly in the bodies of animals, those parts\r\nwhich carry on active functions are nitrogenous; while parts that are\r\nnon-nitrogenous--as the deposits of fat--carry on no active functions. And\r\nwe even find that the appearance of non-nitrogenous matter throughout\r\ntissues normally composed almost wholly of nitrogenous matter, is\r\naccompanied by loss of activity: what is called fatty degeneration being\r\nthe concomitant of failing vitality.  One more fact, which serves to make\r\nstill clearer the meaning of the foregoing ones, remains--the fact, namely,\r\nthat in no part of any organism where vital changes are going on, is\r\nnitrogenous matter wholly absent. It is common to speak of plants--or at\r\nleast all parts of plants but the seeds--as non-nitrogenous. But they are\r\nonly relatively so; not absolutely. The quantity of albumenoid substance in\r\nthe tissues of plants, is extremely small compared with the quantity\r\ncontained in the tissues of animals; but all plant-tissues which are\r\ndischarging active functions have some albumenoid substance. In every\r\nliving vegetal cell there is a certain part that includes nitrogen as a\r\ncomponent. This part initiates those changes which constitute the\r\ndevelopment of the cell. And if it cannot be said that it is the worker of\r\nall subsequent changes undergone by the cell, it nevertheless continues to\r\nbe the part in which the independent activity is most marked.\r\n\r\nLooking at the evidence thus brought together, do we not get an insight\r\ninto the actions of nitrogenous matter as a worker of organic changes? We\r\nsee that nitrogenous compounds in general are extremely prone to decompose:\r\ntheir decomposition often involving a sudden and great evolution of energy.\r\nWe see that the substances classed as ferments, which, during their own\r\nmolecular changes, set up molecular changes in the accompanying\r\ncarbo-hydrates, are all nitrogenous. We see that among classes of\r\norganisms, and among the parts of each organism, there is a relation\r\nbetween the amount of nitrogenous matter present and the amount of\r\nindependent activity. And we see that even in organisms and parts of\r\norganisms where the activity is least, such changes as do take place are\r\ninitiated by a substance containing nitrogen. Does it not seem probable,\r\nthen, that these extremely unstable compounds have everywhere the effect of\r\ncommunicating to the less unstable compounds associated with them,\r\nmolecular movements towards a stable state, like those they are themselves\r\nundergoing? The changes which we thus suppose nitrogenous matter to produce\r\nin the body, are clearly analogous to those which we see it produce out of\r\nthe body. Out of the body, certain carbo-hydrates in continued contact with\r\nnitrogenous matter, are transformed into carbonic acid and alcohol, and\r\nunless prevented the alcohol is transformed into acetic acid: the\r\nsubstances formed being thus more highly oxidized and more stable than the\r\nsubstances destroyed. In the body, these same carbo-hydrates, in continued\r\ncontact with nitrogenous matter, are transformed into carbonic acid and\r\nwater: substances which are also more highly oxidized and more stable than\r\nthose from which they result. And since acetic acid is itself resolved by\r\nfurther oxidation into carbonic acid and water; we see that the chief\r\ndifference between the two cases is, that the process is more completely\r\neffected in the body than it is out of the body. Thus, to carry further the\r\nsimile used above, the molecules of carbo-hydrates contained in the tissues\r\nare, like bricks on end, not in the stablest equilibrium; but still in an\r\nequilibrium so stable, that they cannot be overthrown by the chemical and\r\nthermal forces which the body brings to bear on them. On the other hand,\r\nbeing like similarly-placed bricks that have very narrow ends, the\r\nnitrogenous molecules contained in the tissues are in so unstable an\r\nequilibrium that they cannot withstand these forces. And when these\r\ndelicately-poised nitrogenous molecules fall into stable arrangements, they\r\ngive impulses to the more firmly-poised non-nitrogenous molecules, which\r\ncause them also to fall into stable arrangements. It is a curious and\r\nsignificant fact that in the arts, we not only utilize this same principle\r\nof initiating extensive changes among comparatively stable compounds, by\r\nthe help of compounds much less stable, but we employ for the purpose\r\ncompounds of the same general class. Our modern method of firing a gun is\r\nto place in close proximity with the gunpowder which we wish to decompose\r\nor explode, a small portion of fulminating powder, which is decomposed or\r\nexploded with extreme facility, and which, on decomposing, communicates the\r\nconsequent molecular disturbance to the less-easily decomposed gunpowder.\r\nWhen we ask what this fulminating powder is composed of, we find that it is\r\na nitrogenous salt.[10]\r\n\r\nThus, besides the molecular re-arrangements produced in organic matter by\r\ndirect chemical action, there are others of kindred importance produced by\r\nindirect chemical action. Indeed, the inference that some of the leading\r\ntransformations occurring in the animal organism, are due to this so-called\r\ncatalysis, appears necessitated by the general aspect of the facts, apart\r\nfrom any such detailed interpretations as the foregoing. We know that\r\nvarious amylaceous and saccharine matters taken as food do not appear in\r\nthe excreta, and must therefore be decomposed in their course through the\r\nbody. We know that these matters do not become components of the tissues,\r\nbut only of the contained liquids and solids; and that thus their\r\nmetamorphosis is not a direct result of tissue-change. We know that their\r\nstability is such that the thermal and chemical forces to which they are\r\nexposed in the body, cannot alone decompose them. The only explanation open\r\nto us, therefore, is that the transformation of these carbo-hydrates into\r\ncarbonic acid and water, is due to communicated chemical action.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 16. This chapter will have served its purpose if it has given a\r\nconception of the extreme modifiability of organic matter by surrounding\r\nagencies. Even were it possible, it would be needless to describe in detail\r\nthe immensely varied and complicated changes which the forces from moment\r\nto moment acting on them, work in living bodies. Dealing with biology in\r\nits general principles, it concerns us only to notice how specially\r\nsensitive are the substances of which organisms are built up to the varied\r\ninfluences that act upon organisms. Their special sensitiveness has been\r\nmade sufficiently manifest in the several foregoing sections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE RE-ACTIONS OF ORGANIC MATTER ON FORCES.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 17. Re-distributions of Matter imply concomitant re-distributions of\r\nMotion. That which under one of its aspects we contemplate as an alteration\r\nof arrangement among the parts of a body, is, under a correlative aspect,\r\nan alteration of arrangement among certain momenta, whereby these parts are\r\nimpelled to their new positions. At the same time that a force, acting\r\ndifferently on the different units of an aggregate, changes their relations\r\nto one another; these units, reacting differently on the different parts of\r\nthe force, work equivalent changes in the relations of these to one\r\nanother. Inseparably connected as they are, these two orders of phenomena\r\nare liable to be confounded together. It is very needful, however, to\r\ndistinguish between them. In the last chapter we took a rapid survey of the\r\nre-distributions which forces produce in organic matter; and here we must\r\ntake a like survey of the simultaneous re-distributions undergone by the\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nAt the outset we are met by a difficulty. The parts of an inorganic mass\r\nundergoing re-arrangement by an incident force, are in most cases\r\npassive--do not complicate those necessary re-actions that result from\r\ntheir inertia, by other forces which they themselves originate. But in\r\norganic matter the re-arranged parts do not re-act in virtue of their\r\ninertia only. They are so constituted that an incident force usually sets\r\nup in them other actions which are much more important. Indeed, what we may\r\ncall the indirect reactions thus caused, are so great in their amounts\r\ncompared with the direct re-actions, that they quite obscure them.\r\n\r\nThe impossibility of separating these two kinds of reaction compels us to\r\ndisregard the distinction between them. Under the above general title, we\r\nmust include both the immediate re-actions and those re-actions mediately\r\nproduced, which are among the most conspicuous of vital phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 18. From organic matter, as from all other matter, incident forces call\r\nforth that re-action which we know as heat. More or less of molecular\r\nvibration necessarily results when, to the forces at work among the\r\nmolecules of any aggregate, other forces are added. Experiment abundantly\r\ndemonstrates this in the case of inorganic masses; and it must equally hold\r\nin the case of organic masses.  In both cases the force which, more\r\nmarkedly than any other, produces this thermal re-action, is that which\r\nends in the union of different substances. Though inanimate bodies admit of\r\nbeing greatly heated by pressure and by the electric current, yet the\r\nevolutions of heat, thus induced are neither so common, nor in most cases\r\nso conspicuous, as those resulting from chemical combination. And though in\r\nanimate bodies there are certain amounts of heat generated by other\r\nactions, yet these are secondary to the heat generated by the action of\r\noxygen on the substances composing the tissues and the substances contained\r\nin them.  Here, however, we see one of the characteristic distinctions\r\nbetween inanimate and animate bodies. Among the first there are but few\r\nwhich ordinarily exist in a condition to evolve the heat caused by chemical\r\ncombination; and such as are in this condition soon cease to be so when\r\nchemical combination and genesis of heat once begin in them. Whereas, among\r\nthe second there universally exists the ability, more or less decided, thus\r\nto evolve heat; and the evolution of heat, in some cases very slight and in\r\nno cases very great, continues as long as they remain animate bodies.\r\n\r\nThe relation between active change of matter and re-active genesis of\r\nmolecular vibration, is clearly shown by the contrasts between different\r\norganisms, and between different states and parts of the same organism. In\r\nplants the genesis of heat is extremely small, in correspondence with their\r\nextremely small production of carbonic acid: those portions only, as\r\nflowers and germinating seeds, in which considerable oxidation is going on,\r\nhaving decidedly raised temperatures. Among animals we see that the\r\nhot-blooded are those which expend much force and respire actively. Though\r\ninsects are scarcely at all warmer than the surrounding air when they are\r\nstill, they rise several degrees above it when they exert themselves; and\r\nin mammals, which habitually maintain a temperature much higher than that\r\nof their medium, exertion is accompanied by an additional production of\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nThis molecular agitation accompanies the falls from unstable to stable\r\nmolecular combinations; whether they be those from the most complex to the\r\nless complex compounds, or whether they be those ultimate falls which end\r\nin fully oxidized and relatively simple compounds; and whether they be\r\nthose of the nitrogenous matters composing the tissues or those of the\r\nnon-nitrogenous matters diffused through them. In the one case as in the\r\nother, the heat must be regarded as a concomitant.  Whether the\r\ndistinction, originally made by Liebig, between nitrogenous substances as\r\ntissue-food and non-nitrogenous substances as heat-food, be true or not in\r\na narrower sense, it cannot be accepted in the sense that tissue-food is\r\nnot also heat-food. Indeed he does not himself assert it in this sense. The\r\nability of carnivorous animals to live and generate heat while consuming\r\nmatter that is almost exclusively nitrogenous, suffices to prove that the\r\nnitrogenous compounds forming the tissues are heat-producers, as well as\r\nthe non-nitrogenous compounds circulating among and through the tissues: a\r\nconclusion which is indeed justified by the fact that nitrogenous\r\nsubstances out of the body yield heat, though not a large amount, during\r\ncombustion. But most likely this antithesis is not true even in the more\r\nrestricted sense. The probability is that the hydrocarbons and\r\ncarbo-hydrates which, in traversing the system, are transformed by\r\ncommunicated chemical action, evolve, during their transformation, not heat\r\nalone but also other kinds of force. It may be that as the nitrogenous\r\nmatter, while falling into more stable molecular arrangements, generates\r\nboth that molecular agitation called heat and such other molecular\r\nmovements as are resolved into forces expended by the organism; so, too,\r\ndoes the non-nitrogenous matter. Or perhaps the concomitants of this\r\nmetamorphosis of non-nitrogenous matter vary with the conditions. Heat\r\nalone may result when it is transformed while in the circulating fluids,\r\nbut partly heat and partly another force when it is transformed in some\r\nactive tissue that has absorbed it; just as coal, though producing little\r\nelse but heat as ordinarily burnt, has its heat partially transformed into\r\nmechanical motion if burnt in a steam-engine furnace. In such case the\r\nantithesis of Liebig would be reduced to this--that whereas nitrogenous\r\nsubstance is tissue-food _both_ as material for building-up tissue and as\r\nmaterial for its function; non-nitrogenous substance is tissue-food _only_\r\nas material for function.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that this thermal re-action which chemical action\r\nfrom moment to moment produces in the body, is from moment to moment an aid\r\nto further chemical action. We before saw (_First Principles_, § 100) that\r\na state of raised molecular vibration is favourable to those\r\nre-distributions of matter and motion which constitute Evolution. We saw\r\nthat in organisms distinguished by the amount and rapidity of such\r\nre-distributions, this raised state of molecular vibration is conspicuous.\r\nAnd we here see that this raised state of molecular vibration is itself a\r\ncontinuous consequence of the continuous molecular re-distributions it\r\nfacilitates. The heat generated by each increment of chemical change makes\r\npossible the succeeding increment of chemical change. In the body this\r\nconnexion of phenomena is the same as we see it to be out of the body. Just\r\nas in a burning piece of wood, the heat given out by the portion actually\r\ncombining with oxygen, raises the adjacent portion to a temperature at\r\nwhich it also can combine with oxygen; so, in a living animal, the heat\r\nproduced by oxidation of each portion of organized or unorganized\r\nsubstance, maintains the temperature at which the unoxidized portions can\r\nbe readily oxidized.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 19. Among the forces called forth from organisms by re-action against the\r\nactions to which they are subject, is Light. Phosphorescence is in some few\r\ncases displayed by plants--especially by certain fungi. Among animals it is\r\ncomparatively common. All know that there are several kinds of luminous\r\ninsects; and many are familiar with the fact that luminosity is a\r\ncharacteristic of various marine creatures.\r\n\r\nMuch of the evidence is supposed to imply that this evolution of light,\r\nlike the evolution of heat, is consequent on oxidation of the tissues or of\r\nmatters contained in them. Light, like heat, is the expression of a raised\r\nstate of molecular vibration: the difference between them being a\r\ndifference in the rates of vibration. Hence it seems inferable that by\r\nchemical action on substances contained in the organism, heat or light may\r\nbe produced, according to the character of the resulting molecular\r\nvibrations. Some experimental evidence supports this view. In\r\nphosphorescent insects, the continuance of the light is found to depend on\r\nthe continuance of respiration; and any exertion which renders respiration\r\nmore active, increases the brilliancy of the light. Moreover, by separating\r\nthe luminous matter, Prof. Matteucci has shown that its emission of light\r\nis accompanied by absorption of oxygen and escape of carbonic acid. The\r\nphosphorescence of marine animals has been referred to other causes than\r\noxidation; but it may perhaps be explicable without assuming any more\r\nspecial agency. Considering that in creatures of the genus _Noctiluca_, for\r\nexample, to which the phosphorescence most commonly seen on our own coasts\r\nis due, there is no means of keeping up a constant circulation, we may\r\ninfer that the movements of aerated fluids through their tissues, must be\r\ngreatly affected by impulses received from without. Hence it may be that\r\nthe sparkles visible at night when the waves break gently on the beach, or\r\nwhen an oar is dipped into the water, are called forth from these creatures\r\nby the concussion, not because of any unknown influence it excites, but\r\nbecause, being propagated through their delicate tissues, it produces a\r\nsudden movement of the fluids and a sudden increase of chemical action.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in other phosphorescent animals inhabiting the sea, as in the\r\n_Pyrosoma_ and in certain _Annelida_, light seems to be produced otherwise\r\nthan by direct re-action on the action of oxygen. Indeed, it needs but to\r\nrecall the now familiar fact that certain substances become luminous in the\r\ndark after exposure to sunlight, to see that there are other causes of\r\nlight-emission.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 20. The re-distributions of inanimate matter are habitually accompanied\r\nby electrical disturbances; and there is abundant evidence that electricity\r\nis generated during those re-distributions of matter that are ever taking\r\nplace in organisms. Experiments have shown \"that the skin and most of the\r\ninternal membranes are in opposite electrical states;\" and also that\r\nbetween different internal organs, as the liver and the stomach, there are\r\nelectrical contrasts: such contrasts being greatest where the processes\r\ngoing on in the compared parts are most unlike. It has been proved by du\r\nBois-Reymond that when any point in the longitudinal section of a muscle is\r\nconnected by a conductor with any point in its transverse section, an\r\nelectric current is established; and further, that like results occur when\r\nnerves are substituted for muscles. The special causes of these phenomena\r\nhave not yet been determined. Considering that the electric contrasts are\r\nmost marked where active secretions are going on--considering, too, that\r\nthey are difficult to detect where there are no appreciable movements of\r\nliquids--considering, also, that even when muscles are made to contract\r\nafter removal from the body, the contraction inevitably causes movements of\r\nthe liquids still contained in its tissues; it may be that they are due\r\nsimply to the friction of heterogeneous substances, which is universally a\r\ncause of electric disturbance. But whatever be the interpretation, the fact\r\nremains the same:--there is throughout the living organism, an unceasing\r\nproduction of differences between the electric states of different parts;\r\nand, consequently, an unceasing restoration of electric equilibrium by the\r\nestablishment of currents among these parts.\r\n\r\nBesides these general, and not conspicuous, electrical phenomena common to\r\nall organisms, vegetal as well as animal, there are certain special and\r\nstrongly marked ones. I refer, of course, to those which have made the\r\n_Torpedo_ and the _Gymnotus_ objects of so much interest. In these\r\ncreatures we have a genesis of electricity which is not incidental on the\r\nperformance of their different functions by the different organs; but one\r\nwhich is itself a function, having an organ appropriate to it. The\r\ncharacter of this organ in both these fishes, and its largely-developed\r\nconnexions with the nervous centres, have raised in some minds the\r\nsuspicion that in it there takes place a transformation of what we call\r\nnerve-force into the force known as electricity. Perhaps, however, the true\r\ninterpretation may rather be that by nervous stimulation there is set up in\r\nthese animal-batteries that particular transformation of molecular motion\r\nwhich it is their function to produce.\r\n\r\nBut whether general or special, and in whatever manner produced, these\r\nevolutions of electricity are among the reactions of organic matter called\r\nforth by the actions to which it is subject. Though these re-actions are\r\nnot direct, but seem to be remote consequences of changes wrought by\r\nexternal agencies on the organism, they are yet incidents in that general\r\nre-distribution of motion which these external agencies initiate; and as\r\nsuch must here be noticed.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 21. To these known modes of motion, has next to be added an unknown one.\r\nHeat, Light, and Electricity are emitted by inorganic matter when\r\nundergoing changes, as well as by organic matter. But there is manifested\r\nin some classes of living bodies a kind of force which we cannot identify\r\nwith any of the forces manifested by bodies that are not alive,--a force\r\nwhich is thus unknown, in the sense that it cannot be assimilated to any\r\notherwise-recognized class. I allude to what is called nerve-force.\r\n\r\nThis is habitually generated in all animals, save the lowest, by incident\r\nforces of every kind. The gentle and violent mechanical contacts, which in\r\nourselves produce sensations of touch and pressure--the additions and\r\nabstractions of molecular vibration, which in ourselves produce sensations\r\nof heat and cold, produce in all creatures that have nervous systems,\r\ncertain nervous disturbances: disturbances which, as in ourselves, are\r\neither communicated to the chief nervous centre, and there arouse\r\nconsciousness, or else result in mere physical processes set going\r\nelsewhere in the organism. In special parts distinguished as organs of\r\nsense, other external actions bring about other nervous re-actions, that\r\nshow themselves either as special sensations or as excitements which,\r\nwithout the intermediation of distinct consciousness, beget actions in\r\nmuscles or other organs.  Besides neural discharges following the direct\r\nincidence of external forces, others are ever being caused by the incidence\r\nof forces which, though originally external, have become internal by\r\nabsorption into the organism of the agents exerting them. For thus may be\r\nclassed those neural discharges which result from modifications of the\r\ntissues wrought by substances carried to them in the blood. That the\r\nunceasing change of matter which oxygen and other agents produce throughout\r\nthe system, is accompanied by production of nerve-force, is shown by\r\nvarious facts;--by the fact that nerve-force is no longer generated if\r\noxygen be withheld or the blood prevented from circulating; by the fact\r\nthat when the chemical transformation is diminished, as during sleep with\r\nits slow respiration and circulation, there is a diminution in the quantity\r\nof nerve-force; by the fact that an excessive expenditure of nerve-force\r\ninvolves excessive respiration and circulation, and excessive waste of\r\ntissue. To these proofs that nerve-force is evolved in greater or less\r\nquantity, according as the conditions to rapid molecular change throughout\r\nthe body are well or ill fulfilled, may be added proofs that certain\r\nspecial molecular actions are the causes of these special re-actions. The\r\neffects of the vegeto-alkalies put beyond doubt the inference that the\r\noverthrow of molecular equilibrium by chemical affinity, when it occurs in\r\ncertain parts, causes excitement in the nerves proceeding from those parts.\r\nIndeed, looked at from this point of view, the two classes of nervous\r\nchanges--the one initiated from without and the other from within--are seen\r\nto merge into one class. Both of them may be traced to metamorphosis of\r\ntissue. The sensations of touch and pressure are doubtless consequent on\r\naccelerated changes of matter, produced by mechanical disturbance of the\r\nmingled fluids and solids composing the parts affected. There is abundant\r\nevidence that the gustatory sensation is due to the chemical actions set up\r\nby particles which find their way through the membrane covering the nerves\r\nof taste; for, as Prof. Graham points out, sapid substances belong to the\r\nclass of crystalloids, which are able rapidly to permeate animal tissue,\r\nwhile the colloids which cannot pass through animal tissue are insipid.\r\nSimilarly with the sense of smell. Substances which excite this sense are\r\nnecessarily more or less volatile; and their volatility being the result of\r\ntheir molecular mobility, implies that they have, in a high degree, the\r\npower of getting at the olfactory nerves by penetrating their mucous\r\ninvestment. Again, the facts which photography has familiarized us with,\r\nshow that those nervous impressions called colours, are primarily due to\r\ncertain changes wrought by light in the substance of the retina. And\r\nthough, in the case of hearing, we cannot so clearly trace the connexion of\r\ncause and effect, yet as we see that the auditory apparatus is one fitted\r\nto intensify those vibrations constituting sound, and to convey them to a\r\nreceptacle containing liquid in which nerves are immersed, it can scarcely\r\nbe doubted that the sensation of sound proximately results from molecular\r\nre-arrangements caused in these nerves by the vibrations of the liquid:\r\nknowing, as we do, that the re-arrangement of molecules is in all cases\r\naided by agitation. Perhaps, however, the best proof that nerve-force,\r\nwhether peripheral or central in origin, results from chemical change, lies\r\nin the fact that most of the chemical agents which powerfully affect the\r\nnervous system, affect it whether applied at the centre or at the\r\nperiphery. Various mineral acids are tonics--the stronger ones being\r\nusually the stronger tonics; and this which we call their acidity implies a\r\npower in them of acting on the nerves of taste, while the tingling or pain\r\nfollowing their absorption through the skin, implies that the nerves of the\r\nskin are acted on by them. Similarly with certain vegeto-alkalies which are\r\npeculiarly bitter. By their bitterness these show that they affect the\r\nextremities of the nerves, while, by their tonic properties, they show that\r\nthey affect the nervous centres: the most intensely bitter among them,\r\nstrychnia, being the most powerful nervous stimulant.[11] However true it\r\nmay be that this relation is not a regular one, since opium, hashish, and\r\nsome other drugs, which work marked effects on the brain, are not\r\nremarkably sapid--however true it may be that there are relations between\r\nparticular substances and particular parts of the nervous system; yet such\r\ninstances do but qualify, without negativing, the general proposition. The\r\ntruth of this proposition can scarcely be doubted when, to the facts above\r\ngiven, is added the fact that various condiments and aromatic drugs act as\r\nnervous stimulants; and the fact that anæsthetics, besides the general\r\neffects they produce when inhaled or swallowed, produce local effects of\r\nlike kind--first stimulant and then sedative--when absorbed through the\r\nskin; and the fact that ammonia, which in consequence of its extreme\r\nmolecular mobility so quickly and so violently excites the nerves beneath\r\nthe skin, as well as those of the tongue and the nose, is a rapidly-acting\r\nstimulant when taken internally.\r\n\r\nWhether a nerve is merely a conductor, which delivers at one of its\r\nextremities an impulse received at the other, or whether, as some now\r\nthink, it is itself a generator of force which is initiated at one\r\nextremity and accumulates in its course to the other extremity, are\r\nquestions which cannot yet be answered. All we know is that agencies\r\ncapable of working molecular changes in nerves are capable of calling forth\r\nfrom them manifestations of activity. And our evidence that nerve-force is\r\nthus originated, consists not only of such facts as the above, but also of\r\nmore conclusive facts established by direct experiments on\r\nnerves--experiments which show that nerve-force results when the cut end of\r\na nerve is either mechanically irritated, or acted on by some chemical\r\nagent, or subject to the galvanic current--experiments which prove that\r\nnerve-force is generated by whatever disturbs the molecular equilibrium of\r\nnerve-substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 22. The most important of the re-actions called forth from organisms by\r\nsurrounding actions, remains to be noticed. To the various forms of\r\ninsensible motion thus caused, we have to add sensible motion. On the\r\nproduction of this mode of force more especially depends the possibility of\r\nall vital phenomena. It is, indeed, usual to regard the power of generating\r\nsensible motion as confined to one out of the two organic sub-kingdoms; or,\r\nat any rate, as possessed by but few members of the other. On looking\r\ncloser into the matter, however, we see that plant-life as well as\r\nanimal-life, is universally accompanied by certain manifestations of this\r\npower; and that plant-life could not otherwise continue.\r\n\r\nThrough the humblest, as well as through the highest, vegetal organisms,\r\nthere are ever going on certain re-distributions of matter. In Protophytes\r\nthe microscope shows us an internal transposition of parts, which, when not\r\nimmediately visible, is proved to exist by the changes of arrangement that\r\nbecome manifest in the course of hours and days. In the individual cells of\r\nmany higher plants, an active movement among the contained granules may be\r\nwitnessed. And well-developed cryptogams, in common with all phanerogams,\r\nexhibit this genesis of mechanical motion still more conspicuously in the\r\ncirculation of sap. It might, indeed, be concluded _a priori_, that through\r\nplants displaying much differentiation of parts, an internal movement must\r\nbe going on; since, without it, the mutual dependence of organs having\r\nunlike functions would be impossible. Besides keeping up these motions of\r\nliquids internally, plants, especially of the lower orders, move their\r\nexternal parts in relation to each other, and also move about from place to\r\nplace. There are countless such illustrations as the active locomotion of\r\nthe zoospores of many _Algæ_, the rhythmical bendings of the _Oscillatoræ_,\r\nthe rambling progression of the _Diatomaceæ_. In fact many of these\r\nsmallest vegetals, and many of the larger ones in their early stages,\r\ndisplay a mechanical activity not distinguishable from that of the simplest\r\nanimals. Among well-organized plants, which are never locomotive in their\r\nadult states, we still not unfrequently meet with relative motions of\r\nparts. To such familiar cases as those of the Sensitive plant and the\r\nVenus' fly-trap, many others may be added. When its base is irritated the\r\nstamen of the Berberry flower leans over and touches the pistil. If the\r\nstamens of the wild _Cistus_ be gently brushed with the finger, they spread\r\nthemselves: bending away from the seed-vessel. And some of the\r\norchid-flowers, as Mr. Darwin has shown, shoot out masses of pollen on to\r\nthe entering bee, when its trunk is thrust down in search of honey.\r\n\r\nThough the power of moving is not, as we see, a characteristic of animals\r\nalone, yet in them, considered as a class, it is manifested to an extent so\r\nmarked as practically to become their most distinctive trait. For it is by\r\ntheir immensely greater ability to generate mechanical motion, that animals\r\nare enabled to perform those actions which constitute their visible lives;\r\nand it is by their immensely greater ability to generate mechanical motion,\r\nthat the higher orders of animals are most obviously distinguished from the\r\nlower orders. Though, on remembering the seemingly active movements of\r\ninfusoria, some will perhaps question this last-named contrast, yet, on\r\ncomparing the quantities of matter propelled through given spaces in given\r\ntimes, they will see that the momentum evolved is far less in the\r\n_Protozoa_ than in the _Metazoa_. These sensible motions of animals are\r\neffected in sundry ways. In the humblest forms, and even in some of the\r\nmore developed forms which inhabit the water, locomotion results from the\r\noscillations of whip-like appendages, single or double, or from the\r\noscillations of cilia: the contractility resides in these waving hairs that\r\ngrow from the surface. In many _Coelenterata_ certain elongations or tails\r\nof ectodermal or endodermal cells shorten when stimulated, and by these\r\nrudimentary contractile organs the movements are effected. In all the\r\nhigher animals, however, and to a smaller degree in many of the lower,\r\nsensible motion is generated by a special tissue, under a special\r\nexcitement. Though it is not strictly true that such animals show no\r\nsensible motions otherwise caused, since all of them have certain ciliated\r\nmembranes, and since the circulation of liquids in them is partially due to\r\nosmotic and capillary actions; yet, generally speaking, we may say that\r\ntheir movements are effected solely by muscles which contract solely\r\nthrough the agency of nerves.\r\n\r\nWhat special transformations of force generate these various mechanical\r\nchanges, we do not, in most cases, know. Those re-distributions of liquid,\r\nwith the alterations of form sometimes caused by them, that result from\r\nosmose, are not, indeed, incomprehensible. Certain motions of plants which,\r\nlike those of the \"animated oat,\" follow contact with water, are easily\r\ninterpreted; as are also such other vegetal motions as those of the\r\nTouch-me-not, the Squirting Cucumber, and the _Carpobolus_. But we are\r\nignorant of the mode in which molecular movement is transformed into the\r\nmovement of masses, in animals. We cannot refer to known causes the\r\nrhythmical action of a Medusa's disc, or that slow decrease of bulk which\r\nspreads throughout the mass of an _Alcyonium_ when one of its component\r\nindividuals has been irritated. Nor are we any better able to say how the\r\ninsensible motion transmitted through a nerve, gives rise to sensitive\r\nmotion in a muscle. It is true that Science has given to Art several\r\nmethods of changing insensible into sensible motion. By applying heat to\r\nwater we vaporize it, and the movement of its expanding vapour we transfer\r\nto solid matter; but evidently the genesis of muscular movement is in no\r\nway analogous to this. The force evolved in a galvanic battery or by a\r\ndynamo, we communicate to a soft iron magnet through a wire coiled round\r\nit; and it would be possible, by placing near to each other several magnets\r\nthus excited, to obtain, through the attraction of each for its neighbours,\r\nan accumulated movement made up of their separate movements, and thus\r\nmechanically to imitate a muscular contraction. But from what we know of\r\norganic matter there is no reason to suppose that anything analogous to\r\nthis takes place in it.  We can, however, through one kind of molecular\r\nchange, produce sensible changes of aggregation such as possibly might,\r\nwhen occurring in organic substance, cause sensible motion in it. I refer\r\nto change that is allotropic or isomeric. Sulphur, for example, assumes\r\ndifferent crystalline and non-crystalline forms at different temperatures,\r\nand may be made to pass backwards and forwards from one form to another, by\r\nslight variations of temperature: undergoing each time an alteration of\r\nbulk. We know that this allotropism, or rather its analogue isomerism,\r\nprevails among colloids--inorganic and organic. We also know that some of\r\nthese metamorphoses among colloids are accompanied by visible\r\nre-arrangements: instance hydrated silicic acid, which, after passing from\r\nits soluble state to the state of an insoluble jelly, begins, in a few\r\ndays, to contract and to give out part of its contained water. Now\r\nconsidering that such isomeric changes of organic as well as inorganic\r\ncolloids, are often rapidly produced by very slight causes--a trace of a\r\nneutral salt or a degree or two rise of temperature--it seems not\r\nimpossible that some of the colloids constituting muscle may be thus\r\nchanged by a nervous discharge: resuming their previous condition when the\r\ndischarge ceases. And it is conceivable that by structural arrangements,\r\nminute sensible motions so caused may be accumulated into large sensible\r\nmotions.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 23. But the truths which it is here our business especially to note, are\r\nindependent of hypotheses or interpretations. It is sufficient for the ends\r\nin view, to observe that organic matter _does_ exhibit these several\r\nconspicuous reactions when acted on by incident forces. It is not requisite\r\nthat we should know _how_ these re-actions originate.\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter were set forth the several modes in which incident\r\nforces cause re-distributions of organic matter; and in this chapter have\r\nbeen set forth the several modes in which is manifested the motion\r\naccompanying this re-distribution. There we contemplated, under its several\r\naspects, the general fact that, in consequence of its extreme instability,\r\norganic matter undergoes extensive molecular re-arrangements on very slight\r\nchanges of conditions. And here we have contemplated, under its several\r\naspects, the correlative general fact that, during these extensive\r\nmolecular re-arrangements, there are evolved large amounts of energy. In\r\nthe one case the components of organic matter are regarded as falling from\r\npositions of unstable equilibrium to positions of stable equilibrium; and\r\nin the other case they are regarded as giving out in their falls certain\r\nmomenta--momenta that may be manifested as heat, light, electricity,\r\nnerve-force, or mechanical motion, according as the conditions determine.\r\n\r\nI will add only that these evolutions of energy are rigorously dependent on\r\nthese changes of matter. It is a corollary from the primordial truth which,\r\nas we have seen, underlies all other truths, (_First Principles_, §§ 62,\r\n189,) that whatever amount of power an organism expends in any shape, is\r\nthe correlate and equivalent of a power which was taken into it from\r\nwithout. On the one hand, it follows from the persistence of force that\r\neach portion of mechanical or other energy which an organism exerts,\r\nimplies the transformation of as much organic matter as contained this\r\nenergy in a latent state. And on the other hand, it follows from the\r\npersistence of force that no such transformation of organic matter\r\ncontaining this latent energy can take place, without the energy being in\r\none shape or other manifested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III^{A.}\r\n\r\nMETABOLISM.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 23a. In the early forties the French chemist Dumas pointed out the\r\nopposed actions of the vegetal and animal kingdoms: the one having for its\r\nchief chemical effect the decomposition of carbon-dioxide, with\r\naccompanying assimilation of its carbon and liberation of its oxygen, and\r\nthe other having for its chief chemical effect the oxidation of carbon and\r\nproduction of carbon-dioxide. Omitting those plants which contain no\r\nchlorophyll, all others de-oxidize carbon; while all animals, save the few\r\nwhich contain chlorophyll, re-oxidize carbon. This is not, indeed, a\r\ncomplete account of the general relation; since it represents animals as\r\nwholly dependent on plants, either directly or indirectly through other\r\nanimals, while plants are represented as wholly independent of animals; and\r\nthis last representation though mainly true, since plants can obtain direct\r\nfrom the inorganic world certain other constituents they need, is in some\r\nmeasure not true, since many with greater facility obtain these materials\r\nfrom the decaying bodies of animals or from their _excreta_. But after\r\nnoting this qualification the broad antithesis remains as alleged.\r\n\r\nHow are these transformations brought about? The carbon contained in\r\ncarbon-dioxide does not at a bound become incorporated in the plant, nor\r\ndoes the substance appropriated by the animal from the plant become at a\r\nbound carbon-dioxide. It is through two complex sets of changes that these\r\ntwo ultimate results are brought about. The materials forming the tissues\r\nof plants as well as the materials contained in them, are progressively\r\nelaborated from the inorganic substances; and the resulting compounds,\r\neaten and some of them assimilated by animals, pass through successive\r\nchanges which are, on the average, of an opposite character: the two sets\r\nbeing constructive and destructive. To express changes of both these\r\nnatures the term \"metabolism\" is used; and such of the metabolic changes as\r\nresult in building up from simple to compound are distinguished as\r\n\"anabolic,\" while those which result in the falling down from compound to\r\nsimple are distinguished as \"katabolic.\" These antithetical names do not\r\nindeed cover all the molecular transformations going on. Many of them,\r\nknown as isomeric, imply neither building up nor falling down: they imply\r\nre-arrangement only. But those which here chiefly concern us are the two\r\nopposed kinds described.\r\n\r\nA qualification is needful. These antithetic changes must be understood as\r\ncharacterizing plant-life and animal-life in general ways rather than in\r\nspecial ways--as expressing the transformations in their totalities but not\r\nin their details. For there are katabolic processes in plants, though they\r\nbear but a small ratio to the anabolic ones; and there are anabolic\r\nprocesses in animals, though they bear but a small ratio to the katabolic\r\nones.\r\n\r\nFrom the chemico-physical aspect of these changes we pass to those\r\ndistinguished as vital; for metabolic changes can be dealt with only as\r\nchanges effected by that living substance called protoplasm.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 23b. On the evolution-hypothesis we are obliged to assume that the\r\nearliest living things--probably minute units of protoplasm smaller than\r\nany the microscope reveals to us--had the ability to appropriate directly\r\nfrom the inorganic world both the nitrogen and the materials for\r\ncarbo-hydrates without both of which protoplasm cannot be formed; since in\r\nthe absence of preceding organic matter there was no other source. The\r\ngeneral law of evolution as well as the observed actions of _Protozoa_ and\r\n_Protophyta_, suggest that these primordial types simultaneously displayed\r\nanimal-life and plant-life. For whereas the developed animal-type cannot\r\nform from its inorganic surroundings either nitrogenous compounds or\r\ncarbo-hydrates; and whereas the developed plant-type, able to form\r\ncarbo-hydrates from its inorganic surroundings, depends for the formation\r\nof its protoplasm mainly, although indirectly, on the nitrogenous compounds\r\nderived from preceding organisms, as do also most of the plants devoid of\r\nchlorophyll--the fungi; we are obliged to assume that in the beginning,\r\nalong with the expending activities characterizing the animal-type, there\r\nwent the accumulating activities characterizing both of the vegetal\r\ntypes--forms of activity by-and-by differentiated.\r\n\r\nThough the successive steps in the artificial formation of organic\r\ncompounds have now gone so far that substances simulating proteids, if not\r\nidentical with them, have been produced, yet we have no clue to the\r\nconditions under which proteids arose; and still less have we a clue to the\r\nconditions under which inert proteids became so combined as to form active\r\nprotoplasm. The essential fact to be recognized is that living matter,\r\noriginated as we must assume during a long stage of progressive cooling in\r\nwhich the infinitely varied parts of the Earth's surface were slowly\r\npassing through appropriate physical conditions, possessed from the outset\r\nthe power of assimilating to itself the materials from which more living\r\nmatter was formed; and that since then all living matter has arisen from\r\nits self-increasing action. But now, leaving speculation concerning these\r\nanabolic changes as they commenced in the remote past, let us contemplate\r\nthem as they are carried on now--first directing our attention to those\r\npresented in the vegetal world.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 23c. The decomposition of carbon-dioxide (§ 13)--the separation of its\r\ncarbon from the combined oxygen so that it may enter into one or other form\r\nof carbo-hydrate,--is not now ordinarily effected, as we must assume it\r\nonce was, by the undifferentiated protoplasm; but is effected by a\r\nspecialized substance, chlorophyll, imbedded in the protoplasm and\r\noperating by its instrumentality. The chlorophyll-grain is not simply\r\nimmersed in protoplasm but is permeated throughout its substance by a\r\nprotoplasmic network or sponge-work apparently continuous with the\r\nprotoplasm around; or, according to Sachs, consists of protoplasm holding\r\nchlorophyll-particles in suspension: the mechanical arrangement\r\nfacilitating the chemical function. The resulting abstraction of carbon\r\nfrom carbon-dioxide, by the aid of certain ethereal undulations, appears to\r\nbe the first step in the building up of organic compounds--the first step\r\nin the primary anabolic process. We are not here concerned with details.\r\nTwo subsequent sets of changes only need here to be noted--the genesis of\r\nthe passive materials out of which plant-structure is built up, and the\r\ngenesis of the active materials by which these are produced and the\r\nbuilding up effected.\r\n\r\nThe hydrated carbon which protoplasm, having the chlorophyll-grain as its\r\nimplement, produces from carbonic acid and water, appears not to be of one\r\nkind only. The possible carbo-hydrates are almost infinite in number.\r\nMultitudes of them have been artificially made, and numerous kinds are made\r\nnaturally by plants. Though perhaps the first step in the reduction of the\r\ncarbon from its dioxide may be always the same, yet it is held probable\r\nthat in different types of plants different types of carbo-hydrates\r\nforthwith arise, and give differential characters to the compounds\r\nsubsequently formed by such types: sundry of the changes being katabolic\r\nrather than anabolic. Of leading members in the group may be named dextrin,\r\nstarch, and the various sugars characteristic of various plants, as well as\r\nthe cellulose elaborated by further anabolism. Considered as the kind of\r\ncarbo-hydrate in which the products of activity are first stored up, to be\r\nsubsequently modified for divers purposes, starch is the most important of\r\nthese; and the process of storage is suggested by the structure of the\r\nstarch-grain. This consists of superposed layers, implying intermittent\r\ndeposits: the probability being that the variations of light and heat\r\naccompanying day and night are associated now with arrest of the deposit\r\nand now with recommencement of it. Like in composition as this stored-up\r\nstarch is with sugar of one or other kind, and capable of being deposited\r\nfrom sugar and again assuming the sugar form, this substance passes, by\r\nfurther metabolism, here into the cellulose which envelopes each of the\r\nmultitudinous units of protoplasm, there into the spiral fibres, annuli, or\r\nfenestrated tubes which, in early stages of tissue-growth, form channels\r\nfor the sap, and elsewhere into other components of the general structure.\r\nThe many changes implied are effected in various ways: now by that simple\r\nre-arrangement of components known as isomeric change; now by that taking\r\nfrom a compound one of its elements and inserting one of another kind,\r\nwhich is known as substitution; and now by oxidation, as when the\r\noxy-cellulose which constitutes wood-fibre, is produced.\r\n\r\nBesides elaborating building materials, the protoplasm elaborates\r\nitself--that is, elaborates more of itself. It is chemically distinguished\r\nfrom the building materials by the presence of nitrogen. Derived from\r\natmospheric ammonia, or from decaying or excreted organic matter, or from\r\nthe products of certain fungi and microbes at its roots, the nitrogen in\r\none or other combination is brought into a plant by the upward current; and\r\nby some unknown process (not dependent on light, since it goes on equally\r\nwell if not better in darkness) the protoplasm dissociates and appropriates\r\nthis combined nitrogen and unites it with a carbo-hydrate to form one or\r\nother proteid--albumen, gluten, or some isomer; appropriating at the same\r\ntime from certain of the earth-salts the requisite amount of sulphur and in\r\nsome cases phosphorus. The ultimate step, as we must suppose, is the\r\nformation of living protoplasm out of these non-living proteids. A cardinal\r\nfact is that proteids admit of multitudinous transformations; and it seems\r\nnot improbable that in protoplasm various isomeric proteids are mingled. If\r\nso, we must conclude that protoplasm admits of almost infinite variations\r\nin nature. Of course _pari passu_ with this dual process--augmentation of\r\nprotoplasm and accompanying production of carbo-hydrates--there goes\r\nextension of plant-structure and plant-life.\r\n\r\nTo these essential metabolic processes have to be added certain ancillary\r\nand non-essential ones, ending in the formation of colouring matters,\r\nodours, essential oils, acrid secretions, bitter compounds and poisons:\r\nsome serving to attract animals and others to repel them. Sundry of these\r\nappear to be excretions--useless matters cast out, and are doubtless\r\nkatabolic.\r\n\r\nThe relation of these facts here sketched in rude outline to the doctrine\r\nof Evolution at large should be observed. Already we have seen how (§ 8a),\r\nin the course of terrestrial evolution, there has been an increasingly\r\nheterogeneous assemblage of increasing heterogeneous compounds, preparing\r\nthe way for organic life. And here we may see that during the development\r\nof plant-life from its lowest algoid and fungoid forms up to those forms\r\nwhich constitute the chief vegetal world, there has been an increasing\r\nnumber of complex organic compounds formed; displayed at once in the\r\ndiversity of them contained in the same plant and in the still greater\r\ndiversity displayed in the vast aggregate of species, genera, orders, and\r\nclasses of plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 23d. On passing to the metabolism characterizing animal life, which, as\r\nalready indicated, is in the main a process of decomposition undoing the\r\nprocess of composition characterizing vegetal life, we may fitly note at\r\nthe outset that it must have wide limits of variation, alike in different\r\nclasses of animals and even in the same animal.\r\n\r\nIf we take, on the one hand, a carnivore living on muscular tissue (for\r\nwild carnivores preying upon herbivores which can rarely become fat obtain\r\nscarcely any carbo-hydrates) and observe that its food is almost\r\nexclusively nitrogenous; and if, on the other hand, we take a graminivorous\r\nanimal the food of which (save when it eats seeds) contains comparatively\r\nlittle nitrogenous matter; we seem obliged to suppose that the parts played\r\nin the organic processes by the proteids and the carbo-hydrates can in\r\nconsiderable measures replace one another. It is true that the quantity of\r\nfood and the required alimentary system in the last case, are very much\r\ngreater than in the first case. But this difference is mainly due to the\r\ncircumstance that the food of the graminivorous animal consists chiefly of\r\nwaste-matter--ligneous fibre, cellulose, chlorophyll--and that could the\r\nstarch, sugar, and protoplasm be obtained without the waste-matter, the\r\nrequired bulks of the two kinds of food would be by no means so strongly\r\ncontrasted. This becomes manifest on comparing flesh-eating and\r\ngrain-eating birds--say a hawk and a pigeon. In powers of flight these do\r\nnot greatly differ, nor is the size of the alimentary system conspicuously\r\ngreater in the last than in the first; though probably the amount of food\r\nconsumed is greater. Still it seems clear that the supply of energy\r\nobtained by a pigeon from carbo-hydrates with a moderate proportion of\r\nproteids is not widely unlike that obtained by a hawk from proteids alone.\r\nEven from the traits of men differently fed a like inference may be drawn.\r\nOn the one hand we have the Masai who, during their warrior-days, eat flesh\r\nexclusively; and on the other hand we have the Hindus, feeding almost\r\nwholly on vegetable food. Doubtless the quantities required in these cases\r\ndiffer much; but the difference between the rations of the flesh-eater and\r\nthe grain-eater is not so immense as it would be were there no substitution\r\nin the physiological uses of the materials.\r\n\r\nConcerning the special aspects of animal-metabolism, we have first to note\r\nthose various minor transformations that are auxiliary to the general\r\ntransformation by which force is obtained from food. For many of the vital\r\nactivities merely subserve the elaboration of materials for activity at\r\nlarge, and the getting rid of waste products. From blood passing through\r\nthe salivary glands is prepared in large quantity a secretion containing\r\namong other matters a nitrogenous ferment, ptyaline, which, mixed with food\r\nduring mastication, furthers the change of its starch into sugar. Then in\r\nthe stomach come the more or less varying secretions known in combination\r\nas gastric juice. Besides certain salts and hydrochloric acid, this\r\ncontains another nitrogenous ferment, pepsin, which is instrumental in\r\ndissolving the proteids swallowed. To these two metabolic products aiding\r\nsolution of the various ingested solids, is presently added that product of\r\nmetabolism in the pancreas which, added to the chyme, effects certain other\r\nmolecular changes--notably that of such amylaceous matters as are yet\r\nunaltered, into saccharine matters to be presently absorbed. And let us\r\nnote the significant fact that the preparation of food-materials in the\r\nalimentary canal, again shows us that unstable nitrogenous compounds are\r\nthe agents which, while themselves changing, set up changes in the\r\ncarbo-hydrates and proteids around: the nitrogen plays the same part here\r\nas elsewhere. It does the like in yet another viscus. Blood which passes\r\nthrough the spleen on its way to the liver, is exposed to the action of \"a\r\nspecial proteid of the nature of alkali-albumin, holding iron in some way\r\npeculiarly associated with it.\" Lastly we come to that all-important organ\r\nthe liver, at once a factory and a storehouse. Here several metabolisms are\r\nsimultaneously carried on. There is that which until recent years was\r\nsupposed to be the sole hepatic process--the formation of bile. In some\r\nliver-cells are masses of oil-globules, which seem to imply a carbo-hydrate\r\nmetamorphosis. And then, of leading importance, comes the extensive\r\nproduction of that animal-starch known as glycogen--a substance which, in\r\neach of the cells generating it, is contained in a plexus of protoplasmic\r\nthreads: again a nitrogenous body diffused through a mass which is now\r\nformed out of sugar and is now dissolved again into sugar. For it appears\r\nthat this soluble form of carbo-hydrate, taken into the liver from the\r\nintestine, is there, when not immediately needed, stored up in the form of\r\nglycogen, ready to be re-dissolved and carried into the system either for\r\nimmediate use or for re-deposit as glycogen at the places where it is\r\npresently to be consumed: the great deposit in the liver and the minor\r\ndeposits in the muscles being, to use the simile of Prof. Michael Foster,\r\nanalogous in their functions to a central bank and branch banks.\r\n\r\nAn instructive parallelism may be noted between these processes carried on\r\nin the animal organism and those carried on in the vegetal organism. For\r\nthe carbo-hydrates named, easily made to assume the soluble or the\r\ninsoluble form by the addition or subtraction of a molecule of water, and\r\nthus fitted sometimes for distribution and sometimes for accumulation, are\r\nsimilarly dealt with in the two cases. As the animal-starch, glycogen, is\r\nnow stored up in the liver or elsewhere and now changed into glucose to be\r\ntransferred, perhaps for consumption and perhaps for re-deposit; so the\r\nvegetal starch, made to alternate between soluble and insoluble states, is\r\nnow carried to growing parts where by metabolic change it becomes cellulose\r\nor other component of tissue and now carried to some place where, changed\r\nback into starch, it is laid aside for future use; as it is in the turgid\r\ninside leaves of a cabbage, the root of a turnip, or the swollen\r\nunderground stem we know as a potato: the matter which in the animal is\r\nused up in generating movement and heat, being in the plant used up in\r\ngenerating structures. Nor is the parallelism even now exhausted; for, as\r\nby a plant starch is stored up in each seed for the subsequent use of the\r\nembryo, so in an embryo-animal glycogen is stored up in the developing\r\nmuscles for subsequent use in the completion of their structures.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 23e. We come now to the supreme and all-pervading metabolism which has\r\nfor its effects the conspicuous manifestations of life--the nervous and\r\nmuscular activities. Here comes up afresh a question discussed in the\r\nedition of 1864--a question to be reconsidered in the light of recent\r\nknowledge--the question what particular metabolic changes are they by which\r\nin muscle the energy existing under the form of molecular motion is\r\ntransformed into the energy manifested as molar motion?\r\n\r\nThere are two views respecting the nature of this transformation. One is\r\nthat the carbo-hydrate present in muscle must, by further metabolism, be\r\nraised into the form of a nitrogenous compound or compounds before it can\r\nbe made to undergo that sudden decomposition which initiates muscular\r\ncontraction. The other is the view set forth in § 15, and there reinforced\r\nby further illustrations which have occurred to me while preparing this\r\nrevised edition--the view that the carbo-hydrate in muscle, everywhere in\r\ncontact with unstable nitrogenous substance, is, by the shock of a small\r\nmolecular change in this, made to undergo an extensive molecular change,\r\nresulting in the oxidation of its carbon and consequent liberation of much\r\nmolecular motion. Both of these are at present only hypotheses, in support\r\nof which respectively the probabilities have to be weighed. Let us compare\r\nthem and observe on which side the evidence preponderates.\r\n\r\nWe are obliged to conclude that in carnivorous animals the katabolic\r\nprocess is congruous with the first of these views, in so far that the\r\nevolution of energy must in some way result solely from the fall of complex\r\nnitrogenous compounds into those simpler matters which make their\r\nappearance as waste; for, practically, the carnivorous animal has no\r\ncarbo-hydrates out of which otherwise to evolve force. To this admission,\r\nhowever, it should be added that possibly out of the exclusively\r\nnitrogenous food, glycogen or sugar has to be obtained by partial\r\ndecomposition before muscular action can take place. But when we pass to\r\nanimals having food consisting mainly of carbo-hydrates, several\r\ndifficulties stand in the way of the hypothesis that, by further\r\ncompounding, proteids must be formed from the carbo-hydrates before\r\nmuscular energy can be evolved. In the first place the anabolic change\r\nthrough which, by the addition of nitrogen, &c., a proteid is formed from a\r\ncarbo-hydrate, must absorb an energy equal to a moiety of that which is\r\ngiven out in the subsequent katabolic change. There can be no dynamic\r\nprofit on such part of the transaction as effects the composition and\r\nsubsequent decomposition of the proteid, but only on such part of the\r\ntransaction as effects the decomposition of the carbo-hydrate. In the\r\nsecond place there arises the question--whence comes the nitrogen required\r\nfor the compounding of the carbo-hydrates into proteids? There is none save\r\nthat contained in the serum-albumen or other proteid which the blood\r\nbrings; and there can be no gain in robbing this proteid of nitrogen for\r\nthe purpose of forming another proteid. Hence the nitrogenizing of the\r\nsurplus carbo-hydrates is not accounted for. One more difficulty remains.\r\nIf the energy given out by a muscle results from the katabolic consumption\r\nof its proteids, then the quantity of nitrogenous waste matters formed\r\nshould be proportionate to the quantity of work done. But experiments have\r\nproved that this is not the case. Long ago it was shown that the amount of\r\nurea excreted does not increase in anything like proportion to the amount\r\nof muscular energy expended; and recently this has been again shown.\r\n\r\nOn this statement a criticism has been made to the following\r\neffect:--Considering that muscle will contract when deprived of oxygen and\r\nblood and must therefore contain matter from which the energy is derived;\r\nand considering that since carbonic acid is given out the required carbon\r\nand oxygen must be derived from some component of muscle; it results that\r\nthe energy must be obtained by decomposition of a nitrogenous body. To this\r\nreasoning it may be objected, in the first place, that the conditions\r\nspecified are abnormal, and that it is dangerous to assume that what takes\r\nplace under abnormal conditions takes place also under normal ones. In\r\npresence of blood and oxygen the process may possibly, or even probably, be\r\nunlike that which arises in their absence: the muscular substance may begin\r\nconsuming itself when it has not the usual materials to consume. Then, in\r\nthe second place, and chiefly, it may be replied that the difficulty raised\r\nin the foregoing argument is not escaped but merely obscured. If, as is\r\nalleged, the carbon and oxygen from which carbonic acid is produced, form,\r\nunder the conditions stated, parts of a complex nitrogenous substance\r\ncontained in muscle, then the abstraction of the carbon and oxygen must\r\ncause decomposition of this nitrogenous substance; and in that case the\r\nexcretion of nitrogenous waste must be proportionate to the amount of work\r\ndone, which it is not. This difficulty is evaded by supposing that the\r\n\"stored complex explosive substance must be, in living muscle, of such\r\nnature\" that after explosion it leaves a \"nitrogenous residue available for\r\nre-combination with fresh portions of carbon and oxygen derived from the\r\nblood and thereby the re-constitution of the explosive substance.\" This\r\nimplies that a molecule of the explosive substance consists of a complex\r\nnitrogenous molecule united with a molecule of carbo-hydrate, and that time\r\nafter time it suddenly decomposes this carbo-hydrate molecule and thereupon\r\ntakes up another such from the blood. That the carbon is abstracted from\r\nthe carbo-hydrate molecule can scarcely be said, since the feebler\r\naffinities of the nitrogenous molecule can hardly be supposed to overcome\r\nthe stronger affinities of the carbo-hydrate molecule. The carbo-hydrate\r\nmolecule must therefore be incorporated bodily. What is the implication?\r\nThe carbo-hydrate part of the compound is relatively stable, while the\r\nnitrogenous part is relatively unstable. Hence the hypothesis implies that,\r\ntime after time, the unstable nitrogenous part overthrows the stable\r\ncarbo-hydrate part, without being itself overthrown. This conclusion, to\r\nsay the least of it, does not appear very probable.\r\n\r\nThe alternative hypothesis, indirectly supported as we saw by proofs that\r\noutside the body small amounts of change in nitrogenous compounds initiate\r\nlarge amounts of change in carbonaceous compounds, may in the first place\r\nbe here supported by some further indirect evidences of kindred natures. A\r\nhaystack prematurely put together supplies one. Enough water having been\r\nleft in the hay to permit chemical action, the decomposing proteids forming\r\nthe dead protoplasm in each cell, set up decomposition of the\r\ncarbo-hydrates with accompanying oxidation of the carbon and genesis of\r\nheat; even to the extent of producing fire. Again, as shown above, this\r\nrelation between these two classes of compounds is exemplified in the\r\nalimentary canal; where, alike in the saliva and in the pancreatic\r\nsecretion, minute quantities of unstable nitrogenous bodies transform great\r\nquantities of stable carbo-hydrates. Thus we find indirect reinforcements\r\nof the belief that the katabolic change generating muscular energy is one\r\nin which a large decomposition of a carbo-hydrate is set up by a small\r\ndecomposition of a proteid.[12]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 23f. A certain general trait of animal organization may fitly be named\r\nbecause its relevance, though still more indirect, is very significant.\r\nUnder one of its aspects an animal is an apparatus for the multiplication\r\nof energies--a set of appliances by means of which a minute amount of\r\nmotion initiates a larger amount of motion, and this again a still larger\r\namount. There are structures which do this mechanically and others which do\r\nit chemically.\r\n\r\nAssociated with the peripheral ends of the nerves of touch are certain\r\nsmall bodies--_corpuscula tactus_--each of which, when disturbed by\r\nsomething in contact with the skin, presses on the adjacent fibre more\r\nstrongly than soft tissue would do, and thus multiplies the force producing\r\nsensation. While serving the further purpose of touching at a distance, the\r\n_vibrissæ_ or whiskers of a feline animal achieve a like end in a more\r\neffectual way. The external portion of each bristle acts as the long arm of\r\na lever, and the internal portion as the short arm. The result is that a\r\nslight touch at the outer end of the bristle produces a considerable\r\npressure of the inner end on the nerve-terminal: so intensifying the\r\nimpression. In the hearing organs of various inferior types of animals, the\r\notolites in contact with the auditory nerves, when they are struck by\r\nsound-waves, give to the nerves much stronger impressions than these would\r\nhave were they simply immersed in loose tissue; and in the ears of\r\ndeveloped creatures there exist more elaborate appliances for augmenting\r\nthe effects of aerial vibrations. From this multiplication of molar actions\r\nlet us pass to the multiplication of molecular actions. The retina is made\r\nup of minute rods and cones, so packed together side by side that they can\r\nbe separately affected by the separate parts of the images of objects. As\r\neach of them is but 1/10,000th of an inch in diameter, the ethereal\r\nundulations falling upon it can produce an amount of change almost\r\ninfinitesimal--an amount probably incapable of exciting a nerve-centre, or\r\nindeed of overcoming the molecular inertia of the nerve leading to it. But\r\nin close proximity are layers of granules into which the rods and cones\r\nsend fibres, and beyond these, about 1/100th of an inch from the retinal\r\nlayer, lie ganglion-cells, in each of which a minute disturbance may\r\nreadily evolve a larger disturbance; so that by multiplication, single or\r\nperhaps double, there is produced a force sufficient to excite the fibre\r\nconnected with the centre of vision. Such, at least, judging from the\r\nrequirement and the structure, seems to me the probable interpretation of\r\nthe visual process; though whether it is the accepted one I do not know.\r\n\r\nBut now, carrying with us the conception made clear by the first cases and\r\nsuggested by the last, we shall appreciate the extent to which this general\r\nphysiological method, as we may call it, is employed. The convulsive action\r\ncaused by tickling shows it conspicuously. An extremely small amount of\r\nmolecular change in the nerve-endings produces an immense amount of\r\nmolecular change, and resulting molar motion, in the muscles. Especially is\r\nthis seen in one whose spinal cord has been so injured that it no longer\r\nconveys sensations from the lower limbs to the brain; and in whom,\r\nnevertheless, tickling of the feet produces convulsive actions of the legs\r\nmore violent even than result when sensation exists: clearly proving that\r\nsince the minute molecular change produced by the tickling in the\r\nnerve-terminals cannot be equivalent in quantity to the amount implied by\r\nthe muscular contraction, there must be a multiplication of it in those\r\nparts of the spinal cord whence issue the reflex stimuli to the muscles.\r\n\r\nReturning now to the question of metabolism, we may see that the processes\r\nof multiplication above supposed to take place in muscle, are analogous in\r\ntheir general nature to various other physiological processes. Carrying\r\nsomewhat further the simile used in § 15 and going back to the days when\r\ndetonators, though used for small arms, were not used for artillery, we may\r\ncompare the metabolic process in muscle to that which would take place if a\r\npistol were fired against the touch-hole of a loaded cannon: the cap\r\nexploding the pistol and the pistol the cannon. For in the case of the\r\nmuscle, the implication is that a nervous discharge works in certain\r\nunstable proteids through which the nerve-endings are distributed, a small\r\namount of molecular change; that the shock of this causes a much larger\r\namount of molecular change in the inter-diffused carbo-hydrate, with\r\naccompanying oxidation of its carbon; and that the heat liberated sets up a\r\ntransformation, probably isomeric, in the contractile substance of the\r\nmuscular fibre: an interpretation supported by cases in which small rises\r\nand falls of temperature cause alternating isomeric changes; as instance\r\nMensel's salt.\r\n\r\nEnding here this exposition, somewhat too speculative and running into\r\ndetails inappropriate to a work of this kind, it suffices to note the most\r\ngeneral facts concerning metabolism. Regarded as a whole it includes, in\r\nthe first place, those anabolic or building-up processes specially\r\ncharacterizing plants, during which the impacts of ethereal undulations are\r\nstored up in compound molecules of unstable kinds; and it includes, in the\r\nsecond place, those katabolic or tumbling-down changes specially\r\ncharacterizing animals, during which this accumulated molecular motion\r\n(contained in the food directly or indirectly supplied by plants), is in\r\nlarge measure changed into those molar motions constituting animal\r\nactivities. There are multitudinous metabolic changes of minor kinds which\r\nare ancillary to these--many katabolic changes in plants and many anabolic\r\nchanges in animals--but these are the essential ones.[13]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.[14]\r\n\r\nPROXIMATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 24. To those who accept the general doctrine of Evolution, it need\r\nscarcely be pointed out that classifications are subjective conceptions,\r\nwhich have no absolute demarcations in Nature corresponding to them. They\r\nare appliances by which we limit and arrange the matters under\r\ninvestigation; and so facilitate our thinking. Consequently, when we\r\nattempt to define anything complex, or make a generalization of facts other\r\nthan the most simple, we can scarcely ever avoid including more than we\r\nintended, or leaving out something which should be taken in. Thus it\r\nhappens that on seeking a definite idea of Life, we have great difficulty\r\nin finding one that is neither more nor less than sufficient. Let us look\r\nat a few of the most tenable definitions that have been given. While\r\nrecognizing the respects in which they are defective, we shall see what\r\nrequirements a more satisfactory one must fulfil.\r\n\r\nSchelling said that Life is the tendency to individuation. This formula,\r\nuntil studied, conveys little meaning. But we need only consider it as\r\nillustrated by the facts of development, or by the contrast between lower\r\nand higher forms of life, to recognize its significance; especially in\r\nrespect of comprehensiveness. As before shown, however (_First Principles_,\r\n§ 56), it is objectionable; partly on the ground that it refers not so much\r\nto the functional changes constituting Life, as to the structural changes\r\nof those aggregates of matter which manifest Life; and partly on the ground\r\nthat it includes under the idea Life, much that we usually exclude from it:\r\nfor instance--crystallization.\r\n\r\nThe definition of Richerand,--\"Life is a collection of phenomena which\r\nsucceed each other during a limited time in an organized body,\"--is liable\r\nto the fatal criticism, that it equally applies to the decay which goes on\r\nafter death. For this, too, is \"a collection of phenomena which succeed\r\neach other during a limited time in an organized body.\"\r\n\r\n\"Life,\" according to De Blainville, \"is the two-fold internal movement of\r\ncomposition and decomposition, at once general and continuous.\" This\r\nconception is in some respects too narrow, and in other respects too wide.\r\nOn the one hand, while it expresses what physiologists distinguish as\r\nvegetative life, it does not indicate those nervous and muscular functions\r\nwhich form the most conspicuous and distinctive classes of vital phenomena.\r\nOn the other hand, it describes not only the integrating and disintegrating\r\nprocess going on in a living body, but it equally well describes those\r\ngoing on in a galvanic battery; which also exhibits a \"two-fold internal\r\nmovement of composition and decomposition, at once general and continuous.\"\r\n\r\nElsewhere, I have myself proposed to define Life as \"the co-ordination of\r\nactions.\"[15] This definition has some advantages. It includes all organic\r\nchanges, alike of the viscera, the limbs, and the brain. It excludes the\r\ngreat mass of inorganic changes; which display little or no co-ordination.\r\nBy making co-ordination the specific character of vitality, it involves the\r\ntruths, that an arrest of co-ordination is death, and that imperfect\r\nco-ordination is disease. Moreover, it harmonizes with our ordinary ideas\r\nof life in its different grades; seeing that the organisms which we rank as\r\nlow in their degrees of life, are those which display but little\r\nco-ordination of actions; and seeing that from these up to man, the\r\nrecognized increase in degree of life corresponds with an increase in the\r\nextent and complexity of co-ordinations. But, like the others, this\r\ndefinition includes too much. It may be said of the Solar System, with its\r\nregularly-recurring movements and its self-balancing perturbations, that\r\nit, also, exhibits co-ordination of actions. And however plausibly it may\r\nbe argued that, in the abstract, the motions of the planets and satellites\r\nare as properly comprehended in the idea of life as the changes going on in\r\na motionless, unsensitive seed: yet, it must be admitted that they are\r\nforeign to that idea as commonly received, and as here to be formulated.\r\n\r\nIt remains to add the definition since suggested by Mr. G. H. Lewes--\"Life\r\nis a series of definite and successive changes, both of structure and\r\ncomposition, which take place within an individual without destroying its\r\nidentity.\" The last fact which this statement brings into view--the\r\npersistence of a living organism as a whole, in spite of the continuous\r\nremoval and replacement of its parts--is important. But otherwise it may be\r\nargued that, since changes of structure and composition, though\r\nconcomitants of muscular and nervous actions, are not the muscular and\r\nnervous actions themselves, the definite excludes the more visible\r\nmovements with which our idea of life is most associated; and further that,\r\nin describing vital changes as _a series_, it scarcely includes the fact\r\nthat many of them, as Nutrition, Circulation, Respiration, and Secretion,\r\nin their many subdivisions, go on simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThus, however well each of these definitions expresses the phenomena of\r\nlife under some of its aspects, no one of them is more than approximately\r\ntrue. It may turn out that to find a formula which will bear every test is\r\nimpossible. Meanwhile, it is possible to frame a more adequate formula than\r\nany of the foregoing. As we shall presently find, these all omit an\r\nessential peculiarity of vital changes in general--a peculiarity which,\r\nperhaps more than any other, distinguishes them from non-vital changes.\r\nBefore specifying this peculiarity, however, it will be well to trace our\r\nway, step by step, to as complete an idea of Life as may be reached from\r\nour present stand-point; by doing which we shall both see the necessity for\r\neach limitation as it is made, and ultimately be led to feel the need for a\r\nfurther limitation.\r\n\r\nAnd here, as the best mode of determining what are the traits which\r\ndistinguish vitality from non-vitality, we shall do well to compare the two\r\nmost unlike kinds of vitality, and see in what they agree. Manifestly, that\r\nwhich is essential to Life must be that which is common to Life of all\r\norders. And manifestly, that which is common to all forms of Life, will\r\nmost readily be seen on contrasting those forms of Life which have the\r\nleast in common, or are the most unlike.[16]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 25. Choosing assimilation, then, for our example of bodily life, and\r\nreasoning for our example of that life known as intelligence; it is first\r\nto be observed, that they are both processes of change. Without change,\r\nfood cannot be taken into the blood nor transformed into tissue; without\r\nchange, there can be no getting from premisses to conclusion. And it is\r\nthis conspicuous display of changes which forms the substratum of our idea\r\nof Life in general. Doubtless we see innumerable changes to which no notion\r\nof vitality attaches. Inorganic bodies are ever undergoing changes of\r\ntemperature, changes of colour, changes of aggregation; and decaying\r\norganic bodies also. But it will be admitted that the great majority of the\r\nphenomena displayed by inanimate bodies, are statical and not dynamical;\r\nthat the modifications of inanimate bodies are mostly slow and unobtrusive;\r\nthat on the one hand, when we see sudden movements in inanimate bodies, we\r\nare apt to assume living agency, and on the other hand, when we see no\r\nmovements in living bodies, we are apt to assume death. Manifestly then, be\r\nthe requisite qualifications what they may, a true idea of Life must be an\r\nidea of some kind of change or changes.\r\n\r\nOn further comparing assimilation and reasoning, with a view of seeing in\r\nwhat respect the changes displayed in both differs from non-vital changes,\r\nwe find that they differ in being not simple changes; in each case there\r\nare _successive_ changes. The transformation of food into tissue involves\r\nmastication, deglutition, chymification, chylification, absorption, and\r\nthose various actions gone through after the lacteal ducts have poured\r\ntheir contents into the blood. Carrying on an argument necessitates a long\r\nchain of states of consciousness; each implying a change of the preceding\r\nstate. Inorganic changes, however, do not in any considerable degree\r\nexhibit this peculiarity. It is true that from meteorologic causes,\r\ninanimate objects are daily, sometimes hourly, undergoing modifications of\r\ntemperature, of bulk, of hygrometric and electric condition. Not only,\r\nhowever, do these modifications lack that conspicuousness and that rapidity\r\nof succession which vital ones possess, but vital ones form an _additional_\r\nseries. Living as well as not-living bodies are affected by atmospheric\r\ninfluences; and beyond the changes which these produce, living bodies\r\nexhibit other changes, more numerous and more marked. So that though\r\norganic change is not rigorously distinguished from inorganic change by\r\npresenting successive phases; yet vital change so greatly exceeds other\r\nchange in this respect, that we may consider it as a distinctive character.\r\nLife, then, as thus roughly differentiated, may be regarded as change\r\npresenting successive phases; or otherwise, as a series of changes.  And it\r\nshould be observed, as a fact in harmony with this conception, that the\r\nhigher the life the more conspicuous the variations. On comparing inferior\r\nwith superior organisms, these last will be seen to display more rapid\r\nchanges, or a more lengthened series of them, or both.\r\n\r\nOn contemplating afresh our two typical phenomena, we may see that vital\r\nchange is further distinguished from non-vital change, by being made up of\r\nmany _simultaneous_ changes. Nutrition is not simply a series of actions,\r\nbut includes many actions going on together. During mastication the stomach\r\nis busy with food already swallowed, on which it is pouring out solvent\r\nfluids and expending muscular efforts. While the stomach is still active,\r\nthe intestines are performing their secretive, contractile, and absorbent\r\nfunctions; and at the same time that one meal is being digested, the\r\nnutriment obtained from a previous meal is undergoing transformation into\r\ntissue. So too is it, in a certain sense, with mental changes. Though the\r\nstates of consciousness which make up an argument occur in series, yet, as\r\neach of them is complex, a number of simultaneous changes have taken place\r\nin establishing it. Here as before, however, it must be admitted that the\r\ndistinction between animate and inanimate is not precise. No mass of dead\r\nmatter can have its temperature altered, without at the same time\r\nundergoing an alteration in bulk, and sometimes also in hygrometric state.\r\nAn inorganic body cannot be compressed, without being at the same time\r\nchanged in form, atomic arrangement, temperature, and electric condition.\r\nAnd in a vast and mobile aggregate like the sea, the simultaneous as well\r\nas the successive changes outnumber those going on in an animal.\r\nNevertheless, speaking generally, a living thing is distinguished from a\r\ndead thing by the multiplicity of the changes at any moment taking place in\r\nit. Moreover, by this peculiarity, as by the previous one, not only is the\r\nvital more or less clearly marked off from the non-vital; but creatures\r\npossessing high vitality are marked off from those possessing low vitality.\r\nIt needs but to contrast the many organs cooperating in a mammal, with the\r\nfew in a polype, to see that the actions which are progressing together in\r\nthe body of the first, as much exceed in number the actions progressing\r\ntogether in the body of the last, as these do those in a stone. As at\r\npresent conceived, then, Life consists of simultaneous and successive\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nContinuance of the comparison shows that vital changes, both visceral and\r\ncerebral, differ from other changes in their _heterogeneity_. Neither the\r\nsimultaneous acts nor the serial acts, which together constitute the\r\nprocess of digestion, are alike. The states of consciousness comprised in\r\nany ratiocination are not repetitions one of another, either in composition\r\nor in modes of dependence. Inorganic processes, on the other hand, even\r\nwhen like organic ones in the number of the simultaneous and successive\r\nchanges they involve, are unlike them in the relative homogeneity of these\r\nchanges. In the case of the sea, just referred to, it is observable that\r\ncountless as are the actions at any moment going on, they are mostly\r\nmechanical actions that are to a great degree similar; and in this respect\r\ndiffer widely from the actions at any moment taking place in an organism.\r\nEven where life is nearly simulated, as by the working of a steam-engine,\r\nwe see that considerable as is the number of simultaneous changes, and\r\nrapid as are the successive ones, the regularity with which they soon recur\r\nin the same order and degree, renders them unlike those varied changes\r\nexhibited by a living creature.  Still, this peculiarity, like the\r\nforegoing ones, does not divide the two classes of changes with precision;\r\nsince there are inanimate things presenting considerable heterogeneity of\r\nchange: for instance, a cloud. The variations of state which this\r\nundergoes, both simultaneous and successive, are many and quick; and they\r\ndiffer widely from one another both in quality and quantity. At the same\r\ninstant there may occur change of position, change of form, change of size,\r\nchange of density, change of colour, change of temperature, change of\r\nelectric state; and these several kinds of change are continuously\r\ndisplayed in different degrees and combinations. Yet when we observe that\r\nvery few inorganic objects manifest heterogeneity of change comparable to\r\nthat manifested by organic objects, and further, that in ascending from low\r\nto high forms of life, we meet with an increasing variety in the kinds of\r\nchanges displayed; we see that there is here a further leading distinction\r\nbetween vital and non-vital actions. According to this modified conception,\r\nthen, Life is made up of heterogeneous changes both simultaneous and\r\nsuccessive.\r\n\r\nIf, now, we look for some trait common to the nutritive and logical\r\nprocesses, by which they are distinguished from those inorganic processes\r\nthat are most like them in the heterogeneity of the simultaneous and\r\nsuccessive changes they comprise, we discover that they are distinguished\r\nby the _combination_ among their constituent changes. The acts which make\r\nup digestion are mutually dependent. Those composing a train of reasoning\r\nare in close connection. And, generally, it is to be remarked of vital\r\nchanges, that each is made possible by all, and all are affected by each.\r\nRespiration, circulation, absorption, secretion, in their many\r\nsub-divisions, are bound up together. Muscular contraction involves\r\nchemical change, change of temperature, and change in the excretions.\r\nActive thought influences the operations of the stomach, of the heart, of\r\nthe kidneys. But we miss this union among non-vital activities. Life-like\r\nas may seem the action of a volcano in respect of the heterogeneity of its\r\nmany simultaneous and successive changes, it is not life-like in respect of\r\ntheir combination. Though the chemical, mechanical, thermal, and electric\r\nphenomena exhibited have some inter-dependence, yet the emissions of\r\nstones, mud, lava, flame, ashes, smoke, steam, take place irregularly in\r\nquantity, order, intervals, and mode of conjunction.  Even here, however,\r\nit cannot be said that inanimate things present no parallels to animate\r\nones.  A glacier may be instanced as showing nearly as much combination in\r\nits change as a plant of the lowest organization. It is ever growing and\r\never decaying; and the rates of its composition and decomposition preserve\r\na tolerably constant ratio. It moves; and its motion is in immediate\r\ndependence on its thawing. It emits a torrent of water, which, in common\r\nwith its motion, undergoes annual variations as plants do. During part of\r\nthe year the surface melts and freezes alternately; and on these changes\r\ndepend the variations in movement, and in efflux of water. Thus we have\r\ngrowth, decay, changes of temperature, changes of consistence, changes of\r\nvelocity, changes of excretion, all going on in connexion; and it may be as\r\ntruly said of a glacier as of an animal, that by ceaseless integration and\r\ndisintegration it gradually undergoes an entire change of substance without\r\nlosing its individuality. This exceptional instance, however, will scarcely\r\nbe held to obscure that broad distinction from inorganic processes which\r\norganic processes derive from the combination among their constituent\r\nchanges. And the reality of this distinction becomes yet more manifest when\r\nwe find that, in common with previous ones, it not only marks off the\r\nliving from the not-living, but also things which live little from things\r\nwhich live much. For while the changes going on in a plant or a zoophyte\r\nare so imperfectly combined that they can continue after it has been\r\ndivided into two or more pieces, the combination among the changes going on\r\nin a mammal is so close that no part cut off from the rest can live, and\r\nany considerable disturbance of one chief function causes a cessation of\r\nthe others. Hence, as we now regard it, Life is a combination of\r\nheterogeneous changes, both simultaneous and successive.\r\n\r\nWhen we once more look for a character common to these two kinds of vital\r\naction, we perceive that the combinations of heterogeneous changes which\r\nconstitute them, differ from the few combinations which they otherwise\r\nresemble, in respect of _definiteness_. The associated changes going on in\r\na glacier, admit of indefinite variation. Under a conceivable alteration of\r\nclimate, its thawing and its progression may be stopped for a million\r\nyears, without disabling it from again displaying these phenomena under\r\nappropriate conditions. By a geological convulsion, its motion may be\r\narrested without an arrest of its thawing; or by an increase in the\r\ninclination of the surface it slides over, its motion may be accelerated\r\nwithout accelerating its rate of dissolution. Other things remaining the\r\nsame, a more rapid deposit of snow may cause great increase of bulk; or,\r\nconversely, the accretion may entirely cease, and yet all the other actions\r\ncontinue until the mass disappears. Here, then, the combination has none of\r\nthat definiteness which, in a plant, marks the mutual dependence of\r\nrespiration, assimilation, and circulation; much less has it that\r\ndefiniteness seen in the mutual dependence of the chief animal functions;\r\nno one of which can be varied without varying the rest; no one of which can\r\ngo on unless the rest go on. Moreover, this definiteness of combination\r\ndistinguishes the changes occurring in a living body from those occurring\r\nin a dead one. Decomposition exhibits both simultaneous and successive\r\nchanges, which are to some extent heterogeneous, and in a sense combined;\r\nbut they are not combined in a definite manner. They vary according as the\r\nsurrounding medium is air, water, or earth. They alter in nature with the\r\ntemperature. If the local conditions are unlike, they progress differently\r\nin different parts of the mass, without mutual influence. They may end in\r\nproducing gases, or adipocire, or the dry substance of which mummies\r\nconsist. They may occupy a few days or thousands of years. Thus, neither in\r\ntheir simultaneous nor in their successive changes, do dead bodies display\r\nthat definiteness of combination which characterizes living ones.  It is\r\ntrue that in some inferior creatures the cycle of successive changes admits\r\nof a certain indefiniteness--that it may be suspended for a long period by\r\ndesiccation or freezing, and may afterwards go on as though there had been\r\nno breach in its continuity. But the circumstance that only a low order of\r\nlife can have its changes thus modified, serves but to suggest that, like\r\nthe previous characteristics, this characteristic of definiteness in its\r\ncombined changes, distinguishes high vitality from low vitality, as it\r\ndistinguishes low vitality from inorganic processes. Hence, our formula as\r\nfurther amended reads thus:--Life is a definite combination of heterogenous\r\nchanges, both simultaneous and successive.\r\n\r\nFinally, we shall still better express the facts if, instead of saying _a_\r\ndefinite combination of heterogeneous changes, we say _the_ definite\r\ncombination of heterogeneous changes. As it at present stands, the\r\ndefinition is defective both in allowing that there may be _other_ definite\r\ncombinations of heterogeneous changes, and in directing attention to the\r\nheterogeneous changes rather than to the definiteness of their combination.\r\nJust as it is not so much its chemical elements which constitute an\r\norganism, as it is the arrangement of them into special tissues and organs;\r\nso it is not so much its heterogeneous changes which constitute Life, as it\r\nis the co-ordination of them. Observe what it is that ceases when life\r\nceases. In a dead body there are going on heterogeneous changes, both\r\nsimultaneous and successive. What then has disappeared? The definite\r\ncombination has disappeared. Mark, too, that however heterogeneous the\r\nsimultaneous and successive changes exhibited by such an inorganic object\r\nas a volcano, we much less tend to think of it as living than we do a watch\r\nor a steam-engine, which, though displaying changes that, serially\r\ncontemplated, are largely homogeneous, displays them definitely combined.\r\nSo dominant an element is this in our idea of Life, that even when an\r\nobject is motionless, yet, if its parts be definitely combined, we conclude\r\neither that it has had life, or has been made by something having life.\r\nThus, then, we conclude that Life is--_the_ definite combination of\r\nheterogeneous changes, both simultaneous and successive.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 26. Such is the conception at which we arrive without changing our\r\nstand-point. It is, however, an incomplete conception. This ultimate\r\nformula (which is to a considerable extent identical with one above\r\ngiven--\"the co-ordination of actions;\" seeing that \"definite combination\"\r\nis synonymous with \"co-ordination,\" and \"changes both simultaneous and\r\nsuccessive\" are comprehended under the term \"actions;\" but which differs\r\nfrom it in specifying the fact, that the actions or changes are\r\n\"heterogeneous\")--this ultimate formula, I say, is after all but a rude\r\napproximation. It is true that it does not fail by including the growth of\r\na crystal; for the successive changes this implies cannot be called\r\nheterogeneous. It is true that the action of a galvanic battery is not\r\ncomprised in it; since here, too, heterogeneity is not exhibited by the\r\nsuccessive changes. It is true that by this same qualification the motions\r\nof the Solar System are excluded, as are also those of a watch and a\r\nsteam-engine. It is true, moreover, that while, in virtue of their\r\nheterogeneity, the actions going on in a cloud, in a volcano, in a glacier,\r\nfulfil the definition; they fall short of it in lacking definiteness of\r\ncombination. It is further true that this definiteness of combination\r\ndistinguishes the changes taking place in an organism during life from\r\nthose which commence at death. And beyond all this it is true that, as well\r\nas serving to mark off, more or less clearly, organic actions from\r\ninorganic actions, each member of the definition serves to mark off the\r\nactions constituting high vitality from those constituting low vitality;\r\nseeing that life is high in proportion to the number of successive changes\r\noccurring between birth and death; in proportion to the number of\r\nsimultaneous changes; in proportion to the heterogeneity of the changes; in\r\nproportion to the combination subsisting among the changes; and in\r\nproportion to the definiteness of their combination. Nevertheless,\r\nanswering though it does to so many requirements, this definition is\r\nessentially defective. _The definite combination of heterogeneous changes,\r\nboth simultaneous and successive_, is a formula which fails to call up an\r\nadequate conception. And it fails from omitting the most distinctive\r\npeculiarity--the peculiarity of which we have the most familiar experience,\r\nand with which our notion of Life is, more than with any other, associated.\r\nIt remains now to supplement the conception by the addition of this\r\npeculiarity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND ITS CIRCUMSTANCES.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 27. We habitually distinguish between a live object and a dead one, by\r\nobserving whether a change which we make in the surrounding conditions, or\r\none which Nature makes in them, is or is not followed by some perceptible\r\nchange in the object. By discovering that certain things shrink when\r\ntouched, or fly away when approached, or start when a noise is made, the\r\nchild first roughly discriminates between the living and the not-living;\r\nand the man when in doubt whether an animal he is looking at is dead or\r\nnot, stirs it with his stick; or if it be at a distance, shouts, or throws\r\na stone at it. Vegetal and animal life are alike primarily recognized by\r\nthis process. The tree that puts out leaves when the spring brings increase\r\nof temperature, the flower which opens and closes with the rising and\r\nsetting of the sun, the plant that droops when the soil is dry and\r\nre-erects itself when watered, are considered alive because of these\r\ninduced changes; in common with the acorn-shell which contracts when a\r\nshadow suddenly falls on it, the worm that comes to the surface when the\r\nground is continuously shaken, and the hedgehog that rolls itself up when\r\nattacked.\r\n\r\nNot only, however, do we look for some response when an external stimulus\r\nis applied to a living organism, but we expect a fitness in the response.\r\nDead as well as living things display changes under certain changes of\r\ncondition: instance, a lump of carbonate of soda that effervesces when\r\ndropped into sulphuric acid; a cord that contracts when wetted; a piece of\r\nbread that turns brown when held near the fire. But in these cases, we do\r\nnot see a connexion between the changes undergone and the preservation of\r\nthe things that undergo them; or, to avoid any teleological\r\nimplication--the changes have no apparent relations to future events which\r\nare sure or likely to take place. In vital changes, however, such relations\r\nare manifest. Light being necessary to vegetal life, we see in the action\r\nof a plant which, when much shaded, grows towards the unshaded side, an\r\nappropriateness which we should not see did it grow otherwise. Evidently\r\nthe proceedings of a spider which rushes out when its web is gently shaken\r\nand stays within when the shaking is violent, conduce better to the\r\nobtainment of food and the avoidance of danger than were they reversed. The\r\nfact that we feel surprise when, as in the case of a bird fascinated by a\r\nsnake, the conduct tends towards self-destruction, at once shows how\r\ngenerally we have observed an adaptation of living changes to changes in\r\nsurrounding circumstances.\r\n\r\nA kindred truth, rendered so familiar by infinite repetition that we forget\r\nits significance, must be named. There is invariably, and necessarily, a\r\nconformity between the vital functions of any organism and the conditions\r\nin which it is placed--between the processes going on inside of it and the\r\nprocesses going on outside of it. We know that a fish cannot live long in\r\nair, or a man under water. An oak growing in the ocean and a seaweed on the\r\ntop of a hill, are incredible combinations of ideas. We find that each kind\r\nof animal is limited to a certain range of climate; each kind of plant to\r\ncertain zones of latitude and elevation. Of the marine flora and fauna,\r\neach species is found only between such and such depths. Some blind\r\ncreatures flourish in dark caves; the limpet where it is alternately\r\ncovered and uncovered by the tide; the red-snow alga rarely elsewhere than\r\nin the arctic regions or among alpine peaks.\r\n\r\nGrouping together the cases first named, in which a particular change in\r\nthe circumstances of an organism is followed by a particular change in it,\r\nand the cases last named, in which the constant actions occurring within an\r\norganism imply some constant actions occurring without it; we see that in\r\nboth, the changes or processes displayed by a living body are specially\r\nrelated to the changes or processes in its environment. And here we have\r\nthe needful supplement to our conception of Life. Adding this all-important\r\ncharacteristic, our conception of Life becomes--The definite combination of\r\nheterogeneous changes, both simultaneous and successive, _in correspondence\r\nwith external co-existences and sequences_. That the full significance of\r\nthis addition may be seen, it will be necessary to glance at the\r\ncorrespondence under some of its leading aspects.[17]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 28. Neglecting minor requirements, the actions going on in a plant\r\npre-suppose a surrounding medium containing at least carbonic acid and\r\nwater, together with a due supply of light and a certain temperature.\r\nWithin the leaves carbon is being appropriated and oxygen given off;\r\nwithout them, is the gas from which the carbon is taken, and the\r\nimponderable agents that aid the abstraction. Be the nature of the process\r\nwhat it may, it is clear that there are external elements prone to undergo\r\nspecial re-arrangements under special conditions. It is clear that the\r\nplant in sunshine presents these conditions and so effects these\r\nre-arrangements. And thus it is clear that the changes which primarily\r\nconstitute the plant's life, are in correspondence with co-existences in\r\nits environment.\r\n\r\nIf, again, we ask respecting the lowest protozoon how it lives; the answer\r\nis, that while on the one hand its substance is undergoing disintegration,\r\nit is on the other hand absorbing nutriment; and that it may continue to\r\nexist, the one process must keep pace with, or exceed, the other. If\r\nfurther we ask under what circumstances these combined changes are\r\npossible, there is the reply that the medium in which the protozoon is\r\nplaced, must contain oxygen and food--oxygen in such quantity as to produce\r\nsome disintegration; food in such quantity as to permit that disintegration\r\nto be made good. In other words--the two antagonistic processes taking\r\nplace internally, imply the presence externally of materials having\r\naffinities that can give rise to them.\r\n\r\nLeaving those lowest animal forms which simply take in through their\r\nsurfaces the nutriment and oxygenated fluids coming in contact with them,\r\nwe pass to those somewhat higher forms which have their tissues slightly\r\nspecialized. In these we see a correspondence between certain actions in\r\nthe digestive sac, and the properties of certain surrounding bodies. That a\r\ncreature of this order may continue to live, it is necessary not only that\r\nthere be masses of substance in the environment capable of transformation\r\ninto its own tissue, but also that the introduction of these masses into\r\nits stomach, shall be followed by the secretion of a solvent fluid which\r\nwill reduce them to a fit state for absorption. Special outer properties\r\nmust be met by special inner properties.\r\n\r\nWhen, from the process by which food is digested, we turn to the process by\r\nwhich it is seized, the same general truth faces us. The stinging and\r\ncontractile power of a polype's tentacle, correspond to the sensitiveness\r\nand strength of the creatures serving it for prey. Unless that external\r\nchange which brings one of these creatures in contact with the tentacle,\r\nwere quickly followed by those internal changes which result in the coiling\r\nand drawing up of the tentacle, the polype would die of inanition. The\r\nfundamental processes of integration and disintegration within it, would\r\nget out of correspondence with the agencies and processes without it, and\r\nthe life would cease.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, when the creature becomes so large that its tissue cannot be\r\nefficiently supplied with nutriment by mere absorption through its lining\r\nmembrane, or duly oxygenated by contact with the fluid bathing its surface,\r\nthere arises a need for a distributing system by which nutriment and oxygen\r\nmay be carried throughout the mass; and the functions of this system, being\r\nsubsidiary to the two primary functions, form links in the correspondence\r\nbetween internal and external actions. The like is obviously true of all\r\nthose subordinate functions, secretory and excretory, that facilitate\r\noxidation and assimilation.\r\n\r\nAscending from visceral actions to muscular and nervous actions, we find\r\nthe correspondence displayed in a manner still more obvious. Every act of\r\nlocomotion implies the expenditure of certain internal forces, adapted in\r\namounts and directions to balance or out-balance certain external forces.\r\nThe recognition of an object is impossible without a harmony between the\r\nchanges constituting perception, and particular properties co-existing in\r\nthe environment. Escape from enemies implies motions within the organism,\r\nrelated in kind and rapidity to motions without it.  Destruction of prey\r\nrequires a special combination of subjective actions, fitted in degree and\r\nsuccession to overcome a group of objective ones. And so with those\r\ncountless automatic processes constituting instincts.\r\n\r\nIn the highest order of vital changes the same fact is equally manifest.\r\nThe empirical generalization that guides the farmer in his rotation of\r\ncrops, serves to bring his actions into concord with certain of the actions\r\ngoing on in plants and soil. The rational deductions of the educated\r\nnavigator who calculates his position at sea, form a series of mental acts\r\nby which his proceedings are conformed to surrounding circumstances. Alike\r\nin the simplest inferences of the child and the most complex ones of the\r\nman of science, we find a correspondence between simultaneous and\r\nsuccessive changes in the organism, and co-existences and sequences in its\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 29. This general formula which thus includes the lowest vegetal processes\r\nalong with the highest manifestations of human intelligence, will perhaps\r\ncall forth some criticisms which it is desirable here to meet.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought that there are still a few inorganic actions included in\r\nthe definition; as, for example, that displayed by the mis-named\r\nstorm-glass. The feathery crystallization which, on a certain change of\r\ntemperature, takes place in its contained solution, and which afterwards\r\ndissolves to reappear in new forms under new conditions, may be held to\r\npresent simultaneous and successive changes that are to some extent\r\nheterogeneous, that occur with some definiteness of combination, and, above\r\nall, occur in apparent correspondence with external changes. In this case\r\nvegetal life is simulated to a considerable extent; but it is _merely_\r\nsimulated. The relation between the phenomena occurring in the storm-glass\r\nand in the atmosphere respectively, is not a correspondence at all, in the\r\nproper sense of the word. Outside there is a thermal change; inside there\r\nis a change of atomic arrangement. Outside there is another thermal change;\r\ninside there is another change of atomic arrangement. But subtle as is the\r\ndependence of each internal upon each external change, the connexion\r\nbetween them does not, in the abstract, differ from the connexion between\r\nthe motion of a straw and the motion of the wind that disturbs it. In\r\neither case a change produces a change, and there it ends. The alteration\r\nwrought by some environing agency on this or any other inanimate object,\r\ndoes not tend to induce in it a secondary alteration which anticipates some\r\nsecondary alteration in the environment. But in every living body there is\r\na tendency towards secondary alterations of this nature; and it is in their\r\nproduction that the correspondence consists. The difference may be best\r\nexpressed by symbols. Let A be a change in the environment, and B some\r\nresulting change in an inorganic mass. Then A having produced B, the action\r\nceases. Though the change A in the environment is followed by some\r\nconsequent change _a_ in it; no parallel sequence in the inorganic mass\r\nsimultaneously generates in it some change _b_ that has reference to the\r\nchange _a_. But if we take a living body of the requisite organization, and\r\nlet the change A impress on it some change C; then, while in the\r\nenvironment A is occasioning _a_, in the living body C will be occasioning\r\n_c_; of which _a_ and _c_ will show a certain concord in time, place, or\r\nintensity. And while it is _in_ the continuous production of such concords\r\nor correspondences that Life consists, it is _by_ the continuous production\r\nof them that Life is maintained.\r\n\r\nThe further criticism to be expected concerns certain verbal imperfections\r\nin the definition, which it seems impossible to avoid. It may fairly be\r\nurged that the word _correspondence_ will not include, without straining,\r\nthe various relations to be expressed by it. It may be asked:--How can the\r\ncontinuous _processes_ of assimilation and respiration correspond with the\r\n_co-existence_ of food and oxygen in the environment? or again:--How can\r\nthe act of secreting some defensive fluid correspond with some external\r\ndanger which may never occur? or again:--How can the _dynamical_ phenomena\r\nconstituting perception correspond with the _statical_ phenomena of the\r\nsolid body perceived? The only reply is, that we have no word sufficiently\r\ngeneral to comprehend all forms of this relation between the organism and\r\nits medium, and yet sufficiently specific to convey an adequate idea of the\r\nrelation; and that the word _correspondence_ seems the least objectionable.\r\nThe fact to be expressed in all cases is that certain changes, continuous\r\nor discontinuous, in the organism, are connected after such a manner that\r\nin their amounts, or variations, or periods of occurrence, or modes of\r\nsuccession, they have a reference to external actions, constant or serial,\r\nactual or potential--a reference such that a definite relation among any\r\nmembers of the one group, implies a definite relation among certain members\r\nof the other group.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 30. The presentation of the phenomena under this general form, suggests\r\nthat our conception of Life may be reduced to its most abstract shape by\r\nregarding its elements as relations only. If a creature's rate of\r\nassimilation is increased in consequence of a decrease of temperature in\r\nthe environment, it is that the relation between the food consumed and the\r\nheat produced, is so re-adjusted by multiplying both its members, that the\r\naltered relation in the environment between the quantity of heat absorbed\r\nfrom, and radiated to, bodies of a given temperature, is counterbalanced.\r\nIf a sound or a scent wafted to it on the breeze prompts the stag to dart\r\naway from the deer-stalker, it is that there exists in its neighbourhood a\r\nrelation between a certain sensible property and certain actions dangerous\r\nto the stag, while in its body there exists an adapted relation between the\r\nimpression this sensible property produces, and the actions by which danger\r\nmay be escaped. If inquiry has led the chemist to a law, enabling him to\r\ntell how much of any one element will combine with so much of another, it\r\nis that there has been established in him specific mental relations, which\r\naccord with specific chemical relations in the things around. Seeing, then,\r\nthat in all cases we may consider the external phenomena as simply in\r\nrelation, and the internal phenomena also as simply in relation; our\r\nconception of Life under its most abstract aspect will be--_The continuous\r\nadjustment of internal relations to external relations_.[18]\r\n\r\nWhile it is simpler, this formula has the further advantage of being\r\nsomewhat more comprehensive. To say that it includes not only those\r\ndefinite combinations of simultaneous and successive changes in an\r\norganism, which correspond to co-existences and sequences in the\r\nenvironment, but also those structural arrangements which _enable_ the\r\norganism to adapt its actions to actions in the environment, is going too\r\nfar; for though these structural arrangements present internal relations\r\nadjusted to external relations, yet the _continuous adjustment_ of\r\nrelations cannot be held to include a _fixed adjustment_ already made.\r\nLife, which is made up of _dynamical_ phenomena, cannot be described in\r\nterms that shall at the same time describe the apparatus manifesting it,\r\nwhich presents only _statical_ phenomena. But while this antithesis serves\r\nto remind us that the distinction between the organism and its actions is\r\nas wide as that between Matter and Motion, it at the same time draws\r\nattention to the fact that, if the structural arrangements of the adult are\r\nnot properly included in the definition, yet the developmental processes by\r\nwhich those arrangements were established, are included. For that process\r\nof evolution during which the organs of the embryo are fitted to their\r\nprospective functions, is the gradual or continuous adjustment of internal\r\nrelations to external relations. Moreover, those structural modifications\r\nof the adult organism which, under change of climate, change of occupation,\r\nchange of food, bring about some re-arrangement in the organic balance, may\r\nsimilarly be regarded as progressive or continuous adjustments of internal\r\nrelations to external relations. So that not only does the definition, as\r\nthus expressed, comprehend all those activities, bodily and mental, which\r\nconstitute our ordinary idea of Life; but it also comprehends both those\r\nprocesses of development by which the organism is brought into general\r\nfitness for such activities, and those after-processes of adaptation by\r\nwhich it is specially fitted to its special activities.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, so abstract a formula as this is scarcely fitted for our\r\npresent purpose. Reserving it for use where specially appropriate, it will\r\nbe best commonly to employ its more concrete equivalent--to consider the\r\ninternal relations as \"definite combinations of simultaneous and successive\r\nchanges;\" the external relations as \"co-existences and sequences;\" and the\r\nconnexion between them as a \"correspondence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE DEGREE OF LIFE VARIES AS THE DEGREE OF CORRESPONDENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 31. Already it has been shown respecting each other component of the\r\nforegoing definition, that the life is high in proportion as that component\r\nis conspicuous; and it is now to be remarked, that the same thing is\r\nespecially true respecting this last component--the correspondence between\r\ninternal and external relations. It is manifest, _a priori_, that since\r\nchanges in the physical state of the environment, as also of those\r\nmechanical actions and those variations of available food which occur in\r\nit, are liable to stop the processes going on in the organism; and since\r\nthe adaptive changes in the organism have the effects of directly or\r\nindirectly counter-balancing these changes in the environment; it follows\r\nthat the life of the organism will be short or long, low or high, according\r\nto the extent to which changes in the environment are met by corresponding\r\nchanges in the organism. Allowing a margin for perturbations, the life will\r\ncontinue only while the correspondence continues; the completeness of the\r\nlife will be proportionate to the completeness of the correspondence; and\r\nthe life will be perfect only when the correspondence is perfect. Not to\r\ndwell in general statements, however, let us contemplate this truth under\r\nits concrete aspects.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 32. In life of the lowest order we find that only the most prevalent\r\nco-existences and sequences in the environment, have any simultaneous and\r\nsuccessive changes answering to them in the organism. A plant's vital\r\nprocesses display adjustment solely to the continuous co-existence of\r\ncertain elements and forces surrounding its roots and leaves; and vary only\r\nwith the variations produced in these elements and forces by the Sun--are\r\nunaffected by the countless mechanical movements and contacts occurring\r\naround; save when accidentally arrested by these. The life of a worm is\r\nmade up of actions referring to little else than the tangible properties of\r\nadjacent things. All those visible and audible changes which happen near\r\nit, and are connected with other changes that may presently destroy it,\r\npass unrecognized--produce in it no adapted changes: its only adjustment of\r\ninternal relations to external relations of this order, being seen when it\r\nescapes to the surface on feeling the vibrations produced by an approaching\r\nmole. Adjusted as are the proceedings of a bird to a far greater number of\r\nco-existences and sequences in the environment, cognizable by sight,\r\nhearing, scent, and their combinations: and numerous as are the dangers it\r\nshuns and the needs it fulfils in virtue of this extensive correspondence;\r\nit exhibits no such actions as those by which a human being counterbalances\r\nvariations in temperature and supply of food, consequent on the seasons.\r\nAnd when we see the plant eaten, the worm trodden on, the bird dead from\r\nstarvation; we see alike that the death is an arrest of such correspondence\r\nas existed, that it occurred when there was some change in the environment\r\nto which the organism made no answering change, and that thus, both in\r\nshortness and simplicity, the life was incomplete in proportion as the\r\ncorrespondence was incomplete. Progress towards more prolonged and higher\r\nlife, evidently implies ability to respond to less general co-existences\r\nand sequences. Each step upwards must consist in adding to the\r\npreviously-adjusted relations of actions or structures which the organism\r\nexhibits, some further relation parallel to a further relation in the\r\nenvironment. And the greater correspondence thus established, must, other\r\nthings equal, show itself both in greater complexity of life, and greater\r\nlength of life: a truth which will be fully perceived on remembering the\r\nenormous mortality which prevails among lowly-organized creatures, and the\r\ngradual increase of longevity and diminution of fertility which we meet\r\nwith on ascending to creatures of higher and higher developments.\r\n\r\nIt must be remarked, however, that while length and complexity of life are,\r\nto a great extent, associated--while a more extended correspondence in the\r\nsuccessive changes commonly implies increased correspondence in the\r\nsimultaneous changes; yet it is not uniformly so. Between the two great\r\ndivisions of life--animal and vegetal--this contrast by no means holds. A\r\ntree may live a thousand years, though the simultaneous changes going on in\r\nit answer only to the few chemical affinities in the air and the earth, and\r\nthough its serial changes answer only to those of day and night, of the\r\nweather and the seasons. A tortoise, which exhibits in a given time nothing\r\nlike the number of internal actions adjusted to external ones that are\r\nexhibited by a dog, yet lives far longer. The tree by its massive trunk and\r\nthe tortoise by its hard carapace, are saved the necessity of responding to\r\nthose many surrounding mechanical actions which organisms not thus\r\nprotected must respond to or die; or rather--the tree and the tortoise\r\ndisplay in their structures, certain simple statical relations adapted to\r\nmeet countless dynamical relations external to them. But notwithstanding\r\nthe qualifications suggested by such cases, it needs but to compare a\r\nmicroscopic fungus with an oak, an animalcule with a shark, a mouse with a\r\nman, to recognize the fact that this increasing correspondence of its\r\nchanges with those of the environment which characterizes progressing life,\r\nhabitually shows itself at the same time in continuity and in complication.\r\n\r\nEven were not the connexion between length of life and complexity of life\r\nthus conspicuous, it would still be true that the life is great in\r\nproportion as the correspondence is great. For if the lengthened existence\r\nof a tree be looked upon as tantamount to a considerable amount of life;\r\nthen it must be admitted that its lengthened display of correspondence is\r\ntantamount to a considerable amount of correspondence. If, otherwise, it be\r\nheld that notwithstanding its much shorter existence, a dog must rank above\r\na tortoise in degree of life because of its superior activity; then it is\r\nimplied that its life is higher because its simultaneous and successive\r\nchanges are more complex and more rapid--because the correspondence is\r\ngreater. And since we regard as the highest life that which, like our own,\r\nshows great complexity in the correspondences, great rapidity in the\r\nsuccession of them, and great length in the series of them; the equivalence\r\nbetween degree of life and degree of correspondence is unquestionable.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 33. In further elucidation of this general truth, and especially in\r\nexplanation of the irregularities just referred to, it must be pointed out\r\nthat as the life becomes higher the environment itself becomes more\r\ncomplex. Though, literally, the environment means all surrounding space\r\nwith the co-existences and sequences contained in it: yet, practically, it\r\noften means but a small part of this. The environment of an entozoon can\r\nscarcely be said to extend beyond the body of the animal in which the\r\nentozoon lives. That of a freshwater alga is virtually limited to the ditch\r\ninhabited by the alga. And, understanding the term in this restricted\r\nsense, we shall see that the superior organisms inhabit the more\r\ncomplicated environments.\r\n\r\nThus, contrasted with the life found on land, the lower life is that found\r\nin the sea; and it has the simpler environment. Marine creatures are\r\naffected by fewer co-existences and sequences than terrestrial ones. Being\r\nvery nearly of the same specific gravity as the surrounding medium, they\r\nhave to contend with less various mechanical actions. The sea-anemone fixed\r\nto a stone, and the acalephe borne along in the current, need to undergo no\r\ninternal changes such as those by which the caterpillar meets the varying\r\neffects of gravitation, while creeping over and under the leaves. Again,\r\nthe sea is liable to none of those extreme and rapid alterations of\r\ntemperature which the air suffers. Night and day produce no appreciable\r\nmodifications in it; and it is comparatively little affected by the\r\nseasons. Thus its contained fauna show no marked correspondences similar to\r\nthose by which air-breathing creatures counterbalance thermal changes.\r\nFurther, in respect to the supply of nutriment, the conditions are more\r\nsimple. The lower tribes of animals inhabiting the water, like the plants\r\ninhabiting the air, have their food brought to them. The same current which\r\nbrings oxygen to the oyster, also brings it the microscopic organisms on\r\nwhich it lives: the disintegrating matter and the matter to be integrated,\r\nco-exist under the simplest relation. It is otherwise with land animals.\r\nThe oxygen is everywhere, but the sustenance is not everywhere: it has to\r\nbe sought; and the conditions under which it is to be obtained are more or\r\nless complex. So too with that liquid by the agency of which the vital\r\nprocesses are carried on. To marine creatures water is ever present, and by\r\nthe lowest is passively absorbed; but to most creatures living on the earth\r\nand in the air, it is made available only through those nervous changes\r\nconstituting perception, and those muscular ones by which drinking is\r\neffected. Similarly, after tracing upwards from the _Amphibia_ the widening\r\nextent and complexity which the environment, as practically considered,\r\nassumes--after observing further how increasing heterogeneity in the flora\r\nand fauna of the globe, itself progressively complicates the environment of\r\neach species of organism--it might finally be shown that the same general\r\ntruth is displayed in the history of mankind, who, in the course of their\r\nprogress, have been adding to their physical environment a social\r\nenvironment that has been growing ever more involved. Thus, speaking\r\ngenerally, it is clear that those relations in the environment to which\r\nrelations in the organism must correspond, themselves increase in number\r\nand intricacy as the life assumes a higher form.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 34. To make yet more manifest the fact that the degree of life varies as\r\nthe degree of correspondence, let me here point out, that those other\r\ndistinctions successively noted when contrasting vital changes with\r\nnon-vital changes, are all implied in this last distinction--their\r\ncorrespondence with external co-existences and sequences; and further, that\r\nthe increasing fulfilment of those other distinctions which we found to\r\naccompany increasing life, is involved in the increasing fulfilment of this\r\nlast distinction. We saw that living organisms are characterized by\r\nsuccessive changes, and that as the life becomes higher, the successive\r\nchanges become more numerous. Well, the environment is full of successive\r\nchanges, and the greater the correspondence, the greater must be the number\r\nof successive changes in the organism. We saw that life presents\r\nsimultaneous changes, and that the more elevated it is, the more marked the\r\nmultiplicity of them. Well, besides countless co-existences in the\r\nenvironment, there are often many changes occurring in it at the same\r\nmoment; and hence increased correspondence with it implies in the organism\r\nan increased display of simultaneous changes. Similarly with the\r\nheterogeneity of the changes. In the environment the relations are very\r\nvaried in their kinds, and hence, as the organic actions come more and more\r\ninto correspondence with them, they too must become very varied in their\r\nkinds. So again is it even with definiteness of combination. As the most\r\nimportant surrounding changes with which each animal has to deal, are the\r\ndefinitely-combined changes exhibited by other animals, whether prey or\r\nenemies, it results that definiteness of combination must be a general\r\ncharacteristic of the internal ones which have to correspond with them. So\r\nthat throughout, the correspondence of the internal relations with the\r\nexternal ones is the essential thing; and all the special characteristics\r\nof the internal relations, are but the collateral results of this\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\n\r\n§§ 35, 36. Before closing the chapter, it will be useful to compare the\r\ndefinition of Life here set forth, with the definition of Evolution set\r\nforth in _First Principles_. Living bodies being bodies which display in\r\nthe highest degree the structural changes constituting Evolution; and Life\r\nbeing made up of the functional changes accompanying these structural\r\nchanges; we ought to find a certain harmony between the definitions of\r\nEvolution and of Life. Such a harmony is not wanting.\r\n\r\nThe first distinction we noted between the kind of change shown in Life,\r\nand other kinds of change, was its serial character. We saw that vital\r\nchange is substantially unlike non-vital change, in being made up of\r\n_successive_ changes. Now since organic bodies display so much more than\r\ninorganic bodies those continuous differentiations and integrations which\r\nconstitute Evolution; and since the re-distributions of matter thus carried\r\nso far in a comparatively short period, imply concomitant re-distributions\r\nof motion; it is clear that in a given time, organic bodies must undergo\r\nchanges so comparatively numerous as to render the successiveness of their\r\nchanges a marked characteristic. And it will follow _a priori_, as we found\r\nit to do _a posteriori_, that the organisms exhibiting Evolution in the\r\nhighest degree, exhibit the longest or the most rapid successions of\r\nchanges, or both. Again, it was shown that vital change is distinguished\r\nfrom non-vital change by being made up of many _simultaneous_ changes; and\r\nalso that creatures possessing high vitality are marked off from those\r\npossessing low vitality, by the far greater number of their simultaneous\r\nchanges. Here, too, there is entire congruity. In _First Principles_,\r\n§ 156, we reached the conclusion that a force falling on any aggregate is\r\ndivided into several forces; that when the aggregate consists of parts that\r\nare unlike, each part becomes a centre of unlike differentiations of the\r\nincident force; and that thus the multiplicity of such differentiations\r\nmust increase with the multiplicity of the unlike parts. Consequently\r\norganic aggregates, which as a class are distinguished from inorganic\r\naggregates by the greater number of their unlike parts, must be also\r\ndistinguished from them by the greater number of simultaneous changes they\r\ndisplay; and, further, that the higher organic aggregates, having more\r\nnumerous unlike parts than the lower, must undergo more numerous\r\nsimultaneous changes.  We next found that the changes occurring in living\r\nbodies are contrasted with those occurring in other bodies, as being much\r\nmore _heterogeneous_; and that the changes occurring in the superior living\r\nbodies are similarly contrasted with those occurring in inferior ones.\r\nWell, heterogeneity of function is the correlate of heterogeneity of\r\nstructure; and heterogeneity of structure is the leading distinction\r\nbetween organic and inorganic aggregates, as well as between the more\r\nhighly organized and the more lowly organized. By reaction, an incident\r\nforce must be rendered multiform in proportion to the multiformity of the\r\naggregate on which it falls; and hence those most multi-form aggregates\r\nwhich display in the highest degree the phenomena of Evolution structurally\r\nconsidered, must also display in the highest degree the multiform actions\r\nwhich constitute Evolution functionally considered.  These heterogeneous\r\nchanges, exhibited simultaneously and in succession by a living organism,\r\nprove, on further inquiry, to be distinguished by their _combination_ from\r\ncertain non-vital changes which simulate them. Here, too, the parallelism\r\nis maintained. It was shown in _First Principles_, Chap. XIV, that an\r\nessential characteristic of Evolution is the integration of parts, which\r\naccompanies their differentiation--an integration shown both in the\r\nconsolidation of each part, and in the union of all the parts into a whole.\r\nHence, animate bodies having greater co-ordination of parts than inanimate\r\nones must exhibit greater co-ordination of changes; and this greater\r\nco-ordination of their changes must not only distinguish organic from\r\ninorganic aggregates, but must, for the same reason, distinguish higher\r\norganisms from lower ones, as we found that it did.  Once more, it was\r\npointed out that the changes constituting Life differ from other changes in\r\nthe _definiteness_ of their combination, and that a distinction like in\r\nkind though less in degree, holds between the vital changes of superior\r\ncreatures and those of inferior creatures. These, also, are contrasts in\r\nharmony with the contrasts disclosed by the analysis of Evolution. We saw\r\n(_First Principles_, §§ 129-137) that during Evolution there is an increase\r\nof definiteness as well as an increase of heterogeneity. We saw that the\r\nintegration accompanying differentiation has necessarily the effect of\r\nincreasing the distinctness with which the parts are marked off from each\r\nother, and that so, out of the incoherent and indefinite there arises the\r\ncoherent and definite. But a coherent whole made up of definite parts\r\ndefinitely combined, must exhibit more definitely combined changes than a\r\nwhole made up of parts that are neither definite in themselves nor in their\r\ncombination. Hence, if living bodies display more than other bodies this\r\nstructural definiteness, then definiteness of combination must be a\r\ncharacteristic of the changes constituting Life, and must also distinguish\r\nthe vital changes of higher organisms from those of lower organisms.\r\nFinally, we discovered that all these peculiarities are subordinate to the\r\nfundamental peculiarity, that vital changes take place in correspondence\r\nwith external co-existences and sequences, and that the highest Life is\r\nreached, when there is some inner relation of actions fitted to meet every\r\nouter relation of actions by which the organism can be affected. But this\r\nconception of the highest Life, is in harmony with the conception, before\r\narrived at, of the limit of Evolution. When treating of equilibration as\r\nexhibited in organisms (_First Principles_, §§ 173, 174), it was pointed\r\nout that the tendency is towards the establishment of a balance between\r\ninner and outer changes. It was shown that \"the final structural\r\narrangements must be such as will meet all the forces acting on the\r\naggregate, by equivalent antagonistic forces,\" and that \"the maintenance of\r\nsuch a moving equilibrium\" as an organism displays, \"requires the habitual\r\ngenesis of internal forces corresponding in number, directions, and\r\namounts, to the external incident forces--as many inner functions, single\r\nor combined, as there are single or combined outer actions to be met.\" It\r\nwas shown, too, that the relations among ideas are ever in progress towards\r\na better adjustment between mental actions and those actions in the\r\nenvironment to which conduct must be adjusted. So that this continuous\r\ncorrespondence between inner and outer relations which constitutes Life,\r\nand the perfection of which is the perfection of Life, answers completely\r\nto that state of organic moving equilibrium which we saw arises in the\r\ncourse of Evolution and tends ever to become more complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI^A.\r\n\r\nTHE DYNAMIC ELEMENT IN LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 36a. A critical comparison of the foregoing formula with the facts proves\r\nit to be deficient in more ways than one. Let us first look at vital\r\nphenomena which are not covered by it.\r\n\r\nSome irritant left by an insect's ovipositor, sets up on a plant the morbid\r\ngrowth named a gall. The processes in the gall do not correspond with any\r\nexternal co-existences or sequences relevant to the plant's life--show no\r\ninternal relations adjusted to external relations. Yet we cannot deny that\r\nthe gall is alive. So, too, is it with a cancer in or upon an animal's\r\nbody. The actions going on in it have no reference, direct or indirect, to\r\nactions in the environment. Nevertheless we are obliged to say that they\r\nare vital; since it grows and after a time dies and decomposes.\r\n\r\nA kindred lesson meets us when from pathological evidence we turn to\r\nphysiological evidence. The functions of some important organs may still be\r\ncarried on for a time apart from those of the body as a whole. An excised\r\nliver, kept at a fit temperature and duly supplied with blood, secretes\r\nbile. Still more striking is the independent action of the heart. If\r\nbelonging to a cold-blooded animal, as a frog, the heart, when detached,\r\ncontinues to beat, even until its integuments have become so dry that they\r\ncrackle. Now though under such conditions its pulsations, which ordinarily\r\nform an essential part of the linked processes by which the correspondence\r\nbetween inner and outer actions is maintained, no longer form part of such\r\nprocesses, we must admit that the continuance of them implies a vital\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nEmbryological changes force the same truth upon us. What are we to say of\r\nthe repeated cell-fissions by which in some types a blastula, or\r\nmulberry-mass, is formed, and in other types a blastoderm? Neither these\r\nprocesses nor the structures immediately resulting from them, show any\r\ncorrespondences with co-existences and sequences in the environment; though\r\nthey are first steps towards the organization which is to carry on such\r\ncorrespondences. Even this extremely small fulfilment of the definition is\r\nabsent in the cases of rudimentary organs, and especially those rudimentary\r\norgans which after being partly formed are absorbed. No adjustment can be\r\nalleged between the inner relations which these present and any outer\r\nrelations. The outer relations they refer to ceased millions of years ago.\r\nYet unquestionably the changes which bring about the production and\r\nabsorption of these futile structures are vital changes.\r\n\r\nTake another class of exceptions. What are we to say of a laugh? No\r\ncorrespondence, or part of a correspondence, by which inner actions are\r\nmade to balance outer actions, can be seen in it. Or again, if, while\r\nworking, an artisan whistles, the making of the sounds and the\r\nco-ordination of ideas controlling them, cannot be said to exhibit\r\nadjustment between certain relations of thoughts, and certain relations of\r\nthings. Such kinds of vital activities lie wholly outside of the definition\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the clearest and simplest proof is yielded by contrasting\r\nvoluntary and involuntary muscular actions. Here is a hawk adapting its\r\nchanging motions to the changing motions of a pigeon, so as eventually to\r\nstrike it: the adjustment of inner relations to outer relations is\r\nmanifest. Here is a boy in an epileptic fit. Between his struggles and the\r\nco-existences and sequences around him there is no correspondence whatever.\r\nYet his movements betray vitality just as much as do the movements of the\r\nhawk. Both exhibit that principle of _activity_ which constitutes the\r\nessential element in our conception of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 36b. Evidently, then, the preceding chapters recognize only the _form_ of\r\nour conception of life and ignore the _body_ of it. Partly sufficing as\r\ndoes the definition reached to express the one, it fails entirely to\r\nexpress the other. Life displays itself in ways which conform to the\r\ndefinition; but it also displays itself in many other ways. We are obliged\r\nto admit that the element which is common to the two groups of ways is the\r\nessential element. The essential element, then, is that special kind of\r\nenergy seen alike in the usual classes of vital actions and in those\r\nunusual classes instanced above.\r\n\r\nOtherwise presenting the contrast, we may say that due attention has been\r\npaid to the connexions among the manifestations, while no attention has\r\nbeen paid to that which is manifested. When it is said that life is \"the\r\ndefinite correspondence of heterogeneous changes, both simultaneous and\r\nsuccessive, in correspondence with external co-existences and sequences,\"\r\nthere arises the question--Changes of what? Within the body there go on\r\nmany changes, mechanical, chemical, thermal, no one of which is the kind of\r\nchange in question; and if we combine in thought so far as we can these\r\nkinds of changes, in such wise that each maintains its character as\r\nmechanical, chemical, or thermal, we cannot get out of them the idea of\r\nLife. Still more clearly do we see this insufficiency when we take the more\r\nabstract definition--\"the continuous adjustment of internal relations to\r\nexternal relations.\" Relations between what things? is the question then to\r\nbe asked. A relation of which the terms are unspecified does not connote a\r\nthought but merely the blank form of a thought. Its value is comparable to\r\nthat of a cheque on which no amount is written. If it be said that the\r\nterms cannot be specified because so many heterogeneous kinds of them have\r\nto be included, then there comes the reply that under cover of this\r\ninability to make a specification of terms that shall be adequately\r\ncomprehensive, there is concealed the inability to conceive the required\r\nterms in any way.\r\n\r\nThus a critical testing of the definition brings us, in another way, to the\r\nconclusion reached above, that that which gives the substance to our idea\r\nof Life is a certain unspecified principle of activity. The dynamic element\r\nin life is its essential element.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 36c. Under what form are we to conceive this dynamic element? Is this\r\nprinciple of activity inherent in organic matter, or is it something\r\nsuperadded? Of these alternative suppositions let us begin with the last.\r\n\r\nAs I have remarked, in another place, the worth of an hypothesis may be\r\njudged from its genealogy; and so judged the hypothesis of an independent\r\nvital principal does not commend itself. Its history carries us back to the\r\nghost-theory of the savage. Suggested by experiences of dreams, there\r\narises belief in a double--a second self which wanders away during sleep\r\nand has adventures but comes back on waking; which deserts the body during\r\nabnormal insensibility of one or other kind; and which is absent for a long\r\nperiod at death, though even then is expected eventually to return. This\r\nindwelling other-self, which can leave the body at will, is by-and-by\r\nregarded as able to enter the bodies of fellow men or of animals; or again,\r\nby implication, as liable to have its place usurped by the intruding\r\ndoubles of fellow men, living or dead, which cause fits or other ills.\r\nAlong with these developments its quality changes. At first thought of as\r\nquite material it is gradually de-materialized, and in advanced times comes\r\nto be regarded as spirit or breath; as we see in ancient religious books,\r\nwhere \"giving up the ghost\" is shown by the emergence of a small floating\r\nfigure from the mouth of a dying man. This indwelling second self, more and\r\nmore conceived as the real self which uses the body for its purposes, is,\r\nwith the advance of intelligence, still further divested of its definite\r\ncharacters; and, coming in mediæval days to be spoken of as \"animal\r\nspirits,\" ends in later days in being called a vital principle.\r\n\r\nEntirely without assignable attributes, this something occurs in thought\r\nnot as an idea but as a pseud-idea (_First Principles_, Chap. II). It is\r\nassumed to be representable while really unrepresentable. We need only\r\ninsist on answers to certain questions to see that it is simply a name for\r\nan alleged existence which has not been conceived and cannot be conceived.\r\n\r\n1. Is there one kind of vital principle for all kinds of organisms, or is\r\nthere a separate kind for each? To affirm the first alternative is to say\r\nthat there is the same vital principle for a microbe as for a whale, for a\r\ntape-worm as for the person it inhabits, for a protococcus as for an oak;\r\nnay more--is to assert community of vital principle in the thinking man and\r\nthe unthinking plant. Moreover, asserting unity of the vital principle for\r\nall organisms, is reducing it to a force having the same unindividualized\r\ncharacter as one of the physical forces. If, on the other hand, different\r\nkinds of organisms have different kinds of vital principles, these must be\r\nin some way distinguished from one another. How distinguished? Manifestly\r\nby attributes. Do they differ in extension? Evidently; since otherwise that\r\nwhich animates the vast _Sequoia_ can be no larger than that which animates\r\na yeast-plant, and to carry on the life of an elephant requires a quantity\r\nof vital principle no greater than that required for a microscopic monad.\r\nDo they differ otherwise than in amount? Certainly; since otherwise we\r\nrevert to the preceding alternative, which implies that the same quality of\r\nvital principle serves for all organisms, simple and complex: the vital\r\nprinciple is a uniform force like heat or electricity. Hence, then, we have\r\nto suppose that every species of animal and plant has a vital principle\r\npeculiar to itself--a principle adapted to use the particular set of\r\nstructures in which it is contained. But dare anyone assert this\r\nmultiplication of vital principles, duplicating not only all existing\r\nplants and animals but all past ones, and amounting in the aggregate to\r\nsome millions?\r\n\r\n2. How are we to conceive that genesis of a vital principle which must go\r\nalong with the genesis of an organism? Here is a pollen-grain which,\r\nthrough the pistil, sends its nucleus to unite with the nucleus of the\r\novule; or here are the nuclei of spermatozoon and ovum, which, becoming\r\nfused, initiate a new animal: in either case failure of union being\r\nfollowed by decomposition of the proteid materials, while union is followed\r\nby development. Whence comes that vital principle which determines the\r\norganizing process? Is it created afresh for every plant and animal? or, if\r\nnot, where and how did it pre-exist? Take a simpler form of this problem. A\r\nprotophyte or protozoon, having grown to a certain size, undergoes a series\r\nof complex changes ending in fission. In its undivided state it had a vital\r\nprinciple. What of its divided state? The parts severally swim away, each\r\nfully alive, each ready to grow and presently to subdivide, and so on and\r\nso on, until millions are soon formed. That is to say, there is a\r\nmultiplication of vital principles as of the protozoa animated by them. A\r\nvital principle, then, both divides and grows. But growth implies\r\nincorporation of something. What does the vital principle incorporate? Is\r\nit some other vital principle external to it, or some materials out of\r\nwhich more vital principle is formed? And how, in either case, can the\r\nvital principle be conceived as other than a material something, which in\r\nits growth and multiplication behaves just as visible matter behaves?\r\n\r\n3. Equally unanswerable is the question which arises in presence of life\r\nthat has become latent. Passing over the alleged case of the mummy wheat,\r\nthe validity of which is denied, there is experimental proof that seeds\r\nmay, under conditions unfavourable to germination, retain for ten, twenty,\r\nand some even for thirty years, the power to germinate when due moisture\r\nand warmth are supplied. (_Cf._ Kerner's _Nat. Hist. of Plants_, i, 51-2).\r\nUnder what form has the vital principle existed during these long\r\nintervals? It is a principle of activity. In this case, then, the principle\r\nof activity becomes inactive. But how can we conceive an inactive activity?\r\nIf it is a something which though inactive may be rendered active when\r\nconditions favour, we are introduced to the idea of a vital principle of\r\nwhich the vitality may become latent, which is absurd. What shall we say of\r\nthe desiccated rotifer which for years has seemed to be nothing more than a\r\nparticle of dust, but which now, when water is supplied, absorbs it, swells\r\nup, and resumes those ciliary motions by which it draws in nutriment? Was\r\nthe vital principle elsewhere during these years of absolute quiescence? If\r\nso, why did it come back at the right moment? Was it all along present in\r\nthe rotifer though asleep? How happened it then to awaken at the time when\r\nthe supply of water enabled the tissues to resume their functions? How\r\nhappened the physical agent to act not only on the material substance of\r\nthe rotifer, but also on this something which is not a material substance\r\nbut an immaterial source of activity? Evidently neither alternative is\r\nthinkable.\r\n\r\nThus, the alleged vital principle exists in the minds of those who allege\r\nit only as a verbal form, not as an idea; since it is impossible to bring\r\ntogether in consciousness the terms required to constitute an idea. It is\r\nnot even \"a figment of imagination,\" for that implies something imaginable,\r\nbut the supposed vital principle cannot even be imagined.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 36d. When, passing to the alternative, we propose to regard life as\r\ninherent in the substances of the organisms displaying it, we meet with\r\ndifficulties different in kind but scarcely less in degree. The processes\r\nwhich go on in living things are incomprehensible as results of any\r\nphysical actions known to us.\r\n\r\nConsider one of the simplest--that presented by an ordinary vegetal cell\r\nforming part of a leaf or other plant-structure. Its limiting membrane,\r\noriginally made polyhedral by pressure of adjacent cells, is gradually\r\nmoulded \"into one of cylindrical, fibrous, or tabular shape, and\r\nstrengthening its walls with pilasters, borders, ridges, hooks, bands, and\r\npanels of various kinds\" (Kerner, i, 43): small openings into adjacent\r\ncells being either left or subsequently made. Consisting of\r\nnon-nitrogenous, inactive matters, these structures are formed by the\r\ninclosed protoplast. How formed? Is it by the agency of the nucleus? But\r\nthe nucleus, even had it characters conceivably adapting it to this\r\nfunction, is irregularly placed; and that it should work the same effects\r\nupon the cell-wall whether seated in the middle, at one end, or one side,\r\nis incomprehensible. Is the protoplasm then the active agent? But this is\r\narranged into a network of strands and threads utterly irregular in\r\ndistribution and perpetually altering their shapes and connexions. Exercise\r\nof fit directive action by the protoplasm is unimaginable.\r\n\r\nAnother instance:--Consider the reproductive changes exhibited by the\r\n_Spirogyra_. The delicate threads which, in this low type of Alga, are\r\nconstituted of single elongated cells joined end to end, are here and there\r\nadjacent to one another; and from a cell of one thread and a cell of\r\nanother at fit distance, grow out prominences which, meeting in the\r\ninterspace and forming a channel by the dissolution of their adjoined\r\ncell-walls, empty through it the endochrome of the one cell into the other:\r\nforming by fusion of the two a zygote or reproductive body. Under what\r\ninfluence is this action initiated and guided? There is no conceivable\r\ndirective agency in either cell by which, when conditions are fit, a\r\npapilla is so formed as to meet an opposite papilla.\r\n\r\nOr again, contemplate the still more marvellous transformation occurring in\r\n_Hydrodictyon utriculosum_. United with others to form a cylindrical\r\nnetwork, each sausage-shaped cell of this Alga contains, when fully\r\ndeveloped, a lining chromatophore made of nucleated protoplasm with\r\nimmersed chlorophyll-grains. This, when the cell is adult, divides into\r\nmultitudinous zoospores, which presently join their ends in such ways as to\r\nform a network with meshes mostly hexagonal, minute in size, but like in\r\narrangement to the network of which the parent cell formed a part.\r\nEventually escaping from the mother-cell, this network grows and presently\r\nbecomes as large as the parent network. Under what play of forces do these\r\nzoospores arrange themselves into this strange structure?\r\n\r\nKindred insoluble problems are presented by animal organisms of all grades.\r\nOf microscopic types instance the Coccospheres and Rhabdospheres found in\r\nthe upper strata of sea-water. Each is a fragment of protoplasm less than\r\none-thousandth of an inch in diameter, shielded by the elaborate protective\r\nstructures it has formed. The elliptic coccoliths of the first, severally\r\nhaving a definite pattern, unite to form by overlapping an imbricated\r\ncovering; and of the other the covering consists of numerous\r\ntrumpet-mouthed processes radiating on all sides. To the question--How does\r\nthis particle of granular protoplasm, without organs or definite structure,\r\nmake for itself this complicated calcareous armour? there is no conceivable\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nLike these _Protozoa_, the lowest _Metazoa_ do things which are quite\r\nincomprehensible. Here is a sponge formed of classes of monads having among\r\nthem no internuncial appliances by which in higher types cooperation is\r\ncarried on--flagellate cells that produce the permeating currents of water,\r\nflattened cells forming protective membranes, and amoeboid cells lying free\r\nin the gelatinous mesoderm. These, without apparent concert, build up not\r\nonly the horny network constituting the chief mass of their habitation, but\r\nalso embodied spicules, having remarkable symmetrical forms. By what\r\ncombined influences the needful processes are effected, it is impossible to\r\nimagine.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to higher types of _Metazoa_ in which, by the agency of a\r\nnervous system, many cooperations of parts are achieved in ways that are\r\nsuperficially comprehensible, we still meet with various actions of which\r\nthe causation cannot be represented in thought. Lacking other calcareous\r\nmatter, a hen picks up and swallows bits of broken egg-shells; and,\r\noccasionally, a cow in calf may be seen mumbling a bone she has\r\nfound--evidently scraping off with her teeth some of its mass. These\r\nproceedings have reference to constitutional needs; but how are they\r\nprompted? What generates in the cow a desire to bite a substance so unlike\r\nin character to her ordinary food? If it be replied that the blood has\r\nbecome poor in certain calcareous salts and that hence arises the appetite\r\nfor things containing them, there remains the question--How does this\r\ndeficiency so act on the nervous system as to generate this vague desire\r\nand cause the movements which satisfy it? By no effort can we figure to\r\nourselves the implied causal processes.\r\n\r\nIn brief, then, we are obliged to confess that Life in its essence cannot\r\nbe conceived in physico-chemical terms. The required principle of activity,\r\nwhich we found cannot be represented as an independent vital principle, we\r\nnow find cannot be represented as a principle inherent in living matter.\r\nIf, by assuming its inherence, we think the facts are accounted for, we do\r\nbut cheat ourselves with pseud-ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 36e. What then are we to say--what are we to think? Simply that in this\r\ndirection, as in all other directions, our explanations finally bring us\r\nface to face with the inexplicable. The Ultimate Reality behind this\r\nmanifestation, as behind all other manifestations, transcends conception.\r\nIt needs but to observe how even simple forms of existence are in their\r\nultimate natures incomprehensible, to see that this most complex form of\r\nexistence is in a sense doubly incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nFor the actions of that which the ignorant contemptuously call brute\r\nmatter, cannot in the last resort be understood in their genesis. Were it\r\nnot that familiarity blinds us, the fall of a stone would afford matter for\r\nwonder. Neither Newton nor anyone since his day has been able to conceive\r\nhow the molecules of matter in the stone are affected not only by the\r\nmolecules of matter in the adjacent part of the Earth but by those forming\r\nparts of its mass 8,000 miles off which severally exercise their influence\r\nwithout impediment from intervening molecules; and still less has there\r\nbeen any conceivable interpretation of the mode in which every molecule of\r\nmatter in the Sun, 92 millions of miles away, has a share in controlling\r\nthe movements of the Earth. What goes on in the space between a magnet and\r\nthe piece of iron drawn towards it, or how on repeatedly passing a magnet\r\nalong a steel needle this, by some change of molecular state as we must\r\nsuppose, becomes itself a magnet and when balanced places its poles in\r\nfixed directions, we do not know. And still less can we fathom the physical\r\nprocess by which an ordered series of electric pulses sent through a\r\ntelegraph wire may be made to excite a corresponding series of pulses in a\r\nparallel wire many miles off.\r\n\r\nTurn to another class of cases. Consider the action of a surface of glass\r\nstruck by a cathode current and which thereupon generates an order of rays\r\nable to pass through solid matters impermeable to light. Or contemplate the\r\npower possessed by uranium and other metals of emitting rays imperceptible\r\nby our eyes as light but which yet, in what appears to us absolute\r\ndarkness, will, if passed through a camera, produce photographs. Even the\r\nactions of one kind of matter on another are sufficiently remarkable. Here\r\nis a mass of gold which, after the addition of 1-500th part of bismuth, has\r\nonly 1-28th of the tensile strength it previously had; and here is a mass\r\nof brass, ordinarily ductile and malleable, but which, on the addition of\r\n1-10,000th part of antimony, loses its character. More remarkable still are\r\nthe influences of certain medicines. One-hundredth of a grain of\r\nnitro-glycerine is a sufficient dose. Taking an average man's weight as 150\r\npounds, it results that his body is appreciably affected in its state by\r\nthe 115-millionth part of its weight of this nitrogenous compound.\r\n\r\nIn presence of such powers displayed by matter of simple kinds we shall see\r\nhow impossible it is even to imagine those processes going on in organic\r\nmatter out of which emerges the dynamic element in Life. As no separate\r\nform of proteid possesses vitality, we seem obliged to assume that the\r\nmolecule of protoplasm contains many molecules of proteids, probably in\r\nvarious isomeric states, all capable of ready change and therefore\r\nproducing great instability of the aggregate they form. As before pointed\r\nout (§ 4), a proteid-molecule includes more than 220 equivalents of several\r\nso-called elements. Each of these undecomposed substances is now recognized\r\nby chemists as almost certainly consisting of several kinds of components.\r\nHence the implication is that a proteid-molecule contains thousands of\r\nunits, of which the different classes have their respective rates of\r\ninconceivably rapid oscillation, while each unit, receiving and emitting\r\nethereal undulations, affects others of its kind in its own and adjacent\r\nmolecules: an immensely complex structure having immensely complex\r\nactivities. And this complexity, material and dynamic, in the\r\nproteid-molecule we must regard as raised to a far higher degree in the\r\nunit of protoplasm. Here as elsewhere alternative impossibilities of\r\nthought present themselves. We find it impossible to think of Life as\r\nimported into the unit of protoplasm from without; and yet we find it\r\nimpossible to conceive it as emerging from the cooperation of the\r\ncomponents.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 36f. But now, having confessed that Life as a principle of activity is\r\nunknown and unknowable--that while its phenomena are accessible to thought\r\nthe implied noumenon is inaccessible--that only the manifestations come\r\nwithin the range of our intelligence while that which is manifested lies\r\nbeyond it; we may resume the conclusions reached in the preceding chapters.\r\nOur surface knowledge continues to be a knowledge valid of its kind, after\r\nrecognizing the truth that it is only a surface knowledge.\r\n\r\nFor the conclusions we lately reached and the definition emerging from\r\nthem, concern the _order_ existing among the actions which living things\r\nexhibit; and this order remains the same whether we know or do not know the\r\nnature of that from which the actions originate. We found a distinguishing\r\ntrait of Life to be that its changes display a correspondence with\r\nco-existences and sequences in the environment; and this remains a\r\ndistinguishing trait, though the thing which changes remains inscrutable.\r\nThe statement that the continuous adjustment of internal relations to\r\nexternal relations constitutes Life as cognizable by us, is not invalidated\r\nby the admission that the reality in which these relations inhere is\r\nincognizable.\r\n\r\nHence, then, after duly recognizing the fact that, as pointed out above,\r\nLife, even phenomenally considered, is not entirely covered by the\r\ndefinition, since there are various abnormal manifestations of life which\r\nit does not include, we may safely accept it as covering the normal\r\nmanifestations--those manifestations which here concern us. Carrying with\r\nus the definition, therefore we may hereafter use it for guidance through\r\nall those regions of inquiry upon which we now enter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE SCOPE OF BIOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 37. As ordinarily conceived, the science of Biology falls into two great\r\ndivisions, the one dealing with animal life, called Zoology, and the other\r\ndealing with vegetal life, called Botany, or more properly to be called\r\nPhytology. But convenient as is this division, it is not that which arises\r\nif we follow the scientific method of including in one group all the\r\nphenomena of fundamentally the same order and putting separately in another\r\ngroup all the phenomena of a fundamentally different order. For animals and\r\nplants are alike in having structures; and animals and plants are alike in\r\nhaving functions performed by these structures; and the distinction between\r\nstructures and functions transcends the difference between any one\r\nstructure and any other or between any one function and any other--is,\r\nindeed, an absolute distinction, like that between Matter and Motion.\r\nRecognizing, then, the logic of the division thus indicated, we must group\r\nthe parts of Biology thus:--\r\n\r\n1.  An account of the structural phenomena presented by organisms. This\r\nsubdivides into:--\r\n\r\n  _a._ The established structural phenomena presented by individual\r\n  organisms.\r\n\r\n  _b._ The changing structural phenomena presented by successions of\r\n  organisms.\r\n\r\n2.  An account of the functional phenomena which organisms present. This,\r\ntoo, admits of subdivision into:--\r\n\r\n  _a._  The established functional phenomena of individual organisms.\r\n\r\n  _b._  The changing functional phenomena of successions of organisms.\r\n\r\n3. An account of the actions of Structures on Functions and the re-actions\r\nof Functions on Structures. Like the others, this is divisible into:--\r\n\r\n  _a._  The actions and re-actions as exhibited in individual organisms.\r\n\r\n  _b._  The actions and re-actions as exhibited in successions of\r\n  organisms.\r\n\r\n4. An account of the phenomena attending the production of successions of\r\norganisms: in other words--the phenomena of Genesis.\r\n\r\nOf course, for purposes of exploration and teaching, the division into\r\nZoology and Botany, founded on contrasts so marked and numerous, must\r\nalways be retained. But here recognizing this familiar distinction only as\r\nmuch as convenience obliges us to do, let us now pass on to consider, more\r\nin detail, the classification of biologic phenomena above set down in its\r\nleading outlines.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 38. The facts of structure shown in an individual organism, are of two\r\nchief kinds. In order of conspicuousness, though not in order of time,\r\nthere come first those arrangements of parts which characterize the mature\r\norganism; an account of which, originally called Anatomy, is now called\r\nMorphology. Then come those successive modifications through which the\r\norganism passes in its progress from the germ to the developed form; an\r\naccount of which is called Embryology.\r\n\r\nThe structural changes which any series of individual organisms exhibits,\r\nadmit of similar classification. On the one hand, we have those inner and\r\nouter differences of shape, that arise between the adult members of\r\nsuccessive generations descended from a common stock--differences which,\r\nthough usually not marked between adjacent generations, become great in\r\ncourse of multitudinous generations. On the other hand, we have those\r\ndevelopmental modifications, seen in the embryos, through which such\r\nmodifications of the descended forms are reached.\r\n\r\nInterpretation of the structures of individual organisms and successions of\r\norganisms, is aided by two subsidiary divisions of biologic inquiry, named\r\nComparative Anatomy (properly Comparative Morphology) and Comparative\r\nEmbryology. These cannot be regarded as in themselves parts of Biology;\r\nsince the facts embraced under them are not substantive phenomena, but are\r\nsimply incidental to substantive phenomena. All the truths of structural\r\nBiology are comprehended under the two foregoing subdivisions; and the\r\ncomparison of these truths as presented in different classes of organisms,\r\nis simply a _method_ of interpreting them.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, though Comparative Morphology and Comparative Embryology do\r\nnot disclose additional concrete facts, they lead to the establishment of\r\ncertain abstract facts. By them it is made manifest that underneath the\r\nsuperficial differences of groups and classes and types of organisms, there\r\nare hidden fundamental similarities; and that the courses of development in\r\nsuch groups and classes and types, though in many respects divergent, are\r\nin some essential respects, coincident. The wide truths thus disclosed,\r\ncome under the heads of General Morphology and General Embryology.\r\n\r\nBy contrasting organisms there is also achieved that grouping of the like\r\nand separation of the unlike, called Classification. First by observation\r\nof external characters; second by observation of internal characters; and\r\nthird by observation of the phases of development; it is ascertained what\r\norganisms are most similar in all respects; what organisms otherwise unlike\r\nare like in important traits; what organisms though apparently unallied\r\nhave common primordial characters.  Whence there results such an\r\narrangement of organisms, that if certain structural attributes of any one\r\nbe given, its other structural attributes may be _empirically_ predicted;\r\nand which prepares the way for that interpretation of their relations and\r\ngenesis, which forms an important part of _rational_ Biology.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 39. The second main division of Biology, above described as embracing the\r\nfunctional phenomena of organisms, is that which is in part signified by\r\nPhysiology: the remainder being distinguishable as Objective Psychology.\r\nBoth of these fall into subdivisions that may best be treated separately.\r\n\r\nThat part of Physiology which is concerned with the molecular changes going\r\non in organisms, is known as Organic Chemistry. An account of the modes in\r\nwhich the force generated in organisms by chemical change, is transformed\r\ninto other forces, and made to work the various organs that carry on the\r\nfunctions of Life, comes under the head of Organic Physics.  Psychology,\r\nwhich is mainly concerned with the adjustment of vital actions to actions\r\nin the environment (in contrast with Physiology, which is mainly concerned\r\nwith vital actions apart from actions in the environment) consists of two\r\nquite distinct portions. Objective Psychology deals with those functions of\r\nthe nervo-muscular apparatus by which such organisms as possess it are\r\nenabled to adjust inner to outer relations; and includes also the study of\r\nthe same functions as externally manifested in conduct. Subjective\r\nPsychology deals with the sensations, perceptions, ideas, emotions, and\r\nvolitions that are the direct or indirect concomitants of this visible\r\nadjustment of inner to outer relations. Consciousness under its different\r\nmodes and forms, being a subject-matter radically distinct in nature from\r\nthe subject-matter of Biology in general; and the method of self-analysis,\r\nby which alone the laws of dependence among changes of consciousness can be\r\nfound, being a method unparalleled by anything in the rest of Biology; we\r\nare obliged to regard Subjective Psychology as a separate study. And since\r\nit would be very inconvenient wholly to dissociate Objective Psychology\r\nfrom Subjective Psychology, we are practically compelled to deal with the\r\ntwo as forming an independent science.\r\n\r\nObviously, the functional phenomena presented in successions of organisms,\r\nsimilarly divide into physiological and psychological.  Under the\r\nphysiological come the modifications of bodily actions that arise in the\r\ncourse of generations, as concomitants of structural modifications; and\r\nthese may be modifications, qualitative or quantitative, in the molecular\r\nchanges classed as chemical, or in the organic actions classed as physical,\r\nor in both.  Under the psychological come the qualitative and quantitative\r\nmodifications of instincts, feelings, conceptions, and mental processes in\r\ngeneral, which occur in creatures having more or less intelligence, when\r\ncertain of their conditions are changed. This, like the preceding\r\ndepartment of Psychology, has in the abstract two different aspects--the\r\nobjective and the subjective. Practically, however, the objective, which\r\ndeals with these mental modifications as exhibited in the changing habits\r\nand abilities of successive generations of creatures, is the only one\r\nadmitting of investigation; since the corresponding alterations in\r\nconsciousness cannot be immediately known to any but the subjects of them.\r\nEvidently, convenience requires us to join this part of Psychology along\r\nwith the other parts as components of a distinct sub-science.\r\n\r\nLight is thrown on functions, as well as on structures, by comparing\r\norganisms of different kinds. Comparative Physiology and Comparative\r\nPsychology, are the names given to those collections of facts respecting\r\nthe homologies and analogies, bodily and mental, disclosed by this kind of\r\ninquiry. These classified observations concerning likenesses and\r\ndifferences of functions, are helpers to interpret functions in their\r\nessential natures and relations. Hence Comparative Physiology and\r\nComparative Psychology are names of methods rather than names of true\r\nsubdivisions of Biology.\r\n\r\nHere, however, as before, comparison of special truths, besides\r\nfacilitating their interpretation, brings to light certain general truths.\r\nContrasting functions bodily and mental as exhibited in various kinds of\r\norganisms, shows that there exists, more or less extensively, a community\r\nof processes and methods. Hence result two groups of propositions\r\nconstituting General Physiology and General Psychology.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 40. In these divisions and subdivisions of the first two great\r\ndepartments of Biology, facts of Structure are considered separately from\r\nfacts of Function, so far as separate treatment of them is possible. The\r\nthird great department of Biology deals with them in their necessary\r\nconnexions. It comprehends the determination of functions by structures,\r\nand the determination of structures by functions.\r\n\r\nAs displayed in individual organisms, the effects of structures on\r\nfunctions are to be studied, not only in the broad fact that the general\r\nkind of life an organism leads is necessitated by the main characters of\r\nits organization, but in the more special and less conspicuous fact, that\r\nbetween members of the same species, minor differences of structure lead to\r\nminor differences of power to perform certain actions, and of tendencies to\r\nperform such actions. Conversely, under the reactions of functions on\r\nstructures in individual organisms, come the facts showing that functions,\r\nwhen fulfilled to their normal extents, maintain integrity of structure in\r\ntheir respective organs; and that within certain limits increases of\r\nfunctions are followed by such structural changes in their respective\r\norgans, as enable them to discharge better their extra functions.\r\n\r\nInquiry into the influence of structure on function as seen in successions\r\nof organisms, introduces us to such phenomena as Mr. Darwin's _Origin of\r\nSpecies_ deals with. In this category come all proofs of the general truth,\r\nthat when an individual is enabled by a certain structural peculiarity to\r\nperform better than others of its species some advantageous action; and\r\nwhen it bequeaths more or less of its structural peculiarity to\r\ndescendants, among whom those which have it most markedly are best able to\r\nthrive and propagate; there arises a visibly modified type of structure,\r\nhaving a more or less distinct function.  In the correlative class of facts\r\n(by some asserted and by others denied), which come under the category of\r\nreactions of function on structure as exhibited in successions of\r\norganisms, are to be placed all those modifications of structure which\r\narise in races, when changes of conditions entail changes in the balance of\r\ntheir functions--when altered function externally necessitated, produces\r\naltered structure, and continues doing this through successive generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 41. The fourth great division of Biology, comprehending the phenomena of\r\nGenesis, may be conveniently separated into three subdivisions.\r\n\r\nUnder the first, comes a description of all the special modes whereby the\r\nmultiplication of organisms is carried on; which modes range themselves\r\nunder the two chief heads of sexual and asexual. An account of Sexual\r\nMultiplication includes the various processes by which germs and ova are\r\nfertilized, and by which, after fertilization, they are furnished with the\r\nmaterials, and maintained in the conditions, needful for their development.\r\nAn account of Asexual Multiplication includes the various processes by\r\nwhich, from the same fertilized germ or ovum, there are produced many\r\norganisms partially or totally independent of one another.\r\n\r\nThe second of these subdivisions deals with the phenomena of Genesis in the\r\nabstract. It takes for its subject-matter such general questions as--What\r\nis the end subserved by the union of sperm-cell and germ-cell? Why cannot\r\nall multiplication be carried on after the asexual method? What are the\r\nlaws of hereditary transmission? What are the causes of variation?\r\n\r\nThe third subdivision is devoted to still more abstract aspects of the\r\nsubject. Recognizing the general facts of multiplication, without reference\r\nto their modes or immediate causes, it concerns itself simply with the\r\ndifferent rates of multiplication in different kinds of organisms and\r\ndifferent individuals of the same kind. Generalizing the numerous contrasts\r\nand variations of fertility, it seeks a rationale of them in their\r\nrelations to other organic phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 42. Such appears to be the natural arrangement of divisions and\r\nsubdivisions which Biology presents. It is, however, a classification of\r\nthe parts of the science when fully developed; rather than a classification\r\nof them as they now stand. Some of the subdivisions above named have no\r\nrecognized existence, and some of the others are in quite rudimentary\r\nstates. It is impossible now to fill in, even in the roughest way, more\r\nthan a part of the outlines here sketched.\r\n\r\nOur course of inquiry being thus in great measure determined by the present\r\nstate of knowledge, we are compelled to follow an order widely different\r\nfrom this ideal one. It will be necessary first to give an account of those\r\nempirical generalizations which naturalists and physiologists have\r\nestablished: appending to those which admit of it, such deductive\r\ninterpretations as _First Principles_ furnishes us with. Having done this,\r\nwe shall be the better prepared for dealing with the leading truths of\r\nBiology in connexion with the doctrine of Evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nTHE INDUCTIONS OF BIOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nGROWTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 43. Perhaps the widest and most familiar induction of Biology, is that\r\norganisms grow. While, however, this is a characteristic so uniformly and\r\nmarkedly displayed by plants and animals, as to be carelessly thought\r\npeculiar to them, it is really not so. Under appropriate conditions,\r\nincrease of size takes place in inorganic aggregates, as well as in organic\r\naggregates. Crystals grow; and often far more rapidly than living bodies.\r\nWhere the requisite materials are supplied in the requisite forms, growth\r\nmay be witnessed in non-crystalline masses: instance the fungous-like\r\naccumulation of carbon that takes place on the wick of an unsnuffed candle.\r\nOn an immensely larger scale, we have growth in geologic formations: the\r\nslow accumulation of deposited sediment into a stratum, is not\r\ndistinguishable from growth in its widest acceptation. And if we go back to\r\nthe genesis of celestial bodies, assuming them to have arisen by Evolution,\r\nthese, too, must have gradually passed into their concrete shapes through\r\nprocesses of growth. Growth is, indeed, as being an integration of matter,\r\nthe primary trait of Evolution; and if Evolution of one kind or other is\r\nuniversal, growth is universal--universal, that is, in the sense that all\r\naggregates display it in some way at some period.\r\n\r\nThe essential community of nature between organic growth and inorganic\r\ngrowth, is, however, most clearly seen on observing that they both result\r\nin the same way. The segregation of different kinds of detritus from each\r\nother, as well as from the water carrying them, and their aggregation into\r\ndistinct strata, is but an instance of a universal tendency towards the\r\nunion of like units and the parting of unlike units (_First Principles_,\r\n§ 163). The deposit of a crystal from a solution is a differentiation of\r\nthe previously mixed molecules; and an integration of one class of\r\nmolecules into a solid body, and the other class into a liquid solvent. Is\r\nnot the growth of an organism an essentially similar process? Around a\r\nplant there exist certain elements like the elements which form its\r\nsubstance; and its increase of size is effected by continually integrating\r\nthese surrounding like elements with itself. Nor does the animal\r\nfundamentally differ in this respect from the plant or the crystal. Its\r\nfood is a portion of the environing matter that contains some compound\r\natoms like some of the compound atoms constituting its tissues; and either\r\nthrough simple imbibition or through digestion, the animal eventually\r\nintegrates with itself, units like those of which it is built up, and\r\nleaves behind the unlike units. To prevent misconception, it may be well to\r\npoint out that growth, as here defined, must be distinguished from certain\r\napparent and real augmentations of bulk which simulate it. Thus, the long,\r\nwhite potato-shoots thrown out in the dark, are produced at the expense of\r\nthe substances which the tuber contains: they illustrate not the\r\naccumulation of organic matter, but simply its re-composition and\r\nre-arrangement. Certain animal-embryos, again, during their early stages,\r\nincrease considerably in size without assimilating any solids from the\r\nenvironment; and they do this by absorbing the surrounding water. Even in\r\nthe highest organisms, as in children, there appears sometimes to occur a\r\nrapid gain in dimensions which does not truly measure the added quantity of\r\norganic matter; but is in part due to changes analogous to those just\r\nnamed. Alterations of this kind must not be confounded with that growth,\r\nproperly so called, of which we have here to treat.\r\n\r\nThe next general fact to be noted respecting organic growth, is, that it\r\nhas limits. Here there appears to be a distinction between organic and\r\ninorganic growth; but this distinction is by no means definite. Though that\r\naggregation of inanimate matter which simple attraction produces, may go on\r\nwithout end; yet there appears to be an end to that more definite kind of\r\naggregation which results from polar attraction. Different elements and\r\ncompounds habitually form crystals more or less unlike in their sizes; and\r\neach seems to have a size that is not usually exceeded without a tendency\r\narising to form new crystals rather than to increase the old.  On looking\r\nat the organic kingdom as a whole, we see that the limits between which\r\ngrowth ranges are very wide apart. At the one extreme we have monads so\r\nminute as to be rendered but imperfectly visible by microscopes of the\r\nhighest power; and at the other extreme we have trees of 400 to 500 feet\r\nhigh and animals of 100 feet long. It is true that though in one sense this\r\ncontrast may be legitimately drawn, yet in another sense it may not; since\r\nthese largest organisms arise by the combination of units which are\r\nindividually like the smallest. A single plant of the genus _Protococcus_,\r\nis of the same essential structure as one of the many cells united to form\r\nthe thallus of some higher Alga, or the leaf of a phænogam. Each separate\r\nshoot of a phænogam is usually the bearer of many leaves. And a tree is an\r\nassemblage of numerous united shoots. One of these great teleophytes is\r\nthus an aggregate of aggregates of aggregates of units, which severally\r\nresemble protophytes in their sizes and structures; and a like building up\r\nis traceable throughout a considerable part of the animal kingdom. Even,\r\nhowever, when we bear in mind this qualification, and make our comparisons\r\nbetween organisms of the same degree of composition, we still find the\r\nlimit of growth to have a great range. The smallest branched flowering\r\nplant is extremely insignificant by the side of a forest tree; and there is\r\nan enormous difference in bulk between the least and the greatest mammal.\r\nBut on comparing members of the same species, we discover the limit of\r\ngrowth to be much less variable. Among the _Protozoa_ and _Protophyta_,\r\neach kind has a tolerably constant adult size; and among the most complex\r\norganisms the differences between those of the same kind which have reached\r\nmaturity, are usually not very great. The compound plants do, indeed,\r\nsometimes present marked contrasts between stunted and well-grown\r\nindividuals; but the higher animals diverge but inconsiderably from the\r\naverage standards of their species.\r\n\r\nOn surveying the facts with a view of empirically generalizing the causes\r\nof these differences, we are soon made aware that by variously combining\r\nand conflicting with one another, these causes produce great irregularities\r\nof result. It becomes manifest that no one of them can be traced to its\r\nconsequences, unqualified by the rest. Hence the several statements\r\ncontained in the following paragraphs must be taken as subject to mutual\r\nmodification.\r\n\r\nLet us consider first the connexion between degree of growth and complexity\r\nof structure. This connexion, being involved with many others, becomes\r\napparent only on so averaging the comparisons as to eliminate differences\r\namong the rest. Nor does it hold at all where the conditions are radically\r\ndissimilar, as between plants and animals. But bearing in mind these\r\nqualifications, we shall see that organization has a determining influence\r\non increase of mass. Of plants the lowest, classed as Thallophytes, usually\r\nattain no considerable size. Algæ, Fungi, and the Lichens formed by\r\nassociation of them count among their numbers but few bulky species: the\r\nlargest, such as certain Algæ found in antarctic seas, not serving greatly\r\nto raise the average; and these gigantic seaweeds possess a considerable\r\ncomplexity of histological organization very markedly exceeding that of\r\ntheir smaller allies. Though among Bryophytes and Pteridophytes there are\r\nsome, as the Tree-ferns, which attain a considerable height, the majority\r\nare but of humble growth. The Monocotyledons, including at one extreme\r\nsmall grasses and at the other tall palms, show us an average and a maximum\r\ngreater than that reached by the Pteridophytes. And the Monocotyledons are\r\nexceeded by the Dicotyledons; among which are found the monarchs of the\r\nvegetal kingdom. Passing to animals, we meet the fact that the size\r\nattained by _Vertebrata_ is usually much greater than the size attained by\r\n_Invertebrata_. Of invertebrate animals the smallest, classed as\r\n_Protozoa_, are also the simplest; and the largest, belonging to the\r\n_Annulosa_ and _Mollusca_, are among the most complex of their respective\r\ntypes. Of vertebrate animals we see that the greatest are Mammals, and that\r\nthough, in past epochs, there were Reptiles of vast bulks, their bulks did\r\nnot equal that of the whale: the great Dinosaurs, though as long, being\r\nnothing like as massive. Between reptiles and birds, and between\r\nland-vertebrates and water-vertebrates, the relation does not hold: the\r\nconditions of existence being in these cases widely different. But among\r\nfishes as a class, and among reptiles as a class, it is observable that,\r\nspeaking generally, the larger species are framed on the higher types.  The\r\ncritical reader, who has mentally checked these statements in passing them,\r\nhas doubtless already seen that this relation is not a dependence of\r\norganization on growth but a dependence of growth on organization. The\r\nmajority of Dicotyledons are smaller than some Monocotyledons; many\r\nMonocotyledons are exceeded in size by certain Pteridophytes; and even\r\namong Thallophytes, the least developed among compound plants, there are\r\nkinds of a size which many plants of the highest order do not reach.\r\nSimilarly among animals. There are plenty of Crustaceans less than\r\n_Actiniæ_; numerous reptiles are smaller than some fish; the majority of\r\nmammals are inferior in bulk to the largest reptiles; and in the contrast\r\nbetween a mouse and a well-grown _Medusa_, we see a creature that is\r\nelevated in type of structure exceeded in mass by one that is extremely\r\nlow. Clearly then, it cannot be held that high organization is habitually\r\naccompanied by great size. The proposition here illustrated is the converse\r\none, that great size is habitually accompanied by high organization. The\r\nconspicuous facts that the largest species of both animals and vegetals\r\nbelong to the highest classes, and that throughout their various\r\nsub-classes the higher usually contain the more bulky forms, show this\r\nconnexion as clearly as we can expect it to be shown, amid so many\r\nmodifying causes and conditions.\r\n\r\nThe relation between growth and supply of available nutriment, is too\r\nfamiliar a relation to need proving. There are, however, some aspects of it\r\nthat must be contemplated before its implications can be fully appreciated.\r\nAmong plants, which are all constantly in contact with the gaseous, liquid,\r\nand solid matters to be incorporated with their tissues, and which, in the\r\nsame locality, receive not very unlike amounts of light and heat,\r\ndifferences in the supplies of available nutriment have but a subordinate\r\nconnexion with differences of growth. Though in a cluster of herbs\r\nspringing up from the seeds let fall by a parent, the greater sizes of some\r\nthan of others is doubtless due to better nutrition, consequent on\r\naccidental advantages; yet no such interpretation can be given of the\r\ncontrast in size between these herbs and an adjacent tree. Other conditions\r\nhere come into play: one of the most important being, an absence in the one\r\ncase, and presence in the other, of an ability to secrete such a quantity\r\nof ligneous fibre as will produce a stem capable of supporting a large\r\ngrowth. Among animals, however, which (excepting some _Entozoa_) differ\r\nfrom plants in this, that instead of bathing their surfaces the matters\r\nthey subsist on are dispersed, and have to be obtained, the relation\r\nbetween available food and growth is shown with more regularity. The\r\n_Protozoa_, living on microscopic fragments of organic matter contained in\r\nthe surrounding water, are unable, during their brief lives, to accumulate\r\nany considerable quantity of nutriment. _Polyzoa_, having for food these\r\nscarcely visible members of the animal kingdom, are, though large compared\r\nwith their prey, small as measured by other standards; even when aggregated\r\ninto groups of many individuals, which severally catch food for the common\r\nweal, they are often so inconspicuous as readily to be passed over by the\r\nunobservant. And if from this point upwards we survey the successive grades\r\nof animals, it becomes manifest that, in proportion as the size is great,\r\nthe masses of nutriment are either large, or, what is practically the same\r\nthing, are so abundant and so grouped that large quantities may be readily\r\ntaken in. Though, for example, the greatest of mammals, the arctic whale,\r\nfeeds on such comparatively small creatures as the acalephes and molluscs\r\nfloating in the seas it inhabits, its method of gulping in whole shoals of\r\nthem and filtering away the accompanying water, enables it to secure great\r\nquantities of food. We may then with safety say that, other things equal,\r\nthe growth of an animal depends on the abundance and sizes of the masses of\r\nnutriment which its powers enable it to appropriate. Perhaps it may be\r\nneedful to add that, in interpreting this statement, the proportion of\r\ncompetitors must be taken into account. Clearly, not the absolute, but the\r\nrelative, abundance of fit food is the point; and this relative abundance\r\nvery much depends on the number of individuals competing for the food. Thus\r\nall who have had experience in fishing in Highland lochs, know that where\r\nthe trout are numerous they are small, and that where they are\r\ncomparatively large they are comparatively few.\r\n\r\nWhat is the relation between growth and expenditure of energy? is a\r\nquestion which next presents itself. Though there is reason to believe such\r\na relation exists, it is not very readily traced: involved as it is with so\r\nmany other relations. Some contrasts, however, may be pointed out that\r\nappear to give evidence of it. Passing over the vegetal kingdom, throughout\r\nwhich the expenditure of force is too small to allow of such a relation\r\nbeing visible, let us seek in the animal kingdom, some case where classes\r\notherwise allied, are contrasted in their locomotive activities. Let us\r\ncompare birds on the one hand, with reptiles and mammals on the other. It\r\nis an accepted doctrine that birds are organized on a type closely allied\r\nto the reptilian type, but superior to it; and though in some respects the\r\norganization of birds is inferior to that of mammals, yet in other\r\nrespects, as in the greater heterogeneity and integration of the skeleton,\r\nthe more complex development of the respiratory system, and the higher\r\ntemperature of the blood, it may be held that birds stand above mammals.\r\nHence were growth dependent only on organization, we might infer that the\r\nlimit of growth among birds should not be much short of that among mammals;\r\nand that the bird-type should admit of a larger growth than the\r\nreptile-type. Again, we see no manifest disadvantages under which birds\r\nlabour in obtaining food, but from which reptiles and mammals are free. On\r\nthe contrary, birds are able to get at food that is fixed beyond the reach\r\nof reptiles and mammals; and can catch food that is too swift of movement\r\nto be ordinarily caught by reptiles and mammals. Nevertheless, the limit of\r\ngrowth in birds falls far below that reached by reptiles and mammals. With\r\nwhat other contrast between these classes, is this contrast connected? May\r\nwe not suspect that it is connected (partially though not wholly) with the\r\ncontrast between their amounts of locomotive exertion? Whereas mammals\r\n(excepting bats, which are small), are during all their movements supported\r\nby solid surfaces or dense liquids; and whereas reptiles (excepting the\r\nancient pterodactyles, which were not very large), are similarly restricted\r\nin their spheres of movement; the majority of birds move more or less\r\nhabitually through a rare medium, in which they cannot support themselves\r\nwithout relatively great efforts. And this general fact may be joined with\r\nthe special fact, that those members of the class _Aves_, as the _Dinornis_\r\nand _Epiornis_, which approached in size to the larger _Mammalia_ and\r\n_Reptilia_, were creatures incapable of flight--creatures which did not\r\nexpend this excess of force in locomotion. But as implied above, and as\r\nwill presently be shown, another factor of importance comes into play; so\r\nthat perhaps the safest evidence that there is an antagonism between the\r\nincrease of bulk and the quantity of motion evolved is that supplied by the\r\ngeneral experience, that human beings and domestic animals, when overworked\r\nwhile growing, are prevented from attaining the ordinary dimensions.\r\n\r\nOne other general truth concerning degrees of growth, must be set down. It\r\nis a rule, having exceptions of no great importance, that large organisms\r\ncommence their separate existences as masses of organic matter more or less\r\nconsiderable in size, and commonly with organizations more or less\r\nadvanced; and that throughout each organic sub-kingdom, there is a certain\r\ngeneral, though irregular, relation between the initial and the final\r\nbulks. Vegetals exhibit this relation less manifestly than animals. Yet\r\nthough, among the plants that begin life as minute spores, there are some\r\nwhich, by the aid of an intermediate form, grow to large sizes, the immense\r\nmajority of them remain small. While, conversely, the great Monocotyledons\r\nand Dicotyledons, when thrown off from their parents, have already the\r\nformed organs of young plants, to which are attached stores of highly\r\nnutritive matter. That is to say, where the young plant consists merely of\r\na centre of development, the ultimate growth is commonly insignificant; but\r\nwhere the growth is to become great, there exists to start with, a\r\ndeveloped embryo and a stock of assimilable matter. Throughout the animal\r\nkingdom this relation is tolerably manifest though by no means uniform.\r\nSave among classes that escape the ordinary requirements of animal life,\r\nsmall germs or eggs do not in most cases give rise to bulky creatures.\r\nWhere great bulk is to be reached, the young proceeds from an egg of\r\nconsiderable bulk, or is born of considerable bulk ready-organized and\r\npartially active. In the class Fishes, or in such of them as are subject to\r\nsimilar conditions of life, some proportion usually obtains between the\r\nsizes of the ova and the sizes of the adult individuals; though in the\r\ncases of the sturgeon and the tunny there are exceptions, probably\r\ndetermined by the circumstances of oviposition and those of juvenile life.\r\nReptiles have eggs that are smaller in number, and relatively greater in\r\nmass, than those of fishes; and throughout this class, too, there is a\r\ngeneral congruity between the bulk of the egg and the bulk of the adult\r\ncreature. As a group, birds show us further limitations in the numbers of\r\ntheir eggs as well as farther increase in their relative sizes; and from\r\nthe minute eggs of the humming-bird up to the immense ones of the\r\n_Epiornis_, holding several quarts, we see that, speaking generally, the\r\ngreater the eggs the greater the birds., Finally, among mammals (omitting\r\nthe marsupials) the young are born, not only of comparatively large sizes,\r\nbut with advanced organizations; and throughout this sub-division of the\r\n_Vertebrata_, as throughout the others, there is a manifest connexion\r\nbetween the sizes at birth and the sizes at maturity.  As having a kindred\r\nmeaning, there must finally be noted the fact that the young of these\r\nhighest animals, besides starting in life with bodies of considerable\r\nsizes, almost fully organized, are, during subsequent periods of greater or\r\nless length, supplied with nutriment--in birds by feeding and in mammals by\r\nsuckling and afterwards by feeding. So that beyond the mass and\r\norganization directly bequeathed, a bird or mammal obtains a further large\r\nmass at but little cost to itself.\r\n\r\nWere exhaustive treatment of the topic intended, it would be needful to\r\ngive a paragraph to each of the incidental circumstances by which growth\r\nmay be aided or restricted:--such facts as that an entozoon is limited by\r\nthe size of the creature, or even the organ, in which it thrives; that an\r\nepizoon, though getting abundant nutriment without appreciable exertion, is\r\nrestricted to that small bulk at which it escapes ready detection by the\r\nanimal it infests; that sometimes, as in the weazel, smallness is a\r\ncondition to successful pursuit of the animals preyed upon; and that in\r\nsome cases, the advantage of resembling certain other creatures, and so\r\ndeceiving enemies or prey, becomes an indirect cause of restricted size.\r\nBut the present purpose is simply to set down those most general relations\r\nbetween growth and other organic traits, which induction leads us to.\r\nHaving done this, let us go on to inquire whether these general relations\r\ncan be deductively established.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 44. That there must exist a certain dependence of growth on organization,\r\nmay be shown _a priori_. When we consider the phenomena of Life, either by\r\nthemselves or in their relations to surrounding phenomena, we see that,\r\nother things equal, the larger the aggregate the greater is the needful\r\ncomplexity of structure.\r\n\r\nIn plants, even of the highest type, there is a comparatively small mutual\r\ndependence of parts: a gathered flower-bud will unfold and flourish for\r\ndays if its stem be immersed in water; and a shoot cut off from its\r\nparent-tree and stuck in the ground will grow. The respective parts having\r\nvital activities that are not widely unlike, it is possible for great bulk\r\nto be reached without that structural complexity required for combining the\r\nactions of parts. Even here, however, we see that for the attainment of\r\ngreat bulk there requires such a degree of organization as shall\r\nco-ordinate the functions of roots and branches--we see that such a size as\r\nis reached by trees, is not possible without a vascular system enabling the\r\nremote organs to utilize each other's products. And we see that such a\r\nco-existence of large growth with comparatively low organization as occurs\r\nin some of the marine _Algæ_, occurs where the conditions of existence do\r\nnot necessitate any considerable mutual dependence of parts--where the near\r\napproach of the plant to its medium in specific gravity precludes the need\r\nof a well-developed stem, and where all the materials of growth being\r\nderived from the water by each portion of the thallus, there requires no\r\napparatus for transferring the crude food materials from part to part.\r\nAmong animals which, with but few exceptions, are, by the conditions of\r\ntheir existence, required to absorb nutriment through one specialized part\r\nof the body, it is clear that there must be a means whereby other parts of\r\nthe body, to be supported by this nutriment, must have it conveyed to them.\r\nIt is clear that for an equally efficient maintenance of their nutrition,\r\nthe parts of a large mass must have a more elaborate propelling and\r\nconducting apparatus; and that in proportion as these parts undergo greater\r\nwaste, a yet higher development of the vascular system is necessitated.\r\nSimilarly with the prerequisites to those mechanical motions which animals\r\nare required to perform. The parts of a mass cannot be made to move, and\r\nhave their movements so co-ordinated as to produce locomotive and other\r\nactions, without certain structural arrangements; and, other things equal,\r\na given amount of such activity requires more involved structural\r\narrangements in a large mass than in a small one. There must at least be a\r\nco-ordinating apparatus presenting greater contrasts in its central and\r\nperipheral parts.\r\n\r\nThe qualified dependence of growth on organization, is equally implied when\r\nwe study it in connexion with that adjustment of inner to outer relations\r\nwhich constitutes Life as phenomenally known to us. In plants this is less\r\nstriking than in animals, because the adjustment of inner to outer\r\nrelations does not involve conspicuous motions. Still, it is visible in the\r\nfact that the condition on which alone a plant can grow to a great size,\r\nis, that it shall, by the development of a massive trunk, present inner\r\nrelations of forces fitted to counterbalance those outer relations of\r\nforces which tend continually, and others which tend occasionally, to\r\noverthrow it; and this formation of a core of regularly-arranged woody\r\nfibres is an advance in organization.  Throughout the animal kingdom this\r\nconnexion of phenomena is manifest. To obtain materials for growth; to\r\navoid injuries which interfere with growth; and to escape those enemies\r\nwhich bring growth to a sudden end; implies in the organism the means of\r\nfitting its movements to meet numerous external co-existences and\r\nsequences--implies such various structural arrangements as shall make\r\npossible these variously-adapted actions. It cannot be questioned that,\r\neverything else remaining constant, a more complex animal, capable of\r\nadjusting its conduct to a greater number of surrounding contingencies,\r\nwill be the better able to secure food and evade damage, and so to increase\r\nbulk. And evidently, without any qualification, we may say that a large\r\nanimal, living under such complex conditions of existence as everywhere\r\nobtain, is not possible without comparatively high organization.\r\n\r\nWhile, then, this relation is traversed and obscured by sundry other\r\nrelations, it cannot but exist. Deductively we see that it must be\r\nmodified, as inductively we saw that it is modified, by the circumstances\r\namid which each kind of organism is placed, but that it is always a factor\r\nin determining the result.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 45. That growth is, _cæteris paribus_, dependent on the supply of\r\nassimilable matter, is a proposition so continually illustrated by special\r\nexperience, as well as so obvious from general experience, that it would\r\nscarcely need stating, were it not requisite to notice the qualifications\r\nwith which it must be taken.\r\n\r\nThe materials which each organism requires for building itself up, are not\r\nof one kind but of several kinds. As a vehicle for transferring matter\r\nthrough their structures, all organisms require water as well as solid\r\nconstituents; and however abundant the solid constituents there can be no\r\ngrowth in the absence of water. Among the solids supplied, there must be a\r\nproportion ranging within certain limits. A plant round which carbonic\r\nacid, water, and ammonia exist in the right quantities, may yet be arrested\r\nin its growth by a deficiency of potassium. The total absence of lime from\r\nits food may stop the formation of a mammal's skeleton: thus dwarfing, if\r\nnot eventually destroying, the mammal; and this no matter what quantities\r\nof other needful colloids and crystalloids are furnished.\r\n\r\nAgain, the truth that, other things equal, growth varies according to the\r\nsupply of nutriment, has to be qualified by the condition that the supply\r\nshall not exceed the ability to appropriate it. In the vegetal kingdom, the\r\nassimilating surface being external and admitting of rapid expansion by the\r\nformation of new roots, shoots, and leaves, the effect of this limitation\r\nis not conspicuous. By artificially supplying plants with those materials\r\nwhich they have usually the most difficulty in obtaining, we can greatly\r\nfacilitate their growth; and so can produce striking differences of size in\r\nthe same species. Even here, however, the effect is confined within the\r\nlimits of the ability to appropriate; since in the absence of that solar\r\nlight and heat by the help of which the chief appropriation is carried on,\r\nthe additional materials for growth are useless. In the animal kingdom this\r\nrestriction is rigorous. The absorbent surface being, in the great majority\r\nof cases, internal; having a comparatively small area, which cannot be\r\ngreatly enlarged without reconstruction of the whole body; and being in\r\nconnexion with a vascular system which also must be re-constructed before\r\nany considerable increase of nutriment can be made available; it is clear\r\nthat beyond a certain point, very soon reached, increase of nutriment will\r\nnot cause increase of growth. On the contrary, if the quantity of food\r\ntaken in is greatly beyond the digestive and absorbent power, the excess,\r\nbecoming an obstacle to the regular working of the organism, may retard\r\ngrowth rather than advance it.\r\n\r\nWhile then it is certain, _a priori_, that there cannot be growth in the\r\nabsence of such substances as those of which an organism consists; and\r\nwhile it is equally certain that the amount of growth must primarily be\r\ngoverned by the supply of these substances; it is not less certain that\r\nextra supply will not produce extra growth, beyond a point very soon\r\nreached. Deduction shows to be necessary, as induction makes familiar, the\r\ntruths that the value of food for purposes of growth depends not on the\r\nquantity of the various organizable materials it contains, but on the\r\nquantity of the material most needed; that given a right proportion of\r\nmaterials, the pre-existing structure of the organism limits their\r\navailability; and that the higher the structure, the sooner is this limit\r\nreached.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 46. But why should the growth of every organism be finally arrested?\r\nThough the rate of increase may, in each case, be necessarily restricted\r\nwithin a narrow range of variation--though the increment that is possible\r\nin a given time, cannot exceed a certain amount; yet why should the\r\nincrements decrease and finally become insensible? Why should not all\r\norganisms, when supplied with sufficient materials, continue to grow as\r\nlong as they live? To find an answer to this question we must revert to the\r\nnature and functions of organic matter.\r\n\r\nIn the first three chapters of Part I, it was shown that plants and animals\r\nmainly consist of substances in states of unstable equilibrium--substances\r\nwhich have been raised to this unstable equilibrium by the expenditure of\r\nthe forces we know as solar radiations, and which give out these forces in\r\nother forms on falling into states of stable equilibrium. Leaving out the\r\nwater, which serves as a vehicle for these materials and a medium for their\r\nchanges; and excluding those mineral matters that play either passive or\r\nsubsidiary parts; organisms are built up of compounds which are stores of\r\nforce. Thus complex colloids and crystalloids which, as united together,\r\nform organized bodies, are the same colloids and crystalloids which give\r\nout, on their decomposition, the forces expended by organized bodies. Thus\r\nthese nitrogenous and carbonaceous substances, being at once the materials\r\nfor organic growth and the sources of organic energy, it results that as\r\nmuch of them as is used up for the genesis of energy is taken away from the\r\nmeans of growth, and as much as is economized by diminishing the genesis of\r\nenergy, is available for growth. Given that limited quantity of nutritive\r\nmatter which the pre-existing structure of an organism enables it to\r\nabsorb; and it is a necessary corollary from the persistence of force, that\r\nthe matter accumulated as growth cannot exceed that surplus which remains\r\nundecomposed after the production of the required amounts of sensible and\r\ninsensible motion. This, which would be rigorously true under all\r\nconditions if exactly the same substances were used in exactly the same\r\nproportions for the production of force and for the formation of tissue,\r\nrequires, however, to be taken with the qualification that some of the\r\nforce-evolving substances are not constituents of tissue; and that thus\r\nthere may be a genesis of force which is not at the expense of potential\r\ngrowth. But since organisms (or at least animal organisms, with which we\r\nare here chiefly concerned) have a certain power of selective absorption,\r\nwhich, partially in an individual and more completely in a race, adapts the\r\nproportions of the substances absorbed to the needs of the system; then if\r\na certain habitual expenditure of force leads to a certain habitual\r\nabsorption of force-evolving matters that are not available for growth; and\r\nif, were there less need for such matters, the ability to absorb matters\r\navailable for growth would be increased to an equivalent extent; it follows\r\nthat the antagonism described does, in the long run, hold even without this\r\nqualification. Hence, growth is substantially equivalent to the absorbed\r\nnutriment, minus the nutriment used up in action.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is no answer to the question--why has individual growth a\r\nlimit?--why do the increments of growth bear decreasing ratios to the mass\r\nand finally come to an end? The question is involved. There are more causes\r\nthan one why the excess of absorbed nutriment over expended nutriment must,\r\nother things equal, become less as the size of the animal becomes greater.\r\nIn similarly-shaped bodies the masses, and therefore the weights, vary as\r\nthe cubes of the dimensions; whereas the powers of bearing the stresses\r\nimposed by the weights vary as the squares of the dimensions. Suppose a\r\ncreature which a year ago was one foot high, has now become two feet high,\r\nwhile it is unchanged in proportions and structure; what are the necessary\r\nconcomitant changes? It is eight times as heavy; that is to say, it has to\r\nresist eight times the strain which gravitation puts upon certain of its\r\nparts; and when there occurs sudden arrest of motion or sudden genesis of\r\nmotion, eight times the strain is put upon the muscles employed. Meanwhile\r\nthe muscles and bones have severally increased their abilities to bear\r\nstrains in proportion to the areas of their transverse sections, and hence\r\nhave severally only four times the tenacity they had. This relative\r\ndecrease in the power of bearing stress does not imply a relative decrease\r\nin the power of generating energy and moving the body; for in the case\r\nsupposed the muscles have not only increased four times in their transverse\r\nsections but have become twice as long, and will therefore generate an\r\namount of energy proportionate to their bulk. The implication is simply\r\nthat each muscle has only half the power to withstand those shocks and\r\nstrains which the creature's movements entail; and that consequently the\r\ncreature must be either less able to bear these, or must have muscles and\r\nbones having relatively greater transverse dimensions: the result being\r\nthat greater cost of nutrition is inevitably caused and therefore a\r\ncorrelative tendency to limit growth. This necessity will be seen still\r\nmore clearly if we leave out the motor apparatus, and consider only the\r\nforces required and the means of supplying them. For since, in similar\r\nbodies, the areas vary as the squares of the dimensions, and the masses\r\nvary as the cubes; it follows that the absorbing surface has become four\r\ntimes as great, while the weight to be moved by the matter absorbed has\r\nbecome eight times as great.  If then, a year ago, the absorbing surface\r\ncould take up twice as much nutriment as was needed for expenditure, thus\r\nleaving one-half for growth, it is now able only just to meet expenditure,\r\nand can provide nothing for growth. However great the excess of\r\nassimilation over waste may be during the early life of an active organism,\r\nwe see that because a series of numbers increasing as the cubes, overtakes\r\na series increasing as the squares, even though starting from a much\r\nsmaller number, there must be reached, if the organism lives long enough, a\r\npoint at which the surplus assimilation is brought down to nothing--a point\r\nat which expenditure balances nutrition--a state of moving equilibrium. The\r\nonly way in which the difficulty can be met is by gradual re-organization\r\nof the alimentary system; and, in the first place, this entails direct cost\r\nupon the organism, and, in the second place, indirect cost from the\r\ncarrying of greater weight: both tending towards limitation. There are two\r\nother varying relations between degrees of growth and amounts of expended\r\nforce; one of which conspires with the last, while the other conflicts with\r\nit. Consider, in the first place, the cost at which nutriment is\r\ndistributed through the body and effete matters removed from it. Each\r\nincrement of growth being added at the periphery of the organism, the force\r\nexpended in the transfer of matter must increase in a rapid progression--a\r\nprogression more rapid than that of the mass. But as the dynamic expense of\r\ndistribution is small compared with the dynamic value of the materials\r\ndistributed, this item in the calculation is unimportant. Now consider, in\r\nthe second place, the changing proportion between production and loss of\r\nheat. In similar organisms the quantities of heat generated by similar\r\nactions going on throughout their substance, must increase as the masses,\r\nor as the cubes of the dimensions. Meanwhile, the surfaces from which loss\r\nof heat takes place, increase only as the squares of the dimensions. Though\r\nthe loss of heat does not therefore increase only as the squares of the\r\ndimensions, it certainly increases at a smaller rate than the cubes. And to\r\nthe extent that augmentation of mass results in a greater retention of\r\nheat, it effects an economization of force. This advantage is not, however,\r\nso important as at first appears. Organic heat is a concomitant of organic\r\naction, and is so abundantly produced during action that the loss of it is\r\nthen usually of no consequence: indeed the loss is often not rapid enough\r\nto keep the supply from rising to an inconvenient excess. It is chiefly in\r\nrespect of that maintenance of heat which is needful during quiescence,\r\nthat large organisms have an advantage over small ones in this relatively\r\ndiminished loss. Thus these two subsidiary relations between degrees of\r\ngrowth and amounts of expended force, being in antagonism, we may conclude\r\nthat their differential result does not greatly modify the result of the\r\nchief relation.\r\n\r\nComparisons of these deductions with the facts appear in some cases to\r\nverify them and in other cases not to do so. Throughout the vegetal\r\nkingdom, there are no distinct limits to growth except those which death\r\nentails. Passing over a large proportion of plants which never exceed a\r\ncomparatively small size, because they wholly or partially die down at the\r\nend of the year, and looking only at trees that annually send forth new\r\nshoots, even when their trunks are hollowed by decay; we may ask--How does\r\ngrowth happen here to be unlimited? The answer is, that plants are only\r\naccumulators: they are in no very appreciable degree expenders. As they do\r\nnot undergo waste there is no reason why their growth should be arrested by\r\nthe equilibration of assimilation and waste.  Again, among animals there\r\nare sufficient reasons why the correspondence cannot be more than\r\napproximate. Besides the fact above noted, that there are other varying\r\nrelations which complicate the chief one. We must bear in mind that the\r\nbodies compared are not truly similar: the proportions of trunk to limbs\r\nand trunk to head, vary considerably. The comparison is still more\r\nseriously vitiated by the inconstant ratio between the constituents of\r\nwhich the body is composed. In the flesh of adult mammalia, water forms\r\nfrom 68 to 71 per cent., organic substance from 24 to 28 per cent., and\r\ninorganic substance from 3 to 5 per cent.; whereas in the foetal state, the\r\nwater amounts to 87 per cent., and the solid organic constituents to only\r\n11 per cent. Clearly this change from a state in which the force-evolving\r\nmatter forms one-tenth of the whole, to a state in which it forms two and a\r\nhalf tenths, must greatly interfere with the parallelism between the actual\r\nand the theoretical progression. Yet another difficulty may come under\r\nnotice. The crocodile is said to grow as long as it lives; and there\r\nappears reason to think that some predaceous fishes, such as the pike, do\r\nthe same. That these animals of comparatively high organization have no\r\ndefinite limits of growth, is, however, an exceptional fact due to the\r\nexceptional non-fulfilment of those conditions which entail limitation.\r\nWhat kind of life does a crocodile lead? It is a cold-blooded, or almost\r\ncold-blooded, creature; that is, it expends very little for the maintenance\r\nof heat. It is habitually inert: not usually chasing prey but lying in wait\r\nfor it; and undergoes considerable exertion only during its occasional\r\nbrief contests with prey. Such other exertion as is, at intervals, needful\r\nfor moving from place to place, is rendered small by the small difference\r\nbetween the animal's specific gravity and that of water. Thus the crocodile\r\nexpends in muscular action an amount of force that is insignificant\r\ncompared with the force commonly expended by land-animals. Hence its\r\nhabitual assimilation is diminished much less than usual by habitual waste;\r\nand beginning with an excessive disproportion between the two, it is quite\r\npossible for the one never quite to lose its advance over the other while\r\nlife continues. On looking closer into such cases as this and that of the\r\npike, which is similarly cold-blooded, similarly lies in wait, and is\r\nsimilarly able to obtain larger and larger kinds of prey as it increases in\r\nsize; we discover a further reason for this absence of a definite limit. To\r\novercome gravitative force the creature has not to expend a muscular power\r\nthat is large at the outset, and increases as the cubes of its dimensions:\r\nits dense medium supports it. The exceptional continuance of growth\r\nobserved in creatures so circumstanced, is therefore perfectly explicable.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 46a. If we go back upon the conclusions set forth in the preceding\r\nsection, we find that from some of them may be drawn instructive\r\ncorollaries respecting the limiting sizes of creatures inhabiting different\r\nmedia. More especially I refer to those varying proportions between mass\r\nand stress from which, as we have seen, there results, along with\r\nincreasing size, a diminishing power of mechanical self-support: a relation\r\nillustrated in its simplest form by the contrast between a dew-drop, which\r\ncan retain its spheroidal form, and the spread-out mass of water which\r\nresults when many dew-drops run together. The largest bird that flies (the\r\nargument excludes birds which do not fly) is the Condor, which reaches a\r\nweight of from 30 to 40 lbs. Why does there not exist a bird of the size of\r\nan elephant? Supposing its habits to be carnivorous, it would have many\r\nadvantages in obtaining prey: mammals would be at its mercy. Evidently the\r\nreason is one which has been pointed out--the reason that while the weight\r\nto be raised and kept in the air by a bird increases as the cubes of its\r\ndimensions, the ability of its bones and muscles to resist the strains\r\nwhich flight necessitates, increases only as the squares of the dimensions.\r\nThough, could the muscles withstand any tensile strain they were subject\r\nto, the power like the weight might increase with the cubes, yet since the\r\ntexture of muscle is such that beyond a certain strain it tears, it results\r\nthat there is soon reached a size at which flight becomes impossible: the\r\nstructures must give way. In a preceding paragraph the limit to the size of\r\nflying creatures was ascribed to the greater physiological cost of the\r\nenergy required; but it seems probable that the mechanical obstacle here\r\npointed out has a larger share in determining the limit.\r\n\r\nIn a kindred manner there results a limitation of growth in a land-animal,\r\nwhich does not exist for an animal living in the water. If, after comparing\r\nthe agile movements of a dog with those of a cow, the great weight of which\r\nobviously prevents agility; or if, after observing the swaying flesh of an\r\nelephant as it walks along, we consider what would happen could there be\r\nformed a land-animal equal in mass to the whale (the long Dinosaurs were\r\nnot proportionately massive) it needs no argument to show that such a\r\ncreature could not stand, much less move about. But in the water the strain\r\nput upon its structures by the weights of its various parts is almost if\r\nnot quite taken away. Probably limitation in the quantity of food\r\nobtainable becomes now the chief, if not the sole, restraint.\r\n\r\nAnd here we may note, before leaving the topic, something like a converse\r\ninfluence which comes into play among creatures inhabiting the water. Up to\r\nthe point at which muscles tear from over-strain, larger and smaller\r\ncreatures otherwise alike, remain upon a par in respect of the relative\r\namounts of energy they can evolve. Had they to encounter no resistance from\r\ntheir medium, the implication would be that neither would have an advantage\r\nover the other in respect of speed. But resistance of the medium comes into\r\nplay; and this, other things equal, gives to the larger creature an\r\nadvantage. It has been found, experimentally, that the forces to be\r\novercome by vessels moving through the water, built as they are with\r\nimmersed hinder parts which taper as fish taper, are mainly due to what is\r\ncalled \"skin-friction.\" Now in two fish unlike in size but otherwise\r\nsimilar skin-friction bears to the energy that can be generated, a smaller\r\nproportion in the larger than in the smaller; and the larger can therefore\r\nacquire a greater velocity. Hence the reason why large fish, such as the\r\nshark, become possible. In a habitat where there is no ambush (save in\r\nexceptional cases like that of the _Lophius_ or Angler) everything depends\r\non speed; and if, other things equal, a larger fish had no mechanical\r\nadvantage over a smaller, a larger fish could not exist--could not catch\r\nthe requisite amount of prey.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 47. Obviously this antagonism between accumulation and expenditure, must\r\nbe a leading cause of the contrasts in size between allied organisms that\r\nare in many respects similarly conditioned. The life followed by each kind\r\nof animal is one involving a certain average amount of exertion for the\r\nobtainment of a given amount of nutriment--an exertion, part of which goes\r\nto the gathering or catching of food, part to the tearing and mastication\r\nof it, and part to the after-processes requisite for separating the\r\nnutritive molecules--an exertion which therefore varies according as the\r\nfood is abundant or scarce, fixed or moving, according as it is\r\nmechanically easy or difficult to deal with when secured, and according as\r\nit is, or is not, readily soluble. Hence, while among animals of the same\r\nspecies having the same mode of life, there will be a tolerably constant\r\nratio between accumulation and expenditure, and therefore a tolerably\r\nconstant limit of growth, there is every reason to expect that different\r\nspecies, following different modes of life, will have unlike ratios between\r\naccumulation and expenditure, and therefore unlike limits of growth.\r\n\r\nThough the facts as inductively established, show a general harmony with\r\nthis deduction, we cannot usually trace it in any specific way; since the\r\nconflicting and conspiring factors which affect growth are so numerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 48. One of the chief causes, if not the chief cause, of the differences\r\nbetween the sizes of organisms, has yet to be considered. We are introduced\r\nto it by pushing the above inquiry a little further. Small animals have\r\nbeen shown to possess an advantage over large ones in the greater ratio\r\nwhich, other things equal, assimilation bears to expenditure; and we have\r\nseen that hence small animals in becoming large ones, gradually lose that\r\nsurplus of assimilative power which they had, and eventually cannot\r\nassimilate more than is required to balance waste. But how come these\r\nanimals while young and small to have surplus assimilative powers? Have all\r\nanimals equal surpluses of assimilative powers? And if not, how far do\r\ndifferences between the surpluses determine differences between the limits\r\nof growth?  We shall find, in the answers to these questions, the\r\ninterpretation of many marked contrasts in growth that are not due to any\r\nof the causes above assigned. For example, an ox immensely exceeds a sheep\r\nin mass. Yet the two live from generation to generation in the same fields,\r\neat the same grass, obtain these aliments with the same small expenditure\r\nof energy, and differ scarcely at all in their degrees of organization.\r\nWhence arises, then, their striking unlikeness of bulk?\r\n\r\nWe noted when studying the phenomena of growth inductively, that organisms\r\nof the larger and higher types commence their separate existences as masses\r\nof organic matter having tolerable magnitudes. Speaking generally, we saw\r\nthat throughout each organic sub-kingdom the acquirement of great bulk\r\noccurs only where the incipient bulk and organization are considerable; and\r\nthat they are the more considerable in proportion to the complexity of the\r\nlife which the organism is to lead.\r\n\r\nThe deductive interpretation of this induction may best be commenced by an\r\nanalogy. A street orange-vendor makes but a trifling profit on each\r\ntransaction; and unless more than ordinarily fortunate, he is unable to\r\nrealize during the day a larger amount than will meet his wants; leaving\r\nhim to start on the morrow in the same condition as before. The trade of\r\nthe huxter in ounces of tea and half-pounds of sugar, is one similarly\r\nentailing much labour for small returns. Beginning with a capital of a few\r\npounds, he cannot have a shop large enough, or goods sufficiently abundant\r\nand various, to permit an extensive business. He must be content with the\r\nhalf-pence and pence which he makes by little sales to poor people; and if,\r\navoiding bad debts, he is able by strict economy to accumulate anything, it\r\ncan be but a trifle. A large retail trader is obliged to lay out much money\r\nin fitting up an adequate establishment; he must invest a still greater sum\r\nin stock; and he must have a further floating capital to meet the charges\r\nthat fall due before his returns come in. Setting out, however, with means\r\nenough for these purposes, he is able to make many and large sales; and so\r\nto get greater and more numerous increments of profit. Similarly, to get\r\nreturns in thousands merchants and manufacturers must make their\r\ninvestments in tens of thousands. In brief, the rate at which a man's\r\nwealth accumulates is measured by the surplus of income over expenditure;\r\nand this, save in exceptionably favourable cases, is determined by the\r\ncapital with which he begins business.  Now applying the analogy, we may\r\ntrace in the transactions of an organism, the same three ultimate elements.\r\nThere is the expenditure required for the obtainment and digestion of food;\r\nthere is the gross return in the shape of nutriment assimilated or fit for\r\nassimilation; and there is the difference between this gross return of\r\nnutriment and the nutriment that was used up in the labour of securing\r\nit--a difference which may be a profit or a loss. Clearly, however, a\r\nsurplus implies that the force expended is less than the force latent in\r\nthe assimilated food. Clearly, too, the increment of growth is limited to\r\nthe amount of this surplus of income over expenditure; so that large growth\r\nimplies both that the excess of nutrition over waste shall be relatively\r\nconsiderable, and that the waste and nutrition shall be on extensive\r\nscales. And clearly, the ability of an organism to expend largely and\r\nassimilate largely, so as to make a large surplus, presupposes a large\r\nphysiological capital in the shape of organic matter more or less developed\r\nin its structural arrangements.\r\n\r\nThroughout the vegetal kingdom, the illustrations of this truth are not\r\nconspicuous and regular: the obvious reason being that since plants are\r\naccumulators and in so small a degree expenders, the premises of the above\r\nargument are but very partially fulfilled. The food of plants (excepting\r\nFungi and certain parasites) being in great measure the same for all, and\r\nbathing all so that it can be absorbed without effort, their vital\r\nprocesses result almost entirely in profit. Once fairly rooted in a fit\r\nplace, a plant may thus from the outset add a very large proportion of its\r\nentire returns to capital; and may soon be able to carry on its processes\r\non a large scale, though it does not at first do so. When, however, plants\r\nare expenders, namely, during their germination and first stages of growth,\r\ntheir degrees of growth _are_ determined by their amounts of vital capital.\r\nIt is because the young tree commences life with a ready-formed embryo and\r\nstore of food sufficient to last for some time, that it is enabled to\r\nstrike root and lift its head above the surrounding herbage. Throughout the\r\nanimal kingdom, however, the necessity of this relation is everywhere\r\nobvious. The small carnivore preying on small herbivores, can increase in\r\nsize only by small increments: its organization unfitting it to digest\r\nlarger creatures, even if it can kill them, it cannot profit by amounts of\r\nnutriment exceeding a narrow limit; and its possible increments of growth\r\nbeing small to set out with, and rapidly decreasing, must come to an end\r\nbefore any considerable size is attained. Manifestly the young lion, born\r\nof tolerable bulk, suckled until much bigger, and fed until half-grown, is\r\nenabled by the power and organization which he thus gets _gratis_, to catch\r\nand kill animals big enough to give him the supply of nutriment needed to\r\nmeet his large expenditure and yet leave a large surplus for growth. Thus,\r\nthen, is explained the above-named contrast between the ox and the sheep. A\r\ncalf and a lamb commence their physiological transactions on widely\r\ndifferent scales; their first increments of growth are similarly contrasted\r\nin their amounts; and the two diminishing series of such increments end at\r\nsimilarly-contrasted limits.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 49. Such are the several conditions by which the phenomena of growth are\r\ndetermined. Conspiring and conflicting in endless unlike ways and degrees,\r\nthey in every case qualify more or less differently each other's effects.\r\nHence it happens that we are obliged to state each generalization as true\r\non the average, or to make the proviso--other things equal.\r\n\r\nUnderstood in this qualified form, our conclusions are these. First, that\r\ngrowth being an integration with the organism of such environing matters as\r\nare of like natures with the matters composing the organism, its growth is\r\ndependent on the available supply of them. Second, that the available\r\nsupply of assimilable matter being the same, and other conditions not\r\ndissimilar, the degree of growth varies according to the surplus of\r\nnutrition over expenditure--a generalization which is illustrated in some\r\nof the broader contrasts between different divisions of organisms. Third,\r\nthat in the same organism the surplus of nutrition over expenditure differs\r\nat different stages; and that growth is unlimited or has a definite limit,\r\naccording as the surplus does or does not rapidly decrease. This\r\nproposition we found exemplified by the almost unceasing growth of\r\norganisms that expend relatively little energy; and by the definitely\r\nlimited growth of organisms that expend much energy. Fourth, that among\r\norganisms which are large expenders of force, the size ultimately attained\r\nis, other things equal, determined by the initial size: in proof of which\r\nconclusion we have abundant facts, as well as the _a priori_ necessity that\r\nthe sum-totals of analogous diminishing series, must depend upon the\r\namounts of their initial terms. Fifth, that where the likeness of other\r\ncircumstances permits a comparison, the possible extent of growth depends\r\non the degree of organization; an inference testified to by the larger\r\nforms among the various divisions and sub-divisions of organisms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT.[19]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 50. Certain general aspects of Development may be studied apart from any\r\nexamination of internal structures. These fundamental contrasts between the\r\nmodes of arrangement of parts, originating, as they do, the leading\r\nexternal distinctions among the various forms of organization, will be best\r\ndealt with at the outset. If all organisms have arisen by Evolution, it is\r\nof course not to be expected that such several modes of development can be\r\nabsolutely demarcated: we are sure to find them united by transitional\r\nmodes. But premising that a classification of modes can but approximately\r\nrepresent the facts, we shall find our general conceptions of Development\r\naided by one.\r\n\r\nDevelopment is primarily _central_. All organic forms of which the entire\r\nhistory is known, set out with a symmetrical arrangement of parts round a\r\ncentre. In organisms of the lowest grade no other mode of arrangement is\r\never definitely established; and in the highest organisms central\r\ndevelopment, though subordinate to another mode of development, continues\r\nto be habitually shown in the changes of minute structure. Let us glance at\r\nthese propositions in the concrete. Practically every plant and every\r\nanimal in its earliest stage is a portion of protoplasm, in the great\r\nmajority of cases approximately spherical but sometimes elongated,\r\ncontaining a rounded body consisting of specially modified protoplasm,\r\nwhich is called a nucleus; and the first changes that occur in the germ\r\nthus constituted, are changes that take place in this nucleus, followed by\r\nchanges round the centres produced by division of this original centre.\r\nFrom this type of structure, the simplest organisms do not depart; or\r\ndepart in no definite or conspicuous ways. Among plants, many of the\r\nsimplest _Algæ_ and _Fungi_ permanently maintain such a central\r\ndistribution; while among animals it is permanently maintained by creatures\r\nlike the _Gregarina_, and in a different manner by the _Amoeba_,\r\n_Actinophrys_, and their allies: the irregularities which are many and\r\ngreat do not destroy this general relation of parts. In larger organisms,\r\nmade up chiefly of units that are analogous to these simplest organisms,\r\nthe formation of units ever continues to take place round nuclei; though\r\nusually the nuclei soon cease to be centrally placed.\r\n\r\nCentral development may be distinguished into _unicentral_ and\r\n_multicentral_; according as the product of the original germ develops more\r\nor less symmetrically round one centre, or develops without subordination\r\nto one centre--develops, that is, in subordination to many centres.\r\nUnicentral development, as displayed not in the formation of single cells\r\nbut in the formation of aggregates, is not common. The animal kingdom shows\r\nit only in some of the small group of colonial _Radiolaria_. It is feebly\r\nrepresented in the vegetal kingdom by a few members of the _Volvocineæ_. On\r\nthe other hand, multicentral development, or development round\r\ninsubordinate centres, is variously exemplified in both divisions of the\r\norganic world. It is exemplified in two distinct ways, according as the\r\ninsubordination among the centres of development is partial or total. We\r\nmay most conveniently consider it under the heads hence arising.\r\n\r\nTotal insubordination among the centres of development, is shown where the\r\nunits or cells, as fast as they are severally formed, part company and lead\r\nindependent lives. This, in the vegetal kingdom, habitually occurs among\r\nthe _Protophyta_, and in the animal kingdom, among the _Protozoa_. Partial\r\ninsubordination is seen in those somewhat advanced organisms, that consist\r\nof units which, though they have not separated, have so little mutual\r\ndependence that the aggregate they form is irregular. Among plants, the\r\nThallophytes very generally exemplify this mode of development. Lichens,\r\nspreading with flat or corrugated edges in this or that direction as the\r\nconditions determine, have no manifest co-ordination of parts. In the\r\n_Algæ_ the Nostocs and various other forms similarly show us an\r\nunsymmetrical structure. Of _Fungi_ we may say that creeping kinds display\r\nno further dependence of one part on another than is implied by their\r\ncohesion. And even in such better-organized plants as the _Marchantia_, the\r\ngeneral arrangement shows no reference to a directive centre. Among animals\r\nmany of the Sponges in their adult forms may be cited as devoid of that\r\nco-ordination implied by symmetry: the units composing them, though they\r\nhave some subordination to local centres, have no subordination to a\r\ngeneral centre.  To distinguish that kind of development in which the whole\r\nproduct of a germ coheres in one mass, from that kind of development in\r\nwhich it does not, Professor Huxley has introduced the words \"_continuous_\"\r\nand \"_discontinuous_;\" and these seem the best fitted for the purpose.\r\nMulticentral development, then, is divisible into continuous and\r\ndiscontinuous.\r\n\r\nFrom central development we pass insensibly to that higher kind of\r\ndevelopment for which _axial_ seems the most appropriate name. A tendency\r\ntowards this is vaguely manifested almost everywhere. The great majority\r\neven of _Protophyta_ and _Protozoa_ have different longitudinal and\r\ntransverse dimensions--have an obscure if not a distinct axial structure.\r\nThe originally spheroidal and polyhedral units out of which higher\r\norganisms are mainly built, usually pass into shapes that are subordinated\r\nto lines rather than to points. And in the higher organisms, considered as\r\nwholes, an arrangement of parts in relation to an axis is distinct and\r\nnearly universal. We see it in the superior orders of Thallophytes; and in\r\nall the cormophytic plants. With few exceptions the _Coelenterata_ clearly\r\nexhibit it; it is traceable, though less conspicuously, throughout the\r\n_Mollusca_; and the _Annelida_, _Arthropoda_, and _Vertebrata_ uniformly\r\nshow it with perfect definiteness.\r\n\r\nThis kind of development, like the first kind, is of two orders. The whole\r\ngerm-product may arrange itself round a single axis, or it may arrange\r\nitself round many axes: the structure may be _uniaxial_ or _multiaxial_.\r\nEach division of the organic kingdom furnishes examples of both these\r\norders. In such _Fungi_ as exhibit axial development at all, we commonly\r\nsee development round a single axis. Some of the _Algæ_, as the common\r\ntangle, show us this arrangement. And of the higher plants, many\r\nMonocotyledons and small Dicotyledons are uniaxial. Of animals, the\r\nadvanced are without exception in this category. There is no known\r\nvertebrate in which the whole of the germ-product is not subordinated to a\r\nsingle axis. In the _Arthropoda_, the like is universal; as it is also in\r\nthe superior orders of _Mollusca_. Multiaxial development occurs in most of\r\nthe plants we are familiar with--every branch of a shrub or tree being an\r\nindependent axis. But while in the vegetal kingdom multiaxial development\r\nprevails among the highest types, in the animal kingdom it prevails only\r\namong the lowest types. It is extremely general, if not universal, among\r\nthe _Coelenterata_; it is characteristic of the _Polyzoa_; the compound\r\nAscidians exhibit it; and it is seen, though under another form, in certain\r\nof the inferior Annelids.\r\n\r\nDevelopment that is axial, like development that is central, may be either\r\ncontinuous or discontinuous: the parts having different axes may continue\r\nunited, or they may separate. Instances of each alternative are supplied by\r\nboth plants and animals. Continuous multiaxial development is that which\r\nplants usually display, and need not be illustrated further than by\r\nreference to every garden. As cases of it in animals may be named all the\r\ncompound _Hydrozoa_ and _Actinozoa_; and such ascidian forms as the\r\n_Botryllidæ_. Of multiaxial development that is discontinuous, a familiar\r\ninstance among plants exists in the common strawberry. This sends out over\r\nthe neighbouring surface, long slender shoots, bearing at their extremities\r\nbuds that presently strike roots and become new individuals; and these by\r\nand by lose their connexions with the original axis. Other plants there are\r\nthat produce certain specialized buds called bulbils, which separating\r\nthemselves and falling to the ground, grow into independent plants. Among\r\nanimals the fresh-water polype very clearly shows this mode of development:\r\nthe young polypes, budding out from its surface, severally arrange their\r\nparts around distinct axes, and eventually detaching themselves, lead\r\nseparate lives, and produce other polypes after the same fashion. By some\r\nof the lower _Annelida_, this multiplication of axes from an original axis,\r\nis carried on after a different manner: the string of segments\r\nspontaneously divides; and after further growth, division recurs in one or\r\nboth of the halves. Moreover in the _Syllis ramosa_, there occurs lateral\r\nbranching also.\r\n\r\nGrouping together its several modes as above delineated, we see that\r\n\r\n                             {  Unicentral\r\n                  { Central  {      or       {  Continuous\r\n                  {          { Multicentral  {     or\r\n                  {                          { Discontinuous\r\n  DEVELOPMENT is  {    or\r\n                  {\r\n                  {          {  Uniaxial\r\n                  {  Axial   {      or       {  Continuous\r\n                             { Multiaxial    {     or\r\n                                             { Discontinuous\r\n\r\nAny one well acquainted with the facts, may readily raise objections to\r\nthis arrangement. He may name forms which do not obviously come under any\r\nof these heads. He may point to plants that are for a time multicentral but\r\nafterwards develop axially. And from lower types of animals he may choose\r\nmany in which the continuous and discontinuous modes are both displayed.\r\nBut, as already hinted, an arrangement free from such anomalies must be\r\nimpossible, if the various kinds of organization have arisen by Evolution.\r\nThe one above sketched out is to be regarded as a rough grouping of the\r\nfacts, which helps us to a conception of them in their totality; and, so\r\nregarded, it will be of service when we come to treat of Individuality and\r\nReproduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 51. From these most general external aspects of organic development, let\r\nus now turn to its internal and more special aspects. When treating of\r\nEvolution as a universal process of things, a rude outline of the course of\r\nstructural changes in organisms was given (_First Principles_, §§ 110, 119,\r\n132). Here it will be proper to describe these changes more fully.\r\n\r\nThe bud of any common flowering plant in its earliest stage, consists of a\r\nsmall hemispherical or sub-conical projection. While it increases most\r\nrapidly at the apex, this presently develops on one side of its base, a\r\nsmaller projection of like general shape with itself. Here is the rudiment\r\nof a leaf, which presently spreads more or less round the base of the\r\ncentral hemisphere or main axis. At the same time that the central\r\nhemisphere rises higher, this lateral prominence, also increasing, gives\r\nrise to subordinate prominences or lobes. These are the rudiments of\r\nstipules, where the leaves are stipulated. Meanwhile, towards the other\r\nside of the main axis and somewhat higher up, another lateral prominence\r\narising marks the origin of a second leaf. By the time that the first leaf\r\nhas produced another pair of lobes, and the second leaf has produced its\r\nprimary pair, the central hemisphere, still increasing at its apex,\r\nexhibits the rudiment of a third leaf. Similarly throughout. While the germ\r\nof each succeeding leaf thus arises, the germs of the previous leaves, in\r\nthe order of their priority, are changing their rude nodulated shapes into\r\nflattened-out expansions; which slowly put on those sharp outlines they\r\nshow when unfolded. Thus from that extremely indefinite figure, a rounded\r\nlump, giving off from time to time lateral lumps, which severally becoming\r\nsymmetrically lobed gradually assume specific and involved forms, we pass\r\nlittle by little to that comparatively complex thing--a leaf-bearing shoot.\r\n Internally, a bud undergoes analogous changes; as witness this\r\naccount:--\"The general mass of thin-walled parenchymatous cells which\r\noccupies the apical region, and forms the _growing point_ of the shoot, is\r\ncovered by a single external layer of similar cells, which increase in\r\nnumber by the formation of new walls in one direction only, perpendicular\r\nto the surface of the shoot, and thus give rise only to the _epidermis_ or\r\nsingle layer of cells covering the whole surface of the shoot. Meanwhile\r\nthe general mass below grows as a whole, its constituent cells dividing in\r\nall directions. Of the new cells so formed, those removed by these\r\nprocesses of growth and division from the actual apex, begin, at a greater\r\nor less distance from it, to show signs of the differentiation which will\r\nultimately lead to the formation of the various tissues enclosed by the\r\nepidermis of the shoot. First the pith, then the vascular bundles, and then\r\nthe cortex of the shoot, begin to take on their special characters.\"\r\nSimilarly with secondary structures, as the lateral buds whence leaves\r\narise. In the, at first, unorganized mass of cells constituting the\r\nrudimentary leaf, there are formed vascular bundles which eventually become\r\nthe veins of the leaf; and _pari passu_ with these are formed the other\r\ntissues of the leaf. Nor do we fail to find an essentially parallel set of\r\nchanges, when we trace the histories of the individual cells. While the\r\ntissues they compose are separating, the cells are growing step by step\r\nmore unlike. Some become flat, some polyhedral, some cylindrical, some\r\nprismatic, some spindle-shaped. These develop spiral thickenings in their\r\ninteriors; and those, reticulate thickenings. Here a number of cells unite\r\ntogether to form a tube: and there they become almost solid by the internal\r\ndeposition of woody or other substance. Through such changes, too numerous\r\nand involved to be here detailed, the originally uniform cells go on\r\ndiverging and rediverging until there are produced various forms that seem\r\nto have very little in common.\r\n\r\nThe arm of a man makes its first appearance in as simple a way as does the\r\nshoot of a plant. According to Bischoff, it buds-out from the side of the\r\nembryo as a little tongue-shaped projection, presenting no differences of\r\nparts; and it might serve for the rudiment of some one of the various other\r\norgans that also arise as buds. Continuing to lengthen, it presently\r\nbecomes somewhat enlarged at its end; and is then described as a pedicle\r\nbearing a flattened, round-edged lump. This lump is the representative of\r\nthe future hand, and the pedicle of the future arm. By and by, at the edges\r\nof this flattened lump, there appear four clefts, dividing from each other\r\nthe buds of the future fingers; and the hand as a whole grows a little more\r\ndistinguishable from the arm. Up to this time the pedicle has remained one\r\ncontinuous piece, but it now begins to show a bend at its centre, which\r\nindicates the division into arm and forearm. The distinctions thus rudely\r\nindicated gradually increase: the fingers elongate and become jointed, and\r\nthe proportions of all the parts, originally very unlike those of the\r\ncomplete limb, slowly approximate to them. During its bud-like stage, the\r\nrudimentary arm consists only of partially-differentiated tissues. By the\r\ndiverse changes these gradually undergo they are transformed into bones,\r\nmuscles, blood-vessels, and nerves. The extreme softness and delicacy of\r\nthese primary tissues, renders it difficult to trace the initial stages of\r\nthe differentiations. In consequence of the colour of their contents, the\r\nblood-vessels are the first parts to become distinct. Afterwards the\r\ncartilaginous parts, which are the bases of the future bones, become marked\r\nout by the denser aggregation of their constituent cells, and by the\r\nproduction between these of a hyaline substance which unites them into a\r\ntranslucent mass. When first perceptible, the muscles are gelatinous, pale,\r\nyellowish, transparent, and indistinguishable from their tendons. The\r\nvarious other tissues of which the arm consists, beginning with very\r\nfaintly-marked differences, become day by day more definite in their\r\nqualitative appearances. In like manner the units composing these tissues\r\nseverally assume increasingly-specific characters. The fibres of muscle, at\r\nfirst made visible in the midst of their gelatinous matrix only by\r\nimmersion in alcohol, grow more numerous and distinct; and by and by they\r\nbegin to exhibit transverse stripes. The bone-cells put on by degrees their\r\ncurious structure of branching canals. And so in their respective ways with\r\nthe units of skin and the rest.\r\n\r\nThus in each of the organic sub-kingdoms, we see this change from an\r\nincoherent, indefinite homogeneity to a coherent, definite heterogeneity,\r\nillustrated in a quadruple way. The originally-like units called cells,\r\nbecome unlike in various ways, and in ways more numerous and marked as the\r\ndevelopment goes on. The several tissues which these several classes of\r\ncells form by aggregation, grow little by little distinct from each other;\r\nand little by little put on those structural complexities that arise from\r\ndifferentiations among their component units. In the shoot, as in the limb,\r\nthe external form, originally very simple, and having much in common with\r\nsimple forms in general, gradually acquires an increasing complexity, and\r\nan increasing unlikeness to other forms. Meanwhile, the remaining parts of\r\nthe organism to which the shoot or limb belongs, having been severally\r\nassuming structures divergent from one another and from that of this\r\nparticular shoot or limb, there has arisen a greater heterogeneity in the\r\norganism as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 52. One of the most remarkable inductions of embryology comes next in\r\norder.  And here we find illustrated the general truth that in mental\r\nevolution as in bodily evolution the progress is from the indefinite and\r\ninexact to the definite and exact. For the first statement of this\r\ninduction was but an adumbration of the correct statement.\r\n\r\nAs a result of his examinations von Baer alleged that in its earliest stage\r\nevery organism has the greatest number of characters in common with all\r\nother organisms in their earliest stages; that at a stage somewhat later\r\nits structure is like the structures displayed at corresponding phases by a\r\nless extensive assemblage of organisms; that at each subsequent stage\r\ntraits are acquired which successively distinguish the developing embryo\r\nfrom groups of embryos that it previously resembled--thus step by step\r\ndiminishing the group of embryos which it still resembles; and that thus\r\nthe class of similar forms is finally narrowed to the species of which it\r\nis a member. This abstract proposition will perhaps not be fully\r\ncomprehended by the general reader. It will be best to re-state it in a\r\nconcrete shape. Supposing the germs of all kinds of organisms to be\r\nsimultaneously developing, we may say that all members of the vast\r\nmultitude take their first steps in the same direction; that at the second\r\nstep one-half of this vast multitude diverges from the other half, and\r\nthereafter follows a different course of development; that the immense\r\nassemblage contained in either of these divisions very soon again shows a\r\ntendency to take two or more routes of development; that each of the two or\r\nmore minor assemblages thus resulting, shows for a time but small\r\ndivergences among its members, but presently again divides into groups\r\nwhich separate ever more widely as they progress; and so on until each\r\norganism, when nearly complete, is accompanied in its further modifications\r\nonly by organisms of the same species; and last of all, assumes the\r\npeculiarities which distinguish it as an individual--diverges to a slight\r\nextent to the organisms it is most like.\r\n\r\nBut, as above said, this statement is only an adumbration. The order of\r\nNature is habitually more complex than our generalizations represent it as\r\nbeing--refuses to be fully expressed in simple formulæ; and we are obliged\r\nto limit them by various qualifications. It is thus here. Since von Baer's\r\nday the careful observations of numerous observers have shown his\r\nallegation to be but approximately true. Hereafter, when discussing the\r\nembryological evidence of Evolution, the causes of deviations will be\r\ndiscussed. For the present it suffices to recognize as unquestionable the\r\nfact that whereas the germs of organisms are extremely similar, they\r\ngradually diverge widely, in modes now regular and now irregular, until in\r\nplace of a multitude of forms practically alike we finally have a multitude\r\nof forms most of which are extremely unlike. Thus, in conformity with the\r\nlaw of evolution, not only do the parts of each organism advance from\r\nindefinite homogeneity to definite heterogeneity, but the assemblage of all\r\norganisms does the same: a truth already indicated in _First Principles_.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 53. This comparison between the course of development, in any creature,\r\nand the course of development in all other creatures--this arrival at the\r\nconclusion that the course of development in each, at first the same as in\r\nall others, becomes stage by stage differentiated from the courses in all\r\nothers, brings us within view of an allied conclusion. If we contemplate\r\nthe successive stages passed through by any higher organism, and observe\r\nthe relation between it and its environment at each of these stages; we\r\nshall see that this relation is modified in a way analogous to that in\r\nwhich the relation between the organism and its environment is modified, as\r\nwe advance from the lowest to the highest grades. Along with the\r\nprogressing differentiation of each organism from others, we find a\r\nprogressing differentiation of it from its environment; like that\r\nprogressing differentiation from the environment which we meet with in the\r\nascending forms of life. Let us first glance at the way in which the\r\nascending forms of life exhibit this progressing differentiation from the\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is illustrated in _structure_. Advance from the\r\nhomogeneous to the heterogeneous, itself involves an increasing distinction\r\nfrom the inorganic world. Passing over the _Protozoa_, of which the\r\nsimplest probably disappeared during the earliest stages of organic\r\nevolution, and limiting our comparison to the _Metazoa_, we see that low\r\ntypes of these, as the _Coelenterata_, are relatively simple in their\r\norganization; and the ascent to organisms of greater and greater complexity\r\nof structure, is an ascent to organisms which are in that respect more\r\nstrongly contrasted with the structureless environment. In _form_, again,\r\nwe see the same truth. An ordinary characteristic of inorganic matter is\r\nits indefiniteness of form; and this is also a characteristic of the lower\r\norganisms, as compared with the higher. Speaking generally, plants are less\r\ndefinite than animals, both in shape and size--admit of greater\r\nmodifications from variations of position and nutrition. Among animals, the\r\nsimplest Rhizopods may almost be called amorphous: the form is never\r\nspecific, and is constantly changing. Of the organisms resulting from the\r\naggregation of such creatures, we see that while some, as the\r\n_Foraminifera_, assume a certain definiteness of form, in their shells at\r\nleast, others, as the Sponges, are very irregular. The Zoophytes and the\r\n_Polyzoa_ are compound organisms, most of which have a mode of growth not\r\nmore determinate than that of plants. But among the higher animals, we find\r\nnot only that the mature shape of each species is very definite, but that\r\nthe individuals of each species differ little in size. A parallel increase\r\nof contrast is seen in _chemical composition_. With but few exceptions, and\r\nthose only partial ones, the lowest animal and vegetal forms are\r\ninhabitants of the water; and water is almost their sole constituent.\r\nDesiccated _Protophyta_ and _Protozoa_ shrink into mere dust; and among the\r\nAcalephes we find but a few grains of solid matter to a pound of water. The\r\nhigher aquatic plants, in common with the higher aquatic animals,\r\npossessing as they do increased tenacity of substance, also contain a\r\ngreater proportion of the organic elements; further they show us a greater\r\nvariety of composition in their different parts; and thus in both ways are\r\nchemically more unlike their medium. And when we pass to the superior\r\nclasses of organisms--land-plants and land-animals--we see that, chemically\r\nconsidered, they have little in common either with the earth on which they\r\nstand or the air which surrounds them. In _specific gravity_ too, we may\r\nnote a like truth. The simplest forms, in common with the spores and\r\ngemmules of higher ones, are as nearly as may be of the same specific\r\ngravity as the water in which they float; and though it cannot be said that\r\namong aquatic creatures, superior specific gravity is a standard of general\r\nsuperiority, yet we may fairly say that the higher orders of them, when\r\ndivested of the appliances by which their specific gravity is regulated,\r\ndiffer more from water in their relative weights than do the lowest. In\r\nterrestrial organisms, the contrast becomes marked. Trees and plants, in\r\ncommon with insects, reptiles, mammals, birds, are all of a specific\r\ngravity considerably less than that of the earth and immensely greater than\r\nthat of the air. Yet further, we see the law fulfilled in respect of\r\n_temperature_. Plants generate but extremely small quantities of heat,\r\nwhich are to be detected only by delicate experiments; and practically they\r\nmay be considered as having the same temperature as their environment. The\r\ntemperature of aquatic animals is very little above that of the surrounding\r\nwater: that of the invertebrata being mostly less than a degree above it,\r\nand that of fishes not exceeding it by more than two or three degrees; save\r\nin the case of some large red-blooded fishes, as the tunny, which exceed it\r\nin temperature by nearly ten degrees. Among insects the range is from two\r\nto ten degrees above that of the air: the excess varying according to their\r\nactivity. The heat of reptiles is from four to fifteen degrees more than\r\nthe heat of their medium. While mammals and birds maintain a heat which\r\ncontinues almost unaffected by external variations, and is often greater\r\nthan that of the air by seventy, eighty, ninety, and even a hundred\r\ndegrees. Once more, in greater _self-mobility_ a progressive\r\ndifferentiation is traceable. The chief characteristic by which we\r\ndistinguish dead matter is its inertness: some form of independent motion\r\nis our most familiar proof of life. Passing over the indefinite border-land\r\nbetween the animal and vegetal kingdoms, we may roughly class plants as\r\norganisms which, while they exhibit that kind of motion implied in growth,\r\nare not only devoid of locomotive power, but with some unimportant\r\nexceptions are devoid of the power of moving their parts in relation to\r\neach other; and thus are less differentiated from the inorganic world than\r\nanimals. Though in those microscopic _Protophyta_ and _Protozoa_ inhabiting\r\nthe water we see locomotion produced by ciliary action; yet this\r\nlocomotion, while rapid relatively to the sizes of their bodies, is\r\nabsolutely slow. Of the _Coelenterata_ a great part are either permanently\r\nrooted or habitually stationary; and so have scarcely any self-mobility but\r\nthat implied in the relative movements of parts; while the rest, of which\r\nthe common jelly-fish serves as a sample, have mostly but little ability to\r\nmove themselves through the water. Among the higher aquatic\r\n_Invertebrata_,--cuttlefishes and lobsters, for instance,--there is a very\r\nconsiderable power of locomotion; and the aquatic _Vertebrata_ are,\r\nconsidered as a class, much more active in their movements than the other\r\ninhabitants of the water. But it is only when we come to air-breathing\r\ncreatures that we find the vital characteristics of self-mobility\r\nmanifested in the highest degree. Flying insects, mammals, birds, travel\r\nwith velocities far exceeding those attained by any of the lower classes of\r\nanimals. Thus, on contemplating the various grades of organisms in their\r\nascending order, we find them more and more distinguished from their\r\ninanimate media, in _structure_, in _form_, in _chemical composition_, in\r\n_specific gravity_, in _temperature_, in _self-mobility_. It is true that\r\nthis generalization does not hold with complete regularity. Organisms which\r\nare in some respects the most strongly contrasted with the environing\r\ninorganic world, are in other respects less contrasted than inferior\r\norganisms. As a class, mammals are higher than birds; and yet they are of\r\nlower temperature and have smaller powers of locomotion. The stationary\r\noyster is of higher organization than the free-swimming medusa; and the\r\ncold-blooded and less heterogeneous fish is quicker in its movements than\r\nthe warm-blooded and more heterogeneous sloth. But the admission that the\r\nseveral aspects under which this increasing contrast shows itself, bear\r\nvariable ratios to each other, does not conflict with the general truth\r\nthat as we ascend in the hierarchy of organisms, we meet with not only an\r\nincreasing differentiation of parts but also an increasing differentiation\r\nfrom the surrounding medium in sundry other physical attributes. It would\r\nseem that this trait has some necessary connexion with superior vital\r\nmanifestations. One of those lowly gelatinous forms, so transparent and\r\ncolourless as to be with difficulty distinguished from the water it floats\r\nin, is not more like its medium in chemical, mechanical, optical, thermal,\r\nand other properties, than it is in the passivity with which it submits to\r\nall the influences and actions brought to bear upon it; while the mammal\r\ndoes not more widely differ from inanimate things in these properties, than\r\nit does in the activity with which it meets surrounding changes by\r\ncompensating changes in itself. And between these extremes, these two kinds\r\nof contrast vary together. So that in proportion as an organism is\r\nphysically like its environment it remains a passive partaker of the\r\nchanges going on in its environment; while in proportion as it is endowed\r\nwith powers of counteracting such changes, it exhibits greater unlikeness\r\nto its environment.[20]\r\n\r\nIf now, from this same point of view, we consider the relation borne to its\r\nenvironment by any superior organism in its successive stages, we find an\r\nanalogous series of contrasts. Of course in respect of degrees of\r\n_structure_ the parallelism is complete. The difference, at first small,\r\nbetween the little-structured germ and the little-structured inorganic\r\nworld, necessarily becomes greater, step by step, as the differentiations\r\nof the germ become more numerous and definite.  How of _form_ the like\r\nholds is equally manifest. The sphere, which is the point of departure\r\ncommon to all organisms, is the most generalized of figures; and one that\r\nis, under various circumstances, assumed by inorganic matter. But as it\r\ndevelops it loses all likeness to inorganic objects in the environment; and\r\neventually becomes distinct even from nearly all organic objects in its\r\nenvironment.  In _specific gravity_ the alteration, though not very marked,\r\nis still in the same direction. Development being habitually accompanied by\r\na relative decrease in the quantity of water and an increase in the\r\nquantity of constituents that are heavier than water, there results a small\r\naugmentation of relative weight. In power of maintaining a _temperature_\r\nabove that of surrounding things, the differentiation from the environment\r\nthat accompanies development is marked. All ova are absolutely dependent\r\nfor their heat on external sources. The mammalian young one is, during its\r\nuterine life, dependent on the maternal heat; and at birth has but a\r\npartial power of making good the loss by radiation. But as it advances in\r\ndevelopment it gains an ability to maintain a constant temperature above\r\nthat of surrounding things: so becoming markedly unlike them. Lastly, in\r\n_self-mobility_ this increasing contrast is no less decided. Save in a few\r\naberrant tribes, chiefly parasitic, we find the general fact to be that the\r\nlocomotive power, totally absent or very small at the outset, increases\r\nwith the advance towards maturity. The more highly developed the organism\r\nbecomes, the stronger grows the contrast between its activity and the\r\ninertness of the objects amid which it moves.\r\n\r\nThus we may say that the development of an individual organism, is at the\r\nsame time a differentiation of its parts from each other, and a\r\ndifferentiation of the consolidated whole from the environment; and that in\r\nthe last as in the first respect, there is a general analogy between the\r\nprogression of an individual organism and the progression from the lowest\r\norders of organisms to the highest orders. It may be remarked that some\r\nkinship seems to exist between these generalizations and the doctrine of\r\nSchelling, that Life is the tendency to individuation. For evidently, in\r\nbecoming more distinct from one another and from their environment,\r\norganisms acquire more marked individualities. As far as I can gather from\r\noutlines of his philosophy, however, Schelling entertained this conception\r\nin a general and transcendental sense, rather than in a special and\r\nscientific one.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 54. Deductive interpretations of these general facts of development, in\r\nso far as they are possible, must be postponed until we arrive at the\r\nfourth and fifth divisions of this work. There are, however, one or two\r\ngeneral aspects of these inductions which may be here conveniently dealt\r\nwith deductively.\r\n\r\nGrant that each organism is at the outset relatively homogeneous and that\r\nwhen complete it is relatively heterogeneous, and it necessarily follows\r\nthat development is a change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous--a\r\nchange during which there must be gone through all the gradations of\r\nheterogeneity that lie between these extremes. If, again, there is at first\r\nindefiniteness and at last definiteness, the transition cannot but be from\r\nthe one to the other of these through all intermediate degrees of\r\ndefiniteness. Further, if the parts, originally incoherent or uncombined,\r\neventually become relatively coherent or combined, there must be a\r\ncontinuous increase of coherence or combination.  Hence the general truth\r\nthat development is a change from incoherent, indefinite homogeneity, to\r\ncoherent, definite heterogeneity, becomes a self-evident one when\r\nobservation has shown us the state in which organisms begin and the state\r\nin which they end.\r\n\r\nJust in the same way that the growth of an entire organism is carried on by\r\nabstracting from the environment substances like those composing the\r\norganism; so the production of each organ within the organism is carried on\r\nby abstracting from the substances contained in the organism, those\r\nrequired by this particular organ. Each organ at the expense of the\r\norganism as a whole, integrates with itself certain kinds and proportions\r\nof the matters circulating around it; in the same way that the organism as\r\na whole, integrates with itself certain kinds and proportions of matters at\r\nthe expense of the environment as a whole. So that the organs are\r\nqualitatively differentiated from each other, in a way analogous to that by\r\nwhich the entire organism is qualitatively differentiated from things\r\naround it. Evidently this selective assimilation illustrates the general\r\ntruth, set forth and illustrated in _First Principles_, that like units\r\ntend to segregate. It illustrates, moreover, the further aspect of this\r\ngeneral truth, that the pre-existence of a mass of certain units produces a\r\ntendency for diffused units of the same kind to aggregate with this mass\r\nrather than elsewhere. It has been shown of particular salts, A and B,\r\nco-existing in a solution not sufficiently concentrated to crystallize,\r\nthat if a crystal of the salt A be put into the solution, it will increase\r\nby uniting with itself the dissolved atoms of the salt A; and that\r\nsimilarly, though there otherwise takes place no deposition of the salt B,\r\nyet if a crystal of the salt B is placed in the solution, it will exercise\r\na coercive force on the diffused atoms of this salt, and grow at their\r\nexpense. Probably much organic assimilation occurs in the same way.\r\nParticular parts of the organism are composed of special units or have the\r\nfunction of secreting special units, which are ever present in them in\r\nlarge quantities. The fluids circulating through the body contain special\r\nunits of this same order. And these diffused units are continually being\r\ndeposited along with the groups of like units that already exist. How\r\npurely physical are the causes of this selective assimilation, is, indeed,\r\nshown by the fact that abnormal constituents of the blood are segregated in\r\nthe same way. The chalky deposits of gout beginning at certain points,\r\ncollect more and more around those points. And similarly in numerous\r\npustular diseases. Where the component units of an organ, or some of them,\r\ndo not exist as such in the circulating fluids, but are formed out of\r\nelements or compounds that exist separately in the circulating fluids, the\r\nprocess of differential assimilation must be of a more complex kind. Still,\r\nhowever, it seems not impossible that it is carried on in an analogous way.\r\nIf there be an aggregate of compound atoms, each of which contains the\r\nconstituents A, B, C; and if round this aggregate the constituents A and B\r\nand C are diffused in uncombined states; it may be suspected that the\r\ncoercive force of these aggregated compound atoms A, B, C, may not only\r\nbring into union with themselves adjacent compound atoms A, B, C, but may\r\ncause the adjacent constituents A and B and C to unite into such compound\r\natoms, and then aggregate with the mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II^A.\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE.[21]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 54a. As, in the course of evolution, we rise from the smallest to the\r\nlargest aggregates by a process of integration, so do we rise by a process\r\nof differentiation from the simplest to the most complex aggregates. The\r\ninitial types of life are at once extremely small and almost structureless.\r\nPassing over those which swarm in the air, the water, and the soil, and are\r\nnow some of them found to be causes of diseases, we may set out with those\r\nordinarily called _Protozoa_ and _Protophyta_: the lowest of which,\r\nhowever, are either at once plants and animals, or are now one and now the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThat the first living things were minute portions of simple protoplasm is\r\nimplied by the general theory of Evolution; but we have no evidence that\r\nsuch portions exist now. Even admitting that there are protoplasts (using\r\nthis word to include plant and animal types) which are without nuclei,\r\nstill they are not homogeneous--they are granular. Whether a nucleus is\r\nalways present is a question still undecided; but in any case the types\r\nfrom which it is absent are extremely exceptional. Thus the most general\r\nstructural traits of protoplasts are--the possession of an internal part,\r\nmorphologically central though often not centrally situated, a general mass\r\nof protoplasm surrounding it, and an inclosing differentiated portion in\r\ncontact with the environment. These essential elements are severally\r\nsubject to various complications.\r\n\r\nIn some simple types the limiting layer or cortical substance can scarcely\r\nbe said to exist as a separate element. The exoplasm, distinguished from\r\nthe endoplasm by absence or paucity of granules, is continually changing\r\nplaces with it by the sending out of pseudopodia which are presently drawn\r\nback into the general mass: the inner and outer, being unsettled in\r\nposition, are not permanently differentiated. Then we have types,\r\nexemplified by _Lithamoeba_, constituted of protoplasm covered by a\r\ndistinct pellicle, which in sundry groups becomes an outer shell of various\r\nstructure: now jelly-like, now of cellulose, now siliceous or calcareous.\r\nWhile here this envelope has a single opening, there it is perforated all\r\nover--a fenestrated shell. In some cases an external layer is formed of\r\nagglutinated sand-particles; in others of imbricated plates, as in\r\nCoccospheres; and in many others radiating spicules stand out on all sides.\r\nThroughout sundry classes the exoplasm develops cilia, by the wavings of\r\nwhich the creatures are propelled through the water--cilia which may be\r\neither general or local. And then this cortical layer, instead of being\r\nspherical or spheroidal, may become plano-spiral, cyclical, crosier-shaped,\r\nand often many-chambered; whence there is a transition to colonies.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the inclosed protoplasm, at first little more than a network or\r\nfoamwork containing granules and made irregular by objects drawn in as\r\nnutriment, becomes variously complicated. In some low types its continuity\r\nis broken by motionless, vacant spaces, but in higher types there are\r\ncontractile vacuoles slowly pulsing, and, as we may suppose, moving the\r\ncontained liquid hither and thither; while there are types having many\r\npassive vacuoles along with a few active ones. In some varieties the\r\nprotruded parts, or pseudopodia, into which the protoplasm continually\r\nshapes itself, are comparatively short and club-shaped; in others they are\r\nlong and fine filaments which anastomose, so forming a network running here\r\nand there into little pools of protoplasm. Then there are kinds in which\r\nthe protoplasm streams up and down the protruding spicules: sometimes\r\ninside of them, sometimes outside. Always, too, there is included in the\r\nprotoplasm a small body known as a centrosome.\r\n\r\nLastly, we have the innermost element, considered the essential\r\nelement--the nucleus. According to Prof. Lankester, it is absent from\r\n_Archerina_, and there are types in which it is made visible only by the\r\naid of special reagents. Ordinarily it is marked off from the surrounding\r\nprotoplasm by a delicate membrane, just as the protoplasm itself is marked\r\noff by the exoplasm from the environment. Most commonly there is a single\r\nnucleus, but occasionally there are many, and sometimes there is a chief\r\none with minor ones. Moreover, within the nucleus itself there have of late\r\nyears been discovered remarkable structural elements which undergo\r\ncomplicated changes.\r\n\r\nThese brief statements indicate only the most general traits of an immense\r\nvariety of structures--so immense a variety that Prof. Lankester, in\r\ndistinguishing the classes, sub-classes, orders, and genera in the briefest\r\nway, occupies 37 quarto pages of small type. And to give a corresponding\r\naccount of _Protophyta_ would require probably something like equal space.\r\nThus these living things, so minute that unaided vision fails to disclose\r\nthem, constitute a world exhibiting varieties of structure which it\r\nrequires the devotion of a life to become fully acquainted with.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 54b. If higher forms of life have arisen from lower forms by evolution,\r\nthe implication is that there must once have existed, if there do not still\r\nexist, transitional forms; and there follows the comment that there _do_\r\nstill exist transitional forms.  Both in the plant-world and in the\r\nanimal-world there are types in which we see little more than simple\r\nassemblages of _Protophyta_ or of _Protozoa_--types in which the units,\r\nthough coherent, are not differentiated but constitute a uniform mass. In\r\ntreating of structure we are not here concerned with these unstructured\r\ntypes, but may pass on to those aggregates of protoplasts which show us\r\ndifferentiated parts--_Metaphyta_ and _Metazoa_: economizing space by\r\nlimiting our attention chiefly to the last.\r\n\r\nWhen, half a century ago, some currency was given to the statement that all\r\nkinds of organisms, plant and animal, which our unaided eyes disclose, are\r\nseverally composed of myriads of living units, some of them partially, if\r\nnot completely, independent, and that thus a man is a vast nation of minute\r\nindividuals of which some are relatively passive and others relatively\r\nactive, the statement met, here with incredulity and there with a shudder.\r\nBut what was then thought a preposterous assertion has now come to be an\r\naccepted truth.\r\n\r\nAlong with gradual establishment of this truth has gone gradual\r\nmodification in the form under which it was originally asserted. If some\r\ninhabitant of another sphere were to describe one of our towns as composed\r\nexclusively of houses, saying nothing of the contained beings who had built\r\nthem and lived in them, we should say that he had made a profound error in\r\nrecognizing only the inanimate elements of the town and disregarding the\r\nanimate elements. Early histologists made an analogous error. Plants and\r\nanimals were found to consist of minute members, each of which appeared to\r\nbe simply a wall inclosing a cavity--a cell. But further investigation\r\nproved that the content of the cell, presently distinguished as protoplasm,\r\nis its essential living part, and that the cell-wall, when present, is\r\nproduced by it. Thus the unit of composition is a protoplast, usually\r\nenclosed, with its contained nucleus and centrosome.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 54c. As above implied, the individualities of the units are not wholly\r\nlost in the individuality of the aggregate, but continue, some of them, to\r\nbe displayed in various degrees: the great majority of them losing their\r\nindividualities more and more as the type of the aggregate becomes higher.\r\n\r\nIn a slightly organized Metazoon like the sponge, the subordination is but\r\nsmall. Only those members of the aggregate which, flattened and united\r\ntogether, form the outer layer and those which become metamorphosed into\r\nspicules, have entirely lost their original activities. Of the rest nearly\r\nall, lining the channels which permeate the mass, and driving onwards the\r\ncontained sea-water by the motions of their whip-like appendages,\r\nsubstantially retain their separate lives; and beyond these there exist in\r\nthe gelatinous substance lying between the inner and outer layers, which is\r\nregarded as homologous with a mesoderm, amoeba-form protoplasts which move\r\nabout from place to place.\r\n\r\nRelations between the aggregate and the units which are in this case\r\npermanent, are in other cases temporary: characterizing early stages of\r\nembryonic development. For example, drawings of Echinoderm larvæ at an\r\nearly stage, show us the potential independence of all the cells forming\r\nthe blastosphere; for in the course of further development some of these\r\nresume the primitive amoeboid state, migrate through the internal space,\r\nand presently unite to form certain parts of the growing structures. But\r\nwith the progress of organization independence of this kind diminishes.\r\n\r\nConverse facts are presented after development has been completed; for with\r\nthe commencement of reproduction we everywhere see more or less resumption\r\nof individual life among the units, or some of them. It is a trait of\r\ntransitional types between _Protozoa_ and _Metazoa_ to lead an aggregate\r\nlife as a plasmodium, and then for this to break up into its members, which\r\nfor a time lead individual lives as generative agents; and sundry low kinds\r\nof plants possessing small amounts of structure, have generative\r\nelements--zoospores and spermatozoids--which show us a return to unit life.\r\nNor, indeed, are we shown this only in the lowest plants; for it has\r\nrecently been found that in certain of the higher plants--even in\r\nPhænogams--spermatozoids are produced. That is to say, the units resume\r\nactive lives at places where the controlling influence of the aggregate is\r\nfailing; for, as we shall hereafter see, places at which generation\r\ncommences answer to this description.\r\n\r\nThese different kinds of evidence jointly imply that the individual lives\r\nof the units are subordinate to the general life in proportion as this is\r\nhigh. Where the organism is very inferior in type the unit-life remains\r\npermanently conspicuous. In some superior types there is a display of\r\nunit-life during embryonic stages in which the co-ordinating action of the\r\naggregate is but incipient. With the advance of development the unit-life\r\ndiminishes; but still, in plants, recommences where the disintegrating\r\nprocess which initiates generation shows the coercive power of the\r\norganization to have become small.\r\n\r\nEven in the highest types, however, and even when they are fully developed,\r\nunit-life does not wholly disappear: it is clearly shown in ourselves. I do\r\nnot refer simply to the fact that, as throughout the animal kingdom at\r\nlarge and a considerable part of the vegetal kingdom, the male generative\r\nelements are units which have resumed the primitive independent life, but I\r\nrefer to a much more general fact. In that part of the organism which,\r\nbeing fundamentally an aqueous medium, is in so far like the aqueous medium\r\nin which ordinary protozoon life is carried on, we find an essentially\r\nprotozoon life. I refer of course to the blood. Whether the tendency of the\r\nred corpuscles (which are originally developed from amoeba-like cells) to\r\naggregate into _rouleaux_ is to be taken as showing life in them, may be\r\nleft an open question. It suffices that the white corpuscles or leucocytes,\r\nretaining the primitive amoeboid character, exhibit individual activities:\r\nsend out prolongations like pseudopodia, take in organic particles as food,\r\nand are independently locomotive. Though far less numerous than the red\r\ncorpuscles, yet, as ten thousand are contained in a cubic millimetre of\r\nblood--a mass less than a pin's head--it results that the human body is\r\npervaded throughout all its blood-vessels by billions of these separately\r\nliving units. In the lymph, too, which also fulfils the requirements of\r\nliquidity, these amoeboid units are found. Then we have the curious\r\ntransitional stage in which units partially imbedded and partially free\r\ndisplay a partial unit-life. These are the ciliated epithelium-cells,\r\nlining the air-passages and covering sundry of the mucous membranes which\r\nhave more remote connexions with the environment, and covering also the\r\nlining membranes of certain main canals and chambers in the nervous system.\r\nThe inner parts of these unite with their fellows to form an epithelium,\r\nand the outer parts of them, immersed either in liquid or semi-liquid\r\n(mucus), bear cilia that are in constant motion and \"produce a current of\r\nfluid over the surface they cover:\" thus simulating in their positions and\r\nactions the cells lining the passages ramifying through a sponge. The\r\npartially independent lives of these units is further seen in the fact that\r\nafter being detached they swim about in water for a time by the aid of\r\ntheir cilia.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 54d. But in the _Metazoa_ and _Metaphyta_ at large, the associated units\r\nare, with the exceptions just indicated, completely subordinated. The\r\nunit-life is so far lost in the aggregate life that neither locomotion nor\r\nthe relative motion of parts remains; and neither in shape nor composition\r\nis there resemblance to protozoa. Though in many cases the internal\r\nprotoplasm continues to carry on vital processes subserving the needs of\r\nthe aggregate, in others vital processes of an independent kind appear to\r\ncease.\r\n\r\nIt will naturally be supposed that after recognizing this fundamental trait\r\ncommon to all types of organisms above the _Protozoa_ and _Protophyta_, the\r\nnext step in an account of structure must be a description of their organs,\r\nvariously formed and combined--if not in detail yet in their general\r\ncharacters. This, however, is an error. There are certain truths of\r\nstructure higher in generality than any which can be alleged of organs. We\r\nshall see this if we compare organs with one another.\r\n\r\nHere is a finger stiffened by its small bones and yet made flexible by the\r\nuniting joints. There is a femur which helps its fellow to support the\r\nweight of the body; and there again is a rib which, along with others,\r\nforms a protective box for certain of the viscera. Dissection reveals a set\r\nof muscles serving to straighten and bend the fingers, certain other\r\nmuscles that move the legs, and some inconspicuous muscles which,\r\ncontracting every two or three seconds, slightly raise the ribs and aid in\r\ninflating the lungs. That is to say, fingers, legs, and chest possess\r\ncertain structures in common. There is in each case a dense substance\r\ncapable of resisting stress and a contractile substance capable of moving\r\nthe dense substance to which it is attached. Hence, then, we have first to\r\ngive an account of these and other chief elements which, variously joined\r\ntogether, form the different organs: we have to observe the general\r\ncharacters of _tissues_.\r\n\r\nOn going back to the time when the organism begins with a single cell, then\r\nbecomes a spherical cluster of cells, and then exhibits differences in the\r\nmodes of aggregation of these cells, the first conspicuous rise of\r\nstructure (limiting ourselves to animals) is the formation of three layers.\r\nOf these the first is, at the outset and always, the superficial layer in\r\ndirect contact with the environment. The second, being originally a part of\r\nthe first, is also in primitive types in contact with the environment, but,\r\nbeing presently introverted, forms the rudiment of the food-cavity; or,\r\notherwise arising in higher types, is in contact with the yelk or food\r\nprovided by the parent. And the third, presently formed between these two,\r\nconsists at the outset of cells derived from them imbedded in an\r\nintercellular substance of jelly-like consistence. Hence originate the\r\ngreat groups classed as epithelium-tissue, connective tissue (including\r\nosseous tissue), muscular tissue, nervous tissue. These severally contain\r\nsub-kinds, each of which is a complex of differentiated cells. Being brief,\r\nand therefore fitted for the present purposes, the sub-classification given\r\nby Prof. R. Hertwig may here be quoted;--\r\n\r\n  \"The physiological character of epithelia is given in the fact that they\r\n  cover the surfaces of the body, their morphological character in that\r\n  they consist of closely compressed cells united only by a cementing\r\n  substance.\r\n\r\n  \"According to their further functional character epithelia are divided\r\n  into glandular epithelia (unicellular and multicellular glands), sensory,\r\n  germinal, and pavement epithelia.\r\n\r\n  \"According to the structure are distinguished one-layered (cubical,\r\n  cylindrical, pavement epithelia) and many-layered epithelia, ciliated and\r\n  flagellated epithelia, epithelia with or without cuticle.\r\n\r\n  \"The physiological character of the connective tissues rests upon the\r\n  fact that they fill up spaces between other tissues in the interior of\r\n  the body.\r\n\r\n  \"The morphological character depends upon the presence of the\r\n  intercellular substance.\r\n\r\n  \"According to the quantity and the structure of the intercellular\r\n  substance the connective substances are divided into (1) cellular (with\r\n  little intercellular substance); (2) homogeneous; (3) fibrillar\r\n  connective tissue; (4) cartilage; (5) bone.\r\n\r\n  \"The physiological character of muscular tissue is contained in the\r\n  increased capacity for contraction.\r\n\r\n  \"The morphological character is found in the fact that the cells have\r\n  secreted muscle-substance.\r\n\r\n  \"According to the nature of the muscle-substance are distinguished smooth\r\n  and cross-striated muscle-fibres.\r\n\r\n  \"According to the character and derivation of the cells\r\n  (muscle-corpuscles) the musculature is divided into epithelial\r\n  (epithelial muscle-cells, primary bundles) and connective-tissue muscle\r\n  cells (contractile fibre-cells).\r\n\r\n  \"The physiological character of nervous tissue rests upon the\r\n  transmission of sensory stimuli and voluntary impulses, and upon the\r\n  co-ordination of these into unified psychic activity.\r\n\r\n  \"The conduction takes place by means of nerve-fibres (non-medullated and\r\n  medullated fibrils and bundles of fibrils); the co-ordination of stimuli\r\n  by means of ganglion-cells (bipolar, multipolar ganglion-cells).\"\r\n  (_General Principles of Zoology_, pp. 117-8.)\r\n\r\nBut now concerning cells out of which, variously modified, obscured, and\r\nsometimes obliterated, tissues are formed, we have to note a fact of much\r\nsignificance. Along with the cell-doctrine as at first held, when attention\r\nwas given to the cell itself rather than to its contents, there went the\r\nbelief that each of these morphological units is structurally separate from\r\nits neighbours. But since establishment of the modern view that the\r\nessential element is the contained protoplasm, histologists have discovered\r\nthat there are protoplasmic connexions between the contents of adjacent\r\ncells. Though cursorily observed at earlier dates, it was not until some\r\ntwenty years ago that in plant-tissues these were clearly shown to pass\r\nthrough openings in the cell-walls. It is said that in some cases the\r\nopenings are made, and the junctions established, by a secondary process;\r\nbut the implication is that usually these living links are left between\r\nmultiplying protoplasts; so that from the outset the protoplasm pervading\r\nthe whole plant maintains its continuity. More recently sundry zoologists\r\nhave alleged that a like continuity exists in animals. Especially has this\r\nbeen maintained by Mr. Adam Sedgwick. Numerous observations made on\r\ndeveloping ova of fishes have led him to assert that in no case do the\r\nmultiplying cells so-called--blastomeres and their progeny--become entirely\r\nseparate. Their fission is in all cases incomplete. A like continuity has\r\nbeen found in the embryos of many Arthropods, and more recently in the\r\nsegmenting eggs and blastulæ of Echinoderms. The _syncytium_ thus formed is\r\nheld by Mr. Sedgwick to be maintained in adult life, and in this belief he\r\nis in agreement with sundry others. Bridges of protoplasm have been seen\r\nbetween epithelium-cells, and it is maintained that cartilage-cells,\r\nconnective tissue cells, the cells forming muscle-fibres, as well as\r\nnerve-cells, have protoplasmic unions. Nay, some even assert that an ovum\r\npreserves a protoplasmic connexion with the matrix in which it develops.\r\n\r\nA corollary of great significance may here be drawn. It has been observed\r\nthat within a vegetal cell the strands of protoplasm stretched in this or\r\nthat direction contain moving granules, showing that the strands carry\r\ncurrents. It has also been observed that when the fission of a protozoon is\r\nso nearly complete that its two halves remain connected only by a thread,\r\ncurrents of protoplasm move through this thread, now one way now the other.\r\nThe inference fairly to be drawn is that such currents pass also through\r\nthe strands which unite the protoplasts forming a tissue. What must happen?\r\nSo long as adjacent cells with their contents are subject to equal\r\npressures no tendency to redistribution of the protoplasm exists, and there\r\nmay then occur the action sometimes observed inside the strands within a\r\ncell: currents with their contained granules moving in opposite directions.\r\nBut if the cells forming a portion of tissue are subject to greater\r\npressure than the cells around, their contained protoplasm must be forced\r\nthrough the connecting threads into these surrounding cells. Every change\r\nof pressure at every point must cause movements and counter-movements of\r\nthis kind. Now in the _Metazoa_ at large, or at least in all exhibiting\r\nrelative motions of parts, and especially in all which are capable of rapid\r\nlocomotion, such changes of pressure are everywhere and always taking\r\nplace. The contraction of a muscle, besides compressing its components,\r\ncompresses neighbouring tissues; and every instant contractions and\r\nrelaxations of muscles go on throughout the limbs and body during active\r\nexertion. Moreover, each attitude--standing, sitting, lying down, turning\r\nover--entails a different set of pressures, both of the parts on one\r\nanother and on the ground; and those partial arrests of motion which result\r\nfrom sitting down the feet alternately when running, send jolts or waves of\r\nvarying pressure through the body. The vital actions, too, have kindred\r\neffects. An inspiration alters the stress on the tissues throughout a\r\nconsiderable part of the trunk, and a heart-beat propels, down to the\r\nsmallest arteries, waves which slightly strain the tissues at large. The\r\ncomponent cells, thus subject to mechanical disturbances, small and great,\r\nperpetual and occasional, are ever having protoplasm forced into them and\r\nforced out of them. There are gurgitations and regurgitations which, if\r\nthey do not constitute a circulation properly so called, at least imply an\r\nunceasing redistribution. And the implication is that in the course of\r\ndays, weeks, months, years, each portion of protoplasm visits every part of\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nWithout here stating specifically the bearings of these inferences upon the\r\nproblems of heredity, it will be manifest that certain difficulties they\r\npresent are in a considerable degree diminished.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 54e. Returning from this parenthetical discussion to the subject of\r\nstructure, we have to observe that besides facts presented by tissues and\r\nfacts presented by organs, there are certain facts, less general than the\r\none and more general than the other, which must now be noted. In the order\r\nof decreasing generality an account of organs should be preceded by an\r\naccount of systems of organs. Some of these, as the muscular system and the\r\nosseous system, are co-extensive with tissues, but others of them are not.\r\nThe nervous system, for example, contains more than one kind of tissue and\r\nis constituted of many different structures: besides afferent and efferent\r\nnerves there are the ganglia immediately controlling the viscera, and there\r\nare the spinal and cerebral masses, the last of which is divisible into\r\nnumerous unlike parts. Then we have the vascular system made up of the\r\nheart, arteries, veins, and capillaries. The lymphatic system, too, with\r\nits scattered glands and ramifying channels has to be named. And then, not\r\nforgetting the respiratory system with its ancillary appliances, we have\r\nthe highly heterogeneous alimentary system; including a great number of\r\nvariously-constructed organs which work together. On contemplating these\r\nsystems we see their common character to be that while as wholes they\r\ncooperate for the carrying on of the total life, each of them consists of\r\ncooperative parts: there is cooperation within cooperation.\r\n\r\nThere is another general aspect under which structures must be\r\ncontemplated. They are divisible into the universal and the\r\nparticular--those which are everywhere present and those which occupy\r\nspecial places. The blood which a scratch brings out shows us that the\r\nvascular system sends branches into each spot. The sensation accompanying a\r\nscratch proves that the nervous system, too, has there some of its ultimate\r\nfibrils. Unobtrusive, and yet to be found at every point, are the ducts of\r\nthe lymphatic system. And in all parts exists the connective tissue--an\r\ninert tough substance which, running through interspaces, wraps up and\r\nbinds together the other tissues. As is implied by this description, these\r\nstructures stand in contrast with local structures. Here is a bone, there\r\nis a muscle, in this place a gland, in that a sense-organ. Each has a\r\nlimited extent and a particular duty. But through every one of them ramify\r\nbranches of these universal structures. Every one of them has its arteries\r\nand veins and capillaries, its nerves, its lymphatics, its connective\r\ntissue.\r\n\r\nRecognition of this truth introduces what little has here to be said\r\nconcerning organs; for of course in a work limited to principles no\r\ndetailed account of these can be entered upon. This remainder truth is\r\nthat, different as they may be in the rest of their structures, all organs\r\nare alike in certain of their structures. All are furnished with these\r\nappliances for nutrition, depuration and excitation: they have all to be\r\nsustained, all to be stimulated, all to be kept clean. It has finally to be\r\nremarked that the general structures which pervade all the special\r\nstructures at the same time pervade one another. The universal nervous\r\nsystem has everywhere ramifying through it the universal vascular system\r\nwhich feeds it; and the universal vascular system is followed throughout\r\nall its ramifications by special nerves which control it.  The lymphatics\r\nforming a drainage-system run throughout the other systems; and in each of\r\nthese universal systems is present the connective tissue holding their\r\nparts in position.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 54f. So vast and varied a subject as organic structure, even though the\r\ntreatment of it is limited to the enunciation of principles, cannot, of\r\ncourse, be dealt with in the space here assigned. Next to nothing has been\r\nsaid about plant-structures, and in setting forth the leading traits of\r\nanimal-structures the illustrations given have been mostly taken from\r\nhighly-developed creatures. In large measure adumbration rather than\r\nexposition is the descriptive word to be applied.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the reader may carry away certain truths which, exemplified in\r\na few cases, are exemplified more or less fully in all cases. There is the\r\nfundamental fact that the plants and animals with which we are\r\nfamiliar--_Metaphyta_ and _Metazoa_--are formed by the aggregation of units\r\nhomologous with _Protozoa_. These units, often conspicuously showing their\r\nhomology in early embryonic stages, continue some of them to show it\r\nthroughout the lives of the highest type of _Metazoa_, which contain\r\nbillions of units carrying on a protozoon life. Of the protoplasts not thus\r\nactive the great mass, comparatively little transformed in low organisms,\r\nbecome more and more transformed as the ascent to high organisms goes on;\r\nso that, undergoing numerous kinds of metamorphoses, they lose all likeness\r\nto their free homologues, both in shape and composition. The cell-contained\r\nprotoplasts thus variously changed are fused together into tissues in which\r\ntheir individualities are practically lost; but they nevertheless remain\r\nconnected throughout by permeable strands of protoplasm. Arising by\r\ncomplication of the outer and inner layers of the embryo and growing more\r\nunlike as their units become more obscured, these tissues are formed into\r\nsystems, which develop into sets of organs. Some of the resulting\r\nstructures are localized and special but others are everywhere interfused.\r\n\r\nWhile the first named of these facts are displayed in every _Metazoon_, and\r\nwhile the last named are visible only in _Metazoa_ of considerably\r\ndeveloped structures, a gradual transition is shown in intermediate kinds\r\nof _Metazoa_. Of this transition it remains to say that it is effected by\r\nthe progressive development of auxiliary appliances. For example, the\r\nprimitive foot-cavity is a sac with one opening only; then comes a second\r\nopening through which the waste-matter of the food is expelled. The\r\nalimentary canal between these openings is at first practically uniform;\r\nafterwards in a certain part of its wall arise numerous bile-cells; these\r\naccumulating form a hollow prominence; and this, enlarging, becomes in\r\nhigher types a liver, while the hollow becomes its duct. In other gradual\r\nways are formed other appended glands. Meanwhile the canal itself has its\r\nparts differentiated: one being limited to swallowing, another to\r\ntriturating, another to adding various solvents, another to absorbing the\r\nprepared nutriment, another to ejecting the residue. Take again the visual\r\norgan. The earliest form of it is a mere pigment-speck below the surface.\r\nFrom this (saying nothing here of multiple eyes) we rise by successive\r\ncomplications to a retina formed of multitudinous sensory elements, lenses\r\nfor throwing images upon it, a curtain for shutting out more or less light,\r\nmuscles for moving the apparatus about, others for adjusting its focus;\r\nand, finally, added to these, either a nictitating membrane or eyelids for\r\nperpetually wiping its surface, and a set of eyelashes giving notice when a\r\nforeign body is dangerously near. This process of elaborating organs so as\r\nto meet additional requirements by additional parts, is the process pursued\r\nthroughout the body at large.\r\n\r\nOf plant-structures, concerning which so little has been said, it may here\r\nbe remarked that their relative simplicity is due to the simplicity of\r\ntheir relations to food. The food of plants is universally distributed,\r\nwhile that of animals is dispersed. The immediate consequences are that in\r\nthe one case motion and locomotion are superfluous, while in the other case\r\nthey are necessary: the differences in the degrees of structure being\r\nconsequences. Recognizing the locomotive powers of minute _Algæ_ and the\r\nmotions of such other _Algæ_ as _Oscillatoria_, as well as those movements\r\nof leaves and fructifying organs seen in some Phænogams, we may say,\r\ngenerally, that plants are motionless; but that they can nevertheless carry\r\non their lives because they are bathed by the required nutriment in the air\r\nand in the soil. Contrariwise, the nutriment animals require is distributed\r\nthrough space in portions: in some cases near one another and in other\r\ncases wide apart. Hence motion and locomotion are necessitated; and the\r\nimplication is that animals must have organs which render them possible. In\r\nthe first place there must be either limbs or such structures as those\r\nwhich in fish, snakes, and worms move the body along. In the second place,\r\nsince action implies waste, there must be a set of channels to bring\r\nrepairing materials to the moving parts. In the third place there must be\r\nan alimentary system for taking in and preparing these materials. In the\r\nfourth place there must be organs for separating and excreting\r\nwaste-products. All these appliances must be more highly developed in\r\nproportion as the required activity is greater. Then there must be an\r\napparatus for directing the motions and locomotions--a nervous system; and\r\nas fast as these become rapid and complex the nervous system must be\r\nlargely developed, ending in great nervous centres--seats of intelligence\r\nby which the activities at large are regulated. Lastly, underlying all the\r\nstructural contrasts between plants and animals thus originating, there is\r\nthe chemical contrast; since the necessity for that highly nitrogenous\r\nmatter of which animals are formed, is entailed by the necessity for\r\nrapidly evolving the energy producing motion. So that, strange as it seems,\r\nthose chemical, physical, and mental characters of animals which so\r\nprofoundly distinguish them from plants, are all remote results of the\r\ncircumstance that their food is dispersed instead of being everywhere\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nFUNCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 55. Does Structure originate Function, or does Function originate\r\nStructure? is a question about which there has been disagreement. Using the\r\nword Function in its widest signification, as the totality of all vital\r\nactions, the question amounts to this--does Life produce Organization, or\r\ndoes Organization produce Life?\r\n\r\nTo answer this question is not easy, since we habitually find the two so\r\nassociated that neither seems possible without the other; and they appear\r\nuniformly to increase and decrease together. If it be said that the\r\narrangement of organic substances in particular forms, cannot be the\r\nultimate cause of vital changes, which must depend on the properties of\r\nsuch substances; it may be replied that, in the absence of structural\r\narrangements, the forces evolved cannot be so directed and combined as to\r\nsecure that correspondence between inner and outer actions which\r\nconstitutes Life. Again, to the allegation that the vital activity of every\r\ngerm whence an organism arises, is obviously antecedent to the development\r\nof its structures, there is the answer that such germ is not absolutely\r\nstructureless.\r\n\r\nBut in truth this question is not determinable by any evidence now\r\naccessible to us. The very simplest forms of life known (even the\r\nnon-nucleated, if there are any) consist of granulated protoplasm; and\r\ngranulation implies structure. Moreover since each kind of protozoon, even\r\nthe lowest, has its specific mode of development and specific\r\nactivity--even down to bacteria, some kinds of which, otherwise\r\nindistinguishable, are distinguishable by their different reactions on\r\ntheir media--we are obliged to conclude that there must be constitutional\r\ndifferences between the protoplasms they consist of, and this implies\r\nstructural differences. It seems that structure and function must have\r\nadvanced _pari passu_: some difference of function, primarily determined by\r\nsome difference of relation to the environment, initiating a slight\r\ndifference of structure, and this again leading to a more pronounced\r\ndifference of function; and so on through continuous actions and reactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 56. Function falls into divisions of several kinds according to our point\r\nof view. Let us take these divisions in the order of their simplicity.\r\n\r\nUnder Function in its widest sense, are included both the statical and the\r\ndynamical distributions of force which an organism opposes to the forces\r\nbrought to bear on it. In a tree the woody core of trunk and branches, and\r\nin an animal the skeleton, internal or external, may be regarded as\r\npassively resisting the gravity and momentum which tend habitually or\r\noccasionally to derange the requisite relations between the organism and\r\nits environment; and since they resist these forces simply by their\r\ncohesion, their functions may be classed as _statical_. Conversely, the\r\nleaves and sap-vessels in a tree, and those organs which in an animal\r\nsimilarly carry on nutrition and circulation, as well as those which\r\ngenerate and direct muscular motion, must be considered as _dynamical_ in\r\ntheir actions. From another point of view Function is divisible into the\r\n_accumulation of energy_ (latent in food); the _expenditure of energy_\r\n(latent in the tissues and certain matters absorbed by them); and the\r\n_transfer of energy_ (latent in the prepared nutriment or blood) from the\r\nparts which accumulate to the parts which expend. In plants we see little\r\nbeyond the first of these: expenditure being comparatively slight, and\r\ntransfer required mainly to facilitate accumulation. In animals the\r\nfunction of _accumulation_ comprehends those processes by which the\r\nmaterials containing latent energy are taken in, digested, and separated\r\nfrom other materials; the function of _transfer_ comprehends those\r\nprocesses by which these materials, and such others as are needful to\r\nliberate the energies they contain, are conveyed throughout the organism;\r\nand the function of _expenditure_ comprehends those processes by which the\r\nenergy is liberated from these materials and transformed into properly\r\nco-ordinated motions. Each of these three most general divisions includes\r\nseveral more special divisions. The accumulation of energy may be separated\r\ninto _alimentation_ and _aeration_; of which the first is again separable\r\ninto the various acts gone through between prehension of food and the\r\ntransformation of part of it into blood. By the transfer of energy is to be\r\nunderstood what we call _circulation_; if the meaning of circulation be\r\nextended to embrace the duties of both the vascular system and the\r\nlymphatics. Under the head of expenditure of energy come _nervous actions_\r\nand _muscular actions_: though not absolutely co-extensive with expenditure\r\nthese are almost so. Lastly, there are the subsidiary functions which do\r\nnot properly fall within any of these general functions, but subserve them\r\nby removing the obstacles to their performance: those, namely, of\r\n_excretion_ and _exhalation_, whereby waste products are got rid of. Again,\r\ndisregarding their purposes and considering them analytically, the general\r\nphysiologist may consider functions in their widest sense as the\r\ncorrelatives of tissues--the actions of epidermic tissue, cartilaginous\r\ntissue, elastic tissue, connective tissue, osseous tissue, muscular tissue,\r\nnervous tissue, glandular tissue. Once more, physiology in its concrete\r\ninterpretations recognizes special functions as the ends of special\r\norgans--regards the teeth as having the office of mastication; the heart as\r\nan apparatus to propel blood; this gland as fitted to produce one requisite\r\nsecretion and that to produce another; each muscle as the agent of a\r\nparticular motion; each nerve as the vehicle of a special sensation or a\r\nspecial motor impulse.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that dealing with Biology only in its larger aspects,\r\nspecialities of function do not concern us; except in so far as they serve\r\nto illustrate, or to qualify, its generalities.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 57. The first induction to be here set down is a familiar and obvious\r\none; the induction, namely, that complexity of function is the correlative\r\nof complexity of structure. The leading aspects of this truth must be\r\nbriefly noted.\r\n\r\nWhere there are no distinctions of structure there are no distinctions of\r\nfunction. A Rhizopod will serve as an illustration. From the outside of\r\nthis creature, which has not even a limiting membrane, there are protruded\r\nnumerous processes. Originating from any point of the surface, each of\r\nthese may contract again and disappear, or it may touch some fragment of\r\nnutriment which it draws with it, when contracting, into the general\r\nmass--thus serving as hand and mouth; or it may come in contact with its\r\nfellow-processes at a distance from the body and become confluent with\r\nthem; or it may attach itself to an adjacent fixed object, and help by its\r\ncontraction to draw the body into a new position. In brief, this speck of\r\nanimated jelly is at once all stomach, all skin, all mouth, all limb, and\r\ndoubtless, too, all lung. In organisms having a fixed distribution of parts\r\nthere is a concomitant fixed distribution of actions. Among plants we see\r\nthat when, instead of a uniform tissue like that of many _Algæ_, everywhere\r\ndevoted to the same process of assimilation, there arise, as in the higher\r\nplants, root and stem and leaves, there arise correspondingly unlike\r\nprocesses. Still more conspicuously among animals do there result varieties\r\nof function when the originally homogeneous mass is replaced by\r\nheterogeneous organs; since, both singly and by their combinations,\r\nmodified parts generate modified changes. Up to the highest organic types\r\nthis dependence continues manifest; and it may be traced not only under\r\nthis most general form, but also under the more special form that in\r\nanimals having one set of functions developed to more than usual\r\nheterogeneity there is a correspondingly heterogeneous apparatus devoted to\r\nthem. Thus among birds, which have more varied locomotive powers than\r\nmammals, the limbs are more widely differentiated; while the higher\r\nmammals, which rise to more numerous and more involved adjustments of inner\r\nto outer relations than birds, have more complex nervous systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 58. It is a generalization almost equally obvious with the last, that\r\nfunctions, like structures, arise by progressive differentiations. Just as\r\nan organ is first an indefinite rudiment, having nothing but some most\r\ngeneral characteristic in common with the form it is ultimately to take; so\r\na function begins as a kind of action that is like the kind of action it\r\nwill eventually become, only in a very vague way. And in functional\r\ndevelopment, as in structural development, the leading trait thus early\r\nmanifested is followed successively by traits of less and less importance.\r\nThis holds equally throughout the ascending grades of organisms and\r\nthroughout the stages of each organism. Let us look at cases: confining our\r\nattention to animals, in which functional development is better displayed\r\nthan in plants.\r\n\r\nThe first differentiation established separates the two\r\nfundamentally-opposed functions above named--the accumulation of energy and\r\nthe expenditure of energy. Passing over the _Protozoa_ (among which,\r\nhowever, such tribes as present fixed distributions of parts show us\r\nsubstantially the same thing), and commencing with the lowest\r\n_Coelenterata_, where definite tissues make their appearance, we observe\r\nthat the only large functional distinction is between the endoderm, which\r\nabsorbs nutriment, and the ectoderm which, by its own contractions and\r\nthose of the tentacles it bears, produces motion: the contractility being\r\nhowever to some extent shared by the endoderm. That the functions of\r\naccumulation and expenditure are here very incompletely distinguished, may\r\nbe admitted without affecting the position that this is the first\r\nspecialization which begins to appear. These two most general and most\r\nradically-opposed functions become in the _Polyzoa_, much more clearly\r\nmarked-off from each other: at the same time that each of them becomes\r\npartially divided into subordinate functions. The endoderm and ectoderm are\r\nno longer merely the inner and outer walls of the same simple sac into\r\nwhich the food is drawn: but the endoderm forms a true alimentary canal,\r\nseparated from the ectoderm by a peri-visceral cavity, containing the\r\nnutritive matters absorbed from the food. That is to say, the function of\r\naccumulating force is exercised by a part distinctly divided from the part\r\nmainly occupied in expending force: the structure between them, full of\r\nabsorbed nutriment, effecting in a vague way that transfer of force which,\r\nat a higher stage of evolution, becomes a third leading function.\r\nMeanwhile, the endoderm no longer discharges the accumulative function in\r\nthe same way throughout its whole extent; but its different portions,\r\noesophagus, stomach and intestine, perform different portions of this\r\nfunction. And instead of a contractility uniformly diffused through the\r\nectoderm, there have arisen in the intermediate mesoderm some parts which\r\nhave the office of contracting (muscles), and some parts which have the\r\noffice of making them contract (nerves and ganglia). As we pass upwards,\r\nthe transfer of force, hitherto effected quite incidentally, comes to have\r\na special organ. In the ascidian, circulation is produced by a muscular\r\ntube, open at both ends, which, by a wave of contraction passing along it,\r\nsends out at one end the nutrient fluid drawn in at the other; and which,\r\nhaving thus propelled the fluid for a time in one direction, reverses its\r\nmovement and propels it in the opposite direction. By such means does this\r\nrudimentary heart generate alternating currents in the nutriment occupying\r\nthe peri-visceral cavity. How the function of transferring energy, thus\r\nvaguely indicated in these inferior forms, comes afterwards to be the\r\ndefinitely-separated office of a complicated apparatus made up of many\r\nparts, each of which has a particular portion of the general duty, need not\r\nbe described. It is sufficiently manifest that this general function\r\nbecomes more clearly marked-off from the others, at the same time that it\r\nbecomes itself parted into subordinate functions.\r\n\r\nIn a developing embryo, the functions or more strictly the structures which\r\nare to perform them, arise in the same general order. A like primary\r\ndistinction very early appears between the endoderm and the ectoderm--the\r\npart which has the office of accumulating energy, and the part out of which\r\ngrow those organs that are the great expenders of energy. Between these two\r\nthere presently arises the mesoderm in which becomes visible the rudiment\r\nof that vascular system, which has to fulfil the intermediate duty of\r\ntransferring energy. Of these three general functions, that of accumulating\r\nenergy is carried on from the outset: the endoderm, even while yet\r\nincompletely differentiated from the ectoderm, absorbs nutritive matters\r\nfrom the subjacent yelk. The transfer of energy is also to some extent\r\neffected by the rudimentary vascular system, as soon as its central cavity\r\nand attached vessels are sketched out. But the expenditure of energy (in\r\nthe higher animals at least) is not appreciably displayed by those\r\nectodermic and mesodermic structures that are afterwards to be mainly\r\ndevoted to it: there is no sphere for the actions of these parts. Similarly\r\nwith the chief subdivisions of these fundamental functions. The distinction\r\nfirst established separates the office of transforming other energy into\r\nmechanical motion, from the office of liberating the energy to be so\r\ntransformed. While in the layer between endoderm and ectoderm are arising\r\nthe rudiments of the muscular system, there is marked out in the ectoderm\r\nthe rudiment of the nervous system. This indication of structures which are\r\nto share between them the general duty of expending energy, is soon\r\nfollowed by changes that foreshadow further specializations of this general\r\nduty. In the incipient nervous system there begins to arise that contrast\r\nbetween the cerebral mass and the spinal cord, which, in the main, answers\r\nto the division of nervous actions into directive and executive; and, at\r\nthe same time, the appearance of vertebral laminæ foreshadows the\r\nseparation of the osseous system, which has to resist the strains of\r\nmuscular action, from the muscular system, which, in generating motion,\r\nentails these strains. Simultaneously there have been going on similar\r\nactual and potential specializations in the functions of accumulating\r\nenergy and transferring energy. And throughout all subsequent phases the\r\nmethod is substantially the same.\r\n\r\nThis progress from general, indefinite, and simple kinds of action to\r\nspecial, definite, and complex kinds of action, has been aptly termed by\r\nMilne-Edwards, \"the physiological division of labour.\" Perhaps no metaphor\r\ncan more truly express the nature of this advance from vital activity in\r\nits lowest forms to vital activity in its highest forms. And probably the\r\ngeneral reader cannot in any other way obtain so clear a conception of\r\nfunctional development in organisms, as he can by tracing out functional\r\ndevelopment in societies: noting how there first comes a distinction\r\nbetween the governing class and the governed class; how while in the\r\ngoverning class there slowly grow up such differences of duty as the civil,\r\nmilitary, and ecclesiastical, there arise in the governed class fundamental\r\nindustrial differences like those between agriculturists and artizans; and\r\nhow there is a continual multiplication of such specialized occupations and\r\nspecialized shares of each occupation.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 59. Fully to understand this change from homogeneity of function to\r\nheterogeneity of function, which accompanies the change from homogeneity of\r\nstructure to heterogeneity of structure, it is needful to contemplate it\r\nunder a converse aspect. Standing alone, the above exposition conveys an\r\nidea that is both inadequate and erroneous. The divisions and subdivisions\r\nof function, becoming definite as they become multiplied, do not lead to a\r\nmore and more complete independence of functions; as they would do were the\r\nprocess nothing beyond that just described; but by a simultaneous process\r\nthey are rendered more mutually dependent. While in one respect they are\r\nseparating from each other, they are in another respect combining with each\r\nother. At the same time that they are being differentiated they are also\r\nbeing integrated. Some illustrations will make this plain.\r\n\r\nIn animals which display little beyond the primary differentiation of\r\nfunctions, the activity of that part which absorbs nutriment or accumulates\r\nenergy, is not immediately bound up with the activity of that part which,\r\nin producing motion, expends energy. In the higher animals, however, the\r\nperformance of the alimentary functions depends on the performance of\r\nvarious muscular and nervous functions. Mastication and swallowing are\r\nnervo-muscular acts; the rhythmical contractions of the stomach and the\r\nallied vermicular motions of the intestines, result from the reflex\r\nstimulation of certain muscular coats caused by food; the secretion of the\r\nseveral digestive fluids by their respective glands, is due to nervous\r\nexcitation of them; and digestion, besides requiring these special aids, is\r\nnot properly performed in the absence of a continuous discharge of energy\r\nfrom the great nervous centres. Again, the function of transferring\r\nnutriment or latent energy, from part to part, though at first not closely\r\nconnected with the other functions, eventually becomes so. The short\r\ncontractile tube which propels backwards and forwards the blood contained\r\nin the peri-visceral cavity of an ascidian, is neither structurally nor\r\nfunctionally much entangled with the creature's other organs. But on\r\npassing upwards through higher types, in which this simple tube is replaced\r\nby a system of branched tubes, that deliver their contents through their\r\nopen ends into the tissues at distant parts; and on coming to those\r\nadvanced types which have closed arterial and venous systems, ramifying\r\nminutely in every corner of every organ; we find that the vascular\r\napparatus, while it has become structurally interwoven with the whole body,\r\nhas become unable properly to fulfil its office without the help of offices\r\nthat are quite separated from its own. The heart, though mainly automatic\r\nin its actions, is controlled by the nervous system, which takes a share in\r\nregulating the contractions both of the heart and the arteries. On the due\r\ndischarge of the respiratory function, too, the function of circulation is\r\ndirectly dependent: if the aeration of the blood is impeded the vascular\r\nactivity is lowered; and arrest of the one very soon causes stoppage of the\r\nother. Similarly with the duties of the nervo-muscular system. Animals of\r\nlow organization, in which the differentiation and integration of the vital\r\nactions have not been carried far, will move about for a considerable time\r\nafter being eviscerated, or deprived of those appliances by which energy is\r\naccumulated and transferred. But animals of high organization are instantly\r\nkilled by the removal of these appliances, and even by the injury of minor\r\nparts of them: a dog's movements are suddenly brought to an end, by cutting\r\none of the main canals along which the materials that evolve movements are\r\nconveyed. Thus while in well-developed creatures the distinction of\r\nfunctions is very marked, the combination of functions is very close. From\r\ninstant to instant the aeration of blood implies that certain respiratory\r\nmuscles are being made to contract by nervous impulses passing along\r\ncertain nerves; and that the heart is duly propelling the blood to be\r\naerated. From instant to instant digestion proceeds only on condition that\r\nthere is a supply of aerated blood, and a due current of nervous energy\r\nthrough the digestive organs. That the heart of a mammal may act, its\r\nmuscle substance must be continuously fed with an abundant supply of\r\narterial blood.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to find an adequate expression for this double\r\nre-distribution of functions. It is not easy to realize a transformation\r\nthrough which the functions thus become in one sense separated and in\r\nanother sense combined, or even interfused. Here, however, as before, an\r\nanalogy drawn from social organization helps us. If we observe how the\r\nincreasing division of labour in societies is accompanied by a closer\r\nco-operation; and how the agencies of different social actions, while\r\nbecoming in one respect more distinct, become in another respect more\r\nminutely ramified through one another; we shall understand better the\r\nincreasing physiological co-operation that accompanies increasing\r\nphysiological division of labour. Note, for example, that while local\r\ndivisions and classes of the community have been growing unlike in their\r\nseveral occupations, the carrying on of their several occupations has been\r\ngrowing dependent on the due activity of that vast organization by which\r\nsustenance is collected and diffused. During the early stages of social\r\ndevelopment, every small group of people, and often every family, obtained\r\nseparately its own necessaries; but now, for each necessary, and for each\r\nsuperfluity, there exists a combined body of wholesale and retail\r\ndistributors, which brings its branched channels of supply within reach of\r\nall. While each citizen is pursuing a business that does not immediately\r\naim at the satisfaction of his personal wants, his personal wants are\r\nsatisfied by a general agency which brings from all places commodities for\r\nhim and his fellow-citizens--an agency which could not cease its special\r\nduties for a few days, without bringing to an end his own special duties\r\nand those of most others. Consider, again, how each of these differentiated\r\nfunctions is everywhere pervaded by certain other differentiated functions.\r\nMerchants, manufacturers, wholesale distributors of their several species,\r\ntogether with lawyers, bankers, &c., all employ clerks. In clerks we have a\r\nspecialized class dispersed through various other classes; and having its\r\nfunction fused with the different functions of these various other classes.\r\nSimilarly commercial travellers, though having in one sense a separate\r\noccupation, have in another sense an occupation forming part of each of the\r\nmany occupations which it aids. As it is here with the sociological\r\ndivision of labour, so is it with the physiological division of labour\r\nabove described. Just as we see in an advanced community, that while the\r\nmagisterial, the clerical, the medical, the legal, the manufacturing, and\r\nthe commercial activities, have grown distinct, they have yet their\r\nagencies mingled together in every locality; so in a developed organism, we\r\nsee that while the general functions of circulation, secretion, absorption,\r\nexcretion, contraction, excitation, &c., have become differentiated, yet\r\nthrough the ramifications of the systems apportioned to them, they are\r\nclosely combined with one another in every organ.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 60. The physiological division of labour is usually not carried so far as\r\nwholly to destroy the primary physiological community of labour. As in\r\nsocieties the adaptation of special classes to special duties, does not\r\nentirely disable these classes from performing one another's duties on an\r\nemergency; so in organisms, tissues and structures that have become fitted\r\nto the particular offices they have ordinarily to discharge, often remain\r\npartially able to discharge other offices. It has been pointed out by Dr.\r\nCarpenter, that \"in cases where the different functions are highly\r\nspecialized, the general structure retains, more or less, the primitive\r\ncommunity of function which originally characterized it.\" A few instances\r\nwill bring home this generalization.\r\n\r\nThe roots and leaves of plants are widely differentiated in their\r\nfunctions: by the roots, water and mineral substances are absorbed; while\r\nthe leaves take in, and decompose, carbonic acid. Nevertheless, by many\r\nbotanists it is held that some leaves, or parts of them, can absorb water;\r\nand in what are popularly called \"air-plants,\" or at any rate in some kinds\r\nof them, the absorption of water is mainly and in some cases wholly carried\r\non by them and by the stems. Conversely, the underground parts can\r\npartially assume the functions of leaves. The exposed tuber of a potato\r\ndevelops chlorophyll on its surface, and in other cases, as in that of the\r\nturnip, roots, properly so called, do the like. In trees the trunks, which\r\nhave in great measure ceased to produce buds, recommence producing them if\r\nthe branches are cut off; sometimes aerial branches send down roots to the\r\nearth; and under some circumstances the roots, though not in the habit of\r\ndeveloping leaf-bearing organs, send up numerous suckers. When the\r\nexcretion of bile is arrested, part goes to the skin and some to the\r\nkidneys, which presently suffer under their new task. Various examples of\r\nvicarious functions may be found among animals. The excretion of carbonic\r\nacid and absorption of oxygen are mainly performed by the lungs, in\r\ncreatures which have lungs; but in such creatures there continues a certain\r\namount of cutaneous respiration, and in soft-skinned batrachians like the\r\nfrog, this cutaneous respiration is important. Again, when the kidneys are\r\nnot discharging their duties a notable quantity of urea is got rid of by\r\nperspiration. Other instances are supplied by the higher functions. In man\r\nthe limbs, which among lower vertebrates are almost wholly organs of\r\nlocomotion, are specialized into organs of locomotion and organs of\r\nmanipulation. Nevertheless, the human arms and legs do, when needful,\r\nfulfil, to some extent, each other's offices. Not only in childhood and old\r\nage are the arms used for purposes of support, but on occasions of\r\nemergency, as when mountaineering, they are used by men in full vigour. And\r\nthat legs are to a considerable degree capable of performing the duties of\r\narms, is proved by the great amount of manipulatory skill reached by them\r\nwhen the arms are absent. Among the perceptions, too, there are examples of\r\npartial substitution. The deaf Dr. Kitto described himself as having become\r\nexcessively sensitive to vibrations propagated through the body; and as so\r\nhaving gained the power of perceiving, through his general sensations,\r\nthose neighbouring concussions of which the ears ordinarily give notice.\r\nBlind people make hearing perform, in part, the office of vision. Instead\r\nof identifying the positions and sizes of neighbouring objects by the\r\nreflection of light from their surfaces, they do this in a rude way by the\r\nreflection of sound from their surfaces.\r\n\r\nWe see, as we might expect to see, that this power of performing more\r\ngeneral functions, is great in proportion as the organs have been but\r\nlittle adapted to their special functions. Those parts of plants which show\r\nso considerable an ability to discharge each others' offices, are not\r\nwidely unlike in their minute structures. And the tissues which in animals\r\nare to some extent mutually vicarious, are tissues in which the original\r\ncellular composition is still conspicuous. But we do not find evidence that\r\nthe muscular, nervous, or osseous tissues are able in any degree to perform\r\nthose processes which the less differentiated tissues perform. Nor have we\r\nany proof that nerve can partially fulfil the duty of muscle, or muscle\r\nthat of nerve. We must say, therefore, that the ability to resume the\r\nprimordial community of function, varies inversely as the established\r\nspecialization of function; and that it disappears when the specialization\r\nof function becomes great.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 61. Something approaching to _a priori_ reasons may be given for the\r\nconclusions thus reached _a posteriori_. They must be accepted for as much\r\nas they seem worth.\r\n\r\nIt may be argued that on the hypothesis of Evolution, Life necessarily\r\ncomes before organization. On this hypothesis, organic matter in a state of\r\nhomogeneous aggregation must precede organic matter in a state of\r\nheterogeneous aggregation. But since the passing from a structureless state\r\nto a structured state, is itself a vital process, it follows that vital\r\nactivity must have existed while there was yet no structure: structure\r\ncould not else arise. That function takes precedence of structure, seems\r\nalso implied in the definition of Life. If Life is shown by inner actions\r\nso adjusted as to balance outer actions--if the implied energy is the\r\n_substance_ of Life while the adjustment of the actions constitutes its\r\n_form_; then may we not say that the actions to be formed must come before\r\nthat which forms them--that the continuous change which is the basis of\r\nfunction, must come before the structure which brings function into shape?\r\nOr again, since in all phases of Life up to the highest, every advance is\r\nthe effecting of some better adjustment of inner to outer actions; and\r\nsince the accompanying new complexity of structure is simply a means of\r\nmaking possible this better adjustment; it follows that the achievement of\r\nfunction is, throughout, that for which structure arises. Not only is this\r\nmanifestly true where the modification of structure results by reaction\r\nfrom modification of function; but it is also true where a modification of\r\nstructure otherwise produced, apparently initiates a modification of\r\nfunction. For it is only when such so-called spontaneous modification of\r\nstructure subserves some advantageous action, that it is permanently\r\nestablished. If it is a structural modification that happens to facilitate\r\nthe vital activities, \"natural selection\" retains and increases it; but if\r\nnot, it disappears.\r\n\r\nThe connexion which we noted between heterogeneity of structure and\r\nheterogeneity of function--a connexion made so familiar by experience as to\r\nappear scarcely worth specifying--is clearly a necessary one. It follows\r\nfrom the general truth that in proportion to the heterogeneity of any\r\naggregate, is the heterogeneity it will produce in any incident force\r\n(_First Principles_, § 156). The energy continually liberated in the\r\norganism by decomposition, is here the incident force; the functions are\r\nthe variously modified forms produced in its divisions by the organs they\r\npass through; and the more multiform the organs the more multiform must be\r\nthe differentiations of the force passing through them.\r\n\r\nIt follows obviously from this, that if structure progresses from the\r\nhomogeneous, indefinite, and incoherent, to the heterogeneous, definite,\r\nand coherent, so too must function. If the number of different parts in an\r\naggregate must determine the number of differentiations produced in the\r\nenergies passing through it--if the distinctness of these parts from one\r\nanother, must involve distinctness in their reactions, and therefore\r\ndistinctness between the divisions of the differentiated energy; there\r\ncannot but be a complete parallelism between the development of structure\r\nand the development of function. If structure advances from the simple and\r\ngeneral to the complex and special, function must do the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nWASTE AND REPAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 62. Throughout the vegetal kingdom, the processes of Waste and Repair are\r\ncomparatively insignificant in their amounts. Though all parts of plants\r\nsave the leaves, or other parts which are green, give out carbonic acid;\r\nyet this carbonic acid, assuming it to indicate consumption of tissue, or\r\nrather of the protoplasm contained in the tissue, indicates but a small\r\nconsumption. Of course if there is little waste there can be but little\r\nrepair--that is, little of the interstitial repair which restores the\r\nintegrity of parts worn by functional activity. Nor, indeed, is there\r\ndisplayed by plants in any considerable degree, if at all, that other\r\nspecies of repair which consists in the restoration of lost or injured\r\norgans. Torn leaves and the shoots that are shortened by the pruner, do not\r\nreproduce their missing parts; and though when the branch of a tree is cut\r\noff close to the trunk, the place is in course of years covered over, it is\r\nnot by any reparative action in the wounded surface but by the lateral\r\ngrowth of the adjacent bark. Hence, without saying that Waste and Repair do\r\nnot go on at all in plants, we may fitly pass them over as of no\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThere are but slight indications of waste in those lower orders of animals\r\nwhich, by their comparative inactivity, show themselves least removed from\r\nvegetal life.  Actiniæ kept in an aquarium, do not appreciably diminish in\r\nbulk from prolonged abstinence. Even fish, though much more active than\r\nmost other aquatic creatures, appear to undergo but little loss of\r\nsubstance when kept unfed during considerable periods. Reptiles, too,\r\nmaintaining no great temperature, and passing their lives mostly in a state\r\nof torpor, suffer but little diminution of mass by waste. When, however, we\r\nturn to those higher orders of animals which are active and hot-blooded, we\r\nsee that waste is rapid: producing, when unchecked, a notable decrease in\r\nbulk and weight, ending very shortly in death. Besides finding that waste\r\nis inconsiderable in creatures which produce but little insensible and\r\nsensible motion, and that it becomes conspicuous in creatures which produce\r\nmuch insensible and sensible motion; we find that in the same creatures\r\nthere is most waste when most motion is generated. This is clearly proved\r\nby hybernating animals. \"Valentin found that the waking marmot excreted in\r\nthe average 75 times more carbonic acid, and inhaled 41 times more oxygen\r\nthan the same animal in the most complete state of hybernation. The stages\r\nbetween waking and most profound hybernation yielded intermediate figures.\r\nA waking hedgehog yielded about 20.5 times more carbonic acid, and consumed\r\n18.4 times more oxygen than one in the state of hybernation.\"[22] If we\r\ntake these quantities of absorbed oxygen and excreted carbonic acid, as\r\nindicating something like the relative amounts of consumed organic\r\nsubstance, we see that there is a striking contrast between the waste\r\naccompanying the ordinary state of activity, and the waste accompanying\r\ncomplete quiescence and reduced temperature. This difference is still more\r\ndefinitely shown by the fact, that the mean daily loss from starvation in\r\nrabbits and guinea-pigs, bears to that from hybernation, the proportion of\r\n18.3:1. Among men and domestic animals, the relation between degree of\r\nwaste and amount of expended energy, though one respecting which there is\r\nlittle doubt, is less distinctly demonstrable; since waste is not allowed\r\nto go on uninterfered with. We have, however, in the lingering lives of\r\ninvalids who are able to take scarcely any nutriment but are kept warm and\r\nstill, an illustration of the extent to which waste diminishes as the\r\nexpenditure of energy declines.\r\n\r\nBesides the connexion between the waste of the organism as a whole and the\r\nproduction of sensible and insensible motion by the organism as a whole,\r\nthere is a traceable connexion between the waste of special parts and the\r\nactivities of such special parts. Experiments have shown that \"the starving\r\npigeon daily consumes in the average 40 times more muscular substance that\r\nthe marmot in the state of torpor, and only 11 times more fat, 33 times\r\nmore of the tissue of the alimentary canal, 18.3 times more liver, 15 times\r\nmore lung, 5 times more skin.\" That is to say, in the hybernating animal\r\nthe parts least consumed are the almost totally quiescent motor-organs, and\r\nthe part most consumed is the hydro-carbonaceous deposit serving as a store\r\nof energy; whereas in the pigeon, similarly unsupplied with food but awake\r\nand active, the greatest loss takes place in the motor-organs.  The\r\nrelation between special activity and special waste, is illustrated, too,\r\nin the daily experiences of all: not indeed in the amount of decrease of\r\nthe active parts in bulk or weight, for this we have no means of\r\nascertaining; but in the diminished ability of such parts to perform their\r\nfunctions. That legs exerted for many hours in walking and arms long\r\nstrained in rowing, lose their powers--that eyes become enfeebled by\r\nreading or writing without intermission--that concentrated attention,\r\nunbroken by rest, so prostrates the brain as to incapacitate it for\r\nthinking; are familiar truths. And though we have no direct evidence to\r\nthis effect, there is little danger in concluding that muscles exercised\r\nuntil they ache or become stiff, and nerves of sense rendered weary or\r\nobtuse by work, are organs so much wasted by action as to be partially\r\nincompetent.\r\n\r\nRepair is everywhere and always making up for waste. Though the two\r\nprocesses vary in their relative rates both are constantly going on. Though\r\nduring the active, waking state of an animal waste is in excess of repair,\r\nyet repair is in progress; and though during sleep repair is in excess of\r\nwaste, yet some waste is necessitated by the carrying on of certain\r\nnever-ceasing functions. The organs of these never-ceasing functions\r\nfurnish, indeed, the most conclusive proofs of the simultaneity of repair\r\nand waste. Day and night the heart never stops beating, but only varies in\r\nthe rapidity and vigour of its beats; and hence the loss of substance which\r\nits contractions from moment to moment entail, must from moment to moment\r\nbe made good. Day and night the lungs dilate and collapse; and the muscles\r\nwhich make them do this must therefore be kept in a state of integrity by a\r\nrepair which keeps pace with waste, or which alternately falls behind and\r\ngets in advance of it to a very slight extent.\r\n\r\nOn a survey of the facts we see, as we might expect to see, that the\r\nprogress of repair is most rapid when activity is most reduced. Assuming\r\nthat the organs which absorb and circulate nutriment are in proper order,\r\nthe restoration of the body to a state of integrity, after the\r\ndisintegration consequent on expenditure of energy, is proportionate to the\r\ndiminution in expenditure of energy. Thus we all know that those who are in\r\nhealth, feel the greatest return of vigour after profound sleep--after\r\ncomplete cessation of motion. We know that a night during which the\r\nquiescence, bodily and mental, has been less decided, is usually not\r\nfollowed by that spontaneous overflow of energy which indicates a high\r\nstate of efficiency throughout the organism. We know, again, that\r\nlong-continued recumbency, even with wakefulness (providing the wakefulness\r\nis not the result of disorder), is followed by a certain renewal of\r\nstrength; though a renewal less than that which would have followed the\r\ngreater inactivity of slumber. We know, too, that when exhausted by labour,\r\nsitting brings a partial return of vigour. And we also know that after the\r\nviolent exertion of running, a lapse into the less violent exertion of\r\nwalking, results in a gradual disappearance of that prostration which the\r\nrunning produced. This series of illustrations conclusively proves that the\r\nrebuilding of the organism is ever making up for the pulling down of it\r\ncaused by action; and that the effect of this rebuilding becomes more\r\nmanifest, in proportion as the pulling down is less rapid. From each\r\ndigested meal there is every few hours absorbed into the mass of prepared\r\nnutriment circulating through the body, a fresh supply of the needful\r\norganic compounds; and from the blood, thus occasionally re-enriched, the\r\norgans through which it passes are ever taking up materials to replace the\r\nmaterials used up in the discharge of functions. During activity the\r\nreintegration falls in arrear of the disintegration; until, as a\r\nconsequence, there presently comes a general state of functional languor;\r\nending, at length, in a quiescence which permits the reintegration to\r\nexceed the disintegration, and restore the parts to their state of\r\nintegrity. Here, as wherever there are antagonistic actions, we see\r\nrhythmical divergences on opposite sides of the medium state--changes which\r\nequilibrate each other by their alternate excesses. (_First Principles_,\r\n§§ 85, 173.)\r\n\r\nIllustrations are not wanting of special repair that is similarly ever in\r\nprogress, and similarly has intervals during which it falls below waste and\r\nrises above it. Every one knows that a muscle, or a set of muscles,\r\ncontinuously strained, as by holding out a weight at arm's length, soon\r\nloses its power; and that it recovers its power more or less fully after a\r\nshort rest. The several organs of the special sensations yield us like\r\nexperiences. Strong tastes, powerful odours, loud sounds, temporarily unfit\r\nthe nerves impressed by them for appreciating faint tastes, odours, or\r\nsounds; but these incapacities are remedied by brief intervals of repose.\r\nVision still better illustrates this simultaneity of waste and repair.\r\nLooking at the Sun so affects the eyes that, for a short time, they cannot\r\nperceive the things around with the usual clearness. After gazing at a\r\nbright light of a particular colour, we see, on turning the eyes to\r\nadjacent objects, an image of the complementary colour; showing that the\r\nretina has, for the moment, lost the power to feel small amounts of those\r\nrays which have strongly affected it. Such inabilities disappear in a few\r\nseconds or a few minutes, according to circumstances. And here, indeed, we\r\nare introduced to a conclusive proof that special repair is ever\r\nneutralizing special waste. For the rapidity with which the eyes recover\r\ntheir sensitiveness, varies with the reparative power of the individual. In\r\nyouth the visual apparatus is so quickly restored to its state of\r\nintegrity, that many of these _photogenes_, as they are called, cannot be\r\nperceived. When sitting on the far side of a room, and gazing out of the\r\nwindow against a light sky, a person who is debilitated by disease or\r\nadvancing years, perceives, on transferring the gaze to the adjacent wall,\r\na momentary negative image of the window--the sash-bars appearing light and\r\nthe squares dark; but a young and healthy person has no such experience.\r\nWith a rich blood and vigorous circulation, the repair of the visual nerves\r\nafter impressions of moderate intensity, is nearly instantaneous.\r\n\r\nFunction carried to excess may produce waste so great that repair cannot\r\nmake up for it during the ordinary daily periods of rest; and there may\r\nresult incapacities of the over-taxed organs, lasting for considerable\r\nperiods. We know that eyes strained by long-continued minute work lose\r\ntheir power for months or years: perhaps suffering an injury from which\r\nthey never wholly recover. Brains, too, are often so unduly worked that\r\npermanent relaxation fails to restore them to vigour. Even of the motor\r\norgans the like holds. The most frequent cause of what is called \"wasting\r\npalsy,\" or atrophy of the muscles, is habitual excess of exertion: the\r\nproof being that the disease occurs most frequently among those engaged in\r\nlaborious handicrafts, and usually attacks first the muscles which have\r\nbeen most worked.\r\n\r\nThere has yet to be noticed another kind of repair--that, namely, by which\r\ninjured or lost parts are restored. Among the _Hydrozoa_ it is common for\r\nany portion of the body to reproduce the rest; even though the rest to be\r\nso reproduced is the greater part of the whole. In the more\r\nhighly-organized _Actinozoa_ the half of an individual will grow into a\r\ncomplete individual. Some of the lower Annelids, as the _Nais_, may be cut\r\ninto thirty or forty pieces and each piece will eventually become a perfect\r\nanimal. As we ascend to higher forms we find this reparative power much\r\ndiminished, though still considerable. The reproduction of a lost claw by a\r\nlobster or crab, is a familiar instance. Some of the inferior _Vertebrata_\r\nalso, as lizards, can develop new limbs or new tails, in place of those\r\nwhich have been cut off; and can even do this several times over, though\r\nwith decreasing completeness. The highest animals, however, thus repair\r\nthemselves to but a very small extent. Mammals and birds do it only in the\r\nhealing of wounds; and very often but imperfectly even in this. For in\r\nmuscular and glandular organs the tissues destroyed are not properly\r\nreproduced, but are replaced by tissue of an irregular kind which serves to\r\nhold the parts together. So that the power of reproducing lost parts is\r\ngreatest where the organization is lowest; and almost disappears where the\r\norganization is highest. And though we cannot say that in the intermediate\r\nstages there is a constant inverse relation between reparative power and\r\ndegree of organization; yet we may say that there is some approach to such\r\na relation.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 63. There is an obvious and complete harmony between the first of the\r\nabove inductions and the deduction which follows immediately from first\r\nprinciples. We have already seen (§ 23) \"that whatever amount of power an\r\norganism expends in any shape, is the correlate and equivalent of a power\r\nthat was taken into it from without.\" Motion, sensible or insensible,\r\ngenerated by an organism, is insensible motion which was absorbed in\r\nproducing certain chemical compounds appropriated by the organism under the\r\nform of food. As much energy as was required to raise the elements of these\r\ncomplex atoms to their state of unstable equilibrium, is given out in their\r\nfalls to a state of stable equilibrium; and having fallen to a state of\r\nstable equilibrium they can give out no further energy, but have to be got\r\nrid of as inert and useless. It is an inevitable corollary \"from the\r\npersistence of force, that each portion of mechanical or other energy which\r\nan organism exerts, implies the transformation of as much organic matter as\r\ncontained this energy in a latent state;\" and that this organic matter in\r\nyielding up its latent energy, loses its value for the purposes of life,\r\nand becomes waste matter needing to be excreted. The loss of these complex\r\nunstable substances must hence be proportionate to the quantity of expended\r\nforce. Here, then, is the rationale of certain general facts lately\r\nindicated. Plants do not waste to any considerable degree, for the obvious\r\nreason that the sensible and insensible motions they generate are\r\ninconsiderable. Between the small waste, small activity, and low\r\ntemperature of the inferior animals, the relation is similarly one\r\nadmitting of _a priori_ establishment. Conversely, the rapid waste of\r\nenergetic, hot-blooded animals might be foreseen with equal certainty. And\r\nnot less manifestly necessary is the variation in waste which, in the same\r\norganism, attends the variation in the heat and mechanical motion produced.\r\n\r\nBetween the activity of a special part and the waste of that part, a like\r\nrelation may be deductively inferred; though it cannot be inferred that\r\nthis relation is equally definite. Were the activity of every organ quite\r\nindependent of the activities of other organs, we might expect to trace out\r\nthis relation distinctly; but since increased activity in any organ or\r\ngroup of organs, as the muscles, necessarily entails increased activity in\r\nother organs, as in the heart, lungs, and nervous system, it is clear that\r\nspecial waste and general waste are too much entangled to admit of a\r\ndefinite relation being established between special waste and special\r\nactivity. We may fairly say, however, that this relation is quite as\r\nmanifest as we can reasonably anticipate.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 64. Deductive interpretation of the phenomena of Repair, is by no means\r\nso easy. The tendency displayed by an animal organism, as well as by each\r\nof its organs, to return to a state of integrity by the assimilation of new\r\nmatter, when it has undergone the waste consequent on activity, is a\r\ntendency which is not manifestly deducible from first principles; though it\r\nappears to be in harmony with them. If in the blood there existed\r\nready-formed units exactly like in kind to those of which each organ\r\nconsists, the sorting of these units, ending in the union of each kind with\r\nalready existing groups of the same kind, would be merely a good example of\r\nSegregation (_First Principles_, § 163). It would be analogous to the\r\nprocess by which, from a mixed solution of salts, there are, after an\r\ninterval, deposited separate masses of these salts in the shape of\r\ndifferent crystals. But as already said (§ 54), though the selective\r\nassimilation by which the repair of organs is effected, may result in part\r\nfrom an action of this kind, the facts cannot be thus wholly accounted for;\r\nsince organs are in part made up of units which do not exist as such in the\r\ncirculating fluids. We must suppose that, as suggested in § 54, groups of\r\ncompound units have a certain power of moulding adjacent fit materials into\r\nunits of their own form. Let us see whether there is not reason to think\r\nsuch a power exists.\r\n\r\n\"The poison of small-pox or of scarlatina,\" remarks Mr. (now Sir James)\r\nPaget, \"being once added to the blood, presently affects the composition of\r\nthe whole: the disease pursues its course, and, if recovery ensue, the\r\nblood will seem to have returned to its previous condition: yet it is not\r\nas it was before; for now the same poison may be added to it with\r\nimpunity.\" ... \"The change once effected, may be maintained through life.\r\nAnd herein seems to be a proof of the assimilative force in the blood: for\r\nthere seems no other mode of explaining these cases than by admitting that\r\nthe altered particles have the power of assimilating to themselves all\r\nthose by which they are being replaced: in other words, all the blood that\r\nis formed after such a disease deviates from the natural composition, so\r\nfar as to acquire the peculiarity engendered by the disease: it is formed\r\naccording to the altered model.\" Now if the compound molecules of the\r\nblood, or of an organism considered in the aggregate, have the power of\r\nmoulding into their own type the matters which they absorb as nutriment;\r\nand if they have the power when their type has been changed by disease, of\r\nmoulding materials afterwards received into the modified type; may we not\r\nreasonably suspect that the more or less specialized molecules of each\r\norgan have, in like manner, the power of moulding the materials which the\r\nblood brings to them into similarly specialized molecules? The one\r\nconclusion seems to be a corollary from the other. Such a power cannot be\r\nclaimed for the component units of the blood without being conceded to the\r\ncomponent units of every tissue. Indeed the assertion of this power is\r\nlittle more than an assertion of the fact that organs composed of\r\nspecialized units _are_ capable of resuming their structural integrity\r\nafter they have been wasted by function. For if they do this, they must do\r\nit by forming from the materials brought to them, certain specialized units\r\nlike in kind to those of which they are composed; and to say that they do\r\nthis, is to say that their component units have the power of moulding fit\r\nmaterials into other units of the same order.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 65. What must we say of the ability an organism has to re-complete itself\r\nwhen one of its parts has been cut off? Is it of the same order as the\r\nability of an injured crystal to re-complete itself. In either case new\r\nmatter is so deposited as to restore the original outline. And if in the\r\ncase of the crystal we say that the whole aggregate exerts over its parts a\r\nforce which constrains the newly-integrated molecules to take a certain\r\ndefinite form, we seem obliged, in the case of the organism, to assume an\r\nanalogous force. If when the leg of a lizard has been amputated there\r\npresently buds out the germ of a new one, which, passing through phases of\r\ndevelopment like those of the original leg, eventually assumes a like shape\r\nand structure, we assert only what we see, when we assert that the entire\r\norganism, or the adjacent part of it, exercises such power over the forming\r\nlimb as makes it a repetition of its predecessor. If a leg is reproduced,\r\nwhere there was a leg, and a tail where there was a tail, there seems no\r\nalternative but to conclude that the forces around it control the formative\r\nprocesses going on in each part. And on contemplating these facts in\r\nconnexion with various kindred ones, there is suggested the hypothesis,\r\nthat the form of each species of organism is determined by a peculiarity in\r\nthe constitution of its units--that these have a special structure in which\r\nthey tend to arrange themselves; just as have the simpler units of\r\ninorganic matter. Let us glance at the evidences which more especially\r\nthrust this conclusion upon us.\r\n\r\nA fragment of a Begonia-leaf imbedded in fit soil and kept at an\r\nappropriate temperature, will develop a young Begonia; and so small is the\r\nfragment which is thus capable of originating a complete plant, that\r\nsomething like a hundred plants may be produced from a single leaf. The\r\nfriend to whom I owe this observation, tells me that various succulent\r\nplants have like powers of multiplication. Illustrating a similar power\r\namong animals, we have the often-cited experiments of Trembley on the\r\ncommon polype. Each of the four pieces into which one of these creatures\r\nwas cut, grew into a perfect individual. In each of these, again, bisection\r\nand tri-section were followed by like results. And so with their segments,\r\nsimilarly produced, until as many as fifty polypes had resulted from the\r\noriginal one. Bodies when cut off regenerated heads; heads regenerated\r\nbodies; and when a polype had been divided into as many pieces as was\r\npracticable, nearly every piece survived and became a complete animal.\r\nWhat, now, is the implication? We cannot say that in each portion of a\r\nBegonia-leaf, and in every fragment of a Hydra's body, there exists a\r\nready-formed model of the entire organism. Even were there warrant for the\r\ndoctrine that the germ of every organism contains the perfect organism in\r\nminiature, it still could not be contended that each considerable part of\r\nthe perfect organism resulting from such a germ, contains another such\r\nminiature. Indeed the one hypothesis negatives the other. The implication\r\nseems, therefore, to be that the living particles composing one of these\r\nfragments, have an innate tendency to arrange themselves into the shape of\r\nthe organism to which they belong. We must infer that the active units\r\ncomposing a plant or animal of any species have an intrinsic aptitude to\r\naggregate into the form of that species. It seems difficult to conceive\r\nthat this can be so; but we see that it _is_ so. Groups of units taken from\r\nan organism (providing they are of a certain bulk and not much\r\ndifferentiated into special structures) _have_ this power of re-arranging\r\nthemselves. Manifestly, too, if we are thus to interpret the reproduction\r\nof an organism from one of its amorphous fragments, we must thus interpret\r\nthe reproduction of any minor portion of an organism by the remainder. When\r\nin place of its lost claw a lobster puts forth a cellular mass which, while\r\nincreasing in bulk, assumes the form and structure of the original claw, we\r\ncannot avoid ascribing this result to a play of forces like that which\r\nmoulds the materials contained in a piece of Begonia-leaf into the shape of\r\na young Begonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 66. As we shall have frequent occasion hereafter to refer to these units\r\nwhich possess the property of arranging themselves into the special\r\nstructures of the organisms to which they belong; it will be well here to\r\nask by what name they may be most fitly called.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it cannot be in those chemical compounds characterizing\r\norganic bodies that this specific property dwells. It cannot be that the\r\nmolecules of albumin, or fibrin, or gelatine, or other proteid, possess\r\nthis power of aggregating into these specific shapes; for in such case\r\nthere would be nothing to account for the unlikenesses of different\r\norganisms. If the proclivities of proteid molecules determined the forms of\r\nthe organisms built up of them or by them, the occurrence of such endlessly\r\nvaried forms would be inexplicable. Hence what we may call the _chemical\r\nunits_ are clearly not the possessors of this property.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this property cannot reside in what may be roughly\r\ndistinguished as the _morphological units_. The germ of every organism is a\r\nminute portion of encased protoplasm commonly called a cell. It is by\r\nmultiplication of cells that all the early developmental changes are\r\neffected. The various tissues which successively arise in the unfolding\r\norganism, are primarily cellular; and in many of them the formation of\r\ncells continues to be, throughout life, the process by which repair is\r\ncarried on. But though cells are so generally the ultimate visible\r\ncomponents of organisms, that they may with some show of reason be called\r\nthe morphological units; yet we cannot say that this tendency to aggregate\r\ninto special forms dwells in them. In many cases a fibrous tissue arises\r\nout of a nucleated blastema, without cell-formation; and in such cases\r\ncells cannot be regarded as units possessing the structural proclivity. But\r\nthe conclusive proof that the morphological units are not the building\r\nfactors in an organism composed of them, is yielded by their independent\r\nhomologues the so-called unicellular organisms. For each of these displays\r\nthe power to assume its specific structure. Clearly, if the ability of a\r\nmulticellular organism to assume its specific structure resulted from the\r\ncooperation of its component cells, then a single cell, or the independent\r\nhomologue of a single cell, having no other to cooperate with, could\r\nexhibit no structural traits. Not only, however, do single-celled organisms\r\nexhibit structural traits, but these, even among the simplest, are so\r\ndistinct as to originate classification into orders, genera, and species;\r\nand they are so constant as to remain the same from generation to\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nIf, then, this organic polarity (as we might figuratively call this\r\nproclivity towards a specific structural arrangement) can be possessed\r\nneither by the chemical units nor the morphological units, we must conceive\r\nit as possessed by certain intermediate units, which we may term\r\n_physiological_. There seems no alternative but to suppose that the\r\nchemical units combine into units immensely more complex than themselves,\r\ncomplex as they are; and that in each organism the physiological units\r\nproduced by this further compounding of highly compound molecules, have a\r\nmore or less distinctive character. We must conclude that in each case some\r\ndifference of composition in the units, or of arrangement in their\r\ncomponents, leading to some difference in their mutual play of forces,\r\nproduces a difference in the form which the aggregate of them assumes.\r\n\r\nThe facts contained in this chapter form but a small part of the evidence\r\nwhich thrusts this assumption upon us. We shall hereafter find various\r\nreasons for inferring that such physiological units exist, and that to\r\ntheir specific properties, more or less unlike in each plant and animal,\r\nvarious organic phenomena are due.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nADAPTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 67. In plants waste and repair being scarcely appreciable, there are not\r\nlikely to arise appreciable changes in the proportions of already-formed\r\nparts. The only divergences from the average structures of a species, which\r\nwe may expect particular conditions to produce, are those producible by the\r\naction of these conditions on parts in course of formation; and such\r\ndivergences we do find. We know that a tree which, standing alone in an\r\nexposed position, has a short and thick stem, has a tall and slender stem\r\nwhen it grows in a wood; and that also its branches then take a different\r\ninclination. We know that potato-sprouts which, on reaching the light,\r\ndevelop into foliage, will, in the absence of light, grow to a length of\r\nseveral feet without foliage. And every in-door plant furnishes proof that\r\nshoots and leaves, by habitually turning themselves to the light, exhibit a\r\ncertain adaptation--an adaptation due, as we must suppose; to the special\r\neffects of the special conditions on the still growing parts. In animals,\r\nhowever, besides analogous structural changes wrought during the period of\r\ngrowth, by subjection to circumstances unlike the ordinary circumstances,\r\nthere are structural changes similarly wrought after maturity has been\r\nreached. Organs that have arrived at their full sizes possess a certain\r\nmodifiability; so that while the organism as a whole retains pretty nearly\r\nthe same bulk, the proportions of its parts may be considerably varied.\r\nTheir variations, here treated of under the title Adaptation, depend on\r\nspecialities of individual action. In the last chapter we saw that the\r\nactions of organisms entail re-actions on them; and that specialities of\r\naction entail specialities of re-action. Here it remains to be pointed out\r\nthat these special actions and re-actions do not end with temporary\r\nchanges, but work permanent changes.\r\n\r\nIf, in an adult animal, the waste and repair in all parts were exactly\r\nbalanced--if each organ daily gained by nutrition exactly as much as it\r\nlost daily by the discharge of its function--if excess of function were\r\nfollowed only by such excess of nutrition as balanced the extra waste; it\r\nis clear that there would occur no change in the relative sizes of organs.\r\nBut there is no such exact balance. If the excess of function, and\r\nconsequent excess of waste, is moderate, it is not simply compensated by\r\nrepair but more than compensated--there is a certain increase of bulk. This\r\nis true to some degree of the organism as a whole, when the organism is\r\nframed for activity. A considerable waste giving considerable power of\r\nassimilation, is more favourable to accumulation of tissue than is\r\nquiescence with its comparatively feeble assimilation: whence results a\r\ncertain adaptation of the whole organism to its requirements. But it is\r\nmore especially true of the parts of an organism in relation to one\r\nanother. The illustrations fall into several groups. The growth of muscles\r\nexercised to an unusual degree is a matter of common observation. In the\r\noften-cited blacksmith's arm, the dancer's legs and the jockey's crural\r\nadductors, we have marked examples of a modifiability which almost every\r\none has to some extent experienced. It is needless to multiply proofs. The\r\noccurrence of changes in the structure of the skin, where the skin is\r\nexposed to unusual stress of function, is also familiar. That thickening of\r\nthe epidermis on a labourer's palm results from continual pressure and\r\nfriction, is certain. Those who have not before exerted their hands, find\r\nthat such an exercise as rowing soon begins to produce a like thickening.\r\nThis relation of cause and effect is still better shown by the marked\r\nindurations at the ends of a violinist's fingers. Even in mucous membrane,\r\nwhich ordinarily is not subject to mechanical forces of any intensity,\r\nsimilar modifications are possible: witness the callosity of the gums which\r\narises in those who have lost their teeth, and have to masticate without\r\nteeth. The vascular system furnishes good instances of the increased growth\r\nthat follows increased function. When, because of some permanent\r\nobstruction to the circulation, the heart has to exert a greater\r\ncontractile force on the mass of blood which it propels at each pulsation,\r\nand when there results the laboured action known as palpitation, there\r\nusually occurs dilatation, or hypertrophy, or a mixture of the two: the\r\ndilatation, which is a yielding of the heart's structure under the\r\nincreased strain, implying a failure to meet the emergency; but the\r\nhypertrophy, which consists in a thickening of the heart's muscular walls,\r\nbeing an adaptation of it to the additional effort required. Again, when an\r\naneurism in some considerable artery has been obliterated, either\r\nartifically or by a natural inflammatory process; and when this artery has\r\nconsequently ceased to be a channel for the blood; some of the adjacent\r\narteries which anastomose with it become enlarged, so as to carry the\r\nneedful quantity of blood to the parts supplied. Though we have no direct\r\nproof of analogous modifications in nervous structures, yet indirect proof\r\nis given by the greater efficiency that follows greater activity. This is\r\nmanifested alike in the senses and the intellect. The palate may be\r\ncultivated into extreme sensitiveness, as in professional tea-tasters. An\r\norchestral conductor gains, by continual practice, an unusually great\r\nability to discriminate differences of sound. In the finger-reading of the\r\nblind we have evidence that the sense of touch may be brought by exercise\r\nto a far higher capability than is ordinary.[23] The increase of power\r\nwhich habitual exertion gives to mental faculties needs no illustration:\r\nevery person of education has personal experience of it. Even from the\r\nosseous structures evidence may be drawn. The bones of men accustomed to\r\ngreat muscular action are more massive, and have more strongly marked\r\nprocesses for the attachment of muscles, than the bones of men who lead\r\nsedentary lives; and a like contrast holds between the bones of wild and\r\ntame animals of the same species. Adaptations of another order, in which\r\nthere is a qualitative rather than a quantitative modification, arise after\r\ncertain accidents to which the skeleton is liable. When the hip-joint has\r\nbeen dislocated, and long delay has made it impossible to restore the parts\r\nto their proper places, the head of the thigh-bone, imbedded in the\r\nsurrounding muscles, becomes fixed in its new position by attachments of\r\nfibrous tissue, which afford support enough to permit a halting walk. But\r\nthe most remarkable modification of this order occurs in united ends of\r\nfractured bones. \"False joints\" are often formed--joints which rudely\r\nsimulate the hinge structure or the ball-and-socket structure, according as\r\nthe muscles tend to produce a motion of flexion and extension or a motion\r\nof rotation. In the one case, according to Rokitansky, the two ends of the\r\nbroken bone become smooth and covered with periosteum and fibrous tissue,\r\nand are attached by ligaments that allow a certain backward and forward\r\nmotion; and in the other case the ends, similarly clothed with the\r\nappropriate membranes, become the one convex and the other concave, are\r\ninclosed in a capsule, and are even occasionally supplied with synovial\r\nfluid!\r\n\r\nThe general truth that extra function is followed by extra growth, must be\r\nsupplemented by the equally general truth, that beyond a limit, usually\r\nsoon reached, very little, if any, further modification can be produced.\r\nThe experiences which we colligate into the one induction thrust the other\r\nupon us. After a time no training makes the pugilist or the athlete any\r\nstronger. The adult gymnast at last acquires the power to perform certain\r\ndifficult feats; but certain more difficult feats no additional practice\r\nenables him to perform. Years of discipline give the singer a particular\r\nloudness and range of voice, beyond which further discipline does not give\r\ngreater loudness or wider range: on the contrary, increased vocal exercise,\r\ncausing a waste in excess of repair, is often followed by decrease of\r\npower. In the exaltation of the perceptions we see similar limits. The\r\nculture which raises the susceptibility of the ear to the intervals and\r\nharmonies of notes, will not turn a bad ear into a good one. Lifelong\r\neffort fails to make this artist a correct draftsman or that a fine\r\ncolourist: each does better than he did at first, but each falls short of\r\nthe power attained by some other artists. Nor is this truth less clearly\r\nillustrated among the more complex mental powers. A man may have a\r\nmathematical faculty, a poetical faculty, or an oratorical faculty, which\r\nspecial education improves to a certain extent. But unless he is unusually\r\nendowed in one of those directions, no amount of education will make him a\r\nfirst-rate mathematician, a first-rate poet, or a first-rate orator. Thus\r\nthe general fact appears to be that while in each individual certain\r\nchanges in the proportions of parts may be caused by variations of\r\nfunctions, the congenital structure of each individual puts a limit to the\r\nmodifiability of every part. Nor is this true of individuals only: it\r\nholds, in a sense, of species. Leaving open the question whether, in\r\nindefinite times, indefinite modifications may not be produced by\r\ninheritance of functionally wrought adaptations; experience proves that\r\nwithin assigned times, the changes wrought in races of organisms by changes\r\nof conditions fall within narrow limits. Though by discipline, aided by\r\nselective breeding, one variety of horse has had its locomotive power\r\nincreased considerably beyond the locomotive powers of other varieties; yet\r\nfurther increase takes place, if at all, at an inappreciable rate. The\r\ndifferent kinds of dogs, too, in which different forms and capacities have\r\nbeen established, do not now show aptitudes for diverging in the same\r\ndirections at considerable rates. In domestic animals generally, certain\r\naccessions of intelligence have been produced by culture; but accessions\r\nbeyond these are inconspicuous. It seems that in each species of organism\r\nthere is a margin for functional oscillations on all sides of a mean state,\r\nand a consequent margin for structural variations; that it is possible\r\nrapidly to push functional and structural changes towards the extreme of\r\nthis margin in any direction, both in an individual and in a race; but that\r\nto push these changes further in any direction, and so to alter the\r\norganism as to bring its mean state up to the extreme of the margin in that\r\ndirection, is a comparatively slow process.[24]\r\n\r\nWe also have to note that the limited increase of size produced in any\r\norgan by a limited increase of its function, is not maintained unless the\r\nincrease of function is permanent. A mature man or other animal, led by\r\ncircumstances into exerting particular members in unusual degrees, and\r\nacquiring extra sizes in these members, begins to lose such extra sizes on\r\nceasing to exert the members; and eventually lapses more or less nearly\r\ninto the original state. Legs strengthened by a pedestrian tour, become\r\nrelatively weak again after a prolonged return to sedentary life. The\r\nacquired ability to perform feats of skill disappears in course of time, if\r\nthe performance of them be given up. For comparative failure in executing a\r\npiece of music, in playing a game at chess, or in anything requiring\r\nspecial culture, the being out of practice is a reason which every one\r\nrecognizes as valid. It is observable, too, that the rapidity and\r\ncompleteness with which an artificial power is lost, is proportionate to\r\nthe shortness of the cultivation which evoked it. One who has for many\r\nyears persevered in habits which exercise special muscles or special\r\nfaculties of mind, retains the extra capacity produced, to a very\r\nconsiderable degree, even after a long period of desistance; but one who\r\nhas persevered in such habits for but a short time has, at the end of a\r\nlike period, scarcely any of the facility he had gained. Here too, as\r\nbefore, successions of organisms present an analogous fact. A species in\r\nwhich domestication continued through many generations, has organized\r\ncertain peculiarities; and which afterwards, escaping domestic discipline,\r\nreturns to something like its original habits; soon loses, in great\r\nmeasure, such peculiarities. Though it is not true, as alleged, that it\r\nresumes completely the structure it had before domestication, yet it\r\napproximates to that structure. The Dingo, or wild dog of Australia, is one\r\nof the instances given of this; and the wild horse of South America is\r\nanother. Mankind, too, supplies us with instances. In the Australian bush\r\nand in the backwoods of America, the Anglo-Saxon race, in which\r\ncivilization has developed the higher feelings to a considerable degree,\r\nrapidly lapses into comparative barbarism: adopting the moral code, and\r\nsometimes the habits, of savages.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 68. It is important to reach, if possible, some rationale of these\r\ngeneral truths--especially of the last two. A right understanding of these\r\nlaws of organic modification underlies a right understanding of the great\r\nquestion of species. While, as before hinted (§ 40), the action of\r\nstructure on function is one of the factors in that process of\r\ndifferentiation by which unlike forms of plants and animals are produced,\r\nthe reaction of function on structure is another factor. Hence, it is well\r\nworth while inquiring how far these inductions are deductively\r\ninterpretable.\r\n\r\nThe first of them is the most difficult to deal with. Why an organ exerted\r\nsomewhat beyond its wont should presently grow, and thus meet increase of\r\ndemand by increase of supply, is not obvious. We know, indeed, (_First\r\nPrinciples_, §§ 85, 173,) that of necessity, the rhythmical changes\r\nproduced by antagonistic organic actions cannot any of them be carried to\r\nan excess in one direction, without there being produced an equivalent\r\nexcess in the opposite direction. It is a corollary from the persistence of\r\nforce, that any deviation effected by a disturbing cause, acting on some\r\nmember of a moving equilibrium, must (unless it altogether destroys the\r\nmoving equilibrium) be eventually followed by a compensating deviation.\r\nHence, that excess of repair should succeed excess of waste, is to be\r\nexpected. But how happens the mean state of the organ to be changed? If\r\ndaily extra waste naturally brings about daily extra repair only to an\r\nequivalent extent, the mean state of the organ should remain constant. How\r\nthen comes the organ to augment in size and power?\r\n\r\nSuch answer to this question as we may hope to find, must be looked for in\r\nthe effects wrought on the organism as a whole by increased function in one\r\nof its parts. For since the discharge of its function by any part is\r\npossible only on condition that those various other functions on which its\r\nown is immediately dependent are also discharged, it follows that excess in\r\nits function presupposes some excess in their functions. Additional work\r\ngiven to a muscle implies additional work given to the branch arteries\r\nwhich bring it blood, and additional work, smaller in proportion, to the\r\narteries from which these branch arteries come. Similarly, the smaller and\r\nlarger veins which take away the blood, as well as those structures which\r\ndeal with effete products, must have more to do. And yet further, on the\r\nnervous centres which excite the muscle a certain extra duty must fall. But\r\nexcess of waste will entail excess of repair, in these parts as well as in\r\nthe muscle. The several appliances by which the nutrition and excitation of\r\nan organ are carried on, must also be influenced by this rhythm of action\r\nand reaction; and therefore, after losing more than usual by the\r\ndestructive process they must gain more than usual by the constructive\r\nprocess. But temporarily-increased efficiency in these appliances by which\r\nblood and nervous force are brought to an organ, will cause extra\r\nassimilation in the organ, beyond that required to balance its extra\r\nexpenditure. Regarding the functions as constituting a moving equilibrium,\r\nwe may say that divergence of any function in the direction of increase,\r\ncauses the functions with which it is bound up to diverge in the same\r\ndirection; that these, again, cause the functions which they are bound up\r\nwith, also to diverge in the same direction; and that these divergences of\r\nthe connected functions allow the specially-affected function to be carried\r\nfurther in this direction than it could otherwise be--further than the\r\nperturbing force could carry it if it had a fixed basis.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that this is but a vague explanation. Among actions so\r\ninvolved as these, we can scarcely expect to do more than dimly discern a\r\nharmony with first principles. That the facts are to be interpreted in some\r\nsuch way, may, however, be inferred from the circumstance that an extra\r\nsupply of blood continues for some time to be sent to an organ that has\r\nbeen unusually exercised; and that when unusual exercise is long continued\r\na permanent increase of vascularity results.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 69. Answers to the questions--Why do these adaptive modifications in an\r\nindividual animal soon reach a limit? and why, in the descendants of such\r\nanimal, similarly conditioned, is this limit very slowly extended?--are to\r\nbe found in the same direction as was the answer to the last question. And\r\nhere the connexion of cause and consequence is more manifest.\r\n\r\nSince the function of any organ is dependent on the functions of the organs\r\nwhich supply it with materials and stimuli; and since the functions of\r\nthese subsidiary organs are dependent on the functions of organs which\r\nsupply them with materials and stimuli; it follows that before any great\r\nextra power of discharging its function can be gained by a\r\nspecially-exercised organ, a considerable extra power must be gained by a\r\nseries of immediately-subservient organs, and some extra power by a\r\nsecondary series of remotely-subservient organs. Thus there are required\r\nnumerous and wide-spread modifications. Before the artery which feeds a\r\nhard-worked muscle can permanently furnish a large additional quantity of\r\nblood, it must increase in diameter; and that its increase of diameter may\r\nbe of use, the main artery from which it diverges must also be so far\r\nmodified as to bring this additional quantity of blood to the branch\r\nartery. Similarly with the veins; similarly with the structures which\r\nremove waste-products; similarly with the nerves. And when we ask what\r\nthese subsidiary changes imply, we are forced to conclude that there must\r\nbe an analogous group of more numerous changes ramifying throughout the\r\nsystem. The growth of the arteries primarily and secondarily implicated,\r\ncannot go to any extent without growth in the minor blood-vessels on which\r\ntheir nutrition depends; while their greater contractile power involves\r\nenlargement of the nerves which excite them, and some modification of that\r\npart of the spinal cord whence these nerves proceed. Thus, without tracing\r\nthe like remote alterations implied by extra growth of the veins,\r\nlymphatics, glandular organs, and other agencies, it is manifest that a\r\nlarge amount of rebuilding must be done throughout the organism, before any\r\norgan of importance can be permanently increased in size and power to a\r\ngreat extent. Hence, though such extra growth in any part as does not\r\nnecessitate considerable changes throughout the rest of the organism, may\r\nrapidly take place; a further growth in this part, requiring a re-modelling\r\nof numerous parts remotely and slightly affected, must take place but\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\nWe have before found our conceptions of vital processes made clearer by\r\nstudying analogous social processes. In societies there is a mutual\r\ndependence of functions, essentially like that which exists in organisms;\r\nand there is also an essentially like reaction of functions on structures.\r\nFrom the laws of adaptive modification in societies, we may therefore hope\r\nto get a clue to the laws of adaptive modification in organisms. Let us\r\nsuppose, then, that a society has arrived at a state of equilibrium\r\nanalogous to that of a mature animal--a state not like our own, in which\r\ngrowth and structural development are rapidly going on, but a state of\r\nsettled balance among the functional powers of the various classes and\r\nindustrial bodies, and a consequent fixity in the relative sizes of such\r\nclasses and bodies. Further, let us suppose that in a society thus balanced\r\nthere occurs something which throws an unusual demand on one industry--say\r\nan unusual demand for ships (which we will assume to be built of iron) in\r\nconsequence of a competing mercantile nation having been prostrated by\r\nfamine or pestilence. The immediate result of this additional demand for\r\niron ships is the employment of more workmen, and the purchase of more\r\niron, by the ship-builders; and when, presently, the demand continuing, the\r\nship-builders find their premises and machinery insufficient, they enlarge\r\nthem. If the extra requirement persists, the high interest and high wages\r\nbring such extra capital and labour into the business as are needed for new\r\nship-building establishments. But such extra capital and labour do not come\r\nquickly; since, in a balanced community, not increasing in population and\r\nwealth, labour and capital have to be drawn from other industries, where\r\nthey are already yielding the ordinary returns. Let us now go a step\r\nfurther. Suppose that this iron-ship-building industry, having enlarged as\r\nmuch as the available capital and labour permit, is still unequal to the\r\ndemand; what limits its immediate further growth? The lack of iron. By the\r\nhypothesis, the iron-producing industry, like all the other industries\r\nthroughout the community, yields only as much iron as is habitually\r\nrequired for all the purposes to which iron is applied: ship-building being\r\nonly one. If, then, extra iron is required for ship-building, the first\r\neffect is to withdraw part of the iron habitually consumed for other\r\npurposes, and to raise the price of iron. Presently, the iron-makers feel\r\nthis change and their stocks dwindle. As, however, the quantity of iron\r\nrequired for ship-building forms but a small part of the total quantity\r\nrequired for all purposes, the extra demand on the iron-makers can be\r\nnothing like so great in proportion as is the extra demand on the\r\nship-builders. Whence it follows that there will be much less tendency to\r\nan immediate enlargement of the iron-producing industry; since the extra\r\nquantity will for some time be obtained by working extra hours.\r\nNevertheless if, as fast as more iron can be thus supplied, the\r\nship-building industry goes on growing--if, consequently, the iron-makers\r\nexperience a permanently-increased demand, and out of their greater profits\r\nget higher interest on capital, as well as pay higher wages; there will\r\neventually be an abstraction of capital and labour from other industries to\r\nenlarge the iron-producing industry: new blast-furnaces, new rolling-mills,\r\nnew cottages for workmen, will be erected. But obviously, the inertia of\r\ncapital and labour to be overcome before the iron-producing industry can\r\ngrow by a decrease of certain other industries, will prevent its growth\r\nfrom taking place until long after the increased ship-building industry has\r\ndemanded it; and meanwhile, the growth of the ship-building industry must\r\nbe limited by the deficiency of iron. A remoter restraint of the same\r\nnature meets us if we go a step further--a restraint which can be overcome\r\nonly in a still longer time. For the manufacture of iron depends on the\r\nsupply of coal. The production of coal being previously in equilibrium with\r\nthe consumption; and the consumption of coal for the manufacture of iron\r\nbeing but a small part of the total consumption; it follows that a\r\nconsiderable extension of the iron manufacture, when it at length takes\r\nplace, will cause but a comparatively small additional demand on the\r\ncoal-owners and coal-miners--a demand which will not, for a long period,\r\nsuffice to cause enlargement of the coal-trade, by drawing capital and\r\nlabour from other investments and occupations. And until the permanent\r\nextra demand for coal has become great enough to draw from other\r\ninvestments and occupations sufficient capital and labour to sink new\r\nmines, the increasing production of iron must be restricted by the scarcity\r\nof coal, and the multiplication of ship-yards and ship-builders must be\r\nchecked by the want of iron. Thus, in a community which has reached a state\r\nof moving equilibrium, though any one industry directly affected by an\r\nadditional demand may rapidly undergo a small extra growth, yet a growth\r\nbeyond this, requiring as it does the building-up of subservient\r\nindustries, less directly and strongly affected, as well as the partial\r\nunbuilding of other industries, can take place only with comparative\r\nslowness. And a still further growth, requiring structural modifications of\r\nindustries still more distantly affected, must take place still more\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\nOn returning from this analogy, we see more clearly the truth that any\r\nconsiderable member of an animal organism, cannot be greatly enlarged\r\nwithout some general reorganization. Besides a building up of the primary,\r\nsecondary, and tertiary groups of the subservient parts, there must be an\r\nunbuilding of sundry non-subservient parts; or, at any rate, there must be\r\npermanently established a lower nutrition of such non-subservient parts.\r\nFor it must be remembered that in a mature animal, or one which has reached\r\na balance between assimilation and expenditure, there cannot (supposing\r\ngeneral conditions to remain constant) be an increase in the nutrition of\r\nsome organs without a decrease in the nutrition of others; and an organic\r\nestablishment of the increase implies an organic establishment of the\r\ndecrease--implies more or less change in the processes and structures\r\nthroughout the entire system. And here, indeed, is disclosed one reason why\r\ngrowing animals undergo adaptations so much more readily than adult ones.\r\nFor while there is surplus nutrition, it is possible for\r\nspecially-exercised parts to be specially enlarged without any positive\r\ndeduction from other parts. There is required only that negative deduction\r\nimplied in the diminished growth of other parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 70. Pursuing the argument further, we reach an explanation of the third\r\ngeneral truth; namely that organisms, and species of organisms, which,\r\nunder new conditions, have undergone adaptive modifications, soon return to\r\nsomething like their original structures when restored to their original\r\nconditions. Seeing, as we have done, how excess of action and excess of\r\nnutrition in any part of an organism, must affect action and nutrition in\r\nsubservient parts, and these again in other parts, until the re-action has\r\ndivided and subdivided itself throughout the organism, affecting in\r\ndecreasing degrees the more and more numerous parts more and more remotely\r\nimplicated; we see that the consequent changes in the parts remotely\r\nimplicated, constituting the great mass of the organism, must be extremely\r\nslow. Hence, if the need for the adaptive modification ceases before the\r\ngreat mass of the organism has been much altered in its structure by these\r\nramified but minute reactions, we shall have a condition in which the\r\nspecially-modified part is not in equilibrium with the rest. All the\r\nremotely-affected organs, as yet but little changed, will, in the absence\r\nof the perturbing cause, resume very nearly their previous actions. The\r\nparts that depend on them will consequently by and by do the same. Until at\r\nlength, by a reversal of the adaptive process, the organ at first affected\r\nwill be brought back almost to its original state. Reconsidering the\r\nabove-drawn analogy between an organism and a society, will enable us\r\nbetter to recognize this necessity. If, in the case supposed, the extra\r\ndemand for iron ships, after causing the erection of some additional\r\nship-yards and the drawing of iron from other manufactures, were to cease;\r\nthe old dimensions of the ship-building trade would be quickly returned to:\r\ndischarged workmen would seek fresh occupations, and the new yards would be\r\ndevoted to other uses. But if the increased need for ships lasted long\r\nenough, and became great enough, to cause a flow of capital and labour from\r\nother industries into the iron-manufacture, a falling off in the demand for\r\nships, would much less rapidly entail a dwindling of the ship-building\r\nindustry. For iron being now produced in greater quantity, a diminished\r\nconsumption of it for ships would cause a fall in its price, and a\r\nconsequent fall in the cost of ships: thus enabling the ship-builders to\r\nmeet the competition which we may suppose led to a decrease in the orders\r\nthey received. And since, when new blast-furnaces and rolling-mills, &c.,\r\nhad been built with capital drawn from other industries, its transference\r\nback into other industries would involve great loss; the owners, rather\r\nthan transfer it, would accept unusually low interest, and an excess of\r\niron would continue to be produced; resulting in an undue cheapness of\r\nships, and a maintenance of the ship-building industry at a size beyond the\r\nneed. Eventually, however, if the number of ships required still\r\ndiminished, the production of iron in excess would become very\r\nunremunerative: some of the blast-furnaces would be blown out; and as much\r\nof the capital and labour as remained available would be re-distributed\r\namong other occupations. Without repeating the steps of the argument, it\r\nwill be clear that were the enlargement of the ship-building industry great\r\nenough, and did it last long enough to cause an increase in the number of\r\ncoal-mines, the ship-building industry would be still better able to\r\nmaintain itself under adverse circumstances; but that it would, though at a\r\nmore distant period, end by sinking down to the needful dimensions. Thus\r\nour conclusions are:--First, that if the extra growth caused by extra\r\nactivity in a particular industry has lasted long enough only to remodel\r\nthe proximately-affected industries; it will dwindle away again after a\r\nmoderate period, if the need for it disappears. Second, that a long period\r\nmust be required before the re-actions produced by an enlarged industry can\r\ncause a re-construction of the whole society, and before the countless\r\nre-distributions of capital and labour can again reach a state of\r\nequilibrium. And third, that only when such a new state of equilibrium is\r\neventually reached, can the adaptive modification become a permanent one.\r\nHow, in animal organisms the like argument holds, need not be pointed out.\r\nThe reader will readily follow the parallel.\r\n\r\nThat organic types should be comparatively stable, might be anticipated on\r\nthe hypothesis of Evolution. The structure of any organism being a product\r\nof the almost infinite series of actions and reactions to which ancestral\r\norganisms have been exposed; any unusual actions and reactions brought to\r\nbear on an individual, can have but an infinitesimal effect in permanently\r\nchanging the structure of the organism as a whole. The new set of forces,\r\ncompounded with all the antecedent sets of forces, can but inappreciably\r\nmodify that moving equilibrium of functions which all these antecedent sets\r\nof forces have established. Though there may result a considerable\r\nperturbation of certain functions--a considerable divergence from their\r\nordinary rhythms--yet the general centre of equilibrium cannot be sensibly\r\nchanged. On the removal of the perturbing cause the previous balance will\r\nbe quickly restored: the effect of the new forces being almost obliterated\r\nby the enormous aggregate of forces which the previous balance expresses.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 71. As thus understood, the phenomena of adaptation fall into harmony\r\nwith first principles. The inference that organic types are fixed, because\r\nthe deviations from them which can be produced within assignable periods\r\nare relatively small, and because, when a force producing deviation ceases,\r\nthere is a return to something like the original state; proves to be an\r\ninvalid inference. Without assuming fixity of species, we find good reasons\r\nfor anticipating that kind and degree of stability which is observed. We\r\nfind grounds for concluding, _a priori_, that an adaptive change of\r\nstructure will soon reach a point beyond which further adaptation will be\r\nslow; for concluding that when the modifying cause has been but a short\r\ntime in action, the modification generated will be evanescent; for\r\nconcluding that a modifying cause acting even for many generations, will do\r\nbut little towards permanently altering the organic equilibrium of a race;\r\nand for concluding that on the cessations of such cause, its effects will\r\nbecome unapparent in the course of a few generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nINDIVIDUALITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 72. What is an individual? is a question which many readers will think it\r\neasy to answer. Yet it is a question that has led to much controversy among\r\nZoologists and Botanists, and no quite satisfactory reply to it seems\r\npossible. As applied to a man, or to any one of the higher animals, which\r\nare all sharply-defined and independent, the word individual has a clear\r\nmeaning: though even here, when we turn from average cases to exceptional\r\ncases--as a calf with two heads and two pairs of fore-limbs--we find\r\nourselves in doubt whether to predicate one individuality or two. But when\r\nwe extend our range of observation to the organic world at large, we find\r\nthat difficulties allied to this exceptional one meets us everywhere under\r\nevery variety of form.\r\n\r\nEach uniaxial plant may perhaps fairly be regarded as a distinct\r\nindividual; though there are botanists who do not make even this admission.\r\nWhat, however, are we to say of a multiaxial plant? It is, indeed, usual to\r\nspeak of a tree with its many branches and shoots as singular; but strong\r\nreasons may be urged for considering it as plural. Every one of its axes\r\nhas a more or less independent life, and when cut off and planted may grow\r\ninto the likeness of its parent; or, by grafting and budding, parts of this\r\ntree may be developed upon another tree, and there manifest their specific\r\npeculiarities. Shall we regard all the growing axes thus resulting from\r\nslips and grafts and buds, as parts of one individual or as distinct\r\nindividuals? If a strawberry-plant sends out runners carrying buds at their\r\nends, which strike root and grow into independent plants that separate from\r\nthe original one by decay of the runners, must we not say that they possess\r\nseparate individualities; and yet if we do this, are we not at a loss to\r\nsay when their separate individualities were established, unless we admit\r\nthat each bud was from the beginning an individual? Commenting on such\r\nperplexities Schleiden says--\"Much has been written and disputed concerning\r\nthe conception of the individual, without, however, elucidating the\r\nsubject, principally owing to the misconception that still exists as to the\r\norigin of the conception. Now the individual is no conception, but the mere\r\nsubjective comprehension of an actual object, presented to us under some\r\ngiven specific conception, and on this latter it alone depends whether the\r\nobject is or is not an individual. Under the specific conception of the\r\nsolar system, ours is an individual: in relation to the specific conception\r\nof a planetary body, it is an aggregate of many individuals.\" ... \"I think,\r\nhowever, that looking at the indubitable facts already mentioned, and the\r\nrelations treated of in the course of these considerations, it will appear\r\nmost advantageous and most useful, in a scientific point of view, to\r\nconsider the vegetable cell as the general type of the plant (simple plant\r\nof the first order). Under this conception, _Protococcus_ and other plants\r\nconsisting of only one cell, and the spore and pollen-granule, will appear\r\nas individuals. Such individuals may, however, again, with a partial\r\nrenunciation of their individual independence, combine under definite laws\r\ninto definite forms (somewhat as the individual animals do in the globe of\r\nthe _Volvox globator_[25]). These again appear empirically as individual\r\nbeings, under a conception of a species (simple plants of the second order)\r\nderived from the form of the normal connexion of the elementary\r\nindividuals. But we cannot stop here, since Nature herself combines these\r\nindividuals, under a definite form, into larger associations, whence we\r\ndraw the third conception of the plant, from a connexion, as it were, of\r\nthe second power (compound plants--plants of the third order). The simple\r\nplant proceeding from the combination of the elementary individuals is then\r\ntermed a bud (_gemma_), in the composition of plants of the third order.\"\r\n\r\nThe animal kingdom presents still greater difficulties. When, from sundry\r\npoints on the body of a common polype, there bud out young polypes which,\r\nafter acquiring mouths and tentacles and closing up the communications\r\nbetween their stomachs and the stomach of the parent, finally separate from\r\nthe parent; we may with propriety regard them as distinct individuals. But\r\nwhen in the allied compound _Hydrozoa_, we find that these young polypes\r\ncontinue permanently connected with the parent; and when by this continuous\r\nbudding-out there is presently produced a tree-like aggregation, having a\r\ncommon alimentary canal into which the digestive cavity of each polype\r\nopens; it is no longer so clear that these little sacs, furnished with\r\nmouths and tentacles, are severally to be regarded as distinct individuals.\r\nWe cannot deny a certain individuality to the polypedom. And on discovering\r\nthat some of the buds, instead of unfolding in the same manner as the rest,\r\nare transformed into capsules in which eggs are developed--on discovering\r\nthat certain of the incipient polypes thus become wholly dependent on the\r\naggregate for their nutrition, and discharge functions which have nothing\r\nto do with their own maintenance, we have still clearer proof that the\r\nindividualities of the members are partially merged in the individuality of\r\nthe group. Other organisms belonging to the same order, display still more\r\ndecidedly this transition from simple individualities to a complex\r\nindividuality. In the _Diphyes_ there is a special modification of one or\r\nmore members of the polypedom into a swimming apparatus which, by its\r\nrhythmical contractions, propels itself through the water, drawing the\r\npolypedom after it. And in the more differentiated _Physalia_ various\r\norgans result from the metamorphosis of parts which are the homologues of\r\nindividual polypes. In this last instance, the individuality of the\r\naggregate is so predominant that the individualities of its members are\r\npractically lost. This combination of individualities in such way as to\r\nproduce a composite individual, meets us in other forms among the\r\nascidians. While in some of these, as in the _Clavelina_ and in the\r\n_Botryllidæ_, the animals associated are but little subordinated to the\r\ncommunity they form, in others they are so combined as to form a compound\r\nindividual. The pelagic ascidian _Doliolum_ is an example. \"Here we find a\r\nlarge individual which swims by contractions of circular muscular bands,\r\ncarries a train of smaller individuals attached to a long dorsal process of\r\nthe test. These are arranged in three rows: those constituting the lateral\r\nrow have wide mouths and no sexual organs or organs of locomotion--they\r\nsubserve the nutrition of the colony, a truth which is illustrated by the\r\nfact that as soon as they are properly developed the large individual (the\r\nmother) loses her alimentary canal;\" while from the median row are\r\neventually derived the sexual zoids.\r\n\r\nOn the hypothesis of Evolution, perplexities of this nature are just such\r\nas we might anticipate. If Life in general commenced with minute and simple\r\nforms, like those out of which all organisms, however complex, now\r\noriginate; and if the transitions from these primordial units to organisms\r\nmade up of groups of such units, and to higher organisms made up of groups\r\nof such groups took place by degrees; it is clear that individualities of\r\nthe first and simplest order would merge gradually in those of a larger and\r\nmore complex order, and these again in others of an order having still\r\ngreater bulk and organization. Hence it would be impossible to say where\r\nthe lower individualities ceased and the higher individualities commenced.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 73. To meet these difficulties, it has been proposed that the whole\r\nproduct of a single fertilized germ shall be regarded as a single\r\nindividual; whether such whole product be organized into one mass, or\r\nwhether it be organized into many masses that are partially or completely\r\nseparate. It is urged that whether the development of the fertilized germ\r\nbe continuous or discontinuous (§ 50) is a matter of secondary importance;\r\nthat the totality of living tissue to which the fertilized germ gives rise\r\nin any one case, is the equivalent of the totality to which it gives rise\r\nin any other case; and that we must recognize this equivalence, whether\r\nsuch totality of living tissue takes a concrete or a discrete arrangement.\r\nIn pursuance of this view, a zoological individual is constituted either by\r\nany such single animal as a mammal or bird, which may properly claim the\r\ntitle of a _zoon_, or by any such group of animals as the numerous _Medusæ_\r\nthat have been developed from the same egg, which are to be severally\r\ndistinguished as _zooids_.\r\n\r\nAdmitting it to be very desirable that there should be words for expressing\r\nthese relations and this equivalence, it may be objected that to apply the\r\nword individual to a number of separate living bodies, is inconvenient:\r\nconflicting so much, as it does, with the ordinary conception which this\r\nword suggests. It seems a questionable use of language to say that the\r\ncountless masses of _Anacharis Alsinastrum_ (now _Eloidea canadensis_)\r\nwhich, within these few years, have grown up in our rivers, canals, and\r\nponds, are all parts of one individual: and yet as this plant does not seed\r\nin England, these countless masses, having arisen by discontinuous\r\ndevelopment, must be so regarded if we accept the above definition.\r\n\r\nIt may be contended, too, that while it does violence to our established\r\nway of thinking, this mode of interpreting the facts is not without its\r\ndifficulties. Something seems to be gained by restricting the application\r\nof the title individual, to organisms which, being in all respects fully\r\ndeveloped, possess the power of producing their kind after the ordinary\r\nsexual method, and denying this title to those incomplete organisms which\r\nhave not this power. But the definition does not really establish this\r\ndistinction for us. On the one hand, we have cases in which, as in the\r\nworking bee, the whole of the germ-product is aggregated into a single\r\norganism; and yet, though an individual according to the definition, this\r\norganism has no power of reproducing its kind. On the other hand, we have\r\ncases like that of the perfect _Aphis_, where the organism is but an\r\ninfinitesimal part of the germ product, and yet has that completeness\r\nrequired for sexual reproduction. Further, it might be urged with some show\r\nof reason, that if the conception of individuality involves the conception\r\nof completeness, then, an organism which possesses an independent power of\r\nreproducing itself, being more complete than an organism in which this\r\npower is dependent on the aid of another organism, is more individual.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 74. There is, indeed, as already implied, no definition of individuality\r\nthat is unobjectionable. All we can do is to make the best practicable\r\ncompromise.\r\n\r\nAs applied either to an animate or an inanimate object, the word individual\r\nordinarily connotes union among the parts of the object and separateness\r\nfrom other objects. This fundamental element in the conception of\r\nindividuality, we cannot with propriety ignore in the biological\r\napplication of the word. That which we call an individual plant or animal\r\nmust, therefore, be some concrete whole and not a discrete whole. If,\r\nhowever, we say that each concrete living whole is to be regarded as an\r\nindividual, we are still met by the question--What constitutes a concrete\r\nliving whole?  A young organism arising by internal or external gemmation\r\nfrom a parent organism, passes gradually from a state in which it is an\r\nindistinguishable part of the parent organism to a state in which it is a\r\nseparate organism of like structure with the parent. At what stage does it\r\nbecome an individual? And if its individuality be conceded only when it\r\ncompletely separates from the parent, must we deny individuality to all\r\norganisms thus produced which permanently retain their connexions with\r\ntheir parents? Or again, what must we say of the _Hectocotylus_, which is\r\nan arm of the Cuttle-fish that undergoes a special development and then,\r\ndetaching itself, lives independently for a considerable period? And what\r\nmust we say of the larval nemertine worm the pilidium of which with its\r\nnervous system is left to move about awhile after the developing worm has\r\ndropped out of it?\r\n\r\nTo answer such questions we must revert to the definition of life. The\r\ndistinction between individual in its biological sense, and individual in\r\nits more general sense, must consist in the manifestation of Life, properly\r\nso called. Life we have seen to be, \"the definite combination of\r\nheterogeneous change, both simultaneous and successive, in correspondence\r\nwith external co-existences and sequences.\" Hence, a biological individual\r\nis any concrete whole having a structure which enables it, when placed in\r\nappropriate conditions, to continuously adjust its internal relations to\r\nexternal relations, so as to maintain the equilibrium of its functions. In\r\npursuance of this conception, we must consider as individuals all those\r\nwholly or partially independent organized masses which arise by\r\nmulticentral and multiaxial development that is either continuous or\r\ndiscontinuous (§ 50). We must accord the title to each separate aphis, each\r\npolype of a polypedom, each bud or shoot of a lowering plant, whether it\r\ndetaches itself as a bulbil or remains attached as a branch.\r\n\r\nBy thus interpreting the facts we do not, indeed, avoid all anomalies.\r\nWhile, among flowering plants, the power of independent growth and\r\ndevelopment is usually possessed only by shoots or axes; yet, in some\r\ncases, as in that of the Begonia-leaf awhile since mentioned, the appendage\r\nof an axis, or even a small fragment of such appendage, is capable of\r\ninitiating and carrying on the functions of life; and in other cases, as\r\nshown by M. Naudin in the _Drosera intermedia_, young plants are\r\noccasionally developed from the surfaces of leaves. Nor among forms like\r\nthe compound _Hydrozoa_, does the definition enable us to decide where the\r\nline is to be drawn between the individuality of the group and the\r\nindividualities of the members: merging into each other, as these do, in\r\ndifferent degrees. But, as before said, such difficulties must necessarily\r\npresent themselves if organic forms have arisen by insensible gradations.\r\nWe must be content with a course which commits us to the smallest number of\r\nincongruities; and this course is, to consider as an individual any\r\norganized mass which is capable of independently carrying on that\r\ncontinuous adjustment of inner to outer relations which constitutes Life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI^A.\r\n\r\nCELL-LIFE AND CELL-MULTIPLICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 74a. The progress of science is simultaneously towards simplification and\r\ntowards complication. Analysis simplifies its conceptions by resolving\r\nphenomena into their factors, and by then showing how each simple mode of\r\naction may be traced under multitudinous forms; while, at the same time,\r\nsynthesis shows how each factor, by cooperation with various other factors\r\nin countless modes and degrees, produces different results innumerable in\r\ntheir amounts and varieties. Of course this truth holds alike of processes\r\nand of products. Observation and the grouping into classes make it clear\r\nthat through multitudinous things superficially unlike there run the same\r\ncardinal traits of structure; while, along with these major unities,\r\nexamination discloses innumerable minor diversities.\r\n\r\nA concomitant truth, or the same truth under another aspect, is that Nature\r\neverywhere presents us with complexities within complexities, which go on\r\nrevealing themselves as we investigate smaller and smaller objects. In a\r\npreceding chapter (§§ 54a, 54b) it was pointed out that each primitive\r\norganism, in common with each of the units out of which the higher and\r\nlarger organisms are built, was found a generation ago to consist of\r\nnucleus, protoplasm, and cell-wall. This general conception of a cell\r\nremained for a time the outcome of inquiry; but with the advance of\r\nmicroscopy it became manifest that within these minute structures processes\r\nand products of an astonishing nature are to be seen. These we have now to\r\ncontemplate.\r\n\r\nIn the passages just referred to it was said that the external layer or\r\ncell-wall is a non-essential, inanimate part produced by the animate\r\ncontents. Itself a product of protoplasmic action, it takes no part in\r\nprotoplasmic changes, and may therefore here be ignored.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 74b. One of the complexities within complexities was disclosed when it\r\nwas found that the protoplasm itself has a complicated structure. Different\r\nobservers have described it as constituted by a network or reticulum, a\r\nsponge-work, a foam-work. Of these the first may be rejected; since it\r\nimplies a structure lying in one plane. If we accept the second we have to\r\nconceive the threads of protoplasm, corresponding to the fibres of the\r\nsponge, as leaving interstices filled either with liquid or solid. They\r\ncannot be filled with a continuous solid, since all motion of the\r\nprotoplasm would be negatived; and that their content is not liquid seems\r\nshown by the fact that its parts move about under the form of granules or\r\nmicrosomes. But the conception of moving granules implies the conception of\r\nimmersion in a liquid or semi-liquid substance in which they move--not a\r\nsponge-work of threads but a foam-work, consisting everywhere of septa\r\ninterposed among the granules. This is the hypothesis which sundry\r\nmicroscopists espouse, and which seems mechanically the most feasible: the\r\nonly one which consists with the \"streaming\" of protoplasm. Ordinarily the\r\nname protoplasm is applied to the aggregate mass--the semi-liquid, hyaline\r\nsubstance and the granules or microsomes it contains.\r\n\r\nWhat these granules or microsomes are--whether, as some have contended,\r\nthey are the essential living elements of the protoplasm, or whether, as is\r\notherwise held, they are nutritive particles, is at present undecided. But\r\nthe fact, alleged by sundry observers, that the microsomes often form rows,\r\nheld together by intervening substance, seems to imply that these minute\r\nbodies are not inert. Leaving aside unsettled questions, however, one fact\r\nof significance is manifest--an immense multiplication of surfaces over\r\nwhich inter-action may take place. Anyone who drops into dilute sulphuric\r\nacid a small nail and then drops a pinch of iron filings, will be shown, by\r\nthe rapid disappearance of the last and the long continuance of the first,\r\nhow greatly the increasing of surfaces by multiplication of fragments\r\nfacilitates change. The effect of subdivision in producing a large area in\r\na small space, is shown in the lungs, where the air-cells on the sides of\r\nwhich the blood-vessels ramify, are less than 1/100th of an inch in\r\ndiameter, while they number 700,000,000. In the composition of every tissue\r\nwe see the same principle. The living part, or protoplasm, is divided into\r\ninnumerable protoplasts, among which are distributed the materials and\r\nagencies producing changes. And now we find this principle carried still\r\ndeeper in the structure of the protoplasm itself. Each microscopic portion\r\nof it is minutely divided in such ways that its threads or septa have\r\nmultitudinous contacts with those included portions of matter which take\r\npart in its activities.\r\n\r\nConcerning the protoplasm contained in each cell, named by some cytoplasm,\r\nit remains to say that it always includes a small body called the\r\ncentrosome, which appears to have a directive function. Usually the\r\ncentrosome lies outside the nucleus, but is alleged to be sometimes within\r\nit. During what is called the \"resting stage,\" or what might more properly\r\nbe called the growing stage (for clearly the occasional divisions imply\r\nthat in the intervals between them there has been increase) the centrosome\r\nremains quiescent, save in the respect that it exercises some coercive\r\ninfluence on the protoplasm around. This results in the radially-arranged\r\nlines constituting an \"aster.\" What is the nature of the coercion exercised\r\nby the centrosome--a body hardly distinguishable in size from the\r\nmicrosomes or granules of protoplasm around--is not known. It can scarcely\r\nbe a repelling force; since, in a substance of liquid or semi-liquid kind,\r\nthis could not produce approximately straight lines. That it is an\r\nattractive force seems more probable; and the nature of the attraction\r\nwould be comprehensible did the centrosome augment in bulk with rapidity.\r\nFor if integration were in progress, the drawing in of materials might well\r\nproduce converging lines. But this seems scarcely a tenable interpretation;\r\nsince, during the so-called \"resting stage,\" this star-like structure\r\nexists--exists, that is, while no active growth of the centrosome is going\r\non.\r\n\r\nRespecting this small body we have further to note that, like the cell as a\r\nwhole, it multiplies by fission, and that the bisection of it terminates\r\nthe resting or growing stage and initiates those complicated processes by\r\nwhich two cells are produced out of one: the first step following the\r\nfission being the movement of the halves, with their respective completed\r\nasters, to the opposite sides of the nucleus.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 74c. With the hypothesis, now general, that the nucleus or kernel of a\r\ncell is its essential part, there has not unnaturally grown up the dogma\r\nthat it is always present; but there is reason to think that the evidence\r\nis somewhat strained to justify this dogma.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, beyond the cases in which the nucleus, though\r\nordinarily invisible, is said to have been rendered visible by a re-agent,\r\nthere are cases, as in the already-named _Archerina_, where no re-agent\r\nmakes one visible. In the second place, there is the admitted fact that\r\nsome nuclei are diffused; as in _Trachelocerca_ and some other Infusoria.\r\nIn them the numerous scattered granules are supposed to constitute a\r\nnucleus: an interpretation obviously biassed by the desire to save the\r\ngeneralization. In the third place, the nucleus is frequently multiple in\r\ncells of low types; as in some families of Algæ and predominantly among\r\nFungi. Once more, the so-called nucleus is occasionally a branching\r\nstructure scarcely to be called a \"kernel.\"\r\n\r\nThe facts as thus grouped suggest that the nucleus has arisen in conformity\r\nwith the law of evolution--that the primitive protoplast, though not\r\nhomogeneous in the full sense, was homogeneous in the sense of being a\r\nuniformly granular protoplasm; and that the protoplasts with diffused\r\nnuclei, together with those which are multi-nucleate, and those which have\r\nnuclei of a branching form, represent stages in that process by which the\r\nrelatively homogeneous protoplast passed into the relatively heterogeneous\r\none now almost universal.\r\n\r\nConcerning the structure and composition of the developed nucleus, the\r\nprimary fact to be named is that, like the surrounding granular cytoplasm,\r\nit is formed of two distinct elements. It has a groundwork or matrix not\r\ndiffering much from that of the cytoplasm, and at some periods continuous\r\nwith it; and immersed in this it has a special matter named chromatin,\r\ndistinguished from its matrix by becoming dyed more or less deeply when\r\nexposed to fit re-agents. During the \"resting stage,\" or period of growth\r\nand activity which comes between periods of division, the chromatin is\r\ndispersed throughout the ground-substance, either in discrete portions or\r\nin such way as to form an irregular network or sponge-work, various in\r\nappearance. When the time for fission is approaching this dispersed\r\nchromatin begins to gather itself together: reaching its eventual\r\nconcentration through several stages. By its concentration are produced the\r\nchromosomes, constant in number in each species of plant or animal. It is\r\nalleged that the substance of the chromosomes is not continuous, but\r\nconsists of separate elements or granules, which have been named\r\nchromomeres; and it is also alleged that, whether in the dispersed or\r\nintegrated form, each chromosome retains its individuality--that the\r\nchromomeres composing it, now spreading out into a network and now uniting\r\ninto a worm-like body, form a group which never loses its identity. Be this\r\nas it may, however, the essential fact is that during the growth-period the\r\nchromatin substance is widely distributed, and concentration of it is one\r\nof the chief steps towards a division of the nucleus and presently of the\r\ncell.\r\n\r\nDuring this process of mitosis or karyokinesis, the dispersed chromatin\r\nhaving passed through the coil-stage, reaches presently the star-stage, in\r\nwhich the chromosomes are arranged symmetrically about the equatorial plane\r\nof the nucleus. Meanwhile in each of them there has been a preparation for\r\nsplitting longitudinally in such way that the halves when separated contain\r\n(or are assumed to contain) equal numbers of the granules or chromomeres,\r\nwhich some think are the ultimate morphological units of the chromosomes. A\r\nsimultaneous change has occurred: there has been in course of formation a\r\nstructure known as the _amphiaster_. The two centrosomes which, as before\r\nsaid, place themselves on opposite sides of the nucleus, become the\r\nterminal poles of a spindle-shaped arrangement of fibres, arising mainly\r\nfrom the groundwork of the nucleus, now continuous with the groundwork of\r\nthe cytoplasm. A conception of this structure may be formed by supposing\r\nthat the radiating fibres of the respective asters, meeting one another and\r\nuniting in the intermediate space, thereafter exercise a tractive force;\r\nsince it is clear that, while the central fibres of the bundle will form\r\nstraight lines, the outer ones, pulling against one another not in straight\r\nlines, will form curved lines, becoming more pronounced in their curvatures\r\nas the distance from the axis increases. That a tractive force is at work\r\nseems inferable from the results. For the separated halves of the split\r\nchromosomes, which now form clusters on the two sides of the equatorial\r\nplane, gradually part company, and are apparently drawn as clusters towards\r\nthe opposing centrosomes. As this change progresses the original nucleus\r\nloses its individuality. The new chromosomes, halves of the previous\r\nchromosomes, concentrate to found two new nuclei; and, by something like a\r\nreversal of the stages above described, the chromatin becomes dispersed\r\nthroughout the substance of each new nucleus. While this is going on the\r\ncell itself, undergoing constriction round its equator, divides into two.\r\n\r\nMany parts of this complex process are still imperfectly understood, and\r\nvarious opinions concerning them are current. But the essential facts are\r\nthat this peculiar substance, the chromatin, at other times existing\r\ndispersed, is, when division is approaching, gathered together and dealt\r\nwith in such manner as apparently to insure equal quantities being\r\nbequeathed by the mother-cell to the two daughter-cells.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 74d. What is the physiological interpretation of these structures and\r\nchanges? What function does the nucleus discharge; and, more especially,\r\nwhat is the function discharged by the chromatin? There have been to these\r\nquestions sundry speculative answers.\r\n\r\nThe theory espoused by some, that the nucleus is the regulative organ of\r\nthe cell, is met by difficulties. One of them is that, as pointed out in\r\nthe chapter on \"Structure,\" the nucleus, though morphologically central, is\r\nnot central geometrically considered; and that its position, often near to\r\nsome parts of the periphery and remote from others, almost of itself\r\nnegatives the conclusion that its function is directive in the ordinary\r\nsense of the word. It could not well control the cytoplasm in the same ways\r\nin all directions and at different distances. A further difficulty is that\r\nthe cytoplasm when deprived of its nucleus can perform for some time\r\nvarious of its actions, though it eventually dies without reproducing\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nFor the hypothesis that the nucleus is a vehicle for transmitting\r\nhereditary characters, the evidence seems strong. When it was shown that\r\nthe head of a spermatozoon is simply a detached nucleus, and that its\r\nfusion with the nucleus of an ovum is the essential process initiating the\r\ndevelopment of a new organism, the legitimate inference appeared to be that\r\nthese two nuclei convey respectively the paternal and maternal traits which\r\nare mingled in the offspring. And when there came to be discerned the\r\nkaryokinesis by which the chromatin is, during cell-fission, exactly halved\r\nbetween the nuclei of the daughter-cells, the conclusion was drawn that the\r\nchromatin is more especially the agent of inheritance. But though, taken by\r\nthemselves, the phenomena of fertilization seem to warrant this inference,\r\nthe inference does not seem congruous with the phenomena of ordinary\r\ncell-multiplication--phenomena which have nothing to do with fertilization\r\nand the transmission of hereditary characters. No explanation is yielded of\r\nthe fact that ordinary cell-multiplication exhibits an elaborate process\r\nfor exact halving of the chromatin. Why should this substance be so\r\ncarefully portioned out among the cells of tissues which are not even\r\nremotely concerned with propagation of the species? If it be said that the\r\nend achieved is the conveyance of paternal and maternal qualities in equal\r\ndegrees to every tissue; then the reply is that they do not seem to be\r\nconveyed in equal degrees. In the offspring there is not a uniform\r\ndiffusion of the two sets of traits throughout all parts, but an irregular\r\nmixture of traits of the one with traits of the other.\r\n\r\nIn presence of these two suggested hypotheses and these respective\r\ndifficulties, may we not suspect that the action of the chromatin is one\r\nwhich in a way fulfils both functions? Let us consider what action may do\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 74e. The chemical composition of chromatin is highly complex, and its\r\ncomplexity, apart from other traits, implies relative instability. This is\r\nfurther implied by the special natures of its components. Various analyses\r\nhave shown that it consists of an organic acid (which has been called\r\nnucleic acid) rich in phosphorus, combined with an albuminous substance:\r\nprobably a combination of various proteids. And the evidence, as summarised\r\nby Wilson, seems to show that where the proportion of phosphorized acid is\r\nhigh the activity of the substance is great, as in the heads of\r\nspermatozoa; while, conversely, where the quantity of phosphorus is\r\nrelatively small, the substance approximates in character to the cytoplasm.\r\nNow (like sulphur, present in the albuminoid base), phosphorus is an\r\nelement which, besides having several allotropic forms, has a great\r\naffinity for oxygen; and an organic compound into which it enters, beyond\r\nthe instability otherwise caused, has a special instability caused by its\r\npresence. The tendency to undergo change will therefore be great when the\r\nproportion of the phosphorized component is great. Hence the statement that\r\n\"the chemical differences between chromatin and cytoplasm, striking and\r\nconstant as they are, are differences of degree only;\" and the conclusion\r\nthat the activity of the chromatin is specially associated with the\r\nphosphorus.[26]\r\n\r\nWhat, now, are the implications? Molecular agitation results from\r\ndecomposition of each phosphorized molecule: shocks are continually\r\npropagated around. From the chromatin, units of which are thus ever falling\r\ninto stabler states, there are ever being diffused waves of molecular\r\nmotion, setting up molecular changes in the cytoplasm. The chromatin stands\r\ntowards the other contents of the cell in the same relation that a\r\nnerve-element stands to any element of an organism which it excites: an\r\ninterpretation congruous with the fact that the chromatin is as near to as,\r\nand indeed nearer than, a nerve-ending to any minute structure stimulated\r\nby it.\r\n\r\nSeveral confirmatory facts may be named. During the intervals between\r\ncell-fissions, when growth and the usual cell-activities are being carried\r\non, the chromatin is dispersed throughout the nucleus into an irregular\r\nnetwork: thus greatly increasing the surface of contact between its\r\nsubstance and the substances in which it is imbedded. As has been remarked,\r\nthis wide distribution furthers metabolism--a metabolism which in this case\r\nhas, as we infer, the function of generating, not special matters but\r\nspecial motions. Moreover, just as the wave of disturbance a nerve carries\r\nproduces an effect which is determined, not by anything which is peculiar\r\nin itself, but by the peculiar nature of the organ to which it is\r\ncarried--muscular, glandular or other; so here, the waves diffused from the\r\nchromatin do not determine the kinds of changes in the cytoplasm, but\r\nsimply excite it: its particular activities, whether of movement,\r\nabsorption, or structural excretion, being determined by its constitution.\r\nAnd then, further, we observe a parallelism between the metabolic changes\r\nin the two cases; for, on the one hand, \"diminished staining capacity of\r\nthe chromatin [implying a decreased amount of phosphorus, which gives the\r\nstaining capacity] occurs during a period of intense constructive activity\r\nin the cytoplasm;\" and, on the other hand, in high organisms having nervous\r\nsystems, the intensity of nervous action is measured by the excretion of\r\nphosphates--by the using up of the phosphorus contained in nerve-cells.\r\n\r\nFor thus interpreting the respective functions of chromatin and cytoplasm,\r\nyet a further reason may be given. One of the earliest general steps in the\r\nevolution of the _Metazoa_, is the differentiation of parts which act from\r\nparts which make them act. The _Hydrozoa_ show us this. In the hydroid\r\nstage there are no specialized contractile organs: these are but incipient:\r\nindividual ectoderm cells have muscular processes. Nor is there any\r\n\"special aggregation of nerve-cells.\" If any stimulating units exist they\r\nare scattered. But in the _Medusa_-stage nerve-matter is collected into a\r\nring round the edge of the umbrella. That is to say, in the undeveloped\r\nform such motor action as occurs is not effected by a specialized part\r\nwhich excites another part; but in the developed form a differentiation of\r\nthe two has taken place. All higher types exhibit this differentiation. Be\r\nit muscle or gland or other operating organ, the cause of its activity lies\r\nnot in itself but in a nervous agent, local or central, with which it is\r\nconnected. Hence, then, there is congruity between the above interpretation\r\nand certain general truths displayed by animal organization at large. We\r\nmay infer that in a way parallel to that just indicated, cell-evolution\r\nwas, under one of its aspects, a change from a stage in which the exciting\r\nsubstance and the substance excited were mingled with approximate\r\nuniformity, to a stage in which the exciting substance was gathered\r\ntogether into the nucleus and finally into the chromosomes: leaving behind\r\nthe substance excited, now distinguished as cytoplasm.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 74f. Some further general aspects of the phenomena appear to be in\r\nharmony with this interpretation. Let us glance at them.\r\n\r\nIn Chapters III and IIIA of the First Part, reasons were given for\r\nconcluding that in the animal organism nitrogenous substances play the part\r\nof decomposing agents to the carbo-hydrates--that the molecular disturbance\r\nset up by the collapse of a proteid molecule destroys the equilibrium of\r\nsundry adjacent carbo-hydrate molecules, and causes that evolution of\r\nenergy which accompanies their fall into molecules of simpler compounds.\r\nHere, if the foregoing argument is valid, we may conclude that this highly\r\ncomplex phosphorized compound which chromatin contains, plays the same part\r\nto the adjacent nitrogenous compounds as these play to the carbo-hydrates.\r\nIf so, we see arising a stage earlier that \"general physiological method\"\r\nillustrated in § 23f. It was there pointed out that in animal organisms the\r\nvarious structures are so arranged that evolution of a small amount of\r\nenergy in one, sets up evolution of a larger amount of energy in another;\r\nand often this multiplied energy undergoes a second multiplication of like\r\nkind. If this view is tenable, we may now suspect that this method\r\ndisplayed in the structures of the _Metazoa_ was initiated in the\r\nstructures of the _Protozoa_, and consequently characterizes those\r\nhomologues of them which compose the _Metazoa_.\r\n\r\nWhen contemplated from the suggested point of view, karyokinesis appears to\r\nbe not wholly incomprehensible. For if the chromatin yields the energy\r\nwhich initiates changes throughout the rest of the cell, we may see why\r\nthere eventually arises a process for exact halving of the chromatin in a\r\nmother-cell between two daughter-cells. To make clear the reason, let us\r\nsuppose the portioning out of the chromatin leaves one of the two with a\r\nsensibly smaller amount than the other. What must result? Its source of\r\nactivity being relatively less, its rate of growth and its energy of action\r\nwill be less. If a protozoon, the weaker progeny arising by division of it\r\nwill originate an inferior stirp, unable to compete successfully with that\r\narising from the sister-cell endowed with a larger portion of chromatin. By\r\ncontinual elimination of the varieties which produce unequal halving,\r\nnecessarily at a disadvantage if a moiety of their members tend continually\r\nto disappear, there will be established a variety in which the halving is\r\nexact: the character of this variety being such that all its members aid\r\nthe permanent multiplication of the species. If, again, the case is that of\r\na metazoon, there will be the same eventual result. An animal or plant in\r\nwhich the chromatin is unequally divided among the cells, must have tissues\r\nof uncertain formation. Assume that an organ has, by survival of the\r\nfittest, been adjusted in the proportions and qualities of its parts to a\r\ngiven function. If the multiplying protoplasts, instead of taking equal\r\nportions of chromatin, have some of them smaller portions, the parts of the\r\norgan formed of these, developing less rapidly and having inferior\r\nenergies, will throw the organ out of adjustment, and the individual will\r\nsuffer in the struggle for life. That is to say, irregular division of the\r\nchromatin will introduce a deranging factor and natural selection will weed\r\nout individuals in which it occurs. Of course no interpretation is thus\r\nyielded of the special process known as karyokinesis. Probably other modes\r\nof equal division might have arisen. Here the argument implies merely that\r\nthe tendency of evolution is to establish _some_ mode. In verification of\r\nthe view that equal division arises from the cause named, it is pointed out\r\nto me that amitosis, which is a negation of mitosis or karyokinesis, occurs\r\nin transitory tissues or diseased tissues or where degeneracy is going on.\r\n\r\nBut how does all this consist with the conclusion that the chromatin\r\nconveys hereditary traits--that it is the vehicle in which the\r\nconstitutional structure, primarily of the species and secondarily of\r\nrecent ancestors and parents, is represented? To this question there seems\r\nto be no definite answer. We may say only that this second function is not\r\nnecessarily in conflict with the first. While the unstable units of\r\nchromatin, ever undergoing changes, diffuse energy around, they may also be\r\nunits which, under the conditions furnished by fertilization, gravitate\r\ntowards the organization of the species. Possibly it may be that the\r\ncomplex combination of proteids, common to chromatin and cytoplasm, is that\r\npart in which the constitutional characters inhere; while the phosphorized\r\ncomponent, falling from its unstable union and decomposing, evolves the\r\nenergy which, ordinarily the cause of changes, now excites the more active\r\nchanges following fertilization. This suggestion harmonizes with the fact\r\nthat the fertilizing substance which in animals constitutes the head of the\r\nspermatozoon, and in plants that of the spermatozoid or antherozoid, is\r\ndistinguished from the other agents concerned by having the highest\r\nproportion of the phosphorized element; and it also harmonizes with the\r\nfact that the extremely active changes set up by fertilization are\r\naccompanied by decrease of this phosphorized element. Speculation aside,\r\nhowever, we may say that the two functions of the chromatin do not exclude\r\none another, but that the general activity which originates from it may be\r\nbut a lower phase of that special activity caused by fertilization.[27]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 74g. Here we come unawares to the remaining topic embraced under the\r\ntitle Cell-Life and Cell-Multiplication. We pass naturally from asexual\r\nmultiplication of cells to sexual multiplication--from cell-reproduction to\r\ncell-generation. The phenomena are so numerous and so varied that a large\r\npart of them must be passed over. Conjugation among the _Protophyta_ and\r\n_Protozoa_, beginning with cases in which there is a mingling of the\r\ncontents of two cells in no visible respect different from one another, and\r\ndeveloping into a great variety of processes in which they differ, must be\r\nleft aside, and attention limited to the terminal process of fertilization\r\nas displayed in higher types of organisms.\r\n\r\nBefore fertilization there occurs in the ovum an incidental process of a\r\nstrange kind--\"strange\" because it is a collateral change taking no part in\r\nsubsequent changes. I refer to the production and extrusion of the \"polar\r\nbodies.\" It is recognized that the formation of each is analogous to\r\ncell-formation in general; though process and product are both dwarfed.\r\nApart from any ascribed meaning, the fact itself is clear. There is an\r\nabortive cell-formation. Abortiveness is seen firstly in the diminutive\r\nsize of the separated body or cell, and secondly in the deficient number of\r\nits chromosomes: a corresponding deficiency being displayed in the group of\r\nchromosomes remaining in the egg--remaining, that is (on the hypothesis\r\nhere to be suggested), in the sister-cell, supposing the polar body to be\r\nan aborted cell. It is currently assumed that the end to be achieved by\r\nthus extruding part of the chromosomes, is to reduce the remainder to half\r\nthe number characterizing the species; so that when, to this group in the\r\ngerm-cell, the sperm-cell brings a similarly-reduced group, union of the\r\ntwo shall bring the chromosomes to the normal number. I venture to suggest\r\nanother interpretation. In doing this, however, I must forestall a\r\nconclusion contained in the next chapter; namely, the conclusion that\r\ngamogenesis begins when agamogenesis is being arrested by unfavourable\r\nconditions, and that the failing agamogenesis initiates the gamogenesis. Of\r\nnumerous illustrations to be presently given I will, to make clear the\r\nconception, name only one--the formation of fructifying organs in plants at\r\ntimes when, and in places where, shoots are falling off in vigour and\r\nleaves in size. Here the successive foliar organs, decreasingly fitted\r\nalike in quality and dimensions for carrying on their normal lives, show us\r\nan approaching cessation of asexual multiplication, ending in the aborted\r\nindividuals we call stamens; and the fact that sudden increase of nutrition\r\nwhile gamogenesis is being thus initiated, causes resumption of\r\nagamogenesis, shows that the gamogenesis is consequent upon the failing\r\nagamogenesis. See then the parallel. On going back from multicellular\r\norganisms to unicellular organisms (or those homologues of them which form\r\nthe reproductive agents in multicellular organisms), we find the same law\r\nhold. The polar bodies are aborted cells, indicating that asexual\r\nmultiplication can no longer go on, and that the conditions leading to\r\nsexual multiplication have arisen. If this be so, decrease in the chromatin\r\nbecomes an initial cause of the change instead of an accompanying incident;\r\nand we need no longer assume that a quantity of precious matter is lost,\r\nnot by passive incapacity, but by active expulsion. Another anomaly\r\ndisappears. If from the germ-cell there takes place this extrusion of\r\nsuperfluous chromatin, the implication would seem to be that a parallel\r\nextrusion takes place from the sperm-cell. But this is not true. In the\r\nsperm-cell there occurs just that failure in the production of chromatin\r\nwhich, according to the hypothesis above sketched out, is to be expected;\r\nfor, in the process of cell-multiplication, the cells which become\r\nspermatozoa are _left_ with half the number of chromosomes possessed by\r\npreceding cells: there is actually that impoverishment and declining vigour\r\nhere suggested as the antecedent of fertilization. It needs only to imagine\r\nthe ovum and the polar body to be alike in size, to see the parallelism;\r\nand to see that obscuration of it arises from the accumulation of cytoplasm\r\nin the ovum.\r\n\r\nA test fact remains. Sometimes the first polar body extruded undergoes\r\nfission while the second is being formed. This can have nothing to do with\r\nreducing the number of chromosomes in the ovum. Unquestionably, however,\r\nthis change is included with the preceding changes in one transaction,\r\neffected by one influence. If, then, it is irrelevant to the decrease of\r\nchromosomes, so must the preceding changes be irrelevant: the hypothesis\r\nlapses. Contrariwise this fact supports the view suggested above. That\r\nextrusion of a polar body is a process of cell-fission is congruous with\r\nthe fact that another fission occurs after extrusion. And that this occurs\r\nirregularly shows that the vital activities, seen in cell-growth and\r\ncell-multiplication, now succeed in producing further fission of the\r\ndwarfed cell and now fail: the energies causing asexual multiplication are\r\nexhausted and there arises the state which initiates sexual multiplication.\r\n\r\nMaturation of the ovum having been completed, entrance of the spermatozoon,\r\nsometimes through the limiting membrane and sometimes through a micropyle\r\nor opening in it, takes place. This instantly initiates a series of\r\ncomplicated changes: not many seconds passing before there begins the\r\nformation of an aster around one end of the spermatozoon-head. The growth\r\nof this aster, apparently by linear rangings of the granules composing the\r\nreticulum of the germ-cell, progresses rapidly; while the whole structure\r\nhence arising moves inward. Soon there takes place the fusion of this\r\nsperm-nucleus with the germ-nucleus to form the cleavage-nucleus, which,\r\nafter a pause, begins to divide and subdivide in the same manner as cells\r\nat large: so presently forming a cluster of cells out of which arise the\r\nlayers originating the embyro. The details of this process do not concern\r\nus. It suffices to indicate thus briefly its general nature.\r\n\r\nAnd now ending thus the account of genesis under its histological aspect,\r\nwe pass to the account of genesis under its wider and more significant\r\naspects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nGENESIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 75. Having, in the last chapter but one, concluded what constitutes an\r\nindividual, and having, in the last chapter, contemplated the histological\r\nprocess which initiates a new individual, we are in a position to deal with\r\nthe multiplication of individuals. For this, the title Genesis is here\r\nchosen as being the most comprehensive title--the least specialized in its\r\nmeaning. By some biologists Generation has been used to signify one method\r\nof multiplication, and Reproduction to signify another method; and each of\r\nthese words has been thus rendered in some degree unfit to signify\r\nmultiplication in general.\r\n\r\nHere the reader is indirectly introduced to the fact that the production of\r\nnew organisms is carried on in fundamentally unlike ways. Up to quite\r\nrecent times it was believed, even by naturalists, that all the various\r\nprocesses of multiplication observable in different kinds of organisms,\r\nhave one essential character in common: it was supposed that in every\r\nspecies the successive generations are alike. It has now been proved,\r\nhowever, that in many plants and in numerous animals, the successive\r\ngenerations are not alike; that from one generation there proceeds another\r\nwhose members differ more or less in structure from their parents; that\r\nthese produce others like themselves, or like their parents, or like\r\nneither; but that eventually, the original form re-appears. Instead of\r\nthere being, as in the cases most familiar to us, a constant recurrence of\r\nthe same form, there is a cyclical recurrence of the same form. These two\r\ndistinct processes of multiplication, may be aptly termed _homogenesis_ and\r\n_heterogenesis_.[28] Under these heads let us consider them.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of homogenesis, the simplest of them, probably once\r\nuniversal but now exceptional, being that in which there is no other form\r\nof multiplication than one resulting from perpetual spontaneous fission.\r\nThe rise of distinct sexes was doubtless a step in evolution, and before it\r\ntook place the formation of new individuals could have arisen only by\r\ndivision of the old, either into two or into many. At present this process\r\nsurvives, so far as appears, among _Bacteria_, certain _Algæ_, and sundry\r\n_Protozoa_; though it is possible that a rarely-occurring conjugation has\r\nin these cases not yet been observed. It is a probable conclusion, however,\r\nthat in the _Bacteria_ at any rate, the once universal mode of\r\nmultiplication still survives as an exceptional mode. But now passing over\r\nthese cases, we have to note that the kind of genesis (once supposed to be\r\nthe sole kind), in which the successive generations are alike, is sexual\r\ngenesis, or, as it has been otherwise called--_gamogenesis_. In every\r\nspecies which multiplies by this kind of homogenesis, each generation\r\nconsists of males and females; and from the fertilized germs they produce\r\nthe next generation of similar males and females arises: the only needful\r\nqualification of this statement being that in many _Protophyta_ and\r\n_Protozoa_ the conjugating cells or protoplasts are not distinguishable in\r\ncharacter. This mode of propagation has the further trait, that each\r\nfertilized germ usually gives rise to but one individual--the product of\r\ndevelopment is organized round one axis and not round several axes,\r\nHomogenesis in contrast with heterogenesis as exhibited in species which\r\ndisplay distinct sexuality, has also the characteristic that each new\r\nindividual begins as an egg detached from the maternal tissues, instead of\r\nbeing a portion of protoplasm continuous with them, and that its\r\ndevelopment proceeds independently. This development may be carried on\r\neither internally or externally; whence results the division into the\r\noviparous and the viviparous. The oviparous kind is that in which the\r\nfertilized germ is extruded from the parent before it has undergone any\r\nconsiderable development. The viviparous kind is that in which development\r\nis considerably advanced, or almost completed, before extrusion takes\r\nplace. This distinction is, however, not a sharply-defined one: there are\r\ntransitions between the oviparous and the viviparous processes. In\r\novo-viviparous genesis there is an internal incubation; and though the\r\nyoung are in this case finally extruded from the parent in the shape of\r\neggs, they do not leave the parent's body until after they have assumed\r\nsomething like the parental form. Looking around, we find that homogenesis\r\nis universal among the _Vertebrata_. Every vertebrate animal arises from a\r\nfertilized germ, and unites into its single individuality the whole product\r\nof this fertilized germ. In the mammals or highest _Vertebrata_, this\r\nhomogenesis is in every case viviparous; in birds it is uniformly\r\noviparous; and in reptiles and fishes it is always essentially oviparous,\r\nthough there are cases of the kind above referred to, in which viviparity\r\nis simulated. Passing to the _Invertebrata_, we find oviparous homogenesis\r\nuniversal among the _Arachnida_ (except the Scorpions, which are\r\novo-viviparous); universal among the higher _Crustacea_, but not among the\r\nlower; extremely general, though not universal, among Insects; and\r\nuniversal among the higher _Mollusca_ though not among the lower. Along\r\nwith extreme inferiority among animals, we find homogenesis to be the\r\nexception rather than the rule; and in the vegetal kingdom there appear to\r\nbe no cases, except among the _Algæ_ and a few aberrant parasites like the\r\n_Rafflesiaceæ_, in which the centre or axis which arises from a fertilized\r\ngerm becomes the immediate producer of fertilized germs.\r\n\r\nIn propagation characterized by unlikeness of the successive generations,\r\nthere is asexual genesis with occasionally-recurring sexual genesis; in\r\nother words--_agamogenesis_ interrupted more or less frequently by\r\n_gamogenesis_. If we set out with a generation of perfect males and\r\nfemales, then, from their ova arise individuals which are neither males nor\r\nfemales, but which produce the next generation from buds. By this method of\r\nmultiplication many individuals originate from a single fertilized germ.\r\nThe product of development is organized round more than one centre or axis.\r\nThe simplest form of heterogenesis is that seen in most uniaxial plants.\r\nIf, as we find ourselves obliged to do, we regard each separate shoot or\r\naxis of growth as a distinct individual, homogenesis is seen in those which\r\nhave absolutely terminal flowers; but in all other uniaxial plants, the\r\nsuccessive individuals are not represented by the series A, A, A, A, &c.,\r\nbut they are represented by the series A, B, A, B, A, B, &c. For in the\r\nmajority of plants which were classed as uniaxial (§ 50), and which may be\r\nconveniently so distinguished from other plants, the axis which shoots up\r\nfrom the seed, and substantially constitutes the plant, does not itself\r\nflower but gives lateral origin to flowering axes. Though in ordinary\r\nuniaxial plants the fructifying apparatus _appears_ to be at the end of the\r\nprimary, vertical axis; yet dissection shows that, morphologically\r\nconsidered, each fructifying axis is an offspring from the primary axis.\r\nThere arises from the seed a sexless individual, from which spring by\r\ngemmation individuals having reproductive organs; and from these there\r\nresult fertilized germs or seeds that give rise to sexless individuals.\r\nThat is to say, gamogenesis and agamogenesis alternate: the peculiarity\r\nbeing that the sexual individuals arise from the sexless ones by continuous\r\ndevelopment. The _Salpæ_ show us an allied form of heterogenesis in the\r\nanimal kingdom. Individuals developed from fertilized ova, instead of\r\nthemselves producing fertilized ova, produce, by gemmation, strings of\r\nindividuals from which fertilized ova again originate. In multiaxial\r\nplants, we have a succession of generations represented by the series A, B,\r\nB, B, &c., A, B, B, B, &c. Supposing A to be a flowering axis or sexual\r\nindividual, then, from any fertilized germ it casts off, there grows up a\r\nsexless individual, B; from this there bud-out other sexless individuals,\r\nB, and so on for generations more or less numerous, until at length, from\r\nsome of these sexless individuals, there bud-out seed-bearing individuals\r\nof the original form A. Branched herbs, shrubs, and trees, exhibit this\r\nform of heterogenesis: the successive generations of sexless individuals\r\nthus produced being, in most cases, continuously developed, or aggregated\r\ninto a compound individual, but being in some cases discontinuously\r\ndeveloped. Among animals a kind of heterogenesis represented by the same\r\nsuccession of letters, occurs in such compound polypes as the _Sertularia_,\r\nand in those of the _Hydrozoa_ which assume alternately the polypoid form\r\nand the form of the _Medusa_. The chief differences presented by these\r\ngroups arise from the fact that the successive generations of sexless\r\nindividuals produced by budding, are in some cases continuously developed,\r\nand in others discontinuously developed; and from the fact that, in some\r\ncases, the sexual individuals give off their fertilized germs while still\r\ngrowing on the parent-polypedom, but in other cases not until after leaving\r\nthe parent-polypedom and undergoing further development. Where, as in all\r\nthe foregoing kinds of agamogenesis, the new individuals bud out, not from\r\nany specialized reproductive organs but from unspecialized parts of the\r\nparent, the process has been named, by Prof. Owen, _metagenesis_. In most\r\ninstances the individuals thus produced grow from the outsides of the\r\nparents--the metagenesis is external. But there is also a kind of\r\nmetagenesis which we may distinguish as internal. Certain _entozoa_ of the\r\ngenus _Distoma_ exhibit it. From the egg of a _Distoma_ there results a\r\nrudely-formed creature known as a sporocyst and from this a redia.\r\nGradually, as this divides and buds, the greater part of the inner\r\nsubstance is transformed into young animals called _Cercariæ_ (which are\r\nthe larvæ of _Distomata_); until at length it becomes little more than a\r\nliving sac full of living offspring. In the _Distoma pacifica_, the brood\r\nof young animals thus arising by internal gemmation are not _Cercariæ_, but\r\nare like their parent: themselves becoming the producers of _Cercariæ_,\r\nafter the same manner, at a subsequent period. So that now the succession\r\nof forms is represented by the series A, B, A, B, &c., now by the series A,\r\nB, B, A, B, B, &c., and now by A, B, B, C, A. Both cases, however,\r\nexemplify internal metagenesis in contrast with the several kinds of\r\nexternal metagenesis described above. That agamogenesis which is carried on\r\nin a reproductive organ--either an ovarium or the homologue of one--has\r\nbeen called, by Prof. Owen, _parthenogenesis_. It is the process familiarly\r\nexemplified in the _Aphides_. Here, from the fertilized eggs laid by\r\nperfect females there grow up imperfect females, in the ovaria of which are\r\ndeveloped ova that though unfertilized, rapidly assume the organization of\r\nother imperfect females, and are born viviparously. From this second\r\ngeneration of imperfect females, there by-and-by arises, in the same\r\nmanner, a third generation of the same kind; and so on for many\r\ngenerations: the series being thus symbolized by the letters A, B, B, B, B,\r\nB, &c., A. Respecting this kind of heterogenesis it should be added that,\r\nin animals as in plants, the number of generations of sexless individuals\r\nproduced before the re-appearance of sexual ones, is indefinite; both in\r\nthe sense that in the same species it may go on to a greater or less extent\r\naccording to circumstances, and in the sense that among the generations of\r\nindividuals proceeding from the same fertilized germ, a recurrence of\r\nsexual individuals takes place earlier in some of the diverging lines of\r\nmultiplication than in others. In trees we see that on some branches\r\nflower-bearing axes arise while other branches are still producing only\r\nleaf-bearing axes; and in the successive generations of _Aphides_ a\r\nparallel fact has been observed. Lastly has to be set down that kind of\r\nheterogenesis in which, along with gamogenesis, there occurs a form of\r\nagamogenesis exactly like it, save in the absence of fecundation. This is\r\ncalled true parthenogenesis--reproduction carried on by virgin mothers\r\nwhich are in all respects like other mothers. Among silk-worm-moths this\r\nparthenogenesis is exceptional rather than ordinary. Usually the eggs of\r\nthese insects are fertilized; but if they are not they are still laid, and\r\nsome of them produce larvæ. In certain _Lepidoptera_, however, of the\r\ngroups _Psychidæ_ and _Tineidæ_, parthenogenesis appears to be a normal\r\nprocess--indeed, so far as is known, the only process; for of some species\r\nthe males have never been found.\r\n\r\nA general conception of the relations among the different modes of Genesis,\r\nthus briefly described, will be best given by the following tabular\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n  GENESIS is\r\n                                            { Oviparous\r\n                                            {    or\r\n  Homogenesis, which is usually Gamogenesis { Ovo-viviparous\r\n                                            {    or\r\n                                            { Viviparous\r\n             or\r\n                          { Gamogenesis\r\n                          {  alternating\r\n  Heterogenesis, which is {  with        { Parthenogenesis\r\n                          { Agamogenesis {       or    { Internal\r\n                                         { Metagenesis {   or\r\n                                                       { External\r\n\r\nThis, like all other classifications of such phenomena, presents anomalies.\r\nIt may be justly objected that the processes here grouped under the head\r\nagamogenesis, are the same as those before grouped under the head of\r\ndiscontinuous development (§ 50): thus making development and genesis\r\npartially coincident. Doubtless it seems awkward that what are from one\r\npoint of view considered as structural changes are from another point of\r\nview considered as modes of multiplication.[29] There is, however, nothing\r\nfor us but a choice of imperfections. We cannot by any logical dichotomies\r\naccurately express relations which, in Nature, graduate into one another\r\ninsensibly. Neither the above, nor any other scheme, can do more than give\r\nan approximate idea of the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 76. Genesis under every form is a process of negative or positive\r\ndisintegration; and is thus essentially opposed to that process of\r\nintegration which is the primary process in individual evolution. Negative\r\ndisintegration occurs in those cases where, as among the compound\r\n_Hydrozoa_, there is a continuous development of new individuals by budding\r\nfrom the bodies of older individuals; and where the older individuals are\r\nthus prevented from growing to a greater size, or reaching a higher degree\r\nof integration. Positive disintegration occurs in those forms of\r\nagamogenesis where the production of new individuals is discontinuous, as\r\nwell as in all cases of gamogenesis. The degrees of disintegration are\r\nvarious. At the one extreme the parent organism is completely broken up, or\r\ndissolved into new individuals; and at the other extreme each new\r\nindividual forms but a small deduction from the parent organism. _Protozoa_\r\nand _Protophyta_ show us that form of disintegration called spontaneous\r\nfission: two or more individuals being produced by the splitting-up of the\r\noriginal one. The _Volvox_ and the _Hydrodictyon_ are plants which, having\r\ndeveloped broods within themselves, give them exit by bursting; and among\r\nanimals the one lately referred to which arises from the _Distoma_ egg,\r\nentirely loses its individuality in the individualities of the numerous\r\n_Distoma_-larvæ with which it becomes filled. Speaking generally, the\r\ndegree of disintegration becomes less marked as we approach the higher\r\norganic forms. Plants of superior types throw off from themselves, whether\r\nby gamogenesis or agamogenesis, parts that are relatively small; and among\r\nsuperior animals there is no case in which the parent individuality is\r\nhabitually lost in the production of new individuals. To the last, however,\r\nthere is of necessity a greater or less disintegration. The seeds and\r\npollen-grains of a flowering plant are disintegrated portions of tissue; as\r\nare also the ova and spermatozoa of animals. And whether the fertilized\r\ngerms carry away from their parents small or large quantities of nutriment,\r\nthese quantities in all cases involve further negative or positive\r\ndisintegrations of the parents.\r\n\r\nExcept in spore-producing plants, new individuals which result from\r\nagamogenesis usually do not separate from the parent-individuals until they\r\nhave undergone considerable development, if not complete development. The\r\nagamogenetic offspring of those lowest organisms which develop centrally,\r\ndo not, of course, pass beyond central structure; but the agamogenetic\r\noffspring of organisms which develop axially, commonly assume an axial\r\nstructure before they become independent. The vegetal kingdom shows us this\r\nin the advanced organization of detached bulbils, and of buds that root\r\nthemselves before separating. Of animals, the _Hydrozoa_, the _Trematoda_,\r\nand the _Salpæ_, present us with different kinds of agamogenesis, in all of\r\nwhich the new individuals are organized to a considerable extent before\r\nbeing cast off. This rule is not without exceptions, however. The\r\nstatoblasts of the _Plumatella_ (which play the part of winter eggs),\r\ndeveloped in an unspecialized part of the body, furnish a case of\r\nmetagenesis in which centres of development, instead of axes, are detached;\r\nand in the above-described parthenogenesis of moths and bees, such centres\r\nare detached from an ovarium.\r\n\r\nWhen produced by gamogenesis, the new individuals become (in a\r\nmorphological sense) independent of the parents while still in the shape of\r\ncentres of development, rather than axes of development; and this even\r\nwhere the reverse is apparently the case. The fertilized germs of those\r\ninferior plants which are central, or multicentral, in their development,\r\nare of course thrown off as centres; and the same is usually the case even\r\nin those which are uniaxial or multiaxial. In the higher plants, of the two\r\nelements that go to the formation of the fertilized germ, the pollen-cell\r\nis absolutely separated from the parent-plant under the shape of a centre,\r\nand the egg-cell, though not absolutely separated from the parent, is still\r\nno longer subordinate to the organizing forces of the parent. So that when,\r\nafter the egg-cell has been fertilized by matter from the pollen-tube, the\r\ndevelopment commences, it proceeds without parental control: the new\r\nindividual, though remaining physically united with the old individual,\r\nbecomes structurally and functionally separate: the old individual doing no\r\nmore than supply materials. Throughout the animal kingdom, the new\r\nindividuals produced by gamogenesis are obviously separated in the shape of\r\ncentres of development wherever the reproduction is oviparous: the only\r\nconspicuous variation being in the quantity of nutritive matter bequeathed\r\nby the parent at the time of separation. And though, where the reproduction\r\nis viviparous, the process appears to be different, and in one sense is so,\r\nyet, intrinsically, it is the same. For in these cases the new individual\r\nreally detaches itself from the parent while still only a centre of\r\ndevelopment; but instead of being finally cast off in this state it is\r\nre-attached, and supplied with nutriment until it assumes a more or less\r\ncomplete axial structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 77. As we have lately seen, the essential act in gamogenesis is the union\r\nof two cell-nuclei, produced in the great majority of cases by different\r\nparent organisms.  Nearly always the containing cells, often called\r\n_gametes_, are unlike: the sperm-cell being the male product, and the\r\ngerm-cell the female. But among some _Protozoa_ and many of the lower\r\n_Algæ_ and _Fungi_, the uniting cells show no differentiation. Sexuality is\r\nonly nascent.\r\n\r\nThere are very many modes and modifications of modes in which these cells\r\nare produced; very many modes and modifications of modes by which they are\r\nbrought into contact; and very many modes and modifications of modes by\r\nwhich the resulting fertilized germs have secured to them the fit\r\nconditions for their development. But passing over these divergent and\r\nre-divergent kinds of sexual multiplication, which it would take too much\r\nspace here to specify, the one universal trait is this coalescence of a\r\ndetached portion of one organism with a more or less detached portion of\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nSuch simple _Algæ_ as the _Desmidieæ_, which are sometimes called\r\nunicellular plants, show us a coalescence, not of detached portions of two\r\norganisms, but of two entire organisms: the entire contents of the\r\nindividuals uniting to form the germ-mass. Where, as among the\r\n_Confervoideæ_, we have aggregated cells whose individualities are scarcely\r\nat all subordinate to that of the aggregate, the gamogenetic act is often\r\neffected by the union \"of separate motile protoplasmic masses produced by\r\nthe division of the contents of any cell of the aggregate. These\r\nfree-swimming masses of protoplasm, which are quite similar to (but\r\ngenerally smaller than) the agamogenetic 'zoospores' of the same plants,\r\nand to the free-swimming individuals of many _Protophyta_, are apparently\r\nthe primitive type of gametes (conjugating cells); but it is noteworthy\r\nthat such a gamete nearly always unites with one derived from another cell\r\nor from another individual. The same fact holds with regard to the gametes\r\nof the Protophytes themselves, which are formed in the same way from the\r\nsingle cell of the mother individual. In the higher types of\r\n_Confervoideæ_, and in _Vaucheria_, we find these equivalent,\r\nfree-swimming, gametes replaced by sexually differentiated sperm- and\r\ngerm-cells, in some cases arising in different organs set apart for their\r\nproduction, and essentially representing those found in the higher plants.\r\nTransitional forms, intermediate between these and the cases where\r\nequivalent gametes are formed from any cell of the plant are also known.\"\r\n\r\nRecent investigations concerning the conjugation of _Protozoa_ have shown\r\nthat there is not, as was at one time thought, a fusion of two\r\nindividualities, but a fusion of parts of their nuclei. The macro-nucleus\r\nhaving disappeared, and the micro-nucleus having broken up into portions,\r\neach individual receives from the other one of these portions, which\r\nbecomes fused with its own nuclear matter. So that even in these humble\r\nforms, where there is no differentiation of sexes, the union is not between\r\nelements that have arisen in the same individual but between those which\r\nhave arisen in different individuals: the parts being in this case alike.\r\n\r\nThe marvellous phenomena initiated by the meeting of sperm-cell and\r\ngerm-cell, or rather of their nuclei, naturally suggest the conception of\r\nsome quite special and peculiar properties possessed by these cells. It\r\nseems obvious that this mysterious power which they display of originating\r\na new and complex organism, distinguishes them in the broadest way from\r\nportions of organic substance in general. Nevertheless, the more we study\r\nthe evidence the more are we led towards the conclusion that these cells\r\nare not fundamentally different from other cells. The first fact which\r\npoints to this conclusion is the fact recently dwelt upon (§ 63), that in\r\nmany plants and inferior animals, a small fragment of tissue which is but\r\nlittle differentiated, is capable of developing into an organism like that\r\nfrom which it was taken. This implies that the component units of tissues\r\nhave inherent powers of arranging themselves into the forms of the\r\norganisms which originated them. And if in these component units, which we\r\ndistinguished as physiological, such powers exist,--if, under fit\r\nconditions, and when not much specialized, they manifest such powers in a\r\nway as marked as that in which the contents of sperm-cells and germ-cells\r\nmanifest them; then, it becomes clear that the properties of sperm-cells\r\nand germ-cells are not so peculiar as we are apt to assume. Again, the\r\norgans emitting sperm-cells and germ-cells have none of the specialities of\r\nstructure which might be looked for, did sperm-cells and germ-cells need\r\nendowing with properties unlike those of all other organic agents. On the\r\ncontrary, these reproductive centres proceed from tissues characterized by\r\ntheir low organization. In plants, for example, it is not appendages that\r\nhave acquired considerable structure which produce the fructifying\r\nparticles: these arise at the extremities of the axes where the degree of\r\nstructure is the least. The cells out of which come the egg and the\r\npollen-grains, are formed from undifferentiated tissue in the interior of\r\nthe ovule and of the stamen. Among many inferior animals devoid of special\r\nreproductive organs, such as the _Hydra_, the ova and spermatozoa originate\r\nfrom the interstitial cells of the ectoderm, which lie among the bases of\r\nthe functional cells--have not been differentiated for function; and in the\r\n_Medusæ_, according to Weismann, they arise in the homologous layer, save\r\nwhere the medusoid form remains attached, and then they arise in the\r\nendoderm and migrate to the ectoderm: lack of specialization being in all\r\ncases implied. Then in the higher animals these same generative agents\r\nappear to be merely modified epithelium-cells--cells not remarkable for\r\ntheir complexity of structure but rather for their simplicity.  If, by way\r\nof demurrer to this view, it be asked why other epithelium-cells do not\r\nexhibit like properties; there are two replies. The first is that other\r\nepithelium-cells are usually so far changed to fit them to their special\r\nfunctions that they are unfitted for assuming the reproductive function.\r\nThe second is that in some cases, where they are but little specialized,\r\nthey _do_ exhibit the like properties: not, indeed, by uniting with other\r\ncells to produce new germs but by producing new germs without such union. I\r\nlearn from Dr. Hooker that the _Begonia phyllomaniaca_ habitually develops\r\nyoung plants from the scales of its stem and leaves--nay, that many young\r\nplants are developed by a single scale. The epidermal cells composing one\r\nof these scales swell, here and there, into large globular cells; form\r\nchlorophyll in their interiors; shoot out rudimentary axes; and then, by\r\nspontaneous constrictions, cut themselves off; drop to the ground; and grow\r\ninto Begonias. Moreover, in a succulent English plant, the _Malaxis\r\npaludosa_, a like process occurs: the self-detached cells being, in this\r\ncase, produced by the surfaces of the leaves.[30]  Thus, there is no\r\nwarrant for the assumption that sperm-cells and germ-cells possess powers\r\nfundamentally unlike those of other cells. The inference to which the facts\r\npoint, is, that they differ from the rest mainly in not having undergone\r\nfunctional adaptations. They are cells which have departed but little from\r\nthe original and most general type: such specializations as some of them\r\nexhibit in the shape of locomotive appliances, being interpretable as\r\nextrinsic modifications which have reference to nothing beyond certain\r\nmechanical requirements. Sundry facts tend likewise to show that there does\r\nnot exist the profound distinction we are apt to assume between the male\r\nand female reproductive elements. In the common polype sperm-cells and\r\ngerm-cells are developed in the same layer of indifferent tissue; and in\r\n_Tethya_, one of the sponges, Prof. Huxley has observed that they occur\r\nmingled together in the general parenchyma. The pollen-grains and\r\nembryo-cells of plants arise in adjacent parts of the meristematic tissue\r\nof the flower-bud; and from the description of a monstrosity in the\r\nPassion-flower, recently given by Mr. Salter to the Linnæan Society, it\r\nappears both that ovules may, in their general structure, graduate into\r\nanthers, and that they may produce pollen in their interiors. Moreover,\r\namong the lower _Algæ_, which show the beginning of sexual differentiation,\r\nthe smaller gametes, which we must regard as incipient sperm-cells, are\r\nsometimes able to fuse _inter se_, and give rise to a zygote which will\r\nproduce a new plant. All which evidence is in perfect harmony with the\r\nforegoing conclusion; since, if sperm-cells and germ-cells have natures not\r\nessentially unlike those of unspecialized cells in general, their natures\r\ncannot be essentially unlike each other.\r\n\r\nThe next general fact to be noted is that these cells whose union\r\nconstitutes the essential act of gamogenesis, are cells in which the\r\ndevelopmental changes have come to a close--cells which are incapable of\r\nfurther evolution. Though they are not, as many cells are, unfitted for\r\ngrowth and metamorphosis by being highly specialized, yet they have lost\r\nthe power of growth and metamorphosis. They have severally reached a state\r\nof equilibrium. And while the internal balance of forces prevents a\r\ncontinuance of constructive changes, it is readily overthrown by external\r\ndestructive forces. For it almost uniformly happens that sperm-cells and\r\ngerm-cells which are not brought in contact disappear. In a plant, the\r\negg-cell, if not fertilized, is absorbed or dissipated, while the ovule\r\naborts; and the unimpregnated ovum eventually decomposes: save, indeed, in\r\nthose types in which parthenogenesis is a part of the normal cycle.\r\n\r\nSuch being the characters of these cells, and such being their fates if\r\nkept apart, we have now to observe what happens when they are united.  In\r\nplants the extremity of the elongated pollen-cell applies itself to the\r\nsurface of the embryo-sac, and one of its nuclei having, with some\r\nprotoplasm, passed into the egg-cell, there becomes fused with the nucleus\r\nof the egg-cell. Similarly in animals, the spermatozoon passes through the\r\nlimiting membrane of the ovum, and a mixture takes place between the\r\nsubstance of its nucleus and the substance of the nucleus of the ovum. But\r\nthe important fact which it chiefly concerns us to notice, is that on the\r\nunion of these reproductive elements there begins, either at once or on the\r\nreturn of favourable conditions, a new series of developmental changes. The\r\nstate of equilibrium at which each had arrived is destroyed by their mutual\r\ninfluence, and the constructive changes, which had come to a close,\r\nrecommence. A process of cell-multiplication is set up; and the resulting\r\ncells presently begin to aggregate into the rudiment of a new organism.\r\n\r\nThus, passing over the variable concomitants of gamogenesis, and confining\r\nour attention to what is constant in it, we see:--that there is habitually,\r\nif not universally, a fusion of two portions of organic substance which are\r\neither themselves distinct individuals, or are thrown off by distinct\r\nindividuals; that these portions of organic substance, which are severally\r\ndistinguished by their low degree of specialization, have arrived at states\r\nof structural quiescence or equilibrium; that if they are not united this\r\nequilibrium ends in dissolution; but that by the mixture of them this\r\nequilibrium is destroyed and a new evolution initiated.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 78. What are the conditions under which Genesis takes place? How does it\r\nhappen that some organisms multiply by homogenesis and others by\r\nheterogenesis? Why is it that where agamogenesis prevails it is usually\r\nfrom time to time interrupted by gamogenesis? A survey of the facts\r\ndiscloses certain correlations which, if not universal, are too general to\r\nbe without significance.\r\n\r\nWhere multiplication is carried on by heterogenesis we find, in numerous\r\ncases, that agamogenesis continues as long as the forces which result in\r\ngrowth are greatly in excess of the antagonist forces. Conversely, we find\r\nthat the recurrence of gamogenesis takes place when the conditions are no\r\nlonger so favourable to growth. In like manner where there is homogenetic\r\nmultiplication, new individuals are usually not formed while the preceding\r\nindividuals are still rapidly growing--that is, while the forces producing\r\ngrowth exceed the opposing forces to a great extent; but the formation of\r\nnew individuals begins when nutrition is nearly equalled by expenditure. A\r\nfew out of the many facts which seem to warrant these inductions must\r\nsuffice.\r\n\r\nThe relation in plants between fructification and innutrition (or rather,\r\nbetween fructification and such diminished nutrition as makes growth\r\nrelatively slow) was long ago asserted by a German biologist--Wolff, I am\r\ntold. Since meeting with this assertion I have examined into the facts for\r\nmyself. The result has been a conviction, strengthened by every inquiry,\r\nthat some such relation exists. Uniaxial plants begin to produce their\r\nlateral, flowering axes, only after the main axis has developed the great\r\nmass of its leaves, and is showing its diminished nutrition by smaller\r\nleaves, or shorter internodes, or both. In multiaxial plants two, three, or\r\nmore generations of leaf-bearing axes, or sexless individuals, are produced\r\nbefore any seed-bearing individuals show themselves. When, after this first\r\nstage of rapid growth and agamogenetic multiplication, some gamogenetic\r\nindividuals arise, they do so where the nutrition is least;--not on the\r\nmain axis, or on secondary axes, or even on tertiary axes, but on axes that\r\nare the most removed from the channels which supply nutriment. Again, a\r\nflowering axis is commonly less bulky than the others: either much shorter\r\nor, if long, much thinner. And further, it is an axis of which the terminal\r\ninternodes are undeveloped: the foliar organs, which instead of becoming\r\nleaves become sepals, and petals, and stamens, follow each other in close\r\nsuccession, instead of being separated by portions of the still-growing\r\naxis. Another group of evidences meets us when we observe the variations of\r\nfruit-bearing which accompany variations of nutrition in the plant regarded\r\nas a whole. Besides finding, as above, that gamogenesis commences only when\r\ngrowth has been checked by extension of the remoter parts to some distance\r\nfrom the roots, we find that gamogenesis is induced at an earlier stage\r\nthan usual by checking the nutrition. Trees are made to fruit while still\r\nquite small by cutting their roots or putting them into pots; and luxuriant\r\nbranches which have had the flow of sap into them diminished, by what\r\ngardeners call \"ringing,\" begin to produce flower-shoots instead of\r\nleaf-shoots. Moreover, it is to be remarked that trees which, by flowering\r\nearly in the year, seem to show a direct relation between gamogenesis and\r\nincreasing nutrition, really do the reverse; for in such trees the\r\nflower-buds are formed in the autumn. That structure which determines these\r\nbuds into sexual individuals is given when the nutrition is declining.\r\nConversely, very high nutrition in plants prevents, or arrests,\r\ngamogenesis. It is notorious that unusual richness of soil, or too large a\r\nquantity of manure, results in a continuous production of leaf-bearing or\r\nsexless shoots; and a like result happens when the cutting down of a tree,\r\nor of a large part of it, is followed by the sending out of new shoots:\r\nthese, supplied with excess of sap, are luxuriant and sexless. Besides\r\nbeing prevented from producing sexual individuals by excessive nutrition,\r\nplants are, by excessive nutrition, made to change the sexual individuals\r\nthey were about to produce, into sexless ones. This arrest of gamogenesis\r\nmay be seen in various stages. The familiar instance of flowers made barren\r\nby the transformation of their stamens into petals, shows us the lowest\r\ndegree of this reversed metamorphosis. Where the petals and stamens are\r\npartially changed into green leaves, the return towards the agamogenetic\r\nstructure is more marked; and it is still more marked when, as occasionally\r\nhappens in luxuriantly-growing plants, new flowering axes, and even\r\nleaf-bearing axes, grow out of the centres of flowers.[31] The anatomical\r\nstructure of the sexual axis affords corroborative evidence: giving the\r\nimpression, as it does, of an aborted sexless axis. Besides lacking those\r\ninternodes which the leaf-bearing axis commonly possesses, the flowering\r\naxis differs by the absence of rudimentary lateral axes. In a leaf-bearing\r\nshoot the axil of every leaf usually contains a small bud, which may or may\r\nnot develop into a lateral shoot; but though the petals of a flower are\r\nhomologous with leaves, they do not bear homologous buds at their bases.\r\nOrdinarily, too, the foliar appendages of sexual axes are much smaller than\r\nthose of sexless ones--the stamens and pistils especially, which are the\r\nlast formed, being extremely dwarfed; and it may be that the absence of\r\nchlorophyll from the parts of fructification is a fact of like meaning.\r\nMoreover, the formation of the seed-vessel appears to be a direct\r\nconsequence of arrested nutrition. If a gloved-finger be taken to represent\r\na growing shoot, (the finger standing for the pith of the shoot and the\r\nglove for the peripheral layers of meristem and young tissue, in which the\r\nprocess of growth takes place); and if it be supposed that there is a\r\ndiminished supply of material for growth; then, it seems a fair inference\r\nthat growth will first cease at the apex of the axis, represented by the\r\nend of the glove-finger; and supposing growth to continue in those parts of\r\nthe peripheral layers of young tissue that are nearer to the supply of\r\nnutriment, their further longitudinal extension will lead to the formation\r\nof a cavity at the extremity of the shoot, like that which results in a\r\nglove-finger when the finger is partially withdrawn and the glove sticks to\r\nits end. Whence it seems, both that this introversion of the apical\r\nmeristem may be considered as due to failing nutrition, and that the ovules\r\ngrowing from its introverted surface (which would have been its outer\r\nsurface but for the defective nutrition) are extremely aborted homologues\r\nof external appendages: both they and the pollen-grains being either\r\nmorphologically or literally quite terminal, and the last showing by their\r\ndehiscence the exhaustion of the organizing power.[32]\r\n\r\nThose kinds of animals which multiply by heterogenesis, present us with a\r\nparallel relation between the recurrence of gamogenesis and the recurrence\r\nof conditions checking rapid growth: at least, this is shown where\r\nexperiments have thrown light on the connexion of cause and effect; namely,\r\namong the _Aphides_. These creatures, hatched from eggs in the spring,\r\nmultiply by agamogenesis, which in this case is parthenogenesis, throughout\r\nthe summer. When the weather becomes cold and plants no longer afford\r\nabundant sap, perfect males and females are produced; and from gamogenesis\r\nresult fertilized ova. But beyond this evidence we have much more\r\nconclusive evidence. For it has been shown, both that the rapidity of the\r\nagamogenesis is proportionate to the warmth and nutrition, and that if the\r\ntemperature and supply of food be artificially maintained, the agamogenesis\r\ncontinues through the winter. Nay more--it not only, under these\r\nconditions, continues through one winter, but it has been known to continue\r\nfor four successive years: some forty or fifty sexless generations being\r\nthus produced. And those who have investigated the matter see no reason to\r\ndoubt the indefinite continuance of this agamogenetic multiplication, so\r\nlong as the external requirements are duly met. Evidence of another kind,\r\ncomplicated by special influences, is furnished by the heterogenesis of the\r\n_Daphnia_--a small crustacean commonly known as the Water-flea, which\r\ninhabits ponds and ditches. From the nature of its habitat this little\r\ncreature is exposed to very variable conditions. Besides being frozen in\r\nwinter, the small bodies of water in which it lives are often unduly heated\r\nby the summer Sun, or dried up by continued drought. The circumstances\r\nfavourable to the _Daphnia's_ life and growth, being thus liable to\r\ninterruptions which, in our climate, have a regular irregularity of\r\nrecurrence; we may, in conformity with the hypothesis, expect to find both\r\nthat the gamogenesis recurs along with declining physical prosperity and\r\nthat its recurrence is very variable. I use the expression \"declining\r\nphysical prosperity\" advisedly; since \"declining nutrition,\" as measured by\r\nsupply of food, does not cover all the conditions. This is shown by the\r\nexperiments of Weismann (abstracted for me by Mr. Cunningham) who found\r\nthat in various _Daphnideæ_ which bring forth resting eggs, sexual and\r\nasexual reproduction go on simultaneously, as well as separately, in the\r\nspring and summer: these variable results being adapted to variable\r\nconditions. For not only are these creatures liable to die from lack of\r\nfood, from the winter's cold, and from the drying up of their ditches, &c.,\r\nas well as from the over-heating of them, but during this period of\r\nover-heating they are liable to die from that deoxygenation of the water\r\nwhich heat causes. Manifestly the favourable and unfavourable conditions\r\nrecurring in combinations that are rarely twice alike, cannot be met by any\r\nregularly recurring form of heterogenesis; and it is interesting to see how\r\nsurvival of the fittest has established a mixed form. In the spring, as\r\nwell as in the autumn, there is in some cases a formation of resting or\r\nwinter eggs; and evidently these provide against the killing off of the\r\nwhole population by summer drought. Meanwhile, by ordinary males and\r\nfemales there is a production of summer eggs adapted to meet the incident\r\nof drying up by drought and subsequent re-supply of water. And all along\r\nsuccessive generations of parthenogenetic females effect a rapid\r\nmultiplication as long as conditions permit. Since life and growth are\r\nimpeded or arrested not by lack of food only, but by other unfavourable\r\nconditions, we may understand how change in one or more of these may set up\r\none or other form of genesis, and how the mixture of them may cause a mixed\r\nmode of multiplication which, originally initiated by external causes,\r\nbecomes by inheritance and selection a trait of the species.[33] And then\r\nin proof that external causes initiate these peculiarities, we have the\r\nfact that in certain _Daphnideæ_ \"which live in places where existence and\r\nparthenogenesis are possible throughout the year, the sexual period has\r\ndisappeared:\" there are no males.\r\n\r\nPassing now to animals which multiply by homogenesis--animals in which the\r\nwhole product of a fertilized germ aggregates round a single centre or axis\r\ninstead of round many centres or axes--we see, as before, that so long as\r\nthe conditions allow rapid increase in the mass of this germ-product, the\r\nformation of new individuals by gamogenesis does not take place. Only when\r\ngrowth is declining in relative rate, do perfect sperm-cells and germ-cells\r\nbegin to appear; and the fullest activity of the reproductive function\r\narises as growth ceases: speaking generally, at least; for though this\r\nrelation is tolerably definite in the highest orders of animals which\r\nmultiply by gamogenesis, it is less definite in the lower orders. This\r\nadmission does not militate against the hypothesis, as it seems to do; for\r\nthe indefiniteness of the relation occurs where the limit of growth is\r\ncomparatively indefinite. We saw (§ 46) that among active, hot-blooded\r\ncreatures, such as mammals and birds, the inevitable balancing of\r\nassimilation by expenditure establishes, for each species, an almost\r\nuniform adult size; and among creatures of these kinds (birds especially,\r\nin which this restrictive effect of expenditure is most conspicuous), the\r\nconnexion between cessation of growth and commencement of reproduction is\r\ndistinct. But we also saw (§ 46) that where, as in the Crocodile and the\r\nPike, the conditions and habits of life are such that expenditure does not\r\novertake assimilation as size increases, there is no precise limit of\r\ngrowth; and in creatures thus circumstanced we may naturally look for a\r\ncomparatively indeterminate relation between declining growth and\r\ncommencing reproduction.[34] There is, indeed, among fishes, at least one\r\ncase which appears very anomalous. The male parr, or young of the male\r\nsalmon, a fish of four or five inches in length, is said to produce milt.\r\nHaving, at this early stage of its growth, not one-hundredth of the weight\r\nof a full-grown salmon, how does its production of milt consist with the\r\nalleged general law? The answer must be in great measure hypothetical. If\r\nthe salmon is (as it appears to be in its young state) a species of\r\nfresh-water trout that has contracted the habit of annually migrating to\r\nthe sea, where it finds a food on which it thrives--if the original size of\r\nthis species was not much greater than that of the parr (which is nearly as\r\nlarge as some varieties of trout)--and if the limit of growth in the trout\r\ntribe is very indefinite, as we know it to be; then we may reasonably infer\r\nthat the parr has nearly the adult form and size which this species of\r\ntrout had before it acquired its migratory habit; and that this production\r\nof milt is, in such case, a concomitant of the incipient decline of growth\r\nnaturally arising in the species when living under the conditions of the\r\nancestral species. Should this be so, the immense subsequent growth of the\r\nparr into the salmon, consequent on a suddenly-increased facility in\r\nobtaining food, removes to a great distance the limit at which assimilation\r\nis balanced by expenditure; and has the effect, analogous to that produced\r\nin plants, of arresting the incipient reproductive process. A confirmation\r\nof this view may be drawn from the fact that when the parr, after its first\r\nmigration to the sea, returns to fresh water, having increased in a few\r\nmonths from a couple of ounces to five or six pounds, it no longer shows\r\nany fitness for propagation: the grilse, or immature salmon, does not\r\nproduce milt or spawn.\r\n\r\nWe conclude, then, that the products of a fertilized germ go on\r\naccumulating by simple growth, so long as the forces whence growth results\r\nare greatly in excess of the antagonist forces; but that when diminution of\r\nthe one set of forces or increase of the other, causes a considerable\r\ndecline in this excess and an approach towards equilibrium, fertilized\r\ngerms are again produced. Whether the germ-product be organized round one\r\naxis or round the many axes that arise by agamogenesis, matters not.\r\nWhether, as in the higher animals, this approach to equilibrium results\r\nfrom that disproportionate increase of expenditure entailed by increase of\r\nsize; or whether, as in most plants and many inferior animals, it results\r\nfrom absolute or relative decline of nutrition; matters not. In any case\r\nthe recurrence of gamogenesis is associated with a decrease in the excess\r\nof tissue-producing power. We cannot say, indeed, that this decrease always\r\nresults in gamogenesis: some organisms multiply for an indefinite period by\r\nagamogenesis only. The Weeping Willow, which has been propagated throughout\r\nEurope, does not seed in Europe; and yet, as the Weeping Willow, by its\r\nlarge size and the multiplication of generation upon generation of lateral\r\naxes, presents the same causes of local innutrition as other trees, we\r\ncannot ascribe the absence of sexual axes to the continued predominance of\r\nnutrition. Among animals, too, the anomalous case of the _Tineidæ_, a group\r\nof moths in which parthenogenetic multiplication goes on for generation\r\nafter generation, seems to imply that gamogenesis does not necessarily\r\nresult from an approximate balance of assimilation by expenditure. What we\r\nmust say is that an approach towards equilibrium between the forces which\r\ncause growth and the forces which oppose growth, is the chief condition to\r\nthe recurrence of gamogenesis; but that there appear to be other\r\nconditions, in the absence of which approach to equilibrium is not followed\r\nby gamogenesis.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 79. The above induction is an approximate answer to the question--_When_\r\ndoes gamogenesis recur? but not to the question which was propounded--_Why_\r\ndoes gamogenesis recur?--_Why_ cannot multiplication be carried on in all\r\ncases, as it is in many cases, by agamogenesis? As already said, biologic\r\nscience is not yet advanced enough to reply. Meanwhile, the evidence above\r\nbrought together suggests a certain hypothetical answer.\r\n\r\nSeeing, on the one hand, that gamogenesis recurs only in individuals which\r\nare approaching a state of organic equilibrium; and seeing, on the other\r\nhand, that the sperm-cells and germ-cells thrown off by such individuals\r\nare cells in which developmental changes have ended in quiescence, but in\r\nwhich, after their union, there arises a process of active cell-formation;\r\nwe may suspect that the approach towards a state of general equilibrium in\r\nsuch gamogenetic individuals, is accompanied by an approach towards\r\nmolecular equilibrium in them; and that the need for this union of\r\nsperm-cell and germ-cell is the need for overthrowing this equilibrium, and\r\nre-establishing active molecular change in the detached germ--a result\r\nprobably effected by mixing the slightly different physiological units of\r\nslightly different individuals. The several arguments which support this\r\nview, cannot be satisfactorily set forth until after the topics of Heredity\r\nand Variation have been dealt with. Leaving it for the present, I propose\r\nhereafter to re-consider it in connexion with sundry others raised by the\r\nphenomena of Genesis.\r\n\r\nBut before ending the chapter, it may be well to note the relations between\r\nthese different modes of multiplication, and the conditions of existence\r\nunder which they are respectively habitual. While the explanation of the\r\nteleologist is untrue, it is often an obverse to the truth; for though, on\r\nthe hypothesis of Evolution, it is clear that things are not arranged thus\r\nor thus for the securing of special ends, it is also clear that\r\narrangements which _do_ secure these special ends tend to establish\r\nthemselves--are established by their fulfilment of these ends. Besides\r\ninsuring a structural fitness between each kind of organism and its\r\ncircumstances, the working of \"natural selection\" also insures a fitness\r\nbetween the mode and rate of multiplication of each kind of organism and\r\nits circumstances. We may, therefore, without any teleological implication,\r\nconsider the fitness of homogenesis and heterogenesis to the needs of the\r\ndifferent classes of organisms which exhibit them.\r\n\r\nHeterogenesis prevails among organisms of which the food, though abundant\r\ncompared with their expenditure, is dispersed in such a way that it cannot\r\nbe appropriated in a wholesale manner. _Protophyta_, subsisting on diffused\r\ngases and decaying organic matter in a state of minute subdivision, and\r\n_Protozoa_, to which food comes in the shape of extremely small floating\r\nparticles, are enabled, by their rapid agamogenetic multiplication, to\r\nobtain materials for growth better than they would do did they not thus\r\ncontinually divide and disperse in pursuit of it. The higher plants, having\r\nfor nutriment the carbonic acid of the air and certain mineral components\r\nof the soil, show us modes of multiplication adapted to the fullest\r\nutilization of these substances. A herb with but little power of forming\r\nthe woody fibre requisite to make a stem that can support wide-spreading\r\nbranches, after producing a few sexless axes produces sexual ones; and\r\nmaintains its race better, by the consequent early dispersion of seeds,\r\nthan by a further production of sexless axes. But a tree, able to lift its\r\nsuccessive generations of sexless axes high into the air, where each gets\r\ncarbonic acid and light almost as freely as if it grew by itself, may with\r\nadvantage go on budding-out sexless axes year after year; since it thereby\r\nincreases its subsequent power of budding-out sexual axes. Meanwhile it may\r\nadvantageously transform into seed-bearers those axes which, in consequence\r\nof their less direct access to materials absorbed by the roots, are failing\r\nin their nutrition; for it thus throws off from a point at which sustenance\r\nis deficient, a migrating group of germs that may find sustenance\r\nelsewhere. The heterogenesis displayed by animals of the Coelenterate type\r\nhas evidently a like utility. A polype, feeding on minute annelids and\r\ncrustaceans which, flitting through the water, come in contact with its\r\ntentacles, and limited to that quantity of prey which chance brings within\r\nits grasp, buds out young polypes which, either as a colony or as dispersed\r\nindividuals, spread their tentacles through a larger space of water than\r\nthe parent alone can; and by producing them, the parent better insures the\r\ncontinuance of its species than it would do if it went on slowly growing\r\nuntil its nutrition was nearly balanced by its waste, and then multiplied\r\nby gamogenesis. Similarly with the _Aphis_. Living on sap sucked from\r\ntender shoots and leaves, and able thus to take in but a very small\r\nquantity in a given time, this creature's race is more likely to be\r\npreserved by a rapid asexual propagation of small individuals, which\r\ndisperse themselves over a wide area of nutrition, than it would be did the\r\nindividual growth continue so as to produce large individuals multiplying\r\nsexually. And then when autumnal cold and diminishing supply of sap put a\r\ncheck to growth, the recurrence of gamogenesis, or production of fertilized\r\nova which remain dormant through the winter, is more favourable to the\r\npreservation of the race than would be a further continuance of\r\nagamogenesis. On the other hand, among the higher animals living on food\r\nwhich, though dispersed, is more or less aggregated into large masses, this\r\nalternation of gamic and agamic reproduction ceases to be useful. The\r\ndevelopment of the germ-product into a single organism of considerable\r\nbulk, is in many cases a condition without which these large masses of\r\nnutriment could not be appropriated; and here the formation of many\r\nindividuals instead of one would be fatal. But we still see the beneficial\r\nresults of the general law--the postponement of gamogenesis until the rate\r\nof growth begins to decline. For so long as the rate of growth continues\r\nrapid, there is proof that the organism gets food with facility--that\r\nexpenditure does not seriously check accumulation; and that the size\r\nreached is as yet not disadvantageous: or rather, indeed, that it is\r\nadvantageous. But when the rate of growth is much decreased by the increase\r\nof expenditure--when the excess of assimilative power is diminishing so\r\nfast as to indicate its approaching disappearance--it becomes needful, for\r\nthe maintenance of the species, that this excess shall be turned to the\r\nproduction of new individuals; since, did growth continue until there was a\r\ncomplete balancing of assimilation and expenditure, the production of new\r\nindividuals would be either impossible or fatal to the parent. And it is\r\nclear that \"natural selection\" will continually tend to determine the\r\nperiod at which gamogenesis commences, in such a way as most favours the\r\nmaintenance of the race.\r\n\r\nHere, too, may fitly be pointed out the fact that, by \"natural selection,\"\r\nthere will in every case be produced the most advantageous proportion of\r\nmales and females. If the conditions of life render numerical inequality of\r\nthe sexes beneficial to the species, in respect either of the number of the\r\noffspring or the character of the offspring; then, those varieties of the\r\nspecies which approach more than other varieties towards this beneficial\r\ndegree of inequality, will be apt to supplant other varieties. And\r\nconversely, where equality in the number of males and females is\r\nbeneficial, the equilibrium will be maintained by the dying out of such\r\nvarieties as produce offspring among which the sexes are not balanced.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Such alterations of statement in this chapter as have been made\r\nnecessary by the advance of biological knowledge since 1864 have not, I\r\nthink, tended to invalidate its main theses, but have tended to verify\r\nthem. Some explanations to be here added may remove remaining difficulties.\r\n\r\nCertain types, which are transitional between _Protozoa_ and _Metazoa_,\r\nexhibit under its simplest form the relation between self-maintenance and\r\nrace-maintenance--the integration primarily effecting the one and the\r\ndisintegration primarily effecting the other. Among the _Mycetozoa_ a\r\nnumber of amoeba-like individuals aggregate into what is called a\r\nplasmodium; and while, in some orders, they become fused into a mass of\r\nprotoplasm through which their nuclei are dispersed, in other orders\r\n(_Sorophora_) they retain their individualities and simply form a coherent\r\naggregate. These last, presumably the earliest in order of evolution,\r\nremain united so long as the plasmodium, having a small power of\r\nlocomotion, furthers the general nutrition; but when this is impeded by\r\ndrought or cold, there arise spores. Each spore contains an amoeboid\r\nindividual; and this, escaping when favourable conditions return,\r\nestablishes by fission and by union with others like itself a new colony or\r\nplasmodium. Reduced to its lowest terms, we here see the antagonism between\r\nthat growth of the coherent mass of units which accompanies its physical\r\nprosperity, and that incoherence and dispersion of the units which follows\r\nunfavourable conditions and arrest of growth, and which presently initiates\r\nnew plasmodia.\r\n\r\nThis antagonism, seen in these incipient _Metazoa_ which show us none of\r\nthat organization characterizing the _Metazoa_ in general, is everywhere in\r\nmore or less disguised forms exhibited by them--must necessarily be so if\r\ngrowth of the individual is a process of integration while formation of new\r\nindividuals is a process of disintegration. And, primarily, it is an\r\nimplication that whatever furthers the one impedes the other.\r\n\r\nBut now while recognizing the truth that nutrition and innutrition (using\r\nthese words to cover not supply of nutriment only but the presence of other\r\ninfluences favourable or unfavourable to the vital processes) primarily\r\ndetermine the alternations of these; we have also to recognize the truth\r\nthat from the beginning survival of the fittest has been shaping the forms\r\nand effects of their antagonism. By inheritance a physiological habit which\r\nmodifies the form of the antagonism in a way favourable to the species,\r\nwill become established. Especially will this be the case where the lives\r\nof the individuals have become relatively definite and where special organs\r\nhave been evolved for casting off reproductive centres. The resulting\r\nphysiological rhythm may in such cases become so pronounced as greatly to\r\nobscure the primitive relation. Among plants we see this in the fact that\r\nthose which have been transferred from one habitat to another having widely\r\ndifferent seasons, long continue their original time of flowering, though\r\nit is inappropriate to the new circumstances--the reproductive periodicity\r\nhas become organic. Similarly in each species of higher animal, development\r\nof the reproductive organs and maturation of reproductive cells take place\r\nat a settled age, whether the conditions have been favourable or\r\nunfavourable to physical prosperity. The established constitutional\r\ntendency, adapted to the needs of the species, over-rides the\r\nconstitutional needs of the individual.\r\n\r\nEven here, however, the primitive antagonism, though greatly obscured,\r\noccasionally shows itself. Instance the fact that in plants where\r\ngamogenesis is commencing a sudden access of nutrition will cause\r\nresumption of agamogenesis; and I suspect that an illustration may be found\r\namong human beings in the earlier establishment of the reproductive\r\nfunction among the ill-fed poor than among the well-fed rich.\r\n\r\nOne other qualification has to be added. In plants and animals which have\r\nbecome so definitely constituted that at an approximately fixed stage, the\r\nproclivity towards the production of new individuals becomes pronounced, it\r\nnaturally happens that good nutrition aids it. Surplus nutriment being\r\nturned into the reproductive channel, the reproduction is efficient in\r\nproportion as the surplus is great. Hence the fact that in fruit trees\r\nwhich have reached the flowering stage, manuring has the effect that though\r\nit does not increase the quantity of blossoms it increases the quantity of\r\nfruit; and hence the fact that well-fed and easy-living races of men are\r\nprolific.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nHEREDITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 80. Already, in the last two chapters, the law of hereditary transmission\r\nhas been tacitly assumed; as, indeed, it unavoidably is in all such\r\ndiscussions. Understood in its entirety, the law is that each plant or\r\nanimal, if it reproduces, gives origin to others like itself: the likeness\r\nconsisting, not so much in the repetition of individual traits as in the\r\nassumption of the same general structure. This truth has been rendered so\r\nfamiliar by daily illustration as almost to have lost its significance.\r\nThat wheat produces wheat--that existing oxen have descended from ancestral\r\noxen--that every unfolding organism eventually takes the form of the class,\r\norder, genus, and species from which it sprang; is a fact which, by force\r\nof repetition, has acquired in our minds almost the aspect of a necessity.\r\nIt is in this, however, that Heredity is principally displayed: the\r\nmanifestations of it commonly referred to being quite subordinate. And, as\r\nthus understood, Heredity is universal. The various instances of\r\nheterogenesis lately contemplated seem, indeed, to be at variance with this\r\nassertion. But they are not really so. Though the recurrence of like forms\r\nis, in these instances, not direct but cyclical, still, the like forms do\r\nrecur; and, when taken together, the group of forms produced during one of\r\nthe cycles is as much like the groups produced in preceding cycles, as the\r\nsingle individual arising by homogenesis is like ancestral individuals.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, the general truth that organisms of a given type uniformly\r\ndescend from organisms of the same type, is so well established by infinite\r\nillustrations as to have assumed the character of an axiom; it is not\r\nuniversally admitted that non-typical peculiarities are inherited. Many\r\nentertain a vague belief that the law of Heredity applies only to main\r\ncharacters of structure and not to details; or, at any rate, that though it\r\napplies to such details as constitute differences of species, it does not\r\napply to smaller details. The circumstance that the tendency to repetition\r\nis in a slight degree qualified by the tendency to variation (which, as we\r\nshall hereafter see, is but an indirect result of the tendency to\r\nrepetition), leads some to doubt whether Heredity is unlimited. A careful\r\nweighing of the evidence, however, and a due allowance for the influences\r\nby which the minuter manifestations of Heredity are obscured, may remove\r\nthis scepticism.\r\n\r\nFirst in order of importance comes the fact that not only are there\r\nuniformly transmitted from an organism to its offspring, those traits of\r\nstructure which distinguish the class, order, genus, and species; but also\r\nthose which distinguish the variety. We have numerous cases, among both\r\nplants and animals, where, by natural or artificial conditions, there have\r\nbeen produced divergent modifications of the same species; and abundant\r\nproof exists that the members of any one sub-species habitually transmit\r\ntheir distinctive peculiarities to their descendants. Agriculturists and\r\ngardeners can furnish unquestionable illustrations. Several varieties of\r\nwheat are known, of which each reproduces itself. Since the potato was\r\nintroduced into England there have been formed from it a number of\r\nsub-species; some of them differing greatly in their forms, sizes,\r\nqualities, and periods of ripening. Of peas, also, the like may be said.\r\nAnd the case of the cabbage-tribe is often cited as showing the permanent\r\nestablishment of races which have diverged widely from a common stock.\r\nAmong fruits and flowers the multiplication of kinds, and the continuance\r\nof each kind with certainty by agamogenesis, and to some extent by\r\ngamogenesis, might be exemplified without end. From all sides evidence may\r\nbe gathered showing a like persistence of varieties among animals. We have\r\nour distinct breeds of sheep, our distinct breeds of cattle, our distinct\r\nbreeds of horses: each breed maintaining its characteristics. The many\r\nsorts of dogs which, if we accept the physiological test, we must consider\r\nas all of one species, show us in a marked manner the hereditary\r\ntransmission of small differences--each sort, when kept pure, reproducing\r\nitself not only in size, form, colour, and quality of hair, but also in\r\ndisposition and speciality of intelligence. Poultry, too, have their\r\npermanently-established races. And the Isle of Man sends us a tail-less\r\nkind of cat. Even in the absence of other evidence, that which ethnology\r\nfurnishes would suffice. Grant them to be derived from one stock, and the\r\nvarieties of man yield proof upon proof that non-specific traits of\r\nstructure are bequeathed from generation to generation. Or grant only their\r\nderivation from several stocks, and we still have, between races descended\r\nfrom a common stock, distinctions which prove the inheritance of minor\r\npeculiarities. Besides seeing the Negroes continue to produce Negroes,\r\ncopper-coloured men to produce men of a copper colour, and the fair-skinned\r\nraces to perpetuate their fair skins--besides seeing that the broad-faced\r\nand flat-nosed Calmuck begets children with broad faces and flat noses,\r\nwhile the Jew bequeaths to his offspring the features which have so long\r\ncharacterized Jews; we see that those small unlikenesses which distinguish\r\nmore nearly-allied varieties of men, are maintained from generation to\r\ngeneration. In Germany, the ordinary shape of skull is appreciably\r\ndifferent from that common in Britain: near akin though the Germans are to\r\nthe British. The average Italian face continues to be unlike the faces of\r\nnorthern nations. The French character is now, as it was centuries ago,\r\ncontrasted in sundry respects with the characters of neighbouring peoples.\r\nNay, even between races so closely allied as the Scotch Celts, the Welsh\r\nCelts, and the Irish Celts, appreciable differences of form and nature have\r\nbecome established.\r\n\r\nThe fact that sub-species and sub-sub-species thus exemplify the general\r\nlaw of inheritance which shows itself in the perpetuation of ordinal,\r\ngeneric, and species peculiarities, is strong reason for the belief that\r\nthis general lay is unlimited in its application. This has the support of\r\nstill more special evidences. They are divisible into two classes. In the\r\none come cases where congenital peculiarities, not traceable to any obvious\r\ncauses, are bequeathed to descendants. In the other come cases where the\r\npeculiarities thus bequeathed are not congenital, but have resulted from\r\nchanges of functions during the lives of the individuals bequeathing them.\r\nWe will consider first the cases that come in the first class.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 81. Note at the outset the character of the chief testimony. Excluding\r\nthose inductions that have been so fully verified as to rank with exact\r\nscience, there are no inductions so trustworthy as those which have\r\nundergone the mercantile test. When we have thousands of men whose profit\r\nor loss depends on the truth of their inferences from perpetually-repeated\r\nobservations; and when we find that their inferences, handed down from\r\ngeneration to generation, have generated an unshakable conviction; we may\r\naccept it without hesitation. In breeders of animals we have such a class,\r\nled by such experiences, and entertaining such a conviction--the conviction\r\nthat minor peculiarities of organization are inherited as well as major\r\npeculiarities. Hence the immense prices given for successful racers, bulls\r\nof superior forms, sheep that have certain desired peculiarities. Hence the\r\ncareful record of pedigrees of high-bred horses and sporting dogs. Hence\r\nthe care taken to avoid intermixture with inferior stocks. As quoted by Mr.\r\nDarwin, Youatt says the principle of selection \"enables the agriculturist\r\nnot only to modify the character of his flock but to change it altogether.\"\r\nLord Somerville, speaking of what breeders have done for sheep, says:--\"It\r\nwould seem that they have chalked upon a wall a form perfect in itself and\r\nthen given it existence.\" That most skilful breeder, Sir John Sebright,\r\nused to say, with respect to pigeons, that \"he would produce any given\r\nfeather in three years, but it would take him six years to obtain head and\r\nbeak.\" In all which statements the tacit assertion is, that individual\r\ntraits are bequeathed from generation to generation, and may be so\r\nperpetuated and increased as to become permanent distinctions.\r\n\r\nOf special instances there are many besides that of the often-cited\r\nOtto-breed of sheep, descended from a single short-legged lamb, and that of\r\nthe six-fingered Gratio Kelleia, who transmitted his peculiarity, in\r\ndifferent degrees, to several of his children and to some of his\r\ngrandchildren. In a paper contributed to the _Edinburgh New Philosophical\r\nJournal_ for July, 1863, Dr. (now Sir John) Struthers gives cases of\r\nhereditary digital variations. Esther P----, who had six fingers on one\r\nhand, bequeathed this malformation along some lines of her descendants for\r\ntwo, three, and four generations. A---- S---- inherited an extra digit on\r\neach hand and each foot from his father; and C---- G----, who also had six\r\nfingers and six toes, had an aunt and a grandmother similarly formed. A\r\ncollection of evidence published by Mr. Sedgwick in the _Medico-Chirurgical\r\nReview_ for April and for July, 1863, in two articles on \"The Influence of\r\nSex in limiting Hereditary Transmission,\" includes the following\r\ncases:--Augustin Duforet, a pastry-cook of Douai, who had but two instead\r\nof three phalanges to all his fingers and toes, inherited this malformation\r\nfrom his grandfather and father, and had it in common with an uncle and\r\nnumerous cousins. An account has been given by Dr. Lepine, of a man with\r\nonly three fingers on each hand and four toes on each foot, and whose\r\ngrandfather and son exhibited the like anomaly. Béchet describes Victoire\r\nBarré as a woman who, like her father and sister, had but one developed\r\nfinger on each hand and but two toes on each foot, and whose monstrosity\r\nre-appeared in two daughters. And there is a case where the absence of two\r\ndistal phalanges on the hands was traced for two generations. The various\r\nrecorded instances in which there has been transmission from one generation\r\nto another, of webbed-fingers, of webbed-toes, of hare-lip, of congenital\r\nluxation of the thigh, of absent patellæ, of club-foot, &c., would occupy\r\nmore space than can here be spared. Defects in the organs of sense are also\r\nnot unfrequently inherited. Four sisters, their mother, and grandmother,\r\nare described by Duval as similarly affected by cataract. Prosper Lucas\r\ndetails an example of amaurosis affecting the females of a family for three\r\ngenerations. Duval, Graffe, Dufon, and others testify to like cases coming\r\nunder their observation.[35] Deafness, too, is occasionally transmitted\r\nfrom parent to child. There are deaf-mutes whose imperfections have been\r\nderived from ancestors; and malformations of the external ears have also\r\nbeen perpetuated in offspring. Of transmitted peculiarities of the skin and\r\nits appendages, many cases have been noted. One is that of a family\r\nremarkable for enormous black eyebrows; another that of a family in which\r\nevery member had a lock of hair of a lighter colour than the rest on the\r\ntop of the head; and there are also instances of congenital baldness being\r\nhereditary. From one of our leading sculptors I learn that his wife has a\r\nflat mole under the foot near the little toe, and one of her sons has the\r\nsame. Entire absence of teeth, absence of particular teeth, and anomalous\r\narrangements of teeth, are recorded as traits that have descended to\r\nchildren. And we have evidence that soundness and unsoundness of teeth are\r\ntransmissible.\r\n\r\nThe inheritance of tendencies to such diseases as gout, consumption, and\r\ninsanity is universally admitted. Among the less-common diseases of which\r\nthe descent has been observed, are ichthyosis, leprosy, pityriasis,\r\nsebaceous tumours, plica polonica, dipsomania, somnambulism, catalepsy,\r\nepilepsy, asthma, apoplexy, elephantiasis. General nervousness displayed by\r\nparents almost always re-appears in their children. Even a bias towards\r\nsuicide appears to be sometimes hereditary.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 82. To prove the transmission of those structural peculiarities which\r\nhave resulted from functional peculiarities, is, for several reasons,\r\ncomparatively difficult. Changes produced in the sizes of parts by changes\r\nin their amounts of action, are mostly unobtrusive. A muscle which has\r\nincreased in bulk is usually so obscured by natural or artificial clothing,\r\nthat unless the alteration is extreme it passes without remark. Such\r\nnervous developments as are possible in the course of a single life, cannot\r\nbe seen externally. Visceral modifications of a normal kind are observable\r\nbut obscurely, or not at all. And if the changes of structure worked in\r\nindividuals by changes in their habits are thus difficult to trace, still\r\nmore difficult to trace must be the transmission of them: further hidden,\r\nas this is, by the influences of other individuals who are often otherwise\r\nmodified by other habits. Moreover, such specialities of structure as are\r\ndue to specialities of function, are usually entangled with specialities of\r\nstructure which are, or may be, due to selection, natural or artificial. In\r\nmost cases it is impossible to say that a structural peculiarity which\r\nseems to have arisen in offspring from a functional peculiarity in a\r\nparent, is wholly independent of some congenital peculiarity of structure\r\nin the parent, whence this functional peculiarity arose. We are restricted\r\nto cases with which natural or artificial selection can have had nothing to\r\ndo, and such cases are difficult to find. Some, however, may be noted.\r\n\r\nA species of plant that has been transferred from one soil or climate to\r\nanother, frequently undergoes what botanists call \"change of habit\"--a\r\nchange which, without affecting its specific characters, is yet\r\nconspicuous. In its new locality the species is distinguished by leaves\r\nthat are much larger or much smaller, or differently shaped, or more\r\nfleshy; or instead of being as before comparatively smooth, it becomes\r\nhairy; or its stem becomes woody instead of being herbaceous; or its\r\nbranches, no longer growing upwards, assume a drooping character. Now these\r\n\"changes of habit\" are clearly determined by functional changes. Occurring,\r\nas they do, in many individuals which have undergone the same\r\ntransportation, they cannot be classed as \"spontaneous variations.\" They\r\nare modifications of structure consequent on modifications of function that\r\nhave been produced by modifications in the actions of external forces. And\r\nas these modifications re-appear in succeeding generations, we have, in\r\nthem, examples of functionally-established variations that are hereditarily\r\ntransmitted.\r\n\r\nEvidence of analogous changes in animals is difficult to disentangle. Only\r\namong domesticated kinds have we any opportunity of tracing the results of\r\naltered habits; and here, in nearly all cases, artificial selection has\r\nobscured them. Still, there are some facts which seem to the point. Mr.\r\nDarwin, while ascribing almost wholly to \"natural selection\" the production\r\nof those modifications which eventuate in differences of species,\r\nnevertheless admits the effects of use and disuse. He says--\"I find in the\r\ndomestic duck that the bones of the wing weigh less and the bones of the\r\nleg more, in proportion to the whole skeleton, than do the same bones in\r\nthe wild duck; and I presume that this change may be safely attributed to\r\nthe domestic duck flying much less, and walking more, than its wild parent.\r\nThe great and inherited development of the udders in cows and goats in\r\ncountries where they are habitually milked, in comparison with the state of\r\nthese organs in other countries, is another instance of the effect of use.\r\nNot a single domestic animal can be named which has not in some country\r\ndrooping ears; and the view suggested by some authors, that the drooping is\r\ndue to the disuse of the muscles of the ear, from the animals not being\r\nmuch alarmed by danger, seems probable.\" Again--\"The eyes of moles and of\r\nsome burrowing rodents are rudimentary in size, and in some cases are quite\r\ncovered up by skin and fur. This state of the eyes is probably due to\r\ngradual reduction from disuse, but aided perhaps by natural selection.\" ...\r\n\"It is well known that several animals belonging to the most different\r\nclasses, which inhabit the caves of Styria and of Kentucky, are blind. In\r\nsome of the crabs the footstalk of the eye remains, though the eye is gone;\r\nthe stand for the telescope is there, though the telescope with its glasses\r\nhas been lost. As it is difficult to imagine that eyes, though useless,\r\ncould be in any way injurious to animals living in darkness, I attribute\r\ntheir loss wholly to disuse.\"[36] The direct inheritance of an acquired\r\npeculiarity is sometimes observable. Mr. Lewes gives a case. He \"had a\r\npuppy taken from its mother at six weeks old, who, although never taught\r\n'to beg' (an accomplishment his mother had been taught), spontaneously took\r\nto begging for everything he wanted when about seven or eight months old:\r\nhe would beg for food, beg to be let out of the room, and one day was found\r\nopposite a rabbit hutch begging for rabbits.\" Instances are on record, too,\r\nof sporting dogs which spontaneously adopted in the field, certain modes of\r\nbehaviour which their parents had learnt.\r\n\r\nBut the best examples of inherited modifications produced by modifications\r\nof function, occur in mankind. To no other cause can be ascribed the rapid\r\nmetamorphoses undergone by the British races when placed in new conditions.\r\nIn the United States the descendants of the immigrant Irish lose their\r\nCeltic aspect, and become Americanized. This cannot be ascribed to mixture,\r\nsince the feeling with which Irish are regarded by Americans prevents any\r\nconsiderable amount of intermarriage. Equally marked is the case of the\r\nimmigrant Germans who, though they keep very much apart, rapidly assume the\r\nprevailing type. To say that \"spontaneous variation\" increased by natural\r\nselection, can have produced this effect, is going too far. Peoples so\r\nnumerous cannot have been supplanted in the course of two or three\r\ngenerations by varieties springing from them. Hence the implication is that\r\nphysical and social conditions have wrought modifications of function and\r\nstructure, which offspring have inherited and increased. Similarly with\r\nspecial cases. In the _Cyclopædia of Practical Medicine_, Vol. II., p. 419,\r\nDr. Brown states that he \"has in many instances observed in the case of\r\nindividuals whose complexion and general appearance has been modified by\r\nresidence in hot climates, that children born to them subsequently to such\r\nresidence, have resembled them rather in their acquired than primary mien.\"\r\n\r\nSome visible modifications of organs caused by changes in their functions,\r\nmay be noted. That large hands are inherited by those whose ancestors led\r\nlaborious lives, and that those descended from ancestors unused to manual\r\nlabour commonly have small hands, are established opinions. It seems very\r\nunlikely that in the absence of any such connexion, the size of the hand\r\nshould have come to be generally regarded as some index of extraction. That\r\nthere exists a like relation between habitual use of the feet and largeness\r\nof the feet, we have strong evidence in the customs of the Chinese. The\r\ntorturing practice of artificially arresting the growth of the feet, could\r\nnever have become established among the ladies of China, had they not seen\r\nthat a small foot was significant of superior rank--that is of a luxurious\r\nlife--that is of a life without bodily labour. There is evidence, too, that\r\nmodifications of the eyes, caused by particular uses of the eyes, are\r\ninherited. Short sight appears to be uncommon among peasants; but it is\r\nfrequent among classes who use their eyes much for reading and writing, and\r\nis often congenital. Still more marked is this relation in Germany. There,\r\nthe educated are notoriously studious, and judging from the numbers of\r\nyoung Germans who wear spectacles, there is reason to think that congenital\r\nmyopia is very frequent among them.\r\n\r\nSome of the best illustrations of functional heredity, are furnished by\r\nmental characteristics. Certain powers which mankind have gained in the\r\ncourse of civilization cannot, I think, be accounted for without admitting\r\nthe inheritance of acquired modifications. The musical faculty is one of\r\nthese. To say that \"natural selection\" has developed it by preserving the\r\nmost musically endowed, seems an inadequate explanation. Even now that the\r\ndevelopment and prevalence of the faculty have made music an occupation by\r\nwhich the most musical can get sustenance and bring up families; it is very\r\nquestionable whether, taking the musical career as a whole, it has any\r\nadvantage over other careers in the struggle for existence and\r\nmultiplication. Still more if we look back to those early stages through\r\nwhich the faculty must have passed before definite perception of melody was\r\narrived at, we fail to see how those possessing the rudimentary faculty in\r\na somewhat greater degree than the rest, would thereby be enabled the\r\nbetter to maintain themselves and their children. There is no explanation\r\nbut that the habitual association of certain cadences of speech with\r\ncertain emotions, has slowly established in the race an organized and\r\ninherited connection between such cadences and such emotions; that the\r\ncombination of such cadences, more or less idealized, which constitutes\r\nmelody, has all along had a meaning in the average mind, only because of\r\nthe meaning which cadences had acquired in the average mind; and that by\r\nthe continual hearing and practice of melody there has been gained and\r\ntransmitted an increasing musical sensibility.  Confirmation of this view\r\nmay be drawn from individual cases. Grant that among a people endowed with\r\nmusical faculty to a certain degree, spontaneous variation will\r\noccasionally produce men possessing it in a higher degree; it cannot be\r\ngranted that spontaneous variation accounts for the frequent production, by\r\nsuch highly-endowed men, of men still more highly endowed. On the average,\r\nthe children of marriages with others not similarly endowed, will be less\r\ndistinguished rather than more distinguished. The most that can be expected\r\nis that this unusual amount of faculty shall re-appear in the next\r\ngeneration undiminished. How then shall we explain cases like those of\r\nBach, Mozart, and Beethoven, all of them sons of men having unusual musical\r\npowers who were constantly exercising those powers, and who greatly\r\nexcelled their fathers in their musical powers? What shall we say to the\r\nfacts that Haydn was the son of an organist, that Hummel was born to a\r\nmusic master, and that Weber's father was a distinguished violinist? The\r\noccurrence of so many cases in one nation within a short period of time,\r\ncannot rationally be ascribed to the coincidence of \"spontaneous\r\nvariations.\" It can be ascribed to nothing but inherited developments of\r\nstructure caused by augmentations of function.\r\n\r\nBut the clearest proof that structural alterations caused by alterations of\r\nfunction are inherited, occurs when the alterations are morbid. I had\r\noriginally named in this place the results of M. Brown-Sequard's\r\nexperiments on guinea-pigs, showing that those which had been artificially\r\nmade epileptic had offspring which were epileptic; and I name them again\r\nthough his inference is by many rejected. For, as exemplified a few pages\r\nback, strong evidence is often disregarded for trivial reasons by those who\r\ndislike the conclusion drawn. Just naming this evidence and its possible\r\ninvalidity, let me pass to some results of experiences recently set forth\r\nby Dr. Savage, President of the Neurological Society. In an essay on\r\n\"Heredity and Neurosis\" published in _Brain_, Parts LXXVII, LXXVIII, 1897,\r\nhe says:--\"We recognise the transmission of a tendency to develop gout, and\r\nwe recognise that the disease produced by the individual himself differs\r\nlittle from that which may have been inherited.\" [That is, acquired gout\r\nmay be transmitted as constitutional gout.] \"I have seen several patients\r\nwhose history I have been able to examine carefully, in whom mental tricks\r\nhave been transmitted from one generation to another.\" In the \"musical\r\nprodigies\" descending from musical parents, \"there seemed to be a\r\ntransmission of a greatly increased aptitude or tendency which is all one\r\nis contending for.\" \"Though there is, in my opinion, power to transmit\r\nacquired peculiarities, yet the tendency is to transmit a predisposition.\"\r\n(pp. 19-21.) And an authority on nervous diseases who is second to\r\nnone--Dr. Hughlings Jackson--takes the same view. The liability to\r\nconsumption shown by children of consumptive parents, which no one doubts,\r\nshows us the same thing. It is admitted that consumption may be produced by\r\nconditions very unfavourable to life; and unless it is held that the\r\ndisease so produced differs from the disease when inherited, the conclusion\r\nmust be that here, too, there is a transmission of functionally-produced\r\norganic changes. This holds true whether the production of tubercle is due\r\nto innate defect or whether it is due to the invasion of a bacillus. For in\r\nthis last case the consumptive diathesis must be regarded as a state of\r\nbody more than usually liable to invasion by the bacillus, and this is the\r\nsame when acquired as when transmitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 83. Two modified manifestations of Heredity remain to be noticed. The one\r\nis the re-appearance in offspring of traits not borne by the parents, but\r\nborne by the grandparents or by remoter ancestors. The other is the\r\nlimitation of Heredity by sex--the restriction of transmitted peculiarities\r\nto offspring of the same sex as the parent possessing them.\r\n\r\nAtavism, which is the name given to the recurrence of ancestral traits, is\r\nproved by many and varied facts. In the picture-galleries of old families,\r\nand on the monumental brasses in the adjacent churches, are often seen\r\ntypes of feature which are still, from time to time, repeated in members of\r\nthese families. It is a matter of common remark that some constitutional\r\ndiseases, such as gout and insanity, after missing a generation, will show\r\nthemselves in the next. Dr. Struthers, in his above-quoted paper \"On\r\nVariation in the Number of Fingers and Toes, and in the Phalanges in Man,\"\r\ngives cases of malformations common to grandparent and grandchild, but of\r\nwhich the parent had no trace. M. Girou (as quoted by Mr. Sedgwick)\r\nsays--\"One is often surprised to see lambs black, or spotted with black,\r\nborn of ewes and rams with white wool, but if one takes the trouble to go\r\nback to the origin of this phenomena, it is found in the ancestors.\"\r\nInstances still more remarkable, in which the remoteness of the ancestors\r\ncopied is very great, are given by Mr. Darwin. He points out that in\r\ncrosses between varieties of the pigeon, there will sometimes re-appear the\r\nplumage of the original rock-pigeon, from which these varieties descended;\r\nand he thinks the faint zebra-like markings occasionally traceable in\r\nhorses have probably a like meaning.\r\n\r\nThe other modified manifestation of heredity above referred to is the\r\nlimitation of heredity by sex. In Mr. Sedgwick's essays, already named,\r\nwill be found evidence implying that there exists some such tendency to\r\nlimitation, which does or does not show itself distinctly according to the\r\nnature of the organic modification to be conveyed. On joining to the\r\nevidence he gives certain bodies of allied evidence we shall, I think, find\r\nthe inconsistences comprehensible.\r\n\r\nBeyond the familiar facts that in ourselves, along with the essential\r\norgans of sex there go minor structures and traits distinctive of sex, such\r\nas the beard and the voice in man, we have numerous cases in which, along\r\nwith different sex-organs there go general differences, sometimes immense\r\nand often conspicuous. We have those in which (as in sundry parasites) the\r\nmale is extremely small compared with the female; we have those in which\r\nthe male is winged and the female wingless; we have those, as among birds,\r\nin which the plumage of males contrasts strongly with that of females; and\r\namong butterflies we have kindred instances in which the wings of the two\r\nsexes are wholly unlike--some, indeed, in which there is not simply\r\ndimorphism but polymorphism: two kinds of females both differing from the\r\nmale. How shall we range these facts with the ordinary facts of\r\ninheritance? Without difficulty if heredity results from the proclivity\r\nwhich the component units contained in a germ-cell or a sperm-cell have to\r\narrange themselves into a structure like that of the structure from which\r\nthey were derived. For the obvious corollary is that where there is\r\ngamogenesis there will result partly concurring and partly conflicting\r\nproclivities. In the fertilized germ we have two groups of physiological\r\nunits, slightly different in their structures. These slightly-different\r\nunits severally multiply at the expense of the nutriment supplied to the\r\nunfolding germ--each kind moulding this nutriment into units of its own\r\ntype. Throughout the process of development the two kinds of units, mainly\r\nagreeing in their proclivities and in the form which they tend to build\r\nthemselves into, but having minor differences, work in unison to produce an\r\norganism of the species from which they were derived, but work in\r\nantagonism to produce copies of their respective parent-organisms. And\r\nhence ultimately results an organism in which traits of the one are mixed\r\nwith traits of the other; and in which, according to the predominance of\r\none or other group of units, one or other sex with all its concomitants is\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nIf so, it becomes comprehensible that with the predominance of either\r\ngroup, and the production of the same sex as that of the parent whence it\r\nwas derived, there will go the repetition not only of the minor sex-traits\r\nof that parent but also of any peculiarities he or she possessed, such as\r\nmonstrosities. Since the two groups are nearly balanced, and since\r\ninheritance is never an average of the two parents but a mixture of traits\r\nof the one with traits of the other, it is not difficult to see why there\r\nshould be some irregularity in the transmission of these monstrosities and\r\nconstitutional tendencies, though they are most frequently transmitted only\r\nto those of the same sex.[37]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 84. Unawares in the last paragraph there has been taken for granted the\r\ntruth of that suggestion concerning Heredity ventured in § 66. Anything\r\nlike a positive explanation is not to be expected in the present stage of\r\nBiology, if at all. We can look for nothing beyond a simplification of the\r\nproblem; and a reduction of it to the same category with certain other\r\nproblems which also admit of hypothetical solutions only. If an hypothesis\r\nwhich sundry widespread phenomena have already thrust upon us, can be shown\r\nto render the phenomena of Heredity more intelligible than they at present\r\nseem, we shall have reason to entertain it. The applicability of any method\r\nof interpretation to two different but allied classes of facts, is evidence\r\nof its truth.\r\n\r\nThe power which many animals display of reproducing lost parts, we saw to\r\nbe inexplicable except on the assumption that the units of which any\r\norganism is built have a tendency to arrange themselves into the shape of\r\nthat organism (§ 65). This power is sufficiently remarkable in cases where\r\na lost limb or tail is replaced, but it is still more remarkable in cases\r\nwhere, as among some annelids, the pieces into which an individual is cut\r\nseverally complete themselves by developing heads and tails, or in cases\r\nlike that of the _Holothuria_, which having, when alarmed, ejected its\r\nviscera, reproduces them. Such facts compel us to admit that the components\r\nof an organism have a proclivity towards a special structure--that the\r\nadult organism when mutilated exhibits that same proclivity which is\r\nexhibited by the young organism in the course of its normal development. As\r\nbefore said, we may, for want of a better name, figuratively call this\r\npower organic polarity: meaning by this phrase nothing more than the\r\nobserved tendency towards a special arrangement. And such facts as those\r\npresented by the fragments of a _Hydra_, and by fragments of leaves from\r\nwhich complete plants are produced, oblige us to recognize this proclivity\r\nas existing throughout the tissues in general--nay, in the case of the\r\n_Begonia phyllomaniaca_, obliges us to recognize this proclivity as\r\nexisting in the physiological units contained in each undifferentiated\r\ncell. Quite in harmony with this conclusion, are certain implications since\r\nnoticed, respecting the characters of sperm-cells and germ-cells. We saw\r\nsundry reasons for rejecting the supposition that these are\r\nhighly-specialized cells and for accepting the opposite supposition, that\r\nthey are cells differing from others rather in being unspecialized. And\r\nhere the assumption to which we seem driven by the _ensemble_ of the\r\nevidence, is, that sperm-cells and germ-cells are essentially nothing more\r\nthan vehicles in which are contained small groups of the physiological\r\nunits in a fit state for obeying their proclivity towards the structural\r\narrangement of the species they belong to.\r\n\r\nIf the likeness of offspring to parents is thus determined, it becomes\r\nmanifest, _à priori_, that besides the transmission of generic and specific\r\npeculiarities, there will be a transmission of those individual\r\npeculiarities which, arising without assignable causes, are classed as\r\n\"spontaneous.\" For if the assumption of a special arrangement of parts by\r\nan organism, is due to the proclivity of its physiological units towards\r\nthat arrangement; then the assumption of an arrangement of parts slightly\r\ndifferent from that of the species, implies physiological units slightly\r\nunlike those of the species; and these slightly-unlike physiological units,\r\ncommunicated through the medium of sperm-cell or germ-cell, will tend, in\r\nthe offspring, to build themselves into a structure similarly diverging\r\nfrom the average of the species.\r\n\r\nBut it is not equally manifest that, on this hypothesis, alterations of\r\nstructure caused by alterations of function must be transmitted to\r\noffspring. It is not obvious that change in the form of a part, caused by\r\nchanged action, involves such change in the physiological units throughout\r\nthe organism that these, when groups of them are thrown off in the shape of\r\nreproductive centres, will unfold into organisms that have this part\r\nsimilarly changed in form. Indeed, when treating of Adaptation (§ 69), we\r\nsaw that an organ modified by increase or decrease of function, can but\r\nslowly re-act on the system at large, so as to bring about those\r\ncorrelative changes required to produce a new equilibrium; and yet only\r\nwhen such new equilibrium has been established, can we expect it to be\r\n_fully_ expressed in the modified physiological units of which the organism\r\nis built--only then can we count on a complete transfer of the modification\r\nto descendants. Nevertheless, that changes of structure caused by changes\r\nof action must also be transmitted, however obscurely, appears to be a\r\ndeduction from first principles--or if not a specific deduction, still, a\r\ngeneral implication. For if an organism A, has, by any peculiar habit or\r\ncondition of life, been modified into the form A', it follows that all the\r\nfunctions of A', reproductive function included, must be in some degree\r\ndifferent from the functions of A. An organism being a combination of\r\nrhythmically-acting parts in moving equilibrium, the action and structure\r\nof any one part cannot be altered without causing alterations of action and\r\nstructure in all the rest; just as no member of the Solar System could be\r\nmodified in motion or mass, without producing rearrangements throughout the\r\nwhole Solar System. And if the organism A, when changed to A', must be\r\nchanged in all its functions; then the offspring of A' cannot be the same\r\nas they would have been had it retained the form A. That the change in the\r\noffspring must, other things equal, be in the same direction as the change\r\nin the parent, appears implied by the fact that the change propagated\r\nthroughout the parental system is a change towards a new state of\r\nequilibrium--a change tending to bring the actions of all organs,\r\nreproductive included, into harmony with these new actions. Or, bringing\r\nthe question to its ultimate and simplest form, we may say that as, on the\r\none hand, physiological units will, because of their special polarities,\r\nbuild themselves into an organism of a special structure; so, on the other\r\nhand, if the structure of this organism is modified by modified function,\r\nit will impress some corresponding modification on the structures and\r\npolarities of its units. The units and the aggregate must act and re-act on\r\neach other. If nothing prevents, the units will mould the aggregate into a\r\nform in equilibrium with their pre-existing polarities. If, contrariwise,\r\nthe aggregate is made by incident actions to take a new form, its forces\r\nmust tend to re-mould the units into harmony with this new form. And to say\r\nthat the physiological units are in any degree so re-moulded as to bring\r\ntheir polar forces towards equilibrium with the forces of the modified\r\naggregate, is to say that when separated in the shape of reproductive\r\ncentres, these units will tend to build themselves up into an aggregate\r\nmodified in the same direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--A large amount of additional evidence supporting the belief that\r\nfunctionally produced modifications are inherited, will be found in\r\nAppendix B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nVARIATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 85. Equally conspicuous with the truth that every organism bears a\r\ngeneral likeness to its parents, is the truth that no organism is exactly\r\nlike either parent. Though similar to both in generic and specific traits,\r\nand usually, too, in those traits which distinguish the variety, it\r\ndiverges in numerous traits of minor importance. No two plants are\r\nindistinguishable; and no two animals are without differences. Variation is\r\nco-extensive with Heredity.\r\n\r\nThe degrees of variation have a wide range. There are deviations so small\r\nas to be not easily detected; and there are deviations great enough to be\r\ncalled monstrosities. In plants we may pass from cases of slight alteration\r\nin the shape of a leaf, to cases where, instead of a flower with its calyx\r\nabove the seed-vessel, there is produced a flower with its calyx below the\r\nseed-vessel; and while in one animal there arises a scarcely noticeable\r\nunlikeness in the length or colour of the hair, in another an organ is\r\nabsent or a supernumerary organ appears. Though small variations are by far\r\nthe most general, yet variations of considerable magnitude are not\r\nuncommon; and even those variations constituted by additions or\r\nsuppressions of parts, are not so rare as to be excluded from the list of\r\ncauses by which organic forms are changed. Cattle without horns are\r\nfrequent. Of sheep there are horned breeds and breeds that have lost their\r\nhorns. At one time there existed in Scotland a race of pigs with solid feet\r\ninstead of cleft feet. In pigeons, according to Mr. Darwin, \"the number of\r\nthe caudal and sacral vertebræ vary; as does the number of the ribs,\r\ntogether with their relative breadth and the presence of processes.\"\r\n\r\nThat variations, both small and large, which arise without any specific\r\nassignable cause, tend to become hereditary, was shown in the last chapter.\r\nIndeed the evidence which proves Heredity in its smaller manifestations is\r\nthe same evidence which proves Variation; since it is only when there occur\r\nvariations that the inheritance of anything beyond the structural\r\npeculiarities of the species can be proved. It remains here, however, to be\r\nobserved that the transmission of variations is itself variable; and that\r\nit varies both in the direction of decrease and in the direction of\r\nincrease. An individual trait of one parent may be so counteracted by the\r\ninfluence of the other parent, that it may not appear in the offspring; or,\r\nnot being so counteracted, the offspring may possess it, perhaps in an\r\nequal degree or perhaps in a less degree; or the offspring may exhibit the\r\ntrait in even a still higher degree. Among illustrations of this, one must\r\nsuffice. I quote it from the essay by Sir J. Struthers referred to in the\r\nlast chapter.\r\n\r\n\"The great-great-grandmother, Esther P---- (who married A---- L----), had a\r\nsixth little finger on one hand. Of their eighteen children (twelve\r\ndaughters and six sons), only one (Charles) is known to have had digital\r\nvariety. We have the history of the descendants of three of the sons,\r\nAndrew, Charles, and James.\r\n\r\n\"(1.) Andrew L---- had two sons, Thomas and Andrew; and Thomas had two sons\r\nall without digital variety. Here we have three successive generations\r\nwithout the variety possessed by the great-grandmother showing itself.\r\n\r\n\"(2.) James L----, who was normal, had two sons and seven daughters, also\r\nnormal. One of the daughters became Mrs. J---- (one of the informants), and\r\nhad three daughters and five sons, all normal except one of the sons, James\r\nJ----, now æt. 17, who had six fingers on each hand....\r\n\r\n\"In this branch of the descendants of Esther, we see it passing over two\r\ngenerations and reappearing in one member of the third generation, and now\r\non both hands.\r\n\r\n\"(3.) Charles L----, the only child of Esther who had digital variety, had\r\nsix fingers on each hand. He had three sons, James, Thomas, and John, all\r\nof whom were born with six fingers on each hand, while John has also a\r\nsixth toe on one foot. He had also five other sons and four daughters, all\r\nof whom were normal.\r\n\r\n\"(a.) Of the normal children of this, the third generation, the five sons\r\nhad twelve sons and twelve daughters, and the four daughters have had four\r\nsons and four daughters, being the fourth generation, all of whom were\r\nnormal. A fifth generation in this sub-group consists as yet of only two\r\nboys and two girls who are also normal.\r\n\r\n\"In this sub-branch, we see the variety of the first generation present in\r\nthe second, passing over the third and fourth, and also the fifth as far as\r\nit has yet gone.\r\n\r\n\"(b.) James had three sons and two daughters, who are normal.\r\n\r\n\"(c.) Thomas had four sons and five daughters, who are normal; and has two\r\ngrandsons, also normal.\r\n\r\n\"In this sub-branch of the descent, we see the variety of the first\r\ngeneration, showing itself in the second and third, and passing over the\r\nfourth, and (as far as it yet exists) the fifth generation.\r\n\r\n\"(d.) John L---- (one of the informants) had six fingers, the additional\r\nfinger being attached on the outer side, as in the case of his brothers\r\nJames and Thomas. All of them had the additional digits removed. John has\r\nalso a sixth toe on one foot, situated on the outer side. The fifth and\r\nsixth toes have a common proximal phalange, and a common integument invests\r\nthe middle and distal phalanges, each having a separate nail.\r\n\r\n\"John L----  has a son who is normal, and a daughter, Jane, who was born\r\nwith six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. The sixth fingers\r\nwere removed. The sixth toes are not wrapped with the fifth as in her\r\nfather's case, but are distinct from them. The son has a son and daughter,\r\nwho, like himself, are normal.\r\n\r\n\"In this, the most interesting sub-branch of the descent, we see digital\r\nincrease, which appeared in the first generation on one limb, appearing in\r\nthe second on two limbs, the hands; in the third on three limbs, the hands\r\nand one foot; in the fourth on all the four limbs. There is as yet no fifth\r\ngeneration in uninterrupted transmission of the variety. The variety does\r\nnot yet occur in any member of the fifth generation of Esther's\r\ndescendants, which consists, as yet, only of three boys and one girl, whose\r\nparents were normal, and of two boys and two girls, whose grandparents were\r\nnormal. It is not known whether in the case of the great-great-grandmother,\r\nEsther P----, the variety was original or inherited.\"[38]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 86. Where there is great uniformity among the members of a species, the\r\ndivergences of offspring from the average type are usually small; but\r\nwhere, among the members of a species, considerable unlikenesses have once\r\nbeen established, unlikenesses among the offspring are frequent and great.\r\nWild plants growing in their natural habitats are uniform over large areas,\r\nand maintain from generation to generation like structures; but when\r\ncultivation has caused appreciable differences among the members of any\r\nspecies of plant, extensive and numerous deviations are apt to arise.\r\nSimilarly, between wild and domesticated animals of the same species, we\r\nsee the contrast that though the homogeneous wild race maintains its type\r\nwith great persistence, the comparatively heterogeneous domestic race\r\nfrequently produces individuals more unlike the average type than the\r\nparents are.\r\n\r\nThough unlikeness among progenitors is one antecedent of variation, it is\r\nby no means the sole antecedent. Were it so, the young ones successively\r\nborn to the same parents would be alike. If any peculiarity in a new\r\norganism were a direct resultant of the structural differences between the\r\ntwo organisms which produced it; then all subsequent new organisms produced\r\nby these two would show the same peculiarity. But we know that the\r\nsuccessive offspring have different peculiarities: no two of them are ever\r\nexactly alike.\r\n\r\nOne cause of such structural variation in progeny, is functional variation\r\nin parents. Proof of this is given by the fact that, among progeny of the\r\nsame parents, there is more difference between those begotten under\r\ndifferent constitutional states than between those begotten under the same\r\nconstitutional state. It is notorious that twins are more nearly alike than\r\nchildren borne in succession. The functional conditions of the parents\r\nbeing the same for twins, but not the same for their brothers and sisters\r\n(all other antecedents being constant), we have no choice but to admit that\r\nvariations in the functional conditions of the parents, are the antecedents\r\nof those greater unlikenesses which their brothers and sisters exhibit.\r\n\r\nSome other antecedent remains, however. The parents being the same, and\r\ntheir constitutional states the same, variation, more or less marked, still\r\nmanifests itself. Plants grown from seeds out of one pod, or animals\r\nproduced at one birth, are not alike. Sometimes they differ considerably.\r\nIn a litter of pigs or of kittens, we rarely see uniformity of markings;\r\nand occasionally there are important structural contrasts. I have myself\r\nrecently been shown a litter of Newfoundland puppies, some of which had\r\nfour digits to their feet, while in others there was present, on each\r\nhind-foot, what is called the \"dew-claw\"--a rudimentary fifth digit.\r\n\r\nThus, induction points to three causes of variation, all in action\r\ntogether. We have heterogeneity among progenitors, which, did it act\r\nuniformly and alone in generating, by composition of forces, new\r\ndeviations, would impress such new deviations to the same extent on all\r\noffspring of the same parents; which it does not. We have functional\r\nvariation in the parents, which, acting either alone or in combination with\r\nthe preceding cause, would entail the same structural variations on all\r\nyoung ones simultaneously produced; which it does not. Consequently there\r\nis some third cause of variation, yet to be found, which acts along with\r\nthe structural and functional variations of ancestors and parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 87. Already, in the last section, there has been implied some relation\r\nbetween variation and the action of external conditions. The above-cited\r\ncontrast between the uniformity of a wild species and the multiformity of\r\nthe same species when cultivated or domesticated, thrusts this truth upon\r\nus. Respecting the variations of plants, Mr. Darwin remarks that \"'sports'\r\nare extremely rare under nature, but far from rare under cultivation.\"\r\nOthers who have studied the matter assert that if a species of plant which,\r\nup to a certain time, has maintained great uniformity, once has its\r\nconstitution thoroughly disturbed, it will go on varying indefinitely.\r\nThough, in consequence of the remoteness of the periods at which they were\r\ndomesticated, there is a lack of positive proof that our extremely variable\r\ndomestic animals have become variable under the changed conditions implied\r\nby domestication, having been previously constant; yet competent judges do\r\nnot doubt that this has been the case.\r\n\r\nNow the constitutional disturbance which precedes variation, can be nothing\r\nelse than an overthrowing of the pre-established equilibrium of functions.\r\nTransferring a plant from forest lands to a ploughed field or a manured\r\ngarden, is altering the balance of forces to which it has been hitherto\r\nsubject, by supplying it with different proportions of the assimilable\r\nmatters it requires, and taking away some of the positive impediments to\r\nits growth which competing wild plants before offered. An animal taken from\r\nwoods or plains, where it lived on wild food of its own procuring, and\r\nplaced under restraint while artificially supplied with food not quite like\r\nwhat it had before, is an animal subject to new outer actions to which its\r\ninner actions must be adjusted. From the general law of equilibration we\r\nfound it to follow that \"the maintenance of such a moving equilibrium\" as\r\nan organism displays, \"requires the habitual genesis of internal forces\r\ncorresponding in number, directions, and amounts, to the external incident\r\nforces--as many inner functions, single or combined, as there are single or\r\ncombined outer actions to be met\" (_First Principles_, § 173); and more\r\nrecently (§ 27), we have seen that Life itself is \"the definite combination\r\nof heterogeneous changes, both simultaneous and successive, in\r\ncorrespondence with external co-existences and sequences.\" Necessarily,\r\ntherefore, an organism exposed to a permanent change in the arrangement of\r\nouter forces must undergo a permanent change in the arrangement of inner\r\nforces. The old equilibrium has been destroyed; and a new equilibrium must\r\nbe established. There must be functional perturbations, ending in a\r\nre-adjusted balance of functions.\r\n\r\nIf, then, change of conditions is the only known cause by which the\r\noriginal homogeneity of a species is destroyed; and if change of conditions\r\ncan affect an organism only by altering its functions; it follows that\r\nalteration of functions is the only known internal cause to which the\r\ncommencement of variation can be ascribed. That such minor functional\r\nchanges as parents undergo from year to year are influential on the\r\noffspring, we have seen is proved by the greater unlikeness that exists\r\nbetween children born to the same parents at different times, than exists\r\nbetween twins. And here we seem forced to conclude that the larger\r\nfunctional variations produced by greater external changes, are the\r\ninitiators of those structural variations which, when once commenced in a\r\nspecies, lead by their combinations and antagonisms to multiform results.\r\nWhether they are or are not the direct initiators, they must still be the\r\nindirect initiators.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 87a. In the foregoing sentence those pronounced structural variations\r\nfrom which may presently arise new varieties and eventually species, are\r\nascribed to \"the larger functional variations produced by greater external\r\nchanges\"; and this limitation is a needful one, since there is a constant\r\ncause of minor variations of a wholly different kind.\r\n\r\nThere are the variations arising from differences in the conditions to\r\nwhich the germ is subject, both before detachment from the parent and\r\nafter. At first sight it seems that plants grown from seeds out of the same\r\nseed-vessel and animals belonging to the same litter, ought, in the absence\r\nof any differences of ancestral antecedents, to be entirely alike. But this\r\nis not so. Inevitably they are subject from the very outset to slightly\r\ndifferent sets of agencies. The seeds in a seed-vessel do not stand in\r\nexactly the same relations to the sources of nutriment: some are nearer\r\nthan others. They are somewhat differently exposed to the heat and light\r\npenetrating their envelope; and some are more impeded in their growth by\r\nneighbours than others are. Similarly with young animals belonging to the\r\nsame litter. Their uterine lives are made to some extent unlike by unlike\r\nconnexions with the blood-supply, by mutual interferences not all the same,\r\nand even by different relations to the disturbances caused by the mother's\r\nmovements. So, too, is it after separation from the parent plant or animal.\r\nEven the biblical parable reminds us that seeds fall into places here\r\nfavourable and there unfavourable in various degrees. In respect of soil,\r\nin respect of space for growth, in respect of shares of light, none of them\r\nare circumstanced in quite the same ways. With animals the like holds. In a\r\nlitter of pigs some, weaker than others, do not succeed as often in getting\r\npossession of teats.  And then in both cases the differences thus initiated\r\nbecome increasingly pronounced. Among young plants the smaller, outgrown by\r\ntheir better-placed neighbours, are continually more shaded and more left\r\nbehind; and among the litter the weakly ones, continually thrust aside by\r\nthe stronger, become relatively more weakly from deficient nutrition.\r\n\r\nDifferentiations thus arising, both before and after separation from\r\nparents, though primarily differences of growth, entail structural\r\ndifferences; for it is a general law of nutrition that when there is\r\ndeficiency of food the non-essential organs suffer more than the essential\r\nones, and the unlikenesses of proportion hence arising constitute\r\nunlikenesses of structure. It may be concluded, however, that variations\r\ngenerated in this manner usually have no permanent results. In the first\r\nplace, the individuals which, primarily in growth and secondarily in\r\nsmaller developments of less-important organs, are by implication inferior,\r\nare likely to be eliminated from the species. In the second place,\r\ndifferences of structure produced in the way shown do not express\r\ndifferences of constitution--are not the effects of somewhat divergent\r\nphysiological units; and consequently are not likely to be repeated in\r\nposterity.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 88. We have still, therefore, to explain those variations which have no\r\nmanifest causes of the kinds thus far considered. These are the variations\r\ntermed \"spontaneous.\" Not that those who apply to them this word, or some\r\nequivalent, mean to imply that they are uncaused. Mr. Darwin expressly\r\nguards himself against such an interpretation. He says:--\"I have hitherto\r\nsometimes spoken as if the variations--so common and multiform in organic\r\nbeings under domestication, and in a lesser degree in those in a state of\r\nnature--had been due to chance. This, of course, is a wholly incorrect\r\nexpression, but it serves to acknowledge plainly our ignorance of the cause\r\nof each particular variation.\" Not only, however, do I hold, in common with\r\nMr. Darwin, that there must be some cause for these apparently-spontaneous\r\nvariations, but it seems to me that a definite cause is assignable. I think\r\nit may be shown that unlikenesses must necessarily arise even between the\r\nnew individuals simultaneously produced by the same parents. Instead of the\r\noccurrence of such variations being inexplicable, the absence of them would\r\nbe inexplicable.\r\n\r\nIn any series of dependent changes a small initial difference often works a\r\nmarked difference in the results. The mode in which a particular breaker\r\nbursts on the beach, may determine whether the seed of some foreign plant\r\nwhich it bears is or is not stranded--may cause the presence or absence of\r\nthis plant from the Flora of the land; and may so affect, for millions of\r\nyears, in countless ways, the living creatures throughout the land. A\r\nsingle touch, by introducing into the body some morbid matter, may set up\r\nan immensely involved set of functional disturbances and structural\r\nalterations. The whole tenor of a life may be changed by a word of advice;\r\nor a glance may determine an action which alters thoughts, feelings, and\r\ndeeds throughout a long series of years. In those still more involved\r\ncombinations of changes which societies exhibit, this truth is still more\r\nconspicuous. A hair's-breadth difference in the direction of some soldier's\r\nmusket at the battle of Arcola, by killing Napoleon, might have changed\r\nevents throughout Europe; and though the type of social organization in\r\neach European country would have been now very much what it is, yet in\r\ncountless details it would have been different.\r\n\r\nIllustrations like these, with which pages might be filled, prepare us for\r\nthe conclusion that organisms produced by the same parents at the same\r\ntime, must be more or less differentiated, both by insensible initial\r\ndifferences and by slight differences in the conditions to which they are\r\nsubject during their evolution. We need not, however, rest with assuming\r\nsuch initial differences: the necessity of them is demonstrable. The\r\nindividual germ-cells which, in succession or simultaneously, are separated\r\nfrom the same parent, can never be exactly alike; nor can the sperm-cells\r\nwhich fertilize them. When treating of the instability of the homogeneous\r\n(_First Principles_, § 149), we saw that no two parts of any aggregate can\r\nbe similarly conditioned with respect to incident forces; and that being\r\nsubject to forces that are more or less unlike, they must become more or\r\nless unlike. Hence, no two ova in an ovarium or ovules in a seed-vessel--no\r\ntwo spermatozoa or pollen-cells, can be identical. Whether or not there\r\narise other contrasts, there are certain to arise quantitative contrasts;\r\nsince the process of nutrition cannot be absolutely alike for all. The\r\nreproductive centres must begin to differentiate from the very outset. Such\r\nbeing the necessities of the case, what will happen on any successive or\r\nsimultaneous fertilizations? Inevitably unlikenesses between the respective\r\nparental influences must result. Quantitative differences among the\r\nsperm-cells and among the germ-cells, will insure this. Grant that the\r\nnumber of physiological units contained in any one reproductive cell, can\r\nrarely if ever be exactly equal to the number contained in any other,\r\nripened at the same time or at a different time; and it follows that among\r\nthe fertilized germs produced by the same parents, the physiological units\r\nderived from them respectively will bear a different numerical ratio to\r\neach other in every case. If the parents are constitutionally quite alike,\r\nthe variation in the ratio between the units they severally bequeath,\r\ncannot cause unlikenesses among the offspring. But if otherwise, no two of\r\nthe offspring can be alike. In every case the small initial difference in\r\nthe proportions of the slightly-unlike units, will lead, during evolution,\r\nto a continual multiplication of differences. The insensible divergence at\r\nthe outset will generate sensible divergences at the conclusion. Possibly\r\nsome may hence infer that though, in such case, the offspring must differ\r\nsomewhat from each other and from both parents, yet that in every one of\r\nthem there must result a homogeneous mixture of the traits of the two\r\nparents. A little consideration shows that the reverse is inferable. If,\r\nthroughout the process of development, the physiological units derived from\r\neach parent preserved the same ratio in all parts of the growing organism,\r\neach organ would show as much as every other, the influence of either\r\nparent. But no such uniform distribution is possible. It has been shown\r\n(_First Principles_, § 163), that in any aggregate of mixed units\r\nsegregation must inevitably go on. Incident forces will tend ever to cause\r\nseparation of the two orders of units from each other--will tend to\r\nintegrate groups of the one order in one place and groups of the other\r\norder in another place. Hence there must arise not a homogeneous mean\r\nbetween the two parents, but a mixture of organs, some of which mainly\r\nfollow the one and some the other. And this is the kind of mixture which\r\nobservation shows us.\r\n\r\nStill it may be fairly objected that however the attributes of the two\r\nparents are variously mingled in their offspring, they must in all of them\r\nfall between the extremes displayed in the parents. In no characteristic\r\ncould one of the young exceed both parents, were there no cause of\r\n\"spontaneous variation\" but the one alleged. Evidently, then, there is a\r\ncause yet unfound.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 89. Thus far we have contemplated the process under its simplest aspect.\r\nWhile we have assumed the two parents to be somewhat unlike, we have\r\nassumed that each parent has a homogeneous constitution--is built up of\r\nphysiological units which are exactly alike. But in no case can such a\r\nhomogeneity exist. Each parent had parents who were more or less\r\ncontrasted--each parent inherited at least two orders of physiological\r\nunits not quite identical. Here then we have a further cause of variation.\r\nThe sperm-cells or germ-cells which any organism produces, will differ from\r\neach other not quantitatively only but qualitatively. Of the\r\nslightly-unlike physiological units bequeathed to it, the reproductive\r\ncells it casts off cannot habitually contain the same proportions; and we\r\nmay expect the proportions to vary not slightly but greatly. Just as,\r\nduring the evolution of an organism, the physiological units derived from\r\nthe two parents tend to segregate, and produce likeness to the male parent\r\nin this part and to the female parent in that; so, during the formation of\r\nreproductive cells, there will arise in one a predominance of the\r\nphysiological units derived from the father, and in another a predominance\r\nof the physiological units derived from the mother. Thus, then, every\r\nfertilized germ, besides containing different _amounts_ of the two parental\r\ninfluences, will contain different _kinds_ of influences--this having\r\nreceived a marked impress from one grandparent, and that from another.\r\nWithout further exposition the reader will see how this cause of\r\ncomplication, running back through each line of ancestry, must produce in\r\nevery germ numerous minute differences among the units.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have a clue to the multiplied variations, and sometimes\r\nextreme variations, that arise in races which have once begun to vary. Amid\r\ncountless different combinations of units derived from parents, and through\r\nthem from ancestors, immediate and remote--amid the various conflicts in\r\ntheir slightly-different organic polarities, opposing and conspiring with\r\none another in all ways and degrees; there will from time to time arise\r\nspecial proportions causing special deviations. From the general law of\r\nprobabilities it may be concluded that while these involved influences,\r\nderived from many progenitors, must, on the average of cases, obscure and\r\npartially neutralize one another; there must occasionally result such\r\ncombinations of them as will produce considerable divergences from average\r\nstructures; and, at rare intervals, such combinations as will produce very\r\nmarked divergences. There is thus a correspondence between the inferable\r\nresults and the results as habitually witnessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 90. Still there remains a difficulty. It may be said that admitting\r\nfunctional change to be the initiator of variation--granting that the\r\nphysiological units of an organism long subject to new conditions, will\r\ntend to become modified in such way as to cause change of structure in\r\noffspring; yet there will still be no cause of the supposed heterogeneity\r\namong the physiological units of different individuals. There seems\r\nvalidity in the objection, that as all the members of a species whose\r\ncircumstances have been altered will be affected in the same manner, the\r\nresults, when they begin to show themselves in descendants, will show\r\nthemselves in the same manner: not multiform variations will arise, but\r\ndeviations all in one direction.\r\n\r\nThe reply is simple. The members of a species thus circumstanced will _not_\r\nbe similarly affected. In the absence of absolute uniformity among them,\r\nthe functional changes caused in them will be more or less dissimilar. Just\r\nas men of slightly-unlike dispositions behave in quite opposite ways under\r\nthe same circumstances; or just as men of slightly-unlike constitutions get\r\ndiverse disorders from the same cause, and are diversely acted on by the\r\nsame medicine; so, the insensibly-differentiated members of a species whose\r\nconditions have been changed, may at once begin to undergo various kinds of\r\nfunctional changes. As we have already seen, small initial contrasts may\r\nlead to large terminal contrasts. The intenser cold of the climate into\r\nwhich a species has migrated, may cause in one individual increased\r\nconsumption of food to balance the greater loss of heat; while in another\r\nindividual the requirement may be met by a thicker growth of fur. Or, when\r\nmeeting with the new foods which a new region furnishes, accident may\r\ndetermine one member of the species to begin with one kind and another\r\nmember with another kind; and hence may arise established habits in these\r\nrespective members and their descendants. Now when the functional\r\ndivergences thus set up in sundry families of a species have lasted long\r\nenough to affect their constitutions, and to modify somewhat the\r\nphysiological units thrown off in their reproductive cells, the divergences\r\nproduced by these in offspring will be of divers kinds. And the original\r\nhomogeneity of constitution having been thus destroyed, variation may go on\r\nwith increasing facility. There will result a heterogeneous mixture of\r\nmodifications of structure caused by modifications of function; and of\r\nstill more numerous correlated modifications, indirectly so caused. By\r\nnatural selection of the most divergent forms, the unlikenesses of parents\r\nwill be rendered more marked, and the limits of variation wider. Until at\r\nlength the divergences of constitutions and modes of life, become great\r\nenough to lead to segregation of the varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 91. That variations must occur, and that they must ever tend, both\r\ndirectly and indirectly, towards adaptive modifications, are conclusions\r\ndeducible from first principles; apart from any detailed interpretations\r\nlike the above. That the state of homogeneity is an unstable state we have\r\nfound to be a universal truth. Each species must pass from the uniform into\r\nthe more or less multiform, unless the incidence of external forces is\r\nexactly the same for all its members, which it never can be. Through the\r\nprocess of differentiation and integration, which of necessity brings\r\ntogether, or keeps together, like individuals, and separates unlike ones\r\nfrom them, there must nevertheless be maintained a tolerably uniform\r\nspecies, so long as there continues a tolerably uniform set of conditions\r\nin which it may exist. But if the conditions change, either absolutely by\r\nsome disturbance of the habitat or relatively by spread of the species into\r\nother habitats, then the divergent individuals that result must be\r\nsegregated by the divergent sets of conditions into distinct varieties\r\n(_First Principles_, § 166). When, instead of contemplating a species in\r\nthe aggregate, we confine our attention to a single member and its\r\ndescendants, we see it to be a corollary from the general law of\r\nequilibration that the moving equilibrium constituted by the vital actions\r\nin each member of this family, must remain constant so long as the external\r\nactions to which they correspond remain constant; and that if the external\r\nactions are changed, the disturbed balance of internal changes, if not\r\noverthrown, cannot cease undergoing modification until the internal changes\r\nare again in equilibrium with the external actions: corresponding\r\nstructural alterations having arisen.\r\n\r\nOn passing from these derivative laws to the ultimate law, we see that\r\nVariation is necessitated by the persistence of force. The members of a\r\nspecies inhabiting any area cannot be subject to like sets of forces over\r\nthe whole of that area. And if, in different parts of the area, different\r\nkinds or amounts or combinations of forces act on them, they cannot but\r\nbecome different in themselves and in their progeny. To say otherwise, is\r\nto say that differences in the forces will not produce differences in the\r\neffects; which is to deny the persistence of force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nGENESIS, HEREDITY, AND VARIATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 92. A question raised, and hypothetically answered, in §§ 78 and 79, was\r\nthere postponed until we had dealt with the topics of Heredity and\r\nVariation. Let us now resume the consideration of this question, in\r\nconnexion with sundry others which the facts suggest.\r\n\r\nAfter contemplating the several methods by which the multiplication of\r\norganisms is carried on--after ranging them under the two heads of\r\nHomogenesis, in which the successive generations are similarly produced,\r\nand Heterogenesis, in which they are dissimilarly produced--after observing\r\nthat Homogenesis is nearly always sexual genesis, while Heterogenesis is\r\nasexual genesis with occasionally-recurring sexual genesis; we came to the\r\nquestions--why is it that some organisms multiply in the one way and some\r\nin the other? and why is it that where agamogenesis prevails it is usually,\r\nfrom time to time, interrupted by gamogenesis? In seeking answers to these\r\nquestions, we inquired whether there are common to both Homogenesis and\r\nHeterogenesis, any conditions under which alone sperm-cells and germ-cells\r\narise and are united for the production of new organisms; and we reached\r\nthe conclusion that, in all cases, they arise only when there is an\r\napproach to equilibrium between the forces which produce growth and the\r\nforces which oppose growth. This answer to the question--_when_ does\r\ngamogenesis recur? still left unanswered the question--_why_ does\r\ngamogenesis recur? And to this the reply suggested was, that the approach\r\ntowards general equilibrium in organisms, \"is accompanied by an approach\r\ntowards molecular equilibrium in them; and that the need for this union of\r\nsperm-cell with germ-cell is the need for overthrowing this equilibrium,\r\nand re-establishing active molecular change in the detached germ--a result\r\nprobably effected by mixing the slightly-different physiological units of\r\nslightly-different individuals.\" This is the hypothesis which we have now\r\nto consider. Let us first look at the evidences which certain inorganic\r\nphenomena furnish.\r\n\r\nThe molecules of any aggregate which have not a balanced arrangement,\r\ninevitably tend towards a balanced arrangement. As before mentioned (_First\r\nPrinciples_, § 100), amorphous wrought iron, when subject to continuous\r\njar, begins to arrange itself into crystals--its atoms assume a condition\r\nof polar equilibrium. The particles of unannealed glass, which are so\r\nunstably arranged that slight disturbing forces make them separate into\r\nsmall groups, take advantage of that greater freedom of movement given by a\r\nraised temperature, to adjust themselves into a state of relative rest.\r\nDuring any such re-arrangement the aggregate exercises a coercive force\r\nover its units. Just as in a growing crystal the atoms successively\r\nassimilated from the solution, are made by the already crystallized atoms\r\nto take a certain form, and even to re-complete that form when it is\r\nbroken; so in any mass of unstably-arranged atoms which passes into a\r\nstable arrangement, each atom conforms to the forces exercised on it by all\r\nthe other atoms. This is a corollary from the general law of equilibration.\r\nWe saw (_First Principles_, § 170) that every change is towards\r\nequilibrium; and that change can never cease until equilibrium is reached.\r\nOrganisms, above all other aggregates, conspicuously display this\r\nprogressive equilibration; because their units are of such kinds, and so\r\nconditioned, as to admit of easy re-arrangement.  Those extremely active\r\nchanges which go on during the early stages of evolution, imply an immense\r\nexcess of the molecular forces over those antagonist forces which the\r\naggregate exercises on the molecules. While this excess continues, it is\r\nexpended in growth, development, and function: expenditure for any of these\r\npurposes being proof that part of the force constituting molecular tensions\r\nremains unbalanced. Eventually, however, this excess diminishes. Either, as\r\nin organisms which do not expend much energy, decrease of assimilation\r\nleads to its decline; or, as in organisms which expend much energy, it is\r\ncounterbalanced by the rapidly-increasing reactions of the aggregate\r\n(§ 46). The cessation of growth when followed, as in some organisms, by\r\ndeath, implies the arrival at an equilibrium between the molecular forces\r\nand those forces which the aggregate opposes to them. When, as in other\r\norganisms, growth ends in the establishment of a moving equilibrium, there\r\nis implied such a decreased preponderance of the molecular forces, as\r\nleaves no surplus beyond that which is used up in functions. The declining\r\nfunctional activity characteristic of advancing life, expresses a further\r\ndecline in this surplus. And when all vital movements come to an end, the\r\nimplication is that the actions of the units on the aggregate and the\r\nreactions of the aggregate on the units are completely balanced.  Hence,\r\nwhile a state of rapid growth indicates such a play of forces among the\r\nunits of an aggregate as will produce active re-distribution, the\r\ndiminution and arrest of growth shows that the units have fallen into such\r\nrelative positions that re-distribution is no longer so facile. When,\r\ntherefore, we see that gamogenesis recurs only when growth is decreasing,\r\nor has come to an end, we must say that it recurs only when the organic\r\nunits are approximating to equilibrium--only when their mutual restraints\r\nprevent them from readily changing their arrangements in obedience to\r\nincident forces.\r\n\r\nThat units of like forms can be built up into a more stable aggregate than\r\nunits of slightly unlike forms, is tolerably manifest _à priori_. And we\r\nhave facts which prove that mixing allied but somewhat different units,\r\n_does_ lead to comparative instability. Most metallic alloys exemplify this\r\ntruth. Common solder, which is a mixture of lead and tin, melts at a much\r\nlower temperature than either lead or tin. The compound of lead, tin, and\r\nbismuth, called \"fusible metal,\" becomes fluid at the temperature of\r\nboiling water; while the temperatures at which lead, tin, and bismuth\r\nbecome fluid are, respectively, 612°, 442°, and 497° F. Still more\r\nremarkable is the illustration furnished by potassium and sodium. These\r\nmetals are very near akin in all respects--in their specific gravities,\r\ntheir atomic weights, their chemical affinities, and the properties of\r\ntheir compounds. That is to say, all the evidences unite to show that their\r\nunits, though not identical, have a close resemblance. What now happens\r\nwhen they are mixed? Potassium alone melts at 136°, sodium alone melts at\r\n190°, but the alloy of potassium and sodium is liquid at the ordinary\r\ntemperature of the air. Observe the meaning of these facts, expressed in\r\ngeneral terms. The maintenance of a solid form by any group of units\r\nimplies among them an arrangement so stable that it is not overthrown by\r\nthe incident forces. Whereas the assumption of a liquid form implies that\r\nthe incident forces suffice to destroy the arrangement of the units. In the\r\none case the thermal undulations fail to dislocate the parts; while in the\r\nother case the parts are so dislocated by the thermal undulations that they\r\nfall into total disorder--a disorder admitting of easy re-arrangement into\r\nany other order. For the liquid state is a state in which the units become\r\nso far free from mutual restraints, that incident forces can change their\r\nrelative positions very readily. Thus we have reason to conclude that an\r\naggregate of units which, though in the main similar to one another, have\r\nminor differences, must be more unstable than an aggregate of homogeneous\r\nunits. The one will yield to disturbing forces which the other successfully\r\nresists.\r\n\r\nNow though the colloidal molecules of which organisms are mainly built, are\r\nthemselves highly composite; and though the physiological units compounded\r\nout of these colloidal molecules must have structures far more involved;\r\nyet it must happen with such units, as with simple units, that those which\r\nhave exactly like forms will admit of arrangement into a more stable\r\naggregate than those which have slightly-unlike forms. Among units of this\r\norder, as among units of a simpler order, imperfect similarity must entail\r\nimperfect balance in anything formed of them, and consequent diminished\r\nability to withstand disturbing forces. Hence, given two organisms which,\r\nby diminished nutrition or increased expenditure, are being arrested in\r\ntheir growths--given in each an approaching equilibrium between the forces\r\nof the units and the forces of the aggregate--given, that is, such a\r\ncomparatively balanced state among the units that re-arrangement of them by\r\nincident forces is no longer so easy; and it will follow that by uniting a\r\ngroup of units from the one organism with a group of slightly-different\r\nunits from the other, the tendency towards equilibrium will be diminished,\r\nand the mixed units will be rendered more modifiable in their arrangements\r\nby the forces acting on them: they will be so far freed as to become again\r\ncapable of that re-distribution which constitutes evolution.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us test this hypothesis by seeing what power it gives us of\r\ninterpreting established inductions.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 93. The majority of plants being hermaphrodites, it has, until quite\r\nrecently, been supposed that the ovules of each flower are fertilized by\r\npollen from the anthers of the same flower. Mr. Darwin, however, has shown\r\nthat the arrangements are generally such as to prevent this. Either the\r\novules and the pollen are not ripe simultaneously, or obstacles prevent\r\naccess of the one to the other. At the same time he has shown that there\r\nexist arrangements, often of a remarkable kind, which facilitate the\r\ntransfer of pollen by insects from the stamens of one flower to the pistil\r\nof another. Similarly, it has been found that among the lower animals,\r\nhermaphrodism does not usually involve the production of fertile ova by the\r\nunion of sperm-cells and germ-cells developed in the same individual; but\r\nthat the reproductive centres of one individual are united with those of\r\nanother to produce fertile ova. Either, as in _Pyrosoma_, _Perophora_, and\r\nin many higher molluscs, the ova and spermatozoa are matured at different\r\ntimes; or, as in annelids, they are prevented by their relative positions\r\nfrom coming in contact.\r\n\r\nRemembering the fact that among the higher classes of organisms,\r\nfertilization is always effected by combining the sperm-cell of one\r\nindividual with the germ-cell of another; and joining with it the above\r\nfact that among hermaphrodite organisms, the germ-cells developed in any\r\nindividual are usually not fertilized by sperm-cells developed in the same\r\nindividual; we see reason for thinking that the essential thing in\r\nfertilization, is the union of specially-fitted portions of _different_\r\norganisms. If fertilization depended on the peculiar properties of\r\nsperm-cell and germ-cell, as such; then, in hermaphrodite organisms, it\r\nwould be a matter of indifference whether the united sperm-cells and\r\ngerm-cells were those of the same individual or those of different\r\nindividuals. But the circumstance that there exist in such organisms\r\nelaborate appliances for mutual fertilization, shows that unlikeness of\r\nderivation in the united reproductive centres, is the desideratum. Now this\r\nis just what the foregoing hypothesis implies. If, as was concluded,\r\nfertilization has for its object the disturbance of that approaching\r\nequilibrium existing among the physiological units separated from an adult\r\norganism; and if, as we saw reason to think, this object is effected by\r\nmixture with the slightly-different physiological units of another\r\norganism; then, we at the same time see that this object will not be\r\neffected by mixture with physiological units belonging to the same\r\norganism. Thus, the hypothesis leads us to expect such provisions as we\r\nfind.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 94. But here a difficulty presents itself. These propositions seem to\r\ninvolve the conclusion that self-fertilization is impossible. It apparently\r\nfollows from them, that a group of physiological units from one part of an\r\norganism ought to have no power of altering the state of approaching\r\nbalance in a group from another part of it. Yet self-fertilization does\r\noccur. Though the ovules of one plant are generally fertilized by pollen\r\nfrom another plant of the same kind, yet they may be, some of them,\r\nfertilized by pollen of the same plant; and, indeed, there are plants in\r\nwhich self-fertilization is the rule: even provision being in some cases\r\nmade to prevent fertilization by pollen from other individuals. And though,\r\namong hermaphrodite animals, self-fertilization is usually negatived by\r\nstructural or functional arrangements, yet in certain _Entozoa_ there\r\nappear to be special provisions by which the sperm-cells and the germ-cells\r\nof the same individual may be united, when not previously united with those\r\nof another individual. Nay, it has even been shown that in certain\r\nAscidians the contents of oviduct and spermiduct of the same individual\r\nproduce, when united, fertile ova whence evolve perfect individuals.\r\nCertainly, at first sight, these facts do not consist with the above\r\nsupposition. Nevertheless there is something like a solution.\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter, when considering the variations caused in offspring\r\nfrom uniting elements representing unlike parental constitutions, it was\r\npointed out that in an unfolding organism, composed of slightly-different\r\nphysiological units derived from slightly-different parents, there cannot\r\nbe maintained an even distribution of the two orders of units. We saw that\r\nthe instability of the homogeneous negatives the uniform blending of them;\r\nand that, by the process of differentiation and integration, they must be\r\nmore or less separated; so that in one part of the body the influence of\r\none parent will predominate, and in another part of the body the influence\r\nof the other parent: an inference which harmonizes with daily observation.\r\nWe also saw that the sperm-cells or germ-cells produced by such an organism\r\nmust, in virtue of these same laws, be more or less unlike one another. It\r\nwas shown that through segregation, some of the sperm-cells or germ-cells\r\nwill get an excess of the physiological units derived from one side, and\r\nsome of them an excess of those derived from the other side: a cause which\r\naccounts for the unlikenesses among offspring simultaneously produced. Now\r\nfrom this segregation of the different orders of physiological units,\r\ninherited from different parents and lines of ancestry, there arises the\r\npossibility of self-fertilization in hermaphrodite organisms. If the\r\nphysiological units contained in the sperm-cells and germ-cells of the same\r\nflower, are not quite homogeneous--if in some of the ovules the\r\nphysiological units derived from the one parent greatly predominate, and in\r\nsome of the ovules those derived from the other parent; and if the like is\r\ntrue of the pollen-cells; then, some of the ovules may be nearly as much\r\ncontrasted with some of the pollen-cells in the characters of their\r\ncontained units, as were the ovules and pollen-cells of the parents from\r\nwhich the plant proceeded. Between part of the sperm-cells and part of the\r\ngerm-cells, the community of nature will be such that fertilization will\r\nnot result from their union; but between some of them, the differences of\r\nconstitution will be such that their union will produce the requisite\r\nmolecular instability. The facts, so far as they are known, seem in harmony\r\nwith this deduction. Self-fertilization in flowers, when it takes place, is\r\nnot so efficient as mutual fertilization. Though some of the ovules produce\r\nseeds, yet more of them than usual are abortive. From which, indeed,\r\nresults the establishment of varieties that have structures favourable to\r\nmutual fertilization; since, being more prolific, these have, other things\r\nequal, greater chances in the \"struggle for existence.\"\r\n\r\nFurther evidence is at hand supporting this interpretation. There is reason\r\nto believe that self-fertilization, which at the best is comparatively\r\ninefficient, loses all efficiency in course of time. After giving an\r\naccount of the provisions for an occasional, or a frequent, or a constant\r\ncrossing between flowers; and after quoting Prof. Huxley to the effect that\r\namong hermaphrodite animals, there is no case in which \"the occasional\r\ninfluence of a distinct individual can be shown to be physically\r\nimpossible;\" Mr. Darwin writes--\"from these several considerations and from\r\nthe many special facts which I have collected, but which I am not here able\r\nto give, I am strongly inclined to suspect that, both in the vegetable and\r\nanimal kingdoms, an occasional intercross with a distinct individual is a\r\nlaw of nature ... in none, as I suspect, can self-fertilization go on for\r\nperpetuity.\" This conclusion, based wholly on observed facts, is just the\r\nconclusion to which the foregoing argument points. That necessary action\r\nand the re-action between the parts of an organism and the organism as a\r\nwhole--that power of an aggregate to re-mould the units, which is the\r\ncorrelative of the power of the units to build up into such an aggregate;\r\nimplies that any differences existing among the units inherited by an\r\norganism, must gradually diminish. Being subject in common to the total\r\nforces of the organism, they will in common be modified towards congruity\r\nwith these forces, and therefore towards likeness with one another. If,\r\nthen, in a self-fertilizing organism and its self-fertilizing descendants,\r\nsuch contrasts as originally existed among the physiological units are\r\nprogressively obliterated--if, consequently, there can no longer be a\r\nsegregation of different physiological units in different sperm-cells and\r\ngerm-cells; self-fertilization will become impossible. Step by step the\r\nfertility will diminish, and the series will finally die out.\r\n\r\nAnd now observe, in confirmation of this view, that self-fertilization is\r\nlimited to organisms in which an approximate equilibrium among the organic\r\nforces is not long maintained. While growth is actively going on, and the\r\nphysiological units are subject to a continually-changing distribution of\r\nforces, no decided assimilation of the units can be expected: like forces\r\nacting on the unlike units will tend to segregate them, so long as\r\ncontinuance of evolution permits further segregation; and only when further\r\nsegregation cannot go on, will the like forces tend to assimilate the\r\nunits. Hence, where there is no prolonged maintenance of an approximate\r\norganic balance, self-fertilization may be possible for some generations;\r\nbut it will be impossible in organisms distinguished by a sustained moving\r\nequilibrium.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 95. The interpretation which it affords of sundry phenomena familiar to\r\nbreeders of animals, adds probability to the hypothesis. Mr. Darwin has\r\ncollected a large \"body of facts, showing, in accordance with the almost\r\nuniversal belief of breeders, that with animals and plants a cross between\r\ndifferent varieties, or between individuals of the same variety but of\r\nanother strain, gives vigour and fertility to the offspring; and on the\r\nother hand, that _close_ interbreeding diminishes vigour and fertility,\"--a\r\nconclusion harmonizing with the current belief respecting\r\nfamily-intermarriages in the human race. Have we not here a solution of\r\nthese facts? Relations must, on the average of cases, be individuals whose\r\nphysiological units are more nearly alike than usual. Animals of different\r\nvarieties must be those whose physiological units are more unlike than\r\nusual. In the one case, the unlikeness of the units may frequently be\r\ninsufficient to produce fertilization; or, if sufficient to produce\r\nfertilization, not sufficient to produce that active molecular change\r\nrequired for vigorous development. In the other case, both fertilization\r\nand vigorous development will be made probable.\r\n\r\nNor are we without a cause for the irregular manifestations of these\r\ngeneral tendencies. The mixed physiological units composing any organism\r\nbeing, as we have seen, more or less segregated in the reproductive centres\r\nit throws off; there may arise various results according to the degrees of\r\ndifference among the units, and the degrees in which the units are\r\nsegregated. Of two cousins who have married, the common grandparents may\r\nhave had either similar or dissimilar constitutions; and if their\r\nconstitutions were dissimilar, the probability that their married\r\ngrandchildren will have offspring will be greater than if their\r\nconstitutions were similar. Or the brothers and sisters from whom these\r\ncousins descended, instead of severally inheriting the constitutions of\r\ntheir parents in tolerably equal degrees, may have severally inherited them\r\nin very different degrees: in which last case, intermarriages among the\r\ncousins will be less likely to prove infertile. Or the brothers and sisters\r\nfrom whom these cousins descended, may severally have married persons very\r\nlike, or very unlike, themselves; and from this cause there may have\r\nresulted, either an undue likeness, or a due unlikeness, between the\r\nmarried cousins.[39] These several causes, conspiring and conflicting in\r\nendless ways and degrees, will work multiform effects. Moreover,\r\ndifferences of segregation will make the reproductive centres produced by\r\nthe same nearly-related organisms, vary considerably in their amounts of\r\nunlikeness; and therefore, supposing their amounts of unlikeness great\r\nenough to cause fertilization, this fertilization will be effective in\r\nvarious degrees. Hence it may happen that among offspring of nearly-related\r\nparents, there may be some in which the want of vigour is not marked, and\r\nothers in which there is decided want of vigour. So that we are alike shown\r\nwhy in-and-in breeding tends to diminish both fertility and vigour: and why\r\nthe effect cannot be a uniform effect, but only an average effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 96. While, if the foregoing arguments are valid, gamogenesis has for its\r\nmain result the initiation of a new development by the overthrow of that\r\napproximate equilibrium arrived at among the molecules of the\r\nparent-organisms, a further result appears to be subserved by it. Those\r\ninferior organisms which habitually multiply by agamogenesis, have\r\nconditions of life that are simple and uniform; while those organisms which\r\nhave highly-complex and variable conditions of life, habitually multiply by\r\ngamogenesis. Now if a species has complex and variable conditions of life,\r\nits members must be severally exposed to sets of conditions that are\r\nslightly different: the aggregates of incident forces cannot be alike for\r\nall the scattered individuals. Hence, as functional deviation must ever be\r\ninducing structural deviation, each individual throughout the area occupied\r\ntends to become fitted for the particular habits which its particular\r\nconditions necessitate; and in so far, _un_fitted for the average habits\r\nproper to the species. But these undue specializations are continually\r\nchecked by gamogenesis. As Mr. Darwin remarks, \"intercrossing plays a very\r\nimportant part in nature in keeping the individuals of the same species, or\r\nof the variety, true and uniform in character:\" the idiosyncratic\r\ndivergences obliterate one another. Gamogenesis, then, is a means of\r\nturning to positive advantage the individual differentiations which, in its\r\nabsence, would result in positive disadvantage. Were it not that\r\nindividuals are ever being made unlike one another by their unlike\r\nconditions, there would not arise in them those contrasts of molecular\r\nconstitution, which we have seen to be needful for producing the fertilized\r\ngerms of new individuals. And were not these individual differentiations\r\never being mutually cancelled, they would end in a fatal narrowness of\r\nadaptation.\r\n\r\nThis truth will be most clearly seen if we reduce it to its purely abstract\r\nform, thus:--Suppose a quite homogeneous species, placed in quite\r\nhomogeneous conditions; and suppose the constitutions of all its members in\r\ncomplete concord with their absolutely-uniform and constant conditions;\r\nwhat must happen? The species, individually and collectively, is in a state\r\nof perfect moving equilibrium. All disturbing forces have been eliminated.\r\nThere remains no force which can, in any way, change the state of this\r\nmoving equilibrium; either in the species as a whole or in its members. But\r\nwe have seen (_First Principles_, § 173) that a moving equilibrium is but a\r\ntransition towards complete equilibration, or death. The absence of\r\ndifferential or un-equilibrated forces among the members of a species, is\r\nthe absence of all forces which can cause changes in the conditions of its\r\nmembers--is the absence of all forces which can initiate new organisms. To\r\nsay, as above, that complete molecular homogeneity existing among the\r\nmembers of a species, must render impossible that mutual molecular\r\ndisturbance which constitutes fertilization, is but another way of saying\r\nthat the actions and re-actions of each organism, being in perfect balance\r\nwith the actions and re-actions of the environment upon it, there remains\r\nin each organism no force by which it differs from any other--no force\r\nwhich any other does not meet with an equal force--no force which can set\r\nup a new evolution among the units of any other.\r\n\r\nAnd so we reach the remarkable conclusion that the life of a species, like\r\nthe life of an individual, is maintained by the unequal and ever-varying\r\nactions of incident forces on its different parts.[40] An individual\r\nhomogeneous throughout, and having its substance everywhere continuously\r\nsubject to like actions, could undergo none of those changes which life\r\nconsists of; and similarly, an absolutely-uniform species, having all its\r\nmembers exposed to identical influences, would be deprived of that\r\ninitiator of change which maintains its existence as a species. Just as, in\r\neach organism, incident forces constantly produce divergences from the mean\r\nstate in various directions, which are constantly balanced by opposite\r\ndivergences indirectly produced by other incident forces; and just as the\r\ncombination of rhythmical functions thus maintained, constitutes the life\r\nof the organism; so, in a species, there is, through gamogenesis, a\r\nperpetual neutralization of those contrary deviations from the mean state\r\nwhich are caused in its different parts by different sets of incident\r\nforces; and it is similarly by the rhythmical production and compensation\r\nof these contrary deviations, that the species continues to live. The\r\nmoving equilibrium in a species, like the moving equilibrium in an\r\nindividual, would rapidly end in complete equilibration, or death, were not\r\nits continually-dissipated forces continually re-supplied from without.\r\nBesides owing to the external world those energies which, from moment to\r\nmoment, keep up the lives of its individual members, every species owes to\r\ncertain more indirect actions of the external world, those energies which\r\nenable it to perpetuate itself in successive generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 97. What evidence still remains may be conveniently woven up along with a\r\nrecapitulation of the argument pursued through the last three chapters. Let\r\nus contemplate the facts in their synthetic order.\r\n\r\nThat compounding and re-compounding through which we pass from the simplest\r\ninorganic substances to the most complex organic substances, has several\r\nconcomitants. Each successive stage of composition presents us with\r\nmolecules that are severally larger or more integrated, that are severally\r\nmore heterogeneous, that are severally more unstable, and that are more\r\nnumerous in their kinds (_First Principles_, § 151). And when we come to\r\nthe substances of which living bodies are formed, we find ourselves among\r\ninnumerable divergent groups and sub-groups of compounds, the units of\r\nwhich are large, heterogeneous, and unstable, in high degrees. There is no\r\nreason to assume that this process ends with the formation of those complex\r\ncolloids which constitute organic matter. A more probable assumption is\r\nthat out of the complex colloidal molecules there are evolved, by a still\r\nfurther integration, molecules which are still more heterogeneous, and of\r\nkinds which are still more multitudinous. What must be their properties?\r\nAlready the colloidal molecules are extremely unstable--capable of being\r\nvariously modified in their characters by very slight incident forces; and\r\nalready the complexity of their polarities prevents them from readily\r\nfalling into such positions of equilibrium as results in crystallization.\r\nNow the organic molecules composed of these colloidal molecules, must be\r\nsimilarly characterized in far higher degrees. Far more numerous must be\r\nthe minute changes that can be wrought in them by minute external forces;\r\nfar more free must they remain for a long time to obey forces tending to\r\nre-distribute them; and far greater must be the number of their kinds.\r\n\r\nSetting out with these physiological units, the existence of which various\r\norganic phenomena compel us to recognize, and the production of which the\r\ngeneral law of Evolution thus leads us to anticipate; we get an insight\r\ninto the phenomena of Genesis, Heredity, and Variation. If each organism is\r\nbuilt of certain of these highly-plastic units peculiar to its\r\nspecies--units which slowly work towards an equilibrium of their complex\r\nproclivities, in producing an aggregate of the specific structure, and\r\nwhich are at the same time slowly modifiable by the re-actions of this\r\naggregate--we see why the multiplication of organisms proceeds in the\r\nseveral ways, and with the various results, which naturalists have\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nHeredity, as shown not only in the repetition of the specific structure but\r\nin the repetition of ancestral deviations from it, becomes a matter of\r\ncourse; and it falls into unison with the fact that, in various inferior\r\norganisms, lost parts can be replaced, and that, in still lower organisms,\r\na fragment can develop into a whole.\r\n\r\nWhile an aggregate of physiological units continues to grow by the\r\nassimilation of matter which it moulds into other units of like type; and\r\nwhile it continues to undergo changes of structure; no equilibrium can be\r\narrived at between the whole and its parts. Under these conditions, then,\r\nan un-differentiated portion of the aggregate--a group of physiological\r\nunits not bound up into a specialized tissue--will be able to arrange\r\nitself into the structure peculiar to the species; and will so arrange\r\nitself, if freed from controlling forces and placed in fit conditions of\r\nnutrition and temperature. Hence the continuance of agamogenesis in\r\nlittle-differentiated organisms, so long as assimilation continues to be\r\ngreatly in excess of expenditure.\r\n\r\nBut let growth be checked and development approach its completion--let the\r\nunits of the aggregate be severally exposed to an almost constant\r\ndistribution of forces; and they must begin to equilibrate themselves.\r\nArranged, as they will gradually be, into comparatively stable attitudes in\r\nrelation to one another, their mobility will diminish; and groups of them,\r\npartially or wholly detached, will no longer readily re-arrange themselves\r\ninto the specific form. Agamogenesis will be no longer possible; or, if\r\npossible, will be no longer easy.\r\n\r\nWhen we remember that the force which keeps the Earth in its orbit is the\r\ngravitation of each particle in the Earth towards every one of the group of\r\nparticles existing 92,000,000 of miles off; we cannot reasonably doubt that\r\neach unit in an organism acts on all the other units, and is reacted on by\r\nthem: not by gravitation only but chiefly by other energies. When, too, we\r\nlearn that glass has its molecular constitution changed by light, and that\r\nsubstances so rigid and stable as metals have their atoms re-arranged by\r\nforces radiated in the dark from adjacent objects;[41] we are obliged to\r\nconclude that the excessively-unstable units of which organisms are built,\r\nmust be sensitive in a transcendant degree to all the forces pervading the\r\norganisms composed of them--must be tending ever to re-adjust, not only\r\ntheir relative attitudes but their molecular structures, into equilibrium\r\nwith these forces. Hence, if aggregates of the same species are differently\r\nconditioned, and re-act differently on their component units, their\r\ncomponent units will be rendered somewhat different; and they will become\r\nthe more different the more widely the re-actions of the aggregates upon\r\nthem differ, and the greater the number of generations through which these\r\ndifferent re-actions of the aggregates upon them are continued.\r\n\r\nIf, then, unlikenesses of function among individuals of the same species,\r\nproduce unlikenesses between the physiological units of one individual and\r\nthose of another, it becomes comprehensible that when groups of units\r\nderived from two individuals are united, the group formed will be more\r\nunstable than either of the groups was before their union. The mixed units\r\nwill be less able to resist those re-distributing forces which cause\r\nevolution; and may thus have restored to them the capacity for development\r\nwhich they had lost.\r\n\r\nThis view harmonizes with the conclusion, which we saw reason to draw, that\r\nfertilization does not depend on any intrinsic peculiarities of sperm-cells\r\nand germ-cells, but depends on their derivation from different individuals.\r\nIt explains the facts that nearly-related individuals are less likely to\r\nhave offspring than others, and that their offspring, when they have them,\r\nare frequently feeble. And it gives us a key to the converse fact that the\r\ncrossing of varieties results in unusual vigour.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind that the slightly-different orders of physiological units\r\nwhich an organism inherits from its parents, are subject to the same set of\r\nforces, and that when the organism is fully developed this set of forces,\r\nbecoming constant, tends slowly to re-mould the two orders of units into\r\nthe same form; we see how it happens that self-fertilization becomes\r\nimpossible in the higher organisms, while it remains possible in the lower\r\norganisms. In long-lived creatures which have tolerably-definite limits of\r\ngrowth, this assimilation of the somewhat-unlike physiological units is\r\nliable to go on to an appreciable extent; whereas in organisms which do not\r\ncontinuously subject their component units to constant forces, there will\r\nbe much less of this assimilation. And where the assimilation is not\r\nconsiderable, the segregation of mixed units may cause the sperm-cells and\r\ngerm-cells developed in the same individual, to be sufficiently different\r\nto produce, by their union, fertile germs; and several generations of\r\nself-fertilizing descendants may succeed one another, before the two orders\r\nof units have had their unlikenesses so far diminished that they will no\r\nlonger do this. The same principles explain for us the variable results of\r\nunion between nearly-related organisms. According to the contrasts among\r\nthe physiological units they inherit from parents and ancestors; according\r\nto the unlike proportions of the contrasted units which they severally\r\ninherit; and according to the degrees of segregation of such units in\r\ndifferent sperm-cells and germ-cells; it may happen that two kindred\r\nindividuals will produce the ordinary number of offspring or will produce\r\nnone; or will at one time be fertile and at another not; or will at one\r\ntime have offspring of tolerable strength and at another time feeble\r\noffspring.\r\n\r\nTo the like causes are also ascribable the phenomena of Variation. These\r\nare unobtrusive while the tolerably-uniform conditions of a species\r\nmaintain tolerable uniformity among the physiological units of its members;\r\nbut they become obtrusive when differences of conditions, entailing\r\nconsiderable functional differences, have entailed decided differences\r\namong the physiological units, and when the different physiological units,\r\ndifferently mingled in every individual, come to be variously segregated\r\nand variously combined.\r\n\r\nDid space permit, it might be shown that this hypothesis is a key to many\r\nfurther facts--to the fact that mixed races are comparatively plastic under\r\nnew conditions; to the fact that pure races show predominant influences in\r\nthe offspring when crossed with mixed races; to the fact that while mixed\r\nbreeds are often of larger growth, pure breeds are the more hardy--have\r\nfunctions less-easily thrown out of balance. But without further argument\r\nit will, I think, be admitted that the power of this hypothesis to explain\r\nso many phenomena, and to bring under a common bond phenomena which seem so\r\nlittle allied, is strong evidence of its truth. And such evidence gains\r\ngreatly in strength on observing that this hypothesis brings the facts of\r\nGenesis, Heredity, and Variation into harmony with first principles. We see\r\nthat these plastic physiological units, which we find ourselves obliged to\r\nassume, are just such more integrated, more heterogeneous, more unstable,\r\nand more multiform molecules, as would result from continuance of the steps\r\nthrough which organic matter is reached. We see that the differentiations\r\nof them assumed to occur in differently-conditioned aggregates, and the\r\nequilibrations of them assumed to occur in aggregates which maintain\r\nconstant conditions, are but corollaries from those universal principles\r\nimplied by the persistence of force. We see that the maintenance of life in\r\nthe successive generations of a species, becomes a consequence of the\r\ncontinual incidence of new forces on the species, to replace the forces\r\nthat are ever being rhythmically equilibrated in the propagation of the\r\nspecies. And we thus see that these apparently-exceptional phenomena\r\ndisplayed in the multiplication of organic beings, fall into their places\r\nas results of the general laws of Evolution. We have, therefore, weighty\r\nreasons for entertaining the hypothesis which affords us this\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X^A.\r\n\r\nGENESIS, HEREDITY, AND VARIATION\r\n\r\n_CONCLUDED_.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 97a. Since the foregoing four chapters were written, thirty-four years\r\nago, the topics with which they deal have been widely discussed and many\r\nviews propounded. Ancient hypotheses have been abandoned, and other\r\nhypotheses, referring tacitly or avowedly to the cell-doctrine, have been\r\nset forth. Before proceeding it will be well to describe the chief among\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nMost if not all of them proceed on the assumption, shown in § 66 to be\r\nneedful, that the structural characters of organisms are determined by the\r\nspecial natures of units which are intermediate between the chemical units\r\nand the morphological units--between the invisible molecules of\r\nproteid-substances and the visible tissue-components called cells.\r\n\r\nFour years after the first edition of this volume was published, appeared\r\nMr. Darwin's work, _The Variation of Animals and Plants under\r\nDomestication_; and in this he set forth his doctrine of Pangenesis.\r\nReferring to the doctrine of physiological units which the preceding\r\nchapters work out, he at first expressed a doubt whether his own was or was\r\nnot the same, but finally concluded that it was different. He was right in\r\nso concluding. Throughout my argument the implication everywhere is that\r\nthe physiological units are all of one kind; whereas Mr. Darwin regards his\r\ncomponent units, or \"gemmules,\" as being of innumerable unlike kinds. He\r\nsupposes that every cell of every tissue gives off gemmules special to\r\nitself, and capable of developing into similar cells. We may here, in\r\npassing, note that this view implies a fundamental distinction between\r\nunicellular organisms and the component cells of multicellular organisms,\r\nwhich are otherwise homologous with them. For while in their essential\r\nstructures, their essential internal changes, and their essential processes\r\nof division, the _Protozoa_ and the component units of the _Metazoa_ are\r\nalike, the doctrine of Pangenesis implies that though the units when\r\nseparate do not give off invisible gemmules the grouped units do.\r\n\r\nMuch more recently have been enunciated the hypotheses of Prof. Weismann,\r\ndiffering from the foregoing hypotheses in two respects. In the first place\r\nit is assumed that the fragment of matter out of which each organism arises\r\nconsists of two portions--one of them, the germ-plasm, reserved within the\r\ngenerative organ of the incipient individual, representing in its\r\ncomponents the structure of the species, and gives origin to the germs of\r\nfuture individuals; and the other of them, similarly representative of the\r\nspecific structure, giving origin to the rest of the body, or soma, but\r\ncontains in its components none of those latent powers possessed by those\r\nof the germ-plasm. In the second place the germ-plasm, in common with the\r\nsoma-plasm, consists of multitudinous kinds of units portioned out to\r\noriginate the various organs. Of these there are groups, sub-groups, and\r\nsub-sub-groups. The largest of them, called \"idants,\" are supposed each to\r\ncontain a number of \"ids\"; within each id there are numerous\r\n\"determinants\"; and each determinant is made up of many \"biophors\"--the\r\nsmallest elements possessing vitality. Passing over details, the essential\r\nassumption is that there exists a separate determinant for each part of the\r\norganism capable of independent variation; and Prof. Weismann infers that\r\nwhile there may be but one for the blood and but one for a considerable\r\narea of skin (as a stripe of the zebra) there must be a determinant for\r\neach scale on a butterfly's wing: the number on the four wings being over\r\ntwo hundred thousand. And then each cluster of biophors composing a\r\ndeterminant has to find its way to the place where there is to be formed\r\nthe part it represents.\r\n\r\nHere it is needless to specify the modifications of these hypotheses\r\nespoused by various biologists--all of them assuming that the structural\r\ntraits of each species are expressed in certain units intermediate between\r\nmorphological units and chemical units.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 97b. A true theory of heredity must be one which recognizes the relevant\r\nphenomena displayed by all classes of organism. We cannot assume two kinds\r\nof heredity, one for plants and another for animals. Hence a theory of\r\nheredity may be first tested by observing whether it is equally applicable\r\nto both kingdoms of living things. Genesis, heredity, and variation, as\r\nseen in plants, are simpler and more accessible than as seen in animals.\r\nLet us then note what these imply.\r\n\r\nAlready in § 77 I have illustrated the power which some plants possess of\r\ndeveloping new individuals from mere fragments of leaves and even from\r\ndetached scales. Striking as are the facts there instanced, they are\r\nscarcely more significant than some which are familiar. The formation of\r\ncauline buds, presently growing into shoots, shows us a kind of inheritance\r\nwhich a true theory must explain. As described by Kerner, such buds arise\r\nin Pimpernel, Toad-flax, etc., below the seed-leaves, even while yet there\r\nare no axils in which buds usually grow; and in many plants they arise from\r\nintermediate places on the stem: that is, without definite relations to\r\npre-existing structures. How fortuitous is their origin is shown when a\r\nbranch is induced to bud by keeping it wrapped round with a wet cloth. Even\r\nstill better proved is the absence of any relation between cauline buds and\r\nnormal germs by the frequent growth of them out of \"callus\"--the tissue\r\nwhich spreads over wounds and the cut ends of branches.  It is not easy to\r\nreconcile these facts with Mr. Darwin's hypothesis of gemmules. We have to\r\nassume that where a cauline bud emerges there are present in due\r\nproportions gemmules of all the parts which will presently arise from\r\nit--leaves, stipules, bracts, petals, stamens, anthers, etc. We have to\r\nassume this though, at the time the bud originates, sundry of these organs,\r\nas the parts of flowers, do not exist on the plant or tree. And we have to\r\nassume that the gemmules of such parts are duly provided in a portion of\r\nadventitious callus, far away from the normal places of fructification.\r\nMoreover, the resulting shoot may or may not produce all the parts which\r\nthe gemmules represent; and when, perhaps after years, flowers are produced\r\non its side shoots, there must exist at each point the needful proportion\r\nof the required gemmules; though there have been no cells continually\r\ngiving them off.\r\n\r\nStill less does the hypothesis of Prof. Weismann harmonize with the\r\nevidence as plants display it. Plant-embryogeny yields no sign of\r\nseparation between germ-plasm and soma-plasm; and, indeed, the absence of\r\nsuch separation is admitted. After instancing cases among certain of the\r\nlower animals, in which no differentiation of the two arises in the first\r\ngeneration resulting from a fertilized ovum, Prof. Weismann continues:--\r\n\r\n  \"The same is true as regards the higher plants, in which the first shoot\r\n  arising from the seed never contains germ-cells, or even cells which\r\n  subsequently become differentiated into germ cells. In all these\r\n  last-mentioned cases the germ-cells are not present in the first person\r\n  arising by embryogeny as special cells, but are only formed in much later\r\n  cell-generations from the offspring of certain cells of which this first\r\n  person was composed.\" (_Germ-Plasm_, p. 185.)\r\n\r\nHow this admission consists with the general theory it is difficult to\r\nunderstand. The units of the soma-plasm are here recognized as having the\r\nsame generative powers as the units of the germ-plasm. In so far as one\r\norganic kingdom and a considerable part of the other are concerned the\r\ndoctrine is relinquished. Relinquishment is, indeed, necessitated even by\r\nthe ordinary facts, and still more by the facts just instanced. Defence of\r\nit involves the assertion that where buds arise, normal or cauline, there\r\nexist in due proportion the various ids with their contained\r\ndeterminants--that these are diffused throughout the growing part of the\r\nsoma; and this implies that the somatic tissue does not differ in\r\ngenerative power from the germ-plasm.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of physiological units, then, remains outstanding. For\r\ncauline buds imply that throughout the plant-tissue, where not unduly\r\ndifferentiated, the local physiological units have a power of arranging\r\nthemselves into the structure of the species.\r\n\r\nBut this hypothesis, too, as it now stands, is inadequate. Under the form\r\nthus far given to it, it fails to explain some accompanying facts. For if\r\nthe branch just instanced as producing a cauline bud be cut off and its end\r\nstuck in the ground, or if it be bent down and a portion of it covered with\r\nearth, there will grow from it rootlets and presently roots. The same\r\nportion of tissue which otherwise would have produced a shoot with all its\r\nappendages, constituting an individual, now produces only a special part of\r\nan individual.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 97c. Certain kindred facts of animal development may now be considered.\r\nSimilar insufficiencies are disclosed.\r\n\r\nThe often-cited reproduction of a crab's lost claw or a lizard's tail, Mr.\r\nDarwin thought explicable by his hypothesis of diffused gemmules,\r\nrepresenting all organs or their component cells. But though, after simple\r\namputation, regrowth of the proximate part of the tail is conceivable as\r\nhence resulting, it is not easy to understand how the remoter part, the\r\ncomponents of which are now absent from the organism, can arise afresh from\r\ngemmules no longer originated in due proportion. Prof. Weismann's\r\nhypothesis, again, implies that there must exist at the place of\r\nseparation, a ready-provided supply of determinants, previously latent,\r\nable to reproduce the missing tail in all its details--nay, even to do this\r\nseveral times over: a strong supposition! The hypothesis of physiological\r\nunits, as set forth in preceding chapters, appears less incompetent:\r\nreproduction of the lost part would seem to be a normal result of the\r\nproclivity towards the form of the entire organism. But now what are we to\r\nsay when, instead of being cut off transversely, the tail is divided\r\nlongitudinally and each half becomes a complete tail? What are we to say\r\nwhen, if these two tails are similarly dealt with, the halves again\r\ncomplete themselves; and so until as many as sixteen tails have been\r\nformed? Here the hypothesis of physiological units appears to fail utterly;\r\nfor the tendency it implies is to complete the specific form, by\r\nreproducing a single tail only.\r\n\r\nVarious annulose animals display anomalies of development difficult to\r\nexplain on any hypothesis. We have creatures like the fresh-water _Nais_\r\nwhich, though it has advanced structures, including a vascular system,\r\nbranchiæ, and a nervous cord ending with cephalic ganglia, nevertheless\r\nshows us an ability like that of the _Hydra_ to reproduce the whole from a\r\nsmall part: nearly forty pieces into which a _Nais_ was cut having\r\nseverally grown into complete animals. Again we have, in the order\r\n_Polychætæ_, types like _Myrianida_, in which by longitudinal budding a\r\nstring of individuals, sometimes numbering even thirty, severally develop\r\ncertain segments into heads, while increasing their segments in number. In\r\nyet other types there occurs not longitudinal gemmation only, but lateral\r\ngemmation: a segment will send out sideways a bud which presently becomes a\r\ncomplete worm. Once more, _Syllis ramosa_ is a species in which the\r\nindividual worms growing from lateral buds, while remaining attached to the\r\nparent, themselves give origin to buds; and so produce a branched aggregate\r\nof worms. How shall we explain the reparative and reproductive powers thus\r\nexemplified? It seems undeniable that each portion has an ability to\r\nproduce, according to circumstances, the whole creature or a missing part\r\nof the creature. When we read of Sir J. Dalyell that he \"cut a _Dasychone_\r\ninto three pieces; the hindermost produced a head, the anterior piece\r\ndeveloped an anus, and the middle portion formed both a head and a tail\" we\r\nare not furnished with an explanation by the hypothesis of gemmules or by\r\nthe hypothesis of determinants; for we cannot arbitrarily assume that\r\nwherever a missing organ has to be produced there exists the needful supply\r\nof gemmules or of determinants representing that organ. The hypothesis that\r\nphysiological units have everywhere a proclivity towards the organic form\r\nof the species, appears more congruous with the facts; but even this does\r\nnot cover the cases in which a new worm grows from a lateral bud. The\r\ntendency to complete the individual structure might be expected rather to\r\nrestrain this breaking of the lines of complete structure.\r\n\r\nStill less explicable in any way thus far proposed are certain remedial\r\nactions seen in animals. An example of them was furnished in § 67, where\r\n\"false joints\" were described--joints formed at places where the ends of a\r\nbroken bone, failing to unite, remain moveable one upon the other.\r\nAccording to the character of the habitual motions there results a rudely\r\nformed hinge-joint or a ball-and-socket joint, either having the various\r\nconstituent parts--periosteum, fibrous tissue, capsule, ligaments. Now Mr.\r\nDarwin's hypothesis, contemplating only normal structures, fails to account\r\nfor this formation of an abnormal structure. Neither can we ascribe this\r\nlocal development to determinants: there were no appropriate ones in the\r\ngerm-plasm, since no such structure was provided for. Nor does the\r\nhypothesis of physiological units, as presented in preceding chapters,\r\nyield an interpretation. These could have no other tendency than to restore\r\nthe normal form of the limb, and might be expected to oppose the genesis of\r\nthese new parts.\r\n\r\nThus we have to seek, if not another hypothesis, then some such\r\nqualification of an existing hypothesis as will harmonize it with various\r\nexceptional phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 97d. In Part II of the _Principles of Sociology_, published in 1876, will\r\nbe found elaborated in detail that analogy between individual organization\r\nand social organization which was briefly sketched out in an essay on \"The\r\nSocial Organism\" published in 1860. In §§ 241-3 a parallel is drawn between\r\nthe developments of the sustaining systems of the two; and it is pointed\r\nout how, in the one case as in the other, the components--here organic\r\nunits and there citizens--have their activities and arrangements mainly\r\nsettled by local conditions. One leading example is that the parts\r\nconstituting the alimentary canal, while jointly fitted to the nature of\r\nthe food, are severally adapted to the successive stages at which the food\r\narrives in its progress; and that in an analogous way the industries\r\ncarried on by peoples forming different parts of a society, are primarily\r\ndetermined by the natures of things around--agriculture, pastoral and\r\narable, special manufactures and minings, ship-building and fishing: the\r\nrespective groups falling into fit combinations and becoming partially\r\nmodified to suit their work. The implication is that while the organization\r\nof a society as a whole depends on the characters of its units, in such way\r\nthat by some types of men despotisms are always evolved while by other\r\ntypes there are evolved forms of government partially free--forms which\r\nrepeat themselves in colonies--there is, on the other hand, in every case a\r\nlocal power of developing appropriate structures. And it might have been\r\npointed out that similarly in types of creatures not showing much\r\nconsolidation, as the _Annelida_, many of the component divisions, largely\r\nindependent in their vitalities, are but little affected in their\r\nstructures by the entire aggregate.\r\n\r\nMy purpose at that time being the elucidation of sociological truths, it\r\ndid not concern me to carry further the biological half of this comparison.\r\nOtherwise there might have been named the case in which a supernumerary\r\nfinger, beginning to bud out, completes itself as a local organ with bones,\r\nmuscles, skin, nail, etc., in defiance of central control: even repeating\r\nitself when cut off.  There might also have been instanced the above-named\r\nformation of a false joint with its appurtenances. For the implication in\r\nboth cases is that a local group of units, determined by circumstances\r\ntowards a certain structure, coerces its individual units into that\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nNow let us contemplate the essential fact in the analogy. The men in an\r\nAustralian mining-camp, as M. Pierre Leroy Beaulieu points out, fall into\r\nAnglo-Saxon usages different from those which would characterize a French\r\nmining-camp. Emigrants to a far West settlement in America quickly\r\nestablish post-office, bank, hotel, newspaper, and other urban\r\ninstitutions. We are thus shown that along with certain traits leading to a\r\ngeneral type of social organization, there go traits which independently\r\nproduce fit local organizations. Individuals are led into occupations and\r\nofficial posts, often quite new to them, by the wants of those around--are\r\nnow influenced and now coerced into social arrangements which, as shown\r\nperhaps by gambling saloons, by shootings at sight, and by lynchings, are\r\nscarcely at all affected by the central government. Now the physiological\r\nunits in each species appear to have a similar combination of capacities.\r\nBesides their general proclivity towards the specific organization, they\r\nshow us abilities to organize themselves locally; and these abilities are\r\nin some cases displayed in defiance of the general control, as in the\r\nsupernumerary finger or the false joint. Apparently each physiological\r\nunit, while having in a manner the whole organism as the structure which,\r\nalong with the rest, it tends to form, has also an aptitude to take part in\r\nforming any local structure, and to assume its place in that structure\r\nunder the influence of adjacent physiological units.\r\n\r\nA familiar fact supports this conclusion. Everyone has at hand, not\r\nfiguratively but literally, an illustration. Let him compare the veins on\r\nthe backs of his two hands, either with one another or with the veins on\r\nanother person's hands, and he will see that the branchings and\r\ninosculations do not correspond: there is no fixed pattern. But on\r\nprogressing inwards from the extremities, the distribution of the veins\r\nbecomes settled--there is a pattern-arrangement common to all persons.\r\nThese facts imply a predominating control by adjacent parts where control\r\nby the aggregate is less easy. A constant combination of forces which,\r\ntowards the centre, produces a typical structure, fails to do this at the\r\nperiphery where, during development, the play of forces is less settled.\r\nThis peripheral vascular structure, not having become fixed because one\r\narrangement is as good as another, is in each determined by the immediately\r\nsurrounding influences.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 97e. And now let us contemplate the verifications which recent\r\nexperiments have furnished--experiments made by Prof. G. Born of Breslau,\r\nconfirming results earlier reached by Vulpian and adding more striking\r\nresults of kindred nature. They leave no longer doubtful the large share\r\ntaken by local organizing power as distinguished from central organizing\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe independent vitality shown by separated portions of ventral skin from\r\nfrog-larvæ may be named as the first illustration. With their attached\r\nyolk-cells these lived for days, and underwent such transformations as\r\nproved some structural proclivity, though of course the product was\r\namorphous. Detached portions of tails of larvæ went on developing their\r\ncomponent parts in much the same ways as they would have done if remaining\r\nattached. More striking still was the evidence furnished by experiments in\r\ngrafting. These proved that the undifferentiated rudiment of an organ will,\r\nwhen cut off and joined to a non-homologous place in another individual,\r\ndevelop itself as it would have done if left in its original place. In\r\nbrief, then, we may say that each part is in chief measure autogenous.\r\n\r\nThese strange facts presented by small aggregates of organic matter, which\r\nare the seats of extremely complex forces, will seem less incomprehensible\r\nif we observe what has taken place in a vast aggregate of inorganic matter\r\nwhich is the seat of very simple forces--the Solar System. Transcendently\r\ndifferent as this is in all other respects, it is analogous in the respect\r\nthat, as factors of local structures, local influences predominate over the\r\ninfluences of the aggregate. For while the members of the Solar System,\r\nconsidered as a whole, are subordinate to the totality of its forces, the\r\narrangements in each part of it are produced almost wholly by the play of\r\nforces in that part. Though the Sun affects the motions of the Moon, and\r\nthough during the evolution of the Earth-and-Moon system the Sun exercised\r\nan influence, yet the relations of our world and its satellite in respect\r\nof masses and motions were in the main locally determined. Still more\r\nclearly was it thus with Jupiter and his satellites or Saturn with his\r\nrings and satellites. Remembering that the ultimate units of matter of\r\nwhich the Solar System is composed are of the same kinds, and that they act\r\non one another in conformity with the same laws, we see that, remote as the\r\ncase is from the one we are considering in all other respects, it is\r\nsimilar in the respect that during organization the energies in each\r\nlocality work effects which are almost independent of the effects worked by\r\nthe general energies. In this vast aggregate, as in the minute aggregates\r\nnow in question, the parts are practically autogenous.\r\n\r\nHaving thus seen that in a way we have not hitherto recognized the same\r\ngeneral principles pervade inorganic and organic evolution, let us revert\r\nto the case of super-organic evolution from which a parallel was drawn\r\nabove. As analogous to the germinal mass of units out of which a new\r\norganism is to evolve, let us take an assemblage of colonists not yet\r\nsocially organized but placed in a fertile region--men derived from a\r\nsociety (or rather a succession of societies) of long-established type, who\r\nhave in their adapted natures the proclivity towards that type. In passing\r\nfrom its wholly unorganized state to an organized state, what will be the\r\nfirst step?  Clearly this assemblage, though it may have within the\r\nconstitutions of its units the potentialities of a specific structure, will\r\nnot develop forthwith the details of that structure. The inherited natures\r\nof its units will first show themselves by separating into large groups\r\ndevoted to strongly-distinguished occupations. The great mass, dispersing\r\nover promising lands, will make preparations for farming. Another\r\nconsiderable portion, prompted by the general needs, will begin to form a\r\ncluster of habitations and a trading centre. Yet a third group, recognizing\r\nthe demand for wood, alike for agricultural and building purposes, will\r\nbetake themselves to the adjacent forests. But in no case will the primary\r\nassemblage, before these separations, settle the arrangements and actions\r\nof each group: it will leave each group to settle them for itself. So, too,\r\nafter these divisions have arisen. The agricultural division will not as a\r\nwhole prescribe the doings of its members. Spontaneous segregation will\r\noccur: some going to a pastoral region and some to a tract which promises\r\ngood crops. Nor within each of these bodies will the organization be\r\ndictated by the whole. The pastoral group will separate itself into\r\nclusters who tend sheep on the hills and clusters who feed cattle on the\r\nplains. Meanwhile those who have gravitated towards urban occupations will\r\nsome of them make bricks or quarry stone, while others fall into classes\r\nwho build walls, classes who prepare fittings, classes who supply\r\nfurniture. Then along with completion of the houses will go occupation of\r\nthem by men who bake bread, who make clothing, who sell liquors, and so on.\r\nThus each great group will go on organizing itself irrespective of the\r\nrest; the sub-groups within each will do the same; and so will the\r\nsub-sub-groups. Quite independently of the people on the hills and the\r\nplains and in the town, those in the forest will divide spontaneously into\r\nparties who cut down trees, parties who trim and saw them, parties who\r\ncarry away the timbers; while every party forms for itself an organization\r\nof \"butty\" or \"boss,\" and those who work under him.  Similarly with the\r\nultimate divisions--the separate families: the arrangements and\r\napportionments of duties in each are internally determined. Mark the fact\r\nwhich here chiefly concerns us. This formation of a heterogeneous aggregate\r\nwith its variously adapted parts, which while influenced by the whole are\r\nmainly self-formed, goes on among units of essentially the same natures,\r\ninherited from units who belonged to similar societies. And now, carrying\r\nthis conception with us, we may dimly perceive how, in a developing embryo,\r\nthere may take place the formation, first of the great divisions--the\r\nprimary layers--then of the outlines of systems, then of component organs,\r\nand so on continually with the minor structures contained in major\r\nstructures; and how each of these progressively smaller divisions develops\r\nits own organization, irrespective of the changes going on throughout the\r\nrest of the embryo. So that though all parts are composed of physiological\r\nunits of the same nature, yet everywhere, in virtue of local conditions and\r\nthe influence of its neighbours, each unit joins in forming the particular\r\nstructure appropriate to the place. Thus conceiving the matter, we may in a\r\nvague way understand the strange facts of autogenous development disclosed\r\nby the above named experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 97f. \"But how immeasurably complex must be the physiological units which\r\ncan behave thus!\" will be remarked by the reader. \"To be able to play all\r\nparts, alike as members of the whole and as members of this or that organ,\r\nthey must have an unimaginable variety of potentialities in their natures.\r\nEach must, indeed, be almost a microcosm within a microcosm.\"\r\n\r\nDoubtless this is true. Still we have a _consensus_ of proofs that the\r\ncomponent units of organisms have constitutions of extremely involved\r\nkinds. Contemplate the facts and their implications. (1) Here is some large\r\ndivision of the animal kingdom--say the _Vertebrata_. The component units\r\nof all its members have certain fundamental traits in common: all of them\r\nhave proclivities towards formation of a vertebral column. Leaving behind\r\nthe great assemblage of Fishes with its multitudinous types, each having\r\nspecial units of composition, we pass to the _Amphibia_, in the units of\r\nwhich there exist certain traits superposed upon the traits they have in\r\ncommon with those of Fishes. Through unknown links we ascend to incipient\r\nMammalian types and then to developed Mammalian types, the units of which\r\nmust have further superposed traits. Additional traits distinguish the\r\nunits of each Mammalian order; and, again, those of every genus included in\r\nit; while others severally characterize the units of each species.\r\nSimilarly with the varieties in each species, and the stirps in each\r\nvariety. Now the ability of any component unit to carry within itself the\r\ntraits of the sub-kingdom, class, order, genus, species, variety, and at\r\nthe same time to bear the traits of immediate ancestors, can exist only in\r\na something having multitudinous proximate elements arranged in innumerable\r\nways. (2) Again, these units must be at once in some respects fixed and in\r\nother respects plastic. While their fundamental traits, expressing the\r\nstructure of the type, must be unchangeable, their superficial traits must\r\nadmit of modification without much difficulty; and the modified traits,\r\nexpressing variations in the parents and immediate ancestors, though\r\nunstable, must be considered as capable of becoming stable in course of\r\ntime. (3) Once more we have to think of these physiological units (or\r\nconstitutional units as I would now re-name them) as having such natures\r\nthat while a minute modification, representing some small change of local\r\nstructure, is inoperative on the proclivities of the units throughout the\r\nrest of the system, it becomes operative in the units which fall into the\r\nlocality where that change occurs.\r\n\r\nBut unimaginable as all this is, the facts may nevertheless in some way\r\nanswer to it. As before remarked, progressing science reveals complexity\r\nwithin complexity--tissues made up of cells, cells containing nuclei and\r\ncytoplasm, cytoplasm formed of a protoplasmic matrix containing granules;\r\nand if now we conclude that the unit of protoplasm is itself an\r\ninconceivably elaborate structure, we do but recognize the complexity as\r\ngoing still deeper. Further, if we must assume that these component units\r\nare in every part of the body acting on one another by extremely\r\ncomplicated sets of forces (ethereal undulations emanating from each of the\r\nconstituent molecules) determining their relative positions and actions, we\r\nare warranted by the discoveries which every day disclose more of the\r\nmarvellous properties of matter. When to such examples as were given in\r\n§ 36e we add the example yielded by recent experiments, showing that even a\r\npiece of bread, after subjection to pressure, exhibits diamagnetic\r\nproperties unlike those it previously exhibited, we cannot doubt that these\r\ncomplex units composing living bodies are all of them seats of energies\r\ndiffused around, enabling them to act and re-act so as to modify one\r\nanother's states and positions. We are shown, too, that whatever be the\r\nnatures of the complex forces emanating from each, it will, as a matter of\r\ncourse, happen that the power of each will be relatively great in its own\r\nneighbourhood and become gradually smaller in parts increasingly remote:\r\nmaking more comprehensible the autogenous character of each local\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nWhatever be their supposed natures we are compelled to ascribe extreme\r\ncomplexity to these unknown somethings which have the power of organizing\r\nthemselves into a structure of this or that species. If gemmules be\r\nalleged, then the ability of every organ and part of an organ to vary,\r\nimplies that the gemmules it gives off are severally capable of receiving\r\nminute modifications of their ordinary structures: they must have many\r\nparts admitting of innumerable relations. Supposing determinants be\r\nassumed, then in addition to the complexity which each must have to express\r\nin itself the structure of the part evolved from it, it must have the\r\nfurther complexity implied by every superposed modification which causes a\r\nvariation of that part. And, as we have just seen, the hypothesis of\r\nphysiological units does not relieve us from the need for kindred\r\nsuppositions.\r\n\r\nOne more assumption seems necessary if we are to imagine how changes of\r\nstructure caused by changes of function can be transmitted. Reverting to\r\n§ 54d, where an unceasing circulation of protoplasm throughout an organism\r\nwas inferred, we must conceive that the complex forces of which each\r\nconstitutional unit is the centre, and by which it acts on other units\r\nwhile it is acted on by them, tend continually to remould each unit into\r\ncongruity with the structures around: superposing on it modifications\r\nanswering to the modifications which have arisen in those structures.\r\nWhence is to be drawn the corollary that in course of time all the\r\ncirculating units,--physiological, or constitutional if we prefer so to\r\ncall them--visiting all parts of the organism, are severally made bearers\r\nof traits expressing local modifications; and that those units which are\r\neventually gathered into sperm-cells and germ-cells also bear these\r\nsuperposed traits.\r\n\r\nIf against all this it be urged that such a combination of structures and\r\nforces and processes is inconceivably involved, then the reply is that so\r\nastonishing a transformation as that which an unfolding organism displays\r\ncannot possibly be effected by simple agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 97g. But now let it be confessed that none of these hypotheses serves to\r\nrender the phenomena really intelligible; and that probably no hypothesis\r\nwhich can be framed will do this. Many problems beyond those which\r\nembryology presents have to be solved; and no solution is furnished.\r\n\r\nWhat are we to say of the familiar fact that certain small organs which,\r\nwith the approach to maturity, become active, entail changes of structure\r\nin remote parts--that after the testes have undergone certain final\r\ndevelopments, the hairs on the chin grow and the voice deepens? It has been\r\ncontended that certain concomitant modifications in the fluids throughout\r\nthe body may produce correlated sexual traits; and there is proof that in\r\nmany of the lower animals the period of sexual activity is accompanied by a\r\nspecial bodily state--sometimes such that the flesh becomes unwholesome and\r\neven poisonous. But a change of this kind can hardly account for a\r\nstructural change in the vocal organs in Man. No hypothesis of gemmules or\r\ndeterminants or physiological units enables us to understand how removal of\r\nthe testes prevents those developments of the larynx and vocal cords which\r\ntake place if they remain.\r\n\r\nThe inadequacy of our explanations we at once see in presence of a\r\nstructure like a peacock's tail-feather. Mr. Darwin's hypothesis is that\r\nall parts of every organ are continually giving off gemmules, which are\r\nconsequently everywhere present in their due proportions. But a completed\r\nfeather is an inanimate product and, once formed, can add to the\r\ncirculating fluids no gemmules representing all its parts. If we follow\r\nProf. Weismann we are led into an astounding supposition. He admits that\r\nevery variable part must have a special determinant, and that this results\r\nin the assumption of over two hundred thousand for the four wings of a\r\nbutterfly. Let us ask what must happen in the case of a peacock's feather.\r\nOn looking at the eye near its end, we see that the minute processes on the\r\nedge of each lateral thread must have been in some way exactly adjusted, in\r\ncolour and position, so as to fall into line with the processes on adjacent\r\nthreads: otherwise the symmetrical arrangement of coloured rings would be\r\nimpossible. Each of these processes, then, being an independent variable,\r\nmust have had its particular determinant. Now there are about 300 threads\r\non the shaft of a large feather, and each of them bears on the average\r\n1,600 processes, making for the whole feather 480,000 of these processes.\r\nFor one feather alone there must have been 480,000 determinants, and for\r\nthe whole tail many millions. And these, along with the determinants for\r\nthe detailed parts of all the other feathers, and for the variable\r\ncomponents of all organs forming the body at large, must have been\r\ncontained in the microscopic head of a spermatozoon! Hardly a credible\r\nsupposition. Nor is it easy to see how we are helped by the hypothesis of\r\nconstitutional units. Take the feather in its budding state and ask how the\r\ngroup of such units, alike in structure and perpetually multiplying while\r\nthe unfolding goes on, can be supposed by their mutual actions so to affect\r\none another as eventually to produce the symmetrically-adjusted processes\r\nwhich constitute the terminal eye. Imagination, whatever licence may be\r\ngiven, utterly fails us.\r\n\r\nAt last then we are obliged to admit that the actual organizing process\r\ntranscends conception. It is not enough to say that we cannot know it; we\r\nmust say that we cannot even conceive it. And this is just the conclusion\r\nwhich might have been drawn before contemplating the facts. For if, as we\r\nsaw in the chapter on \"The Dynamic Element in Life,\" it is impossible for\r\nus to understand the nature of this element--if even the ordinary\r\nmanifestations of it which a living body yields from moment to moment are\r\nat bottom incomprehensible; then, still more incomprehensible must be that\r\nastonishing manifestation of it which we have in the initiation and\r\nunfolding of a new organism.\r\n\r\nThus all we can do is to find some way of symbolizing the process so as to\r\nenable us most conveniently to generalize its phenomena; and the only\r\nreason for adopting the hypothesis of physiological units or constitutional\r\nunits is that it best serves this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 98. That orderly arrangement of objects called Classification has two\r\npurposes, which, though not absolutely distinct, are distinct in great\r\npart. It may be employed to facilitate identification, or it may be\r\nemployed to organize our knowledge. If a librarian places his books in the\r\nalphabetical succession of the author's names, he places them in such way\r\nthat any particular book may easily be found, but not in such way that\r\nbooks of a given nature stand together. When, otherwise, he makes a\r\ndistribution of books according to their subjects, he neglects various\r\nsuperficial similarities and distinctions, and groups them according to\r\ncertain primary and secondary and tertiary attributes, which severally\r\nimply many other attributes--groups them so that any one volume being\r\ninspected, the general characters of all the neighbouring volumes may be\r\ninferred. He puts together in one great division all works on History; in\r\nanother all Biographical works; in another all works that treat of Science;\r\nin another Voyages and Travels; and so on. Each of his great groups he\r\nseparates into sub-groups; as when he puts different kinds of Literature\r\nunder the heads of Fiction, Poetry, and the Drama. In some cases he makes\r\nsub-sub-groups; as when, having divided his Scientific treatises into\r\nabstract and concrete, putting in the one Logic and Mathematics and in the\r\nother Physics, Astronomy, Geology, Chemistry, Physiology, &c.; he goes on\r\nto sub-divide his books on Physics, into those which treat of Mechanical\r\nMotion, those which treat of Heat, those which treat of Light, of\r\nElectricity, of Magnetism.\r\n\r\nBetween these two modes of classification note the essential distinctions.\r\nArrangement according to any single conspicuous attribute is comparatively\r\neasy, and is the first that suggests itself: a child may place books in the\r\norder of their sizes, or according to the styles of their bindings. But\r\narrangement according to combinations of attributes which, though\r\nfundamental, are not conspicuous, requires analysis; and does not suggest\r\nitself till analysis has made some progress. Even when aided by the\r\ninformation which the author gives on his title page, it requires\r\nconsiderable knowledge to classify rightly an essay on Polarization; and in\r\nthe absence of a title page it requires much more knowledge. Again,\r\nclassification by a single attribute, which the objects possess in\r\ndifferent degrees, may be more or less serial, or linear. Books may be put\r\nin the order of their dates, in single file; or if they are grouped as\r\nworks in one volume, works in two volumes, works in three volumes, &c., the\r\ngroups may be placed in an ascending succession. But groups severally\r\nformed of things distinguished by some common attribute which implies many\r\nother attributes, do not admit of serial arrangement. You cannot rationally\r\nsay either that Historical Works should come before Biographical Works, or\r\nBiographical Works before Historical Works; nor of the sub-divisions of\r\ncreative Literature, into Fiction, Poetry, and the Drama, can you give a\r\ngood reason why any one should take precedence of the others.\r\n\r\nHence this grouping of the like and separation of the unlike which\r\nconstitutes Classification, can reach its complete form only by slow steps.\r\nI have shown (_Essays_, Vol. II., pp. 145-7) that, other things equal, the\r\nrelations among phenomena are recognized in the order of their\r\nconspicuousness; and that, other things equal, they are recognized in the\r\norder of their simplicity. The first classifications are sure, therefore,\r\nto be groupings of objects which resemble one another in external or\r\neasily-perceived attributes, and attributes that are not of complex\r\ncharacters. Those likenesses among things which are due to their possession\r\nin common of simple obvious properties, may or may not coexist with further\r\nlikenesses among them. When geometrical figures are classed as curvilinear\r\nand rectilinear, or when the rectilinear are divided into trilateral,\r\nquadrilateral, &c., the distinctions made connote various other\r\ndistinctions with which they are necessarily bound up; but if liquids be\r\nclassed according to their visible characters--if water, alcohol, sulphuret\r\nof carbon, &c., be grouped as colourless and transparent, we have things\r\nplaced together which are unlike in their essential natures. Thus, where\r\nthe objects classed have numerous attributes, the probabilities are that\r\nthe early classifications, based on simple and manifest attributes, unite\r\nunder the same head many objects that have no resemblance in the majority\r\nof their attributes. As the knowledge of objects increases, it becomes\r\npossible to make groups of which the members have more numerous properties\r\nin common; and to ascertain what property, or combination of properties, is\r\nmost characteristic of each group. And the classification eventually\r\narrived at is of such kind that the objects in each group have more\r\nattributes in common with one another than they have in common with any\r\nexcluded objects; one in which the groups of such groups are integrated on\r\nthe same principle; and one in which the degrees of differentiation and\r\nintegration are proportioned to the degrees of intrinsic unlikeness and\r\nlikeness. And this ultimate classification, while it serves to identify the\r\nthings completely, serves also to express the greatest amount of knowledge\r\nconcerning the things--enables us to predicate the greatest number of facts\r\nabout each thing; and by so doing implies the most precise correspondence\r\nbetween our conceptions and the realities.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 99. Biological classifications illustrate well these phases through which\r\nclassifications in general pass. In early attempts to arrange organisms in\r\nsome systematic manner, we see at first a guidance by conspicuous and\r\nsimple characters, and a tendency towards arrangement in linear order. In\r\nsuccessively later attempts, we see more regard paid to combinations of\r\ncharacters which are essential but often inconspicuous, and an abandonment\r\nof a linear arrangement for an arrangement in divergent groups and\r\nre-divergent sub-groups.\r\n\r\nIn the popular mind, plants are still classed under the heads of Trees,\r\nShrubs, and Herbs; and this serial classing according to the single\r\nattribute of magnitude, swayed the earliest observers. They would have\r\nthought it absurd to call a bamboo, thirty feet high, a kind of grass; and\r\nwould have been incredulous if told that the Hart's-tongue should be placed\r\nin the same great division with the Tree-ferns. The zoological\r\nclassifications current before Natural History became a science, had\r\ndivisions similarly superficial and simple. Beasts, Birds, Fishes, and\r\nCreeping-things are names of groups marked off from one another by\r\nconspicuous differences of appearance and modes of life--creatures that\r\nwalk and run, creatures that fly, creatures that live in the water,\r\ncreatures that crawl. And these groups were thought of in the order of\r\ntheir importance.\r\n\r\nThe first arrangements made by naturalists were based either on single\r\ncharacters or on very simple combinations of characters; as that of\r\nClusius, and afterwards the more scientific system of Cesalpino,\r\nrecognizing the importance of inconspicuous structures. Describing\r\nplant-classifications, Lindley says:--\"Rivinus invented, in 1690, a system\r\ndepending upon the formation of the corolla; Kamel, in 1693, upon the fruit\r\nalone; Magnol, in 1720, on the calyx and corolla; and finally, Linnæus, in\r\n1731, on variations in the stamens and pistil.\" In this last system, which\r\nhas been for so long current as a means of identification (regarded by its\r\nauthor as transitional), simple external attributes are still depended on;\r\nand an arrangement, in great measure serial, is based on the degrees in\r\nwhich these attributes are possessed. In 1703, some thirty years before the\r\ntime of Linnæus, our countryman Ray had sketched the outlines of a more\r\nadvanced system. He said that--\r\n\r\n  Plants are either\r\n          Flowerless, or\r\n          Flowering; and these are\r\n                  Dicotyledones, or\r\n                  Monocotyledones.\r\n\r\nAmong the minor groups which he placed under these general heads, \"were\r\nFungi, Mosses, Ferns, Composites, Cichoraceæ, Umbellifers, Papilionaceous\r\nplants, Conifers, Labiates, &c., under other names, but with limits not\r\nvery different from those now assigned to them.\" Being much in advance of\r\nhis age, Ray's ideas remained dormant until the time of Jussieu; by whom\r\nthey were developed into what has become known as the Natural System: a\r\nsystem subsequently improved by De Candolle. Passing through various\r\nmodifications in the hands of successive botanists, the Natural System is\r\nnow represented by the following form, which is based upon the table of\r\ncontents prefixed to Vol. II. of Prof. Oliver's translation of the _Natural\r\nHistory of Plants_, by Prof. Kerner. His first division, Myxothallophyta (=\r\nMyxomycetes), I have ventured to omit. The territory it occupies is in\r\ndispute between zoologists and botanists, and as I have included the group\r\nin the zoological classification, agreeing that its traits are more animal\r\nthan vegetal, I cannot also include it in the botanical classification.\r\n\r\nHere, linear arrangement has disappeared: there is a breaking up into\r\ngroups and sub-groups and sub-sub-groups, which do not admit of being\r\nplaced in serial order, but only in divergent and re-divergent order. Were\r\nthere space to exhibit the way in which the Alliances are subdivided into\r\nOrders, and these into Genera, and these into Species, the same principle\r\nof co-ordination would be still further manifested.\r\n\r\n  PHYLA.

Umbellales.\r\n\r\nOn studying the definitions of these primary, secondary, and tertiary\r\nclasses, it will be found that the largest are marked off from one another\r\nby some attribute which connotes sundry other attributes; that each of the\r\nsmaller classes comprehended in one of these largest classes, is marked off\r\nin a similar way from the other smaller classes bound up with it; and that\r\nso, each successively smaller class has an increased number of co-existing\r\nattributes.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 100. Zoological classification has had a parallel history. The first\r\nattempt which we need notice, to arrange animals in such a way as to\r\ndisplay their affinities, is that of Linnæus. He grouped them thus:[42]--\r\n\r\n  CL. 1. MAMMALIA. _Ord._ Primates, Bruta, Feræ, Glires, Pecora, Belluæ,\r\n  Cete.\r\n\r\n  CL. 2. AVES. _Ord._ Accipitres, Picæ, Anseres, Grallæ, Gallinæ, Passeres.\r\n\r\n  CL. 3. AMPHIBIA. _Ord._ Reptiles, Serpentes, Nantes.\r\n\r\n  CL. 4. PISCES. _Ord._ Apodes, Jugulares, Thoracici, Abdominales.\r\n\r\n  CL. 5. INSECTA. _Ord._ Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, Neuroptera,\r\n  Diptera, Aptera.\r\n\r\n  CL. 6. VERMES. _Ord._ Intestina, Mollusca, Testacea, Lithophyta,\r\n  Zoophyta.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement of classes is obviously based on apparent gradations of\r\nrank; and the placing of the orders similarly betrays an endeavour to make\r\nsuccessions, beginning with the most superior forms and ending with the\r\nmost inferior forms. While the general and vague idea of perfection\r\ndetermines the leading character of the classification, its detailed\r\ngroupings are determined by the most conspicuous external attributes. Not\r\nonly Linnæus but his opponents, who proposed other systems, were \"under the\r\nimpression that animals were to be arranged together into classes, orders,\r\ngenera, and species, according to their more or less close external\r\nresemblance.\" This conception survived until the time of Cuvier.\r\n\"Naturalists,\" says Agassiz, \"were bent upon establishing one continual\r\nuniform series to embrace all animals, between the links of which it was\r\nsupposed there were no unequal intervals. The watchword of their school\r\nwas: _Natura non facit saltum_. They called their system _la chaine des\r\nêtres_.\"\r\n\r\nThe classification of Cuvier, based on internal organization instead of\r\nexternal appearance, was a great advance. He asserted that there are four\r\nprincipal forms, or four general plans, on which animals are constructed;\r\nand, in pursuance of this assertion, he drew out the following scheme.\r\n\r\n  First Branch. ANIMALIA VERTEBRATA.\r\n        Cl. 1. Mammalia.\r\n        Cl. 2. Birds.\r\n        Cl. 3. Reptilia.\r\n        Cl. 4. Fishes.\r\n\r\n  Second Branch. ANIMALIA MOLLUSCA.\r\n        Cl. 1. Cephalapoda.\r\n        Cl. 2. Pteropoda.\r\n        Cl. 3. Gasteropoda.\r\n        Cl. 4. Acephala.\r\n        Cl. 5. Brachiopoda.\r\n        Cl. 6. Cirrhopoda.\r\n\r\n  Third Branch. ANIMALIA ARTICULATA.\r\n        Cl. 1. Annelides.\r\n        Cl. 2. Crustacea.\r\n        Cl. 3. Arachnides.\r\n        Cl. 4. Insects.\r\n\r\n  Fourth Branch. ANIMALIA RADIATA.\r\n        Cl. 1. Echinoderms.\r\n        Cl. 2. Intestinal Worms.\r\n        Cl. 3. Acalephæ.\r\n        Cl. 4. Polypi.\r\n        Cl. 5. Infusoria.\r\n\r\nBut though Cuvier emancipated himself from the conception of a serial\r\nprogression throughout the Animal Kingdom, sundry of his contemporaries and\r\nsuccessors remained fettered by the old error. Less regardful of the\r\ndifferently-combined sets of attributes distinguishing the different\r\nsub-kingdoms, and swayed by the belief in a progressive development which\r\nwas erroneously supposed to imply a linear arrangement of animals, they\r\npersisted in thrusting organic forms into a quite unnatural order. The\r\nfollowing classification of Lamarck illustrates this.\r\n\r\n\r\nINVERTEBRATA.\r\n\r\n  I.  APATHETIC ANIMALS.   }\r\n                           }\r\n    Cl. 1.

Mammalia.        { internal skeleton; form symmetrical,\r\n                             { the parts being in pairs.\r\n\r\nPassing over sundry classifications in which the serial arrangement\r\ndictated by the notion of ascending complexity, is variously modified by\r\nthe recognition of conspicuous anatomical facts, we come to classifications\r\nwhich recognize another order of facts--those of development. The\r\nembryological inquiries of Von Baer led him to arrange animals as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n    I. Peripheric Type. (RADIATA.) _Evolutio radiata._ The development\r\n  proceeds from a centre, producing identical parts in a radiating order.\r\n\r\n   II. Massive Type. (MOLLUSCA.) _Evolutio contorta._ The development\r\n  produces identical parts curved around a conical or other space.\r\n\r\n  III. Longitudinal Type. (ARTICULATA.) _Evolutio gemina._ The development\r\n  produces identical parts arising on both sides of an axis, and closing up\r\n  along a line opposite the axis.\r\n\r\n  IV. Doubly Symmetrical Type. (VERTEBRATA.) _Evolutio bigemina._ The\r\n  development produces identical parts arising on both sides of an axis,\r\n  growing upwards and downwards, and shutting up along two lines, so that\r\n  the inner layer of the germ is inclosed below, and the upper layer above.\r\n  The embryos of these animals have a dorsal cord, dorsal plates, and\r\n  ventral plates, a nervous tube and branchial fissures.\r\n\r\nRecognizing these fundamental differences in the modes of development, as\r\nanswering to fundamental divisions in the animal kingdom, Von Baer shows\r\n(among the _Vertebrata_ at least) how the minor differences which arise at\r\nsuccessively later embryonic stages, correspond with the minor divisions.\r\n\r\nLike the modern classification of plants, the modern classification of\r\nanimals shows us the assumed linear order completely broken up. In his\r\nlectures at the Royal Institution, in 1857, Prof. Huxley expressed the\r\nrelations existing among the several great groups of the animal kingdom, by\r\nplacing them at the ends of four or five radii, diverging from a centre.\r\nThe diagram I cannot obtain; but in the published reports of his lectures\r\nat the School of Mines the groups were arranged as on the following page.\r\nWhat remnant there may seem to be of linear succession in some of the\r\nsub-groups contained in it, is merely an accident of typographical\r\nconvenience. Each of them is to be regarded simply as a cluster. And if\r\nProf. Huxley had further developed the arrangement, by dispersing the\r\nsub-groups and sub-sub-groups on the same principle, there would result an\r\narrangement perhaps not much unlike that shown on the page succeeding this.\r\n\r\n                        VERTEBRATA\r\n\r\n                      (_Abranchiata_)\r\n                          Mammalia\r\n                            Aves\r\n                          Reptilia\r\n                       (_Branchiata_)\r\n                          Amphibia\r\n                           Pisces.\r\n\r\n           MOLLUSCA                             ANNULOSA\r\n\r\n  Cephalopoda  Heteropoda             }       _Articulata._\r\n               Gasteropoda-dioecia    }  Insecta        Arachnida\r\n                                      }  Myriapoda      Crustacea\r\n  { Pulmonata  Gasteropoda-monoecia\r\n  { Pteropoda                                 _Annuloida._\r\n         Lamellibranchiata               Annellata      Scoleidæ\r\n                                         Echinodermata  Trematoda\r\n                                         Rotifera       Tæniadæ\r\n                                                        Turbellaria\r\n                                                        Nematoidea\r\n\r\n                     COELENTERATA\r\n\r\n            Hydrozoa                     Actinozoa.\r\n\r\n                        PROTOZOA\r\n\r\n        Infusoria       Spongiadæ         Gregarinidæ\r\n      _Noctilucidæ_    Foraminifera    _Thallassicollidæ_\r\n\r\nIn the woodcut, the dots represent orders, the names of which it is\r\nimpracticable to insert. If it be supposed that when magnified, each of\r\nthese dots resolves itself into a cluster of clusters, representing genera\r\nand species, an approximate idea will be formed of the relations among the\r\nsuccessively-subordinate groups constituting the animal kingdom. Besides\r\nthe subordination of groups and their general distribution, some other\r\nfacts are indicated. By the distances of the great divisions from the\r\ngeneral centre, are rudely symbolized their respective degrees of\r\ndivergence from the form of simple, undifferentiated organic matter; which\r\nwe may regard as their common source. Within each group, the remoteness\r\nfrom the local centre represents, in a rough way, the degree of departure\r\nfrom the general plan of the group. And the distribution of the sub-groups\r\nwithin each group, is in most cases such that those which come nearest to\r\nneighbouring groups, are those which show the nearest resemblances to\r\nthem--in their analogies though not in their homologies. No such scheme,\r\nhowever, can give a correct conception. Even supposing the above diagram\r\nexpressed the relations of animals to one another as truly as they can be\r\nexpressed on a plane surface (which of course it does not), it would still\r\nbe inadequate. Such relations cannot be represented in space of two\r\ndimensions, but only in space of three dimensions.\r\n\r\n    _Mammalia_\r\n                  _Aves_\r\n           _Reptilia_\r\n\r\n      VERTEBRATA\r\n            \\\r\n   _Amphibia_\\     _Pisces_\r\n              \\\r\n               \\                             _Arachnida_\r\n                \\                   _Insecta_\r\n                 \\                               _Crustacea_\r\n                  \\\r\n                   \\                    Articulata\r\n                    \\                      |\r\n                     \\                     |  _Myriapoda_\r\n                      \\                    |\r\n                       \\               ANNULOSA\r\n                        \\                  |\r\n                         \\                 |_Annelida_\r\n                          \\            _Scolecida_\r\n                           \\               |\r\n                            \\             Annuloida\r\n                             \\             |    /\r\n                              \\         _Echinodermata_\r\n                               \\           |  /\r\n  _Pteropoda_      _Cephalopoda_\\          | |\r\n                   _Gasteropoda dioecia_   | |\r\n     _Gasteropoda monoecia_    _Pulmonata_ | |\r\n                                   \\       | |\r\n          MOLLUSCA-------------     \\      | |\r\n                               \\     \\     | |\r\n    _Lamellibranchiata_         \\     \\    | |\r\n                                 \\     \\   | |\r\n               _Brachiopoda_      \\     \\  | |\r\n                                   \\     \\       _Gregarinida_\r\n             Molluscoida------------\r\n                                 _Rhizopoda_ \\\r\n    _Ascidioida_       _Polyzoa_       /      \\\r\n                                      /    PROTOZOA\r\n                                     /       _Spongida_  _Infusoria_\r\n                         _Hydrozoa_ /\r\n                                   /\r\n                             COELENTERATA\r\n\r\n                         _Actinozoa_\r\n\r\n§ 100a. Two motives have prompted me to include in its original form the\r\nforegoing sketch: the one being that in conformity with the course\r\npreviously pursued, of giving the successive forms of classifications, it\r\nseems desirable to give this form which was approved thirty-odd years ago;\r\nand the other being that the explanatory comments remain now as applicable\r\nas they were then. Replacement of the diagram by one expressing the\r\nrelations of classes as they are now conceived, is by no means an easy\r\ntask; for the conceptions formed of them are unsettled. Concerning the\r\npresent attitude of zoologists, Prof. MacBride writes:--\r\n\r\n  \"They all recognize a certain number of phyla. Each phylum includes a\r\n  group of animals about whose relation to each other no one entertains a\r\n  doubt. Each zoologist, however, has his own idea as to the relationship\r\n  which the various phyla bear to each other.\r\n\r\n  \"The phyla recognized at present are:--\r\n\r\n    (1) Protozoa.\r\n    (2) Porifera (Sponges).\r\n    (3) Coelenterata.\r\n    (4) Echinodermata.\r\n                         { Cestodes.\r\n    (5) Platyhelminthes  { Trematodes.\r\n                         { Turbellaria.\r\n    (6) Nemertea.\r\n    (7) Nematoda.\r\n    (8) Acanthocephala (Echinorhyncus).\r\n    (9) Chætognatha (Sagitta).\r\n    (10) Rotifera.\r\n    (11) Annelida (Includes Leeches and Gephyrea, Chætifera).\r\n    (12) Gephyrea, Achæta.\r\n                     { Tracheata (Peripatus, Myriapods, Insects).\r\n    (13) Arthropods  { Arachnids.\r\n                     { Crustacea.\r\n                     { Pycnogonida.\r\n    (14) Mollusca.\r\n    (15) Polyzoa (Including Phoronis).\r\n    (16) Brachiopoda.\r\n    (17) Chordata (Includes Balanoglossus and Tunicates. Some\r\n            continental zoologists do not admit Balanoglossus).\"\r\n\r\n  [This last phylum of course includes the _Vertebrata_.]\r\n\r\nThough under present conditions, as above implied, it would be absurd to\r\nattempt a definite scheme of relationships, yet it has seemed to me that\r\nthe adumbration of a scheme, presenting in a vague way such relationships\r\nas are generally agreed upon and leaving others indeterminate, may be\r\nventured; and that a general impression hence resulting may be useful. On\r\nthe adjacent page I have tried to make a tentative arrangement of this\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the table I have placed together, under the name \"Compound\r\n_Protozoa_,\" those kinds of aggregated _Protozoa_ which show no\r\ndifferentiations among the members of groups, and are thus distinguished\r\nfrom _Metazoa_; and I have further marked the distinction by their\r\nposition, which implies that from them no evolution of higher types has\r\ntaken place. Respecting the naming of the sub-kingdoms, phyla, classes,\r\norders, &c., I have not maintained entire consistency. The relative values\r\nof groups cannot be typographically expressed in a small space with a\r\nlimited variety of letters. The sizes of the letters mark the\r\nclassificatory ranks, and by the thickness I have rudely indicated their\r\nzoological importance. In fixing the order of subordination of groups I\r\nhave been aided by the table of contents prefixed to Mr. Adam Sedgwick's\r\n_Student's Text Book of Zoology_ and have also made use of Prof. Ray\r\nLankester's classifications of several sub-kingdoms.\r\n\r\n        _Placental_-----+\r\n                        |    _Aves_\r\n          _Mammalia_----+      |                        _Arachnida_\r\n                        |      |                          |\r\n        _Implacental_---+      |             _Insecta_    |   _Crustacea_\r\n                        |      |                      |   |   |\r\n            VERTEBRATA  |      |                      |   |   |\r\n                        |      |                      |   |   |\r\n                     _Reptilia_                       _Chilopoda_\r\n                        |                                     |\r\n                _Amphibia_                       ARTHROPODA   |\r\n                       |                                      |\r\n                       |                              _Diplopoda_\r\n                      _Pisces_                            |\r\n                           |                     _Chætopoda_\r\n       _Cephalochorda_     |                      |\r\n                         CHORDATA             ANNELIDA\r\n       _Urochorda_            |                |    _Echiuroidea_\r\n       _(Tunicata)_           |                |     _Hirudinea_\r\n                              +---------+   _Archiannelida_\r\n                                        |  |\r\n                            BRACHIOPODA |  |   ROTIFERA\r\n    _Dibranchiata_                   |  |  |    |\r\n    _Cephalopoda_                    |  |  +----+\r\n    _Tetrabranchiata_                |  |  |         _Crinoidea_\r\n         MOLLUSCA   ---------------+ |  |  |  +------ ECHINODERMATA\r\n       _Scaphopoda_                | |  |  |  |       _Asteroidea_\r\n       _Solenogastres_             | |  |  |  |       _Echinoidea_\r\n       _Gasteropoda_               | |  |  |  |       _Holothuroidea_\r\n           _Lammellibranchiata_----+ |  |  |  |       _Enteropneusta_\r\n                                   | |  |  |  |\r\n                                   | |  |  |  |          _Acanthocephala_\r\n     POLYZOA --------------------+ | |  |  |  |   +--- NEMATHELMINTHES\r\n                                 | | |  |  |  |   |      _Nematomorpha_\r\n                                 | | |  |  |  |   |      _Nematoda_\r\n                                 | | |  |  |  |   |\r\n\r\n               _Zoantharia_    Ctenophora\r\n             _Rugosa_                   _Acalephos_\r\n           _Alcyonaria_       COELENTERATA     _Hydromedusae_\r\n             Actinozoa                    Hydrozoa      |\r\n                  |                          |          |-------- NEMERTEA\r\n                  |                          |          |\r\n                  |               +----------+     _Turbellaria_\r\n                  ----------------|\r\n                                  |\r\n                              PROTOZOA            PLATYHELMINTHES\r\n                    _Corticata_                            _Trematoda_\r\n                    _Gymnomyxa_                            _Cestoda_\r\n                      |    |\r\n                      |    |\r\n              Myxomycetes  |                          _Triaronia_\r\n                           |    _Vobrocina_                    _Calcarea_\r\n       _Foraminifera_      |                           PORIFERA\r\n                    Compound Protozoa                        _Demospongiae_\r\n                       _Radiolaria_\r\n\r\nLet me again emphasize the fact that the relationships of these diverging\r\nand re-diverging groups cannot be expressed on a flat surface. If we\r\nimagine a laurel-bush to be squashed flat by a horizontal plane descending\r\nupon it, we shall see that sundry of the upper branches and twigs which\r\nwere previously close together will become remote, and that the relative\r\npositions of parts can remain partially true only with the minor branches.\r\nThe reader must therefore expect to find some of the zoological divisions\r\nwhich in the order of nature are near one another, shown in the table as\r\nquite distant.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 101. While the classifications of botanists and zoologists have become\r\nmore and more natural in their arrangements, there has grown up a certain\r\nartificiality in their abstract nomenclature. When aggregating the smallest\r\ngroups into larger groups and these into groups still larger, they have\r\nadopted certain general terms expressive of the successively more\r\ncomprehensive divisions; and the habitual use of these terms, needful for\r\npurposes of convenience, has led to the tacit assumption that they answer\r\nto actualities in Nature. It has been taken for granted that species,\r\ngenera, orders, and classes, are assemblages of definite values--that every\r\ngenus is the equivalent of every other genus in respect of its degree of\r\ndistinctness; and that orders are separated by lines of demarcation which\r\nare as broad in one place as another. Though this conviction is not a\r\nformulated one, the disputes continually occurring among naturalists on the\r\nquestions, whether such and such organisms are specifically or generically\r\ndistinct, and whether this or that peculiarity is or is not of ordinal\r\nimportance, imply that the conviction is entertained even where not avowed.\r\nYet that differences of opinion like these arise and remain unsettled,\r\nexcept when they end in the establishment of sub-species, sub-genera,\r\nsub-orders, and sub-classes, sufficiently shows that the conviction is\r\nill-based. And this is equally shown by the impossibility of obtaining any\r\ndefinition of the degree of difference which warrants each further\r\nelevation in the hierarchy of classes.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, a wholly gratuitous assumption that organisms admit of being\r\nplaced in groups of equivalent values; and that these may be united into\r\nlarger groups which are also of equivalent values; and so on. There is no\r\n_à priori_ reason for expecting this; and there is no _à posteriori_\r\nevidence implying it, save that which begs the question--that which asserts\r\none distinction to be generic and another to be ordinal, because it is\r\nassumed that such distinctions must be either generic or ordinal. The\r\nendeavour to thrust plants and animals into these definite partitions is of\r\nthe same nature as the endeavour to thrust them into linear series. Not\r\nthat it does violence to the facts in anything like the same degree; but\r\nstill, it does violence to the facts. Doubtless the making of divisions and\r\nsub-divisions, is extremely useful; or rather, it is necessary. Doubtless,\r\ntoo, in reducing the facts to something like order they must be partially\r\ndistorted. So long as the distorted form is not mistaken for the actual\r\nform, no harm results. But it is needful for us to remember that while our\r\nsuccessively subordinate groups have a certain general correspondence with\r\nthe realities, they tacitly ascribe to the realities a regularity which\r\ndoes not exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 102. A general truth of much significance is exhibited in these\r\nclassifications. On observing the natures of the attributes which are\r\ncommon to the members of any group of the first, second, third, or fourth\r\nrank, we see that groups of the widest generality are based on characters\r\nof the greatest importance, physiologically considered; and that the\r\ncharacters of the successively-subordinate groups, are characters of\r\nsuccessively-subordinate importance. The structural peculiarity in which\r\nall members of one sub-kingdom differ from all members of another\r\nsub-kingdom, is a peculiarity that affects the vital actions more\r\nprofoundly than does the structural peculiarity which distinguishes all\r\nmembers of one class from all members of another class. Let us look at a\r\nfew cases.\r\n\r\nWe saw (§ 56), that the broadest division among the functions is the\r\ndivision into \"the _accumulation of energy_ (latent in food); the\r\n_expenditure of energy_ (latent in the tissues and certain matters absorbed\r\nby them); and the _transfer of energy_ (latent in the prepared nutriment or\r\nblood) from the parts which accumulate to the parts which expend.\" Now in\r\nthe lowest animals, united under the general name _Protozoa_, there is\r\neither no separation of the parts performing these functions or very\r\nindistinct separation: in the _Rhizopoda_, all parts are alike accumulators\r\nof energy, expenders of energy and transferers of energy; and though in the\r\nhigher members of the group, the _Infusoria_, there are some\r\nspecializations corresponding to these functions, yet there are no distinct\r\ntissues appropriated to them. Similarly when we pass from simple types to\r\ncompound types--from _Protozoa_ to _Metazoa_. The animals known as\r\n_Coelenterata_ are characterized in common by the possession of a part\r\nwhich accumulates energy more or less marked off from the part which does\r\nnot accumulate energy, but only expends it; and the _Hydrozoa_ and\r\n_Actinozoa_, which are sub-divisions of the _Coelenterata_, are contrasted\r\nin this, that in the second these parts are much more differentiated from\r\none another, as well as more complicated. Besides a completer\r\ndifferentiation of the organs respectively devoted to the accumulation of\r\nenergy and the expenditure of energy, animals next above the _Coelenterata_\r\npossess rude appliances for the transfer of energy: the peri-visceral sac,\r\nor closed cavity between the intestine and the walls of the body, serves as\r\na reservoir of absorbed nutriment, from which the surrounding tissues take\r\nup the materials they need. And then out of this sac originates a more\r\nefficient appliance for the transfer of energy: the more highly-organized\r\nanimals, belonging to whichever sub-kingdom, all of them possess\r\ndefinitely-constructed channels for distributing the matters containing\r\nenergy. In all of them, too, the function of expenditure is divided between\r\na directive apparatus and an executive apparatus--a nervous system and a\r\nmuscular system. But these higher sub-kingdoms are clearly separated from\r\none another by differences in the relative positions of their component\r\nsets of organs. The habitual attitudes of annulose and molluscous\r\ncreatures, is such that the neural centres are below the alimentary canal\r\nand the hæmal centres above. And while by these traits the annulose and\r\nmolluscous types are separated from the vertebrate, they are separated from\r\neach other by this, that in the one the body is \"composed of successive\r\nsegments, usually provided with limbs,\" but in the other, the body is not\r\nsegmented, \"and no true articulated limbs are ever developed.\"\r\n\r\nThe sub-kingdoms being thus distinguished from one another, by the presence\r\nor absence of specialized parts devoted to fundamental functions, or else\r\nby differences in the distributions of such parts, we find, on descending\r\nto the classes, that these are distinguished from one another, either by\r\nmodifications in the structures of fundamental parts, or by the presence or\r\nabsence of subsidiary parts, or by both. Fishes and _Amphibia_ are unlike\r\nhigher vertebrates in possessing branchiæ, either throughout life or early\r\nin life. And every higher vertebrate, besides having lungs, is\r\ncharacterized by having, during development, an amnion and an allantois.\r\nMammals, again, are marked off from Birds and Reptiles by the presence of\r\nmammæ, as well as by the form of the occipital condyles. Among Mammals, the\r\nnext division is based on the presence or absence of a placenta. And\r\ndivisions of the _Placentalia_ are mainly determined by the characters of\r\nthe organs of external action.\r\n\r\nThus, without multiplying illustrations and without descending to genera\r\nand species, we see that, speaking generally, the successively smaller\r\ngroups are distinguished from one another by traits of successively less\r\nimportance, physiologically considered. The attributes possessed in common\r\nby the largest assemblages of organisms, are few in number but\r\nall-essential in kind.  Each secondary assemblage, included in one of the\r\nprimary assemblages, is characterized by further common attributes that\r\ninfluence the functions less profoundly. And so on with each lower grade.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 103. What interpretation is to be put on these truths of classification?\r\nWe find that organic forms admit of an arrangement everywhere indicating\r\nthe fact, that along with certain attributes, certain other attributes,\r\nwhich are not directly connected with them, always exist. How are we to\r\naccount for this fact? And how are we to account for the fact that the\r\nattributes possessed in common by the largest assemblages of forms, are the\r\nmost vitally-important attributes?\r\n\r\nNo one can believe that combinations of this kind have arisen fortuitously.\r\nEven supposing fortuitous combinations of attributes might produce\r\norganisms that would work, we should still be without a clue to this\r\nspecial mode of combination. The chances would be infinity to one against\r\norganisms which possessed in common certain fundamental attributes, having\r\nalso in common numerous non-essential attributes.\r\n\r\nNor, again, can any one allege that such combinations are necessary, in the\r\nsense that all other combinations are impracticable. There is not, in the\r\nnature of things, a reason why creatures covered with feathers should\r\nalways have beaks: jaws carrying teeth would, in many cases, have served\r\nthem equally well or better. The most general characteristic of an entire\r\nsub-kingdom, equal in extent to the _Vertebrata_, might have been the\r\npossession of nictitating membranes; while the internal organizations\r\nthroughout this sub-kingdom might have been on many different plans.\r\n\r\nIf, as an alternative, this peculiar subordination of traits which organic\r\nforms display be ascribed to design, other difficulties suggest themselves.\r\nTo suppose that a certain plan of organization was fixed on by a Creator\r\nfor each vast and varied group, the members of which were to have many\r\ndifferent modes of life, and that he bound himself to adhere rigidly to\r\nthis plan, even in the most aberrant forms of the group where some other\r\nplan would have been more appropriate, is to ascribe a very strange motive.\r\nWhen we discover that the possession of seven cervical vertebræ is a\r\ngeneral characteristic of mammals, whether the neck be immensely long as in\r\nthe giraffe, or quite rudimentary as in the whale, shall we say that\r\nthough, for the whale's neck, one vertebra would have been equally good,\r\nand though, for the giraffe's neck, a dozen would probably have been better\r\nthan seven, yet seven was the number adhered to in both cases, because\r\nseven was fixed upon for the mammalian type? And then, when it turns out\r\nthat this possession of seven cervical vertebræ is not an\r\nabsolutely-universal characteristic of mammals (there is one which has\r\neight), shall we conclude that while, in a host of cases, there was a\r\nneedless adherence to a plan for the sake of consistency, there was yet, in\r\nsome cases, an inconsistent abandonment of the plan? I think we may\r\nproperly refuse to draw any such conclusion.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the meaning of these peculiar relations of organic forms?\r\nThe answer to this question must be postponed. Having here contemplated the\r\nproblem as presented in these wide inductions which naturalists have\r\nreached; and having seen what proposed solutions of it are inadmissible; we\r\nshall see, in the next division of this work, what is the only possible\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 104. There is a distribution of organisms in Space, and there is a\r\ndistribution of organisms in Time. Looking first at their distribution in\r\nSpace, we observe in it two different classes of facts. On the one hand,\r\nthe plants and animals of each species have their habitats limited by\r\nexternal conditions: they are necessarily restricted to spaces in which\r\ntheir vital actions can be performed. On the other hand, the existence of\r\ncertain conditions does not determine the presence of organisms that are\r\nfit for them. There are many spaces perfectly adapted for life of a high\r\norder in which only life of a much lower order is found.\r\n\r\nWhile, in the inevitable restriction of organisms to environments with\r\nwhich their natures correspond we find a _negative_ cause of distribution,\r\nthere remains to be found that _positive_ cause whence results the presence\r\nof organisms in some places appropriate to them and their absence from\r\nother places equally appropriate or more appropriate. Let us consider the\r\nphenomena as thus classed.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 105. Facts which illustrate the limiting influence of surrounding\r\nconditions are abundant, and familiar to all readers. It will be needful,\r\nhowever, here to cite a few typical ones of each order.\r\n\r\nThe confinement of different kinds of plants and different kinds of\r\nanimals, to the media for which they are severally adapted, is the broadest\r\nfact of distribution. We have extensive groups of plants that are\r\nrespectively sub-aerial and sub-aqueous; and of the sub-aqueous some are\r\nexclusively marine, while others exist only in rivers and lakes. Among\r\nanimals we similarly find some classes confined to the air and others to\r\nthe water; and of the water-breathers some are restricted to salt water and\r\nothers to fresh water. Less conspicuous is the fact that within each of\r\nthese contrasted media there are further widespread limitations. In the\r\nsea, certain organisms exist only between certain depths, and others only\r\nbetween other depths--the limpet and the mussel within the littoral zone,\r\nand numerous kinds at the bottom of the ocean; and on the land, there are\r\nFloras and Faunas peculiar to low regions and others peculiar to high\r\nregions. Next we have the familiar geographical limitations made by\r\nclimate. There are temperatures which restrict each kind of organism\r\nbetween certain isothermal lines, and hygrometric states which prevent the\r\nspread of each kind of organism beyond areas having a certain humidity or a\r\ncertain dryness. Besides such general limitations we find much more special\r\nlimitations. Some minute vegetal forms occur only in snow. Hot springs have\r\ntheir peculiar _Infusoria_. The habitats of certain Fungi are mines or\r\nother dark places. And there are creatures unknown beyond the water\r\ncontained in particular caves. After these limits to distribution imposed\r\nby physical conditions, come limits imposed by the presence or absence of\r\nother organisms. Obviously, graminivorous animals are confined within\r\ntracts which produce plants fit for them to feed on. The great carnivores\r\ncannot exist out of regions where there are creatures large enough and\r\nnumerous enough to serve for prey. The needs of the sloth limit it to\r\ncertain forest-covered spaces; and there can be no insectivorous bats where\r\nthere are no night-flying insects. To these dependences of the\r\nrelatively-superior organisms on the relatively-inferior organisms which\r\nthey consume, must be added certain reciprocal dependences of the inferior\r\non the superior. Mr. Darwin's inquiries have shown how generally the\r\nfertilization of plants is due to the agency of insects, and how certain\r\nplants, being fertilizable only by insects of certain structures, are\r\nlimited to regions inhabited by insects of such structures. Conversely, the\r\nspread of organisms is often bounded by the presence of particular\r\norganisms beyond the bounds--either competing organisms or organisms\r\ndirectly inimical. A plant fit for some territory adjacent to its own,\r\nfails to overrun it because the territory is pre-occupied by some plant\r\nwhich is its superior, either in fertility or power of resisting\r\ndestructive agencies; or else fails because there lives in the territory\r\nsome mammal which browses on its foliage or bird which devours nearly all\r\nits seeds. Similarly, an area in which animals of a particular species\r\nmight thrive, is not colonized by them because they are not fleet enough to\r\nescape some beast of prey inhabiting this area, or because the area is\r\ninfested by some insect which destroys them, as the tsetse destroys the\r\ncattle in parts of Africa. Yet another more special series of limitations\r\naccompanies parasitism. There are parasitic plants that flourish only on\r\ntrees of some few species, and others that have particular animals for\r\ntheir habitats--as the fungus which is fatal to the silk-worm, or that\r\nwhich so strangely grows out of a New Zealand caterpillar. Of\r\nanimal-parasites various kinds lead lives involving specialities of\r\ndistribution. We have kinds which use other creatures for purposes of\r\nlocomotion, as the _Chelonobia_ uses the turtle, and as a certain _Actinia_\r\nuses the shell inhabited by a hermit-crab. We have the parasitism in which\r\none creature habitually accompanies another to share its prey, like the\r\nannelid which takes up its abode in a hermit-crab's shell, and snatches\r\nfrom the hermit-crab the morsels of food it is eating. We have again the\r\ncommoner parasitism of the _Epizoa_--animals which attach themselves to the\r\nsurfaces of other animals, and feed on their juices or on their secretions.\r\nAnd once more, we have the equally common parasitism of the\r\n_Entozoa_--creatures which live within other creatures. Besides being\r\nrestricted to the bodies of the organisms it infests, each species has\r\nusually still narrower limits of distribution; in some cases the infested\r\norganisms furnish fit habitats for the parasites only in certain regions,\r\nand in other cases only when in certain constitutional states. There are\r\nmore indirect modes in which the distributions of organisms affect one\r\nanother. Plants of some kinds are eaten by animals only in the absence of\r\nkinds that are preferred to them; and hence the prosperity of such plants\r\npartly depends on the presence of the preferred plants. Mr. Bates has shown\r\nthat some South American butterflies thrive in regions where insectivorous\r\nbirds would destroy them, did they not closely resemble butterflies of\r\nanother genus which are disliked by those birds. And Mr. Darwin gives cases\r\nof dependence still more remote and involved.\r\n\r\nSuch are the chief negative causes of distribution--the inorganic and\r\norganic agencies that set bounds to the spaces which organisms of each\r\nspecies inhabit. Fully to understand their actions we must contemplate them\r\nas working not separately but in concert. We have to regard the physical\r\ninfluences, varying from year to year, as now producing an extension or\r\nrestriction of the habitat in this direction and now in that, and as\r\nproducing secondary extensions and restrictions by their effects on other\r\nkinds of organisms. We have to regard the distribution of each species as\r\naffected not only by causes which favour multiplication of prey or of\r\nenemies within its own area, but also by causes which produce such results\r\nin neighbouring areas. We have to conceive the forces by which the limit is\r\nmaintained, as including all meteorologic influences, united with the\r\ninfluences, direct or remote, of numerous co-existing species.\r\n\r\nOne general truth, indicated by sundry of the above illustrations, calls\r\nfor special notice--the truth that all kinds of organisms intrude on one\r\nanother's spheres of existence. Of the ways in which they do this the\r\ncommonest is invasion of territory. That tendency which we see in the human\r\nraces, to overrun and occupy one another's lands, as well as the lands\r\ninhabited by inferior creatures, is a tendency exhibited by all classes of\r\norganisms in various ways. Among them, as among mankind, there are\r\npermanent conquests, temporary occupations, and occasional raids. Every\r\nspring an inroad is made into the area which our own birds occupy, by birds\r\nfrom the South; and every winter the fieldfares of the North come to share\r\nthe hips and haws of our hedges, and thus entail on our native birds some\r\nmortality. Besides these regularly-recurring incursions there are irregular\r\nones; as of locusts into countries not usually visited by them, or of\r\ncertain rodents which from time to time swarm into areas adjacent to their\r\nown. Every now and then an incursion ends in permanent settlement--perhaps\r\nin conquest over indigenous species. Within these few years an American\r\nwater-weed has taken possession of our ponds and rivers, and to some extent\r\nsupplanted native water-weeds. Of animals may be named a small kind of red\r\nant, having habits allied to those of tropical ants, which has of late\r\noverrun many houses in London. The rat, which must have taken to infesting\r\nships within these few centuries, furnishes a good illustration of the\r\nreadiness of animals to occupy new places that are available. And the way\r\nin which vessels visiting India are cleared of the European cockroach by\r\nthe kindred _Blatta orientalis_, shows us how these successful invasions\r\nlast only until there come more powerful invaders. Animals encroach on one\r\nanother's spheres of existence in further ways than by trespassing on one\r\nanother's areas: they adopt one another's modes of life. There are cases in\r\nwhich this usurpation of habits is slight and temporary; and there are\r\ncases where it is marked and permanent. Grey crows often join gulls in\r\npicking up food between tide-marks; and gulls may occasionally be seen many\r\nmiles inland, feeding in ploughed fields and on moors. Mr. Darwin has\r\nwatched a fly-catcher catching fish. He says that the greater titmouse\r\nsometimes adopts the practices of the shrike, and sometimes of the\r\nnuthatch, and that some South American woodpeckers are frugivorous while\r\nothers chase insects on the wing. Of habitual intrusions on the occupations\r\nof other creatures, one case is furnished by the sea-eagle, which, besides\r\nhunting the surface of the land for prey, like the rest of the hawk-tribe,\r\noften swoops down upon fish. And Mr. Darwin names a species of petrel that\r\nhas taken to diving, and has a considerably modified organization.  The\r\nlast cases introduce a still more remarkable class of facts of kindred\r\nmeaning. This intrusion of organisms on one another's modes of life goes to\r\nthe extent of intruding on one another's media. The great mass of flowering\r\nplants are terrestrial, and (aside from other needs) are required to be so\r\nby their process of fructification. But there are some which live in the\r\nwater, and protrude their flowers above the surface. Nay, there is a still\r\nmore striking instance. At the sea-side may be found an alga a hundred\r\nyards inland, and a phænogam rooted in salt water. Among animals these\r\ninterchanges of media are numerous. Nearly all coleopterous insects are\r\nterrestrial; but the water-beetle, which like the rest of its order is an\r\nair-breather, has aquatic habits. Water appears to be an extremely unfit\r\nmedium for a fly; and yet Mr. [now Sir John] Lubbock has discovered more\r\nthan one species of fly living beneath the surface of the water and coming\r\nup occasionally for air. Birds, as a class, are specially fitted for an\r\naerial existence; but certain tribes of them have taken to an aquatic\r\nexistence--swimming on the surface of the water and making continual\r\nincursions beneath it, and some kinds have wholly lost the power of flight.\r\nAmong mammals, too, which have limbs and lungs implying an organization for\r\nterrestrial life, may be named kinds living more or less in the water and\r\nare more or less adapted to it. We have water-rats and otters which unite\r\nthe two kinds of life, and show but little modification; hippopotami\r\npassing the greater part of their time in the water, and somewhat more\r\nfitted to it; seals living almost exclusively in the sea, and having the\r\nmammalian form greatly obscured; whales wholly confined to the sea, and\r\nhaving so little the aspect of mammals as to be mistaken for fish.\r\nConversely, sundry inhabitants of the water make excursions on the land.\r\nEels migrate at night from one pool to another. There are fish with\r\nspecially-modified gills and fin-rays serving as stilts, which, when the\r\nrivers they inhabit are partially dried-up, travel in search of better\r\nquarters. And while some kinds of crabs do not make land-excursions beyond\r\nhigh-water mark, other kinds pursue lives almost wholly terrestrial.\r\n\r\nGuided by these two classes of facts, we must regard the bounds to each\r\nspecies' sphere of existence as determined by the balancing of two\r\nantagonist sets of forces. The tendency which every species has to intrude\r\non other areas, other modes of life, and other media, is restrained by the\r\ndirect and indirect resistance of conditions, organic and inorganic. And\r\nthese expansive and repressive energies, varying continually in their\r\nrespective intensities, rhythmically equilibrate each other--maintain a\r\nlimit that perpetually oscillates from side to side of a certain mean.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 106. As implied at the outset, the character of a region, when\r\nunfavourable to any species, sufficiently accounts for the absence of this\r\nspecies; and thus its absence is not inconsistent with the hypothesis that\r\neach species was originally placed in the regions most favourable to it.\r\nBut the absence of a species from regions that _are_ favourable to it\r\ncannot be thus accounted for. Were plants and animals localized wholly with\r\nreference to the fitness of their constitutions to surrounding conditions,\r\nwe might expect Floras to be similar, and Faunas to be similar, where the\r\nconditions are similar; and we might expect dissimilarities among Floras\r\nand among Faunas, proportionate to the dissimilarities of their conditions.\r\nBut we do not find such anticipations verified.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin says that \"in the Southern hemisphere, if we compare large\r\ntracts of land in Australia, South Africa, and western South America,\r\nbetween latitudes 25° and 35°, we shall find parts extremely similar in all\r\ntheir conditions, yet it would not be possible to point out three faunas\r\nand floras more utterly dissimilar. Or again we may compare the productions\r\nof South America south of lat. 35° with those north of 25°, which\r\nconsequently inhabit a considerably different climate, and they will be\r\nfound incomparably more closely related to each other, than they are to the\r\nproductions of Australia or Africa under nearly the same climate.\" Still\r\nmore striking are the contrasts which Mr. Darwin points out between\r\nadjacent areas that are totally cut off from each other. \"No two marine\r\nfaunas are more distinct, with hardly a fish, shell, or crab in common,\r\nthan those of the eastern and western shores of South and Central America;\r\nyet these great faunas are separated only by the narrow, but impassable,\r\nisthmus of Panama.\" On opposite sides of high mountain-chains, also, there\r\nare marked differences in the organic forms--differences not so marked as\r\nwhere the barriers are absolutely impassable, but much more marked than are\r\nnecessitated by unlikenesses of physical conditions.\r\n\r\nNot less suggestive is the converse fact that wide geographical areas which\r\noffer decided geologic and meteorologic contrasts, are peopled by\r\nnearly-allied groups of organisms, if there are no barriers to migration.\r\n\"The naturalist in travelling, for instance, from north to south never\r\nfails to be struck by the manner in which successive groups of beings,\r\nspecifically distinct, yet clearly related, replace each other. He hears\r\nfrom closely allied, yet distinct kinds of birds, notes nearly similar, and\r\nsees their nests similarly constructed, but not quite alike, with eggs\r\ncoloured in nearly the same manner. The plains near the Straits of Magellan\r\nare inhabited by one species of Rhea (American Ostrich), and northward the\r\nplains of La Plata by another species of the same genus; and not by a true\r\nostrich or emu, like those found in Africa and Australia under the same\r\nlatitude. On these same plains of La Plata, we see the agouti and bizcacha,\r\nanimals having nearly the same habits as our hares and rabbits and\r\nbelonging to the same order of Rodents, but they plainly display an\r\nAmerican type of structure. We ascend the lofty peaks of the Cordillera and\r\nwe find an alpine species of bizcacha; we look to the waters, and we do not\r\nfind the beaver or musk-rat, but the coypu and capybara, rodents of the\r\nAmerican type. Innumerable other instances could be given. If we look to\r\nthe islands off the American shore, however much they may differ in\r\ngeological structure, the inhabitants, though they may be all peculiar\r\nspecies, are essentially American.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is the generalization implied by these two groups of facts? On the one\r\nhand, we have similarly-conditioned, and sometimes nearly-adjacent, areas,\r\noccupied by quite different Faunas. On the one hand, we have areas remote\r\nfrom one another in latitude, and contrasted in soil as well as climate,\r\noccupied by closely-allied Faunas. Clearly then, as like organisms are not\r\nuniversally, or even generally, found in like habitats, nor very unlike\r\norganisms in very unlike habitats, there is no manifest pre-determined\r\nadaptation of the organisms to the habitats. The organisms do no occur in\r\nsuch and such places solely because they are either specially fit for those\r\nplaces, or more fit for them than all other organisms.\r\n\r\nThe induction under which these facts come, and which unites them with\r\nvarious other facts, is a totally-different one. When we see that the\r\nsimilar areas peopled by dissimilar forms, are those between which there\r\nare impassable barriers; while the dissimilar areas peopled by similar\r\nforms, are those between which there are no such barriers; we are at once\r\nreminded of the general truth exemplified in the last section--the truth\r\nthat each species of organism tends ever to expand its sphere of\r\nexistence--to intrude on other areas, other modes of life, other media. And\r\nwe are shown that through these perpetually-recurring attempts to thrust\r\nitself into every accessible habitat, each species spreads until it reaches\r\nlimits which are for the time insurmountable.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 107. We pass now to the distribution of organic forms in Time. Geological\r\ninquiry has established the truth that during a Past of immeasurable\r\nduration, plants and animals have existed on the Earth. In all countries\r\ntheir buried remains are found in greater or less abundance. From\r\ncomparatively small areas multitudinous different types have been exhumed.\r\nEvery exploration of new areas, and every closer inspection of areas\r\nalready explored, brings more types to light. And beyond question, an\r\nexhaustive examination of all exposed strata, and of all strata now covered\r\nby the sea, would disclose types immensely out-numbering those at present\r\nknown. Further, geologists agree that even had we before us every kind of\r\nfossil which exists, we should still have nothing like a complete index to\r\nthe past inhabitants of our globe. Many sedimentary deposits have been so\r\naltered by the heat of adjacent molten matter, as greatly to obscure the\r\norganic remains contained in them. The extensive formations once called\r\n\"transition,\" and now re-named \"metamorphic,\" are acknowledged to be\r\nformations of sedimentary origin, from which all traces of such fossils as\r\nthey probably included have been obliterated by igneous action. And the\r\naccepted conclusion is that igneous rock has everywhere resulted from the\r\nmelting-up of beds of detritus originally deposited by water. How long the\r\nreactions of the Earth's molten nucleus on its cooling crust, have been\r\nthus destroying the records of Life, it is impossible to say; but there are\r\nstrong reasons for believing that the records which remain bear but a small\r\nratio to the records which have been destroyed. Thus we have but extremely\r\nimperfect data for conclusions respecting the distribution of organic forms\r\nin Time. Some few generalizations, however, may be regarded as established.\r\n\r\nOne is that the plants and animals now existing mostly differ from the\r\nplants and animals which have existed. Though there are species common to\r\nour present Fauna and to past Faunas, yet the _facies_ of our present Fauna\r\ndiffers, more or less, from the _facies_ of each past Fauna. On carrying\r\nout the comparison, we find that past Faunas differ from one another, and\r\nthat the differences between them are proportionate to their degrees of\r\nremoteness from one another in Time, as measured by their relative\r\npositions in the sedimentary series. So that if we take the assemblage of\r\norganic forms living now, and compare it with the successive assemblages of\r\norganic forms which have lived in successive geologic epochs, we find that\r\nthe farther we go back into the past, the greater does the unlikeness\r\nbecome. The number of species and genera common to the compared\r\nassemblages, becomes smaller and smaller; and the assemblages differ more\r\nand more in their general characters. Though a species of brachiopod now\r\nextant is almost identical with a species found in Silurian strata, though\r\nbetween the Silurian Fauna and our own there are sundry common genera of\r\nmolluscs, yet it is undeniable that there is a proportion between lapse of\r\ntime and divergence of organic forms.\r\n\r\nThis divergence is comparatively slow and continuous where there is\r\ncontinuity in the geological formations, but is sudden, and comparatively\r\nwide, wherever there occurs a great break in the succession of strata. The\r\ncontrasts which thus arise, gradually or all at once, in formations that\r\nare continuous or discontinuous, are of two kinds. Faunas of different eras\r\nare distinguished partly by the absence from the one of type's present in\r\nthe other, and partly by the unlikenesses between the types common to both.\r\nSuch contrasts between Faunas as are due to the appearance or disappearance\r\nof types, are of secondary significance: they possibly, or probably, do not\r\nimply anything more than migrations or extinctions. The most significant\r\ncontrasts are those between successive groups of organisms of the same\r\ntype. And among such, as above said, the differences are, speaking\r\ngenerally, small and continuous where a series of conformable strata gives\r\nproof of continued existence of the type in the locality; while they are\r\ncomparatively large and abrupt where the adjacent formations are shown to\r\nhave been separated by long intervals.\r\n\r\nAnother general fact, referred to by Mr. Darwin as one which palæontology\r\nhas made tolerably certain, is that forms and groups of forms which have\r\nonce disappeared from the Earth, do not reappear. Passing over the few\r\nspecies which have continued throughout the whole period geologically\r\nrecorded, it may be said that each species after arising, spreading for an\r\nera, and continuing abundant for an era, eventually declines and becomes\r\nextinct; and that similarly, each genus during a longer period increases in\r\nthe number of its species, and during a longer period dwindles and at last\r\ndies out. After making its exit neither species nor genus ever re-enters.\r\nThe like is true even of those larger groups called orders. Four types of\r\nreptiles which were once abundant have not been found in modern formations,\r\nand do not at present exist. Though nothing less than an exhaustive\r\nexamination of all strata, can prove conclusively that a type of\r\norganization when once lost is never reproduced, yet so many facts point to\r\nthis inference that its truth can scarcely be doubted.\r\n\r\nTo frame a conception of the total amount and general direction of the\r\nchange in organic forms during the time measured by our sedimentary series,\r\nis at present impossible--the data are insufficient. The immense contrast\r\nbetween the few and low forms of the earliest-known Fauna, and the many and\r\nhigh forms of our existing Fauna, has been commonly supposed to prove, not\r\nonly great change but great progress. Nevertheless, this appearance of\r\nprogress may be, and probably is, mainly illusive. Wider knowledge has\r\nshown that remains of comparatively well-organized creatures really existed\r\nin strata long supposed to be devoid of them, and that where they are\r\nabsent, the nature of the strata often explains their absence, without\r\nassuming that they did not exist when these strata were formed.  It is a\r\ntenable hypothesis that the successively-higher types fossilized in our\r\nsuccessively-later deposits, indicate nothing more than successive\r\nmigrations from pre-existing continents to continents that were step by\r\nstep emerging from the ocean--migrations which necessarily began with the\r\ninferior orders of organisms, and included the successively-superior orders\r\nas the new lands became more accessible to them and better fitted for\r\nthem.[43]\r\n\r\nWhile the evidence usually supposed to prove progression is thus\r\nuntrustworthy, there is trustworthy evidence that there has been, in many\r\ncases, little or no progression. Though the orders which have existed from\r\npalæozoic and mesozoic times down to the present day, are almost\r\nuniversally changed, yet a comparison of ancient and modern members of\r\nthese orders shows that the total amount of change is not relatively great,\r\nand that it is not manifestly towards a higher organization. Though nearly\r\nall the living forms which have prototypes in early formations differ from\r\nthese prototypes specially, and in most cases generically, yet ordinal\r\npeculiarities are, in numerous cases, maintained from the earliest times\r\ngeologically recorded, down to our own time; and we have no visible\r\nevidence of superiority in the existing genera of these orders. In his\r\nlecture \"On the Persistent Types of Animal Life,\" Prof. Huxley enumerated\r\nmany cases. On the authority of Dr. Hooker he stated \"that there are\r\nCarboniferous plants which appear to be generically identical with some now\r\nliving: that the cone of the Oolitic _Araucaria_ is hardly distinguishable\r\nfrom that of an existing species; that a true _Pinus_ appears in the\r\nPurbecks and a _Juglans_ in the chalk.\" Among animals he named palæozoic\r\nand mesozoic corals which are very like certain extant corals; genera of\r\nSilurian molluscs that answer to existing genera; insects and arachnids in\r\nthe coal-formations that are not more than generically distinct from some\r\nof our own insects and arachnids. He instanced \"the Devonian and\r\nCarboniferous _Pleuracanthus_, which differs no more from existing sharks\r\nthan these do from one another;\" early mesozoic reptiles \"identical in the\r\nessential characters of their organization with those now living;\" and\r\nTriassic mammals which did not differ \"nearly so much from some of those\r\nwhich now live, as these differ from one another.\" Continuing the argument\r\nin his \"Anniversary Address to the Geological Society\" in 1862, Prof.\r\nHuxley gave many cases in which the changes that have taken place, are not\r\nchanges towards a more specialized or higher organization--asking \"in what\r\nsense are the Liassic Chelonia inferior to those which now exist? How are\r\nthe Cretaceous Ichthyosauria, Plesiosauria, or Pterosauria less embryonic\r\nor more differentiated species than those of the Lias?\" While, however,\r\ncontending that in most instances \"positive evidence fails to demonstrate\r\nany sort of progressive modification towards a less embryonic or less\r\ngeneralized type in a great many groups of animals of long-continued\r\ngeological existence,\" Prof. Huxley added that there are other groups,\r\n\"co-existing with them under the same conditions, in which more or less\r\ndistinct indications of such a process seem to be traceable.\" And in\r\nillustration of this, he named that better development of the vertebræ\r\nwhich characterizes some of the more modern fishes and reptiles, when\r\ncompared with ancient fishes and reptiles of the same orders; and the\r\n\"regularity and evenness of the dentition of the _Anoplotherium_ as\r\ncontrasting with that of existing Artiodactyles.\"[44]\r\n\r\nThe facts thus summed up do not show that higher forms have not arisen in\r\nthe course of geologic time, any more than the facts commonly cited prove\r\nthat higher forms have arisen; nor are they regarded by Professor Huxley as\r\nshowing this. Were those which have survived from palæozoic and mesozoic\r\ndays down to our own day, the only types; and did the modifications, rarely\r\nof more than generic value, which these types have undergone, give no\r\nbetter evidences of increased complexity than are actually given by them;\r\nthen it would be inferable that there has been no appreciable advance. But\r\nthere now exist, and have existed during the more recent geologic epochs,\r\nvarious types which are not known to have existed in earlier epochs--some\r\nof them widely unlike these persistent types and some of them nearly allied\r\nto these persistent types. As yet, we know nothing about the origins of\r\nthese new types. But it is possible that causes like those which have\r\nproduced generic differences in the persistent types, have, in some or many\r\ncases, produced modifications great enough to constitute ordinal\r\ndifferences. If structural contrasts not exceeding certain moderate limits\r\nare held to mark only generic distinctions; and if organisms displaying\r\nlarger contrasts are regarded as ordinally or typically distinct; it is\r\nobvious that the persistence of a given type through a long geologic period\r\nwithout apparently undergoing deviations of more than generic value, by no\r\nmeans disproves the occurrence of far greater deviations in other cases;\r\nsince the forms resulting from such far greater deviations, being regarded\r\nas typically distinct forms, will not be taken as evidence of great change\r\nin an original type. That which Prof. Huxley's argument proves, and that\r\nonly which he considers it to prove, is that organisms have no innate\r\ntendencies to assume higher forms; and that \"any admissible hypothesis of\r\nprogressive modification, must be compatible with persistence without\r\nprogression through indefinite periods.\"\r\n\r\nOne very significant fact must be added concerning the relation between\r\ndistribution in Time and distribution in Space. I quote it from Mr.\r\nDarwin:--\"Mr. Clift many years ago showed that the fossil mammals from the\r\nAustralian caves were closely allied to the living marsupials of that\r\ncontinent. In South America a similar relationship is manifest, even to an\r\nuneducated eye, in the gigantic pieces of armour like those of the\r\narmadillo, found in several parts of La Plata; and Professor Owen has shown\r\nin the most striking manner that most of the fossil mammals, buried there\r\nin such numbers, are related to the South American types. This relationship\r\nis even more clearly seen in the wonderland collection of fossil bones made\r\nby MM. Lund and Clausen in the caves of Brazil. I was so much impressed\r\nwith these facts that I strongly insisted, in 1839 and 1845, on this 'law\r\nof the succession of types,'--on 'this wonderful relationship in the same\r\ncontinent between the dead and the living.' Professor Owen has subsequently\r\nextended the same generalization to the Mammals of the Old World. We see\r\nthe same law in this author's restorations of the extinct and gigantic\r\nbirds of New Zealand. We see it also in the birds of the caves of Brazil.\r\nMr. Woodward has shown that the same law holds good with sea-shells, but\r\nfrom the wide distribution of most genera of molluscs, it is not well\r\ndisplayed by them. Other cases could be added, as the relation between the\r\nextinct and living landshells of Madeira, and between the extinct and\r\nliving brackish-water shells of the Aralo-Caspian Sea.\"\r\n\r\nThe general results, then, are these. Our knowledge of distribution in\r\nTime, being derived wholly from the evidence afforded by fossils, is\r\nlimited to that geologic time of which some records remain--cannot extend\r\nto those remoter times the records of which have been obliterated. From\r\nthese remaining records, which probably form but a small fraction of the\r\nwhole, the general facts deducible are these:--That such organic types as\r\nhave lived through successive epochs, have almost universally undergone\r\nmodifications of specific and generic values--modifications which have\r\ncommonly been great in proportion as the period has been long. That besides\r\nthe types which have persisted from ancient eras down to our own era, other\r\ntypes have from time to time made their appearance in the ascending series\r\nof strata--types of which some are lower and some higher than the types\r\npreviously recorded; but whence these new types came, and whether any of\r\nthem arose by divergence from the previously-recorded types, the evidence\r\ndoes not yet enable us to say. That in the course of long geologic epochs\r\nnearly all species, most genera, and a few orders, have become extinct; and\r\nthat a species, genus, or order, which has once disappeared from the Earth\r\nnever reappears. And, lastly, that the Fauna now occupying each separate\r\narea of the Earth's surface is very nearly allied to the Fauna which\r\nexisted on that area during recent geologic times.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 108. Omitting sundry minor generalizations, the exposition of which would\r\ninvolve too much detail, what is to be said of these major generalizations?\r\n\r\nThe distribution in Space cannot be said to imply that organisms have been\r\ndesigned for their particular habitats and placed in them; since, besides\r\nthe habitat in which each kind of organism is found there are commonly\r\nother habitats, as good or better for it, from which it is absent--habitats\r\nto which it is so much better fitted than organisms now occupying them,\r\nthat it extrudes these organisms when allowed the opportunity. Neither can\r\nwe suppose that the purpose has been to establish varieties of Floras and\r\nFaunas; since, if so, why are the Floras and Faunas but little divergent in\r\nwidely-sundered areas between which migration is possible, while they are\r\nmarkedly divergent in adjacent areas between which migration is impossible?\r\n\r\nPassing to distributions in Time, there arise the questions--why during\r\nnearly the whole of that vast period geologically recorded have there\r\nexisted none of those highest organic forms which have now overrun the\r\nEarth?--how is it that we find no traces of a creature endowed with large\r\ncapacities for knowledge and happiness? The answer that the Earth was not,\r\nin remote times, a fit habitation for such a creature, besides being\r\nunwarranted by the evidence, suggests the equally awkward question--why\r\nduring untold millions of years did the Earth remain fit only for inferior\r\ncreatures? What, again, is the meaning of extinction of types? To conclude\r\nthat the saurian type was replaced by other types at the beginning of the\r\ntertiary period, because it was not adapted to the conditions which then\r\narose, is to conclude that it could not be modified into fitness for the\r\nconditions; and this conclusion is at variance with the hypothesis that\r\ncreative skill is shown in the multiform adaptations of one type to many\r\nends.\r\n\r\nWhat interpretations may rationally be put on these and other general facts\r\nof distribution in Space and Time, will be seen in the next division of\r\nthis work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nTHE EVOLUTION OF LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 109. In the foregoing Part, we have contemplated the most important of\r\nthe generalizations to which biologists have been led by observation of\r\norganisms; as well as some others which contemplation of the facts has\r\nsuggested to me. These Inductions of Biology have also been severally\r\nglanced at on their deductive sides; for the purpose of noting the harmony\r\nexisting between them and those primordial truths set forth in _First\r\nPrinciples_. Having thus studied the leading phenomena of life separately,\r\nwe are prepared for studying them as an aggregate, with the view of\r\narriving at the most general interpretation of them.\r\n\r\nThere is an _ensemble_ of vital phenomena presented by each organism in the\r\ncourse of its growth, development, and decay; and there is an _ensemble_ of\r\nvital phenomena presented by the organic world as a whole. Neither of these\r\ncan be properly dealt with apart from the other. But the last of them may\r\nbe separately treated more conveniently than the first. What interpretation\r\nwe put on the facts of structure and function in each living body, depends\r\nentirely on our conception of the mode in which living bodies in general\r\nhave originated. To form some conclusion respecting this mode--a\r\nprovisional if not a permanent conclusion--must therefore be our first\r\nstep.\r\n\r\nWe have to choose between two hypotheses--the hypothesis of Special\r\nCreation and the hypothesis of Evolution. Either the multitudinous kinds of\r\norganisms which now exist, and the far more multitudinous kinds which have\r\nexisted during past geologic eras, have been from time to time separately\r\nmade; or they have arisen by insensible steps, through actions such as we\r\nsee habitually going on. Both hypotheses imply a Cause. The last, certainly\r\nas much as the first, recognizes this Cause as inscrutable. The point at\r\nissue is, how this inscrutable Cause has worked in the production of living\r\nforms. This point, if it is to be decided at all, is to be decided only by\r\nexamination of evidence. Let us inquire which of these antagonist\r\nhypotheses is most congruous with established facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ASPECTS OF THE SPECIAL-CREATION-HYPOTHESIS.[45]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 110. Early ideas are not usually true ideas. Undeveloped intellect, be it\r\nthat of an individual or that of the race, forms conclusions which require\r\nto be revised and re-revised, before they reach a tolerable correspondence\r\nwith realities. Were it otherwise there would be no discovery, no increase\r\nof intelligence. What we call the progress of knowledge, is the bringing of\r\nThoughts into harmony with Things; and it implies that the first Thoughts\r\nare either wholly out of harmony with Things, or in very incomplete harmony\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nIf illustrations be needed the history of every science furnishes them. The\r\nprimitive notions of mankind as to the structure of the heavens were wrong;\r\nand the notions which replaced them were successively less wrong. The\r\noriginal belief respecting the form of the Earth was wrong; and this wrong\r\nbelief survived through the first civilizations. The earliest ideas that\r\nhave come down to us concerning the natures of the elements were wrong; and\r\nonly in quite recent times has the composition of matter in its various\r\nforms been better understood. The interpretations of mechanical facts, of\r\nmeteorological facts, of physiological facts, were at first wrong. In all\r\nthese cases men set out with beliefs which, if not absolutely false,\r\ncontained but small amounts of truth disguised by immense amounts of error.\r\n\r\nHence the hypothesis that living beings resulted from special creations,\r\nbeing a primitive hypothesis, is probably an untrue hypothesis. It would be\r\nstrange if, while early men failed to reach the truth in so many cases\r\nwhere it is comparatively conspicuous, they reached it in a case where it\r\nis comparatively hidden.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 111. Besides the improbability given to the belief in special creations,\r\nby its association with mistaken beliefs in general, a further\r\nimprobability is given to it by its association with a special class of\r\nmistaken beliefs. It belongs to a family of beliefs which have one after\r\nanother been destroyed by advancing knowledge; and is, indeed, almost the\r\nonly member of the family surviving among educated people.\r\n\r\nWe all know that the savage thinks of each striking phenomenon, or group of\r\nphenomena, as caused by some separate personal agent; that out of this\r\nconception there grows up a polytheistic conception, in which these minor\r\npersonalities are variously generalized into deities presiding over\r\ndifferent divisions of nature; and that these are eventually further\r\ngeneralized. This progressive consolidation of causal agencies may be\r\ntraced in the creeds of all races, and is far from complete in the creed of\r\nthe most advanced races. The unlettered rustics who till our fields, do not\r\nlet the consciousness of a supreme power wholly absorb the aboriginal\r\nconceptions of good and evil spirits, and of charms or secret potencies\r\ndwelling in particular objects. The earliest mode of thinking changes only\r\nas fast as the constant relations among phenomena are established. Scarcely\r\nless familiar is the truth, that while accumulating knowledge makes these\r\nconceptions of personal causal agents gradually more vague, as it merges\r\nthem into general causes, it also destroys the habit of thinking of them as\r\nworking after the methods of personal agents. We do not now, like Kepler,\r\nassume guiding spirits to keep the planets in their orbits. It is no longer\r\nthe universal belief that the sea was once for all mechanically parted from\r\nthe dry land; or that the mountains were placed where we see them by a\r\nsudden creative act. All but a narrow class have ceased to suppose sunshine\r\nand storm to be sent in some arbitrary succession. The majority of educated\r\npeople have given up thinking of epidemics of punishments inflicted by an\r\nangry deity. Nor do even the common people regard a madman as one possessed\r\nby a demon. That is to say, we everywhere see fading away the\r\nanthropomorphic conception of Cause. In one case after another, is\r\nabandoned the ascription of phenomena to a will analogous to the human\r\nwill, working by methods analogous to human methods.\r\n\r\nIf, then, of this once-numerous family of beliefs the immense majority have\r\nbecome extinct, we may not unreasonably expect that the few remaining\r\nmembers of the family will become extinct. One of these is the belief we\r\nare here considering--the belief that each species of organism was\r\nspecially created. Many who in all else have abandoned the aboriginal\r\ntheory of things, still hold this remnant of the aboriginal theory. Ask any\r\nwell-informed man whether he accepts the cosmogony of the Indians, or the\r\nGreeks, or the Hebrews, and he will regard the question as next to an\r\ninsult. Yet one element common to these cosmogonies he very likely retains:\r\nnot bearing in mind its origin. For whence did he get the doctrine of\r\nspecial creations? Catechise him, and he is forced to confess that it was\r\nput into his mind in childhood, as one portion of a story which, as a\r\nwhole, he has long since rejected. Why this fragment is likely to be right\r\nwhile all the rest is wrong, he is unable to say. May we not then expect\r\nthat the relinquishment of all other parts of this story, will by and by be\r\nfollowed by the relinquishment of this remaining part of it?\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 112. The belief which we find thus questionable, both as being a\r\nprimitive belief and as being a belief belonging to an almost-extinct\r\nfamily, is a belief not countenanced by a single fact. No one ever saw a\r\nspecial creation; no one ever found proof of an indirect kind that a\r\nspecial creation had taken place. It is significant, as Dr. Hooker remarks,\r\nthat naturalists who suppose new species to be miraculously originated,\r\nhabitually suppose the origination to occur in some region remote from\r\nhuman observation. Wherever the order of organic nature is exposed to the\r\nview of zoologists and botanists, it expels this conception; and the\r\nconception survives only in connexion with imagined places, where the order\r\nof organic nature is unknown.\r\n\r\nBesides being absolutely without evidence to give it external support, this\r\nhypothesis of special creations cannot support itself internally--cannot be\r\nframed into a coherent thought. It is one of those illegitimate symbolic\r\nconceptions which are mistaken for legitimate symbolic conceptions (_First\r\nPrinciples_, § 9), because they remain untested. Immediately an attempt is\r\nmade to elaborate the idea into anything like a definite shape, it proves\r\nto be a pseud-idea, admitting of no definite shape. Is it supposed that a\r\nnew organism, when specially created, is created out of nothing? If so,\r\nthere is a supposed creation of matter; and the creation of matter is\r\ninconceivable--implies the establishment of a relation in thought between\r\nnothing and something--a relation of which one term is absent--an\r\nimpossible relation. Is it supposed that the matter of which the new\r\norganism consists is not created for the occasion, but is taken out of its\r\npre-existing forms and arranged into a new form? If so, we are met by the\r\nquestion--how is the re-arrangement effected? Of the myriad atoms going to\r\nthe composition of the new organism, all of them previously dispersed\r\nthrough the neighbouring air and earth, does each, suddenly disengaging\r\nitself from its combinations, rush to meet the rest, unite with them into\r\nthe appropriate chemical compounds, and then fall with certain others into\r\nits appointed place in the aggregate of complex tissues and organs? Surely\r\nthus to assume a myriad supernatural impulses, differing in their\r\ndirections and amounts, given to as many different atoms, is a\r\nmultiplication of mysteries rather than the solution of a mystery. For\r\nevery one of these impulses, not being the result of a force locally\r\nexisting in some other form, implies the creation of force; and the\r\ncreation of force is just as inconceivable as the creation of matter. It is\r\nthus with all attempted ways of representing the process. The old Hebrew\r\nidea that God takes clay and moulds a new creature, as a potter moulds a\r\nvessel, is probably too grossly anthropomorphic to be accepted by any\r\nmodern defender of the special-creation doctrine. But having abandoned this\r\ncrude belief, what belief is he prepared to substitute? If a new organism\r\nis not thus produced, then in what way is one produced? or rather--in what\r\nway does he conceive a new organism to be produced? We will not ask for the\r\nascertained mode, but will be content with a mode which can be consistently\r\nimagined. No such mode, however, is assignable. Those who entertain the\r\nproposition that each kind of organism results from a divine interposition,\r\ndo so because they refrain from translating words into thoughts. They do\r\nnot really believe, but rather _believe they believe_. For belief, properly\r\nso called, implies a mental representation of the thing believed, and no\r\nsuch mental representation is here possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 113. If we imagine mankind to be contemplated by some being as\r\nshort-lived as an ephemeron, but possessing intelligence like our own--if\r\nwe imagine such a being studying men and women, during his few hours of\r\nlife, and speculating as to the mode in which they came into existence; it\r\nis manifest that, reasoning in the usual way, he would suppose each man and\r\nwoman to have been separately created.  No appreciable changes of structure\r\noccurring in any of them during the time over which his observations\r\nextended, this being would probably infer that no changes of structure were\r\ntaking place, or had taken place; and that from the outset each man and\r\nwoman had possessed all the characters then visible--had been originally\r\nformed with them. The application is obvious. A human life is ephemeral\r\ncompared with the life of a species; and even the period over which the\r\nrecords of all human lives extend, is ephemeral compared with the life of a\r\nspecies. There is thus a parallel contrast between the immensely-long\r\nseries of changes which have occurred during the life of a species, and\r\nthat small portion of the series open to our view. And there is no reason\r\nto suppose that the first conclusion drawn by mankind from this small part\r\nof the series visible to them, is any nearer the truth than would be the\r\nconclusion of the supposed ephemeral being respecting men and women.\r\n\r\nThis analogy, suggesting as it does how the hypothesis of special creations\r\nis merely a formula for our ignorance, raises the question--What reason\r\nhave we to assume special creations of species but not of individuals;\r\nunless it be that in the case of individuals we directly know the process\r\nto be otherwise, but in the case of species do not directly know it to be\r\notherwise? Have we any ground for concluding that species were specially\r\ncreated, except the ground that we have no immediate knowledge of their\r\norigin? And does our ignorance of the manner in which they arose warrant us\r\nin asserting that they arose by special creation?\r\n\r\nAnother question is suggested by this analogy. Those who, in the absence of\r\nimmediate evidence of the way in which species arose, assert that they\r\narose not in a natural way allied to that in which individuals arise, but\r\nin a supernatural way, think that by this supposition they honour the\r\nUnknown Cause of things; and they oppose any antagonist doctrine as\r\namounting to an exclusion of divine power from the world. But if divine\r\npower is demonstrated by the separate creation of each species, would it\r\nnot have been still better demonstrated by the separate creation of each\r\nindividual? Why should there exist this process of natural genesis? Why\r\nshould not omnipotence have been proved by the supernatural production of\r\nplants and animals everywhere throughout the world from hour to hour? Is it\r\nreplied that the Creator was able to make individuals arise from one\r\nanother in a natural succession, but not to make species thus arise? This\r\nis to assign a limit to power instead of magnifying it. Either it was\r\npossible or not possible to create species and individuals after the same\r\ngeneral method. To say that it was not possible is suicidal in those who\r\nuse this argument; and if it was possible, it is required to say what end\r\nis served by the special creation of species which would not have been\r\nbetter served by the special creation of individuals. Again, what is to be\r\nthought of the fact that the immense majority of these supposed special\r\ncreations took place before mankind existed? Those who think that divine\r\npower is demonstrated by special creations, have to answer the question--to\r\nwhom demonstrated? Tacitly or avowedly, they regard the demonstrations as\r\nbeing for the benefit of mankind. But if so, to what purpose were the\r\nmillions of these demonstrations which took place on the Earth when there\r\nwere no intelligent beings to contemplate them? Did the Unknowable thus\r\ndemonstrate his power to himself? Few will have the hardihood to say that\r\nany such demonstration was needful. There is no choice but to regard them,\r\neither as superfluous exercises of power, which is a derogatory\r\nsupposition, or as exercises of power that were necessary because species\r\ncould not be otherwise produced, which is also a derogatory supposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 113a. Other implications concerning the divine character must be\r\nrecognized by those who contend that each species arose by divine fiat. It\r\nis hardly supposable that Infinite Power is exercised in trivial actions\r\neffecting trivial changes. Yet the organic world in its hundreds of\r\nthousands of species shows in each sub-division multitudinous forms which,\r\nthough unlike enough to be classed as specifically distinct, diverge from\r\none another only in small details which have no significance in relation to\r\nthe life led. Sometimes the number of specific distinctions is so great\r\nthat did they result from human agency we should call them whimsical.\r\n\r\nFor example, in Lake Baikal are found 115 species of an amphipod,\r\n_Gammarus_; and the multiplicity becomes startling on learning that this\r\nnumber exceeds the number of all other species of the genus: various as are\r\nthe conditions to which, throughout the rest of the world, the genus is\r\nsubject. Still stranger seems the superfluous exercise of power on\r\nexamining the carpet of living forms at the bottom of the ocean. Not\r\ndwelling on the immense variety of creatures unlike in type which live\r\nmiles below the surface in absolute darkness, it will suffice to instance\r\nthe _Polyzoa_ alone: low types of animals so small that a thousand of them\r\nwould not cover a square inch, and on which, nevertheless, there has been,\r\naccording to the view we are considering, an exercise of creative skill\r\nsuch that by small variations of structure more than 350 species have been\r\nproduced!\r\n\r\nKindred illustrations are furnished by the fauna of caverns. Are we to\r\nsuppose that numerous blind creatures--crustaceans, myriapods, spiders,\r\ninsects, fishes--were specially made sightless to fit them for the Mammoth\r\nCave? Or what shall we say of the _Proteus_, a low amphibian with\r\nrudimentary eyes, which inhabits certain caves in Carniola, Carinthia and\r\nDalmatia and is not found elsewhere. Must we conclude that God went out of\r\nhis way to devise an animal for these places?\r\n\r\nMore puzzling still is a problem presented to the special-creationist by a\r\nbatrachian inhabiting Central Australia. In a region once peopled by\r\nnumerous animals but now made unfit by continuous droughts, there exists a\r\nfrog which, when the pools are drying up, fills itself with water and\r\nburrowing in the mud hibernates until the next rains; which may come in a\r\nyear or may be delayed for two years. What is to be thought of this\r\ncreature? Were its structure and the accompanying instinct divinely planned\r\nto fit it to this particular habitat?\r\n\r\nMany such questions might be asked which, if answered as the current theory\r\nnecessitates, imply a divine nature hardly like that otherwise assumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 114. Those who espouse the aboriginal hypothesis entangle themselves in\r\nyet other theological difficulties. This assumption that each kind of\r\norganism was specially designed, carries with it the implication that the\r\ndesigner intended everything which results from the design. There is no\r\nescape from the admission that if organisms were severally constructed with\r\na view to their respective ends, then the character of the constructor is\r\nindicated both by the ends themselves, and the perfection or imperfection\r\nwith which the organisms are fitted to them. Observe the consequences.\r\n\r\nWithout dwelling on the question recently raised, why during untold\r\nmillions of years there existed on the Earth no beings endowed with\r\ncapacities for wide thought and high feeling, we may content ourselves with\r\nasking why, at present, the Earth is largely peopled by creatures which\r\ninflict on one another so much suffering? Omitting the human race, whose\r\ndefects and miseries the current theology professes to account for, and\r\nlimiting ourselves to the lower creation, what must we think of the\r\ncountless different pain-inflicting appliances and instincts with which\r\nanimals are endowed? Not only now, and not only ever since men have lived,\r\nhas the Earth been a scene of warfare among all sentient creatures; but\r\npalæontology shows us that from the earliest eras geologically recorded,\r\nthere has been going on this universal carnage. Fossil structures, in\r\ncommon with the structures of existing animals, show us elaborate weapons\r\nfor destroying other animals. We have unmistakable proof that throughout\r\nall past time, there has been a ceaseless devouring of the weak by the\r\nstrong.  How is this to be explained? How happens it that animals were so\r\ndesigned as to render this bloodshed necessary? How happens it that in\r\nalmost every species the number of individuals annually born is such that\r\nthe majority die by starvation or by violence before arriving at maturity?\r\nWhoever contends that each kind of animal was specially designed, must\r\nassert either that there was a deliberate intention on the part of the\r\nCreator to produce these results, or that there was an inability to prevent\r\nthem. Which alternative does he prefer?--to cast an imputation on the\r\ndivine character or to assert a limitation of the divine power? It is\r\nuseless for him to plead that the destruction of the less powerful by the\r\nmore powerful, is a means of preventing the miseries of decrepitude and\r\nincapacity, and therefore works beneficently. For even were the chief\r\nmortality among the aged instead of among the young, there would still\r\narise the unanswerable question--why were not animals constructed in such\r\nways as to avoid these evils? why were not their rates of multiplication,\r\ntheir degrees of intelligence, and their propensities, so adjusted that\r\nthese sufferings might be escaped? And if decline of vigour was a necessary\r\naccompaniment of age, why was it not provided that the organic actions\r\nshould end in sudden death, whenever they fell below the level required for\r\npleasurable existence? Will any one who contends that organisms were\r\nspecially designed, assert that they could not have been so designed as to\r\nprevent suffering? And if he admits that they could have been made so as to\r\nprevent suffering, will he assert that the Creator preferred making them in\r\nsuch ways as to inflict suffering?\r\n\r\nEven as thus presented the difficulty is sufficiently great; but it appears\r\nimmensely greater when we examine the facts more closely. So long as we\r\ncontemplate only the preying of the superior on the inferior, some good\r\nappears to be extracted from the evil--a certain amount of life of a higher\r\norder, is supported by sacrificing a great deal of life of a lower order.\r\nSo long, too, as we leave out all mortality but that which, by carrying off\r\nthe least perfect members of each species, leaves the most perfect members\r\nto survive and multiply; we see some compensating benefit reached through\r\nthe suffering inflicted. But what shall we say on finding innumerable cases\r\nin which the suffering inflicted brings no compensating benefit? What shall\r\nwe say when we see the inferior destroying the superior? What shall we say\r\non finding elaborate appliances for furthering the multiplication of\r\norganisms incapable of feeling, at the expense of misery to organisms\r\ncapable of happiness?\r\n\r\nOf the animal kingdom as a whole, more than half the species are parasites.\r\n\"The number of these parasites,\" says Prof. Owen, \"may be conceived when it\r\nis stated that almost every known animal has its peculiar species, and\r\ngenerally more than one, sometimes as many as, or even more kinds than,\r\ninfest the human body.\" This parasitism begins among the most minute\r\ncreatures and pervades the entire animal kingdom from the lowest to the\r\nhighest. Even _Protozoa_, made visible to us only by the microscope, are\r\ninfested, as is _Paramoecium_ by broods of _Sphærophrya_; while in large\r\nand complex animals parasites are everywhere present in great variety. More\r\nthan this is true. There are parasites upon parasites--an arrangement such\r\nthat those which are torturing the creatures they inhabit are themselves\r\ntortured by indwelling creatures still smaller: looking like an ingenious\r\naccumulation of pains upon pains.\r\n\r\nBut passing over the evils thus inflicted on animals of inferior dignity,\r\nlet us limit ourselves to the case of Man. The _Bothriocephalus latus_ and\r\nthe _Tænia solium_, are two kinds of tape-worm, which flourish in the human\r\nintestines; producing great constitutional disturbances, sometimes ending\r\nin insanity; and from the germs of the _Tænia_, when carried into other\r\nparts of the body, arise certain partially-developed forms known as\r\n_Cysticerci_, _Echinococci_, and _Coenuri_, which cause disorganization\r\nmore or less extensive in the brain, the lungs, the liver, the heart, the\r\neye, &c., often ending fatally after long-continued suffering. Five other\r\nparasites, belonging to a different class, are found in the viscera of\r\nman--the _Trichocephalus_, the _Oxyuris_, the _Strongylus_ (two species),\r\nthe _Ancylostomum_ and the _Ascaris_; which, beyond that defect of\r\nnutrition which they necessarily cause, sometimes induce certain\r\nirritations that lead to complete demoralization. Of another class of\r\n_entozoa_, belonging to the subdivision _Trematoda_, there are five kinds\r\nfound in different organs of the human body--the liver and gall-duct, the\r\nportal vein, the intestine, the bladder, the eye. Then we have the\r\n_Trichina spiralis_, which passes through one phase of its existence\r\nimbedded in the muscles and through another phase of its existence in the\r\nintestine; and which, by the induced disease _Trichinosis_, has lately\r\ncommitted such ravages in Germany as to cause a panic. To these we must add\r\nthe Guinea-worm, which in some part of Africa and India makes men miserable\r\nby burrowing in their legs; and the more terrible African parasite the\r\n_Bilharzia_, which affects 30 per cent. of the natives on the east coast\r\nwith bleeding of the bladder. From _entozoa_, let us pass to _epizoa_.\r\nThere are two kinds of _Acari_, one of them inhabiting the follicles of the\r\nskin and the other producing the itch. There are creatures that bury\r\nthemselves beneath the skin and lay their eggs there; and there are three\r\nspecies of lice which infest the surface of the body. Nor is this all.\r\nBesides animal parasites there are sundry vegetal parasites, which grow and\r\nmultiply at our cost. The _Sarcina ventriculi_ inhabits the stomach, and\r\nproduces gastric disturbance. The _Leptothrix buccalis_ is extremely\r\ngeneral in the mouth, and may have something to do with the decay of teeth.\r\nAnd besides these there are microscopic fungi which produce ringworm,\r\nporrigo, pityriasis, thrush, &c.  Thus the human body is the habitat of\r\nparasites, internal and external, animal and vegetal, numbering, if all are\r\nset down, between two and three dozen species; sundry of which are peculiar\r\nto Man, and many of which produce great suffering and not unfrequently\r\ndeath. What interpretation is to be put on these facts by those who espouse\r\nthe hypothesis of special creations? According to this hypothesis, all\r\nthese parasites were designed for their respective modes of life. They were\r\nendowed with constitutions fitting them to live by absorbing nutriment from\r\nthe human body; they were furnished with appliances, often of a formidable\r\nkind, enabling them to root themselves in and upon the human body; and they\r\nwere made prolific in an almost incredible degree, that their germs might\r\nhave a sufficient number of chances of finding their way into the human\r\nbody. In short, elaborate contrivances were combined to insure the\r\ncontinuance of their respective races; and to make it impossible for the\r\nsuccessive generations of men to avoid being preyed on by them. What shall\r\nwe say to this arrangement? Shall we say that \"the head and crown of\r\nthings,\" was provided as a habitat for these parasites? Shall we say that\r\nthese degraded creatures, incapable of thought or enjoyment, were created\r\nthat they might cause human misery? One or other of these alternatives must\r\nbe chosen by those who contend that every kind of organism was separately\r\ndevised by the Creator. Which do they prefer? With the conception of two\r\nantagonist powers, which severally work good and evil in the world, the\r\nfacts are congruous enough. But with the conception of a supreme\r\nbeneficence, this gratuitous infliction of pain is absolutely incompatible.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 115. See then the results of our examination. The belief in special\r\ncreations of organisms arose among men during the era of profoundest\r\ndarkness; and it belongs to a family of beliefs which have nearly all died\r\nout as enlightenment has increased. It is without a solitary established\r\nfact on which to stand; and when the attempt is made to put it into\r\ndefinite shape in the mind, it turns out to be only a pseud-idea.  This\r\nmere verbal hypothesis, which men idly accept as a real or thinkable\r\nhypothesis, is of the same nature as would be one, based on a day's\r\nobservation of human life, that each man and woman was specially\r\ncreated--an hypothesis not suggested by evidence but by lack of\r\nevidence--an hypothesis which formulates ignorance into a semblance of\r\nknowledge. Further, we see that this hypothesis, failing to satisfy men's\r\nintellectual need of an interpretation, fails also to satisfy their moral\r\nsentiment. It is quite inconsistent with those conceptions of the divine\r\nnature which they profess to entertain. If infinite power was to be\r\ndemonstrated, then, either by the special creation of every individual, or\r\nby the production of species by some method of natural genesis, it would be\r\nbetter demonstrated than by the use of two methods, as assumed by the\r\nhypothesis. And if infinite goodness was to be demonstrated, then, not only\r\ndo the provisions of organic structure, if they are specially devised, fail\r\nto demonstrate it, but there is an enormous mass of them which imply\r\nmalevolence rather than benevolence.\r\n\r\nThus the hypothesis of special creations turns out to be worthless by its\r\nderivation; worthless in its intrinsic incoherence; worthless as absolutely\r\nwithout evidence; worthless as not supplying an intellectual need;\r\nworthless as not satisfying a moral want. We must therefore consider it as\r\ncounting for nothing, in opposition to any other hypothesis respecting the\r\norigin of organic beings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ASPECTS OF THE EVOLUTION-HYPOTHESIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 116. Just as the supposition that races of organisms have been specially\r\ncreated, is discredited by its origin; so, conversely, the supposition that\r\nraces of organisms have been evolved, is credited by its origin. Instead of\r\nbeing a conception suggested and accepted when mankind were profoundly\r\nignorant, it is a conception born in times of comparative enlightenment.\r\nMoreover, the belief that plants and animals have arisen in pursuance of\r\nuniform laws, instead of through breaches of uniform laws, is a belief\r\nwhich has come into existence in the most-instructed class, living in these\r\nbetter-instructed times. Not among those who have disregarded the order of\r\nNature, has this idea made its appearance; but among those who have\r\nfamiliarized themselves with the order of Nature. Thus the derivation of\r\nthis modern hypothesis is as favourable as that of the ancient hypothesis\r\nis unfavourable.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 117. A kindred antithesis exists between the two families of beliefs, to\r\nwhich the beliefs we are comparing severally belong. While the one family\r\nhas been dying out the other family has been multiplying. As fast as men\r\nhave ceased to regard different classes of phenomena as caused by special\r\npersonal agents, acting irregularly; so fast have they come to regard these\r\ndifferent classes of phenomena as caused by a general agency acting\r\nuniformly--the two changes being correlatives. And as, on the one hand, the\r\nhypothesis that each species resulted from a supernatural act, having lost\r\nnearly all its kindred hypotheses, may be expected soon to die; so, on the\r\nother hand, the hypothesis that each species resulted from the action of\r\nnatural causes, being one of an increasing family of hypotheses, may be\r\nexpected to survive.\r\n\r\nStill greater will the probability of its survival and establishment\r\nappear, when we observe that it is one of a particular genus of hypotheses\r\nwhich has been rapidly extending. The interpretation of phenomena as\r\nresults of Evolution, has been independently showing itself in various\r\nfields of inquiry, quite remote from one another. The supposition that the\r\nSolar System has been evolved out of diffused matter, is a supposition\r\nwholly astronomical in its origin and application. Geologists, without\r\nbeing led thereto by astronomical considerations, have been step by step\r\nadvancing towards the conviction that the Earth has reached its present\r\nvaried structure by modification upon modification. The inquiries of\r\nbiologists have proved the falsity of the once general belief, that the\r\ngerm of each organism is a minute repetition of the mature organism,\r\ndiffering from it only in bulk; and they have shown, contrariwise, that\r\nevery organism advances from simplicity to complexity through insensible\r\nchanges. Among philosophical politicians, there has been spreading the\r\nperception that the progress of society is an evolution: the truth that\r\n\"constitutions are not made but grow,\" is seen to be a part of the more\r\ngeneral truth that societies are not made but grow. It is now universally\r\nadmitted by philologists that languages, instead of being artificially or\r\nsupernaturally formed, have been developed. And the histories of religion,\r\nof science, of the fine arts, of the industrial arts, show that these have\r\npassed through stages as unobtrusive as those through which the mind of a\r\nchild passes on its way to maturity. If, then, the recognition of evolution\r\nas the law of many diverse orders of phenomena, has been spreading; may we\r\nnot say that there thence arises the probability that evolution will\r\npresently be recognized as the law of the phenomena we are considering?\r\nEach further advance of knowledge confirms the belief in the unity of\r\nNature; and the discovery that evolution has gone on, or is going on, in so\r\nmany departments of Nature, becomes a reason for believing that there is no\r\ndepartment of Nature in which it does not go on.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 118. The hypotheses of Special Creation and Evolution, are no less\r\ncontrasted in respect of their legitimacy as hypotheses. While, as we have\r\nseen, the one belongs to that order of symbolic conceptions which are\r\nproved to be illusive by the impossibility of realizing them in thought;\r\nthe other is one of those symbolic conceptions which are more or less fully\r\nrealizable in thought. The production of all organic forms by the\r\naccumulation of modifications and of divergences by the continual addition\r\nof differences to differences, is mentally representable in outline, if not\r\nin detail. Various orders of our experiences enable us to conceive the\r\nprocess. Let us look at one of the simplest.\r\n\r\nThere is no apparent similarity between a straight line and a circle. The\r\none is a curve; the other is defined as without curvature. The one encloses\r\na space; the other will not enclose a space though produced for ever. The\r\none is finite; the other may be infinite. Yet, opposite as the two are in\r\ntheir characters, they may be connected together by a series of lines no\r\none of which differs from the adjacent ones in any appreciable degree.\r\nThus, if a cone be cut by a plane at right angles to its axis we get a\r\ncircle. If, instead of being perfectly at right angles, the plane subtends\r\nwith the axis an angle of 89° 59', we have an ellipse which no human eye,\r\neven when aided by an accurate pair of compasses, can distinguish from a\r\ncircle. Decreasing the angle minute by minute, this closed curve becomes\r\nperceptibly eccentric, then manifestly so, and by and by acquires so\r\nimmensely elongated a form so as to bear no recognizable resemblance to a\r\ncircle. By continuing this process the ellipse changes insensibly into a\r\nparabola. On still further diminishing the angle, the parabola becomes an\r\nhyperbola. And finally, if the cone be made gradually more obtuse, the\r\nhyperbola passes into a straight line as the angle of the cone approaches\r\n180°. Here then we have five different species of line--circle, ellipse,\r\nparabola, hyperbola, and straight line--each having its peculiar properties\r\nand its separate equation, and the first and last of which are quite\r\nopposite in nature, connected together as members of one series, all\r\nproducible by a single process of insensible modification.\r\n\r\nBut the experiences which most clearly illustrate the process of general\r\nevolution, are our experiences of special evolution, repeated in every\r\nplant and animal. Each organism exhibits, within a short time, a series of\r\nchanges which, when supposed to occupy a period indefinitely great, and to\r\ngo on in various ways instead of one way, give us a tolerably clear\r\nconception of organic evolution at large. In an individual development, we\r\nsee brought into a comparatively infinitesimal time, a series of\r\nmetamorphoses equally great with each of those which the hypothesis of\r\nevolution assumes to have taken place during immeasurable geologic epochs.\r\nA tree differs from a seed in every respect--in bulk, in structure, in\r\ncolour, in form, in chemical composition. Yet is the one changed in the\r\ncourse of a few years into the other: changed so gradually, that at no\r\nmoment can it be said--Now the seed ceases to be and the tree exists. What\r\ncan be more widely contrasted than a newly-born child and the small,\r\nsemi-transparent, gelatinous spherule constituting the human ovum? The\r\ninfant is so complex in structure that a cyclopædia is needed to describe\r\nits constituent parts. The germinal vesicle is so simple that it may be\r\ndefined in a line. Nevertheless, nine months suffice to develop the one out\r\nof the other; and that, too, by a series of modifications so small, that\r\nwere the embryo examined at successive minutes, even a microscope would not\r\ndisclose any sensible changes. Aided by such facts, the conception of\r\ngeneral evolution may be rendered as definite a conception as any of our\r\ncomplex conceptions can be rendered. If, instead of the successive minutes\r\nof a child's foetal life, we take the lives of successive generations of\r\ncreatures--if we regard the successive generations as differing from one\r\nanother no more than the foetus differs in successive minutes; our\r\nimaginations must indeed be feeble if we fail to realize in thought, the\r\nevolution of the most complex organism out of the simplest. If a single\r\ncell, under appropriate conditions, becomes a man in the space of a few\r\nyears; there can surely be no difficulty in understanding how, under\r\nappropriate conditions, a cell may, in the course of untold millions of\r\nyears, give origin to the human race.\r\n\r\nDoubtless many minds are so unfurnished with those experiences of Nature\r\nout of which this conception is built, that they find difficulty in forming\r\nit. Looking at things rather in their statical than in their dynamical\r\naspects, they never realize the fact that, by small increments of\r\nmodification, any amount of modification may in time be generated. The\r\nsurprise they feel on finding one whom they last saw as a boy, grown into a\r\nman, becomes incredulity when the degree of change is greater. To such, the\r\nhypothesis that by any series of changes a protozoon can give origin to a\r\nmammal, seems grotesque--as grotesque as Galileo's assertion of the Earth's\r\nmovement seemed to his persecutors; or as grotesque as the assertion of the\r\nEarth's sphericity seems now to the New Zealanders. But those who accept a\r\nliterally-unthinkable proposition as quite satisfactory, may not\r\nunnaturally be expected to make a converse mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 119. The hypothesis of evolution is contrasted with the hypothesis of\r\nspecial creations, in a further respect. It is not simply legitimate\r\ninstead of illegitimate, because representable in thought instead of\r\nunrepresentable; but it has the support of some evidence, instead of being\r\nabsolutely unsupported by evidence. Though the facts at present assignable\r\nin _direct_ proof that by progressive modifications, races of organisms\r\nwhich are apparently distinct from antecedent races have descended from\r\nthem, are not sufficient; yet there are numerous facts of the order\r\nrequired. Beyond all question unlikenesses of structure gradually arise\r\namong the members of successive generations. We find that there is going on\r\na modifying process of the kind alleged as the source of specific\r\ndifferences: a process which, though slow, does, in time, produce\r\nconspicuous changes--a process which, to all appearance, would produce in\r\nmillions of years, any amount of change.\r\n\r\nIn the chapters on \"Heredity\" and \"Variation,\" contained in the preceding\r\nPart, many such facts were given, and more might be added. Although little\r\nattention has been paid to the matter until recent times, the evidence\r\nalready collected shows that there take place in successive generations,\r\nalterations of structure quite as marked as those which, in successive\r\nshort intervals, arise in a developing embryo--nay, often much more marked;\r\nsince, besides differences due to changes in the relative sizes or parts,\r\nthere sometimes arise differences due to additions and suppressions of\r\nparts. The structural modification proved to have taken place since\r\norganisms have been observed, is not less than the hypothesis\r\ndemands--bears as great a ratio to this brief period, as the total amount\r\nof structural change seen in the evolution of a complex organism out of a\r\nsimple germ, bears to that vast period during which living forms have\r\nexisted on the Earth.\r\n\r\nWe have, indeed, much the same kind and quantity of direct evidence that\r\nall organic beings have arisen through the actions of natural causes, which\r\nwe have that all the structural complexities of the Earth's crust have\r\narisen through the actions of natural causes. Between the known\r\nmodifications undergone by organisms, and the totality of modifications\r\ndisplayed in their structures, there is no greater disproportion than\r\nbetween the observed geological changes, and the totality of geological\r\nchanges supposed to have been similarly caused. Here and there are\r\nsedimentary deposits now slowly taking place. At this place a shore has\r\nbeen greatly encroached on by the sea during recorded times; and at another\r\nplace an estuary has become shallower within some generations. In one\r\nregion an upheaval is going on at the rate of a few feet in a century;\r\nwhile in another region occasional earthquakes cause slight variations of\r\nlevel. Appreciable amounts of denudation by water are visible in some\r\nlocalities; and in other localities glaciers are detected in the act of\r\ngrinding down the rocky surfaces over which they glide. But these changes\r\nare infinitesimal compared with the aggregate of changes to which the\r\nEarth's crust testifies, even in its still extant systems of strata. If,\r\nthen, the small changes now being wrought on the Earth's crust by natural\r\nagencies, yield warrant for concluding that by such agencies acting through\r\nvast epochs, all the structural complexities of the Earth's crust have been\r\nproduced; do not the small known modifications produced in races of\r\norganisms by natural agencies, yield warrant for concluding that by natural\r\nagencies have been produced all those structural complexities which we see\r\nin them?\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of Evolution then, has direct support from facts which,\r\nthough small in amount, are of the kind required; and the ratio which these\r\nfacts bear to the generalization based on them, seems as great as is the\r\nratio between facts and generalization which, in another case, produces\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 120. Let us put ourselves for a moment in the position of those who, from\r\ntheir experiences of human modes of action, draw differences respecting the\r\nmode of action of that Ultimate Power manifested to us through phenomena.\r\nWe shall find the supposition that each kind of organism was separately\r\ndesigned and put together, to be much less consistent with their professed\r\nconception of this Ultimate Power, than is the supposition that all kinds\r\nof organisms have resulted from one unbroken process. Irregularity of\r\nmethod is a mark of weakness. Uniformity of method is a mark of strength.\r\nContinual interposition to alter a pre-arranged set of actions, implies\r\ndefective arrangement in those actions. The maintenance of those actions,\r\nand the working out by them of the highest results, implies completeness of\r\narrangement. If human workmen, whose machines as at first constructed\r\nrequire perpetual adjustment, show their increasing skill by making their\r\nmachines self-adjusting; then, those who figure to themselves the\r\nproduction of the world and its inhabitants by a \"Great Artificer,\" must\r\nadmit that the achievement of this end by a persistent process, adapted to\r\nall contingencies, implies greater skill than its achievement by the\r\nprocess of meeting the contingencies as they severally arise.\r\n\r\nSo, too, it is with the contrast under its moral aspect. We saw that to the\r\nhypothesis of special creations, a difficulty is presented by the absence\r\nof high forms of life during immeasurable epochs of the Earth's existence.\r\nBut to the hypothesis of evolution, absence of them is no such obstacle.\r\nSuppose evolution, and this question is necessarily excluded. Suppose\r\nspecial creations, and this question can have no satisfactory answer. Still\r\nmore marked is the contrast between the two hypotheses, in presence of that\r\nvast amount of suffering entailed on all orders of sentient beings by their\r\nimperfect adaptations to their conditions of life, and the further vast\r\namount of suffering entailed on them by enemies and by parasites. We saw\r\nthat if organisms were severally designed for their respective places in\r\nNature, the inevitable conclusion is that these innumerable kinds of\r\ninferior organisms which prey on superior organisms, were intended to\r\ninflict all the pain and mortality which results. But the hypothesis of\r\nevolution involves us in no such dilemma. Slowly, but surely, evolution\r\nbrings about an increasing amount of happiness. In all forms of\r\norganization there is a progressive adaptation, and a survival of the most\r\nadapted. If, in the uniform working out of the process, there are evolved\r\norganisms of low types which prey on those of higher types, the evils\r\ninflicted form but a deduction from the average benefits. The universal\r\nmultiplication of the most adapted must cause the spread of those superior\r\norganisms which, in one way or other, escape the invasions of the inferior;\r\nand so tends to produce a type less liable to the invasions of the\r\ninferior. Thus the evils accompanying evolution are ever being\r\nself-eliminated. Though there may arise the question--Why could they not\r\nhave been avoided? there does not arise the question--Why were they\r\ndeliberately inflicted? Whatever may be thought of them, it is clear that\r\nthey do not imply gratuitous malevolence.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 121. In all respects, then, the hypothesis of evolution contrasts\r\nfavourably with the hypothesis of special creation. It has arisen in\r\ncomparatively-instructed times and in the most cultivated class. It is one\r\nof those beliefs in the uniform concurrence of phenomena, which are\r\ngradually supplanting beliefs in their irregular and arbitrary concurrence;\r\nand it belongs to a genus of these beliefs which has of late been rapidly\r\nspreading. It is a definitely-conceivable hypothesis; being simply an\r\nextension to the organic world at large, of a conception framed from our\r\nexperiences of individual organisms; just as the hypothesis of universal\r\ngravitation was an extension of the conception which our experiences of\r\nterrestrial gravitation had produced. This definitely-conceivable\r\nhypothesis, besides the support of numerous analogies, has the support of\r\ndirect evidence. We have proof that there is going on a process of the kind\r\nalleged; and though the results of this process, as actually witnessed, are\r\nminute in comparison with the totality of results ascribed to it, yet they\r\nbear to such totality a ratio as great as that by which an analogous\r\nhypothesis is justified. Lastly, that sentiment which the doctrine of\r\nspecial creations is thought necessary to satisfy, is much better satisfied\r\nby the doctrine of evolution; since this doctrine raises no contradictory\r\nimplications respecting the Unknown Cause, such as are raised by the\r\nantagonist doctrine.\r\n\r\nAnd now, having observed how, under its most general aspects, the\r\nhypothesis of organic evolution commends itself to us by its derivation, by\r\nits coherence, by its analogies, by its direct evidence, by its\r\nimplications; let us go on to consider the several orders of facts which\r\nyield indirect support to it. We will begin by noting the harmonies between\r\nit and sundry of the inductions set forth in Part II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE ARGUMENTS FROM CLASSIFICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 122. In § 103, we saw that the relations which exist among the species,\r\ngenera, orders, and classes of organisms, are not interpretable as results\r\nof any such causes as have usually been assigned. We will here consider\r\nwhether they are interpretable as the results of evolution. Let us first\r\ncontemplate some familiar facts.\r\n\r\nThe Norwegians, Swedes, Danes, Germans, Dutch, and Anglo-Saxons, form\r\ntogether a group of Scandinavian races, which are but slightly divergent in\r\ntheir characters. Welsh, Irish, and Highlanders, though they have\r\ndifferences, have not such differences as hide a decided community of\r\nnature: they are classed together as Celts. Between the Scandinavian race\r\nas a whole and the Celtic race as a whole, there is a distinction greater\r\nthan that between the sub-divisions which make up the one or the other.\r\nSimilarly, the several peoples inhabiting Southern Europe are more nearly\r\nallied to one another, than the aggregate they form is allied to the\r\naggregates of Northern peoples. If, again, we compare these European\r\nvarieties of Man, taken as a group, with that group of Eastern varieties\r\nwhich had a common origin with it, we see a stronger contrast than between\r\nthe groups of European varieties themselves. And once more, ethnologists\r\nfind differences of still higher importance between the Aryan stock as a\r\nwhole and the Mongolian stock as a whole, or the Negro stock as a whole.\r\nThough these contrasts are partially obscured by intermixtures, they are\r\nnot so much obscured as to hide the truths that the most-nearly-allied\r\nvarieties of Man are those which diverged from one another at\r\ncomparatively-recent periods; that each group of nearly-allied varieties is\r\nmore strongly contrasted with other such groups that had a common origin\r\nwith it at a remoter period; and so on until we come to the largest groups,\r\nwhich are the most strongly contrasted, and of whose divergence no trace is\r\nextant.\r\n\r\nThe relations existing among the classes and sub-classes of languages, have\r\nbeen briefly referred to by Mr. Darwin in illustration of his argument. We\r\nknow that languages have arisen by evolution. Let us then see what grouping\r\nof them evolution has produced. On comparing the dialects of adjacent\r\ncounties in England, we find that their differences are so small as\r\nscarcely to distinguish them. Between the dialects of the Northern counties\r\ntaken together, and those of the Southern counties taken together, the\r\ncontrast is stronger. These clusters of dialects, together with those of\r\nScotland and Ireland, are nevertheless so similar that we regard them as\r\none language. The several languages of Scandinavian Europe, including\r\nEnglish, are much more unlike one another than are the several dialects\r\nwhich each of them includes; in correspondence with the fact that they\r\ndiverged from one another at earlier periods than did their respective\r\ndialects. The Scandinavian languages have nevertheless a certain community\r\nof character, distinguishing them as a group from the languages of Southern\r\nEurope; between which there are general and special affinities that\r\nsimilarly unite them into a group formed of sub-groups containing\r\nsub-sub-groups. And this wider divergence between the order of languages\r\nspoken in Northern Europe and the order of languages spoken in Southern\r\nEurope, answers to the longer time that has elapsed since their\r\ndifferentiation commenced. Further, these two orders of modern European\r\nlanguages, as well as Latin and Greek and certain extinct and spoken\r\nlanguages of the East, are shown to have traits in common which unite them\r\ninto one great class known as Aryan languages; radically distinguished from\r\nthe classes of languages spoken by the other main divisions of the human\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 123. Now this kind of subordination of groups which we see arises in the\r\ncourse of continuous descent, multiplication, and divergence, is just the\r\nkind of subordination of groups which plants and animals exhibit: it is\r\njust the kind of subordination which has thrust itself on the attention of\r\nnaturalists in spite of pre-conceptions.\r\n\r\nThe original idea was that of arrangement in linear order. We saw that even\r\nafter a considerable acquaintance with the structures of organisms had been\r\nacquired, naturalists continued their efforts to reconcile the facts with\r\nthe notion of a uni-serial succession. The accumulation of evidence\r\nnecessitated the breaking up of the imagined chain into groups and\r\nsub-groups. Gradually there arose the conviction that these groups do not\r\nadmit of being placed in a line. And the conception finally arrived at, is\r\nthat of certain great sub-kingdoms, very widely divergent, each made up of\r\nclasses much less divergent, severally containing orders still less\r\ndivergent; and so on with genera and species.\r\n\r\nHence this \"grand fact in natural history of the subordination of group\r\nunder group, which from its familiarity does not always sufficiently strike\r\nus,\" is perfectly in harmony with the hypothesis of evolution. The extreme\r\nsignificance of this kind of relation among organic forms is dwelt on by\r\nMr. Darwin, who shows how an ordinary genealogical tree represents, on a\r\nsmall scale, a system of grouping analogous to that which exists among\r\norganisms in general, and which is explained on the supposition of a\r\ngenealogical tree by which all organisms are affiliated. If, wherever we\r\ncan trace direct descent, multiplication, and divergence, this formation of\r\ngroups within groups takes place; there results a strong presumption that\r\nthe groups within groups which constitute the animal and vegetal kingdoms,\r\nhave arisen by direct descent, multiplication, and divergence--that is, by\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 124. Strong confirmation of this inference is yielded by the fact, that\r\nthe more marked differences which divide groups are, in both cases,\r\ndistinguished from the less marked differences which divide sub-groups, by\r\nthis, that they are not simply greater in _degree_, but they are more\r\nradical in _kind_. Objects, as the stars, may present themselves in small\r\nclusters, which are again more or less aggravated into clusters of\r\nclusters, in such manner that the individuals of each simple cluster are\r\nmuch closer together than are the simple clusters gathered into a compound\r\ncluster: in which case, the trait that unites groups of groups differs from\r\nthe trait that unites groups, not in _nature_ but only in _amount_. But\r\nthis is not so either with the groups and sub-groups which we know have\r\nresulted from evolution, or with those which we here infer have resulted\r\nfrom evolution. In both cases the highest or most general classes, are\r\nmarked off from one another by fundamental differences that have no common\r\nmeasure with the differences that mark off small classes. Observe the\r\nparallelism.\r\n\r\nWe saw that each sub-kingdom of animals is distinguished from other\r\nsub-kingdoms, by some unlikeness in its main plan of organization; such as\r\nthe presence or absence of a peri-visceral cavity. Contrariwise, the\r\nmembers of the smallest groups are united together, and separated from the\r\nmembers of other small groups, by modifications which do not affect the\r\nrelations of essential parts. That this is just the kind of arrangement\r\nwhich results from evolution, the case of languages will show.\r\n\r\nOn comparing the dialects spoken in different parts of England, we find\r\nscarcely any difference but those of pronunciation: the structures of the\r\nsentences are almost uniform. Between English and the allied modern\r\nlanguages there are divergences of structure: there are some unlikenesses\r\nof idiom; some unlikenesses in the ways of modifying the meanings of verbs;\r\nand considerable unlikenesses in the uses of genders. But these\r\nunlikenesses are not sufficient to hide a general community of\r\norganization. A greater contrast of structure exists between these modern\r\nlanguages of Western Europe, and the classic languages. Differentiation\r\ninto abstract and concrete elements, which is shown by the substitution of\r\nauxiliary words for inflections, has produced a higher specialization,\r\ndistinguishing these languages as a group from the older languages.\r\nNevertheless, both the ancient and modern languages of Europe, together\r\nwith some Eastern languages derived from the same original, have, under all\r\ntheir differences of organization, a fundamental likeness; since in all of\r\nthem words are formed by such a coalescence and integration of roots as\r\ndestroys the independent meanings of the roots. These Aryan languages, and\r\nothers which have the _amalgamate_ character, are united by it into a class\r\ndistinguished from the _aptotic_ and _agglutinate_ languages; in which the\r\nroots are either not united at all, or so incompletely united that one of\r\nthem still retains its independent meaning. And philologists find that\r\nthese radical traits which severally determine the grammatical forms, or\r\nmodes of combining ideas, characterize the primary divisions among\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\nSo that among languages, where we know that evolution has been going on,\r\nthe greatest groups are marked off from one another by the strongest\r\nstructural contrasts; and as the like holds among groups of organisms,\r\nthere results a further reason for inferring that these have been evolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 125. There is yet another parallelism of like meaning. We saw (§ 101)\r\nthat the successively-subordinate groups--classes, orders, genera, and\r\nspecies--into which zoologists and botanists segregate animals and plants,\r\nhave not, in reality, those definite values conventionally given to them.\r\nThere are well-marked species, and species so imperfectly marked that some\r\nsystematists regard them as varieties. Between genera strong contrasts\r\nexist in many cases, and in other cases contrasts so much less decided as\r\nto leave it doubtful whether they imply generic distinctions. So, too, is\r\nit with orders and classes: in some of which there have been introduced\r\nsub-divisions, having no equivalents in others. Even of the sub-kingdoms\r\nthe same truth holds. The contrast between the _Coelenterata_ and the\r\n_Mollusca_, is far less than that between the _Coelenterata_ and the\r\n_Vertebrata_.\r\n\r\nNow just this same indefiniteness of value, or incompleteness of\r\nequivalence, is observable in those simple and compound and re-compound\r\ngroups which we see arising by evolution. In every case the endeavour to\r\narrange the divergent products of evolution, is met by a difficulty like\r\nthat which would meet the endeavour to classify the branches of a tree,\r\ninto branches of the first, second, third, fourth, &c., orders--the\r\ndifficulty, namely, that branches of intermediate degrees of composition\r\nexist. The illustration furnished by languages will serve us once more.\r\nSome dialects of English are but little contrasted; others are strongly\r\ncontrasted. The alliances of the several Scandinavian tongues with one\r\nanother are different in degree. Dutch is much less distinct from German\r\nthan Swedish is; while between Danish and Swedish there is so close a\r\nkinship that they might almost be regarded as widely-divergent dialects.\r\nSimilarly on comparing the larger divisions, we see that the various\r\nlanguages of the Aryan stock have deviated from their original to very\r\nunlike distances. The general conclusion is manifest. While the kinds of\r\nhuman speech fall into groups, and sub-groups, and sub-sub-groups; yet the\r\ngroups are not equal to one another in value, nor have the sub-groups equal\r\nvalues, nor the sub-sub-groups.\r\n\r\nIf, then, when classified, organisms fall into assemblages such that those\r\nof the same grade are but indefinitely equivalent; and if, where evolution\r\nis known to have taken place, there have arisen assemblages between which\r\nthe equivalence is similarly indefinite; there is additional reason for\r\ninferring that organisms are products of evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 126. A fact of much significance remains. If groups of organic forms have\r\narisen by divergence and re-divergence; and if, while the groups have been\r\ndeveloping from simple groups into compound groups, each group and\r\nsub-group has been giving origin to more complex forms of its own type;\r\nthen it is inferable that there once existed greater structural likenesses\r\nbetween the members of allied groups than exists now. This, speaking\r\ngenerally, proves to be so.\r\n\r\nBetween the sub-kingdoms the gaps are extremely wide; but such distant\r\nkinships as may be discerned, bear out anticipation. Thus in the formation\r\nof the germinal layers there is a general agreement among them; and there\r\nis a further agreement among sundry of them in the formation of a gastrula.\r\nThis simplest and earliest likeness, significant of primitive kinship, is\r\nin most cases soon obscured by divergent modes of development; but sundry\r\nsub-kingdoms continue to show relationships by the likenesses of their\r\nlarval forms; as we see in the trochophores of the _Polyzoa_, _Annelida_,\r\nand _Mollusca_--sub-kingdoms the members of which by their later structural\r\nchanges are rendered widely unlike.\r\n\r\nMore decided approximations exist between the lower members of classes. In\r\ntracing down the _Crustacea_ and the _Arachnida_ from their more complex to\r\ntheir simpler forms, zoologists meet with difficulties: respecting some of\r\nthese simpler forms, it becomes a question which class they belong to. The\r\n_Lepidosiren_, about which there have been disputes whether it is a fish or\r\nan amphibian, is inferior, in the organization of its skeleton, to the\r\ngreat majority of both fishes and amphibia. Widely as they differ from\r\nthem, the lower mammals have some characters in common with birds, which\r\nthe higher mammals do not possess.\r\n\r\nNow since this kind of relationship of groups is not accounted for by any\r\nother hypothesis, while the hypothesis of evolution gives us a clue to it;\r\nwe must include it among the supports of this hypothesis which the facts of\r\nclassification furnish.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 127. What shall we say of these leading truths when taken together? That\r\nnaturalists have been gradually compelled to arrange organisms in groups\r\nwithin groups, and that this is the arrangement which we see arises by\r\ndescent, alike in individual families and among races of men, is a striking\r\ncircumstance. That while the smallest groups are the most nearly related,\r\nthere exist between the great sub-kingdoms, structural contrasts of the\r\nprofoundest kind, cannot but impress us as remarkable, when we see that\r\nwhere it is known to take place evolution actually produces these\r\nfeebly-distinguished small groups, and these strongly-distinguished great\r\ngroups. The impression made by these two parallelisms, which add meaning to\r\neach other, is deepened by the third parallelism, which enforces the\r\nmeaning of both--the parallelism, namely, that as, between the species,\r\ngenera, orders, classes, &c., which naturalists have formed, there are\r\ntransitional types; so between the groups, sub-groups, and sub-sub-groups,\r\nwhich we know to have been evolved, types of intermediate values exist. And\r\nthese three correspondences between the known results of evolution and the\r\nresults here ascribed to evolution, have further weight given to them by\r\nthe fact, that the kinship of groups through their lowest members is just\r\nthe kinship which the hypothesis of evolution implies.\r\n\r\nEven in the absence of these specific agreements, the broad fact of unity\r\namid multiformity, which organisms so strikingly display, is strongly\r\nsuggestive of evolution. Freeing ourselves from pre-conceptions, we shall\r\nsee good reason to think with Mr. Darwin, \"that propinquity of descent--the\r\nonly known cause of the similarity of organic beings--is the bond, hidden\r\nas it is by various degrees of modification, which is partly revealed to us\r\nby our classifications.\" When we consider that this only known cause of\r\nsimilarity, joined with the only known cause of divergence (the influence\r\nof conditions), gives us a key to these likenesses obscured by\r\nunlikenesses; we shall see that were there none of those remarkable\r\nharmonies above pointed out, the truths of classification would still yield\r\nstrong support to our conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE ARGUMENTS FROM EMBRYOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 127a. Already I have emphasized the truth that Nature is always more\r\ncomplex than we suppose (§ 74a)--that there are complexities within\r\ncomplexities. Here we find illustrated this truth under another aspect.\r\nWhen seeking to formulate the arguments from Embryology, we are shown that\r\nthe facts as presented in Nature are not to be expressed in the simple\r\ngeneralizations we at first make.\r\n\r\nWhile we recognize this truth we must also recognize the truth that only by\r\nenunciation and acceptance of imperfect generalizations can we progress to\r\nperfect ones. The order of Evolution is conformed to by ideas as by other\r\nthings. The advance is, and must be, from the indefinite to the definite.\r\nIt is impossible to express the totality of any natural phenomenon in a\r\nsingle proposition. To the primary statement expressing that which is most\r\ndominant have to be added secondary statements qualifying it. We see this\r\neven in so simple a case as the flight of a projectile. The young artillery\r\nofficer is first taught that a cannon-shot describes a curve treated as a\r\nparabola, though literally part of an extremely eccentric ellipse not\r\ndistinguishable from a parabola. Presently he learns that atmospheric\r\nresistance, causing a continual decrease of velocity, entails a deviation\r\nfrom that theoretical path which is calculated on the supposition that the\r\nvelocity is uniform; and this incorrectness he has to allow for. Then,\r\nfurther, there comes the lateral deviation due to wind, which may be\r\nappreciable if the wind is strong and the range great. To introduce him all\r\nat once to the correct conception thus finally reached would be impossible:\r\nit has to be reached through successive qualifications. And that which\r\nholds even in this simple case necessarily holds more conspicuously in\r\ncomplex cases.\r\n\r\nThe title of the chapter suggests a metaphor, which is, indeed, something\r\nmore than a metaphor. There is an embryology of conceptions. That this\r\nstatement is not wholly a figure of speech, we shall see on considering\r\nthat cerebral organization is a part of organization at large; and that the\r\nevolving nervous plexus which is the correlative of an evolving conception,\r\nmust conform to the general law of change conformed to in the evolution of\r\nthe whole nervous structure as well as in the evolution of the whole bodily\r\nstructure. As the body has at first a rude form, very remotely suggesting\r\nthat which is presently developed by the superposing of modifications on\r\nmodifications; so the brain as a whole and its contained ideas together\r\nmake up an inner world answering with extreme indefiniteness to that outer\r\nworld to which it is brought by successive approximations into tolerable\r\ncorrespondence; and so any nervous plexus and its associated hypothesis,\r\nwhich refer to some external group of phenomena under investigation, have\r\nto reach their final developments by successive corrections.\r\n\r\nThis being the course of discovery must also be the course of exposition.\r\nIn pursuance of this course we may therefore fitly contemplate that early\r\n_formula_ of embryological development which we owe to von Baer.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 128. Already in § 52, where the generalization of von Baer respecting the\r\nrelations of embryos was set forth, there was given the warning, above\r\nrepeated with greater distinctness, that it is only an adumbration.\r\n\r\nIn the words of his translator, he \"found that in its earliest stage, every\r\norganism has the greatest number of characters in common with all other\r\norganisms in their earliest stages; that at a stage somewhat later, its\r\nstructure is like the structures displayed at corresponding phases by a\r\nless extensive multitude of organisms; that at each subsequent stage,\r\ntraits are acquired which successively distinguished the developing embryo\r\nfrom groups of embryos that it previously resembled--thus step by step\r\ndiminishing the class of embryos which it still resembles; and that thus\r\nthe class of similar forms is finally narrowed to the species of which it\r\nis a member.\"\r\n\r\nAssuming for a moment that this generalization is true as it stands, or\r\nrather, assuming that the qualifications needed are not such as destroy its\r\ncorrespondence with the average facts, we shall see that it has profound\r\nsignificance. For if we follow out in thought the implications--if we\r\nconceive the germs of all kinds of organisms simultaneously developing, and\r\nimagine that after taking their first step together, at the second step one\r\nhalf of the vast multitude diverges from the other half; if, at the next\r\nstep, we mentally watch the parts of each great assemblage beginning to\r\ntake two or more routes of development; if we represent to ourselves such\r\nbifurcations going on, stage after stage, in all the branches; we shall see\r\nthat there must result an aggregate analogous, in its arrangement of parts,\r\nto a tree. If this vast genealogical tree be contemplated as a whole, made\r\nup of trunk, main branches, secondary branches, and so on as far as the\r\nterminal twigs; it will be perceived that all the various kinds of\r\norganisms represented by these terminal twigs, forming the periphery of the\r\ntree, will stand related to one another in small groups, which are united\r\ninto groups of groups, and so on. The embryological tree, expressing the\r\ndevelopmental relations of organisms, will be similar to the tree which\r\nsymbolizes their classificatory relations. That subordination of classes,\r\norders, genera, and species, to which naturalists have been gradually led,\r\nis just that subordination which results from the divergence and\r\nre-divergence of embryos, as they all unfold. On the hypothesis of\r\nevolution this parallelism has a meaning--indicates that primordial kinship\r\nof all organisms, and that progressive differentiation of them, which the\r\nhypothesis alleges. But on any other hypothesis the parallelism is\r\nmeaningless; or rather, it raises a difficulty; since it implies either an\r\neffect without a cause or a design without a purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 129. This conception of a tree, symbolizing the relationships of types\r\nand a species derived from the same root, has a concomitant conception. The\r\nimplication is that each organism, setting out from the simple nucleated\r\ncell, must in the course of its development follow the line of the trunk,\r\nsome main branch, some sub-branch, some sub-sub-branch, &c., of this\r\nembryological tree; and so on till it reaches that ultimate twig\r\nrepresenting the species of which it is a member. It must in a general way\r\ngo through the particular line of forms which preceded it in all past\r\ntimes: there must be what has been aptly called a \"recapitulation\" of the\r\nsuccessive ancestral structures. This, at least, is the conclusion\r\nnecessitated by the generalization we are considering under its original\r\ncrude form.\r\n\r\nVon Baer lived in the days when the Development Hypothesis was mentioned\r\nonly to be ridiculed, and he joined in the ridicule. What he conceived to\r\nbe the meaning of these groupings of organisms and these relations among\r\ntheir embryological histories, is not obvious. The only alternative to the\r\nhypothesis of Evolution is the hypothesis of Special Creation; and as he\r\ndid not accept the one it is inferable that he accepted the other. But if\r\nhe did this he must in the first place have found no answer to the inquiry\r\nwhy organisms specially created should have the embryological kinships he\r\ndescribed. And in the second place, after discovering that his alleged law\r\nwas traversed by many and various nonconformities, he would have been\r\nwithout any explanation of these. Observe the positions which were open to\r\nhim and the reasons which show them to be untenable.\r\n\r\nIf it be said that the conditions of the case necessitated the derivation\r\nof all organisms from simple germs, and therefore necessitated a\r\nmorphological unity in their primitive states; there arises the obvious\r\nanswer, that the morphological unity thus implied, is not the only\r\nmorphological unity to be accounted for. Were this the only unity, the\r\nvarious kinds of organisms, setting out from a common primordial form,\r\nshould all begin from the first to diverge individually, as so many radii\r\nfrom a centre; which they do not. If, otherwise, it be said that organisms\r\nwere framed upon certain types, and that those of the same type continue\r\ndeveloping together in the same direction, until it is time for them to\r\nbegin putting on their specialities of structure; then the answer is, that\r\nwhen they do finally diverge they ought severally to develop in direct\r\nlines towards their final forms. No reason can be assigned why, having\r\nparted company, some should progress towards their final forms by irregular\r\nor circuitous routes. On the hypothesis of design such deviations are\r\ninexplicable.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of evolution, however, while it pre-supposes those kinships\r\namong embryos in their early forms which are found to exist, also leads us\r\nto expect nonconformities in their courses of development. If, as any\r\nrational theory of evolution implies, the progressive differentiations of\r\ntypes from one another during past times, have resulted from the direct and\r\nindirect effects of external conditions--if races of organisms have become\r\ndifferent, either by immediate adaptations to unlike habits of life, or by\r\nthe mediate adaptations resulting from preservation of the individuals most\r\nfitted for such habits of life, or by both; and if most embryonic changes\r\nare significant of changes that were undergone by ancestral races; then\r\nthese irregularities must be anticipated. For the successive changes in\r\nmodes of life pursued by successive ancestral races, can have had no\r\nregularity of sequence. In some cases they must have been more numerous\r\nthan in others; in some cases they must have been greater in degree than in\r\nothers; in some cases they must have been to simpler modes, in some cases\r\nto more complex modes, and in some cases to modes neither higher nor lower.\r\nOf two cognate races which diverged in the remote past, the one may have\r\nhad descendants that have remained tolerably constant in their habits,\r\nwhile the other may have had descendants that have passed through\r\nwidely-aberrant modes of life; and yet some of these last may have\r\neventually taken to modes of life like those of the other races derived\r\nfrom the same stock. And if the metamorphoses of embryos indicate, in a\r\ngeneral way, the changes of structure undergone by ancestors; then, the\r\nlater embryologic changes of such two allied races will be somewhat\r\ndifferent, though they may end in very similar forms. An illustration will\r\nmake this clear. Mr. Darwin says: \"Petrels are the most aërial and oceanic\r\nof birds, but in the quiet sounds of Tierra del Fuego, the _Puffinuria\r\nberardi_, in its general habits, in its astonishing power of diving, its\r\nmanner of swimming, and of flying when unwillingly it takes flight, would\r\nbe mistaken by any one for an auk or grebe; nevertheless, it is essentially\r\na petrel, but with many parts of its organization profoundly modified.\" Now\r\nif we suppose these grebe-like habits to be continued through a long epoch,\r\nthe petrel-form to be still more obscured, and the approximation to the\r\ngrebe-form still closer; it is manifest that while the chicks of the grebe\r\nand the _Puffinuria_ will, during their early stages of development,\r\ndisplay that likeness involved by their common derivation from some early\r\ntype of bird, the chick of the _Puffinuria_ will eventually begin to show\r\ndeviations, representative of the ancestral petrel-structure, and will\r\nafterwards begin to lose these distinctions and assume the grebe-structure.\r\n\r\nHence, remembering the perpetual intrusions of organisms on one another's\r\nmodes of life, often widely different; and remembering that these\r\nintrusions have been going on from the beginning; we shall be prepared to\r\nfind that the general law of embryonic parallelism is qualified by\r\nirregularities which are mostly small, in many cases considerable, and\r\noccasionally great. The hypothesis of evolution accounts for these: it does\r\nmore--it implies the necessity of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 130. The substitutions of organs and the suppressions of organs, are\r\namong those secondary embryological phenomena which harmonize with the\r\nbelief in evolution but cannot be reconciled with any other belief. Some\r\nembryos, during early stages of development, possess organs that afterwards\r\ndwindle away, as there arise other organs to discharge the same functions.\r\nAnd in other embryos organs make their appearance, grow to certain points,\r\nhave no functions to discharge, and disappear by absorption.\r\n\r\nWe have a remarkable instance of substitution in the temporary appliances\r\nfor respiration, which some embryos exhibit. During the first phase of its\r\ndevelopment, the mammalian embryo possesses a system of blood-vessels\r\ndistributed over what is called the _area vasculosa_--a system of vessels\r\nhomologous with one which, among fishes, serves for aërating the blood\r\nuntil the permanent respiratory organs come into play. Now since this\r\nsystem of blood-vessels, not being in proximity to an oxygenated medium,\r\ncannot be serviceable to the mammalian embryo during development of the\r\nlungs, as it is serviceable in the embryo-fish during development of the\r\ngills, this needless formation of it is unaccountable as a result of\r\ndesign. But it is quite congruous with the supposition that the mammalian\r\ntype arose out of lower vertebrate types. For in such case the mammalian\r\nembryo, passing through states representing in a general way those which\r\nits remote ancestors had in common with the lower _Vertebrata_, develops\r\nthis system of vessels in like manner with them. An instance more\r\nsignificant still is furnished by certain _Amphibia_. One of the facts\r\nearly made familiar to the natural-history student is that the tadpole\r\nbreathes by external branchiæ, and that these, needful during its aquatic\r\nlife, dwindle away as fast as it develops the lungs fitting it for\r\nterrestrial life. But in one of the higher _Amphibia_, the viviparous\r\nSalamander, these transformations ordinarily undergone during the free life\r\nof the larva, are undergone by the embryo in the egg. The branchiæ are\r\ndeveloped though there is no use for them: lungs being substituted as\r\nbreathing appliances before the creature is born.\r\n\r\nEven more striking than the substitutions of organs are the suppressions of\r\norgans. Mr. Darwin names some cases as \"extremely curious; for instance,\r\nthe presence of teeth in foetal whales, which when grown up have not a\r\ntooth in their heads;... It has even been stated on good authority that\r\nrudiments of teeth can be detected in the beaks of certain embryonic\r\nbirds.\" Irreconcilable with any teleological theory, these facts do not\r\neven harmonize with the theory of fixed types which are maintained by the\r\ndevelopment of all the typical parts, even where not wanted; seeing that\r\nthe disappearance of these incipient organs during foetal life spoils the\r\ntypical resemblance. But while to other hypotheses these facts are\r\nstumbling-blocks, they yield strong support to the hypothesis of evolution.\r\n\r\nAllied to these cases, are the cases of what has been called retrograde\r\ndevelopment. Many parasitic creatures and creatures which, after leading\r\nactive lives for a time, become fixed, lose, in their adult states, the\r\nlimbs and senses they had when young. It may be alleged, however, that\r\nthese creatures could not secure the habitats needful for them, without\r\npossessing, during their larval stages, eyes and swimming appendages which\r\neventually become useless; that though, by losing these, their organization\r\nretrogresses in one direction, it progresses in another direction; and\r\nthat, therefore, they do not exhibit the needless development of a higher\r\ntype on the way to a lower type. Nevertheless there are instances of a\r\ndescent in organization, following an apparently-superfluous ascent. Mr.\r\nDarwin says that in some genera of cirripedes, \"the larvæ become developed\r\neither into hermaphrodites having the ordinary structure, or into what I\r\nhave called complemental males, and in the latter, the development has\r\nassuredly been retrograde; for the male is a mere sack, which lives for a\r\nshort time, and is destitute of mouth, stomach, or other organ of\r\nimportance, excepting for reproduction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 130a. But now let us contemplate more closely the energies at work in the\r\nunfolding embryo, or rather the energies which the facts appear to imply.\r\n\r\nWhatever natures we ascribe to the hypothetical units proper to each kind\r\nof organism, we must conclude that from the beginning of embryonic\r\ndevelopment, they have a proclivity towards the structure of that organism.\r\nBecause of their phylogenetic origin, they must tend towards the form of\r\nthe primitive type; but the superposed modifications, conflicting with\r\ntheir initial tendency, must cause a swerving towards each successively\r\nhigher type. To take an illustration:--If in the germ-plasm out of which\r\nwill come a vertebrate animal there is a proclivity towards the primitive\r\npiscine form, there must, if the germ-plasm is derived from a mammal, be\r\nalso from the outset a proclivity towards the mammalian form. While the\r\ninitial type tends continually to establish itself the terminal type tends\r\nalso to establish itself. The intermediate structures must be influenced by\r\ntheir conflict, as well as by the conflict of each with the proclivities\r\ntowards the amphibian and reptilian types. This complication of tendencies\r\nis increased by the intervention of several other factors.\r\n\r\nThere is the factor of economy. An embryo in which the transformations have\r\nabsorbed the smallest amount of energy and wasted the smallest amount of\r\nmatter, will have an advantage over embryos the transformations of which\r\nhave cost more in energy and matter: the young animal will set out with a\r\ngreater surplus of vitality, and will be more likely than others to live\r\nand propagate. Again, in the embryos of its descendants, inheriting the\r\ntendency to economical transformation, those which evolve at the least cost\r\nwill thrive more than the rest and be more likely to have posterity. Thus\r\nwill result a continual shortening of the processes. We can see alike that\r\nthis must take place and that it does take place. If the whole series of\r\nphylogenetic changes had to be repeated--if the embryo mammal had to become\r\na complete fish, and then a complete amphibian, and then a complete\r\nreptile, there would be an immense amount of superfluous building up and\r\npulling down, entailing great waste of time and of materials. Evidently\r\nthese abridgments which economy entails, necessitate that unfolding embryos\r\nbear but rude resemblances to lower types ancestrally passed\r\nthrough--vaguely represent their dominant traits only.\r\n\r\nFrom this principle of economy arise several derivative principles, which\r\nmay be best dealt with separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 130b. In some cases the substitution of an abridged for an unabridged\r\ncourse of evolution causes the entire disappearance of certain intermediate\r\nforms. Structural arrangements once passed through during the unfolding are\r\ndropped out of the series.\r\n\r\nIn the evolution of these embryos with which there is not laid up a large\r\namount of food-yolk there occurs at the outset a striking omission of this\r\nkind. When, by successive fissions, the fertilized cell has given rise to a\r\ncluster of cells constituting a hollow sphere, known as a _blastula_, the\r\nnext change under its original form is the introversion of one side, so as\r\nto produce two layers in place of one. An idea of the change may be\r\nobtained by taking an india-rubber ball (having a hole through which the\r\nair may escape) and thrusting in one side until its anterior surface\r\ntouches the interior surface of the other side. If the cup-shaped structure\r\nresulting be supposed to have its wide opening gradually narrowed, until it\r\nbecomes the mouth of an internal chamber, it will represent what is known\r\nas a _gastrula_--a double layer of cells, of which the outer is called\r\nepiblast and the inner hypoblast (answering to ectoderm and endoderm)\r\ninclosing a cavity known as the _archenteron_, or primitive digestive sac.\r\nBut now in place of this original mode of forming the _gastrula_, there\r\noccurs a mode known as delamination. Throughout its whole extent the single\r\nlayer splits so as to become a double layer--one sphere of cells inclosing\r\nthe other; and after this direct formation of the double layer there is a\r\ndirect formation of an opening through it into the internal cavity. There\r\nis thus a shortening of the primitive process: a number of changes are left\r\nout.\r\n\r\nOften a kindred passing over of stages at later periods of development may\r\nbe observed. In certain of the _Mollusca_, as the _Patella chiton_, the egg\r\ngives origin to a free-swimming larva known as a trochosphere, from which\r\npresently comes the ordinary molluscous organization. In the highest\r\ndivision of the Molluscs, however, the Cephalopods, no trochosphere is\r\nformed. The nutritive matter laid up in the egg is used in building up the\r\nyoung animal without any indication of an ancestral larva.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 130c. Among principles derived from the principle of economy is the\r\nprinciple of pre-adaptation--a name which we may appropriately coin to\r\nindicate an adaptation made in advance of the time at which it could have\r\narisen in the course of phylogenetic history.\r\n\r\nHow pre-adaptation may result from economy will be shown by an illustration\r\nwhich human methods of construction furnish. Let us assume that building\r\nhouses of a certain type has become an established habit, and that, as a\r\npart of each house, there is a staircase of given size. And suppose that in\r\nconsequence of changed conditions--say the walling in of the town, limiting\r\nthe internal space and increasing ground-rents--it becomes the policy to\r\nbuild houses of many stories, let out in flats to different tenants. For\r\nthe increased passing up and down, a staircase wider at its lower part will\r\nbe required. If now the builder, when putting up the ground floor, follows\r\nthe old dimensions, then after all the stories are built, the lower part of\r\nthe staircase, if it is to yield equal facilities for passage, must be\r\nreconstructed. Instead of a staircase adapted to those few stories which\r\nthe original type of house had, economy will dictate a pre-adaptation of\r\nthe staircase to the additional stories.\r\n\r\nOn carrying this idea with us, we shall see that if from some type of\r\norganism there is evolved a type in which enlargement of a certain part is\r\nneeded to meet increased functions, the greater size of this part will\r\nbegin to show itself during early stages of unfolding. That unbuilding and\r\nrebuilding which would be needful were it laid down of its original size,\r\nwill be made needless if from the beginning it is laid down of a larger\r\nsize. Hence, in successive generations, the greater prosperity and\r\nmultiplication of individuals in which this part is at the outset somewhat\r\nlarger than usual, must eventually establish a marked excess in its\r\ndevelopment at an early stage. The facts agree with this inference.\r\n\r\nReferring to the contrasts between embryos, Mr. Adam Sedgwick says that \"a\r\nspecies is distinct and distinguishable from its allies from the very\r\nearliest stages.\" Whereas, according to the law of von Baer, \"animals so\r\nclosely allied as the fowl and duck would be indistinguishable in the early\r\nstages of development,\" \"yet I can distinguish a fowl and a duck embryo on\r\nthe second day by the inspection of a single transverse section through the\r\ntrunk.\" This experience harmonizes with the statement of the late Prof.\r\nAgassiz, that in some cases traits characterizing the species appear at an\r\nearlier period than traits characterizing the genus.\r\n\r\nSimilar in their implications are the facts recently published by Dr. E.\r\nMehnert, concerning the feet of pentadactyle vertebrates. A leading example\r\nis furnished by the foot in the struthious birds. Out of the original five\r\ndigits the two which eventually become large while the others disappear,\r\nsoon give sign of their future predominance: their early sizes being in\r\nexcess of those required for the usual functional requirements in birds,\r\nand preparing the way for their special requirements in the struthious\r\nbirds. Dr. Mehnert shows that a like lesson is given by the relative\r\ndevelopments of legs and wings in these birds. Ordinarily in vertebrates\r\nthe fore limbs grow more rapidly than the hind limbs; but in the ostrich,\r\nin which the hind limbs or legs have to become so large while the wings are\r\nbut little wanted, the leg development goes in advance of the\r\nwing-development in early embryonic stages: there is a pre-adaptation.\r\n\r\nMuch more striking are examples furnished by creatures whose modes of\r\nexistence require that they shall have enormous fertility--require that the\r\ngenerative system shall be very large. Ordinarily the organs devoted to\r\nmaintenance of the race develop later than the organs devoted to\r\nmaintenance of the individual. But this order is inverted in certain\r\n_Entozoa_. To these creatures, imbedded in nutritive matters,\r\nself-maintenance cost nothing, and the structures devoted to it are\r\nrelatively of less importance than the structures devoted to\r\nrace-maintenance, which, to make up for the small chance any one germ has\r\nof getting into a fit habitat, have to produce immense numbers of germs.\r\nHere the rudiments of the generative systems are the first to become\r\nvisible--here, in virtue of the principle of pre-adaptation, a structure\r\nbelonging to the terminal form asserts itself so early in the developmental\r\nprocess as almost to obliterate the structure of the initial form.\r\n\r\nIt may be that in some cases where the growth of certain organs goes in\r\nadvance of the normal order, the element of time comes into play--the\r\ngreater time required for construction. To elucidate this let us revert to\r\nour simile. Suppose that the staircase above instanced, or at any rate its\r\nlower part, is required to be of marble with balusters finely carved. If\r\nthis piece of work is not promptly commenced and pushed on fast, it will\r\nnot be completed when the rest of the house is ready: workmen and tools\r\nwill still block it up at a time when it should be available. Similarly\r\namong the parts of an unfolding embryo, those in which there is a great\r\ndeal of constructive work must early take such shape as will allow of this.\r\nNow of all the tissues the nervous tissue is that which takes longest to\r\nrepair when injured; and it seems a not improbable inference that it is a\r\ntissue which is slower in its histological development than others. If this\r\nbe so, we may see why, in the embryos of the higher vertebrates, the\r\ncentral nervous system quickly grows large in comparison to the other\r\nsystems--why by pre-adaptation the brain of a chick develops in advance of\r\nother organs so much more than the brain of a fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 130d. Yet another complication has to be noted. From the principle of\r\neconomy, it seems inferable that decrease and disappearance of organs which\r\nwere useful in ancestral types but have ceased to be useful, should take\r\nplace uniformly; but they do not. In the words of Mr. Adam Sedgwick, \"some\r\nancestral organs persist in the embryo in a functionless rudimentary\r\n(vestigial) condition and at the same time without any reference to adult\r\nstructures, while other ancestral organs have disappeared without leaving a\r\ntrace.\"[46] This anomaly is rendered more striking when joined with the\r\nfact that some of the structures which remain conspicuous are relatively\r\nancient, while some which have been obliterated are relatively modern--_e.\r\ng._, \"gill slits [which date back to the fish-ancestor], have been retained\r\nin embryology, whereas other organs which have much more recently\r\ndisappeared, _e. g._ teeth of birds, fore-limbs of snakes [dating back to\r\nthe reptile ancestor], have been entirely lost.\"[47] Mr. Sedgwick ascribes\r\nthese anomalies to the difference between larval development and embryonic\r\ndevelopment, and expresses his general belief thus:--\r\n\r\n  \"The conclusion here reached is that, whereas larval development must\r\n  retain traces (it may be very faint) of ancestral stages of structure\r\n  because they are built out of ancestral stages, embryonic development\r\n  need not necessarily do so, and very often does not; that embryonic\r\n  development in so far as it is a record at all, is a record of structural\r\n  features of previous larval stages. Characters which disappear during\r\n  free life disappear also in the embryo, but characters which though lost\r\n  by the adult are retained in the larva may ultimately be absorbed into\r\n  the embryonic phase and leave their traces in embryonic development.\"[48]\r\n\r\nTo set forth the evidence justifying this view would encumber too much the\r\ngeneral argument. Towards elucidation of such irregularities let me name\r\ntwo factors which should I think be taken into account.\r\n\r\nAbridgment of embryonic stages cannot go on uniformly with all disused\r\norgans. Where an organ is of such size that progressive diminution of it\r\nwill appreciably profit the young animal, by leaving it a larger surplus of\r\nunused material, we may expect progressive diminution to occur.\r\nContrariwise, if the organ is relatively so small that each decrease will\r\nnot, by sensibly increasing the reserve of nutriment, give the young animal\r\nan advantage over others, decrease must not be looked for: there may be a\r\nsurvival of it even though of very ancient origin.\r\n\r\nAgain, the reduction of a superfluous part can take place only on condition\r\nthat the economy resulting from each descending variation of it, is of\r\ngreater importance than are the effects of variations simultaneously\r\noccurring in other parts. If by increase or decrease of any other parts of\r\nthe embryo, survival of the animal is furthered in a greater degree than by\r\ndecrease of this superfluous part, then such decrease is unlikely; since it\r\nis illegitimate to count upon the repeated concurrence of favourable\r\nvariations in two or more parts which are independent. So that if changes\r\nof an advantageous kind are going on elsewhere in the embryo a useless part\r\nmay remain long undiminished.\r\n\r\nYet another cause operates, and perhaps cooperates. Embryonic survival of\r\nan organ which has become functionless, may readily happen if, during\r\nsubsequent stages of development, parts of it are utilized as parts of\r\nother organs. In the words of Mr. J. T. Cunningham:--\r\n\r\n  \"It seems to be a general fact that a structure which in metamorphosis\r\n  disappears completely may easily be omitted altogether in embryonic\r\n  development, while one which is modified into something else continues to\r\n  pass more or less through its original larval condition.\" (_Science\r\n  Progress_, July, 1897, p. 488.)\r\n\r\nOne more factor of considerable importance should be taken into account. A\r\ndisused organ which entails evil because construction of it involves\r\nneedless cost, may entail further evil by being in the way. This, it seems\r\nto me, is the reason why the fore-limbs of snakes have disappeared from\r\ntheir embryos. When the long-bodied lizard out of which the ophidian type\r\nevolved, crept through stiff herbage, and moved its head from side to side\r\nto find openings, there resulted alternate bends of its body, which were\r\nthe beginnings of lateral undulations; and we may easily see that in\r\nproportion as it thus progressed by insinuating itself through interstices,\r\nthe fore-limbs, less and less used for walking, would be more and more in\r\nthe way; and the lengthening of the body, increasing the undulatory motion\r\nand decreasing the use of the fore-limbs, would eventually make them\r\nabsolute impediments. Hence besides the benefit in economy of construction\r\ngained by embryos in which the fore-limbs were in early stages a little\r\nless developed than usual, they would gain an advantage by having, when\r\nmature, smaller fore-limbs than usual, leading to greater facility of\r\nlocomotion. There would be a double set of influences causing, through\r\nselection, a comparatively rapid decrease of these appendages. And we may I\r\nthink see also, on contemplating the kind of movement, that the fore-limbs\r\nwould be more in the way than the hind limbs, which would consequently\r\ndwindle with such smaller rapidity as to make continuance of the rudiments\r\nof them comprehensible.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 131-132. So that while the embryonic law enunciated by von Baer is in\r\nharmony with the hypothesis of evolution, and is, indeed, a law which this\r\nhypothesis implies, the nonconformities to the law are also interpretable\r\nby this hypothesis.\r\n\r\nParallelism between the courses of development in species allied by remote\r\nancestry, is liable to be variously modified in correspondence with the\r\nlater ancestral forms passed through after divergence of such species. The\r\nsubstitution of a direct for an indirect process of formation, which we\r\nhave reason to believe will show itself, must obscure the embryonic\r\nhistory. And the principle of economy which leads to this substitution\r\nproduces effects that are very irregular and uncertain in consequence of\r\nthe endlessly varied conditions. Thus several causes conspire to produce\r\ndeviations from the general law.\r\n\r\nLet it be remarked, finally, that the ability to trace out embryologic\r\nkinships and the inability to do this, occur just where, according to the\r\nhypothesis of Evolution, they should occur. We saw in § 100a that\r\nzoologists are agreed in grouping animals into some 17 phyla--_Mollusca_,\r\n_Arthropoda_, _Echinodermata_, &c.--each of which includes a number of\r\nclasses severally sub-divided into orders, genera, species. All the members\r\nof each phylum are so related embryologically, that the existence of a\r\ncommon ancestor of them in the remote past is considered certain. But when\r\nit comes to the relations among the archaic ancestors, opinion is\r\nunsettled. Whether, for instance, the primitive _Chordata_, out of which\r\nthe _Vertebrata_ emerged, have molluscan affinities or annelidan\r\naffinities, is still a matter in dispute. With regard to the origins of\r\nvarious other types no settled conclusions are held. Now it is clear that\r\non tracing down each branch of the great genealogical tree, kinships would\r\nbe much more manifest among the recently-differentiated forms than among\r\nthose forms which diverged from one another in the earliest stages of\r\norganic life, and had separated widely before any of the types we now know\r\nhad come into existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE ARGUMENTS FROM MORPHOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 133. Leaving out of consideration those parallelisms among their modes of\r\ndevelopment which characterize organisms belonging to each group, that\r\ncommunity of plan which exists among them when mature is extremely\r\nremarkable and extremely suggestive. As before shown (§ 103), neither the\r\nsupposition that these combinations of attributes which unite classes are\r\nfortuitous, nor the supposition that no other combinations were\r\npracticable, nor the supposition of adherence to pre-determined typical\r\nplans, suffices to explain the facts. An instance will best prepare the\r\nreader for seeing the true meaning of these fundamental likenesses.\r\n\r\nUnder the immensely-varied forms of insects, greatly elongated like the\r\ndragon-fly or contracted in shape like the lady-bird, winged like the\r\nbutterfly or wingless like the flea, we find this character in\r\ncommon--there are primarily seventeen segments.[49]  These segments may be\r\ndistinctly marked or they may be so fused as to make it difficult to find\r\nthe divisions between them, but they always exist. What now can be the\r\nmeaning of this community of structure throughout the hundred thousand\r\nkinds of insects filling the air, burrowing in the earth, swimming in the\r\nwater? Why under the down-covered body of a moth and under the hard\r\nwing-cases of a beetle, should there be discovered the same number of\r\ndivisions? Why should there be no more somites in the Stick-insect, or\r\nother Phasmid a foot long, than there are in a small creature like the\r\nlouse? Why should the inert _Aphis_ and the swift-flying Emperor-butterfly\r\nbe constructed on the same fundamental plan? It cannot be by chance that\r\nthere exist equal numbers of segments in all these multitudes of species.\r\nThere is no reason to think it was _necessary_, in the sense that no other\r\nnumber would have made a possible organism. And to say that it is the\r\nresult of _design_--to say that the Creator followed this pattern\r\nthroughout, merely for the purpose of maintaining the pattern--is to assign\r\nan absurd motive. No rational interpretation of these and countless like\r\nmorphological facts, can be given except by the hypothesis of evolution;\r\nand from the hypothesis of evolution they are corollaries. If organic forms\r\nhave arisen from common stocks by perpetual divergences and\r\nre-divergences--if they have continued to inherit, more or less clearly,\r\nthe characters of ancestral races; then there will naturally result these\r\ncommunities of fundamental structure among creatures which have severally\r\nbecome modified in multitudinous ways and degrees, in adaptation to their\r\nrespective modes of life. To this let it be added that while the belief in\r\nan intentional adhesion to a pre-determined pattern throughout a whole\r\ngroup, is negatived by the occurrence of occasional deviations from the\r\npattern; such deviations are reconcilable with the belief in evolution. As\r\npointed out in the last chapter, ancestral traits will be obscured more or\r\nless according as the superposed modifications of structure, have or have\r\nnot been furthered by the conditions of life and development to which the\r\ntype has been subjected.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 134. Besides these wide-embracing and often deeply-hidden homologies,\r\nwhich hold together different animals, there are the scarcely-less\r\nsignificant homologies between different organs of the same animal. These,\r\nlike the others, are obstacles to the supernatural interpretations and\r\nsupports of the natural interpretation.\r\n\r\nOne of the most familiar and instructive examples is furnished by the\r\nvertebral column. Snakes, which move sinuously through and over plants and\r\nstones, obviously need a segmentation of the bony axis from end to end; and\r\ninasmuch as flexibility is required throughout the whole length of the\r\nbody, there is advantage in the comparative uniformity of this\r\nsegmentation. The movements would be impeded if, instead of a chain of\r\nvertebræ varying but little in their lengths, there existed in the middle\r\nof the series some long bony mass that would not bend. But in the higher\r\n_Vertebrata_, the mechanical actions and reactions demand that while some\r\nparts of the vertebral column shall be flexible, other parts shall be\r\ninflexible. Inflexibility is specially requisite in that part of it called\r\nthe sacrum; which, in mammals and birds, forms a fulcrum exposed to the\r\ngreatest strains the skeleton has to bear. Now in both mammals and birds,\r\nthis rigid portion of the vertebral column is not made of one long segment\r\nor vertebra, but of several segments fused together. In man there are five\r\nof these confluent sacral vertebræ; and in the ostrich tribe they number\r\nfrom seventeen to twenty. Why is this? Why, if the skeleton of each species\r\nwas separately contrived, was this bony mass made by soldering together a\r\nnumber of vertebræ like those forming the rest of the column, instead of\r\nbeing made out of one single piece? And why, if typical uniformity was to\r\nbe maintained, does the number of sacral vertebræ vary within the same\r\norder of birds? Why, too, should the development of the sacrum be by the\r\nround-about process of first forming its separate constituent vertebræ, and\r\nthen destroying their separateness? In the embryo of a mammal or bird, the\r\ncentral element of the vertebral column is, at the outset, continuous. The\r\nsegments that are to become vertebræ, arise gradually in the adjacent\r\nmesoderm, and enwrap this originally-homogeneous axis or notochord. Equally\r\nin those parts of the spine which are to remain flexible, and in those\r\nparts which are to grow rigid, these segments are formed; and that part of\r\nthe spine which is to compose the sacrum, having acquired this segmental\r\nstructure, loses it again by coalescence of the segments. To what end is\r\nthis construction and re-construction? If, originally, the spine in\r\nvertebrate animals consisted from head to tail of separate moveable\r\nsegments, as it does still in fishes and some reptiles--if, in the\r\nevolution of the higher _Vertebrata_, certain of these moveable segments\r\nwere rendered less moveable with respect to one another, by the mechanical\r\nconditions they were exposed to, and at length became relatively immovable;\r\nit is comprehensible why the sacrum formed out of them, should continue\r\never after to show its originally-segmented structure. But on any other\r\nhypothesis this segmented structure is inexplicable. \"We see the same law\r\nin comparing the wonderfully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans,\" says\r\nMr. Darwin: referring to the fact that those numerous lateral appendages\r\nwhich, in the lower crustaceans, most of them serve as legs, and have like\r\nshapes, are, in the higher crustaceans, some of them represented by\r\nenormously-developed claws, and others by variously-modified foot-jaws. \"It\r\nis familiar to almost every one,\" he continues, \"that in a flower the\r\nrelative position of the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, as well as\r\ntheir intimate structure, are intelligible on the view that they consist of\r\nmetamorphosed leaves arranged in a spire. In monstrous plants we often get\r\ndirect evidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into\r\nanother; and we can actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other\r\nanimals, and in flowers, that organs, which when mature become extremely\r\ndifferent, are at an early stage of growth exactly alike.\" ... \"Why should\r\none crustacean, which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many parts\r\nconsequently always have fewer legs; or conversely, those with many legs\r\nhave simpler mouths? Why should the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils in\r\nany individual flower, though fitted for such widely-different purposes, be\r\nall constructed on the same pattern?\"\r\n\r\nTo these and countless similar questions, the theory of evolution furnishes\r\nthe only rational answer. In the course of that change from homogeneity to\r\nheterogeneity of structure displayed in evolution under every form, it will\r\nnecessarily happen that from organisms made up of numerous like parts,\r\nthere will arise organisms made up of parts more and more unlike: which\r\nunlike parts will nevertheless continue to bear traces of their primitive\r\nlikeness.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 135. One more striking morphological fact, near akin to some of the facts\r\ndwelt on in the last chapter, must be here set down--the frequent\r\noccurrence, in adult animals and plants, of rudimentary and useless organs,\r\nwhich are homologous with organs that are developed and useful in allied\r\nanimals and plants. In the last chapter we saw that during the development\r\nof embryos, there often arise organs which disappear on being replaced by\r\nother organs discharging the same functions in better ways; and that in\r\nsome cases, organs develop to certain points and are then re-absorbed\r\nwithout performing any functions. Very generally, however, the\r\npartially-developed organs are retained throughout life.\r\n\r\nThe osteology of the higher _Vertebrata_ supplies abundant examples.\r\nVertebral processes which, in one tribe, are fully formed and ossified from\r\nindependent centres, are, in other tribes, mere tubercles not having\r\nindependent centres of ossification. While in the tail of this animal the\r\nvertebræ are severally composed of centrum and appendages, in the tail of\r\nthat animal they are simple osseous masses without any appendages; and in\r\nanother animal they have lost their individualities by coalescence with\r\nneighbouring vertebræ into a rudimentary tail. From the structures of the\r\nlimbs analogous facts are cited by comparative anatomists. The undeveloped\r\nstate of certain metacarpal bones, characterizes whole groups of mammals.\r\nIn one case we find the normal number of digits; and, in another case, a\r\nsmaller number with an atrophied digit to make out the complement. Here is\r\na digit with its full number of phalanges; and there a digit of which one\r\nphalange has been arrested in its growth. Still more remarkable are the\r\ninstances of entire limbs being rudimentary; as in certain snakes, which\r\nhave hind legs hidden beneath the integument. So, too, is it with dermal\r\nappendages. Some of the smooth-skinned amphibia have scales buried in the\r\nskin. The seal, which is a mammal considerably modified in adaptation to an\r\naquatic life, and which uses its feet mainly as paddles, has toes that\r\nstill bear external nails; but the manatee, which is a much more\r\ntransformed mammal, has nailless paddles which, when the skin is removed,\r\nare said, by Humboldt, to display rudimentary nails at the ends of the\r\nimbedded digits. Nearly all birds are covered with developed feathers,\r\nseverally composed of a shaft bearing fibres, each of which, again, bears a\r\nfringe of down. But in some birds, as in the ostrich, various stages of\r\narrested development of the feathers may be traced: between the\r\nunusually-elaborated feathers of the tail, and those about the beak which\r\nare reduced to simple hairs, there are transitions. Nor is this the extreme\r\ncase. In the _Apteryx_ we see the whole of the feathers reduced to a\r\nhair-like form. Again, the hair which commonly covers the body in mammals\r\nis, over the greater part of the human body almost rudimentary, and is in\r\nsome parts reduced to mere down--down which nevertheless proves itself to\r\nbe homologous with the hair of mammals in general, by occasionally\r\ndeveloping into the original form. Numerous cases of aborted organs are\r\ngiven by Mr. Darwin, of which a few may be here added. \"Nothing can be\r\nplainer,\" he remarks, \"than that wings are formed for flight, yet in how\r\nmany insects do we see wings so reduced in size as to be utterly incapable\r\nof flight, and not rarely lying under wing-cases, firmly soldered\r\ntogether?\" ... \"In plants with separated sexes, the male flowers often have\r\na rudiment of a pistil; and Kölreuter found that by crossing such male\r\nplants with an hermaphrodite species, the rudiment of the pistil in the\r\nhybrid offspring was much increased in size; and this shows that the\r\nrudiment and the perfect pistil are essentially alike in nature.\" And then,\r\nto complete the proof that these undeveloped parts are marks of descent\r\nfrom races in which they were developed, there are not a few direct\r\nexperiences of this relation. \"We have plenty of cases of rudimentary\r\norgans in our domestic productions--as the stump of a tail in tailless\r\nbreeds--the vestige of an ear in earless breeds--the re-appearance of\r\nminute dangling horns in hornless breeds of cattle.\" (_Origin of Species_,\r\n1859, pp. 451, 454.)\r\n\r\nHere, as before, the teleological doctrine fails utterly; for these\r\nrudimentary organs are useless, and occasionally even detrimental; as is\r\nthe _appendix vermiformis_, in Man--a part of the cæcum which is of no\r\nvalue for the purpose of absorption but which, by detaining small foreign\r\nbodies, often causes severe inflammation and death. The doctrine of typical\r\nplans is equally out of court; for while, in some members of a group,\r\nrudimentary organs completing the general type are traceable, in other\r\nmembers of the same group such organs are unrepresented. There remains only\r\nthe doctrine of evolution; and to this, these rudimentary organs offer no\r\ndifficulties. On the contrary, they are among its most striking evidences.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 136. The general truths of morphology thus coincide in their\r\nimplications. Unity of type, maintained under extreme dissimilarities of\r\nform and mode of life, is explicable as resulting from descent with\r\nmodification; but is otherwise inexplicable. The likenesses disguised by\r\nunlikenesses, which the comparative anatomist discovers between various\r\norgans in the same organism, are worse than meaningless if it be supposed\r\nthat organisms were severally framed as we now see them; but they fit in\r\nquite harmoniously with the belief that each kind of organism is a product\r\nof accumulated modifications upon modifications. And the presence, in all\r\nkinds of animals and plants, of functionally-useless parts corresponding to\r\nparts that are functionally-useful in allied animals and plants, while it\r\nis totally incongruous with the belief in a construction of each organism\r\nby miraculous interposition, is just what we are led to expect by the\r\nbelief that organisms have arisen by progression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE ARGUMENTS FROM DISTRIBUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 137. In §§ 105 and 106, we contemplated the phenomena of distribution in\r\nSpace. The general conclusions reached, in great part based on the evidence\r\nbrought together by Mr. Darwin, were that, \"on the one hand, we have\r\nsimilarly-conditioned, and sometimes nearly-adjacent, areas, occupied by\r\nquite different Faunas. On the other hand, we have areas remote from each\r\nother in latitude, and contrasted in soil as well as climate, which are\r\noccupied by closely-allied Faunas.\" Whence it was inferred that \"as like\r\norganisms are not universally, or even generally, found in like habitats;\r\nnor very unlike organisms, in very unlike habitats; there is no manifest\r\npre-determined adaptation of the organisms to the habitats.\" In other\r\nwords, the facts of distribution in Space do not conform to the hypothesis\r\nof design. At the same time we saw that \"the similar areas peopled by\r\ndissimilar forms, are those between which there are impassable barriers;\r\nwhile the dissimilar areas peopled by similar forms, are those between\r\nwhich there are no such barriers;\" and these generalizations appeared to\r\nharmonize with the abundantly-illustrated truth, \"that each species of\r\norganism tends ever to expand its sphere of existence--to intrude on other\r\nareas, other modes of life, other media.\"\r\n\r\nBy way of showing still more clearly the effects of competition among races\r\nof organisms, let me here add some recently-published instances of the\r\nusurpations of areas, and changes of distribution hence resulting. In the\r\n_Natural History Review_ for January, 1864, Dr. Hooker quotes as follows\r\nfrom some New Zealand naturalists:--\"You would be surprised at the rapid\r\nspread of European and other foreign plants in this country. All along the\r\nsides of the main lines of road through the plains, a _Polygonum_\r\n(_aviculare_), called 'Cow Grass,' grows most luxuriantly, the roots\r\nsometimes two feet in depth, and the plants spreading over an area from\r\nfour to five feet in diameter. The dock (_Rumex obtusifolius_ or _R.\r\ncrispus_) is to be found in every river bed, extending into the valleys of\r\nthe mountain rivers, until these become mere torrents. The sow-thistle is\r\nspread all over the country, growing luxuriantly nearly up to 6000 feet.\r\nThe water-cress increases in our still rivers to such an extent, as to\r\nthreaten to choke them altogether ... I have measured stems twelve feet\r\nlong and three-quarters of an inch in diameter. In some of the mountain\r\ndistricts, where the soil is loose, the white clover is completely\r\ndisplacing the native grasses, forming a close sward.... In fact, the young\r\nnative vegetation appears to shrink from competition with these more\r\nvigorous intruders.\" \"The native (Maori) saying is 'as the white man's rat\r\nhas driven away the native rat, so the European fly drives away our own,\r\nand the clover kills our fern, so will the Maoris disappear before the\r\nwhite man himself.'\"\r\n\r\nGiven this universal tendency of the superior to overrun the habitats of\r\nthe inferior,[50] let us consider what, on the hypothesis of evolution,\r\nwill be the effects on the geographical relationships of species.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 138. A race of organisms cannot expand its sphere of existence without\r\nsubjecting itself to new external conditions. Those of its members which\r\nspread over adjacent areas, inevitably come in contact with circumstances\r\npartially different from their previous circumstances; and such of them as\r\nadopt the habits of other organisms, necessarily experience re-actions more\r\nor less contrasted with the re-actions before experienced. Now if changes\r\nof organic structure are caused, directly or indirectly, by changes in the\r\nincidence of forces; there must result unlikenesses of structure between\r\nthe divisions of a race which colonizes new habitats. Hence, in the absence\r\nof obstacles to migration, we may anticipate manifest kinships between the\r\nanimals and plants of one area, and those of areas adjoining it. This\r\ninference corresponds with an induction before set down (§ 106). In\r\naddition to illustrations of it already quoted from Mr. Darwin, his pages\r\nfurnish others. One is that species which inhabit islands are allied to\r\nspecies which inhabit neighbouring main lands; and another is that the\r\nfaunas of clustered islands show marked similarities. \"Thus the several\r\nislands of the Galapagos Archipelago are tenanted,\" says Mr. Darwin, \"in a\r\nquite marvellous manner, by very closely related species; so that the\r\ninhabitants of each separate island, though mostly distinct, are related in\r\nan incomparably closer degree to each other than to the inhabitants of any\r\nother part of the world.\" Mr. Wallace has traced \"variation as specially\r\ninfluenced by locality\" among the _Papilionidæ_ inhabiting the East Indian\r\nArchipelago: showing how \"the species and varieties of Celebes possess a\r\nstriking character in the form of the anterior wings, different from that\r\nof the allied species and varieties of all the surrounding islands;\" and\r\nhow \"tailed species in India and the western islands lose their tails as\r\nthey spread eastward through the archipelago.\" During his travels on the\r\nUpper Amazons, Mr. Bates found that \"the greater part of the species of\r\n_Ithomiæ_ changed from one locality to another, not further removed than\r\n100 to 200 miles;\" that \"many of these local species have the appearance of\r\nbeing geographical varieties;\" and that in some species \"most of the local\r\nvarieties are connected with their parent form by individuals exhibiting\r\nall the shades of variation.\"\r\n\r\nFurther general relationships are to be inferred. If races of organisms,\r\never being thrust by pressure of population into new habitats, undergo\r\nmodifications of structure as they diverge more and more widely in Space,\r\nit follows that, speaking generally, the widest divergences in Space will\r\nindicate the longest periods during which the descendants from a common\r\nstock have been subject to modifying conditions; and hence that, among\r\norganisms of the same group, the smaller contrasts of structure will be\r\nlimited to the smaller areas. This we find: \"varieties being,\" as Dr.\r\nHooker says in his _Flora of Tasmania_, \"more restricted in locality than\r\nspecies, and these again than genera.\" Again, if races of organisms spread,\r\nand as they spread are altered by changing incident forces; it follows that\r\nwhere the incident forces vary greatly within given areas, the alterations\r\nwill be more numerous than in equal areas which are less-variously\r\nconditioned. This, too, proves to be the fact. Dr. Hooker points out that\r\nthe relatively uniform regions have the fewest species; while in the most\r\nmultiform regions the species are the most numerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 139. Let us consider next, how the hypothesis of evolution corresponds\r\nwith the facts of distribution, not over different areas but through\r\ndifferent media. If all forms of organisms have descended from some\r\nprimordial form, it follows that since this primordial form must have\r\ninhabited some one medium out of the several media now inhabited, the\r\npeopling of other media by its descendants implies migration from one\r\nmedium to others--implies adaptations to media quite unlike the original\r\nmedium. To speak specifically--water being the medium in which the lowest\r\nliving forms exist, the implication is that the earth and the air have been\r\ncolonized from the water.  Great difficulties appear to stand in the way of\r\nthis assumption. Ridiculing those who alleged the uniserial development of\r\norganic forms, who, indeed, laid themselves open to ridicule by their many\r\nuntenable propositions, Von Baer writes--\"A fish, swimming towards the\r\nshore desires to take a walk, but finds his fins useless. They diminish in\r\nbreadth for want of use, and at the same time elongate. This goes on with\r\nchildren and grandchildren for a few millions of years, and at last who can\r\nbe astonished that the fins become feet? It is still more natural that the\r\nfish in the meadow, finding no water, should gape after air, thereby, in a\r\nlike period of time developing lungs; the only difficulty being that in the\r\nmeanwhile, a few generations must manage without breathing at all.\"\r\nThough, as thus presented, the belief in a transition looks laughable; and\r\nthough such derivation of terrestrial vertebrates by direct modification of\r\npiscine vertebrates, is untenable; yet we must not conclude that no\r\nmigrations of the kind alleged can have taken place. The adage that \"truth\r\nis stranger than fiction,\" applies quite as much to Nature in general as to\r\nhuman life. Besides the fact that certain fish actually do \"take a walk\"\r\nwithout any obvious reason; and besides the fact that sundry kinds of fish\r\nramble about on land when prompted by the drying-up of the waters they\r\ninhabit; there is the still more astounding fact that one kind of fish\r\nclimbs trees. Few things seem more manifestly impossible, than that a\r\nwater-breathing creature without efficient limbs, should ascend eight or\r\nten feet up the trunk of a palm; and yet the _Anabas scandens_ does as\r\nmuch. To previous testimonies on this point Capt. Mitchell has recently\r\nadded others. Such remarkable cases of temporary changes of media, will\r\nprepare us for conceiving how, under special conditions, permanent changes\r\nof media may have taken place; and for considering how the doctrine of\r\nevolution is elucidated by them.\r\n\r\nInhabitants of the sea, of rivers, and of lakes, are many of them left from\r\ntime to time partially or completely without water; and those which show\r\nthe power to change their media temporarily or permanently, are in very\r\nmany cases of the kinds most liable to be thus deserted by their medium.\r\nLet us consider what the sea-shore shows us. Twice a day the rise and the\r\nfall of the tide covers and uncovers plants and animals, fixed and moving;\r\nand through the alternation of spring and neap tides, it results that the\r\nexposure of the organisms living low down on the beach, varies both in\r\nfrequency and duration: while some of them are left dry only once a\r\nfortnight for a very short time, others, a little higher up, are left dry\r\nduring two or three hours at several ebb tides every fortnight. Then by\r\nsmall gradations we come to such as, living at the top of the beach, are\r\nbathed by salt-water only at long intervals; and still higher to some which\r\nare but occasionally splashed in stormy weather. What, now, do we find\r\namong the organisms thus subject to various regular and irregular\r\nalterations of media? Besides many plants and many fixed animals, we find\r\nmoving animals of numerous kinds; some of which are confined to the lower\r\nzones of this littoral region, but others of which wander over the whole of\r\nit. Omitting the humbler types, it will suffice to observe that each of the\r\ntwo great sub-kingdoms, _Mollusca_ and _Arthropoda_, supplies examples of\r\ncreatures having a wide excursiveness within this region. We have\r\ngasteropods which, when the tide is down, habitually creep snail-like over\r\nsand and sea-weed, even up as far as high-water mark. We have several kinds\r\nof crustaceans, of which the crab is the most conspicuous, running about on\r\nthe wet beach, and sometimes rambling beyond the reach of the water. And\r\nthen note the striking fact that each of the forms thus habituated to\r\nchanges of media, is allied to forms which are mainly or wholly\r\nterrestrial. On the West Coast of Ireland marine gasteropods are found on\r\nthe rocks three hundred feet above the sea, where they are only at long\r\nintervals wetted by the spray; and though between gasteropods of this class\r\nand land-gasteropods the differences are considerable, yet the\r\nland-gasteropods are more closely allied to them than to any other\r\n_Mollusca_. Similarly, the two highest orders of crustaceans have their\r\nspecies which live occasionally, or almost entirely, out of the water:\r\nthere is a kind of lobster in the Mauritius which climbs trees; and there\r\nis the land-crab of the West Indies, which deserts the sea when it reaches\r\nmaturity and re-visits it only to spawn. Seeing, thus, how there are many\r\nkinds of marine creatures whose habitats expose them to frequent changes of\r\nmedia; how some of the higher kinds so circumstanced, show a considerable\r\nadaptation to both media; and how these amphibious kinds are allied to\r\nkinds that are mainly or wholly terrestrial; we shall see that the\r\nmigrations from one medium to another, which evolution pre-supposes, are by\r\nno means impracticable. With such evidence before us, the assumption that\r\nthe distribution of the _Vertebrata_ through media so different as air and\r\nwater, may have been gradually effected in some analogous manner, would not\r\nbe altogether unwarranted even had we no clue to the process. We shall\r\nfind, however, a tolerably distinct clue. Though rivers, and lakes, and\r\npools, have no sensible tidal variations, they have their rises and falls,\r\nregular and irregular, moderate and extreme. Especially in tropical\r\nclimates, we see them annually full for a certain number of months, and\r\nthen dwindling away and drying up. The drying up may reach various degrees\r\nand last for various periods. It may go to the extent only of producing a\r\nliquid mud, or it may reduce the mud to a hardened, fissured solid. It may\r\nlast for a few days or for months. That is to say, aquatic forms which are\r\nin one place annually subject to a slight want of water for a short time,\r\nare elsewhere subject to greater wants for longer times: we have gradations\r\nof transition, analogous to those which the tides furnish. Now it is well\r\nknown that creatures inhabiting such waters have, in various degrees,\r\npowers of meeting these contingencies. The contained fish either bury\r\nthemselves in the mud when the dry season comes, or ramble in search of\r\nother waters. This is proved by evidence from India, Guiana, Siam, Ceylon;\r\nand some of these fish, as the _Anabas scandens_, are known to survive for\r\ndays out of the water. But the facts of greatest significance are furnished\r\nby an allied class of _Vertebrata_, almost peculiar to habitats of this\r\nkind. The _Amphibia_ are not, like fish, usually found in waters that are\r\nnever partially or wholly dried up; but they nearly all inhabit waters\r\nwhich, at certain seasons, evaporate, in great measure or\r\ncompletely--waters in which most kinds of fish cannot exist. And what are\r\nthe leading structural traits of these _Amphibia_? They have two\r\nrespiratory systems--pulmonic and branchial--variously developed in\r\ndifferent orders; and they have two or four limbs, also variously\r\ndeveloped. Further, the class _Amphibia_ consists of two groups, in one of\r\nwhich this duality of the respiratory system is permanent, and the\r\ndevelopment of the limbs always incomplete; and in the other of which the\r\nbranchiæ disappear as the lungs and limbs become fully developed. The\r\nlowest group, the _Perennibranchiata_, have internal organs for aerating\r\nthe blood which approach in various degrees to lungs, until \"in the\r\n_Siren_, the pulmonic respiration is more extensive and important than the\r\nbranchial;\" and to these creatures, having a habitat partially aërial and\r\npartially aquatic, there are at the same time supplied, in the shallow\r\nwater covering soft mud, the mechanical conditions which render swimming\r\ndifficult and rudimentary limbs useful. In the higher group, the\r\n_Caducibranchiata_, we find still more suggestive transformations. Having\r\nat first a structure resembling that which is permanent in the\r\nperennibranchiate amphibian, the larva of the caducibranchiate amphibian\r\npursues for a time a similar life; but, eventually, while the branchial\r\nappendages dwindle the lungs grow: the respiration of air, originally\r\nsupplementary to the respiration of water, predominates over it more and\r\nmore, till it replaces it entirely; and an additional pair of legs is\r\nproduced. This having been done, the creature either becomes, like the\r\n_Triton_, one which quits the water only occasionally; or, like the Frog,\r\none which pursues a life mainly terrestrial, and returns to the water now\r\nand then. Finally, if we ask under what conditions this metamorphosis of a\r\nwater-breather into an air-breather completes itself, the answer is--it\r\ncompletes itself at the time when the shallow pools inhabited by the larvæ\r\nare being dried up, or in danger of being dried up, by the summer's\r\nsun.[51]\r\n\r\nSee, then, how significant are the facts when thus brought together. There\r\nare particular habitats in which animals are subject to changes of media.\r\nIn such habitats exist animals having, in various degrees, the power to\r\nlive in both media, consequent on various phases of transitional\r\norganization. Near akin to these animals there are some that, after passing\r\ntheir early lives in the water, acquire more completely the structures\r\nfitting them to live on land, to which they then migrate. Lastly, we have\r\nclosely-allied creatures, like the Surinam toad and the terrestrial\r\nsalamander, which, though they belong by their structures to the class\r\n_Amphibia_, are not amphibious in their habits--creatures the larvæ of\r\nwhich do not pass their early lives in the water, and yet go through these\r\nsame metamorphoses! Must we then think, like Von Baer, that the\r\ndistribution of kindred organisms through different media presents an\r\ninsurmountable difficulty? On the contrary, with facts like these before\r\nus, the evolution-hypothesis supplies possible interpretations of many\r\nphenomena that are else unaccountable. After seeing the ways in which such\r\nchanges of media are in some cases gradually imposed by physical\r\nconditions, and in other cases voluntarily commenced and slowly increased\r\nin the search after food; we shall begin to understand how, in the course\r\nof evolution, there have arisen strange obscurations of one type by the\r\nexternals of another type. When we see land-birds occasionally feeding by\r\nthe water-side, and then learn that one of them, the water-ouzel, an\r\n\"anomalous member of the strictly terrestrial thrush family, wholly\r\nsubsists by diving--grasping the stones with its feet and using its wings\r\nunder water\"--we are enabled to comprehend how, under pressure of\r\npopulation, aquatic habits may be acquired by creatures organized for\r\naërial life; and how there may eventually arise an ornithic type in which\r\nthe traits of the bird are very much disguised. On finding among mammals\r\nsome that, in search of prey or shelter, have taken to the water in various\r\ndegrees, we shall cease to be perplexed on discovering the mammalian\r\nstructure hidden under a fish-like form, as it is in the _Cetacea_ and the\r\n_Sirenia_: especially on finding that in the sea-lion and the seals there\r\nare transitional forms. Grant that there has ever been going on that\r\nre-distribution of organisms which we see still resulting from their\r\nintrusions on one another's areas, media, and modes of life; and we have an\r\nexplanation of those multitudinous cases in which homologies of structure\r\nare complicated with analogies. And while it accounts for the occurrence in\r\none medium of organic types fundamentally organized for another medium, the\r\ndoctrine of evolution accounts also for the accompanying unfitnesses.\r\nEither the seal has descended from some mammal which little by little\r\nbecame aquatic in its habits, in which case the structure of its hind limbs\r\nhas a meaning; or else it was specially framed for its present habitat, in\r\nwhich case the structure of its hind limbs is incomprehensible.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 140. The facts respecting distribution in Time, which have more than any\r\nothers been cited both in proof and in disproof of evolution, are too\r\nfragmentary to be conclusive either way. Were the geological record\r\ncomplete, or did it, as both Uniformitarians and Progressionists have\r\ncommonly assumed, give us traces of the earliest organic forms; the\r\nevidence hence derived, for or against, would have had more weight than any\r\nother evidence. As it is, all we can do is to see whether such fragmentary\r\nevidence as remains, is congruous with the hypothesis.\r\n\r\nPalæontology has shown that there is a \"general relation between lapse of\r\ntime and divergence of organic forms\" (§ 107); and that \"this divergence is\r\ncomparatively slow and continuous where there is continuity in the\r\ngeological formations, but is sudden and comparatively wide wherever there\r\noccurs a great break in the succession of strata.\" Now this is obviously\r\nwhat we should expect. The hypothesis implies structural changes that are\r\nnot sudden but gradual. Hence, where conformable strata indicate a\r\ncontinuous record, we may anticipate successions of forms only slightly\r\ndifferent from one another; while we may rationally look for marked\r\ncontrasts between the groups of forms fossilized in adjacent strata, where\r\nthere is evidence of a great blank in the record.\r\n\r\nThe permanent disappearances of species, of genera, and of orders, which we\r\nsaw to be a fact tolerably-well established, is also a fact for which the\r\nbelief in evolution prepares us. If later organic forms have in all cases\r\ndescended from earlier organic forms, and have diverged during their\r\ndescent, both from their prototypes and from one another; then it follows\r\nthat such of them as become extinct at any epoch, will never re-appear at a\r\nsubsequent epoch; since there can never again arise a concurrence and\r\nsuccession of conditions such as those under which each type was evolved.\r\n\r\nThough comparisons of ancient and modern organic forms, prove that many\r\ntypes have persisted through enormous periods of time, without undergoing\r\ngreat changes; it was shown that such comparisons do not disprove the\r\noccurrence in other organic forms, of changes great enough to produce what\r\nare called different types. The result of inductive inquiry we saw to be,\r\nthat while a few modern higher types yield signs of having been developed\r\nfrom ancient lower types; and that while there are many modern types which\r\n_may_ have been thus developed, though we are without evidence that they\r\nhave been so; yet that \"any admissible hypothesis of progressive\r\nmodification must be compatible with persistence without progression\r\nthrough indefinite periods.\" Now these results are quite congruous with the\r\nhypothesis of evolution. As rationally interpreted, evolution must in all\r\ncases be understood to result, directly or indirectly, from the incidence\r\nof forces. If there are no changes of conditions entailing organic changes,\r\norganic changes are not to be expected. Only in organisms which fall under\r\nconditions leading to additional modifications answering to additional\r\nneeds, will there be that increased heterogeneity which characterizes\r\nhigher forms. Hence, though the facts of palæontology cannot be held\r\nconclusive proof of evolution, yet they are congruous with it; and some of\r\nthem yield it strong support.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 141. One general truth respecting distribution in Time, is profoundly\r\nsignificant. If, instead of contemplating the relations among past forms of\r\nlife taken by themselves, we contemplate the relations between them and the\r\nforms now existing, we find a connexion which is in harmony with the belief\r\nin evolution but irreconcilable with any other belief.\r\n\r\nNote, first, how full of meaning is the close kinship existing between the\r\naggregate of organisms now living, and the aggregate of organisms which\r\nlived in the most recent geologic times. In the last-formed strata, nearly\r\nall the imbedded remains are those of species which still flourish. Strata\r\na little older contain a few fossils of species now extinct, though,\r\nusually, species greatly resembling extant ones. Of the remains found in\r\nstrata of still earlier date, the extinct species form a larger percentage;\r\nand the differences between them and the allied species now living are more\r\nmarked. That is to say, the gradual change of organic types in Time, which\r\nwe before saw is indicated by the geological record, is equally indicated\r\nby the relation between existing organic types and organic types of the\r\nepochs preceding our own. The evidence completely accords with the belief\r\nin a descent of present life from past life. Doubtless such a kinship is\r\nnot incongruous with the doctrine of special creations. It may be argued\r\nthat the introduction, from time to time, of new species better fitted to\r\nthe somewhat changed conditions of the Earth's surface, would result in an\r\napparent alliance between our living Flora and Fauna, and the Floras and\r\nFaunas that lately lived. No one can deny it. But on passing from the most\r\ngeneral aspect of the alliance to its more special aspects, we shall find\r\nthis interpretation completely negatived.\r\n\r\nFor besides a close kinship between the aggregate of surviving forms and\r\nthe aggregate of forms which have died out in recent geologic times; there\r\nis a peculiar connexion of like nature between present and past forms in\r\neach great geographical region. The instructive fact, before cited from Mr.\r\nDarwin, is the \"wonderful relationship in the same continent between the\r\ndead and the living.\" This relationship is not explained by the supposition\r\nthat new species have been at intervals supernaturally placed in each\r\nhabitat, as the habitat became modified; since, as we saw, species are by\r\nno means uniformly found in the habitats to which they are best adapted. It\r\ncannot be said that the marsupials imbedded in recent Australian strata,\r\nhaving become extinct because of unfitness to some new external condition,\r\nthe existing marsupials were then specially created to fit the modified\r\nenvironment; since sundry animals found elsewhere are so much more in\r\nharmony with these new Australian conditions that, when taken to Australia,\r\nthey rapidly extrude the marsupials. While, therefore, the similarity\r\nbetween the existing Australian Fauna and the Fauna which immediately\r\npreceded it over the same area, is just that which the belief in evolution\r\nleads us to expect; it is a similarity which cannot be otherwise accounted\r\nfor. And so is it with parallel relations in New England, in South America,\r\nand in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 142. Given, then, that pressure which species exercise on one another, in\r\nconsequence of the universal overfilling of their respective\r\nhabitats--given the resulting tendency to thrust themselves into one\r\nanother's areas, and media, and modes of life, along such lines of least\r\nresistance as from time to time are found--given besides the changes in\r\nmodes of life, hence arising, those other changes which physical\r\nalterations of habitats necessitate--given the structural modifications\r\ndirectly or indirectly produced in organisms by modified conditions; and\r\nthe facts of distribution in Space and Time are accounted for. That\r\ndivergence and re-divergence of organic forms, which we saw to be shadowed\r\nforth by the truths of classification and the truths of embryology, we see\r\nto be also shadowed forth by the truths of distribution. If that aptitude\r\nto multiply, to spread, to separate, and to differentiate, which the human\r\nraces have in all times shown, be a tendency common to races in general, as\r\nwe have ample reason to assume; then there will result those kinds of\r\nspacial relations and chronological relations among the species, and\r\ngenera, and orders, peopling the Earth's surface, which we find exist. The\r\nremarkable identities of type discovered between organisms inhabiting one\r\nmedium, and strangely modified organisms inhabiting another medium, are at\r\nthe same time rendered comprehensible. And the appearances and\r\ndisappearances of species which the geological record shows us, as well as\r\nthe connexions between successive groups of species from early eras down to\r\nour own, cease to be inexplicable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nHOW IS ORGANIC EVOLUTION CAUSED?\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 143. Already it has been necessary to speak of the causes of organic\r\nevolution in general terms; and now we are prepared for considering them\r\nspecifically. The task before us is to affiliate the leading facts of\r\norganic evolution, on those same first principles conformed to by evolution\r\nat large.\r\n\r\nBefore attempting this, however, it will be instructive to glance at the\r\ncauses of organic evolution which have been from time to time alleged.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 144. The theory that plants and animals of all kinds were gradually\r\nevolved, seems to have been at first accompanied only by the vaguest\r\nconception of cause--or rather, by no conception of cause properly so\r\ncalled, but only by the blank form of a conception. One of the earliest who\r\nin modern times (1735) contended that organisms are indefinitely\r\nmodifiable, and that through their modifications they have become adapted\r\nto various modes of existence, was De Maillet. But though De Maillet\r\nsupposed all living beings to have arisen by a natural, continuous process,\r\nhe does not appear to have had any definite idea of that which determines\r\nthis process. In 1794, in his _Zoonomia_, Dr. Erasmus Darwin gave reasons\r\n(sundry of them valid ones) for believing that organized beings of every\r\nkind, have descended from one, or a few, primordial germs; and along with\r\nsome observable causes of modification, which he points out as aiding the\r\ndevelopmental process, he apparently ascribes it, in part, to a tendency\r\ngiven to such germ or germs when created. He suggests the possibility \"that\r\nall warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament, which THE\r\nGREAT FIRST CAUSE endued with animality, with the power of acquiring new\r\nparts, attended with new propensities, directed by irritations, sensations,\r\nvolitions, and associations; and thus possessing the faculty of continuing\r\nto improve by its own inherent activity.\" In this passage we see the idea\r\nto be, that evolution is pre-determined by some intrinsic proclivity. \"It\r\nis curious,\" says Mr. Charles Darwin, \"how largely my grandfather, Dr.\r\nErasmus Darwin, anticipated the erroneous grounds of opinion, and the views\r\nof Lamarck.\" One of the anticipations was this ascription of development to\r\nsome inherent tendency. To the \"plan général de la nature, et sa marche\r\nuniforme dans ses opérations,\" Lamarck attributes \"la progression évidente\r\nqui existe dans la composition de l'organisation des animaux;\" and \"la\r\n_gradation_ régulière qu'ils devroient offrir dans la composition de leur\r\norganisation,\" he thinks is rendered irregular by secondary causes.\r\nEssentially the same in kind, though somewhat different in form, is the\r\nconception put forth in the _Vestiges of Creation_; the author of which\r\ncontends \"that the several series of animated beings, from the simplest and\r\noldest up to the highest and most recent, are, under the providence of God,\r\nthe results, _first_, of an impulse which has been imparted to the forms of\r\nlife, advancing them, in definite times, by generation, through grades of\r\norganization terminating in the highest dicotyledons and vertebrata;\" and\r\nthat the progression resulting from these impulses, is modified by certain\r\nother causes. The broad contrasts between lower and higher forms of life,\r\nare regarded by him as implying an innate aptitude to give birth to forms\r\nof more perfect structures. The last to re-enunciate this doctrine has been\r\nProf. Owen; who asserts \"the axiom of the continuous operation of creative\r\npower, or of the ordained becoming of living things.\" Though these words do\r\nnot suggest a very definite idea, yet they indicate the belief that organic\r\nprogress is a result of some in-dwelling tendency to develop,\r\nsupernaturally impressed on living matter at the outset--some ever-acting\r\nconstructive force which, independently of other forces, moulds organisms\r\ninto higher and higher forms.\r\n\r\nIn whatever way it is formulated, or by whatever language it is obscured,\r\nthis ascription of organic evolution to some aptitude naturally possessed\r\nby organisms, or miraculously imposed on them, is unphilosophical. It is\r\none of those explanations which explain nothing--a shaping of ignorance\r\ninto the semblance of knowledge. The cause assigned is not a true\r\ncause--not a cause assimilable to known causes--not a cause that can be\r\nanywhere shown to produce analogous effects. It is a cause unrepresentable\r\nin thought: one of those illegitimate symbolic conceptions which cannot by\r\nany mental process be elaborated into a real conception. In brief, this\r\nassumption of a persistent formative power inherent in organisms, and\r\nmaking them unfold into higher types, is an assumption no more tenable than\r\nthe assumption of special creations: of which, indeed, it is but a\r\nmodification; differing only by the fusion of separate unknown processes\r\ninto a continuous unknown process.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 145. Besides this intrinsic tendency to progress which Dr. Darwin\r\nascribes to animals, he says they have a capacity for being modified by\r\nprocesses which their own desires initiate. He speaks of powers as \"excited\r\ninto action by the necessities of the creatures which possess them, and on\r\nwhich their existence depends;\" and more specifically he says that \"from\r\ntheir first rudiment or primordium, to the termination of their lives, all\r\nanimals undergo perpetual transformations; which are in part produced by\r\ntheir own exertions, in consequence of their desires and aversions, of\r\ntheir pleasures and their pains, or of irritations, or of associations; and\r\nmany of these acquired forms or properties are transmitted to their\r\nposterity.\" While it embodies a belief for which much may be said, this\r\npassage involves the assumption that desires and aversions, existing before\r\nexperiences of the actions to which they are related, were the originators\r\nof the actions, and therefore of the structural modifications caused by\r\nthem. In his _Philosophie Zoologique_, Lamarck much more specifically\r\nasserts \"le _sentiment intérieur_,\" to be in all creatures that have\r\ndeveloped nervous systems, an independent cause of those changes of form\r\nwhich are due to the exercise of organs: distinguishing it from that simple\r\n_irritability_ possessed by inferior animals, which cannot produce what we\r\ncall a desire or emotion; and holding that these last, along with all \"qui\r\nmanquent de système nerveux, ne vivent qu'à l'aide des excitations qu'ils\r\nreçoivent de l'extérieur.\" Afterwards he says--\"je reconnus que la nature,\r\nobligée d'abord d'emprunter des milieux environnants la _puissance\r\nexcitatrice_ des mouvements vitaux et des actions des animaux imparfaits,\r\nsut, en composant de plus en plus l'organisation animale, transporter cette\r\npuissance dans l'intérieur même de ces êtres, et qu'à la fin, elle parvint\r\nà mettre cette même puissance à la disposition de l'individu.\" And still\r\nmore definitely he contends that if one considers \"la _progression_ qui se\r\nmontre dans la composition de l'organisation,\" ... \"alors on eût pu\r\napercevoir comment les _besoins_, d'abord réduits à nullité, et dont le\r\nnombre ensuite s'est accru graduellement, ont amené le penchant aux actions\r\npropres à y satisfaire: comment les actions devenues habituelles et\r\nénergiques, ont occasionné le développement des organes qui les exécutent.\"\r\n\r\nNow though this conception of Lamarck is more precisely stated, and worked\r\nout with much greater elaboration and wider knowledge of the facts, it is\r\nessentially the same as that of Dr. Darwin; and along with the truth it\r\ncontains, contains also the same error more distinctly pronounced. Merely\r\nnoting that desires or wants, acting directly only on the nervo-muscular\r\nsystem, can have no immediate influence on very many organs, as the\r\nviscera, or such external appendages as hair and feathers; and observing,\r\nfurther, that even some parts which belong to the apparatus of external\r\naction, such as the bones of the skull, cannot be made to grow by increase\r\nof function called forth by desire; it will suffice to point out that the\r\ndifficulty is not solved, but simply slurred over, when needs or wants are\r\nintroduced as independent causes of evolution. True though it is, as Dr.\r\nDarwin and Lamarck contend, that desires, by leading to increased actions\r\nof motor organs, may induce further developments of such organs; and true,\r\nas it probably is, that the modifications hence arising are transmissible\r\nto offspring; yet there remains the unanswered question--Whence do these\r\ndesires originate? The transference of the exciting power from the exterior\r\nto the interior, as described by Lamarck, begs the question. How comes\r\nthere a wish to perform an action not before performed? Until some\r\nbeneficial result has been felt from going through certain movements, what\r\ncan suggest the execution of such movements? Every desire consists\r\nprimarily of a mental representation of that which is desired, and\r\nsecondarily excites a mental representation of the actions by which it is\r\nattained; and any such mental representations of the end and the means,\r\nimply antecedent experience of the end and antecedent use of the means. To\r\nassume that in the course of evolution there from time to time arise new\r\nkinds of actions dictated by new desires, is simply to remove the\r\ndifficulty a step back.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 146. Changes of external conditions are named, by Dr. Darwin, as causes\r\nof modifications in organisms. Assigning as evidence of original kinship,\r\nthat marked similarity of type which exists among animals, he regards their\r\ndeviations from one another, as caused by differences in their modes of\r\nlife: such deviations being directly adaptive. After enumerating various\r\nappliances for procuring food, he says they all \"seem to have been\r\ngradually produced during many generations by the perpetual endeavour of\r\nthe creatures to supply the want of food, and to have been delivered to\r\ntheir posterity with constant improvement of them for the purposes\r\nrequired.\" And the creatures possessing these various appliances are\r\nconsidered as having been rendered unlike by seeking for food in unlike\r\nways. As illustrating the alterations wrought by changed circumstances, he\r\nnames the acquired characters of domestic animals. Lamarck has elaborated\r\nthe same view in detail: using for the purpose, with great ingenuity, his\r\nextensive knowledge of the animal kingdom. From a passage in the\r\n_Avertissement_ it would at first sight seem that he looks upon direct\r\nadaptation to new conditions as the chief cause of evolution. He says--\"Je\r\nregardai comme certain que le _mouvement des fluides_ dans l'intérieur des\r\nanimaux, mouvement qui c'est progressivement accéléré avec la composition\r\nplus grande de l'organisation; et que _l'influence des circonstances_\r\nnouvelles, à mesure que les animaux s'y exposèrent en se répandant dans\r\ntous les lieux habitables, furent les deux causes générales qui ont amené\r\nles différents animaux à l'état où nous les voyons actuellement.\" But\r\nelsewhere the view he expresses appears decidedly different from this. He\r\nasserts that \"dans sa marche, la nature a commencé, et recommence encore\r\ntous les jours, par former les corps organisés les plus simples;\" and that\r\n\"les premières ébauches de l'animal et du végétal étant formées dans les\r\nlieux et les circonstances convenables, les facultés d'une vie commençante\r\net d'un mouvement organique établi, ont nécessairement développé peu à peu\r\nles organes, et qu'avec le temps elles les ont diversifies ainsi que les\r\nparties.\" And then, further on, he puts in italics this proposition:--\"_La\r\nprogression dans la composition de l'organisation subit, çà et là, dans la\r\nsérie générale des animaux, des anomalies opérées par l'influence des\r\ncirconstances d'habitation, et par celle des habitudes contractées._\"\r\nThese, and sundry other passages, joined with his general scheme of\r\nclassification, make it clear that Lamarck conceived adaptive modification\r\nto be, not the cause of progression, but the cause of irregularities in\r\nprogression. The inherent tendency which organisms have to develop into\r\nmore perfect forms, would, according to him, result in a uniform series of\r\nforms; but varieties in their conditions work divergences of structure,\r\nwhich break up the series into groups: groups which he nevertheless places\r\nin uni-serial order, and regards as still substantially composing an\r\nascending succession.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 147. These speculations, crude as they may be considered, show much\r\nsagacity in their respective authors, and have done good service. Without\r\nembodying the truth in definite shapes, they contain adumbrations of it.\r\nNot directly, but by successive approximations, do mankind reach correct\r\nconclusions; and those who first think in the right direction, loose as may\r\nbe their reasonings, and wide of the mark as their inferences may be, yield\r\nindispensable aid by framing provisional conceptions and giving a bent to\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\nContrasted with the dogmas of his age, the idea of De Maillet was a great\r\nadvance. Before it can be ascertained how organized beings have been\r\ngradually evolved, there must be reached the conviction that they _have_\r\nbeen gradually evolved; and this conviction he reached. His wild notions\r\nabout the way in which natural causes acted in the production of plants and\r\nanimals, must not make us forget the merit of his intuition that animals\r\nand plants _were_ produced by natural causes. In Dr. Darwin's brief\r\nexposition, the belief in a progressive genesis of organisms is joined with\r\nan interpretation having considerable definiteness and coherence. In the\r\nspace of ten pages he not only indicates several of the leading classes of\r\nfacts which support the hypothesis of development, but he does something\r\ntowards suggesting the process of development. His reasonings show an\r\nunconscious mingling of the belief in a supernaturally-impressed tendency\r\nto develop, with the belief in a development arising from the changing\r\nincidence of conditions. Probably had he pursued the inquiry further, this\r\nlast belief would have grown at the expense of the first. Lamarck, in\r\nelaborating this general conception, has given greater precision both to\r\nits truth and to its error. Asserting the same imaginary factors and the\r\nsame real factors, he has traced out their supposed actions in detail; and\r\nhas, in consequence, committed himself to a greater number of untenable\r\npositions. But while, in trying to reconcile the facts with a theory which\r\nis only an adumbration of the truth, he laid himself open to the criticisms\r\nof his contemporaries; he proved himself profounder than his contemporaries\r\nby seeing that natural genesis, however caused, has been going on. If they\r\nwere wise in not indorsing a theory which fails to account for a great part\r\nof the facts; they were unwise in ignoring that degree of congruity with\r\nthe facts, which shows the theory to contain some fundamental verity.\r\n\r\nLeaving out, however, the imaginary factors of evolution which these\r\nspeculations allege, and looking only at the one actual factor which Dr.\r\nDarwin and Lamarck assign as accounting for some of the phenomena; it is\r\nmanifest, from our present stand-point, that this, so far as it is a cause\r\nof evolution, is a proximate cause and not an ultimate cause. To say that\r\nfunctionally-produced adaptation to conditions originates either evolution\r\nin general, or the irregularities of evolution, is to raise the further\r\nquestion--why is there a functionally-produced adaptation to\r\nconditions?--why do use and disuse generate appropriate changes of\r\nstructure? Neither this nor any other interpretation of biologic evolution\r\nwhich rests simply on the basis of biologic induction, is an ultimate\r\ninterpretation.  The biologic induction must itself be interpreted. Only\r\nwhen the process of evolution of organisms is affiliated on the process of\r\nevolution in general, can it be truly said to be explained. The thing\r\nrequired is to show that its various results are corollaries from first\r\nprinciples. We have to reconcile the facts with the universal laws of the\r\nre-distribution of matter and motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nEXTERNAL FACTORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 148. When illustrating the rhythm of motion (_First Principles_, § 83) it\r\nwas pointed out that besides the daily and annual alternations in the\r\nquantities of light and heat which any portion of the Earth's surface\r\nreceives from the Sun, there are alternations which require\r\nimmensely-greater periods to complete. Reference was made to the fact that\r\n\"every planet, during a certain long period, presents more of its northern\r\nthan of its southern hemisphere to the Sun at the time of its nearest\r\napproach to him; and then again, during a like period, presents more of its\r\nsouthern hemisphere than of its northern--a recurring coincidence which,\r\nthough it causes in some planets no sensible alterations of climate,\r\ninvolves, in the case of the Earth, an epoch of 21,000 years during which\r\neach hemisphere goes through a cycle of temperate seasons, and seasons that\r\nare extreme in their heat and cold.\" Further, we saw that there is a\r\nvariation of this variation. The slow rhythm of temperate and intemperate\r\nclimates, which takes 21,000 years to complete itself, undergoes\r\nexaggeration and mitigation during epochs that are far longer. The Earth's\r\norbit slowly alters in form: now approximating to a circle, and now\r\nbecoming more eccentric. During the period in which the Earth's orbit has\r\nleast eccentricity, the temperate and intemperate climates which repeat\r\ntheir cycle in 21,000 years, are severally less temperate and less\r\nintemperate, than when, some one or two millions of years later, the\r\nEarth's orbit has reached its extreme of eccentricity.\r\n\r\nThus, besides those daily variations in the quantities of light and heat\r\nreceived by organisms, and responded to by variations in their functions;\r\nand besides the annual variations in the quantities of light and heat which\r\norganisms receive, and similarly respond to by variations in their\r\nfunctions; there are variations that severally complete themselves in\r\n21,000 years and in some millions of years--variations to which there must\r\nalso be responses in the changed functions of organisms. The whole vegetal\r\nand animal kingdoms, are subject to quadruply-compounded rhythms in the\r\nincidence of the forces on which life primarily depends--rhythms so\r\ninvolved in their slow working round that at no time during one of these\r\nvast epochs, can the incidence of these various forces be exactly the same\r\nas at any other time. To the direct effects so produced on organisms, have\r\nto be added much more important indirect effects. Changes of distribution\r\nmust result. Certain redistributions are occasioned even by the annual\r\nvariations in the quantities of the solar rays received by each part of the\r\nEarth's surface. The migrations of birds thus caused are familiar. So, too,\r\nare the migrations of certain fishes: in some cases from one part of the\r\nsea to another; in some cases from salt water to fresh water; and in some\r\ncases from fresh water to salt water. Now just as the yearly changes in the\r\namounts of light and heat falling on each locality, yearly extend and\r\nrestrict the habitats of many organisms which are able to move about with\r\nsome rapidity; so must the alterations of temperate and intemperate\r\nclimates produce extensions and restrictions of habitats. These, though\r\nslow, must be universal--must affect the habitats of stationary organisms\r\nas well as those of locomotive ones. For if, during an astronomic era,\r\nthere is going on at any limit to a plant's habitat, a diminution of the\r\nwinter's cold or summer's heat, which had before stopped its spread at that\r\nlimit; then, though the individual plants are fixed, yet the species will\r\nmove: the seeds of plants living at the limit, will produce individuals\r\nwhich survive beyond the limit. The gradual spread so effected, having gone\r\non for some ten thousand years, the opposite change of climate will begin\r\nto cause retreat. The tide of each species will, during one half of a long\r\nepoch, slowly flow into new regions, and then will slowly ebb away from\r\nthem. Further, this rise and fall in the tide of each species will, during\r\nfar longer intervals, undergo increasing rises and falls and then\r\ndecreasing rises and falls. There will be an alteration of spring tides and\r\nneap tides, answering to the changing eccentricity of the Earth's orbit.\r\n\r\nThese astronomical rhythms, therefore, entail on organisms unceasing\r\nchanges in the incidence of forces in two ways. They directly subject them\r\nto variations of solar influences, in such a manner that each generation is\r\nsomewhat differently affected in its functions; and they indirectly bring\r\nabout complicated alterations in the environing agencies, by carrying each\r\nspecies into the presence of new physical conditions, new soil and surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 149. The power of geological actions to modify everywhere the\r\ncircumstances in which plants and animals are placed, is conspicuous. In\r\neach locality denudation slowly uncovers different deposits, and slowly\r\nchanges the exposed areas of deposits already uncovered. Simultaneously,\r\nthe alluvial beds in course of formation, are qualitatively affected by\r\nthese progressive changes in the natures and proportions of the strata\r\ndenuded. The inclinations of surfaces and their directions with respect to\r\nthe Sun, are at the same time modified; and the organisms existing on them\r\nare thus having their thermal conditions continually altered, as well as\r\ntheir drainage. Igneous action, too, complicates these gradual\r\nmodifications. A flat region cannot be step by step thrust up into a\r\nprotuberance without unlike climatic changes being produced in its several\r\nparts, by their exposures to different aspects. Extrusions of trap,\r\nwherever they take place, revolutionize the localities; both over the areas\r\ncovered and over the areas on to which their detritus is carried. And where\r\nvolcanoes are formed, the ashes they occasionally send out modify the\r\ncharacter of the soil throughout large surrounding tracts.\r\n\r\nIn like manner alterations in the Earth's crust cause the ocean to be ever\r\nsubjecting the organisms it contains to new combinations of conditions.\r\nHere the water is being deepened by subsidence, and there shallowed by\r\nupheaval. While the falling upon it of sediment brought down by\r\nneighbouring large rivers, is raising the sea-bottom in one place, in\r\nanother the habitual rush of the tide is carrying away the sediment\r\ndeposited in past times. The mineral character of the submerged surface on\r\nwhich sea-weeds grow and molluscs crawl, is everywhere occasionally\r\nchanged; now by the bringing away from an adjacent shore some previously\r\nuntouched strata; and now by the accumulation of organic remains, such as\r\nthe shells of pteropods or of foraminifera. A further series of alterations\r\nin the circumstances of marine organisms, is entailed by changes in the\r\nmovements of the water. Each modification in the outlines of neighbouring\r\nshores makes the tidal streams vary their directions or velocities or both.\r\nAnd the local temperature is from time to time raised or lowered, because\r\nsome far-distant change of form in the Earth's crust has wrought a\r\ndivergence in those circulating currents of warm and cold water which\r\npervade the ocean.\r\n\r\nThese geologically-caused changes in the physical characters of each\r\nenvironment, occur in ever-new combinations, and with ever-increasing\r\ncomplexity. As already shown (_First Principles_, § 158), it follows from\r\nthe law of the multiplication of effects, that during long periods each\r\ntract of the Earth's surface increases in heterogeneity of both form and\r\nsubstance. So that plants and animals of all kinds are, in the course of\r\ngenerations, subjected by alterations in the crust of the Earth, to sets of\r\nincident forces differing from previous sets, both by changes in the\r\nproportions of the factors and, occasionally, by the addition of new\r\nfactors.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 150. Variations in the astronomical conditions joined with variations in\r\nthe geological conditions, bring about variations in the meteorological\r\nconditions. Those slow alternations of elevation and subsidence which take\r\nplace over immense areas, here producing a continent where once there was a\r\nfathomless ocean, and there causing wide seas to spread where in a long\r\npast epoch there stood snow-capped mountains, gradually work great\r\natmospheric changes. While the highest parts of an emerging surface of the\r\nEarth's crust exist as a cluster of islands, the plants and animals which\r\nin course of time migrate to them have climates that are peculiar to small\r\ntracts of land surrounded by large tracts of water. As, by successive\r\nupheavals, greater areas are exposed, there begin to arise sensible\r\ncontrasts between the states of their peripheral parts and their central\r\nparts. The breezes which daily moderate the extremes of temperature near\r\nthe shores, cease to affect the interiors; and the interiors, less\r\nqualified too in their heat and cold by such ocean-currents as approach the\r\ncoast, acquire more decidedly the characters due to their latitudes. Along\r\nwith the further elevations which unite the members of the archipelago into\r\na continent, there come new meteorologic changes, as well as exacerbations\r\nof the old. The winds, which were comparatively uniform in their directions\r\nand periods when only islands existed, grow involved in their distribution,\r\nand widely-different in different parts of the continent. The quantities of\r\nrain which they discharge and of moisture which they absorb, vary\r\neverywhere according to the proximity to the sea and to surfaces of land\r\nhaving special characters.\r\n\r\nOther complications result from variations of height above the sea:\r\nelevation producing a decrease of heat and consequently an increase in the\r\nprecipitation of water--a precipitation which takes the shape of snow where\r\nthe elevation is very great, and of rain where it is not so great. The\r\ngatherings of clouds and descents of showers around mountain tops, are\r\nfamiliar to every tourist. Inquiries in the neighbouring valleys prove that\r\nwithin distances of a mile or two the recurring storms differ in their\r\nfrequency and violence. Nay, even a few yards off, the meteorological\r\nconditions vary in such regions: as witness the way in which the condensing\r\nvapour keeps eddying round on one side of some high crag, while the other\r\nside is clear; or the way in which the snowline runs irregularly to\r\ndifferent heights, in all the hollows and ravines of each mountain side.\r\n\r\nAs climatic variations thus geologically produced, are compounded with\r\nthose which result from slow astronomical changes; and as no correspondence\r\nexists between the geologic and the astronomic rhythms; it results that the\r\nsame plexus of actions never recurs. Hence the incident forces to which the\r\norganisms of every locality are exposed by atmospheric agencies, are ever\r\npassing into unparalleled combinations; and these are on the average ever\r\nbecoming more complex.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 151. Besides changes in the incidence of inorganic forces, there are\r\nequally continuous, and still more involved, changes in the incidence of\r\nforces which organisms exercise on one another. As before pointed out\r\n(§ 105), the plants and animals inhabiting each locality are held together\r\nin so entangled a web of relations, that any considerable modification\r\nwhich one species undergoes, acts indirectly on many other species, and\r\neventually changes, in some degree, the circumstances of nearly all the\r\nrest. If an increase of heat, or modification of soil, or decrease of\r\nhumidity, causes a particular kind of plant either to thrive or to dwindle,\r\nan unfavourable or favourable effect is wrought on all such competing kinds\r\nof plants as are not immediately influenced in the same way. The animals\r\nwhich eat the seeds or browse on the leaves, either of the plant primarily\r\naffected or those of its competitors, are severally altered in their states\r\nof nutrition and in their numbers; and this change presently tells on\r\nvarious predatory animals and parasites. And since each of these secondary\r\nand tertiary changes becomes itself a centre of others, the increase or\r\ndecrease of each species produces waves of influence which spread and\r\nreverberate and re-reverberate throughout the whole Flora and Fauna of the\r\nlocality.\r\n\r\nMore marked and multiplied still, are the ultimate effects of those causes\r\nwhich make possible the colonization of neighbouring areas. Each intruding\r\nplant or animal, besides the new inorganic conditions to which it is\r\nsubject, is subject to organic conditions different from those to which it\r\nhas been accustomed. It has to compete with some organisms unlike those of\r\nits preceding habitat. It must preserve itself from enemies not before\r\nencountered. Or it may meet with a species over which it has some advantage\r\ngreater than any it had over the species it was previously in contact with.\r\nEven where migration does not bring it face to face with new competitors or\r\nnew enemies or new prey, it inevitably experiences new proportions among\r\nthese. Further, an expanding species is almost certain to invade more than\r\none adjacent region. Spreading both north and south, or east and west, it\r\nwill come among the plants and animals, here of a level district and there\r\nof a hilly one--here of an inland tract and there of a tract bordered by\r\nthe sea. And while different groups of its members will thus expose\r\nthemselves to the actions and reactions of different Floras and Faunas,\r\nthese different Floras and Faunas will simultaneously have their organic\r\nconditions changed by the intruders.\r\n\r\nThis process becomes gradually more active and more complicated. Though, in\r\nparticular cases, a plant or animal may fall into simpler relations with\r\nthe living things around than those it was before placed in, yet it is\r\nmanifest that, on the average, the organic environments of organisms have\r\nbeen advancing in heterogeneity. As the number of species with which each\r\nspecies is directly or indirectly implicated, multiplies, each species is\r\noftener subject to changes in the organic actions which influence it. These\r\nmore frequent changes severally grow more involved. And the corresponding\r\nreactions affect larger Floras and Faunas, in ways increasingly complex and\r\nvaried.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 152. When the astronomic, geologic, meteorologic, and organic agencies\r\nwhich are at work on each species of plant and animal are contemplated as\r\nbecoming severally more complicated in themselves, and as co-operating in\r\nways that are always partially new; it will be seen that throughout all\r\ntime there has been an exposure of organisms to endless successions of\r\nmodifying causes which gradually acquire an intricacy scarcely conceivable.\r\nEvery kind of plant and animal may be regarded as for ever passing into a\r\nnew environment--as perpetually having its relations to external\r\ncircumstances altered, either by their changes with respect to it when it\r\nremains stationary, or by its changes with respect to them when it\r\nmigrates, or by both.\r\n\r\nYet a further cause of progressive alteration and complication in the\r\nincident forces, exists. All other things continuing the same, every\r\nadditional faculty by which an organism is brought into relation with\r\nexternal objects, as well as every improvement in such faculty, becomes a\r\nmeans of subjecting the organism to a greater number and variety of\r\nexternal stimuli, and to new combinations of external stimuli. So that each\r\nadvance in complexity of organization, itself becomes an added source of\r\ncomplexity in the incidence of external forces.\r\n\r\nOnce more, every increase in the locomotive powers of animals, increases\r\nboth the multiplicity and the multiformity of the actions of things upon\r\nthem, and of their reactions upon things. Doubling a creature's activity\r\nquadruples the area that comes within the range of its excursions; thus\r\naugmenting in number and heterogeneity, the external agencies which act on\r\nit during any given interval.\r\n\r\nBy compounding the actions of these several orders of factors, there is\r\nproduced a geometric progression of changes, increasing with immense\r\nrapidity. And there goes on an equally rapid increase in the frequency with\r\nwhich the combinations of the actions are altered, and the intricacies of\r\ntheir co-operations enhanced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nINTERNAL FACTORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 153. We saw at the outset (§§ 10-16), that organic matter is built up of\r\nmolecules so unstable, that the slightest variation in their conditions\r\ndestroys their equilibrium, and causes them either to assume altered\r\nstructures or to decompose. But a substance which is beyond all others\r\nchangeable by the actions and reactions of the forces liberated from\r\ninstant to instant within its own mass, must be a substance which is beyond\r\nall others changeable by the forces acting on it from without. If their\r\ncomposition fits organic aggregates for undergoing with special facility\r\nand rapidity those re-distributions of matter and motion whence result\r\nindividual organization and life; then their composition must make them\r\nsimilarly apt to undergo those permanent re-distributions of matter and\r\nmotion which are expressed by changes of structure, in correspondence with\r\npermanent re-distributions of matter and motion in their environments.\r\n\r\nIn _First Principles_, when considering the phenomena of Evolution at\r\nlarge, the leading characters and causes of those changes which constitute\r\norganic evolution were briefly traced. Under each of the derivative laws of\r\nforce to which the passage from an incoherent, indefinite homogeneity to a\r\ncoherent, definite heterogeneity, conforms, were given illustrations drawn\r\nfrom the metamorphoses of living bodies. Here it will be needful to\r\ncontemplate the several resulting processes as going on at once, in both\r\nindividuals and species.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 154. Our postulate being that organic evolution in general commenced with\r\nhomogeneous organic matter, we have first to remember that the state of\r\nhomogeneity is an unstable state (_First Principles_, § 149). In any\r\naggregate \"the relations of outside and inside, and of comparative nearness\r\nto neighbouring sources of influence, imply the reception of influences\r\nthat are unlike in quantity, or quality, or both; and it follows that\r\nunlike changes will be produced in the parts thus dissimilarly acted upon.\"\r\nFurther, \"if any given whole, instead of being absolutely uniform\r\nthroughout, consists of parts distinguishable from one another--if each of\r\nthese parts, while somewhat unlike other parts, is uniform within itself;\r\nthen, each of them being in unstable equilibrium, it follows that while the\r\nchanges set up within it must render it multiform, they must at the same\r\ntime render the whole more multiform than before;\" and hence, \"whether that\r\nstate with which we commence be or be not one of perfect homogeneity, the\r\nprocess must equally be towards a relative heterogeneity.\" This loss of\r\nhomogeneity which the special instability of organic aggregates fits them\r\nto display more promptly and variously than any other aggregates, must be\r\nshown in more numerous ways in proportion as the incident forces are more\r\nnumerous. Every differentiation of structure being a result of some\r\ndifference in the relations of the parts to the agencies acting on them, it\r\nfollows that the more multiplied and more unlike the agencies, the more\r\nvaried must be the differentiations wrought. Hence the change from a state\r\nof homogeneity to a state of heterogeneity, will be marked in proportion as\r\nthe environing actions to which the organism is supposes it is only are\r\ncomplex. This transition from a uniform to a multiform state, must continue\r\nthrough successive individuals. Given a series of organisms, each of which\r\nis developed from a portion of a preceding organism, and the question is\r\nwhether, after exposure of the series for a million years to changed\r\nincident forces, one of its members will be the same as though the incident\r\nforces had only just changed. To say that it will, is implicitly to deny\r\nthe persistence of force. In relation to any cause of divergence, the whole\r\nseries of such organisms may be considered as fused together into a\r\ncontinuously-existing organism; and when so considered, it becomes manifest\r\nthat a continuously-acting cause will go on working a\r\ncontinuously-increasing effect, until some counteracting cause prevents any\r\nfurther effect.\r\n\r\nBut now if any primordial organic aggregate must, in itself and through its\r\ndescendants, gravitate from uniformity to multiformity, in obedience to the\r\nmore or less multiform forces acting on it; what must happen if these\r\nmultiform forces are themselves undergoing slow variations and\r\ncomplications? Clearly the process, ever-advancing towards a temporary\r\nlimit but ever having its limit removed, must go on unceasingly. On those\r\nstructural changes wrought in the once homogeneous aggregate by an original\r\nset of incident forces, will be superposed further changes wrought by a\r\nmodified set of incident forces; and so on throughout all time. Omitting\r\nfor the present those circumstances which check and qualify its\r\nconsequences, the instability of the homogeneous must be recognized as an\r\never-acting cause of organic evolution, as of all other evolution.\r\n\r\nWhile it follows that every organism, considered as an individual and as\r\none of a series, tends thus to pass into a more heterogeneous state; it\r\nalso follows that every species, considered as an aggregate of individuals,\r\ntends to do the like. Throughout the area it inhabits, the conditions can\r\nnever be absolutely uniform: its members must, in different parts of the\r\narea, be exposed to different sets of incident forces. Still more decided\r\nmust this difference of exposure be when its members spread into other\r\nhabitats. Those expansive and repressive energies which set to each species\r\na limit that perpetually oscillates from side to side of a certain mean,\r\nare, as we lately saw, frequently changed by new combinations of the\r\nexternal factors--astronomic, geologic, meteorologic, and organic. Hence\r\nthere from time to time arise lines of diminished resistance, along which\r\nthe species flows into new localities. Such portions of the species as thus\r\nmigrate, are subject to circumstances unlike its previous average\r\ncircumstances. And from multiformity of the circumstances, must come\r\nmultiformity of the species.\r\n\r\nThus the law of the instability of the homogeneous has here a three-fold\r\ncorollary. As interpreted in connexion with the ever-progressing,\r\never-complicating changes in external factors, it involves the conclusion\r\nthat there is a prevailing tendency towards greater heterogeneity in all\r\nkinds of organisms, considered both individually and in successive\r\ngenerations; as well as in each assemblage of organisms constituting a\r\nspecies; and, by consequence, in each genus, order, and class.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 155. When considering the causes of evolution in general, we further saw\r\n(_First Principles_, § 156), that the multiplication of effects aids\r\ncontinually to increase that heterogeneity into which homogeneity\r\ninevitably lapses. It was pointed out that since \"the several parts of an\r\naggregate are differently modified by any incident force;\" and since \"by\r\nthe reactions of the differently modified parts the incident force itself\r\nmust be divided into differently modified parts;\" it follows that \"each\r\ndifferentiated division of the aggregate thus becomes a centre from which a\r\ndifferentiated division of the original force is again diffused. And since\r\nunlike forces must produce unlike results, each of these differentiated\r\nforces must produce, throughout the aggregate, a further series of\r\ndifferentiations.\" To this it was added that, in proportion as the\r\nheterogeneity increases, the complications arising from this multiplication\r\nof effects grow more marked; because the more strongly contrasted the parts\r\nof an aggregate become, the more different must be their reactions on\r\nincident forces, and the more unlike must be the secondary effects which\r\nthese initiate; and because every increase in the number of unlike parts\r\nadds to the number of such differentiated incident forces, and such\r\nsecondary effects.\r\n\r\nHow this multiplication of effects conspires, with the instability of the\r\nhomogeneous, to work an increasing multiformity of structure in an\r\norganism, was shown at the time; and the foregoing pages contain further\r\nincidental illustrations. In § 69 it was pointed out that a change in one\r\nfunction must produce ever-complicating perturbations in other functions;\r\nand that, eventually, all parts of the organism must be modified in their\r\nstates. Suppose that the head of a bison becomes much heavier, what must be\r\nthe indirect results? The muscles of the neck are put to greater exertions;\r\nand its vertebræ have to bear additional tensions and pressures, caused\r\nboth by the increased weight of the head, and by the stronger contractions\r\nof the muscles that support and move it. These muscles also affect their\r\nspecial attachments: several of the dorsal spines suffer augmented strains;\r\nand the vertebræ to which they are fixed are more severely taxed. Further,\r\nthis heavier head and the more massive neck it necessitates, require a\r\nstronger fulcrum: the whole thoracic arch, and the fore-limbs which support\r\nit, are subject to greater continuous stress and more violent occasional\r\nshocks. And the required strengthening of the fore-quarters cannot take\r\nplace without the centre of gravity being changed, and the hind limbs being\r\ndifferently reacted upon during locomotion. Any one who compares the\r\noutline of the bison with that of its congener, the ox, will see how\r\nprofoundly a heavier head affects the entire osseous and muscular systems.\r\nBesides this multiplication of mechanical effects, there is a\r\nmultiplication of physiological effects. The vascular apparatus is modified\r\nthroughout its whole structure by each considerable modification in the\r\nproportions of the body. Increase in the size of any organ implies a\r\nquantitative, and often a qualitative, reaction on the blood; and thus\r\nalters the nutrition of all other organs. Such physiological correlations\r\nare exemplified in the many differences which accompany difference of sex.\r\nThat the minor sexual peculiarities are brought about by the physiological\r\nactions and reactions, is shown both by the fact that they are commonly but\r\nfaintly marked until the fundamentally distinctive organs are developed,\r\nand that when the development of these is prevented, the minor sexual\r\npeculiarities do not arise. No further proof is, I think, needed, that in\r\nany individual organism or its descendants, a new external action must,\r\nbesides the primary internal change which it works, work many secondary\r\nchanges, as well as tertiary changes still more multiplied. That tendency\r\ntowards greater heterogeneity which is given to an organism by disturbing\r\nits environment, is helped by the tendency which every modification has to\r\nproduce other modifications--modifications which must become more numerous\r\nin proportion as the organism becomes more complex. Lastly, among the\r\nindirect and involved manifestations of this tendency, we must not omit the\r\ninnumerable small irregularities of structure which result from the\r\ncrossing of dissimilarly-modified individuals. It was shown (§§ 89, 90)\r\nthat what are called \"spontaneous variations,\" are interpretable as results\r\nof miscellaneously compounding the changes wrought in different lines of\r\nancestors by different conditions of life. These still more complex and\r\nmultitudinous effects so produced, are further illustrations of the\r\nmultiplication of effects.\r\n\r\nEqually in the aggregate of individuals constituting a species, does\r\nmultiplication of effects become the continual cause of increasing\r\nmultiformity. The lapse of a species into divergent varieties, initiates\r\nfresh combinations of forces tending to work further divergences. The new\r\nvarieties compete with the parent species in new ways; and so add new\r\nelements to its circumstances. They modify somewhat the conditions of other\r\nspecies existing in their habitat, or in the habitat they have invaded; and\r\nthe modifications wrought in such other species become additional sources\r\nof influence. The Flora and Fauna of every region are united by their\r\nentangled relations into a whole, of which no part can be affected without\r\naffecting the rest. Hence, each differentiation in a local assemblage of\r\nspecies, becomes the cause of further differentiations.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 156. One of the universal principles to which we saw that the\r\nre-distribution of matter and motion conforms, is that in any aggregate\r\nmade up of mixed units, incident forces produce segregation--separate\r\nunlike units and bring together like units; and it was shown that the\r\nincreasing integration and definiteness which characterizes each part of an\r\nevolving organic aggregate, as of every other aggregate, results from this\r\n(_First Principles_, § 166). It remains here to say that while the actions\r\nand reactions between organisms and their changing environments, add to the\r\nheterogeneity of organic structures, they also give to the heterogeneity\r\nthis growing distinctness. At first sight the reverse might be inferred. It\r\nmight be argued that any new set of effects wrought in an organism by some\r\nnew set of external forces, must tend more or less to obliterate the\r\neffects previously wrought--must produce confusion or indefiniteness. A\r\nlittle consideration, however, will dissipate this impression.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the condition under which alone increasing definiteness of\r\nstructure can be acquired by any part of an organism, either in an\r\nindividual or in successive generations, is that such part shall be exposed\r\nto some set of tolerably-constant forces; and doubtless, continual change\r\nof circumstances interferes with this. But the interference can never be\r\nconsiderable. For the pre-existing structure of an organism prevents it\r\nfrom living under any new conditions except such as are congruous with the\r\nfundamental characters of its organization--such as subject its essential\r\norgans to actions substantially the same as before. Great changes must kill\r\nit. Hence, it can continuously expose itself and its descendants, only to\r\nthose moderate changes which do not destroy the general harmony between the\r\naggregate of incident forces and the aggregate of its functions. That is,\r\nit must remain under influences calculated to make greater the definiteness\r\nof the chief differentiations already produced. If, for example, we set out\r\nwith an animal in which a rudimentary vertebral column with its attached\r\nmuscular system has been established; it is clear that the mechanical\r\narrangements have become thereby so far determined, that subsequent\r\nmodifications are extremely likely, if not certain, to be consistent with\r\nthe production of movement by the actions of muscles on a flexible central\r\naxis. Hence, there will continue a general similarity in the play of forces\r\nto which the flexible central axis is subject; and so, notwithstanding the\r\nmetamorphoses which the vertebrate type undergoes, there will be a\r\nmaintenance of conditions favourable to increasing definiteness and\r\nintegration of the vertebral column. Moreover, this maintenance of such\r\nconditions becomes secure in proportion as organization advances. Each\r\nfurther complexity of structure, implying some further complexity in the\r\nrelations between an organism and its environment, must tend to specialize\r\nthe actions and reactions between it and its environment--must tend to\r\nincrease the stringency with which it is restrained within such\r\nenvironments as admit of those special actions and reactions for which its\r\nstructure fits it; that is, must further guarantee the continuance of those\r\nactions and reactions to which its essential organs respond, and therefore\r\nthe continuance of the segregating process.\r\n\r\nHow in each species, considered as an aggregate of individuals, there must\r\narise stronger and stronger contrasts among those divergent varieties which\r\nresult from the instability of the homogeneous and the multiplication of\r\neffects, need only be briefly indicated. It has already been shown (_First\r\nPrinciples_, § 166), that in conformity to the universal law that mixed\r\nunits are segregated by like incident forces, there are produced\r\nincreasingly-definite distinctions among varieties, wherever there occur\r\ndefinitely-distinguished sets of conditions to which the varieties are\r\nrespectively subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 157. Probably in the minds of some, the reading of this chapter has been\r\naccompanied by a running commentary, to the effect that the argument proves\r\ntoo much. The apparent implication is, that the passage from an indefinite,\r\nincoherent homogeneity to a definite, coherent heterogeneity in organic\r\naggregates, must have been going on universally; whereas we find that in\r\nmany cases there has been persistence without progression. This apparent\r\nimplication, however, is not a real one.\r\n\r\nFor though every environment on the Earth's surface undergoes changes; and\r\nthough usually the organisms which each environment contains, cannot escape\r\ncertain resulting new influences; yet occasionally such new influences are\r\nescaped, by the survival of species in the unchanged parts of their\r\nhabitats, or by their spread into neighbouring habitats which the change\r\nhas rendered like their original habitats, or by both. Any alteration in\r\nthe temperature of a climate or its degree of humidity, is unlikely to\r\naffect simultaneously the whole area occupied by a species; and further, it\r\ncan scarcely fail to happen that the addition or subtraction of heat or\r\nmoisture, will give to a part of some adjacent area, a climate like that to\r\nwhich the species has been habituated. If, again, the circumstances of a\r\nspecies are modified by the intrusion of some foreign kind of plant or\r\nanimal, it follows that since the intruders will probably not spread\r\nthroughout its whole habitat, the species will, in one or more localities,\r\nremain unaffected by them. Especially among marine creatures, must there\r\nfrequently occur cases in which modifying causes are continually eluded.\r\nComparatively uniform as are the physical conditions to which the sea\r\nexposes its inhabitants, it becomes possible for such of them as live on\r\nwidely-diffused food, to be widely distributed; and wide distribution\r\ngenerally prevents the members of a species from being all subject to the\r\nsame cause. Our commonest cirriped, for instance, subsisting on minute\r\ncreatures everywhere dispersed through the water; needing only to have some\r\nfirm surface on which to build up its shell; and in scarcely any danger\r\nfrom surrounding animals; is able to exist on shores so widely remote from\r\none another, that nearly every change in the incident forces must fall\r\nwithin narrower areas than that which the species occupies. Nearly always,\r\ntherefore, a portion of the species will survive unmodified. Its\r\neasily-transported germs will take possession of such new habitats as have\r\nbeen rendered fitter by the change that has unfitted some parts of its\r\noriginal habitat. Hence, on successive occasions, while some parts of the\r\nspecies are slightly transformed, another part may continually escape\r\ntransformation by migrating hither and thither, where the simple conditions\r\nneeded for its existence recur in nearly the same combinations as before.\r\nAnd it will so become possible for it to survive, with insignificant\r\nstructural changes, throughout long geologic periods.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 158. The results to which we find ourselves led, are these.\r\n\r\nIn subordination to the different amounts and kinds of forces to which its\r\ndifferent parts are exposed, every individual organic aggregate, like all\r\nother aggregates, tends to pass from its original indistinct simplicity\r\ntowards a more distinct complexity. Unless we deny the persistence of\r\nforce, we must admit that the lapse of an organism's structure from an\r\nindefinitely homogeneous to a definitely heterogeneous state, must be\r\ncumulative in successive generations, if the forces causing it continue to\r\nact. And for the like reasons, the increasing assemblage of individuals\r\narising from a common stock, is also liable to lose its original\r\nuniformity; and, in successive generations, to grow more pronounced in its\r\nmultiformity.\r\n\r\nThese changes, which would go to but a comparatively small extent were\r\norganisms exposed to constant external conditions, are kept up by the\r\ncontinual changes in external conditions, produced by astronomic, geologic,\r\nmeteorologic, and organic agencies: the average result being, that on\r\nprevious complications wrought by previous incident forces, new\r\ncomplications are continually superposed by new incident forces. And hence\r\nsimultaneously arises increasing heterogeneity in the structures of\r\nindividuals, in the structures of species, and in the structures of the\r\nEarth's Flora and Fauna.\r\n\r\nBut while, in very many or in most cases, the ever-changing incidence of\r\nforces is ever adding to the complexity of organisms, and to the complexity\r\nof the organic world as a whole; it does this only where its action cannot\r\nbe eluded. And since, by migration, it is possible for a species to keep\r\nitself under conditions that are tolerably constant, there must be a\r\nproportion of cases in which greater heterogeneity of structure is not to\r\nbe expected.\r\n\r\nTo show, however, that there must arise a certain average tendency to the\r\nproduction of greater heterogeneity is not sufficient. Aggregates might be\r\nrendered more heterogeneous by changing incident forces, without having\r\ngiven to them that kind of heterogeneity required for carrying on life.\r\nHence it remains now to inquire how the production and maintenance of this\r\nkind of heterogeneity is insured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nDIRECT EQUILIBRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 159. Every change is towards a balance of forces; and of necessity can\r\nnever cease until a balance of forces is reached. When treating of\r\nequilibration under its general aspects (_First Principles_, Part II.,\r\nChap. xxii.), we saw that every aggregate having compound movements tends\r\ncontinually towards a moving equilibrium; since any unequilibrated force to\r\nwhich such an aggregate is subject, if not of a kind to overthrow it\r\naltogether, must continue modifying its state until an equilibrium is\r\nbrought about. And we saw that the structure simultaneously reached must be\r\n\"one presenting an arrangement of forces that counterbalance all the forces\r\nto which the aggregate is subject;\" since, \"so long as there remains a\r\nresidual force in any direction--be it excess of a force exercised by an\r\naggregate on its environment, or of a force exercised by its environment on\r\nthe aggregate, equilibrium does not exist; and therefore the\r\nre-distribution of matter must continue.\"\r\n\r\nIt is essential that this truth should here be fully comprehended; and to\r\nthe end of insuring clear comprehension of it, some re-illustration is\r\ndesirable. The case of the Solar System will best serve our purpose. An\r\nassemblage of bodies, each of which has its simple and compound motions\r\nthat severally alternate between two extremes, and the whole of which has\r\nits involved perturbations, that now increase and now decrease, is here\r\npresented to us. Suppose a new factor were brought to bear on this moving\r\nequilibrium--say by the arrival of some wandering mass, or by an additional\r\nmomentum given to one of the existing masses--what would be the result? If\r\nthe strange body or the extra energy were very large, it might so derange\r\nthe entire system as to cause its collapse. But what if the incident\r\nenergy, falling on the system from without, proved insufficient to\r\noverthrow it? There would then arise a set of perturbations which would, in\r\nthe course of an enormous period, slowly work round into a modified moving\r\nequilibrium. The effects primarily impressed on the adjacent masses, and in\r\na smaller degree on the remoter masses, would presently become complicated\r\nwith the secondary effects impressed by the disturbed masses on one\r\nanother; and these again with tertiary effects. Waves of perturbation would\r\ncontinue to be propagated throughout the entire system; until, around a new\r\ncentre of gravity, there had been established a set of planetary motions\r\ndifferent from the preceding ones. The new energy must gradually be used up\r\nin overcoming the energies resisting the divergence it generates; which\r\nantagonizing energies, when no longer opposed, set up a counter-action,\r\nending in a compensating divergence in the opposite direction, followed by\r\na re-compensating divergence, and so on. Now though instead of being, like\r\nthe Solar System, in a state of _independent_ moving equilibrium, an\r\norganism is in a state of _dependent_ moving equilibrium (_First\r\nPrinciples_, § 170); yet this does not prevent the manifestation of the\r\nsame law. Every animal daily obtains from without, a supply of energy to\r\nreplace the energy it expends; but this continual giving to its parts a new\r\nmomentum, to make up for the momentum continually lost, does not interfere\r\nwith the carrying on of actions and reactions like those just described.\r\nHere, as before, we have a definitely-arranged aggregate of parts, called\r\norgans, having their definitely-established actions and reactions, called\r\nfunctions.  These rhythmical actions or functions, and the various compound\r\nrhythms resulting from their combinations, are so adjusted as to balance\r\nthe actions to which the organism is subject: there is a constant or\r\nperiodic genesis of energies which, in their kinds, amounts, and\r\ndirections, suffice to antagonize the energies the organism has constantly\r\nor periodically to bear. If, then, there exists this moving equilibrium\r\namong a set of internal actions, exposed to a set of external actions, what\r\nmust result if any of the external actions are changed? Of course there is\r\nno longer an equilibrium. Some energy which the organism habitually\r\ngenerates, is too great or too small to balance some incident energy; and\r\nthere arises a residual energy exerted by the environment on the organism,\r\nor by the organism on the environment. This residual or unbalanced energy,\r\nof necessity expends itself in producing some change of state in the\r\norganism. Acting directly on some organ and modifying its function, it\r\nindirectly modifies dependent functions and remotely influences all the\r\nfunctions. As we have already seen (§§ 68, 69), if this new energy is\r\npermanent, its effects must be gradually diffused throughout the entire\r\nsystem; until it has come to be equilibrated in producing those structural\r\nrearrangements whence result a counter-balancing energy.\r\n\r\nThe bearing of this general truth on the question we are now dealing with\r\nis obvious. Those modifications upon modifications, which the unceasing\r\nmutations of their environments have been all along generating in\r\norganisms, have been in each case modifications involved by the\r\nestablishment of a new balance with the new combination of actions. In\r\nevery species throughout all geologic time, there has been perpetually\r\ngoing on a rectification of the equilibrium, which has been perpetually\r\ndisturbed by the alteration of its circumstances; and every further\r\nheterogeneity has been the addition of a structural change entailed by a\r\nnew equilibration, to the structural changes entailed by previous\r\nequilibrations. There can be no other ultimate interpretation of the\r\nmatter, since change can have no other goal.\r\n\r\nThis equilibration between the functions of an organism and the actions in\r\nits environment, may be either direct or indirect. The new incident force\r\nmay either immediately call forth some counteracting force, and its\r\nconcomitant structural change; or it may be eventually balanced by some\r\notherwise-produced change of function and structure. These two processes of\r\nequilibration are quite distinct, and must be separately dealt with. We\r\nwill devote this chapter to the first of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 160. Direct equilibration is that process currently known as\r\n_adaptation_. We have already seen (Part II., Chap, v.), that individual\r\norganisms become modified when placed in new conditions of life--so\r\nmodified as to re-adjust the powers to the requirements; and though there\r\nis great difficulty in disentangling the evidence, we found reason for\r\nthinking (§ 82) that structural changes thus caused by functional changes\r\nare inherited. In the last chapter, it was argued that if, instead of the\r\nsuccession of individuals constituting a species, there were a\r\ncontinuously-existing individual, any functional and structural divergence\r\nproduced by a new incident action, would increase until the new incident\r\naction was counterpoised; and that the replacing of a continuously-existing\r\nindividual by a succession of individuals, each formed out of the modified\r\nsubstance of its predecessor, will not prevent the like effect from being\r\nproduced. Here we further find that this limit towards which any such\r\norganic change advances, in the species as in the individual, is a new\r\nmoving equilibrium adjusted to the new arrangement of external forces.\r\n\r\nBut now what are the conditions under which alone, direct equilibration can\r\noccur? Are all the modifications that serve to re-fit organisms to their\r\nenvironments, directly adaptive modifications?  And if otherwise, which are\r\nthe directly adaptive and which are not?  How are we to distinguish between\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nThere can be no direct equilibration with an external agency which, if it\r\nacts at all, acts fatally; since the organism to be adapted disappears.\r\nConversely, some inaccessible benefit which a small modification in the\r\norganism would make accessible, cannot by its action tend to produce this\r\nmodification: the modification and the benefit do not stand in dynamic\r\nrelation. The only new incident forces which can work the changes of\r\nfunction and structure required to bring any animal or plant into\r\nequilibrium with them, are such incident forces as operate on this animal\r\nor plant, either continuously or frequently. They must be capable of\r\nappreciably changing that set of complex rhythmical actions and reactions\r\nconstituting the life of the organism; and yet must not usually produce\r\nperturbations that are fatal. Let us see what are the limits to direct\r\nequilibration hence arising.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 161. In plants, organs engaged in nutrition, and exposed to variations in\r\nthe amounts and proportions of matters and forces utilized in nutrition,\r\nmay be expected to undergo corresponding variations. We find evidence that\r\nthey do this. The \"changes of habit\" which are common in plants, when taken\r\nto places unlike in climate or soil to those before inhabited by them, are\r\nchanges of parts in which the modified external actions directly produce\r\nmodified internal actions. The characters of the stem and shoots as woody\r\nor succulent, erect or procumbent; of the leaves in respect of their sizes,\r\nthicknesses, and textures; of the roots in their degrees of development and\r\nmodes of growth; are obviously in immediate relation to the characters of\r\nthe environment. A permanent difference in the quantity of light or heat\r\naffects, day after day, the processes going on in the leaves. Habitual rain\r\nor drought alters all the assimilative actions, and appreciably influences\r\nthe organs that carry them on. Some particular substance, by its presence\r\nin the soil, gives new qualities to some of the tissues; causing greater\r\nrigidity or flexibility, and so affecting the general aspect. Here then we\r\nhave changes towards modified sets of functions and structures, in\r\nequilibrium with modified sets of external forces.\r\n\r\nBut now let us turn to other classes of organs possessed by plants--organs\r\nwhich are not at once affected in their actions by variations of incident\r\nforces. Take first the organs of defence. Many plants are shielded against\r\nanimals that would else devour them, by formidable thorns; and others, like\r\nthe nettle, by stinging hairs. These must be counted among the appliances\r\nby which equilibrium is maintained between the actions in the organism and\r\nthe actions in its environment; seeing that were these defences absent, the\r\ndestruction by herbivorous animals would be so much increased, that the\r\nnumber of young plants annually produced would not suffice, as it now does,\r\nto balance the mortality, and the species would disappear. But these\r\ndefensive appliances, though they aid in maintaining the balance between\r\ninner and outer actions, cannot have been directly called forth by the\r\nouter actions which they serve to neutralize; for these outer actions do\r\nnot continuously affect the functions of the plant even in a general way,\r\nstill less in the special way required. Suppose a species of nettle bare of\r\npoison-hairs, to be habitually eaten by some mammal intruding on its\r\nhabitat. The actions of this mammal would have no direct tendency to\r\ndevelop poison-hairs in the plant; since the individuals devoured could not\r\nbequeath changes of structure, even were the actions of a kind to produce\r\nfit ones; and since the individuals which perpetuated themselves would be\r\nthose on which the new incident force had not fallen. Organs of another\r\nclass, similarly circumstanced, are those of reproduction. Like the organs\r\nof defence these are not, during the life of the individual plant, variably\r\nexercised by variable external actions; and therefore do not fulfil those\r\nconditions under which structural changes may be directly caused by changes\r\nin the environment. The generative apparatus contained in every flower acts\r\nonly once during its existence; and even then, the parts subserve their\r\nends in a passive rather than an active way. Functionally-produced\r\nmodifications are therefore out of the question. If a plant's anthers are\r\nso placed that the insect which most commonly frequents its flowers, must\r\ncome in contact with the pollen, and fertilize with it other flowers of the\r\nsame species; and if this insect, dwindling away or disappearing from the\r\nlocality, leaves behind no insects having such shapes and habits as cause\r\nthem to do the same thing efficiently, but only some which do it\r\ninefficiently; it is clear that this change of its conditions has no\r\nimmediate tendency to work in the plant any such structural change as shall\r\nbring about a new balance with its conditions. For the anthers, which, even\r\nwhen they discharge their functions, do it simply by standing in the way of\r\nthe insect, are, under the supposed circumstances, left untouched by the\r\ninsect; and this remaining untouched cannot have the effect of so modifying\r\nthe stamens as to bring the anthers into a position to be touched by some\r\nother insect. Only those individuals whose parts of fructification so far\r\ndiffered from the average form that some other insect could serve them as\r\npollen-carrier, would have good chances of perpetuating themselves. And on\r\ntheir progeny, inheriting the deviation, there would act no external force\r\ndirectly tending to make the deviation greater; since the new circumstances\r\nto which re-adaptation is required, are such as do not in the least alter\r\nthe equilibrium of functions constituting the life of the individual plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 162. Among animals, adaptation by direct equilibration is similarly\r\ntraceable wherever, during the life of the individual, an external change\r\ngenerates some constant or repeated change of function. This is\r\nconspicuously the case with such parts of an animal as are immediately\r\nexposed to diffused influences, like those of climate, and with such parts\r\nof an animal as are occupied in its mechanical actions on the environment.\r\nOf the one class of cases, the darkening of the skin which follows exposure\r\nto one or other extreme of temperature, may be taken as an instance; and\r\nwith the other class of cases we are made familiar by the increase and\r\ndecrease which use and disuse cause in the organs of motion. It is needless\r\nhere to exemplify these: they were treated of in the Second Part of this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nBut in animals, as in plants, there are many indispensable offices\r\nfulfilled by parts between which and the external conditions they respond\r\nto, there is no such action and reaction as can directly produce an\r\nequilibrium. This is especially manifest with dermal appendages. Some\r\nground exists for the conclusion that the greater or less development of\r\nhairs, is in part immediately due to increase or decrease of demand on the\r\npassive function, as forming a non-conducting coat; but be this as it may,\r\nit is impossible that there can exist any such cause for those immense\r\ndevelopments of hairs which we see in the quills of the porcupine, or those\r\ncomplex developments of them known as feathers. Such an enamelled armour as\r\nis worn by _Lepidosteus_, is inexplicable as a direct result of any\r\nfunctionally-worked change. For purposes of defence, such an armour is as\r\nneedful, or more needful, for hosts of other fishes; and did it result from\r\nany direct reaction of the organism against any offensive actions it was\r\nsubject to, there seems no reason why other fishes should not have\r\ndeveloped similar protective coverings. Of sundry reproductive appliances\r\nthe like may be said. The secretion of an egg-shell round the substance of\r\nan egg, in the oviduct of a bird, is quite inexplicable as a consequence of\r\nsome functionally-wrought modification of structure, immediately caused by\r\nsome modification of external conditions. The end fulfilled by the\r\negg-shell, is that of protecting the contained mass against certain slight\r\npressures and collisions, to which it is liable during incubation. How, by\r\nany process of direct equilibration, could it come to have the required\r\nthickness? or, indeed, how could it come to exist at all? Suppose this\r\nprotective envelope to be too weak, so that some of the eggs a bird lays\r\nare broken or cracked. In the first place, the breakages or crackings are\r\nactions which cannot react on the maternal organism in such ways as to\r\ncause the secretion of thicker shells for the future: to suppose that they\r\ncan, is to suppose that the bird understands the cause of the evil, and\r\nthat the secretion of thicker shells can be effected by its will. In the\r\nsecond place, such developing chicks as are contained in the shells which\r\ncrack or break, are almost certain to die; and cannot, therefore, acquire\r\nappropriately-modified constitutions: even supposing any relation could\r\nexist between the impression received and the change required. Meanwhile,\r\nsuch eggs as escape breakage are not influenced at all by the requirement;\r\nand hence, on the birds developed from them, there cannot have acted any\r\nforce tending to work the needful adjustment of functions. In no way,\r\ntherefore, can a direct equilibration between constitution and conditions\r\nbe here produced. Even in organs that can be modified by certain incident\r\nactions into correspondence with such incident actions, there are some\r\nre-adjustments which cannot be effected by direct balancing. It is thus\r\nwith the bones. The majority of the bones have to resist muscular strains;\r\nand variations in the muscular strains call forth, by reaction, variations\r\nin the strengths of the bones. Here there is direct equilibration. But\r\nthough the greater massiveness acquired by bones subject to greater\r\nstrains, may be ascribed to counter-acting forces evoked by forces brought\r\ninto action; it is impossible that the acquirement of greater lengths by\r\nbones can be thus accounted for. It has been supposed that the elongation\r\nof the metatarsals in wading birds, has resulted from direct adaptation to\r\nconditions of life. To justify this supposition, however, it must be shown\r\nthat the mechanical actions and reactions in the legs of a wading bird,\r\ndiffer from those in the legs of other birds; and that the differential\r\nactions are equilibrated by the extra lengths. There is not the slightest\r\nevidence of this. The metatarsals of a bird have to bear no appreciable\r\nstrains but those due to the superincumbent weight. Standing in the water\r\ndoes not appreciably alter such strains; and even if it did, an increase in\r\nthe lengths of these bones would not fit them any better to meet the\r\naltered strains.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 163. The conclusion at which we arrive is, then, that there go on in all\r\norganisms, certain changes of function and structure that are directly\r\nconsequent on changes in the incident forces--inner changes by which the\r\nouter changes are balanced, and the equilibrium restored. Such\r\nre-equilibrations, which are often conspicuously exhibited in individuals,\r\nwe have reason to believe continue in successive generations; until they\r\nare completed by the arrival at structures fitted to the modified\r\nconditions. But, at the same time, we see that the modified conditions to\r\nwhich organisms may be adapted by direct equilibration, are conditions of\r\ncertain classes only. That a new external action may be met by a new\r\ninternal action, it is needful that it shall either continuously or\r\nfrequently be borne by the individuals of the species, without killing or\r\nseriously injuring them; and shall act in such way as to affect their\r\nfunctions. And we find that many of the environing agencies--evil or\r\ngood--to which organisms have to be adjusted, are not of these kinds: being\r\nagencies which either do not immediately affect the functions at all, or\r\nelse affect them in ways that prove fatal.\r\n\r\nHence there must be at work some other process which equilibrates the\r\nactions of organisms with the actions they are exposed to. Plants and\r\nanimals that continue to exist, are necessarily plants and animals whose\r\npowers balance the powers acting on them; and as their environments change,\r\nthe changes which plants and animals undergo must necessarily be changes\r\ntowards re-establishment of the balance. Besides direct equilibration,\r\nthere must therefore be an indirect equilibration. How this goes on we have\r\nnow to inquire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nINDIRECT EQUILIBRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 164. Besides those perturbations produced in any organism by special\r\ndisturbing forces, there are ever going on many others--the reverberating\r\neffects of disturbing forces previously experienced by the individual, or\r\nby ancestors; and the multiplied deviations of function so caused imply\r\nmultiplied deviations of structure. In § 155 there was re-illustrated the\r\ntruth, set forth at length when treating of Adaptation (§ 69), that an\r\norganism in a state of moving equilibrium, cannot have extra function\r\nthrown on any organ, and extra growth produced in such organ, without\r\ncorrelative changes being entailed throughout all other functions, and\r\neventually throughout all other organs. And when treating of Variation\r\n(§ 90), we saw that individuals which have been made, by their different\r\ncircumstances, to deviate functionally and structurally from the average\r\ntype in different directions, will bequeath to their joint offspring,\r\ncompound perturbations of function and compound deviations of structure,\r\nendlessly varied in their kinds and amounts.\r\n\r\nNow if the individuals of a species are thus necessarily made unlike in\r\ncountless ways and degrees--if in one individual the amount of energy in a\r\nparticular direction is greater than in any other individual, or if here a\r\npeculiar combination gives a resulting action which is not found elsewhere;\r\nthen, among all the individuals, some will be less liable than others to\r\nhave their equilibria overthrown by a particular incident force previously\r\nunexperienced. Unless the change in the environment is so violent as to be\r\nuniversally fatal to the species, it must affect more or less differently\r\nthe slightly-different moving equilibria which the members of the species\r\npresent. Inevitably some will be more stable than others when exposed to\r\nthis new or altered factor. That is to say, those individuals whose\r\nfunctions are most out of equilibrium with the modified aggregate of\r\nexternal forces, will be those to die; and those will survive whose\r\nfunctions happen to be most nearly in equilibrium with the modified\r\naggregate of external forces.\r\n\r\nBut this survival of the fittest[52] implies multiplication of the fittest.\r\nOut of the fittest thus multiplied there will, as before, be an\r\noverthrowing of the moving equilibrium wherever it presents the least\r\nopposing force to the new incident force. And by the continual destruction\r\nof the individuals least capable of maintaining their equilibria in\r\npresence of this new incident force, there must eventually be reached an\r\naltered type completely in equilibrium with the altered conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 165. This survival of the fittest, which I have here sought to express in\r\nmechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called \"natural selection,\r\nor the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life.\" That there\r\ngoes on a process of this kind throughout the organic world, Mr. Darwin's\r\ngreat work on the _Origin of Species_ has shown to the satisfaction of\r\nnearly all naturalists. Indeed, when once enunciated, the truth of his\r\nhypothesis is so obvious as scarcely to need proof. Though evidence may be\r\nrequired to show that natural selection accounts for everything ascribed to\r\nit, yet no evidence is required to show that natural selection has always\r\nbeen going on, is going on now, and must ever continue to go on.\r\nRecognizing this as an _à priori_ certainty, let us contemplate it under\r\nits two distinct aspects.\r\n\r\nThat organisms which live, thereby prove themselves fit for living, in so\r\nfar as they have been tried, while organisms which die, thereby prove\r\nthemselves in some respects unfitted for living, are facts no less manifest\r\nthan is the fact that this self-purification of a species must tend ever to\r\ninsure adaptation between it and its environment. This adaptation may be\r\neither so _maintained_ or so _produced_. Doubtless many who have looked at\r\nNature with philosophic eyes, have observed that death of the worst and\r\nmultiplication of the best, tends towards maintenance of a constitution in\r\nharmony with surrounding circumstances. That the average vigour of any race\r\nwould be diminished did the diseased and feeble habitually survive and\r\npropagate; and that the destruction of such, through failure to fulfil some\r\nof the conditions to life, leaves behind those which are able to fulfil the\r\nconditions to life, and thus keeps up the average fitness to the conditions\r\nof life; are almost self-evident truths. But to recognize \"Natural\r\nSelection\" as a means of preserving an already-established balance between\r\nthe powers of a species and the forces to which it is subject, is to\r\nrecognize only its simplest and most general mode of action. It is the more\r\nspecial mode of action with which we are here concerned. This more special\r\nmode of action, Mr. Darwin has been the first to recognize as an\r\nall-important factor, though, besides his co-discoverer Mr. A. R. Wallace,\r\nsome others have perceived that such a factor is at work. To him we owe due\r\nappreciation of the fact that natural selection is capable of _producing_\r\nfitness between organisms and their circumstances. He has worked up an\r\nenormous mass of evidence showing that this \"preservation of favoured races\r\nin the struggle for life,\" is an ever-acting cause of divergence among\r\norganic forms. He has traced out the involved results of the process with\r\nmarvellous subtlety. He has shown how hosts of otherwise inexplicable\r\nfacts, are accounted for by it. In brief, he has proved that the cause he\r\nalleges is a true cause; that it is a cause which we see habitually in\r\naction; and that the results to be inferred from it are in harmony with the\r\nphenomena which the Organic Creation presents, both as a whole and in its\r\ndetails. Let us glance at a few of the more important interpretations which\r\nthe hypothesis furnishes.\r\n\r\nA soil possessing some ingredient in unusual quantity, may supply to a\r\nplant an excess of the matter required for certain of its tissues; and may\r\ncause all the parts formed of such tissues to be abnormally developed.\r\nSuppose that among these are the hairs clothing its surfaces, including\r\nthose which grow on its seeds. Thus furnished with somewhat longer fibres,\r\nits seeds, when shed, are carried a little further by the wind before they\r\nfall to the ground. The plants growing from them, being rather more widely\r\ndispersed than those produced by other individuals of the same species,\r\nwill be less liable to smother one another; and a greater number may\r\ntherefore reach maturity and fructify. Supposing the next generation\r\nsubject to the same peculiarity of nutrition, some of the seeds borne by\r\nits members will not simply inherit this increased development of hairs,\r\nbut will carry it further; and these, still more advantaged in the same way\r\nas before, will, on the average, have still more numerous chances of\r\ncontinuing the race. Thus, by the survival, generation after generation, of\r\nthose possessing these longer hairs, and the inheritance of successive\r\nincrements of growth in the hairs, there may result a seed deviating\r\ngreatly from the original. Other individuals of the same species, subject\r\nto the different physical conditions of other localities, may develop\r\nsomewhat thicker or harder coatings to their seeds: so rendering their\r\nseeds less digestible by the birds which devour them. Such thicker-coated\r\nseeds, by escaping undigested more frequently than thinner-coated ones,\r\nwill have additional chances of growing and leaving offspring; and this\r\nprocess, acting in a cumulative manner season after season, will produce a\r\nseed diverging in another direction from the ancestral type. Again,\r\nelsewhere, some modification in the physiologic actions of the plant may\r\nlead to an unusual secretion of an essential oil in the seeds; rendering\r\nthem unpalatable to creatures which would otherwise feed on them: so giving\r\nan advantage to the variety in its rate of multiplication. This incidental\r\npeculiarity, proving a preservative, will, as before, be increased by\r\nnatural selection until it constitutes another divergence. Now in such\r\ncases, we see that plants may become better adapted, or re-adapted, to the\r\naggregate of surrounding agencies, not through any _direct_ action of such\r\nagencies on them, but through their _indirect_ action--through the\r\ndestruction by them of the individuals least congruous with them, and the\r\nsurvival of those most congruous with them. All these slight variations of\r\nfunction and structure, arising among the members of a species, serve as so\r\nmany experiments; the great majority of which fail, but a few of which\r\nsucceed. Just as each plant bears a multitude of seeds, out of which some\r\ntwo or three happen to fulfil all the conditions required for reaching\r\nmaturity and continuing the race; so each species is ever producing\r\nnumerous slightly-modified forms, deviating in all directions from the\r\naverage, out of which most fit the surrounding conditions no better than\r\ntheir parents, or not so well, but some few of which fit the conditions\r\nbetter; and, doing so, are enabled the better to preserve themselves, and\r\nto produce offspring similarly capable of preserving themselves.  Among\r\nanimals the like process results in the like development of various\r\nstructures which cannot have been affected by the performance of\r\nfunctions--their functions being purely passive. The thick shell of a\r\nmollusk cannot have arisen from direct reactions of the organism against\r\nthe external actions to which it is exposed; but it is quite explicable as\r\nan effect of the survival, generation after generation, of individuals\r\nwhose thicker coverings protected them against enemies. Similarly with such\r\ndermal structure as that of the tortoise. Though we have evidence that the\r\nskin, where it is continually exposed to pressure and friction, may\r\nthicken, and so re-establish the equilibrium by opposing a greater inner\r\nforce to a greater outer force; yet we have no evidence that a coat of\r\narmour like that of the tortoise can be so produced. Nor, indeed, are the\r\nconditions under which alone its production in such a manner could be\r\naccounted for, fulfilled; since the surface of the tortoise is not exposed\r\nto greater pressure and friction than the surfaces of other creatures. This\r\nmassive carapace, and the strangely-adapted osseous frame-work which\r\nsupports it, are inexplicable as results of evolution, unless through the\r\nprocess of natural selection. So, too, is it with the formation of\r\nodoriferous glands in some mammals, or the growth of such excrescences as\r\nthose of the camel. Thus, in short, is it with all those organs of animals\r\nwhich do not play active parts.\r\n\r\nBesides giving us explanations of structural characters that are otherwise\r\nunaccountable, Mr. Darwin shows how natural selection explains peculiar\r\nrelations between individuals in certain species. Such facts as the\r\ndimorphism of the primrose and other flowers, he proves to be in harmony\r\nwith his hypothesis, though stumbling-blocks to all other hypotheses. The\r\nvarious differences which accompany difference of sex, sometimes slight,\r\nsometimes very great, are similarly accounted for. As before suggested\r\n(§ 79), natural selection appears capable of producing and maintaining the\r\nright proportion of the sexes in each species; and it requires but to\r\ncontemplate the bearings of the argument, to see that the formation of\r\ndifferent sexes may itself have been determined in the same way.\r\n\r\nTo convey here an adequate idea of Mr. Darwin's doctrine, throughout the\r\nimmense range of its applications, is of course impossible. The few\r\nillustrations just given, are intended simply to remind the reader what Mr.\r\nDarwin's hypothesis is, and what are the else insoluble problems which it\r\nsolves for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 166. But now, though it seems to me that we are thus supplied with a key\r\nto phenomena which are multitudinous and varied beyond all conception; it\r\nalso seems to me that there is a moiety of the phenomena which this key\r\nwill not unlock. Mr. Darwin himself recognizes use and disuse of parts, as\r\ncauses of modifications in organisms; and does this, indeed, to a greater\r\nextent than do some who accept his general conclusion. But I conceive that\r\nhe does not recognize them to a sufficient extent. While he shows that the\r\ninheritance of changes of structure caused by changes of function, is\r\nutterly insufficient to explain a great mass--probably the greater mass--of\r\nmorphological phenomena; I think he leaves unconsidered a mass of\r\nmorphological phenomena which are explicable as results of\r\nfunctionally-produced modifications, and are not explicable as results of\r\nnatural selection.\r\n\r\nBy induction, as well as by inference from the hypothesis of natural\r\nselection, we know that there exists a balance among the powers of organs\r\nwhich habitually act together--such proportions among them that no one has\r\nany considerable excess of efficiency. We see, for example, that throughout\r\nthe vascular system there is maintained an equilibrium of the component\r\nparts: in some cases, under continued excess of exertion, the heart gives\r\nway, and we have enlargement; in other cases the large arteries give way,\r\nand we have aneurisms; in other cases the minute blood-vessels give\r\nway--now bursting, now becoming chronically congested. That is to say, in\r\nthe average constitution, no superfluous strength is possessed by any of\r\nthe appliances for circulating the blood. Take, again, a set of motor\r\norgans. Great strain here causes the fibres of a muscle to tear. There the\r\nmuscle does not yield but the tendon snaps. Elsewhere neither muscle nor\r\ntendon is damaged, but the bone breaks. Joining with these instances the\r\ngeneral fact that, under the same adverse conditions, different individuals\r\nshow their slight differences of constitution by going wrong some in one\r\nway and some in another; and that even in the same individual, similar\r\nadverse conditions will now affect one viscus and now another; it becomes\r\nmanifest that though there cannot be maintained an accurate balance among\r\nthe powers of the organs composing an organism, yet their excesses and\r\ndeficiencies of power are extremely slight. That they must be extremely\r\nslight, is, as before said, a deduction from the hypothesis of natural\r\nselection. Mr. Darwin himself argues \"that natural selection is continually\r\ntrying to economise in every part of the organization. If under changed\r\nconditions of life a structure before useful becomes less useful, any\r\ndiminution, however slight, in its development, will be seized on by\r\nnatural selection, for it will profit the individual not to have its\r\nnutriment wasted in building up an useless structure.\" In other words, if\r\nany muscle has more fibres than are required, or if a bone is stronger than\r\nneedful, no advantage results but rather a disadvantage--a disadvantage\r\nwhich will decrease the chances of survival. Hence it follows that among\r\nany organs which habitually act in concert, an increase of one can be of no\r\nservice unless there is a concomitant increase of the rest. The\r\nco-operative parts must vary together; otherwise variation will be\r\ndetrimental. A stronger muscle must have a stronger bone to resist its\r\ncontractions; must have stronger correlated muscles and ligaments to secure\r\nthe neighbouring articulations; must have larger blood-vessels to bring it\r\nsupplies; must have a more massive nerve to transmit stimulus, and some\r\nextra development of a nervous centre to supply the extra stimulus. The\r\nquestion arises, then,--do variations of the appropriate kinds occur\r\nsimultaneously in all these co-operative parts? Have we any reason to think\r\nthat the parts spontaneously increase or decrease together? The assumption\r\nthat they do seems to me untenable; and its untenability will, I think,\r\nbecome conspicuous if we take a case, and observe how extremely numerous\r\nand involved are the variations which must be supposed to occur together.\r\nIn illustration of another point, we have already considered the\r\nmodifications required to accompany increased weight of the head (§ 155).\r\nInstead of the bison, the moose deer, or the extinct Irish elk, will here\r\nbest serve our purpose. In this last species the male has\r\nenormously-developed horns, used for purposes of offence and defence. These\r\nhorns, weighing upwards of a hundred-weight, are carried at great\r\nmechanical disadvantage: supported as they are, along with the massive\r\nskull which bears them, at the extremity of the outstretched neck. Further,\r\nthat these heavy horns may be of use in fighting, the supporting bones and\r\nmuscles must be strong enough, not simply to carry them, but to put them in\r\nmotion with the rapidity needed for giving blows. Let us, then, ask how, by\r\nnatural selection, this complex apparatus of bones and muscles can have\r\nbeen developed, _pari passu_ with the horns? If we suppose the horns to\r\nhave been originally of like size with those borne by other kinds of deer;\r\nand if we suppose that in some individual they became larger by spontaneous\r\nvariation; what would be the concomitant changes required to render their\r\ngreater size useful? Other things equal, the blow given by a larger horn\r\nwould be a blow given by a heavier mass moving at a smaller velocity: the\r\nmomentum would be the same as before; and the area of contact with the body\r\nstruck being somewhat increased, while the velocity was decreased, the\r\ninjury done would be less. That horns may become better weapons, the whole\r\napparatus concerned in moving them must be so strengthened as to impress\r\nmore force on them, and to bear the more violent reactions of the blows\r\ngiven. The bones of the skull on which the horns are seated must be\r\nthickened; otherwise they will break. The vertebræ of the neck must be\r\nfurther developed; and unless the ligaments which hold together these\r\nvertebræ, and the muscles which move them, are also enlarged, nothing will\r\nbe gained. Again the upper dorsal vertebræ and their spines must be\r\nstrengthened, that they may withstand the stronger contractions of the\r\nneck-muscles; and like changes must be made on the scapular arch. Still\r\nmore must there be required a simultaneous development of the bones and\r\nmuscles of the fore-legs; since these extra growths in the horns, in the\r\nskull, in the neck, in the shoulders, add to the burden they have to bear;\r\nand without they are strengthened the creature will not only suffer from\r\nloss of speed but will fail in fight. Hence, to make larger horns of use,\r\nadditional sizes must be acquired by numerous bones, muscles, and\r\nligaments, as well as by the blood-vessels and nerves on which their\r\nactions depend. On calling to mind how the spraining of a single small\r\nmuscle in the foot incapacitates for walking, or how permanent weakness in\r\na knee-ligament will diminish the power of the leg, it will be seen that\r\nunless all these many changes are simultaneously made, they may as well be\r\nnone of them made--or rather, they would better be none of them made; since\r\nthe enlargements of some parts, by putting greater strains on connected\r\nparts, would render them relatively weaker if they remained unenlarged. Can\r\nwe with any propriety assume that these many enlargements duly proportioned\r\nwill be simultaneously effected by spontaneous variations? I think not. It\r\nwould be a strong supposition that the vertebræ and muscles of the neck\r\nsuddenly became bigger at the same time as the horns. It would be a still\r\nstronger supposition that the upper dorsal vertebræ not only at the same\r\ntime became more massive, but appropriately altered their proportions, by\r\nthe development of their immense neural spines. And it would be an\r\nassumption still more straining our powers of belief, that along with\r\nheavier horns there should spontaneously take place the required\r\nstrengthenings in the bones, muscles, arteries, and nerves of the scapular\r\nand the fore-legs.\r\n\r\nBesides the multiplicity of directly-coöperative organs, the multiplicity\r\nof organs which do not coöperate, save in the degree implied by their\r\ncombination in the same organism, seems to me a further hindrance to the\r\ndevelopment of special structures by natural selection alone. Where the\r\nlife is simple, or where circumstances render some one function supremely\r\nimportant, survival of the fittest may readily bring about the appropriate\r\nstructural change, without aid from the transmission of functionally-caused\r\nmodifications. But in proportion as the life grows complex--in proportion\r\nas a healthy existence cannot be secured by a large endowment of some one\r\npower, but demands many powers; in the same proportion do there arise\r\nobstacles to the increase of any particular power by \"the preservation of\r\nfavoured races in the struggle for life.\" As fast as the faculties are\r\nmultiplied, so fast does it become possible for the several members of a\r\nspecies to have various kinds of superiorities over one another. While one\r\nsaves its life by higher speed, another does the like by clearer vision,\r\nanother by keener scent, another by quicker hearing, another by greater\r\nstrength, another by unusual power of enduring cold or hunger, another by\r\nspecial sagacity, another by special timidity, another by special courage;\r\nand others by other bodily and mental attributes. Conditions being alike,\r\neach of these life-saving attributes is likely to be transmitted to\r\nposterity. But we may not assume that it will be increased in subsequent\r\ngenerations by natural selection. Increase of it can result only if\r\nindividuals possessing average endowments of it are more frequently killed\r\noff than individuals highly endowed with it; and this can happen only when\r\nthe attribute is one of greater importance, for the time being, than most\r\nof the other attributes. If those members of the species which have but\r\nordinary shares of it, nevertheless survive by virtue of other\r\nsuperiorities which they severally possess; then it is not easy to see how\r\nthis particular attribute can be developed by natural selection in\r\nsubsequent generations. The probability seems rather to be that, by\r\ngamogenesis, this extra endowment will, on the average, be diminished in\r\nposterity--just serving in the long run to make up for the deficient\r\nendowments of those whose special powers lie in other directions; and so to\r\nkeep up the normal structure of the species. As fast as the number of\r\nbodily and mental faculties increases, and as fast as maintenance of life\r\ncomes to depend less on the amount of any one and more on the combined\r\nactions of all; so fast does the production of specialities of character by\r\nnatural selection alone, become difficult. Particularly does this seem to\r\nbe so with a species so multitudinous in its powers as mankind; and above\r\nall does it seem to be so with such of the human powers as have but minor\r\nshares in aiding the struggle for life--the æsthetic faculties, for\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nIt by no means follows, however, that in cases of this kind, and cases of\r\nthe preceding kind, natural selection plays no part. Wherever it is not the\r\nchief agent in working organic changes, it is still, very generally, a\r\nsecondary agent. The survival of the fittest must nearly always further the\r\nproduction of modifications which produce fitness, whether they be\r\nincidental modifications, or modifications caused by direct adaptation.\r\nEvidently, those individuals whose constitutions have facilitated the\r\nproduction in them of any structural change consequent on any functional\r\nchange demanded by some new external condition, will be the individuals\r\nmost likely to live and to leave descendants. There must be a natural\r\nselection of functionally-acquired peculiarities, as well as of\r\nspontaneously-acquired peculiarities; and hence such structural changes in\r\na species as result from changes of habit necessitated by changed\r\ncircumstances, natural selection will render more rapid than they would\r\notherwise be.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some modifications in the sizes and forms of parts,\r\nwhich cannot have been aided by natural selection; but which must have\r\nresulted wholly from the inheritance of functionally-caused alterations.\r\nThe dwindling of organs of which the undue sizes entail no appreciable\r\nevils, furnishes the best evidence of this. Take, for an example, that\r\ndiminution of the jaws and teeth which characterizes the civilized races,\r\nas contrasted with the savage races.[53] How can the civilized races have\r\nbeen benefited in the struggle for life, by the slight decrease in these\r\ncomparatively-small bones? No functional superiority possessed by a small\r\njaw over a large jaw in civilized life, can be named as having caused the\r\nmore frequent survival of small-jawed individuals. The only advantage\r\naccompanying smallness of jaw, is the advantage of economized nutrition;\r\nand this cannot be great enough to further the preservation of those\r\ndistinguished by it. The decrease of weight in the jaw and co-operative\r\nparts, which has arisen in the course of thousands of years, does not\r\namount to more than a few ounces. This decrease has to be divided among the\r\nmany generations which have lived and died in the interval. Let us admit\r\nthat the weight of these parts diminished to the extent of an ounce in a\r\nsingle generation (which is a large admission); it still cannot be\r\ncontended that the having to carry an ounce less in weight, and to keep in\r\nrepair an ounce less of tissue, could sensibly affect any man's fate. And\r\nif it never did this--nay, if it did not cause a _frequent_ survival of\r\nsmall-jawed individuals where large-jawed individuals died; natural\r\nselection could neither cause nor aid diminution of the jaw and its\r\nappendages. Here, therefore, the decreased action which has accompanied the\r\ngrowth of civilized habits (the use of tools and the disuse of coarse\r\nfood), must have been the sole cause at work. Through direct equilibration,\r\ndiminished external stress on these parts has resulted in diminution of the\r\ninternal forces by which this stress is met. From generation to generation,\r\nthis lessening of the parts consequent on functional decline has been\r\ninherited. And since the survival of individuals must always have been\r\ndetermined by more important structural traits, this trait can have neither\r\nbeen facilitated nor retarded by natural selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 167. Returning from these extensive classes of facts for which Mr.\r\nDarwin's hypothesis does not account, to the still more extensive classes\r\nof facts for which it does account, and which are unaccountable on any\r\nother hypothesis; let us consider in what way this hypothesis is\r\nexpressible in terms of the general doctrine of evolution. Already it has\r\nbeen pointed out that the evolving of modified types by \"natural selection\r\nor the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life,\" must be a\r\nprocess of equilibration; since it results in the production of organisms\r\nwhich are in equilibrium with their environments. At the outset of this\r\nchapter, something was done towards showing how this continual survival of\r\nthe fittest may be understood as the progressive establishment of a balance\r\nbetween inner and outer forces. Here, however, we must consider the matter\r\nmore closely.\r\n\r\nOn previous occasions we have contemplated the assemblage of individuals\r\ncomposing a species, as an aggregate in a state of moving equilibrium. We\r\nhave seen that its powers of multiplication give it an expansive energy\r\nwhich is antagonized by other energies; and that through the rhythmical\r\nvariations in these two sets of energies there is maintained an oscillating\r\nlimit to its habitat, and an oscillating limit to its numbers. On another\r\noccasion (§ 96) it was shown that the aggregate of individuals constituting\r\na species, has a kind of general life which, \"like the life of an\r\nindividual, is maintained by the unequal and ever-varying actions of\r\nincident forces on its different parts.\" We saw that \"just as, in each\r\norganism, incident forces constantly produce divergences from the mean\r\nstate in various directions, which are constantly balanced by opposite\r\ndivergences indirectly produced by other incident forces; and just as the\r\ncombination of rhythmical functions thus maintained, constitutes the life\r\nof the organism; so, in a species there is, through gamogenesis, a\r\nperpetual neutralization of those contrary deviations from the mean state,\r\nwhich are caused in its different parts by different sets of incident\r\nforces; and it is similarly by the rhythmical production and compensation\r\nof these contrary deviations that the species continues to live.\" Hence, to\r\nunderstand how a species is affected by causes which destroy some of its\r\nunits and favour the multiplication of others, we must consider it as a\r\nwhole whose parts are held together by complex forces that are ever\r\nre-balancing themselves--a whole whose moving equilibrium is continually\r\ndisturbed and continually rectified. Thus much premised, let us next call\r\nto mind how moving equilibria in general are changed. In the first place, a\r\nnew incident force falling on any part of an aggregate with balanced\r\nmotions, produces a new motion in the direction of least resistance. In the\r\nsecond place, the new incident force is gradually used up in overcoming the\r\nopposing forces, and when it is all expended the opposing forces produce a\r\nrecoil--a reverse deviation which counter-balances the original deviation.\r\nConsequently, to consider whether the moving equilibrium of a species is\r\nmodified in the same way as moving equilibria in general, is to consider\r\nwhether, when exposed to a new force, a species yields in the direction of\r\nleast resistance; and whether, by its thus yielding, there is generated in\r\nthe species a compensating change in the opposite direction. We shall find\r\nthat it does both these things.\r\n\r\nFor what, expressed in mechanical terms, is the effect wrought on a species\r\nby some previously-unknown enemy, that kills such of its members as fail in\r\ndefending themselves? The disappearance of those individuals which meet the\r\ndestroying forces by the smallest preserving forces, is tantamount to the\r\nyielding of the species as a whole at the places where the resistances are\r\nthe least. Or if by some general influence, such as alteration of climate,\r\nthe members of a species are subject to increase of external actions which\r\nare ever tending to overthrow their equilibria, and which they are ever\r\ncounter-balancing by certain physiological actions, which are the first to\r\ndie? Those least able to generate the internal energies which antagonize\r\nthese external energies. If the change be an increase of the winter's cold,\r\nthen such members of the species as have unusual powers of getting food or\r\nof digesting food, or such as are by their constitutional aptitude for\r\nmaking fat, furnished with reserve stores of force, available in times of\r\nscarcity, or such as have the thickest coats and so lose least heat by\r\nradiation, survive; and their survival implies that in each of them the\r\nmoving equilibrium of functions presents such an adjustment of internal\r\nforces, as prevents overthrow by the modified aggregate of external forces.\r\nConversely, the members which die are, other things equal, those deficient\r\nin the power of meeting the new action by an equivalent counter-action.\r\nThus, in all cases, a species considered as an aggregate in a state of\r\nmoving equilibrium, has its state changed by the yielding of its\r\nfluctuating mass wherever this mass is weakest in relation to the special\r\nforces acting on it. The conclusion is, indeed, a truism. But now what must\r\nfollow from the destruction of the least-resisting individuals and survival\r\nof the most-resisting individuals? On the moving equilibrium of the species\r\nas a whole, existing from generation to generation, the effect of this\r\ndeviation from the mean state is to produce a compensating deviation. For\r\nif all such as are deficient of power in a certain direction are destroyed,\r\nwhat must be the effect on posterity? Had they lived and left offspring,\r\nthe next generation would have had the same average powers as preceding\r\ngenerations: there would have been a like proportion of individuals less\r\nendowed with the needful power, and individuals more endowed with it. But\r\nthe more-endowed individuals being alone left to continue the race, there\r\nmust result a new generation characterized by a larger average endowment of\r\nthis power. That is to say, on the moving equilibrium of a species, an\r\naction producing change in a given direction is followed, in the next\r\ngeneration, by a reaction producing an opposite change. Observe, too, that\r\nthese effects correspond in their degrees of violence.  If the alteration\r\nof some external factor is so great that it leaves alive only the few\r\nindividuals possessing extreme endowments of the power required to\r\nantagonize it; then, in succeeding generations, there is a rapid\r\nmultiplication of individuals similarly possessing extreme endowments of\r\nthis power--the force impressed calls out an equivalent conflicting force.\r\nMoreover, the change is temporary where the cause is temporary, and\r\npermanent where the cause is permanent. All that are deficient in the\r\nneedful attribute having been killed off, and the survivors having the\r\nneedful attribute in a comparatively high degree, there will descend from\r\nthem, not only some possessing equal amounts of this attribute with\r\nthemselves, but also some possessing less amounts of it. If the destructive\r\nagency has not continued in action, such less-endowed individuals will\r\nmultiply; and the species, after sundry oscillations, will return to its\r\nprevious mean state. But if this agency be a persistent one, such less\r\nendowed individuals will be continually killed off, and eventually none but\r\nhighly-endowed individuals will be produced--a new moving equilibrium,\r\nadapted to the new environing conditions, will result.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that this mode of expressing the facts does not include\r\nthe cases in which a species becomes modified in relation to surrounding\r\nagencies of a passive kind--cases like that of a plant which acquires\r\nhooked seed-vessels, by which it lays hold of the skins of passing animals,\r\nand makes them the distributors of its seeds--cases in which the outer\r\nagency has no direct tendency at first to affect the species, but in which\r\nthe species so alters itself as to take advantage of the outer agency. To\r\ncases of this kind, however, the same mode of interpretation applies on\r\nsimply changing the terms. While, in the aggregate of influences amid which\r\na species exists, there are some which tend to overthrow the moving\r\nequilibria of its members, there are others which facilitate the\r\nmaintenance of their moving equilibria, and some which are capable of\r\ngiving their moving equilibria increased stability: instance the spread\r\ninto their habitat of some new kind of prey, which is abundant at seasons\r\nwhen other prey is scarce. Now what is the process by which the moving\r\nequilibrium in any species becomes adapted to some additional external\r\nfactor furthering its maintenance? Instead of an increased resistance to be\r\nmet and counterbalanced, there is here a diminished resistance; and the\r\ndiminished resistance is equilibrated in the same way as the increased\r\nresistance. As, in the one case, there is a more frequent survival of\r\nindividuals whose peculiarities enable them to resist the new adverse\r\nfactor; so, in the other case, there is a more frequent survival of\r\nindividuals whose peculiarities enable them to take advantage of the new\r\nfavourable factor. In each member of the species, the balance of functions\r\nand correlated arrangement of structures, differ slightly from those\r\nexisting in other members. To say that among all its members, one is better\r\nfitted than the rest to benefit by some before-unused agency in the\r\nenvironment, is to say that its moving equilibrium is, in so far, more\r\nstably adjusted to the sum of surrounding influences. And if, consequently,\r\nthis individual maintains its moving equilibrium when others fail, and has\r\noffspring which do the like--that is, if individuals thus characterized\r\nmultiply and supplant the rest; there is, as before, a process which\r\neffects equilibration between the organism and its environment, not\r\nimmediately but mediately, through the continuous intercourse between the\r\nspecies as a whole and the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 168. Thus we see that indirect equilibration does whatever direct\r\nequilibration cannot do. All these processes by which organisms are\r\nre-fitted to their ever-changing environments, must be equilibrations of\r\none kind or other. As authority for this conclusion, we have not simply the\r\nuniversal truth that change of every order is towards equilibrium; but we\r\nhave also the truth that life itself is a moving equilibrium between inner\r\nand outer actions--a continuous adjustment of internal relations to\r\nexternal relations; or the maintenance of a balance between the forces to\r\nwhich an organism is subject and the forces which it evolves. Hence all\r\nchanges which enable a species to live under altered conditions, are\r\nchanges towards equilibrium with the altered conditions; and therefore\r\nthose which do not come within the class of direct equilibrations, must\r\ncome within the class of indirect equilibrations.\r\n\r\nAnd now we reach an interpretation of Natural Selection regarded as a part\r\nof Evolution at large. As understood in _First Principles_, Evolution is a\r\ncontinuous redistribution of matter and motion; and a process of evolution\r\nwhich is not expressible in terms of matter and motion has not been reduced\r\nto its ultimate form. The conception of Natural Selection is manifestly one\r\nnot known to physical science: its terms are not of a kind physical science\r\ncan take cognisance of. But here we have found in what manner it may be\r\nbrought within the realm of physical science. Rejecting metaphor we see\r\nthat the process called Natural Selection is literally a survival of the\r\nfittest; and the outcome of the above argument is that survival of the\r\nfittest is a maintenance of the moving equilibrium of the functions in\r\npresence of outer actions: implying the possession of an equilibrium which\r\nis relatively stable in contrast with the unstable equilibria of those\r\nwhich do not survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CO-OPERATION OF THE FACTORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 169. Thus the phenomena of Organic Evolution may be interpreted in the\r\nsame way as the phenomena of all other Evolution. Fully to see this, it\r\nwill be needful for us to contemplate in their _ensemble_, the several\r\nprocesses separately described in the four preceding chapters.\r\n\r\nIf the forces acting on any aggregate remain the same, the changes produced\r\nby them will presently reach a limit, at which the outer forces are\r\nbalanced by the inner forces; and thereafter no further metamorphosis will\r\ntake place. Hence, that there may be continuous changes of structure in\r\norganisms, there must be continuous changes in the incident forces. This\r\ncondition to the evolution of animal and vegetal forms, we find to be fully\r\nsatisfied. The astronomic, geologic, and meteorologic changes that have\r\nbeen slowly but incessantly going on, and have been increasing in the\r\ncomplexity of their combinations, have been perpetually altering the\r\ncircumstances of organisms; and organisms, becoming more numerous in their\r\nkinds and higher in their kinds, have been perpetually altering one\r\nanother's circumstances. Thus, for those progressive modifications upon\r\nmodifications which organic evolution implies, we find a sufficient cause.\r\nThe increasing inner changes for which we thus find a cause in the\r\nperpetual outer changes, conform, so far as we can trace them, to the\r\nuniversal law of the instability of the homogeneous. In organisms, as in\r\nall other things, the exposure of different parts to different kinds and\r\namounts of incident forces, has necessitated their differentiation; and,\r\nfor the like reason, aggregates of individuals have been lapsing into\r\nvarieties, and species, and genera, and orders. Further, in each type of\r\norganism, as in the aggregate of types, the multiplication of effects has\r\ncontinually aided this transition from a more homogeneous to a more\r\nheterogeneous state. And yet again, that increasing segregation and\r\nconcomitant increasing definiteness, associated with the growing\r\nheterogeneity of organisms, has been aided by the continual destruction of\r\nthose which expose themselves to aggregates of external actions markedly\r\nincongruous with the aggregates of their internal actions, and the survival\r\nof those subject only to comparatively small incongruities. Finally, we\r\nhave found that each change of structure, superposed on preceding changes,\r\nhas been a re-equilibration necessitated by the disturbance of a preceding\r\nequilibrium. The maintenance of life being the maintenance of a balanced\r\ncombination of functions, it follows that individuals and species that have\r\ncontinued to live, are individuals and species in which the balance of\r\nfunctions has not been overthrown. Hence survival through successive\r\nchanges of conditions, implies successive adjustments of the balance to the\r\nnew conditions.\r\n\r\nThe actions that are here specified in succession, are in reality\r\nsimultaneous; and they must be so conceived before organic evolution can be\r\nrightly understood. Some aid towards so conceiving them will be given by\r\nthe annexed table, representing the co-operation of the factors.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 170.

and these changes have continued to be causes.\r\nBut as, through the diffusion of organisms and consequent differential\r\nactions of inorganic forces, there arose unlikenesses among them, producing\r\nvarieties, species, genera, orders, classes, the actions of organisms on\r\none another became new sources of organic modifications. And as fast as\r\ntypes have multiplied and become more complex, so fast have the mutual\r\nactions of organisms come to be more influential factors in their\r\nrespective evolutions: eventually becoming the chief factors.\r\n\r\nPassing from the external causes of change to the internal processes of\r\nchange entailed by them, we see that these, too, have varied in their\r\nproportions: that which was originally the most important and almost the\r\nsole process, becoming gradually less important, if not at last the least\r\nimportant. Always there must have been, and always there must continue to\r\nbe, a survival of the fittest; natural selection must have been in\r\noperation at the outset, and can never cease to operate. While yet\r\norganisms had small abilities to coordinate their actions, and adjust them\r\nto environing actions, natural selection worked almost alone in moulding\r\nand remoulding organisms into fitness for their changing environments; and\r\nnatural selection has remained almost the sole agency by which plants and\r\ninferior orders of animals have been modified and developed. The\r\nequilibration of organisms that are almost passive, is necessarily effected\r\nindirectly, by the action of incident forces on the species as a whole. But\r\nalong with the evolution of organisms having some activity, there grows up\r\na kind of equilibration which is in part direct. In proportion as the\r\nactivity increases direct equilibration plays a more important part. Until,\r\nwhen the nervo-muscular apparatus becomes greatly developed, and the power\r\nof varying the actions to fit the varying requirements becomes\r\nconsiderable, the share taken by direct equilibration rises into\r\nco-ordinate importance or greater importance. As fast as essential\r\nfaculties multiply, and as fast as the number of organs which co-operate in\r\nany given function increases, indirect equilibration through natural\r\nselection becomes less and less capable of producing specific adaptations;\r\nand remains capable only of maintaining the general fitness of constitution\r\nto conditions. The production of adaptations by direct equilibration then\r\ntakes the first place: indirect equilibration serving to facilitate it.\r\nUntil at length, among the civilized human races, the equilibration becomes\r\nmainly direct: the action of natural selection being limited to the\r\ndestruction of those who are constitutionally too feeble to live, even with\r\nexternal aid. As the preservation of incapables is secured by our social\r\narrangements; and as very few save incarcerated criminals are prevented by\r\ntheir inferiorities from leaving the average number of offspring; it\r\nresults that survival of the fittest can scarcely at all act in such way as\r\nto produce specialities of nature, either bodily or mental. Here the\r\nspecialities of nature, chiefly mental, which we see produced, and which\r\nare so rapidly produced that a few centuries show a considerable change,\r\nmust be ascribed almost wholly to direct equilibration.[54]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE CONVERGENCE OF THE EVIDENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 171. Of the three classes of evidences that have been assigned in proof\r\nof Evolution, the _à priori_, which we took first, were partly negative,\r\npartly positive.\r\n\r\nOn considering the \"General Aspects of the Special-creation hypothesis,\" we\r\ndiscovered it to be worthless. Discredited by its origin, and wholly\r\nwithout any basis of observed fact, we found that it was not even a\r\nthinkable hypothesis; and, while thus intellectually illusive, it turned\r\nout to have moral implications irreconcilable with the professed beliefs of\r\nthose who hold it.\r\n\r\nContrariwise, the \"General Aspects of the Evolution-hypothesis\" begot the\r\nstronger faith in it the more nearly they were considered. By its lineage\r\nand its kindred, it was found to be as closely allied with the proved\r\ntruths of modern science, as is the antagonist hypothesis with the proved\r\nerrors of ancient ignorance. We saw that instead of being a mere\r\npseud-idea, it admits of elaboration into a definite conception: so showing\r\nits legitimacy as an hypothesis. Instead of positing a purely fictitious\r\nprocess, the process which it alleges proves to be one actually going on\r\naround us. To which add that, morally considered, this hypothesis presents\r\nno radical incongruities.\r\n\r\nThus, even were we without further means of judging, there could be no\r\nrational hesitation which of the two views should be entertained.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 172. Further means of judging, however, we found to be afforded by\r\nbringing the two hypotheses face to face with the general truths\r\nestablished by naturalists. These inductive evidences were dealt with in\r\nfour chapters.\r\n\r\n\"The Arguments from Classification\" were these. Organisms fall into groups\r\nwithin groups; and this is the arrangement which we see results from\r\nevolution, where it is known to take place. Of these groups within groups,\r\nthe great or primary ones are the most unlike, the sub-groups are less\r\nunlike, the sub-sub-groups still less unlike, and so on; and this, too, is\r\na characteristic of groups demonstrably produced by evolution. Moreover,\r\nindefiniteness of equivalence among the groups is common to those which we\r\nknow have been evolved, and those here supposed to have been evolved. And\r\nthen there is the further significant fact, that divergent groups are\r\nallied through their lowest rather than their highest members.\r\n\r\nOf \"the Arguments from Embryology,\" the first is that when developing\r\nembryos are traced from their common starting point, and their divergences\r\nand re-divergences symbolized by a genealogical tree, there is manifest a\r\ngeneral parallelism between the arrangement of its primary, secondary, and\r\ntertiary branches, and the arrangement of the divisions and sub-divisions\r\nof our classifications. Nor do the minor deviations from this general\r\nparallelism, which look like difficulties, fail, on closer observation, to\r\nfurnish additional evidence; since those traits of a common ancestry which\r\nembryology reveals, are, if modifications have resulted from changed\r\nconditions, liable to be disguised in different ways and degrees in\r\ndifferent lines of descendants.\r\n\r\nWe next considered \"the Arguments from Morphology.\" Apart from those\r\nkinships among organisms disclosed by their developmental changes, the\r\nkinships which their adult forms show are profoundly significant. The\r\nunities of type found under such different externals, are inexplicable\r\nexcept as results of community of descent with non-community of\r\nmodification. Again, each organism analyzed apart, shows, in the likenesses\r\nobscured by unlikenesses of its component parts, a peculiarity which can be\r\nascribed only to the formation of a more heterogeneous organism out of a\r\nmore homogeneous one. And once more, the existence of rudimentary organs,\r\nhomologous with organs that are developed in allied animals or plants,\r\nwhile it admits of no other rational interpretation, is satisfactorily\r\ninterpreted by the hypothesis of evolution.\r\n\r\nLast of the inductive evidences, came \"the Arguments from Distribution.\"\r\nWhile the facts of distribution in Space are unaccountable as results of\r\ndesigned adaptation of organisms to their habitats, they are accountable as\r\nresults of the competition of species, and the spread of the more fit into\r\nthe habitats of the less fit, followed by the changes which new conditions\r\ninduce. Though the facts of distribution in Time are so fragmentary that no\r\npositive conclusion can be drawn, yet all of them are reconcilable with the\r\nhypothesis of evolution, and some of them yield it strong support:\r\nespecially the near relationship existing between the living and extinct\r\ntypes in each great geographical area.\r\n\r\nThus of these four groups, each furnished several arguments which point to\r\nthe same conclusion; and the conclusion pointed to by the arguments of any\r\none group, is that pointed to by the arguments of every other group. This\r\ncoincidence of coincidences would give to the induction a very high degree\r\nof probability, even were it not enforced by deduction. But the conclusion\r\ndeductively reached, is in harmony with the inductive conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 173. Passing from the evidence that evolution has taken place, to the\r\nquestion--How has it taken place? we find in known agencies and known\r\nprocesses, adequate causes of its phenomena.\r\n\r\nIn astronomic, geologic, and meteorologic changes, ever in progress, ever\r\ncombining in new and more involved ways, we have a set of inorganic factors\r\nto which all organisms are exposed; and in the varying and complicating\r\nactions of organisms on one another, we have a set of organic factors that\r\nalter with increasing rapidity. Thus, speaking generally, all members of\r\nthe Earth's Flora and Fauna experience perpetual re-arrangements of\r\nexternal forces.\r\n\r\nEach organic aggregate, whether considered individually or as a\r\ncontinuously-existing species, is modified afresh by each fresh\r\ndistribution of external forces. To its pre-existing differentiations new\r\ndifferentiations are added; and thus that lapse to a more heterogeneous\r\nstate, which would have a fixed limit were the circumstances fixed, has its\r\nlimit perpetually removed by the perpetual change of the circumstances.\r\n\r\nThese modifications upon modifications which result in evolution\r\nstructurally considered, are the accompaniments of those functional\r\nalterations continually required to re-equilibrate inner with outer\r\nactions. That moving equilibrium of inner actions corresponding with outer\r\nactions, which constitutes the life of an organism, must either be\r\noverthrown by a change in the outer actions, or must undergo perturbations\r\nthat cannot end until there is a re-adjusted balance of functions and\r\ncorrelative adaptation of structures.\r\n\r\nBut where the external changes are either such as are fatal when\r\nexperienced by the individuals, or such as act on the individuals in ways\r\nthat do not affect the equilibrium of their functions; then the\r\nre-adjustment results through the effects produced on the species as a\r\nwhole--there is indirect equilibration. By the preservation in successive\r\ngenerations of those whose moving equilibria are least at variance with the\r\nrequirements, there is produced a changed equilibrium completely in harmony\r\nwith the requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 174. Even were this the whole of the evidence assignable for the belief\r\nthat organisms have been gradually evolved, it would have a warrant higher\r\nthan that of many beliefs which are regarded as established. But the\r\nevidence is far from exhausted.\r\n\r\nAt the outset it was remarked that the phenomena presented by the organic\r\nworld as a whole, cannot be properly dealt with apart from the phenomena\r\npresented by each organism, in the course of its growth, development, and\r\ndecay. The interpretation of either implies interpretation of the other;\r\nsince the two are in reality parts of one process. Hence, the validity of\r\nany hypothesis respecting the one class of phenomena, may be tested by its\r\ncongruity with phenomena of the other class. We are now about to pass to\r\nthe more special phenomena of development, as displayed in the structures\r\nand functions of individual organisms. If the hypothesis that plants and\r\nanimals have been progressively evolved be true, it must furnish us with\r\nkeys to these phenomena. We shall find that it does this; and by doing it\r\ngives numberless additional vouchers for its truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV^A.\r\n\r\nRECENT CRITICISMS AND HYPOTHESES.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 174a. Since the first edition of this work was published, and more\r\nespecially since the death of Mr. Darwin, an active discussion of the\r\nEvolution hypothesis has led to some significant results.\r\n\r\nThat organic evolution has been going on from the dawn of life down to the\r\npresent time, is now a belief almost universally accepted by zoologists and\r\nbotanists--\"almost universally,\" I say, because the surviving influence of\r\nCuvier prevents acceptance of it by some of them in France. Omitting the\r\nideas of these, all biological interpretations, speculations, and\r\ninvestigations, tacitly assume that organisms of every kind in every era\r\nand in every region have come into existence by the process of descent with\r\nmodification.\r\n\r\nBut while concerning the fact of evolution there is agreement, concerning\r\nits causes there is disagreement. The ideas of naturalists have, in this\r\nrespect, undergone a differentiation increasingly pronounced; which has\r\nended in the production of two diametrically opposed beliefs. The cause\r\nwhich Mr. Darwin first made conspicuous has come to be regarded by some as\r\nthe sole cause; while, on the part of others there has been a growing\r\nrecognition of the cause which he at first disregarded but afterwards\r\nadmitted. Prof. Weismann and his supporters contend that natural selection\r\nsuffices to explain everything. Contrariwise, among many who recognize the\r\ninheritance of functionally-produced changes, there are a few, like the\r\nRev. Prof. Henslow, who regard it as the sole factor.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing chapters imply that the beliefs of neither extreme are here\r\nadopted. Agreeing with Mr. Darwin that both factors have been operative, I\r\nhold that the inheritance of functionally-caused alterations has played a\r\nlarger part than he admitted even at the close of his life; and that,\r\ncoming more to the front as evolution has advanced, it has played the chief\r\npart in producing the highest types. I am not now about to discuss afresh\r\nthese questions, but to deal with certain further questions.\r\n\r\nFor while there has been taking place in the biological world the major\r\ndifferentiation above indicated, there have been taking place certain minor\r\ndifferentiations--there have been arising special views respecting the\r\nprocess of organic evolution. Concerning each of these it is needful to say\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 174b. Among the implied controversies the most conspicuous one has\r\nconcerned the alleged process called by Prof. Weismann _Panmixia_--a\r\nprocess which Dr. Romanes had foreshadowed under the name of \"the Cessation\r\nof Selection.\" Dr. Romanes says:--\"At that time it appeared to me, as it\r\nnow appears to Weismann, entirely to supersede the necessity of supposing\r\nthat the effect of disuse is ever inherited in any degree at all.\"[55] The\r\nalleged mode of action is exemplified by Prof. Weismann as follows:--\r\n\r\n  \"A goose or a duck must possess strong powers of flight in the natural\r\n  state, but such powers are no longer necessary for obtaining food when it\r\n  is brought into the poultry-yard, so that a rigid selection of\r\n  individuals with well-developed wings, at once ceases among its\r\n  descendants. Hence in the course of generations, a deterioration of the\r\n  organs of flight must necessarily ensue, and the other members and organs\r\n  of the bird will be similarly affected.\"[56]\r\n\r\nHere, and throughout the arguments of those who accept the hypothesis of\r\nPanmixia, there is an unwarranted assumption--nay, an assumption at\r\nvariance with the doctrine in support of which it is made. It is contended\r\nthat in such cases as the one given there will, apart from any effects of\r\ndisuse, be decrease in the disused organs because, not being kept by\r\nNatural Selection up to the level of strength previously needed, they will\r\nvary in the direction of decrease; and that variations in the direction of\r\ndecrease, occurring in some individuals, will, by interbreeding, produce an\r\naverage decrease throughout the species. But why will the disused organs\r\nvary in the direction of decrease more than in the direction of increase?\r\nThe hypothesis of Natural Selection postulates indeterminate\r\nvariations--deviations no more in one direction than in the opposite\r\ndirection: implying that increases and decreases of size will occur to\r\nequal extents and with equal frequencies. With any other assumption the\r\nhypothesis lapses; for if the variations in one direction exceed those in\r\nanother the question arises--What makes them do this? And whatever makes\r\nthem do this becomes the essential cause of the modification: the selection\r\nof favourable variations is tacitly admitted to be an insufficient\r\nexplanation. But if the hypothesis of Natural Selection itself implies the\r\noccurrence of equal variations on all sides of the mean, how can Panmixia\r\nproduce decrease? _Plus_ deviations will cancel _minus_ deviations, and the\r\norgan will remain where it was.[57]\r\n\r\n\"But you have forgotten the tendency to economy of growth,\" will be the\r\nreply--\"you have forgotten that in Mr. Darwin's words 'natural selection is\r\ncontinually trying to economize in every part of the organization;' and\r\nthat this is a constant cause favouring _minus_ variations.\" I have not\r\nforgotten it; but have remembered it as showing how, to support the\r\nhypothesis of Panmixia, there is invoked the aid of that very hypothesis\r\nwhich it is to replace. For this principle of economy is but another aspect\r\nof the principle of functionally-produced modifications. Nearly forty years\r\nago I contended that \"the different parts of ... an individual organism\r\ncompete for nutriment; and severally obtain more or less of it according as\r\nthey are discharging more or less duty:\"[58] the implication being that as\r\nall other organs are demanding blood, decrease of duty in any one,\r\nentailing decreased supply of blood, brings about decreased size. In other\r\nwords, the alleged economy is nothing else than the abstraction, by active\r\nparts, of nutriment from an inactive part; and is merely another name for\r\nfunctionally-produced decrease. So that if the variations are supposed to\r\ntake place predominantly in the direction of decrease, it can only be by\r\nsilently assuming the cause which is overtly denied.\r\n\r\nBut now we come to the strange fact that the particular case in which\r\npanmixia is assigned in disproof of alleged inheritance of\r\nfunctionally-produced modifications, is a case in which it would be\r\ninapplicable even were its assumption legitimate--the case of disused\r\norgans in domestic animals. For since nutrition is here abundant, the\r\nprinciple of economy under the form alleged does not come into play.\r\nContrariwise, there even occurs a partial re-development of rudimentary\r\norgans: instances named by Mr. Darwin being the supplementary mammæ in\r\ncows, fifth toes on the hind feet of dogs, spurs and comb in hens, and\r\ncanine teeth in mares. Now clearly, if organs disused for innumerable\r\ngenerations may thus vary in the direction of increase, it must, _a\r\nfortiori_, be so with recently disused organs, and there disappears all\r\nplea (even the illegitimate plea) for assuming that in the wing of a wild\r\nduck which has become domesticated, the _minus_ variations will exceed the\r\n_plus_ variations: the hypothesis of panmixia loses its postulate.\r\n\r\nIf it be said that Mr. Darwin's argument is based on the changed ratio\r\nbetween the weights of leg-bones and wing-bones, and that this changed\r\nratio may result not from decrease of the wing-bones but from increase of\r\nthe leg-bones, then there comes a fatal reply. Such, increase cannot be\r\nascribed to selection of varieties, since there is no selective breeding to\r\nobtain larger legs, and as it is not pretended that panmixia accounts for\r\nincrease the case is lost: there remains no cause for such increase save\r\nincrease of function.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 174c. The doctrine of determinate evolution or definitely-directed\r\nevolution, which appears to be in one form or other entertained by sundry\r\nnaturalists, has been set forth by the late Prof. Eimer under the title\r\n\"Orthogenesis.\" A distinct statement of his conception is not easily made\r\nfor the reason that, as I think, the conception itself is indistinct. Here\r\nare some extracts from a translation of his paper published at Chicago. Out\r\nof these the reader may form a notion of the theory:\r\n\r\n  \"Orthogenesis shows that organisms develop in definite directions without\r\n  the least regard for utility through purely physiological causes as the\r\n  result of _organic growth_, as I term the process.\"\r\n\r\n  \"I am concerned in this paper with definitely directed evolution as the\r\n  cause of transmutation, and not with the effects of the use and activity\r\n  of organs which with Lamarck I adopted as the second main explanatory\r\n  cause thereof.\"\r\n\r\n  \"The causes of definitely directed evolution are contained, according to\r\n  my view, in the effects produced by outward circumstances and influences\r\n  such as climate and nutrition upon the constitution of a given organism.\"\r\n\r\n  \"At variance with all the facts of definitely directed evolution ... is\r\n  also the contention of my opponent [Weismann] ... that the variations\r\n  demonstrably oscillate to and fro in the most diverse directions about a\r\n  given zero-point. There is no oscillation in the direction of\r\n  development, but simply an advance forwards in a straight line with\r\n  occasional lateral divergences whereby the forkings of the ancestral tree\r\n  are produced.\"[59]\r\n\r\nThese sentences contain one of those explanations which explain nothing;\r\nfor we are not enabled to see how the \"outward circumstances and\r\ninfluences\" produce the effects ascribed to them. We are not shown in what\r\nway they cause organic evolution in general, still less in what way they\r\ncause the infinitely-varied forms in which organic evolution results. The\r\nassertion that evolution takes definitely-directed lines is accompanied by\r\nno indication of the reasons why particular lines are followed rather than\r\nothers. In short, we are simply taken a step back, and for further\r\ninterpretation referred to a cause said to be adequate, but the operations\r\nof which we are to imagine as best we may.\r\n\r\nThis is a re-introduction of supernaturalism under a disguise. It may pair\r\noff with the conception made popular by the _Vestiges of the Natural\r\nHistory of Creation_, in which it was contended that there exists a\r\npersistent tendency towards the birth of a higher form of creature; or it\r\nmay be bracketed with the idea entertained by the late Prof. Owen, who\r\nalleged an \"ordained becoming\" of living things.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 174d. An objection to the Darwinian doctrine which has risen into\r\nprominence, is that Natural Selection does not explain that which it\r\nprofesses to explain. In the words of Mr. J. T. Cunningham:--\r\n\r\n  \"Everybody knows that the theory of natural selection was put forward by\r\n  Darwin as a theory of the origin of species, and yet it is only a theory\r\n  of the origin of adaptations. The question is: Are the differences\r\n  between species differences of adaptation? If so, then the origin of\r\n  species and the origin of adaptations are equivalent terms. But there is\r\n  scarcely a single instance in which a specific character has been shown\r\n  to be useful, to be adaptive.\"[60]\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this last statement Mr. Cunningham names the plaice,\r\nflounder, and dab as three flat fishes in which, along with the adaptive\r\ncharacters related to the mode of life common to them all, each has\r\nspecific characters which are not adaptive. No evidence is forthcoming that\r\nthese in any way conduce to the welfare of the species. Two propositions\r\nare here involved which should be separately dealt with.\r\n\r\nThe first is that the adaptive modifications which survival of the fittest\r\nis able to produce, do not become specific traits: they are traits separate\r\nin kind from those which mark off groups proved to be specifically distinct\r\nby their inability to breed together. Such evidence as we at present have\r\nseems to warrant this statement. Out of the many varieties of dogs most, if\r\nnot all, have been rendered distinct by adaptive modifications, mostly\r\nproduced by selection. But, notwithstanding the immense divergences of\r\nstructure so produced, the varieties inter-breed. To this, however, it may\r\nbe replied that sufficient time has not elapsed--that the process by which\r\na structural adaptation so reacts on the constitution as to make it a\r\ndistinct one, possibly, or probably, takes many thousands of years. Let us\r\naccept for the moment Lord Kelvin's low estimate of the geologic time\r\nduring which life has existed--one hundred million years. Suppose we divide\r\nthat time into as many parts as there are hours occupied in the development\r\nof a human foetus. And suppose that during these hundred million years\r\nthere has been going on with some uniformity the evolution of the various\r\norganic types now existing. Then the amount of change undergone by the\r\nfoetus in an hour, will be equivalent to the amount of change undergone by\r\nan evolving organic form in fifteen thousand years. That is to say, during\r\ngeneral evolution it may have taken fifteen thousand years to establish, as\r\ndistinct, two species differing from one another no more than the foetus\r\ndiffers from itself after the lapse of an hour. Hence, though we lack proof\r\nthat adaptive modifications become specific traits, it is quite possible\r\nthat they are in course of becoming specific traits.\r\n\r\nThe converse proposition, that the traits by which species are ordinarily\r\ndistinguished are non-adaptive traits is well sustained; and the statement\r\nthat, if not themselves useful they are correlated with those which are\r\nuseful, is, to say the least, unproved. For the instances given by Mr.\r\nDarwin of correlated traits are not those between adaptive traits and the\r\ntraits regarded as specific, but between traits none of which are specific;\r\nas between skull and limbs in swine, tusks and bristles in swine, horns and\r\nwool in sheep, beak and feet in pigeons.\r\n\r\nIf we seek a clue in those processes by which correlations are brought\r\nabout--the physiological actions and reactions--we may at once see that any\r\norganic modification, be it adaptive or not, must entail secondary\r\nmodifications throughout the rest of the organism, most of them insensible\r\nbut some of them sensible. The competition for blood among organs, referred\r\nto above, necessitates that, other things remaining the same, the extra\r\ngrowth of any one tells on all others, in variable degrees according to\r\nconditions, and may cause appreciable diminutions of some. This is not all.\r\nWhile the quantity of blood supplied to other organs is affected, its\r\nquality also is in some cases affected. Each organ, or at any rate each\r\nclass of organs, has special nutrition--abstracts from the blood a\r\nproportion of ingredients different from that abstracted by other organs or\r\nclasses of organs. Hence may result a deficiency or a surplus of some\r\nelement: instance the change in the blood which must be caused by growth of\r\na stag's antlers. Now if such effects are always produced, and if, further,\r\na change of general nutrition caused by a new food or by a difference of\r\nability to utilize certain components of food, similarly operates (instance\r\nthe above named correlation between horns and wool), then every\r\nmodification must entail throughout the organism multitudinous alterations\r\nof structure. Such alterations will ordinarily be neither in themselves\r\nuseful nor necessarily correlated with those which are useful; since they\r\nmust arise as concomitants of any change, whether adaptive or not. There\r\nwill consequently arise the innumerable minute differences presented by\r\nallied species in addition to the differences called specific.\r\n\r\nOn joining with recognition of this general process a recognition of the\r\ntendency towards localization of deposit, one possible origin of specific\r\nmarks is suggested. When in an organism the circulating fluids contain\r\nuseless matter, normal or abnormal, the excretion of it, once determined\r\ntowards a certain place, continues at that place. Trees furnish examples in\r\nthe casting out of gums and resins. Animal life yields evidence in gouty\r\nconcretions and such morbid products as tubercle. A place of enfeebled\r\nnutrition is commonly chosen--not unfrequently a place where a local injury\r\nhas occurred. Now if we extend this principle, well recognized in\r\npathological processes, to physiological processes, we may infer that where\r\nan adaptive modification has so reacted on the blood as to leave some\r\nmatter to be got rid of, the deposit of this, initiated at some place of\r\nleast resistance, may produce a local structure which eventually becomes a\r\nspecies-mark. A relevant inquiry suggests itself--What proportion of\r\nspecies-marks are formed out of inanimate tissue or tissue of low\r\nvitality--tissue which, like hair, feathers, horns, teeth, is composed of\r\nby-products unfit for carrying on vital actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 174e. In the days when, not having been better instructed by Mr. Darwin,\r\nI believed that all changes of structure in organisms result from changes\r\nof function, I held that the cause of such changes of function is\r\nmigration. Assuming as the antecedent of migration a great geologic change,\r\nsuch as upheaval of the East Indian Archipelago step by step into a\r\ncontinent, it was argued, in an essay I then wrote, that, subjected\r\nprimarily to new influences in its original habitat, each kind of plant and\r\nanimal would secondarily be subjected to the altered conditions consequent\r\non spreading over the upheaved regions.\r\n\r\n  \"Each species being distributed over an area of some extent, and tending\r\n  continually to colonize the new area exposed, its different members would\r\n  be subject to different sets of changes. Plants and animals spreading\r\n  towards the equator would not be affected in the same way with others\r\n  spreading from it. Those spreading towards the new shores would undergo\r\n  changes unlike the changes undergone by those spreading into the\r\n  mountains. Thus, each original race of organisms would become the root\r\n  from which diverged several races differing more or less from it and from\r\n  one another.\"\r\n\r\nIt was further argued that, beyond modifications caused by change of\r\nphysical conditions and food, others would be caused by contact of the\r\nFlora and Fauna of each island with the Floras and Faunas of other islands:\r\nbringing experience of animals and plants before unknown.[61]\r\n\r\nWhile this conception was wrong in so far as it ascribed the production of\r\nnew species entirely to inheritance of functionally-wrought alterations\r\n(thus failing to recognize Natural Selection, which was not yet\r\nenunciated), it was right in so far as it ascribed organic changes to\r\nchanges of conditions. And it was, I think, also right in so far as it\r\nimplied that isolation is a condition precedent to such changes. Apparently\r\nit did not occur to me as needful to specify this isolation as making\r\npossible the differentiation of species; since it goes without saying that\r\nmembers of a species spreading east, west, north, south, and forming groups\r\nhundreds of miles apart, must, while breeding with those of the same group\r\nbe prevented from breeding with those of other groups--prevented from\r\nhaving their locally-caused modifications mutually cancelled.\r\n\r\nThe importance of isolation has of late been emphasized by Dr. Romanes and\r\nothers, who, to that isolation consequent on geographical diffusion, have\r\nadded that isolation which results from difference of station in the same\r\nhabitat, and also that due to differences in the breeding periods arising\r\nin members of the same species. Doubtless in whatever way effected, the\r\nisolation of a group subject to new conditions and in course of being\r\nchanged, is requisite as a means to permanent differentiation. Doubtless\r\nalso, as contended by Mr. Gulick and Dr. Romanes, there is a difference\r\nbetween the case in which an entire species being subject to the same\r\nconditions is throughout modified in character, thus illustrating what Mr.\r\nGulick calls \"monotypic evolution,\" and the case in which different parts\r\nof the species, leading different lives, will, if they are by any means\r\nprevented from inter-breeding with other parts, form divergent varieties:\r\nthus illustrating \"polytypic evolution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 174f. Beyond geographical and topographical isolation, there is an\r\nisolation of another kind regarded by some as having had an important share\r\nin organic evolution. Foreshadowed by Mr. Belt, subsequently enunciated by\r\nMr. Catchpool, fully thought out by Mr. Gulick, and more recently\r\nelaborated by Dr. Romanes, \"Physiological Selection\" is held to account for\r\nthe genesis of marked varieties side by side with their parents. It is\r\ncontended that without the kind of isolation implied by it, variations will\r\nbe swamped by inter-crossing, and divergence prevented; but that by the aid\r\nof this kind of isolation, a uniform species may be differentiated into two\r\nor more species, though its members continue to live in the same area.\r\n\r\nFacts are assigned to show that slightly unlike varieties may become unable\r\nto inter-breed either with the parent-species or with one another. This\r\nmutual inferiority is not of the kind we might expect. We might reasonably\r\nsuppose that when varieties had diverged widely, crossing would be\r\nimpracticable, because their constitutions had become so far unlike as to\r\nform an unworkable mixture. But there seems evidence that the infertility\r\narises long before such a cause could operate, and that instead of failure\r\nto produce a workable constitution, there is failure to produce any\r\nconstitution at all--failure to fertilize. Some change in the sexual system\r\nis suggested as accounting for this. That a minute difference in the\r\nreproductive elements may suffice, plants prove by the fact that when two\r\nmembers of slightly-divergent varieties are fertilized by each other's\r\npollen, the fertility is less than if each were fertilized by the pollen of\r\nits own variety; and where the two kinds of pollen are both used, that\r\nderived from members of the same variety is prepotent in its effect over\r\nthat derived from members of the other variety.\r\n\r\nThe writers above named contend that variations must occur in the\r\nreproductive organs as well as in other organs; that such variations may\r\nproduce relative infertility in particular directions; and that such\r\nrelative infertility may be the first step towards prevention of crossing\r\nand establishment of isolation: so making possible the accumulation of such\r\ndifferences as mark off new species. Without doubt we have here a\r\nlegitimate supposition and a legitimate inference. Necessarily there must\r\nhappen variations of the kind alleged, and considering how sensitive the\r\nreproductive system is to occult influences (witness among ourselves the\r\nfrequent infertility of healthy people while feeble unhealthy ones are\r\nfertile), it is reasonable to infer that minute and obscure alterations of\r\nthis kind may make slightly-different varieties unable to inter-breed.\r\n\r\nGranting that there goes on this \"physiological selection,\" we must\r\nrecognize it as one among the causes by which isolation is produced, and\r\nthe differentiating influence of natural selection in the same locality\r\nmade possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 174g. The foregoing criticisms and hypotheses do not, however, affect in\r\nany essential way the pre-existing conceptions. If, as in the foregoing\r\nchapters, we interpret the facts in terms of that redistribution of matter\r\nand motion constituting Evolution at large, we shall see that the general\r\ntheory, as previously held, remains outstanding.\r\n\r\nIt is indisputable that to maintain its life an organism must maintain the\r\nmoving equilibrium of its functions in presence of environing actions. This\r\nis a truism: overthrow of the equilibrium is death. It is a corollary that\r\nwhen the environment is changed, the equilibrium of functions is disturbed,\r\nand there must follow one of two results--either the equilibrium is\r\noverthrown or it is re-adjusted: there is a re-equilibration. Only two\r\npossible ways of effecting the re-adjustment exist--the direct and the\r\nindirect. In the one case the changed outer action so alters the moving\r\nequilibrium as to call forth an equivalent reaction which balances it. If\r\nre-equilibration is not thus effected in the individual it is effected in\r\nthe succession of individuals. Either the species altogether disappears, or\r\nelse there disappear, generation after generation, those members of it the\r\nequilibria of whose functions are least congruous with the changed actions\r\nin the environment; and this is the survival of the fittest or natural\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nIf now we persist in thus contemplating the problem as a statico-dynamical\r\none, we shall see that much of the discussion commonly carried on is beside\r\nthe question. The centre around which the collision of arguments has taken\r\nplace, is the question of the formation of species. But here we see that\r\nthis question is a secondary and, in a sense, irrelevant one. We are\r\nconcerned with the production of evolving and diverging organic forms; and\r\nwhether these are or are not marked off by so-called specific traits, and\r\nwhether they will or will not breed together, matters little to the general\r\nargument. If two divisions of a species, falling into unlike conditions and\r\nbecoming re-equilibrated with them, eventually acquire the differences of\r\nnature called specific, this is but a collateral result. The _essential_\r\nresult is the formation of divergent organic forms. The biologic\r\natmosphere, so to speak, has been vitiated by the conceptions of past\r\nnaturalists, with whom the identification and classification of species was\r\nthe be-all and end-all of their science, and who regarded the traits which\r\nenabled them to mark off their specimens from one another, as the traits of\r\ncardinal importance in Nature. But after ignoring these technical ideas it\r\nbecomes manifest that the distinctions, morphological or physiological,\r\ntaken as tests of species, are merely incidental phenomena.\r\n\r\nMoreover, on continuing thus to look at the facts, we shall better\r\nunderstand the relation between adaptive and specific characters, and\r\nbetween specific characters and those many small differences which always\r\naccompany them. For during re-equilibration there must, beyond those\r\nchanges of structure required to balance outer actions by inner actions, be\r\nnumerous minor changes. In any complex moving equilibrium alterations of\r\nlarger elements inevitably cause alterations of elements immediately\r\ndependent on them, and these again of others: the effects reverberate and\r\nre-reverberate throughout the entire aggregate of actions down to the most\r\nminute. Of resulting structural changes a few will be conspicuous, more\r\nwill be less conspicuous, and so on continuously multiplying in number and\r\ndecreasing in amount.\r\n\r\nHere seems a fit place for remarking that there are certain processes which\r\ndo not enter into these re-equilibrations but in a sense interfere with\r\nthem. One example must suffice. Among dogs may be observed the trick of\r\nrolling on some mass having a strong animal smell: commonly a decaying\r\ncarcase. This trick has probably been derived from the trick of rolling on\r\nthe body of an animal caught and killed, and so gaining a tempting odour. A\r\nmale dog which first did this, and left a trail apt to be mistaken for that\r\nof prey, would be more easily found by a female, and would be more likely\r\nthan others to leave posterity. Now such a trick could have no relation to\r\nbetter maintenance of the moving equilibrium, and might very well arise in\r\na dog having no superiority. If it arose in one of the worst it would be\r\neliminated from the species, but if it arose in one of medium constitution,\r\nfairly capable of self-preservation, it would tend to produce survival of\r\ncertain of the less fit rather than the fittest. Probably there are many\r\nsuch minor traits which are in a sense accidental, and are neither adaptive\r\nnor specific in the ordinary sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 174h. But now let it be confessed that though all phenomena of organic\r\nevolution must fall within the lines above indicated, there remain many\r\nunsolved problems.\r\n\r\nTake as an instance the descent of the testes in the _Mammalia_. Neither\r\ndirect nor indirect equilibration accounts for this. We cannot consider it\r\nan adaptive change, since there seems no way in which the production of\r\nsperm-cells, internally carried on in a bird, is made external by\r\nadjustment to the changed requirements of mammalian life. Nor can we\r\nascribe it to survival of the fittest; for it is incredible that any mammal\r\nwas ever advantaged in the struggle for life by this changed position of\r\nthese organs. Contrariwise, the removal of them from a place of safety to a\r\nplace of danger, would seem to be negatived by natural selection. Nor can\r\nwe regard the transposition as a concomitant of re-equilibration; since it\r\ncan hardly be due to some change in the general physiological balance.\r\n\r\nAn example of another order is furnished by the mason-wasp. Several\r\ninstincts, capacities, peculiarities, which are in a sense independent\r\nthough they cooperate to the same end, are here displayed. There is the\r\ninstinct to build a cell of grains of sand, and the ability to do this,\r\nwhich though in a sense separate may be regarded as an accompaniment; and\r\nthere is the secretion of a cement--a physiological process not directly\r\nconnected with the psychological process. After oviposition there comes\r\ninto play the instinct to seek, carry home, and pack into the cell, the\r\nsmall caterpillars, spiders, &c., which are to serve as food for the larva;\r\nand then there is the instinct to sting each of them at a spot where the\r\ninjected hypnotic poison keeps the creature insensible though alive till it\r\nis wanted. These cannot be regarded as parts of a whole developed in\r\nsimultaneous coordination. There is no direct connexion between the\r\nbuilding instinct and the hypnotizing instinct; still less between these\r\ninstincts and the associated appliances. What were the early stages they\r\npassed through imagination fails to suggest. Their usefulness depends on\r\ntheir combination; and this combination would seem to have been useless\r\nuntil they had all reached something like their present completeness. Nor\r\ncan we in this case ascribe anything to the influence of teaching by\r\nimitation, supposed to explain the doings of social insects; for the\r\nmason-wasp is solitary.\r\n\r\nThus the process of organic evolution is far from being fully understood.\r\nWe can only suppose that as there are devised by human beings many puzzles\r\napparently unanswerable till the answer is given, and many necromantic\r\ntricks which seem impossible till the mode of performance is shown; so\r\nthere are apparently incomprehensible results which are really achieved by\r\nnatural processes. Or, otherwise, we must conclude that since Life itself\r\nproves to be in its ultimate nature inconceivable, there is probably an\r\ninconceivable element in its ultimate workings.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A.\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL LAW OF ANIMAL FERTILITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_In the_ Westminster Review _for April, 1852, I published an essay under\r\nthe title \"A Theory of Population deduced from the General Law of Animal\r\nFertility.\" That essay was the germ of Part VI of this work, \"The Laws of\r\nMultiplication,\" in which its essential theses are fully developed. When\r\ndeveloping them, I omitted some portions of the original essay--one which\r\nwas not directly relevant, and another which contained a speculation open\r\nto criticism. As indicated in § 74f, I find that this speculation has an\r\nunexpected congruity with recent results of inquiry. I therefore decide to\r\nreproduce it here along with the definition of Life propounded in that\r\nessay, which, though subsequently replaced by the definition elaborated in\r\nPart I, contains an element of truth._]\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nSome clear idea of the nature of Life itself, must, indeed, form a needful\r\npreliminary. We may be sure that a search for the influences determining\r\nthe maintenance and multiplication of living organisms, cannot be\r\nsuccessfully carried out unless we understand what is the peculiar property\r\nof a living organism--what is the widest generalization of the phenomena\r\nthat indicate life. By way of preparation, therefore, for the Theory of\r\nPopulation presently to be developed, we propose devoting a brief space to\r\nthis prior question.\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nEmploying the term, then, in its usual sense, as applicable only to\r\norganisms, Life may be defined as--_the co-ordination of actions_. The\r\ngrowth of a crystal, which is the highest inorganic process we are\r\nacquainted with, involves but one action--that of accretion. The growth of\r\na cell, which is the lowest organic process, involves two\r\nactions--accretion and disintegration--repair and waste--assimilation and\r\noxidation. Wholly deprive a cell of oxygen, and it becomes inert--ceases to\r\nmanifest vital phenomena; or, as we say, dies. Give it no matter to\r\nassimilate, and it wastes away and disappears, from continual oxidation.\r\nEvidently, then, it is in the balance of these two actions that the life\r\nconsists. It is not in the assimilation alone; for the crystal assimilates:\r\nneither is it in the oxidation alone; for oxidation is common to inorganic\r\nmatter: but it is in the joint maintenance of these--the _co-ordination_ of\r\nthem. So long as the two go on together, life continues: suspend either of\r\nthem, and the result is--death.\r\n\r\nThe attribute which thus distinguishes the lowest organic from the highest\r\ninorganic bodies, similarly distinguishes the higher organisms from the\r\nlower ones. It is in the greater complexity of the co-ordination--that is,\r\nin the greater number and variety of the co-ordinated actions--that every\r\nadvance in the scale of being essentially consists. And whether we regard\r\nthe numerous vital processes carried on in a creature of complex structure\r\nas so many additional processes, or whether, more philosophically, we\r\nregard them as subdivisions of the two fundamental ones--oxidation and\r\naccretion--the co-ordination of them is still the life. Thus turning to\r\nwhat is physiologically classified as the _vegetative system_, we see that\r\nstomach, lungs, heart, liver, skin, and the rest, must work in concert. If\r\none of them does too much or too little--that is, if the co-ordination be\r\nimperfect--the life is disturbed; and if one of them ceases to act--that\r\nis, if the co-ordination be destroyed--the life is destroyed. So likewise\r\nis it with the _animal system_, which indirectly assists in co-ordinating\r\nthe actions of the viscera by supplying food and oxygen. Its component\r\nparts, the limbs, senses, and instruments of attack or defence must perform\r\ntheir several offices in proper sequence; and further, must conjointly\r\nminister to the periodic demands of the viscera, that these may in turn\r\nsupply blood. How completely the several attributes of animal life come\r\nwithin the definition, we shall best see on going through them _seriatim_.\r\n\r\nThus _Strength_ results from the co-ordination of actions; for it is\r\nproduced by the simultaneous contraction of many muscles and many fibres of\r\neach muscle; and the strength is great in proportion to the number of these\r\nacting together--that is, in proportion to the co-ordination. _Swiftness_\r\nalso, depending partly on strength, but requiring also the rapid\r\nalternation of movements, equally comes under the expression; seeing that,\r\nother things equal, the more quickly sequent actions can be made to follow\r\neach other, the more completely are they co-ordinated. So, too, is it with\r\n_Agility_; the power of a chamois to spring with safety from crag to crag\r\nimplies accurate co-ordination in the movements of many different muscles,\r\nand a due subordination of them all to the perceptions. The definition\r\nsimilarly includes _Instinct_, which consists in the uniform succession of\r\ncertain actions or series of actions after certain sensations or groups of\r\nsensations; and that which surprises us in instinct is the accuracy with\r\nwhich these compound actions respond to these compound sensations; that\r\nis--the completeness of their co-ordination. Thus, likewise, is it with\r\n_Intelligence_, even in its highest manifestations. That which we call\r\nrationality is the power to combine, or co-ordinate a great number and a\r\ngreat variety of complex actions for the achievement of a desired result.\r\nThe husbandman has in the course of years, by drainage and manuring, to\r\nbring his ground into a fertile state; in the autumn he must plough,\r\nharrow, and sow, for his next year's crop; must subsequently hoe and weed,\r\nkeep out cattle, and scare away birds; when harvest comes, must adapt the\r\nmode and time of getting in his produce to the weather and the labour\r\nmarket; he must afterwards decide when, and where, and how to sell to the\r\nbest advantage; and must do all this that he may get food and clothing for\r\nhis family. By properly coordinating these various processes (each of which\r\ninvolves many others)--by choosing right modes, right times, right\r\nquantities, right qualities, and performing his acts in right order, he\r\nattains his end. But if he have done too little of this, or too much of\r\nthat; or have done one thing when he should have done another--if his\r\nproceedings have been badly co-ordinated--that is, if he have lacked\r\nintelligence--he fails.\r\n\r\nWe find, then, that _the co-ordination of actions_ is a definition of Life,\r\nwhich includes alike its highest and its lowest manifestations; and not\r\nonly so, but expresses likewise the degree of Life, seeing that the Life is\r\nhigh in proportion as the co-ordination is great. Proceeding upwards, from\r\nthe simplest organic cell in which there are but two interdependent\r\nactions, on through the group in which many such cells are acting in\r\nconcert, on through the higher group in which some of these cells assume\r\nmainly the respiratory and others the assimilative function--proceeding\r\nstill higher to organisms in which these two functions are subdivided into\r\nmany others, and in which some cells begin to act together as contractile\r\nfibres; next to organisms in which the visceral division of labour is\r\ncarried yet further, and in which many contractile fibres act together as\r\nmuscles--ascending again to creatures that combine the movements of several\r\nlimbs and many bones and muscles in one action; and further, to creatures\r\nin which complex impressions are followed by the complex acts we term\r\ninstinctive--and arriving finally at man, in whom not only are the separate\r\nacts complex, but who achieves his ends by combining together an immense\r\nnumber and variety of acts often extending through years--we see that the\r\nprogress is uniformly towards greater co-ordination of actions. Moreover,\r\nthis co-ordination of actions unconsciously constitutes the essence of our\r\ncommon notion of life; for we shall find, on inquiry, that when we infer\r\nthe death of an animal, which does not move on being touched, we infer it\r\nbecause we miss the usual co-ordination of a sensation and a motion: and we\r\nshall also find, that the test by which we habitually rank creatures high\r\nor low in the scale of vitality is the degree of co-ordination their\r\nactions exhibit.\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nThere remains but to notice the objection which possibly may be raised,\r\nthat the co-ordination of actions is not life, but the ability to maintain\r\nlife. Lack of space forbids going into this at length. It must suffice to\r\nsay, that life and the ability to maintain life will be found the same. We\r\nperpetually expend the vitality we have that we may continue our vitality.\r\nOur power to breathe a minute hence depends upon our breathing now. We must\r\ndigest during this week that we may have strength to digest next. That we\r\nmay get more food, we must use the force which the food we have eaten gives\r\nus. Everywhere vigorous life is the strength, activity, and sagacity\r\nwhereby life is maintained; and equally in descending the scale of being,\r\nor in watching the decline of an invalid, we see that the ebbing away of\r\nlife is the ebbing away of the ability to preserve life.[62]\r\n\r\n[Only on now coming to re-read the definition of Life enunciated at the\r\ncommencement of this essay with the arguments used in justification of it,\r\ndoes it occur to me that its essential thought ought to have been\r\nincorporated in the definition of Life given in Part I. The idea of\r\nco-ordination is there implied in the idea of correspondence, but the idea\r\nof co-ordination is so cardinal a one that it should be expressed not by\r\nimplication but overtly. It is too late to make the required amendment in\r\nthe proper place, for the first part of this work is already stereotyped\r\nand printed. Being unable to do better I make the amendment here. The\r\nformula as completed will run:--The definite combination of heterogeneous\r\nchanges, both simultaneous and successful, _co-ordinated into_\r\ncorrespondence with external co-existences and sequences.]\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nEnding here this preliminary dissertation, let us now proceed to our\r\nspecial subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. On contemplating its general circumstances, we perceive that any race\r\nof organisms is subject to two sets of conflicting influences. On the one\r\nhand by natural death, by enemies, by lack of food, by atmospheric changes,\r\n&c., it is constantly being destroyed. On the other hand, partly by the\r\nstrength, swiftness and sagacity of its members, and partly by their\r\nfertility, it is constantly being maintained. These conflicting sets of\r\ninfluences may be conveniently generalized as--the forces destructive of\r\nrace, and the forces preservative of race.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. Whilst any race continues to exist, the forces destructive of it and\r\nthe forces preservative of it must perpetually tend towards equilibrium. If\r\nthe forces destructive of it decrease, the race must gradually become more\r\nnumerous, until, either from lack of food or from increase of enemies, the\r\ndestroying forces again balance the preserving forces. If, reversely, the\r\nforces destructive of it increase, then the race must diminish, until,\r\neither from its food becoming relatively more abundant, or from its enemies\r\ndying of hunger, the destroying forces sink to the level of the preserving\r\nforces. Should the destroying forces be of a kind that cannot be thus met\r\n(as great change of climate), the race, by becoming extinct, is removed out\r\nof the category. Hence this is necessarily the _law of maintenance_ of all\r\nraces; seeing that when they cease to conform to it they cease to be.\r\n\r\nNow the forces preservative of race are two--ability in each member of the\r\nrace to preserve itself, and ability to produce other members--power to\r\nmaintain individual life, and power to propagate the species. These must\r\nvary inversely. When, from lowness of organization, the ability to contend\r\nwith external dangers is small, there must be great fertility to compensate\r\nfor the consequent mortality; otherwise the race must die out. When, on the\r\ncontrary, high endowments give much capacity of self-preservation, there\r\nneeds a correspondingly low degree of fertility. Given the dangers to be\r\nmet as a constant quantity; then, as the ability of any species to meet\r\nthem must be a constant quantity too, and as this is made up of the two\r\nfactors--power to maintain individual life and power to multiply--these\r\ncannot do other than vary inversely.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. To show that observed phenomena harmonise with this _à priori_\r\nprinciple seems scarcely needful But, though axiomatic in its character,\r\nand therefore incapable of being rendered more certain, yet illustrations\r\nof the conformity to it which nature everywhere exhibits, will facilitate\r\nthe general apprehension of it.\r\n\r\nIn the vegetable kingdom we find that the species consisting of simple\r\ncells, exhibit the highest reproductive power. The yeast fungus, which in a\r\nfew hours propagates itself throughout a large mass of wort, offers a\r\nfamiliar example of the extreme rapidity with which these lowly organisms\r\nmultiply. In the _Protococcus nivalis_, a microscopic plant which in the\r\ncourse of a night reddens many square miles of snow, we have a like\r\nexample; as also in the minute _Algæ_, which colour the waters of stagnant\r\npools. The sudden appearance of green films on damp decaying surfaces, the\r\nspread of mould over stale food, and the rapid destruction of crops by\r\nmildew, afford further instances. If we ascend a step to plants of\r\nappreciable size, we still find that in proportion as the organization is\r\nlow the fertility is great. Thus of the common puff-ball, which is little\r\nmore than a mere aggregation of cells, Fries says, \"in a single individual\r\nof _Reticularia maxima_, I have counted (calculated?) 10,000,000 sporules.\"\r\nFrom this point upwards, increase of bulk and greater complexity of\r\nstructure are still accompanied by diminished reproductive power; instance\r\nthe _Macrocystis pyrifera_, a gigantic sea-weed, which sometimes attains a\r\nlength of 1500 feet, of which Carpenter remarks, \"This development of the\r\nnutritive surface takes place at the expense of the fructifying apparatus,\r\nwhich is here quite subordinate.\"[63] And when we arrive at the\r\nhighly-organized exogenous trees, we find that not only are they many years\r\nbefore beginning to bear with any abundance, but that even then they\r\nproduce, at the outside, but a few thousand seeds in a twelvemonth. During\r\nits centuries of existence, an oak does not develop as many acorns as a\r\nfungus does spores in a single night.\r\n\r\nStill more clearly is this truth illustrated throughout the animal kingdom.\r\nThough not so great as the fertility of the Protophyta, which, as Prof.\r\nHenslow says, in some cases passes comprehension, the fertility of the\r\nProtozoa is yet almost beyond belief. In the polygastric animalcules\r\nspontaneous fission takes place so rapidly that \"it has been calculated by\r\nProf. Ehrenberg that no fewer than 268 millions might be produced in a\r\nmonth from a single _Paramecium_;\"[64] and even this astonishing rate of\r\nincrease is far exceeded in another species, one individual of which, \"only\r\nto be perceived by means of a high magnifying power, is calculated to\r\ngenerate 170 billions in four days.\"[65] Amongst the larger organisms\r\nexhibiting this lowest mode of reproduction under a modified form--that of\r\ngemmation--we see that, though not nearly so rapid as in the Infusoria, the\r\nrate of multiplication is still extremely high. This fact is well\r\nillustrated by the polypes; and in the apparent suddenness with which whole\r\ndistricts are blighted by the Aphis (multiplying by internal gemmation), we\r\nhave a familiar instance of the startling results which the parthenogenetic\r\nprocess can achieve. Where reproduction becomes occasional instead of\r\ncontinuous, as it does amongst higher creatures, the fertility equally\r\nbears an inverse ratio to the development. \"The queen ant of the African\r\n_Termites_ lays 80,000 eggs in twenty-four hours; and the common hairworm\r\n(_Gordius_) as many as 8,000,000 in less than one day.\"[66] Amongst the\r\n_Vertebrata_ the lowest are still the most prolific. \"It has been\r\ncalculated,\" says Carpenter, \"that above a million of eggs are produced at\r\nonce by a single codfish.\"[67] In the strong and sagacious shark\r\ncomparatively few are found. Still less fertile are the higher reptiles.\r\nAnd amongst the Mammalia, beginning with small Rodents, which quickly reach\r\nmaturity, produce large litters, and several litters in the year; advancing\r\nstep by step to the higher mammals, some of which are long in attaining the\r\nreproductive age, others of which produce but one litter in a year, others\r\nbut one young one at a time, others who unite these peculiarities; and\r\nending with the elephant and man, the least prolific of all, we find that\r\nthroughout this class, as throughout the rest, ability to multiply\r\ndecreases as ability to maintain individual life increases.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4. The _à priori_ principle thus exemplified has an obverse of a like\r\naxiomatic character. We have seen that for the continuance of any race of\r\norganisms it is needful that the power of self-preservation and the power\r\nof reproduction should vary inversely.\r\n\r\nWe shall now see that, quite irrespective of such an end to be subserved,\r\nthese powers could not do otherwise than vary inversely. In the nature of\r\nthings species can subsist only by conforming to this law; and equally in\r\nthe nature of things they cannot help conforming to it.\r\n\r\nReproduction, under all its forms, may be described as the separation of\r\nportions of a parent plant or animal for the purpose of forming other\r\nplants or animals. Whether it be by spontaneous fission, by gemmation, or\r\nby gemmules; whether the detached products be bulbels, spores or seeds,\r\novisacs, ova or spermatozoa; or however the process of multiplication be\r\nmodified, it essentially consists in the throwing off of parts of adult\r\norganisms for the purpose of making new organisms. On the other hand, self\r\npreservation is fundamentally a maintenance of the organism in undiminished\r\nbulk. Amongst the lowest forms of life, aggregation of tissue is the only\r\nmode in which the self-preserving power is shown. Even in the highest,\r\nsustaining the body in its integrity is that in which self-preservation\r\nmost truly consists--is the end which the widest intelligence is indirectly\r\nmade to subserve. Whilst, on the one side, it cannot be denied that the\r\nincrease of tissue constituting growth is self-preservation both in essence\r\nand in result; neither can it, on the other side, be denied that a\r\ndiminution of tissue, either from injury, disease, or old age, is in both\r\nessence and result the reverse.\r\n\r\nHence the maintenance of the individual and the propagation of the race\r\nbeing respectively aggregative and separative, _necessarily_ vary\r\ninversely. Every generative product is a deduction from the parental life;\r\nand, as already pointed out, to diminish life is to diminish the ability to\r\npreserve life. The portion thrown off is organised matter; vital force has\r\nbeen expended in the organisation of it, and in the assimilation of its\r\ncomponent elements; which vital force, had no such portion been made and\r\nthrown off, _would have been available for the preservation of the parent_.\r\n\r\nNeither of these forces, therefore, can increase, save at the expense of\r\nthe other. The one draws in and incorporates new material; the other throws\r\noff material previously incorporated. The one adds to; the other takes\r\nfrom. Using a convenient expression for describing the facts (though one\r\nthat must not be construed into an hypothesis), we may say that the force\r\nwhich builds up and repairs the individual is an attractive force, whilst\r\nthat which throws off germs is a repulsive force. But whatever may turn out\r\nto be the true nature of the two processes, it is clear that they are\r\nmutually destructive; or, stating the proposition in its briefest\r\nform--Individuation and Reproduction are antagonistic.\r\n\r\nAgain, illustrating the abstract by reference to the concrete, let us now\r\ntrace throughout the organic world the various phases of this antagonism.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5. All the lowest animal and vegetable forms--_Protozoa_ and\r\n_Protophyta_--consist essentially of a single cell containing fluid, and\r\nhaving usually a solid nucleus. This is true of the Infusoria, the simplest\r\nEntozoa, and the microscopic Algæ and Fungi. The organisms so constituted\r\nuniformly multiply by spontaneous fission. The nucleus, originally\r\nspherical, becomes elongated, then constricted across its smallest\r\ndiameter, and ultimately separates, when \"its divisions,\" says Prof. Owen,\r\ndescribing the process in the Infusoria, \"seem to repel each other to\r\npositions equidistant from each other, and from the pole or end of the body\r\nto which they are nearest. The influence of these distinct centres of\r\nassimilation is to divert the flow of the plasmatic fluid from a common\r\ncourse through the body of the polygastrian to two special courses about\r\nthose centres. So much of the primary developmental process is renewed, as\r\nleads to the insulation of the sphere of the influence of each assimilative\r\ncentre from that of the other by the progressive formation of a double\r\nparty wall of integument, attended by progressive separation of one party\r\nwall from the other, and by concomitant constriction of the body of the\r\npolygastrian, until the vibratile action of the superficial cilia of each\r\nseparating moiety severs the narrowed neck of union, and they become two\r\ndistinct individuals.\"[68] Similar in its general view is Dr. Carpenter's\r\ndescription of the multiplication of vegetable cells, which he says divide,\r\n\"in virtue, it may be surmised, of a sort of mutual repulsion between the\r\ntwo halves of the endochrome (coloured cell-contents) which leads to their\r\nspontaneous separation.\"[69] Under a modified form of this process, the\r\ncell-contents, instead of undergoing bisection, divide into numerous parts,\r\neach of which ultimately becomes a separate individual. In some of the Algæ\r\n\"a whole brood of young cells may thus be at once generated in the cavity\r\nof the parent-cell, which subsequently bursts and sets them free.\"[70] The\r\n_Achlya prolifera_ multiplies after this fashion. Amongst the Fungi, too,\r\nthe same mode of increase is exemplified by the _Protococcus nivalis_. And\r\n\"it would appear that certain Infusoria, especially the _Kolpodinæ_,\r\npropagate by the breaking-up of their own mass into reproductive\r\nparticles.\"[71]\r\n\r\nNow in this fissiparous mode of multiplication, which \"is amazingly\r\nproductive, and indeed surpasses in fertility any other with which we are\r\nacquainted,\"[72] we see most clearly the antagonism between individuation\r\nand reproduction. We see that the reproductive process involves destruction\r\nof the individual; for in becoming two, the parent fungus or polygastrian\r\nmust be held to lose its own proper existence; and when it breaks up into a\r\nnumerous progeny, does so still more completely. Moreover, this rapid mode\r\nof multiplication not only destroys the individuals in whom it takes place,\r\nbut also involves that their individualities, whilst they continue, shall\r\nbe of the lowest kind. For assume a protozoon to be growing by imbibition\r\nat a given rate, and it follows that the oftener it divides the smaller\r\nmust be the size it attains to; that is, the smaller the development of its\r\nindividuality. And a further manifestation of the same truth is seen in the\r\nfact that the more frequent the spontaneous fission the shorter the\r\nexistence of each individual. So that alike by preventing anything beyond a\r\nmicroscopic bulk being attained, by preventing the continuance of this in\r\nits integrity beyond a few hours, and by being fatal when it occurs, this\r\nmost active mode of reproduction shows the strongest antagonism to\r\nindividual life.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6. Whether or not we regard reproduction as resulting from a repulsive\r\nforce (and, as seen above, both Owen and Carpenter lean to some such view),\r\nand whether or not we consider the formation of the individual as due to\r\nthe reverse of this--an attractive force--we cannot, on studying the\r\nphenomena, help admitting that two opposite activities thus generalized are\r\nat work; we cannot help admitting that the aggregative and separative\r\ntendencies do in each case determine the respective developments of the\r\nindividual and the race. On ascending one degree in the scale of organic\r\nlife, we shall find this truth clearly exemplified.\r\n\r\nFor if these single-celled organisms which multiply so rapidly be supposed\r\nto lose some of their separative tendency, what must be the result? They\r\nnow not only divide frequently, but the divided portions fly apart. How,\r\nthen, will a diminution of this separative tendency first show itself? May\r\nwe not expect that it will show itself in the divided portions _not_ flying\r\napart, but remaining near each other, and forming a group? This we find in\r\nnature to be the first step in advance. The lowest compound organisms are\r\n\"_simple aggregations of vesicles without any definite arrangement,\r\nsometimes united, but capable of existing separately_.\"[73] In these cases,\r\n\"every component cell of the aggregate mass that springs from a single\r\ngerm, being capable of existing independently of the rest, may be regarded\r\nas a distinct individual.\"[74] The several stages of this aggregation are\r\nvery clearly seen in both the animal and vegetable kingdoms. In the\r\n_Hæmatococcus binalis_, the plant producing the reddish slime seen on damp\r\nsurfaces, not only does each of the cells retain its original sphericity,\r\nbut each is separated from its neighbour by a wide interval filled with\r\nmucus; so that it is only as being diffused through a mass of mucus common\r\nto them all, that these cells can be held to constitute one individual. We\r\nfind, too, that \"the component cells, even in the highest Algæ, are\r\ngenerally separated from each other by a large quantity of mucilaginous\r\nintercellular substance.\"[75] And, again, the tissue of the simpler\r\nLichens, \"in consequence of the very slight adhesion of its component\r\ncells, is said to be pulverulent.\"[76] Similarly the Protozoa, by their\r\nfeeble union, constitute the organisms next above them. Amongst the\r\nPolygastrica there are many cases \"in which the individuals produced by\r\nfission or gemmation do not become completely detached from each\r\nother.\"[77] The _Ophrydium_, for instance, \"exists under the form of a\r\nmotionless jelly-like mass ... made up of millions of distinct and similar\r\nindividuals imbedded in a gelatinous connecting substance;\"[78] and again,\r\nthe _Uvella_, or \"grape monad,\" consists of a cluster \"which strongly\r\nresembles a transparent mulberry rolling itself across the field of view by\r\nthe ciliary action of its component individuals.\"[79] The parenchyma of the\r\nSponge, too, is made up of cells \"each of which has the character of a\r\ndistinct animalcule, having a certain power of spontaneous motion,\r\nobtaining and assimilating its own food, and altogether living _by_ and\r\n_for_ itself;\" and so small is the cohesion of these individual cells, that\r\nthe tissue they constitute \"drains away when the mass is removed from the\r\nwater, like white of egg.\"[80]\r\n\r\nOf course in proportion as the aggregate tendency leading to the formation\r\nof these groups of monads is strong, we may expect that, other things\r\nequal, the groups will be large. Proceeding upwards from the yeast fungus,\r\nwhose cells hold together in groups of four, five, and six,[81] there must\r\nbe found in each species of these composite organisms a size of group\r\ndetermined by the strength of the aggregative tendency in that species.\r\nHence we may expect that, when this limit is passed, the group no longer\r\nremains united, but divides. Such we find to be the fact. These groups of\r\ncells undergo the same process that the cells themselves do. They increase\r\nup to a certain point, and then multiply either by simple spontaneous\r\nfission or by that modification of it called gemmation. The _Volvox\r\nglobator_, which is made up of a number of monads associated together in\r\nthe form of a hollow sphere, develops within itself a number of smaller\r\nspheres similarly constituted; and after these, swimming freely in its\r\ninterior, have reached a certain size, the parent group of animalcules\r\nbursts and sets the interior groups free. And here we may observe how this\r\ncompound individuality of the Volvox is destroyed in the act of\r\nreproduction as the simple individuality of the monad is. Again, in the\r\nhigher forms of grouped cells, where something like organisation begins to\r\nshow itself, the aggregations are not only larger, but the separative\r\nprocess, now carried on by the method of gemmation, no longer wholly\r\ndestroys the individual. And in fact, this gemmation may be regarded as the\r\nform which spontaneous fission must assume in ceasing to be fatal; seeing\r\nthat gemmation essentially consists in the separation, not into halves, but\r\ninto a larger part and a smaller part; the larger part continuing to\r\nrepresent the original individual. Thus in the common _Hydra_ or\r\nfresh-water polype, \"little bud-like processes are developed from the\r\nexternal surface, which are soon observed to resemble the parent in\r\ncharacter, possessing a digestive sac, mouth, and tentacula; for a long\r\ntime, however, their cavity is connected with that of the parent; but at\r\nlast the communication is cut off, and the young polype quits its\r\nattachment, and goes in quest of its own maintenance.\"[82]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 7. Progress from these forms of organisation to still higher forms is\r\nsimilarly characterized by increase of the aggregative tendency or\r\ndiminution of the separative, and similarly exhibits the necessary\r\nantagonism between the development of the individual and the increase of\r\nthe race. That process of grouping which constitutes the first step towards\r\nthe production of complex organisms, we shall now find repeated in the\r\nformation of series of groups. Just as a diminution of the separative\r\ntendency is shown in the aggregation of divided monads, so is a further\r\ndiminution of it shown in the aggregation of the divided groups of monads.\r\nThe first instance that occurs is afforded by the compound polypes. \"Some\r\nof the simpler forms of the composite _Hydroida_,\" says Carpenter, \"may be\r\nlikened to a _Hydra_, whose gemmæ, instead of becoming detached, remain\r\npermanently connected with the parent; and as these in their turn may\r\ndevelop gemmæ from their own bodies, a structure of more or less\r\narborescent character may be produced.\"[83] A similar species of\r\ncombination is observable amongst the _Bryozoa_, and the compound\r\n_Tunicata_. Every degree of union may be found amongst these associated\r\norganisms; from the one extreme in which the individuals can exist as well\r\napart as together, to the other extreme in which the individuals are lost\r\nin the general mass. Whilst each _Bryozoon_ is tolerably independent of its\r\nneighbour, \"in the compound _Hydroida_, the lives of the polypes are\r\nsubordinate to that of the polypdom.\"[84] Of the _Salpidæ_ and\r\n_Pyrosomidæ_, Carpenter says:--\"Although closely attached to one another,\r\nthese associated animals are capable of being separated by a smart shock\r\napplied to the sides of the vessel in which they are swimming.... In other\r\nspecies, however, the separate animals are imbedded in a gelatinous mass,\"\r\nand in one kind \"there is an absolute union between the vascular systems of\r\nthe different individuals.\"[85]\r\n\r\nIn the same manner that with a given aggregative tendency there is a limit\r\nto the size of groups, so is there a similarly-determined limit to the size\r\nof series of groups; and that spontaneous fission which we have seen in\r\ncells and groups of cells we here find repeated. In the lower _Annelida_,\r\nfor example, \"after the number of segments in the body has been greatly\r\nmultiplied by gemmation, a separation of those of the posterior portion\r\nbegins to take place; a constriction forms itself about the beginning of\r\nthe posterior third of the body, in front of which the alimentary canal\r\nundergoes a dilatation, whilst on the segment behind it a proboscis and\r\neyes are developed, so as to form the head of the young animal which is to\r\nbe budded off; and in due time, by the narrowing of the constriction, a\r\ncomplete separation is effected.\"[86] Not unfrequently in the _Nais_ this\r\nprocess is repeated in the young one before it becomes independent of the\r\nparent. The higher _Annelida_ are distinguished by the greater number of\r\nsegments held in continuity; an obvious result of comparatively infrequent\r\nfission. In the class _Myriapoda_, which stands next above, \"there is no\r\nknown instance of multiplication by fission.\"[87] Yet even here the law may\r\nbe traced both in the number and structure of the segments. The length of\r\nthe body is still increased after birth \"by gemmation from (or partial\r\nfission of) the penultimate segment.\" The lower members of the class are\r\ndistinguished from the higher by the greater extent to which this gemmation\r\nis carried. Moreover, the growing aggregative tendency is seen in the fact,\r\nthat each segment of the Julus \"is formed by the coalescence of two\r\noriginal segments,\"[88] whilst in the _Scolopendridæ_, which are the\r\nhighest of this class, \"the head, according to Mr. Newport, is composed of\r\neight segments, which are often consolidated into one piece;\"[89] both of\r\nwhich phenomena may be understood as arrests of that process of fission,\r\nwhich, if allowed to go a little further, would have produced distinct\r\nsegments; and, if allowed to go further still, would have separated these\r\nsegments into groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 8. Remarking, first, how gradually this mode of multiplication\r\ndisappears--how there are some creatures that spontaneously divide or not\r\naccording to circumstances; others that divide when in danger (the several\r\nparts being capable of growing into complete individuals); others which,\r\nthough not self-dividing, can live on in each half if artificially divided;\r\nand others in which only one of the divided halves can live--how, again, in\r\nthe Crustaceans the power is limited to the reproduction of lost limbs; how\r\nthere are certain reptiles that can re-supply a lost tail, but only\r\nimperfectly; and how amongst the higher _Vertebrata_ the ability to repair\r\nsmall injuries is all that remains--remarking thus much, let us now, by way\r\nof preparation for what is to follow, consider the significance of the\r\nforegoing facts taken in connection with the definition of Life awhile\r\nsince given.\r\n\r\nThis spontaneous fission, which we have seen to be, in all cases, more or\r\nless destructive of individual life, is simply a cessation in the\r\nco-ordination of actions. From the single cell, the halves of whose\r\nnucleus, instead of continuing to act together, begin to repel each other,\r\nfly apart, establish distinct centres of assimilation, and finally cause\r\nthe cell to divide; up to the Annelidan, whose string of segments\r\nseparates, after reaching a certain length; we everywhere see the\r\nphenomenon to be fundamentally this. The tendency to separate is the\r\ntendency not to act together, probably arising from inability to act\r\ntogether any longer; and the process of separation is the process of\r\nceasing to act together. How truly non-co-ordination is the essence of the\r\nmatter will be seen on observing that fission takes place more or less\r\nrapidly, according as the co-ordinating apparatus is less or more\r\ndeveloped. Thus, \"the capability of spontaneous division is one of the most\r\ndistinctive attributes of the acrite type of structure;\"[90] the acrite\r\ntype of structure being that in which the neurine or nervous matter is\r\nsupposed to be diffused through the tissues in a molecular state, and in\r\nwhich, therefore, there exists no distinct nervous or co-ordinating system.\r\nFrom this point upwards the gradual disappearance of spontaneous fission is\r\nclearly related to the gradual appearance of nerves and ganglia--a fact\r\nwell exemplified by the several grades of _Annelida_ and _Myriapoda_. And\r\nwhen we remember that in the embryotic development of these classes, the\r\nnervous system does not make its appearance until after the rest of the\r\norganism has made great progress, we may even suspect that that coalescence\r\nof segments characteristic of the _Myriapoda_, exhibits the co-ordinating\r\npower of the rapidly-growing nervous system overtaking and arresting the\r\nseparative tendency; and doing this most where it (the nervous system) is\r\nmost developed, namely, in the head.\r\n\r\nAnd here let us remark, in passing, how, from this point of view, we still\r\nmore clearly discern the antagonism of individuation and reproduction. We\r\nbefore saw that the propagation of the race is at the expense of the\r\nindividual: in the above facts we may contemplate the obverse of this--may\r\nsee that the formation of the individual is at the expense of the race.\r\nThis combination of parts that are tending to separate and become distinct\r\nbeings--this union of many incipient minor individualities into one large\r\nindividuality--is an arrest of reproduction--a diminution in the number\r\nproduced. Either these units may part and lead independent lives, or they\r\nmay remain together and have their actions co-ordinated. Either they may,\r\nby their diffusion, form a small, simple, and prolific race, or, by their\r\naggregation, a large, complex, and infertile one. But manifestly the\r\naggregation involves the infertility; and the fertility involves the\r\nsmallness.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 9. The ability to multiply by spontaneous fission, and the ability to\r\nmaintain individual life, are opposed in yet another mode. It is not in\r\nrespect of size only, but still more in respect of structure, that the\r\nantagonism exists.\r\n\r\nHigher organisms are distinguished from lower ones partly by bulk, and\r\npartly by complexity. This complexity essentially consists in the mutual\r\ndependence of numerous different organs, each subserving the lives of the\r\nrest, and each living by the help of the rest. Instead of being made up of\r\nmany like parts, performing like functions, as the Crinoid, the Star-fish,\r\nor the Millipede, a vertebrate animal is made up of many unlike parts,\r\nperforming unlike functions. From that initial form of a compound organism,\r\nin which a number of minor individuals are simply grouped together, we may,\r\nmore or less distinctly, trace not only the increasing closeness of their\r\nunion, and the gradual disappearance of their individualities in that of\r\nthe mass, but the gradual assumption by them of special duties. And this\r\n\"physiological division of labour,\" as it has been termed, has the same\r\neffect as the division of labour amongst men. As the preservation of a\r\nnumber of persons is better secured when, uniting into a society, they\r\nseverally undertake different kinds of work, than when they are separate\r\nand each performs for himself every kind of work; so the preservation of a\r\ncongeries of parts, which, combining into one organism, respectively assume\r\nnutrition, respiration, circulation, locomotion, as separate functions, is\r\nbetter secured than when those parts are independent, and each fulfils for\r\nitself all these functions.\r\n\r\nBut the condition under which this increased ability to maintain life\r\nbecomes possible is, that the parts shall cease to separate. While they are\r\nperpetually separating, it is clear that they cannot assume mutually\r\nsubservient duties. And it is further clear that the more the tendency to\r\nseparate diminishes, that is, the larger the groups that remain connected,\r\n_the more minutely and perfectly can that subdivision of functions which we\r\ncall organization be carried out_.\r\n\r\nThus we see that in its most active form the ability to multiply is\r\nantagonistic to the ability to maintain individual life, not only as\r\npreventing increase of bulk, but also as preventing organization--not only\r\nas preventing homogeneous co-ordination, but as preventing heterogeneous\r\nco-ordination.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 10. To establish the unbroken continuity of this law of fertility, it\r\nwill be needful, before tracing its results amongst the higher animals, to\r\nexplain in what manner spontaneous fission is now understood, and what the\r\ncessation of it essentially means. Originally, naturalists supposed that\r\ncreatures which multiply by self-division, under any of its several forms,\r\ncontinue so to multiply perpetually. In many cases, however, it has\r\nlatterly been shown that they do not do this; and it is now becoming a\r\nreceived opinion that they do not, and cannot, do this, in any case. A\r\nfertilised germ appears here, as amongst higher organisms, to be the point\r\nof departure; and that constant formation of new tissue implied in the\r\nproduction of a great number of individuals by fission, seems gradually to\r\nexhaust the germinal capacity in the same way that the constant formation\r\nof new tissue, during the development of a single mammal, exhausts it. The\r\nphenomena classified by Steenstrup as \"Alternate Generation,\" and since\r\ngeneralised by Professor Owen in his work \"On Parthenogenesis,\" illustrate\r\nthis. The egg of a _Medusa_ (jellyfish) develops into a polypoid animal\r\ncalled the _Strobila_. This _Strobila_ lives as the polype does, and, like\r\nit, multiplies rapidly by gemmation. After a great number of individuals\r\nhas been thus produced, and when, as we must suppose, the germinal capacity\r\nis approaching exhaustion, each _Strobila_ begins to exhibit a series of\r\nconstrictions, giving it some resemblance to a rouleau of coin or a pile of\r\nsaucers. These constrictions deepen; the segments gradually develop\r\ntentacula; the terminal segment finally separates itself, and swims away in\r\nthe form of a young _Medusa_; the other segments, in succession, do the\r\nsame; and from the eggs which these _Medusæ_ produce, other like series of\r\npolypoid animals, multiplying by gemmation, originate. In the compound\r\nPolypes, in the _Tunicata_, in the _Trematoda_, and in the Aphis, we find\r\nrepeated, under various modifications, the same phenomenon.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding then, this lowest and most rapid mode of multiplication to\r\nconsist essentially in the production of a great number of individuals from\r\na single germ--perceiving, further, that diminished activity of this mode\r\nof multiplication consists essentially in the aggregation of the\r\ngerm-product into larger masses--and seeing, lastly, that the disappearance\r\nof this mode of multiplication consists essentially in the aggregation of\r\nthe germ-product into _one_ mass--we shall be in a position to comprehend,\r\namongst the higher animals, that new aspect of the law, under which\r\nincreased individuation still involves diminished reproduction. Progressing\r\nfrom those lowest forms of life in which a single ovum originates countless\r\norganisms, through the successive stages in which the number of organisms\r\nso originated becomes smaller and smaller; and finally arriving at a stage\r\nin which one ovum produces but one organism; we have now, in our further\r\nascent, to observe the modified mode in which this same necessary\r\nantagonism between the ability to multiply, and the ability to preserve\r\nindividual life, is exhibited.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 11. Throughout both the animal and vegetable kingdoms, generation is\r\neffected \"by the union of the contents of a 'sperm-cell' with those of a\r\n'germ-cell;' the latter being that from within which the embryo is evolved,\r\nwhilst the former supplies some material or influence necessary to its\r\nevolution.\"[91] Amongst the lowest vegetable organisms, as in the\r\n_Desmideæ_, the _Diatomaceæ_, and other families of the inferior _Algæ_,\r\nthose cells do not appreciably differ; and the application to them of the\r\nterms \"sperm-cell\" and \"germ-cell\" is hypothetical. From this point\r\nupwards, however, distinctions become visible. As we advance to higher and\r\nhigher types of structure, marked differences arise in the character of\r\nthese cells, in the organs evolving them, and in the position of these\r\norgans, which are finally located in separate sexes. Doubtless a separation\r\nin the _functions_ of \"sperm-cell\" and \"germ-cell\" has simultaneously\r\narisen. That change from homogeneity of function to heterogeneity of\r\nfunction which essentially constitutes progress in organization may be\r\nassumed to take place here also; and, indeed, it is probable that the\r\ndistinction gradually established between these cells, in origin and\r\nappearance, is merely significant of, and consequent upon, the distinction\r\nthat has arisen between them in constitution and office. Let us now inquire\r\nin what this distinction consists.\r\n\r\nIf the foundation of every new organism be laid by the combination of two\r\nelements, we may reasonably suspect that these two elements are typical of\r\nsome two fundamental divisions of which the new organism is to consist. As\r\nnothing in nature is without meaning and purpose, we may be sure that the\r\nuniversality of this binary origin, signifies the universality of a binary\r\nstructure. The simplest and broadest division of which an organism is\r\ncapable must be that signified. What, then, must this division be?\r\n\r\nThe proposed definition of organic life supplies an answer. If organic life\r\nbe the co-ordination of actions, then an organism may be primarily divided\r\ninto parts whose actions are co-ordinated, and parts which co-ordinate\r\nthem--organs which are made to work in concert, and the apparatus which\r\nmakes them so work--or, in other words, the assimilative, vascular,\r\nexcretory, and muscular systems on the one hand, and the nervous system on\r\nthe other. The justness of this classification will become further\r\napparent, when it is remembered that by the nervous system alone is the\r\nindividuality established. By it all parts are made one in purpose, instead\r\nof separate; by it the organism is rendered a conscious whole--is enabled\r\nto recognise its own extent and limits; and by it are all injuries\r\nnotified, repairs directed, and the general conservation secured. The more\r\nthe nervous system is developed, the more reciprocally subservient do the\r\ncomponents of the body become--the less can they bear separating. And that\r\nwhich thus individuates many parts into one whole, must be considered as\r\nmore broadly distinguished from the parts individuated, than any of these\r\nparts from each other. Further evidence in support of this position may be\r\ndrawn from the fact, that as we ascend in the scale of animal life, that\r\nis, as the co-ordination of actions becomes greater, we find the\r\nco-ordinating or nervous system becoming more and more definitely separated\r\nfrom the rest; and in the vertebrate or highest type of structure we find\r\nthe division above insisted on distinctly marked. The co-ordinating parts\r\nand the parts co-ordinated are placed on opposite sides of the vertebral\r\ncolumn. With the exception of a few ganglia, the whole of the nervous\r\nmasses are contained within the neural arches of the vertebræ; whilst all\r\nthe viscera and limbs are contained within, or appended to, the hæmal\r\narches--the terms neural and hæmal having, indeed, been chosen to express\r\nthis fundamental division.\r\n\r\nIf, then, there be truth in the assumption that the two elements, which, by\r\ntheir union, give origin to a new organism, typify the two essential\r\nconstituents of such new organism, we must infer that the sperm-cell and\r\ngerm-cell respectively consist of co-ordinating matter and matter to be\r\nco-ordinated--neurine and nutriment. That apparent identity of sperm-cell\r\nand germ-cell seen in the lowest forms of life may thus be understood as\r\nsignificant to the fact that no extended co-ordination of actions exists in\r\nthe generative product--each cell being a separate individual; and the\r\ndissimilarity seen in higher organic types may, conversely, be understood\r\nas expressive of, and consequent upon, the increasing degree of\r\nco-ordination exhibited.[92]\r\n\r\nThat the sperm-cell and germ-cell are thus contrasted in nature and\r\nfunction may further be suspected on considering the distinctive\r\ncharacteristics of the sexes. Of the two elements they respectively\r\ncontribute to the formation of a fertile germ, it may be reasonably\r\nsupposed that each furnishes that which it possesses in greatest abundance\r\nand can best spare. Well, in the greater size of the nervous centres in the\r\nmale, as well as in the fact that during famines men succumb sooner than\r\nwomen, we see that in the male the co-ordinating system is relatively\r\npredominant. From the same evidence, as well as from the greater abundance\r\nof the cellular and adipose tissues in women, we may infer that the\r\nnutritive system predominates in the female.[93] Here, then, is additional\r\nsupport for the hypothesis that the sperm-cell, which is supplied by the\r\nmale, contains co-ordinating matter, and the germ-cell, which is supplied\r\nby the female, contains matter to be co-ordinated.\r\n\r\nThe same inference may, again, be drawn from a general view of the maternal\r\nfunction. For if, as we see, it is the office of the mother to afford milk\r\nto the infant, and during a previous period to afford blood to the foetus,\r\nit becomes probable that during a yet earlier stage it is still the\r\nfunction to supply nutriment, though in another form. Indeed when,\r\nascending gradually the scale of animal life, we perceive that this\r\nsupplying of milk, and before that of blood, is simply a continuation of\r\nthe previous process, we may be sure that, with Nature's usual consistency,\r\nthis process is essentially one from the beginning.\r\n\r\nQuite in harmony with this hypothesis concerning the respective natures of\r\nthe sperm-cell and germ-cell is a remark of Carpenter's on the same\r\npoint:--\r\n\r\n  \"Looking,\" he says, \"to the very equal mode in which the characters of\r\n  the two parents are mingled in _hybrid_ offspring, and to the certainty\r\n  that the _material_ conditions which determine the development of the\r\n  germ are almost exclusively female, it would seem probable that the\r\n  _dynamical_ conditions are, in great part, furnished by the male.\"[94]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 12. Could nothing but the foregoing indirect evidence be adduced in proof\r\nof the proposition that the spermatozoon is essentially a neural element,\r\nand the ovum essentially a hæmal element, we should scarcely claim for it\r\nanything more than plausibility. On finding, however, that this indirect\r\nevidence is merely introductory to evidence of a quite direct nature, its\r\nsignificance will become apparent. Adding to their weight taken separately\r\nthe force of their mutual confirmation, these two series of proofs will be\r\nseen to give the hypothesis a high degree of probability. The direct\r\nevidence now to be considered is of several kinds.\r\n\r\nOn referring to the description of the process of multiplication in monads,\r\nquoted some pages back (§ 5), from Professor Owen, the reader will perceive\r\nthat it is by the pellucid nucleus that the growth and reproduction of\r\nthese single-celled creatures are regulated. The nucleus controls the\r\ncirculation of the plasmatic fluid; the fission of the nucleus is the first\r\nstep towards the formation of another cell; each half of the divided\r\nnucleus establishes round itself an independent current; and, apparently,\r\nit is by the repulsion of the nuclei that the separation into two\r\nindividuals is finally effected. All which facts, when generalised, imply\r\nthat the nucleus is the governing or _co-ordinating_ part. Now, Professor\r\nOwen subsequently points out that the matter of the sperm-cell performs in\r\nthe fertilised germ-cell just this same function which the nucleus performs\r\nin a single-celled animal. We find the absorption by a germ-cell of the\r\ncontents of a sperm-cell \"followed by the appearance of a pellucid nucleus\r\nin the centre of the opaque and altered germ-cell; we further see its\r\nsuccessive fissions governed by the preliminary division of the pellucid\r\ncentre;\" and, led by these and other facts, Professor Owen thinks that \"one\r\ncannot reasonably suppose that the nature and properties of the nucleus of\r\nthe impregnated germ-cell and that of the monad can be different.\"[95] And\r\nhence he further infers that \"the nucleus of the monad is of a nature\r\nsimilar to, if not identical with,\" the matter of the spermatozoon. But we\r\nhave seen that in the monad the nucleus is the co-ordinating part; and\r\nhence to say that the sperm-cell is, in nature, identical with it, is to\r\nsay that the sperm-cell consists of co-ordinating matter.\r\n\r\nChemical analysis affords further evidence, though, from the imperfect data\r\nat present obtained, less conclusive evidence than could be wished. Partly\r\nfrom the white and gray nervous substances having been analysed together\r\ninstead of separately, and partly from the difficulty of isolating the\r\nefficient contents of the sperm-cells, a satisfactory comparison cannot be\r\nmade. Nevertheless, possessing in common, as they do, one element, by which\r\nthey are specially characterised, the analysis, as far as it goes, supports\r\nour argument. The following table, which has been made up from data given\r\nin the _Cyclopædia of Anatomy and Physiology, Art._ NERVOUS SYSTEM, gives\r\nthe proportion of this element in the brain in different conditions, and\r\nshows how important is its presence.\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------+--------+-------+-------+--------+-------+\r\n  |                             |  In    |  In   |  In   |  In    |  In   |\r\n  |                             |Infants.| Youth.|Adults.|Old Men.|Idiots.|\r\n  |                             +--------+-------+-------+--------+-------+\r\n  | Solid constituents in a     |        |       |       |        |       |\r\n  |  hundred parts of the brain | 17.21  | 25.74 | 27.49 | 26.15  | 29.07 |\r\n  | Of these solid constituents |        |       |       |        |       |\r\n  |  the phosphorus amounts to  |  0.8   |  1.65 |  1.80 |  1.00  |  0.85 |\r\n  | Which gives a percentage of |        |       |       |        |       |\r\n  |  phosphorus in the solid    |        |       |       |        |       |\r\n  |  constituents of            |  4.65  |  6.41 |  6.54 |  3.82  |  2.92 |\r\n  +-----------------------------+--------+-------+-------+--------+-------+\r\n\r\nThis connection between the quantity of phosphorus present and the degree\r\nof mental power exhibited, is sufficiently significant; and the fact that\r\nin the same individual the varying degrees of cerebral activity are\r\nindicated by the varying quantities of alkaline phosphates excreted by the\r\nkidneys,[96] still more clearly shows the essentialness of phosphorus as a\r\nconstituent of nervous matter. Respecting the constitution of sperm-cells\r\nchemists do not altogether agree. One thing, however, is certain--that they\r\ncontain unoxidized phosphorus; and also a fatty acid, that is not\r\nimprobably similar to the fatty acid contained in neurine.[97] In fact,\r\nthere would seem to be present the constituents of that oleophosphoric acid\r\nwhich forms so distinctive an element of the brain. That a large quantity\r\nof binoxide of protein is also present, may be ascribed to the fact that a\r\ngreat part of the sperm-cell consists merely of the protective membrane and\r\nits locomotive appendage; the really efficient portion being but the\r\ncentral contents.[98]\r\n\r\nEvidence of a more conclusive nature--evidence, too, which will show in\r\nwhat direction our argument tends--is seen in the marked antagonism of the\r\nnervous and generative systems. Thus, the fact that intense mental\r\napplication, involving great waste of the nervous tissues, and a\r\ncorresponding consumption of nervous matter for their repair, is\r\naccompanied by a cessation in the production of sperm-cells, gives strong\r\nsupport to the hypothesis that the sperm-cells consist essentially of\r\nneurine. And this becomes yet clearer on finding that the converse fact is\r\ntrue--that undue production of sperm-cells involves cerebral inactivity.\r\nThe first result of a morbid excess in this direction is headache, which\r\nmay be taken to indicate that the brain is out of repair; this is followed\r\nby stupidity; should the disorder continue, imbecility supervenes, ending\r\noccasionally in insanity.\r\n\r\nThat the sperm-cell is co-ordinating matter, and the germ-cell matter to be\r\nco-ordinated, is, therefore, an hypothesis not only having much _à priori_\r\nprobability, but one supported by numerous facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 13. This hypothesis alike explains, and is confirmed by, the truth, that\r\nthroughout the vertebrate tribes the degree of fertility varies inversely\r\nas the development of the nervous system.\r\n\r\nThe necessary antagonism of Individuation and Reproduction does indeed show\r\nitself amongst the higher animals, in some degree in the manner hitherto\r\ntraced; namely, as determining the total bulk. Though the parts now thrown\r\noff, being no longer segments or gemmæ, are not obvious diminutions of the\r\nparent, yet they must be really such. Under the form of internal fission,\r\nthe separative tendency is as much opposed to the aggregative tendency as\r\never; and, _other things equal_, the greater or less development of the\r\nindividual depends upon the less or greater production of new individuals\r\nor germs of new individuals. As in groups of cells, and series of groups of\r\ncells, we saw that there was in each species a limit, passing which, the\r\ngerm product would not remain united; so in each species of higher animal\r\nthere is a limit, passing which, the process of cell-multiplication results\r\nin the throwing off of cells, instead of resulting in the formation of more\r\ntissue. Hence, taking an average view, we see why the smaller animals so\r\nsoon arrive at a reproductive age, and produce large and frequent broods;\r\nand why, conversely, increased size is accompanied by retarded and\r\ndiminished fertility.\r\n\r\nBut, as above implied, it is not so much to the bulk of the body as a\r\nwhole, as to the bulk of the nervous system, that fertility stands related\r\namongst the higher animals. Probably, indeed, it stands thus related in all\r\ncases; the difference simply arising from the fact, that whereas in the\r\nlower organisms, where the nervous system is not concentrated, its bulk\r\nvaries as the bulk of the body, in the higher organisms it does not do so.\r\nBe this as it may, however, we see clearly that, amongst the vertebrata,\r\nthe bodily development is not the determining circumstance. In a fish, a\r\nreptile, a bird, and a mammal of the same weight, there is nothing like\r\nequality of fecundity. Cattle and horses, arriving as they do so soon at a\r\nreproductive age, are much more prolific than the human race, at the same\r\ntime that they are much larger. And whilst, again, the difference in size\r\nbetween the elephant and man is far greater, their respective powers of\r\nmultiplication are less unlike. Looking in these cases at the nervous\r\nsystems, however, we find no such discrepancy. On learning that the average\r\nratio of the brain to the body is--in fishes, 1 to 5668; in reptiles, 1 to\r\n1321; in birds, 1 to 212; and in mammals, 1 to 186;[99] their different\r\ndegrees of fecundity are accounted for. Though an ox will outweigh\r\nhalf-a-dozen men, yet its brain and spinal cord are far less than those of\r\none man; and though in bodily development the elephant so immensely exceeds\r\nthe human being, yet the elephant's cerebro-spinal system is only thrice\r\nthe size attained by that of civilized men.[100] Unfortunately, it is\r\nimpossible to trace throughout the animal kingdom this inverse relationship\r\nbetween the nervous and reproductive systems with any accuracy. Partly from\r\nthe fact that, in each case, the degree of fertility depends on three\r\nvariable elements--the age at which reproduction begins, the number\r\nproduced at a birth, and the frequency of the births; partly from the fact\r\nthat, in respect to most animals, these data are not satisfactorily\r\nattainable, and that, when they are attainable, they are vitiated by the\r\ninfluence of domesticity; and partly from the fact that no precise\r\nmeasurement of the respective nervous systems has been made, we are unable\r\nto draw any but general and somewhat vague comparisons. These, however, as\r\nfar as they go, are in our favour. Ascending from beings of the acrite\r\nnerveless type, which are the most prolific of all, through the various\r\ninvertebrate sub-kingdoms, amongst which spontaneous fission disappears as\r\nthe nervous system becomes developed; passing again to the least nervous\r\nand most fertile of the vertebrate series--Fishes, of which, too, the\r\ncomparatively large-brained cartilaginous kinds multiply much less rapidly\r\nthan the others; progressing through the more highly endowed and less\r\nprolific Reptiles to the Mammalia, amongst which the Rodents, with their\r\nunconvoluted brains, are noted for their fecundity; and ending with man and\r\nthe elephant, the least fertile and largest-brained of all--there seems to\r\nbe throughout a constant relationship between these attributes.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, on turning back to our _à priori_ principle, no other\r\nrelationship appears possible. We found it to be the necessary law of\r\nmaintenance of races, that the ability to maintain individual life and the\r\nability to multiply vary inversely. But the ability to maintain individual\r\nlife _is in all cases measured by the development of the nervous system_.\r\nIf it be in good visceral organization that the power of self-preservation\r\nis shown, this implies some corresponding nervous apparatus to secure\r\nsufficient food. If it be in strength, there must be a provision of nerves\r\nand nervous centres answering to the number and size of the muscles. If it\r\nbe in swiftness and agility, a proportionate development of the cerebellum\r\nis presupposed. If it be in intelligence, this varies with the size of the\r\ncerebrum. As in all cases co-ordination of actions constitutes the life,\r\nor, what is the same thing, the ability to maintain life; and as throughout\r\nthe animal kingdom this co-ordination, under all its forms, is effected by\r\nnervous agents of some kind or other; and as each of these nervous agents\r\nperforms but one function; it follows that in proportion to the number of\r\nthe actions co-ordinated must be the number of nervous agents. Hence the\r\nnervous system becomes the universal measure of the degree of co-ordination\r\nof actions; that is, of the life, or ability to maintain life. And if the\r\nnervous system varies directly as the ability to maintain life, it _must_\r\nvary inversely as the ability to multiply.[101]\r\n\r\nAnd here, assuming the constitution of the sperm-cell above inferred to be\r\nthe true one, we see how the obverse _à priori_ principle is fulfilled.\r\nWhere, as amongst the lowest organisms, bulk is expressive of life, the\r\nantagonism of individuation and reproduction was broadly exhibited in the\r\nfact that the making of two or more new individuals was the _un_making of\r\nthe original individual. And now, amongst the higher organisms, where bulk\r\nis no longer the measure of life, we see that this antagonism is between\r\nthe neural elements thrown off, and that internal neural mass whose bulk\r\n_is_ the measure of life. The production of co-ordinating cells must be at\r\nthe expense of the co-ordinating apparatus; and the aggregation of the\r\nco-ordinating apparatus must be at the expense of co-ordinating cells. How\r\nthe antagonism affects the female economy is not so clear. Possibly the\r\nprovision required to be made for supplying nervous as well as other\r\nnutriment to the embryo, involves an arrest in the development of the\r\nnervous system; and if so, probably this arrest takes place early in\r\nproportion as the number of the coming offspring makes the required\r\nprovision great: or rather, to put the facts in their right sequence, an\r\nearly arrest renders the production of a numerous offspring possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 14. The law which we have thus traced throughout the animal kingdom, and\r\nwhich must alike determine the different fertilities of different species,\r\nand the variations of fertility in the same species, we have now to\r\nconsider in its application to mankind.\r\n\r\n  [_The remainder of the essay, which as implied, deals with the\r\n  application of this general principle to the multiplication of the human\r\n  race, need not be here reproduced.

The first\r\nappeared under the above title in February and March, 1893; the second in\r\nMay of that year under the title \"Prof. Weismann's Theories;\" the third in\r\nDecember of that year under the title \"A Rejoinder to Prof. Weismann;\" and\r\nthe fourth in October, 1894, under the title \"Weismannism Once More.\" As\r\nthese successive essays practically form parts of one whole, I have thought\r\nit needless to keep them separate by repeating their titles, and have\r\nsimply marked them off from one another by the numbers I, II, III, IV. Of\r\ncourse, as they are components of a controversy, some incompleteness arises\r\nfrom the absence of the essays to which portions of them were replies; but\r\nin each the course of the argument sufficiently indicates the\r\ncounter-arguments which were met._]\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nStudents of psychology are familiar with the experiments of Weber on the\r\nsense of touch. He found that different parts of the surface differ widely\r\nin their ability to give information concerning the things touched. Some\r\nparts, which yielded vivid sensations, yielded little or no knowledge of\r\nthe sizes or forms of the things exciting them; whereas other parts, from\r\nwhich there came sensations much less acute, furnished clear impressions\r\nrespecting the tangible characters, even of relatively small objects. These\r\nunlikenesses of tactual discriminativeness he ingeniously expressed by\r\nactual measurements. Taking a pair of compasses, he found that if they were\r\nclosed so nearly that the points were less than one-twelfth of an inch\r\napart, the end of the forefinger could not perceive that there were two\r\npoints: the two points seemed one. But when the compasses were opened so\r\nthat the points were one-twelfth of an inch apart, then the end of the\r\nforefinger distinguished the two points. At the same time, he found that\r\nthe compasses must be opened to the extent of two and a half inches, before\r\nthe middle of the back could distinguish between two points and one. That\r\nis to say, as thus measured, the end of the forefinger has thirty times the\r\ntactual discriminativeness which the middle of the back has.\r\n\r\nBetween these extremes he found gradations. The inner surfaces of the\r\nsecond joints of the fingers can distinguish separateness of positions only\r\nhalf as well as the tip of the forefinger. The innermost joints are still\r\nless discriminating, but have powers of discrimination equal to that of the\r\ntip of the nose. The end of the great toe, the palm of the hand, and the\r\ncheek, have alike one-fifth of the perceptiveness which the tip of the\r\nforefinger has; and the lower part of the forehead has but one-half that\r\npossessed by the cheek. The back of the hand and the crown of the head are\r\nnearly alike in having but a fourteenth or a fifteenth of the ability to\r\nperceive positions as distinct, which is possessed by the finger-end. The\r\nthigh, near the knee, has rather less, and the breast less still; so that\r\nthe compasses must be opened more than an inch and a half before the breast\r\ndistinguishes the two points from one another.\r\n\r\nWhat is the meaning of these differences? How, in the course of evolution,\r\nhave they been established? If \"natural selection,\" or survival of the\r\nfittest, is the assigned cause, then it is required to show in what way\r\neach of these degrees of endowment has advantaged the possessor to such\r\nextent that not infrequently life has been directly or indirectly preserved\r\nby it. We might reasonably assume that in the absence of some\r\ndifferentiating process, all parts of the surface would have like powers of\r\nperceiving relative positions. They cannot have become widely unlike in\r\nperceptiveness without some cause. And if the cause alleged is natural\r\nselection, then it is necessary to show that the greater degree of the\r\npower possessed by this part than by that, has not only conduced to the\r\nmaintenance of life, but has conduced so much that an individual in whom a\r\nvariation has produced better adjustment to needs, thereby maintained life\r\nwhen some others lost it; and that among the descendants inheriting this\r\nvariation, there was a derived advantage such as enabled them to multiply\r\nmore than the descendants of individuals not possessing it. Can this, or\r\nanything like this, be shown?\r\n\r\nThat the superior perceptiveness of the forefinger-tip has thus arisen,\r\nmight be contended with some apparent reason. Such perceptiveness is an\r\nimportant aid to manipulation, and may have sometimes given a life-saving\r\nadvantage. In making arrows or fish-hooks, a savage possessing some extra\r\namount of it may have been thereby enabled to get food where another\r\nfailed. In civilized life, too, a sempstress with well-endowed finger-ends\r\nmight be expected to gain a better livelihood than one with finger-ends\r\nwhich were obtuse; though this advantage would not be so great as appears.\r\nI have found that two ladies whose finger-ends were covered with\r\nglove-tips, reducing their sensitiveness from one-twelfth of an inch\r\nbetween compass-points to one-seventh, lost nothing appreciable of their\r\nquickness and goodness in sewing. An experience of my own here comes in\r\nevidence. Towards the close of my salmon-fishing days I used to observe\r\nwhat a bungler I had become in putting on and taking off artificial flies.\r\nAs the tactual discriminativeness of my finger-ends, recently tested, comes\r\nup to the standard specified by Weber, it is clear that this decrease of\r\nmanipulative power, accompanying increase of age, was due to decrease in\r\nthe delicacy of muscular co-ordination and sense of pressure--not to\r\ndecrease of tactual discriminativeness. But not making much of these\r\ncriticisms, let us admit the conclusion that this high perceptive power\r\npossessed by the forefinger-end may have arisen by survival of the fittest;\r\nand let us limit the argument to the other differences.\r\n\r\nHow about the back of the trunk and its face? Is any advantage derived from\r\npossession of greater tactual discriminativeness by the last than the\r\nfirst? The tip of the nose has more than three times the power of\r\ndistinguishing relative positions which the lower part of the forehead has.\r\nCan this greater power be shown to have any advantage? The back of the hand\r\nhas scarcely more discriminative ability than the crown of the head, and\r\nhas only one-fourteenth of that which the finger-tip has. Why is this?\r\nAdvantage might occasionally be derived if the back of the hand could tell\r\nus more than it does about the shapes of the surfaces touched. Why should\r\nthe thigh near the knee be twice as perceptive as the middle of the thigh?\r\nAnd, last of all, why should the middle of the forearm, middle of the\r\nthigh, middle of the back of the neck, and middle of the back, all stand on\r\nthe lowest level, as having but one-thirtieth of the perceptive power which\r\nthe tip of the forefinger has? To prove that these differences have arisen\r\nby natural selection, it has to be shown that such small variation in one\r\nof the parts as might occur in a generation--say one-tenth extra\r\namount--has yielded an appreciably greater power of self-preservation; and\r\nthat those inheriting it have continued to be so far advantaged as to\r\nmultiply more than those who, in other respects equal, were less endowed\r\nwith this trait. Does any one think he can show this?\r\n\r\nBut if this distribution of tactual perceptiveness cannot be explained by\r\nsurvival of the fittest, how can it be explained? The reply is that, if\r\nthere has been in operation a cause which it is now the fashion among\r\nbiologists to ignore or deny, these various differences are at once\r\naccounted for. This cause is the inheritance of acquired characters. As a\r\npreliminary to setting forth the argument showing this, I have made some\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nIt is a current belief that the fingers of the blind, more practised in\r\ntactual exploration than the fingers of those who can see, acquire greater\r\ndiscriminativeness: especially the fingers of those blind who have been\r\ntaught to read from raised letters. Not wishing to trust to this current\r\nbelief, I recently tested two youths, one of fifteen and the other younger,\r\nat the School for the Blind in Upper Avenue Road, and found the belief to\r\nbe correct. I found that instead of being unable to distinguish between\r\npoints of the compasses until they were opened to one-twelfth of an inch\r\napart, both of them could distinguish between points when only\r\none-fourteenth of an inch apart. They had thick and coarse skins; and\r\ndoubtless, had the intervening obstacle, so produced, been less, the\r\ndiscriminative power would have been greater. It afterwards occurred to me\r\nthat a better test would be furnished by those whose finger-ends are\r\nexercised in tactual perceptions, not occasionally, as by the blind in\r\nreading, but all day long in pursuit of their occupations. The facts\r\nanswered expectation. Two skilled compositors, on whom I experimented, were\r\nboth able to distinguish between points when they were only one-seventeenth\r\nof an inch apart. Thus we have clear proof that constant exercise of the\r\ntactual nervous structure leads to further development.[102]\r\n\r\nNow if acquired structural traits are inheritable, the various contrasts\r\nabove set down are obvious consequences; for the gradations in tactual\r\nperceptiveness correspond with the gradations in the tactual exercises of\r\nthe parts. Save by contact with clothes, which present only broad surfaces\r\nhaving but slight and indefinite contrast, the trunk has scarcely any\r\nconverse with external bodies, and it has but small discriminative power;\r\nbut what discriminative power it has is greater on its face than on its\r\nback, corresponding to the fact that the chest and abdomen are much more\r\nfrequently explored by the hands: this difference being probably in part\r\ninherited from inferior creatures; for, as we may see in dogs and cats, the\r\nbelly is far more accessible to feet and tongue than the back. No less\r\nobtuse than the back are the middle of the back of the neck, the middle of\r\nthe forearm, and the middle of the thigh; and these parts have but rare\r\nexperiences of irregular foreign bodies. The crown of the head is\r\noccasionally felt by the fingers, as also the back of one hand by the\r\nfingers of the other; but neither of these surfaces, which are only twice\r\nas perceptive as the back, is used with any frequency for touching objects,\r\nmuch less for examining them. The lower part of the forehead, though more\r\nperceptive than the crown of the head, in correspondence with a somewhat\r\ngreater converse with the hands, is less than one-third as perceptive as\r\nthe tip of the nose; and manifestly, both in virtue of its relative\r\nprominence, in virtue of its contacts with things smelt at, and in virtue\r\nof its frequent acquaintance with the handkerchief, the tip of the nose has\r\nfar greater tactual experience. Passing to the inner surfaces of the hands,\r\nwhich, taken as wholes, are more constantly occupied in touching than are\r\nthe back, breast, thigh, forearm, forehead, or back of the hand, Weber's\r\nscale shows that they are much more perceptive, and that the degrees of\r\nperceptiveness of different parts correspond with their tactual activities.\r\nThe palms have but one-fifth the perceptiveness possessed by the\r\nforefinger-ends; the inner surfaces of the finger-joints next the palms\r\nhave but one-third; while the inner surfaces of the second joints have but\r\none-half. These abilities correspond with the facts that whereas the inner\r\nparts of the hand are used only in grasping things, the tips of the fingers\r\ncome into play not only when things are grasped, but when such things, as\r\nwell as smaller things, are felt at or manipulated. It needs but to observe\r\nthe relative actions of these parts in writing, in sewing, in judging\r\ntextures, &c., to see that above all other parts the finger-ends, and\r\nespecially the forefinger-ends, have the most multiplied experiences. If,\r\nthen, it be that the extra perceptiveness acquired from actual tactual\r\nactivities, as in a compositor, is inheritable, these gradations of tactual\r\nperceptiveness are explained.\r\n\r\nDoubtless some of those who remember Weber's results, have had on the tip\r\nof the tongue the argument derived from the tip of the tongue. This part\r\nexceeds all other parts in power of tactual discrimination: doubling, in\r\nthat respect, the power of the forefinger-tip. It can distinguish points\r\nthat are only one-twenty-fourth of an inch apart. Why this unparalleled\r\nperceptiveness? If survival of the fittest be the ascribed cause, then it\r\nhas to be shown what the advantages achieved have been; and, further, that\r\nthose advantages have been sufficiently great to have had effects on the\r\nmaintenance of life.\r\n\r\nBesides tasting, there are two functions conducive to life, which the\r\ntongue performs. It enables us to move about food during mastication, and\r\nit enables us to make many of the articulations constituting speech. But\r\nhow does the extreme discriminativeness of the tongue-tip aid these\r\nfunctions? The food is moved about, not by the tongue-tip, but by the body\r\nof the tongue; and even were the tip largely employed in this process, it\r\nwould still have to be shown that its ability to distinguish between points\r\none-twenty-fourth of an inch apart, is of service to that end, which cannot\r\nbe shown. It may, indeed, be said that the tactual perceptiveness of the\r\ntongue-tip serves for detection of foreign bodies in the food, as\r\nplum-stones or as fish-bones. But such extreme perceptiveness is needless\r\nfor the purpose. A perceptiveness equal to that of the finger-ends would\r\nsuffice. And further, even were such extreme perceptiveness useful, it\r\ncould not have caused survival of individuals who possessed it in slightly\r\nhigher degrees than others. It needs but to observe a dog crunching small\r\nbones, and swallowing with impunity the sharp-angled pieces, to see that\r\nbut a very small amount of mortality would be prevented.\r\n\r\nBut what about speech? Well, neither here can there be shown any advantage\r\nderived from this extreme perceptiveness. For making the _s_ and _z_, the\r\ntongue has to be partially applied to a portion of the palate next the\r\nteeth. Not only, however, must the contact be incomplete, but its place is\r\nindefinite--may be half an inch further back. To make the _sh_ and _zh_,\r\nthe contact has to be made, not with the tip, but with the upper surface of\r\nthe tongue; and must be an incomplete contact. Though, for making the\r\nliquids, the tip of the tongue and the sides of the tongue are used, yet\r\nthe requisite is not any exact adjustment of the tip, but an imperfect\r\ncontact with the palate. For the _th_, the tip is used along with the edges\r\nof the tongue; but no perfect adjustment is required, either to the edges\r\nof the teeth, or to the junction of the teeth with the palate, where the\r\nsound may equally well be made. Though for the _t_ and _d_ complete contact\r\nof the tip and edges of the tongue with the palate is required, yet the\r\nplace of contact is not definite, and the tip takes no more important share\r\nin the action than the sides. Any one who observes the movements of his\r\ntongue in speaking, will find that there occur no cases in which the\r\nadjustments must have an exactness corresponding to the extreme power of\r\ndiscrimination which the tip possesses: for speech, this endowment is\r\nuseless. Even were it useful, it could not be shown that it has been\r\ndeveloped by survival of the fittest; for though perfect articulation is an\r\naid, yet imperfect articulation has rarely such an effect as to impede a\r\nman in the maintenance of his life. If he is a good workman, a German's\r\ninterchanges of _b's_ and _p's_ do not disadvantage him. A Frenchman who,\r\nin place of the sound of _th_, always makes the sound of _z_, succeeds as a\r\nteacher of music or dancing, no less than if he achieved the English\r\npronunciation. Nay, even such an imperfection of speech as that which\r\narises from cleft palate, does not prevent a man from getting on if he is\r\ncapable. True, it may go against him as a candidate for Parliament, or as\r\nan \"orator\" of the unemployed (mostly not worth employing). But in the\r\nstruggle for life he is not hindered by the effect to the extent of being\r\nless able than others to maintain himself and his offspring. Clearly, then,\r\neven if this unparalleled perceptiveness of the tongue-tip is required for\r\nperfect speech, such use is not sufficiently important to have been\r\ndeveloped by natural selection.\r\n\r\nHow, then, is this remarkable trait of the tongue-tip to be accounted for?\r\nWithout difficulty, if there is inheritance of acquired characters. For the\r\ntongue-tip has, above all other parts of the body, unceasing experiences of\r\nsmall irregularities of surface. It is in contact with the teeth, and\r\neither consciously or unconsciously is continually exploring them. There is\r\nhardly a moment in which impressions of adjacent but different positions\r\nare not being yielded to it by either the surfaces of the teeth or their\r\nedges; and it is continually being moved about from some of them to others.\r\nNo advantage is gained. It is simply that the tongue's position renders\r\nperpetual exploration almost inevitable; and by perpetual exploration is\r\ndeveloped this unique power of discrimination. Thus the law holds\r\nthroughout, from this highest degree of perceptiveness of the tongue-tip to\r\nits lowest degree on the back of the trunk; and no other explanation of the\r\nfacts seems possible.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there is another explanation,\" I hear some one say: \"they may be\r\nexplained by _panmixia_.\" Well, in the first place, as the explanation by\r\n_panmixia_ implies that these gradations of perceptiveness have been\r\narrived at by the dwindling of nervous structures, there lies at the basis\r\nof the explanation an unproved and improbable assumption; and, in the\r\nsecond place, even were there no such difficulty, it may with certainty be\r\ndenied that _panmixia_ can furnish an explanation. Let us look at its\r\npretensions.\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nIt was not without good reason that Bentham protested against metaphors.\r\nFigures of speech in general, valuable as they are in poetry and rhetoric,\r\ncannot be used without danger in science and philosophy. The title of Mr.\r\nDarwin's great work furnishes us with an instance of the misleading effects\r\nproduced by them. It runs:--_The Origin of Species by means of Natural\r\nSelection, or the Preservation of favoured Races in the Struggle for Life_.\r\nHere are two figures of speech which conspire to produce an impression more\r\nor less erroneous. The expression \"natural selection\" was chosen as serving\r\nto indicate some parallelism with artificial selection--the selection\r\nexercised by breeders. Now selection connotes volition, and thus gives to\r\nthe thoughts of readers a wrong bias. Some increase of this bias is\r\nproduced by the words in the second title, \"favoured races;\" for anything\r\nwhich is favoured implies the existence of some agent conferring a favour.\r\nI do not mean that Mr. Darwin himself failed to recognize the misleading\r\nconnotations of his words, or that he did not avoid being misled by them.\r\nIn chapter iv of the _Origin of Species_, he says that, considered\r\nliterally, \"natural selection is a false term,\" and that the\r\npersonification of Nature is objectionable; but he thinks that readers, and\r\nthose who adopt his views, will soon learn to guard themselves against the\r\nwrong implications. Here I venture to think that he was mistaken. For\r\nthinking this, there is the reason that even his disciple, Mr. Wallace--no,\r\nnot his disciple, but his co-discoverer, ever to be honoured--has\r\napparently been influenced by them. When, for example, in combating a view\r\nof mine, he says that \"the very thing said to be impossible by variation\r\nand natural selection has been again and again effected, by variation and\r\nartificial selection,\" he seems clearly to imply that the processes are\r\nanalogous, and operate in the same way. Now this is untrue. They are\r\nanalogous only within certain narrow limits; and, in the great majority of\r\ncases, natural selection is utterly incapable of doing that which\r\nartificial selection does.\r\n\r\nTo see this it needs only to de-personalise Nature, and to remember that,\r\nas Mr. Darwin says, Nature is \"only the aggregate action and product of\r\nmany natural laws [forces].\" Observe its relative shortcomings. Artificial\r\nselection can pick out a particular trait, and, regardless of other traits\r\nof the individuals displaying it, can increase it by selective breeding in\r\nsuccessive generations. For, to the breeder or fancier, it matters little\r\nwhether such individuals are otherwise well constituted. They may be in\r\nthis or that way so unfit for carrying on the struggle for life, that were\r\nthey without human care, they would disappear forthwith. On the other hand,\r\nif we regard Nature as that which it is, an assemblage of various forces,\r\ninorganic and organic, some favourable to the maintenance of life and many\r\nat variance with its maintenance--forces which operate blindly--we see that\r\nthere is no such selection of this or that trait; but that there is a\r\nselection only of individuals which are, by the aggregate of their traits,\r\nbest fitted for living. And here I may note an advantage possessed by the\r\nexpression \"survival of the fittest;\" since this does not tend to raise the\r\nthought of any one character which, more than others, is to be maintained\r\nor increased; but tends rather to raise the thought of a general adaptation\r\nfor all purposes. It implies the process which Nature can alone carry\r\non--the leaving alive of those which are best able to utilize surrounding\r\naids to life, and best able to combat or avoid surrounding dangers. And\r\nwhile this phrase covers the great mass of cases in which there are\r\npreserved well-constituted individuals, it also covers those special cases\r\nwhich are suggested by the phrase \"natural selection,\" in which individuals\r\nsucceed beyond others in the struggle for life, by the help of particular\r\ncharacters which conduce in important ways to prosperity and\r\nmultiplication. For now observe the fact which here chiefly concerns us,\r\nthat survival of the fittest can increase any serviceable trait, only if\r\nthat trait conduces to prosperity of the individual, or of posterity, or of\r\nboth, _in an important degree_. There can be no increase of any structure\r\nby natural selection unless, amid all the slightly varying structures\r\nconstituting the organism, increase of this particular one is so\r\nadvantageous as to cause greater multiplication of the family in which it\r\narises than of other families. Variations which, though advantageous, fail\r\nto do this, must disappear again. Let us take a case.\r\n\r\nKeenness of scent in a deer, by giving early notice of approaching enemies,\r\nsubserves life so greatly that, other things equal, an individual having it\r\nin an unusual degree is more likely than others to survive; and, among\r\ndescendants, to leave some similarly endowed or more endowed, who again\r\ntransmit the variation with, in some cases, increase. Clearly this highly\r\nuseful power may be developed by natural selection. So also, for like\r\nreasons, may quickness of vision and delicacy of hearing; though it may be\r\nremarked in passing that since this extra sense-endowment, serving to give\r\nearly alarm, profits the herd as a whole, which takes the alarm from one\r\nindividual, selection of it is not so easy, unless it occurs in a\r\nconquering stag. But now suppose that one member of the herd--perhaps\r\nbecause of more efficient teeth, perhaps by greater muscularity of stomach,\r\nperhaps by secretion of more appropriate gastric juices--is enabled to eat\r\nand digest a not uncommon plant which the others refuse. This peculiarity\r\nmay, if food is scarce, conduce to better self-maintenance, and better\r\nfostering of young if the individual is a hind. But unless this plant is\r\nabundant, and the advantage consequently great, the advantages which other\r\nmembers of the herd gain from other slight variations may be equivalent.\r\nThis one has unusual agility, and leaps a chasm which others balk at. That\r\none develops longer hair in winter, and resists the cold better. Another\r\nhas a skin less irritated by flies, and can graze without so much\r\ninterruption. Here is one which has an unusual power of detecting food\r\nunder the snow; and there is one which shows extra sagacity in the choice\r\nof a shelter from wind and rain. That the variation giving ability to eat a\r\nplant before unutilized, may become a trait of the herd, and eventually of\r\na variety, it is needful that the individual in which it occurs shall have\r\nmore descendants, or better descendants, or both, than have the various\r\nother individuals severally having their small superiorities. If these\r\nother individuals severally profit by their small superiorities, and\r\ntransmit them to equally large numbers of offspring, no increase of the\r\nvariation in question can take place: it must soon be cancelled. Whether in\r\nthe _Origin of Species_ Mr. Darwin has recognized this fact, I do not\r\nremember, but he has certainly done it by implication in his _Animals and\r\nPlants under Domestication_. Speaking of variations in domestic animals, he\r\nthere says that \"any particular variation would generally be lost by\r\ncrossing, reversion, and the accidental destruction of the varying\r\nindividuals, unless carefully preserved by man.\" (Vol. II, p. 292.) That\r\nwhich survival of the fittest does in cases like the one I have instanced,\r\nis to keep all faculties up to the mark, by destroying such individuals as\r\nhave faculties in some respect below the mark; and it can produce\r\ndevelopment of some one faculty only if that faculty is predominantly\r\nimportant. It seems to me that many naturalists have practically lost sight\r\nof this, and assume that natural selection will increase _any_ advantageous\r\ntrait. Certainly a view now held by some assumes as much.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of this view, to which the foregoing paragraph is\r\nintroductory, may now be entered upon. This view concerns, not direct\r\nselection, but what has been called, in questionable logic, \"reversed\r\nselection\"--the selection which effects, not increase of an organ, but\r\ndecrease of it. For as, under some conditions, it is of advantage to an\r\nindividual and its descendants to have some structure of larger size, it\r\nmay be, under other conditions--namely, when the organ becomes useless--of\r\nadvantage to have it of smaller size; since, even if it is not in the way,\r\nits weight and the cost of its nutrition are injurious taxes on the\r\norganism. But now comes the truth to be emphasized. Just as direct\r\nselection can increase an organ only in certain cases, so can reversed\r\nselection decrease it only in certain cases. Like the increase produced by\r\na variation, the decrease produced by one must be such as will sensibly\r\nconduce to preservation and multiplication. It is, for instance,\r\nconceivable that were the long and massive tail of the kangaroo to become\r\nuseless (say by the forcing of the species into a mountainous and rocky\r\nhabitat filled with brushwood), a variation which considerably reduced the\r\ntail might sensibly profit the individual in which it occurred; and, in\r\nseasons when food was scarce, might cause survival when individuals with\r\nlarge tails died. But the economy of nutrition must be considerable before\r\nany such result could occur. Suppose that in this new habitat the kangaroo\r\nhad no enemies; and suppose that, consequently, quickness of hearing not\r\nbeing called for, large ears gave no greater advantage than small ones.\r\nWould an individual with smaller ears than usual, survive and propagate\r\nbetter than other individuals, in consequence of the economy of nutrition\r\nachieved? To suppose this is to suppose that the saving of a grain or two\r\nof protein per day would determine the kangaroo's fate.\r\n\r\nLong ago I discussed this matter in the _Principles of Biology_ (§ 166),\r\ntaking as an instance the decrease of the jaw implied by the crowding of\r\nthe teeth, and now proved by measurement to have taken place. Here is the\r\npassage:--\r\n\r\n  \"No functional superiority possessed by a small jaw over a large jaw, in\r\n  civilized life, can be named as having caused the more frequent survival\r\n  of small-jawed individuals. The only advantage which smallness of jaw\r\n  might be supposed to give, is the advantage of economized nutrition; and\r\n  this could not be great enough to further the preservation of men\r\n  possessing it. The decrease of weight in the jaw and co-operative parts\r\n  that has arisen in the course of many thousands of years, does not amount\r\n  to more than a few ounces. This decrease has to be divided among the many\r\n  generations that have lived and died in the interval. Let us admit that\r\n  the weight of these parts diminished to the extent of an ounce in a\r\n  single generation (which is a large admission); it still cannot be\r\n  contended that the having to carry an ounce less in weight, or having to\r\n  keep in repair an ounce less of tissue, could sensibly affect any man's\r\n  fate. And if it never did this--nay, if it did not cause a _frequent_\r\n  survival of small-jawed individuals where large-jawed individuals died,\r\n  natural selection could neither cause nor aid diminution of the jaw and\r\n  its appendages.\"\r\n\r\nWhen writing this passage in 1864, I never dreamt that a quarter of a\r\ncentury later, the supposable cause of degeneration here examined and\r\nexcluded as impossible, would be enunciated as an actual cause and named\r\n\"reversed selection.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the arguments used to show the adequacy of natural selection under\r\nits direct or indirect form consists of a counter-argument to the effect\r\nthat inheritance of functionally-wrought changes, supposing it to be\r\noperative, does not explain certain of the facts. This is alleged by Prof.\r\nWeismann as a part justification for his doctrine of Panmixia. Concerning\r\nthe \"blind fish and amphibia\" found in dark places, which have but\r\nrudimentary eyes \"hidden under the skin,\" he argues that \"it is difficult\r\nto reconcile the facts of the case with the ordinary theory that the eyes\r\nof these animals have simply degenerated through disuse.\" After giving\r\ninstances of rapid degeneration of disused organs, he argues that if \"the\r\neffects of disuse are so striking in a single life, we should certainly\r\nexpect, if such effects can be transmitted, that all traces of an eye would\r\nsoon disappear from a species which lives in the dark.\" Doubtless this is a\r\nreasonable conclusion. To explain the facts on the hypothesis that acquired\r\ncharacters are inheritable, seems very difficult. One possible explanation\r\nmay, indeed, be named. It appears to be a general law of organization that\r\nstructures are stable in proportion to their antiquity--that while organs\r\nof relatively modern origin have but a comparatively superficial root in\r\nthe constitution, and readily disappear if the conditions do not favour\r\ntheir maintenance, organs of ancient origin have deep-seated roots in the\r\nconstitution, and do not readily disappear. Having been early elements in\r\nthe type, and having continued to be reproduced as parts of it during a\r\nperiod extending throughout many geological epochs, they are comparatively\r\npersistent. Now the eye answers to this description as being a very early\r\norgan. But waiving possible explanations, let us take the particular\r\ninstance cited by Prof. Weismann and see what is to be made of it. He\r\nwrites:--\r\n\r\n  \"The caverns in Carniola and Carinthia, in which the blind _Proteus_ and\r\n  so many other blind animals live, belong geologically to the Jurassic\r\n  formation; and although we do not exactly know when for example the\r\n  _Proteus_ first entered them, the low organization of this amphibian\r\n  certainly indicates that it has been sheltered there for a very long\r\n  period of time, and that thousands of generations of this species have\r\n  succeeded one another in the caves.\r\n\r\n  \"Hence there is no reason to wonder at the extent to which the\r\n  degeneration of the eye has been already carried in the _Proteus_; even\r\n  if we assume that it is merely due to the cessation of the conserving\r\n  influence of natural selection.\"[103]\r\n\r\nLet me first note a strange oversight on the part of Prof. Weismann. He\r\npoints out that the caverns in question belong to the Jurassic formation:\r\napparently intending to imply that they have an antiquity related to that\r\nof the formation. But there is no such relation, except that the caverns\r\ncannot be older than the formation. They may have originated at any period\r\nsince the containing strata were deposited; and they may be therefore\r\nrelatively modern. But passing over this, and admitting that the _Proteus_\r\nhas inhabited the caverns for an enormous period, what is to be said of the\r\nfact that their eyes have not disappeared entirely, as Prof. Weismann\r\ncontends they should have done had the inheritance of the effects of disuse\r\nbeen all along operative? There is a very sufficient answer--the\r\nrudimentary eyes are not entirely useless. It seems that when the\r\nunderground streams it inhabits are unusually swollen, some individuals of\r\nthe species are carried out of the caverns into the open (being then\r\nsometimes captured). It is also said that the creatures shun the light;\r\nthis trait being, I presume, observed when it is in captivity. Now\r\nobviously, among individuals carried out into the open, those which remain\r\nvisible are apt to be carried off by enemies; whereas, those which,\r\nappreciating the difference between light and darkness, shelter themselves\r\nin dark places, survive. Hence the tendency of natural selection is to\r\nprevent the decrease of the eyes beyond that point at which they can\r\ndistinguish between light and darkness. Thus the apparent anomaly is\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nLet me suggest, as another possible reason for persistence of rudimentary\r\norgans, that the principle of economy of growth will cause diminution of\r\nthem only in proportion as their constituents are of value for other uses\r\nin the organism; and that in many cases their constituents are practically\r\nvalueless. Hence probably the reason why, in the case of stalk-eyed\r\ncrustaceans, the eye is gone but the pedicle remains, or to use Mr.\r\nDarwin's simile, the telescope has disappeared but not its stand.\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nAlong with that inadequacy of natural selection to explain changes of\r\nstructure which do not aid life in important ways, alleged in § 166 of _The\r\nPrinciples of Biology_, a further inadequacy was alleged. It was contended\r\nthat the relative powers of co-operative parts cannot be adjusted solely by\r\nsurvival of the fittest; and especially where the parts are numerous and\r\nthe co-operation complex. In illustration it was pointed out that immensely\r\ndeveloped horns, such as those of the extinct Irish elk, weighing over a\r\nhundred-weight, could not, with the massive skull bearing them, be carried\r\nat the extremity of the outstretched neck without many and great\r\nmodifications of adjacent bones and muscles of the neck and thorax; and\r\nthat without strengthening of the fore-legs, too, there would be failure\r\nalike in fighting and in locomotion. And it was argued that while we cannot\r\nassume spontaneous increase of all these parts proportionate to the\r\nadditional strains, we cannot suppose them to increase by variations, one\r\nat once, without supposing the creature to be disadvantaged by the weight\r\nand nutrition of parts that were for the time useless--parts, moreover,\r\nwhich would revert to their original sizes before the other needful\r\nvariations occurred.\r\n\r\nWhen, in reply to me, it was contended that co-operative parts vary\r\ntogether, I named facts conflicting with this assertion--the fact that the\r\nblind cray-fish of the Kentucky caves have lost their eyes but not the\r\nfoot-stalks carrying them; the fact that the normal proportion between\r\ntongue and beak in certain selected varieties of pigeons is lost; the fact\r\nthat lack of concomitance in decrease of jaws and teeth in sundry kinds of\r\npet dogs, has caused great crowding of the teeth (\"The Factors of Organic\r\nEvolution,\" _Essays_, i, 401-402). And I then argued that if co-operative\r\nparts, small in number and so closely associated as these are, do not vary\r\ntogether, it is unwarrantable to allege that co-operative parts which are\r\nvery numerous and remote from one another vary together. After making this\r\nrejoinder I enforced my argument by a further example--that of the giraffe.\r\nTacitly recognizing the truth that the unusual structure of this creature\r\nmust have been, in its most conspicuous traits, the result of survival of\r\nthe fittest (since it is absurd to suppose that efforts to reach high\r\nbranches could lengthen the legs), I illustrated afresh the obstacles to\r\nco-adaptation. Not dwelling on the objection that increase of any\r\ncomponents of the fore-quarters out of adjustment to the others, would\r\ncause evil rather than good, I went on to argue that the co-adaptation of\r\nparts required to make the giraffe's structure useful, is much greater than\r\nat first appears. This animal has a grotesque gallop, necessitated by the\r\ngreat difference in length between the fore and the hind limbs. I pointed\r\nout that the mode of action of the hind limbs shows that the bones and\r\nmuscles have all been changed in their proportions and adjustments; and I\r\ncontended that, difficult as it is to believe that all parts of the\r\nfore-quarters have been co-adapted by the appropriate variations, now of\r\nthis part now of that, it becomes impossible to believe that all the parts\r\nin the hind-quarters have been simultaneously co-adapted to one another and\r\nto all the parts of the fore-quarters: adding that want of co-adaptation,\r\neven in a single muscle, would cause fatal results when high speed had to\r\nbe maintained while escaping from an enemy.\r\n\r\nSince this argument, repeated with this fresh illustration, was published\r\nin 1886, I have met with nothing to be called a reply; and might, I think,\r\nif convictions usually followed proofs, leave the matter as it stands. It\r\nis true that, in his _Darwinism_, Mr. Wallace has adverted to my renewed\r\nobjection, and, as already said, contended that changes such as those\r\ninstanced can be effected by natural selection, since such changes can be\r\neffected by artificial selection: a contention which, as I have pointed\r\nout, assumes a parallelism that does not exist. But now, instead of\r\npursuing the argument further along the same line, let me take a somewhat\r\ndifferent line.\r\n\r\nIf there occurs some change in an organ, say by increase of its size, which\r\nadapts it better to the creature's needs, it is admitted that when, as\r\ncommonly happens, the use of the organ demands the co-operation of other\r\norgans, the change in it will generally be of no service unless the\r\nco-operative organs are changed. If, for instance, there takes place such a\r\nmodification of a rodent's tail as that which, by successive increases,\r\nproduces the trowel-shaped tail of the beaver, no advantage will be derived\r\nunless there also take place certain modifications in the bulks and shapes\r\nof the adjacent vertebræ and their attached muscles, as well as, probably,\r\nin the hind limbs; enabling them to withstand the reactions of the blows\r\ngiven by the tail. And the question is, by what process these many parts,\r\nchanged in different degrees, are co-adapted to the new\r\nrequirements--whether variation and natural selection alone can effect the\r\nreadjustment. There are three conceivable ways in which the parts may\r\nsimultaneously change:--(1) they may all increase or decrease together in\r\nlike degree; (2) they may all simultaneously increase or decrease\r\nindependently, so as not to maintain their previous proportions, or assume\r\nany other special proportions; (3) they may vary in such ways and degrees\r\nas to make them jointly serviceable for the new end. Let us consider\r\nclosely these several conceivabilities.\r\n\r\nAnd first of all, what are we to understand by co-operative parts? In a\r\ngeneral sense, all the organs of the body are co-operative parts, and are\r\nrespectively liable to be more or less changed by change in any one. In a\r\nnarrower sense, more directly relevant to the argument, we may, if we\r\nchoose to multiply difficulties, take the entire framework of bones and\r\nmuscles as formed of co-operative parts; for these are so related that any\r\nconsiderable change in the actions of some entails change in the actions of\r\nmost others. It needs only to observe how, when putting out an effort,\r\nthere goes, along with a deep breath, an expansion of the chest and a\r\nbracing up of the abdomen, to see that various muscles beyond those\r\ndirectly concerned are strained along with them. Or, when suffering from\r\nlumbago, an effort to lift a chair will cause an acute consciousness that\r\nnot the arms only are brought into action, but also the muscles of the\r\nback. These cases show how the motor organs are so tied together that\r\naltered actions of some implicate others quite remote from them.\r\n\r\nBut without using the advantage which this interpretation of the words\r\nwould give, let us take, as co-operative organs, those which are obviously\r\nsuch--the organs of locomotion. What, then, shall we say of the fore limbs\r\nand hind limbs of terrestrial mammals, which co-operate closely and\r\nperpetually? Do they vary together? If so, how have there been produced\r\nsuch contrasted structures as that of the kangaroo, with its large hind\r\nlimbs and small fore limbs, and that of the giraffe, in which the hind\r\nlimbs are small and the fore limbs large--how does it happen that,\r\ndescending from the same primitive mammal, these creatures have diverged in\r\nthe proportions of their limbs in opposite directions? Take, again, the\r\narticulate animals. Compare one of the lower types, with its rows of almost\r\nequal-sized limbs, and one of the higher types, as a crab or a lobster,\r\nwith limbs some very small and some very large. How came this contrast to\r\narise in the course of evolution, if there was the equality of variation\r\nsupposed?\r\n\r\nBut now let us narrow the meaning of the phrase still further, giving it a\r\nmore favourable interpretation. Instead of considering separate limbs as\r\nco-operative, let us consider the component parts of the same limb as\r\nco-operative, and ask what would result, from varying together. It would in\r\nthat case happen that, though the fore and hind limbs of a mammal might\r\nbecome different in their sizes, they would not become different in their\r\nstructures. If so, how have there arisen the unlikenesses between the hind\r\nlegs of the kangaroo and those of the elephant? Or if this comparison is\r\nobjected to, because the creatures belong to the widely different divisions\r\nof implacental and placental mammals, take the cases of the rabbit and the\r\nelephant, both belonging to the last division. On the hypothesis of\r\nevolution these are both derived from the same original form; but the\r\nproportions of the parts have become so widely unlike that the\r\ncorresponding joints are scarcely recognized as such by the unobservant: at\r\nwhat seem corresponding places the legs bend in opposite ways. Equally\r\nmarked, or more marked, is the parallel fact among the _Articulata_. Take\r\nthat limb of the lobster which bears the claw and compare it with the\r\ncorresponding limb in an inferior articulate animal, or the corresponding\r\nlimb of its near ally, the rock lobster, and it becomes obvious that the\r\ncomponent segments of the limb have come to bear to one another in the one\r\ncase, proportions immensely different from those they bear in the other\r\ncase. Undeniably, then, on contemplating the general facts of organic\r\nstructure, we see that the concomitant variations in the parts of limbs,\r\nhave not been of a kind to produce equal amounts of change in them, but\r\nquite the opposite--have been everywhere producing inequalities. Moreover,\r\nwe are reminded that this production of inequalities among co-operative\r\nparts, is an essential principle of development. Had it not been so, there\r\ncould not have been that progress from homogeneity of structure to\r\nheterogeneity of structure which constitutes evolution.\r\n\r\nWe pass now to the second supposition:--that the variations in co-operative\r\nparts occur irregularly, or in such independent ways that they bear no\r\ndefinite relations to one another--miscellaneously, let us say. This is the\r\nsupposition which best corresponds with the facts.  Glances at the faces\r\naround yield conspicuous proofs. Many of the muscles of the face and some\r\nof the bones, are distinctly co-operative; and these respectively vary in\r\nsuch ways as to produce in each person a different combination. What we see\r\nin the face we have reason to believe holds in the limbs and in all other\r\nparts. Indeed, it needs but to compare people whose arms are of the same\r\nlengths, and observe how stumpy are the fingers of one and how slender\r\nthose of another; or it needs but to note the unlikenesses of gait of\r\npassers-by, implying small unlikenesses of structure; to be convinced that\r\nthe relations among the variations of co-operative parts are anything but\r\nfixed. And now, confining our attention to limbs, let us consider what must\r\nhappen if, by variations taking place miscellaneously, limbs have to be\r\npartially changed from fitness for one function to fitness for another\r\nfunction--have to be re-adapted. That the reader may fully comprehend the\r\nargument, he must here have patience while a good many anatomical details\r\nare set down.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose a species of quadruped of which the members have, for\r\nimmense past periods, been accustomed to locomotion over a relatively even\r\nsurface, as, for instance, the \"prairie-dogs\" of North America; and let us\r\nsuppose that increase of numbers has driven part of them into a region full\r\nof obstacles to easy locomotion--covered, say, by the decaying stems of\r\nfallen trees, such as one sees in portions of primeval forest. Ability to\r\nleap must then become a useful trait; and, according to the hypothesis we\r\nare considering, this ability will be produced by the selection of\r\nfavourable variations. What are the variations required? A leap is effected\r\nchiefly by the bending of the hind limbs so as to make sharp angles at the\r\njoints, and then suddenly straightening them; as any one may see on\r\nwatching a cat leap on to the table. The first required change, then, is\r\nincrease of the large extensor muscles, by which the hind limbs are\r\nstraightened. Their increases must be duly proportioned; for if those which\r\nstraightened one joint become much stronger than those which straightened\r\nthe other joint, the result must be collapse of the other joint when the\r\nmuscles are contracted together. But let us make a large admission, and\r\nsuppose these muscles to vary together; what further muscular change is\r\nnext required? In a plantigrade mammal the metatarsal bones chiefly bear\r\nthe reaction of the leap, though the toes may have a share. In a\r\ndigitigrade mammal, however, the toes form almost exclusively the fulcrum,\r\nand if they are to bear the reaction of a higher leap, the flexor muscles\r\nwhich depress and bend them must be proportionately enlarged: if not, the\r\nleap will fail from want of a firm _point d'appui_. Tendons as well as\r\nmuscles must be modified; and, among others, the many tendons which go to\r\nthe digits and their phalanges. Stronger muscles and tendons imply greater\r\nstrains on the joints; and unless these are strengthened, one or other,\r\ndislocation will be caused by a more vigorous spring. Not only the\r\narticulations themselves must be so modified as to bear greater stress, but\r\nalso the numerous ligaments which hold the parts of each in place. Nor can\r\nthe bodies of the bones remain unstrengthened; for if they have no more\r\nthan the strengths needed for previous movements they will fail to bear\r\nmore violent movements. Thus, saying nothing of the required changes in the\r\npelvis, as well as in the nerves and blood-vessels, there are, counting\r\nbones, muscles, tendons, ligaments, at least fifty different parts in each\r\nhind leg which have to be enlarged. Moreover they have to be enlarged in\r\nunlike degrees. The muscles and tendons of the outer toes, for example,\r\nneed not be added to so much as those of the median toes. Now, throughout\r\ntheir successive stages of growth, all these parts have to be kept fairly\r\nwell balanced; as any one may infer on remembering sundry of the accidents\r\nhe has known. Among my own friends I could name one who, when playing\r\nlawn-tennis, snapped the Achilles tendon; another who, while swinging his\r\nchildren, tore some of the muscular fibres in the calf of his leg; another\r\nwho, in getting over a fence, tore a ligament of one knee. Such facts,\r\njoined with every one's experience of sprains, show that during the extreme\r\nexertions to which limbs are now and then subject, there is a giving way of\r\nparts not quite up to the required level of strength. How, then, is this\r\nbalance to be maintained? Suppose the extensor muscles have all varied\r\nappropriately; their variations are useless unless the other co-operative\r\nparts have also varied appropriately. Worse than this. Saying nothing of\r\nthe disadvantage caused by extra weight and cost of nutrition, they will be\r\ncauses of mischief--causes of derangement to the rest by contracting with\r\nundue force. And then, how long will it take for the rest to be brought\r\ninto adjustment? As Mr. Darwin says concerning domestic animals:--\"Any\r\nparticular variation would generally be lost by crossing, reversion, &c.\r\n... unless carefully preserved by man.\" In a state of nature, then,\r\nfavourable variations of these muscles would disappear again long before\r\none or a few of the co-operative parts could be appropriately varied, much\r\nmore before all of them could.\r\n\r\nWith this insurmountable difficulty goes a difficulty still more\r\ninsurmountable--if the expression may be allowed. It is not a question of\r\nincreased sizes of parts only, but of altered shapes of parts, too. A\r\nglance at the skeletons of mammals shows how unlike are the forms of the\r\ncorresponding bones of their limbs; and shows that they have been severally\r\nre-moulded in each species to the different requirements entailed by its\r\ndifferent habits. The change from the structures of hind limbs fitted only\r\nfor walking and trotting to hind limbs fitted also for leaping, implies,\r\ntherefore, that, along with strengthenings of bones there must go\r\nalterations in their forms. Now the fortuitous alterations of form which\r\nmay take place in any bone are countless. How long, then, will it be before\r\nthere takes place that particular alteration which will make the bone\r\nfitter for its new action? And what is the probability that the many\r\nrequired changes of shape, as well as of size, in bones will each of them\r\nbe effected before all the others are lost again? If the probabilities\r\nagainst success are incalculable, when we take account only of changes in\r\nthe sizes of parts, what shall we say of their incalculableness when\r\ndifferences of form also are taken into account?\r\n\r\n\"Surely this piling up of difficulties has gone far enough\"; the reader\r\nwill be inclined to say. By no means. There is a difficulty immeasurably\r\ntranscending those named. We have thus far omitted the second half of the\r\nleap, and the provisions to be made for it. After ascent of the animal's\r\nbody comes descent; and the greater the force with which it is projected\r\nup, the greater is the force with which it comes down. Hence, if the\r\nsupposed creature has undergone such changes in the hind limbs as will\r\nenable them to propel it to a greater height, without having undergone any\r\nchanges in the fore limbs, the result will be that on its descent the fore\r\nlimbs will give way, and it will come down on its nose. The fore limbs,\r\nthen, have to be changed simultaneously with the hind. How changed?\r\nContrast the markedly bent hind limbs of a cat with its almost straight\r\nfore limbs, or contrast the silence of the spring on to the table with the\r\nthud which the fore paws make as it jumps off the table. See how unlike the\r\nactions of the hind and fore limbs are, and how unlike their structures. In\r\nwhat way, then, is the required co-adaptation to be effected? Even were it\r\na question of relative sizes only, there would be no answer; for facts\r\nalready given show that we may not assume simultaneous increases of size to\r\ntake place in the hind and fore limbs; and, indeed, a glance at the various\r\nhuman races, which differ considerably in the ratios of their legs to their\r\narms, shows us this. But it is not simply a question of sizes. To bear the\r\nincreased shock of descent the fore limbs must be changed throughout in\r\ntheir structures. Like those in the hind limbs, the changes must be of many\r\nparts in many proportions; and they must be both in sizes and in shapes.\r\nMore than this. The scapular arch and its attached muscles must also be\r\nstrengthened and re-moulded. See, then, the total requirements. We must\r\nsuppose that by natural selection of miscellaneous variations, the parts of\r\nthe hind limbs will be co-adapted to one another, in sizes, shapes, and\r\nratios; that those of the fore limbs will undergo co-adaptation similar in\r\ntheir complexity, but dissimilar in their kinds; and that the two sets of\r\nco-adaptations will be effected _pari passu_. If, as may be held, the\r\nprobabilities are millions to one against the first set of changes being\r\nachieved, then it may be held that the probabilities are billions to one\r\nagainst the second being simultaneously achieved, in progressive adjustment\r\nto the first.\r\n\r\nThere remains only to notice the third conceivable mode of adjustment. It\r\nmay be imagined that though, by the natural selection of miscellaneous\r\nvariations, these adjustments cannot be effected, they may nevertheless be\r\nmade to take place appropriately. How made? To suppose them so made is to\r\nsuppose that the prescribed end is somewhere recognized; and that the\r\nchanges are step by step simultaneously proportioned for achieving it--is\r\nto suppose a designed production of these changes. In such case, then, we\r\nhave to fall back in part upon the primitive hypothesis; and if we do this\r\nin part, we may as well do it wholly--may as well avowedly return to the\r\ndoctrine of special creations.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the only defensible interpretation? If such modifications of\r\nstructure produced by modifications of function as we see take place in\r\neach individual, are in any measure transmissible to descendants, then all\r\nthese co-adaptations, from the simplest up to the most complex, are\r\naccounted for. In some cases this inheritance of acquired characters\r\nsuffices by itself to explain the facts; and in other cases it suffices\r\nwhen taken in combination with the selection of favourable variations. An\r\nexample of the first class is furnished by the change just considered; and\r\nan example of the second class is furnished by the case, before named, of\r\ndevelopment in a deer's horns. If, by some extra massiveness spontaneously\r\narising, or by formation of an additional \"point,\" an advantage is gained\r\neither for attack or defence, then, if the increased muscularity and\r\nstrengthened structure of the neck and thorax, which wielding of these\r\nsomewhat heavier horns produces, are in a greater or less degree inherited,\r\nand in several successive generations are by this process brought up to the\r\nrequired extra strength, it becomes possible and advantageous for a further\r\nincrease of the horns to take place, and a further increase in the\r\napparatus for wielding them, and so on continuously. By such processes\r\nonly, in which each part gains strength in proportion to function, can\r\nco-operative parts be kept in adjustment, and be re-adjusted to meet new\r\nrequirements. Close contemplation of the facts impresses me more strongly\r\nthan ever with the two alternatives--either there has been inheritance of\r\nacquired characters, or there has been no evolution.\r\n\r\nThis very pronounced opinion will be met, on the part of some, by a no less\r\npronounced demurrer, which involves a denial of possibility. It has been of\r\nlate asserted, and by many believed, that inheritance of acquired\r\ncharacters cannot occur. Weismann, they say, has shown that there is early\r\nestablished in the evolution of each organism such a distinctness between\r\nthose component units which carry on the individual life and those which\r\nare devoted to maintenance of the species, that changes in the one cannot\r\naffect the other. We will look closely into his doctrine.\r\n\r\nBasing his argument on the principle of the physiological division of\r\nlabour, and assuming that the primary division of labour is that between\r\nsuch part of an organism as carries on individual life and such part as is\r\nreserved for the production of other lives, Weismann, starting with \"the\r\nfirst multicellular organism,\" says that--\"Hence the single group would\r\ncome to be divided into two groups of cells, which may be called somatic\r\nand reproductive--the cells of the body as opposed to those which are\r\nconcerned with reproduction.\" (_Essays upon Heredity_, i, p. 27.)\r\n\r\nThough he admits that this differentiation \"was not at first absolute, and\r\nindeed is not always so to-day,\" yet he holds that the differentiation\r\neventually becomes absolute in the sense that the somatic cells, or those\r\nwhich compose the body at large, come to have only a limited power of\r\ncell-division, instead of an unlimited power which the reproductive cells\r\nhave; and also in the sense that eventually there ceases to be any\r\ncommunication between the two further than that implied by the supplying of\r\nnutriment to the reproductive cells by the somatic cells. The outcome of\r\nthis argument is that, in the absence of communication, changes induced in\r\nthe somatic cells, constituting the individual, cannot influence the\r\nnatures of the reproductive cells, and cannot therefore be transmitted to\r\nposterity. Such is the theory. Now let us look at a few facts--some\r\nfamiliar, some unfamiliar.\r\n\r\nHis investigations led Pasteur to the positive conclusion that the silkworm\r\ndiseases are inherited. The transmission from parent to offspring resulted,\r\nnot through any contamination of the surface of the egg by the body of the\r\nparent while being deposited, but resulted from infection of the egg\r\nitself--intrusion of the parasitic organism. Generalized observations\r\nconcerning the disease called _pébrine_, enabled him to decide, by\r\ninspection of the eggs, which were infected and which were not: certain\r\nmodifications of form distinguishing the diseased ones. More than this; the\r\ninfection was proved by microscopical examination of the contents of the\r\negg; in proof of which he quotes as follows from Dr. Carlo Vittadini:--\r\n\r\n  \"Il résulte de mes recherches sur les graines, à l'époque où commence le\r\n  développement du germe, que les corpuscules, une fois apparus dans\r\n  l'oeuf, augmentent graduellement en nombre, à mesure que l'embryon se\r\n  développe; que, dans les derniers jours de l'incubation, l'oeuf en est\r\n  plein, au point de faire croire que la majeure partie des granules du\r\n  jaune se sont transformés en corpuscules.\r\n\r\n  \"Une autre observation importante est que l'embryon aussi est souillé de\r\n  corpuscules, et à un degré tel qu'on peut soupçonner que l'infection du\r\n  jaune tire son origine du germe lui-même; en d'autres termes que le germe\r\n  est primordialement infecté, et porte en lui-même ces corpuscules tout\r\n  comme les vers adultes, frappés du même mal.\"[104]\r\n\r\nThus, then the substance of the egg and even its innermost vital part, is\r\npermeable by a parasite sufficiently large to be microscopically visible.\r\nIt is also of course permeable by the invisible molecules of protein, out\r\nof which its living tissues are formed, and by absorption of which they\r\nsubsequently grow. But, according to Weismann, it is _not_ permeable by\r\nthose invisible units of protoplasm out of which the vitally active tissues\r\nof the parent are constituted: units composed, as we must assume, of\r\nvariously arranged molecules of protein. So that the big thing may pass,\r\nand the little thing may pass, but the intermediate thing may not pass!\r\n\r\nA fact of kindred nature, unhappily more familiar, may be next brought in\r\nevidence. It concerns the transmission of a disease not infrequent among\r\nthose of unregulated lives. The highest authority concerning this disease,\r\nin its inherited form, is Mr. Jonathan Hutchinson; and the following are\r\nextracts from a letter I have received from him, and which I publish with\r\nhis assent:--\r\n\r\n  \"I do not think that there can be any reasonable doubt that a very large\r\n  majority of those who suffer from inherited syphilis take the taint from\r\n  the male parent.... It is the rule when a man marries who has no\r\n  remaining local lesion, but in whom the taint is not eradicated, for his\r\n  wife to remain apparently well, whilst her child may suffer. No doubt the\r\n  child infects its mother's blood, but this does not usually evoke any\r\n  obvious symptoms of syphilis.... I am sure I have seen hundreds of\r\n  syphilitic infants whose mothers had not, so far as I could ascertain,\r\n  ever displayed a single symptom.\"\r\n\r\nSee, then, to what we are committed if we accept Weismann's hypothesis. We\r\nmust conclude, that whereas the reproductive cell may be effectually\r\ninvaded by an abnormal living element in the parental organism, those\r\nnormal living elements which constitute the vital protoplasm of the\r\nparental organism, cannot invade it. Or if it be admitted that both\r\nintrude, then the implication is that, whereas the abnormal element can so\r\nmodify the development as to cause changes of structure (as of the teeth),\r\nthe normal element can cause no changes of structure![105]\r\n\r\nWe pass now to evidence not much known to the world at large, but widely\r\nknown in the biological world, though known in so incomplete a manner as to\r\nbe undervalued in it. Indeed, when I name it, probably many will vent a\r\nmental pooh-pooh. The fact to which I refer is one of which record is\r\npreserved in the museum of the College of Surgeons, in the shape of\r\npaintings of a foal borne by a mare not quite thoroughbred, to a sire which\r\nwas thoroughbred--a foal which bears the markings of the quagga. The\r\nhistory of this remarkable foal is given by the Earl of Morton, F.R.S., in\r\na letter to the President of the Royal Society (read November 23, 1820). In\r\nit he states that wishing to domesticate the quagga, and having obtained a\r\nmale but not a female, he made an experiment.\r\n\r\n  \"I tried to breed from the male quagga and a young chestnut mare of\r\n  seven-eighths Arabian blood, and which had never been bred from; the\r\n  result was the production of a female hybrid, now five years old, and\r\n  bearing, both in her form and in her colour, very decided indications of\r\n  her mixed origin. I subsequently parted with the seven-eighths Arabian\r\n  mare to Sir Gore Ouseley, who has bred from her by a very fine black\r\n  Arabian horse. I yesterday morning examined the produce, namely, a\r\n  two-year-old filly and a year-old colt. They have the character of the\r\n  Arabian breed as decidedly as can be expected, where fifteen-sixteenths\r\n  of the blood are Arabian; and they are fine specimens of that breed; but\r\n  both in their colour and in the hair of their manes, they have a striking\r\n  resemblance to the quagga. Their colour is bay, marked more or less like\r\n  the quagga in a darker tint. Both are distinguished by the dark line\r\n  along the ridge of the back, the dark stripes across the forehead, and\r\n  the dark bars across the back part of the legs.\"[106]\r\n\r\nLord Morton then names sundry further correspondences. Dr. Wollaston, at\r\nthat time President of the Royal Society, who had seen the animals,\r\ntestified to the correctness of his description, and, as shown by his\r\nremarks, entertained no doubt about the alleged facts. But good reason for\r\ndoubt may be assigned. There naturally arises the question--How does it\r\nhappen that parallel results are not observed in other cases? If in any\r\nprogeny certain traits not belonging to the sire, but belonging to a sire\r\nof preceding progeny, are reproduced, how is it that such anomalously\r\ninherited traits are not observed in domestic animals, and indeed in\r\nmankind? How is it that the children of a widow by a second husband do not\r\nbear traceable resemblances to the first husband? To these questions\r\nnothing like satisfactory replies seem forthcoming; and, in the absence of\r\nreplies, scepticism, if not disbelief, may be held reasonable.\r\n\r\nThere is an explanation, however. Forty years ago I made acquaintance with\r\na fact which impressed me by its significant implications, and has, for\r\nthis reason I suppose, remained in my memory. It is set forth in the\r\n_Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society_, Vol. XIV (1853), pp. 214 _et\r\nseq._, and concerns certain results of crossing French and English breeds\r\nof sheep. The writer of the translated paper, M. Malingie-Nouel, Director\r\nof the Agricultural School of La Charmoise, states that when the French\r\nbreeds of sheep (in which were included \"the _mongrel_ Merinos\") were\r\ncrossed with an English breed, \"the lambs present the following results.\r\nMost of them resemble the mother more than the father; some show no trace\r\nof the father.\" Joining the admission respecting the mongrels with the\r\nfacts subsequently stated, it is tolerably clear that the cases in which\r\nthe lambs bore no traces of the father were cases in which the mother was\r\nof pure breed. Speaking of the results of these crossings in the second\r\ngeneration, \"having 75 per cent. of English blood,\" M. Nouel says:--\"The\r\nlambs thrive, wear a beautiful appearance, and complete the joy of the\r\nbreeder.... No sooner are the lambs weaned than their strength, their\r\nvigour, and their beauty begin to decay.... At last the constitution gives\r\nway ... he remains stunted for life:\" the constitution being thus proved\r\nunstable or unadapted to the requirements. How, then, did M. Nouel succeed\r\nin obtaining a desirable combination of a fine English breed with the\r\nrelatively poor French breeds?\r\n\r\n  He took an animal from \"flocks originally sprung from a mixture of the\r\n  two distinct races that are established in those two provinces [Berry and\r\n  La Sologne],\" and these he \"united with animals of another mixed breed\r\n  ... which blended the Tourangelle and native Merino blood of\" La Beauce\r\n  and Touraine, and obtained a mixture of all four races \"without decided\r\n  character, without fixity ... but possessing the advantage of being used\r\n  to our climate and management.\"\r\n\r\n  Putting one of these \"mixed blood ewes to a pure New-Kent ram ... one\r\n  obtains a lamb containing fifty-hundredths of the purest and most ancient\r\n  English blood, with twelve and a half hundredths of four different French\r\n  races, which are individually lost in the preponderance of English blood,\r\n  and disappear almost entirely, leaving the improving type in the\r\n  ascendant.... All the lambs produced strikingly resembled each other, and\r\n  even Englishmen took them for animals of their own country.\"\r\n\r\nM. Nouel goes on to remark that when this derived breed was bred with\r\nitself, the marks of the French breeds were lost. \"Some slight traces\"\r\ncould be detected by experts, but these \"soon disappeared.\"\r\n\r\nThus we get proof that relatively pure constitutions predominate in progeny\r\nover much mixed constitutions. The reason is not difficult to see. Every\r\norganism tends to become adapted to its conditions of life; and all the\r\nstructures of a species, accustomed through multitudinous generations to\r\nthe climate, food, and various influences of its locality, are moulded into\r\nharmonious co-operation favourable to life in that locality: the result\r\nbeing that in the development of each young individual, the tendencies\r\nconspire to produce the fit organization. It is otherwise when the species\r\nis removed to a habitat of different character, or when it is of mixed\r\nbreed. In the one case its organs, partially out of harmony with the\r\nrequirements of its new life, become partially out of harmony with one\r\nanother; since, while one influence, say of climate, is but little changed,\r\nanother influence, say of food, is much changed; and, consequently, the\r\nperturbed relations of the organs interfere with their original stable\r\nequilibrium. Still more in the other case is there a disturbance in\r\nequilibrium. In a mongrel, the constitution derived from each source\r\nrepeats itself as far as possible. Hence a conflict of tendencies to evolve\r\ntwo structures more or less unlike. The tendencies do not harmoniously\r\nconspire, but produce partially incongruous sets of organs. And evidently\r\nwhere the breed is one in which there are united the traits of various\r\nlines of ancestry, there results an organization so full of small\r\nincongruities of structure and action, that it has a much-diminished power\r\nof maintaining its balance; and while it cannot withstand so well adverse\r\ninfluences, it cannot so well hold its own in the offspring. Concerning\r\nparents of pure and mixed breeds respectively, severally tending to\r\nreproduce their own structures in progeny, we may therefore say,\r\nfiguratively, that the house divided against itself cannot withstand the\r\nhouse of which the members are in concord.\r\n\r\nNow if this is shown to be the case with breeds the purest of which have\r\nbeen adapted to their habitats and modes of life during some few hundred\r\nyears only, what shall we say when the question is of a breed which has had\r\na constant mode of life in the same locality for ten thousand years or\r\nmore, like the quagga? In this the stability of constitution must be such\r\nas no domestic animal can approach. Relatively stable as may have been the\r\nconstitutions of Lord Morton's horses, as compared with the constitutions\r\nof ordinary horses, yet, since Arab horses, even in their native country,\r\nhave probably in the course of successive conquests and migrations of\r\ntribes become more or less mixed, and since they have been subject to the\r\nconditions of domestic life, differing much from the conditions of their\r\noriginal wild life, and since the English breed has undergone the\r\nperturbing effects of change from the climate and food of the East to the\r\nclimate and food of the West, the organizations of the horse and mare in\r\nquestion could have had nothing like that perfect balance produced in the\r\nquagga by a hundred centuries of harmonious co-operation. Hence the result.\r\nAnd hence at the same time the interpretation of the fact that analogous\r\nphenomena are not obvious among most domestic animals, or among ourselves;\r\nsince both have relatively mixed, and generally extremely mixed,\r\nconstitutions, which, as we see in ourselves, have been made generation\r\nafter generation, not by the formation of a mean between two parents, but\r\nby the jumbling of traits of the one with traits of the other; until there\r\nexist no such conspiring tendencies among the parts as cause repetition of\r\ncombined details of structure in posterity.\r\n\r\nExpectation that scepticism might be felt respecting this alleged anomaly\r\npresented by the quagga-marked foal, had led me to think over the matter;\r\nand I had reached this interpretation before sending to the College of\r\nSurgeons Museum (being unable to go myself) to obtain the particulars and\r\nrefer to the records. When there was brought to me a copy of the account as\r\nset forth in the _Philosophical Transactions_, it was joined with the\r\ninformation that there existed an appended account of pigs, in which a\r\nparallel fact had been observed. To my immediate inquiry--\"Was the male a\r\nwild pig?\" there came the reply--\"I did not observe.\" Of course I forthwith\r\nobtained the volume, and there found what I expected. It was contained in a\r\npaper communicated by Dr. Wollaston from Daniel Giles, Esq., concerning his\r\n\"sow and her produce,\" which said that--\r\n\r\n  \"she was one of a well-known black and white breed of Mr. Western, the\r\n  Member for Essex. About ten years since I put her to a boar of the wild\r\n  breed, and of a deep chestnut colour which I had just received from\r\n  Hatfield House, and which was soon afterwards drowned by accident. The\r\n  pigs produced (which were her first litter) partook in appearance of both\r\n  boar and sow, but in some the chestnut colour of the boar strongly\r\n  prevailed.\r\n\r\n  \"The sow was afterwards put to a boar of Mr. Western's breed (the wild\r\n  boar having been long dead). The produce was a litter of pigs, some of\r\n  which, we observed with much surprise, to be stained and clearly marked\r\n  with the chestnut colour which had prevailed in the former litter.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Giles adds that in a second litter of pigs, the father of which was of\r\nMr. Western's breed, he and his bailiff believe there was a recurrence, in\r\nsome, of the chestnut colour, but admits that their \"recollection is much\r\nless perfect than I wish it to be.\" He also adds that, in the course of\r\nmany years' experience, he had never known the least appearance of the\r\nchestnut colour in Mr. Western's breed.\r\n\r\nWhat are the probabilities that these two anomalous results should have\r\narisen, under these exceptional conditions, as a matter of chance?\r\nEvidently the probabilities against such a coincidence are enormous. The\r\ntestimony is in both cases so good that, even apart from the coincidence,\r\nit would be unreasonable to reject it; but the coincidence makes acceptance\r\nof it imperative. There is mutual verification, at the same time that there\r\nis a joint interpretation yielded of the strange phenomenon, and of its\r\nnon-occurrence under ordinary circumstances.\r\n\r\nAnd now, in presence of these facts, what are we to say? Simply that they\r\nare fatal to Weismann's hypothesis. They show that there is none of the\r\nalleged independence of the reproductive cells; but that the two sets of\r\ncells are in close communion. They prove that while the reproductive cells\r\nmultiply and arrange themselves during the evolution of the embryo, some of\r\ntheir germ-plasm passes into the mass of somatic cells constituting the\r\nparental body, and becomes a permanent component of it. Further, they\r\nnecessitate the inference that this introduced germ-plasm, everywhere\r\ndiffused, is some of it included in the reproductive cells subsequently\r\nformed. And if we thus get a demonstration that the somewhat different\r\nunits of a foreign germ-plasm permeating the organism, permeate also the\r\nsubsequently formed reproductive cells, and affect the structures of the\r\nindividuals arising from them, the implication is that the like happens\r\nwith those native units which have been made somewhat different by modified\r\nfunctions: there must be a tendency to inheritance of acquired characters.\r\n\r\nOne more step only has to be taken. It remains to ask what is the flaw in\r\nthe assumption with which Weismann's theory sets out. If, as we see, the\r\nconclusions drawn from it do not correspond to the facts, then, either the\r\nreasoning is invalid, or the original postulate is untrue. Leaving aside\r\nall questions concerning the reasoning, it will suffice here to show the\r\nuntruth of the postulate. Had his work been written during the early years\r\nof the cell-doctrine, the supposition that the multiplying cells of which\r\nthe _Metazoa_ and _Metaphyta_ are composed, become completely separate,\r\ncould not have been met by a reasonable scepticism; but now, not only is\r\nscepticism justifiable, but denial is called for. Some dozen years ago it\r\nwas discovered that in many cases vegetal cells are connected with one\r\nanother by threads of protoplasm--threads which unite the internal\r\nprotoplasm of one cell with the internal protoplasms of cells around It is\r\nas though the pseudopodia of imprisoned rhizopods were fused with the\r\npseudopodia of adjacent imprisoned rhizopods. We cannot reasonably suppose\r\nthat the continuous network of protoplasm thus constituted has been\r\nproduced after the cells have become adult. These protoplasmic connections\r\nmust have survived the process of fission. The implication is that the\r\ncells forming the embryo-plant retained their protoplasmic connections\r\nwhile they multiplied, and that such connections continued throughout all\r\nsubsequent multiplications--an implication which has, I believe, been\r\nestablished by researches upon germinating palm-seeds. But now we come to a\r\nverifying series of facts which the cell-structures of animals in their\r\nearly stages present. In his _Monograph of the Development of Peripatus\r\nCapensis_, Mr. Adam Sedgwick, F.R.S., Reader in Animal Morphology at\r\nCambridge, writes as follows:--\r\n\r\n  \"All the cells of the ovum, ectodermal as well as endodermal, are\r\n  connected together by a fine protoplasmic reticulum.\" (p. 41)\r\n\r\n  \"The continuity of the various cells of the segmenting ovum is primary,\r\n  and not secondary; _i. e._, in the cleavage the segments do not\r\n  completely separate from one another. But are we justified in speaking of\r\n  cells at all in this case? _The fully segmented ovum is a syncytium, and\r\n  there are not and have not been at any stage cell limits._\" (p. 41)\r\n\r\n  \"It is becoming more and more clear every day that the cells composing\r\n  the tissues of animals are not isolated units, but that they are\r\n  connected with one another. I need only refer to the connection known to\r\n  exist between connective tissue cells, cartilage cells, epithelial cells,\r\n  &c. And not only may the cells of one tissue be continuous with each\r\n  other, but they may also be continuous with the cells of other tissues.\"\r\n  (pp. 47-8)\r\n\r\n  \"Finally, if the protoplasm of the body is primitively a syncytium, and\r\n  the ovum until maturity a part of that syncytium, the separation of the\r\n  generative products does not differ essentially from the internal\r\n  gemmation of a Protozoon, and the inheritance by the offspring of\r\n  peculiarities first appearing in the parent, though not explained, is\r\n  rendered less mysterious; for the protoplasm of the whole body being\r\n  continuous, change in the molecular constitution of any part of it would\r\n  naturally be expected to spread, in time, through the whole mass.\" (p.\r\n  49)\r\n\r\nMr. Sedgwick's subsequent investigations confirm these conclusions. In a\r\nletter of December 27, 1892, passages which he allows me to publish run as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  \"All the embryological studies that I have made since that to which you\r\n  refer confirm me more and more in the view that the connections between\r\n  the cells of adults are not secondary connections, but primary, dating\r\n  from the time when the embryo was a unicellular structure.... My own\r\n  investigations on this subject have been confined to the Arthropoda,\r\n  Elasmobranchii, and Aves. I have thoroughly examined the development of\r\n  at least one kind of each of these groups, and I have never been able to\r\n  detect a stage in which the cells were not continuous with each other;\r\n  and I have studied innumerable stages from the beginning of cleavage\r\n  onwards.\"\r\n\r\nSo that the alleged independence of the reproductive cells does not exist.\r\nThe _soma_--to use Weismann's name for the aggregate of cells forming the\r\nbody--is, in the words of Mr. Sedgwick, \"a continuous mass of vacuolated\r\nprotoplasm;\" and the reproductive cells are nothing more than portions of\r\nit separated some little time before they are required to perform their\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nThus the theory of Weismann is doubly disproved. Inductively we are shown\r\nthat there _does_ take place that communication of characters from the\r\nsomatic cells to the reproductive cells, which he says cannot take place;\r\nand deductively we are shown that this communication is a natural sequence\r\nof connections between the two which he ignores; his various conclusions\r\nare deduced from a postulate which is untrue.\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nFrom the title of this essay, and from much of its contents, nine readers\r\nout of ten will infer that it is directed against the views of Mr. Darwin.\r\nThey will be astonished on being told that, contrariwise, it is directed\r\nagainst the views of those who, in a considerable measure, dissent from Mr.\r\nDarwin. For the inheritance of acquired characters, which it is now the\r\nfashion in the biological world to deny, was, by Mr. Darwin, fully\r\nrecognized and often insisted on. Such of the foregoing arguments as touch\r\nMr. Darwin's views, simply imply that the cause of evolution which at first\r\nhe thought unimportant, but the importance of which he increasingly\r\nperceived as he grew older, is more important than he admitted, even at the\r\nlast. The neo-Darwinists, however, do not admit this cause at all.\r\n\r\nLet it not be supposed that this explanation implies any disapproval of the\r\ndissentients, considered as such. Seeing how little regard for authority I\r\nhave myself usually shown, it would be absurd in me to reflect in any\r\ndegree upon those who have rejected certain of Mr. Darwin's teachings, for\r\nreasons which they have held sufficient. But while their independence of\r\nthought is to be applauded rather than blamed, it is, I think, to be\r\nregretted that they have not guarded themselves against a long-standing\r\nbias. It is a common trait of human nature to seek some excuse when found\r\nin the wrong. Invaded self-esteem sets up a defence, and anything is made\r\nto serve. Thus it happened that when geologists and biologists, previously\r\nholding that all kinds of organisms arose by special creations, surrendered\r\nto the battery opened upon them by _The Origin of Species_, they sought to\r\nminimise their irrationality by pointing to irrationality on the other\r\nside. \"Well, at any rate, Lamarck was in the wrong.\" \"It is clear that we\r\nwere right in rejecting _his_ doctrine.\" And so, by duly emphasizing the\r\nfact that he overlooked \"Natural Selection\" as the chief cause, and by\r\nshowing how erroneous were some of his interpretations, they succeeded in\r\nmitigating the sense of their own error. It is true their creed was that at\r\nsuccessive periods in the Earth's history, old Floras and Faunas had been\r\nabolished and others introduced; just as though, to use Professor Huxley's\r\nfigure, the table had been now and again kicked over and a new pack of\r\ncards brought out. And it is true that Lamarck, while he rejected this\r\nabsurd creed, assigned for the facts reasons some of which are absurd. But\r\nin consequence of the feeling described, his defensible belief was\r\nforgotten and only his indefensible ones remembered. This one-sided\r\nestimate has become traditional; so that there is now often shown a subdued\r\ncontempt for those who suppose that there can be any truth in the\r\nreasonings of a man whose general conception was partly sense, at a time\r\nwhen the general conceptions of his contemporaries were wholly nonsense.\r\nHence results unfair treatment--hence result the different dealings with\r\nthe views of Lamarck and of Weismann.\r\n\r\n\"Where are the facts proving the inheritance of acquired characters?\" ask\r\nthose who deny it. Well, in the first place, there might be asked the\r\ncounter-question--Where are the facts which disprove it? Surely if not only\r\nthe general structures of organisms, but also many of the modifications\r\narising in them, are inheritable, the natural implication is that all\r\nmodifications are inheritable; and if any say that the inheritableness is\r\nlimited to those arising in a certain way, the _onus_ lies on them of\r\nproving that those otherwise arising are not inheritable.[107] Leaving this\r\ncounter-question aside, however, it will suffice if we ask another\r\ncounter-question. It is asserted that the dwindling of organs from disuse\r\nis due to the successive survivals in posterity of individuals in which the\r\norgans have varied in the direction of decrease. Where now are the facts\r\nsupporting this assertion? Not one has been assigned or can be assigned.\r\nNot a single case can be named in which _panmixia_ is a proved cause of\r\ndiminution. Even had the deductive argument for _panmixia_ been as valid as\r\nwe have found it to be invalid, there would still have been required, in\r\npursuance of scientific method, some verifying inductive evidence. Yet,\r\nthough not a shred of such evidence has been given, the doctrine is\r\naccepted with acclamation, and adopted as part of current biological\r\ntheory. Articles are written and letters published in which it is assumed\r\nthat this mere speculation, justified by not a tittle of proof, displaces\r\nlarge conclusions previously drawn. And then, passing into the outer world,\r\nthis unsupported belief affects opinions there too; so that we have\r\nrecently had a Right Honourable lecturer who, taking for granted its truth,\r\nrepresents the inheritance of acquired characters as an exploded\r\nhypothesis, and proceeds to give revised views of human affairs.\r\n\r\nFinally, there comes the reply that there _are_ facts proving the\r\ninheritance of acquired characters. All those assigned by Mr. Darwin,\r\ntogether with others such, remain outstanding when we find that the\r\ninterpretation by _panmixia_ is untenable. Indeed, even had that hypothesis\r\nbeen tenable, it would have been inapplicable to these cases; since in\r\ndomestic animals, artificially fed and often overfed, the supposed\r\nadvantage from economy cannot be shown to tell; and since, in these cases,\r\nindividuals are not naturally selected during the struggle for life, in\r\nwhich certain traits are advantageous, but are artificially selected by man\r\nwithout regard to such traits. Should it be urged that the assigned facts\r\nare not numerous, it may be replied that there are no persons whose\r\noccupations and amusements incidentally bring out such facts; and that they\r\nare probably as numerous as those which would have been available for Mr.\r\nDarwin's hypothesis, had there been no breeders and fanciers and gardeners\r\nwho, in pursuit of their profits and hobbies, furnished him with evidence.\r\nIt may be added that the required facts are not likely to be numerous, if\r\nbiologists refuse to seek for them.\r\n\r\nSee, then, how the case stands. Natural selection, or survival of the\r\nfittest, is almost exclusively operative throughout the vegetal world and\r\nthroughout the lower animal world, characterized by relative passivity. But\r\nwith the ascent to higher types of animals, its effects are in increasing\r\ndegrees involved with those produced by inheritance of acquired characters;\r\nuntil, in animals of complex structures, inheritance of acquired characters\r\nbecomes an important, if not the chief, cause of evolution. We have seen\r\nthat natural selection cannot work any changes in organisms save such as\r\nconduce in considerable degrees, directly or indirectly, to the\r\nmultiplication of the stirp; whence failure to account for various changes\r\nascribed to it. And we have seen that it yields no explanation of the\r\nco-adaptation of co-operative parts, even when the co-operation is\r\nrelatively simple, and still less when it is complex. On the other hand, we\r\nsee that if, along with the transmission of generic and specific\r\nstructures, there tend to be transmitted modifications arising in a certain\r\nway, there is a strong _a priori_ probability that there tend to be\r\ntransmitted modifications arising in all ways. We have a number of facts\r\nconfirming this inference, and showing that acquired characters are\r\ninherited--as large a number as can be expected, considering the difficulty\r\nof observing them and the absence of search. And then to these facts may be\r\nadded the facts with which this essay set out, concerning the distribution\r\nof tactual discriminativeness. While we saw that these are inexplicable by\r\nsurvival of the fittest, we saw that they are clearly explicable as\r\nresulting from the inheritance of acquired characters. And here let it be\r\nadded that this conclusion is conspicuously warranted by one of the methods\r\nof inductive logic, known as the method of concomitant variations. For\r\nthroughout the whole series of gradations in perceptive power, we saw that\r\nthe amount of the effect is proportionate to the amount of the alleged\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nApart from those more special theories of Professor Weismann I lately dealt\r\nwith, the wide acceptance of which by the biological world greatly\r\nsurprises me, there are certain more general theories of his--fundamental\r\ntheories--the acceptance of which surprises me still more. Of the two on\r\nwhich rests the vast superstructure of his speculations, the first concerns\r\nthe distinction between the reproductive elements of each organism and the\r\nnon-reproductive elements. He says:--\r\n\r\n  \"Let us now consider how it happened that the multicellular animals and\r\n  plants, which arose from unicellular forms of life, came to lose this\r\n  power of living for ever.\r\n\r\n  \"The answer to this question is closely bound up with the principle of\r\n  division of labour which appeared among multicellular organisms at a very\r\n  early stage....\r\n\r\n  \"The first multicellular organism was probably a cluster of similar\r\n  cells, but these units soon lost their original homogeneity. As the\r\n  result of mere relative position, some of the cells were especially\r\n  fitted to provide for the nutrition of the colony, while others undertook\r\n  the work of reproduction.\" (_Essays upon Heredity_, i, p. 27)\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have the great principle of the division of labour, which is\r\nthe principle of all organization, taken as primarily illustrated in the\r\ndivision between the reproductive cells and the non-reproductive or somatic\r\ncells--the cells devoted to the continuance of the species, and the cells\r\nwhich subserve the life of the individual. And the early separation of\r\nreproductive cells from somatic cells, is alleged on the ground that this\r\nprimary division of labour is that which arises between elements devoted to\r\nspecies-life and elements devoted to individual life. Let us not be content\r\nwith words but look at the facts.\r\n\r\nWhen Milne-Edwards first used the phrase \"physiological division of\r\nlabour,\" he was obviously led to do so by perceiving the analogy between\r\nthe division of labour in a society, as described by political economists,\r\nand the division of labour in an organism. Every one who reads has been\r\nfamiliarized with the first as illustrated in the early stages, when men\r\nwere warriors while the cultivation and drudgery were done by slaves and\r\nwomen; and as illustrated in the later stages, when not only are\r\nagriculture and manufactures carried on by separate classes, but\r\nagriculture is carried on by landlords, farmers, and labourers, while\r\nmanufactures, multitudinous in their kinds, severally involve the actions\r\nof capitalists, overseers, workers, &c., and while the great function of\r\ndistribution is carried on by wholesale and retail dealers in different\r\ncommodities. Meanwhile students of biology, led by Milne-Edwards's phrase,\r\nhave come to recognize a parallel arrangement in a living creature; shown,\r\nprimarily, in the devoting of the outer parts to the general business of\r\nobtaining food and escaping from enemies, while the inner parts are devoted\r\nto the utilization of food, and supporting themselves and the outer parts;\r\nand shown, secondarily, by the subdivision of these great functions into\r\nthose of various limbs and senses in the one case, and in the other case\r\ninto those of organs for digestion, respiration, circulation, excretion,\r\n&c. But now let us ask what is the essential nature of this division of\r\nlabour. In both cases it is an _exchange of services_--an arrangement under\r\nwhich, while one part devotes itself to one kind of action and yields\r\nbenefits to all the rest, all the rest, jointly and severally performing\r\ntheir special actions, yield benefits to it in exchange. Otherwise\r\ndescribed, it is a system of _mutual_ dependence: A depends for its welfare\r\nupon B, C, and D; B upon A, C, and D; and so with the rest: all depend upon\r\neach and each upon all. Now let us apply this true conception of the\r\ndivision of labour, to that which Professor Weismann calls a division of\r\nlabour. Where is the _exchange of services_ between somatic cells and\r\nreproductive cells? There is none. The somatic cells render great services\r\nto the reproductive cells, by furnishing them with materials for growth and\r\nmultiplication; but the reproductive cells render no services at all to the\r\nsomatic cells. If we look for the _mutual_ dependence we look in vain. We\r\nfind entire dependence on the one side and none on the other. Between the\r\nparts devoted to individual life and the part devoted to species-life,\r\nthere is no division of labour whatever. The individual works for the\r\nspecies; but the species works not for the individual. Whether at the stage\r\nwhen the species is represented by reproductive cells, or at the stage when\r\nit is represented by eggs, or at the stage when it is represented by young,\r\nthe parent does everything for it, and it does nothing for the parent. The\r\nessential part of the conception is gone: there is no giving and receiving,\r\nno exchange, no mutuality.\r\n\r\nBut now suppose we pass over this fallacious interpretation, and grant\r\nProfessor Weismann his fundamental assumption and his fundamental\r\ncorollary. Suppose we grant that because the primary division of labour is\r\nthat between somatic cells and reproductive cells, these two groups are the\r\nfirst to be differentiated. Having granted this corollary, let us compare\r\nit with the facts. As the alleged primary division of labour is universal,\r\nso the alleged primary differentiation should be universal too. Let us see\r\nwhether it is so. Already, in the paragraph from which I have quoted above,\r\na crack in the doctrine is admitted: it is said that \"this differentiation\r\nwas not at first absolute, and indeed it is not always so to-day.\" And\r\nthen, on turning to page 74, we find that the crack has become a chasm. Of\r\nthe reproductive cells it is stated that--\"In Vertebrata they do not become\r\ndistinct from the other cells of the body until the embryo is completely\r\nformed.\" That is to say, in this large and most important division of the\r\nanimal kingdom, the implied universal law does not hold. Much more than\r\nthis is confessed. Lower down the page we read--\"There may be in fact cases\r\nin which such separation does not take place until after the animal is\r\ncompletely formed, and others, as I believe that I have shown, in which it\r\nfirst arises one or more generations later, viz., in the buds produced by\r\nthe parent.\"\r\n\r\nSo that in other great divisions of the animal kingdom the alleged law is\r\nbroken; as among the _Coelenterata_ by the _Hydrozoa_, as among the\r\n_Mollusca_ by the Ascidians, and as among the _Platyhelminthes_ by the\r\nTrematode worms.\r\n\r\nFollowing this admission concerning the _Vertebrata_, come certain\r\nsentences which I partially italicize:--\r\n\r\n  \"Thus, as their development shows, a marked antithesis exists between the\r\n  substance of the undying reproductive cells and that of the perishable\r\n  body-cells. We cannot explain this fact except _by the supposition_ that\r\n  each reproductive cell potentially contains two kinds of substance, which\r\n  at a variable time after the commencement of embryonic development,\r\n  separate from one another, and finally produce two sharply contrasted\r\n  groups of cells.\" (p. 74)\r\n\r\nAnd a little lower down the page we meet with the lines:--\r\n\r\n  \"_It is therefore quite conceivable_ that the reproductive cells might\r\n  separate from the somatic cells much later than in the examples mentioned\r\n  above, without changing the hereditary tendencies of which they are the\r\n  bearers.\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, it is \"quite conceivable\" that after sexless _Cercariæ_\r\nhave gone on multiplying by internal gemmation for generations, the \"two\r\nkinds of substance\" have, notwithstanding innumerable cell-divisions,\r\npreserved their respective natures, and finally separate in such ways as to\r\nproduce reproductive cells. Here Professor Weismann does not, as in a case\r\nbefore noted, assume something which it is \"easy to imagine,\" but he\r\nassumes something which it is difficult to imagine; and apparently thinks\r\nthat a scientific conclusion may be thereon safely based.\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nAssociated with the assertion that the primary division of labour is\r\nbetween the somatic cells and the reproductive cells, and associated with\r\nthe corollary that the primary differentiation is that which arises between\r\nthem, there goes another corollary. It is alleged that there exists a\r\nfundamental distinction of nature between these two classes of cells. They\r\nare described as respectively mortal and immortal, in the sense that those\r\nof the one class are limited in their powers of multiplication, while those\r\nof the other class are unlimited. And it is contended that this is due to\r\ninherent unlikeness of nature.\r\n\r\nBefore inquiring into the truth of this proposition, I may fitly remark\r\nupon a preliminary proposition set down by Professor Weismann. Referring to\r\nthe hypothesis that death depends \"upon causes which lie in the nature of\r\nlife itself,\" he says:--\r\n\r\n  \"I do not however believe in the validity of this explanation: I consider\r\n  that death is not a primary necessity, but that it has been secondarily\r\n  acquired as an adaptation. I believe that life is endowed with a fixed\r\n  duration, not because it is contrary to its nature to be unlimited, but\r\n  because the unlimited existence of individuals would be a luxury without\r\n  any corresponding advantage.\" (p. 24)\r\n\r\nThis last sentence has a teleological sound which would be appropriate did\r\nit come from a theologian, but which seems strange as coming from a man of\r\nscience. Assuming, however, that the implication was not intended, I go on\r\nto remark that Professor Weismann has apparently overlooked a universal law\r\nof evolution--not organic only, but inorganic and super-organic--which\r\nimplies the necessity of death. The changes of every aggregate, no matter\r\nof what kind, inevitably end in a state of equilibrium. Suns and planets\r\ndie, as well as organisms. The process of integration, which constitutes\r\nthe fundamental trait of all evolution, continues until it has brought\r\nabout a state which negatives further alterations, molar or molecular--a\r\nstate of balance among the forces of the aggregate and the forces which\r\noppose them.[108] In so far, therefore, as Professor Weismann's conclusions\r\nimply the non-necessity of death, they cannot be sustained.\r\n\r\nBut now let us consider the above-described antithesis between the immortal\r\n_Protozoa_ and the mortal _Metazoa_. An essential part of the theory is\r\nthat the _Protozoa_ can go on dividing and subdividing without limit, so\r\nlong as the fit external conditions are maintained. But what is the\r\nevidence for this? Even by Professor Weismann's own admission there is no\r\nproof. On p. 285 he says:--\r\n\r\n  \"I could only consent to adopt the hypothesis of rejuvenescence [achieved\r\n  by conjugation], if it were rendered absolutely certain that reproduction\r\n  by division could never under any circumstances persist indefinitely. But\r\n  this cannot be proved with any greater certainty than the converse\r\n  proposition, and hence, as far as direct proof is concerned, the facts\r\n  are equally uncertain on both sides.\"\r\n\r\nBut this is an admission which seems to be entirely ignored when there is\r\nalleged the contrast between the immortal _Protozoa_ and the mortal\r\n_Metazoa_. Following Professor Weismann's method, it would be \"easy to\r\nimagine\" that occasional conjugation is in all cases essential; and this\r\neasily imagined conclusion might fitly be used to bar out his own. Indeed,\r\nconsidering how commonly conjugation is observed, it may be held difficult\r\nto imagine that it can in any cases be dispensed with. Apart from\r\nimaginations of either kind, however, here is an acknowledgment that the\r\nimmortality of _Protozoa_ is not proved; that the allegation has no better\r\nbasis than the failure to observe cessation of fission; and that thus one\r\nterm of the above antithesis is not a fact, but is only an assumption.\r\n\r\nAnd now what about the other term of the antithesis--the alleged inherent\r\nmortality of the somatic cells? This we shall, I think, find is no more\r\ndefensible than the other. Such plausibility as it possesses disappears\r\nwhen, instead of contemplating the vast assemblage of familiar cases which\r\nanimals present, we contemplate certain less familiar and unfamiliar cases.\r\nBy these we are shown that the usual ending of multiplication among somatic\r\ncells is due, not to an intrinsic cause, but to extrinsic causes. Let us,\r\nhowever, first look at Professor Weismann's own statements:--\r\n\r\n  \"I have endeavoured to explain death as the result of restriction in the\r\n  powers of reproduction possessed by the somatic cells, and I have\r\n  suggested that such restriction may conceivably follow from a limitation\r\n  in the number of cell-generations possible for the cells of each organ\r\n  and tissue.\" (p. 28)\r\n\r\n  \"The above-mentioned considerations show us that the degree of\r\n  reproductive activity present in the tissues is regulated by internal\r\n  causes while the natural death of an organism is the termination--the\r\n  hereditary limitation--of the process of cell-division, which began in\r\n  the segmentation of the ovum.\" (p. 30)\r\n\r\nNow, though, in the above extracts there is mention of \"internal causes\"\r\ndetermining \"the degree of reproductive activity\" of tissue cells, and\r\nthough, on page 28, the \"causes of the loss\" of the power of unlimited\r\ncell-production \"must be sought outside the organism, that is to say, in\r\nthe external conditions of life,\" yet the doctrine is that somatic cells\r\nhave become constitutionally unfitted for continued cell-multiplication.\r\n\r\n  \"The somatic cells have lost this power to a gradually increasing extent,\r\n  so that at length they became restricted to a fixed, though perhaps very\r\n  large, number of cell-generations.\" (p. 28)\r\n\r\nExamination will soon disclose good reasons for denying this inherent\r\nrestriction. We will look at the various causes which affect their\r\nmultiplication, and usually put a stop to increase after a certain point is\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nThere is first the amount of vital capital given by the parent; partly in\r\nthe shape of a more or less developed structure, and partly in the shape of\r\nbequeathed nutriment. Where this vital capital is small, and the young\r\ncreature, forthwith obliged to carry on physiological business for itself,\r\nhas to expend effort in obtaining materials for daily consumption as well\r\nas for growth, a rigid restraint is put on that cell-multiplication\r\nrequired for a large size. Clearly, the young elephant, starting with a big\r\nand well-organized body, and supplied _gratis_ with milk during early\r\nstages of growth, can begin physiological business on his own account on a\r\ngreat scale; and by its large transactions his system is enabled to supply\r\nnutriment to its multiplying somatic cells until they have formed a vast\r\naggregate--an aggregate such as it is impossible for a young mouse to\r\nreach, obliged as it is to begin physiological business in a small way.\r\nThen there is the character of the food in respect of its digestibility and\r\nits nutritiveness. Here, that which the creature takes in requires much\r\ngrinding-up, or, when duly prepared, contains but a small amount of\r\navailable matter in comparison with the matter that has to be thrown away;\r\nwhile there, the prey seized is almost pure nutriment, and requires but\r\nlittle trituration. Hence, in some cases, an unprofitable physiological\r\nbusiness, and in other cases a profitable one; resulting in small or large\r\nsupplies to the multiplying somatic cells. Further, there has to be noted\r\nthe grade of visceral development, which, if low, yields only crude\r\nnutriment slowly distributed, but which, if high, serves by its good\r\nappliances for solution, depuration, absorption, and circulation, to yield\r\nto the multiplying somatic cells a rich and pure blood. Then we come to an\r\nall-important factor, the cost of obtaining food. Here large expenditure of\r\nenergy in locomotion is necessitated, and there but little--here great\r\nefforts for small portions of food, and there small efforts for great\r\nportions: again resulting in physiological poverty or physiological wealth.\r\nNext, beyond the cost of nervo-muscular activities in foraging, there is\r\nthe cost of maintaining bodily heat. So much heat implies so much consumed\r\nnutriment, and the loss by radiation or conduction, which has perpetually\r\nto be made good, varies according to many circumstances--climate, medium\r\n(as air or water), covering, size of body (small cooling relatively faster\r\nthan large); and in proportion to the cost of maintaining heat is the\r\nabstraction from the supplies for cell-formation. Finally, there are three\r\nall-important co-operative factors, or rather laws of factors, the effects\r\nof which vary with the size of the animal. The first is that, while the\r\nmass of the body varies as the cubes of its dimensions (_proportions_ being\r\nsupposed constant), the absorbing surface varies as the squares of its\r\ndimensions; whence it results that, other things equal, increase of size\r\nimplies relative decrease of nutrition, and therefore increased obstacles\r\nto cell-multiplication.[109] The second is a further sequence from these\r\nlaws--namely, that while the weight of the body increases as the cubes of\r\nthe dimensions, the sectional areas of its muscles and bones increase as\r\ntheir squares; whence follows a decreasing power of resisting strains, and\r\na relative weakness of structure. This is implied in the ability of a small\r\nanimal to leap many times its own length, while a great animal, like the\r\nelephant, cannot leap at all: its bones and muscles being unable to bear\r\nthe stress which would be required to propel its body through the air. What\r\nincreasing cost of keeping together the bodily fabric is thus entailed, we\r\ncannot say; but that there is an increasing cost, which diminishes the\r\navailable, materials for increase of size, is beyond question.[110] And\r\nthen, in the third place, we have augmented expense of distribution of\r\nnutriment. The greater the size becomes, the more force must be exerted to\r\nsend blood to the periphery; and this once more entails deduction from the\r\ncell-forming matters.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have nine factors, several of them involving subdivisions,\r\nwhich co-operate in aiding or restraining cell-multiplication. They occur\r\nin endlessly varied proportions and combinations; so that every species\r\ndiffers more or less from every other in respect of their effects. But in\r\nall of them the co-operation is such as eventually arrests that\r\nmultiplication of cells which causes further growth; continues thereafter\r\nto entail slow decrease in cell-multiplication, accompanying decline of\r\nvital activities; and eventually brings cell-multiplication to an end. Now\r\na recognized principle of reasoning--the Law of Parsimony--forbids the\r\nassumption of more causes than are needful for explanation of phenomena;\r\nand since, in all such living aggregates as those above supposed, the\r\ncauses named inevitably bring about arrest of cell-multiplication, it is\r\nillegitimate to ascribe this arrest to some inherent property in the cells.\r\nInadequacy of the other causes must be shown before an inherent property\r\ncan be rightly assumed.\r\n\r\nFor this conclusion we find ample justification when we contemplate types\r\nof animals which lead lives that do not put such decided restraints on\r\ncell-multiplication. First let us take an instance of the extent to which\r\n(irrespective of natures of cells as reproductive or somatic)\r\ncell-multiplication may go, where the conditions render nutrition easy and\r\nreduce expenditure to a minimum. I refer to the case of the _Aphides_.\r\nThough it is early in the season (March), the hothouses at Kew have\r\nfurnished a sufficient number of these to show that twelve of them weigh a\r\ngrain--a larger number than would be required were they full-sized. Citing\r\nProfessor Owen, who adopts the calculations of Tougard to the effect that\r\nby agamic multiplication \"a single impregnated ovum of _Aphis_ may give\r\nrise, without fecundation, to a quintillion of _Aphides_,\" Professor Huxley\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n  \"I will assume that an Aphis weighs 1/1000 of a grain, which is certainly\r\n  vastly under the mark. A quintillion of _Aphides_ will, on this estimate,\r\n  weigh a quatrillion of grains. He is a very stout man who weighs two\r\n  million grains; consequently the tenth brood alone, if all its members\r\n  survive the perils to which they are exposed, contains more substance\r\n  than 500,000,000 stout men--to say the least, more than the whole\r\n  population of China!\"[111]\r\n\r\nAnd had Professor Huxley taken the actual weight, one-twelfth of a grain,\r\nthe quintillion of _Aphides_ would evidently far outweigh the whole human\r\npopulation of the globe: five billions of tons being the weight, as brought\r\nout by my own calculation! Of course I do not cite this in proof of the\r\nextent to which multiplication of somatic cells, descending from a single\r\novum, may go; because it will be contended, with some reason, that each of\r\nthe sexless _Aphides_, viviparously produced, arose by fission of a cell\r\nwhich had descended from the original reproductive cell. I cite it merely\r\nto show that when the cell-products of a fertilized ovum are perpetually\r\ndivided and subdivided into small groups, distributed over an unlimited\r\nnutritive area, so that they can get materials for growth at no cost, and\r\nexpend nothing appreciable in motion or maintenance of temperature,\r\ncell-production may go on without limit. For the agamic multiplication of\r\n_Aphides_ has been shown to continue for four years, and to all appearance\r\nwould be ceaseless were the temperature and supply of food continued\r\nwithout break. But now let us pass to analogous illustrations of cause and\r\nconsequence, open to no criticism of the kind just indicated. They are\r\nfurnished by various kinds of _Entozoa_, of which take the _Trematoda_,\r\ninfesting molluscs and fishes. Of one of them we read:--\"_Gyrodactylus_\r\nmultiplies agamically by the development of a young Trematode within the\r\nbody, as a sort of internal bud. A second generation appears within the\r\nfirst, and even a third within the second, before the young _Gyrodactylus_\r\nis born.\"[112] And the drawings of Steenstrup, in his _Alternation of\r\nGenerations_, show us, among creatures of this group, a sexless individual\r\nthe whole interior of which is transformed into smaller sexless\r\nindividuals, which severally, before or after their emergence, undergo\r\nsimilar transformations--a multiplication of somatic cells without any sign\r\nof reproductive cells. Under what circumstances do such modes of agamic\r\nmultiplication, variously modified among parasites, occur? They occur where\r\nthere is no expenditure whatever in motion or maintenance of temperature,\r\nand where nutriment surrounds the body on all sides. Other instances are\r\nfurnished by groups in which, though the nutriment is not abundant, the\r\ncost of living is almost unappreciable. Among the _Coelenterata_ there are\r\nthe Hydroid Polyps, simple and compound; and among the _Mollusca_ we have\r\nvarious types of Ascidians, fixed and floating, _Botryllidæ_ and _Salpæ_.\r\n\r\nBut now from these low animals in which sexless reproduction, and continued\r\nmultiplication of somatic cells, is common, and one class of which is named\r\n\"zoophytes,\" because its form of life simulates that of plants, let us pass\r\nto plants themselves. In these there is no expenditure in effort, there is\r\nno expenditure in maintaining temperature, and the food, some of it\r\nsupplied by the earth, is the rest of it supplied by a medium which\r\neverywhere bathes the outer surface: the utilization of its contained\r\nmaterial being effected _gratis_ by the Sun's rays. Just as was to be\r\nexpected, we here find that agamogenesis may go on without end. Numerous\r\nplants and trees are propagated to an unlimited extent by cuttings and\r\nbuds; and we have sundry plants which cannot be otherwise propagated. The\r\nmost familiar are the double roses of our gardens: these do not seed, and\r\nyet have been distributed everywhere by grafts and buds. Hothouses furnish\r\nmany cases, as I learn from an authority second to none. Of \"the whole host\r\nof tropical orchids, for instance, not one per cent. has ever seeded, and\r\nsome have been a century under cultivation.\" Again, we have the _Acorus\r\ncalamus_, \"that has hardly been known to seed anywhere, though it is found\r\nwild all over the north temperate hemisphere.\" And then there is the\r\nconspicuous and conclusive case of _Eloidea Canadensis_ (alias\r\n_Anacharis_,) introduced no one knows how (probably with timber), and first\r\nobserved in 1847, in several places; and which, having since spread over\r\nnearly all England, now everywhere infests ponds, canals, and slow rivers.\r\nThe plant is dioecious, and only the female exists here. Beyond all\r\nquestion, therefore, this vast progeny of the first slip or fragment\r\nintroduced, sufficient to cover many square miles were it put together, is\r\nconstituted entirely of somatic cells. Hence, as far as we can judge, these\r\nsomatic cells are immortal in the sense given to the word by Professor\r\nWeismann; and the evidence that they are so is immeasurably stronger than\r\nthe evidence which leads him to assert immortality for the\r\nfissiparously-multiplying _Protozoa_. This endless multiplication of\r\nsomatic cells has been going on under the eyes of numerous observers for\r\nforty odd years. What observer has watched for forty years to see whether\r\nthe fissiparous multiplication of _Protozoa_ does not cease? What observer\r\nhas watched for one year, or one month, or one week?[113]\r\n\r\nEven were not Professor Weismann's theory disposed of by this evidence, it\r\nmight be disposed of by a critical examination of his own evidence, using\r\nhis own tests. Clearly, if we are to measure relative mortalities, we must\r\nassume the conditions to be the same and must use the same measure. Let us\r\ndo this with some appropriate animal--say Man, as the most open to\r\nobservation. The mortality of the somatic cells constituting the mass of\r\nthe human body, is, according to Professor Weismann, shown by the decline\r\nand final cessation of cell-multiplication in its various organs. Suppose\r\nwe apply this test to all the organs: not to those only in which there\r\ncontinually arise bile-cells, epithelium-cells, &c., but to those also in\r\nwhich there arise reproductive cells. What do we find? That the\r\nmultiplication of these last comes to an end long before the multiplication\r\nof the first. In a healthy woman, the cells which constitute the various\r\nactive tissues of the body, continue to grow and multiply for many years\r\nafter germ-cells have died out. If similarly measured, then, these cells of\r\nthe last class prove to be more mortal than those of the first. But\r\nProfessor Weismann uses a different measure for the two classes of cells.\r\nPassing over the illegitimacy of this proceeding, let us accept his other\r\nmode of measurement, and see what comes of it. As described by him, absence\r\nof death among the _Protozoa_ is implied by that unceasing division and\r\nsubdivision of which they are said to be capable. Fission continued without\r\nend, is the definition of the immortality he speaks of. Apply this\r\nconception to the reproductive cells in a _Metazoon_. That the immense\r\nmajority of them do not multiply without end, we have already seen: with\r\nvery rare exceptions they die and disappear without result, and they cease\r\ntheir multiplication while the body as a whole still lives. But what of\r\nthose extremely exceptional ones which, as being actually instrumental to\r\nthe maintenance of the species, are alone contemplated by Professor\r\nWeismann? Do these continue their fissiparous multiplications without end?\r\nBy no means. The condition under which alone they preserve a qualified form\r\nof existence, is that, instead of one becoming two, two become one. A\r\nmember of series A and a member of series B, coalesce; and so lose their\r\nindividualities. Now, obviously, if the immortality of a series is shown if\r\nits members divide and subdivide perpetually, then the opposite of\r\nimmortality is shown when, instead of division, there is union. Each series\r\nends, and there is initiated a new series, differing more or less from\r\nboth. Thus the assertion that the reproductive cells are immortal, can be\r\ndefended only by changing the conception of immortality otherwise implied.\r\n\r\nEven apart from these last criticisms, however, we have clear disproof of\r\nthe alleged inherent difference between the two classes of cells. Among\r\nanimals, the multiplication of somatic cells is brought to an end by sundry\r\nrestraining conditions; but in various plants, where these restraining\r\nconditions are absent, the multiplication is unlimited.  It may, indeed, be\r\nsaid that the alleged distinction should be reversed; since the fissiparous\r\nmultiplication of reproductive cells is necessarily interrupted from time\r\nto time by coalescence, while that of the somatic cells may go on for a\r\ncentury without being interrupted.\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nIn the essay to which this is a postscript, conclusions were drawn from the\r\nremarkable case of the horse and the quagga, there narrated, along with an\r\nanalogous case observed among pigs. These conclusions have since been\r\nconfirmed. I am much indebted to a distinguished correspondent who has\r\ndrawn my attention to verifying facts furnished by the offspring of whites\r\nand negroes in the United States. Referring to information given him many\r\nyears ago, he says:--\"It was to the effect that the children of white women\r\nby a white father, had been _repeatedly_ observed to show traces of black\r\nblood, in cases when the woman had previous connection with [_i. e._ a\r\nchild by] a negro.\" At the time I received this information, an American\r\nwas visiting me; and, on being appealed to, answered that in the United\r\nStates there was an established belief to this effect. Not wishing,\r\nhowever, to depend upon hearsay, I at once wrote to America to make\r\ninquiries. Professor Cope of Philadelphia has written to friends in the\r\nSouth, but has not yet sent me the results. Professor Marsh, the\r\ndistinguished palæontologist, of Yale, New Haven, who is also collecting\r\nevidence, sends a preliminary letter in which he says:--\"I do not myself\r\nknow of such a case, but have heard many statements that make their\r\nexistence probable. One instance, in Connecticut, is vouched for so\r\nstrongly by an acquaintance of mine, that I have good reason to believe it\r\nto be authentic.\"\r\n\r\nThat cases of the kind should not be frequently seen in the North,\r\nespecially nowadays, is of course to be expected. The first of the above\r\nquotations refers to facts observed in the South during slavery days; and\r\neven then, the implied conditions were naturally very infrequent. Dr. W. J.\r\nYoumans of New York has, on my behalf, interviewed several medical\r\nprofessors, who, though they have not themselves met with instances, say\r\nthat the alleged result, described above, \"is generally accepted as a\r\nfact.\" But he gives me what I think must be regarded as authoritative\r\ntestimony. It is a quotation from the standard work of Professor Austin\r\nFlint, and runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n  \"A peculiar and, it seems to me, an inexplicable fact is, that previous\r\n  pregnancies have an influence upon offspring. This is well known to\r\n  breeders of animals. If pure-blooded mares or bitches have been once\r\n  covered by an inferior male, in subsequent fecundations the young are\r\n  likely to partake of the character of the first male, even if they be\r\n  afterwards bred with males of unimpeachable pedigree. What the mechanism\r\n  of the influence of the first conception is, it is impossible to say; but\r\n  the fact is incontestable. The same influence is observed in the human\r\n  subject. A woman may have, by a second husband, children who resemble a\r\n  former husband, and this is particularly well marked in certain instances\r\n  by the colour of the hair and eyes. A white woman who has had children by\r\n  a negro may subsequently bear children to a white man, these children\r\n  presenting some of the unmistakable peculiarities of the negro\r\n  race.\"[114]\r\n\r\nDr. Youmans called on Professor Flint, who remembered \"investigating the\r\nsubject at the time his larger work was written [the above is from an\r\nabridgment], and said that he had never heard the statement questioned.\"\r\n\r\nSome days before I received this letter and its contained quotation, the\r\nremembrance of a remark I heard many years ago concerning dogs, led to the\r\ninquiry whether they furnished analogous evidence. It occurred to me that a\r\nfriend who is frequently appointed judge of animals at agricultural shows,\r\nMr. Fookes, of Fairfield, Pewsey, Wiltshire, might know something about the\r\nmatter. A letter to him brought various confirmatory statements. From one\r\n\"who had bred dogs for many years\" he learnt that--\r\n\r\n  \"It is a well known and admitted fact that if a bitch has two litters by\r\n  two different dogs, the character of the first father is sure to be\r\n  perpetuated in any litters she may afterwards have, no matter how\r\n  pure-bred a dog may be the begetter.\"\r\n\r\nAfter citing this testimony, Mr. Fookes goes on to give illustrations known\r\nto himself.\r\n\r\n  \"A friend of mine near this had a very valuable Dachshund bitch, which\r\n  most unfortunately had a litter by a stray sheep-dog. The next year her\r\n  owner sent her on a visit to a pure Dachshund dog, but the produce took\r\n  quite as much of the first father as the second, and the next year he\r\n  sent her to another Dachshund with the same result. Another case:--A\r\n  friend of mine in Devizes had a litter of puppies, unsought for, by a\r\n  setter from a favourite pointer bitch, and after this she never bred any\r\n  true pointers, no matter of what the paternity was.\"\r\n\r\n  [Since the publication of this article additional evidences have come to\r\n  hand. One is from the late Prof. Riley, State Entomologist at Washington,\r\n  who says that telegony is an \"established principle among well-educated\r\n  farmers\" in the United States, and who gives me a case in horse-breeding\r\n  to which he was himself witness.\r\n\r\n  Mr. W. P. Smith, writing from Stoughton Grange, Guildford, but giving the\r\n  results of his experiences in America, says that \"the fact of a previous\r\n  conception influencing subsequent offspring was so far recognised among\r\n  American cattle-breeders\" that it was proposed to raise the rank of any\r\n  heifer that had borne a first calf by a thoroughbred bull, and though\r\n  this resolution when brought before one of the chief societies was not\r\n  carried, yet on all sides it was admitted that previous conceptions had\r\n  effects of the kind alleged. Mr. Smith in another letter says:--\"When I\r\n  had a large mule and horse ranche in America I noticed that the foals of\r\n  mares by horse stallions had a mulish appearance in those cases where the\r\n  mare had previously given birth to a mule foal. Common heifers who have\r\n  had calves by a thoroughbred bull are apt thereafter to have well-bred\r\n  calves even from the veriest scrubs.\"\r\n\r\n  Yet another very interesting piece of evidence is furnished by Mr. W.\r\n  Sedgwick, M.R.C.S., in an article on \"The Influence of Heredity in\r\n  Disease,\" published in the _British Medical Journal_ for Feb. 22, 1896,\r\n  pp. 460-2. It concerns the transmission of a malformation known among\r\n  medical men as hypospadias. Referring to a man belonging to a family in\r\n  which this defect prevailed, he writes:--\"The widow of the man from whom\r\n  these three generations of hypospadians were descended married again,\r\n  after an interval of eighteen months; and in this instance the second\r\n  husband was not only free from the defect, but there was no history of it\r\n  in his family. By this second marriage she had four hypospadiac sons and\r\n  four hypospadiac grandsons; whilst there were seven grandsons and three\r\n  great-grandsons who were not malformed.\"]\r\n\r\nComing from remote places, from those who have no theory to support, and\r\nwho are some of them astonished by the unexpected phenomena, the agreement\r\ndissipates all doubt. In four kinds of mammals, widely divergent in their\r\nnatures--man, horse, dog, and pig--we have this same seemingly-anomalous\r\nkind of heredity, made visible under analogous conditions. We must take it\r\nas a demonstrated fact that, during gestation, traits of constitution\r\ninherited from the father produce effects upon the constitution of the\r\nmother; and that these communicated effects are transmitted by her to\r\nsubsequent offspring. We are supplied with an absolute disproof of\r\nProfessor Weismann's doctrine that the reproductive cells are independent\r\nof, and uninfluenced by, the somatic cells; and there disappears absolutely\r\nthe alleged obstacle to the transmission of acquired characters.\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding experiences showing the futility of controversy for the\r\nestablishment of truth, I am tempted here to answer opponents at some\r\nlength. But even could the editor allow me the needful space, I should be\r\ncompelled, both by lack of time and by ill-health, to be brief. I must\r\ncontent myself with noticing a few points which most nearly concern me.\r\n\r\nReferring to my argument respecting tactual discriminativeness, Mr. Wallace\r\nthinks that I--\r\n\r\n  \"afford a glaring example of taking the unessential in place of the\r\n  essential, and drawing conclusions from a partial and altogether\r\n  insufficient survey of the phenomena. For this 'tactual\r\n  discriminativeness,' which is alone dealt with by Mr. Spencer, forms the\r\n  least important, and probably only an incidental portion of the great\r\n  vital phenomenon of skin-sensitiveness, which is at once the watchman and\r\n  the shield of the organism against imminent external dangers.\"\r\n  (_Fortnightly Review_, April, 1893, p. 497)\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Wallace assumes it to be self-evident that skin-sensitiveness is\r\ndue to natural selection, and assumes that this must be admitted by me. He\r\nsupposes it is only the unequal distribution of skin-discriminativeness\r\nwhich I contend is not thus accounted for. But I deny that either the\r\ngeneral sensitiveness or the special sensitiveness results from natural\r\nselection; and I have years ago justified the first disbelief as I have\r\nrecently the second. In \"The Factors of Organic Evolution\" (_Essays_,\r\n454-8), I have given various reasons for inferring that the genesis of the\r\nnervous system cannot be due to survival of the fittest; but that it is due\r\nto the direct effects of converse between the surface and the environment;\r\nand that thus only is to be explained the strange fact that the nervous\r\ncentres are originally superficial, and migrate inwards during development.\r\nThese conclusions I have, in the essay Mr. Wallace criticizes, upheld by\r\nthe evidence which blind boys and skilled compositors furnish; proving, as\r\nthis does, that increased nervous development is peripherally initiated.\r\nMr. Wallace's belief that skin-sensitiveness arose by natural selection, is\r\nunsupported by a single fact. He assumes that it _must_ have been so\r\nproduced because it is all-important to self-preservation. My belief that\r\nit is directly initiated by converse with the environment, is supported by\r\nfacts; and I have given proof that the assigned cause is now in operation.\r\nAm I called upon to abandon my own supported belief and accept Mr.\r\nWallace's unsupported belief? I think not.\r\n\r\nReferring to my argument concerning blind cave-animals, Professor\r\nLankester, in _Nature_ of February 23, 1893, writes:--\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. Spencer shows that the saving of ponderable material in the\r\n  suppression of an eye is but a small economy: he loses sight of the fact,\r\n  however, that possibly, or even probably, the saving to the organism in\r\n  the reduction of an eye to a rudimentary state is not to be measured by\r\n  mere bulk, but by the non-expenditure of special materials and special\r\n  activities which are concerned in the production of an organ so peculiar\r\n  and elaborate as is the vertebrate eye.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that a supposition is here made to do duty as a fact; and\r\nthat I might with equal propriety say that \"possibly, or even probably,\"\r\nthe vertebrate eye is physiologically cheap: its optical part, constituting\r\nnearly its whole bulk, consisting of a low order of tissue. There is,\r\nindeed, strong reason for considering it physiologically cheap. If any one\r\nremembers how relatively enormous are the eyes of a fish just out of the\r\negg--a pair of eyes with a body and head attached; and if he then remembers\r\nthat every egg contains material for such a pair of eyes; he will see that\r\neye-material constitutes a very considerable part of the fish's roe; and\r\nthat, since the female fish provides this quantity every year, it cannot be\r\nexpensive. My argument against Weismann is strengthened rather than\r\nweakened by contemplation of these facts.\r\n\r\nProfessor Lankester asks my attention to a hypothesis of his own, published\r\nin the _Encyclopædia Britannica_, concerning the production of blind\r\ncave-animals. He thinks it can--\r\n\r\n  \"be fully explained by natural selection acting on congenital fortuitous\r\n  variations. Many animals are thus born with distorted or defective eyes\r\n  whose parents have not had their eyes submitted to any peculiar\r\n  conditions. Supposing a number of some species of Arthropod or Fish to be\r\n  swept into a cavern or to be carried from less to greater depths in the\r\n  sea, those individuals with perfect eyes would follow the glimmer of\r\n  light and eventually escape to the outer air or the shallower depths,\r\n  leaving behind those with imperfect eyes to breed in the dark place. A\r\n  natural selection would thus be effected\" in successive generations.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I demur to the words \"many animals.\" Under the abnormal\r\nconditions of domestication, congenitally defective eyes may be not very\r\nuncommon; but their occurrence under natural conditions is, I fancy,\r\nextremely rare. Supposing, however, that in a shoal of young fish, there\r\noccur some with eyes seriously defective. What will happen? Vision is\r\nall-important to the young fish, both for obtaining food and for escaping\r\nfrom enemies. This is implied by the immense development of eyes just\r\nreferred to; and the obvious conclusion to be drawn is that the partially\r\nblind would disappear. Considering that out of the enormous number of young\r\nfish hatched with perfect eyes, not one in a hundred reaches maturity, what\r\nchance of surviving would there be for those with imperfect eyes?\r\nInevitably they would be starved or be snapped up. Hence the chances that a\r\nmatured or partially matured semi-blind fish, or rather two such, male and\r\nfemale, would be swept into a cave and left behind are extremely remote.\r\nStill more remote must the chances be in the case of cray-fish. Sheltering\r\nthemselves as these do under stones, in crevices, and in burrows which they\r\nmake in the banks, and able quickly to anchor themselves to weeds or sticks\r\nby their claws, it seems scarcely supposable that any of them could be\r\ncarried into a cave by a flood. What, then, is the probability that there\r\nwill be two nearly blind ones, and that these will be thus carried? Then,\r\nafter this first extreme improbability, there comes a second, which we may,\r\nI think, rather call an impossibility. How would it be possible for\r\ncreatures subject to so violent a change of habitat to survive? Surely\r\ndeath would quickly follow the subjection to such utterly unlike conditions\r\nand modes of life. The existence of these blind cave-animals can be\r\naccounted for only by supposing that their remote ancestors began making\r\nexcursions into the cave, and, finding it profitable, extended them,\r\ngeneration after generation, further in: undergoing the required\r\nadaptations little by little.[115]\r\n\r\nBetween Dr. Romanes and myself the first difference concerns the\r\ninterpretation of \"Panmixia.\" Clearer conceptions of these matters would be\r\nreached if, instead of thinking in abstract terms, the physiological\r\nprocesses concerned were brought into the foreground. Beyond the production\r\nof changes in the sizes of parts by the selection of fortuitously-arising\r\nvariations, I can see but one other cause for the production of them--the\r\ncompetition among the parts for nutriment. This has the effect that active\r\nparts are well-supplied and grow, while inactive parts are ill-supplied and\r\ndwindle.[116] This competition is the cause of \"economy of growth\"; this is\r\nthe cause of decrease from disuse; and this is the only conceivable cause\r\nof that decrease which Dr. Romanes contends follows the cessation of\r\nselection. The three things are aspects of the same thing. And now, before\r\nleaving this question, let me remark on the strange proposition which has\r\nto be defended by those who deny the dwindling of organs from disuse. Their\r\nproposition amounts to this:--that for a hundred generations an inactive\r\norgan may be partially denuded of blood all through life, and yet in the\r\nhundredth generation will be produced of just the same size as in the\r\nfirst!\r\n\r\nThere is one other passage in Dr. Romanes' criticism--that concerning the\r\ninfluence of a previous sire on progeny--which calls for comment. He sets\r\ndown what he supposes Weismann will say in response to my argument. \"First,\r\nhe may question the fact.\" Well, after the additional evidence given above,\r\nI think he is not likely to do that; unless, indeed, it be that along with\r\nreadiness to base conclusions on things \"it is easy to imagine\" there goes\r\nreluctance to accept testimony which it is difficult to doubt. Second, he\r\nis supposed to reply that \"the Germ-plasm of the first sire has in some way\r\nor another become partly commingled with that of the immature ova\"; and Dr.\r\nRomanes goes on to describe how there may be millions of spermatozoa and\r\n\"thousands of millions\" of their contained \"ids\" around the ovaries, to\r\nwhich these secondary effects are due. But, on the one hand, he does not\r\nexplain why in such cases each subsequent ovum, as it becomes matured, is\r\nnot fertilized by the sperm-cells present, or their contained germ-plasm,\r\nrendering all subsequent fecundations needless; and, on the other hand, he\r\ndoes not explain why, if this does not happen, the potency of this\r\nremaining germ-plasm is nevertheless such as to affect not only the next\r\nsucceeding offspring, but all subsequent offspring. The irreconcilability\r\nof these two implications would, I think, sufficiently dispose of the\r\nsupposition, even had we not daily multitudinous proofs that the surface of\r\na mammalian ovarium is not a spermatheca. The third reply Dr. Romanes\r\nurges, is the inconceivability of the process by which the germ-plasm of a\r\npreceding male parent affects the constitution of the female and her\r\nsubsequent offspring. In response, I have to ask why he piles up a mountain\r\nof difficulties based on the assumption that Mr. Darwin's explanation of\r\nheredity by \"Pangenesis\" is the only available explanation preceding that\r\nof Weismann? and why he presents these difficulties to me, more especially;\r\ndeliberately ignoring my own hypothesis of physiological units? It cannot\r\nbe that he is ignorant of this hypothesis, since the work in which it is\r\nvariously set forth (_Principles of Biology_, §§ 66-97) is one with which\r\nhe is well acquainted: witness his _Scientific Evidences of Organic\r\nEvolution_; and he has had recent reminders of it in Weismann's\r\n_Germ-plasm_, where it is repeatedly referred to. Why, then, does he assume\r\nthat I abandon my own hypothesis and adopt that of Darwin; thereby\r\nentangling myself in difficulties which my own hypothesis avoids? If, as I\r\nhave argued, the germ-plasm consists of substantially similar units (having\r\nonly those minute differences expressive of individual and ancestral\r\ndifferences of structure), none of the complicated requirements which Dr.\r\nRomanes emphasizes exist; and the alleged inconceivability disappears.\r\n\r\nHere I must end: not intending to say more, unless for some very urgent\r\nreason; and leaving others to carry on the discussion. I have, indeed, been\r\nled to suspend for a short time my proper work, only by consciousness of\r\nthe transcendent importance of the question at issue. As I have before\r\ncontended, a right answer to the question whether acquired characters are\r\nor are not inherited, underlies right beliefs, not only in Biology and\r\nPsychology, but also in Education, Ethics, and Politics.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nAs a species of literature, controversy is characterised by a terrible\r\nfertility. Each proposition becomes the parent of half a dozen; so that a\r\nfew replies and rejoinders produce an unmanageable population of issues,\r\nold and new, which end in being a nuisance to everybody. Remembering this,\r\nI shall refrain from dealing with all the points of Professor Weismann's\r\nanswer. I must limit myself to a part; and that there may be no suspicion\r\nof a selection convenient to myself, I will take those contained in his\r\nfirst article.\r\n\r\nBefore dealing with his special arguments, let me say something about the\r\ngeneral mode of argument which Professor Weismann adopts.\r\n\r\nThe title of his article is \"The All-Sufficiency of Natural\r\nSelection.\"[117] Very soon, however, as on p. 322, we come to the\r\nadmission, which he has himself italicised, \"that _it is really very\r\ndifficult to imagine this process of natural selection in its details_; and\r\nto this day it is impossible to demonstrate it in any one point.\"\r\nElsewhere, as on pp. 327 and 336 _à propos_ of other cases, there are like\r\nadmissions. But now if the sufficiency of an assigned cause cannot in any\r\ncase be demonstrated, and if it is \"really very difficult to imagine\" in\r\nwhat way it has produced its alleged effects, what becomes of the\r\n\"all-sufficiency\" of the cause? How can its all-sufficiency be alleged when\r\nits action can neither be demonstrated nor easily imagined? Evidently to\r\nfit Professor Weismann's argument the title of the article should have been\r\n\"The Doubtful Sufficiency of Natural Selection.\"\r\n\r\nObserve, again, how entirely opposite are the ways in which he treats his\r\nown interpretation and the antagonist interpretation. He takes the problem\r\npresented by certain beautifully adapted structures on the anterior legs of\r\n\"very many insects,\" which they use for cleansing their antennæ. These, he\r\nargues, cannot have resulted from the inheritance of acquired characters;\r\nsince any supposed changes produced by function would be changes in the\r\nchitinous exo-skeleton, which, being a dead substance, cannot have had its\r\nchanges transmitted. He then proceeds, very candidly, to point out the\r\nextreme difficulties which lie in the way of supposing these structures to\r\nhave resulted from natural selection: admitting that an opponent might \"say\r\nthat it was absurd\" to assume that the successive small variations implied\r\nwere severally life-saving in their effects. Nevertheless, he holds it\r\nunquestionable that natural selection has been the cause. See then the\r\ndifference. The supposition that the apparatus has been produced by the\r\ninheritance of acquired characters is rejected _because_ it presents\r\ninsuperable difficulties. But the supposition that the apparatus has been\r\nproduced by natural selection is accepted, _though_ it presents insuperable\r\ndifficulties. If this mode of reasoning is allowable, no fair comparison\r\nbetween diverse hypotheses can be made.\r\n\r\nWith these remarks on Professor Weismann's method at large, let me now pass\r\nto the particular arguments he uses, taking them _seriatim_.\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nThe first case he deals with is that of the progressive degradation of the\r\nhuman little toe. This he considers a good test case; and he proceeds to\r\ndiscuss an assigned cause--the inherited and accumulated effects of\r\nboot-pressure. Without much difficulty he shows that this interpretation is\r\ninadequate; since fusion of the phalanges, which constitutes in part the\r\nprogressive degradation, is found among peoples who go barefoot, and has\r\nbeen found also in Egyptian mummies. Having thus disposed of Mr. Buckman's\r\ninterpretation, Professor Weismann forthwith concludes that the ascription\r\nof this anatomical change to the inheritance of acquired characters is\r\ndisposed of, and assumes, as the only other possible interpretation, a\r\ndwindling \"through panmixia\": \"the hereditary degeneration of the little\r\ntoe is thus quite simply explained from my standpoint.\"\r\n\r\nIt is surprising that Professor Weismann should not have seen that there is\r\nan explanation against which his criticism does not tell. If we go back to\r\nthe genesis of the human type from some lower type of _primates_, we see\r\nthat while the little toe has ceased to be of any use for climbing\r\npurposes, it has not come into any considerable use for walking and\r\nrunning. A glance at the feet of the sub-human _primates_ in general, shows\r\nthat the inner digits are, as compared with those of men, quite small, have\r\nno such relative length and massiveness as the human great toes. Leaving\r\nout the question of cause, it is manifest that the great toes have been\r\nimmensely developed, since there took place the change from arboreal habits\r\nto terrestrial habits. A study of the mechanics of walking shows why this\r\nhas happened. Stability requires that the \"line of direction\" (the vertical\r\nline let fall from the centre of gravity) shall fall within the base, and,\r\nin walking, shall be brought at each step within the area of support, or so\r\nnear it that any tendency to fall may be checked at the next step. A\r\nnecessary result is that if, at each step, the chief stress of support is\r\nthrown on the outer side of the foot, the body must be swayed so that the\r\n\"line of direction\" may fall within the outer side of the foot, or close to\r\nit; and when the next step is taken it must be similarly swayed in an\r\nopposite way, so that the outer side of the other foot may bear the weight.\r\nThat is to say, the body must oscillate from side to side, or waddle. The\r\nmovements of a duck when walking or running show what happens when the\r\npoints of support are wide apart. Clearly this kind of movement conflicts\r\nwith efficient locomotion. There is a waste of muscular energy in making\r\nthese lateral movements, and they are at variance with the forward\r\nmovement. We may infer, then, that the developing man profited by throwing\r\nthe stress as much as possible on the inner sides of the feet; and was\r\nespecially led to do this when going fast, which enabled him to abridge the\r\noscillations: as indeed we now see in a drunken man. Thus there was thrown\r\na continually increasing stress upon the inner digits as they progressively\r\ndeveloped from the effects of use; until now that the inner digits, so\r\nlarge compared with the others, bear the greater part of the weight, and\r\nbeing relatively near one another, render needless any marked swayings from\r\nside to side. But what has meanwhile happened to the outer digits?\r\nEvidently as fast as the great toes have come more and more into play and\r\ndeveloped, the little toes have gone more and more out of play and have\r\nbeen dwindling for--how long shall we say?--perhaps a hundred thousand\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nSo far, then, am I from feeling that Professor Weismann has here raised a\r\ndifficulty in the way of the doctrine I hold, that I feel indebted to him\r\nfor having drawn attention to a very strong evidence in its support. This\r\nmodification in the form of the foot, which has occurred since arboreal\r\nhabits have given place to terrestrial habits, shows the effects of use and\r\ndisuse simultaneously. The inner digits have increased by use while the\r\nouter digits have decreased by disuse.\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nSaying that he will not \"pause to refute other apparent proofs of the\r\ntransmission of acquired characters,\" Professor Weismann proceeds to deal\r\nwith the argument which, with various illustrations, I have several times\r\nurged--the argument that the natural selection of fortuitously-arising\r\nvariations cannot account for the adjustment of co-operative parts. Very\r\nclearly and very fairly he summarises this argument as used in _The\r\nPrinciples of Biology_ in 1864. Admitting that in this case there are\r\n\"enormous difficulties\" in the way of any other interpretation than the\r\ninheritance of acquired characters, Professor Weismann before proceeding to\r\nassault this \"last bulwark of the Lamarckian principle,\" premises that the\r\ninheritance of acquired characters cannot be a cause of change because\r\ninactive as well as active parts degenerate when they cease to be of use:\r\ninstancing the \"skin and skin-armature of crabs and insects.\" On this I may\r\nremark in the first place that an argument derived from degeneracy of\r\npassive structures scarcely meets the case of development of active\r\nstructures; and I may remark in the second place that I have never dreamt\r\nof denying the efficiency of natural selection as a cause of degeneracy in\r\npassive structures when the degeneracy is such as aids the prosperity of\r\nthe stirp.\r\n\r\nMaking this parenthetical reply to his parenthetical criticism I pass to\r\nhis discussion of this particular argument which he undertakes to dispose\r\nof.\r\n\r\nHis _cheval de bataille_ is furnished him by the social insects--not a\r\nfresh one, however, as might be supposed from the way in which he mounts\r\nit. From time to time it has carried other riders, who have couched their\r\nlances with fatal effects as they supposed. But I hope to show that no one\r\nof them has unhorsed an antagonist, and that Professor Weismann fails to do\r\nthis just as completely as his predecessors. I am, indeed, not sorry that\r\nhe has afforded me the opportunity of criticising the general discussion\r\nconcerning the peculiarities of these interesting creatures, which it has\r\noften seemed to me sets out with illegitimate assumptions. The supposition\r\nalways is that the specialities of structures and instincts in the unlike\r\nclasses of their communities, have arisen during the period in which the\r\ncommunities have existed in something like their present forms. This cannot\r\nbe. It is doubtless true that association without differentiations of\r\nclasses may pre-exist for co-operative purposes, as among wolves, and as\r\namong various insects which swarm under certain circumstances. Hence we may\r\nsuppose that there arise in some cases permanent swarms--that survival of\r\nthe fittest will establish these constant swarms where they are\r\nadvantageous. But admitting this, we have also to admit a gradual rise of\r\nthe associated state out of the solitary state. Wasps and bees present us\r\nwith gradations. If, then, we are to understand how the organized societies\r\nhave arisen, either out of the solitary state or out of undifferentiated\r\nswarms, we must assume that the differences of structure and instinct among\r\nthe members of them arose little by little, as the social organization\r\narose little by little. Fortunately we are able to trace the greater part\r\nof the process in the annually-formed communities of the common wasp; and\r\nwe shall recognize in it an all-important factor (ignored by Professor\r\nWeismann) to which the phenomena, or at any rate the greater part of them,\r\nare due.\r\n\r\nBut before describing the wasp's annual history, let me set down certain\r\nobservations made when, as a boy, I was given to angling, and, in July or\r\nAugust, sometimes used for bait \"wasp-grubs,\" as they were called. After\r\nhaving had two or three days the combs or \"cakes\" of these, full of unfed\r\nlarvæ in all stages of growth, I often saw some of them devouring the edges\r\nof their cells to satisfy their appetites; and saw others, probably the\r\nmost advanced in growth, which were spinning the little covering caps to\r\ntheir cells, in preparation for assuming the pupa state. It is to be\r\ninferred that if, after a certain stage of growth has been reached, the\r\nfood-supply becomes inadequate or is stopped altogether, the larva\r\nundergoes its transformation prematurely; and, as we shall presently see,\r\nthis premature transformation has several natural sequences.\r\n\r\nLet us return now to the wasp's family history. In the spring, a queen-wasp\r\nor mother-wasp which has survived the winter, begins to make a small nest\r\ncontaining four or more cells in which she lays eggs, and as fast as she\r\nbuilds additional cells, she lays an egg in each. Presently, to these\r\nactivities, is added the feeding of the larvæ: one result being that the\r\nmultiplication of larvæ involves a restriction of the food that can be\r\ngiven to each. If we suppose that the mother-wasp rears no more larvæ than\r\nshe can fully feed, there will result queens or mothers like herself,\r\nrelatively few in number. But if we suppose that, laying more numerous eggs\r\nshe produces more larvæ than she can fully feed, the result will be that\r\nwhen these have reached a certain stage of growth, inadequate supply of\r\nfood will be followed by premature retirement and transformation into pupæ.\r\nWhat will be the characters of the developed insects? The first effect of\r\narrested nutrition will be smaller size. This we find. A second effect will\r\nbe defective development of parts that are latest formed and least\r\nimportant for the survival of the individual. Hence we may look for\r\narrested development of the reproductive organs--non-essential to\r\nindividual life. And this expectation is in accord with what we see in\r\nanimal development at large; for (passing over entirely sexless\r\nindividuals) we see that though the reproductive organs may be marked out\r\nearly in the course of development, they are not made fit for action until\r\nafter the structures for carrying on individual life are nearly complete.\r\nThe implication is, then, that an inadequately-fed and small larva will\r\nbecome a sterile imago. Having noted this, let us pass to a remarkable\r\nconcomitant. In the course of development, organs are formed not alone in\r\nthe order of their original succession, but partly in the order of\r\nimportance and the share they have to take in adult activities--a change of\r\norder called by Haeckel \"heterochrony.\" Hence the fact that we often see\r\nthe maternal instinct precede the sexual instinct. Every little girl with\r\nher doll shows us that the one may become alive while the other remains\r\ndormant. In the case of wasps, then, premature arrest of development may\r\nresult in incompleteness of the sexual traits, along with completeness of\r\nthe maternal traits. What happens? Leave out the laying of eggs, and the\r\nenergies of the mother-wasp are spent wholly in building cells and feeding\r\nlarvæ, and the worker-wasp forthwith begins to spend its life in building\r\ncells and feeding larvæ. Thus interpreting the facts, we have no occasion\r\nto assume any constitutional difference between the eggs of worker-wasps\r\nand the eggs of queens; and that, their eggs are not different we see,\r\nfirst, in the fact that occasionally the worker-wasp is fertile and lays\r\ndrone-producing eggs, and we see secondly that (if in this respect they are\r\nlike the bees, of which, however, we have no proof) the larva of a\r\nworker-wasp can be changed into the larva of a queen-wasp by special\r\nfeeding. But be this as it may, we have good evidence that the feeding\r\ndetermines everything. Says Dr. Ormerod, in his _British Social Wasps_:--\r\n\r\n  \"When the swarm is strong and food plentiful ... the well fed larvæ\r\n  develop into females, full, large, and overflowing with fat. There are\r\n  all gradations of size, from the large fat female to the smallest\r\n  worker.... The larger the wasp, the larger and better developed, as the\r\n  rule, are the female organs, in all their details. In the largest wasps,\r\n  which are to be the queens of another year, the ovaries differ to all\r\n  appearances in nothing but their size from those of the larger worker\r\n  wasps.... Small feeble swarms produce few or no perfect females; but in\r\n  large strong swarms they are found by the score.\" (pp. 248-9)\r\n\r\nTo this evidence add the further evidence that queens and workers pass\r\nthrough certain parallel stages in respect of their maternal activities. At\r\nfirst the queen, besides laying eggs, builds cells and feeds larvæ, but\r\nafter a time ceases to build cells, and feeds larvæ only, and eventually\r\ndoing neither one nor the other, only lays eggs, and is supplied with food\r\nby the workers. So it is in part with the workers. While the members of\r\neach successive brood, when in full vigour, build cells and feed larvæ,\r\nby-and-by they cease to build cells, and only feed larvæ: the maternal\r\nactivities and instincts undergo analogous changes. In this case, then, we\r\nare not obliged to assume that only by a process of natural selection can\r\nthe differences of structure and instinct between queens and workers be\r\nproduced. The only way in which natural selection here comes into play is\r\nin the better survival of the families of those queens which made as many\r\ncells, and laid as many eggs, as resulted in the best number of half-fed\r\nlarvæ, producing workers; since by a rapid multiplication of workers the\r\nfamily is advantaged, and the ultimate production of more queens surviving\r\ninto the next year insured.\r\n\r\nThe differentiation of classes does not go far among the wasps, because the\r\ncycle of processes is limited to a year, or rather to the few months of the\r\nsummer. It goes further among the hive-bees, which, by storing food,\r\nsurvive from one year into the next. Unlike the queen-wasp, the queen-bee\r\nneither builds cells nor gathers food, but is fed by the workers: egg\r\nlaying has become her sole business. On the other hand the workers,\r\noccupied exclusively in building and nursing, have the reproductive organs\r\nmore dwarfed than they are in wasps. Still we see that the worker-bee\r\noccasionally lays drone-producing eggs, and that, by giving extra nutriment\r\nand the required extra space, a worker-larva can be developed into a\r\nqueen-larva. In respect to the leading traits, therefore, the same\r\ninterpretation holds. Doubtless there are subsidiary instincts which are\r\napparently not thus interpretable. But before it can be assumed that an\r\ninterpretation of another kind is necessary, it must be shown that these\r\ninstincts cannot be traced back to those pre-social types and semi-social\r\ntypes which must have preceded the social types we now see. For\r\nunquestionably existing bees must have brought with them from the\r\npre-social state an extensive endowment of instincts, and, acquiring other\r\ninstincts during the unorganized social state, must have brought these into\r\nthe present organized social state. It is clear, for instance, that the\r\ncell-building instinct in all its elaboration was mainly developed in the\r\npre-social stage; for the transition from species building solitary cells\r\nto those building combs is traceable. We are similarly enabled to account\r\nfor swarming as being an inheritance from remote ancestral types. For just\r\nin the same way that, with under-feeding of larvæ, there result individuals\r\nwith imperfectly developed reproductive systems, so there will result\r\nindividuals with imperfect sexual instincts; and just as the imperfect\r\nreproductive system partially operates upon occasion, so will the imperfect\r\nsexual instinct. Whence it will result that on the event which causes a\r\nqueen to undertake a nuptial flight which is effectual, the workers may\r\ntake abortive nuptial flights: so causing a swarm.\r\n\r\nAnd here, before going further, let us note an instructive class of facts\r\nrelated to the class of facts above set forth. Summing up, in a chapter on\r\n\"The Determination of Sex,\" an induction from many cases, Professor Geddes\r\nand Mr. Thompson remark that \"such conditions as deficient or abnormal\r\nfood,\" and others causing \"preponderance of waste over repair ... tend to\r\nresult in production of males;\" while \"abundant and rich nutrition\" and\r\nother conditions which \"favour constructive processes ... result in the\r\nproduction of females.\"[118] Among such evidences of this as immediately\r\nconcern us, are these:--J. H. Fabre found that in the nests of _Osmia\r\ntricornis_, eggs at the bottom, first laid, and accompanied by much food,\r\nproduced females, while those at the top, last laid, and accompanied by\r\none-half or one-third the quantity of food, produced males,[119] Huber's\r\nobservations on egg-laying by the honey-bee, show that in the normal course\r\nof things, the queen lays eggs of workers for eleven months, and only then\r\nlays eggs of drones: that is, when declining nutrition or exhaustion has\r\nset in. Further, we have the above-named fact, shown by wasps and bees,\r\nthat when workers lay eggs these produce drones only.[120] Special\r\nevidence, harmonizing with general evidence, thus proves that among the\r\nsocial insects the sex is determined by degree of nutrition while the egg\r\nis being formed. See then how congruous this evidence is with the\r\nconclusion above drawn; for it is proved that after an egg, predetermined\r\nas a female, has been laid, the character of the produced insect as a\r\nperfect female or imperfect female is determined by the nutrition of the\r\nlarva. _That is, one set of differences in structures and instincts is\r\ndetermined by nutrition before the egg is laid, and a further set of\r\ndifferences in structures and instincts is determined by nutrition after\r\nthe egg is laid._\r\n\r\nWe come now to the extreme case--that of the ants. Is it not probable that\r\nthe process of differentiation has been similar? There are sundry reasons\r\nfor thinking so. With ants as with wasps and bees--the workers occasionally\r\nlay eggs; and an ant-community can, like a bee-community, when need be,\r\nproduce queens out of worker-larvæ: presumably in the same manner by extra\r\nfeeding. But here we have to add special evidence of great significance.\r\nFor observe that the very facts concerning ants, which Professor Weismann\r\nnames as exemplifying the formation of the worker type by selection, serve,\r\nas in the case of wasps, to exemplify its formation by arrested nutrition.\r\nHe says that in several species the egg-tubes in the ovaries show\r\nprogressive decrease in number; and this, like the different degrees of\r\narrest in the ovaries of the worker-wasps, indicates arrest of\r\nlarva-feeding at different stages. He gives cases showing that, in\r\ndifferent degrees, the eyes of workers are less developed in the number of\r\ntheir facets than those of the perfect insects; and he also refers to the\r\nwings of workers as not being developed: remarking, however, that the\r\nrudiments of their wings show that the ancestral forms had wings. Are not\r\nthese traits also results of arrested nutrition? Generally among insects\r\nthe larvæ are either blind or have but rudimentary eyes; that is to say,\r\nvisual organs are among the latest organs to arise in the genesis of the\r\nperfect organism. Hence early arrest of nutrition will stop formation of\r\nthese, while various more ancient structures have become tolerably\r\ncomplete. Similarly with wings. Wings are late organs in insect phylogeny,\r\nand therefore will be among those most likely to abort where development is\r\nprematurely arrested. And both these traits will, for the same reason,\r\nnaturally go along with arrested development of the reproductive system.\r\nEven more significant, however, is some evidence assigned by Mr. Darwin\r\nrespecting the caste-gradations among the driver ants of West Africa. He\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n  \"But the most important fact for us is, that, though the workers can be\r\n  grouped into castes of different sizes, yet they graduate insensibly into\r\n  each other, as does the widely-different structure of their jaws.\"[121]\r\n\r\n\"Graduate insensibly,\" he says; implying that there are very numerous\r\nintermediate forms. This is exactly what is to be expected if arrest of\r\nnutrition be the cause; for unless the ants have definite measures,\r\nenabling them to stop feeding at just the same stages, it must happen that\r\nthe stoppage of feeding will be indefinite; and that, therefore, there will\r\nbe all gradations between the extreme forms--\"insensible gradations,\" both\r\nin size and in jaw-structure.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with this interpretation, consider now that of Professor\r\nWeismann. From whichever of the two possible suppositions he sets out, the\r\nresult is equally fatal. If he is consistent, he must say that each of\r\nthese intermediate forms of workers must have its special set of\r\n\"determinants,\" causing its special set of modifications of organs; for he\r\ncannot assume that while perfect females and the extreme types of workers\r\nhave their different sets of determinants, the intermediate types of\r\nworkers have not. Hence we are introduced to the strange conclusion that\r\nbesides the markedly-distinguished sets of determinants there must be, to\r\nproduce these intermediate forms, many other sets slightly distinguished\r\nfrom one another--a score or more kinds of germ-plasm in addition to the\r\nfour chief kinds. Next comes an introduction to the still stranger\r\nconclusion, that these numerous kinds of germ-plasm, producing these\r\nnumerous intermediate forms, are not simply needless but injurious--produce\r\nforms not well fitted for either of the functions discharged by the extreme\r\nforms: the implication being that natural selection has originated these\r\ndisadvantageous forms! If to escape from this necessity for suicide,\r\nProfessor Weismann accepts the inference that the differences among these\r\nnumerous intermediate forms are caused by arrested feeding of the larvæ at\r\ndifferent stages, then he is bound to admit that the differences between\r\nthe extreme forms, and between these and perfect females, are similarly\r\ncaused. But if he does this, what becomes of his hypothesis that the\r\nseveral castes are constitutionally distinct, and result from the operation\r\nof natural selection? Observe, too, that his theory does not even allow him\r\nto make this choice; for we have clear proof that unlikenesses among the\r\nforms of the same species cannot be determined this way or that way by\r\ndifferences of nutrition. English greyhounds and Scotch greyhounds do not\r\ndiffer from one another so much as do the Amazon-workers from the inferior\r\nworkers, or the workers from the queens. But no matter how a pregnant\r\nScotch greyhound is fed, or her pups after they are born, they cannot be\r\nchanged into English greyhounds: the different germ-plasms assert\r\nthemselves spite of all treatment. But in these social insects the\r\ndifferent structures of queens and workers _are_ determinable by\r\ndifferences of feeling. Therefore the production of their various castes\r\ndoes not result from the natural selection of varying germ-plasm.\r\n\r\nBefore dealing with Professor Weismann's crucial case--that co-adaptation\r\nof parts, which, in the soldier-ants, has, he thinks, arisen without\r\ninheritance of acquired characters--let me deal with an ancillary case\r\nwhich he puts forward as explicable by \"panmixia alone.\" This is the\r\n\"degeneration, in the warlike Amazon-ants, of the instinct to search for\r\nfood.\"[122] Let us first ask what have been the probable antecedents of\r\nthese Amazon-ants; for, as I have above said, it is absurd to speculate\r\nabout the structures and instincts the species possesses in its existing\r\norganized social state without asking what structures and instincts it\r\nbrought with it from its original solitary state and its unorganized social\r\nstate. From the outset these ants were predatory. Some variety of them led\r\nto swarm--probably at the sexual season--did not again disperse so soon as\r\nother varieties. Those which thus kept together derived advantages from\r\nmaking simultaneous attacks on prey, and prospered accordingly. Of\r\ndescendants the varieties which carried on longest the associated state\r\nprospered most; until, at length, the associated state became permanent.\r\nAll which social progress took place while there existed only perfect males\r\nand females. What was the next step? Ants utilize other insects, and, among\r\nother ways of doing this, sometimes make their nests where there are useful\r\ninsects ready to be utilized. Giving an account of certain New Zealand\r\nspecies of _Tetramorium_, Mr. W. W. Smith says they seek out underground\r\nplaces where there are \"root-feeding aphides and coccids,\" which they begin\r\nto treat as domestic animals; and further he says that when, after the\r\npairing season, new nests are being formed, there are \"a few ants of both\r\nsexes ... from two up to eight or ten.\"[123] Carrying with us this fact as\r\na key, let us ask what habits will be fallen into by the conquering species\r\nof ants. They, too, will seek places where there are creatures to be\r\nutilized; and, finding it profitable, will invade the habitations not of\r\ndefenceless creatures only, but of creatures whose powers of defence are\r\ninadequate--weaker species of their own order. A very small modification\r\nwill affiliate their habits on habits of their prototypes. Instead of being\r\nsupplied with sweet substance excreted by the aphides they are supplied\r\nwith sweet substance by the ants among which they parasitically settle\r\nthemselves. How easily the subjugated ants may fall into the habit of\r\nfeeding them, we shall see on remembering that already they feed not only\r\nlarvæ but adults--individuals bigger than themselves. And that attentions\r\nkindred to these paid to parasitic ants may be established without\r\ndifficulty, is shown us by the small birds which continue to feed a young\r\ncuckoo in their nest when it has outgrown them. This advanced form of\r\nparasitism grew up while there were yet only perfect males and females, as\r\nhappens in the initial stage with these New Zealand ants. What further\r\nmodifications of habits were probably then acquired? From the practice of\r\nsettling themselves where there already exist colonies of aphides, which\r\nthey carry about to suitable places in the nest, like _Tetramorium_, other\r\nants pass to the practice of making excursions to get aphides, and putting\r\nthem in better feeding places where they become more productive of\r\nsaccharine matter. By a parallel step these soldier-ants pass from the\r\nstage of settling themselves among other ants which feed them, to the stage\r\nof fetching the pupæ of such ants to the nest: a transition like that which\r\noccurs among slave-making human beings. Thus by processes analogous to\r\nthose we see going on, these communities of slave-making ants may be\r\nformed. And since the transition from an unorganized social state to a\r\nsocial state characterized by castes, must have been gradual, there must\r\nhave been a long interval during which the perfect males and females of\r\nthese conquering ants could acquire habits and transmit them to progeny. A\r\nsmall modification accounts for that seemingly-strange habit which\r\nProfessor Weismann signalizes. For if, as is observed, those ants which\r\nkeep aphides solicit them to excrete a supply of ant-food by stroking them\r\nwith the antennæ, they come very near to doing that which Professor\r\nWeismann says the soldier-ants do towards a worker--\"they come to it and\r\nbeg for food:\" the food being put into their mouths in this last case as\r\nalmost or quite in the first. And evidently this habit of passively\r\nreceiving food, continued through many generations of perfect males and\r\nfemales, may result in such disuse of the power of self-feeding that this\r\nis eventually lost. The behaviour of young birds, during, and after, their\r\nnest-life, gives us the clue. For a week or more after they are full-grown\r\nand fly about with their parents, they may be seen begging for food and\r\nmaking no efforts to recognize and pick up food for themselves. If,\r\ngeneration after generation, feeding of them in full measure continued,\r\nthey would not learn to feed themselves: the perceptions and instincts\r\nimplied in self-feeding would be later and later developed, until, with\r\nentire disuse of them, they would disappear altogether by inheritance. Thus\r\nself-feeding may readily have ceased among these soldier-ants before the\r\ncaste-organization arose among them.\r\n\r\nWith this interpretation compare the interpretation of Professor Weismann.\r\nI have before protested against arguing in abstracts without descending to\r\nconcretes. Here let us ask what are the particular changes which the\r\nalleged explanation by survival of the fittest involves. Suppose we make\r\nthe very liberal supposition that an ant's central ganglion bears to its\r\nbody the same ratio as the human brain bears to the human body--say,\r\none-fortieth of its weight. Assuming this, what shall we assume to be the\r\nweight of those ganglion-cells and fibres in which are localized the\r\nperceptions of food and the suggestion to take it? Shall we say that these\r\namount to one-tenth of the central ganglion? This is a high estimate\r\nconsidering all the impressions which this ganglion has to receive, and all\r\nthe operations which it has to direct. Still we will say one-tenth. Then it\r\nfollows that this portion of nervous substance is one-400th of the weight\r\nof its body. By what series of variations shall we say that it is reduced\r\nfrom full power to entire incapacity? Shall we say five? This is a small\r\nnumber to assume. Nevertheless we will assume it. What results? That the\r\neconomy of nerve-substance achieved by each of these five variations will\r\namount to one-2000th of the entire mass. Making these highly favourable\r\nassumptions, what follows:--The queen-ant lays eggs that give origin to\r\nindividuals in each of which there is achieved an economy in\r\nnerve-substance of one-2000th of its weight; and the implication of the\r\nhypothesis is that such an economy will so advantage this ant-community\r\nthat in the competition with other ant-communities it will conquer. For\r\nhere let me recall the truth before insisted upon, that natural selection\r\ncan operate only on those variations which appreciably benefit the stirp.\r\nBearing in mind this requirement, is any one now prepared to say that\r\nsurvival of the fittest can cause this decline of the self-feeding\r\nfaculty?[124]\r\n\r\nNot limiting himself to the Darwinian interpretation, however, Professor\r\nWeismann says that this degradation may be accounted for by \"panmixia\r\nalone.\" Here I will not discuss the adequacy of this supposed cause, but\r\nwill leave it to be dealt with by implication a few pages in advance, where\r\nthe general hypothesis of panmixia will be reconsidered.\r\n\r\nAnd now, at length, we are prepared for dealing with Professor Weismann's\r\ncrucial case--with his alleged disproof that co-adaptation of co-operative\r\nparts results from inheritance of acquired characters, because in the case\r\nof the Amazon-ants, it has arisen where the inheritance of acquired\r\ncharacters is impossible. For after what has been said, it will be manifest\r\nthat the whole question is begged when it is assumed that this\r\nco-adaptation has arisen since there existed among these ants an organized\r\nsocial state. Unquestionably this organized social state pre-supposes a\r\nseries of modifications through which it has been reached. It follows,\r\nthen, that there can be no rational interpretation without a preceding\r\ninquiry concerning that earlier state in which there were no castes, but\r\nonly males and females. What kinds of individuals were the ancestral\r\nants--at first solitary, and then semi-social? They must have had marked\r\npowers of offence and defence. Of predacious creatures, it is the more\r\npowerful which form societies, not the weaker. Instance human races.\r\nNations originate from the relatively warlike tribes, not from the\r\nrelatively peaceful tribes. Among the several types of individuals forming\r\nthe existing ant community, to which, then, did the ancestral ants bear the\r\ngreatest resemblance? They could not have been like the queens, for these,\r\nnow devoted to egg-laying, are unfitted for conquest. They could not have\r\nbeen like the inferior class of workers, for these, too, are inadequately\r\narmed and lack strength. Hence they must have been most like these\r\nAmazon-ants or soldier-ants, which now make predatory excursions--which now\r\ndo, in fact, what their remote ancestors did. What follows? Their\r\nco-adapted parts have not been produced by the selection of variations\r\nwithin the ant-community, such as we now see it. They have been inherited\r\nfrom the pre-social and early social types of ants, in which the\r\nco-adaptation of parts had been effected by inheritance of acquired\r\ncharacters. It is not that the soldier-ants have gained these traits; it is\r\nthat the other castes have lost them. Early arrest of development causes\r\nabsence of them in the inferior workers; and from the queens they have\r\nslowly disappeared by inheritance of the effects of disuse. For, in\r\nconformity with ordinary facts of development, we may conclude that in a\r\nlarva which is being so fed as that the development of the reproductive\r\norgans is becoming pronounced, there will simultaneously commence arrest in\r\nthe development of those organs which are not to be used. There are\r\nabundant proofs that along with rapid growth of some organs others abort.\r\nAnd if these inferences are true, then Professor Weismann's argument falls\r\nto the ground. Nay, it falls to the ground even if conclusions so definite\r\nas these be not insisted upon; for before he can get a basis for his\r\nargument he must give good reasons for concluding that these traits of the\r\nAmazon-ants have _not_ been inherited from remote ancestors.\r\n\r\nOne more step remains. Let us grant him his basis, and let us pass from the\r\nabove negative criticism to a positive criticism. As before, I decline to\r\nfollow the practice of talking in abstracts instead of in concretes, and\r\ncontend that, difficult as it may be to see how natural selection has in\r\nall cases operated, we ought, at any rate, to trace out its operation\r\nwhenever we can, and see where the hypothesis lands us. According to\r\nProfessor Weismann's admission, for production of the Amazon-ant by natural\r\nselection, \"_many parts must have varied simultaneously and in harmony with\r\none another_;\"[125] and he names as such, larger jaws, muscles to move\r\nthem, larger head, and thicker chitin for it, bigger nerves for the\r\nmuscles, bigger motor centres in the brain, and, for the support of the big\r\nhead, strengthening of the thorax, limbs, and skeleton generally. As he\r\nadmits, all these parts must have varied simultaneously in due proportion\r\nto one another. What must have been the proximate causes of their\r\nvariations? They must have been variations in what he calls the\r\n\"determinants.\" He says:--\r\n\r\n  \"We have, however, to deal with the transmission of parts which are\r\n  _variable_ and this necessitates the assumption that just as many\r\n  independent and variable parts exist in the germ-plasm as are present in\r\n  the fully formed organism.\"[126]\r\n\r\nConsequently to produce simultaneously these many variations of parts,\r\nadjusted in their sizes and shapes, there must have simultaneously arisen a\r\nset of corresponding variations in the \"determinants\" composing the\r\ngerm-plasm. What made them simultaneously vary in the requisite ways?\r\nProfessor Weismann will not say that there was somewhere a foregone\r\nintention. This would imply supernatural agency. He makes no attempt to\r\nassign a physical cause for these simultaneous appropriate variations in\r\nthe determinants: an adequate physical cause being inconceivable. What,\r\nthen, remains as the only possible interpretation? Nothing but _a\r\nfortuitous concourse of variations_; reminding us of the old \"fortuitous\r\nconcourse of atoms.\" Nay, indeed, it is the very same thing. For each of\r\nthe \"determinants,\" made up of \"biophors,\" and these again of\r\nprotein-molecules, and these again of simpler chemical molecules, must have\r\nhad its molecular constitution changed in the required way; and the\r\nmolecular constitutions of all the \"determinants,\" severally modified\r\ndifferently, but in adjustment to one another, must have been thus modified\r\nby \"a fortuitous concourse of atoms.\" Now if this is an allowable\r\nsupposition in respect of the \"determinants,\" and the varying organs\r\narising from them, why is it not an allowable supposition in respect of the\r\norganism as a whole? Why not assume \"a fortuitous concourse of atoms\" in\r\nits broad, simple form? Nay, indeed, would not this be much the easier? For\r\nobserve, this co-adaptation of numerous co-operative parts is not achieved\r\nby one set of variations, but is achieved gradually by a series of such\r\nsets. That is to say, the \"fortuitous concourse of atoms\" must have\r\noccurred time after time in appropriate ways. We have not one miracle, but\r\na series of miracles!\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nOf the two remaining points in Professor Weismann's first article which\r\ndemand notice, one concerns his reply to my argument drawn from the\r\ndistribution of tactual discriminativeness. In what way does he treat this\r\nargument? He meets it by an argument derived from hypothetical\r\nevidence--not actual evidence. Taking the case of the tongue-tip, I have\r\ncarefully inquired whether its extreme power of tactual discrimination can\r\ngive any life-saving advantage in moving about the food during mastication,\r\nin detecting foreign bodies in it, or for purposes of speech; and have, I\r\nthink, shown that the ability to distinguish between points one\r\ntwenty-fourth of an inch apart is useless for such purposes. Professor\r\nWeismann thinks he disposes of this by observing that among the apes the\r\ntongue is used as an organ of touch. But surely a counter-argument\r\nequivalent in weight to mine should have given a case in which power to\r\ndiscriminate between points one twenty-fourth of an inch apart instead of\r\none-twentieth of an inch apart (a variation of one-sixth) had a life-saving\r\nefficacy; or, at any rate, should have suggested such a case. Nothing of\r\nthe kind is done or even attempted. But now note that his reply, accepted\r\neven as it stands, is suicidal. For what has the trusted process of\r\npanmixia been doing ever since the human being began to evolve from the\r\nape? Why during thousands of generations has not the nervous structure\r\ngiving this extreme discriminativeness dwindled away? Even supposing it had\r\nbeen proved of life-saving efficacy to our simian ancestors, it ought,\r\naccording to Professor Weismann's own hypothesis, to have disappeared in\r\nus. Either there was none of the assumed special capacity in the ape's\r\ntongue, in which case his reply fails, or panmixia has not operated, in\r\nwhich case his theory of degeneracy fails.\r\n\r\nAll this, however, is but preface to the chief answer. The argument drawn\r\nfrom the case of the tongue-tip, with which alone Professor Weismann deals,\r\nis but a small part of my argument, the remainder of which he does not\r\nattempt to touch--does not even mention. Had I never referred to the\r\ntongue-tip at all, the various contrasts in discriminativeness which I have\r\nnamed, between the one extreme of the forefinger-tip and the other extreme\r\nof the middle of the back, would have abundantly sufficed to establish my\r\ncase--would have sufficed to show the inadequacy of natural selection as a\r\nkey and the adequacy of the inheritance of acquired characters.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, then, that judgment must go against him by default.\r\nPractically he leaves the matter standing just where it did.[127]\r\n\r\nThe other remaining point concerns the vexed question of panmixia.\r\nConfirming the statement of Dr. Romanes, Professor Weismann says that I\r\nhave misunderstood him. Already (_Contemporary Review_, May, 1893, p. 758,\r\nand Reprint, p. 66) I have quoted passages which appeared to justify my\r\ninterpretation, arrived at after much seeking.[128] Already, too, in this\r\nreview (July, 1893, p. 54) I have said why I did not hit upon the\r\ninterpretation now said to be the true one: I never supposed that any one\r\nwould assume, without assigned cause, that (apart from the excluded\r\ninfluence of disuse) the _minus_ variations of a disused organ are greater\r\nthan the _plus_ variations. This was a tacit challenge to produce reasons\r\nfor the assumption. Professor Weismann does not accept the challenge, but\r\nsimply says:--\"In my opinion all organs are maintained at the height of\r\ntheir development only through uninterrupted selection\" (p. 332): in the\r\nabsence of which they decline. Now it is doubtless true that as a\r\nnaturalist he may claim for his \"opinion\" a relatively great weight. Still,\r\nin pursuance of the methods of science, it seems to me that something more\r\nthan an opinion is required as the basis of a far-reaching theory.[129]\r\n\r\nThough the counter-opinion of one who is not a naturalist (as Professor\r\nWeismann points out) may be of relatively small value, yet I must here\r\nagain give it, along with a final reason for it. And this reason shall be\r\nexhibited, not in a qualitative form, but in a quantitative form. Let us\r\nquantify the terms of the hypothesis by weights; and let us take as our\r\ntest case the rudimentary hind-limbs of the whale. Zoologists are agreed\r\nthat the whale has been evolved from a mammal which took to aquatic habits,\r\nand that its disused hind-limbs have gradually disappeared. When they\r\nceased to be used in swimming, natural selection played a part--probably an\r\nimportant part--in decreasing them; since, being then impediments to\r\nmovement through the water, they diminished the attainable speed. It may\r\nbe, too, that for a period after disappearance of the limbs beneath the\r\nskin, survival of the fittest had still some effect. But during the latter\r\nstages of the process it had no effect; since the rudiments caused no\r\ninconvenience and entailed no appreciable cost. Here, therefore, the cause,\r\nif Professor Weismann is right, must have been panmixia. Dr. Struthers,\r\nProfessor of Anatomy at Aberdeen, whose various publications show him to be\r\na high, if not the highest, authority on the anatomy of these great\r\ncetaceans, has kindly taken much trouble in furnishing me with the needful\r\ndata, based upon direct weighing and measuring and estimation of specific\r\ngravity. In the Black Whale (_Balænoptera borealis_) there are no rudiments\r\nof hind-limbs whatever: rudiments of the pelvic bones only remain. A sample\r\nof the Greenland Right Whale, estimated to weigh 44,800 lbs., had femurs\r\nweighing together 3½ ozs.; while a sample of the Razor-back Whale\r\n(_Balænoptera musculus_), 50 feet long, and estimated to weigh 56,000 lbs.,\r\nhad rudimentary femurs weighing together one ounce; so that these vanishing\r\nremnants of hind-limbs weighed but one-896,000th part of the animal. Now in\r\nconsidering the alleged degeneration by panmixia, we have first to ask why\r\nthese femurs must be supposed to have varied in the direction of decrease\r\nrather than in the direction of increase. During its evolution from the\r\noriginal land-mammal, the whale has grown enormously, implying habitual\r\nexcess of nutrition. Alike in the embryo and in the growing animal, there\r\nmust have been a chronic plethora. Why, then, should we suppose these\r\nrudiments to have become smaller? Why should they not have enlarged by\r\ndeposit in them of superfluous materials? But let us grant the unwarranted\r\nassumption of predominant _minus_ variations. Let us say that the last\r\nvariation was a reduction of one-half--that in some individuals the joint\r\nweight of the femurs was suddenly reduced from two ounces to one ounce--a\r\nreduction of one-900,000th of the creature's weight. By inter-crossing with\r\nthose inheriting the variation, the reduction, or a part of the reduction,\r\nwas made a trait of the species. Now, in the first place, a necessary\r\nimplication is that this _minus_ variation was maintained in posterity. So\r\nfar from having reason to suppose this, we have reason to suppose the\r\ncontrary. As before quoted, Mr. Darwin says that \"unless carefully\r\npreserved by man,\" \"any particular variation would generally be lost by\r\ncrossing, reversion, and the accidental destruction of the varying\r\nindividuals.\"[130] And Mr. Galton, in his essay on \"Regression towards\r\nMediocrity,\"[131] contends that not only do deviations of the whole\r\norganism from the mean size tend to thus disappear, but that deviations in\r\nits components do so. Hence the chances are against such _minus_ variation\r\nbeing so preserved as to affect the species by panmixia. In the second\r\nplace, supposing it to be preserved, may we reasonably assume that, by\r\ninter-crossing, this decrease, amounting to about a millionth part of the\r\ncreature's weight, will gradually affect the constitutions of all\r\nRazor-back Whales distributed over the Arctic seas and the North Atlantic\r\nOcean, from Greenland to the Equator? Is this a credible conclusion? For\r\nthree reasons, then, the hypothesis must be rejected.\r\n\r\nThus, the only reasonable interpretation is the inheritance of acquired\r\ncharacters. If the effects of use and disuse, which are known causes of\r\nchange in each individual, influence succeeding individuals--if\r\nfunctionally-produced modifications of structure are transmissible, as well\r\nas modifications of structure otherwise arising--then this reduction of the\r\nwhale's hind limbs to minute rudiments is accounted for. The cause has been\r\nunceasingly operative on all individuals of the species ever since the\r\ntransformation began.\r\n\r\nIn one case see all. If this cause has thus operated on the limbs of the\r\nwhale, it has thus operated in all creatures on all parts having active\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nAt the outset I intimated that I must limit my replies to those arguments\r\nof Professor Weismann which are contained in his first article. That those\r\ncontained in his second might be dealt with no less effectually, did time\r\nand space permit, is manifest to me; but about the probability of this the\r\nreader must form his own judgment. My replies thus far may be summed up as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nProfessor Weismann says he has disproved the conclusion that degeneration\r\nof the little toe has resulted from inheritance of acquired characters. But\r\nhis reasoning fails against an interpretation he overlooks. A profound\r\nmodification of the hind limbs and their appendages must have taken place\r\nduring the transition from arboreal habits to terrestrial habits; and\r\ndwindling of the little toe is an obvious consequence of disuse, at the\r\nsame time that enlargement of the great toe is an obvious consequence of\r\nincreased use.\r\n\r\nThe entire argument based on the unlike forms and instincts presented by\r\ncastes of social insects is invalidated by an omission. Until probable\r\nconclusions are reached respecting the characters which such insects\r\nbrought with them into the organized social state, no valid inferences can\r\nbe drawn respecting characters developed during that state.\r\n\r\nA further large error of interpretation is involved in the assumption that\r\nthe different caste-characters are transmitted to them in the eggs laid by\r\nthe mother insect. While we have evidence that the unlike structures of the\r\nsexes are determined by nutrition of the germ before egg-laying, we have\r\nevidence that the unlike structures of classes are caused by unlikenesses\r\nof nutrition of the larvæ. That these varieties of forms do not result from\r\nvarieties of germ-plasms, is demonstrated by the fact that where there are\r\nvarieties of germ-plasms, as in varieties of the same species of mammal, no\r\ndeviations in feeding prevent display of their structural results.\r\n\r\nFor such caste-modifications as those of the Amazon-ants, which are unable\r\nto feed themselves, there is a feasible explanation other than Professor\r\nWeismann's. The relation of common ants to their domestic animals--aphides\r\nand coccids--which yield them food on solicitation, does not differ widely\r\nfrom this relation between these Amazon-ants and their domestic\r\nanimals--the slave-ants. And the habit of being fed, contracted during the\r\nfirst stages of their parasitic life, when there were perfect males and\r\nfemales, may, during that stage, have become established by inheritance.\r\nMeanwhile the opposed interpretation--that this incapacity has resulted\r\nfrom the selection of those ant-communities the queens of which laid eggs\r\nthat had so varied as to entail this incapacity--implies that a scarcely\r\nappreciable economy of nerve-matter advantaged the stirp so greatly as to\r\ncause it to spread more than other stirps: an incredible supposition.\r\n\r\nAs the outcome of these alternative interpretations we saw that the\r\nargument respecting the co-adaptation of co-operative parts, which\r\nProfessor Weismann thinks is furnished to him by the Amazon-ants,\r\ndisappears. The ancestral ants were conquering ants. These founded the\r\ncommunities; and hence those members of the present communities which are\r\nmost like them are the Amazon-ants. If so, the co-adaptation of the\r\nco-operative parts was effected by inheritance during the solitary and\r\nsemi-social stages. Even were there no such solution, the opposed solution\r\nwill be unacceptable. These simultaneous appropriate variations of the\r\nco-operative parts in sizes, shapes, and proportions, are supposed to be\r\neffected by simultaneous variations in the \"determinants\" of the\r\ngerm-plasms; and in the absence of an assigned physical cause, this implies\r\na fortuitous concourse of appropriate variations, which carries us back to\r\na \"fortuitous concourse of atoms.\" This may just as well be extended to the\r\nentire organism. The old hypothesis of special creations is more consistent\r\nand comprehensible.\r\n\r\nTo rebut my inference drawn from the distribution of discriminativeness,\r\nProfessor Weismann uses not an argument but the blank form of an argument.\r\nThe ability to discriminate one twenty-fourth of an inch by the tongue-tip\r\n_may_ have been useful to the ape: no conceivable use being even suggested.\r\nAnd then the great body of my argument derived from the distribution of\r\ndiscriminativeness over the skin, which amply suffices, is wholly ignored.\r\n\r\nThe tacit challenge I gave to name some facts in support of the hypothesis\r\nof panmixia--or even a solitary fact--is passed by. It remains a pure\r\nspeculation having no basis but Professor Weismann's \"opinion.\" When from\r\nthe abstract statement of it we pass to a concrete test, in the case of the\r\nwhale, we find that it necessitates an unproved and improbable assumption\r\nrespecting _plus_ and _minus_ variations; that it ignores the unceasing\r\ntendency to reversion; and that it implies an effect out of all proportion\r\nto the cause.\r\n\r\nIt is curious what entirely opposite conclusions men may draw from the same\r\nevidence. Professor Weismann thinks he has shown that the \"last bulwark of\r\nthe Lamarckian principle is untenable.\" Most readers will hold with me that\r\nhe is, to use the mildest word, premature in so thinking. Contrariwise my\r\nimpression is that he has not shown either this bulwark or any other\r\nbulwark to be untenable; but rather that while his assault has failed it\r\nhas furnished opportunity for strengthening sundry of the bulwarks.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nAmong those who follow a controversy to its close, not one in a hundred\r\nturns back to its beginning to see whether its chief theses have been dealt\r\nwith. Very often the leading arguments of one disputant, seen by the other\r\nto be unanswerable, are quietly ignored, and attention is concentrated on\r\nsubordinate arguments to which replies, actually or seemingly valid, can be\r\nmade. The original issue is thus commonly lost sight of.\r\n\r\nMore than once I have pointed out that, as influencing men's views about\r\nEducation, Ethics, Sociology, and Politics, the question whether acquired\r\ncharacters are inherited is the most important question before the\r\nscientific world. Hence I cannot allow the discussion with Professor\r\nWeismann to end in so futile a way as it will do if no summary of results\r\nis made. Here, therefore, I propose to recapitulate the whole case in\r\nbrief. Primarily my purpose is to recall certain leading propositions\r\nwhich, having been passed by unnoticed, remain outstanding. I will turn, in\r\nthe second place, to such propositions as have been dealt with; hoping to\r\nshow that the replies given are invalid, and consequently that these\r\npropositions also remain outstanding.\r\n\r\nBut something beyond a summing-up is intended. A few pages at the close\r\nwill be devoted to setting forth new evidence which has come to light since\r\nthe controversy commenced--evidence which many will think sufficient in\r\nitself to warrant a positive conclusion.\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nThe fact that the tip of the fore finger has thirty times the power of\r\ndiscrimination possessed by the middle of the back, and that various\r\nintermediate degrees of discriminative power are possessed by various parts\r\nof the skin, was set down as a datum for my first argument. The causes\r\nwhich might be assigned for these remarkable contrasts were carefully\r\nexamined under all their aspects. I showed in detail that the contrasts\r\ncould not in any way be accounted for by natural selection. I further\r\nshowed that no interpretation of them is afforded by the alleged process of\r\npanmixia: this has no _locus standi_ in the case. Having proved\r\nexperimentally, that ability of the fingers to discriminate is increased by\r\npractice, and having pointed out that gradations of discriminativeness in\r\ndifferent parts correspond with gradations in the activities of the parts\r\nas used for tactual exploration, I argued that these contrasts have arisen\r\nfrom the organized and inherited effects of tactual converse with\r\nsurrounding things, varying in its degrees according to the positions of\r\nthe parts--in other words, that they are due to the inheritance of acquired\r\ncharacters. As a crowning proof I instanced the case of the tongue-tip,\r\nwhich has twice the discriminativeness of the forefinger-tip: pointing out\r\nthat consciously, or semi-consciously, or unconsciously, the tongue-tip is\r\nperpetually exploring the inner surfaces of the teeth.\r\n\r\nSingling out this last case, Professor Weismann made, or rather adopted\r\nfrom Dr. Romanes, what professed to be a reply but was nothing more than\r\nthe blank form of a reply. It was said that though this extreme\r\ndiscriminativeness of the tongue-tip is of no use to mankind, it may have\r\nbeen of use to certain ancestral _primates_. No evidence of any such use\r\nwas given; no imaginable use was assigned. It was simply suggested that\r\nthere perhaps was a use.\r\n\r\nIn my rejoinder, after indicating the illusory nature of this proceeding\r\n(which is much like offering a cheque on a bank where no assets have been\r\ndeposited to meet it), I pointed out that had the evidence furnished by the\r\ntongue tip never been mentioned, the evidence otherwise furnished amply\r\nsufficed. I then drew attention to the fact that this evidence had been\r\npassed over, and tacitly inquired why.\r\n\r\nNo reply.[132]\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nIn his essay on \"The All-Sufficiency of Natural Selection,\" Professor\r\nWeismann set out, not by answering one of the arguments I had used, but by\r\nimporting into the discussion an argument used by another writer, which it\r\nwas easy to meet. It had been contended that the smallness and deformity of\r\nthe little toe are consequent upon the effects of boot-pressure, inherited\r\nfrom generation to generation. To this Professor Weismann made the\r\nsufficient reply that the fusion of the phalanges and otherwise degraded\r\nstructure of the little toe, exist among peoples who go barefoot.\r\n\r\nIn my \"Rejoinder\" I said that though the inheritance of acquired characters\r\ndoes not explain this degradation in the way alleged, it explains it in a\r\nway which Professor Weismann overlooks. The cause is one which has been\r\noperating ever since the earliest anthropoid creatures began to decrease\r\ntheir life in trees and increase their life on the earth's surface. The\r\nmechanics of walking and running, in so far as they concern the question at\r\nissue, were analyzed; and it was shown that effort is economized and\r\nefficiency increased in proportion as the stress is thrown more and more on\r\nthe inner digits of the foot and less and less on the outer digits. So that\r\nthus the foot furnishes us simultaneously with an instance of increase from\r\nuse and of decrease from disuse; a further disproof being yielded of the\r\nallegation that co-operative parts vary together, since we have here\r\nco-operative parts of which one grows while the other dwindles.\r\n\r\nI ended by pointing out that, so far from strengthening his own case,\r\nProfessor Weismann had, by bringing into the controversy this changed\r\nstructure of the foot, given occasion for strengthening the opposite case.\r\n\r\nNo reply.\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nWe come now to Professor Weismann's endeavour to disprove my second\r\nthesis--that it is impossible to explain by natural selection alone the\r\nco-adaptation of co-operative parts. It is thirty years since this was set\r\nforth in _The Principles of Biology_. In § 166 I instanced the enormous\r\nhorns of the extinct Irish elk, and contended that in this, and in kindred\r\ncases, where for the efficient use of some one enlarged part many other\r\nparts have to be simultaneously enlarged, it is out of the question to\r\nsuppose that they can have all spontaneously varied in the required\r\nproportions. In \"The Factors of Organic Evolution,\" by way of enforcing\r\nthis argument, which had, so far as I know, never been met, I dwelt upon\r\nthe aberrant structure of the giraffe. And then, in the essay which\r\ninitiated this controversy, I brought forward yet a third case--that of an\r\nanimal which, previously accustomed only to walking, acquires the power of\r\nleaping.\r\n\r\nIn the first of his articles in the _Contemporary Review_ (September,\r\n1893), Professor Weismann made no direct reply, but he made an indirect\r\nreply. He did not attempt to show how there could have taken place in the\r\nstag the \"harmonious variation of the different parts that co-operate to\r\nproduce one physiological result\" (p. 311); but he contended that such\r\nharmonious variation _must_ have taken place, because the like has taken\r\nplace in \"the neuters of state-forming insects\"--\"animal forms which do not\r\nreproduce themselves, but are always propagated anew by parents which are\r\nunlike them\" (p. 313), and which therefore cannot have transmitted acquired\r\ncharacters. Singling out those soldier-neuters which exist among certain\r\nkinds of ants, he described (p. 318) the many co-ordinated parts required\r\nto make their fighting organs efficient. He then argued that the required\r\nsimultaneous changes can \"only have arisen by a selection of the\r\nparent-ants dependent on the fact that those parents which produced the\r\nbest workers had always the best prospect of the persistence of their\r\ncolony. No other explanation is conceivable; _and it is just because no\r\nother explanation is conceivable, that it is necessary for us to accept the\r\nprinciple of natural selection_\" (pp. 318-9).\r\n\r\n[This passage initiated a collateral controversy, which, as continually\r\nhappens, has greatly obscured the primary controversy. It became a question\r\nwhether these forms of neuter insects have arisen as Professor Weismann\r\nassumes, or whether they have arisen from arrested development consequent\r\nupon innutrition. To avoid entanglements I must for the present pass over\r\nthis collateral controversy, intending to resume it presently, when the\r\noriginal issues have been dealt with.]\r\n\r\nNo one will suspect me of thinking that the inconceivability of the\r\nnegation is not a valid criterion, since, in \"The Universal Postulate,\"\r\npublished in the _Westminster Review_ in 1852 and afterwards in _The\r\nPrinciples of Psychology_, I contended that it is the ultimate test of\r\ntruth. But then in every case there has to be determined the question--Is\r\nthe negation inconceivable; and in assuming that it is so in the case\r\nnamed, lies the fallacy of the above-quoted passage. The three separate\r\nways in which I dealt with this position of Professor Weismann are as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nIf we admit the assumption that the form of the soldier-ant has been\r\ndeveloped since the establishment of the organized ant-community in which\r\nit exists, Professor Weismann's assertion that no other process than that\r\nwhich he alleges is conceivable, is true. But I pointed out that this\r\nassumption is inadmissible; and that no valid conclusion respecting the\r\ngenesis of the soldier-ant can be drawn without postulating either the\r\nascertained, or the probable, structure of those pre-social, or\r\nsemi-social, ants from which the organized social ants have descended. I\r\nwent on to contend that the pre-social type must have been a conquering\r\ntype, and that therefore in all probability the soldier-ants represent most\r\nnearly the structures of those ancestral ants which existed when the\r\nsociety had perfect males and females and could transmit acquired\r\ncharacters, while the other members of the existing communities are\r\ndegraded forms of the type.\r\n\r\nNo reply.\r\n\r\nA further argument I used was that where there exist different castes among\r\nthe neuter-ants, as those seen in the soldiers and workers of the Driver\r\nants of West Africa, \"they graduate insensibly into each other\" alike in\r\ntheir sizes and in their structures; and that Professor Weismann's\r\nhypothesis implies a special set of \"determinants\" for each intermediate\r\nform. Or if he should say that the intermediate forms result from mixtures\r\nof the determinants of the two extreme forms, there still remains the\r\nfurther difficulty that natural selection has maintained, for innumerable\r\ngenerations, these intermediate forms which are injurious deviations from\r\nthe useful extreme forms.\r\n\r\nNo reply.\r\n\r\nOne further reason--fatal it seems to me--was urged in bar of his\r\ninterpretation. No physical cause has been, or can be, assigned, why in the\r\ngerm-plasm of any particular queen-ant, the \"determinants\" initiating these\r\nvarious co-operative organs, all simultaneously vary in fitting ways and\r\ndegrees, and still less why there occur such co-ordinated variations\r\ngeneration after generation, until by their accumulated results these\r\nefficient co-operative structures have been evolved. I pointed out that in\r\nthe absence of any assigned or assignable physical cause, it is necessary\r\nto assume a fortuitous concurrence of favourable variations, which means \"a\r\nfortuitous concourse of atoms;\" and that it would be just as rational, and\r\nmuch more consistent, to assume that the structure of the entire organism\r\nthus resulted.\r\n\r\nNo reply.\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nIt is reasonable to suspect that Professor Weismann recognized these\r\ndifficulties as insuperable, for, in his Romanes Lecture on \"The Effect of\r\nExternal Influences upon Development,\" instead of his previous indirect\r\nreply, he makes a direct reply. Reverting to the stag and its enlarging\r\nhorns, he alleges a process by which, as he thinks, we may understand how,\r\nby variation and selection, all the bones and muscles of the neck, of the\r\nthorax, and of the fore-legs, are step by step adjusted in their sizes to\r\nthe increasing sizes of the horns. He ascribes this harmonization to the\r\ninternal struggle for nutriment, and that survival of the fittest which\r\ntakes place among the parts of an organism: a process which he calls\r\n\"_intra-individual_-selection, or more briefly--_intra-selection_\" (p. 12).\r\n\r\n  \"Wilhelm Roux has given an explanation of the cause of these wonderfully\r\n  fine adaptations by applying the principle of selection to the parts of\r\n  the organism. Just as there is a struggle for survival among the\r\n  individuals of a species, and the fittest are victorious, so also do even\r\n  the smallest living particles contend with one another, and those that\r\n  succeed best in securing food and place grow and multiply rapidly, and so\r\n  displace those that are less suitably equipped\" (p. 12).[133]\r\n\r\nThat I do not explain as he does the co-adaptation of co-operative parts,\r\nProfessor Weismann ascribes to my having overlooked this \"principle of\r\nintra-selection\"--an unlucky supposition, as we see. But I do not think\r\nthat when recognizing it a generation ago, I should have seen its relevancy\r\nto the question at issue, had that issue then been raised, and I certainly\r\ndo not see it now. Full reproduction of Professor Weismann's explanation is\r\nimpracticable, for it occupies several pages, but here are the essential\r\nsentences from it:--\r\n\r\n  \"The great significance of intra-selection appears to me not to depend on\r\n  its producing structures that are directly transmissible,--it cannot do\r\n  that,--but rather consists in its causing a development of the\r\n  germ-structure, acquired by the selection of individuals, which will be\r\n  suitable to varying conditions.... We may therefore say that\r\n  intra-selection effects the adaptation of the individual to its chance\r\n  developmental conditions,--the suiting of the hereditary primary\r\n  constituents to fresh circumstances\" (p. 16).... \"But as the primary\r\n  variations in the phyletic metamorphosis occurred little by little, the\r\n  secondary adaptations would probably as a rule be able to keep pace with\r\n  them. Time would thus be gained till, in the course of generations, by\r\n  constant selection of those germs the primary constituents of which are\r\n  best suited to one another, the greatest possible degree of harmony may\r\n  be reached, and consequently a definitive metamorphosis of the species\r\n  involving all the parts of the individual may occur\" (p. 19).\r\n\r\nThe connecting sentences, along with those which precede and succeed, would\r\nnot, if quoted, give to the reader clearer conceptions than these by\r\nthemselves give. But when disentangled from Professor Weismann's involved\r\nstatements, the essential issues are, I think, clear enough. In the case of\r\nthe stag, that daily working together of the numerous nerves, muscles, and\r\nbones concerned, by which they are adjusted to the carrying and using of\r\nsomewhat heavier horns, produces on them effects which, as I hold, are\r\ninheritable, but which, as Professor Weismann holds, are not inheritable.\r\nIf they are not inheritable, what must happen? A fawn of the next\r\ngeneration is born with no such adjustment of nerves, muscles and bones as\r\nhad been produced by greater exercise in the parent, and with no tendency\r\nto such adjustment. Consequently if, in successive generations, the horns\r\ngo on enlarging, all these nerves, muscles, and bones, remaining of the\r\noriginal sizes, become utterly inadequate. The result is loss of life: the\r\nprocess of adaptation fails. \"No,\" says Professor Weismann, \"we must\r\nconclude that the germ-plasm has varied in the needful manner.\" How so? The\r\nprocess of \"intra-individual selection,\" as he calls it, can have had no\r\neffect, since the cells of the soma cannot influence the reproductive\r\ncells. In what way, then, has the germ-plasm gained the characters required\r\nfor producing simultaneously all these modified co-operative parts. Well,\r\nProfessor Weismann tells us merely that we must suppose that the germ-plasm\r\nacquires a certain sensitiveness such as gives it a proclivity to\r\ndevelopment in the requisite ways. How is such proclivity obtainable? Only\r\nby having a multitude of its \"determinants\" simultaneously changed in fit\r\nmodes. Emphasizing the fact that even a small failure in any one of the\r\nco-operative parts may be fatal, as the sprain of an over-taxed muscle\r\nshows us, I alleged that the chances are infinity to one against the\r\nneedful variations taking place at the same time. Divested of its\r\nelaboration, its abstract words and technical phrases, the outcome of\r\nProfessor Weismann's explanation is that he accepts this, and asserts that\r\nthe infinitely improbable thing takes place!\r\n\r\nEither his argument is a disguised admission of the inheritableness of\r\nacquired characters (the effects of \"intra-selection\") or else it is, as\r\nbefore, the assumption of a fortuitous concourse of favourable variations\r\nin the determinants--\"a fortuitous concourse of atoms.\"\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nLeaving here this main issue, I return now to that collateral issue named\r\non a preceding page as being postponed--whether the neuters among social\r\ninsects result from specially modified germ-plasms or whether they result\r\nfrom the treatment received during their larval stages.\r\n\r\nFor the substantiation of his doctrine Professor Weismann is obliged to\r\nadopt the first of these alternatives; and in his Romanes Lecture he found\r\nit needful to deal with the evidence I brought in support of the second\r\nalternative. He says that \"poor feeding is not the _causa efficiens_ of\r\nsterility among bees, but is merely the stimulus which _not only results in\r\nthe formation of rudimentary ovaries, but at the same time calls forth all\r\nthe other distinctive characters of the workers_\" (pp. 29-30); and he says\r\nthis although he has in preceding lines admitted that it is \"true of all\r\nanimals that they reproduce only feebly or not at all when badly and\r\ninsufficiently nourished:\" a known cause being thus displaced by a supposed\r\ncause. But Professor Weismann proceeds to justify his interpretation by\r\nexperimentally-obtained evidence.\r\n\r\nHe \"reared large numbers of the eggs of a female blow-fly\"; the larvæ of\r\nsome he fed abundantly, but the larvæ of others sparingly; and eventually\r\nhe obtained, from the one set flies of full size, and from the other small\r\nflies. Nevertheless the small flies were fertile, as well as the others.\r\nHere, then, was proof that innutrition had not produced infertility; and he\r\ncontends that therefore among the neuter social insects, infertility has\r\nnot resulted from innutrition. The argument seems strong, and to many will\r\nappear conclusive; but there are two differences which entirely vitiate the\r\ncomparison Professor Weismann institutes.\r\n\r\nOne of them has been pointed out by Mr. Cunningham. In the case of the\r\nblow-fly the food supplied to the larvæ though different in quantity was\r\nthe same in quality; in the case of the social insects the food supplied,\r\nwhether or not different in quantity, differs in quality. Among bees,\r\nwasps, ants, &c., the larvæ of the reproductive forms are fed upon a more\r\nnitrogenous food than are the larvæ of the workers; whereas the two sets of\r\nlarvæ of the blow-fly, as fed by Professor Weismann, were alike supplied\r\nwith highly nitrogenous food. Hence there did not exist the same cause for\r\nnon-development of the reproductive organs. Here, then, is one vitiation of\r\nthe supposed parallel. There is a second.\r\n\r\nWhile the development of an embryo follows in a rude way the phyletic\r\nmetamorphoses passed through by its ancestry, the order of development of\r\norgans is often gradually modified by the needs of particular species: the\r\nstructures being developed in such order as conduces to self-sustentation\r\nand the welfare of offspring. Among other results there arise differences\r\nin the relative dates of maturity of the reproductive system and of the\r\nother systems. It is clear, _à priori_, that it must be fatal to a species\r\nif offspring are habitually produced before the conditions requisite for\r\ntheir survival are fulfilled. And hence, if the life is a complex one, and\r\nthe care taken of offspring is great, reproduction must be much longer\r\ndelayed than where the life is simple and the care of offspring absent or\r\neasy. The contrast between men and oxen sufficiently illustrates this\r\ntruth. Now the subordination of the order of development of parts to the\r\nneeds of the species, is conspicuously shown in the contrast between these\r\ntwo kinds of insects which Professor Weismann compares as though their\r\nrequirements were similar. What happens with the blow fly? If it is able to\r\nsuck up some nutriment, to fly tolerably, and to scent out dead flesh,\r\nvarious of its minor organs may be more or less imperfect without\r\nappreciable detriment to the species: the eggs can be laid in a fit place,\r\nand that is all that is wanted. Hence it profits the species to have the\r\nreproductive system developed comparatively early--in advance, even, of\r\nvarious less essential parts. Quite otherwise is it with social insects,\r\nwhich take such remarkable care of their young; or rather to make the case\r\nparallel--quite otherwise is it with those types from which the social\r\ninsects have descended, bringing into the social state their inherited\r\ninstincts and constitutions. Consider the doings of the mason-wasp, or\r\nmason-bee, or those of the carpenter-bee. What, in these cases, must the\r\nfemale do that she may rear members of the next generation? There is a fit\r\nplace for building or burrowing to be chosen; there is the collecting\r\ntogether of grains of sand and cementing them into a strong and water-proof\r\ncell, or there is the burrowing into wood and there building several cells;\r\nthere is the collecting of food to place along with the eggs deposited in\r\nthese cells, solitary or associated, including that intelligent choice of\r\nsmall caterpillars which, discovered and carried home, are carefully packed\r\naway and hypnotized by a sting, so that they may live until the growing\r\nlarva has need of them. For all these proceedings there have to be provided\r\nthe fit external organs--cutting instruments, &c., and the fit internal\r\norgans--complicated nerve-centres in which are located these various\r\nremarkable instincts, and ganglia by which these delicate operations have\r\nto be guided. And these special structures have, some if not all of them,\r\nto be made perfect and brought into efficient action before egg-laying\r\ntakes place. Ask what would happen if the reproductive system were active\r\nin advance of these ancillary appliances. The eggs would have to be laid\r\nwithout protection or food, and the species would forthwith disappear. And\r\nif that full development of the reproductive organs which is marked by\r\ntheir activity, is not needful until these ancillary organs have come into\r\nplay, the implication, in conformity with the general law above indicated,\r\nis that the perfect development of the reproductive organs will take place\r\nlater than that of these ancillary organs, and that if innutrition checks\r\nthe general development, the reproductive organs will be those which\r\nchiefly suffer. Hence, in the social types which have descended from these\r\nsolitary types, this order of evolution of parts will be inherited, and\r\nwill entail the results I have inferred.\r\n\r\nIf only deductively reached, this conclusion would, I think, be fully\r\njustified. But now observe that it is more than deductively reached. It is\r\nestablished by observation. Professor Riley, Ph.D., late Government\r\nEntomologist of the United States, in his annual address as President of\r\nthe Biological Society of Washington,[134] on January 29, 1894, said:--\r\n\r\n  \"Among the more curious facts connected with these Termites, because of\r\n  their exceptional nature, is the late development of the internal sexual\r\n  organs in the reproductive forms.\" (p. 34.)\r\n\r\nThough what has been shown of the Termites has not been shown of the other\r\nsocial insects, which belong to a different order, yet, considering the\r\nanalogies between their social states and between their constitutional\r\nrequirements, it is a fair inference that what holds in the one case holds\r\npartially, if not fully, in the other. Should it be said that the larval\r\nforms do not pass into the pupa state in the one case as they do in the\r\nother, the answer is that this does not affect the principle. The larva\r\ncarries into the pupa state a fixed quantity of tissue-forming material for\r\nthe production of the imago. If the material is sufficient, then a complete\r\nimago is formed. If it is not sufficient, then, while the earlier formed\r\norgans are not affected by the deficiency, the deficiency is felt when the\r\nlatest formed organs come to be developed, and they are consequently\r\nimperfect.\r\n\r\nEven if left without reply, Professor Weismann's interpretation commits him\r\nto some insuperable difficulties, which I must now point out.\r\nUnquestionably he has \"the courage of his opinions;\" and it is shown\r\nthroughout this collateral discussion as elsewhere. He is compelled by\r\naccumulated evidence to admit \"that there is only _one_ kind of egg from\r\nwhich queens and workers as well as males arise.\"[135] But if the\r\nproduction of one or other form from the same germ does not result from\r\nspeciality of feeding, what does it result from? Here is his reply:--\r\n\r\n  \"We must rather suppose that the primary constituents of two distinct\r\n  reproductive systems--_e. g._ those of the queen and worker--are\r\n  contained in the germ-plasm of the egg.\"[136]\r\n\r\n\"The courage of his opinions,\" which Professor Weismann shows in this\r\nassumption, is, however, quite insufficient. For since he himself has just\r\nadmitted that there is only one kind of egg for queens, workers, and males,\r\nhe must at any rate assume three sets of \"determinants.\" (I find that on a\r\nsubsequent page he does so.) But this is not enough, for there are, in many\r\ncases, two if not more kinds of workers, which implies that four sets of\r\ndeterminants must co-exist in the same egg. Even now we have not got to the\r\nextent of the assumption required. In the address above referred to on\r\n\"Social Insects from Psychical and Evolutional Points of View,\" Professor\r\nRiley gives us (p. 33) the--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Forms in a Termes Colony under Normal Conditions._\r\n\r\n                      1.

True royal pairs.\r\n\r\nHence as, in this family tree, the royal pair includes male and female, it\r\nresults that there are _five_ different adult forms (Grassi says there are\r\ntwo others) arising from like eggs or larvæ; and Professor Weismann's\r\nhypothesis becomes proportionately complicated. Let us observe what the\r\ncomplications are.\r\n\r\nIt often happens in controversy--metaphysical controversy more than any\r\nother--that propositions are accepted without their terms having been\r\nmentally represented. In public proceedings documents are often \"taken as\r\nread,\" sometimes with mischievous results; and in discussions propositions\r\nare often taken as thought when they have not been thought and cannot be\r\nthought. It sufficiently taxes imagination to assume, as Professor Weismann\r\ndoes, that two sets of \"ids\" or of \"determinants\" in the same egg are,\r\nthroughout all the cell-divisions which end in the formation of the\r\n_morula_, kept separate, so that they may subsequently energize\r\nindependently; or that if they are not thus kept separate, they have the\r\npower of segregating in the required ways. But what are we to say when\r\nthree, four, and even five sets of \"ids\" or bundles of \"determinants\" are\r\npresent? How is dichotomous division to keep these sets distinct; or if\r\nthey are not kept distinct, what shall we say to the chaos which must arise\r\nafter many fissions, when each set in conflict with the others strives to\r\nproduce its particular structure? And how are the conquering determinants\r\nto find they ways out of the _mêlée_ to the places where they are to fulfil\r\ntheir organizing functions? Even were they all intelligent beings and each\r\nhad a map by which to guide his movements, the problem would be\r\nsufficiently puzzling. Can we assume it to be solved by unconscious units?\r\n\r\nThus even had Professor Weismann shown that the special structures of the\r\ndifferent individuals in an insect-community are not due to differences in\r\nthe nurtures they receive, which he has failed to do, he would still be met\r\nby this difficulty in the way of his own view, in addition to the three\r\nother insuperable difficulties grouped together in a preceding section.\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nThe collateral issue, which has occupied the largest space in the\r\ncontroversy, has, as commonly happens, begotten a second generation of\r\ncollateral issues. Some of these are embodied in the form of questions put\r\nto me, which I must here answer, lest it should be supposed that they are\r\nunanswerable and my view therefore untenable.\r\n\r\nIn the notes he appends to his Romanes Lecture, Professor Weismann\r\nwrites:--\r\n\r\n  \"One of the questions put to Spencer by Ball is quite sufficient to show\r\n  the utter weakness of the position of Lamarckism:--if their\r\n  characteristics did not arise among the workers themselves, but were\r\n  transmitted from the pre-social time, how does it happen that the queens\r\n  and drones of every generation can give anew to the workers the\r\n  characteristics which they themselves have long ago lost?\" (p. 68).\r\n\r\nIt is curious to see put forward in so triumphant a manner, by a professed\r\nnaturalist, a question so easily disposed of. I answer it by putting\r\nanother. How does it happen that among those moths of which the female has\r\nbut rudimentary wings, she continues to endow the males of her species with\r\nwings? How does it happen, for example, that among the _Geometridæ_, the\r\npeculiar structures and habits of which show that they have all descended\r\nfrom a common ancestor, some species have winged females and some wingless\r\nfemales; and that though they have lost the wings the ancestral females\r\nhad, these wingless females convey to the males the normal developments of\r\nwings? Or, still better, how is it that in the _Psychidæ_ there are\r\napterous worm-like females, which lay eggs that bring forth winged males of\r\nthe ordinary imago form? If for males we read workers, the case is parallel\r\nto the cases of those social insects, the queens of which bequeath\r\ncharacteristics they have themselves lost. The ordinary facts of embryonic\r\nevolution yield us analogies. What is the most common trait in the\r\ndevelopment of the sexes? When the sexual organs of either become\r\npronounced, the incipient ancillary organs belonging to the opposite sex\r\ncease to develop and remain rudiments, while the organs special to the sex,\r\nessential and nonessential, become fully developed. What, then, must happen\r\nwith the queen-ant, which, through countless generations, has ceased to use\r\ncertain structures and has lost them from disuse? If one of the eggs which\r\nshe lays, capable, as Professor Weismann admits, of becoming queen, male,\r\nor worker of one or other kind, does not at a certain stage begin actively\r\nto develop its reproductive system, then those organs of the ancestral or\r\npre-social type which the queen has lost begin to develop, and a worker\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty in the way of my view, supposed to be fatal, is that\r\npresented by the Honey-ants--aberrant members of certain ant-colonies which\r\ndevelop so enormously the pouch into which the food is drawn, that the\r\nabdomen becomes little else than a great bladder out of which the head,\r\nthorax, and legs protrude. This, it is thought, cannot be accounted for\r\notherwise than as a consequence of specially endowed eggs, which it has\r\nbecome profitable to the community for the queen to produce. But the\r\nexplanation fits in quite easily with the view I have set forth. No one\r\nwill deny that the taking in of food is the deepest of vital requirements,\r\nand the correlative instinct a dominant one; nor will any one deny that the\r\ninstinct of feeding young is less deeply seated--comes later in order of\r\ntime. So, too, every one will admit that the worker-bee or worker-ant\r\nbefore regurgitating food into the mouth of a larva must first of all take\r\nit in. Hence, alike in order of time and necessity, it is to be assumed\r\nthat development of the nervous structures which guide self-nutrition,\r\nprecedes development of the nervous structures which guide the feeding of\r\nlarvæ. What, then, will in some cases happen, supposing there is an\r\narrested development consequent on innutrition? It will in some cases\r\nhappen that while the nervous centres prompting and regulating deglutition\r\nare fully formed, the formation of those prompting and regulating the\r\nregurgitation of the food into the mouths of larvæ are arrested. What will\r\nbe the consequence? The life of the worker is mainly passed in taking in\r\nfood and putting it out again. If the putting out is stopped its life will\r\nbe mainly passed in taking in food. The receptacle will go on enlarging and\r\nit will eventually assume the monstrous form that we see.[137]\r\n\r\nHere, however, to exclude misinterpretations, let me explain. I by no means\r\ndeny that variation and selection have produced, in these\r\ninsect-communities, certain effects such as Mr. Darwin suggested. Doubtless\r\nant-queens vary; doubtless there are variations in their eggs; doubtless\r\ndifferences of structure in the resulting progeny sometimes prove\r\nadvantageous to the stirp, and originate slight modifications of the\r\nspecies. But such changes, legitimately to be assumed, are changes in\r\nsingle parts--in single organs or portions of organs. Admission of this\r\ndoes not involve admission that there can take place numerous correlated\r\nvariations in different and often remote parts, which must take place\r\nsimultaneously or else be useless. Assumption of this is what Professor\r\nWeismann's argument requires, and assumption of this we have seen to be\r\nabsurd.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the general problem presented by the social insects, let me\r\nremark that the various complexities of action not explained by inheritance\r\nfrom pre-social or semi-social types, are probably due to accumulated and\r\ntransmitted knowledge. I recently read an account of the education of a\r\nbutterfly, carried to the extent that it became quite friendly with its\r\nprotector and would come to be fed. If a non-social and relatively\r\nunintelligent insect is capable of thus far consciously adjusting its\r\nactions, then it seems a reasonable supposition that in a community of\r\nsocial insects there has arisen a mass of experience and usage into which\r\neach new individual is initiated; just as happens among ourselves. We have\r\nonly to consider the chaos which would result were we suddenly bereft of\r\nlanguage, and if the young were left to grow up without precept and\r\nexample, to see that very probably the polity of an insect community is\r\nmade possible by the addition of intelligence to instinct, and the\r\ntransmission of information through sign-language.\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nThere remains now the question of _panmixia_, which stands exactly where it\r\ndid when I published the \"Rejoinder to Professor Weismann.\"\r\n\r\nAfter showing that the interpretation I put upon his view was justified by\r\ncertain passages quoted; and after pointing out that one of his adherents\r\nhad set forth the view which I combated--if not as his view yet as\r\nsupplementary to it; I went on to criticize the view as set forth afresh by\r\nProfessor Weismann himself. I showed that as thus set forth the actuality\r\nof the supposed cause of decrease in disused organs, implies that _minus_\r\nvariations habitually exceed _plus_ variations--in degree or in number, or\r\nin both. Unless it can be proved that such an excess ordinarily occurs, the\r\nhypothesis of _panmixia_ has no place; and I asked, where is the proof that\r\nit occurs.\r\n\r\nNo reply.\r\n\r\nNot content with this abstract form of the question I put it also in a\r\nconcrete form, and granted for the nonce Professor Weismann's assumption:\r\ntaking the case of the rudimentary hind limbs of the whale. I said that\r\nthough, during those early stages of decrease in which the disused limbs\r\nwere external, natural selection probably had a share in decreasing them,\r\nsince they were then impediments to locomotion, yet when they became\r\ninternal, and especially when they had dwindled to nothing but remnants of\r\nthe femurs, it is impossible to suppose that natural selection played any\r\npart: no whale could have survived and initiated a more prosperous stirp in\r\nvirtue of the economy achieved by such a decrease. The operation of natural\r\nselection being out of the question, I inquired whether such a decrease,\r\nsay of one-half when the femurs weighed a few ounces, occurring in one\r\nindividual, could be supposed in the ordinary course of reproduction to\r\naffect the whole of the whale species inhabiting the Arctic Seas and the\r\nNorth Atlantic Ocean; and so on with successive diminutions until the\r\nrudiments had reached their present minuteness. I asked whether such an\r\ninterpretation could be rationally entertained.\r\n\r\nNo reply.\r\n\r\nNow in the absence of replies to these two questions it seems to me that\r\nthe verdict must go against Professor Weismann by default. If he has to\r\nsurrender the hypothesis of _panmixia_, what results? All that evidence\r\ncollected by Mr. Darwin and others, regarded by them as proof of the\r\ninheritance of acquired characters, which was cavalierly set aside on the\r\nstrength of this alleged process of panmixia, is reinstated. And this\r\nreinstated evidence, joined with much evidence since furnished, suffices to\r\nestablish the repudiated interpretation.\r\n\r\nIn the printed report of his Romanes Lecture, after fifty pages of\r\ncomplicated speculations which we are expected to accept as proofs,\r\nProfessor Weismann ends by saying, in reference to the case of the neuter\r\ninsects:--\r\n\r\n  \"This case is of additional interest, as it may serve to convince those\r\n  naturalists who are still inclined to maintain that acquired characters\r\n  are inherited, and to support the Lamarckian principle of development,\r\n  that their view cannot be the right one. It has not proved tenable in a\r\n  single instance\" (p. 54).\r\n\r\nMost readers of the foregoing pages will think that since Professor\r\nWeismann has left one after another of my chief theses without reply, this\r\nis rather a strong assertion; and they will still further raise their\r\neyebrows on remembering that, as I have shown, where he has given answers\r\nhis answers are invalid.\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nAnd now we come to the additions which I indicated at the outset as having\r\nto be made--certain evidences which have come to light since this\r\ncontroversy commenced.\r\n\r\nWhen, by a remembered observation made in boyhood, joined with the familiar\r\nfact that worker-larvæ can be changed into the larvæ of queens by feeding,\r\nI was led to suggest that probably all the variations of form in the social\r\ninsects are consequent on differences of nurture, I was unaware that\r\nobservations and experiments were being made which have justified this\r\nsuggestion. Professor Grassi has recently published accounts of the\r\nfood-habits of two European species of Termites, shewing that the various\r\nforms are due to feeding. He is known to be a most careful observer, and\r\nsome of the most curious of his facts are confirmed by the collection of\r\nwhite ants exhibited by Dr. David Sharp, F.R.S., at the _soirée_ of the\r\nRoyal Society in May last. He has favoured me with the following account of\r\nGrassi's results, which I publish with his assent:--\r\n\r\n  \"There is great variety as to the constituents of the community and\r\n  economy of the species in White Ants. One of the simplest conditions\r\n  known is that studied by Grassi in the case of the European species\r\n  Calotermes flavicollis. In this species there is no worker caste; the\r\n  adult forms are only of two kinds, viz., soldiers, and the males and\r\n  females; the sexes are externally almost indistinguishable, and there are\r\n  males and females of soldiers as well as of the winged forms, though the\r\n  sexual organs do not undergo their full development in any soldier\r\n  whether male or female.\r\n\r\n  \"The soldier is not however a mere instance of simple arrested\r\n  development. It is true that there is in it arrested development of the\r\n  sexual organs, but this is accompanied by change of form of other\r\n  parts--changes so extreme that one would hardly suppose the soldier to\r\n  have any connection with either the young or the adult of the winged\r\n  forms.\r\n\r\n  \"Now according to Grassi the whole of the individuals when born are\r\n  undifferentiated forms (except as to sex), and each one is capable of\r\n  going on the natural course of development and thus becoming a winged\r\n  insect, or can be deviated from this course and made into a soldier; this\r\n  is accomplished by the White Ants by special courses of feeding.\r\n\r\n  \"The evidence given by Grassi is not conclusive as to the young being all\r\n  born alike; and it may be that there are some individuals born that could\r\n  not be deviated from the natural course and made into soldiers. But there\r\n  is one case which seems to show positively that the deviation Grassi\r\n  believes to occur is real, and not due to the selection by the ants of an\r\n  individual that though appearing to our eyes undifferentiated is not\r\n  really so. This is that an individual can be made into a soldier after it\r\n  has visibly undergone one half or more of the development into a winged\r\n  form. The Termites can in fact operate on an individual that has already\r\n  acquired the rudiments of wings and whose head is totally destitute of\r\n  any appearance of the shape of the armature peculiar to the soldier, and\r\n  can turn it into a soldier; the rudiments of the wings being in such a\r\n  case nearly entirely re-absorbed.\"\r\n\r\nGrassi has been for many years engaged in investigating these phenomena,\r\nand there is no reason for rejecting his statement. We can scarcely avoid\r\naccepting it, and if so, Professor Weismann's hypothesis is conclusively\r\ndisposed of. Were there different sets of \"determinants\" for the\r\nsoldier-form and for the winged sexual form, those \"determinants\" which had\r\ngone a long way towards producing the winged sexual form, would inevitably\r\ngo on to complete that form, and could not have their proclivity changed by\r\nfeeding.\r\n\r\n[Yet more evidence to the like effect has since become known. At the\r\nmeeting of the Entomological Society, on March 14, 1894 (reported in\r\n_Nature_, March 29):--\r\n\r\n  \"Dr. D. Sharp, F.R.S., exhibited a collection of white ants (_Termites_),\r\n  formed by Mr. G. D. Haviland in Singapore, which comprised about twelve\r\n  species, of most of which the various forms were obtained. He said that\r\n  Prof. Grassi had recently made observations on the European species, and\r\n  had brought to light some important particulars; and also that in the\r\n  discussion that had recently been carried on between Mr. Herbert Spencer\r\n  and Prof. Weismann, the former had stated that in his opinion the\r\n  different forms of social insects were produced by nutrition. Prof.\r\n  Grassi's observations showed this view to be correct, and the specimens\r\n  now exhibited confirmed one of the most important points in his\r\n  observations. Dr. Sharp also stated that Mr. Haviland found in one nest\r\n  eleven neoteinic queens--that is to say, individuals having the\r\n  appearance of the queen in some respects, while in others they are still\r\n  immature.\"\r\n\r\nAnother similarly conclusive verification I published in _Nature_ for\r\nDecember 6, 1894, under the title \"The Origin of Classes among the\r\n'Parasol' Ants.\" The letter ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. J. H. Hart is Superintendent of the Royal Botanic Gardens in\r\n  Trinidad. He has sent me a copy of his report presented to the\r\n  Legislative Council in March, 1893, and has drawn my attention to certain\r\n  facts contained in it concerning the 'Parasol' ants--the leaf-cutting\r\n  ants which feed on the fungi developed in masses of the cut leaves\r\n  carried to their nests. Both Mr. Bates and Mr. Belt described these ants,\r\n  but described, it seems, different, though nearly allied, species, the\r\n  habits of which are partially unlike. As they are garden-pests, Mr. Hart\r\n  was led to examine into the development and social arrangements of these\r\n  ants; establishing, to that end, artificial nests, after the manner\r\n  adopted by Sir John Lubbock. Several of the facts set down have an\r\n  important bearing on a question now under discussion. The following\r\n  extracts, in which they are named, I abridge by omitting passages not\r\n  relevant to the issue:--\r\n\r\n  \"'The history of my nests is as follows: Nos. 1 and 2 were both taken\r\n  (August 9) on the same day, while destroying nests in the Gardens, and\r\n  were portions of separate nests but of the same species. No. 3 was\r\n  procured on September 5, and is evidently a different although an allied\r\n  species to Nos. 1 and 2.\r\n\r\n  \"'Finding neither of my nests had a queen, I procured one from another\r\n  nest about to be destroyed, and placed it with No. 1 nest. It was\r\n  received by the workers, and at once attended by a numerous retinue in\r\n  royal style. On August 30 I removed the queen from No. 1 and placed it\r\n  with No. 2, when it was again received in a most loyal manner....\r\n\r\n  \"'Ants taken from Nos. 1 and 2 and placed with No. 3 were immediately\r\n  destroyed by the latter, and even the soldiers of No. 3, as well as\r\n  workers or nurses, were destroyed when placed with Nos. 1 and 2.\r\n\r\n  \"'In nest No. 2, from which I removed the queen on August 30, there are\r\n  now in the pupa stage several queens and several males. The forms of ant\r\n  in nests Nos. 1 and 2 are as follows: (_a_) queen, (_b_) male (both\r\n  winged, but the queen loses its wings after marital flight), (_c_) large\r\n  workers, (_d_) small workers, and (_e_) nurses. In nest No. 3 I have not\r\n  yet seen the queen or male, but it possesses--(_a_) soldier, (_b_) larger\r\n  workers, (_c_) smaller workers, and (_d_) nurses; but these are different\r\n  in form to those of nests No. 1 and No. 2. Probably we might add a third\r\n  form of worker, as there are several sizes in the nest....\r\n\r\n  \"'It is curious that in No. 1 nest, from which the queen was removed on\r\n  August 30, new queens and males are now being developed, while in No. 2\r\n  nest, where the queen is at present, nothing but workers have been\r\n  brought out, and if a queen larva or pupa is placed there it is at once\r\n  destroyed, while worker larvæ or pupæ are amicably received. In No. 3 all\r\n  the eggs, larvæ, and pupæ collected with the nest have been hatched, and\r\n  no eggs have since made their appearance to date. There is no queen with\r\n  this nest.... On November 14 I attempted to prove by experiment how small\r\n  a number of \"parasol\" ants it required to form a new colony. I placed two\r\n  dozen of ants (one dozen workers and one dozen nurses) in two separate\r\n  nests, No. 4 and No. 5. With No. 4 I placed a few larvæ with a few rose\r\n  petals for them to manipulate. With No. 5 I gave a small piece of nest\r\n  covered with mycelium. On the 16th these nests were destroyed by small\r\n  foraging ants, known as the \"sugar\" or \"meat\" ant, and I had to remove\r\n  them and replace with a new colony. My notes on these are not\r\n  sufficiently lengthy to be of much importance. But I noted four eggs laid\r\n  on the 16th, or two days after being placed in their new quarters; no\r\n  queen being present. The experiment is being continued. I may mention\r\n  that in No. 4 nest, in which no fungus was present, the larvæ of all\r\n  sizes appeared to change into the pupæ stage at once for want of food [a\r\n  fact corresponding with the fact I have named as observed by myself sixty\r\n  years ago in the case of wasp larvæ]. The circumstance tends to show that\r\n  the development of the insect is influenced entirely by the feeding it\r\n  gets in the larva stage.\r\n\r\n  \"'In nest No. 2 before the introduction of a queen there were no eggs or\r\n  larvæ. The first worker was hatched on October 27, or fifty-seven days\r\n  afterwards, and a continual succession has since been maintained, but as\r\n  yet (November 19) no males or queens have made their appearance.'\r\n\r\n  \"In a letter accompanying the report, Mr. Hart says:--\r\n\r\n  \"'Since these were published, my notes go to prove that ants can\r\n  practically manufacture at will, male, female, soldier, worker, or nurse.\r\n  Some of the workers are capable of laying eggs, and from these can be\r\n  produced all the various forms as well as from a queen's egg.\r\n\r\n  \"'There does not, however, appear to be any difference in the character\r\n  of the food; as I cannot find that the larger larvæ are fed with anything\r\n  different to that given to the smaller.'\r\n\r\n  \"These results were obtained before the recent discussion of the question\r\n  commenced, and joined with the other evidence entirely dispose of those\r\n  arguments which Prof. Weismann bases on facts furnished by the social\r\n  insects.\"]\r\n\r\nThe other piece of additional evidence I have referred to, is furnished by\r\ntwo papers contributed to _The Journal of Anatomy and Physiology_ for\r\nOctober 1893 and April 1894, by R. Havelock Charles, M. D., &c. &c.,\r\nProfessor of Anatomy in the Medical College, Lahore. These papers set forth\r\nthe differences between the leg-bones of Europeans and those of the Punjaub\r\npeople--differences caused by their respective habits of sitting in chairs\r\nand squatting on the ground. He enumerates more than twenty such\r\ndifferences, chiefly in the structures of the knee-joint and ankle-joint.\r\nFrom the _résumé_ of his second paper I quote the following passages, which\r\nsufficiently show the data and the inferences:--\r\n\r\n  \"7. The habits as to sitting postures of Europeans differ from those of\r\n  their prehistoric ancestors, the Cave-dwellers, &c., who probably\r\n  squatted on the ground.\r\n\r\n  \"8. The sitting postures of Orientals are the same now as ever. They have\r\n  retained the habits of their ancestors. The Europeans have not done so.\r\n\r\n  \"9. Want of use would induce changes in form and size, and so, gradually,\r\n  small differences would be integrated till there would be total\r\n  disappearance of the markings on the European skeleton, as no advantage\r\n  would accrue to him from the possession of facets on his bones fitting\r\n  them for postures not practised by him.\r\n\r\n  \"10. The facets seen on the bones of the Panjabi infant or foetus have\r\n  been transmitted to it by the accumulation of peculiarities gained by\r\n  habit in the evolution of its racial type--in which an acquisition having\r\n  become a permanent possession, 'profitable to the individual under its\r\n  conditions of life,' is transmitted as a useful inheritance.\r\n\r\n  \"11. These markings are due to the influence of certain positions, which\r\n  are brought about by the use of groups of muscles, and they are the\r\n  definite results produced by actions of these muscles.\r\n\r\n  \"12. The effects of the use of the muscles mentioned in No. 11 are\r\n  transmitted to the offspring, for the markings are present in the\r\n  _foetus-in-utero_, in the child at birth, and in the infant.\r\n\r\n  \"13. The markings are instances of the transmission of acquired\r\n  characters, which heritage in the individual, function subsequently\r\n  develops.\"\r\n\r\nNo other conclusion appears to me possible. _Panmixia_, even were it not\r\ninvalidated by its unwarranted assumption as above shown, would be out of\r\ncourt: the case is not a case of either increase or decrease of size but of\r\nnumerous changes of form. Simultaneous variation of co-operative parts\r\ncannot be alleged, since these co-operative parts have not changed in one\r\nway but in various ways and degrees. And even were it permissible to\r\nsuppose that the required different variations had taken place\r\nsimultaneously, natural selection cannot be supposed to have operated. The\r\nassumption would imply that in the struggle for existence, individuals of\r\nthe European races who were less capable than others of crouching and\r\nsquatting, gained by those minute changes of structure which incapacitated\r\nthem, such advantages that their stirps prevailed over other stirps--an\r\nabsurd supposition.\r\n\r\nAnd now I must once more point out that a grave responsibility rests on\r\nbiologists in respect of the general question; since wrong answers lead,\r\namong other effects, to wrong beliefs about social affairs and to\r\ndisastrous social actions. In me this conviction has unceasingly\r\nstrengthened. Though _The Origin of Species_ proved to me that the\r\ntransmission of acquired characters cannot be the sole factor in organic\r\nevolution, as I had assumed in _Social Statics_ and in _The Principles of\r\nBiology_, published in pre-Darwinian days, yet I have never wavered in the\r\nbelief that it is a factor and an all-important factor. And I have felt\r\nmore and more that since all the higher sciences are dependent on the\r\nscience of life, and must have their conclusions vitiated if a fundamental\r\ndatum given to them by the teachers of this science is erroneous, it\r\nbehoves these teachers not to let an erroneous datum pass current: they are\r\ncalled on to settle this vexed question one way or other. The times give\r\nproof. The work of Mr. Benjamin Kidd on _Social Evolution_, which has been\r\nso much lauded, takes Weismannism as one of its data; and if Weismannism be\r\nuntrue, the conclusions Mr. Kidd draws must be in large measure erroneous\r\nand may prove mischievous.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.--Since the foregoing pages have been put in type there has\r\nappeared in _Natural Science_ for September, an abstract of certain parts\r\nof a pamphlet by Professor Oscar Hertwig, setting forth facts directly\r\nbearing on Professor Weismann's doctrine respecting the distinction between\r\nreproductive cells and somatic cells. In _The Principles of Biology_, § 77,\r\nI contended that reproductive cells differ from other cells composing the\r\norganism, only in being unspecialized. And in support of the hypothesis\r\nthat tissue-cells in general have a reproductive potentiality, I instanced\r\nthe cases of the _Begonia phyllomaniaca_ and _Malaxis paludosa_. In the\r\nthirty years which have since elapsed, many facts of like significance have\r\nbeen brought to light, and various of these are given by Professor Hertwig.\r\nHere are some of them:--\r\n\r\n  \"Galls are produced under the stimulus of the insect almost anywhere on\r\n  the surface of a plant. Yet in most cases these galls, in a sense grown\r\n  at random on the surface of a plant, when placed in damp earth will give\r\n  rise to a young plant. In the hydroid _Tubularia mesembryanthemum_, when\r\n  the polyp heads are cut off, new heads arise. But if both head and root\r\n  be cut off, and the upper end be inserted in the mud, then from the\r\n  original upper end not head-polyps but root filaments will arise, while\r\n  from the original lower end not root filaments but head-polyps will\r\n  grow.... Driesch, by separating the first two and the first four\r\n  segmentation spheres of an _Echinus_ ovum, obtained two or four normal\r\n  plutei, respectively one half and a quarter of the normal size.... So,\r\n  also, in the case of _Amphioxus_, Wilson obtained a normal, but\r\n  proportionately diminished embryo with complete nervous system from a\r\n  separated sphere of a two- or four- or eight celled stage.... Chabry\r\n  obtained normal embryos in cases where some of the segmentation-spheres\r\n  had been artificially destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nThese evidences, furnished by independent observers, unite in showing,\r\nfirstly, that all the multiplying cells of the developing embryo are alike;\r\nand, secondly, that the soma-cells of the adult severally retain, in a\r\nlatent form, all the powers of the original embryo-cell. If these facts do\r\nnot disprove absolutely Professor Weismann's hypothesis, we may wonderingly\r\nask what facts would disprove it?\r\n\r\nSince Hertwig holds that all the cells forming an organism of any species\r\nprimarily consist of the same components, I at first thought that his\r\nhypothesis was identical with my own hypothesis of \"physiological units,\"\r\nor, as I would now call them, constitutional units. It seems otherwise,\r\nhowever; for he thinks that each cell contains \"only those material\r\nparticles which are bearers of cell-properties,\" and that organs \"are the\r\nfunctions of cell-complexes.\" To this it may be replied that the ability to\r\nform the appropriate cell-complexes, itself depends upon the constitutional\r\nunits contained in the cells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C.\r\n\r\nTHE INHERITANCE OF FUNCTIONALLY-WROUGHT MODIFICATIONS: A SUMMARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe assertion that changes of structure caused by changes of function are\r\ntransmitted to descendants is continually met by the question--Where is the\r\nevidence? When some facts are assigned in proof, they are pooh-poohed as\r\ninsufficient. If after a time the question is raised afresh and other facts\r\nare named, there is a like supercilious treatment of them. Successively\r\nrejected in this way, the evidences do not accumulate in the minds of\r\nopponents; and hence produce little or no effect. When they are brought\r\ntogether, however, it turns out that they are numerous and weighty. We will\r\ngroup them into negative and positive.\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nNegative evidence is furnished by those cases in which traits otherwise\r\ninexplicable are explained if the structural effects of use and disuse are\r\ntransmitted. In the foregoing chapters and appendices three have been\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n(1) Co-adaptation of co-operative parts comes first. This has been\r\nexemplified by the case of enlarged horns in a stag, by the case of an\r\nanimal led into the habit of leaping, and in the case of the giraffe (cited\r\nin \"The Factors of Organic Evolution\"); and it has been shown that the\r\nimplied co-adaptations of parts cannot possibly have been effected by\r\nnatural selection.\r\n\r\n(2) The possession of unlike powers of discrimination by different parts of\r\nthe human skin, was named as a problem to be solved on the hypothesis of\r\nnatural selection or the hypothesis of panmixia; and it was shown that\r\nneither of these can by any twisting yield a solution. But the facts\r\nharmonize with the hypothesis that the effects of use are inherited.\r\n\r\n(3) Then come the cases of those rudimentary organs which, like the hind\r\nlimbs of the whale, have nearly disappeared. Dwindling by natural selection\r\nis here out of the question; and dwindling by panmixia, even were its\r\nassumptions valid, would be incredible. But as a sequence of disuse the\r\nchange is clearly explained.\r\n\r\nFailure to solve any _one_ of these three problems would, I think, alone\r\nprove the Neo-Darwinian doctrines untenable; and the fact that we have\r\n_three_ unsolved problems seems to me fatal.\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nFrom this negative evidence, turn now to the positive evidence. This falls\r\ninto several groups.\r\n\r\nThere are first the facts collected by Mr. Darwin, implying\r\nfunctionally-altered structures in domestic animals. The hypothesis of\r\npanmixia is, as we have seen, out of court; and therefore Mr. Darwin's\r\ngroups of evidences are reinstated. There is the changed ratio of\r\nwing-bones and leg-bones in the duck; there are the drooping ears of cats\r\nin China, of horses in Russia, of sheep in Italy, of guinea-pigs in\r\nGermany, of goats and cattle in India, of rabbits, pigs, and dogs in all\r\nlong-civilized countries. Though artificial selection has come into play\r\nwhere drooping has become a curious trait (as in rabbits), and has probably\r\ncaused the greater size of ears which has in some cases gone along with\r\ndiminished muscular power over them; yet it could not have been the\r\ninitiator, and has not been operative on animals bred for profit. Again\r\nthere are the changes produced by climate; as instance, among plants, the\r\nseveral varieties of maize established in Germany and transformed in the\r\ncourse of a few generations.\r\n\r\nFacts of another class are yielded by the blind inhabitants of caverns. One\r\nwho studies the memoir by Mr. Packard on _The Cave Fauna of North America_,\r\n&c., will be astonished at the variety of types in which degeneration or\r\nloss of the eyes has become a concomitant of life passed in darkness. A\r\ngreat increase in the force of this evidence will be recognized on learning\r\nthat absence or extreme imperfection of visual organs is found also in\r\ncreatures living in perpetual night at the bottoms of deep oceans.\r\nEndeavours to account for these facts otherwise than by the effects of\r\ndisuse we have seen to be futile.\r\n\r\nKindred evidence is yielded by decrease of the jaws in those races which\r\nhave had diminished use of them--mankind and certain domestic animals.\r\nRelative smallness in the jaws of civilized men, manifest enough on\r\ncomparison, has been proved by direct measurement. In pet dogs--pugs,\r\nhousehold spaniels--we find associated the same cause with the same effect.\r\nThough there has been artificial selection, yet this did not operate until\r\nthe diminution had become manifest. Moreover there has been diminution of\r\nthe other structures concerned in biting: there are smaller muscles, feeble\r\nzygomata, and diminished areas for insertion of muscles--traits which\r\ncannot have resulted from selection, since they are invisible in the living\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nIn abnormal vision produced by abnormal use of the eyes we have evidence of\r\nanother kind. That the Germans, among whom congenital short sight is\r\nnotoriously prevalent, have been made shortsighted by inheritance of\r\nmodifications due to continual reading of print requiring close attention,\r\nis by some disputed. It is strange, however, that if there exists no causal\r\nconnexion between them, neither trait occurs without the other elsewhere.\r\nBut for the belief that there is a causal connexion we have the verifying\r\ntestimony of oculists. From Dr. Lindsay Johnson I have cited cases within\r\nhis professional experience of functionally-produced myopia transmitted to\r\nchildren; and he asserts that other oculists have had like experiences.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of the musical faculty in the successive members of families\r\nfrom which the great composers have come, as well as in the civilized races\r\nat large, is not to be explained by natural selection. Even when it is\r\ngreat, the musical faculty has not a life-saving efficiency as compared\r\nwith the average of faculties; for the most highly gifted have commonly\r\npassed less prosperous lives and left fewer offspring than have those\r\npossessed of ordinary abilities. Still less can it be said that the musical\r\nfaculty in mankind at large has been developed by survival of the fittest.\r\nNo one will assert that men in general have been enabled to survive and\r\npropagate in proportion as their musical appreciation was great.\r\n\r\nThe transmission of nervous peculiarities functionally produced is alleged\r\nby the highest authorities--Dr. Savage, president of the Neurological\r\nSociety, and Dr. Hughlings Jackson. The evidence they assign confirms, and\r\nis confirmed by, that which the development of the musical faculty above\r\nnamed supplies.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have sundry groups of facts directly supporting the belief\r\nthat functionally-wrought modifications descend from parents to offspring.\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nNow let us consider the position of those Darwinians who dissent from\r\nDarwin, and who make light of all this evidence. We might naturally suppose\r\nthat their own hypothesis is unassailable. Yet, strange to say, they admit\r\nthat there is no direct proof that any species has been established by\r\nnatural selection. The proof is inferential only.\r\n\r\nThe certainty of an axiom does not give certainty to the deductions drawn\r\nfrom it. That natural selection is, and always has been, operative is\r\nincontestable. Obviously I should be the last person to deny that survival\r\nof the fittest is a necessity: its negation is inconceivable. The\r\nNeo-Darwinians, however, judging from their attitude, apparently assume\r\nthat firmness of the basis implies firmness of the superstructure. But\r\nhowever high may be the probability of some of the conclusions drawn, none\r\nof them can have more than probability; while some of them remain, and are\r\nlikely to remain, very questionable. Observe the difficulties.\r\n\r\n(1) The general argument proceeds upon the analogy between natural\r\nselection and artificial selection. Yet all know that the first cannot do\r\nwhat the last does. Natural selection can do nothing more than preserve\r\nthose of which the _aggregate_ characters are most favourable to life. It\r\ncannot pick out those possessed of one particular favourable character,\r\nunless this is of extreme importance.\r\n\r\n(2) In many cases a structure is of no service until it has reached a\r\ncertain development; and it remains to account for that increase of it by\r\nnatural selection which must be supposed to take place before it reaches\r\nthe stage of usefulness.\r\n\r\n(3) Advantageous variations, not preserved in nature as they are by the\r\nbreeder, are liable to be swamped by crossing or to disappear by atavism.\r\n\r\nNow whatever replies are made, their component propositions cannot be\r\nnecessary truths. So that the conclusion in each case, however reasonable,\r\ncannot claim certainty: the fabric can have no stability like that of its\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nWhen to uncertainties in the arguments supporting the hypothesis we add its\r\ninability to explain facts of cardinal significance, as proved above, there\r\nis I think ground for asserting that natural selection is less clearly\r\nshown to be a factor in the origination of species than is the inheritance\r\nof functionally-wrought changes.\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nIf, finally, it is said that the mode in which functionally-wrought\r\nchanges, especially in small parts, so affect the reproductive elements as\r\nto repeat themselves in offspring, cannot be imagined--if it be held\r\ninconceivable that those minute changes in the organs of vision which cause\r\nmyopia can be transmitted through the appropriately-modified sperm-cells or\r\ngerm-cells; then the reply is that the opposed hypothesis presents a\r\ncorresponding inconceivability. Grant that the habit of a pointer was\r\nproduced by selection of those in which an appropriate variation in the\r\nnervous system had occurred; it is impossible to imagine how a\r\nslightly-different arrangement of a few nerve-cells and fibres could be\r\nconveyed by a spermatozoon. So too it is impossible to imagine how in a\r\nspermatozoon there can be conveyed the 480,000 independent variables\r\nrequired for the construction of a single peacock's feather, each having a\r\nproclivity towards its proper place. Clearly the ultimate process by which\r\ninheritance is effected in either case passes comprehension; and in this\r\nrespect neither hypothesis has an advantage over the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX D.\r\n\r\nON ALLEGED \"SPONTANEOUS GENERATION,\" AND ON THE HYPOTHESIS OF PHYSIOLOGICAL\r\nUNITS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_The following letter, originally written for publication in the_ North\r\nAmerican Review, _but declined by the Editor in pursuance of a general\r\nrule, and eventually otherwise published in the United States, I have\r\nthought well to append to this first volume of the_ Principles of Biology.\r\n_I do this because the questions which it discusses are dealt with in this\r\nvolume; and because the further explanations it furnishes seem needful to\r\nprevent misapprehensions._]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Editor of the North American Review._\r\n\r\n    SIR,\r\n\r\nIt is in most cases unwise to notice adverse criticisms. Either they do not\r\nadmit of answers or the answers may be left to the penetration of readers.\r\nWhen, however, a critic's allegations touch the fundamental propositions of\r\na book, and especially when they appear in a periodical having the position\r\nof the _North American Review_, the case is altered. For these reasons the\r\narticle on \"Philosophical Biology,\" published in your last number, demands\r\nfrom me an attention which ordinary criticisms do not.\r\n\r\nIt is the more needful for me to notice it, because its two leading\r\nobjections have the one an actual fairness and the other an apparent\r\nfairness; and in the absence of explanations from me, they will be\r\nconsidered as substantiated even by many, or perhaps most, of those who\r\nhave read the work itself--much more by those who have not read it. That to\r\nprevent the spread of misapprehensions I ought to say something, is further\r\nshown by the fact that the same two objections have already been made in\r\nEngland--the one by Dr. Child, of Oxford, in his _Essays on Physiological\r\nSubjects_, and the other by a writer in the _Westminster Review_ for July,\r\n1865.\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nIn the note to which your reviewer refers, I have, as he says, tacitly\r\nrepudiated the belief in \"spontaneous generation;\" and that I have done\r\nthis in such a way as to leave open the door for the interpretation given\r\nby him is true. Indeed the fact that Dr. Child, whose criticism is a\r\nsympathetic one, puts the same construction on this note, proves that your\r\nreviewer has but drawn what seems to be a necessary inference.\r\nNevertheless, the inference is one which I did not intend to be drawn.\r\n\r\nIn explanation, let me at the outset remark that I am placed at a\r\ndisadvantage in having had to omit that part of the System of Philosophy\r\nwhich deals with Inorganic Evolution. In the original programme will be\r\nfound a parenthetic reference to this omitted part, which should, as there\r\nstated, precede the _Principles of Biology_. Two volumes are missing. The\r\nclosing chapter of the second, were it written, would deal with the\r\nevolution of organic matter--the step preceding the evolution of living\r\nforms. Habitually carrying with me in thought the contents of this\r\nunwritten chapter, I have, in some cases, expressed myself as though the\r\nreader had it before him; and have thus rendered some of my statements\r\nliable to misconstructions. Apart from this, however, the explanation of\r\nthe apparent inconsistency is very simple, if not very obvious. In the\r\nfirst place, I do not believe in the \"spontaneous generation\" commonly\r\nalleged, and referred to in the note; and so little have I associated in\r\nthought this alleged \"spontaneous generation\" which I disbelieve, with the\r\ngeneration by evolution which I do believe, that the repudiation of the one\r\nnever occurred to me as liable to be taken for repudiation of the other.\r\nThat creatures having _quite specific structures_ are evolved in the course\r\nof a few hours, without antecedents calculated to determine their specific\r\nforms, is to me incredible. Not only the established truths of Biology, but\r\nthe established truths of science in general, negative the supposition that\r\norganisms having structures definite enough to identify them as belonging\r\nto known genera and species, can be produced in the absence of germs\r\nderived from antecedent organisms of the same genera and species. If there\r\ncan suddenly be imposed on simple protoplasm the organization which\r\nconstitutes it a _Paramoecium_, I see no reason why animals of greater\r\ncomplexity, or indeed of any complexity, may not be constituted after the\r\nsame manner. In brief, I do not accept these alleged facts as exemplifying\r\nEvolution, because they imply something immensely beyond that which\r\nEvolution, as I understand it, can achieve. In the second place, my\r\ndisbelief extends not only to the alleged cases of \"spontaneous\r\ngeneration,\" but to every case akin to them. The very conception of\r\nspontaneity is wholly incongruous with the conception of Evolution. For\r\nthis reason I regard as objectionable Mr. Darwin's phrase \"spontaneous\r\nvariation\" (as indeed he does himself); and I have sought to show that\r\nthere are always assignable causes of variation. No form of Evolution,\r\ninorganic or organic, can be spontaneous; but in every instance the\r\nantecedent forces must be adequate in their quantities, kinds, and\r\ndistributions, to work the observed effects. Neither the alleged cases of\r\n\"spontaneous generation,\" nor any imaginable cases in the least allied to\r\nthem, fulfil this requirement.\r\n\r\nIf, accepting these alleged cases of \"spontaneous generation,\" I had\r\nassumed, as your reviewer seems to do, that the evolution of organic life\r\ncommenced in an analogous way; then, indeed, I should have left myself open\r\nto a fatal criticism. This supposed \"spontaneous generation\" habitually\r\noccurs in menstrua that contain either organic matter, or matter originally\r\nderived from organisms; and such organic matter, proceeding in all known\r\ncases from organisms of a higher kind, implies the pre-existence of such\r\nhigher organisms. By what kind of logic, then, is it inferrible that\r\norganic life was initiated after a manner like that in which _Infusoria_\r\nare said to be now spontaneously generated? Where, before life commenced,\r\nwere the superior organisms from which these lowest organisms obtained\r\ntheir organic matter? Without doubting that there are those who, as the\r\nreviewer says, \"can penetrate deeper than Mr. Spencer has done into the\r\nidea of universal evolution,\" and who, as he contends, prove this by\r\naccepting the doctrine of \"spontaneous generation\"; I nevertheless think\r\nthat I can penetrate deep enough to see that a tenable hypothesis\r\nrespecting the origin of organic life must be reached by some other clue\r\nthan that furnished by experiments on decoction of hay and extract of beef.\r\n\r\nFrom what I do not believe, let me now pass to what I do believe. Granting\r\nthat the formation of organic matter, and the evolution of life in its\r\nlowest forms, may go on under existing cosmical conditions; but believing\r\nit more likely that the formation of such matter and such forms, took place\r\nat a time when the heat of the Earth's surface was falling through those\r\nranges of temperature at which the higher organic compounds are unstable; I\r\nconceive that the moulding of such organic matter into the simplest types,\r\nmust have commenced with portions of protoplasm more minute, more\r\nindefinite, and more inconstant in their characters, than the lowest\r\nRhizopods--less distinguishable from a mere fragment of albumen than even\r\nthe _Protogenes_ of Professor Haeckel. The evolution of specific shapes\r\nmust, like all other organic evolution, have resulted from the actions and\r\nreactions between such incipient types and their environments, and the\r\ncontinued survival of those which happened to have specialities best fitted\r\nto the specialities of their environments. To reach by this process the\r\ncomparatively well-specialized forms of ordinary _Infusoria_, must, I\r\nconceive, have taken an enormous period of time.\r\n\r\nTo prevent, as far as may be, future misapprehension, let me elaborate this\r\nconception so as to meet the particular objections raised. The reviewer\r\ntakes for granted that a \"first organism\" must be assumed by me, as it is\r\nby himself. But the conception of a \"first organism,\" in anything like the\r\ncurrent sense of the words, is wholly at variance with conception of\r\nevolution; and scarcely less at variance with the facts revealed by the\r\nmicroscope. The lowest living things are not properly speaking organisms at\r\nall; for they have no distinctions of parts--no traces of organization. It\r\nis almost a misuse of language to call them \"forms\" of life: not only are\r\ntheir outlines, when distinguishable, too unspecific for description, but\r\nthey change from moment to moment and are never twice alike, either in two\r\nindividuals or in the same individual. Even the word \"type\" is applicable\r\nin but a loose way; for there is little constancy in their generic\r\ncharacters: according as the surrounding conditions determine, they undergo\r\ntransformations now of one kind and now of another. And the vagueness, the\r\ninconstancy, the want of appreciable structure, displayed by the simplest\r\nof living things as we now see them, are characters (or absences of\r\ncharacters) which, on the hypothesis of Evolution, must have been still\r\nmore decided when, as at first, no \"forms,\" no \"types,\" no \"specific\r\nshapes,\" had been moulded. That \"absolute commencement of organic life on\r\nthe globe,\" which the reviewer says I \"cannot evade the admission of,\" I\r\ndistinctly deny. The affirmation of universal evolution is in itself the\r\nnegation of an \"absolute commencement\" of anything. Construed in terms of\r\nevolution, every kind of being is conceived as a product of modifications\r\nwrought by insensible gradations on a pre-existing kind of being; and this\r\nholds as fully of the supposed \"commencement of organic life\" as of all\r\nsubsequent developments of organic life. It is no more needful to suppose\r\nan \"absolute commencement of organic life\" or a \"first organism,\" than it\r\nis needful to suppose an absolute commencement of social life and a first\r\nsocial organism. The assumption of such a necessity in this last case, made\r\nby early speculators with their theories of \"social contracts\" and the\r\nlike, is disproved by the facts; and the facts, so far as they are\r\nascertained, disprove the assumption of such a necessity in the first case.\r\nThat organic matter was not produced all at once, but was reached through\r\nsteps, we are well warranted in believing by the experiences of chemists.\r\nOrganic matters are produced in the laboratory by what we may literally\r\ncall _artificial evolution_. Chemists find themselves unable to form these\r\ncomplex combinations directly from their elements; but they succeed in\r\nforming them indirectly, by successive modifications of simpler\r\ncombinations. In some binary compound, one element of which is present in\r\nseveral equivalents, a change is made by substituting for one of these\r\nequivalents an equivalent of some other element; so producing a ternary\r\ncompound. Then another of the equivalents is replaced, and so on. For\r\ninstance, beginning with ammonia, N H_{3}, a higher form is obtained by\r\nreplacing one of the atoms of hydrogen by an atom of methyl, so producing\r\nmethyl-amine, N (C H_{3} H_{2}); and then, under the further action of\r\nmethyl, ending in a further substitution, there is reached the still more\r\ncompound substance dimethyl-amine, N (C H_{3}) (C H_{3}) H. And in this\r\nmanner highly complex substances are eventually built up. Another\r\ncharacteristic of their method is no less significant. Two complex\r\ncompounds are employed to generate, by their action upon one another, a\r\ncompound of still greater complexity: different heterogeneous molecules of\r\none stage, become parents of a molecule a stage higher in heterogeneity.\r\nThus, having built up acetic acid out of its elements, and having by the\r\nprocess of substitution described above, changed the acetic acid into\r\npropionic acid, and propionic into butyric, of which the formula is\r\n\r\n  {C(CH_{3})(CH_{3})H}\r\n  {CO(HO)            };\r\n\r\nthis complex compound, by operating on another complex compound, such as\r\nthe dimethyl-amine named above, generates one of still greater complexity,\r\nbutyrate of dimethyl-amine\r\n\r\n  {C(CH)(CH_{3})H} N(CH_{3})(CH_{3})H.\r\n  {CO(HO)        }\r\n\r\nSee, then, the remarkable parallelism. The progress towards higher types of\r\norganic molecules is effected by modifications upon modifications; as\r\nthroughout Evolution in general. Each of these modifications is a change of\r\nthe molecule into equilibrium with its environment--an adaptation, as it\r\nwere, to new surrounding conditions to which it is subjected; as throughout\r\nEvolution in general. Larger, or more integrated, aggregates (for compound\r\nmolecules are such) are successively generated; as throughout Evolution in\r\ngeneral. More complex or heterogeneous aggregates are so made to arise, one\r\nout of another; as throughout Evolution in general. A\r\ngeometrically-increasing multitude of these larger and more complex\r\naggregates so produced, at the same time results; as throughout Evolution\r\nin general. And it is by the action of the successively higher forms on one\r\nanother, joined with the action of environing conditions, that the highest\r\nforms are reached; as throughout Evolution in general.\r\n\r\nWhen we thus see the identity of method at the two extremes--when we see\r\nthat the general laws of evolution, as they are exemplified in known\r\norganisms, have been unconsciously conformed to by chemists in the\r\nartificial evolution of organic matter; we can scarcely doubt that these\r\nlaws were conformed to in the natural evolution of organic matter, and\r\nafterwards in the evolution of the simplest organic forms. In the early\r\nworld, as in the modern laboratory, inferior types of organic substances,\r\nby their mutual actions under fit conditions, evolved the superior types of\r\norganic substances, ending in organizable protoplasm. And it can hardly be\r\ndoubted that the shaping of organizable protoplasm, which is a substance\r\nmodifiable in multitudinous ways with extreme facility, went on after the\r\nsame manner. As I learn from one of our first chemists, Prof. Frankland,\r\n_protein_ is capable of existing under probably at least a thousand\r\nisomeric forms; and, as we shall presently see, it is capable of forming,\r\nwith itself and other elements, substances yet more intricate in\r\ncomposition, that are practically infinite in their varieties of kind.\r\nExposed to those innumerable modifications of conditions which the Earth's\r\nsurface afforded, here in amount of light, there in amount of heat, and\r\nelsewhere in the mineral quality of its aqueous medium, this extremely\r\nchangeable substance must have undergone now one, now another, of its\r\ncountless metamorphoses. And to the mutual influences of its metamorphic\r\nforms under favouring conditions, we may ascribe the production of the\r\nstill more composite, still more sensitive, still more variously-changeable\r\nportions of organic matter, which, in masses more minute and simpler than\r\nexisting _Protozoa_, displayed actions verging little by little into those\r\ncalled vital--actions which protein itself exhibits in a certain degree,\r\nand which the lowest known living things exhibit only in a greater degree.\r\nThus, setting out with inductions from the experiences of organic chemists\r\nat the one extreme, and with inductions from the observations of biologists\r\nat the other extreme, we are enabled deductively to bridge the\r\ninterval--are enabled to conceive how organic compounds were evolved, and\r\nhow, by a continuance of the process, the nascent life displayed in these\r\nbecame gradually more pronounced. And this it is which has to be explained,\r\nand which the alleged cases of \"spontaneous generation\" would not, were\r\nthey substantiated, help us in the least to explain.\r\n\r\nIt is thus manifest, I think, that I have not fallen into the alleged\r\ninconsistency. Nevertheless, I admit that your reviewer was justified in\r\ninferring this inconsistency; and I take blame to myself for not having\r\nseen that the statement, as I have left it, is open to misconstruction.\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nI pass now to the second allegation--that in ascribing to certain specific\r\nmolecules, which I have called \"physiological units,\" the aptitude to build\r\nthemselves into the structure of the organism to which they are peculiar, I\r\nhave abandoned my own principle, and have assumed something beyond the\r\nre-distribution of Matter and Motion. As put by the reviewer, his case\r\nappears to be well made out; and that he is not altogether unwarranted in\r\nso putting it, may be admitted. Nevertheless, there does not in reality\r\nexist the supposed incongruity.\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to make clear the adequacy of the conception which I am\r\nsaid to have tacitly abandoned as insufficient, let me remove that excess\r\nof improbability the reviewer gives to it, by the extremely-restricted\r\nmeaning with which he uses the word mechanical. In discussing a proposition\r\nof mine he says:--\r\n\r\n  \"He then cites certain remarks of Mr. Paget on the permanent effects\r\n  wrought in the blood by the poison of scarlatina and small-pox, as\r\n  justifying the belief that such a 'power' exists, and attributes the\r\n  repair of a wasted tissue to 'forces analogous to those by which a\r\n  crystal reproduces its lost apex.' (Neither of which phenomena, however,\r\n  is explicable by mechanical causes.)\"\r\n\r\nWere it not for the deliberation with which this last statement is made, I\r\nshould take it for a slip of the pen. As it is, however, I have no course\r\nleft but to suppose the reviewer unaware of the fact that molecular actions\r\nof all kinds are now not only conceived as mechanical actions, but that\r\ncalculations based on this conception of them, bring out the results that\r\ncorrespond with observation. There is no kind of re-arrangement among\r\nmolecules (crystallization being one) which the modern physicist does not\r\nthink of. and correctly reason upon, in terms of forces and motions like\r\nthose of sensible masses. Polarity is regarded as a resultant of such\r\nforces and motions; and when, as happens in many cases, light changes the\r\nmolecular structure of a crystal, and alters its polarity, it does this by\r\nimpressing, in conformity with mechanical laws, new motions on the\r\nconstituent molecules. That the reviewer should present the mechanical\r\nconception under so extremely limited a form, is the more surprising to me\r\nbecause, at the outset of the very work he reviews, I have, in various\r\npassages, based inferences on those immense extensions of it which he\r\nignores; indicating, for example, the interpretation it yields of the\r\ninorganic chemical changes effected by heat, and the organic chemical\r\nchanges effected by light (_Principles of Biology_, § 13).\r\n\r\nPremising, then, that the ordinary idea of mechanical action must be\r\ngreatly expanded, let us enter upon the question at issue--the sufficiency\r\nof the hypothesis that the structure of each organism is determined by the\r\npolarities of the special molecules, or physiological units, peculiar to it\r\nas a species, which necessitate tendencies towards special arrangements. My\r\nproposition and the reviewer's criticism upon it, will be most conveniently\r\npresented if I quote in full a passage of his from which I have already\r\nextracted some expressions. He says:--\r\n\r\n  \"It will be noticed, however, that Mr. Spencer attributes the possession\r\n  of these 'tendencies,' or 'proclivities,' to natural inheritance from\r\n  ancestral organisms; and it may be argued that he thus saves the\r\n  mechanist theory and his own consistency at the same time, inasmuch as he\r\n  derives even the 'tendencies' themselves ultimately from the environment.\r\n  To this we reply, that Mr. Spencer, who advocates the nebular hypothesis,\r\n  cannot evade the admission of an absolute commencement of organic life on\r\n  the globe, and that the 'formative tendencies,' without which he cannot\r\n  explain the evolution of a single individual, could not have been\r\n  inherited by the first organism. Besides, by his virtual denial of\r\n  spontaneous generation, he denies that the first organism was evolved out\r\n  of the inorganic world, and thus shuts himself off from the argument\r\n  (otherwise plausible) that its 'tendencies' were ultimately derived from\r\n  the environment.\"\r\n\r\nThis assertion is already in great measure disposed of by what has been\r\nsaid above. Holding that, though not \"spontaneously generated,\" those\r\nminute portions of protoplasm which first displayed in the feeblest degree\r\nthat changeability taken to imply life, were evolved, I am _not_ debarred\r\nfrom the argument that the \"tendencies\" of the physiological units are\r\nderived from the inherited effects of environing actions. If the conception\r\nof a \"first organism\" were a necessary one, the reviewer's objection would\r\nbe valid. If there were an \"absolute commencement\" of life, a definite line\r\nparting organic matter from the simplest living forms, I should be placed\r\nin the predicament he describes. But as the doctrine of Evolution itself\r\ntacitly negatives any such distinct separation; and as the negation is the\r\nmore confirmed by the facts the more we know of them; I do not feel that I\r\nam entangled in the alleged difficulty. My reply might end here; but as the\r\nhypothesis in question is one not easily conceived, and very apt to be\r\nmisunderstood, I will attempt a further elucidation of it.\r\n\r\nMuch evidence now conspires to show that molecules of the substances we\r\ncall elementary are in reality compound; and that, by the combination of\r\nthese with one another, and re-combinations of the products, there are\r\nformed systems of systems of molecules, unimaginable in their complexity.\r\nStep by step as the aggregate molecules so resulting, grow larger and\r\nincrease in heterogeneity, they become more unstable, more readily\r\ntransformable by small forces, more capable of assuming various characters.\r\nThose composing organic matter transcend all others in size and intricacy\r\nof structure; and in them these resulting traits reach their extreme. As\r\nimplied by its name _protein_, the essential substance of which organisms\r\nare built, is remarkable alike for the variety of its metamorphoses and the\r\nfacility with which it undergoes them: it changes from one to another of\r\nits thousand isomeric forms on the slightest change of conditions. Now\r\nthere are facts warranting the belief that though these multitudinous\r\nisomeric forms of protein will not unite directly with one another, yet\r\nthey admit of being linked together by other elements with which they\r\ncombine. And it is very significant that there are habitually present two\r\nother elements, sulphur and phosphorus, which have quite special powers of\r\nholding together many equivalents--the one being pentatomic and the other\r\nhexatomic. So that it is a legitimate supposition (justified by analogies)\r\nthat an atom of sulphur may be a bond of union among half-a-dozen different\r\nisomeric forms of protein; and similarly with phosphorus. A moment's\r\nthought will show that, setting out with the thousand isomeric forms of\r\nprotein, this makes possible a number of these combinations almost passing\r\nthe power of figures to express. Molecules so produced, perhaps exceeding\r\nin size and complexity those of protein as those of protein exceed those of\r\ninorganic matter, may, I conceive, be the special units belonging to\r\nspecial kinds of organisms. By their constitution they must have a\r\nplasticity, or sensitiveness to modifying forces, far beyond that of\r\nprotein; and bearing in mind not only that their varieties are practically\r\ninfinite in number, but that closely allied forms of them, chemically\r\nindifferent to one another as they must be, may coexist in the same\r\naggregate, we shall see that they are fitted for entering into unlimited\r\nvarieties of organic structures.\r\n\r\nThe existence of such physiological units, peculiar to each species of\r\norganism, is not unaccounted for. They are evolved simultaneously with the\r\nevolution of the organisms they compose--they differentiate as fast as\r\nthese organisms differentiate; and are made multitudinous in kind by the\r\nsame actions which make the organism they compose multitudinous, in kind.\r\nThis conception is clearly representable in terms of the mechanical\r\nhypothesis. Every physicist will endorse the proposition that in each\r\naggregate there tends to establish itself an equilibrium between the forces\r\nexercised by all the units upon each and by each upon all. Even in masses\r\nof substance so rigid as iron and glass, there goes on a molecular\r\nre-arrangement, slow or rapid according as circumstances facilitate, which\r\nends only when there is a complete balance between the actions of the parts\r\non the whole and the actions of the whole on the parts: the implications\r\nbeing that every change in the form or size of the whole, necessitates some\r\nredistribution of the parts. And though in cases like these, there occurs\r\nonly a polar re-arrangement of the molecules, without changes in the\r\nmolecules themselves; yet where, as often happens, there is a passage from\r\nthe colloid to the crystalloid state, a change of constitution occurs in\r\nthe molecules themselves. These truths are not limited to inorganic matter:\r\nthey unquestionably hold of organic matter. As certainly as molecules of\r\nalum have a form of equilibrium, the octahedron, into which they fall when\r\nthe temperature of their solvent allows them to aggregate, so certainly\r\nmust organic molecules of each kind, no matter how complex, have a form of\r\nequilibrium in which, when they aggregate, their complex forces are\r\nbalanced--a form far less rigid and definite, for the reason that they have\r\nfar less definite polarities, are far more unstable, and have their\r\ntendencies more easily modified by environing conditions. Equally certain\r\nis it that the special molecules having a special organic structure as\r\ntheir form of equilibrium, must be reacted upon by the total forces of this\r\norganic structure; and that, if environing actions lead to any change in\r\nthis organic structure, these special molecules, or physiological units,\r\nsubject to a changed distribution of the total forces acting upon them will\r\nundergo modification--modification which their extreme plasticity will\r\nrender easy. By this action and reaction I conceive the physiological units\r\npeculiar to each kind of organism, to have been moulded along with the\r\norganism itself. Setting out with the stage in which protein in minute\r\naggregates, took on those simplest differentiations which fitted it for\r\ndifferently-conditioned parts of its medium, there must have unceasingly\r\ngone on perpetual re-adjustments of balance between aggregates and their\r\nunits--actions and reactions of the two, in which the units tended ever to\r\nestablish the typical form produced by actions and reactions in all\r\nantecedent generations, while the aggregate, if changed in form by change\r\nof surrounding conditions, tended ever to impress on the units a\r\ncorresponding change of polarity, causing them in the next generation to\r\nreproduce the changed form--their new form of equilibrium.\r\n\r\nThis is the conception which I have sought to convey, though it seems\r\nunsuccessfully, in the _Principles of Biology_; and which I have there used\r\nto interpret the many involved and mysterious phenomena of Genesis,\r\nHeredity, and Variation. In one respect only am I conscious of having so\r\ninadequately explained myself, as to give occasion for a\r\nmisinterpretation--the one made by the _Westminster_ reviewer above\r\nreferred to. By him, as by your own critic, it is alleged that in the idea\r\nof \"inherent tendencies\" I have introduced, under a disguise, the\r\nconception of \"the archæus, vital principle, _nisus formativus_, and so\r\non.\" This allegation is in part answered by the foregoing explanation. That\r\nwhich I have here to add, and did not adequately explain in the _Principles\r\nof Biology_, is that the proclivity of units of each order towards the\r\nspecific arrangement seen in the organism they form, is not to be\r\nunderstood as resulting from their own structures and actions only; but as\r\nthe product of these and the environing forces to which they are exposed.\r\nOrganic evolution takes place only on condition that the masses of\r\nprotoplasm formed of the physiological units, and of the assimilable\r\nmaterials out of which others like themselves are to be multiplied, are\r\nsubject to heat of a given degree--are subject, that is, to the unceasing\r\nimpacts of undulations of a certain strength and period; and, within\r\nlimits, the rapidity with which the physiological units pass from their\r\nindefinite arrangement to the definite arrangement they presently assume,\r\nis proportionate to the strengths of the ethereal undulations falling upon\r\nthem. In its complete form, then, the conception is that these specific\r\nmolecules, having the immense complexity above described, and having\r\ncorrespondently complex polarities which cannot be mutually balanced by any\r\nsimple form of aggregation, have, for the form of aggregation in which all\r\ntheir forces are equilibrated, the structure of the adult organism to which\r\nthey belong; and that they are compelled to fall into this structure by the\r\nco-operation of the environing forces acting on them, and the forces they\r\nexercise on one another--the environing forces being the source of the\r\n_power_ which effects the re-arrangement, and the polarities of the\r\nmolecules determining the _direction_ in which that power is turned. Into\r\nthis conception there enters no trace of the hypothesis of an \"archæus or\r\nvital principle;\" and the principles of molecular physics fully justify it.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, objected that \"the living body in its development presents\r\na long succession of _differing_ forms; a continued series of changes for\r\nthe whole length of which, according to Mr. Spencer's hypothesis, the\r\nphysiological units must have an 'inherent tendency.' Could we more truly\r\nsay of anything, 'it is unrepresentable in thought?'\" I reply that if there\r\nis taken into account an element here overlooked, the process will not be\r\nfound \"unrepresentable in thought.\" This is the element of size or mass. To\r\nsatisfy or balance the polarities of each order of physiological units, not\r\nonly a certain structure of organism, but a certain size of organism is\r\nneeded; for the complexities of that adult structure in which the\r\nphysiological units are equilibrated, cannot be represented within the\r\nsmall bulk of the embryo. In many minute organisms, where the whole mass of\r\nphysiological units required for the structure is present, the very thing\r\n_does_ take place which it is above implied _ought_ to take place. The mass\r\nbuilds itself directly into the complete form. This is so with _Acari_, and\r\namong the nematoid _Entozoa_. But among higher animals such direct\r\ntransformations cannot happen. The mass of physiological units required to\r\nproduce the size as well as the structure that approximately equilibrates\r\nthem, is not all present, but has to be formed by successive\r\nadditions--additions which in viviparous animals are made by absorbing, and\r\ntransforming into these special molecules, the organizable materials\r\ndirectly supplied by the parent, and which in oviparous animals are made by\r\ndoing the like with the organizable materials in the \"food-yelk,\" deposited\r\nby the parent in the same envelope with the germ. Hence it results that,\r\nunder such conditions, the physiological units which first aggregate into\r\nthe rudiment of the future organism, do not form a structure like that of\r\nthe adult organism, which, when of such small dimensions, does not\r\nequilibrate them. They distribute themselves so as partly to satisfy the\r\nchief among their complex polarities. The vaguely-differentiated mass thus\r\nproduced cannot, however, be in equilibrium. Each increment of\r\nphysiological units formed and integrated by it, changes the distribution\r\nof forces; and this has a double effect. It tends to modify the\r\ndifferentiations already made, bringing them a step nearer to the\r\nequilibrating structure; and the physiological units next integrated, being\r\nbrought under the aggregate of polar forces exercised by the whole mass,\r\nwhich now approaches a step nearer to that ultimate distribution of polar\r\nforces which exists in the adult organism, are coerced more directly into\r\nthe typical structure. Thus there is necessitated a series of compromises.\r\nEach successive form assumed is unstable and transitional: approach to the\r\ntypical structure going on hand in hand with approach to the typical bulk.\r\n\r\nPossibly I have not succeeded by this explanation, any more than by the\r\noriginal explanation, in making this process \"representable in thought.\" It\r\nis manifestly untrue, however, that I have, as alleged, re-introduced under\r\na disguise the conception of a \"vital principle.\" That I interpret\r\nembryonic development in terms of Matter and Motion, cannot, I think, be\r\nquestioned. Whether the interpretation is adequate, must be a matter of\r\nopinion; but it is clearly a matter of fact, that I have not fallen into\r\nthe inconsistency asserted by your reviewer. At the same time I willingly\r\nadmit that, in the absence of certain statements which I have now supplied,\r\nhe was not unwarranted in representing my conception in the way that he has\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n  [1] Gross misrepresentations of this statement, which have been from time\r\n      to time made, oblige me, much against my will, to add here an\r\n      explanation of it. The last of these perversions, uttered in a\r\n      lecture delivered at Belfast by the Rev. Professor Watts, D.D., is\r\n      reported in the _Belfast Witness_ of December 18, 1874; just while a\r\n      third impression of this work is being printed from the plates. The\r\n      report commences as follows:--\"Dr. Watts, after showing that on his\r\n      own confession Spencer was indebted for his facts to Huxley and\r\n      Hooker, who,\" &c., &c.\r\n\r\n      Wishing in this, as in other cases, to acknowledge indebtedness when\r\n      conscious of it, I introduced the words referred to, in recognition\r\n      of the fact that I had repeatedly questioned the distinguished\r\n      specialists named, on matters beyond my knowledge, which were not\r\n      dealt with in the books at my command. Forgetting the habits of\r\n      antagonists, and especially theological antagonists, it never\r\n      occurred to me that my expression of thanks to my friends for\r\n      \"information where my own was deficient,\" would be turned into the\r\n      sweeping statement that I was indebted to them for my facts.\r\n\r\n      Had Professor Watts looked at the preface to the second volume (the\r\n      two having been published separately, as the prefaces imply), he\r\n      would have seen a second expression of my indebtedness \"for their\r\n      valuable criticisms, and for the trouble they have taken in\r\n      _checking_ the numerous statements of fact on which the arguments\r\n      proceed\"--no further indebtedness being named. A moment's comparison\r\n      of the two volumes in respect of their accumulations of facts, would\r\n      have shown him what kind of warrant there was for his interpretation.\r\n\r\n      Doubtless the Rev. Professor was prompted to make this assertion by\r\n      the desire to discredit the work he was attacking; and having so good\r\n      an end in view, thought it needless to be particular about the means.\r\n      In the art of dealing with the language of opponents, Dr. Watts might\r\n      give lessons to Monsignor Capel and Archbishop Manning.\r\n\r\n        _December 28th, 1874._\r\n\r\n  [2] In this passage as originally written (in 1862) they were described\r\n      as incondensible; since, though reduced to the density of liquids,\r\n      they had not been liquefied.\r\n\r\n  [3] Here and hereafter the word \"atom\" signifies a unit of something\r\n      classed as an element, because thus far undecomposed by us. The word\r\n      must not be supposed to mean that which its derivation implies. In\r\n      all probability it is not a simple unit but a compound one.\r\n\r\n  [4] The name hydro-carbons was here used when these pages were written,\r\n      thirty-four years ago. It was the name then current. In this case, as\r\n      in multitudinous other cases, the substitution of newer words and\r\n      phrases for older ones, is somewhat misleading. Putting the thoughts\r\n      of 1862 in the language of 1897 gives an illusive impression of\r\n      recency.\r\n\r\n  [5] It will perhaps seem strange to class oxygen as a crystalloid. But\r\n      inasmuch as the crystalloids are distinguished from the colloids by\r\n      their atomic simplicity, and inasmuch as sundry gases are reducible\r\n      to a crystalline state, we are justified in so classing it.\r\n\r\n  [6] The remark made by a critic to the effect that in a mammal higher\r\n      temperature diminishes the rate of molecular change in the tissues,\r\n      leads me to add that the exhalation I have alleged is prevented if\r\n      the heat rises above the range of variation normal to the organism;\r\n      since, then, unusually rapid pulsations with consequent inefficient\r\n      propulsion of the blood, cause a diminished rate of circulation. To\r\n      produce the effect referred to in the text, heat must be associated\r\n      with dryness; for otherwise evaporation is not aided. General\r\n      evidence supporting the statement I have made is furnished by the\r\n      fact that the hot and dry air of the eastern deserts is extremely\r\n      invigorating; by the fact that all the energetic and conquering races\r\n      of men have come from the hot and dry regions marked on the maps as\r\n      rainless; and by the fact that travellers in Africa comment on the\r\n      contrast between the inhabitants of the hot and dry regions\r\n      (relatively elevated) and those of the hot and moist regions: active\r\n      and inert respectively.\r\n\r\n  [7] The increase of respiration found to result from the presence of\r\n      light, is probably an _indirect_ effect. It is most likely due to the\r\n      reception of more vivid impressions through the eyes, and to the\r\n      consequent nervous stimulation. Bright light is associated in our\r\n      experience with many of our greatest outdoor pleasures, and its\r\n      presence partially arouses the consciousness of them, with the\r\n      concomitant raised vital functions.\r\n\r\n  [8] To exclude confusion it may be well here to say that the word \"atom\"\r\n      is, as before explained, used as the name for a unit of a substance\r\n      at present undecomposed; while the word \"molecule\" is used as the\r\n      name for a unit of a substance known to be compound.\r\n\r\n  [9] On now returning to the subject after many years, I meet with some\r\n      evidence recently assigned, in a paper read before the Royal Society\r\n      by Mr. J. W. Pickering, D.Sc. (detailing results harmonizing with\r\n      those obtained by Prof. Grimaux), showing clearly how important an\r\n      agent in vital actions is this production of isomeric changes by\r\n      slight changes of conditions. Certain artificially produced\r\n      substances, simulating proteids in other of their characters and\r\n      reactions, were found to simulate them in coagulability by trifling\r\n      disturbances. \"In the presence of a _trace of neutral salt_ they\r\n      coagulate on heating at temperatures very similar to proteid\r\n      solutions.\" And it is shown that by one of these factitious organic\r\n      colloids a like effect is produced in coagulating the blood, to that\r\n      \"produced by the intravenous injection of a nucleoproteid.\"\r\n\r\n [10] After this long interval during which other subjects have occupied\r\n      me, I now find that the current view is similar to the view above set\r\n      forth, in so far that a small molecular disturbance is supposed\r\n      suddenly to initiate a great one, producing a change compared to an\r\n      explosion. But while, of two proposed interpretations, one is that\r\n      the fuse is nitrogenous and the charge a carbo-hydrate, the other is\r\n      that both are nitrogenous. The relative probabilities of these\r\n      alternative views will be considered in a subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\n [11] When writing this passage I omitted to observe the verification\r\n      yielded of the conclusion contained in § 15 concerning the part\r\n      played in the vital processes by the nitrogenous compounds. For these\r\n      vegeto-alkalies, minute quantities of which produce such great\r\n      effects in exalting the functions (_e. g._, a sixteenth of a grain of\r\n      strychnia is a dose), are all nitrogenous bodies, and, by\r\n      implication, relatively unstable bodies. The small amounts of\r\n      molecular change which take place in these small quantities of the\r\n      vegeto-alkalies when diffused through the system, initiate larger\r\n      amounts of molecular change in the nitrogenous elements of the\r\n      tissues.\r\n\r\n      But the evidence furnished a generation ago by these vegeto-alkalies\r\n      has been greatly reinforced by far more striking evidence furnished\r\n      by other nitrogenous compounds--the various explosives. These, at the\r\n      same time that they produce by their sudden decompositions violent\r\n      effects outside the organism, also produce violent effects inside it:\r\n      a hundredth of a grain of nitro-glycerine being a sufficient dose.\r\n      Investigations made by Dr. J. B. Bradbury, and described by him in\r\n      the Bradshaw Lecture on \"Some New Vaso-Dilators\" (see _The Lancet_,\r\n      Nov. 16, 1895), details the effects of kindred\r\n      bodies--methyl-nitrate, glycol-dinitrate, erythrol-tetranitrate. The\r\n      first two, in common with nitro-glycerine, are stable only when cool\r\n      and in the dark--sunlight or warmth decomposes them, and they explode\r\n      by rapid heating or percussion. The fact which concerns us here is\r\n      that the least stable--glycol-dinitrate--has the most powerful and\r\n      rapid physiological effect, which is proportionately transient. In\r\n      one minute the blood-pressure is reduced by one-fourth and in four\r\n      minutes by nearly two-thirds: an effect which is dissipated in a\r\n      quarter of an hour. So that this excessively unstable compound,\r\n      decomposing in the body in a very short time, produces within that\r\n      short time a vast amount of molecular change: acting, as it seems,\r\n      not through the nervous system, but directly on the blood-vessels.\r\n\r\n [12] This interpretation is said to be disproved by the fact that the\r\n      carbo-hydrate contained in muscle amounts to only about 1.5 of the\r\n      total solids. I do not see how this statement is to be reconciled\r\n      with the statement cited three pages back from Professor Michael\r\n      Foster, that the deposits of glycogen contained in the liver and in\r\n      the muscles may be compared to the deposits in a central bank and\r\n      branch banks.\r\n\r\n [13] Before leaving the topic let me remark that the doctrine of\r\n      metabolism is at present in its inchoate stage, and that the\r\n      prevailing conclusions should be held tentatively. As showing this\r\n      need an anomalous fact may be named. It was long held that gelatine\r\n      is of small value as food, and though it is now recognized as\r\n      valuable because serving the same purposes as fats and\r\n      carbo-hydrates, it is still held to be valueless for structural\r\n      purposes (save for some inactive tissue); and this estimate agrees\r\n      with the fact that it is a relatively stable nitrogenous compound,\r\n      and therefore unfit for those functions performed by unstable\r\n      nitrogenous compounds in the muscular and other tissues. But if this\r\n      is true, it seems a necessary implication that such substances as\r\n      hair, wool, feathers, and all dermal growths chemically akin to\r\n      gelatine, and even more stable, ought to be equally innutritive or\r\n      more innutritive. In that case, however, what are we to say of the\r\n      larva of the clothes-moth, which subsists exclusively on one or other\r\n      of these substances, and out of it forms all those unstable\r\n      nitrogenous compounds needful for carrying on its life and developing\r\n      its tissues? Or again, how are we to understand the nutrition of the\r\n      book-worm, which, in the time-stained leaves through which it\r\n      burrows, finds no proteid save that contained in the dried-up size,\r\n      which is a form of gelatine; or, once more, in what form is the\r\n      requisite amount of nitrogenous substance obtained by the\r\n      coleopterous larva which eats holes in wood a century old?\r\n\r\n [14] This chapter and the following two chapters originally appeared in\r\n      Part III of the original edition of the _Principles of Psychology_\r\n      (1855): forming a preliminary which, though indispensable to the\r\n      argument there developed, was somewhat parenthetical. Having now to\r\n      deal with the general science of Biology before the more special one\r\n      of Psychology, it becomes possible to transfer these chapters to\r\n      their proper place.\r\n\r\n [15] See _Westminster Review_ for April, 1852.--Art. IV. \"A Theory of\r\n      Population.\" See Appendix A.\r\n\r\n [16] This paragraph replaces a sentence that, in _The Principles of\r\n      Psychology_, referred to a preceding chapter on \"Method;\" in which\r\n      the mode of procedure here indicated was set forth as a mode to be\r\n      systematically pursued in the choice of hypotheses. This chapter on\r\n      Method is now included, along with other matter, in a volume entitled\r\n      _Various Fragments_.\r\n\r\n [17] Speaking of \"the general idea of _life_\" M. Comte says:--\"Cette idée\r\n      suppose, en effet, non-seulement celle d'un être organisé de manière\r\n      à comporter l'état vital, mais aussi celle, non moins indispensable,\r\n      d'un certain ensemble d'influences extérieures propres à son\r\n      accomplissement. Une telle harmonie entre l'être vivant et le\r\n      _milieu_ correspondant, caractérise evidemment la condition\r\n      fondamentale de la vie.\" Commenting on de Blainville's definition of\r\n      life, which he adopts, he says:--\"Cette lumineuse définition ne me\r\n      paraît laisser rien d'important à désirer, si ce n'est une indication\r\n      plus directe et plus explicite de ces deux conditions fondamentales\r\n      co-relatives, nécessairement inséparables de l'état vivant, un\r\n      _organisme_ déterminé et un _milieu_ convenable.\" It is strange that\r\n      M. Comte should have thus recognized the necessity of a harmony\r\n      between an organism and its environment, as a _condition_ essential\r\n      to life, and should not have seen that the continuous maintenance of\r\n      such inner actions as will counterbalance outer actions,\r\n      _constitutes_ life.\r\n\r\n      [When the original edition was published Dr. J. H. Bridges wrote to\r\n      me saying that in the _Politique Positive_, Comte had developed his\r\n      conception further. On p. 413, denying \"le prétendu antagonisme des\r\n      corps vivants envers leurs milieux inorganiques,\" he says \"au lieu de\r\n      ce conflit, on a reconnu bientôt que cette relation nécessaire\r\n      constitue une condition fondamentale de la vie réelle, dont la notion\r\n      systématique consiste dans une intime conciliation permanente entre\r\n      la spontanéité intérieure et la fatalité extérieure.\" Still, this\r\n      \"conciliation _permanente_\" seems to be a \"_condition_\" to life; not\r\n      that varying adjustment of changes which life consists in\r\n      maintaining. In presence of an ambiguity, the interpretation which\r\n      agrees with his previous statement must be chosen.]\r\n\r\n [18] In further elucidation of this general doctrine, see _First\r\n      Principles_, § 25.\r\n\r\n [19] In ordinary speech Development is often used as synonymous with\r\n      Growth. It hence seems needful to say that Development as here and\r\n      hereafter used, means _increase of structure_ and not _increase of\r\n      bulk_. It may be added that the word Evolution, comprehending growth\r\n      as well as Development, is to be reserved for occasions when both are\r\n      implied.\r\n\r\n [20] This paragraph originally formed part of a review-article on\r\n      \"Transcendental Physiology,\" published in 1857.\r\n\r\n [21] When, in 1863, the preceding chapter was written, it had not occurred\r\n      to me that there needed an accompanying chapter treating of\r\n      Structure. The gap left by that oversight I now fill up. In doing\r\n      this there have been included certain statements which are tacitly\r\n      presupposed in the last chapter, and there may also be some which\r\n      overlap statements in the next chapter. I have not thought it needful\r\n      so to alter adjacent chapters as to remove these slight defects: the\r\n      duplicated ideas will bear re-emphasizing.\r\n\r\n [22] In connexion with this matter I add here a statement made by Prof.\r\n      Foster which it is difficult to understand: \"Indeed it has been\r\n      observed that a dormouse actually gained in weight during a\r\n      hybernating period; it discharged during this period neither urine\r\n      nor fæces, and the gain in weight was the excess of oxygen taken in\r\n      over the carbonic acid given out.\" (_Text-book of Physiology_, 6th\r\n      ed., Part II, page 859.)\r\n\r\n [23] In the account of James Mitchell, a boy born blind and deaf, given by\r\n      James Wardrop, F.R.S. (Edin. 1813), it is said that he acquired a\r\n      \"preternatural acuteness of touch and smell.\" The deaf Dr. Kitto\r\n      described himself as having an extremely strong visual memory: he\r\n      retained \"a clear impression or image of everything at which he ever\r\n      looked.\"\r\n\r\n [24] Here, as in sundry places throughout this chapter, the necessities of\r\n      the argument have obliged me to forestall myself, by assuming the\r\n      conclusion reached in a subsequent chapter, that modifications of\r\n      structure produced by modifications of function are transmitted to\r\n      offspring.\r\n\r\n [25] Whether the _Volvox_ is to be classed as animal or vegetal is a\r\n      matter of dispute; but its similarity to the blastula stage of many\r\n      animals warrants the claim of the zoologists.\r\n\r\n [26] While the proof was in my hands there was published in _Science\r\n      Progress_ an essay by Dr. T. G. Brodie on \"The Phosphorus-containing\r\n      Substances of the Cell.\" In this essay it is pointed out that\r\n      \"nucleic acid is particularly characterized by its instability.... In\r\n      the process of purification it is extremely liable to decompose, with\r\n      the result that it loses a considerable part of its phosphorus. In\r\n      the second place it is most easily split up in another manner in\r\n      which it loses a considerable part of its nitrogen.... To avoid the\r\n      latter source of error he [Miescher] found that it was necessary to\r\n      keep the temperature of all solutions down to 0°C., the whole time of\r\n      the preparation.\" These facts tend strongly to verify the hypothesis\r\n      that the nucleus is a source of perpetual molecular disturbance--not\r\n      a regulating centre but a stimulating centre.\r\n\r\n [27] The writing of the above section reminded me of certain allied views\r\n      which I ventured to suggest nearly 50 years ago. They are contained\r\n      in the _Westminster Review_ for April, 1852, in an article entitled\r\n      \"A Theory of Population deduced from the General Law of Animal\r\n      Fertility.\" It is there suggested that the \"spermatozoon is\r\n      essentially a neural element, and the ovum essentially a hæmal\r\n      element,\" or, as otherwise stated, that the \"sperm-cell is\r\n      co-ordinating matter and the germ-cell matter to be co-ordinated\"\r\n      (pp. 490-493). And along with this proposition there is given some\r\n      chemical evidence tending to support it. Now if, in place of \"neural\"\r\n      and \"hæmal,\" we say--the element that is most highly phosphorized and\r\n      the element that is phosphorized in a much smaller degree; or if, in\r\n      place of co-ordinating matter and matter to be co-ordinated, we\r\n      say--the matter which initiates action and the matter which is made\r\n      to act; there is disclosed a kinship between this early view and the\r\n      view just set forth. In the last part of this work, \"Laws of\r\n      Multiplication,\" which is developed from the essay referred to, I\r\n      left out the portion containing the quoted sentences, and the\r\n      evidence supporting the conclusion drawn. Partly I omitted them\r\n      because the speculation did not form an essential link in the general\r\n      argument, and partly because I did not see how the suggested\r\n      interpretation could hold of plants as well as of animals. If,\r\n      however, the alleged greater staining capacity of the male generative\r\n      nucleus in plants implies, as in other cases, that the male cell has\r\n      a larger proportion of the phosphorized matter than the other\r\n      elements concerned, then the difficulty disappears.\r\n\r\n      As, along with the idea just named, the dropped portion of the\r\n      original essay contains other ideas which seem to me worth\r\n      preserving, I have thought it as well to reproduce it, in company\r\n      with the chief part of the general argument as at first sketched out.\r\n      It will be found in Appendix A to this volume.\r\n\r\n [28] Unfortunately the word _heterogenesis_ has been already used as a\r\n      synonym for \"spontaneous generation.\" Save by those few who believe\r\n      in \"spontaneous generation,\" however, little objection will be felt\r\n      to using the word in a sense that seems much more appropriate. The\r\n      meaning above given to it covers both Metagenesis and\r\n      Parthenogenesis.\r\n\r\n [29] Prof. Huxley avoids this difficulty by making every kind of Genesis a\r\n      mode of development. His classification, which suggested the one\r\n      given above, is as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                   { Growth\r\n                     { Continuous  {\r\n                     {             { Metamorphosis\r\n                     {\r\n        Development  {\r\n                     {                              { Metagenesis\r\n                     {               { Agamogenesis {\r\n                     { Discontinuous {              { Parthenogenesis\r\n                                     { Gamogenesis\r\n\r\n [30] The implication is that an essentially similar process occurs in\r\n      those fragments of leaves used for artificial propagation. Besides\r\n      the Begonias in general, I learn that various other plants are thus\r\n      multiplied--Citron and orange trees, _Hoya carnosa_, _Aucuba\r\n      japonica_, _Clianthus puniceus_, etc., etc. _Bryophyllum calicinum_,\r\n      _Rochea falcata_, and _Echeveria_. I also learn that the following\r\n      plants, among others, produce buds from their foliage\r\n      leaves:--_Cardamine pratensis_, _Nasturtium officinale_, _Roripa\r\n      palustris_, _Brassica oleracea_, _Arabis pumila_, _Chelidonium\r\n      majus_, _Nymphæa guianensis_, _Episcia bicolor_, _Chirita sivensis_,\r\n      _Pinguicula Backeri_, _Allium_, _Gagea_, _Tolmia_, _Fritillaria_,\r\n      _Ornithogalum_, etc. In _Cardamine_ and several others, a complete\r\n      miniature plant is at once produced; in other cases bulbils or\r\n      similar detachable buds.\r\n\r\n [31] Among various examples I have observed, the most remarkable were\r\n      among Foxgloves, growing in great numbers and of large size, in a\r\n      wood between Whatstandwell Bridge and Crich, in Derbyshire. In one\r\n      case the lowest flower on the stem contained, in place of a pistil, a\r\n      shoot or spike of flower-buds, similar in structure to the\r\n      embryo-buds of the main spike. I counted seventeen buds on it; of\r\n      which the first had three stamens, but was otherwise normal; the\r\n      second had three; the third, four; the fourth, four; &c. Another\r\n      plant, having more varied monstrosities, evinced excess of nutrition\r\n      with equal clearness. The following are the notes I took of its\r\n      structure:--1st, or lowest flower on the stem, very large; calyx\r\n      containing eight divisions, one partly transformed into a corolla,\r\n      and another transformed into a small bud with bract (this bud\r\n      consisted of a five-cleft calyx, four sessile anthers, a pistil, and\r\n      a rudimentary corolla); the corolla of the main flower, which was\r\n      complete, contained six stamens, three of them bearing anthers, two\r\n      others being flattened and coloured, and one rudimentary; there was\r\n      no pistil but, _in place of it_, a large bud, consisting of a\r\n      three-cleft calyx of which two divisions were tinted at the ends, an\r\n      imperfect corolla marked internally with the usual purple spots and\r\n      hairs, three anthers sessile on this mal-formed corolla, a pistil, a\r\n      seed vessel with ovules, and, growing to it, another bud of which the\r\n      structure was indistinct. 2nd flower, large; calyx of seven\r\n      divisions, one being transformed into a bud with bract, but much\r\n      smaller than the other; corolla large but cleft along the top; six\r\n      stamens with anthers, pistil, and seed-vessel. 3rd flower, large;\r\n      six-cleft calyx, cleft corolla, with six stamens, pistil, and\r\n      seed-vessel, with a second pistil half unfolded at its apex. 4th\r\n      flower, large; divided along the top, six stamens. 5th flower, large;\r\n      corolla divided into three parts, six stamens. 6th flower, large;\r\n      corolla cleft, calyx six cleft, the rest of the flower normal. 7th,\r\n      and all succeeding flowers, normal.\r\n\r\n      While this chapter is under revision, another noteworthy illustration\r\n      has been furnished to me by a wall-trained pear tree which was\r\n      covered in the spring by luxuriant \"foreright\" shoots. As I learned\r\n      from the gardener, it was pruned just as the fruit was setting. A\r\n      large excess of sap was thus thrown into other branches, with the\r\n      result that in a number of them the young pears were made monstrous\r\n      by reversion. In some cases, instead of the dried up sepals at the\r\n      top of the pear, there were produced good sized leaves; and in other\r\n      cases the seed-bearing core of the pear was transformed into a growth\r\n      which protruded through the top of the pear in the shape of a new\r\n      shoot.\r\n\r\n [32] In partial verification, Mr. Tansley writes:--\"Prof. Klebs of Basel\r\n      has shown that in _Hydrodictyon_, gametes can only be produced by the\r\n      cells of a net when these are above a certain size and age; and then\r\n      only under conditions unfavourable to growth, such as a feeble light\r\n      or poverty of nutritive inorganic salts or absence of oxygen, or a\r\n      low temperature in the water containing the plant. The presence of\r\n      organic substances, especially sugar, also acts as a stimulus to the\r\n      formation of gametes, and this is also the case in _Vaucheria_. Many\r\n      other _Algæ_ produce gametes mainly at the end of the vegetative\r\n      season, when food is certainly difficult to obtain in their natural\r\n      habitat, and we may well suppose that their assimilative power is\r\n      waning. Where, however, as is the case in _Vaucheria_, the plant\r\n      depends for propagation mainly on the production of fertilized eggs,\r\n      we find the sexual organs often produced in conditions very\r\n      favourable to vegetative growth, in opposition to those cases such as\r\n      _Hydrodictyon_, where the chief means of propagation is by zoospores.\r\n      So that side by side with, and to some extent obscuring, the\r\n      principle developed above we have a clear adaptation of the\r\n      production of reproductive cells to the special circumstances of the\r\n      case.\"\r\n\r\n [33] This establishment by survival of the fittest of reproductive\r\n      processes adapted to variable conditions, is indirectly elucidated by\r\n      the habits of salmon. As salmon thrive in the sea and fall out of\r\n      condition in fresh water (having during their sea-life not exercised\r\n      the art of catching fresh-water prey), the implication is that the\r\n      species would profit if all individuals ran up the rivers just before\r\n      spawning time in November. Why then do most of them run up during\r\n      many preceding months? Contemplation of the difficulties which lie in\r\n      the way to the spawning grounds, will, I think, suggest an\r\n      explanation. There are falls to be leaped and shallow rapids to be\r\n      ascended. These obstacles cannot be surmounted when the river is low.\r\n      A fish which starts early in the season has more chances of getting\r\n      up the falls and the rapids than one which starts later; and, out of\r\n      condition as it will be, may spawn, though not well. On the other\r\n      hand, one which starts in October, if floods occur appropriately, may\r\n      reach the upper waters and then spawn to great advantage; but in the\r\n      absence of adequate rains it may fail altogether to reach the\r\n      spawning grounds. Hence the species profits by an irregularity of\r\n      habits adapted to meet irregular contingencies.\r\n\r\n [34] I owe to Mr. (now Sir John) Lubbock an important confirmation of this\r\n      view. After stating his belief that between Crustaceans and Insects\r\n      there exists a physiological relation analogous to that which exists\r\n      between water vertebrata and land-vertebrata, he pointed out to me\r\n      that while among Insects there is a definite limit of growth, and an\r\n      accompanying definite commencement of reproduction, among\r\n      Crustaceans, where growth has no definite limit, there is no definite\r\n      relation between the commencement of reproduction and the decrease or\r\n      arrest of growth.\r\n\r\n [35] While this chapter is passing through the press, I learn from Mr.\r\n      White Cooper, that not only are near sight, long sight, dull sight,\r\n      and squinting, hereditary; but that a peculiarity of vision confined\r\n      to one eye is frequently transmitted: re-appearing in the same eye in\r\n      offspring.\r\n\r\n [36] An instance here occurs of the way in which those who are averse to a\r\n      conclusion will assign the most flimsy reasons for rejecting it.\r\n      Rather than admit that the eyes of these creatures living in darkness\r\n      have disappeared from lack of use, some contend that such creatures\r\n      would be liable to have their eyes injured by collisions with\r\n      objects, and that therefore natural selection would favour those\r\n      individuals in which the eyes had somewhat diminished and were least\r\n      liable to injury: the implication being that the immunity from the\r\n      inflammations due to injuries would be so important a factor in life\r\n      as to cause survival. And this is argued in presence of the fact that\r\n      one of the most conspicuous among these blind cave-animals is a\r\n      cray-fish, and that the cray-fish in its natural habitat is in the\r\n      habit of burrowing in the banks of rivers holes a foot or more deep,\r\n      and has its eyes exposed to all those possible blows and frictions\r\n      which the burrowing involves!\r\n\r\n [37] In addition to the numerous illustrations given by Mr. Sedgwick, here\r\n      is one which Colonel A. T. Fraser published in _Nature_ for Nov. 9,\r\n      1893, concerning two Hindoo dwarfs:--\"In speech and intelligence the\r\n      dwarfs were indistinguishable from ordinary natives of India. From an\r\n      interrogation of one of them, it appeared that he belonged to a\r\n      family all the male members of which have been dwarfs for several\r\n      generations. They marry ordinary native girls, and the female\r\n      children grow up like those of other people. The males, however,\r\n      though they develop at the normal rate until they reach the age of\r\n      six, then cease to grow, and become dwarfs.\"\r\n\r\n [38] This remarkable case appears to militate against the conclusion,\r\n      drawn a few pages back, that the increase of a peculiarity by\r\n      coincidence of \"spontaneous variations\" in successive generations, is\r\n      very improbable; and that the special superiorities of musical\r\n      composers cannot have thus arisen. The reply is that the extreme\r\n      frequency of the occurrence among so narrow a class as that of\r\n      musical composers, forbids the interpretation thus suggested.\r\n\r\n [39] I omitted to name here a cause which may be still more potent in\r\n      producing irregularity in the results of cousin-marriages. So far as\r\n      I can learn, no attempt has been made to distinguish between such\r\n      results as arise when the related parents from whom the cousins\r\n      descend are of the same sex and those which arise when they are of\r\n      different sexes. In the one case two sisters have children who\r\n      intermarry; and in the other case a brother and a sister have\r\n      children who intermarry. The marriages of cousins in these two cases\r\n      may be quite dissimilar in their results. If there is a tendency to\r\n      limitation of heredity by sex--if daughters usually inherit more from\r\n      the mother than sons do, while sons inherit more from the father than\r\n      from the mother, then two sisters will on the average of cases be\r\n      more alike in constitution than a sister and a brother. Consequently\r\n      the descendants of two sisters will differ less in their\r\n      constitutions than the descendants of a brother and a sister; and\r\n      marriage in the first case will be more likely to prove injurious\r\n      from absence of dissimilarity in the physiological units than\r\n      marriage in the second. My own small circle of friends furnishes\r\n      evidence tending to verify this conclusion. In one instance two\r\n      cousins who intermarried are children of two sisters, and they have\r\n      no offspring. In another the cousins who intermarried are children of\r\n      two brothers, and they have no offspring. In the third case the\r\n      cousins were descendants of two brothers and only one child resulted.\r\n\r\n [40] _A propos_ of this sentence one of my critics writes:--\"I cannot find\r\n      in this book the statement as first made that the 'life of an\r\n      individual is maintained by the unequal and ever-varying actions of\r\n      incident forces on its different parts.' Recent physiological work\r\n      offers a startling example of the statement.\"\r\n\r\n      To the question contained in the first sentence the answer is that I\r\n      have not made the statement in the above words, but that it is\r\n      implied in the chapter entitled \"The Degree of Life varies as the\r\n      Degree of Correspondence,\" and more especially in § 36, which,\r\n      towards its close, definitely involves the statement. The verifying\r\n      evidence my critic gives me is this:--\r\n\r\n      \"Prof. Sherrington has shown that if the sensory roots of the spinal\r\n      nerves are cut one by one there is at first no general effect\r\n      produced. That is to say, the remainder of the nervous system\r\n      continues to function as before. This condition (lack of general\r\n      effect) persists until about six pairs have been cut. With the\r\n      severance of the seventh pair, however, the whole central nervous\r\n      system ceases to function, so that stimulation of intact sensory\r\n      nerves produces no reflex action. After a variable period, but one of\r\n      many hours duration, the power of functioning is recovered. That is\r\n      to say, if the sensory impulses (from the skin, &c.) reaching the\r\n      central nervous system are rapidly reduced in amount, there comes a\r\n      point where those remaining do not suffice to keep the structure\r\n      'awake.' After a time, however, it adjusts itself to work with the\r\n      diminished supply. Similarly Strumpell describes the case of a boy\r\n      'whose sensory inlets were all paralyzed except one eye and one ear.'\r\n      When these were closed he instantly fell asleep.\"\r\n\r\n [41] Fifty years before the discovery of the Röntgen rays and those\r\n      habitually emanating from uranium, it had been observed by Moser that\r\n      under certain conditions the surfaces of metals receive permanent\r\n      impressions from appropriate objects placed upon them. Such facts\r\n      show that the molecules of substances propagate in all directions\r\n      special ethereal undulations determined by their special\r\n      constitutions.\r\n\r\n [42] This classification, and the three which follow it, I quote\r\n      (abridging some of them) from Prof. Agassiz's \"Essay on\r\n      Classification.\"\r\n\r\n [43] For explanations, see \"Illogical Geology,\" _Essays_, Vol. I. How much\r\n      we may be misled by assuming that because the remains of creatures of\r\n      high types have not been found in early strata, such creatures did\r\n      not exist when those strata were formed, has recently (1897) been\r\n      shown by the discovery of a fossil Sea-cow in the lower Miocene of\r\n      Hesse-Darmstadt. The skeleton of this creature proves that it\r\n      differed from such Sirenian mammals as the existing Manatee only in\r\n      very small particulars: further dwindling of disused parts being an\r\n      evident cause. The same is true as regards, now, we consider that\r\n      since the beginning of Miocene days this aberrant type of mammal has\r\n      not much increased its divergence from the ordinary mammalian type;\r\n      if we then consider how long it must have taken for this large\r\n      aquatic mammal (some eight or ten feet long) to be derived by\r\n      modification from a land-mammal; and if then we contemplate the\r\n      probable length of the period required for the evolution of that\r\n      land-mammal out of a pre-mammalian type; we seem carried back in\r\n      thought to a time preceding any of our geologic records. We are shown\r\n      that the process of organic evolution has most likely been far slower\r\n      than is commonly supposed.\r\n\r\n [44] Since this passage was written, in 1863, there has come to light much\r\n      more striking evidence of change from a more generalized to a less\r\n      generalized type during geologic time. In a lecture delivered by him\r\n      in 1876, Prof. Huxley gave an account of the successive modifications\r\n      of skeletal structure in animals allied to the horse. Beginning with\r\n      the _Orohippus_ of the Eocene formation, which had four complete toes\r\n      on the front limb and three toes on the hind limb, he pointed out the\r\n      successive steps by which in the _Mesohippus_, _Miohippus_,\r\n      _Protohippus_, and _Pliohippus_, there was a gradual approach to the\r\n      existing horse.\r\n\r\n [45] Several of the arguments used in this chapter and in that which\r\n      follows it, formed parts of an essay on \"The Development Hypothesis,\"\r\n      originally published in 1852.\r\n\r\n [46] _Studies from the Morphological Laboratory in the University of\r\n      Cambridge_, vol. vi, p. 84.\r\n\r\n [47] _Ibid._, p. 81.\r\n\r\n [48] _Studies from the Morphological Laboratory in the University of\r\n      Cambridge_, vol. vi, p. 89.\r\n\r\n [49] Early in our friendship (about 1855) Prof. Huxley expressed to me his\r\n      conviction that all the higher articulate animals have twenty\r\n      segments or somites. That he adhered to this view in 1880, when his\r\n      work on _The Crayfish_ was published, is shown by his analysis there\r\n      given of the twenty segments existing in this fluviatile crustacean;\r\n      and adhesion to it had been previously shown in 1877, when his work\r\n      on _The Anatomy of Invertebrated Animals_ was published. On p. 398 of\r\n      that work he writes:--\"In the abdomen there are, at most, eleven\r\n      somites, none of which, in the adult, bear ambulatory limbs. Thus,\r\n      assuming the existence of six somites in the head, the normal number\r\n      of somites in the body of insects will be twenty, as in the higher\r\n      _Crustacea_ and _Arachnida_.\" To this passage, however, he puts the\r\n      note:--\"It is open to question whether the podical plates represent a\r\n      somite; and therefore it must be recollected that the total number of\r\n      somites, the existence of which can be actually demonstrated in\r\n      insects, is only seventeen, viz., four for the head, three for the\r\n      thorax, and ten for the abdomen.\" I have changed the number twenty,\r\n      which in the original edition occurred in the text, to the number\r\n      seventeen in deference to suggestions made to me; though I find in\r\n      Dr. Sharp's careful and elaborate work on the _Insecta_, that\r\n      Viallanes and Cholodkovsky agree with Huxley in believing that there\r\n      are six somites in the insect-head. The existence of a doubt on this\r\n      point, however, does not essentially affect the argument, since there\r\n      is agreement among morphologists respecting the _constancy_ of the\r\n      total number of somites in insects.\r\n\r\n [50] To avoid circumlocution I let these words stand, though they are not\r\n      truly descriptive; for the prosperity of imported species is largely,\r\n      if not mainly, caused by the absence of those natural enemies which\r\n      kept them down at home.\r\n\r\n [51] While these pages are passing through the press (in 1864), Dr. Hooker\r\n      has obliged me by pointing out that \"plants afford many excellent\r\n      examples\" of analogous transitions. He says that among true \"water\r\n      plants,\" there are found, in the same species, varieties which have\r\n      some leaves submerged and some floating; other varieties in which\r\n      they are all floating; and other varieties in which they are all\r\n      submerged. Further, that many plants characterized by floating\r\n      leaves, and which have all their leaves floating when they grow in\r\n      deeper water, are found with partly aerial leaves when they grow in\r\n      shallower water; and that elsewhere they occur in almost dry soil\r\n      with all their leaves aerial.\r\n\r\n [52] It will be seen that the argument naturally leads up to this\r\n      expression--Survival of the Fittest--which was here used for the\r\n      first time. Two years later (July, 1866) Mr. A. R. Wallace wrote to\r\n      Mr. Darwin contending that it should be substituted for the\r\n      expression \"Natural Selection.\" Mr. Darwin demurred to this proposal.\r\n      Among reasons for retaining his own expression he said that I had\r\n      myself, in many cases, preferred it--\"continually using the words\r\n      Natural Selection.\" (_Life and Letters_, &c., vol. III, pp. 45-6.)\r\n      Mr. Darwin was quite right in his statement, but not right in the\r\n      motive he ascribed to me. My reason for frequently using the phrase\r\n      \"Natural Selection,\" after the date at which the phrase \"Survival of\r\n      the Fittest\" was first used above, was that disuse of Mr. Darwin's\r\n      phrase would have seemed like an endeavour to keep out of sight my\r\n      own indebtedness to him, and the indebtedness of the world at large.\r\n      The implied feeling has led me ever since to use the expressions\r\n      Natural Selection and Survival of the Fittest with something like\r\n      equal frequency.\r\n\r\n [53] I am indebted to Mr. [now Sir W.] Flower for the opportunity of\r\n      examining the many skulls in the Museum of the College of Surgeons\r\n      for verification of this. Unfortunately the absence, in most cases,\r\n      of some or many teeth, prevented me from arriving at that specific\r\n      result which would have been given by weighing a number of the under\r\n      jaws in each race. Simple inspection, however, disclosed a\r\n      sufficiently-conspicuous difference. The under jaws of Australians\r\n      and Negroes, when collated with those of Englishmen, were visibly\r\n      larger, not only relatively but absolutely. One Australian jaw only\r\n      seemed about of the same size as an average English jaw; and this\r\n      (probably the jaw of a woman), belonging as it did to a smaller\r\n      skull, bore a greater ratio to the whole body of which it formed\r\n      part, than did an English jaw of the same actual size. In all the\r\n      other cases, the under jaws of these inferior races (containing\r\n      larger teeth than our own) were _absolutely_ more massive than our\r\n      own--often exceeding them in all dimensions; and _relatively_ to\r\n      their smaller skeletons were much more massive. Let me add that the\r\n      Australian and Negro jaws are thus strongly contrasted, not with all\r\n      British jaws, but only with the jaws of the civilized British. An\r\n      ancient British skull in the collection possesses a jaw almost or\r\n      quite as massive as those of the Australian skulls. All this is in\r\n      harmony with the alleged relation between greater size of jaws and\r\n      greater action of jaws, involved by the habits of savages.\r\n\r\n      [In 1891 Mr. F. Howard Collins carefully investigated this matter:\r\n      measuring ten Australian, ten Ancient British, and ten recent English\r\n      skulls in the College of Surgeons Museum. The result proved an\r\n      absolute difference of the kind above indicated, and a far greater\r\n      relative difference. To ascertain this last a common standard of\r\n      comparison was established--an equal size of skull in all the cases;\r\n      and then when the relative masses or cubic sizes of the jaws were\r\n      calculated, the result which came out was this:--Australian jaw,\r\n      1948; Ancient British jaw, 1135; Recent English jaw, 1030. \"Hence,\"\r\n      in the words of Mr. Collins, \"the mass of the Recent English jaw is,\r\n      roughly speaking, half that of the Australian relatively to that of\r\n      the skull, and a ninth less than that of the Ancient British.\" He\r\n      adds verifying evidence from witnesses who have no hypothesis to\r\n      support--members of the Odontological Society. The Vice-President,\r\n      Mr. Mummery, remarks of the Australians that \"the jaw-bones are\r\n      powerfully developed, and large in proportion to the cranium.\"]\r\n\r\n [54] As bearing on the question of the varieties of Man, let me here refer\r\n      to a paper on \"The Origin of the Human Races\" read before the\r\n      Anthropological Society, March 1st, 1864, by Mr. Alfred Wallace. In\r\n      this paper, Mr. Wallace shows that along with the attainment of that\r\n      intelligence implied by the use of implements, clothing, &c., there\r\n      arises a tendency for modifications of brain to take the place of\r\n      modifications of body: still, however, regarding the natural\r\n      selection of spontaneous variations as the cause of the\r\n      modifications. But if the foregoing arguments be valid, natural\r\n      selection here plays but the secondary part of furthering the\r\n      adaptations otherwise caused. It is true that, as Mr. Wallace argues,\r\n      and as I have myself briefly indicated (see _Westminster Review_, for\r\n      April, 1852, pp. 496-501), the natural selection of races leads to\r\n      the survival of the more cerebrally-developed, while the less\r\n      cerebrally-developed disappear. But though natural selection acts\r\n      freely in the struggle of one society with another; yet, among the\r\n      units of each society, its action is so interfered with that there\r\n      remains no adequate cause for the acquirement of mental superiority\r\n      by one race over another, except the inheritance of\r\n      functionally-produced modifications.\r\n\r\n [55] _Darwin and after Darwin_, Part II, p. 99.\r\n\r\n [56] _Essays upon Heredity_, vol. i, p. 90.\r\n\r\n [57] In a letter published by Dr. Romanes in _Nature_, for April 26, 1894,\r\n      he alleges three reasons why \"as soon as selection is withdrawn from\r\n      an organ the _minus_ variations of that organ outnumber the _plus_\r\n      variations.\" The first is that \"the survival-mean must descend to the\r\n      birth-mean.\" The interpretation of this is that if the members of a\r\n      species are on the average born with an organ of the required size,\r\n      and if they are exposed to natural selection, then those in which the\r\n      organ is relatively small will some of them die, and consequently the\r\n      mean size of the organ at adult age will be greater than at birth.\r\n      Contrariwise, if the organ becomes useless and natural selection does\r\n      not operate on it, this difference between the birth-mean and the\r\n      survival-mean disappears.  Now here, again, the _plus_ variations and\r\n      their effects are ignored. Supposing the organ to be useful, it is\r\n      tacitly assumed that while _minus_ variations are injurious, _plus_\r\n      variations are not injurious. This is untrue. Superfluous size of an\r\n      organ implies several evils:--Its original cost is greater than\r\n      requisite, and other organs suffer; the continuous cost of its\r\n      nutrition is unduly great, involving further injury; it adds\r\n      needlessly to the weight carried and so again is detrimental; and\r\n      there is in some cases yet a further mischief--it is in the way.\r\n      Clearly, then, those in which _plus_ variations of the organ have\r\n      occurred are likely to be killed off as well as those in which\r\n      _minus_ variations have occurred; and hence there is no proof that\r\n      the survival-mean will exceed the birth-mean. Moreover the assumption\r\n      has a fatal implication. To say that the survival-mean of an organ is\r\n      greater than the birth-mean is to say that the organ is greater _in\r\n      proportion to other organs_ than it was at birth. What happens if\r\n      instead of one organ we consider all the organs? If the survival-mean\r\n      of a particular organ is greater than its birth-mean, the survival\r\n      mean of each other organ must also be greater. Thus the proposition\r\n      is that every organ has become larger in relation to every other\r\n      organ!--a marvellous proposition. I need only add that Dr. Romanes'\r\n      inferences with respect to the two other causes--atavism and failing\r\n      heredity--are similarly vitiated by ignoring the plus variations and\r\n      their effects.\r\n\r\n [58] _Westminster Review_, January, 1860.

In some of the Rotifera the male has no nutritive system at all.\r\n      See _Prin. of Phys._, p. 954.\r\n\r\n [94] _Prin. of Phys._, p. 908.\r\n\r\n [95] \"Parthenogenesis,\" pp. 66, 67.\r\n\r\n [96] \"Lectures on Animal Chemistry.\"  By Dr. Bence Jones.  _Medical\r\n      Times_, Sept. 13th, 1851. See also _Prin. of Phys._, p. 171.\r\n\r\n [97] _Cyclopædia of Anatomy and Physiology_, Vol. IV, p. 506.\r\n\r\n [98] From a remark of Drs. Wagner and Leuckart this chemical evidence\r\n      seems to have already suggested the idea that the sperm-cell becomes\r\n      \"metamorphosed into the central parts of the nervous system.\" But\r\n      though they reject this assumption, and though the experiments of Mr.\r\n      Newport clearly render it untenable, yet none of the facts latterly\r\n      brought to light conflict with the hypothesis that the sperm-cell\r\n      contains unorganized co-ordinating matter.\r\n\r\n [99] Quain's _Elements of Anatomy_, p. 672.\r\n\r\n[100] The maximum weight of the horse's brain is 1 lb. 7 ozs.; the human\r\n      brain weighs 3 lbs., and occasionally as much as 4 lbs.; the brain of\r\n      a whale, 75 feet long, weighed 5 lbs. 5 ozs.; and the elephant's\r\n      brain reaches from 8 lbs. to 10 lbs. Of the whale's fertility we know\r\n      nothing; but the elephant's quite agrees with the hypothesis. The\r\n      elephant does not attain its full size until it is thirty years old,\r\n      from which we may infer that it arrives at a reproductive age later\r\n      than man does; its period of gestation is two years, and it produces\r\n      one at a birth. Evidently, therefore, it is much less prolific than\r\n      man. See Müller's _Physiology_ (Baly's translation), p. 815, and\r\n      Quain's _Elements of Anatomy_, p. 671.\r\n\r\n[101] That the size of the nervous system is the measure of the ability to\r\n      maintain life, is a proposition that must, however, be taken with\r\n      some qualifications. The ratio between the amounts of gray and white\r\n      matter present in each case is probably a circumstance of moment.\r\n      Moreover, the temperature of the blood may have a modifying\r\n      influence; seeing that small nervous centres exposed to rapid\r\n      oxidation will be equivalent to larger ones more slowly oxidized.\r\n      Indeed, we see amongst mankind, that though, in the main, size of\r\n      brain determines mental power, yet temperament exercises some\r\n      control. There is reason to think, too, that certain kinds of nervous\r\n      action involve greater consumption of nervous tissue than others; and\r\n      this will somewhat complicate the comparisons. Nevertheless, these\r\n      admissions do not affect the generalization as a whole, but merely\r\n      prepare us to meet with minor irregularities.\r\n\r\n[102] Let me here note in passing a highly significant implication. The\r\n      development of nervous structures which in such cases take place,\r\n      cannot be limited to the finger-ends. If we figure to ourselves the\r\n      separate sensitive areas which severally yield independent feelings,\r\n      as constituting a network (not, indeed, a network sharply marked out,\r\n      but probably one such that the ultimate fibrils in each area intrude\r\n      more or less into adjacent areas, so that the separations are\r\n      indefinite), it is manifest that when, with exercise, the structure\r\n      has become further elaborated, and the meshes of the network smaller,\r\n      there must be a multiplication of fibres communicating with the\r\n      central nervous system. If two adjacent areas were supplied by\r\n      branches of one fibre, the touching of either would yield to\r\n      consciousness the same sensation: there could be no discrimination\r\n      between points touching the two. That there may be discrimination,\r\n      there must be a distinct connection between each area and the tract\r\n      of grey matter which receives the impressions. Nay more, there must\r\n      be, in this central recipient-tract, an added number of the separate\r\n      elements which, by their excitements, yield separate feelings. So\r\n      that this increased power of tactual discrimination implies a\r\n      peripheral development, a multiplication of fibres in the\r\n      trunk-nerve, and a complication of the nerve-centre. It can scarcely\r\n      be doubted that analogous changes occur under analogous conditions\r\n      throughout all parts of the nervous system--not in its sensory\r\n      appliances only, but in all its higher co-ordinating appliances, up\r\n      to the highest.\r\n\r\n[103] _Essays upon Heredity_, p. 87.\r\n\r\n[104] _Les Maladies des Vers à soie_, par L. Pasteur, Vol. I, p. 39.\r\n\r\n[105] Curiously enough, Weismann refers to, and recognizes, syphilitic\r\n      infection of the reproductive cells. Dealing with Brown-Séquard's\r\n      cases of inherited epilepsy (concerning which, let me say, that I do\r\n      not commit myself to any derived conclusions), he says:--\"In the case\r\n      of epilepsy, at any rate, it is easy to imagine [many of Weismann's\r\n      arguments are based on things 'it is easy to imagine'] that the\r\n      passage of some specific organism through the reproductive cells may\r\n      take place, as in the case of syphilis\" (p. 82). Here is a sample of\r\n      his reasoning. It is well known that epilepsy is frequently caused by\r\n      some peripheral irritation (even by the lodging of a small foreign\r\n      body under the skin), and that, among peripheral irritations causing\r\n      it, imperfect healing is one. Yet though, in Brown-Séquard's cases, a\r\n      peripheral irritation caused in the parent by local injury was the\r\n      apparent origin, Weismann chooses gratuitously to assume that the\r\n      progeny were infected by \"some specific organism,\" which produced the\r\n      epilepsy! And then though the epileptic virus, like the syphilitic\r\n      virus, makes itself at home in the egg, the parental protoplasm is\r\n      not admitted!\r\n\r\n[106] _Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society for the Year 1821_,\r\n      Part I, pp. 20-24.\r\n\r\n[107] It will, I suppose, be said that the non-inheritance of mutilations\r\n      constitutes evidence of the kind here asked for. The first reply is\r\n      that the evidence is conflicting, as it may well be. It is forgotten\r\n      that to have valid evidence of non-inheritance of mutilations, it is\r\n      requisite that both parents shall have undergone mutilation, and that\r\n      this does not often happen. If they have not, then, assuming the\r\n      inheritableness of mutilations, there would, leaving out other\r\n      causes, be an equal tendency to appearance and non-appearance of the\r\n      mutilation in offspring. But there is another cause--the tendency to\r\n      reversion, which ever works in the direction of cancelling individual\r\n      characters by the return to ancestral characters. So that even were\r\n      the inheritance of mutilations to be expected (and for myself I may\r\n      say that its occurrence surprises me), it could not be reasonably\r\n      looked for as more than exceptional: there are two strong\r\n      countervailing tendencies. But now, in the second place, let it be\r\n      remarked that the inheritance or non-inheritance of mutilations is\r\n      beside the question. The question is whether modifications of parts\r\n      produced by modifications of functions are inheritable or not. And\r\n      then, by way of disproof of their inheritableness, we are referred to\r\n      cases in which the modifications of parts are not produced by\r\n      modifications of functions, but are otherwise produced!\r\n\r\n[108] See _First Principles_, Part II, Chap. XXII, \"Equilibration.\"\r\n\r\n[109] _Principles of Biology_, § 46, (No. 8. April, 1863).\r\n\r\n[110] _Ibid._ This must not be understood as implying that while the mass\r\n      increases as the cubes, the _quantity of motion_ which can be\r\n      generated increases only as the squares; for this would not be true.\r\n      The quantity of motion is obviously measured, not by the sectional\r\n      areas of the muscles alone, but by these multiplied into their\r\n      lengths, and therefore increases as the cubes. But this admission\r\n      leaves untouched the conclusion that the ability to _bear stress_\r\n      increases only as the squares; and thus limits the ability to\r\n      generate motion, by relative incoherence of materials.\r\n\r\n[111] _The Transactions of the Linnæan Society of London_, Vol. XXII, p.\r\n      215. The estimate of Reaumur, cited by Kirby and Spence, is still\r\n      higher--\"in five generations one Aphis may be the progenitor of\r\n      5,904,900,000 descendants; and that it is supposed that in one year\r\n      there may be twenty generations.\" (_Introduction to Entomology_, Vol.\r\n      I, p. 175)\r\n\r\n[112] _A Manual of the Anatomy of Invertebrated Animals_, by T. H. Huxley,\r\n      p. 206.\r\n\r\n[113] Respecting the _Eloidea_ I learn that in 1879--thirty years after it\r\n      had become a pest--one solitary male plant was found in a pond near\r\n      Edinburgh; but \"in an exhaustive inquiry on the plant made by Dr.\r\n      Groenland, of Copenhagen, he could find no trace of any male\r\n      specimens having been found in Europe other than the Scotch.\" In\r\n      waters from which the _Eloidea_ has disappeared, it seems to have\r\n      done so in consequence of the growth of an _Alga_, which has produced\r\n      turbid water unfavourable to it. That is to say, the decreased\r\n      multiplication of somatic cells in some cases, is not due to any\r\n      exhaustion, but is caused by the rise of enemies or adverse\r\n      conditions; as happens generally with introduced species of plants\r\n      and animals which multiply at first enormously, and then, without any\r\n      loss of reproductive power, begin to decrease under the antagonizing\r\n      influences which grow up.\r\n\r\n[114] _A Text Book of Human Physiology._ By Austin Flint, M.D., LL.D.\r\n      Fourth edition. New York: D. Appleton & Co. 1888. Page 797.\r\n\r\n[115] This supposition I find verified by Mr. A. S. Packard in his\r\n      elaborate monograph on \"The Cave Fauna of North America, &c.,\" as\r\n      also in his article published in the _American Naturalist_,\r\n      September, 1888; for he there mentions \"variations in _Pseudotremia\r\n      cavernarum_ and _Tomocerus plumbeus_, found living near the entrance\r\n      to caves in partial daylight.\" The facts, as accumulated by Mr.\r\n      Packard, furnished a much more complete answer to Prof. Lankester\r\n      than is above given, as, for example, the \"blindness of _Neotoma_, or\r\n      the Wood-Rat of Mammoth Cave.\" It seems that there are also \"cave\r\n      beetles, with or without rudimentary eyes,\" and \"eyeless spiders\" and\r\n      Myriapods. And there are insects, as some \"species of Anophthalmus\r\n      and Adelops, whose larvæ are lacking in all traces of eyes and optic\r\n      nerves and lobes.\" These instances cannot be explained as sequences\r\n      of an inrush of water carrying with it the remote ancestors, some of\r\n      which did not find their way out; nor can others of them be explained\r\n      by supposing an inrush of air, which did the like.\r\n\r\n[116] See \"Social Organism\" in _Westminster Review_ for January, 1860; also\r\n      _Principles of Sociology_, § 247.\r\n\r\n[117] _Contemporary Review_, September, 1893.\r\n\r\n[118] _Evolution of Sex_, p. 50.\r\n\r\n[119] _Souvenirs Entomologiques_, 3^{me} Série, p. 328.\r\n\r\n[120] _Natural History of Bees_, new ed., p. 33.\r\n\r\n[121] _Origin of Species_, 6th ed., p. 232.\r\n\r\n[122] _Contemporary Review_, September, 1893, p. 333.\r\n\r\n[123] _The Entomologist's Monthly Magazine_, March, 1892, p. 61.\r\n\r\n[124] Perhaps it will be alleged that nerve-matter is costly, and that this\r\n      minute economy might be of importance. Anyone who thinks this will no\r\n      longer think it after contemplating a litter of half-a-dozen young\r\n      rabbits (in the wild rabbit the number varies from four to eight);\r\n      and on remembering that the nerve-matter contained in their brains\r\n      and spinal cords, as well as the materials for building up the bones,\r\n      muscles, and viscera of their bodies, has been supplied by the doe in\r\n      the space of a month; at the same time that she has sustained herself\r\n      and carried on her activities: all this being done on relatively poor\r\n      food. Nerve-matter cannot be so very costly then.\r\n\r\n[125] _Loc. cit._, p. 318.\r\n\r\n[126] _The Germ Plasm_, p. 54.\r\n\r\n[127] While Professor Weismann has not dealt with my argument derived from\r\n      the distribution of discriminativeness on the skin, it has been\r\n      criticized by Mr. McKeen Cattell, in the last number of _Mind_\r\n      (October, 1893). His general argument, vitiated by extreme\r\n      misconceptions, I need not deal with. He says:--\"Whether changes\r\n      acquired by the individual are hereditary, and if so to what extent,\r\n      is a question of great interest for ethics no less than for biology.\r\n      But Mr. Spencer's application of this doctrine to account for the\r\n      origin of species [!] simply begs the question. He assumes useful\r\n      variations [!]--whether of structure or habit is immaterial--without\r\n      attempting to explain their origin\": two absolute misstatements in\r\n      two sentences! The only part of Mr. Cattell's criticism requiring\r\n      reply is that which concerns the \"sensation-areas\" on the skin. He\r\n      implies that since Weber, experimental psychologists have practically\r\n      set aside the theory of sensation areas: showing, among other things,\r\n      that relatively great accuracy of discrimination can be quickly\r\n      acquired by \"increased interest and attention.... Practice for a few\r\n      minutes will double the accuracy of discrimination, and practice on\r\n      one side of the body is carried over to the other.\" To me it seems\r\n      manifest that \"increased interest and attention\" will not enable a\r\n      patient to discriminate two points where a few minutes before he\r\n      could perceive only one. That which he can really do in this short\r\n      time is to learn to discriminate between the _massiveness of a\r\n      sensation_ produced by two points and the massiveness of that\r\n      produced by one, and to _infer_ one point or two points accordingly.\r\n      Respecting the existence of sensation-areas marked off from one\r\n      another, I may, in the first place, remark that since the eye\r\n      originates as a dermal sac, and since its retina is a highly\r\n      developed part of the sensitive surface at large, and since the\r\n      discriminative power of the retina depends on the division of it into\r\n      numerous rods and cones, each of which gives a separate\r\n      sensation-area, it would be strange were the discriminative power of\r\n      the skin at large achieved by mechanism fundamentally different. In\r\n      the second place I may remark that if Mr. Cattell will refer to\r\n      Professor Gustav Retzius's _Biologische Untersuchungen_, New Series,\r\n      vol. iv (Stockholm, 1892), he will see elaborate diagrams of\r\n      superficial nerve-endings in various animals showing many degrees of\r\n      separateness. I guarded myself against being supposed to think that\r\n      the sensation-areas are sharply marked off from one another; and\r\n      suggested, contrariwise, that probably the branching\r\n      nerve-terminations intruded among the branches of adjacent\r\n      nerve-terminations. Here let me add that the intrusion may vary\r\n      greatly in extent; and that where the intruding fibres run far among\r\n      those of adjacent areas, the discriminativeness will be but small,\r\n      while it will be great in proportion as each set of branching fibres\r\n      is restricted more nearly to its own area. All the facts are\r\n      explicable on this supposition.\r\n\r\n[128] To save space and exclude needless complication I have omitted these\r\n      passages from the preceding divisions of this appendix.\r\n\r\n[129] Though Professor Weismann does not take up the challenge, Dr. Romanes\r\n      does. He says:--\"When selection is withdrawn there will be no\r\n      excessive _plus_ variations, because so long as selection was present\r\n      the efficiency of the organ was maintained at its highest level: it\r\n      was only the _minus_ variations which were then eliminated\"\r\n      (_Contemporary Review_, p. 611). In the first place, it seems to me\r\n      that the phrases used in this sentence beg the question. It says that\r\n      \"the efficiency of the organ was maintained at its _highest_ level\";\r\n      which implies that the highest level (tacitly identified with the\r\n      greatest size) is the best and that the tendency is to fall below it.\r\n      This is the very thing I ask proof of. Suppose I invert the idea and\r\n      say that the organ is maintained at its right size by natural\r\n      selection, because this prevents increase beyond the size which is\r\n      best for the organism. Every organ should be in due proportion, and\r\n      the welfare of the creature as a whole is interfered with by excess\r\n      as well as by defect. It may be directly interfered with--as for\r\n      instance by too big an eyelid; and it may be indirectly interfered\r\n      with, where the organ is large, by needless weight and cost of\r\n      nutrition. In the second place the question which here concerns us is\r\n      not what natural selection will do with variations. We are concerned\r\n      with the previous question--What variations will arise? An organ\r\n      varies in all ways; and, unless reason to the contrary is shown, the\r\n      assumption must be that variations in the direction of increase are\r\n      as frequent and as great as those in the direction of decrease. Take\r\n      the case of the tongue. Certainly there are tongues inconveniently\r\n      large, and probably tongues inconveniently small. What reason have we\r\n      for assuming that the inconveniently small tongues occur more\r\n      frequently than the inconveniently large ones? None that I can see.\r\n      Dr. Romanes has not shown that when natural selection ceases to act\r\n      on an organ the _minus_ variations in each new generation will exceed\r\n      the _plus_ variations. But if they are equal the alleged process of\r\n      panmixia has no place.\r\n\r\n[130] _The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication_, vol. ii,\r\n      p. 292.\r\n\r\n[131] _Journal of the Anthropological Institute_ for 1885, p. 253.\r\n\r\n[132] In \"The All-Sufficiency of Natural Selection\" (_Contemporary Review_,\r\n      Sept., 1893, p. 311), Professor Weismann writes:--\"I have ever\r\n      contended that the acceptance of a principle of explanation is\r\n      justified, if it can be shown that without it certain facts are\r\n      inexplicable.\" Unless, then, Prof. Weismann can show that the\r\n      distribution of discriminativeness is otherwise explicable, he is\r\n      bound to accept the explanation I have given, and admit the\r\n      inheritance of acquired characters.\r\n\r\n[133] Prof. Weismann is unaware that the view here ascribed to Roux,\r\n      writing in 1881, is of far earlier date. In the _Westminster Review_\r\n      for January, 1860, in an essay on \"The Social Organism,\" I\r\n      wrote:--\"One more parallelism to be here noted, is that the different\r\n      parts of a social organism, like the different parts of an individual\r\n      organism, compete for nutriment; and severally obtain more or less of\r\n      it according as they are discharging more or less duty.\" (See also\r\n      _Essays_, i, 290.) And then, in 1876, in _The Principles of\r\n      Sociology_, vol. i, § 247, I amplified the statement thus:--\"All\r\n      other organs, therefore, jointly and individually, compete for blood\r\n      with each organ ... local tissue-formation (which under normal\r\n      conditions measures the waste of tissue in discharging function) is\r\n      itself a cause of increased supply of materials ... the resulting\r\n      competition, not between units simply, but between organs, causes in\r\n      a society, as in a living body, high nutrition and growth of parts\r\n      called into greatest activity by the requirements of the rest.\"\r\n      Though I did not use the imposing phrase\r\n      \"intra-individual-selection,\" the process described is the same.\r\n\r\n[134] _Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington_, vol. ix.\r\n\r\n[135] Romanes Lecture, p. 29.\r\n\r\n[136] _Ibid._, p. 35.\r\n\r\n[137] This interpretation harmonizes with a fact which I learn from Prof.\r\n      Riley, that there are gradations in this development, and that in\r\n      some species the ordinary neuters swell their abdomens so greatly\r\n      with food that they can hardly get home.",
