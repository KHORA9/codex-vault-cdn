On the big maps this deserted area is painted in a\r\nfluffy blue, growing fainter in color as it leaves the banks, and\r\nacross it may be seen in large straggling letters the word _Sümpfe_,\r\nmeaning marshes.\r\n\r\nIn high flood this great acreage of sand, shingle-beds, and\r\nwillow-grown islands is almost topped by the water, but in normal\r\nseasons the bushes bend and rustle in the free winds, showing their\r\nsilver leaves to the sunshine in an ever-moving plain of bewildering\r\nbeauty. These willows never attain to the dignity of trees; they have\r\nno rigid trunks; they remain humble bushes, with rounded tops and soft\r\noutline, swaying on slender stems that answer to the least pressure of\r\nthe wind; supple as grasses, and so continually shifting that they\r\nsomehow give the impression that the entire plain is moving and alive.\r\nFor the wind sends waves rising and falling over the whole surface,\r\nwaves of leaves instead of waves of water, green swells like the sea,\r\ntoo, until the branches turn and lift, and then silvery white as their\r\nunderside turns to the sun.\r\n\r\nHappy to slip beyond the control of the stern banks, the Danube here\r\nwanders about at will among the intricate network of channels\r\nintersecting the islands everywhere with broad avenues down which the\r\nwaters pour with a shouting sound; making whirlpools, eddies, and\r\nfoaming rapids; tearing at the sandy banks; carrying away masses of\r\nshore and willow-clumps; and forming new islands innumerably which\r\nshift daily in size and shape and possess at best an impermanent life,\r\nsince the flood-time obliterates their very existence.\r\n\r\nProperly speaking, this fascinating part of the river’s life begins\r\nsoon after leaving Pressburg, and we, in our Canadian canoe, with gipsy\r\ntent and frying-pan on board, reached it on the crest of a rising flood\r\nabout mid-July. That very same morning, when the sky was reddening\r\nbefore sunrise, we had slipped swiftly through still-sleeping Vienna,\r\nleaving it a couple of hours later a mere patch of smoke against the\r\nblue hills of the Wienerwald on the horizon; we had breakfasted below\r\nFischeramend under a grove of birch trees roaring in the wind; and had\r\nthen swept on the tearing current past Orth, Hainburg, Petronell (the\r\nold Roman Carnuntum of Marcus Aurelius), and so under the frowning\r\nheights of Thelsen on a spur of the Carpathians, where the March steals\r\nin quietly from the left and the frontier is crossed between Austria\r\nand Hungary.\r\n\r\nRacing along at twelve kilometers an hour soon took us well into\r\nHungary, and the muddy waters—sure sign of flood—sent us aground on\r\nmany a shingle-bed, and twisted us like a cork in many a sudden\r\nbelching whirlpool before the towers of Pressburg (Hungarian, Pozsóny)\r\nshowed against the sky; and then the canoe, leaping like a spirited\r\nhorse, flew at top speed under the grey walls, negotiated safely the\r\nsunken chain of the Fliegende Brucke ferry, turned the corner sharply\r\nto the left, and plunged on yellow foam into the wilderness of islands,\r\nsandbanks, and swamp-land beyond—the land of the willows.\r\n\r\nThe change came suddenly, as when a series of bioscope pictures snaps\r\ndown on the streets of a town and shifts without warning into the\r\nscenery of lake and forest. We entered the land of desolation on wings,\r\nand in less than half an hour there was neither boat nor fishing-hut\r\nnor red roof, nor any single sign of human habitation and civilization\r\nwithin sight. The sense of remoteness from the world of humankind, the\r\nutter isolation, the fascination of this singular world of willows,\r\nwinds, and waters, instantly laid its spell upon us both, so that we\r\nallowed laughingly to one another that we ought by rights to have held\r\nsome special kind of passport to admit us, and that we had, somewhat\r\naudaciously, come without asking leave into a separate little kingdom\r\nof wonder and magic—a kingdom that was reserved for the use of others\r\nwho had a right to it, with everywhere unwritten warnings to\r\ntrespassers for those who had the imagination to discover them.\r\n\r\nThough still early in the afternoon, the ceaseless buffetings of a most\r\ntempestuous wind made us feel weary, and we at once began casting about\r\nfor a suitable camping-ground for the night. But the bewildering\r\ncharacter of the islands made landing difficult; the swirling flood\r\ncarried us in shore and then swept us out again; the willow branches\r\ntore our hands as we seized them to stop the canoe, and we pulled many\r\na yard of sandy bank into the water before at length we shot with a\r\ngreat sideways blow from the wind into a backwater and managed to beach\r\nthe bows in a cloud of spray. Then we lay panting and laughing after\r\nour exertions on the hot yellow sand, sheltered from the wind, and in\r\nthe full blaze of a scorching sun, a cloudless blue sky above, and an\r\nimmense army of dancing, shouting willow bushes, closing in from all\r\nsides, shining with spray and clapping their thousand little hands as\r\nthough to applaud the success of our efforts.\r\n\r\n“What a river!” I said to my companion, thinking of all the way we had\r\ntraveled from the source in the Black Forest, and how he had often been\r\nobliged to wade and push in the upper shallows at the beginning of\r\nJune.\r\n\r\n“Won’t stand much nonsense now, will it?” he said, pulling the canoe a\r\nlittle farther into safety up the sand, and then composing himself for\r\na nap.\r\n\r\nI lay by his side, happy and peaceful in the bath of the\r\nelements—water, wind, sand, and the great fire of the sun—thinking of\r\nthe long journey that lay behind us, and of the great stretch before us\r\nto the Black Sea, and how lucky I was to have such a delightful and\r\ncharming traveling companion as my friend, the Swede.\r\n\r\nWe had made many similar journeys together, but the Danube, more than\r\nany other river I knew, impressed us from the very beginning with its\r\n_aliveness_. From its tiny bubbling entry into the world among the\r\npinewood gardens of Donaueschingen, until this moment when it began to\r\nplay the great river-game of losing itself among the deserted swamps,\r\nunobserved, unrestrained, it had seemed to us like following the growth\r\nof some living creature. Sleepy at first, but later developing violent\r\ndesires as it became conscious of its deep soul, it rolled, like some\r\nhuge fluid being, through all the countries we had passed, holding our\r\nlittle craft on its mighty shoulders, playing roughly with us\r\nsometimes, yet always friendly and well-meaning, till at length we had\r\ncome inevitably to regard it as a Great Personage.\r\n\r\nHow, indeed, could it be otherwise, since it told us so much of its\r\nsecret life? At night we heard it singing to the moon as we lay in our\r\ntent, uttering that odd sibilant note peculiar to itself and said to be\r\ncaused by the rapid tearing of the pebbles along its bed, so great is\r\nits hurrying speed. We knew, too, the voice of its gurgling whirlpools,\r\nsuddenly bubbling up on a surface previously quite calm; the roar of\r\nits shallows and swift rapids; its constant steady thundering below all\r\nmere surface sounds; and that ceaseless tearing of its icy waters at\r\nthe banks. How it stood up and shouted when the rains fell flat upon\r\nits face! And how its laughter roared out when the wind blew up-stream\r\nand tried to stop its growing speed! We knew all its sounds and voices,\r\nits tumblings and foamings, its unnecessary splashing against the\r\nbridges; that self-conscious chatter when there were hills to look on;\r\nthe affected dignity of its speech when it passed through the little\r\ntowns, far too important to laugh; and all these faint, sweet\r\nwhisperings when the sun caught it fairly in some slow curve and poured\r\ndown upon it till the steam rose.\r\n\r\nIt was full of tricks, too, in its early life before the great world\r\nknew it. There were places in the upper reaches among the Swabian\r\nforests, when yet the first whispers of its destiny had not reached it,\r\nwhere it elected to disappear through holes in the ground, to appear\r\nagain on the other side of the porous limestone hills and start a new\r\nriver with another name; leaving, too, so little water in its own bed\r\nthat we had to climb out and wade and push the canoe through miles of\r\nshallows.\r\n\r\nAnd a chief pleasure, in those early days of its irresponsible youth,\r\nwas to lie low, like Brer Fox, just before the little turbulent\r\ntributaries came to join it from the Alps, and to refuse to acknowledge\r\nthem when in, but to run for miles side by side, the dividing line well\r\nmarked, the very levels different, the Danube utterly declining to\r\nrecognize the newcomer. Below Passau, however, it gave up this\r\nparticular trick, for there the Inn comes in with a thundering power\r\nimpossible to ignore, and so pushes and incommodes the parent river\r\nthat there is hardly room for them in the long twisting gorge that\r\nfollows, and the Danube is shoved this way and that against the cliffs,\r\nand forced to hurry itself with great waves and much dashing to and fro\r\nin order to get through in time. And during the fight our canoe slipped\r\ndown from its shoulder to its breast, and had the time of its life\r\namong the struggling waves. But the Inn taught the old river a lesson,\r\nand after Passau it no longer pretended to ignore new arrivals.\r\n\r\nThis was many days back, of course, and since then we had come to know\r\nother aspects of the great creature, and across the Bavarian wheat\r\nplain of Straubing she wandered so slowly under the blazing June sun\r\nthat we could well imagine only the surface inches were water, while\r\nbelow there moved, concealed as by a silken mantle, a whole army of\r\nUndines, passing silently and unseen down to the sea, and very\r\nleisurely too, lest they be discovered.\r\n\r\nMuch, too, we forgave her because of her friendliness to the birds and\r\nanimals that haunted the shores. Cormorants lined the banks in lonely\r\nplaces in rows like short black palings; grey crows crowded the\r\nshingle-beds; storks stood fishing in the vistas of shallower water\r\nthat opened up between the islands, and hawks, swans, and marsh birds\r\nof all sorts filled the air with glinting wings and singing, petulant\r\ncries. It was impossible to feel annoyed with the river’s vagaries\r\nafter seeing a deer leap with a splash into the water at sunrise and\r\nswim past the bows of the canoe; and often we saw fawns peering at us\r\nfrom the underbrush, or looked straight into the brown eyes of a stag\r\nas we charged full tilt round a corner and entered another reach of the\r\nriver. Foxes, too, everywhere haunted the banks, tripping daintily\r\namong the driftwood and disappearing so suddenly that it was impossible\r\nto see how they managed it.\r\n\r\nBut now, after leaving Pressburg, everything changed a little, and the\r\nDanube became more serious. It ceased trifling. It was half-way to the\r\nBlack Sea, within seeming distance almost of other, stranger countries\r\nwhere no tricks would be permitted or understood. It became suddenly\r\ngrown-up, and claimed our respect and even our awe. It broke out into\r\nthree arms, for one thing, that only met again a hundred kilometers\r\nfarther down, and for a canoe there were no indications which one was\r\nintended to be followed.\r\n\r\n“If you take a side channel,” said the Hungarian officer we met in the\r\nPressburg shop while buying provisions, “you may find yourselves, when\r\nthe flood subsides, forty miles from anywhere, high and dry, and you\r\nmay easily starve. There are no people, no farms, no fishermen. I warn\r\nyou not to continue. The river, too, is still rising, and this wind\r\nwill increase.”\r\n\r\nThe rising river did not alarm us in the least, but the matter of being\r\nleft high and dry by a sudden subsidence of the waters might be\r\nserious, and we had consequently laid in an extra stock of provisions.\r\nFor the rest, the officer’s prophecy held true, and the wind, blowing\r\ndown a perfectly clear sky, increased steadily till it reached the\r\ndignity of a westerly gale.\r\n\r\nIt was earlier than usual when we camped, for the sun was a good hour\r\nor two from the horizon, and leaving my friend still asleep on the hot\r\nsand, I wandered about in desultory examination of our hotel. The\r\nisland, I found, was less than an acre in extent, a mere sandy bank\r\nstanding some two or three feet above the level of the river. The far\r\nend, pointing into the sunset, was covered with flying spray which the\r\ntremendous wind drove off the crests of the broken waves. It was\r\ntriangular in shape, with the apex up stream.\r\n\r\nI stood there for several minutes, watching the impetuous crimson flood\r\nbearing down with a shouting roar, dashing in waves against the bank as\r\nthough to sweep it bodily away, and then swirling by in two foaming\r\nstreams on either side. The ground seemed to shake with the shock and\r\nrush, while the furious movement of the willow bushes as the wind\r\npoured over them increased the curious illusion that the island itself\r\nactually moved. Above, for a mile or two, I could see the great river\r\ndescending upon me; it was like looking up the slope of a sliding hill,\r\nwhite with foam, and leaping up everywhere to show itself to the sun.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the island was too thickly grown with willows to make\r\nwalking pleasant, but I made the tour, nevertheless. From the lower end\r\nthe light, of course, changed, and the river looked dark and angry.\r\nOnly the backs of the flying waves were visible, streaked with foam,\r\nand pushed forcibly by the great puffs of wind that fell upon them from\r\nbehind. For a short mile it was visible, pouring in and out among the\r\nislands, and then disappearing with a huge sweep into the willows,\r\nwhich closed about it like a herd of monstrous antediluvian creatures\r\ncrowding down to drink. They made me think of gigantic sponge-like\r\ngrowths that sucked the river up into themselves. They caused it to\r\nvanish from sight. They herded there together in such overpowering\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nAltogether it was an impressive scene, with its utter loneliness, its\r\nbizarre suggestion; and as I gazed, long and curiously, a singular\r\nemotion began to stir somewhere in the depths of me. Midway in my\r\ndelight of the wild beauty, there crept, unbidden and unexplained, a\r\ncurious feeling of disquietude, almost of alarm.\r\n\r\nA rising river, perhaps, always suggests something of the ominous; many\r\nof the little islands I saw before me would probably have been swept\r\naway by the morning; this resistless, thundering flood of water touched\r\nthe sense of awe. Yet I was aware that my uneasiness lay deeper far\r\nthan the emotions of awe and wonder. It was not that I felt. Nor had it\r\ndirectly to do with the power of the driving wind—this shouting\r\nhurricane that might almost carry up a few acres of willows into the\r\nair and scatter them like so much chaff over the landscape. The wind\r\nwas simply enjoying itself, for nothing rose out of the flat landscape\r\nto stop it, and I was conscious of sharing its great game with a kind\r\nof pleasurable excitement. Yet this novel emotion had nothing to do\r\nwith the wind. Indeed, so vague was the sense of distress I\r\nexperienced, that it was impossible to trace it to its source and deal\r\nwith it accordingly, though I was aware somehow that it had to do with\r\nmy realization of our utter insignificance before this unrestrained\r\npower of the elements about me. The huge-grown river had something to\r\ndo with it too—a vague, unpleasant idea that we had somehow trifled\r\nwith these great elemental forces in whose power we lay helpless every\r\nhour of the day and night. For here, indeed, they were gigantically at\r\nplay together, and the sight appealed to the imagination.\r\n\r\nBut my emotion, so far as I could understand it, seemed to attach\r\nitself more particularly to the willow bushes, to these acres and acres\r\nof willows, crowding, so thickly growing there, swarming everywhere the\r\neye could reach, pressing upon the river as though to suffocate it,\r\nstanding in dense array mile after mile beneath the sky, watching,\r\nwaiting, listening. And, apart quite from the elements, the willows\r\nconnected themselves subtly with my malaise, attacking the mind\r\ninsidiously somehow by reason of their vast numbers, and contriving in\r\nsome way or other to represent to the imagination a new and mighty\r\npower, a power, moreover, not altogether friendly to us.\r\n\r\nGreat revelations of nature, of course, never fail to impress in one\r\nway or another, and I was no stranger to moods of the kind. Mountains\r\noverawe and oceans terrify, while the mystery of great forests\r\nexercises a spell peculiarly its own. But all these, at one point or\r\nanother, somewhere link on intimately with human life and human\r\nexperience. They stir comprehensible, even if alarming, emotions. They\r\ntend on the whole to exalt.\r\n\r\nWith this multitude of willows, however, it was something far\r\ndifferent, I felt. Some essence emanated from them that besieged the\r\nheart. A sense of awe awakened, true, but of awe touched somewhere by a\r\nvague terror. Their serried ranks, growing everywhere darker about me\r\nas the shadows deepened, moving furiously yet softly in the wind, woke\r\nin me the curious and unwelcome suggestion that we had trespassed here\r\nupon the borders of an alien world, a world where we were intruders, a\r\nworld where we were not wanted or invited to remain—where we ran grave\r\nrisks perhaps!\r\n\r\nThe feeling, however, though it refused to yield its meaning entirely\r\nto analysis, did not at the time trouble me by passing into menace. Yet\r\nit never left me quite, even during the very practical business of\r\nputting up the tent in a hurricane of wind and building a fire for the\r\nstew-pot. It remained, just enough to bother and perplex, and to rob a\r\nmost delightful camping-ground of a good portion of its charm. To my\r\ncompanion, however, I said nothing, for he was a man I considered\r\ndevoid of imagination. In the first place, I could never have explained\r\nto him what I meant, and in the second, he would have laughed stupidly\r\nat me if I had.\r\n\r\nThere was a slight depression in the center of the island, and here we\r\npitched the tent. The surrounding willows broke the wind a bit.\r\n\r\n“A poor camp,” observed the imperturbable Swede when at last the tent\r\nstood upright, “no stones and precious little firewood. I’m for moving\r\non early tomorrow—eh? This sand won’t hold anything.”\r\n\r\nBut the experience of a collapsing tent at midnight had taught us many\r\ndevices, and we made the cozy gipsy house as safe as possible, and then\r\nset about collecting a store of wood to last till bed-time. Willow\r\nbushes drop no branches, and driftwood was our only source of supply.\r\nWe hunted the shores pretty thoroughly. Everywhere the banks were\r\ncrumbling as the rising flood tore at them and carried away great\r\nportions with a splash and a gurgle.\r\n\r\n“The island’s much smaller than when we landed,” said the accurate\r\nSwede. “It won’t last long at this rate. We’d better drag the canoe\r\nclose to the tent, and be ready to start at a moment’s notice. I shall\r\nsleep in my clothes.”\r\n\r\nHe was a little distance off, climbing along the bank, and I heard his\r\nrather jolly laugh as he spoke.\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” I heard him call, a moment later, and turned to see what had\r\ncaused his exclamation. But for the moment he was hidden by the\r\nwillows, and I could not find him.\r\n\r\n“What in the world’s this?” I heard him cry again, and this time his\r\nvoice had become serious.\r\n\r\nI ran up quickly and joined him on the bank. He was looking over the\r\nriver, pointing at something in the water.\r\n\r\n“Good heavens, it’s a man’s body!” he cried excitedly. “Look!”\r\n\r\nA black thing, turning over and over in the foaming waves, swept\r\nrapidly past. It kept disappearing and coming up to the surface again.\r\nIt was about twenty feet from the shore, and just as it was opposite to\r\nwhere we stood it lurched round and looked straight at us. We saw its\r\neyes reflecting the sunset, and gleaming an odd yellow as the body\r\nturned over. Then it gave a swift, gulping plunge, and dived out of\r\nsight in a flash.\r\n\r\n“An otter, by gad!” we exclaimed in the same breath, laughing.\r\n\r\nIt was an otter, alive, and out on the hunt; yet it had looked exactly\r\nlike the body of a drowned man turning helplessly in the current. Far\r\nbelow it came to the surface once again, and we saw its black skin, wet\r\nand shining in the sunlight.\r\n\r\nThen, too, just as we turned back, our arms full of driftwood, another\r\nthing happened to recall us to the river bank. This time it really was\r\na man, and what was more, a man in a boat. Now a small boat on the\r\nDanube was an unusual sight at any time, but here in this deserted\r\nregion, and at flood time, it was so unexpected as to constitute a real\r\nevent. We stood and stared.\r\n\r\nWhether it was due to the slanting sunlight, or the refraction from the\r\nwonderfully illumined water, I cannot say, but, whatever the cause, I\r\nfound it difficult to focus my sight properly upon the flying\r\napparition. It seemed, however, to be a man standing upright in a sort\r\nof flat-bottomed boat, steering with a long oar, and being carried down\r\nthe opposite shore at a tremendous pace. He apparently was looking\r\nacross in our direction, but the distance was too great and the light\r\ntoo uncertain for us to make out very plainly what he was about. It\r\nseemed to me that he was gesticulating and making signs at us. His\r\nvoice came across the water to us shouting something furiously, but the\r\nwind drowned it so that no single word was audible. There was something\r\ncurious about the whole appearance—man, boat, signs, voice—that made an\r\nimpression on me out of all proportion to its cause.\r\n\r\n“He’s crossing himself!” I cried. “Look, he’s making the sign of the\r\nCross!”\r\n\r\n“I believe you’re right,” the Swede said, shading his eyes with his\r\nhand and watching the man out of sight. He seemed to be gone in a\r\nmoment, melting away down there into the sea of willows where the sun\r\ncaught them in the bend of the river and turned them into a great\r\ncrimson wall of beauty. Mist, too, had begun to ruse, so that the air\r\nwas hazy.\r\n\r\n“But what in the world is he doing at nightfall on this flooded river?”\r\nI said, half to myself. “Where is he going at such a time, and what did\r\nhe mean by his signs and shouting? D’you think he wished to warn us\r\nabout something?”\r\n\r\n“He saw our smoke, and thought we were spirits probably,” laughed my\r\ncompanion. “These Hungarians believe in all sorts of rubbish; you\r\nremember the shopwoman at Pressburg warning us that no one ever landed\r\nhere because it belonged to some sort of beings outside man’s world! I\r\nsuppose they believe in fairies and elementals, possibly demons, too.\r\nThat peasant in the boat saw people on the islands for the first time\r\nin his life,” he added, after a slight pause, “and it scared him,\r\nthat’s all.”\r\n\r\nThe Swede’s tone of voice was not convincing, and his manner lacked\r\nsomething that was usually there. I noted the change instantly while he\r\ntalked, though without being able to label it precisely.\r\n\r\n“If they had enough imagination,” I laughed loudly—I remember trying to\r\nmake as much _noise_ as I could—“they might well people a place like\r\nthis with the old gods of antiquity. The Romans must have haunted all\r\nthis region more or less with their shrines and sacred groves and\r\nelemental deities.”\r\n\r\nThe subject dropped and we returned to our stew-pot, for my friend was\r\nnot given to imaginative conversation as a rule. Moreover, just then I\r\nremember feeling distinctly glad that he was not imaginative; his\r\nstolid, practical nature suddenly seemed to me welcome and comforting.\r\nIt was an admirable temperament, I felt; he could steer down rapids\r\nlike a red Indian, shoot dangerous bridges and whirlpools better than\r\nany white man I ever saw in a canoe. He was a grand fellow for an\r\nadventurous trip, a tower of strength when untoward things happened. I\r\nlooked at his strong face and light curly hair as he staggered along\r\nunder his pile of driftwood (twice the size of mine!), and I\r\nexperienced a feeling of relief. Yes, I was distinctly glad just then\r\nthat the Swede was—what he was, and that he never made remarks that\r\nsuggested more than they said.\r\n\r\n“The river’s still rising, though,” he added, as if following out some\r\nthoughts of his own, and dropping his load with a gasp. “This island\r\nwill be under water in two days if it goes on.”\r\n\r\n“I wish the _wind_ would go down,” I said. “I don’t care a fig for the\r\nriver.”\r\n\r\nThe flood, indeed, had no terrors for us; we could get off at ten\r\nminutes’ notice, and the more water the better we liked it. It meant an\r\nincreasing current and the obliteration of the treacherous shingle-beds\r\nthat so often threatened to tear the bottom out of our canoe.\r\n\r\nContrary to our expectations, the wind did not go down with the sun. It\r\nseemed to increase with the darkness, howling overhead and shaking the\r\nwillows round us like straws. Curious sounds accompanied it sometimes,\r\nlike the explosion of heavy guns, and it fell upon the water and the\r\nisland in great flat blows of immense power. It made me think of the\r\nsounds a planet must make, could we only hear it, driving along through\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nBut the sky kept wholly clear of clouds, and soon after supper the full\r\nmoon rose up in the east and covered the river and the plain of\r\nshouting willows with a light like the day.\r\n\r\nWe lay on the sandy patch beside the fire, smoking, listening to the\r\nnoises of the night round us, and talking happily of the journey we had\r\nalready made, and of our plans ahead. The map lay spread in the door of\r\nthe tent, but the high wind made it hard to study, and presently we\r\nlowered the curtain and extinguished the lantern. The firelight was\r\nenough to smoke and see each other’s faces by, and the sparks flew\r\nabout overhead like fireworks. A few yards beyond, the river gurgled\r\nand hissed, and from time to time a heavy splash announced the falling\r\naway of further portions of the bank.\r\n\r\nOur talk, I noticed, had to do with the faraway scenes and incidents of\r\nour first camps in the Black Forest, or of other subjects altogether\r\nremote from the present setting, for neither of us spoke of the actual\r\nmoment more than was necessary—almost as though we had agreed tacitly\r\nto avoid discussion of the camp and its incidents. Neither the otter\r\nnor the boatman, for instance, received the honor of a single mention,\r\nthough ordinarily these would have furnished discussion for the greater\r\npart of the evening. They were, of course, distinct events in such a\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of wood made it a business to keep the fire going, for the\r\nwind, that drove the smoke in our faces wherever we sat, helped at the\r\nsame time to make a forced draught. We took it in turn to make some\r\nforaging expeditions into the darkness, and the quantity the Swede\r\nbrought back always made me feel that he took an absurdly long time\r\nfinding it; for the fact was I did not care much about being left\r\nalone, and yet it always seemed to be my turn to grub about among the\r\nbushes or scramble along the slippery banks in the moonlight. The long\r\nday’s battle with wind and water—such wind and such water!—had tired us\r\nboth, and an early bed was the obvious program. Yet neither of us made\r\nthe move for the tent. We lay there, tending the fire, talking in\r\ndesultory fashion, peering about us into the dense willow bushes, and\r\nlistening to the thunder of wind and river. The loneliness of the place\r\nhad entered our very bones, and silence seemed natural, for after a bit\r\nthe sound of our voices became a trifle unreal and forced; whispering\r\nwould have been the fitting mode of communication, I felt, and the\r\nhuman voice, always rather absurd amid the roar of the elements, now\r\ncarried with it something almost illegitimate. It was like talking out\r\nloud in church, or in some place where it was not lawful, perhaps not\r\nquite _safe_, to be overheard.\r\n\r\nThe eeriness of this lonely island, set among a million willows, swept\r\nby a hurricane, and surrounded by hurrying deep waters, touched us\r\nboth, I fancy. Untrodden by man, almost unknown to man, it lay there\r\nbeneath the moon, remote from human influence, on the frontier of\r\nanother world, an alien world, a world tenanted by willows only and the\r\nsouls of willows. And we, in our rashness, had dared to invade it, even\r\nto make use of it! Something more than the power of its mystery stirred\r\nin me as I lay on the sand, feet to fire, and peered up through the\r\nleaves at the stars. For the last time I rose to get firewood.\r\n\r\n“When this has burnt up,” I said firmly, “I shall turn in,” and my\r\ncompanion watched me lazily as I moved off into the surrounding\r\nshadows.\r\n\r\nFor an unimaginative man I thought he seemed unusually receptive that\r\nnight, unusually open to suggestion of things other than sensory. He\r\ntoo was touched by the beauty and loneliness of the place. I was not\r\naltogether pleased, I remember, to recognize this slight change in him,\r\nand instead of immediately collecting sticks, I made my way to the far\r\npoint of the island where the moonlight on plain and river could be\r\nseen to better advantage. The desire to be alone had come suddenly upon\r\nme; my former dread returned in force; there was a vague feeling in me\r\nI wished to face and probe to the bottom.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the point of sand jutting out among the waves, the spell\r\nof the place descended upon me with a positive shock. No mere “scenery”\r\ncould have produced such an effect. There was something more here,\r\nsomething to alarm.\r\n\r\nI gazed across the waste of wild waters; I watched the whispering\r\nwillows; I heard the ceaseless beating of the tireless wind; and, one\r\nand all, each in its own way, stirred in me this sensation of a strange\r\ndistress. But the _willows_ especially; for ever they went on\r\nchattering and talking among themselves, laughing a little, shrilly\r\ncrying out, sometimes sighing—but what it was they made so much to-do\r\nabout belonged to the secret life of the great plain they inhabited.\r\nAnd it was utterly alien to the world I knew, or to that of the wild\r\nyet kindly elements. They made me think of a host of beings from\r\nanother plane of life, another evolution altogether, perhaps, all\r\ndiscussing a mystery known only to themselves. I watched them moving\r\nbusily together, oddly shaking their big bushy heads, twirling their\r\nmyriad leaves even when there was no wind. They moved of their own will\r\nas though alive, and they touched, by some incalculable method, my own\r\nkeen sense of the _horrible_.\r\n\r\nThere they stood in the moonlight, like a vast army surrounding our\r\ncamp, shaking their innumerable silver spears defiantly, formed all\r\nready for an attack.\r\n\r\nThe psychology of places, for some imaginations at least, is very\r\nvivid; for the wanderer, especially, camps have their “note” either of\r\nwelcome or rejection. At first it may not always be apparent, because\r\nthe busy preparations of tent and cooking prevent, but with the first\r\npause—after supper usually—it comes and announces itself. And the note\r\nof this willow-camp now became unmistakably plain to me; we were\r\ninterlopers, trespassers; we were not welcomed. The sense of\r\nunfamiliarity grew upon me as I stood there watching. We touched the\r\nfrontier of a region where our presence was resented. For a night’s\r\nlodging we might perhaps be tolerated; but for a prolonged and\r\ninquisitive stay—No! by all the gods of the trees and wilderness, no!\r\nWe were the first human influences upon this island, and we were not\r\nwanted. _The willows were against us_.\r\n\r\nStrange thoughts like these, bizarre fancies, borne I know not whence,\r\nfound lodgment in my mind as I stood listening. What, I thought, if,\r\nafter all, these crouching willows proved to be alive; if suddenly they\r\nshould rise up, like a swarm of living creatures, marshaled by the gods\r\nwhose territory we had invaded, sweep towards us off the vast swamps,\r\nbooming overhead in the night—and then _settle down!_ As I looked it\r\nwas so easy to imagine they actually moved, crept nearer, retreated a\r\nlittle, huddled together in masses, hostile, waiting for the great wind\r\nthat should finally start them a-running. I could have sworn their\r\naspect changed a little, and their ranks deepened and pressed more\r\nclosely together.\r\n\r\nThe melancholy shrill cry of a night-bird sounded overhead, and\r\nsuddenly I nearly lost my balance as the piece of bank I stood upon\r\nfell with a great splash into the river, undermined by the flood. I\r\nstepped back just in time, and went on hunting for firewood again, half\r\nlaughing at the odd fancies that crowded so thickly into my mind and\r\ncast their spell upon me. I recalled the Swede’s remark about moving on\r\nnext day, and I was just thinking that I fully agreed with him, when I\r\nturned with a start and saw the subject of my thoughts standing\r\nimmediately in front of me. He was quite close. The roar of the\r\nelements had covered his approach.\r\n\r\n“You’ve been gone so long,” he shouted above the wind, “I thought\r\nsomething must have happened to you.”\r\n\r\nBut there was that in his tone, and a certain look in his face as well,\r\nthat conveyed to me more than his usual words, and in a flash I\r\nunderstood the real reason for his coming. It was because the spell of\r\nthe place had entered his soul too, and he did not like being alone.\r\n\r\n“River still rising,” he cried, pointing to the flood in the moonlight,\r\n“and the wind’s simply awful.”\r\n\r\nHe always said the same things, but it was the cry for companionship\r\nthat gave the real importance to his words.\r\n\r\n“Lucky,” I cried back, “our tent’s in the hollow. I think it’ll hold\r\nall right.” I added something about the difficulty of finding wood, in\r\norder to explain my absence, but the wind caught my words and flung\r\nthem across the river, so that he did not hear, but just looked at me\r\nthrough the branches, nodding his head.\r\n\r\n“Lucky if we get away without disaster!” he shouted, or words to that\r\neffect; and I remember feeling half angry with him for putting the\r\nthought into words, for it was exactly what I felt myself. There was\r\ndisaster impending somewhere, and the sense of presentiment lay\r\nunpleasantly upon me.\r\n\r\nWe went back to the fire and made a final blaze, poking it up with our\r\nfeet. We took a last look round. But for the wind the heat would have\r\nbeen unpleasant. I put this thought into words, and I remember my\r\nfriend’s reply struck me oddly: that he would rather have the heat, the\r\nordinary July weather, than this “diabolical wind.”\r\n\r\nEverything was snug for the night; the canoe lying turned over beside\r\nthe tent, with both yellow paddles beneath her; the provision sack\r\nhanging from a willow-stem, and the washed-up dishes removed to a safe\r\ndistance from the fire, all ready for the morning meal.\r\n\r\nWe smothered the embers of the fire with sand, and then turned in. The\r\nflap of the tent door was up, and I saw the branches and the stars and\r\nthe white moonlight. The shaking willows and the heavy buffetings of\r\nthe wind against our taut little house were the last things I\r\nremembered as sleep came down and covered all with its soft and\r\ndelicious forgetfulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuddenly I found myself lying awake, peering from my sandy mattress\r\nthrough the door of the tent. I looked at my watch pinned against the\r\ncanvas, and saw by the bright moonlight that it was past twelve\r\no’clock—the threshold of a new day—and I had therefore slept a couple\r\nof hours. The Swede was asleep still beside me; the wind howled as\r\nbefore; something plucked at my heart and made me feel afraid. There\r\nwas a sense of disturbance in my immediate neighborhood.\r\n\r\nI sat up quickly and looked out. The trees were swaying violently to\r\nand fro as the gusts smote them, but our little bit of green canvas lay\r\nsnugly safe in the hollow, for the wind passed over it without meeting\r\nenough resistance to make it vicious. The feeling of disquietude did\r\nnot pass, however, and I crawled quietly out of the tent to see if our\r\nbelongings were safe. I moved carefully so as not to waken my\r\ncompanion. A curious excitement was on me.\r\n\r\nI was half-way out, kneeling on all fours, when my eye first took in\r\nthat the tops of the bushes opposite, with their moving tracery of\r\nleaves, made shapes against the sky. I sat back on my haunches and\r\nstared. It was incredible, surely, but there, opposite and slightly\r\nabove me, were shapes of some indeterminate sort among the willows, and\r\nas the branches swayed in the wind they seemed to group themselves\r\nabout these shapes, forming a series of monstrous outlines that shifted\r\nrapidly beneath the moon. Close, about fifty feet in front of me, I saw\r\nthese things.\r\n\r\nMy first instinct was to waken my companion, that he too might see\r\nthem, but something made me hesitate—the sudden realization, probably,\r\nthat I should not welcome corroboration; and meanwhile I crouched there\r\nstaring in amazement with smarting eyes. I was wide awake. I remember\r\nsaying to myself that I was _not_ dreaming.\r\n\r\nThey first became properly visible, these huge figures, just within the\r\ntops of the bushes—immense, bronze-colored, moving, and wholly\r\nindependent of the swaying of the branches. I saw them plainly and\r\nnoted, now I came to examine them more calmly, that they were very much\r\nlarger than human, and indeed that something in their appearance\r\nproclaimed them to be _not human_ at all. Certainly they were not\r\nmerely the moving tracery of the branches against the moonlight. They\r\nshifted independently. They rose upwards in a continuous stream from\r\nearth to sky, vanishing utterly as soon as they reached the dark of the\r\nsky. They were interlaced one with another, making a great column, and\r\nI saw their limbs and huge bodies melting in and out of each other,\r\nforming this serpentine line that bent and swayed and twisted spirally\r\nwith the contortions of the wind-tossed trees. They were nude, fluid\r\nshapes, passing up the bushes, _within_ the leaves almost—rising up in\r\na living column into the heavens. Their faces I never could see.\r\nUnceasingly they poured upwards, swaying in great bending curves, with\r\na hue of dull bronze upon their skins.\r\n\r\nI stared, trying to force every atom of vision from my eyes. For a long\r\ntime I thought they _must_ every moment disappear and resolve\r\nthemselves into the movements of the branches and prove to be an\r\noptical illusion. I searched everywhere for a proof of reality, when\r\nall the while I understood quite well that the standard of reality had\r\nchanged. For the longer I looked the more certain I became that these\r\nfigures were real and living, though perhaps not according to the\r\nstandards that the camera and the biologist would insist upon.\r\n\r\nFar from feeling fear, I was possessed with a sense of awe and wonder\r\nsuch as I have never known. I seemed to be gazing at the personified\r\nelemental forces of this haunted and primeval region. Our intrusion had\r\nstirred the powers of the place into activity. It was we who were the\r\ncause of the disturbance, and my brain filled to bursting with stories\r\nand legends of the spirits and deities of places that have been\r\nacknowledged and worshipped by men in all ages of the world’s history.\r\nBut, before I could arrive at any possible explanation, something\r\nimpelled me to go farther out, and I crept forward on the sand and\r\nstood upright. I felt the ground still warm under my bare feet; the\r\nwind tore at my hair and face; and the sound of the river burst upon my\r\nears with a sudden roar. These things, I knew, were real, and proved\r\nthat my senses were acting normally. Yet the figures still rose from\r\nearth to heaven, silent, majestically, in a great spiral of grace and\r\nstrength that overwhelmed me at length with a genuine deep emotion of\r\nworship. I felt that I must fall down and worship—absolutely worship.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in another minute I might have done so, when a gust of wind\r\nswept against me with such force that it blew me sideways, and I nearly\r\nstumbled and fell. It seemed to shake the dream violently out of me. At\r\nleast it gave me another point of view somehow. The figures still\r\nremained, still ascended into heaven from the heart of the night, but\r\nmy reason at last began to assert itself. It must be a subjective\r\nexperience, I argued—none the less real for that, but still subjective.\r\nThe moonlight and the branches combined to work out these pictures upon\r\nthe mirror of my imagination, and for some reason I projected them\r\noutwards and made them appear objective. I knew this must be the case,\r\nof course. I took courage, and began to move forward across the open\r\npatches of sand. By Jove, though, was it all hallucination? Was it\r\nmerely subjective? Did not my reason argue in the old futile way from\r\nthe little standard of the known?\r\n\r\nI only know that great column of figures ascended darkly into the sky\r\nfor what seemed a very long period of time, and with a very complete\r\nmeasure of reality as most men are accustomed to gauge reality. Then\r\nsuddenly they were gone!\r\n\r\nAnd, once they were gone and the immediate wonder of their great\r\npresence had passed, fear came down upon me with a cold rush. The\r\nesoteric meaning of this lonely and haunted region suddenly flamed up\r\nwithin me, and I began to tremble dreadfully. I took a quick look\r\nround—a look of horror that came near to panic—calculating vainly ways\r\nof escape; and then, realizing how helpless I was to achieve anything\r\nreally effective, I crept back silently into the tent and lay down\r\nagain upon my sandy mattress, first lowering the door-curtain to shut\r\nout the sight of the willows in the moonlight, and then burying my head\r\nas deeply as possible beneath the blankets to deaden the sound of the\r\nterrifying wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs though further to convince me that I had not been dreaming, I\r\nremember that it was a long time before I fell again into a troubled\r\nand restless sleep; and even then only the upper crust of me slept, and\r\nunderneath there was something that never quite lost consciousness, but\r\nlay alert and on the watch.\r\n\r\nBut this second time I jumped up with a genuine start of terror. It was\r\nneither the wind nor the river that woke me, but the slow approach of\r\nsomething that caused the sleeping portion of me to grow smaller and\r\nsmaller till at last it vanished altogether, and I found myself sitting\r\nbolt upright—listening.\r\n\r\nOutside there was a sound of multitudinous little patterings. They had\r\nbeen coming, I was aware, for a long time, and in my sleep they had\r\nfirst become audible. I sat there nervously wide awake as though I had\r\nnot slept at all. It seemed to me that my breathing came with\r\ndifficulty, and that there was a great weight upon the surface of my\r\nbody. In spite of the hot night, I felt clammy with cold and shivered.\r\nSomething surely was pressing steadily against the sides of the tent\r\nand weighing down upon it from above. Was it the body of the wind? Was\r\nthis the pattering rain, the dripping of the leaves? The spray blown\r\nfrom the river by the wind and gathering in big drops? I thought\r\nquickly of a dozen things.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the explanation leaped into my mind: a bough from the\r\npoplar, the only large tree on the island, had fallen with the wind.\r\nStill half caught by the other branches, it would fall with the next\r\ngust and crush us, and meanwhile its leaves brushed and tapped upon the\r\ntight canvas surface of the tent. I raised a loose flap and rushed out,\r\ncalling to the Swede to follow.\r\n\r\nBut when I got out and stood upright I saw that the tent was free.\r\nThere was no hanging bough; there was no rain or spray; nothing\r\napproached.\r\n\r\nA cold, grey light filtered down through the bushes and lay on the\r\nfaintly gleaming sand. Stars still crowded the sky directly overhead,\r\nand the wind howled magnificently, but the fire no longer gave out any\r\nglow, and I saw the east reddening in streaks through the trees.\r\nSeveral hours must have passed since I stood there before watching the\r\nascending figures, and the memory of it now came back to me horribly,\r\nlike an evil dream. Oh, how tired it made me feel, that ceaseless\r\nraging wind! Yet, though the deep lassitude of a sleepless night was on\r\nme, my nerves were tingling with the activity of an equally tireless\r\napprehension, and all idea of repose was out of the question. The river\r\nI saw had risen further. Its thunder filled the air, and a fine spray\r\nmade itself felt through my thin sleeping shirt.\r\n\r\nYet nowhere did I discover the slightest evidence of anything to cause\r\nalarm. This deep, prolonged disturbance in my heart remained wholly\r\nunaccounted for.\r\n\r\nMy companion had not stirred when I called him, and there was no need\r\nto waken him now. I looked about me carefully, noting everything; the\r\nturned-over canoe; the yellow paddles—two of them, I’m certain; the\r\nprovision sack and the extra lantern hanging together from the tree;\r\nand, crowding everywhere about me, enveloping all, the willows, those\r\nendless, shaking willows. A bird uttered its morning cry, and a string\r\nof duck passed with whirring flight overhead in the twilight. The sand\r\nwhirled, dry and stinging, about my bare feet in the wind.\r\n\r\nI walked round the tent and then went out a little way into the bush,\r\nso that I could see across the river to the farther landscape, and the\r\nsame profound yet indefinable emotion of distress seized upon me again\r\nas I saw the interminable sea of bushes stretching to the horizon,\r\nlooking ghostly and unreal in the wan light of dawn. I walked softly\r\nhere and there, still puzzling over that odd sound of infinite\r\npattering, and of that pressure upon the tent that had wakened me. It\r\n_must_ have been the wind, I reflected—the wind bearing upon the loose,\r\nhot sand, driving the dry particles smartly against the taut canvas—the\r\nwind dropping heavily upon our fragile roof.\r\n\r\nYet all the time my nervousness and malaise increased appreciably.\r\n\r\nI crossed over to the farther shore and noted how the coast-line had\r\naltered in the night, and what masses of sand the river had torn away.\r\nI dipped my hands and feet into the cool current, and bathed my\r\nforehead. Already there was a glow of sunrise in the sky and the\r\nexquisite freshness of coming day. On my way back I passed purposely\r\nbeneath the very bushes where I had seen the column of figures rising\r\ninto the air, and midway among the clumps I suddenly found myself\r\novertaken by a sense of vast terror. From the shadows a large figure\r\nwent swiftly by. Someone passed me, as sure as ever man did….\r\n\r\nIt was a great staggering blow from the wind that helped me forward\r\nagain, and once out in the more open space, the sense of terror\r\ndiminished strangely. The winds were about and walking, I remember\r\nsaying to myself, for the winds often move like great presences under\r\nthe trees. And altogether the fear that hovered about me was such an\r\nunknown and immense kind of fear, so unlike anything I had ever felt\r\nbefore, that it woke a sense of awe and wonder in me that did much to\r\ncounteract its worst effects; and when I reached a high point in the\r\nmiddle of the island from which I could see the wide stretch of river,\r\ncrimson in the sunrise, the whole magical beauty of it all was so\r\noverpowering that a sort of wild yearning woke in me and almost brought\r\na cry up into the throat.\r\n\r\nBut this cry found no expression, for as my eyes wandered from the\r\nplain beyond to the island round me and noted our little tent half\r\nhidden among the willows, a dreadful discovery leaped out at me,\r\ncompared to which my terror of the walking winds seemed as nothing at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nFor a change, I thought, had somehow come about in the arrangement of\r\nthe landscape. It was not that my point of vantage gave me a different\r\nview, but that an alteration had apparently been effected in the\r\nrelation of the tent to the willows, and of the willows to the tent.\r\nSurely the bushes now crowded much closer—unnecessarily, unpleasantly\r\nclose. _They had moved nearer._\r\n\r\nCreeping with silent feet over the shifting sands, drawing\r\nimperceptibly nearer by soft, unhurried movements, the willows had come\r\ncloser during the night. But had the wind moved them, or had they moved\r\nof themselves? I recalled the sound of infinite small patterings and\r\nthe pressure upon the tent and upon my own heart that caused me to wake\r\nin terror. I swayed for a moment in the wind like a tree, finding it\r\nhard to keep my upright position on the sandy hillock. There was a\r\nsuggestion here of personal agency, of deliberate intention, of\r\naggressive hostility, and it terrified me into a sort of rigidity.\r\n\r\nThen the reaction followed quickly. The idea was so bizarre, so absurd,\r\nthat I felt inclined to laugh. But the laughter came no more readily\r\nthan the cry, for the knowledge that my mind was so receptive to such\r\ndangerous imaginings brought the additional terror that it was through\r\nour minds and not through our physical bodies that the attack would\r\ncome, and was coming.\r\n\r\nThe wind buffeted me about, and, very quickly it seemed, the sun came\r\nup over the horizon, for it was after four o’clock, and I must have\r\nstood on that little pinnacle of sand longer than I knew, afraid to\r\ncome down to close quarters with the willows. I returned quietly,\r\ncreepily, to the tent, first taking another exhaustive look round\r\nand—yes, I confess it—making a few measurements. I paced out on the\r\nwarm sand the distances between the willows and the tent, making a note\r\nof the shortest distance particularly.\r\n\r\nI crawled stealthily into my blankets. My companion, to all\r\nappearances, still slept soundly, and I was glad that this was so.\r\nProvided my experiences were not corroborated, I could find strength\r\nsomehow to deny them, perhaps. With the daylight I could persuade\r\nmyself that it was all a subjective hallucination, a fantasy of the\r\nnight, a projection of the excited imagination.\r\n\r\nNothing further came in to disturb me, and I fell asleep almost at\r\nonce, utterly exhausted, yet still in dread of hearing again that weird\r\nsound of multitudinous pattering, or of feeling the pressure upon my\r\nheart that had made it difficult to breathe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nThe sun was high in the heavens when my companion woke me from a heavy\r\nsleep and announced that the porridge was cooked and there was just\r\ntime to bathe. The grateful smell of frizzling bacon entered the tent\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n“River still rising,” he said, “and several islands out in mid-stream\r\nhave disappeared altogether. Our own island’s much smaller.”\r\n\r\n“Any wood left?” I asked sleepily.\r\n\r\n“The wood and the island will finish tomorrow in a dead heat,” he\r\nlaughed, “but there’s enough to last us till then.”\r\n\r\nI plunged in from the point of the island, which had indeed altered a\r\nlot in size and shape during the night, and was swept down in a moment\r\nto the landing-place opposite the tent. The water was icy, and the\r\nbanks flew by like the country from an express train. Bathing under\r\nsuch conditions was an exhilarating operation, and the terror of the\r\nnight seemed cleansed out of me by a process of evaporation in the\r\nbrain. The sun was blazing hot; not a cloud showed itself anywhere; the\r\nwind, however, had not abated one little jot.\r\n\r\nQuite suddenly then the implied meaning of the Swede’s words flashed\r\nacross me, showing that he no longer wished to leave post-haste, and\r\nhad changed his mind. “Enough to last till tomorrow”—he assumed we\r\nshould stay on the island another night. It struck me as odd. The night\r\nbefore he was so positive the other way. How had the change come about?\r\n\r\nGreat crumblings of the banks occurred at breakfast, with heavy\r\nsplashings and clouds of spray which the wind brought into our\r\nfrying-pan, and my fellow-traveler talked incessantly about the\r\ndifficulty the Vienna-Pesth steamers must have to find the channel in\r\nflood. But the state of his mind interested and impressed me far more\r\nthan the state of the river or the difficulties of the steamers. He had\r\nchanged somehow since the evening before. His manner was different—a\r\ntrifle excited, a trifle shy, with a sort of suspicion about his voice\r\nand gestures. I hardly know how to describe it now in cold blood, but\r\nat the time I remember being quite certain of one thing—that he had\r\nbecome frightened?\r\n\r\nHe ate very little breakfast, and for once omitted to smoke his pipe.\r\nHe had the map spread open beside him, and kept studying its markings.\r\n\r\n“We’d better get off sharp in an hour,” I said presently, feeling for\r\nan opening that must bring him indirectly to a partial confession at\r\nany rate. And his answer puzzled me uncomfortably: “Rather! If they’ll\r\nlet us.”\r\n\r\n“Who’ll let us? The elements?” I asked quickly, with affected\r\nindifference.\r\n\r\n“The powers of this awful place, whoever they are,” he replied, keeping\r\nhis eyes on the map. “The gods are here, if they are anywhere at all in\r\nthe world.”\r\n\r\n“The elements are always the true immortals,” I replied, laughing as\r\nnaturally as I could manage, yet knowing quite well that my face\r\nreflected my true feelings when he looked up gravely at me and spoke\r\nacross the smoke:\r\n\r\n“We shall be fortunate if we get away without further disaster.”\r\n\r\nThis was exactly what I had dreaded, and I screwed myself up to the\r\npoint of the direct question. It was like agreeing to allow the dentist\r\nto extract the tooth; it _had_ to come anyhow in the long run, and the\r\nrest was all pretence.\r\n\r\n“Further disaster! Why, what’s happened?”\r\n\r\n“For one thing—the steering paddle’s gone,” he said quietly.\r\n\r\n“The steering paddle gone!” I repeated, greatly excited, for this was\r\nour rudder, and the Danube in flood without a rudder was suicide. “But\r\nwhat—”\r\n\r\n“And there’s a tear in the bottom of the canoe,” he added, with a\r\ngenuine little tremor in his voice.\r\n\r\nI continued staring at him, able only to repeat the words in his face\r\nsomewhat foolishly. There, in the heat of the sun, and on this burning\r\nsand, I was aware of a freezing atmosphere descending round us. I got\r\nup to follow him, for he merely nodded his head gravely and led the way\r\ntowards the tent a few yards on the other side of the fireplace. The\r\ncanoe still lay there as I had last seen her in the night, ribs\r\nuppermost, the paddles, or rather, _the_ paddle, on the sand beside\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“There’s only one,” he said, stooping to pick it up. “And here’s the\r\nrent in the base-board.”\r\n\r\nIt was on the tip of my tongue to tell him that I had clearly noticed\r\n_two_ paddles a few hours before, but a second impulse made me think\r\nbetter of it, and I said nothing. I approached to see.\r\n\r\nThere was a long, finely made tear in the bottom of the canoe where a\r\nlittle slither of wood had been neatly taken clean out; it looked as if\r\nthe tooth of a sharp rock or snag had eaten down her length, and\r\ninvestigation showed that the hole went through. Had we launched out in\r\nher without observing it we must inevitably have foundered. At first\r\nthe water would have made the wood swell so as to close the hole, but\r\nonce out in mid-stream the water must have poured in, and the canoe,\r\nnever more than two inches above the surface, would have filled and\r\nsunk very rapidly.\r\n\r\n“There, you see an attempt to prepare a victim for the sacrifice,” I\r\nheard him saying, more to himself than to me, “two victims rather,” he\r\nadded as he bent over and ran his fingers along the slit.\r\n\r\nI began to whistle—a thing I always do unconsciously when utterly\r\nnonplussed—and purposely paid no attention to his words. I was\r\ndetermined to consider them foolish.\r\n\r\n“It wasn’t there last night,” he said presently, straightening up from\r\nhis examination and looking anywhere but at me.\r\n\r\n“We must have scratched her in landing, of course,” I stopped whistling\r\nto say. “The stones are very sharp.”\r\n\r\nI stopped abruptly, for at that moment he turned round and met my eye\r\nsquarely. I knew just as well as he did how impossible my explanation\r\nwas. There were no stones, to begin with.\r\n\r\n“And then there’s this to explain too,” he added quietly, handing me\r\nthe paddle and pointing to the blade.\r\n\r\nA new and curious emotion spread freezingly over me as I took and\r\nexamined it. The blade was scraped down all over, beautifully scraped,\r\nas though someone had sand-papered it with care, making it so thin that\r\nthe first vigorous stroke must have snapped it off at the elbow.\r\n\r\n“One of us walked in his sleep and did this thing,” I said feebly,\r\n“or—or it has been filed by the constant stream of sand particles blown\r\nagainst it by the wind, perhaps.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said the Swede, turning away, laughing a little, “you can explain\r\neverything.”\r\n\r\n“The same wind that caught the steering paddle and flung it so near the\r\nbank that it fell in with the next lump that crumbled,” I called out\r\nafter him, absolutely determined to find an explanation for everything\r\nhe showed me.\r\n\r\n“I see,” he shouted back, turning his head to look at me before\r\ndisappearing among the willow bushes.\r\n\r\nOnce alone with these perplexing evidences of personal agency, I think\r\nmy first thoughts took the form of “One of us must have done this\r\nthing, and it certainly was not I.” But my second thought decided how\r\nimpossible it was to suppose, under all the circumstances, that either\r\nof us had done it. That my companion, the trusted friend of a dozen\r\nsimilar expeditions, could have knowingly had a hand in it, was a\r\nsuggestion not to be entertained for a moment. Equally absurd seemed\r\nthe explanation that this imperturbable and densely practical nature\r\nhad suddenly become insane and was busied with insane purposes.\r\n\r\nYet the fact remained that what disturbed me most, and kept my fear\r\nactively alive even in this blaze of sunshine and wild beauty, was the\r\nclear certainty that some curious alteration had come about in his\r\n_mind_—that he was nervous, timid, suspicious, aware of goings on he\r\ndid not speak about, watching a series of secret and hitherto\r\nunmentionable events—waiting, in a word, for a climax that he expected,\r\nand, I thought, expected very soon. This grew up in my mind\r\nintuitively—I hardly knew how.\r\n\r\nI made a hurried examination of the tent and its surroundings, but the\r\nmeasurements of the night remained the same. There were deep hollows\r\nformed in the sand I now noticed for the first time, basin-shaped and\r\nof various depths and sizes, varying from that of a tea-cup to a large\r\nbowl. The wind, no doubt, was responsible for these miniature craters,\r\njust as it was for lifting the paddle and tossing it towards the water.\r\nThe rent in the canoe was the only thing that seemed quite\r\ninexplicable; and, after all, it _was_ conceivable that a sharp point\r\nhad caught it when we landed. The examination I made of the shore did\r\nnot assist this theory, but all the same I clung to it with that\r\ndiminishing portion of my intelligence which I called my “reason.” An\r\nexplanation of some kind was an absolute necessity, just as some\r\nworking explanation of the universe is necessary—however absurd—to the\r\nhappiness of every individual who seeks to do his duty in the world and\r\nface the problems of life. The simile seemed to me at the time an exact\r\nparallel.\r\n\r\nI at once set the pitch melting, and presently the Swede joined me at\r\nthe work, though under the best conditions in the world the canoe could\r\nnot be safe for traveling till the following day. I drew his attention\r\ncasually to the hollows in the sand.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, “I know. They’re all over the island. But _you_ can\r\nexplain them, no doubt!”\r\n\r\n“Wind, of course,” I answered without hesitation. “Have you never\r\nwatched those little whirlwinds in the street that twist and twirl\r\neverything into a circle? This sand’s loose enough to yield, that’s\r\nall.”\r\n\r\nHe made no reply, and we worked on in silence for a bit. I watched him\r\nsurreptitiously all the time, and I had an idea he was watching me. He\r\nseemed, too, to be always listening attentively to something I could\r\nnot hear, or perhaps for something that he expected to hear, for he\r\nkept turning about and staring into the bushes, and up into the sky,\r\nand out across the water where it was visible through the openings\r\namong the willows. Sometimes he even put his hand to his ear and held\r\nit there for several minutes. He said nothing to me, however, about it,\r\nand I asked no questions. And meanwhile, as he mended that torn canoe\r\nwith the skill and address of a red Indian, I was glad to notice his\r\nabsorption in the work, for there was a vague dread in my heart that he\r\nwould speak of the changed aspect of the willows. And, if he had\r\nnoticed _that_, my imagination could no longer be held a sufficient\r\nexplanation of it.\r\n\r\nAt length, after a long pause, he began to talk.\r\n\r\n“Queer thing,” he added in a hurried sort of voice, as though he wanted\r\nto say something and get it over. “Queer thing. I mean, about that\r\notter last night.”\r\n\r\nI had expected something so totally different that he caught me with\r\nsurprise, and I looked up sharply.\r\n\r\n“Shows how lonely this place is. Otters are awfully shy things—”\r\n\r\n“I don’t mean that, of course,” he interrupted. “I mean—do you\r\nthink—did you think it really was an otter?”\r\n\r\n“What else, in the name of Heaven, what else?”\r\n\r\n“You know, I saw it before you did, and at first it seemed—so _much_\r\nbigger than an otter.”\r\n\r\n“The sunset as you looked up-stream magnified it, or something,” I\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me absently a moment, as though his mind were busy with\r\nother thoughts.\r\n\r\n“It had such extraordinary yellow eyes,” he went on half to himself.\r\n\r\n“That was the sun too,” I laughed, a trifle boisterously. “I suppose\r\nyou’ll wonder next if that fellow in the boat—”\r\n\r\nI suddenly decided not to finish the sentence. He was in the act again\r\nof listening, turning his head to the wind, and something in the\r\nexpression of his face made me halt. The subject dropped, and we went\r\non with our caulking. Apparently he had not noticed my unfinished\r\nsentence. Five minutes later, however, he looked at me across the\r\ncanoe, the smoking pitch in his hand, his face exceedingly grave.\r\n\r\n“I _did_ rather wonder, if you want to know,” he said slowly, “what\r\nthat thing in the boat was. I remember thinking at the time it was not\r\na man. The whole business seemed to rise quite suddenly out of the\r\nwater.”\r\n\r\nI laughed again boisterously in his face, but this time there was\r\nimpatience, and a strain of anger too, in my feeling.\r\n\r\n“Look here now,” I cried, “this place is quite queer enough without\r\ngoing out of our way to imagine things! That boat was an ordinary boat,\r\nand the man in it was an ordinary man, and they were both going\r\ndown-stream as fast as they could lick. And that otter _was_ an otter,\r\nso don’t let’s play the fool about it!”\r\n\r\nHe looked steadily at me with the same grave expression. He was not in\r\nthe least annoyed. I took courage from his silence.\r\n\r\n“And, for Heaven’s sake,” I went on, “don’t keep pretending you hear\r\nthings, because it only gives me the jumps, and there’s nothing to hear\r\nbut the river and this cursed old thundering wind.”\r\n\r\n“You _fool!_” he answered in a low, shocked voice, “you utter fool.\r\nThat’s just the way all victims talk. As if you didn’t understand just\r\nas well as I do!” he sneered with scorn in his voice, and a sort of\r\nresignation. “The best thing you can do is to keep quiet and try to\r\nhold your mind as firm as possible. This feeble attempt at\r\nself-deception only makes the truth harder when you’re forced to meet\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nMy little effort was over, and I found nothing more to say, for I knew\r\nquite well his words were true, and that _I_ was the fool, not _he_. Up\r\nto a certain stage in the adventure he kept ahead of me easily, and I\r\nthink I felt annoyed to be out of it, to be thus proved less psychic,\r\nless sensitive than himself to these extraordinary happenings, and half\r\nignorant all the time of what was going on under my very nose. _He\r\nknew_ from the very beginning, apparently. But at the moment I wholly\r\nmissed the point of his words about the necessity of there being a\r\nvictim, and that we ourselves were destined to satisfy the want. I\r\ndropped all pretence thenceforward, but thenceforward likewise my fear\r\nincreased steadily to the climax.\r\n\r\n“But you’re quite right about one thing,” he added, before the subject\r\npassed, “and that is that we’re wiser not to talk about it, or even to\r\nthink about it, because what one _thinks_ finds expression in words,\r\nand what one _says_, happens.”\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, while the canoe dried and hardened, we spent trying to\r\nfish, testing the leak, collecting wood, and watching the enormous\r\nflood of rising water. Masses of driftwood swept near our shores\r\nsometimes, and we fished for them with long willow branches. The island\r\ngrew perceptibly smaller as the banks were torn away with great gulps\r\nand splashes. The weather kept brilliantly fine till about four\r\no’clock, and then for the first time for three days the wind showed\r\nsigns of abating. Clouds began to gather in the south-west, spreading\r\nthence slowly over the sky.\r\n\r\nThis lessening of the wind came as a great relief, for the incessant\r\nroaring, banging, and thundering had irritated our nerves. Yet the\r\nsilence that came about five o’clock with its sudden cessation was in a\r\nmanner quite as oppressive. The booming of the river had everything in\r\nits own way then; it filled the air with deep murmurs, more musical\r\nthan the wind noises, but infinitely more monotonous. The wind held\r\nmany notes, rising, falling always beating out some sort of great\r\nelemental tune; whereas the river’s song lay between three notes at\r\nmost—dull pedal notes, that held a lugubrious quality foreign to the\r\nwind, and somehow seemed to me, in my then nervous state, to sound\r\nwonderfully well the music of doom.\r\n\r\nIt was extraordinary, too, how the withdrawal suddenly of bright\r\nsunlight took everything out of the landscape that made for\r\ncheerfulness; and since this particular landscape had already managed\r\nto convey the suggestion of something sinister, the change of course\r\nwas all the more unwelcome and noticeable. For me, I know, the\r\ndarkening outlook became distinctly more alarming, and I found myself\r\nmore than once calculating how soon after sunset the full moon would\r\nget up in the east, and whether the gathering clouds would greatly\r\ninterfere with her lighting of the little island.\r\n\r\nWith this general hush of the wind—though it still indulged in\r\noccasional brief gusts—the river seemed to me to grow blacker, the\r\nwillows to stand more densely together. The latter, too, kept up a sort\r\nof independent movement of their own, rustling among themselves when no\r\nwind stirred, and shaking oddly from the roots upwards. When common\r\nobjects in this way be come charged with the suggestion of horror, they\r\nstimulate the imagination far more than things of unusual appearance;\r\nand these bushes, crowding huddled about us, assumed for me in the\r\ndarkness a bizarre _grotesquerie_ of appearance that lent to them\r\nsomehow the aspect of purposeful and living creatures. Their very\r\nordinariness, I felt, masked what was malignant and hostile to us. The\r\nforces of the region drew nearer with the coming of night. They were\r\nfocusing upon our island, and more particularly upon ourselves. For\r\nthus, somehow, in the terms of the imagination, did my really\r\nindescribable sensations in this extraordinary place present\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nI had slept a good deal in the early afternoon, and had thus recovered\r\nsomewhat from the exhaustion of a disturbed night, but this only served\r\napparently to render me more susceptible than before to the obsessing\r\nspell of the haunting. I fought against it, laughing at my feelings as\r\nabsurd and childish, with very obvious physiological explanations, yet,\r\nin spite of every effort, they gained in strength upon me so that I\r\ndreaded the night as a child lost in a forest must dread the approach\r\nof darkness.\r\n\r\nThe canoe we had carefully covered with a waterproof sheet during the\r\nday, and the one remaining paddle had been securely tied by the Swede\r\nto the base of a tree, lest the wind should rob us of that too. From\r\nfive o’clock onwards I busied myself with the stew-pot and preparations\r\nfor dinner, it being my turn to cook that night. We had potatoes,\r\nonions, bits of bacon fat to add flavor, and a general thick residue\r\nfrom former stews at the bottom of the pot; with black bread broken up\r\ninto it the result was most excellent, and it was followed by a stew of\r\nplums with sugar and a brew of strong tea with dried milk. A good pile\r\nof wood lay close at hand, and the absence of wind made my duties easy.\r\nMy companion sat lazily watching me, dividing his attentions between\r\ncleaning his pipe and giving useless advice—an admitted privilege of\r\nthe off-duty man. He had been very quiet all the afternoon, engaged in\r\nre-caulking the canoe, strengthening the tent ropes, and fishing for\r\ndriftwood while I slept. No more talk about undesirable things had\r\npassed between us, and I think his only remarks had to do with the\r\ngradual destruction of the island, which he declared was not fully a\r\nthird smaller than when we first landed.\r\n\r\nThe pot had just begun to bubble when I heard his voice calling to me\r\nfrom the bank, where he had wandered away without my noticing. I ran\r\nup.\r\n\r\n“Come and listen,” he said, “and see what you make of it.” He held his\r\nhand cupwise to his ear, as so often before.\r\n\r\n“_Now_ do you hear anything?” he asked, watching me curiously.\r\n\r\nWe stood there, listening attentively together. At first I heard only\r\nthe deep note of the water and the hissings rising from its turbulent\r\nsurface. The willows, for once, were motionless and silent. Then a\r\nsound began to reach my ears faintly, a peculiar sound—something like\r\nthe humming of a distant gong. It seemed to come across to us in the\r\ndarkness from the waste of swamps and willows opposite. It was repeated\r\nat regular intervals, but it was certainly neither the sound of a bell\r\nnor the hooting of a distant steamer. I can liken it to nothing so much\r\nas to the sound of an immense gong, suspended far up in the sky,\r\nrepeating incessantly its muffled metallic note, soft and musical, as\r\nit was repeatedly struck. My heart quickened as I listened.\r\n\r\n“I’ve heard it all day,” said my companion. “While you slept this\r\nafternoon it came all round the island. I hunted it down, but could\r\nnever get near enough to see—to localize it correctly. Sometimes it was\r\noverhead, and sometimes it seemed under the water. Once or twice, too,\r\nI could have sworn it was not outside at all, but _within myself_—you\r\nknow—the way a sound in the fourth dimension is supposed to come.”\r\n\r\nI was too much puzzled to pay much attention to his words. I listened\r\ncarefully, striving to associate it with any known familiar sound I\r\ncould think of, but without success. It changed in the direction, too,\r\ncoming nearer, and then sinking utterly away into remote distance. I\r\ncannot say that it was ominous in quality, because to me it seemed\r\ndistinctly musical, yet I must admit it set going a distressing feeling\r\nthat made me wish I had never heard it.\r\n\r\n“The wind blowing in those sand-funnels,” I said determined to find an\r\nexplanation, “or the bushes rubbing together after the storm perhaps.”\r\n\r\n“It comes off the whole swamp,” my friend answered. “It comes from\r\neverywhere at once.” He ignored my explanations. “It comes from the\r\nwillow bushes somehow—”\r\n\r\n“But now the wind has dropped,” I objected. “The willows can hardly\r\nmake a noise by themselves, can they?”\r\n\r\nHis answer frightened me, first because I had dreaded it, and secondly,\r\nbecause I knew intuitively it was true.\r\n\r\n“It is _because_ the wind has dropped we now hear it. It was drowned\r\nbefore. It is the cry, I believe, of the—”\r\n\r\nI dashed back to my fire, warned by the sound of bubbling that the stew\r\nwas in danger, but determined at the same time to escape further\r\nconversation. I was resolute, if possible, to avoid the exchanging of\r\nviews. I dreaded, too, that he would begin about the gods, or the\r\nelemental forces, or something else disquieting, and I wanted to keep\r\nmyself well in hand for what might happen later. There was another\r\nnight to be faced before we escaped from this distressing place, and\r\nthere was no knowing yet what it might bring forth.\r\n\r\n“Come and cut up bread for the pot,” I called to him, vigorously\r\nstirring the appetizing mixture. That stew-pot held sanity for us both,\r\nand the thought made me laugh.\r\n\r\nHe came over slowly and took the provision sack from the tree, fumbling\r\nin its mysterious depths, and then emptying the entire contents upon\r\nthe ground-sheet at his feet.\r\n\r\n“Hurry up!” I cried; “it’s boiling.”\r\n\r\nThe Swede burst out into a roar of laughter that startled me. It was\r\nforced laughter, not artificial exactly, but mirthless.\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing here!” he shouted, holding his sides.\r\n\r\n“Bread, I mean.”\r\n\r\n“It’s gone. There is no bread. They’ve taken it!”\r\n\r\nI dropped the long spoon and ran up. Everything the sack had contained\r\nlay upon the ground-sheet, but there was no loaf.\r\n\r\nThe whole dead weight of my growing fear fell upon me and shook me.\r\nThen I burst out laughing too. It was the only thing to do: and the\r\nsound of my laughter also made me understand his. The stain of\r\npsychical pressure caused it—this explosion of unnatural laughter in\r\nboth of us; it was an effort of repressed forces to seek relief; it was\r\na temporary safety-valve. And with both of us it ceased quite suddenly.\r\n\r\n“How criminally stupid of me!” I cried, still determined to be\r\nconsistent and find an explanation. “I clean forgot to buy a loaf at\r\nPressburg. That chattering woman put everything out of my head, and I\r\nmust have left it lying on the counter or—”\r\n\r\n“The oatmeal, too, is much less than it was this morning,” the Swede\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\nWhy in the world need he draw attention to it? I thought angrily.\r\n\r\n“There’s enough for tomorrow,” I said, stirring vigorously, “and we can\r\nget lots more at Komorn or Gran. In twenty-four hours we shall be miles\r\nfrom here.”\r\n\r\n“I hope so—to God,” he muttered, putting the things back into the sack,\r\n“unless we’re claimed first as victims for the sacrifice,” he added\r\nwith a foolish laugh. He dragged the sack into the tent, for safety’s\r\nsake, I suppose, and I heard him mumbling to himself, but so\r\nindistinctly that it seemed quite natural for me to ignore his words.\r\n\r\nOur meal was beyond question a gloomy one, and we ate it almost in\r\nsilence, avoiding one another’s eyes, and keeping the fire bright. Then\r\nwe washed up and prepared for the night, and, once smoking, our minds\r\nunoccupied with any definite duties, the apprehension I had felt all\r\nday long became more and more acute. It was not then active fear, I\r\nthink, but the very vagueness of its origin distressed me far more that\r\nif I had been able to ticket and face it squarely. The curious sound I\r\nhave likened to the note of a gong became now almost incessant, and\r\nfilled the stillness of the night with a faint, continuous ringing\r\nrather than a series of distinct notes. At one time it was behind and\r\nat another time in front of us. Sometimes I fancied it came from the\r\nbushes on our left, and then again from the clumps on our right. More\r\noften it hovered directly overhead like the whirring of wings. It was\r\nreally everywhere at once, behind, in front, at our sides and over our\r\nheads, completely surrounding us. The sound really defies description.\r\nBut nothing within my knowledge is like that ceaseless muffled humming\r\nrising off the deserted world of swamps and willows.\r\n\r\nWe sat smoking in comparative silence, the strain growing every minute\r\ngreater. The worst feature of the situation seemed to me that we did\r\nnot know what to expect, and could therefore make no sort of\r\npreparation by way of defense. We could anticipate nothing. My\r\nexplanations made in the sunshine, moreover, now came to haunt me with\r\ntheir foolish and wholly unsatisfactory nature, and it was more and\r\nmore clear to us that some kind of plain talk with my companion was\r\ninevitable, whether I liked it or not. After all, we had to spend the\r\nnight together, and to sleep in the same tent side by side. I saw that\r\nI could not get along much longer without the support of his mind, and\r\nfor that, of course, plain talk was imperative. As long as possible,\r\nhowever, I postponed this little climax, and tried to ignore or laugh\r\nat the occasional sentences he flung into the emptiness.\r\n\r\nSome of these sentences, moreover, were confoundedly disquieting to me,\r\ncoming as they did to corroborate much that I felt myself;\r\ncorroboration, too—which made it so much more convincing—from a totally\r\ndifferent point of view. He composed such curious sentences, and hurled\r\nthem at me in such an inconsequential sort of way, as though his main\r\nline of thought was secret to himself, and these fragments were mere\r\nbits he found it impossible to digest. He got rid of them by uttering\r\nthem. Speech relieved him. It was like being sick.\r\n\r\n“There are things about us, I’m sure, that make for disorder,\r\ndisintegration, destruction, our destruction,” he said once, while the\r\nfire blazed between us. “We’ve strayed out of a safe line somewhere.”\r\n\r\nAnd, another time, when the gong sounds had come nearer, ringing much\r\nlouder than before, and directly over our heads, he said as though\r\ntalking to himself:\r\n\r\n“I don’t think a gramophone would show any record of that. The sound\r\ndoesn’t come to me by the ears at all. The vibrations reach me in\r\nanother manner altogether, and seem to be within me, which is precisely\r\nhow a fourth dimensional sound might be supposed to make itself heard.”\r\n\r\nI purposely made no reply to this, but I sat up a little closer to the\r\nfire and peered about me into the darkness. The clouds were massed all\r\nover the sky, and no trace of moonlight came through. Very still, too,\r\neverything was, so that the river and the frogs had things all their\r\nown way.\r\n\r\n“It has that about it,” he went on, “which is utterly out of common\r\nexperience. It is _unknown_. Only one thing describes it really; it is\r\na non-human sound; I mean a sound outside humanity.”\r\n\r\nHaving rid himself of this indigestible morsel, he lay quiet for a\r\ntime, but he had so admirably expressed my own feeling that it was a\r\nrelief to have the thought out, and to have confined it by the\r\nlimitation of words from dangerous wandering to and fro in the mind.\r\n\r\nThe solitude of that Danube camping-place, can I ever forget it? The\r\nfeeling of being utterly alone on an empty planet! My thoughts ran\r\nincessantly upon cities and the haunts of men. I would have given my\r\nsoul, as the saying is, for the “feel” of those Bavarian villages we\r\nhad passed through by the score; for the normal, human commonplaces;\r\npeasants drinking beer, tables beneath the trees, hot sunshine, and a\r\nruined castle on the rocks behind the red-roofed church. Even the\r\ntourists would have been welcome.\r\n\r\nYet what I felt of dread was no ordinary ghostly fear. It was\r\ninfinitely greater, stranger, and seemed to arise from some dim\r\nancestral sense of terror more profoundly disturbing than anything I\r\nhad known or dreamed of. We had “strayed,” as the Swede put it, into\r\nsome region or some set of conditions where the risks were great, yet\r\nunintelligible to us; where the frontiers of some unknown world lay\r\nclose about us. It was a spot held by the dwellers in some outer space,\r\na sort of peep-hole whence they could spy upon the earth, themselves\r\nunseen, a point where the veil between had worn a little thin. As the\r\nfinal result of too long a sojourn here, we should be carried over the\r\nborder and deprived of what we called “our lives,” yet by mental, not\r\nphysical, processes. In that sense, as he said, we should be the\r\nvictims of our adventure—a sacrifice.\r\n\r\nIt took us in different fashion, each according to the measure of his\r\nsensitiveness and powers of resistance. I translated it vaguely into a\r\npersonification of the mightily disturbed elements, investing them with\r\nthe horror of a deliberate and malefic purpose, resentful of our\r\naudacious intrusion into their breeding-place; whereas my friend threw\r\nit into the unoriginal form at first of a trespass on some ancient\r\nshrine, some place where the old gods still held sway, where the\r\nemotional forces of former worshippers still clung, and the ancestral\r\nportion of him yielded to the old pagan spell.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, here was a place unpolluted by men, kept clean by the\r\nwinds from coarsening human influences, a place where spiritual\r\nagencies were within reach and aggressive. Never, before or since, have\r\nI been so attacked by indescribable suggestions of a “beyond region,”\r\nof another scheme of life, another revolution not parallel to the\r\nhuman. And in the end our minds would succumb under the weight of the\r\nawful spell, and we should be drawn across the frontier into _their_\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nSmall things testified to the amazing influence of the place, and now\r\nin the silence round the fire they allowed themselves to be noted by\r\nthe mind. The very atmosphere had proved itself a magnifying medium to\r\ndistort every indication: the otter rolling in the current, the\r\nhurrying boatman making signs, the shifting willows, one and all had\r\nbeen robbed of its natural character, and revealed in something of its\r\nother aspect—as it existed across the border to that other region. And\r\nthis changed aspect I felt was now not merely to me, but to the race.\r\nThe whole experience whose verge we touched was unknown to humanity at\r\nall. It was a new order of experience, and in the true sense of the\r\nword _unearthly_.\r\n\r\n“It’s the deliberate, calculating purpose that reduces one’s courage to\r\nzero,” the Swede said suddenly, as if he had been actually following my\r\nthoughts. “Otherwise imagination might count for much. But the paddle,\r\nthe canoe, the lessening food—”\r\n\r\n“Haven’t I explained all that once?” I interrupted viciously.\r\n\r\n“You have,” he answered dryly; “you have indeed.”\r\n\r\nHe made other remarks too, as usual, about what he called the “plain\r\ndetermination to provide a victim”; but, having now arranged my\r\nthoughts better, I recognized that this was simply the cry of his\r\nfrightened soul against the knowledge that he was being attacked in a\r\nvital part, and that he would be somehow taken or destroyed. The\r\nsituation called for a courage and calmness of reasoning that neither\r\nof us could compass, and I have never before been so clearly conscious\r\nof two persons in me—the one that explained everything, and the other\r\nthat laughed at such foolish explanations, yet was horribly afraid.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the pitchy night the fire died down and the wood pile\r\ngrew small. Neither of us moved to replenish the stock, and the\r\ndarkness consequently came up very close to our faces. A few feet\r\nbeyond the circle of firelight it was inky black. Occasionally a stray\r\npuff of wind set the willows shivering about us, but apart from this\r\nnot very welcome sound a deep and depressing silence reigned, broken\r\nonly by the gurgling of the river and the humming in the air overhead.\r\n\r\nWe both missed, I think, the shouting company of the winds.\r\n\r\nAt length, at a moment when a stray puff prolonged itself as though the\r\nwind were about to rise again, I reached the point for me of\r\nsaturation, the point where it was absolutely necessary to find relief\r\nin plain speech, or else to betray myself by some hysterical\r\nextravagance that must have been far worse in its effect upon both of\r\nus. I kicked the fire into a blaze, and turned to my companion\r\nabruptly. He looked up with a start.\r\n\r\n“I can’t disguise it any longer,” I said; “I don’t like this place, and\r\nthe darkness, and the noises, and the awful feelings I get. There’s\r\nsomething here that beats me utterly. I’m in a blue funk, and that’s\r\nthe plain truth. If the other shore was—different, I swear I’d be\r\ninclined to swim for it!”\r\n\r\nThe Swede’s face turned very white beneath the deep tan of sun and\r\nwind. He stared straight at me and answered quietly, but his voice\r\nbetrayed his huge excitement by its unnatural calmness. For the moment,\r\nat any rate, he was the strong man of the two. He was more phlegmatic,\r\nfor one thing.\r\n\r\n“It’s not a physical condition we can escape from by running away,” he\r\nreplied, in the tone of a doctor diagnosing some grave disease; “we\r\nmust sit tight and wait. There are forces close here that could kill a\r\nherd of elephants in a second as easily as you or I could squash a fly.\r\nOur only chance is to keep perfectly still. Our insignificance perhaps\r\nmay save us.”\r\n\r\nI put a dozen questions into my expression of face, but found no words.\r\nIt was precisely like listening to an accurate description of a disease\r\nwhose symptoms had puzzled me.\r\n\r\n“I mean that so far, although aware of our disturbing presence, they\r\nhave not _found_ us—not ‘located’ us, as the Americans say,” he went\r\non. “They’re blundering about like men hunting for a leak of gas. The\r\npaddle and canoe and provisions prove that. I think they _feel_ us, but\r\ncannot actually see us. We must keep our minds quiet—it’s our minds\r\nthey feel. We must control our thoughts, or it’s all up with us.”\r\n\r\n“Death, you mean?” I stammered, icy with the horror of his suggestion.\r\n\r\n“Worse—by far,” he said. “Death, according to one’s belief, means\r\neither annihilation or release from the limitations of the senses, but\r\nit involves no change of character. _You_ don’t suddenly alter just\r\nbecause the body’s gone. But this means a radical alteration, a\r\ncomplete change, a horrible loss of oneself by substitution—far worse\r\nthan death, and not even annihilation. We happen to have camped in a\r\nspot where their region touches ours, where the veil between has worn\r\nthin”—horrors! he was using my very own phrase, my actual words—“so\r\nthat they are aware of our being in their neighborhood.”\r\n\r\n“But _who_ are aware?” I asked.\r\n\r\nI forgot the shaking of the willows in the windless calm, the humming\r\noverhead, everything except that I was waiting for an answer that I\r\ndreaded more than I can possibly explain.\r\n\r\nHe lowered his voice at once to reply, leaning forward a little over\r\nthe fire, an indefinable change in his face that made me avoid his eyes\r\nand look down upon the ground.\r\n\r\n“All my life,” he said, “I have been strangely, vividly conscious of\r\nanother region—not far removed from our own world in one sense, yet\r\nwholly different in kind—where great things go on unceasingly, where\r\nimmense and terrible personalities hurry by, intent on vast purposes\r\ncompared to which earthly affairs, the rise and fall of nations, the\r\ndestinies of empires, the fate of armies and continents, are all as\r\ndust in the balance; vast purposes, I mean, that deal directly with the\r\nsoul, and not indirectly with mere expressions of the soul—”\r\n\r\n“I suggest just now—” I began, seeking to stop him, feeling as though I\r\nwas face to face with a madman. But he instantly overbore me with his\r\ntorrent that _had_ to come.\r\n\r\n“You think,” he said, “it is the spirit of the elements, and I thought\r\nperhaps it was the old gods. But I tell you now it is—_neither_. These\r\nwould be comprehensible entities, for they have relations with men,\r\ndepending upon them for worship or sacrifice, whereas these beings who\r\nare now about us have absolutely nothing to do with mankind, and it is\r\nmere chance that their space happens just at this spot to touch our\r\nown.”\r\n\r\nThe mere conception, which his words somehow made so convincing, as I\r\nlistened to them there in the dark stillness of that lonely island, set\r\nme shaking a little all over. I found it impossible to control my\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\n“And what do you propose?” I began again.\r\n\r\n“A sacrifice, a victim, might save us by distracting them until we\r\ncould get away,” he went on, “just as the wolves stop to devour the\r\ndogs and give the sleigh another start. But—I see no chance of any\r\nother victim now.”\r\n\r\nI stared blankly at him. The gleam in his eye was dreadful. Presently\r\nhe continued.\r\n\r\n“It’s the willows, of course. The willows _mask_ the others, but the\r\nothers are feeling about for us. If we let our minds betray our fear,\r\nwe’re lost, lost utterly.” He looked at me with an expression so calm,\r\nso determined, so sincere, that I no longer had any doubts as to his\r\nsanity. He was as sane as any man ever was. “If we can hold out through\r\nthe night,” he added, “we may get off in the daylight unnoticed, or\r\nrather, _undiscovered_.”\r\n\r\n“But you really think a sacrifice would—”\r\n\r\nThat gong-like humming came down very close over our heads as I spoke,\r\nbut it was my friend’s scared face that really stopped my mouth.\r\n\r\n“Hush!” he whispered, holding up his hand. “Do not mention them more\r\nthan you can help. Do not refer to them _by name_. To name is to\r\nreveal; it is the inevitable clue, and our only hope lies in ignoring\r\nthem, in order that they may ignore us.”\r\n\r\n“Even in thought?” He was extraordinarily agitated.\r\n\r\n“Especially in thought. Our thoughts make spirals in their world. We\r\nmust keep them _out of our minds_ at all costs if possible.”\r\n\r\nI raked the fire together to prevent the darkness having everything its\r\nown way. I never longed for the sun as I longed for it then in the\r\nawful blackness of that summer night.\r\n\r\n“Were you awake all last night?” he went on suddenly.\r\n\r\n“I slept badly a little after dawn,” I replied evasively, trying to\r\nfollow his instructions, which I knew instinctively were true, “but the\r\nwind, of course—”\r\n\r\n“I know. But the wind won’t account for all the noises.”\r\n\r\n“Then you heard it too?”\r\n\r\n“The multiplying countless little footsteps I heard,” he said, adding,\r\nafter a moment’s hesitation, “and that other sound—”\r\n\r\n“You mean above the tent, and the pressing down upon us of something\r\ntremendous, gigantic?”\r\n\r\nHe nodded significantly.\r\n\r\n“It was like the beginning of a sort of inner suffocation?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Partly, yes. It seemed to me that the weight of the atmosphere had\r\nbeen altered—had increased enormously, so that we should have been\r\ncrushed.”\r\n\r\n“And that,” I went on, determined to have it all out, pointing upwards\r\nwhere the gong-like note hummed ceaselessly, rising and falling like\r\nwind. “What do you make of that?”\r\n\r\n“It’s _their_ sound,” he whispered gravely. “It’s the sound of their\r\nworld, the humming in their region. The division here is so thin that\r\nit leaks through somehow. But, if you listen carefully, you’ll find\r\nit’s not above so much as around us. It’s in the willows. It’s the\r\nwillows themselves humming, because here the willows have been made\r\nsymbols of the forces that are against us.”\r\n\r\nI could not follow exactly what he meant by this, yet the thought and\r\nidea in my mind were beyond question the thought and idea in his. I\r\nrealized what he realized, only with less power of analysis than his.\r\nIt was on the tip of my tongue to tell him at last about my\r\nhallucination of the ascending figures and the moving bushes, when he\r\nsuddenly thrust his face again close into mine across the firelight and\r\nbegan to speak in a very earnest whisper. He amazed me by his calmness\r\nand pluck, his apparent control of the situation. This man I had for\r\nyears deemed unimaginative, stolid!\r\n\r\n“Now listen,” he said. “The only thing for us to do is to go on as\r\nthough nothing had happened, follow our usual habits, go to bed, and so\r\nforth; pretend we feel nothing and notice nothing. It is a question\r\nwholly of the mind, and the less we think about them the better our\r\nchance of escape. Above all, don’t _think_, for what you think\r\nhappens!”\r\n\r\n“All right,” I managed to reply, simply breathless with his words and\r\nthe strangeness of it all; “all right, I’ll try, but tell me one more\r\nthing first. Tell me what you make of those hollows in the ground all\r\nabout us, those sand-funnels?”\r\n\r\n“No!” he cried, forgetting to whisper in his excitement. “I dare not,\r\nsimply dare not, put the thought into words. If you have not guessed I\r\nam glad. Don’t try to. _They_ have put it into my mind; try your\r\nhardest to prevent their putting it into yours.”\r\n\r\nHe sank his voice again to a whisper before he finished, and I did not\r\npress him to explain. There was already just about as much horror in me\r\nas I could hold. The conversation came to an end, and we smoked our\r\npipes busily in silence.\r\n\r\nThen something happened, something unimportant apparently, as the way\r\nis when the nerves are in a very great state of tension, and this small\r\nthing for a brief space gave me an entirely different point of view. I\r\nchanced to look down at my sand-shoe—the sort we used for the canoe—and\r\nsomething to do with the hole at the toe suddenly recalled to me the\r\nLondon shop where I had bought them, the difficulty the man had in\r\nfitting me, and other details of the uninteresting but practical\r\noperation. At once, in its train, followed a wholesome view of the\r\nmodern skeptical world I was accustomed to move in at home. I thought\r\nof roast beef, and ale, motor-cars, policemen, brass bands, and a dozen\r\nother things that proclaimed the soul of ordinariness or utility. The\r\neffect was immediate and astonishing even to myself. Psychologically, I\r\nsuppose, it was simply a sudden and violent reaction after the strain\r\nof living in an atmosphere of things that to the normal consciousness\r\nmust seem impossible and incredible. But, whatever the cause, it\r\nmomentarily lifted the spell from my heart, and left me for the short\r\nspace of a minute feeling free and utterly unafraid. I looked up at my\r\nfriend opposite.\r\n\r\n“You damned old pagan!” I cried, laughing aloud in his face. “You\r\nimaginative idiot! You superstitious idolater! You—”\r\n\r\nI stopped in the middle, seized anew by the old horror. I tried to\r\nsmother the sound of my voice as something sacrilegious. The Swede, of\r\ncourse, heard it too—the strange cry overhead in the darkness—and that\r\nsudden drop in the air as though something had come nearer.\r\n\r\nHe had turned ashen white under the tan. He stood bolt upright in front\r\nof the fire, stiff as a rod, staring at me.\r\n\r\n“After that,” he said in a sort of helpless, frantic way, “we must go!\r\nWe can’t stay now; we must strike camp this very instant and go on—down\r\nthe river.”\r\n\r\nHe was talking, I saw, quite wildly, his words dictated by abject\r\nterror—the terror he had resisted so long, but which had caught him at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n“In the dark?” I exclaimed, shaking with fear after my hysterical\r\noutburst, but still realizing our position better than he did. “Sheer\r\nmadness! The river’s in flood, and we’ve only got a single paddle.\r\nBesides, we only go deeper into their country! There’s nothing ahead\r\nfor fifty miles but willows, willows, willows!”\r\n\r\nHe sat down again in a state of semi-collapse. The positions, by one of\r\nthose kaleidoscopic changes nature loves, were suddenly reversed, and\r\nthe control of our forces passed over into my hands. His mind at last\r\nhad reached the point where it was beginning to weaken.\r\n\r\n“What on earth possessed you to do such a thing?” he whispered with the\r\nawe of genuine terror in his voice and face.\r\n\r\nI crossed round to his side of the fire. I took both his hands in mine,\r\nkneeling down beside him and looking straight into his frightened eyes.\r\n\r\n“We’ll make one more blaze,” I said firmly, “and then turn in for the\r\nnight. At sunrise we’ll be off full speed for Komorn. Now, pull\r\nyourself together a bit, and remember your own advice about _not\r\nthinking fear!_”\r\n\r\nHe said no more, and I saw that he would agree and obey. In some\r\nmeasure, too, it was a sort of relief to get up and make an excursion\r\ninto the darkness for more wood. We kept close together, almost\r\ntouching, groping among the bushes and along the bank. The humming\r\noverhead never ceased, but seemed to me to grow louder as we increased\r\nour distance from the fire. It was shivery work!\r\n\r\nWe were grubbing away in the middle of a thickish clump of willows\r\nwhere some driftwood from a former flood had caught high among the\r\nbranches, when my body was seized in a grip that made me half drop upon\r\nthe sand. It was the Swede. He had fallen against me, and was clutching\r\nme for support. I heard his breath coming and going in short gasps.\r\n\r\n“Look! By my soul!” he whispered, and for the first time in my\r\nexperience I knew what it was to hear tears of terror in a human voice.\r\nHe was pointing to the fire, some fifty feet away. I followed the\r\ndirection of his finger, and I swear my heart missed a beat.\r\n\r\nThere, in front of the dim glow, _something was moving_.\r\n\r\nI saw it through a veil that hung before my eyes like the gauze\r\ndrop-curtain used at the back of a theater—hazily a little. It was\r\nneither a human figure nor an animal. To me it gave the strange\r\nimpression of being as large as several animals grouped together, like\r\nhorses, two or three, moving slowly. The Swede, too, got a similar\r\nresult, though expressing it differently, for he thought it was shaped\r\nand sized like a clump of willow bushes, rounded at the top, and moving\r\nall over upon its surface—“coiling upon itself like smoke,” he said\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n“I watched it settle downwards through the bushes,” he sobbed at me.\r\n“Look, by God! It’s coming this way! Oh, oh!”—he gave a kind of\r\nwhistling cry. “_They’ve found us._”\r\n\r\nI gave one terrified glance, which just enabled me to see that the\r\nshadowy form was swinging towards us through the bushes, and then I\r\ncollapsed backwards with a crash into the branches. These failed, of\r\ncourse, to support my weight, so that with the Swede on top of me we\r\nfell in a struggling heap upon the sand. I really hardly knew what was\r\nhappening. I was conscious only of a sort of enveloping sensation of\r\nicy fear that plucked the nerves out of their fleshly covering, twisted\r\nthem this way and that, and replaced them quivering. My eyes were\r\ntightly shut; something in my throat choked me; a feeling that my\r\nconsciousness was expanding, extending out into space, swiftly gave way\r\nto another feeling that I was losing it altogether, and about to die.\r\n\r\nAn acute spasm of pain passed through me, and I was aware that the\r\nSwede had hold of me in such a way that he hurt me abominably. It was\r\nthe way he caught at me in falling.\r\n\r\nBut it was the pain, he declared afterwards, that saved me; it caused\r\nme to _forget them_ and think of something else at the very instant\r\nwhen they were about to find me. It concealed my mind from them at the\r\nmoment of discovery, yet just in time to evade their terrible seizing\r\nof me. He himself, he says, actually swooned at the same moment, and\r\nthat was what saved him.\r\n\r\nI only know that at a later date, how long or short is impossible to\r\nsay, I found myself scrambling up out of the slippery network of willow\r\nbranches, and saw my companion standing in front of me holding out a\r\nhand to assist me. I stared at him in a dazed way, rubbing the arm he\r\nhad twisted for me. Nothing came to me to say, somehow.\r\n\r\n“I lost consciousness for a moment or two,” I heard him say. “That’s\r\nwhat saved me. It made me stop thinking about them.”\r\n\r\n“You nearly broke my arm in two,” I said, uttering my only connected\r\nthought at the moment. A numbness came over me.\r\n\r\n“That’s what saved _you!_” he replied. “Between us, we’ve managed to\r\nset them off on a false tack somewhere. The humming has ceased. It’s\r\ngone—for the moment at any rate!”\r\n\r\nA wave of hysterical laughter seized me again, and this time spread to\r\nmy friend too—great healing gusts of shaking laughter that brought a\r\ntremendous sense of relief in their train. We made our way back to the\r\nfire and put the wood on so that it blazed at once. Then we saw that\r\nthe tent had fallen over and lay in a tangled heap upon the ground.\r\n\r\nWe picked it up, and during the process tripped more than once and\r\ncaught our feet in sand.\r\n\r\n“It’s those sand-funnels,” exclaimed the Swede, when the tent was up\r\nagain and the firelight lit up the ground for several yards about us.\r\n“And look at the size of them!”\r\n\r\nAll round the tent and about the fireplace where we had seen the moving\r\nshadows there were deep funnel-shaped hollows in the sand, exactly\r\nsimilar to the ones we had already found over the island, only far\r\nbigger and deeper, beautifully formed, and wide enough in some\r\ninstances to admit the whole of my foot and leg.\r\n\r\nNeither of us said a word. We both knew that sleep was the safest thing\r\nwe could do, and to bed we went accordingly without further delay,\r\nhaving first thrown sand on the fire and taken the provision sack and\r\nthe paddle inside the tent with us. The canoe, too, we propped in such\r\na way at the end of the tent that our feet touched it, and the least\r\nmotion would disturb and wake us.\r\n\r\nIn case of emergency, too, we again went to bed in our clothes, ready\r\nfor a sudden start.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was my firm intention to lie awake all night and watch, but the\r\nexhaustion of nerves and body decreed otherwise, and sleep after a\r\nwhile came over me with a welcome blanket of oblivion. The fact that my\r\ncompanion also slept quickened its approach. At first he fidgeted and\r\nconstantly sat up, asking me if I “heard this” or “heard that.” He\r\ntossed about on his cork mattress, and said the tent was moving and the\r\nriver had risen over the point of the island, but each time I went out\r\nto look I returned with the report that all was well, and finally he\r\ngrew calmer and lay still. Then at length his breathing became regular\r\nand I heard unmistakable sounds of snoring—the first and only time in\r\nmy life when snoring has been a welcome and calming influence.\r\n\r\nThis, I remember, was the last thought in my mind before dozing off.\r\n\r\nA difficulty in breathing woke me, and I found the blanket over my\r\nface. But something else besides the blanket was pressing upon me, and\r\nmy first thought was that my companion had rolled off his mattress on\r\nto my own in his sleep. I called to him and sat up, and at the same\r\nmoment it came to me that the tent was _surrounded_. That sound of\r\nmultitudinous soft pattering was again audible outside, filling the\r\nnight with horror.\r\n\r\nI called again to him, louder than before. He did not answer, but I\r\nmissed the sound of his snoring, and also noticed that the flap of the\r\ntent was down. This was the unpardonable sin. I crawled out in the\r\ndarkness to hook it back securely, and it was then for the first time I\r\nrealized positively that the Swede was not here. He had gone.\r\n\r\nI dashed out in a mad run, seized by a dreadful agitation, and the\r\nmoment I was out I plunged into a sort of torrent of humming that\r\nsurrounded me completely and came out of every quarter of the heavens\r\nat once. It was that same familiar humming—gone mad! A swarm of great\r\ninvisible bees might have been about me in the air. The sound seemed to\r\nthicken the very atmosphere, and I felt that my lungs worked with\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nBut my friend was in danger, and I could not hesitate.\r\n\r\nThe dawn was just about to break, and a faint whitish light spread\r\nupwards over the clouds from a thin strip of clear horizon. No wind\r\nstirred. I could just make out the bushes and river beyond, and the\r\npale sandy patches. In my excitement I ran frantically to and fro about\r\nthe island, calling him by name, shouting at the top of my voice the\r\nfirst words that came into my head. But the willows smothered my voice,\r\nand the humming muffled it, so that the sound only traveled a few feet\r\nround me. I plunged among the bushes, tripping headlong, tumbling over\r\nroots, and scraping my face as I tore this way and that among the\r\npreventing branches.\r\n\r\nThen, quite unexpectedly, I came out upon the island’s point and saw a\r\ndark figure outlined between the water and the sky. It was the Swede.\r\nAnd already he had one foot in the river! A moment more and he would\r\nhave taken the plunge.\r\n\r\nI threw myself upon him, flinging my arms about his waist and dragging\r\nhim shorewards with all my strength. Of course he struggled furiously,\r\nmaking a noise all the time just like that cursed humming, and using\r\nthe most outlandish phrases in his anger about “going _inside_ to\r\nThem,” and “taking the way of the water and the wind,” and God only\r\nknows what more besides, that I tried in vain to recall afterwards, but\r\nwhich turned me sick with horror and amazement as I listened. But in\r\nthe end I managed to get him into the comparative safety of the tent,\r\nand flung him breathless and cursing upon the mattress where I held him\r\nuntil the fit had passed.\r\n\r\nI think the suddenness with which it all went and he grew calm,\r\ncoinciding as it did with the equally abrupt cessation of the humming\r\nand pattering outside—I think this was almost the strangest part of the\r\nwhole business perhaps. For he had just opened his eyes and turned his\r\ntired face up to me so that the dawn threw a pale light upon it through\r\nthe doorway, and said, for all the world just like a frightened child:\r\n\r\n“My life, old man—it’s my life I owe you. But it’s all over now anyhow.\r\nThey’ve found a victim in our place!”\r\n\r\nThen he dropped back upon his blankets and went to sleep literally\r\nunder my eyes. He simply collapsed, and began to snore again as\r\nhealthily as though nothing had happened and he had never tried to\r\noffer his own life as a sacrifice by drowning. And when the sunlight\r\nwoke him three hours later—hours of ceaseless vigil for me—it became so\r\nclear to me that he remembered absolutely nothing of what he had\r\nattempted to do, that I deemed it wise to hold my peace and ask no\r\ndangerous questions.\r\n\r\nHe woke naturally and easily, as I have said, when the sun was already\r\nhigh in a windless hot sky, and he at once got up and set about the\r\npreparation of the fire for breakfast. I followed him anxiously at\r\nbathing, but he did not attempt to plunge in, merely dipping his head\r\nand making some remark about the extra coldness of the water.\r\n\r\n“River’s falling at last,” he said, “and I’m glad of it.”\r\n\r\n“The humming has stopped too,” I said.\r\n\r\nHe looked up at me quietly with his normal expression. Evidently he\r\nremembered everything except his own attempt at suicide.\r\n\r\n“Everything has stopped,” he said, “because—”\r\n\r\nHe hesitated. But I knew some reference to that remark he had made just\r\nbefore he fainted was in his mind, and I was determined to know it.\r\n\r\n“Because ‘They’ve found another victim’?” I said, forcing a little\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” he answered, “exactly! I feel as positive of it as though—as\r\nthough—I feel quite safe again, I mean,” he finished.\r\n\r\nHe began to look curiously about him. The sunlight lay in hot patches\r\non the sand. There was no wind. The willows were motionless. He slowly\r\nrose to feet.\r\n\r\n“Come,” he said; “I think if we look, we shall find it.”\r\n\r\nHe started off on a run, and I followed him. He kept to the banks,\r\npoking with a stick among the sandy bays and caves and little\r\nback-waters, myself always close on his heels.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he exclaimed presently, “ah!”\r\n\r\nThe tone of his voice somehow brought back to me a vivid sense of the\r\nhorror of the last twenty-four hours, and I hurried up to join him. He\r\nwas pointing with his stick at a large black object that lay half in\r\nthe water and half on the sand. It appeared to be caught by some\r\ntwisted willow roots so that the river could not sweep it away. A few\r\nhours before the spot must have been under water.\r\n\r\n“See,” he said quietly, “the victim that made our escape possible!”\r\n\r\nAnd when I peered across his shoulder I saw that his stick rested on\r\nthe body of a man. He turned it over. It was the corpse of a peasant,\r\nand the face was hidden in the sand. Clearly the man had been drowned,\r\nbut a few hours before, and his body must have been swept down upon our\r\nisland somewhere about the hour of the dawn—_at the very time the fit\r\nhad passed._\r\n\r\n“We must give it a decent burial, you know.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose so,” I replied. I shuddered a little in spite of myself, for\r\nthere was something about the appearance of that poor drowned man that\r\nturned me cold.\r\n\r\nThe Swede glanced up sharply at me, an undecipherable expression on his\r\nface, and began clambering down the bank. I followed him more\r\nleisurely. The current, I noticed, had torn away much of the clothing\r\nfrom the body, so that the neck and part of the chest lay bare.\r\n\r\nHalfway down the bank my companion suddenly stopped and held up his\r\nhand in warning; but either my foot slipped, or I had gained too much\r\nmomentum to bring myself quickly to a halt, for I bumped into him and\r\nsent him forward with a sort of leap to save himself. We tumbled\r\ntogether on to the hard sand so that our feet splashed into the water.\r\nAnd, before anything could be done, we had collided a little heavily\r\nagainst the corpse.\r\n\r\nThe Swede uttered a sharp cry. And I sprang back as if I had been shot.\r\n\r\nAt the moment we touched the body there rose from its surface the loud\r\nsound of humming—the sound of several hummings—which passed with a vast\r\ncommotion as of winged things in the air about us and disappeared\r\nupwards into the sky, growing fainter and fainter till they finally\r\nceased in the distance. It was exactly as though we had disturbed some\r\nliving yet invisible creatures at work.\r\n\r\nMy companion clutched me, and I think I clutched him, but before either\r\nof us had time properly to recover from the unexpected shock, we saw\r\nthat a movement of the current was turning the corpse round so that it\r\nbecame released from the grip of the willow roots. A moment later it\r\nhad turned completely over, the dead face uppermost, staring at the\r\nsky. It lay on the edge of the main stream. In another moment it would\r\nbe swept away.\r\n\r\nThe Swede started to save it, shouting again something I did not catch\r\nabout a “proper burial”—and then abruptly dropped upon his knees on the\r\nsand and covered his eyes with his hands. I was beside him in an\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nI saw what he had seen.\r\n\r\nFor just as the body swung round to the current the face and the\r\nexposed chest turned full towards us, and showed plainly how the skin\r\nand flesh were indented with small hollows, beautifully formed, and\r\nexactly similar in shape and kind to the sand-funnels that we had found\r\nall over the island.\r\n\r\n“Their mark!” I heard my companion mutter under his breath. “Their\r\nawful mark!”\r\n\r\nAnd when I turned my eyes again from his ghastly face to the river, the\r\ncurrent had done its work, and the body had been swept away into\r\nmid-stream and was already beyond our reach and almost out of sight,\r\nturning over and over on the waves like an otter.",
