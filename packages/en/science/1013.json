The Last Message Cavor sent to the Earth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\nMr. Bedford Meets Mr. Cavor at Lympne\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I sit down to write here amidst the shadows of vine-leaves under the\r\nblue sky of southern Italy, it comes to me with a certain quality of\r\nastonishment that my participation in these amazing adventures of Mr.\r\nCavor was, after all, the outcome of the purest accident. It might have\r\nbeen any one. I fell into these things at a time when I thought myself\r\nremoved from the slightest possibility of disturbing experiences. I had\r\ngone to Lympne because I had imagined it the most uneventful place in\r\nthe world. “Here, at any rate,” said I, “I shall find peace and a\r\nchance to work!”\r\n\r\nAnd this book is the sequel. So utterly at variance is destiny with all\r\nthe little plans of men. I may perhaps mention here that very recently\r\nI had come an ugly cropper in certain business enterprises. Sitting now\r\nsurrounded by all the circumstances of wealth, there is a luxury in\r\nadmitting my extremity. I can admit, even, that to a certain extent my\r\ndisasters were conceivably of my own making. It may be there are\r\ndirections in which I have some capacity, but the conduct of business\r\noperations is not among these. But in those days I was young, and my\r\nyouth among other objectionable forms took that of a pride in my\r\ncapacity for affairs. I am young still in years, but the things that\r\nhave happened to me have rubbed something of the youth from my mind.\r\nWhether they have brought any wisdom to light below it is a more\r\ndoubtful matter.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to go into the details of the speculations\r\nthat landed me at Lympne, in Kent. Nowadays even about business\r\ntransactions there is a strong spice of adventure. I took risks. In\r\nthese things there is invariably a certain amount of give and take, and\r\nit fell to me finally to do the giving reluctantly enough. Even when I\r\nhad got out of everything, one cantankerous creditor saw fit to be\r\nmalignant. Perhaps you have met that flaming sense of outraged virtue,\r\nor perhaps you have only felt it. He ran me hard. It seemed to me, at\r\nlast, that there was nothing for it but to write a play, unless I\r\nwanted to drudge for my living as a clerk. I have a certain\r\nimagination, and luxurious tastes, and I meant to make a vigorous fight\r\nfor it before that fate overtook me. In addition to my belief in my\r\npowers as a business man, I had always in those days had an idea that I\r\nwas equal to writing a very good play. It is not, I believe, a very\r\nuncommon persuasion. I knew there is nothing a man can do outside\r\nlegitimate business transactions that has such opulent possibilities,\r\nand very probably that biased my opinion. I had, indeed, got into the\r\nhabit of regarding this unwritten drama as a convenient little reserve\r\nput by for a rainy day. That rainy day had come, and I set to work.\r\n\r\nI soon discovered that writing a play was a longer business than I had\r\nsupposed; at first I had reckoned ten days for it, and it was to have a\r\n_pied-à-terre_ while it was in hand that I came to Lympne. I reckoned\r\nmyself lucky in getting that little bungalow. I got it on a three\r\nyears’ agreement. I put in a few sticks of furniture, and while the\r\nplay was in hand I did my own cooking. My cooking would have shocked\r\nMrs. Bond. And yet, you know, it had flavour. I had a coffee-pot, a\r\nsauce-pan for eggs, and one for potatoes, and a frying-pan for sausages\r\nand bacon—such was the simple apparatus of my comfort. One cannot\r\nalways be magnificent, but simplicity is always a possible alternative.\r\nFor the rest I laid in an eighteen-gallon cask of beer on credit, and a\r\ntrustful baker came each day. It was not, perhaps, in the style of\r\nSybaris, but I have had worse times. I was a little sorry for the\r\nbaker, who was a very decent man indeed, but even for him I hoped.\r\n\r\nCertainly if any one wants solitude, the place is Lympne. It is in the\r\nclay part of Kent, and my bungalow stood on the edge of an old sea\r\ncliff and stared across the flats of Romney Marsh at the sea. In very\r\nwet weather the place is almost inaccessible, and I have heard that at\r\ntimes the postman used to traverse the more succulent portions of his\r\nroute with boards upon his feet. I never saw him doing so, but I can\r\nquite imagine it. Outside the doors of the few cottages and houses that\r\nmake up the present village big birch besoms are stuck, to wipe off the\r\nworst of the clay, which will give some idea of the texture of the\r\ndistrict. I doubt if the place would be there at all, if it were not a\r\nfading memory of things gone for ever. It was the big port of England\r\nin Roman times, Portus Lemanis, and now the sea is four miles away. All\r\ndown the steep hill are boulders and masses of Roman brickwork, and\r\nfrom it old Watling Street, still paved in places, starts like an arrow\r\nto the north. I used to stand on the hill and think of it all, the\r\ngalleys and legions, the captives and officials, the women and traders,\r\nthe speculators like myself, all the swarm and tumult that came\r\nclanking in and out of the harbour. And now just a few lumps of rubble\r\non a grassy slope, and a sheep or two—and I. And where the port had\r\nbeen were the levels of the marsh, sweeping round in a broad curve to\r\ndistant Dungeness, and dotted here and there with tree clumps and the\r\nchurch towers of old mediæval towns that are following Lemanis now\r\ntowards extinction.\r\n\r\nThat outlook on the marsh was, indeed, one of the finest views I have\r\never seen. I suppose Dungeness was fifteen miles away; it lay like a\r\nraft on the sea, and farther westward were the hills by Hastings under\r\nthe setting sun. Sometimes they hung close and clear, sometimes they\r\nwere faded and low, and often the drift of the weather took them clean\r\nout of sight. And all the nearer parts of the marsh were laced and lit\r\nby ditches and canals.\r\n\r\nThe window at which I worked looked over the skyline of this crest, and\r\nit was from this window that I first set eyes on Cavor. It was just as\r\nI was struggling with my scenario, holding down my mind to the sheer\r\nhard work of it, and naturally enough he arrested my attention.\r\n\r\nThe sun had set, the sky was a vivid tranquillity of green and yellow,\r\nand against that he came out black—the oddest little figure.\r\n\r\nHe was a short, round-bodied, thin-legged little man, with a jerky\r\nquality in his motions; he had seen fit to clothe his extraordinary\r\nmind in a cricket cap, an overcoat, and cycling knickerbockers and\r\nstockings. Why he did so I do not know, for he never cycled and he\r\nnever played cricket. It was a fortuitous concurrence of garments,\r\narising I know not how. He gesticulated with his hands and arms, and\r\njerked his head about and buzzed. He buzzed like something electric.\r\nYou never heard such buzzing. And ever and again he cleared his throat\r\nwith a most extraordinary noise.\r\n\r\nThere had been rain, and that spasmodic walk of his was enhanced by the\r\nextreme slipperiness of the footpath. Exactly as he came against the\r\nsun he stopped, pulled out a watch, hesitated. Then with a sort of\r\nconvulsive gesture he turned and retreated with every manifestation of\r\nhaste, no longer gesticulating, but going with ample strides that\r\nshowed the relatively large size of his feet—they were, I remember,\r\ngrotesquely exaggerated in size by adhesive clay—to the best possible\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nThis occurred on the first day of my sojourn, when my play-writing\r\nenergy was at its height and I regarded the incident simply as an\r\nannoying distraction—the waste of five minutes. I returned to my\r\nscenario. But when next evening the apparition was repeated with\r\nremarkable precision, and again the next evening, and indeed every\r\nevening when rain was not falling, concentration upon the scenario\r\nbecame a considerable effort. “Confound the man,” I said, “one would\r\nthink he was learning to be a marionette!” and for several evenings I\r\ncursed him pretty heartily. Then my annoyance gave way to amazement and\r\ncuriosity. Why on earth should a man do this thing? On the fourteenth\r\nevening I could stand it no longer, and so soon as he appeared I opened\r\nthe french window, crossed the verandah, and directed myself to the\r\npoint where he invariably stopped.\r\n\r\nHe had his watch out as I came up to him. He had a chubby, rubicund\r\nface with reddish brown eyes—previously I had seen him only against the\r\nlight. “One moment, sir,” said I as he turned. He stared. “One moment,”\r\nhe said, “certainly. Or if you wish to speak to me for longer, and it\r\nis not asking too much—your moment is up—would it trouble you to\r\naccompany me?”\r\n\r\n“Not in the least,” said I, placing myself beside him.\r\n\r\n“My habits are regular. My time for intercourse—limited.”\r\n\r\n“This, I presume, is your time for exercise?”\r\n\r\n“It is. I come here to enjoy the sunset.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t.”\r\n\r\n“Sir?”\r\n\r\n“You never look at it.”\r\n\r\n“Never look at it?”\r\n\r\n“No. I’ve watched you thirteen nights, and not once have you looked at\r\nthe sunset—not once.”\r\n\r\nHe knitted his brows like one who encounters a problem.\r\n\r\n“Well, I enjoy the sunlight—the atmosphere—I go along this path,\r\nthrough that gate”—he jerked his head over his shoulder—“and round—”\r\n\r\n“You don’t. You never have been. It’s all nonsense. There isn’t a way.\r\nTo-night for instance—”\r\n\r\n“Oh! to-night! Let me see. Ah! I just glanced at my watch, saw that I\r\nhad already been out just three minutes over the precise half-hour,\r\ndecided there was not time to go round, turned—”\r\n\r\n“You always do.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at me—reflected. “Perhaps I do, now I come to think of it.\r\nBut what was it you wanted to speak to me about?”\r\n\r\n“Why, this!”\r\n\r\n“This?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Why do you do it? Every night you come making a noise—”\r\n\r\n“Making a noise?”\r\n\r\n“Like this.” I imitated his buzzing noise. He looked at me, and it was\r\nevident the buzzing awakened distaste. “Do I do _that?_” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Every blessed evening.”\r\n\r\n“I had no idea.”\r\n\r\nHe stopped dead. He regarded me gravely. “Can it be,” he said, “that I\r\nhave formed a Habit?”\r\n\r\n“Well, it looks like it. Doesn’t it?”\r\n\r\nHe pulled down his lower lip between finger and thumb. He regarded a\r\npuddle at his feet.\r\n\r\n“My mind is much occupied,” he said. “And you want to know _why!_ Well,\r\nsir, I can assure you that not only do I not know why I do these\r\nthings, but I did not even know I did them. Come to think, it is just\r\nas you say; I never _have_ been beyond that field.... And these things\r\nannoy you?”\r\n\r\nFor some reason I was beginning to relent towards him. “Not _annoy_,” I\r\nsaid. “But—imagine yourself writing a play!”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Well, anything that needs concentration.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he said, “of course,” and meditated. His expression became so\r\neloquent of distress, that I relented still more. After all, there is a\r\ntouch of aggression in demanding of a man you don’t know why he hums on\r\na public footpath.\r\n\r\n“You see,” he said weakly, “it’s a habit.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I recognise that.”\r\n\r\n“I must stop it.”\r\n\r\n“But not if it puts you out. After all, I had no business—it’s\r\nsomething of a liberty.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all, sir,” he said, “not at all. I am greatly indebted to you.\r\nI should guard myself against these things. In future I will. Could I\r\ntrouble you—once again? That noise?”\r\n\r\n“Something like this,” I said. “Zuzzoo, zuzzoo. But really, you know—”\r\n\r\n“I am greatly obliged to you. In fact, I know I am getting absurdly\r\nabsent-minded. You are quite justified, sir—perfectly justified.\r\nIndeed, I am indebted to you. The thing shall end. And now, sir, I have\r\nalready brought you farther than I should have done.”\r\n\r\n“I do hope my impertinence—”\r\n\r\n“Not at all, sir, not at all.”\r\n\r\nWe regarded each other for a moment. I raised my hat and wished him a\r\ngood evening. He responded convulsively, and so we went our ways.\r\n\r\nAt the stile I looked back at his receding figure. His bearing had\r\nchanged remarkably, he seemed limp, shrunken. The contrast with his\r\nformer gesticulating, zuzzoing self took me in some absurd way as\r\npathetic. I watched him out of sight. Then wishing very heartily I had\r\nkept to my own business, I returned to my bungalow and my play.\r\n\r\nThe next evening I saw nothing of him, nor the next. But he was very\r\nmuch in my mind, and it had occurred to me that as a sentimental comic\r\ncharacter he might serve a useful purpose in the development of my\r\nplot. The third day he called upon me.\r\n\r\nFor a time I was puzzled to think what had brought him. He made\r\nindifferent conversation in the most formal way, then abruptly he came\r\nto business. He wanted to buy me out of my bungalow.\r\n\r\n“You see,” he said, “I don’t blame you in the least, but you’ve\r\ndestroyed a habit, and it disorganises my day. I’ve walked past here\r\nfor years—years. No doubt I’ve hummed.... You’ve made all that\r\nimpossible!”\r\n\r\nI suggested he might try some other direction.\r\n\r\n“No. There is no other direction. This is the only one. I’ve inquired.\r\nAnd now—every afternoon at four—I come to a dead wall.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear sir, if the thing is so important to you—”\r\n\r\n“It’s vital. You see, I’m—I’m an investigator—I am engaged in a\r\nscientific research. I live—” he paused and seemed to think. “Just over\r\nthere,” he said, and pointed suddenly dangerously near my eye. “The\r\nhouse with white chimneys you see just over the trees. And my\r\ncircumstances are abnormal—abnormal. I am on the point of completing\r\none of the most important—demonstrations—I can assure you one of _the\r\nmost important_ demonstrations that have ever been made. It requires\r\nconstant thought, constant mental ease and activity. And the afternoon\r\nwas my brightest time!—effervescing with new ideas—new points of view.”\r\n\r\n“But why not come by still?”\r\n\r\n“It would be all different. I should be self-conscious. I should think\r\nof you at your play—watching me irritated—instead of thinking of my\r\nwork. No! I must have the bungalow.”\r\n\r\nI meditated. Naturally, I wanted to think the matter over thoroughly\r\nbefore anything decisive was said. I was generally ready enough for\r\nbusiness in those days, and selling always attracted me; but in the\r\nfirst place it was not my bungalow, and even if I sold it to him at a\r\ngood price I might get inconvenienced in the delivery of goods if the\r\ncurrent owner got wind of the transaction, and in the second I was,\r\nwell—undischarged. It was clearly a business that required delicate\r\nhandling. Moreover, the possibility of his being in pursuit of some\r\nvaluable invention also interested me. It occurred to me that I would\r\nlike to know more of this research, not with any dishonest intention,\r\nbut simply with an idea that to know what it was would be a relief from\r\nplay-writing. I threw out feelers.\r\n\r\nHe was quite willing to supply information. Indeed, once he was fairly\r\nunder way the conversation became a monologue. He talked like a man\r\nlong pent up, who has had it over with himself again and again. He\r\ntalked for nearly an hour, and I must confess I found it a pretty stiff\r\nbit of listening. But through it all there was the undertone of\r\nsatisfaction one feels when one is neglecting work one has set oneself.\r\nDuring that first interview I gathered very little of the drift of his\r\nwork. Half his words were technicalities entirely strange to me, and he\r\nillustrated one or two points with what he was pleased to call\r\nelementary mathematics, computing on an envelope with a copying-ink\r\npencil, in a manner that made it hard even to seem to understand.\r\n“Yes,” I said, “yes. Go on!” Nevertheless I made out enough to convince\r\nme that he was no mere crank playing at discoveries. In spite of his\r\ncrank-like appearance there was a force about him that made that\r\nimpossible. Whatever it was, it was a thing with mechanical\r\npossibilities. He told me of a work-shed he had, and of three\r\nassistants—originally jobbing carpenters—whom he had trained. Now, from\r\nthe work-shed to the patent office is clearly only one step. He invited\r\nme to see those things. I accepted readily, and took care, by a remark\r\nor so, to underline that. The proposed transfer of the bungalow\r\nremained very conveniently in suspense.\r\n\r\nAt last he rose to depart, with an apology for the length of his call.\r\nTalking over his work was, he said, a pleasure enjoyed only too rarely.\r\nIt was not often he found such an intelligent listener as myself, he\r\nmingled very little with professional scientific men.\r\n\r\n“So much pettiness,” he explained; “so much intrigue! And really, when\r\none has an idea—a novel, fertilising idea—I don’t want to be\r\nuncharitable, but—”\r\n\r\nI am a man who believes in impulses. I made what was perhaps a rash\r\nproposition. But you must remember, that I had been alone, play-writing\r\nin Lympne, for fourteen days, and my compunction for his ruined walk\r\nstill hung about me. “Why not,” said I, “make this your new habit? In\r\nthe place of the one I spoilt? At least, until we can settle about the\r\nbungalow. What you want is to turn over your work in your mind. That\r\nyou have always done during your afternoon walk. Unfortunately that’s\r\nover—you can’t get things back as they were. But why not come and talk\r\nabout your work to me; use me as a sort of wall against which you may\r\nthrow your thoughts and catch them again? It’s certain I don’t know\r\nenough to steal your ideas myself—and I know no scientific men—”\r\n\r\nI stopped. He was considering. Evidently the thing attracted him. “But\r\nI’m afraid I should bore you,” he said.\r\n\r\n“You think I’m too dull?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no; but technicalities—”\r\n\r\n“Anyhow, you’ve interested me immensely this afternoon.”\r\n\r\n“Of course it _would_ be a great help to me. Nothing clears up one’s\r\nideas so much as explaining them. Hitherto—”\r\n\r\n“My dear sir, say no more.”\r\n\r\n“But really can you spare the time?”\r\n\r\n“There is no rest like change of occupation,” I said, with profound\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\nThe affair was over. On my verandah steps he turned. “I am already\r\ngreatly indebted to you,” he said.\r\n\r\nI made an interrogative noise.\r\n\r\n“You have completely cured me of that ridiculous habit of humming,” he\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nI think I said I was glad to be of any service to him, and he turned\r\naway.\r\n\r\nImmediately the train of thought that our conversation had suggested\r\nmust have resumed its sway. His arms began to wave in their former\r\nfashion. The faint echo of “zuzzoo” came back to me on the breeze....\r\n\r\nWell, after all, that was not my affair....\r\n\r\nHe came the next day, and again the next day after that, and delivered\r\ntwo lectures on physics to our mutual satisfaction. He talked with an\r\nair of being extremely lucid about the “ether” and “tubes of force,”\r\nand “gravitational potential,” and things like that, and I sat in my\r\nother folding-chair and said, “Yes,” “Go on,” “I follow you,” to keep\r\nhim going. It was tremendously difficult stuff, but I do not think he\r\never suspected how much I did not understand him. There were moments\r\nwhen I doubted whether I was well employed, but at any rate I was\r\nresting from that confounded play. Now and then things gleamed on me\r\nclearly for a space, only to vanish just when I thought I had hold of\r\nthem. Sometimes my attention failed altogether, and I would give it up\r\nand sit and stare at him, wondering whether, after all, it would not be\r\nbetter to use him as a central figure in a good farce and let all this\r\nother stuff slide. And then, perhaps, I would catch on again for a bit.\r\n\r\nAt the earliest opportunity I went to see his house. It was large and\r\ncarelessly furnished; there were no servants other than his three\r\nassistants, and his dietary and private life were characterised by a\r\nphilosophical simplicity. He was a water-drinker, a vegetarian, and all\r\nthose logical disciplinary things. But the sight of his equipment\r\nsettled many doubts. It looked like business from cellar to attic—an\r\namazing little place to find in an out-of-the-way village. The\r\nground-floor rooms contained benches and apparatus, the bakehouse and\r\nscullery boiler had developed into respectable furnaces, dynamos\r\noccupied the cellar, and there was a gasometer in the garden. He showed\r\nit to me with all the confiding zest of a man who has been living too\r\nmuch alone. His seclusion was overflowing now in an excess of\r\nconfidence, and I had the good luck to be the recipient.\r\n\r\nThe three assistants were creditable specimens of the class of\r\n“handy-men” from which they came. Conscientious if unintelligent,\r\nstrong, civil, and willing. One, Spargus, who did the cooking and all\r\nthe metal work, had been a sailor; a second, Gibbs, was a joiner; and\r\nthe third was an ex-jobbing gardener, and now general assistant. They\r\nwere the merest labourers. All the intelligent work was done by Cavor.\r\nTheirs was the darkest ignorance compared even with my muddled\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as to the nature of these inquiries. Here, unhappily, comes a\r\ngrave difficulty. I am no scientific expert, and if I were to attempt\r\nto set forth in the highly scientific language of Mr. Cavor the aim to\r\nwhich his experiments tended, I am afraid I should confuse not only the\r\nreader but myself, and almost certainly I should make some blunder that\r\nwould bring upon me the mockery of every up-to-date student of\r\nmathematical physics in the country. The best thing I can do therefore\r\nis, I think to give my impressions in my own inexact language, without\r\nany attempt to wear a garment of knowledge to which I have no claim.\r\n\r\nThe object of Mr. Cavor’s search was a substance that should be\r\n“opaque”—he used some other word I have forgotten, but “opaque” conveys\r\nthe idea—to “all forms of radiant energy.” “Radiant energy,” he made me\r\nunderstand, was anything like light or heat, or those Röntgen Rays\r\nthere was so much talk about a year or so ago, or the electric waves of\r\nMarconi, or gravitation. All these things, he said, _radiate_ out from\r\ncentres, and act on bodies at a distance, whence comes the term\r\n“radiant energy.” Now almost all substances are opaque to some form or\r\nother of radiant energy. Glass, for example, is transparent to light,\r\nbut much less so to heat, so that it is useful as a fire-screen; and\r\nalum is transparent to light, but blocks heat completely. A solution of\r\niodine in carbon bisulphide, on the other hand, completely blocks\r\nlight, but is quite transparent to heat. It will hide a fire from you,\r\nbut permit all its warmth to reach you. Metals are not only opaque to\r\nlight and heat, but also to electrical energy, which passes through\r\nboth iodine solution and glass almost as though they were not\r\ninterposed. And so on.\r\n\r\nNow all known substances are “transparent” to gravitation. You can use\r\nscreens of various sorts to cut off the light or heat, or electrical\r\ninfluence of the sun, or the warmth of the earth from anything; you can\r\nscreen things by sheets of metal from Marconi’s rays, but nothing will\r\ncut off the gravitational attraction of the sun or the gravitational\r\nattraction of the earth. Yet why there should be nothing is hard to\r\nsay. Cavor did not see why such a substance should not exist, and\r\ncertainly I could not tell him. I had never thought of such a\r\npossibility before. He showed me by calculations on paper, which Lord\r\nKelvin, no doubt, or Professor Lodge, or Professor Karl Pearson, or any\r\nof those great scientific people might have understood, but which\r\nsimply reduced me to a hopeless muddle, that not only was such a\r\nsubstance possible, but that it must satisfy certain conditions. It was\r\nan amazing piece of reasoning. Much as it amazed and exercised me at\r\nthe time, it would be impossible to reproduce it here. “Yes,” I said to\r\nit all, “yes; go on!” Suffice it for this story that he believed he\r\nmight be able to manufacture this possible substance opaque to\r\ngravitation out of a complicated alloy of metals and something new—a\r\nnew element, I fancy—called, I believe, _helium_, which was sent to him\r\nfrom London in sealed stone jars. Doubt has been thrown upon this\r\ndetail, but I am almost certain it was _helium_ he had sent him in\r\nsealed stone jars. It was certainly something very gaseous and thin. If\r\nonly I had taken notes...\r\n\r\nBut then, how was I to foresee the necessity of taking notes?\r\n\r\nAny one with the merest germ of an imagination will understand the\r\nextraordinary possibilities of such a substance, and will sympathise a\r\nlittle with the emotion I felt as this understanding emerged from the\r\nhaze of abstruse phrases in which Cavor expressed himself. Comic relief\r\nin a play indeed! It was some time before I would believe that I had\r\ninterpreted him aright, and I was very careful not to ask questions\r\nthat would have enabled him to gauge the profundity of misunderstanding\r\ninto which he dropped his daily exposition. But no one reading the\r\nstory of it here will sympathise fully, because from my barren\r\nnarrative it will be impossible to gather the strength of my conviction\r\nthat this astonishing substance was positively going to be made.\r\n\r\nI do not recall that I gave my play an hour’s consecutive work at any\r\ntime after my visit to his house. My imagination had other things to\r\ndo. There seemed no limit to the possibilities of the stuff; whichever\r\nway I tried I came on miracles and revolutions. For example, if one\r\nwanted to lift a weight, however enormous, one had only to get a sheet\r\nof this substance beneath it, and one might lift it with a straw. My\r\nfirst natural impulse was to apply this principle to guns and\r\nironclads, and all the material and methods of war, and from that to\r\nshipping, locomotion, building, every conceivable form of human\r\nindustry. The chance that had brought me into the very birth-chamber of\r\nthis new time—it was an epoch, no less—was one of those chances that\r\ncome once in a thousand years. The thing unrolled, it expanded and\r\nexpanded. Among other things I saw in it my redemption as a business\r\nman. I saw a parent company, and daughter companies, applications to\r\nright of us, applications to left, rings and trusts, privileges, and\r\nconcessions spreading and spreading, until one vast, stupendous\r\nCavorite company ran and ruled the world.\r\n\r\nAnd I was in it!\r\n\r\nI took my line straight away. I knew I was staking everything, but I\r\njumped there and then.\r\n\r\n“We’re on absolutely the biggest thing that has ever been invented,” I\r\nsaid, and put the accent on “we.” “If you want to keep me out of this,\r\nyou’ll have to do it with a gun. I’m coming down to be your fourth\r\nlabourer to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nHe seemed surprised at my enthusiasm, but not a bit suspicious or\r\nhostile. Rather, he was self-depreciatory. He looked at me doubtfully.\r\n“But do you really think—?” he said. “And your play! How about that\r\nplay?”\r\n\r\n“It’s vanished!” I cried. “My dear sir, don’t you see what you’ve got?\r\nDon’t you see what you’re going to do?”\r\n\r\nThat was merely a rhetorical turn, but positively, he didn’t. At first\r\nI could not believe it. He had not had the beginning of the inkling of\r\nan idea. This astonishing little man had been working on purely\r\ntheoretical grounds the whole time! When he said it was “the most\r\nimportant” research the world had ever seen, he simply meant it squared\r\nup so many theories, settled so much that was in doubt; he had troubled\r\nno more about the application of the stuff he was going to turn out\r\nthan if he had been a machine that makes guns. This was a possible\r\nsubstance, and he was going to make it! _V’la tout_, as the Frenchman\r\nsays.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, he was childish! If he made it, it would go down to\r\nposterity as Cavorite or Cavorine, and he would be made an F.R.S., and\r\nhis portrait given away as a scientific worthy with _Nature_, and\r\nthings like that. And that was all he saw! He would have dropped this\r\nbombshell into the world as though he had discovered a new species of\r\ngnat, if it had not happened that I had come along. And there it would\r\nhave lain and fizzled, like one or two other little things these\r\nscientific people have lit and dropped about us.\r\n\r\nWhen I realised this, it was I did the talking, and Cavor who said, “Go\r\non!” I jumped up. I paced the room, gesticulating like a boy of twenty.\r\nI tried to make him understand his duties and responsibilities in the\r\nmatter—_our_ duties and responsibilities in the matter. I assured him\r\nwe might make wealth enough to work any sort of social revolution we\r\nfancied, we might own and order the whole world. I told him of\r\ncompanies and patents, and the case for secret processes. All these\r\nthings seemed to take him much as his mathematics had taken me. A look\r\nof perplexity came into his ruddy little face. He stammered something\r\nabout indifference to wealth, but I brushed all that aside. He had got\r\nto be rich, and it was no good his stammering. I gave him to understand\r\nthe sort of man I was, and that I had had very considerable business\r\nexperience. I did not tell him I was an undischarged bankrupt at the\r\ntime, because that was temporary, but I think I reconciled my evident\r\npoverty with my financial claims. And quite insensibly, in the way such\r\nprojects grow, the understanding of a Cavorite monopoly grew up between\r\nus. He was to make the stuff, and I was to make the boom.\r\n\r\nI stuck like a leech to the “we”—“you” and “I” didn’t exist for me.\r\n\r\nHis idea was that the profits I spoke of might go to endow research,\r\nbut that, of course, was a matter we had to settle later. “That’s all\r\nright,” I shouted, “that’s all right.” The great point, as I insisted,\r\nwas to get the thing done.\r\n\r\n“Here is a substance,” I cried, “no home, no factory, no fortress, no\r\nship can dare to be without—more universally applicable even than a\r\npatent medicine. There isn’t a solitary aspect of it, not one of its\r\nten thousand possible uses that will not make us rich, Cavor, beyond\r\nthe dreams of avarice!”\r\n\r\n“No!” he said. “I begin to see. It’s extraordinary how one gets new\r\npoints of view by talking over things!”\r\n\r\n“And as it happens you have just talked to the right man!”\r\n\r\n“I suppose no one,” he said, “is absolutely _averse_ to enormous\r\nwealth. Of course there is one thing—”\r\n\r\nHe paused. I stood still.\r\n\r\n“It is just possible, you know, that we may not be able to make it\r\nafter all! It may be one of those things that are a theoretical\r\npossibility, but a practical absurdity. Or when we make it, there may\r\nbe some little hitch!”\r\n\r\n“We’ll tackle the hitch when it comes,” said I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\nThe First Making of Cavorite\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Cavor’s fears were groundless, so far as the actual making was\r\nconcerned. On the 14th of October, 1899, this incredible substance was\r\nmade!\r\n\r\nOddly enough, it was made at last by accident, when Mr. Cavor least\r\nexpected it. He had fused together a number of metals and certain other\r\nthings—I wish I knew the particulars now!—and he intended to leave the\r\nmixture a week and then allow it to cool slowly. Unless he had\r\nmiscalculated, the last stage in the combination would occur when the\r\nstuff sank to a temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit. But it chanced\r\nthat, unknown to Cavor, dissension had arisen about the furnace\r\ntending. Gibbs, who had previously seen to this, had suddenly attempted\r\nto shift it to the man who had been a gardener, on the score that coal\r\nwas soil, being dug, and therefore could not possibly fall within the\r\nprovince of a joiner; the man who had been a jobbing gardener alleged,\r\nhowever, that coal was a metallic or ore-like substance, let alone that\r\nhe was cook. But Spargus insisted on Gibbs doing the coaling, seeing\r\nthat he was a joiner and that coal is notoriously fossil wood.\r\nConsequently Gibbs ceased to replenish the furnace, and no one else did\r\nso, and Cavor was too much immersed in certain interesting problems\r\nconcerning a Cavorite flying machine (neglecting the resistance of the\r\nair and one or two other points) to perceive that anything was wrong.\r\nAnd the premature birth of his invention took place just as he was\r\ncoming across the field to my bungalow for our afternoon talk and tea.\r\n\r\nI remember the occasion with extreme vividness. The water was boiling,\r\nand everything was prepared, and the sound of his “zuzzoo” had brought\r\nme out upon the verandah. His active little figure was black against\r\nthe autumnal sunset, and to the right the chimneys of his house just\r\nrose above a gloriously tinted group of trees. Remoter rose the Wealden\r\nHills, faint and blue, while to the left the hazy marsh spread out\r\nspacious and serene. And then—\r\n\r\nThe chimneys jerked heavenward, smashing into a string of bricks as\r\nthey rose, and the roof and a miscellany of furniture followed. Then\r\novertaking them came a huge white flame. The trees about the building\r\nswayed and whirled and tore themselves to pieces, that sprang towards\r\nthe flare. My ears were smitten with a clap of thunder that left me\r\ndeaf on one side for life, and all about me windows smashed, unheeded.\r\n\r\nI took three steps from the verandah towards Cavor’s house, and even as\r\nI did so came the wind.\r\n\r\nInstantly my coat tails were over my head, and I was progressing in\r\ngreat leaps and bounds, and quite against my will, towards him. In the\r\nsame moment the discoverer was seized, whirled about, and flew through\r\nthe screaming air. I saw one of my chimney pots hit the ground within\r\nsix yards of me, leap a score of feet, and so hurry in great strides\r\ntowards the focus of the disturbance. Cavor, kicking and flapping, came\r\ndown again, rolled over and over on the ground for a space, struggled\r\nup and was lifted and borne forward at an enormous velocity, vanishing\r\nat last among the labouring, lashing trees that writhed about his\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nA mass of smoke and ashes, and a square of bluish shining substance\r\nrushed up towards the zenith. A large fragment of fencing came sailing\r\npast me, dropped edgeways, hit the ground and fell flat, and then the\r\nworst was over. The aerial commotion fell swiftly until it was a mere\r\nstrong gale, and I became once more aware that I had breath and feet.\r\nBy leaning back against the wind I managed to stop, and could collect\r\nsuch wits as still remained to me.\r\n\r\nIn that instant the whole face of the world had changed. The tranquil\r\nsunset had vanished, the sky was dark with scurrying clouds, everything\r\nwas flattened and swaying with the gale. I glanced back to see if my\r\nbungalow was still in a general way standing, then staggered forwards\r\ntowards the trees amongst which Cavor had vanished, and through whose\r\ntall and leaf-denuded branches shone the flames of his burning house.\r\n\r\nI entered the copse, dashing from one tree to another and clinging to\r\nthem, and for a space I sought him in vain. Then amidst a heap of\r\nsmashed branches and fencing that had banked itself against a portion\r\nof his garden wall I perceived something stir. I made a run for this,\r\nbut before I reached it a brown object separated itself, rose on two\r\nmuddy legs, and protruded two drooping, bleeding hands. Some tattered\r\nends of garment fluttered out from its middle portion and streamed\r\nbefore the wind.\r\n\r\nFor a moment I did not recognise this earthy lump, and then I saw that\r\nit was Cavor, caked in the mud in which he had rolled. He leant forward\r\nagainst the wind, rubbing the dirt from his eyes and mouth.\r\n\r\nHe extended a muddy lump of hand, and staggered a pace towards me. His\r\nface worked with emotion, little lumps of mud kept falling from it. He\r\nlooked as damaged and pitiful as any living creature I have ever seen,\r\nand his remark therefore amazed me exceedingly.\r\n\r\n“Gratulate me,” he gasped; “gratulate me!”\r\n\r\n“Congratulate you!” said I. “Good heavens! What for?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve done it.”\r\n\r\n“You _have_. What on earth caused that explosion?”\r\n\r\nA gust of wind blew his words away. I understood him to say that it\r\nwasn’t an explosion at all. The wind hurled me into collision with him,\r\nand we stood clinging to one another.\r\n\r\n“Try and get back—to my bungalow,” I bawled in his ear. He did not hear\r\nme, and shouted something about “three martyrs—science,” and also\r\nsomething about “not much good.” At the time he laboured under the\r\nimpression that his three attendants had perished in the whirlwind.\r\nHappily this was incorrect. Directly he had left for my bungalow they\r\nhad gone off to the public-house in Lympne to discuss the question of\r\nthe furnaces over some trivial refreshment.\r\n\r\nI repeated my suggestion of getting back to my bungalow, and this time\r\nhe understood. We clung arm-in-arm and started, and managed at last to\r\nreach the shelter of as much roof as was left to me. For a space we sat\r\nin arm-chairs and panted. All the windows were broken, and the lighter\r\narticles of furniture were in great disorder, but no irrevocable damage\r\nwas done. Happily the kitchen door had stood the pressure upon it, so\r\nthat all my crockery and cooking materials had survived. The oil stove\r\nwas still burning, and I put on the water to boil again for tea. And\r\nthat prepared, I could turn on Cavor for his explanation.\r\n\r\n“Quite correct,” he insisted; “quite correct. I’ve done it, and it’s\r\nall right.”\r\n\r\n“But,” I protested. “All right! Why, there can’t be a rick standing, or\r\na fence or a thatched roof undamaged for twenty miles round....”\r\n\r\n“It’s all right—_really_. I didn’t, of course, foresee this little\r\nupset. My mind was preoccupied with another problem, and I’m apt to\r\ndisregard these practical side issues. But it’s all right—”\r\n\r\n“My dear sir,” I cried, “don’t you see you’ve done thousands of pounds’\r\nworth of damage?”\r\n\r\n“There, I throw myself on your discretion. I’m not a practical man, of\r\ncourse, but don’t you think they will regard it as a cyclone?”\r\n\r\n“But the explosion—”\r\n\r\n“It was _not_ an explosion. It’s perfectly simple. Only, as I say, I’m\r\napt to overlook these little things. It’s that zuzzoo business on a\r\nlarger scale. Inadvertently I made this substance of mine, this\r\nCavorite, in a thin, wide sheet....”\r\n\r\nHe paused. “You are quite clear that the stuff is opaque to\r\ngravitation, that it cuts off things from gravitating towards each\r\nother?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said I. “Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, so soon as it reached a temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit,\r\nand the process of its manufacture was complete, the air above it, the\r\nportions of roof and ceiling and floor above it ceased to have weight.\r\nI suppose you know—everybody knows nowadays—that, as a usual thing, the\r\nair _has_ weight, that it presses on everything at the surface of the\r\nearth, presses in all directions, with a pressure of fourteen and a\r\nhalf pounds to the square inch?”\r\n\r\n“I know that,” said I. “Go on.”\r\n\r\n“I know that too,” he remarked. “Only this shows you how useless\r\nknowledge is unless you apply it. You see, over our Cavorite this\r\nceased to be the case, the air there ceased to exert any pressure, and\r\nthe air round it and not over the Cavorite was exerting a pressure of\r\nfourteen pounds and a half to the square inch upon this suddenly\r\nweightless air. Ah! you begin to see! The air all about the Cavorite\r\ncrushed in upon the air above it with irresistible force. The air above\r\nthe Cavorite was forced upward violently, the air that rushed in to\r\nreplace it immediately lost weight, ceased to exert any pressure,\r\nfollowed suit, blew the ceiling through and the roof off....\r\n\r\n“You perceive,” he said, “it formed a sort of atmospheric fountain, a\r\nkind of chimney in the atmosphere. And if the Cavorite itself hadn’t\r\nbeen loose and so got sucked up the chimney, does it occur to you what\r\nwould have happened?”\r\n\r\nI thought. “I suppose,” I said, “the air would be rushing up and up\r\nover that infernal piece of stuff now.”\r\n\r\n“Precisely,” he said. “A huge fountain—”\r\n\r\n“Spouting into space! Good heavens! Why, it would have squirted all the\r\natmosphere of the earth away! It would have robbed the world of air! It\r\nwould have been the death of all mankind! That little lump of stuff!”\r\n\r\n“Not exactly into space,” said Cavor, “but as bad—practically. It would\r\nhave whipped the air off the world as one peels a banana, and flung it\r\nthousands of miles. It would have dropped back again, of course—but on\r\nan asphyxiated world! From our point of view very little better than if\r\nit never came back!”\r\n\r\nI stared. As yet I was too amazed to realise how all my expectations\r\nhad been upset. “What do you mean to do now?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“In the first place if I may borrow a garden trowel I will remove some\r\nof this earth with which I am encased, and then if I may avail myself\r\nof your domestic conveniences I will have a bath. This done, we will\r\nconverse more at leisure. It will be wise, I think”—he laid a muddy\r\nhand on my arm—“if nothing were said of this affair beyond ourselves. I\r\nknow I have caused great damage—probably even dwelling-houses may be\r\nruined here and there upon the country-side. But on the other hand, I\r\ncannot possibly pay for the damage I have done, and if the real cause\r\nof this is published, it will lead only to heartburning and the\r\nobstruction of my work. One cannot foresee _everything_, you know, and\r\nI cannot consent for one moment to add the burthen of practical\r\nconsiderations to my theorising. Later on, when you have come in with\r\nyour practical mind, and Cavorite is floated—floated _is_ the word,\r\nisn’t it?—and it has realised all you anticipate for it, we may set\r\nmatters right with these persons. But not now—not now. If no other\r\nexplanation is offered, people, in the present unsatisfactory state of\r\nmeteorological science, will ascribe all this to a cyclone; there might\r\nbe a public subscription, and as my house has collapsed and been burnt,\r\nI should in that case receive a considerable share in the compensation,\r\nwhich would be extremely helpful to the prosecution of our researches.\r\nBut if it is known that _I_ caused this, there will be no public\r\nsubscription, and everybody will be put out. Practically I should never\r\nget a chance of working in peace again. My three assistants may or may\r\nnot have perished. That is a detail. If they have, it is no great loss;\r\nthey were more zealous than able, and this premature event must be\r\nlargely due to their joint neglect of the furnace. If they have not\r\nperished, I doubt if they have the intelligence to explain the affair.\r\nThey will accept the cyclone story. And if during the temporary\r\nunfitness of my house for occupation, I may lodge in one of the\r\nuntenanted rooms of this bungalow of yours—”\r\n\r\nHe paused and regarded me.\r\n\r\nA man of such possibilities, I reflected, is no ordinary guest to\r\nentertain.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” said I, rising to my feet, “we had better begin by looking\r\nfor a trowel,” and I led the way to the scattered vestiges of the\r\ngreenhouse.\r\n\r\nAnd while he was having his bath I considered the entire question\r\nalone. It was clear there were drawbacks to Mr. Cavor’s society I had\r\nnot foreseen. The absentmindedness that had just escaped depopulating\r\nthe terrestrial globe, might at any moment result in some other grave\r\ninconvenience. On the other hand I was young, my affairs were in a\r\nmess, and I was in just the mood for reckless adventure—with a chance\r\nof something good at the end of it. I had quite settled in my mind that\r\nI was to have half at least in that aspect of the affair. Fortunately I\r\nheld my bungalow, as I have already explained, on a three-year\r\nagreement, without being responsible for repairs; and my furniture,\r\nsuch as there was of it, had been hastily purchased, was unpaid for,\r\ninsured, and altogether devoid of associations. In the end I decided to\r\nkeep on with him, and see the business through.\r\n\r\nCertainly the aspect of things had changed very greatly. I no longer\r\ndoubted at all the enormous possibilities of the substance, but I began\r\nto have doubts about the gun-carriage and the patent boots. We set to\r\nwork at once to reconstruct his laboratory and proceed with our\r\nexperiments. Cavor talked more on my level than he had ever done\r\nbefore, when it came to the question of how we should make the stuff\r\nnext.\r\n\r\n“Of course we must make it again,” he said, with a sort of glee I had\r\nnot expected in him, “of course we must make it again. We have caught a\r\nTartar, perhaps, but we have left the theoretical behind us for good\r\nand all. If we can possibly avoid wrecking this little planet of ours,\r\nwe will. But—there _must_ be risks! There must be. In experimental work\r\nthere always are. And here, as a practical man, _you_ must come in. For\r\nmy own part it seems to me we might make it edgeways, perhaps, and very\r\nthin. Yet I don’t know. I have a certain dim perception of another\r\nmethod. I can hardly explain it yet. But curiously enough it came into\r\nmy mind, while I was rolling over and over in the mud before the wind,\r\nand very doubtful how the whole adventure was to end, as being\r\nabsolutely the thing I ought to have done.”\r\n\r\nEven with my aid we found some little difficulty, and meanwhile we kept\r\nat work restoring the laboratory. There was plenty to do before it\r\nbecame absolutely necessary to decide upon the precise form and method\r\nof our second attempt. Our only hitch was the strike of the three\r\nlabourers, who objected to my activity as a foreman. But that matter we\r\ncompromised after two days’ delay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nThe Building of the sphere\r\n\r\n\r\nI remember the occasion very distinctly when Cavor told me of his idea\r\nof the sphere. He had had intimations of it before, but at the time it\r\nseemed to come to him in a rush. We were returning to the bungalow for\r\ntea, and on the way he fell humming. Suddenly he shouted, “That’s it!\r\nThat finishes it! A sort of roller blind!”\r\n\r\n“Finishes what?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Space—anywhere! The moon.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Mean? Why—it must be a sphere! That’s what I mean!”\r\n\r\nI saw I was out of it, and for a time I let him talk in his own\r\nfashion. I hadn’t the ghost of an idea then of his drift. But after he\r\nhad taken tea he made it clear to me.\r\n\r\n“It’s like this,” he said. “Last time I ran this stuff that cuts things\r\noff from gravitation into a flat tank with an overlap that held it\r\ndown. And directly it had cooled and the manufacture was completed all\r\nthat uproar happened, nothing above it weighed anything, the air went\r\nsquirting up, the house squirted up, and if the stuff itself hadn’t\r\nsquirted up too, I don’t know what would have happened! But suppose the\r\nsubstance is loose, and quite free to go up?”\r\n\r\n“It will go up at once!”\r\n\r\n“Exactly. With no more disturbance than firing a big gun.”\r\n\r\n“But what good will that do?”\r\n\r\n“I’m going up with it!”\r\n\r\nI put down my teacup and stared at him.\r\n\r\n“Imagine a sphere,” he explained, “large enough to hold two people and\r\ntheir luggage. It will be made of steel lined with thick glass; it will\r\ncontain a proper store of solidified air, concentrated food, water\r\ndistilling apparatus, and so forth. And enamelled, as it were, on the\r\nouter steel—”\r\n\r\n“Cavorite?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“But how will you get inside?”\r\n\r\n“There was a similar problem about a dumpling.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know. But how?”\r\n\r\n“That’s perfectly easy. An air-tight manhole is all that is needed.\r\nThat, of course, will have to be a little complicated; there will have\r\nto be a valve, so that things may be thrown out, if necessary, without\r\nmuch loss of air.”\r\n\r\n“Like Jules Verne’s thing in _A Trip to the Moon_.”\r\n\r\nBut Cavor was not a reader of fiction.\r\n\r\n“I begin to see,” I said slowly. “And you could get in and screw\r\nyourself up while the Cavorite was warm, and as soon as it cooled it\r\nwould become impervious to gravitation, and off you would fly—”\r\n\r\n“At a tangent.”\r\n\r\n“You would go off in a straight line—” I stopped abruptly. “What is to\r\nprevent the thing travelling in a straight line into space for ever?” I\r\nasked. “You’re not safe to get anywhere, and if you do—how will you get\r\nback?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve just thought of that,” said Cavor. “That’s what I meant when I\r\nsaid the thing is finished. The inner glass sphere can be air-tight,\r\nand, except for the manhole, continuous, and the steel sphere can be\r\nmade in sections, each section capable of rolling up after the fashion\r\nof a roller blind. These can easily be worked by springs, and released\r\nand checked by electricity conveyed by platinum wires fused through the\r\nglass. All that is merely a question of detail. So you see, that except\r\nfor the thickness of the blind rollers, the Cavorite exterior of the\r\nsphere will consist of windows or blinds, whichever you like to call\r\nthem. Well, when all these windows or blinds are shut, no light, no\r\nheat, no gravitation, no radiant energy of any sort will get at the\r\ninside of the sphere, it will fly on through space in a straight line,\r\nas you say. But open a window, imagine one of the windows open. Then at\r\nonce any heavy body that chances to be in that direction will attract\r\nus—”\r\n\r\nI sat taking it in.\r\n\r\n“You see?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I _see_.”\r\n\r\n“Practically we shall be able to tack about in space just as we wish.\r\nGet attracted by this and that.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes. _That’s_ clear enough. Only—”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t quite see what we shall do it for! It’s really only jumping\r\noff the world and back again.”\r\n\r\n“Surely! For example, one might go to the moon.”\r\n\r\n“And when one got there? What would you find?”\r\n\r\n“We should see—Oh! consider the new knowledge.”\r\n\r\n“Is there air there?”\r\n\r\n“There may be.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a fine idea,” I said, “but it strikes me as a large order all the\r\nsame. The moon! I’d much rather try some smaller things first.”\r\n\r\n“They’re out of the question, because of the air difficulty.”\r\n\r\n“Why not apply that idea of spring blinds—Cavorite blinds in strong\r\nsteel cases—to lifting weights?”\r\n\r\n“It wouldn’t work,” he insisted. “After all, to go into outer space is\r\nnot so much worse, if at all, than a polar expedition. Men go on polar\r\nexpeditions.”\r\n\r\n“Not business men. And besides, they get paid for polar expeditions.\r\nAnd if anything goes wrong there are relief parties. But this—it’s just\r\nfiring ourselves off the world for nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Call it prospecting.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll have to call it that.... One might make a book of it perhaps,”\r\nI said.\r\n\r\n“I have no doubt there will be minerals,” said Cavor.\r\n\r\n“For example?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! sulphur, ores, gold perhaps, possibly new elements.”\r\n\r\n“Cost of carriage,” I said. “You know you’re _not_ a practical man. The\r\nmoon’s a quarter of a million miles away.”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me it wouldn’t cost much to cart any weight anywhere if\r\nyou packed it in a Cavorite case.”\r\n\r\nI had not thought of that. “Delivered free on head of purchaser, eh?”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t as though we were confined to the moon.”\r\n\r\n“You mean?”\r\n\r\n“There’s Mars—clear atmosphere, novel surroundings, exhilarating sense\r\nof lightness. It might be pleasant to go there.”\r\n\r\n“Is there air on Mars?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes!”\r\n\r\n“Seems as though you might run it as a sanatorium. By the way, how far\r\nis Mars?”\r\n\r\n“Two hundred million miles at present,” said Cavor airily; “and you go\r\nclose by the sun.”\r\n\r\nMy imagination was picking itself up again. “After all,” I said,\r\n“there’s something in these things. There’s travel—”\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary possibility came rushing into my mind. Suddenly I saw,\r\nas in a vision, the whole solar system threaded with Cavorite liners\r\nand spheres _de luxe_. “Rights of pre-emption,” came floating into my\r\nhead—planetary rights of pre-emption. I recalled the old Spanish\r\nmonopoly in American gold. It wasn’t as though it was just this planet\r\nor that—it was all of them. I stared at Cavor’s rubicund face, and\r\nsuddenly my imagination was leaping and dancing. I stood up, I walked\r\nup and down; my tongue was unloosened.\r\n\r\n“I’m beginning to take it in,” I said; “I’m beginning to take it in.”\r\nThe transition from doubt to enthusiasm seemed to take scarcely any\r\ntime at all. “But this is tremendous!” I cried. “This is Imperial! I\r\nhaven’t been dreaming of this sort of thing.”\r\n\r\nOnce the chill of my opposition was removed, his own pent-up excitement\r\nhad play. He too got up and paced. He too gesticulated and shouted. We\r\nbehaved like men inspired. We _were_ men inspired.\r\n\r\n“We’ll settle all that!” he said in answer to some incidental\r\ndifficulty that had pulled me up. “We’ll soon settle that! We’ll start\r\nthe drawings for mouldings this very night.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll start them now,” I responded, and we hurried off to the\r\nlaboratory to begin upon this work forthwith.\r\n\r\nI was like a child in Wonderland all that night. The dawn found us both\r\nstill at work—we kept our electric light going heedless of the day. I\r\nremember now exactly how these drawings looked. I shaded and tinted\r\nwhile Cavor drew—smudged and haste-marked they were in every line, but\r\nwonderfully correct. We got out the orders for the steel blinds and\r\nframes we needed from that night’s work, and the glass sphere was\r\ndesigned within a week. We gave up our afternoon conversations and our\r\nold routine altogether. We worked, and we slept and ate when we could\r\nwork no longer for hunger and fatigue. Our enthusiasm infected even our\r\nthree men, though they had no idea what the sphere was for. Through\r\nthose days the man Gibbs gave up walking, and went everywhere, even\r\nacross the room, at a sort of fussy run.\r\n\r\nAnd it grew—the sphere. December passed, January—I spent a day with a\r\nbroom sweeping a path through the snow from bungalow to\r\nlaboratory—February, March. By the end of March the completion was in\r\nsight. In January had come a team of horses, a huge packing-case; we\r\nhad our thick glass sphere now ready, and in position under the crane\r\nwe had rigged to sling it into the steel shell. All the bars and blinds\r\nof the steel shell—it was not really a spherical shell, but polyhedral,\r\nwith a roller blind to each facet—had arrived by February, and the\r\nlower half was bolted together. The Cavorite was half made by March,\r\nthe metallic paste had gone through two of the stages in its\r\nmanufacture, and we had plastered quite half of it on to the steel bars\r\nand blinds. It was astonishing how closely we kept to the lines of\r\nCavor’s first inspiration in working out the scheme. When the bolting\r\ntogether of the sphere was finished, he proposed to remove the rough\r\nroof of the temporary laboratory in which the work was done, and build\r\na furnace about it. So the last stage of Cavorite making, in which the\r\npaste is heated to a dull red glow in a stream of helium, would be\r\naccomplished when it was already on the sphere.\r\n\r\nAnd then we had to discuss and decide what provisions we were to\r\ntake—compressed foods, concentrated essences, steel cylinders\r\ncontaining reserve oxygen, an arrangement for removing carbonic acid\r\nand waste from the air and restoring oxygen by means of sodium\r\nperoxide, water condensers, and so forth. I remember the little heap\r\nthey made in the corner—tins, and rolls, and boxes—convincingly\r\nmatter-of-fact.\r\n\r\nIt was a strenuous time, with little chance of thinking. But one day,\r\nwhen we were drawing near the end, an odd mood came over me. I had been\r\nbricking up the furnace all the morning, and I sat down by these\r\npossessions dead beat. Everything seemed dull and incredible.\r\n\r\n“But look here, Cavor,” I said. “After all! What’s it all for?”\r\n\r\nHe smiled. “The thing now is to go.”\r\n\r\n“The moon,” I reflected. “But what do you expect? I thought the moon\r\nwas a dead world.”\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“We’re going to see.”\r\n\r\n“_Are_ we?” I said, and stared before me.\r\n\r\n“You are tired,” he remarked. “You’d better take a walk this\r\nafternoon.”\r\n\r\n“No,” I said obstinately; “I’m going to finish this brickwork.”\r\n\r\nAnd I did, and insured myself a night of insomnia. I don’t think I have\r\never had such a night. I had some bad times before my business\r\ncollapse, but the very worst of those was sweet slumber compared to\r\nthis infinity of aching wakefulness. I was suddenly in the most\r\nenormous funk at the thing we were going to do.\r\n\r\nI do not remember before that night thinking at all of the risks we\r\nwere running. Now they came like that array of spectres that once\r\nbeleaguered Prague, and camped around me. The strangeness of what we\r\nwere about to do, the unearthliness of it, overwhelmed me. I was like a\r\nman awakened out of pleasant dreams to the most horrible surroundings.\r\nI lay, eyes wide open, and the sphere seemed to get more flimsy and\r\nfeeble, and Cavor more unreal and fantastic, and the whole enterprise\r\nmadder and madder every moment.\r\n\r\nI got out of bed and wandered about. I sat at the window and stared at\r\nthe immensity of space. Between the stars was the void, the\r\nunfathomable darkness! I tried to recall the fragmentary knowledge of\r\nastronomy I had gained in my irregular reading, but it was all too\r\nvague to furnish any idea of the things we might expect. At last I got\r\nback to bed and snatched some moments of sleep—moments of nightmare\r\nrather—in which I fell and fell and fell for evermore into the abyss of\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\nI astonished Cavor at breakfast. I told him shortly, “I’m not coming\r\nwith you in the sphere.”\r\n\r\nI met all his protests with a sullen persistence. “The thing’s too\r\nmad,” I said, “and I won’t come. The thing’s too mad.”\r\n\r\nI would not go with him to the laboratory. I fretted about my bungalow\r\nfor a time, and then took hat and stick and set out alone, I knew not\r\nwhither. It chanced to be a glorious morning: a warm wind and deep blue\r\nsky, the first green of spring abroad, and multitudes of birds singing.\r\nI lunched on beef and beer in a little public-house near Elham, and\r\nstartled the landlord by remarking _apropos_ of the weather, “A man who\r\nleaves the world when days of this sort are about is a fool!”\r\n\r\n“That’s what I says when I heerd on it!” said the landlord, and I found\r\nthat for one poor soul at least this world had proved excessive, and\r\nthere had been a throat-cutting. I went on with a new twist to my\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I had a pleasant sleep in a sunny place, and went on\r\nmy way refreshed.\r\n\r\nI came to a comfortable-looking inn near Canterbury. It was bright with\r\ncreepers, and the landlady was a clean old woman and took my eye. I\r\nfound I had just enough money to pay for my lodging with her. I decided\r\nto stop the night there. She was a talkative body, and among many other\r\nparticulars I learnt she had never been to London. “Canterbury’s as far\r\nas ever I been,” she said. “I’m not one of your gad-about sort.”\r\n\r\n“How would you like a trip to the moon?” I cried.\r\n\r\n“I never did hold with them ballooneys,” she said evidently under the\r\nimpression that this was a common excursion enough. “I wouldn’t go up\r\nin one—not for ever so.”\r\n\r\nThis struck me as being funny. After I had supped I sat on a bench by\r\nthe door of the inn and gossiped with two labourers about brickmaking,\r\nand motor cars, and the cricket of last year. And in the sky a faint\r\nnew crescent, blue and vague as a distant Alp, sank westward over the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nThe next day I returned to Cavor. “I am coming,” I said. “I’ve been a\r\nlittle out of order, that’s all.”\r\n\r\nThat was the only time I felt any serious doubt our enterprise. Nerves\r\npurely! After that I worked a little more carefully, and took a trudge\r\nfor an hour every day. And at last, save for the heating in the\r\nfurnace, our labours were at an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\nInside the Sphere\r\n\r\n\r\n“Go on,” said Cavor, as I sat across the edge of the manhole, and\r\nlooked down into the black interior of the sphere. We two were alone.\r\nIt was evening, the sun had set, and the stillness of the twilight was\r\nupon everything.\r\n\r\nI drew my other leg inside and slid down the smooth glass to the bottom\r\nof the sphere, then turned to take the cans of food and other\r\nimpedimenta from Cavor. The interior was warm, the thermometer stood at\r\neighty, and as we should lose little or none of this by radiation, we\r\nwere dressed in shoes and thin flannels. We had, however, a bundle of\r\nthick woollen clothing and several thick blankets to guard against\r\nmischance.\r\n\r\nBy Cavor’s direction I placed the packages, the cylinders of oxygen,\r\nand so forth, loosely about my feet, and soon we had everything in. He\r\nwalked about the roofless shed for a time seeking anything we had\r\noverlooked, and then crawled in after me. I noted something in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“What have you got there?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Haven’t you brought anything to read?”\r\n\r\n“Good Lord! No.”\r\n\r\n“I forgot to tell you. There are uncertainties— The voyage may last— We\r\nmay be weeks!”\r\n\r\n“But—”\r\n\r\n“We shall be floating in this sphere with absolutely no occupation.”\r\n\r\n“I wish I’d known—”\r\n\r\nHe peered out of the manhole. “Look!” he said. “There’s something\r\nthere!”\r\n\r\n“Is there time?”\r\n\r\n“We shall be an hour.”\r\n\r\nI looked out. It was an old number of _Tit-Bits_ that one of the men\r\nmust have brought. Farther away in the corner I saw a torn _Lloyd’s\r\nNews_. I scrambled back into the sphere with these things. “What have\r\nyou got?” I said.\r\n\r\nI took the book from his hand and read, “The Works of William\r\nShakespeare”.\r\n\r\nHe coloured slightly. “My education has been so purely scientific—” he\r\nsaid apologetically.\r\n\r\n“Never read him?”\r\n\r\n“Never.”\r\n\r\n“He knew a little, you know—in an irregular sort of way.”\r\n\r\n“Precisely what I am told,” said Cavor.\r\n\r\nI assisted him to screw in the glass cover of the manhole, and then he\r\npressed a stud to close the corresponding blind in the outer case. The\r\nlittle oblong of twilight vanished. We were in darkness. For a time\r\nneither of us spoke. Although our case would not be impervious to\r\nsound, everything was very still. I perceived there was nothing to grip\r\nwhen the shock of our start should come, and I realised that I should\r\nbe uncomfortable for want of a chair.\r\n\r\n“Why have we no chairs?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“I’ve settled all that,” said Cavor. “We won’t need them.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“You will see,” he said, in the tone of a man who refuses to talk.\r\n\r\nI became silent. Suddenly it had come to me clear and vivid that I was\r\na fool to be inside that sphere. Even now, I asked myself, is to too\r\nlate to withdraw? The world outside the sphere, I knew, would be cold\r\nand inhospitable enough for me—for weeks I had been living on subsidies\r\nfrom Cavor—but after all, would it be as cold as the infinite zero, as\r\ninhospitable as empty space? If it had not been for the appearance of\r\ncowardice, I believe that even then I should have made him let me out.\r\nBut I hesitated on that score, and hesitated, and grew fretful and\r\nangry, and the time passed.\r\n\r\nThere came a little jerk, a noise like champagne being uncorked in\r\nanother room, and a faint whistling sound. For just one instant I had a\r\nsense of enormous tension, a transient conviction that my feet were\r\npressing downward with a force of countless tons. It lasted for an\r\ninfinitesimal time.\r\n\r\nBut it stirred me to action. “Cavor!” I said into the darkness, “my\r\nnerve’s in rags. I don’t think—”\r\n\r\nI stopped. He made no answer.\r\n\r\n“Confound it!” I cried; “I’m a fool! What business have I here? I’m not\r\ncoming, Cavor. The thing’s too risky. I’m getting out.”\r\n\r\n“You can’t,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Can’t! We’ll soon see about that!”\r\n\r\nHe made no answer for ten seconds. “It’s too late for us to quarrel\r\nnow, Bedford,” he said. “That little jerk was the start. Already we are\r\nflying as swiftly as a bullet up into the gulf of space.”\r\n\r\n“I—” I said, and then it didn’t seem to matter what happened. For a\r\ntime I was, as it were, stunned; I had nothing to say. It was just as\r\nif I had never heard of this idea of leaving the world before. Then I\r\nperceived an unaccountable change in my bodily sensations. It was a\r\nfeeling of lightness, of unreality. Coupled with that was a queer\r\nsensation in the head, an apoplectic effect almost, and a thumping of\r\nblood vessels at the ears. Neither of these feelings diminished as time\r\nwent on, but at last I got so used to them that I experienced no\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\nI heard a click, and a little glow lamp came into being.\r\n\r\nI saw Cavor’s face, as white as I felt my own to be. We regarded one\r\nanother in silence. The transparent blackness of the glass behind him\r\nmade him seem as though he floated in a void.\r\n\r\n“Well, we’re committed,” I said at last.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, “we’re committed.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t move,” he exclaimed, at some suggestion of a gesture. “Let your\r\nmuscles keep quite lax—as if you were in bed. We are in a little\r\nuniverse of our own. Look at those things!”\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the loose cases and bundles that had been lying on the\r\nblankets in the bottom of the sphere. I was astonished to see that they\r\nwere floating now nearly a foot from the spherical wall. Then I saw\r\nfrom his shadow that Cavor was no longer leaning against the glass. I\r\nthrust out my hand behind me, and found that I too was suspended in\r\nspace, clear of the glass.\r\n\r\nI did not cry out nor gesticulate, but fear came upon me. It was like\r\nbeing held and lifted by something—you know not what. The mere touch of\r\nmy hand against the glass moved me rapidly. I understood what had\r\nhappened, but that did not prevent my being afraid. We were cut off\r\nfrom all exterior gravitation, only the attraction of objects within\r\nour sphere had effect. Consequently everything that was not fixed to\r\nthe glass was falling—slowly because of the slightness of our\r\nmasses—towards the centre of gravity of our little world, which seemed\r\nto be somewhere about the middle of the sphere, but rather nearer to\r\nmyself than Cavor, on account of my greater weight.\r\n\r\n“We must turn round,” said Cavor, “and float back to back, with the\r\nthings between us.”\r\n\r\nIt was the strangest sensation conceivable, floating thus loosely in\r\nspace, at first indeed horribly strange, and when the horror passed,\r\nnot disagreeable at all, exceeding restful; indeed, the nearest thing\r\nin earthly experience to it that I know is lying on a very thick, soft\r\nfeather bed. But the quality of utter detachment and independence! I\r\nhad not reckoned on things like this. I had expected a violent jerk at\r\nstarting, a giddy sense of speed. Instead I felt—as if I were\r\ndisembodied. It was not like the beginning of a journey; it was like\r\nthe beginning of a dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\nThe Journey to the Moon\r\n\r\n\r\nPresently Cavor extinguished the light. He said we had not overmuch\r\nenergy stored, and that what we had we must economise for reading. For\r\na time, whether it was long or short I do not know, there was nothing\r\nbut blank darkness.\r\n\r\nA question floated up out of the void. “How are we pointing?” I said.\r\n“What is our direction?”\r\n\r\n“We are flying away from the earth at a tangent, and as the moon is\r\nnear her third quarter we are going somewhere towards her. I will open\r\na blind—”\r\n\r\nCame a click, and then a window in the outer case yawned open. The sky\r\noutside was as black as the darkness within the sphere, but the shape\r\nof the open window was marked by an infinite number of stars.\r\n\r\nThose who have only seen the starry sky from the earth cannot imagine\r\nits appearance when the vague, half luminous veil of our air has been\r\nwithdrawn. The stars we see on earth are the mere scattered survivors\r\nthat penetrate our misty atmosphere. But now at last I could realise\r\nthe meaning of the hosts of heaven!\r\n\r\nStranger things we were presently to see, but that airless, star-dusted\r\nsky! Of all things, I think that will be one of the last I shall\r\nforget.\r\n\r\nThe little window vanished with a click, another beside it snapped open\r\nand instantly closed, and then a third, and for a moment I had to close\r\nmy eyes because of the blinding splendour of the waning moon.\r\n\r\nFor a space I had to stare at Cavor and the white-lit things about me\r\nto season my eyes to light again, before I could turn them towards that\r\npallid glare.\r\n\r\nFour windows were open in order that the gravitation of the moon might\r\nact upon all the substances in our sphere. I found I was no longer\r\nfloating freely in space, but that my feet were resting on the glass in\r\nthe direction of the moon. The blankets and cases of provisions were\r\nalso creeping slowly down the glass, and presently came to rest so as\r\nto block out a portion of the view. It seemed to me, of course, that I\r\nlooked “down” when I looked at the moon. On earth “down” means\r\nearthward, the way things fall, and “up” the reverse direction. Now the\r\npull of gravitation was towards the moon, and for all I knew to the\r\ncontrary our earth was overhead. And, of course, when all the Cavorite\r\nblinds were closed, “down” was towards the centre of our sphere, and\r\n“up” towards its outer wall.\r\n\r\nIt was curiously unlike earthly experience, too, to have the light\r\ncoming _up_ to one. On earth light falls from above, or comes slanting\r\ndown sideways, but here it came from beneath our feet, and to see our\r\nshadows we had to look up.\r\n\r\nAt first it gave me a sort of vertigo to stand only on thick glass and\r\nlook down upon the moon through hundreds of thousands of miles of\r\nvacant space; but this sickness passed very speedily. And then—the\r\nsplendour of the sight!\r\n\r\nThe reader may imagine it best if he will lie on the ground some warm\r\nsummer’s night and look between his upraised feet at the moon, but for\r\nsome reason, probably because the absence of air made it so much more\r\nluminous, the moon seemed already considerably larger than it does from\r\nearth. The minutest details of its surface were acutely clear. And\r\nsince we did not see it through air, its outline was bright and sharp,\r\nthere was no glow or halo about it, and the star-dust that covered the\r\nsky came right to its very margin, and marked the outline of its\r\nunilluminated part. And as I stood and stared at the moon between my\r\nfeet, that perception of the impossible that had been with me off and\r\non ever since our start, returned again with tenfold conviction.\r\n\r\n“Cavor,” I said, “this takes me queerly. Those companies we were going\r\nto run, and all that about minerals?”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see ‘em here.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Cavor; “but you’ll get over all that.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose I’m made to turn right side up again. Still, _this_— For a\r\nmoment I could half believe there never was a world.”\r\n\r\n“That copy of _Lloyd’s News_ might help you.”\r\n\r\nI stared at the paper for a moment, then held it above the level of my\r\nface, and found I could read it quite easily. I struck a column of mean\r\nlittle advertisements. “A gentleman of private means is willing to lend\r\nmoney,” I read. I knew that gentleman. Then somebody eccentric wanted\r\nto sell a Cutaway bicycle, “quite new and cost £15,” for five pounds;\r\nand a lady in distress wished to dispose of some fish knives and forks,\r\n“a wedding present,” at a great sacrifice. No doubt some simple soul\r\nwas sagely examining these knives and forks, and another triumphantly\r\nriding off on that bicycle, and a third trustfully consulting that\r\nbenevolent gentleman of means even as I read. I laughed, and let the\r\npaper drift from my hand.\r\n\r\n“Are we visible from the earth?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“I knew some one who was rather interested in astronomy. It occurred to\r\nme that it would be rather odd if—my friend—chanced to be looking\r\nthrough some telescope.”\r\n\r\n“It would need the most powerful telescope on earth even now to see us\r\nas the minutest speck.”\r\n\r\nFor a time I stared in silence at the moon.\r\n\r\n“It’s a world,” I said; “one feels that infinitely more than one ever\r\ndid on earth. People perhaps—”\r\n\r\n“People!” he exclaimed. “_No!_ Banish all that! Think yourself a sort\r\nof ultra-arctic voyager exploring the desolate places of space. Look at\r\nit!”\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand at the shining whiteness below. “It’s dead—dead! Vast\r\nextinct volcanoes, lava wildernesses, tumbled wastes of snow, or frozen\r\ncarbonic acid, or frozen air, and everywhere landslip seams and cracks\r\nand gulfs. Nothing happens. Men have watched this planet systematically\r\nwith telescopes for over two hundred years. How much change do you\r\nthink they have seen?”\r\n\r\n“None.”\r\n\r\n“They have traced two indisputable landslips, a doubtful crack, and one\r\nslight periodic change of colour, and that’s all.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know they’d traced even that.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes. But as for people—!”\r\n\r\n“By the way,” I asked, “how small a thing will the biggest telescopes\r\nshow upon the moon?”\r\n\r\n“One could see a fair-sized church. One could certainly see any towns\r\nor buildings, or anything like the handiwork of men. There might\r\nperhaps be insects, something in the way of ants, for example, so that\r\nthey could hide in deep burrows from the lunar light, or some new sort\r\nof creatures having no earthly parallel. That is the most probable\r\nthing, if we are to find life there at all. Think of the difference in\r\nconditions! Life must fit itself to a day as long as fourteen earthly\r\ndays, a cloudless sun-blaze of fourteen days, and then a night of equal\r\nlength, growing ever colder and colder under these cold, sharp stars.\r\nIn that night there must be cold, the ultimate cold, absolute zero,\r\n273° C. below the earthly freezing point. Whatever life there is must\r\nhibernate through _that_, and rise again each day.”\r\n\r\nHe mused. “One can imagine something worm-like,” he said, “taking its\r\nair solid as an earth-worm swallows earth, or thick-skinned monsters—”\r\n\r\n“By the bye,” I said, “why didn’t we bring a gun?”\r\n\r\nHe did not answer that question. “No,” he concluded, “we just have to\r\ngo. We shall see when we get there.”\r\n\r\nI remembered something. “Of course, there’s my minerals, anyhow,” I\r\nsaid; “whatever the conditions may be.”\r\n\r\nPresently he told me he wished to alter our course a little by letting\r\nthe earth tug at us for a moment. He was going to open one earthward\r\nblind for thirty seconds. He warned me that it would make my head swim,\r\nand advised me to extend my hands against the glass to break my fall. I\r\ndid as he directed, and thrust my feet against the bales of food cases\r\nand air cylinders to prevent their falling upon me. Then with a click\r\nthe window flew open. I fell clumsily upon hands and face, and saw for\r\na moment between my black extended fingers our mother earth—a planet in\r\na downward sky.\r\n\r\nWe were still very near—Cavor told me the distance was perhaps eight\r\nhundred miles and the huge terrestrial disc filled all heaven. But\r\nalready it was plain to see that the world was a globe. The land below\r\nus was in twilight and vague, but westward the vast grey stretches of\r\nthe Atlantic shone like molten silver under the receding day. I think I\r\nrecognised the cloud-dimmed coast-lines of France and Spain and the\r\nsouth of England, and then, with a click, the shutter closed again, and\r\nI found myself in a state of extraordinary confusion sliding slowly\r\nover the smooth glass.\r\n\r\nWhen at last things settled themselves in my mind again, it seemed\r\nquite beyond question that the moon was “down” and under my feet, and\r\nthat the earth was somewhere away on the level of the horizon—the earth\r\nthat had been “down” to me and my kindred since the beginning of\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nSo slight were the exertions required of us, so easy did the practical\r\nannihilation of our weight make all we had to do, that the necessity\r\nfor taking refreshment did not occur to us for nearly six hours (by\r\nCavor’s chronometer) after our start. I was amazed at that lapse of\r\ntime. Even then I was satisfied with very little. Cavor examined the\r\napparatus for absorbing carbonic acid and water, and pronounced it to\r\nbe in satisfactory order, our consumption of oxygen having been\r\nextraordinarily slight. And our talk being exhausted for the time, and\r\nthere being nothing further for us to do, we gave way to a curious\r\ndrowsiness that had come upon us, and spreading our blankets on the\r\nbottom of the sphere in such a manner as to shut out most of the\r\nmoonlight, wished each other good-night, and almost immediately fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nAnd so, sleeping, and sometimes talking and reading a little, and at\r\ntimes eating, although without any keenness of appetite,[1] but for the\r\nmost part in a sort of quiescence that was neither waking nor slumber,\r\nwe fell through a space of time that had neither night nor day in it,\r\nsilently, softly, and swiftly down towards the moon.\r\n\r\n [1] It is a curious thing, that while we were in the sphere we felt\r\n not the slightest desire for food, nor did we feel the want of it when\r\n we abstained. At first we forced our appetites, but afterwards we\r\n fasted completely. Altogether we did not consume one-hundredth part of\r\n the compressed provisions we had brought with us. The amount of\r\n carbonic acid we breathed was also unnaturally low, but why this was,\r\n I am quite unable to explain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\nThe Landing on the Moon\r\n\r\n\r\nI remember how one day Cavor suddenly opened six of our shutters and\r\nblinded me so that I cried aloud at him. The whole area was moon, a\r\nstupendous scimitar of white dawn with its edge hacked out by notches\r\nof darkness, the crescent shore of an ebbing tide of darkness, out of\r\nwhich peaks and pinnacles came glittering into the blaze of the sun. I\r\ntake it the reader has seen pictures or photographs of the moon and\r\nthat I need not describe the broader features of that landscape, those\r\nspacious ring-like ranges vaster than any terrestrial mountains, their\r\nsummits shining in the day, their shadows harsh and deep, the grey\r\ndisordered plains, the ridges, hills, and craterlets, all passing at\r\nlast from a blazing illumination into a common mystery of black.\r\nAthwart this world we were flying scarcely a hundred miles above its\r\ncrests and pinnacles. And now we could see, what no eye on earth will\r\never see, that under the blaze of the day the harsh outlines of the\r\nrocks and ravines of the plains and crater floor grew grey and\r\nindistinct under a thickening haze, that the white of their lit\r\nsurfaces broke into lumps and patches, and broke again and shrank and\r\nvanished, and that here and there strange tints of brown and olive grew\r\nand spread.\r\n\r\nBut little time we had for watching then. For now we had come to the\r\nreal danger of our journey. We had to drop ever closer to the moon as\r\nwe spun about it, to slacken our pace and watch our chance, until at\r\nlast we could dare to drop upon its surface.\r\n\r\nFor Cavor that was a time of intense exertion; for me it was an anxious\r\ninactivity. I seemed perpetually to be getting out of his way. He leapt\r\nabout the sphere from point to point with an agility that would have\r\nbeen impossible on earth. He was perpetually opening and closing the\r\nCavorite windows, making calculations, consulting his chronometer by\r\nmeans of the glow lamp during those last eventful hours. For a long\r\ntime we had all our windows closed and hung silently in darkness\r\nhurling through space.\r\n\r\nThen he was feeling for the shutter studs, and suddenly four windows\r\nwere open. I staggered and covered my eyes, drenched and scorched and\r\nblinded by the unaccustomed splendour of the sun beneath my feet. Then\r\nagain the shutters snapped, leaving my brain spinning in a darkness\r\nthat pressed against the eyes. And after that I floated in another\r\nvast, black silence.\r\n\r\nThen Cavor switched on the electric light, and told me he proposed to\r\nbind all our luggage together with the blankets about it, against the\r\nconcussion of our descent. We did this with our windows closed, because\r\nin that way our goods arranged themselves naturally at the centre of\r\nthe sphere. That too was a strange business; we two men floating loose\r\nin that spherical space, and packing and pulling ropes. Imagine it if\r\nyou can! No up nor down, and every effort resulting in unexpected\r\nmovements. Now I would be pressed against the glass with the full force\r\nof Cavor’s thrust, now I would be kicking helplessly in a void. Now the\r\nstar of the electric light would be overhead, now under foot. Now\r\nCavor’s feet would float up before my eyes, and now we would be\r\ncrossways to each other. But at last our goods were safely bound\r\ntogether in a big soft bale, all except two blankets with head holes\r\nthat we were to wrap about ourselves.\r\n\r\nThen for a flash Cavor opened a window moonward, and we saw that we\r\nwere dropping towards a huge central crater with a number of minor\r\ncraters grouped in a sort of cross about it. And then again Cavor flung\r\nour little sphere open to the scorching, blinding sun. I think he was\r\nusing the sun’s attraction as a brake. “Cover yourself with a blanket,”\r\nhe cried, thrusting himself from me, and for a moment I did not\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nThen I hauled the blanket from beneath my feet and got it about me and\r\nover my head and eyes. Abruptly he closed the shutters again, snapped\r\none open again and closed it, then suddenly began snapping them all\r\nopen, each safely into its steel roller. There came a jar, and then we\r\nwere rolling over and over, bumping against the glass and against the\r\nbig bale of our luggage, and clutching at each other, and outside some\r\nwhite substance splashed as if we were rolling down a slope of snow....\r\n\r\nOver, clutch, bump, clutch, bump, over....\r\n\r\nCame a thud, and I was half buried under the bale of our possessions,\r\nand for a space everything was still. Then I could hear Cavor puffing\r\nand grunting, and the snapping of a shutter in its sash. I made an\r\neffort, thrust back our blanket-wrapped luggage, and emerged from\r\nbeneath it. Our open windows were just visible as a deeper black set\r\nwith stars.\r\n\r\nWe were still alive, and we were lying in the darkness of the shadow of\r\nthe wall of the great crater into which we had fallen.\r\n\r\nWe sat getting our breath again, and feeling the bruises on our limbs.\r\nI don’t think either of us had had a very clear expectation of such\r\nrough handling as we had received. I struggled painfully to my feet.\r\n“And now,” said I, “to look at the landscape of the moon! But—! It’s\r\ntremendously dark, Cavor!”\r\n\r\nThe glass was dewy, and as I spoke I wiped at it with my blanket.\r\n“We’re half an hour or so beyond the day,” he said. “We must wait.”\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to distinguish anything. We might have been in a\r\nsphere of steel for all that we could see. My rubbing with the blanket\r\nsimply smeared the glass, and as fast as I wiped it, it became opaque\r\nagain with freshly condensed moisture mixed with an increasing quantity\r\nof blanket hairs. Of course I ought not to have used the blanket. In my\r\nefforts to clear the glass I slipped upon the damp surface, and hurt my\r\nshin against one of the oxygen cylinders that protruded from our bale.\r\n\r\nThe thing was exasperating—it was absurd. Here we were just arrived\r\nupon the moon, amidst we knew not what wonders, and all we could see\r\nwas the grey and streaming wall of the bubble in which we had come.\r\n\r\n“Confound it!” I said, “but at this rate we might have stopped at\r\nhome;” and I squatted on the bale and shivered, and drew my blanket\r\ncloser about me.\r\n\r\nAbruptly the moisture turned to spangles and fronds of frost. “Can you\r\nreach the electric heater,” said Cavor. “Yes—that black knob. Or we\r\nshall freeze.”\r\n\r\nI did not wait to be told twice. “And now,” said I, “what are we to\r\ndo?”\r\n\r\n“Wait,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Wait?”\r\n\r\n“Of course. We shall have to wait until our air gets warm again, and\r\nthen this glass will clear. We can’t do anything till then. It’s night\r\nhere yet; we must wait for the day to overtake us. Meanwhile, don’t you\r\nfeel hungry?”\r\n\r\nFor a space I did not answer him, but sat fretting. I turned\r\nreluctantly from the smeared puzzle of the glass and stared at his\r\nface. “Yes,” I said, “I am hungry. I feel somehow enormously\r\ndisappointed. I had expected—I don’t know what I had expected, but not\r\nthis.”\r\n\r\nI summoned my philosophy, and rearranging my blanket about me sat down\r\non the bale again and began my first meal on the moon. I don’t think I\r\nfinished it—I forget. Presently, first in patches, then running rapidly\r\ntogether into wider spaces, came the clearing of the glass, came the\r\ndrawing of the misty veil that hid the moon world from our eyes.\r\n\r\nWe peered out upon the landscape of the moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\nSunrise on the Moon\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we saw it first it was the wildest and most desolate of scenes. We\r\nwere in an enormous amphitheatre, a vast circular plain, the floor of\r\nthe giant crater. Its cliff-like walls closed us in on every side. From\r\nthe westward the light of the unseen sun fell upon them, reaching to\r\nthe very foot of the cliff, and showed a disordered escarpment of drab\r\nand greyish rock, lined here and there with banks and crevices of snow.\r\nThis was perhaps a dozen miles away, but at first no intervening\r\natmosphere diminished in the slightest the minutely detailed brilliancy\r\nwith which these things glared at us. They stood out clear and dazzling\r\nagainst a background of starry blackness that seemed to our earthly\r\neyes rather a gloriously spangled velvet curtain than the spaciousness\r\nof the sky.\r\n\r\nThe eastward cliff was at first merely a starless selvedge to the\r\nstarry dome. No rosy flush, no creeping pallor, announced the\r\ncommencing day. Only the Corona, the Zodiacal light, a huge\r\ncone-shaped, luminous haze, pointing up towards the splendour of the\r\nmorning star, warned us of the imminent nearness of the sun.\r\n\r\nWhatever light was about us was reflected by the westward cliffs. It\r\nshowed a huge undulating plain, cold and grey, a grey that deepened\r\neastward into the absolute raven darkness of the cliff shadow.\r\nInnumerable rounded grey summits, ghostly hummocks, billows of snowy\r\nsubstance, stretching crest beyond crest into the remote obscurity,\r\ngave us our first inkling of the distance of the crater wall. These\r\nhummocks looked like snow. At the time I thought they were snow. But\r\nthey were not—they were mounds and masses of frozen air.\r\n\r\nSo it was at first; and then, sudden, swift, and amazing, came the\r\nlunar day.\r\n\r\nThe sunlight had crept down the cliff, it touched the drifted masses at\r\nits base and incontinently came striding with seven-leagued boots\r\ntowards us. The distant cliff seemed to shift and quiver, and at the\r\ntouch of the dawn a reek of grey vapour poured upward from the crater\r\nfloor, whirls and puffs and drifting wraiths of grey, thicker and\r\nbroader and denser, until at last the whole westward plain was steaming\r\nlike a wet handkerchief held before the fire, and the westward cliffs\r\nwere no more than refracted glare beyond.\r\n\r\n“It is air,” said Cavor. “It must be air—or it would not rise like\r\nthis—at the mere touch of a sun-beam. And at this pace....”\r\n\r\nHe peered upwards. “Look!” he said.\r\n\r\n“What?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“In the sky. Already. On the blackness—a little touch of blue. See! The\r\nstars seem larger. And the little ones and all those dim nebulosities\r\nwe saw in empty space—they are hidden!”\r\n\r\nSwiftly, steadily, the day approached us. Grey summit after grey summit\r\nwas overtaken by the blaze, and turned to a smoking white intensity. At\r\nlast there was nothing to the west of us but a bank of surging fog, the\r\ntumultuous advance and ascent of cloudy haze. The distant cliff had\r\nreceded farther and farther, had loomed and changed through the whirl,\r\nand foundered and vanished at last in its confusion.\r\n\r\nNearer came that steaming advance, nearer and nearer, coming as fast as\r\nthe shadow of a cloud before the south-west wind. About us rose a thin\r\nanticipatory haze.\r\n\r\nCavor gripped my arm. “What?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Look! The sunrise! The sun!”\r\n\r\nHe turned me about and pointed to the brow of the eastward cliff,\r\nlooming above the haze about us, scarce lighter than the darkness of\r\nthe sky. But now its line was marked by strange reddish shapes, tongues\r\nof vermilion flame that writhed and danced. I fancied it must be\r\nspirals of vapour that had caught the light and made this crest of\r\nfiery tongues against the sky, but indeed it was the solar prominences\r\nI saw, a crown of fire about the sun that is forever hidden from\r\nearthly eyes by our atmospheric veil.\r\n\r\nAnd then—the sun!\r\n\r\nSteadily, inevitably came a brilliant line, came a thin edge of\r\nintolerable effulgence that took a circular shape, became a bow, became\r\na blazing sceptre, and hurled a shaft of heat at us as though it was a\r\nspear.\r\n\r\nIt seemed verily to stab my eyes! I cried aloud and turned about\r\nblinded, groping for my blanket beneath the bale.\r\n\r\nAnd with that incandescence came a sound, the first sound that had\r\nreached us from without since we left the earth, a hissing and\r\nrustling, the stormy trailing of the aerial garment of the advancing\r\nday. And with the coming of the sound and the light the sphere lurched,\r\nand blinded and dazzled we staggered helplessly against each other. It\r\nlurched again, and the hissing grew louder. I had shut my eyes\r\nperforce, I was making clumsy efforts to cover my head with my blanket,\r\nand this second lurch sent me helplessly off my feet. I fell against\r\nthe bale, and opening my eyes had a momentary glimpse of the air just\r\noutside our glass. It was running—it was boiling—like snow into which a\r\nwhite-hot rod is thrust. What had been solid air had suddenly at the\r\ntouch of the sun become a paste, a mud, a slushy liquefaction, that\r\nhissed and bubbled into gas.\r\n\r\nThere came a still more violent whirl of the sphere and we had clutched\r\none another. In another moment we were spun about again. Round we went\r\nand over, and then I was on all fours. The lunar dawn had hold of us.\r\nIt meant to show us little men what the moon could do with us.\r\n\r\nI caught a second glimpse of things without, puffs of vapour, half\r\nliquid slush, excavated, sliding, falling, sliding. We dropped into\r\ndarkness. I went down with Cavor’s knees in my chest. Then he seemed to\r\nfly away from me, and for a moment I lay with all the breath out of my\r\nbody staring upward. A toppling crag of the melting stuff had splashed\r\nover us, buried us, and now it thinned and boiled off us. I saw the\r\nbubbles dancing on the glass above. I heard Cavor exclaiming feebly.\r\n\r\nThen some huge landslip in the thawing air had caught us, and\r\nspluttering expostulation, we began to roll down a slope, rolling\r\nfaster and faster, leaping crevasses and rebounding from banks, faster\r\nand faster, westward into the white-hot boiling tumult of the lunar\r\nday.\r\n\r\nClutching at one another we spun about, pitched this way and that, our\r\nbale of packages leaping at us, pounding at us. We collided, we\r\ngripped, we were torn asunder—our heads met, and the whole universe\r\nburst into fiery darts and stars! On the earth we should have smashed\r\none another a dozen times, but on the moon, luckily for us, our weight\r\nwas only one-sixth of what it is terrestrially, and we fell very\r\nmercifully. I recall a sensation of utter sickness, a feeling as if my\r\nbrain were upside down within my skull, and then—\r\n\r\nSomething was at work upon my face, some thin feelers worried my ears.\r\nThen I discovered the brilliance of the landscape around was mitigated\r\nby blue spectacles. Cavor bent over me, and I saw his face upside down,\r\nhis eyes also protected by tinted goggles. His breath came irregularly,\r\nand his lip was bleeding from a bruise. “Better?” he said, wiping the\r\nblood with the back of his hand.\r\n\r\nEverything seemed swaying for a space, but that was simply my\r\ngiddiness. I perceived that he had closed some of the shutters in the\r\nouter sphere to save me—from the direct blaze of the sun. I was aware\r\nthat everything about us was very brilliant.\r\n\r\n“Lord!” I gasped. “But this—”\r\n\r\nI craned my neck to see. I perceived there was a blinding glare\r\noutside, an utter change from the gloomy darkness of our first\r\nimpressions. “Have I been insensible long?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know—the chronometer is broken. Some little time.... My dear\r\nchap! I have been afraid...”\r\n\r\nI lay for a space taking this in. I saw his face still bore evidences\r\nof emotion. For a while I said nothing. I passed an inquisitive hand\r\nover my contusions, and surveyed his face for similar damages. The back\r\nof my right hand had suffered most, and was skinless and raw. My\r\nforehead was bruised and had bled. He handed me a little measure with\r\nsome of the restorative—I forget the name of it—he had brought with us.\r\nAfter a time I felt a little better. I began to stretch my limbs\r\ncarefully. Soon I could talk.\r\n\r\n“It wouldn’t have done,” I said, as though there had been no interval.\r\n\r\n“No! it _wouldn’t_.”\r\n\r\nHe thought, his hands hanging over his knees. He peered through the\r\nglass and then stared at me. “Good Lord!” he said. “_No!_”\r\n\r\n“What has happened?” I asked after a pause. “Have we jumped to the\r\ntropics?”\r\n\r\n“It was as I expected. This air has evaporated—if it is air. At any\r\nrate, it has evaporated, and the surface of the moon is showing. We are\r\nlying on a bank of earthy rock. Here and there bare soil is exposed. A\r\nqueer sort of soil!”\r\n\r\nIt occurred to him that it was unnecessary to explain. He assisted me\r\ninto a sitting position, and I could see with my own eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\nA Lunar Morning\r\n\r\n\r\nThe harsh emphasis, the pitiless black and white of scenery had\r\naltogether disappeared. The glare of the sun had taken upon itself a\r\nfaint tinge of amber; the shadows upon the cliff of the crater wall\r\nwere deeply purple. To the eastward a dark bank of fog still crouched\r\nand sheltered from the sunrise, but to the westward the sky was blue\r\nand clear. I began to realise the length of my insensibility.\r\n\r\nWe were no longer in a void. An atmosphere had arisen about us. The\r\noutline of things had gained in character, had grown acute and varied;\r\nsave for a shadowed space of white substance here and there, white\r\nsubstance that was no longer air but snow, the arctic appearance had\r\ngone altogether. Everywhere broad rusty brown spaces of bare and\r\ntumbled earth spread to the blaze of the sun. Here and there at the\r\nedge of the snowdrifts were transient little pools and eddies of water,\r\nthe only things stirring in that expanse of barrenness. The sunlight\r\ninundated the upper two blinds of our sphere and turned our climate to\r\nhigh summer, but our feet were still in shadow, and the sphere was\r\nlying upon a drift of snow.\r\n\r\nAnd scattered here and there upon the slope, and emphasised by little\r\nwhite threads of unthawed snow upon their shady sides, were shapes like\r\nsticks, dry twisted sticks of the same rusty hue as the rock upon which\r\nthey lay. That caught one’s thoughts sharply. Sticks! On a lifeless\r\nworld? Then as my eye grew more accustomed to the texture of their\r\nsubstance, I perceived that almost all this surface had a fibrous\r\ntexture, like the carpet of brown needles one finds beneath the shade\r\nof pine trees.\r\n\r\n“Cavor!” I said.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“It may be a dead world now—but once—”\r\n\r\nSomething arrested my attention. I had discovered among these needles a\r\nnumber of little round objects. And it seemed to me that one of these\r\nhad moved. “Cavor,” I whispered.\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\nBut I did not answer at once. I stared incredulous. For an instant I\r\ncould not believe my eyes. I gave an inarticulate cry. I gripped his\r\narm. I pointed. “Look!” I cried, finding my tongue. “There! Yes! And\r\nthere!”\r\n\r\nHis eyes followed my pointing finger. “Eh?” he said.\r\n\r\nHow can I describe the thing I saw? It is so petty a thing to state,\r\nand yet it seemed so wonderful, so pregnant with emotion. I have said\r\nthat amidst the stick-like litter were these rounded bodies, these\r\nlittle oval bodies that might have passed as very small pebbles. And\r\nnow first one and then another had stirred, had rolled over and\r\ncracked, and down the crack of each of them showed a minute line of\r\nyellowish green, thrusting outward to meet the hot encouragement of the\r\nnewly-risen sun. For a moment that was all, and then there stirred, and\r\nburst a third!\r\n\r\n“It is a seed,” said Cavor. And then I heard him whisper very softly,\r\n“_Life!_”\r\n\r\n“Life!” And immediately it poured upon us that our vast journey had not\r\nbeen made in vain, that we had come to no arid waste of minerals, but\r\nto a world that lived and moved! We watched intensely. I remember I\r\nkept rubbing the glass before me with my sleeve, jealous of the\r\nfaintest suspicion of mist.\r\n\r\nThe picture was clear and vivid only in the middle of the field. All\r\nabout that centre the dead fibres and seeds were magnified and\r\ndistorted by the curvature of the glass. But we could see enough! One\r\nafter another all down the sunlit slope these miraculous little brown\r\nbodies burst and gaped apart, like seed-pods, like the husks of fruits;\r\nopened eager mouths that drank in the heat and light pouring in a\r\ncascade from the newly-risen sun.\r\n\r\nEvery moment more of these seed coats ruptured, and even as they did so\r\nthe swelling pioneers overflowed their rent-distended seed-cases, and\r\npassed into the second stage of growth. With a steady assurance, a\r\nswift deliberation, these amazing seeds thrust a rootlet downward to\r\nthe earth and a queer little bundle-like bud into the air. In a little\r\nwhile the whole slope was dotted with minute plantlets standing at\r\nattention in the blaze of the sun.\r\n\r\nThey did not stand for long. The bundle-like buds swelled and strained\r\nand opened with a jerk, thrusting out a coronet of little sharp tips,\r\nspreading a whorl of tiny, spiky, brownish leaves, that lengthened\r\nrapidly, lengthened visibly even as we watched. The movement was slower\r\nthan any animal’s, swifter than any plant’s I have ever seen before.\r\nHow can I suggest it to you—the way that growth went on? The leaf tips\r\ngrew so that they moved onward even while we looked at them. The brown\r\nseed-case shrivelled and was absorbed with an equal rapidity. Have you\r\never on a cold day taken a thermometer into your warm hand and watched\r\nthe little thread of mercury creep up the tube? These moon plants grew\r\nlike that.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes, as it seemed, the buds of the more forward of these\r\nplants had lengthened into a stem and were even putting forth a second\r\nwhorl of leaves, and all the slope that had seemed so recently a\r\nlifeless stretch of litter was now dark with the stunted olive-green\r\nherbage of bristling spikes that swayed with the vigour of their\r\ngrowing.\r\n\r\nI turned about, and behold! along the upper edge of a rock to the\r\neastward a similar fringe in a scarcely less forward condition swayed\r\nand bent, dark against the blinding glare of the sun. And beyond this\r\nfringe was the silhouette of a plant mass, branching clumsily like a\r\ncactus, and swelling visibly, swelling like a bladder that fills with\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThen to the westward also I discovered that another such distended form\r\nwas rising over the scrub. But here the light fell upon its sleek\r\nsides, and I could see that its colour was a vivid orange hue. It rose\r\nas one watched it; if one looked away from it for a minute and then\r\nback, its outline had changed; it thrust out blunt congested branches\r\nuntil in a little time it rose a coralline shape of many feet in\r\nheight. Compared with such a growth the terrestrial puff-ball, which\r\nwill sometimes swell a foot in diameter in a single night, would be a\r\nhopeless laggard. But then the puff-ball grows against a gravitational\r\npull six times that of the moon. Beyond, out of gullies and flats that\r\nhad been hidden from us, but not from the quickening sun, over reefs\r\nand banks of shining rock, a bristling beard of spiky and fleshy\r\nvegetation was straining into view, hurrying tumultuously to take\r\nadvantage of the brief day in which it must flower and fruit and seed\r\nagain and die. It was like a miracle, that growth. So, one must\r\nimagine, the trees and plants arose at the Creation and covered the\r\ndesolation of the new-made earth.\r\n\r\nImagine it! Imagine that dawn! The resurrection of the frozen air, the\r\nstirring and quickening of the soil, and then this silent uprising of\r\nvegetation, this unearthly ascent of fleshiness and spikes. Conceive it\r\nall lit by a blaze that would make the intensest sunlight of earth seem\r\nwatery and weak. And still around this stirring jungle, wherever there\r\nwas shadow, lingered banks of bluish snow. And to have the picture of\r\nour impression complete, you must bear in mind that we saw it all\r\nthrough a thick bent glass, distorting it as things are distorted by a\r\nlens, acute only in the centre of the picture, and very bright there,\r\nand towards the edges magnified and unreal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\nProspecting Begins\r\n\r\n\r\nWe ceased to gaze. We turned to each other, the same thought, the same\r\nquestion in our eyes. For these plants to grow, there must be some air,\r\nhowever attenuated, air that we also should be able to breathe.\r\n\r\n“The manhole?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Yes!” said Cavor, “if it is air we see!”\r\n\r\n“In a little while,” I said, “these plants will be as high as we are.\r\nSuppose—suppose after all— Is it certain? How do you know that stuff\r\n_is_ air? It may be nitrogen—it may be carbonic acid even!”\r\n\r\n“That’s easy,” he said, and set about proving it. He produced a big\r\npiece of crumpled paper from the bale, lit it, and thrust it hastily\r\nthrough the man-hole valve. I bent forward and peered down through the\r\nthick glass for its appearance outside, that little flame on whose\r\nevidence depended so much!\r\n\r\nI saw the paper drop out and lie lightly upon the snow. The pink flame\r\nof its burning vanished. For an instant it seemed to be extinguished.\r\nAnd then I saw a little blue tongue upon the edge of it that trembled,\r\nand crept, and spread!\r\n\r\nQuietly the whole sheet, save where it lay in immediate contact with\r\nthe snow, charred and shrivelled and sent up a quivering thread of\r\nsmoke. There was no doubt left to me; the atmosphere of the moon was\r\neither pure oxygen or air, and capable therefore—unless its tenuity was\r\nexcessive—of supporting our alien life. We might emerge—and live!\r\n\r\nI sat down with my legs on either side of the manhole and prepared to\r\nunscrew it, but Cavor stopped me. “There is first a little precaution,”\r\nhe said. He pointed out that although it was certainly an oxygenated\r\natmosphere outside, it might still be so rarefied as to cause us grave\r\ninjury. He reminded me of mountain sickness, and of the bleeding that\r\noften afflicts aeronauts who have ascended too swiftly, and he spent\r\nsome time in the preparation of a sickly-tasting drink which he\r\ninsisted on my sharing. It made me feel a little numb, but otherwise\r\nhad no effect on me. Then he permitted me to begin unscrewing.\r\n\r\nPresently the glass stopper of the manhole was so far undone that the\r\ndenser air within our sphere began to escape along the thread of the\r\nscrew, singing as a kettle sings before it boils. Thereupon he made me\r\ndesist. It speedily became evident that the pressure outside was very\r\nmuch less than it was within. How much less it was we had no means of\r\ntelling.\r\n\r\nI sat grasping the stopper with both hands, ready to close it again if,\r\nin spite of our intense hope, the lunar atmosphere should after all\r\nprove too rarefied for us, and Cavor sat with a cylinder of compressed\r\noxygen at hand to restore our pressure. We looked at one another in\r\nsilence, and then at the fantastic vegetation that swayed and grew\r\nvisibly and noiselessly without. And ever that shrill piping continued.\r\n\r\nMy blood-vessels began to throb in my ears, and the sound of Cavor’s\r\nmovements diminished. I noted how still everything had become, because\r\nof the thinning of the air.\r\n\r\nAs our air sizzled out from the screw the moisture of it condensed in\r\nlittle puffs.\r\n\r\nPresently I experienced a peculiar shortness of breath that lasted\r\nindeed during the whole of the time of our exposure to the moon’s\r\nexterior atmosphere, and a rather unpleasant sensation about the ears\r\nand finger-nails and the back of the throat grew upon my attention, and\r\npresently passed off again.\r\n\r\nBut then came vertigo and nausea that abruptly changed the quality of\r\nmy courage. I gave the lid of the manhole half a turn and made a hasty\r\nexplanation to Cavor; but now he was the more sanguine. He answered me\r\nin a voice that seemed extraordinarily small and remote, because of the\r\nthinness of the air that carried the sound. He recommended a nip of\r\nbrandy, and set me the example, and presently I felt better. I turned\r\nthe manhole stopper back again. The throbbing in my ears grew louder,\r\nand then I remarked that the piping note of the outrush had ceased. For\r\na time I could not be sure that it had ceased.\r\n\r\n“Well?” said Cavor, in the ghost of a voice.\r\n\r\n“Well?” said I.\r\n\r\n“Shall we go on?”\r\n\r\nI thought. “Is this all?”\r\n\r\n“If you can stand it.”\r\n\r\nBy way of answer I went on unscrewing. I lifted the circular operculum\r\nfrom its place and laid it carefully on the bale. A flake or so of snow\r\nwhirled and vanished as that thin and unfamiliar air took possession of\r\nour sphere. I knelt, and then seated myself at the edge of the manhole,\r\npeering over it. Beneath, within a yard of my face, lay the untrodden\r\nsnow of the moon.\r\n\r\nThere came a little pause. Our eyes met.\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t distress your lungs too much?” said Cavor.\r\n\r\n“No,” I said. “I can stand this.”\r\n\r\nHe stretched out his hand for his blanket, thrust his head through its\r\ncentral hole, and wrapped it about him. He sat down on the edge of the\r\nmanhole, he let his feet drop until they were within six inches of the\r\nlunar ground. He hesitated for a moment, then thrust himself forward,\r\ndropped these intervening inches, and stood upon the untrodden soil of\r\nthe moon.\r\n\r\nAs he stepped forward he was refracted grotesquely by the edge of the\r\nglass. He stood for a moment looking this way and that. Then he drew\r\nhimself together and leapt.\r\n\r\nThe glass distorted everything, but it seemed to me even then to be an\r\nextremely big leap. He had at one bound become remote. He seemed twenty\r\nor thirty feet off. He was standing high upon a rocky mass and\r\ngesticulating back to me. Perhaps he was shouting—but the sound did not\r\nreach me. But how the deuce had he done this? I felt like a man who has\r\njust seen a new conjuring trick.\r\n\r\nIn a puzzled state of mind I too dropped through the manhole. I stood\r\nup. Just in front of me the snowdrift had fallen away and made a sort\r\nof ditch. I made a step and jumped.\r\n\r\nI found myself flying through the air, saw the rock on which he stood\r\ncoming to meet me, clutched it and clung in a state of infinite\r\namazement.\r\n\r\nI gasped a painful laugh. I was tremendously confused. Cavor bent down\r\nand shouted in piping tones for me to be careful.\r\n\r\nI had forgotten that on the moon, with only an eighth part of the\r\nearth’s mass and a quarter of its diameter, my weight was barely a\r\nsixth what it was on earth. But now that fact insisted on being\r\nremembered.\r\n\r\n“We are out of Mother Earth’s leading-strings now,” he said.\r\n\r\nWith a guarded effort I raised myself to the top, and moving as\r\ncautiously as a rheumatic patient, stood up beside him under the blaze\r\nof the sun. The sphere lay behind us on its dwindling snowdrift thirty\r\nfeet away.\r\n\r\nAs far as the eye could see over the enormous disorder of rocks that\r\nformed the crater floor, the same bristling scrub that surrounded us\r\nwas starting into life, diversified here and there by bulging masses of\r\na cactus form, and scarlet and purple lichens that grew so fast they\r\nseemed to crawl over the rocks. The whole area of the crater seemed to\r\nme then to be one similar wilderness up to the very foot of the\r\nsurrounding cliff.\r\n\r\nThis cliff was apparently bare of vegetation save at its base, and with\r\nbuttresses and terraces and platforms that did not very greatly attract\r\nour attention at the time. It was many miles away from us in every\r\ndirection; we seemed to be almost at the centre of the crater, and we\r\nsaw it through a certain haziness that drove before the wind. For there\r\nwas even a wind now in the thin air, a swift yet weak wind that chilled\r\nexceedingly but exerted little pressure. It was blowing round the\r\ncrater, as it seemed, to the hot illuminated side from the foggy\r\ndarkness under the sunward wall. It was difficult to look into this\r\neastward fog; we had to peer with half-closed eyes beneath the shade of\r\nour hands, because of the fierce intensity of the motionless sun.\r\n\r\n“It seems to be deserted,” said Cavor, “absolutely desolate.”\r\n\r\nI looked about me again. I retained even then a clinging hope of some\r\nquasi-human evidence, some pinnacle of building, some house or engine,\r\nbut everywhere one looked spread the tumbled rocks in peaks and crests,\r\nand the darting scrub and those bulging cacti that swelled and swelled,\r\na flat negation as it seemed of all such hope.\r\n\r\n“It looks as though these plants had it to themselves,” I said. “I see\r\nno trace of any other creature.”\r\n\r\n“No insects—no birds, no! Not a trace, not a scrap nor particle of\r\nanimal life. If there was—what would they do in the night? ... No;\r\nthere’s just these plants alone.”\r\n\r\nI shaded my eyes with my hand. “It’s like the landscape of a dream.\r\nThese things are less like earthly land plants than the things one\r\nimagines among the rocks at the bottom of the sea. Look at that yonder!\r\nOne might imagine it a lizard changed into a plant. And the glare!”\r\n\r\n“This is only the fresh morning,” said Cavor.\r\n\r\nHe sighed and looked about him. “This is no world for men,” he said.\r\n“And yet in a way—it appeals.”\r\n\r\nHe became silent for a time, then commenced his meditative humming.\r\n\r\nI started at a gentle touch, and found a thin sheet of livid lichen\r\nlapping over my shoe. I kicked at it and it fell to powder, and each\r\nspeck began to grow.\r\n\r\nI heard Cavor exclaim sharply, and perceived that one of the fixed\r\nbayonets of the scrub had pricked him. He hesitated, his eyes sought\r\namong the rocks about us. A sudden blaze of pink had crept up a ragged\r\npillar of crag. It was a most extraordinary pink, a livid magenta.\r\n\r\n“Look!” said I, turning, and behold Cavor had vanished.\r\n\r\nFor an instant I stood transfixed. Then I made a hasty step to look\r\nover the verge of the rock. But in my surprise at his disappearance I\r\nforgot once more that we were on the moon. The thrust of my foot that I\r\nmade in striding would have carried me a yard on earth; on the moon it\r\ncarried me six—a good five yards over the edge. For the moment the\r\nthing had something of the effect of those nightmares when one falls\r\nand falls. For while one falls sixteen feet in the first second of a\r\nfall on earth, on the moon one falls two, and with only a sixth of\r\none’s weight. I fell, or rather I jumped down, about ten yards I\r\nsuppose. It seemed to take quite a long time, five or six seconds, I\r\nshould think. I floated through the air and fell like a feather,\r\nknee-deep in a snow-drift in the bottom of a gully of blue-grey,\r\nwhite-veined rock.\r\n\r\nI looked about me. “Cavor!” I cried; but no Cavor was visible.\r\n\r\n“Cavor!” I cried louder, and the rocks echoed me.\r\n\r\nI turned fiercely to the rocks and clambered to the summit of them.\r\n“Cavor!” I cried. My voice sounded like the voice of a lost lamb.\r\n\r\nThe sphere, too, was not in sight, and for a moment a horrible feeling\r\nof desolation pinched my heart.\r\n\r\nThen I saw him. He was laughing and gesticulating to attract my\r\nattention. He was on a bare patch of rock twenty or thirty yards away.\r\nI could not hear his voice, but “jump” said his gestures. I hesitated,\r\nthe distance seemed enormous. Yet I reflected that surely I must be\r\nable to clear a greater distance than Cavor.\r\n\r\nI made a step back, gathered myself together, and leapt with all my\r\nmight. I seemed to shoot right up in the air as though I should never\r\ncome down.\r\n\r\nIt was horrible and delightful, and as wild as a nightmare, to go\r\nflying off in this fashion. I realised my leap had been altogether too\r\nviolent. I flew clean over Cavor’s head and beheld a spiky confusion in\r\na gully spreading to meet my fall. I gave a yelp of alarm. I put out my\r\nhands and straightened my legs.\r\n\r\nI hit a huge fungoid bulk that burst all about me, scattering a mass of\r\norange spores in every direction, and covering me with orange powder. I\r\nrolled over spluttering, and came to rest convulsed with breathless\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nI became aware of Cavor’s little round face peering over a bristling\r\nhedge. He shouted some faded inquiry. “Eh?” I tried to shout, but could\r\nnot do so for want of breath. He made his way towards me, coming\r\ngingerly among the bushes.\r\n\r\n“We’ve got to be careful,” he said. “This moon has no discipline.\r\nShe’ll let us smash ourselves.”\r\n\r\nHe helped me to my feet. “You exerted yourself too much,” he said,\r\ndabbing at the yellow stuff with his hand to remove it from my\r\ngarments.\r\n\r\nI stood passive and panting, allowing him to beat off the jelly from my\r\nknees and elbows and lecture me upon my misfortunes. “We don’t quite\r\nallow for the gravitation. Our muscles are scarcely educated yet. We\r\nmust practise a little, when you have got your breath.”\r\n\r\nI pulled two or three little thorns out of my hand, and sat for a time\r\non a boulder of rock. My muscles were quivering, and I had that feeling\r\nof personal disillusionment that comes at the first fall to the learner\r\nof cycling on earth.\r\n\r\nIt suddenly occurred to Cavor that the cold air in the gully, after the\r\nbrightness of the sun, might give me a fever. So we clambered back into\r\nthe sunlight. We found that beyond a few abrasions I had received no\r\nserious injuries from my tumble, and at Cavor’s suggestion we were\r\npresently looking round for some safe and easy landing-place for my\r\nnext leap. We chose a rocky slab some ten yards off, separated from us\r\nby a little thicket of olive-green spikes.\r\n\r\n“Imagine it there!” said Cavor, who was assuming the airs of a trainer,\r\nand he pointed to a spot about four feet from my toes. This leap I\r\nmanaged without difficulty, and I must confess I found a certain\r\nsatisfaction in Cavor’s falling short by a foot or so and tasting the\r\nspikes of the scrub. “One has to be careful, you see,” he said, pulling\r\nout his thorns, and with that he ceased to be my mentor and became my\r\nfellow-learner in the art of lunar locomotion.\r\n\r\nWe chose a still easier jump and did it without difficulty, and then\r\nleapt back again, and to and fro several times, accustoming our muscles\r\nto the new standard. I could never have believed had I not experienced\r\nit, how rapid that adaptation would be. In a very little time indeed,\r\ncertainly after fewer than thirty leaps, we could judge the effort\r\nnecessary for a distance with almost terrestrial assurance.\r\n\r\nAnd all this time the lunar plants were growing around us, higher and\r\ndenser and more entangled, every moment thicker and taller, spiked\r\nplants, green cactus masses, fungi, fleshy and lichenous things,\r\nstrangest radiate and sinuous shapes. But we were so intent upon our\r\nleaping, that for a time we gave no heed to their unfaltering\r\nexpansion.\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary elation had taken possession of us. Partly, I think,\r\nit was our sense of release from the confinement of the sphere. Mainly,\r\nhowever, the thin sweetness of the air, which I am certain contained a\r\nmuch larger proportion of oxygen than our terrestrial atmosphere. In\r\nspite of the strange quality of all about us, I felt as adventurous and\r\nexperimental as a cockney would do placed for the first time among\r\nmountains and I do not think it occurred to either of us, face to face\r\nthough we were with the unknown, to be very greatly afraid.\r\n\r\nWe were bitten by a spirit of enterprise. We selected a lichenous kopje\r\nperhaps fifteen yards away, and landed neatly on its summit one after\r\nthe other. “Good!” we cried to each other; “good!” and Cavor made three\r\nsteps and went off to a tempting slope of snow a good twenty yards and\r\nmore beyond. I stood for a moment struck by the grotesque effect of his\r\nsoaring figure—his dirty cricket cap, and spiky hair, his little round\r\nbody, his arms and his knicker-bockered legs tucked up tightly—against\r\nthe weird spaciousness of the lunar scene. A gust of laughter seized\r\nme, and then I stepped off to follow. Plump! I dropped beside him.\r\n\r\nWe made a few gargantuan strides, leapt three or four times more, and\r\nsat down at last in a lichenous hollow. Our lungs were painful. We sat\r\nholding our sides and recovering our breath, looking appreciation to\r\none another. Cavor panted something about “amazing sensations.” And\r\nthen came a thought into my head. For the moment it did not seem a\r\nparticularly appalling thought, simply a natural question arising out\r\nof the situation.\r\n\r\n“By the way,” I said, “where exactly is the sphere?”\r\n\r\nCavor looked at me. “Eh?”\r\n\r\nThe full meaning of what we were saying struck me sharply.\r\n\r\n“Cavor!” I cried, laying a hand on his arm, “where is the sphere?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\nLost Men in the Moon\r\n\r\n\r\nHis face caught something of my dismay. He stood up and stared about\r\nhim at the scrub that fenced us in and rose about us, straining upward\r\nin a passion of growth. He put a dubious hand to his lips. He spoke\r\nwith a sudden lack of assurance. “I think,” he said slowly, “we left it\r\n... somewhere ... about _there_.”\r\n\r\nHe pointed a hesitating finger that wavered in an arc.\r\n\r\n“I’m not sure.” His look of consternation deepened. “Anyhow,” he said,\r\nwith his eyes on me, “it can’t be far.”\r\n\r\nWe had both stood up. We made unmeaning ejaculations, our eyes sought\r\nin the twining, thickening jungle round about us.\r\n\r\nAll about us on the sunlit slopes frothed and swayed the darting\r\nshrubs, the swelling cactus, the creeping lichens, and wherever the\r\nshade remained the snow-drifts lingered. North, south, east, and west\r\nspread an identical monotony of unfamiliar forms. And somewhere, buried\r\nalready among this tangled confusion, was our sphere, our home, our\r\nonly provision, our only hope of escape from this fantastic wilderness\r\nof ephemeral growths into which we had come.\r\n\r\n“I think after all,” he said, pointing suddenly, “it might be over\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\n“No,” I said. “We have turned in a curve. See! here is the mark of my\r\nheels. It’s clear the thing must be more to the eastward, much more.\r\nNo—the sphere must be over there.”\r\n\r\n“I _think_,” said Cavor, “I kept the sun upon my right all the time.”\r\n\r\n“Every leap, it seems to _me_,” I said, “my shadow flew before me.”\r\n\r\nWe stared into one another’s eyes. The area of the crater had become\r\nenormously vast to our imaginations, the growing thickets already\r\nimpenetrably dense.\r\n\r\n“Good heavens! What fools we have been!”\r\n\r\n“It’s evident that we must find it again,” said Cavor, “and that soon.\r\nThe sun grows stronger. We should be fainting with the heat already if\r\nit wasn’t so dry. And ... I’m hungry.”\r\n\r\nI stared at him. I had not suspected this aspect of the matter before.\r\nBut it came to me at once—a positive craving. “Yes,” I said with\r\nemphasis. “I am hungry too.”\r\n\r\nHe stood up with a look of active resolution. “Certainly we must find\r\nthe sphere.”\r\n\r\nAs calmly as possible we surveyed the interminable reefs and thickets\r\nthat formed the floor of the crater, each of us weighing in silence the\r\nchances of our finding the sphere before we were overtaken by heat and\r\nhunger.\r\n\r\n“It can’t be fifty yards from here,” said Cavor, with indecisive\r\ngestures. “The only thing is to beat round about until we come upon\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“That is all we can do,” I said, without any alacrity to begin our\r\nhunt. “I wish this confounded spike bush did not grow so fast!”\r\n\r\n“That’s just it,” said Cavor. “But it was lying on a bank of snow.”\r\n\r\nI stared about me in the vain hope of recognising some knoll or shrub\r\nthat had been near the sphere. But everywhere was a confusing sameness,\r\neverywhere the aspiring bushes, the distending fungi, the dwindling\r\nsnow banks, steadily and inevitably changed. The sun scorched and\r\nstung, the faintness of an unaccountable hunger mingled with our\r\ninfinite perplexity. And even as we stood there, confused and lost\r\namidst unprecedented things, we became aware for the first time of a\r\nsound upon the moon other than the air of the growing plants, the faint\r\nsighing of the wind, or those that we ourselves had made.\r\n\r\nBoom.... Boom.... Boom.\r\n\r\nIt came from beneath our feet, a sound in the earth. We seemed to hear\r\nit with our feet as much as with our ears. Its dull resonance was\r\nmuffled by distance, thick with the quality of intervening substance.\r\nNo sound that I can imagine could have astonished us more, or have\r\nchanged more completely the quality of things about us. For this sound,\r\nrich, slow, and deliberate, seemed to us as though it could be nothing\r\nbut the striking of some gigantic buried clock.\r\n\r\nBoom.... Boom.... Boom.\r\n\r\nSound suggestive of still cloisters, of sleepless nights in crowded\r\ncities, of vigils and the awaited hour, of all that is orderly and\r\nmethodical in life, booming out pregnant and mysterious in this\r\nfantastic desert! To the eye everything was unchanged: the desolation\r\nof bushes and cacti waving silently in the wind, stretched unbroken to\r\nthe distant cliffs, the still dark sky was empty overhead, and the hot\r\nsun hung and burned. And through it all, a warning, a threat, throbbed\r\nthis enigma of sound.\r\n\r\nBoom.... Boom.... Boom....\r\n\r\nWe questioned one another in faint and faded voices.\r\n\r\n“A clock?”\r\n\r\n“Like a clock!”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“What can it be?”\r\n\r\n“Count,” was Cavor’s belated suggestion, and at that word the striking\r\nceased.\r\n\r\nThe silence, the rhythmic disappointment of the silence, came as a\r\nfresh shock. For a moment one could doubt whether one had ever heard a\r\nsound. Or whether it might not still be going on. Had I indeed heard a\r\nsound?\r\n\r\nI felt the pressure of Cavor’s hand upon my arm. He spoke in an\r\nundertone, as though he feared to wake some sleeping thing. “Let us\r\nkeep together,” he whispered, “and look for the sphere. We must get\r\nback to the sphere. This is beyond our understanding.”\r\n\r\n“Which way shall we go?”\r\n\r\nHe hesitated. An intense persuasion of presences, of unseen things\r\nabout us and near us, dominated our minds. What could they be? Where\r\ncould they be? Was this arid desolation, alternately frozen and\r\nscorched, only the outer rind and mask of some subterranean world? And\r\nif so, what sort of world? What sort of inhabitants might it not\r\npresently disgorge upon us?\r\n\r\nAnd then, stabbing the aching stillness as vivid and sudden as an\r\nunexpected thunderclap, came a clang and rattle as though great gates\r\nof metal had suddenly been flung apart.\r\n\r\nIt arrested our steps. We stood gaping helplessly. Then Cavor stole\r\ntowards me.\r\n\r\n“I do not understand!” he whispered close to my face. He waved his hand\r\nvaguely skyward, the vague suggestion of still vaguer thoughts.\r\n\r\n“A hiding-place! If anything came...”\r\n\r\nI looked about us. I nodded my head in assent to him.\r\n\r\nWe started off, moving stealthily with the most exaggerated precautions\r\nagainst noise. We went towards a thicket of scrub. A clangour like\r\nhammers flung about a boiler hastened our steps. “We must crawl,”\r\nwhispered Cavor.\r\n\r\nThe lower leaves of the bayonet plants, already overshadowed by the\r\nnewer ones above, were beginning to wilt and shrivel so that we could\r\nthrust our way in among the thickening stems without serious injury. A\r\nstab in the face or arm we did not heed. At the heart of the thicket I\r\nstopped, and stared panting into Cavor’s face.\r\n\r\n“Subterranean,” he whispered. “Below.”\r\n\r\n“They may come out.”\r\n\r\n“We must find the sphere!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said; “but how?”\r\n\r\n“Crawl till we come to it.”\r\n\r\n“But if we don’t?”\r\n\r\n“Keep hidden. See what they are like.”\r\n\r\n“We will keep together,” said I.\r\n\r\nHe thought. “Which way shall we go?”\r\n\r\n“We must take our chance.”\r\n\r\nWe peered this way and that. Then very circumspectly, we began to crawl\r\nthrough the lower jungle, making, so far as we could judge, a circuit,\r\nhalting now at every waving fungus, at every sound, intent only on the\r\nsphere from which we had so foolishly emerged. Ever and again from out\r\nof the earth beneath us came concussions, beatings, strange,\r\ninexplicable, mechanical sounds; and once, and then again, we thought\r\nwe heard something, a faint rattle and tumult, borne to us through the\r\nair. But fearful as we were we dared essay no vantage-point to survey\r\nthe crater. For long we saw nothing of the beings whose sounds were so\r\nabundant and insistent. But for the faintness of our hunger and the\r\ndrying of our throats that crawling would have had the quality of a\r\nvery vivid dream. It was so absolutely unreal. The only element with\r\nany touch of reality was these sounds.\r\n\r\nPicture it to yourself! About us the dream-like jungle, with the silent\r\nbayonet leaves darting overhead, and the silent, vivid, sun-splashed\r\nlichens under our hands and knees, waving with the vigour of their\r\ngrowth as a carpet waves when the wind gets beneath it. Ever and again\r\none of the bladder fungi, bulging and distending under the sun, loomed\r\nupon us. Ever and again some novel shape in vivid colour obtruded. The\r\nvery cells that built up these plants were as large as my thumb, like\r\nbeads of coloured glass. And all these things were saturated in the\r\nunmitigated glare of the sun, were seen against a sky that was bluish\r\nblack and spangled still, in spite of the sunlight, with a few\r\nsurviving stars. Strange! the very forms and texture of the stones were\r\nstrange. It was all strange, the feeling of one’s body was\r\nunprecedented, every other movement ended in a surprise. The breath\r\nsucked thin in one’s throat, the blood flowed through one’s ears in a\r\nthrobbing tide—thud, thud, thud, thud....\r\n\r\nAnd ever and again came gusts of turmoil, hammering, the clanging and\r\nthrob of machinery, and presently—the bellowing of great beasts!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\nThe Mooncalf Pastures\r\n\r\n\r\nSo we two poor terrestrial castaways, lost in that wild-growing moon\r\njungle, crawled in terror before the sounds that had come upon us. We\r\ncrawled, as it seemed, a long time before we saw either Selenite or\r\nmooncalf, though we heard the bellowing and gruntulous noises of these\r\nlatter continually drawing nearer to us. We crawled through stony\r\nravines, over snow slopes, amidst fungi that ripped like thin bladders\r\nat our thrust, emitting a watery humour, over a perfect pavement of\r\nthings like puff-balls, and beneath interminable thickets of scrub. And\r\never more helplessly our eyes sought for our abandoned sphere. The\r\nnoise of the mooncalves would at times be a vast flat calf-like sound,\r\nat times it rose to an amazed and wrathy bellowing, and again it would\r\nbecome a clogged bestial sound, as though these unseen creatures had\r\nsought to eat and bellow at the same time.\r\n\r\nOur first view was but an inadequate transitory glimpse, yet none the\r\nless disturbing because it was incomplete. Cavor was crawling in front\r\nat the time, and he first was aware of their proximity. He stopped\r\ndead, arresting me with a single gesture.\r\n\r\nA crackling and smashing of the scrub appeared to be advancing directly\r\nupon us, and then, as we squatted close and endeavoured to judge of the\r\nnearness and direction of this noise, there came a terrific bellow\r\nbehind us, so close and vehement that the tops of the bayonet scrub\r\nbent before it, and one felt the breath of it hot and moist. And,\r\nturning about, we saw indistinctly through a crowd of swaying stems the\r\nmooncalf’s shining sides, and the long line of its back loomed out\r\nagainst the sky.\r\n\r\nOf course it is hard for me now to say how much I saw at that time,\r\nbecause my impressions were corrected by subsequent observation. First\r\nof all impressions was its enormous size; the girth of its body was\r\nsome fourscore feet, its length perhaps two hundred. Its sides rose and\r\nfell with its laboured breathing. I perceived that its gigantic, flabby\r\nbody lay along the ground, and that its skin was of a corrugated white,\r\ndappling into blackness along the backbone. But of its feet we saw\r\nnothing. I think also that we saw then the profile at least of the\r\nalmost brainless head, with its fat-encumbered neck, its slobbering\r\nomnivorous mouth, its little nostrils, and tight shut eyes. (For the\r\nmooncalf invariably shuts its eyes in the presence of the sun.) We had\r\na glimpse of a vast red pit as it opened its mouth to bleat and bellow\r\nagain; we had a breath from the pit, and then the monster heeled over\r\nlike a ship, dragged forward along the ground, creasing all its\r\nleathery skin, rolled again, and so wallowed past us, smashing a path\r\namidst the scrub, and was speedily hidden from our eyes by the dense\r\ninterlacings beyond. Another appeared more distantly, and then another,\r\nand then, as though he was guiding these animated lumps of provender to\r\ntheir pasture, a Selenite came momentarily into ken. My grip upon\r\nCavor’s foot became convulsive at the sight of him, and we remained\r\nmotionless and peering long after he had passed out of our range.\r\n\r\nBy contrast with the mooncalves he seemed a trivial being, a mere ant,\r\nscarcely five feet high. He was wearing garments of some leathery\r\nsubstance, so that no portion of his actual body appeared, but of this,\r\nof course, we were entirely ignorant. He presented himself, therefore,\r\nas a compact, bristling creature, having much of the quality of a\r\ncomplicated insect, with whip-like tentacles and a clanging arm\r\nprojecting from his shining cylindrical body case. The form of his head\r\nwas hidden by his enormous many-spiked helmet—we discovered afterwards\r\nthat he used the spikes for prodding refractory mooncalves—and a pair\r\nof goggles of darkened glass, set very much at the side, gave a\r\nbird-like quality to the metallic apparatus that covered his face. His\r\narms did not project beyond his body case, and he carried himself upon\r\nshort legs that, wrapped though they were in warm coverings, seemed to\r\nour terrestrial eyes inordinately flimsy. They had very short thighs,\r\nvery long shanks, and little feet.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his heavy-looking clothing, he was progressing with what\r\nwould be, from the terrestrial point of view, very considerable\r\nstrides, and his clanging arm was busy. The quality of his motion\r\nduring the instant of his passing suggested haste and a certain anger,\r\nand soon after we had lost sight of him we heard the bellow of a\r\nmooncalf change abruptly into a short, sharp squeal followed by the\r\nscuffle of its acceleration. And gradually that bellowing receded, and\r\nthen came to an end, as if the pastures sought had been attained.\r\n\r\nWe listened. For a space the moon world was still. But it was some time\r\nbefore we resumed our crawling search for the vanished sphere.\r\n\r\nWhen next we saw mooncalves they were some little distance away from us\r\nin a place of tumbled rocks. The less vertical surfaces of the rocks\r\nwere thick with a speckled green plant growing in dense mossy clumps,\r\nupon which these creatures were browsing. We stopped at the edge of the\r\nreeds amidst which we were crawling at the sight of them, peering out\r\nat them and looking round for a second glimpse of a Selenite. They lay\r\nagainst their food like stupendous slugs, huge, greasy hulls, eating\r\ngreedily and noisily, with a sort of sobbing avidity. They seemed\r\nmonsters of mere fatness, clumsy and overwhelmed to a degree that would\r\nmake a Smithfield ox seem a model of agility. Their busy, writhing,\r\nchewing mouths, and eyes closed, together with the appetising sound of\r\ntheir munching, made up an effect of animal enjoyment that was\r\nsingularly stimulating to our empty frames.\r\n\r\n“Hogs!” said Cavor, with unusual passion. “Disgusting hogs!” and after\r\none glare of angry envy crawled off through the bushes to our right. I\r\nstayed long enough to see that the speckled plant was quite hopeless\r\nfor human nourishment, then crawled after him, nibbling a quill of it\r\nbetween my teeth.\r\n\r\nPresently we were arrested again by the proximity of a Selenite, and\r\nthis time we were able to observe him more exactly. Now we could see\r\nthat the Selenite covering was indeed clothing, and not a sort of\r\ncrustacean integument. He was quite similar in his costume to the\r\nformer one we had glimpsed, except that ends of something like wadding\r\nwere protruding from his neck, and he stood on a promontory of rock and\r\nmoved his head this way and that, as though he was surveying the\r\ncrater. We lay quite still, fearing to attract his attention if we\r\nmoved, and after a time he turned about and disappeared.\r\n\r\nWe came upon another drove of mooncalves bellowing up a ravine, and\r\nthen we passed over a place of sounds, sounds of beating machinery as\r\nif some huge hall of industry came near the surface there. And while\r\nthese sounds were still about us we came to the edge of a great open\r\nspace, perhaps two hundred yards in diameter, and perfectly level. Save\r\nfor a few lichens that advanced from its margin this space was bare,\r\nand presented a powdery surface of a dusty yellow colour. We were\r\nafraid to strike out across this space, but as it presented less\r\nobstruction to our crawling than the scrub, we went down upon it and\r\nbegan very circumspectly to skirt its edge.\r\n\r\nFor a little while the noises from below ceased and everything, save\r\nfor the faint stir of the growing vegetation, was very still. Then\r\nabruptly there began an uproar, louder, more vehement, and nearer than\r\nany we had so far heard. Of a certainty it came from below.\r\nInstinctively we crouched as flat as we could, ready for a prompt\r\nplunge into the thicket beside us. Each knock and throb seemed to\r\nvibrate through our bodies. Louder grew this throbbing and beating, and\r\nthat irregular vibration increased until the whole moon world seemed to\r\nbe jerking and pulsing.\r\n\r\n“Cover,” whispered Cavor, and I turned towards the bushes.\r\n\r\nAt that instant came a thud like the thud of a gun, and then a thing\r\nhappened—it still haunts me in my dreams. I had turned my head to look\r\nat Cavor’s face, and thrust out my hand in front of me as I did so. And\r\nmy hand met nothing! I plunged suddenly into a bottomless hole!\r\n\r\nMy chest hit something hard, and I found myself with my chin on the\r\nedge of an unfathomable abyss that had suddenly opened beneath me, my\r\nhand extended stiffly into the void. The whole of that flat circular\r\narea was no more than a gigantic lid, that was now sliding sideways\r\nfrom off the pit it had covered into a slot prepared for it.\r\n\r\nHad it not been for Cavor I think I should have remained rigid, hanging\r\nover this margin and staring into the enormous gulf below, until at\r\nlast the edges of the slot scraped me off and hurled me into its\r\ndepths. But Cavor had not received the shock that had paralysed me. He\r\nhad been a little distance from the edge when the lid had first opened,\r\nand perceiving the peril that held me helpless, gripped my legs and\r\npulled me backward. I came into a sitting position, crawled away from\r\nthe edge for a space on all fours, then staggered up and ran after him\r\nacross the thundering, quivering sheet of metal. It seemed to be\r\nswinging open with a steadily accelerated velocity, and the bushes in\r\nfront of me shifted sideways as I ran.\r\n\r\nI was none too soon. Cavor’s back vanished amidst the bristling\r\nthicket, and as I scrambled up after him, the monstrous valve came into\r\nits position with a clang. For a long time we lay panting, not daring\r\nto approach the pit.\r\n\r\nBut at last very cautiously and bit by bit we crept into a position\r\nfrom which we could peer down. The bushes about us creaked and waved\r\nwith the force of a breeze that was blowing down the shaft. We could\r\nsee nothing at first except smooth vertical walls descending at last\r\ninto an impenetrable black. And then very gradually we became aware of\r\na number of very faint and little lights going to and fro.\r\n\r\nFor a time that stupendous gulf of mystery held us so that we forgot\r\neven our sphere. In time, as we grew more accustomed to the darkness,\r\nwe could make out very small, dim, elusive shapes moving about among\r\nthose needle-point illuminations. We peered amazed and incredulous,\r\nunderstanding so little that we could find no words to say. We could\r\ndistinguish nothing that would give us a clue to the meaning of the\r\nfaint shapes we saw.\r\n\r\n“What can it be?” I asked; “what can it be?”\r\n\r\n“The engineering!... They must live in these caverns during the night,\r\nand come out during the day.”\r\n\r\n“Cavor!” I said. “Can they be—_that_—it was something like—men?”\r\n\r\n“_That_ was not a man.”\r\n\r\n“We dare risk nothing!”\r\n\r\n“We dare do nothing until we find the sphere!”\r\n\r\n“We _can_ do nothing until we find the sphere.”\r\n\r\nHe assented with a groan and stirred himself to move. He stared about\r\nhim for a space, sighed, and indicated a direction. We struck out\r\nthrough the jungle. For a time we crawled resolutely, then with\r\ndiminishing vigour. Presently among great shapes of flabby purple there\r\ncame a noise of trampling and cries about us. We lay close, and for a\r\nlong time the sounds went to and fro and very near. But this time we\r\nsaw nothing. I tried to whisper to Cavor that I could hardly go without\r\nfood much longer, but my mouth had become too dry for whispering.\r\n\r\n“Cavor,” I said, “I must have food.”\r\n\r\nHe turned a face full of dismay towards me. “It’s a case for holding\r\nout,” he said.\r\n\r\n“But I _must_,” I said, “and look at my lips!”\r\n\r\n“I’ve been thirsty some time.”\r\n\r\n“If only some of that snow had remained!”\r\n\r\n“It’s clean gone! We’re driving from arctic to tropical at the rate of\r\na degree a minute....”\r\n\r\nI gnawed my hand.\r\n\r\n“The sphere!” he said. “There is nothing for it but the sphere.”\r\n\r\nWe roused ourselves to another spurt of crawling. My mind ran entirely\r\non edible things, on the hissing profundity of summer drinks, more\r\nparticularly I craved for beer. I was haunted by the memory of a\r\nsixteen gallon cask that had swaggered in my Lympne cellar. I thought\r\nof the adjacent larder, and especially of steak and kidney pie—tender\r\nsteak and plenty of kidney, and rich, thick gravy between. Ever and\r\nagain I was seized with fits of hungry yawning. We came to flat places\r\novergrown with fleshy red things, monstrous coralline growths; as we\r\npushed against them they snapped and broke. I noted the quality of the\r\nbroken surfaces. The confounded stuff certainly looked of a biteable\r\ntexture. Then it seemed to me that it smelt rather well.\r\n\r\nI picked up a fragment and sniffed at it.\r\n\r\n“Cavor,” I said in a hoarse undertone.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at me with his face screwed up. “Don’t,” he said. I put down\r\nthe fragment, and we crawled on through this tempting fleshiness for a\r\nspace.\r\n\r\n“Cavor,” I asked, “why _not?_”\r\n\r\n“Poison,” I heard him say, but he did not look round.\r\n\r\nWe crawled some way before I decided.\r\n\r\n“I’ll chance it,” said I.\r\n\r\nHe made a belated gesture to prevent me. I stuffed my mouth full. He\r\ncrouched watching my face, his own twisted into the oddest expression.\r\n“It’s good,” I said.\r\n\r\n“O Lord!” he cried.\r\n\r\nHe watched me munch, his face wrinkled between desire and disapproval,\r\nthen suddenly succumbed to appetite and began to tear off huge\r\nmouthfuls. For a time we did nothing but eat.\r\n\r\nThe stuff was not unlike a terrestrial mushroom, only it was much laxer\r\nin texture, and, as one swallowed it, it warmed the throat. At first we\r\nexperienced a mere mechanical satisfaction in eating; then our blood\r\nbegan to run warmer, and we tingled at the lips and fingers, and then\r\nnew and slightly irrelevant ideas came bubbling up in our minds.\r\n\r\n“It’s good,” said I. “Infernally good! What a home for our surplus\r\npopulation! Our poor surplus population,” and I broke off another large\r\nportion. It filled me with a curiously benevolent satisfaction that\r\nthere was such good food in the moon. The depression of my hunger gave\r\nway to an irrational exhilaration. The dread and discomfort in which I\r\nhad been living vanished entirely. I perceived the moon no longer as a\r\nplanet from which I most earnestly desired the means of escape, but as\r\na possible refuge from human destitution. I think I forgot the\r\nSelenites, the mooncalves, the lid, and the noises completely so soon\r\nas I had eaten that fungus.\r\n\r\nCavor replied to my third repetition of my “surplus population” remark\r\nwith similar words of approval. I felt that my head swam, but I put\r\nthis down to the stimulating effect of food after a long fast.\r\n“Ess’lent discov’ry yours, Cavor,” said I. “Se’nd on’y to the ‘tato.”\r\n\r\n“Whajer mean?” asked Cavor. “‘Scovery of the moon—se’nd on’y to the\r\ntato?”\r\n\r\nI looked at him, shocked at his suddenly hoarse voice, and by the\r\nbadness of his articulation. It occurred to me in a flash that he was\r\nintoxicated, possibly by the fungus. It also occurred to me that he\r\nerred in imagining that he had discovered the moon; he had not\r\ndiscovered it, he had only reached it. I tried to lay my hand on his\r\narm and explain this to him, but the issue was too subtle for his\r\nbrain. It was also unexpectedly difficult to express. After a momentary\r\nattempt to understand me—I remember wondering if the fungus had made my\r\neyes as fishy as his—he set off upon some observations on his own\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n“We are,” he announced with a solemn hiccup, “the creashurs o’ what we\r\neat and drink.”\r\n\r\nHe repeated this, and as I was now in one of my subtle moods, I\r\ndetermined to dispute it. Possibly I wandered a little from the point.\r\nBut Cavor certainly did not attend at all properly. He stood up as well\r\nas he could, putting a hand on my head to steady himself, which was\r\ndisrespectful, and stood staring about him, quite devoid now of any\r\nfear of the moon beings.\r\n\r\nI tried to point out that this was dangerous for some reason that was\r\nnot perfectly clear to me, but the word “dangerous” had somehow got\r\nmixed with “indiscreet,” and came out rather more like “injurious” than\r\neither; and after an attempt to disentangle them, I resumed my\r\nargument, addressing myself principally to the unfamiliar but attentive\r\ncoralline growths on either side. I felt that it was necessary to clear\r\nup this confusion between the moon and a potato at once—I wandered into\r\na long parenthesis on the importance of precision of definition in\r\nargument. I did my best to ignore the fact that my bodily sensations\r\nwere no longer agreeable.\r\n\r\nIn some way that I have now forgotten, my mind was led back to projects\r\nof colonisation. “We must annex this moon,” I said. “There must be no\r\nshilly-shally. This is part of the White Man’s Burthen. Cavor—we\r\nare—_hic_—Satap—mean Satraps! Nempire Cæsar never dreamt. B’in all the\r\nnewspapers. Cavorecia. Bedfordecia. Bedfordecia—hic—Limited.\r\nMean—unlimited! Practically.”\r\n\r\nCertainly I was intoxicated.\r\n\r\nI embarked upon an argument to show the infinite benefits our arrival\r\nwould confer on the moon. I involved myself in a rather difficult proof\r\nthat the arrival of Columbus was, on the whole, beneficial to America.\r\nI found I had forgotten the line of argument I had intended to pursue,\r\nand continued to repeat “sim’lar to C’lumbus,” to fill up time.\r\n\r\nFrom that point my memory of the action of that abominable fungus\r\nbecomes confused. I remember vaguely that we declared our intention of\r\nstanding no nonsense from any confounded insects, that we decided it\r\nill became men to hide shamefully upon a mere satellite, that we\r\nequipped ourselves with huge armfuls of the fungus—whether for missile\r\npurposes or not I do not know—and, heedless of the stabs of the bayonet\r\nscrub, we started forth into the sunshine.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately we must have come upon the Selenites. There were six\r\nof them, and they were marching in single file over a rocky place,\r\nmaking the most remarkable piping and whining sounds. They all seemed\r\nto become aware of us at once, all instantly became silent and\r\nmotionless, like animals, with their faces turned towards us.\r\n\r\nFor a moment I was sobered.\r\n\r\n“Insects,” murmured Cavor, “insects! And they think I’m going to crawl\r\nabout on my stomach—on my vertebrated stomach!\r\n\r\n“Stomach,” he repeated slowly, as though he chewed the indignity.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly, with a sort of fury, he made three vast strides and\r\nleapt towards them. He leapt badly; he made a series of somersaults in\r\nthe air, whirled right over them, and vanished with an enormous splash\r\namidst the cactus bladders. What the Selenites made of this amazing,\r\nand to my mind undignified irruption from another planet, I have no\r\nmeans of guessing. I seem to remember the sight of their backs as they\r\nran in all directions, but I am not sure. All these last incidents\r\nbefore oblivion came are vague and faint in my mind. I know I made a\r\nstep to follow Cavor, and tripped and fell headlong among the rocks. I\r\nwas, I am certain, suddenly and vehemently ill. I seem to remember a\r\nviolent struggle and being gripped by metallic clasps....\r\n\r\nMy next clear recollection is that we were prisoners at we knew not\r\nwhat depths beneath the moon’s surface; we were in darkness amidst\r\nstrange distracting noises; our bodies were covered with scratches and\r\nbruises, and our heads racked with pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\nThe Selenite’s Face\r\n\r\n\r\nI found myself sitting crouched together in a tumultuous darkness. For\r\na long time I could not understand where I was, nor how I had come to\r\nthis perplexity. I thought of the cupboard into which I had been thrust\r\nat times when I was a child, and then of a very dark and noisy bedroom\r\nin which I had slept during an illness. But these sounds about me were\r\nnot the noises I had known, and there was a thin flavour in the air\r\nlike the wind of a stable. Then I supposed we must still be at work\r\nupon the sphere, and that somehow I had got into the cellar of Cavor’s\r\nhouse. I remembered we had finished the sphere, and fancied I must\r\nstill be in it and travelling through space.\r\n\r\n“Cavor,” I said, “cannot we have some light?”\r\n\r\nThere came no answer.\r\n\r\n“Cavor!” I insisted.\r\n\r\nI was answered by a groan. “My head!” I heard him say; “my head!”\r\n\r\nI attempted to press my hands to my brow, which ached, and discovered\r\nthey were tied together. This startled me very much. I brought them up\r\nto my mouth and felt the cold smoothness of metal. They were chained\r\ntogether. I tried to separate my legs and made out they were similarly\r\nfastened, and also that I was fastened to the ground by a much thicker\r\nchain about the middle of my body.\r\n\r\nI was more frightened than I had yet been by anything in all our\r\nstrange experiences. For a time I tugged silently at my bonds. “Cavor!”\r\nI cried out sharply. “Why am I tied? Why have you tied me hand and\r\nfoot?”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t tied you,” he answered. “It’s the Selenites.”\r\n\r\nThe Selenites! My mind hung on that for a space. Then my memories came\r\nback to me: the snowy desolation, the thawing of the air, the growth of\r\nthe plants, our strange hopping and crawling among the rocks and\r\nvegetation of the crater. All the distress of our frantic search for\r\nthe sphere returned to me.... Finally the opening of the great lid that\r\ncovered the pit!\r\n\r\nThen as I strained to trace our later movements down to our present\r\nplight, the pain in my head became intolerable. I came to an\r\ninsurmountable barrier, an obstinate blank.\r\n\r\n“Cavor!”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Where are we?”\r\n\r\n“How should I know?”\r\n\r\n“Are we dead?”\r\n\r\n“What nonsense!”\r\n\r\n“They’ve got us, then!”\r\n\r\nHe made no answer but a grunt. The lingering traces of the poison\r\nseemed to make him oddly irritable.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean to do?”\r\n\r\n“How should I know what to do?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, very well!” said I, and became silent. Presently, I was roused\r\nfrom a stupor. “O _Lord!_” I cried; “I wish you’d stop that buzzing!”\r\n\r\nWe lapsed into silence again, listening to the dull confusion of noises\r\nlike the muffled sounds of a street or factory that filled our ears. I\r\ncould make nothing of it, my mind pursued first one rhythm and then\r\nanother, and questioned it in vain. But after a long time I became\r\naware of a new and sharper element, not mingling with the rest but\r\nstanding out, as it were, against that cloudy background of sound. It\r\nwas a series of relatively very little definite sounds, tappings and\r\nrubbings, like a loose spray of ivy against a window or a bird moving\r\nabout upon a box. We listened and peered about us, but the darkness was\r\na velvet pall. There followed a noise like the subtle movement of the\r\nwards of a well-oiled lock. And then there appeared before me, hanging\r\nas it seemed in an immensity of black, a thin bright line.\r\n\r\n“Look!” whispered Cavor very softly.\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know.”\r\n\r\nWe stared.\r\n\r\nThe thin bright line became a band, and broader and paler. It took upon\r\nitself the quality of a bluish light falling upon a white-washed wall.\r\nIt ceased to be parallel-sided; it developed a deep indentation on one\r\nside. I turned to remark this to Cavor, and was amazed to see his ear\r\nin a brilliant illumination—all the rest of him in shadow. I twisted my\r\nhead round as well as my bonds would permit. “Cavor,” I said, “it’s\r\nbehind!”\r\n\r\nHis ear vanished—gave place to an eye!\r\n\r\nSuddenly the crack that had been admitting the light broadened out, and\r\nrevealed itself as the space of an opening door. Beyond was a sapphire\r\nvista, and in the doorway stood a grotesque outline silhouetted against\r\nthe glare.\r\n\r\nWe both made convulsive efforts to turn, and failing, sat staring over\r\nour shoulders at this. My first impression was of some clumsy quadruped\r\nwith lowered head. Then I perceived it was the slender pinched body and\r\nshort and extremely attenuated bandy legs of a Selenite, with his head\r\ndepressed between his shoulders. He was without the helmet and body\r\ncovering they wear upon the exterior.\r\n\r\nHe was a blank, black figure to us, but instinctively our imaginations\r\nsupplied features to his very human outline. I, at least, took it\r\ninstantly that he was somewhat hunchbacked, with a high forehead and\r\nlong features.\r\n\r\nHe came forward three steps and paused for a time. His movements seemed\r\nabsolutely noiseless. Then he came forward again. He walked like a\r\nbird, his feet fell one in front of the other. He stepped out of the\r\nray of light that came through the doorway, and it seemed as though he\r\nvanished altogether in the shadow.\r\n\r\nFor a moment my eyes sought him in the wrong place, and then I\r\nperceived him standing facing us both in the full light. Only the human\r\nfeatures I had attributed to him were not there at all!\r\n\r\nOf course I ought to have expected that, only I didn’t. It came to me\r\nas an absolute, for a moment an overwhelming shock. It seemed as though\r\nit wasn’t a face, as though it must needs be a mask, a horror, a\r\ndeformity, that would presently be disavowed or explained. There was no\r\nnose, and the thing had dull bulging eyes at the side—in the silhouette\r\nI had supposed they were ears. There were no ears.... I have tried to\r\ndraw one of these heads, but I cannot. There was a mouth, downwardly\r\ncurved, like a human mouth in a face that stares ferociously....\r\n\r\nThe neck on which the head was poised was jointed in three places,\r\nalmost like the short joints in the leg of a crab. The joints of the\r\nlimbs I could not see, because of the puttee-like straps in which they\r\nwere swathed, and which formed the only clothing the being wore.\r\n\r\nThere the thing was, looking at us!\r\n\r\nAt the time my mind was taken up by the mad impossibility of the\r\ncreature. I suppose he also was amazed, and with more reason, perhaps,\r\nfor amazement than we. Only, confound him! he did not show it. We did\r\nat least know what had brought about this meeting of incompatible\r\ncreatures. But conceive how it would seem to decent Londoners, for\r\nexample, to come upon a couple of living things, as big as men and\r\nabsolutely unlike any other earthly animals, careering about among the\r\nsheep in Hyde Park! It must have taken him like that.\r\n\r\nFigure us! We were bound hand and foot, fagged and filthy; our beards\r\ntwo inches long, our faces scratched and bloody. Cavor you must imagine\r\nin his knickerbockers (torn in several places by the bayonet scrub) his\r\nJaegar shirt and old cricket cap, his wiry hair wildly disordered, a\r\ntail to every quarter of the heavens. In that blue light his face did\r\nnot look red but very dark, his lips and the drying blood upon my hands\r\nseemed black. If possible I was in a worse plight than he, on account\r\nof the yellow fungus into which I had jumped. Our jackets were\r\nunbuttoned, and our shoes had been taken off and lay at our feet. And\r\nwe were sitting with our backs to this queer bluish light, peering at\r\nsuch a monster as Durer might have invented.\r\n\r\nCavor broke the silence; started to speak, went hoarse, and cleared his\r\nthroat. Outside began a terrific bellowing, as if a mooncalf were in\r\ntrouble. It ended in a shriek, and everything was still again.\r\n\r\nPresently the Selenite turned about, flickered into the shadow, stood\r\nfor a moment retrospective at the door, and then closed it on us; and\r\nonce more we were in that murmurous mystery of darkness into which we\r\nhad awakened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\nMr. Cavor Makes Some Suggestions\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a time neither of us spoke. To focus together all the things we had\r\nbrought upon ourselves seemed beyond my mental powers.\r\n\r\n“They’ve got us,” I said at last.\r\n\r\n“It was that fungus.”\r\n\r\n“Well—if I hadn’t taken it we should have fainted and starved.”\r\n\r\n“We might have found the sphere.”\r\n\r\nI lost my temper at his persistence, and swore to myself. For a time we\r\nhated one another in silence. I drummed with my fingers on the floor\r\nbetween my knees, and gritted the links of my fetters together.\r\nPresently I was forced to talk again.\r\n\r\n“What do you make of it, anyhow?” I asked humbly.\r\n\r\n“They are reasonable creatures—they can make things and do things.\r\nThose lights we saw...”\r\n\r\nHe stopped. It was clear he could make nothing of it.\r\n\r\nWhen he spoke again it was to confess, “After all, they are more human\r\nthan we had a right to expect. I suppose—”\r\n\r\nHe stopped irritatingly.\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose, anyhow—on any planet where there is an intelligent\r\nanimal—it will carry its brain case upward, and have hands, and walk\r\nerect.”\r\n\r\nPresently he broke away in another direction.\r\n\r\n“We are some way in,” he said. “I mean—perhaps a couple of thousand\r\nfeet or more.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“It’s cooler. And our voices are so much louder. That faded quality—it\r\nhas altogether gone. And the feeling in one’s ears and throat.”\r\n\r\nI had not noted that, but I did now.\r\n\r\n“The air is denser. We must be some depths—a mile even, we may\r\nbe—inside the moon.”\r\n\r\n“We never thought of a world inside the moon.”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“How could we?”\r\n\r\n“We might have done. Only one gets into habits of mind.”\r\n\r\nHe thought for a time.\r\n\r\n“_Now_,” he said, “it seems such an obvious thing.”\r\n\r\n“Of course! The moon must be enormously cavernous, with an atmosphere\r\nwithin, and at the centre of its caverns a sea.\r\n\r\n“One knew that the moon had a lower specific gravity than the earth,\r\none knew that it had little air or water outside, one knew, too, that\r\nit was sister planet to the earth, and that it was unaccountable that\r\nit should be different in composition. The inference that it was\r\nhollowed out was as clear as day. And yet one never saw it as a fact.\r\nKepler, of course—”\r\n\r\nHis voice had the interest now of a man who has discerned a pretty\r\nsequence of reasoning.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, “Kepler with his _sub-volvani_ was right after all.”\r\n\r\n“I wish you had taken the trouble to find that out before we came,” I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHe answered nothing, buzzing to himself softly, as he pursued his\r\nthoughts. My temper was going.\r\n\r\n“What do you think has become of the sphere, anyhow?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Lost,” he said, like a man who answers an uninteresting question.\r\n\r\n“Among those plants?”\r\n\r\n“Unless they find it.”\r\n\r\n“And then?”\r\n\r\n“How can I tell?”\r\n\r\n“Cavor,” I said, with a sort of hysterical bitterness, “things look\r\nbright for my Company...”\r\n\r\nHe made no answer.\r\n\r\n“Good Lord!” I exclaimed. “Just think of all the trouble we took to get\r\ninto this pickle! What did we come for? What are we after? What was the\r\nmoon to us or we to the moon? We wanted too much, we tried too much. We\r\nought to have started the little things first. It was you proposed the\r\nmoon! Those Cavorite spring blinds! I am certain we could have worked\r\nthem for terrestrial purposes. Certain! Did you really understand what\r\nI proposed? A steel cylinder—”\r\n\r\n“Rubbish!” said Cavor.\r\n\r\nWe ceased to converse.\r\n\r\nFor a time Cavor kept up a broken monologue without much help from me.\r\n\r\n“If they find it,” he began, “if they find it ... what will they do\r\nwith it? Well, that’s a question. It may be that’s _the_ question. They\r\nwon’t understand it, anyhow. If they understood that sort of thing they\r\nwould have come long since to the earth. Would they? Why shouldn’t\r\nthey? But they would have sent something—they couldn’t keep their hands\r\noff such a possibility. No! But they will examine it. Clearly they are\r\nintelligent and inquisitive. They will examine it—get inside it—trifle\r\nwith the studs. Off! ... That would mean the moon for us for all the\r\nrest of our lives. Strange creatures, strange knowledge....”\r\n\r\n“As for strange knowledge—” said I, and language failed me.\r\n\r\n“Look here, Bedford,” said Cavor, “you came on this expedition of your\r\nown free will.”\r\n\r\n“You said to me, ‘Call it prospecting’.”\r\n\r\n“There’s always risks in prospecting.”\r\n\r\n“Especially when you do it unarmed and without thinking out every\r\npossibility.”\r\n\r\n“I was so taken up with the sphere. The thing rushed on us, and carried\r\nus away.”\r\n\r\n“Rushed on _me_, you mean.”\r\n\r\n“Rushed on me just as much. How was I to know when I set to work on\r\nmolecular physics that the business would bring me here—of all places?”\r\n\r\n“It’s this accursed science,” I cried. “It’s the very Devil. The\r\nmediæval priests and persecutors were right and the Moderns are all\r\nwrong. You tamper with it—and it offers you gifts. And directly you\r\ntake them it knocks you to pieces in some unexpected way. Old passions\r\nand new weapons—now it upsets your religion, now it upsets your social\r\nideas, now it whirls you off to desolation and misery!”\r\n\r\n“Anyhow, it’s no use your quarrelling with me _now_. These\r\ncreatures—these Selenites, or whatever we choose to call them—have got\r\nus tied hand and foot. Whatever temper you choose to go through with it\r\nin, you will have to go through with it.... We have experiences before\r\nus that will need all our coolness.”\r\n\r\nHe paused as if he required my assent. But I sat sulking. “Confound\r\nyour science!” I said.\r\n\r\n“The problem is communication. Gestures, I fear, will be different.\r\nPointing, for example. No creatures but men and monkeys point.”\r\n\r\nThat was too obviously wrong for me. “Pretty nearly every animal,” I\r\ncried, “points with its eyes or nose.”\r\n\r\nCavor meditated over that. “Yes,” he said at last, “and we don’t.\r\nThere’s such differences—such differences!”\r\n\r\n“One might.... But how can I tell? There is speech. The sounds they\r\nmake, a sort of fluting and piping. I don’t see how we are to imitate\r\nthat. Is it their speech, that sort of thing? They may have different\r\nsenses, different means of communication. Of course they are minds and\r\nwe are minds; there must be something in common. Who knows how far we\r\nmay not get to an understanding?”\r\n\r\n“The things are outside us,” I said. “They’re more different from us\r\nthan the strangest animals on earth. They are a different clay. What is\r\nthe good of talking like this?”\r\n\r\nCavor thought. “I don’t see that. Where there are minds they will have\r\nsomething _similar_—even though they have been evolved on different\r\nplanets. Of course if it was a question of instincts, if we or they are\r\nno more than animals—”\r\n\r\n“Well, _are_ they? They’re much more like ants on their hind legs than\r\nhuman beings, and who ever got to any sort of understanding with ants?”\r\n\r\n“But these machines and clothing! No, I don’t hold with you, Bedford.\r\nThe difference is wide—”\r\n\r\n“It’s insurmountable.”\r\n\r\n“The resemblance must bridge it. I remember reading once a paper by the\r\nlate Professor Galton on the possibility of communication between the\r\nplanets. Unhappily, at that time it did not seem probable that that\r\nwould be of any material benefit to me, and I fear I did not give it\r\nthe attention I should have done—in view of this state of affairs.\r\nYet.... Now, let me see!\r\n\r\n“His idea was to begin with those broad truths that must underlie all\r\nconceivable mental existences and establish a basis on those. The great\r\nprinciples of geometry, to begin with. He proposed to take some leading\r\nproposition of Euclid’s, and show by construction that its truth was\r\nknown to us, to demonstrate, for example, that the angles at the base\r\nof an isosceles triangle are equal, and that if the equal sides be\r\nproduced the angles on the other side of the base are equal also, or\r\nthat the square on the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal\r\nto the sum of the squares on the two other sides. By demonstrating our\r\nknowledge of these things we should demonstrate our possession of a\r\nreasonable intelligence.... Now, suppose I ... I might draw the\r\ngeometrical figure with a wet finger, or even trace it in the air....”\r\n\r\nHe fell silent. I sat meditating his words. For a time his wild hope of\r\ncommunication, of interpretation, with these weird beings held me. Then\r\nthat angry despair that was a part of my exhaustion and physical misery\r\nresumed its sway. I perceived with a sudden novel vividness the\r\nextraordinary folly of everything I had ever done. “Ass!” I said; “oh,\r\nass, unutterable ass.... I seem to exist only to go about doing\r\npreposterous things. Why did we ever leave the thing? ... Hopping about\r\nlooking for patents and concessions in the craters of the moon!... If\r\nonly we had had the sense to fasten a handkerchief to a stick to show\r\nwhere we had left the sphere!”\r\n\r\nI subsided, fuming.\r\n\r\n“It is clear,” meditated Cavor, “they are intelligent. One can\r\nhypothecate certain things. As they have not killed us at once, they\r\nmust have ideas of mercy. Mercy! at any rate of restraint. Possibly of\r\nintercourse. They may meet us. And this apartment and the glimpses we\r\nhad of its guardian. These fetters! A high degree of intelligence...”\r\n\r\n“I wish to heaven,” cried I, “I’d thought even twice! Plunge after\r\nplunge. First one fluky start and then another. It was my confidence in\r\nyou! _Why_ didn’t I stick to my play? That was what I was equal to.\r\nThat was my world and the life I was made for. I could have finished\r\nthat play. I’m certain ... it was a good play. I had the scenario as\r\ngood as done. Then.... Conceive it! leaping to the moon!\r\nPractically—I’ve thrown my life away! That old woman in the inn near\r\nCanterbury had better sense.”\r\n\r\nI looked up, and stopped in mid-sentence. The darkness had given place\r\nto that bluish light again. The door was opening, and several noiseless\r\nSelenites were coming into the chamber. I became quite still, staring\r\nat their grotesque faces.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly my sense of disagreeable strangeness changed to interest.\r\nI perceived that the foremost and second carried bowls. One elemental\r\nneed at least our minds could understand in common. They were bowls of\r\nsome metal that, like our fetters, looked dark in that bluish light;\r\nand each contained a number of whitish fragments. All the cloudy pain\r\nand misery that oppressed me rushed together and took the shape of\r\nhunger. I eyed these bowls wolfishly, and, though it returned to me in\r\ndreams, at that time it seemed a small matter that at the end of the\r\narms that lowered one towards me were not hands, but a sort of flap and\r\nthumb, like the end of an elephant’s trunk. The stuff in the bowl was\r\nloose in texture, and whitish brown in colour—rather like lumps of some\r\ncold souffle, and it smelt faintly like mushrooms. From a partially\r\ndivided carcass of a mooncalf that we presently saw, I am inclined to\r\nbelieve it must have been mooncalf flesh.\r\n\r\nMy hands were so tightly chained that I could barely contrive to reach\r\nthe bowl; but when they saw the effort I made, two of them dexterously\r\nreleased one of the turns about my wrist. Their tentacle hands were\r\nsoft and cold to my skin. I immediately seized a mouthful of the food.\r\nIt had the same laxness in texture that all organic structures seem to\r\nhave upon the moon; it tasted rather like a gauffre or a damp meringue,\r\nbut in no way was it disagreeable. I took two other mouthfuls. “I\r\n_wanted_—foo’!” said I, tearing off a still larger piece....\r\n\r\nFor a time we ate with an utter absence of self-consciousness. We ate\r\nand presently drank like tramps in a soup kitchen. Never before nor\r\nsince have I been hungry to the ravenous pitch, and save that I have\r\nhad this very experience I could never have believed that, a quarter of\r\na million of miles out of our proper world, in utter perplexity of\r\nsoul, surrounded, watched, touched by beings more grotesque and inhuman\r\nthan the worst creations of a nightmare, it would be possible for me to\r\neat in utter forgetfulness of all these things. They stood about us\r\nwatching us, and ever and again making a slight elusive twittering that\r\nstood, I suppose, in the stead of speech. I did not even shiver at\r\ntheir touch. And when the first zeal of my feeding was over, I could\r\nnote that Cavor, too, had been eating with the same shameless abandon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\nExperiments in intercourse\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen at last we had made an end of eating, the Selenites linked our\r\nhands closely together again, and then untwisted the chains about our\r\nfeet and rebound them, so as to give us a limited freedom of movement.\r\nThen they unfastened the chains about our waists. To do all this they\r\nhad to handle us freely, and ever and again one of their queer heads\r\ncame down close to my face, or a soft tentacle-hand touched my head or\r\nneck. I don’t remember that I was afraid then or repelled by their\r\nproximity. I think that our incurable anthropomorphism made us imagine\r\nthere were human heads inside their masks. The skin, like everything\r\nelse, looked bluish, but that was on account of the light; and it was\r\nhard and shiny, quite in the beetle-wing fashion, not soft, or moist,\r\nor hairy, as a vertebrated animal’s would be. Along the crest of the\r\nhead was a low ridge of whitish spines running from back to front, and\r\na much larger ridge curved on either side over the eyes. The Selenite\r\nwho untied me used his mouth to help his hands.\r\n\r\n“They seem to be releasing us,” said Cavor. “Remember we are on the\r\nmoon! Make no sudden movements!”\r\n\r\n“Are you going to try that geometry?”\r\n\r\n“If I get a chance. But, of course, they may make an advance first.”\r\n\r\nWe remained passive, and the Selenites, having finished their\r\narrangements, stood back from us, and seemed to be looking at us. I say\r\nseemed to be, because as their eyes were at the side and not in front,\r\none had the same difficulty in determining the direction in which they\r\nwere looking as one has in the case of a hen or a fish. They conversed\r\nwith one another in their reedy tones, that seemed to me impossible to\r\nimitate or define. The door behind us opened wider, and, glancing over\r\nmy shoulder, I saw a vague large space beyond, in which quite a little\r\ncrowd of Selenites were standing. They seemed a curiously miscellaneous\r\nrabble.\r\n\r\n“Do they want us to imitate those sounds?” I asked Cavor.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think so,” he said.\r\n\r\n“It seems to me that they are trying to make us understand something.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t make anything of their gestures. Do you notice this one, who\r\nis worrying with his head like a man with an uncomfortable collar?”\r\n\r\n“Let us shake our heads at him.”\r\n\r\nWe did that, and finding it ineffectual, attempted an imitation of the\r\nSelenites’ movements. That seemed to interest them. At any rate they\r\nall set up the same movement. But as that seemed to lead to nothing, we\r\ndesisted at last and so did they, and fell into a piping argument among\r\nthemselves. Then one of them, shorter and very much thicker than the\r\nothers, and with a particularly wide mouth, squatted down suddenly\r\nbeside Cavor, and put his hands and feet in the same posture as Cavor’s\r\nwere bound, and then by a dexterous movement stood up.\r\n\r\n“Cavor,” I shouted, “they want us to get up!”\r\n\r\nHe stared open-mouthed. “That’s it!” he said.\r\n\r\nAnd with much heaving and grunting, because our hands were tied\r\ntogether, we contrived to struggle to our feet. The Selenites made way\r\nfor our elephantine heavings, and seemed to twitter more volubly. As\r\nsoon as we were on our feet the thick-set Selenite came and patted each\r\nof our faces with his tentacles, and walked towards the open doorway.\r\nThat also was plain enough, and we followed him. We saw that four of\r\nthe Selenites standing in the doorway were much taller than the others,\r\nand clothed in the same manner as those we had seen in the crater,\r\nnamely, with spiked round helmets and cylindrical body-cases, and that\r\neach of the four carried a goad with spike and guard made of that same\r\ndull-looking metal as the bowls. These four closed about us, one on\r\neither side of each of us, as we emerged from our chamber into the\r\ncavern from which the light had come.\r\n\r\nWe did not get our impression of that cavern all at once. Our attention\r\nwas taken up by the movements and attitudes of the Selenites\r\nimmediately about us, and by the necessity of controlling our motion,\r\nlest we should startle and alarm them and ourselves by some excessive\r\nstride. In front of us was the short, thick-set being who had solved\r\nthe problem of asking us to get up, moving with gestures that seemed,\r\nalmost all of them, intelligible to us, inviting us to follow him. His\r\nspout-like face turned from one of us to the other with a quickness\r\nthat was clearly interrogative. For a time, I say, we were taken up\r\nwith these things.\r\n\r\nBut at last the great place that formed a background to our movements\r\nasserted itself. It became apparent that the source of much, at least,\r\nof the tumult of sounds which had filled our ears ever since we had\r\nrecovered from the stupefaction of the fungus was a vast mass of\r\nmachinery in active movement, whose flying and whirling parts were\r\nvisible indistinctly over the heads and between the bodies of the\r\nSelenites who walked about us. And not only did the web of sounds that\r\nfilled the air proceed from this mechanism, but also the peculiar blue\r\nlight that irradiated the whole place. We had taken it as a natural\r\nthing that a subterranean cavern should be artificially lit, and even\r\nnow, though the fact was patent to my eyes, I did not really grasp its\r\nimport until presently the darkness came. The meaning and structure of\r\nthis huge apparatus we saw I cannot explain, because we neither of us\r\nlearnt what it was for or how it worked. One after another, big shafts\r\nof metal flung out and up from its centre, their heads travelling in\r\nwhat seemed to me to be a parabolic path; each dropped a sort of\r\ndangling arm as it rose towards the apex of its flight and plunged down\r\ninto a vertical cylinder, forcing this down before it. About it moved\r\nthe shapes of tenders, little figures that seemed vaguely different\r\nfrom the beings about us. As each of the three dangling arms of the\r\nmachine plunged down, there was a clank and then a roaring, and out of\r\nthe top of the vertical cylinder came pouring this incandescent\r\nsubstance that lit the place, and ran over as milk runs over a boiling\r\npot, and dripped luminously into a tank of light below. It was a cold\r\nblue light, a sort of phosphorescent glow but infinitely brighter, and\r\nfrom the tanks into which it fell it ran in conduits athwart the\r\ncavern.\r\n\r\nThud, thud, thud, thud, came the sweeping arms of this unintelligible\r\napparatus, and the light substance hissed and poured. At first the\r\nthing seemed only reasonably large and near to us, and then I saw how\r\nexceedingly little the Selenites upon it seemed, and I realised the\r\nfull immensity of cavern and machine. I looked from this tremendous\r\naffair to the faces of the Selenites with a new respect. I stopped, and\r\nCavor stopped, and stared at this thunderous engine.\r\n\r\n“But this is stupendous!” I said. “What can it be for?”\r\n\r\nCavor’s blue-lit face was full of an intelligent respect. “I can’t\r\ndream! Surely these beings— Men could not make a thing like that! Look\r\nat those arms, are they on connecting rods?”\r\n\r\nThe thick-set Selenite had gone some paces unheeded. He came back and\r\nstood between us and the great machine. I avoided seeing him, because I\r\nguessed somehow that his idea was to beckon us onward. He walked away\r\nin the direction he wished us to go, and turned and came back, and\r\nflicked our faces to attract our attention.\r\n\r\nCavor and I looked at one another.\r\n\r\n“Cannot we show him we are interested in the machine?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Cavor. “We’ll try that.” He turned to our guide and smiled,\r\nand pointed to the machine, and pointed again, and then to his head,\r\nand then to the machine. By some defect of reasoning he seemed to\r\nimagine that broken English might help these gestures. “Me look ‘im,”\r\nhe said, “me think ‘im very much. Yes.”\r\n\r\nHis behaviour seemed to check the Selenites in their desire for our\r\nprogress for a moment. They faced one another, their queer heads moved,\r\nthe twittering voices came quick and liquid. Then one of them, a lean,\r\ntall creature, with a sort of mantle added to the puttee in which the\r\nothers were dressed, twisted his elephant trunk of a hand about Cavor’s\r\nwaist, and pulled him gently to follow our guide, who again went on\r\nahead. Cavor resisted. “We may just as well begin explaining ourselves\r\nnow. They may think we are new animals, a new sort of mooncalf perhaps!\r\nIt is most important that we should show an intelligent interest from\r\nthe outset.”\r\n\r\nHe began to shake his head violently. “No, no,” he said, “me not come\r\non one minute. Me look at ‘im.”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t there some geometrical point you might bring in _apropos_ of\r\nthat affair?” I suggested, as the Selenites conferred again.\r\n\r\n“Possibly a parabolic—” he began.\r\n\r\nHe yelled loudly, and leaped six feet or more!\r\n\r\nOne of the four armed moon-men had pricked him with a goad!\r\n\r\nI turned on the goad-bearer behind me with a swift threatening gesture,\r\nand he started back. This and Cavor’s sudden shout and leap clearly\r\nastonished all the Selenites. They receded hastily, facing us. For one\r\nof those moments that seem to last for ever, we stood in angry protest,\r\nwith a scattered semicircle of these inhuman beings about us.\r\n\r\n“He pricked me!” said Cavor, with a catching of the voice.\r\n\r\n“I saw him,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“Confound it!” I said to the Selenites; “we’re not going to stand that!\r\nWhat on earth do you take us for?”\r\n\r\nI glanced quickly right and left. Far away across the blue wilderness\r\nof cavern I saw a number of other Selenites running towards us; broad\r\nand slender they were, and one with a larger head than the others. The\r\ncavern spread wide and low, and receded in every direction into\r\ndarkness. Its roof, I remember, seemed to bulge down as if with the\r\nweight of the vast thickness of rocks that prisoned us. There was no\r\nway out of it—no way out of it. Above, below, in every direction, was\r\nthe unknown, and these inhuman creatures, with goads and gestures,\r\nconfronting us, and we two unsupported men!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\nThe Giddy Bridge\r\n\r\n\r\nJust for a moment that hostile pause endured. I suppose that both we\r\nand the Selenites did some very rapid thinking. My clearest impression\r\nwas that there was nothing to put my back against, and that we were\r\nbound to be surrounded and killed. The overwhelming folly of our\r\npresence there loomed over me in black, enormous reproach. Why had I\r\never launched myself on this mad, inhuman expedition?\r\n\r\nCavor came to my side and laid his hand on my arm. His pale and\r\nterrified face was ghastly in the blue light.\r\n\r\n“We can’t do anything,” he said. “It’s a mistake. They don’t\r\nunderstand. We must go. As they want us to go.”\r\n\r\nI looked down at him, and then at the fresh Selenites who were coming\r\nto help their fellows. “If I had my hands free—”\r\n\r\n“It’s no use,” he panted.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll go.”\r\n\r\nAnd he turned about and led the way in the direction that had been\r\nindicated for us.\r\n\r\nI followed, trying to look as subdued as possible, and feeling at the\r\nchains about my wrists. My blood was boiling. I noted nothing more of\r\nthat cavern, though it seemed to take a long time before we had marched\r\nacross it, or if I noted anything I forgot it as I saw it. My thoughts\r\nwere concentrated, I think, upon my chains and the Selenites, and\r\nparticularly upon the helmeted ones with the goads. At first they\r\nmarched parallel with us, and at a respectful distance, but presently\r\nthey were overtaken by three others, and then they drew nearer, until\r\nthey were within arms length again. I winced like a beaten horse as\r\nthey came near to us. The shorter, thicker Selenite marched at first on\r\nour right flank, but presently came in front of us again.\r\n\r\nHow well the picture of that grouping has bitten into my brain; the\r\nback of Cavor’s downcast head just in front of me, and the dejected\r\ndroop of his shoulders, and our guide’s gaping visage, perpetually\r\njerking about him, and the goad-bearers on either side, watchful, yet\r\nopen-mouthed—a blue monochrome. And after all, I _do_ remember one\r\nother thing besides the purely personal affair, which is, that a sort\r\nof gutter came presently across the floor of the cavern, and then ran\r\nalong by the side of the path of rock we followed. And it was full of\r\nthat same bright blue luminous stuff that flowed out of the great\r\nmachine. I walked close beside it, and I can testify it radiated not a\r\nparticle of heat. It was brightly shining, and yet it was neither\r\nwarmer nor colder than anything else in the cavern.\r\n\r\nClang, clang, clang, we passed right under the thumping levers of\r\nanother vast machine, and so came at last to a wide tunnel, in which we\r\ncould even hear the pad, pad, of our shoeless feet, and which, save for\r\nthe trickling thread of blue to the right of us, was quite unlit. The\r\nshadows made gigantic travesties of our shapes and those of the\r\nSelenites on the irregular wall and roof of the tunnel. Ever and again\r\ncrystals in the walls of the tunnel scintillated like gems, ever and\r\nagain the tunnel expanded into a stalactitic cavern, or gave off\r\nbranches that vanished into darkness.\r\n\r\nWe seemed to be marching down that tunnel for a long time. “Trickle,\r\ntrickle,” went the flowing light very softly, and our footfalls and\r\ntheir echoes made an irregular paddle, paddle. My mind settled down to\r\nthe question of my chains. If I were to slip off one turn _so_, and\r\nthen to twist it _so_ ...\r\n\r\nIf I tried to do it very gradually, would they see I was slipping my\r\nwrist out of the looser turn? If they did, what would they do?\r\n\r\n“Bedford,” said Cavor, “it goes down. It keeps on going down.”\r\n\r\nHis remark roused me from my sullen pre-occupation.\r\n\r\n“If they wanted to kill us,” he said, dropping back to come level with\r\nme, “there is no reason why they should not have done it.”\r\n\r\n“No,” I admitted, “that’s true.”\r\n\r\n“They don’t understand us,” he said, “they think we are merely strange\r\nanimals, some wild sort of mooncalf birth, perhaps. It will be only\r\nwhen they have observed us better that they will begin to think we have\r\nminds—”\r\n\r\n“When you trace those geometrical problems,” said I.\r\n\r\n“It may be that.”\r\n\r\nWe tramped on for a space.\r\n\r\n“You see,” said Cavor, “these may be Selenites of a lower class.”\r\n\r\n“The infernal fools!” said I viciously, glancing at their exasperating\r\nfaces.\r\n\r\n“If we endure what they do to us—”\r\n\r\n“We’ve got to endure it,” said I.\r\n\r\n“There may be others less stupid. This is the mere outer fringe of\r\ntheir world. It must go down and down, cavern, passage, tunnel, down at\r\nlast to the sea—hundreds of miles below.”\r\n\r\nHis words made me think of the mile or so of rock and tunnel that might\r\nbe over our heads already. It was like a weight dropping on my\r\nshoulders. “Away from the sun and air,” I said. “Even a mine half a\r\nmile deep is stuffy.”\r\n\r\n“This is not, anyhow. It’s probable—Ventilation! The air would blow\r\nfrom the dark side of the moon to the sunlit, and all the carbonic acid\r\nwould well out there and feed those plants. Up this tunnel, for\r\nexample, there is quite a breeze. And what a world it must be. The\r\nearnest we have in that shaft, and those machines—”\r\n\r\n“And the goad,” I said. “Don’t forget the goad!”\r\n\r\nHe walked a little in front of me for a time.\r\n\r\n“Even that goad—” he said.\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“I was angry at the time. But—it was perhaps necessary we should get\r\non. They have different skins, and probably different nerves. They may\r\nnot understand our objection—just as a being from Mars might not like\r\nour earthly habit of nudging.”\r\n\r\n“They’d better be careful how they nudge _me_.”\r\n\r\n“And about that geometry. After all, their way is a way of\r\nunderstanding, too. They begin with the elements of life and not of\r\nthought. Food. Compulsion. Pain. They strike at fundamentals.”\r\n\r\n“There’s no doubt about _that_,” I said.\r\n\r\nHe went on to talk of the enormous and wonderful world into which we\r\nwere being taken. I realised slowly from his tone, that even now he was\r\nnot absolutely in despair at the prospect of going ever deeper into\r\nthis inhuman planet-burrow. His mind ran on machines and invention, to\r\nthe exclusion of a thousand dark things that beset me. It wasn’t that\r\nhe intended to make any use of these things, he simply wanted to know\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“After all,” he said, “this is a tremendous occasion. It is the meeting\r\nof two worlds! What are we going to see? Think of what is below us\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“We shan’t see much if the light isn’t better,” I remarked.\r\n\r\n“This is only the outer crust. Down below— On this scale— There will be\r\neverything. Do you notice how different they seem one from another? The\r\nstory we shall take back!”\r\n\r\n“Some rare sort of animal,” I said, “might comfort himself in that way\r\nwhile they were bringing him to the Zoo.... It doesn’t follow that we\r\nare going to be shown all these things.”\r\n\r\n“When they find we have reasonable minds,” said Cavor, “they will want\r\nto learn about the earth. Even if they have no generous emotions, they\r\nwill teach in order to learn.... And the things they must know! The\r\nunanticipated things!”\r\n\r\nHe went on to speculate on the possibility of their knowing things he\r\nhad never hoped to learn on earth, speculating in that way, with a raw\r\nwound from that goad already in his skin! Much that he said I forget,\r\nfor my attention was drawn to the fact that the tunnel along which we\r\nhad been marching was opening out wider and wider. We seemed, from the\r\nfeeling of the air, to be going out into a huge space. But how big the\r\nspace might really be we could not tell, because it was unlit. Our\r\nlittle stream of light ran in a dwindling thread and vanished far\r\nahead. Presently the rocky walls had vanished altogether on either\r\nhand. There was nothing to be seen but the path in front of us and the\r\ntrickling hurrying rivulet of blue phosphorescence. The figures of\r\nCavor and the guiding Selenite marched before me, the sides of their\r\nlegs and heads that were towards the rivulet were clear and bright\r\nblue, their darkened sides, now that the reflection of the tunnel wall\r\nno longer lit them, merged indistinguishably in the darkness beyond.\r\n\r\nAnd soon I perceived that we were approaching a declivity of some sort,\r\nbecause the little blue stream dipped suddenly out of sight.\r\n\r\nIn another moment, as it seemed, we had reached the edge. The shining\r\nstream gave one meander of hesitation and then rushed over. It fell to\r\na depth at which the sound of its descent was absolutely lost to us.\r\nFar below was a bluish glow, a sort of blue mist—at an infinite\r\ndistance below. And the darkness the stream dropped out of became\r\nutterly void and black, save that a thing like a plank projected from\r\nthe edge of the cliff and stretched out and faded and vanished\r\naltogether. There was a warm air blowing up out of the gulf.\r\n\r\nFor a moment I and Cavor stood as near the edge as we dared, peering\r\ninto a blue-tinged profundity. And then our guide was pulling at my\r\narm.\r\n\r\nThen he left me, and walked to the end of that plank and stepped upon\r\nit, looking back. Then when he perceived we watched him, he turned\r\nabout and went on along it, walking as surely as though he was on firm\r\nearth. For a moment his form was distinct, then he became a blue blur,\r\nand then vanished into the obscurity. I became aware of some vague\r\nshape looming darkly out of the black.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. “Surely!—” said Cavor.\r\n\r\nOne of the other Selenites walked a few paces out upon the plank, and\r\nturned and looked back at us unconcernedly. The others stood ready to\r\nfollow after us. Our guide’s expectant figure reappeared. He was\r\nreturning to see why we had not advanced.\r\n\r\n“What is that beyond there?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“I can’t see.”\r\n\r\n“We can’t cross this at any price,” said I.\r\n\r\n“I could not go three steps on it,” said Cavor, “even with my hands\r\nfree.”\r\n\r\nWe looked at each other’s drawn faces in blank consternation.\r\n\r\n“They can’t know what it is to be giddy!” said Cavor.\r\n\r\n“It’s quite impossible for us to walk that plank.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe they see as we do. I’ve been watching them. I wonder\r\nif they know this is simply blackness for us. How can we make them\r\nunderstand?”\r\n\r\n“Anyhow, we must make them understand.”\r\n\r\nI think we said these things with a vague half hope the Selenites might\r\nsomehow understand. I knew quite clearly that all that was needed was\r\nan explanation. Then as I saw their faces, I realised that an\r\nexplanation was impossible. Just here it was that our resemblances were\r\nnot going to bridge our differences. Well, I wasn’t going to walk the\r\nplank, anyhow. I slipped my wrist very quickly out of the coil of chain\r\nthat was loose, and then began to twist my wrists in opposite\r\ndirections. I was standing nearest to the bridge, and as I did this two\r\nof the Selenites laid hold of me, and pulled me gently towards it.\r\n\r\nI shook my head violently. “No go,” I said, “no use. You don’t\r\nunderstand.”\r\n\r\nAnother Selenite added his compulsion. I was forced to step forward.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got an idea,” said Cavor; but I knew his ideas.\r\n\r\n“Look here!” I exclaimed to the Selenites. “Steady on! It’s all very\r\nwell for you—”\r\n\r\nI sprang round upon my heel. I burst out into curses. For one of the\r\narmed Selenites had stabbed me behind with his goad.\r\n\r\nI wrenched my wrists free from the little tentacles that held them. I\r\nturned on the goad-bearer. “Confound you!” I cried. “I’ve warned you of\r\nthat. What on earth do you think I’m made of, to stick that into me? If\r\nyou touch me again—”\r\n\r\nBy way of answer he pricked me forthwith.\r\n\r\nI heard Cavor’s voice in alarm and entreaty. Even then I think he\r\nwanted to compromise with these creatures. “I say, Bedford,” he cried,\r\n“I know a way!” But the sting of that second stab seemed to set free\r\nsome pent-up reserve of energy in my being. Instantly the link of the\r\nwrist-chain snapped, and with it snapped all considerations that had\r\nheld us unresisting in the hands of these moon creatures. For that\r\nsecond, at least, I was mad with fear and anger. I took no thought of\r\nconsequences. I hit straight out at the face of the thing with the\r\ngoad. The chain was twisted round my fist.\r\n\r\nThere came another of these beastly surprises of which the moon world\r\nis full.\r\n\r\nMy mailed hand seemed to go clean through him. He smashed like—like\r\nsome softish sort of sweet with liquid in it! He broke right in! He\r\nsquelched and splashed. It was like hitting a damp toadstool. The\r\nflimsy body went spinning a dozen yards, and fell with a flabby impact.\r\nI was astonished. I was incredulous that any living thing could be so\r\nflimsy. For an instant I could have believed the whole thing a dream.\r\n\r\nThen it had become real and imminent again. Neither Cavor nor the other\r\nSelenites seemed to have done anything from the time when I had turned\r\nabout to the time when the dead Selenite hit the ground. Every one\r\nstood back from us two, every one alert. That arrest seemed to last at\r\nleast a second after the Selenite was down. Every one must have been\r\ntaking the thing in. I seem to remember myself standing with my arm\r\nhalf retracted, trying also to take it in. “What next?” clamoured my\r\nbrain; “what next?” Then in a moment every one was moving!\r\n\r\nI perceived we must get our chains loose, and that before we could do\r\nthis these Selenites had to be beaten off. I faced towards the group of\r\nthe three goad-bearers. Instantly one threw his goad at me. It swished\r\nover my head, and I suppose went flying into the abyss behind.\r\n\r\nI leaped right at him with all my might as the goad flew over me. He\r\nturned to run as I jumped, and I bore him to the ground, came down\r\nright upon him, and slipped upon his smashed body and fell. He seemed\r\nto wriggle under my foot.\r\n\r\nI came into a sitting position, and on every hand the blue backs of the\r\nSelenites were receding into the darkness. I bent a link by main force\r\nand untwisted the chain that had hampered me about the ankles, and\r\nsprang to my feet, with the chain in my hand. Another goad, flung\r\njavelin-wise, whistled by me, and I made a rush towards the darkness\r\nout of which it had come. Then I turned back towards Cavor, who was\r\nstill standing in the light of the rivulet near the gulf convulsively\r\nbusy with his wrists, and at the same time jabbering nonsense about his\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n“Come on!” I cried.\r\n\r\n“My hands!” he answered.\r\n\r\nThen, realising that I dared not run back to him, because my\r\nill-calculated steps might carry me over the edge, he came shuffling\r\ntowards me, with his hands held out before him.\r\n\r\nI gripped his chains at once to unfasten them.\r\n\r\n“Where are they?” he panted.\r\n\r\n“Run away. They’ll come back. They’re throwing things! Which way shall\r\nwe go?”\r\n\r\n“By the light. To that tunnel. Eh?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said I, and his hands were free.\r\n\r\nI dropped on my knees and fell to work on his ankle bonds. Whack came\r\nsomething—I know not what—and splashed the livid streamlet into drops\r\nabout us. Far away on our right a piping and whistling began.\r\n\r\nI whipped the chain off his feet, and put it in his hand. “Hit with\r\nthat!” I said, and without waiting for an answer, set off in big bounds\r\nalong the path by which we had come. I had a nasty sort of feeling that\r\nthese things could jump out of the darkness on to my back. I heard the\r\nimpact of his leaps come following after me.\r\n\r\nWe ran in vast strides. But that running, you must understand, was an\r\naltogether different thing from any running on earth. On earth one\r\nleaps and almost instantly hits the ground again, but on the moon,\r\nbecause of its weaker pull, one shot through the air for several\r\nseconds before one came to earth. In spite of our violent hurry this\r\ngave an effect of long pauses, pauses in which one might have counted\r\nseven or eight. “Step,” and one soared off! All sorts of questions ran\r\nthrough my mind: “Where are the Selenites? What will they do? Shall we\r\never get to that tunnel? Is Cavor far behind? Are they likely to cut\r\nhim off?” Then whack, stride, and off again for another step.\r\n\r\nI saw a Selenite running in front of me, his legs going exactly as a\r\nman’s would go on earth, saw him glance over his shoulder, and heard\r\nhim shriek as he ran aside out of my way into the darkness. He was, I\r\nthink, our guide, but I am not sure. Then in another vast stride the\r\nwalls of rock had come into view on either hand, and in two more\r\nstrides I was in the tunnel, and tempering my pace to its low roof. I\r\nwent on to a bend, then stopped and turned back, and plug, plug, plug,\r\nCavor came into view, splashing into the stream of blue light at every\r\nstride, and grew larger and blundered into me. We stood clutching each\r\nother. For a moment, at least, we had shaken off our captors and were\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nWe were both very much out of breath. We spoke in panting, broken\r\nsentences.\r\n\r\n“You’ve spoilt it all!” panted Cavor. “Nonsense,” I cried. “It was that\r\nor death!”\r\n\r\n“What are we to do?”\r\n\r\n“Hide.”\r\n\r\n“How can we?”\r\n\r\n“It’s dark enough.”\r\n\r\n“But where?”\r\n\r\n“Up one of these side caverns.”\r\n\r\n“And then?”\r\n\r\n“Think.”\r\n\r\n“Right—come on.”\r\n\r\nWe strode on, and presently came to a radiating dark cavern. Cavor was\r\nin front. He hesitated, and chose a black mouth that seemed to promise\r\ngood hiding. He went towards it and turned.\r\n\r\n“It’s dark,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Your legs and feet will light us. You’re wet with that luminous\r\nstuff.”\r\n\r\n“But—”\r\n\r\nA tumult of sounds, and in particular a sound like a clanging gong,\r\nadvancing up the main tunnel, became audible. It was horribly\r\nsuggestive of a tumultuous pursuit. We made a bolt for the unlit side\r\ncavern forthwith. As we ran along it our way was lit by the irradiation\r\nof Cavor’s legs. “It’s lucky,” I panted, “they took off our boots, or\r\nwe should fill this place with clatter.” On we rushed, taking as small\r\nsteps as we could to avoid striking the roof of the cavern. After a\r\ntime we seemed to be gaining on the uproar. It became muffled, it\r\ndwindled, it died away.\r\n\r\nI stopped and looked back, and I heard the pad, pad of Cavor’s feet\r\nreceding. Then he stopped also. “Bedford,” he whispered; “there’s a\r\nsort of light in front of us.”\r\n\r\nI looked, and at first could see nothing. Then I perceived his head and\r\nshoulders dimly outlined against a fainter darkness. I saw, also, that\r\nthis mitigation of the darkness was not blue, as all the other light\r\nwithin the moon had been, but a pallid grey, a very vague, faint white,\r\nthe daylight colour. Cavor noted this difference as soon, or sooner,\r\nthan I did, and I think, too, that it filled him with much the same\r\nwild hope.\r\n\r\n“Bedford,” he whispered, and his voice trembled. “That light—it is\r\npossible—”\r\n\r\nHe did not dare to say the thing he hoped. Then came a pause. Suddenly\r\nI knew by the sound of his feet that he was striding towards that\r\npallor. I followed him with a beating heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\nPoints of View\r\n\r\n\r\nThe light grew stronger as we advanced. In a little time it was nearly\r\nas strong as the phosphorescence on Cavor’s legs. Our tunnel was\r\nexpanding into a cavern, and this new light was at the farther end of\r\nit. I perceived something that set my hopes leaping and bounding.\r\n\r\n“Cavor,” I said, “it comes from above! I am certain it comes from\r\nabove!”\r\n\r\nHe made no answer, but hurried on.\r\n\r\nIndisputably it was a grey light, a silvery light.\r\n\r\nIn another moment we were beneath it. It filtered down through a chink\r\nin the walls of the cavern, and as I stared up, drip, came a drop of\r\nwater upon my face. I started and stood aside—drip, fell another drop\r\nquite audibly on the rocky floor.\r\n\r\n“Cavor,” I said, “if one of us lifts the other, he can reach that\r\ncrack!”\r\n\r\n“I’ll lift you,” he said, and incontinently hoisted me as though I was\r\na baby.\r\n\r\nI thrust an arm into the crack, and just at my finger tips found a\r\nlittle ledge by which I could hold. I could see the white light was\r\nvery much brighter now. I pulled myself up by two fingers with scarcely\r\nan effort, though on earth I weigh twelve stone, reached to a still\r\nhigher corner of rock, and so got my feet on the narrow ledge. I stood\r\nup and searched up the rocks with my fingers; the cleft broadened out\r\nupwardly. “It’s climbable,” I said to Cavor. “Can you jump up to my\r\nhand if I hold it down to you?”\r\n\r\nI wedged myself between the sides of the cleft, rested knee and foot on\r\nthe ledge, and extended a hand. I could not see Cavor, but I could hear\r\nthe rustle of his movements as he crouched to spring. Then whack and he\r\nwas hanging to my arm—and no heavier than a kitten! I lugged him up\r\nuntil he had a hand on my ledge, and could release me.\r\n\r\n“Confound it!” I said, “any one could be a mountaineer on the moon;”\r\nand so set myself in earnest to the climbing. For a few minutes I\r\nclambered steadily, and then I looked up again. The cleft opened out\r\nsteadily, and the light was brighter. Only—\r\n\r\nIt was not daylight after all.\r\n\r\nIn another moment I could see what it was, and at the sight I could\r\nhave beaten my head against the rocks with disappointment. For I beheld\r\nsimply an irregularly sloping open space, and all over its slanting\r\nfloor stood a forest of little club-shaped fungi, each shining\r\ngloriously with that pinkish silvery light. For a moment I stared at\r\ntheir soft radiance, then sprang forward and upward among them. I\r\nplucked up half a dozen and flung them against the rocks, and then sat\r\ndown, laughing bitterly, as Cavor’s ruddy face came into view.\r\n\r\n“It’s phosphorescence again!” I said. “No need to hurry. Sit down and\r\nmake yourself at home.” And as he spluttered over our disappointment, I\r\nbegan to lob more of these growths into the cleft.\r\n\r\n“I thought it was daylight,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Daylight!” cried I. “Daybreak, sunset, clouds, and windy skies! Shall\r\nwe ever see such things again?”\r\n\r\nAs I spoke, a little picture of our world seemed to rise before me,\r\nbright and little and clear, like the background of some old Italian\r\npicture. “The sky that changes, and the sea that changes, and the hills\r\nand the green trees and the towns and cities shining in the sun. Think\r\nof a wet roof at sunset, Cavor! Think of the windows of a westward\r\nhouse!” He made no answer.\r\n\r\n“Here we are burrowing in this beastly world that isn’t a world, with\r\nits inky ocean hidden in some abominable blackness below, and outside\r\nthat torrid day and that death stillness of night. And all these things\r\nthat are chasing us now, beastly men of leather—insect men, that come\r\nout of a nightmare! After all, they’re right! What business have we\r\nhere smashing them and disturbing their world! For all we know the\r\nwhole planet is up and after us already. In a minute we may hear them\r\nwhimpering, and their gongs going. What are we to do? Where are we to\r\ngo? Here we are as comfortable as snakes from Jamrach’s loose in a\r\nSurbiton villa!”\r\n\r\n“It was your fault,” said Cavor.\r\n\r\n“My fault!” I shouted. “Good Lord!”\r\n\r\n“I had an idea!”\r\n\r\n“Curse your ideas!”\r\n\r\n“If we had refused to budge—”\r\n\r\n“Under those goads?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. They would have carried us!”\r\n\r\n“Over that bridge?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. They must have carried us from outside.”\r\n\r\n“I’d rather be carried by a fly across a ceiling.”\r\n\r\n“Good Heavens!”\r\n\r\nI resumed my destruction of the fungi. Then suddenly I saw something\r\nthat struck me even then. “Cavor,” I said, “these chains are of gold!”\r\n\r\nHe was thinking intently, with his hands gripping his cheeks. He turned\r\nhis head slowly and stared at me, and when I had repeated my words, at\r\nthe twisted chain about his right hand. “So they are,” he said, “so\r\nthey are.” His face lost its transitory interest even as he looked. He\r\nhesitated for a moment, then went on with his interrupted meditation. I\r\nsat for a space puzzling over the fact that I had only just observed\r\nthis, until I considered the blue light in which we had been, and which\r\nhad taken all the colour out of the metal. And from that discovery I\r\nalso started upon a train of thought that carried me wide and far. I\r\nforgot that I had just been asking what business we had in the moon.\r\nGold....\r\n\r\nIt was Cavor who spoke first. “It seems to me that there are two\r\ncourses open to us.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Either we can attempt to make our way—fight our way if necessary—out\r\nto the exterior again, and then hunt for our sphere until we find it,\r\nor the cold of the night comes to kill us, or else—”\r\n\r\nHe paused. “Yes?” I said, though I knew what was coming.\r\n\r\n“We might attempt once more to establish some sort of understanding\r\nwith the minds of the people in the moon.”\r\n\r\n“So far as I’m concerned—it’s the first.”\r\n\r\n“I doubt.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t.”\r\n\r\n“You see,” said Cavor, “I do not think we can judge the Selenites by\r\nwhat we have seen of them. Their central world, their civilised world\r\nwill be far below in the profounder caverns about their sea. This\r\nregion of the crust in which we are is an outlying district, a pastoral\r\nregion. At any rate, that is my interpretation. These Selenites we have\r\nseen may be only the equivalent of cowboys and engine-tenders. Their\r\nuse of goads—in all probability mooncalf goads—the lack of imagination\r\nthey show in expecting us to be able to do just what they can do, their\r\nindisputable brutality, all seem to point to something of that sort.\r\nBut if we endured—”\r\n\r\n“Neither of us could endure a six-inch plank across the bottomless pit\r\nfor very long.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Cavor; “but then—”\r\n\r\n“I _won’t_,” I said.\r\n\r\nHe discovered a new line of possibilities. “Well, suppose we got\r\nourselves into some corner, where we could defend ourselves against\r\nthese hinds and labourers. If, for example, we could hold out for a\r\nweek or so, it is probable that the news of our appearance would filter\r\ndown to the more intelligent and populous parts—”\r\n\r\n“If they exist.”\r\n\r\n“They must exist, or whence came those tremendous machines?”\r\n\r\n“That’s possible, but it’s the worst of the two chances.”\r\n\r\n“We might write up inscriptions on walls—”\r\n\r\n“How do we know their eyes would see the sort of marks we made?”\r\n\r\n“If we cut them—”\r\n\r\n“That’s possible, of course.”\r\n\r\nI took up a new thread of thought. “After all,” I said, “I suppose you\r\ndon’t think these Selenites so infinitely wiser than men.”\r\n\r\n“They must know a lot more—or at least a lot of different things.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but—” I hesitated.\r\n\r\n“I think you’ll quite admit, Cavor, that you’re rather an exceptional\r\nman.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“Well, you—you’re a rather lonely man—have been, that is. You haven’t\r\nmarried.”\r\n\r\n“Never wanted to. But why—”\r\n\r\n“And you never grew richer than you happened to be?”\r\n\r\n“Never wanted that either.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve just rooted after knowledge?”\r\n\r\n“Well, a certain curiosity is natural—”\r\n\r\n“You think so. That’s just it. You think every other mind wants to\r\n_know_. I remember once, when I asked you why you conducted all these\r\nresearches, you said you wanted your F.R.S., and to have the stuff\r\ncalled Cavorite, and things like that. You know perfectly well you\r\ndidn’t do it for that; but at the time my question took you by\r\nsurprise, and you felt you ought to have something to look like a\r\nmotive. Really you conducted researches because you _had_ to. It’s your\r\ntwist.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it is—”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t one man in a million has that twist. Most men want—well,\r\nvarious things, but very few want knowledge for its own sake. _I_\r\ndon’t, I know perfectly well. Now, these Selenites seem to be a\r\ndriving, busy sort of being, but how do you know that even the most\r\nintelligent will take an interest in us or our world? I don’t believe\r\nthey’ll even know we have a world. They never come out at night—they’d\r\nfreeze if they did. They’ve probably never seen any heavenly body at\r\nall except the blazing sun. How are they to know there is another\r\nworld? What does it matter to them if they do? Well, even if they\r\n_have_ had a glimpse of a few stars, or even of the earth crescent,\r\nwhat of that? Why should people living _inside_ a planet trouble to\r\nobserve that sort of thing? Men wouldn’t have done it except for the\r\nseasons and sailing; why should the moon people?...\r\n\r\n“Well, suppose there are a few philosophers like yourself. They are\r\njust the very Selenites who’ll never have heard of our existence.\r\nSuppose a Selenite had dropped on the earth when you were at Lympne,\r\nyou’d have been the last man in the world to hear he had come. You\r\nnever read a newspaper! You see the chances against you. Well, it’s for\r\nthese chances we’re sitting here doing nothing while precious time is\r\nflying. I tell you we’ve got into a fix. We’ve come unarmed, we’ve lost\r\nour sphere, we’ve got no food, we’ve shown ourselves to the Selenites,\r\nand made them think we’re strange, strong, dangerous animals; and\r\nunless these Selenites are perfect fools, they’ll set about now and\r\nhunt us till they find us, and when they find us they’ll try to take us\r\nif they can, and kill us if they can’t, and that’s the end of the\r\nmatter. If they take us, they’ll probably kill us, through some\r\nmisunderstanding. After we’re done for, they may discuss us perhaps,\r\nbut we shan’t get much fun out of that.”\r\n\r\n“Go on.”\r\n\r\n“On the other hand, here’s gold knocking about like cast iron at home.\r\nIf only we can get some of it back, if only we can find our sphere\r\nagain before they do, and get back, then—”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“We might put the thing on a sounder footing. Come back in a bigger\r\nsphere with guns.”\r\n\r\n“Good Lord!” cried Cavor, as though that was horrible.\r\n\r\nI shied another luminous fungus down the cleft.\r\n\r\n“Look here, Cavor,” I said, “I’ve half the voting power anyhow in this\r\naffair, and this is a case for a practical man. I’m a practical man,\r\nand you are not. I’m not going to trust to Selenites and geometrical\r\ndiagrams if I can help it. That’s all. Get back. Drop all this\r\nsecrecy—or most of it. And come again.”\r\n\r\nHe reflected. “When I came to the moon,” he said, “I ought to have come\r\nalone.”\r\n\r\n“The question before the meeting,” I said, “is how to get back to the\r\nsphere.”\r\n\r\nFor a time we nursed our knees in silence. Then he seemed to decide for\r\nmy reasons.\r\n\r\n“I think,” he said, “one can get data. It is clear that while the sun\r\nis on this side of the moon the air will be blowing through this planet\r\nsponge from the dark side hither. On this side, at any rate, the air\r\nwill be expanding and flowing out of the moon caverns into the\r\ncraters.... Very well, there’s a draught here.”\r\n\r\n“So there is.”\r\n\r\n“And that means that this is not a dead end; somewhere behind us this\r\ncleft goes on and up. The draught is blowing up, and that is the way we\r\nhave to go. If we try to get up any sort of chimney or gully there is,\r\nwe shall not only get out of these passages where they are hunting for\r\nus—”\r\n\r\n“But suppose the gully is too narrow?”\r\n\r\n“We’ll come down again.”\r\n\r\n“Ssh!” I said suddenly; “what’s that?”\r\n\r\nWe listened. At first it was an indistinct murmur, and then one picked\r\nout the clang of a gong. “They must think we are mooncalves,” said I,\r\n“to be frightened at that.”\r\n\r\n“They’re coming along that passage,” said Cavor.\r\n\r\n“They must be.”\r\n\r\n“They’ll not think of the cleft. They’ll go past.”\r\n\r\nI listened again for a space. “This time,” I whispered, “they’re likely\r\nto have some sort of weapon.”\r\n\r\nThen suddenly I sprang to my feet. “Good heavens, Cavor!” I cried. “But\r\nthey _will!_ They’ll see the fungi I have been pitching down. They’ll—”\r\n\r\nI didn’t finish my sentence. I turned about and made a leap over the\r\nfungus tops towards the upper end of the cavity. I saw that the space\r\nturned upward and became a draughty cleft again, ascending to\r\nimpenetrable darkness. I was about to clamber up into this, and then\r\nwith a happy inspiration turned back.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing?” asked Cavor.\r\n\r\n“Go on!” said I, and went back and got two of the shining fungi, and\r\nputting one into the breast pocket of my flannel jacket, so that it\r\nstuck out to light our climbing, went back with the other for Cavor.\r\nThe noise of the Selenites was now so loud that it seemed they must be\r\nalready beneath the cleft. But it might be they would have difficulty\r\nin clambering in to it, or might hesitate to ascend it against our\r\npossible resistance. At any rate, we had now the comforting knowledge\r\nof the enormous muscular superiority our birth in another planet gave\r\nus. In other minute I was clambering with gigantic vigour after Cavor’s\r\nblue-lit heels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\nThe Fight in the Cave of the Moon Butchers\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not know how far we clambered before we came to the grating. It\r\nmay be we ascended only a few hundred feet, but at the time it seemed\r\nto me we might have hauled and jammed and hopped and wedged ourselves\r\nthrough a mile or more of vertical ascent. Whenever I recall that time,\r\nthere comes into my head the heavy clank of our golden chains that\r\nfollowed every movement. Very soon my knuckles and knees were raw, and\r\nI had a bruise on one cheek. After a time the first violence of our\r\nefforts diminished, and our movements became more deliberate and less\r\npainful. The noise of the pursuing Selenites had died away altogether.\r\nIt seemed almost as though they had not traced us up the crack after\r\nall, in spite of the tell-tale heap of broken fungi that must have lain\r\nbeneath it. At times the cleft narrowed so much that we could scarce\r\nsqueeze up it; at others it expanded into great drusy cavities, studded\r\nwith prickly crystals or thickly beset with dull, shining fungoid\r\npimples. Sometimes it twisted spirally, and at other times slanted down\r\nnearly to the horizontal direction. Ever and again there was the\r\nintermittent drip and trickle of water by us. Once or twice it seemed\r\nto us that small living things had rustled out of our reach, but what\r\nthey were we never saw. They may have been venomous beasts for all I\r\nknow, but they did us no harm, and we were now tuned to a pitch when a\r\nweird creeping thing more or less mattered little. And at last, far\r\nabove, came the familiar bluish light again, and then we saw that it\r\nfiltered through a grating that barred our way.\r\n\r\nWe whispered as we pointed this out to one another, and became more and\r\nmore cautious in our ascent. Presently we were close under the grating,\r\nand by pressing my face against its bars I could see a limited portion\r\nof the cavern beyond. It was clearly a large space, and lit no doubt by\r\nsome rivulet of the same blue light that we had seen flow from the\r\nbeating machinery. An intermittent trickle of water dropped ever and\r\nagain between the bars near my face.\r\n\r\nMy first endeavour was naturally to see what might be upon the floor of\r\nthe cavern, but our grating lay in a depression whose rim hid all this\r\nfrom our eyes. Our foiled attention then fell back upon the suggestion\r\nof the various sounds we heard, and presently my eye caught a number of\r\nfaint shadows that played across the dim roof far overhead.\r\n\r\nIndisputably there were several Selenites, perhaps a considerable\r\nnumber, in this space, for we could hear the noises of their\r\nintercourse, and faint sounds that I identified as their footfalls.\r\nThere was also a succession of regularly repeated sounds—chid, chid,\r\nchid—which began and ceased, suggestive of a knife or spade hacking at\r\nsome soft substance. Then came a clank as if of chains, a whistle and a\r\nrumble as of a truck running over a hollowed place, and then again that\r\nchid, chid, chid resumed. The shadows told of shapes that moved quickly\r\nand rhythmically, in agreement with that regular sound, and rested when\r\nit ceased.\r\n\r\nWe put our heads close together, and began to discuss these things in\r\nnoiseless whispers.\r\n\r\n“They are occupied,” I said, “they are occupied in some way.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“They’re not seeking us, or thinking of us.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps they have not heard of us.”\r\n\r\n“Those others are hunting about below. If suddenly we appeared here—”\r\n\r\nWe looked at one another.\r\n\r\n“There might be a chance to parley,” said Cavor.\r\n\r\n“No,” I said. “Not as we are.”\r\n\r\nFor a space we remained, each occupied by his own thoughts.\r\n\r\nChid, chid, chid went the chipping, and the shadows moved to and fro.\r\n\r\nI looked at the grating. “It’s flimsy,” I said. “We might bend two of\r\nthe bars and crawl through.”\r\n\r\nWe wasted a little time in vague discussion. Then I took one of the\r\nbars in both hands, and got my feet up against the rock until they were\r\nalmost on a level with my head, and so thrust against the bar. It bent\r\nso suddenly that I almost slipped. I clambered about and bent the\r\nadjacent bar in the opposite direction, and then took the luminous\r\nfungus from my pocket and dropped it down the fissure.\r\n\r\n“Don’t do anything hastily,” whispered Cavor, as I twisted myself up\r\nthrough the opening I had enlarged. I had a glimpse of busy figures as\r\nI came through the grating, and immediately bent down, so that the rim\r\nof the depression in which the grating lay hid me from their eyes, and\r\nso lay flat, signalling advice to Cavor as he also prepared to come\r\nthrough. Presently we were side by side in the depression, peering over\r\nthe edge at the cavern and its occupants.\r\n\r\nIt was a much larger cavern than we had supposed from our first glimpse\r\nof it, and we looked up from the lowest portion of its sloping floor.\r\nIt widened out as it receded from us, and its roof came down and hid\r\nthe remoter portion altogether. And lying in a line along its length,\r\nvanishing at last far away in that tremendous perspective, were a\r\nnumber of huge shapes, huge pallid hulls, upon which the Selenites were\r\nbusy. At first they seemed big white cylinders of vague import. Then I\r\nnoted the heads upon them lying towards us, eyeless and skinless like\r\nthe heads of sheep at a butcher’s, and perceived they were the\r\ncarcasses of mooncalves being cut up, much as the crew of a whaler\r\nmight cut up a moored whale. They were cutting off the flesh in strips,\r\nand on some of the farther trunks the white ribs were showing. It was\r\nthe sound of their hatchets that made that chid, chid, chid. Some way\r\naway a thing like a trolley cable, drawn and loaded with chunks of lax\r\nmeat, was running up the slope of the cavern floor. This enormous long\r\navenue of hulls that were destined to be food gave us a sense of the\r\nvast populousness of the moon world second only to the effect of our\r\nfirst glimpse down the shaft.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me at first that the Selenites must be standing on\r\ntrestle-supported planks,[2] and then I saw that the planks and\r\nsupports and the hatchets were really of the same leaden hue as my\r\nfetters had seemed before white light came to bear on them. A number of\r\nvery thick-looking crowbars lay about the floor, and had apparently\r\nassisted to turn the dead mooncalf over on its side. They were perhaps\r\nsix feet long, with shaped handles, very tempting-looking weapons. The\r\nwhole place was lit by three transverse streams of the blue fluid.\r\n\r\n [2] I do not remember seeing any wooden things on the moon; doors,\r\n tables, everything corresponding to our terrestrial joinery was made\r\n of metal, and I believe for the most part of gold, which as a metal\r\n would, of course, naturally recommend itself—other things being\r\n equal—on account of the ease in working it, and its toughness and\r\n durability.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe lay for a long time noting all these things in silence. “Well?” said\r\nCavor at last.\r\n\r\nI crouched over and turned to him. I had come upon a brilliant idea.\r\n“Unless they lowered those bodies by a crane,” I said, “we must be\r\nnearer the surface than I thought.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“The mooncalf doesn’t hop, and it hasn’t got wings.”\r\n\r\nHe peered over the edge of the hollow again. “I wonder now—” he began.\r\n“After all, we have never gone far from the surface—”\r\n\r\nI stopped him by a grip on his arm. I had heard a noise from the cleft\r\nbelow us!\r\n\r\nWe twisted ourselves about, and lay as still as death, with every sense\r\nalert. In a little while I did not doubt that something was quietly\r\nascending the cleft. Very slowly and quite noiselessly I assured myself\r\nof a good grip on my chain, and waited for that something to appear.\r\n\r\n“Just look at those chaps with the hatchets again,” I said.\r\n\r\n“They’re all right,” said Cavor.\r\n\r\nI took a sort of provisional aim at the gap in the grating. I could\r\nhear now quite distinctly the soft twittering of the ascending\r\nSelenites, the dab of their hands against the rock, and the falling of\r\ndust from their grips as they clambered.\r\n\r\nThen I could see that there was something moving dimly in the blackness\r\nbelow the grating, but what it might be I could not distinguish. The\r\nwhole thing seemed to hang fire just for a moment—then smash! I had\r\nsprung to my feet, struck savagely at something that had flashed out at\r\nme. It was the keen point of a spear. I have thought since that its\r\nlength in the narrowness of the cleft must have prevented its being\r\nsloped to reach me. Anyhow, it shot out from the grating like the\r\ntongue of a snake, and missed and flew back and flashed again. But the\r\nsecond time I snatched and caught it, and wrenched it away, but not\r\nbefore another had darted ineffectually at me.\r\n\r\nI shouted with triumph as I felt the hold of the Selenite resist my\r\npull for a moment and give, and then I was jabbing down through the\r\nbars, amidst squeals from the darkness, and Cavor had snapped off the\r\nother spear, and was leaping and flourishing it beside me, and making\r\ninefficient jabs. Clang, clang, came up through the grating, and then\r\nan axe hurtled through the air and whacked against the rocks beyond, to\r\nremind me of the fleshers at the carcasses up the cavern.\r\n\r\nI turned, and they were all coming towards us in open order waving\r\ntheir axes. They were short, thick, little beggars, with long arms,\r\nstrikingly different from the ones we had seen before. If they had not\r\nheard of us before, they must have realised the situation with\r\nincredible swiftness. I stared at them for a moment, spear in hand.\r\n“Guard that grating, Cavor,” I cried, howled to intimidate them, and\r\nrushed to meet them. Two of them missed with their hatchets, and the\r\nrest fled incontinently. Then the two also were sprinting away up the\r\ncavern, with hands clenched and heads down. I never saw men run like\r\nthem!\r\n\r\nI knew the spear I had was no good for me. It was thin and flimsy, only\r\neffectual for a thrust, and too long for a quick recover. So I only\r\nchased the Selenites as far as the first carcass, and stopped there and\r\npicked up one of the crowbars that were lying about. It felt\r\ncomfortingly heavy, and equal to smashing any number of Selenites. I\r\nthrew away my spear, and picked up a second crowbar for the other hand.\r\nI felt five times better than I had with the spear. I shook the two\r\nthreateningly at the Selenites, who had come to a halt in a little\r\ncrowd far away up the cavern, and then turned about to look at Cavor.\r\n\r\nHe was leaping from side to side of the grating, making threatening\r\njabs with his broken spear. That was all right. It would keep the\r\nSelenites down—for a time at any rate. I looked up the cavern again.\r\nWhat on earth were we going to do now?\r\n\r\nWe were cornered in a sort of way already. But these butchers up the\r\ncavern had been surprised, they were probably scared, and they had no\r\nspecial weapons, only those little hatchets of theirs. And that way lay\r\nescape. Their sturdy little forms—ever so much shorter and thicker than\r\nthe mooncalf herds—were scattered up the slope in a way that was\r\neloquent of indecision. I had the moral advantage of a mad bull in a\r\nstreet. But for all that, there seemed a tremendous crowd of them. Very\r\nprobably there was. Those Selenites down the cleft had certainly some\r\ninfernally long spears. It might be they had other surprises for us....\r\nBut, confound it! if we charged up the cave we should let them up\r\nbehind us, and if we didn’t those little brutes up the cave would\r\nprobably get reinforced. Heaven alone knew what tremendous engines of\r\nwarfare—guns, bombs, terrestrial torpedoes—this unknown world below our\r\nfeet, this vaster world of which we had only pricked the outer cuticle,\r\nmight not presently send up to our destruction. It became clear the\r\nonly thing to do was to charge! It became clearer as the legs of a\r\nnumber of fresh Selenites appeared running down the cavern towards us.\r\n\r\n“Bedford!” cried Cavor, and behold! he was halfway between me and the\r\ngrating.\r\n\r\n“Go back!” I cried. “What are you doing—”\r\n\r\n“They’ve got—it’s like a gun!”\r\n\r\nAnd struggling in the grating between those defensive spears appeared\r\nthe head and shoulders of a singularly lean and angular Selenite,\r\nbearing some complicated apparatus.\r\n\r\nI realised Cavor’s utter incapacity for the fight we had in hand. For a\r\nmoment I hesitated. Then I rushed past him whirling my crowbars, and\r\nshouting to confound the aim of the Selenite. He was aiming in the\r\nqueerest way with the thing against his stomach. “_Chuzz!_” The thing\r\nwasn’t a gun; it went off like a cross-bow more, and dropped me in the\r\nmiddle of a leap.\r\n\r\nI didn’t fall down, I simply came down a little shorter than I should\r\nhave done if I hadn’t been hit, and from the feel of my shoulder the\r\nthing might have tapped me and glanced off. Then my left hand hit\r\nagainst the shaft, and I perceived there was a sort of spear sticking\r\nhalf through my shoulder. The moment after I got home with the crowbar\r\nin my right hand, and hit the Selenite fair and square. He collapsed—he\r\ncrushed and crumpled—his head smashed like an egg.\r\n\r\nI dropped a crowbar, pulled the spear out of my shoulder, and began to\r\njab it down the grating into the darkness. At each jab came a shriek\r\nand twitter. Finally I hurled the spear down upon them with all my\r\nstrength, leapt up, picked up the crowbar again, and started for the\r\nmultitude up the cavern.\r\n\r\n“Bedford!” cried Cavor. “Bedford!” as I flew past him.\r\n\r\nI seem to remember his footsteps coming on behind me.\r\n\r\nStep, leap ... whack, step, leap.... Each leap seemed to last ages.\r\nWith each, the cave opened out and the number of Selenites visible\r\nincreased. At first they seemed all running about like ants in a\r\ndisturbed ant-hill, one or two waving hatchets and coming to meet me,\r\nmore running away, some bolting sideways into the avenue of carcasses,\r\nthen presently others came in sight carrying spears, and then others. I\r\nsaw a most extraordinary thing, all hands and feet, bolting for cover.\r\nThe cavern grew darker farther up.\r\n\r\nFlick! something flew over my head. Flick! As I soared in mid-stride I\r\nsaw a spear hit and quiver in one of the carcasses to my left. Then, as\r\nI came down, one hit the ground before me, and I heard the remote\r\nchuzz! with which their things were fired. Flick, flick! for a moment\r\nit was a shower. They were volleying!\r\n\r\nI stopped dead.\r\n\r\nI don’t think I thought clearly then. I seem to remember a kind of\r\nstereotyped phrase running through my mind: “Zone of fire, seek cover!”\r\nI know I made a dash for the space between two of the carcasses, and\r\nstood there panting and feeling very wicked.\r\n\r\nI looked round for Cavor, and for a moment it seemed as if he had\r\nvanished from the world. Then he came out of the darkness between the\r\nrow of the carcasses and the rocky wall of the cavern. I saw his little\r\nface, dark and blue, and shining with perspiration and emotion.\r\n\r\nHe was saying something, but what it was I did not heed. I had realised\r\nthat we might work from mooncalf to mooncalf up the cave until we were\r\nnear enough to charge home. It was charge or nothing. “Come on!” I\r\nsaid, and led the way.\r\n\r\n“Bedford!” he cried unavailingly.\r\n\r\nMy mind was busy as we went up that narrow alley between the dead\r\nbodies and the wall of the cavern. The rocks curved about—they could\r\nnot enfilade us. Though in that narrow space we could not leap, yet\r\nwith our earth-born strength we were still able to go very much faster\r\nthan the Selenites. I reckoned we should presently come right among\r\nthem. Once we were on them, they would be nearly as formidable as black\r\nbeetles. Only there would first of all be a volley. I thought of a\r\nstratagem. I whipped off my flannel jacket as I ran.\r\n\r\n“Bedford!” panted Cavor behind me.\r\n\r\nI glanced back. “What?” said I.\r\n\r\nHe was pointing upward over the carcasses. “White light!” he said.\r\n“White light again!”\r\n\r\nI looked, and it was even so; a faint white ghost of light in the\r\nremoter cavern roof. That seemed to give me double strength.\r\n\r\n“Keep close,” I said. A flat, long Selenite dashed out of the darkness,\r\nand squealed and fled. I halted, and stopped Cavor with my hand. I hung\r\nmy jacket over my crowbar, ducked round the next carcass, dropped\r\njacket and crowbar, showed myself, and darted back.\r\n\r\n“Chuzz-flick,” just one arrow came. We were close on the Selenites, and\r\nthey were standing in a crowd, broad, short, and tall together, with a\r\nlittle battery of their shooting implements pointing down the cave.\r\nThree or four other arrows followed the first, then their fire ceased.\r\n\r\nI stuck out my head, and escaped by a hair’s-breadth. This time I drew\r\na dozen shots or more, and heard the Selenites shouting and twittering\r\nas if with excitement as they shot. I picked up jacket and crowbar\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“_Now!_” said I, and thrust out the jacket.\r\n\r\n“Chuzz-zz-zz-zz! Chuzz!” In an instant my jacket had grown a thick\r\nbeard of arrows, and they were quivering all over the carcass behind\r\nus. Instantly I slipped the crowbar out of the jacket, dropped the\r\njacket—for all I know to the contrary it is lying up there in the moon\r\nnow—and rushed out upon them.\r\n\r\nFor a minute perhaps it was massacre. I was too fierce to discriminate,\r\nand the Selenites were probably too scared to fight. At any rate they\r\nmade no sort of fight against me. I saw scarlet, as the saying is. I\r\nremember I seemed to be wading among those leathery, thin things as a\r\nman wades through tall grass, mowing and hitting, first right, then\r\nleft; smash. Little drops of moisture flew about. I trod on things that\r\ncrushed and piped and went slippery. The crowd seemed to open and close\r\nand flow like water. They seemed to have no combined plan whatever.\r\nThere were spears flew about me, I was grazed over the ear by one. I\r\nwas stabbed once in the arm and once in the cheek, but I only found\r\nthat out afterwards, when the blood had had time to run and cool and\r\nfeel wet.\r\n\r\nWhat Cavor did I do not know. For a space it seemed that this fighting\r\nhad lasted for an age, and must needs go on for ever. Then suddenly it\r\nwas all over, and there was nothing to be seen but the backs of heads\r\nbobbing up and down as their owners ran in all directions.... I seemed\r\naltogether unhurt. I ran forward some paces, shouting, then turned\r\nabout. I was amazed.\r\n\r\nI had come right through them in vast flying strides, they were all\r\nbehind me, and running hither and thither to hide.\r\n\r\nI felt an enormous astonishment at the evaporation of the great fight\r\ninto which I had hurled myself, and not a little exultation. It did not\r\nseem to me that I had discovered the Selenites were unexpectedly\r\nflimsy, but that I was unexpectedly strong. I laughed stupidly. This\r\nfantastic moon!\r\n\r\nI glanced for a moment at the smashed and writhing bodies that were\r\nscattered over the cavern floor, with a vague idea of further violence,\r\nthen hurried on after Cavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\nIn the Sunlight\r\n\r\n\r\nPresently we saw that the cavern before us opened upon a hazy void. In\r\nanother moment we had emerged upon a sort of slanting gallery, that\r\nprojected into a vast circular space, a huge cylindrical pit running\r\nvertically up and down. Round this pit the slanting gallery ran without\r\nany parapet or protection for a turn and a half, and then plunged high\r\nabove into the rock again. Somehow it reminded me then of one of those\r\nspiral turns of the railway through the Saint Gothard. It was all\r\ntremendously huge. I can scarcely hope to convey to you the Titanic\r\nproportion of all that place, the Titanic effect of it. Our eyes\r\nfollowed up the vast declivity of the pit wall, and overhead and far\r\nabove we beheld a round opening set with faint stars, and half of the\r\nlip about it well nigh blinding with the white light of the sun. At\r\nthat we cried aloud simultaneously.\r\n\r\n“Come on!” I said, leading the way.\r\n\r\n“But there?” said Cavor, and very carefully stepped nearer the edge of\r\nthe gallery. I followed his example, and craned forward and looked\r\ndown, but I was dazzled by that gleam of light above, and I could see\r\nonly a bottomless darkness with spectral patches of crimson and purple\r\nfloating therein. Yet if I could not see, I could hear. Out of this\r\ndarkness came a sound, a sound like the angry hum one can hear if one\r\nputs one’s ear outside a hive of bees, a sound out of that enormous\r\nhollow, it may be, four miles beneath our feet...\r\n\r\nFor a moment I listened, then tightened my grip on my crowbar, and led\r\nthe way up the gallery.\r\n\r\n“This must be the shaft we looked down upon,” said Cavor. “Under that\r\nlid.”\r\n\r\n“And below there, is where we saw the lights.”\r\n\r\n“The lights!” said he. “Yes—the lights of the world that now we shall\r\nnever see.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll come back,” I said, for now we had escaped so much I was rashly\r\nsanguine that we should recover the sphere.\r\n\r\nHis answer I did not catch.\r\n\r\n“Eh?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t matter,” he answered, and we hurried on in silence.\r\n\r\nI suppose that slanting lateral way was four or five miles long,\r\nallowing for its curvature, and it ascended at a slope that would have\r\nmade it almost impossibly steep on earth, but which one strode up\r\neasily under lunar conditions. We saw only two Selenites during all\r\nthat portion of our flight, and directly they became aware of us they\r\nran headlong. It was clear that the knowledge of our strength and\r\nviolence had reached them. Our way to the exterior was unexpectedly\r\nplain. The spiral gallery straightened into a steeply ascendent tunnel,\r\nits floor bearing abundant traces of the mooncalves, and so straight\r\nand short in proportion to its vast arch, that no part of it was\r\nabsolutely dark. Almost immediately it began to lighten, and then far\r\noff and high up, and quite blindingly brilliant, appeared its opening\r\non the exterior, a slope of Alpine steepness surmounted by a crest of\r\nbayonet shrub, tall and broken down now, and dry and dead, in spiky\r\nsilhouette against the sun.\r\n\r\nAnd it is strange that we men, to whom this very vegetation had seemed\r\nso weird and horrible a little time ago, should now behold it with the\r\nemotion a home-coming exile might feel at sight of his native land. We\r\nwelcomed even the rareness of the air that made us pant as we ran, and\r\nwhich rendered speaking no longer the easy thing that it had been, but\r\nan effort to make oneself heard. Larger grew the sunlit circle above\r\nus, and larger, and all the nearer tunnel sank into a rim of\r\nindistinguishable black. We saw the dead bayonet shrub no longer with\r\nany touch of green in it, but brown and dry and thick, and the shadow\r\nof its upper branches high out of sight made a densely interlaced\r\npattern upon the tumbled rocks. And at the immediate mouth of the\r\ntunnel was a wide trampled space where the mooncalves had come and\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nWe came out upon this space at last into a light and heat that hit and\r\npressed upon us. We traversed the exposed area painfully, and clambered\r\nup a slope among the scrub stems, and sat down at last panting in a\r\nhigh place beneath the shadow of a mass of twisted lava. Even in the\r\nshade the rock felt hot.\r\n\r\nThe air was intensely hot, and we were in great physical discomfort,\r\nbut for all that we were no longer in a nightmare. We seemed to have\r\ncome to our own province again, beneath the stars. All the fear and\r\nstress of our flight through the dim passages and fissures below had\r\nfallen from us. That last fight had filled us with an enormous\r\nconfidence in ourselves so far as the Selenites were concerned. We\r\nlooked back almost incredulously at the black opening from which we had\r\njust emerged. Down there it was, in a blue glow that now in our\r\nmemories seemed the next thing to absolute darkness, we had met with\r\nthings like mad mockeries of men, helmet-headed creatures, and had\r\nwalked in fear before them, and had submitted to them until we could\r\nsubmit no longer. And behold, they had smashed like wax and scattered\r\nlike chaff, and fled and vanished like the creatures of a dream!\r\n\r\nI rubbed my eyes, doubting whether we had not slept and dreamt these\r\nthings by reason of the fungus we had eaten, and suddenly discovered\r\nthe blood upon my face, and then that my shirt was sticking painfully\r\nto my shoulder and arm.\r\n\r\n“Confound it!” I said, gauging my injuries with an investigatory hand,\r\nand suddenly that distant tunnel mouth became, as it were, a watching\r\neye.\r\n\r\n“Cavor!” I said; “what are they going to do now? And what are we going\r\nto do?”\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, with his eyes fixed upon the tunnel. “How can one\r\ntell what they will do?”\r\n\r\n“It depends on what they think of us, and I don’t see how we can begin\r\nto guess that. And it depends upon what they have in reserve. It’s as\r\nyou say, Cavor, we have touched the merest outside of this world. They\r\nmay have all sorts of things inside here. Even with those shooting\r\nthings they might make it bad for us....\r\n\r\n“Yet after all,” I said, “even if we _don’t_ find the sphere at once,\r\nthere is a chance for us. We might hold out. Even through the night. We\r\nmight go down there again and make a fight for it.”\r\n\r\nI stared about me with speculative eyes. The character of the scenery\r\nhad altered altogether by reason of the enormous growth and subsequent\r\ndrying of the scrub. The crest on which we sat was high, and commanded\r\na wide prospect of the crater landscape, and we saw it now all sere and\r\ndry in the late autumn of the lunar afternoon. Rising one behind the\r\nother were long slopes and fields of trampled brown where the\r\nmooncalves had pastured, and far away in the full blaze of the sun a\r\ndrove of them basked slumberously, scattered shapes, each with a blot\r\nof shadow against it like sheep on the side of a down. But never a sign\r\nof a Selenite was to be seen. Whether they had fled on our emergence\r\nfrom the interior passages, or whether they were accustomed to retire\r\nafter driving out the mooncalves, I cannot guess. At the time I\r\nbelieved the former was the case.\r\n\r\n“If we were to set fire to all this stuff,” I said, “we might find the\r\nsphere among the ashes.”\r\n\r\nCavor did not seem to hear me. He was peering under his hand at the\r\nstars, that still, in spite of the intense sunlight, were abundantly\r\nvisible in the sky. “How long do you think we’ve have been here?” he\r\nasked at last.\r\n\r\n“Been where?”\r\n\r\n“On the moon.”\r\n\r\n“Two earthly days, perhaps.”\r\n\r\n“More nearly ten. Do you know, the sun is past its zenith, and sinking\r\nin the west. In four days’ time or less it will be night.”\r\n\r\n“But—we’ve only eaten once!”\r\n\r\n“I know that. And— But there are the stars!”\r\n\r\n“But why should time seem different because we are on a smaller\r\nplanet?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. There it is!”\r\n\r\n“How does one tell time?”\r\n\r\n“Hunger—fatigue—all those things are different. Everything is\r\ndifferent—everything. To me it seems that since first we came out of\r\nthe sphere has been only a question of hours—long hours—at most.”\r\n\r\n“Ten days,” I said; “that leaves—” I looked up at the sun for a moment,\r\nand then saw that it was halfway from the zenith to the western edge of\r\nthings. “Four days! ... Cavor, we mustn’t sit here and dream. How do\r\nyou think we may begin?”\r\n\r\nI stood up. “We must get a fixed point we can recognise—we might hoist\r\na flag, or a handkerchief, or something—and quarter the ground, and\r\nwork round that.”\r\n\r\nHe stood up beside me.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, “there is nothing for it but to hunt the sphere.\r\nNothing. We may find it—certainly we may find it. And if not—”\r\n\r\n“We must keep on looking.”\r\n\r\nHe looked this way and that, glanced up at the sky and down at the\r\ntunnel, and astonished me by a sudden gesture of impatience. “Oh! but\r\nwe have done foolishly! To have come to this pass! Think how it might\r\nhave been, and the things we might have done!”\r\n\r\n“We might do something yet.”\r\n\r\n“Never the thing we might have done. Here below our feet is a world.\r\nThink of what that world must be! Think of that machine we saw, and the\r\nlid and the shaft! They were just remote outlying things, and those\r\ncreatures we have seen and fought with no more than ignorant peasants,\r\ndwellers in the outskirts, yokels and labourers half akin to brutes.\r\nDown below! Caverns beneath caverns, tunnels, structures, ways... It\r\nmust open out, and be greater and wider and more populous as one\r\ndescends. Assuredly. Right down at the last the central sea that washes\r\nround the core of the moon. Think of its inky waters under the spare\r\nlights—if, indeed, their eyes _need_ lights! Think of the cascading\r\ntributaries pouring down their channels to feed it! Think of the tides\r\nupon its surface, and the rush and swirl of its ebb and flow! Perhaps\r\nthey have ships that go upon it, perhaps down there are mighty cities\r\nand swarming ways, and wisdom and order passing the wit of man. And we\r\nmay die here upon it, and never see the masters who _must_ be—ruling\r\nover these things! We may freeze and die here, and the air will freeze\r\nand thaw upon us, and then—! Then they will come upon us, come on our\r\nstiff and silent bodies, and find the sphere we cannot find, and they\r\nwill understand at last too late all the thought and effort that ended\r\nhere in vain!”\r\n\r\nHis voice for all that speech sounded like the voice of someone heard\r\nin a telephone, weak and far away.\r\n\r\n“But the darkness,” I said.\r\n\r\n“One might get over that.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. How am I to know? One might carry a torch, one might\r\nhave a lamp— The others—might understand.”\r\n\r\nHe stood for a moment with his hands held down and a rueful face,\r\nstaring out over the waste that defied him. Then with a gesture of\r\nrenunciation he turned towards me with proposals for the systematic\r\nhunting of the sphere.\r\n\r\n“We can return,” I said.\r\n\r\nHe looked about him. “First of all we shall have to get to earth.”\r\n\r\n“We could bring back lamps to carry and climbing irons, and a hundred\r\nnecessary things.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said.\r\n\r\n“We can take back an earnest of success in this gold.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at my golden crowbars, and said nothing for a space. He stood\r\nwith his hands clasped behind his back, staring across the crater. At\r\nlast he signed and spoke. “It was _I_ found the way here, but to find a\r\nway isn’t always to be master of a way. If I take my secret back to\r\nearth, what will happen? I do not see how I can keep my secret for a\r\nyear, for even a part of a year. Sooner or later it must come out, even\r\nif other men rediscover it. And then ... Governments and powers will\r\nstruggle to get hither, they will fight against one another, and\r\nagainst these moon people; it will only spread warfare and multiply the\r\noccasions of war. In a little while, in a very little while, if I tell\r\nmy secret, this planet to its deepest galleries will be strewn with\r\nhuman dead. Other things are doubtful, but that is certain. It is not\r\nas though man had any use for the moon. What good would the moon be to\r\nmen? Even of their own planet what have they made but a battle-ground\r\nand theatre of infinite folly? Small as his world is, and short as his\r\ntime, he has still in his little life down there far more than he can\r\ndo. No! Science has toiled too long forging weapons for fools to use.\r\nIt is time she held her hand. Let him find it out for himself again—in\r\na thousand years’ time.”\r\n\r\n“There are methods of secrecy,” I said.\r\n\r\nHe looked up at me and smiled. “After all,” he said, “why should one\r\nworry? There is little chance of our finding the sphere, and down below\r\nthings are brewing. It’s simply the human habit of hoping till we die\r\nthat makes us think of return. Our troubles are only beginning. We have\r\nshown these moon folk violence, we have given them a taste of our\r\nquality, and our chances are about as good as a tiger’s that has got\r\nloose and killed a man in Hyde Park. The news of us must be running\r\ndown from gallery to gallery, down towards the central parts.... No\r\nsane beings will ever let us take that sphere back to earth after so\r\nmuch as they have seen of us.”\r\n\r\n“We aren’t improving our chances,” said I, “by sitting here.”\r\n\r\nWe stood up side by side.\r\n\r\n“After all,” he said, “we must separate. We must stick up a\r\nhandkerchief on these tall spikes here and fasten it firmly, and from\r\nthis as a centre we must work over the crater. You must go westward,\r\nmoving out in semicircles to and fro towards the setting sun. You must\r\nmove first with your shadow on your right until it is at right angles\r\nwith the direction of your handkerchief, and then with your shadow on\r\nyour left. And I will do the same to the east. We will look into every\r\ngully, examine every skerry of rocks; we will do all we can to find my\r\nsphere. If we see the Selenites we will hide from them as well as we\r\ncan. For drink we must take snow, and if we feel the need of food, we\r\nmust kill a mooncalf if we can, and eat such flesh as it has—raw—and so\r\neach will go his own way.”\r\n\r\n“And if one of us comes upon the sphere?”\r\n\r\n“He must come back to the white handkerchief, and stand by it and\r\nsignal to the other.”\r\n\r\n“And if neither?”\r\n\r\nCavor glanced up at the sun. “We go on seeking until the night and cold\r\novertake us.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose the Selenites have found the sphere and hidden it?”\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Or if presently they come hunting us?”\r\n\r\nHe made no answer.\r\n\r\n“You had better take a club,” I said.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, and stared away from me across the waste.\r\n\r\nBut for a moment he did not start. He looked round at me shyly,\r\nhesitated. “_Au revoir_,” he said.\r\n\r\nI felt an odd stab of emotion. A sense of how we had galled each other,\r\nand particularly how I must have galled him, came to me. “Confound it,”\r\nthought I, “we might have done better!” I was on the point of asking\r\nhim to shake hands—for that, somehow, was how I felt just then—when he\r\nput his feet together and leapt away from me towards the north. He\r\nseemed to drift through the air as a dead leaf would do, fell lightly,\r\nand leapt again. I stood for a moment watching him, then faced westward\r\nreluctantly, pulled myself together, and with something of the feeling\r\nof a man who leaps into icy water, selected a leaping point, and\r\nplunged forward to explore my solitary half of the moon world. I\r\ndropped rather clumsily among rocks, stood up and looked about me,\r\nclambered on to a rocky slab, and leapt again....\r\n\r\nWhen presently I looked for Cavor he was hidden from my eyes, but the\r\nhandkerchief showed out bravely on its headland, white in the blaze of\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nI determined not to lose sight of that handkerchief whatever might\r\nbetide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\nMr. Bedford Alone\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a little while it seemed to me as though I had always been alone on\r\nthe moon. I hunted for a time with a certain intentness, but the heat\r\nwas still very great, and the thinness of the air felt like a hoop\r\nabout one’s chest. I came presently into a hollow basin bristling with\r\ntall, brown, dry fronds about its edge, and I sat down under these to\r\nrest and cool. I intended to rest for only a little while. I put down\r\nmy clubs beside me, and sat resting my chin on my hands. I saw with a\r\nsort of colourless interest that the rocks of the basin, where here and\r\nthere the crackling dry lichens had shrunk away to show them, were all\r\nveined and splattered with gold, that here and there bosses of rounded\r\nand wrinkled gold projected from among the litter. What did that matter\r\nnow? A sort of languor had possession of my limbs and mind, I did not\r\nbelieve for a moment that we should ever find the sphere in that vast\r\ndesiccated wilderness. I seemed to lack a motive for effort until the\r\nSelenites should come. Then I supposed I should exert myself, obeying\r\nthat unreasonable imperative that urges a man before all things to\r\npreserve and defend his life, albeit he may preserve it only to die\r\nmore painfully in a little while.\r\n\r\nWhy had we come to the moon?\r\n\r\nThe thing presented itself to me as a perplexing problem. What is this\r\nspirit in man that urges him for ever to depart from happiness and\r\nsecurity, to toil, to place himself in danger, to risk even a\r\nreasonable certainty of death? It dawned upon me up there in the moon\r\nas a thing I ought always to have known, that man is not made simply to\r\ngo about being safe and comfortable and well fed and amused. Almost any\r\nman, if you put the thing to him, not in words, but in the shape of\r\nopportunities, will show that he knows as much. Against his interest,\r\nagainst his happiness, he is constantly being driven to do unreasonable\r\nthings. Some force not himself impels him, and go he must. But why?\r\nWhy? Sitting there in the midst of that useless moon gold, amidst the\r\nthings of another world, I took count of all my life. Assuming I was to\r\ndie a castaway upon the moon, I failed altogether to see what purpose I\r\nhad served. I got no light on that point, but at any rate it was\r\nclearer to me than it had ever been in my life before that I was not\r\nserving my own purpose, that all my life I had in truth never served\r\nthe purposes of my private life. Whose purposes, what purposes, was I\r\nserving? ... I ceased to speculate on why we had come to the moon, and\r\ntook a wider sweep. Why had I come to the earth? Why had I a private\r\nlife at all? ... I lost myself at last in bottomless speculations....\r\n\r\nMy thoughts became vague and cloudy, no longer leading in definite\r\ndirections. I had not felt heavy or weary—I cannot imagine one doing so\r\nupon the moon—but I suppose I was greatly fatigued. At any rate I\r\nslept.\r\n\r\nSlumbering there rested me greatly, I think, and the sun was setting\r\nand the violence of the heat abating, through all the time I slumbered.\r\nWhen at last I was roused from my slumbers by a remote clamour, I felt\r\nactive and capable again. I rubbed my eyes and stretched my arms. I\r\nrose to my feet—I was a little stiff—and at once prepared to resume my\r\nsearch. I shouldered my golden clubs, one on each shoulder, and went on\r\nout of the ravine of the gold-veined rocks.\r\n\r\nThe sun was certainly lower, much lower than it had been; the air was\r\nvery much cooler. I perceived I must have slept some time. It seemed to\r\nme that a faint touch of misty blueness hung about the western cliff. I\r\nleapt to a little boss of rock and surveyed the crater. I could see no\r\nsigns of mooncalves or Selenites, nor could I see Cavor, but I could\r\nsee my handkerchief far off, spread out on its thicket of thorns. I\r\nlooked about me, and then leapt forward to the next convenient\r\nview-point.\r\n\r\nI beat my way round in a semicircle, and back again in a still remoter\r\ncrescent. It was very fatiguing and hopeless. The air was really very\r\nmuch cooler, and it seemed to me that the shadow under the westward\r\ncliff was growing broad. Ever and again I stopped and reconnoitred, but\r\nthere was no sign of Cavor, no sign of Selenites; and it seemed to me\r\nthe mooncalves must have been driven into the interior again—I could\r\nsee none of them. I became more and more desirous of seeing Cavor. The\r\nwinged outline of the sun had sunk now, until it was scarcely the\r\ndistance of its diameter from the rim of the sky. I was oppressed by\r\nthe idea that the Selenites would presently close their lids and\r\nvalves, and shut us out under the inexorable onrush of the lunar night.\r\nIt seemed to me high time that he abandoned his search, and that we\r\ntook counsel together. I felt how urgent it was that we should decide\r\nsoon upon our course. We had failed to find the sphere, we no longer\r\nhad time to seek it, and once these valves were closed with us outside,\r\nwe were lost men. The great night of space would descend upon us—that\r\nblackness of the void which is the only absolute death. All my being\r\nshrank from that approach. We must get into the moon again, though we\r\nwere slain in doing it. I was haunted by a vision of our freezing to\r\ndeath, of our hammering with our last strength on the valve of the\r\ngreat pit.\r\n\r\nI took no thought any more of the sphere. I thought only of finding\r\nCavor again. I was half inclined to go back into the moon without him,\r\nrather than seek him until it was too late. I was already half-way back\r\ntowards our handkerchief, when suddenly—\r\n\r\nI saw the sphere!\r\n\r\nI did not find it so much as it found me. It was lying much farther to\r\nthe westward than I had gone, and the sloping rays of the sinking sun\r\nreflected from its glass had suddenly proclaimed its presence in a\r\ndazzling beam. For an instant I thought this was some new device of the\r\nSelenites against us, and then I understood.\r\n\r\nI threw up my arms, shouted a ghostly shout, and set off in vast leaps\r\ntowards it. I missed one of my leaps and dropped into a deep ravine and\r\ntwisted my ankle, and after that I stumbled at almost every leap. I was\r\nin a state of hysterical agitation, trembling violently, and quite\r\nbreathless long before I got to it. Three times at least I had to stop\r\nwith my hands resting on my side and in spite of the thin dryness of\r\nthe air, the perspiration was wet upon my face.\r\n\r\nI thought of nothing but the sphere until I reached it, I forgot even\r\nmy trouble of Cavor’s whereabouts. My last leap flung me with my hands\r\nhard against its glass; then I lay against it panting, and trying\r\nvainly to shout, “Cavor! here is the sphere!” When I had recovered a\r\nlittle I peered through the thick glass, and the things inside seemed\r\ntumbled. I stooped to peer closer. Then I attempted to get in. I had to\r\nhoist it over a little to get my head through the manhole. The screw\r\nstopper was inside, and I could see now that nothing had been touched,\r\nnothing had suffered. It lay there as we had left it when we had\r\ndropped out amidst the snow. For a time I was wholly occupied in making\r\nand remaking this inventory. I found I was trembling violently. It was\r\ngood to see that familiar dark interior again! I cannot tell you how\r\ngood. Presently I crept inside and sat down among the things. I looked\r\nthrough the glass at the moon world and shivered. I placed my gold\r\nclubs upon the table, and sought out and took a little food; not so\r\nmuch because I wanted it, but because it was there. Then it occurred to\r\nme that it was time to go out and signal for Cavor. But I did not go\r\nout and signal for Cavor forthwith. Something held me to the sphere.\r\n\r\nAfter all, everything was coming right. There would be still time for\r\nus to get more of the magic stone that gives one mastery over men. Away\r\nthere, close handy, was gold for the picking up; and the sphere would\r\ntravel as well half full of gold as though it were empty. We could go\r\nback now, masters of ourselves and our world, and then—\r\n\r\nI roused myself at last, and with an effort got myself out of the\r\nsphere. I shivered as I emerged, for the evening air was growing very\r\ncold. I stood in the hollow staring about me. I scrutinised the bushes\r\nround me very carefully before I leapt to the rocky shelf hard by, and\r\ntook once more what had been my first leap in the moon. But now I made\r\nit with no effort whatever.\r\n\r\nThe growth and decay of the vegetation had gone on apace, and the whole\r\naspect of the rocks had changed, but still it was possible to make out\r\nthe slope on which the seeds had germinated, and the rocky mass from\r\nwhich we had taken our first view of the crater. But the spiky shrub on\r\nthe slope stood brown and sere now, and thirty feet high, and cast long\r\nshadows that stretched out of sight, and the little seeds that\r\nclustered in its upper branches were brown and ripe. Its work was done,\r\nand it was brittle and ready to fall and crumple under the freezing\r\nair, so soon as the nightfall came. And the huge cacti, that had\r\nswollen as we watched them, had long since burst and scattered their\r\nspores to the four quarters of the moon. Amazing little corner in the\r\nuniverse—the landing place of men!\r\n\r\nSome day, thought I, I will have an inscription standing there right in\r\nthe midst of the hollow. It came to me, if only this teeming world\r\nwithin knew of the full import of the moment, how furious its tumult\r\nwould become!\r\n\r\nBut as yet it could scarcely be dreaming of the significance of our\r\ncoming. For if it did, the crater would surely be an uproar of pursuit,\r\ninstead of as still as death! I looked about for some place from which\r\nI might signal Cavor, and saw that same patch of rock to which he had\r\nleapt from my present standpoint, still bare and barren in the sun. For\r\na moment I hesitated at going so far from the sphere. Then with a pang\r\nof shame at that hesitation, I leapt....\r\n\r\nFrom this vantage point I surveyed the crater again. Far away at the\r\ntop of the enormous shadow I cast was the little white handkerchief\r\nfluttering on the bushes. It was very little and very far, and Cavor\r\nwas not in sight. It seemed to me that by this time he ought to be\r\nlooking for me. That was the agreement. But he was nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\nI stood waiting and watching, hands shading my eyes, expecting every\r\nmoment to distinguish him. Very probably I stood there for quite a long\r\ntime. I tried to shout, and was reminded of the thinness of the air. I\r\nmade an undecided step back towards the sphere. But a lurking dread of\r\nthe Selenites made me hesitate to signal my whereabouts by hoisting one\r\nof our sleeping-blankets on to the adjacent scrub. I searched the\r\ncrater again.\r\n\r\nIt had an effect of emptiness that chilled me. And it was still. Any\r\nsound from the Selenites in the world beneath had died away. It was as\r\nstill as death. Save for the faint stir of the shrub about me in the\r\nlittle breeze that was rising, there was no sound nor shadow of a\r\nsound. And the breeze blew chill.\r\n\r\nConfound Cavor!\r\n\r\nI took a deep breath. I put my hands to the sides of my mouth. “Cavor!”\r\nI bawled, and the sound was like some manikin shouting far away.\r\n\r\nI looked at the handkerchief, I looked behind me at the broadening\r\nshadow of the westward cliff, I looked under my hand at the sun. It\r\nseemed to me that almost visibly it was creeping down the sky.\r\n\r\nI felt I must act instantly if I was to save Cavor. I whipped off my\r\nvest and flung it as a mark on the sere bayonets of the shrubs behind\r\nme, and then set off in a straight line towards the handkerchief.\r\nPerhaps it was a couple of miles away—a matter of a few hundred leaps\r\nand strides. I have already told how one seemed to hang through those\r\nlunar leaps. In each suspense I sought Cavor, and marvelled why he\r\nshould be hidden. In each leap I could feel the sun setting behind me.\r\nEach time I touched the ground I was tempted to go back.\r\n\r\nA last leap and I was in the depression below our handkerchief, a\r\nstride, and I stood on our former vantage point within arms’ reach of\r\nit. I stood up straight and scanned the world about me, between its\r\nlengthening bars of shadow. Far away, down a long declivity, was the\r\nopening of the tunnel up which we had fled, and my shadow reached\r\ntowards it, stretched towards it, and touched it, like a finger of the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nNot a sign of Cavor, not a sound in all the stillness, only the stir\r\nand waving of the scrub and of the shadows increased. And suddenly and\r\nviolently I shivered. “Cav—” I began, and realised once more the\r\nuselessness of the human voice in that thin air. Silence. The silence\r\nof death.\r\n\r\nThen it was my eye caught something—a little thing lying, perhaps fifty\r\nyards away down the slope, amidst a litter of bent and broken branches.\r\nWhat was it? I knew, and yet for some reason I would not know. I went\r\nnearer to it. It was the little cricket-cap Cavor had worn. I did not\r\ntouch it, I stood looking at it.\r\n\r\nI saw then that the scattered branches about it had been forcibly\r\nsmashed and trampled. I hesitated, stepped forward, and picked it up.\r\n\r\nI stood with Cavor’s cap in my hand, staring at the trampled reeds and\r\nthorns about me. On some of them were little smears of something dark,\r\nsomething that I dared not touch. A dozen yards away, perhaps, the\r\nrising breeze dragged something into view, something small and vividly\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nIt was a little piece of paper crumpled tightly, as though it had been\r\nclutched tightly. I picked it up, and on it were smears of red. My eye\r\ncaught faint pencil marks. I smoothed it out, and saw uneven and broken\r\nwriting ending at last in a crooked streak upon the paper.\r\n\r\nI set myself to decipher this.\r\n\r\n“I have been injured about the knee, I think my kneecap is hurt, and I\r\ncannot run or crawl,” it began—pretty distinctly written.\r\n\r\nThen less legibly: “They have been chasing me for some time, and it is\r\nonly a question of”—the word “time” seemed to have been written here\r\nand erased in favour of something illegible—“before they get me. They\r\nare beating all about me.”\r\n\r\nThen the writing became convulsive. “I can hear them,” I guessed the\r\ntracing meant, and then it was quite unreadable for a space. Then came\r\na little string of words that were quite distinct: “a different sort of\r\nSelenite altogether, who appears to be directing the—” The writing\r\nbecame a mere hasty confusion again.\r\n\r\n“They have larger brain cases—much larger, and slenderer bodies, and\r\nvery short legs. They make gentle noises, and move with organized\r\ndeliberation...\r\n\r\n“And though I am wounded and helpless here, their appearance still\r\ngives me hope.” That was like Cavor. “They have not shot at me or\r\nattempted... injury. I intend—”\r\n\r\nThen came the sudden streak of the pencil across the paper, and on the\r\nback and edges—blood!\r\n\r\nAnd as I stood there stupid, and perplexed, with this dumbfounding\r\nrelic in my hand, something very soft and light and chill touched my\r\nhand for a moment and ceased to be, and then a thing, a little white\r\nspeck, drifted athwart a shadow. It was a tiny snowflake, the first\r\nsnowflake, the herald of the night.\r\n\r\nI looked up with a start, and the sky had darkened almost to blackness,\r\nand was thick with a gathering multitude of coldly watchful stars. I\r\nlooked eastward, and the light of that shrivelled world was touched\r\nwith sombre bronze; westward, and the sun robbed now by a thickening\r\nwhite mist of half its heat and splendour, was touching the crater rim,\r\nwas sinking out of sight, and all the shrubs and jagged and tumbled\r\nrocks stood out against it in a bristling disorder of black shapes.\r\nInto the great lake of darkness westward, a vast wreath of mist was\r\nsinking. A cold wind set all the crater shivering. Suddenly, for a\r\nmoment, I was in a puff of falling snow, and all the world about me\r\ngrey and dim.\r\n\r\nAnd then it was I heard, not loud and penetrating as at first, but\r\nfaint and dim like a dying voice, that tolling, that same tolling that\r\nhad welcomed the coming of the day: Boom!... Boom!... Boom!...\r\n\r\nIt echoed about the crater, it seemed to throb with the throbbing of\r\nthe greater stars, the blood-red crescent of the sun’s disc sank as it\r\ntolled out: Boom!... Boom!... Boom!...\r\n\r\nWhat had happened to Cavor? All through that tolling I stood there\r\nstupidly, and at last the tolling ceased.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly the open mouth of the tunnel down below there, shut like\r\nan eye and vanished out of sight.\r\n\r\nThen indeed was I alone.\r\n\r\nOver me, around me, closing in on me, embracing me ever nearer, was the\r\nEternal; that which was before the beginning, and that which triumphs\r\nover the end; that enormous void in which all light and life and being\r\nis but the thin and vanishing splendour of a falling star, the cold,\r\nthe stillness, the silence—the infinite and final Night of space.\r\n\r\nThe sense of solitude and desolation became the sense of an\r\noverwhelming presence that stooped towards me, that almost touched me.\r\n\r\n“No,” I cried. “_No!_ Not yet! not yet! Wait! Wait! Oh, wait!” My voice\r\nwent up to a shriek. I flung the crumpled paper from me, scrambled back\r\nto the crest to take my bearings, and then, with all the will that was\r\nin me, leapt out towards the mark I had left, dim and distant now in\r\nthe very margin of the shadow.\r\n\r\nLeap, leap, leap, and each leap was seven ages.\r\n\r\nBefore me the pale serpent-girdled section of the sun sank and sank,\r\nand the advancing shadow swept to seize the sphere before I could reach\r\nit. I was two miles away, a hundred leaps or more, and the air about me\r\nwas thinning out as it thins under an air-pump, and the cold was\r\ngripping at my joints. But had I died, I should have died leaping.\r\nOnce, and then again my foot slipped on the gathering snow as I leapt\r\nand shortened my leap; once I fell short into bushes that crashed and\r\nsmashed into dusty chips and nothingness, and once I stumbled as I\r\ndropped and rolled head over heels into a gully, and rose bruised and\r\nbleeding and confused as to my direction.\r\n\r\nBut such incidents were as nothing to the intervals, those awful pauses\r\nwhen one drifted through the air towards that pouring tide of night. My\r\nbreathing made a piping noise, and it was as though knives were\r\nwhirling in my lungs. My heart seemed to beat against the top of my\r\nbrain. “Shall I reach it? O Heaven! Shall I reach it?”\r\n\r\nMy whole being became anguish.\r\n\r\n“Lie down!” screamed my pain and despair; “lie down!”\r\n\r\nThe nearer I struggled, the more awfully remote it seemed. I was numb,\r\nI stumbled, I bruised and cut myself and did not bleed.\r\n\r\nIt was in sight.\r\n\r\nI fell on all fours, and my lungs whooped.\r\n\r\nI crawled. The frost gathered on my lips, icicles hung from my\r\nmoustache, I was white with the freezing atmosphere.\r\n\r\nI was a dozen yards from it. My eyes had become dim. “Lie down!”\r\nscreamed despair; “lie down!”\r\n\r\nI touched it, and halted. “Too late!” screamed despair; “lie down!”\r\n\r\nI fought stiffly with it. I was on the manhole lip, a stupefied,\r\nhalf-dead being. The snow was all about me. I pulled myself in. There\r\nlurked within a little warmer air.\r\n\r\nThe snowflakes—the airflakes—danced in about me, as I tried with\r\nchilling hands to thrust the valve in and spun it tight and hard. I\r\nsobbed. “I will,” I chattered in my teeth. And then, with fingers that\r\nquivered and felt brittle, I turned to the shutter studs.\r\n\r\nAs I fumbled with the switches—for I had never controlled them before—I\r\ncould see dimly through the steaming glass the blazing red streamers of\r\nthe sinking sun, dancing and flickering through the snowstorm, and the\r\nblack forms of the scrub thickening and bending and breaking beneath\r\nthe accumulating snow. Thicker whirled the snow and thicker, black\r\nagainst the light. What if even now the switches overcame me? Then\r\nsomething clicked under my hands, and in an instant that last vision of\r\nthe moon world was hidden from my eyes. I was in the silence and\r\ndarkness of the inter-planetary sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.\r\nMr. Bedford in Infinite Space\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was almost as though I had been killed. Indeed, I could imagine a\r\nman suddenly and violently killed would feel very much as I did. One\r\nmoment, a passion of agonising existence and fear; the next, darkness\r\nand stillness, neither light nor life nor sun, moon nor stars, the\r\nblank infinite. Although the thing was done by my own act, although I\r\nhad already tasted this very of effect in Cavor’s company, I felt\r\nastonished, dumbfounded, and overwhelmed. I seemed to be borne upward\r\ninto an enormous darkness. My fingers floated off the studs, I hung as\r\nif I were annihilated, and at last very softly and gently I came\r\nagainst the bale and the golden chain, and the crowbars that had\r\ndrifted to the middle of the sphere.\r\n\r\nI do not know how long that drifting took. In the sphere of course,\r\neven more than on the moon, one’s earthly time sense was ineffectual.\r\nAt the touch of the bale it was as if I had awakened from a dreamless\r\nsleep. I immediately perceived that if I wanted to keep awake and alive\r\nI must get a light or open a window, so as to get a grip of something\r\nwith my eyes. And besides, I was cold. I kicked off from the bale,\r\ntherefore, clawed on to the thin cords within the glass, crawled along\r\nuntil I got to the manhole rim, and so got my bearings for the light\r\nand blind studs, took a shove off, and flying once round the bale, and\r\ngetting a scare from something big and flimsy that was drifting loose,\r\nI got my hand on the cord quite close to the studs, and reached them. I\r\nlit the little lamp first of all to see what it was I had collided\r\nwith, and discovered that old copy of _Lloyd’s News_ had slipped its\r\nmoorings, and was adrift in the void. That brought me out of the\r\ninfinite to my own proper dimensions again. It made me laugh and pant\r\nfor a time, and suggested the idea of a little oxygen from one of the\r\ncylinders. After that I lit the heater until I felt warm, and then I\r\ntook food. Then I set to work in a very gingerly fashion on the\r\nCavorite blinds, to see if I could guess by any means how the sphere\r\nwas travelling.\r\n\r\nThe first blind I opened I shut at once, and hung for a time flattened\r\nand blinded by the sunlight that had hit me. After thinking a little I\r\nstarted upon the windows at right angles to this one, and got the huge\r\ncrescent moon and the little crescent earth behind it, the second time.\r\nI was amazed to find how far I was from the moon. I had reckoned that\r\nnot only should I have little or none of the “kick-off” that the\r\nearth’s atmosphere had given us at our start, but that the tangential\r\n“fly off” of the moon’s spin would be at least twenty-eight times less\r\nthan the earth’s. I had expected to discover myself hanging over our\r\ncrater, and on the edge of the night, but all that was now only a part\r\nof the outline of the white crescent that filled the sky. And Cavor—?\r\n\r\nHe was already infinitesimal.\r\n\r\nI tried to imagine what could have happened to him. But at that time I\r\ncould think of nothing but death. I seemed to see him, bent and smashed\r\nat the foot of some interminably high cascade of blue. And all about\r\nhim the stupid insects stared...\r\n\r\nUnder the inspiring touch of the drifting newspaper I became practical\r\nagain for a while. It was quite clear to me that what I had to do was\r\nto get back to earth, but as far as I could see I was drifting away\r\nfrom it. Whatever had happened to Cavor, even if he was still alive,\r\nwhich seemed to me incredible after that blood-stained scrap, I was\r\npowerless to help him. There he was, living or dead behind the mantle\r\nof that rayless night, and there he must remain at least until I could\r\nsummon our fellow men to his assistance. Should I do that? Something of\r\nthe sort I had in my mind; to come back to earth if it were possible,\r\nand then as maturer consideration might determine, either to show and\r\nexplain the sphere to a few discreet persons, and act with them, or\r\nelse to keep my secret, sell my gold, obtain weapons, provisions, and\r\nan assistant, and return with these advantages to deal on equal terms\r\nwith the flimsy people of the moon, to rescue Cavor, if that were still\r\npossible, and at any rate to procure a sufficient supply of gold to\r\nplace my subsequent proceedings on a firmer basis. But that was hoping\r\nfar; I had first to get back.\r\n\r\nI set myself to decide just exactly how the return to earth could be\r\ncontrived. As I struggled with that problem I ceased to worry about\r\nwhat I should do when I got there. At last my only care was to get\r\nback.\r\n\r\nI puzzled out at last that my best chance would be to drop back towards\r\nthe moon as near as I dared in order to gather velocity, then to shut\r\nmy windows, and fly behind it, and when I was past to open my earthward\r\nwindows, and so get off at a good pace homeward. But whether I should\r\never reach the earth by that device, or whether I might not simply find\r\nmyself spinning about it in some hyperbolic or parabolic curve or\r\nother, I could not tell. Later I had a happy inspiration, and by\r\nopening certain windows to the moon, which had appeared in the sky in\r\nfront of the earth, I turned my course aside so as to head off the\r\nearth, which it had become evident to me I must pass behind without\r\nsome such expedient. I did a very great deal of complicated thinking\r\nover these problems—for I am no mathematician—and in the end I am\r\ncertain it was much more my good luck than my reasoning that enabled me\r\nto hit the earth. Had I known then, as I know now, the mathematical\r\nchances there were against me, I doubt if I should have troubled even\r\nto touch the studs to make any attempt. And having puzzled out what I\r\nconsidered to be the thing to do, I opened all my moonward windows, and\r\nsquatted down—the effort lifted me for a time some feet or so into the\r\nair, and I hung there in the oddest way—and waited for the crescent to\r\nget bigger and bigger until I felt I was near enough for safety. Then I\r\nwould shut the windows, fly past the moon with the velocity I had got\r\nfrom it—if I did not smash upon it—and so go on towards the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd that is what I did.\r\n\r\nAt last I felt my moonward start was sufficient. I shut out the sight\r\nof the moon from my eyes, and in a state of mind that was, I now\r\nrecall, incredibly free from anxiety or any distressful quality, I sat\r\ndown to begin a vigil in that little speck of matter in infinite space\r\nthat would last until I should strike the earth. The heater had made\r\nthe sphere tolerably warm, the air had been refreshed by the oxygen,\r\nand except for that faint congestion of the head that was always with\r\nme while I was away from earth, I felt entire physical comfort. I had\r\nextinguished the light again, lest it should fail me in the end; I was\r\nin darkness, save for the earthshine and the glitter of the stars below\r\nme. Everything was so absolutely silent and still that I might indeed\r\nhave been the only being in the universe, and yet, strangely enough, I\r\nhad no more feeling of loneliness or fear than if I had been lying in\r\nbed on earth. Now, this seems all the stranger to me, since during my\r\nlast hours in that crater of the moon, the sense of my utter loneliness\r\nhad been an agony....\r\n\r\nIncredible as it will seem, this interval of time that I spent in space\r\nhas no sort of proportion to any other interval of time in my life.\r\nSometimes it seemed as though I sat through immeasurable eternities\r\nlike some god upon a lotus leaf, and again as though there was a\r\nmomentary pause as I leapt from moon to earth. In truth, it was\r\naltogether some weeks of earthly time. But I had done with care and\r\nanxiety, hunger or fear, for that space. I floated, thinking with a\r\nstrange breadth and freedom of all that we had undergone, and of all my\r\nlife and motives, and the secret issues of my being. I seemed to myself\r\nto have grown greater and greater, to have lost all sense of movement;\r\nto be floating amidst the stars, and always the sense of earth’s\r\nlittleness and the infinite littleness of my life upon it, was implicit\r\nin my thoughts.\r\n\r\nI can’t profess to explain the things that happened in my mind. No\r\ndoubt they could all be traced directly or indirectly to the curious\r\nphysical conditions under which I was living. I set them down here just\r\nfor what they are worth, and without any comment. The most prominent\r\nquality of it was a pervading doubt of my own identity. I became, if I\r\nmay so express it, dissociate from Bedford; I looked down on Bedford as\r\na trivial, incidental thing with which I chanced to be connected. I saw\r\nBedford in many relations—as an ass or as a poor beast, where I had\r\nhitherto been inclined to regard him with a quiet pride as a very\r\nspirited or rather forcible person. I saw him not only as an ass, but\r\nas the son of many generations of asses. I reviewed his school-days and\r\nhis early manhood, and his first encounter with love, very much as one\r\nmight review the proceedings of an ant in the sand. Something of that\r\nperiod of lucidity I regret still hangs about me, and I doubt if I\r\nshall ever recover the full-bodied self satisfaction of my early days.\r\nBut at the time the thing was not in the least painful, because I had\r\nthat extraordinary persuasion that, as a matter of fact, I was no more\r\nBedford than I was any one else, but only a mind floating in the still\r\nserenity of space. Why should I be disturbed about this Bedford’s\r\nshortcomings? I was not responsible for him or them.\r\n\r\nFor a time I struggled against this really very grotesque delusion. I\r\ntried to summon the memory of vivid moments, of tender or intense\r\nemotions to my assistance; I felt that if I could recall one genuine\r\ntwinge of feeling the growing severance would be stopped. But I could\r\nnot do it. I saw Bedford rushing down Chancery Lane, hat on the back of\r\nhis head, coat tails flying out, _en route_ for his public examination.\r\nI saw him dodging and bumping against, and even saluting, other similar\r\nlittle creatures in that swarming gutter of people. Me? I saw Bedford\r\nthat same evening in the sitting-room of a certain lady, and his hat\r\nwas on the table beside him, and it wanted brushing badly, and he was\r\nin tears. Me? I saw him with that lady in various attitudes and\r\nemotions—I never felt so detached before.... I saw him hurrying off to\r\nLympne to write a play, and accosting Cavor, and in his shirt sleeves\r\nworking at the sphere, and walking out to Canterbury because he was\r\nafraid to come! Me? I did not believe it.\r\n\r\nI still reasoned that all this was hallucination due to my solitude,\r\nand the fact that I had lost all weight and sense of resistance. I\r\nendeavoured to recover that sense by banging myself about the sphere,\r\nby pinching my hands and clasping them together. Among other things, I\r\nlit the light, captured that torn copy of _Lloyd’s_, and read those\r\nconvincingly realistic advertisements about the Cutaway bicycle, and\r\nthe gentleman of private means, and the lady in distress who was\r\nselling those “forks and spoons.” There was no doubt they existed\r\nsurely enough, and, said I, “This is your world, and you are Bedford,\r\nand you are going back to live among things like that for all the rest\r\nof your life.” But the doubts within me could still argue: “It is not\r\nyou that is reading, it is Bedford, but you are not Bedford, you know.\r\nThat’s just where the mistake comes in.”\r\n\r\n“Confound it!” I cried; “and if I am not Bedford, what am I?”\r\n\r\nBut in that direction no light was forthcoming, though the strangest\r\nfancies came drifting into my brain, queer remote suspicions, like\r\nshadows seen from away. Do you know, I had a sort of idea that really I\r\nwas something quite outside not only the world, but all worlds, and out\r\nof space and time, and that this poor Bedford was just a peephole\r\nthrough which I looked at life? ...\r\n\r\nBedford! However I disavowed him, there I was most certainly bound up\r\nwith him, and I knew that wherever or whatever I might be, I must needs\r\nfeel the stress of his desires, and sympathise with all his joys and\r\nsorrows until his life should end. And with the dying of Bedford—what\r\nthen? ...\r\n\r\nEnough of this remarkable phase of my experiences! I tell it here\r\nsimply to show how one’s isolation and departure from this planet\r\ntouched not only the functions and feeling of every organ of the body,\r\nbut indeed also the very fabric of the mind, with strange and\r\nunanticipated disturbances. All through the major portion of that vast\r\nspace journey I hung thinking of such immaterial things as these, hung\r\ndissociated and apathetic, a cloudy megalomaniac, as it were, amidst\r\nthe stars and planets in the void of space; and not only the world to\r\nwhich I was returning, but the blue-lit caverns of the Selenites, their\r\nhelmet faces, their gigantic and wonderful machines, and the fate of\r\nCavor, dragged helpless into that world, seemed infinitely minute and\r\naltogether trivial things to me.\r\n\r\nUntil at last I began to feel the pull of the earth upon my being,\r\ndrawing me back again to the life that is real for men. And then,\r\nindeed, it grew clearer and clearer to me that I was quite certainly\r\nBedford after all, and returning after amazing adventures to this world\r\nof ours, and with a life that I was very likely to lose in this return.\r\nI set myself to puzzle out the conditions under which I must fall to\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.\r\nMr. Bedford at Littlestone\r\n\r\n\r\nMy line of flight was about parallel with the surface as I came into\r\nthe upper air. The temperature of the sphere began to rise forthwith. I\r\nknew it behoved me to drop at once. Far below me, in a darkling\r\ntwilight, stretched a great expanse of sea. I opened every window I\r\ncould, and fell—out of sunshine into evening, and out of evening into\r\nnight. Vaster grew the earth and vaster, swallowing up the stars, and\r\nthe silvery translucent starlit veil of cloud it wore spread out to\r\ncatch me. At last the world seemed no longer a sphere but flat, and\r\nthen concave. It was no longer a planet in the sky, but the world of\r\nMan. I shut all but an inch or so of earthward window, and dropped with\r\na slackening velocity. The broadening water, now so near that I could\r\nsee the dark glitter of the waves, rushed up to meet me. The sphere\r\nbecame very hot. I snapped the last strip of window, and sat scowling\r\nand biting my knuckles, waiting for the impact....\r\n\r\nThe sphere hit the water with a huge splash: it must have sent it\r\nfathoms high. At the splash I flung the Cavorite shutters open. Down I\r\nwent, but slower and slower, and then I felt the sphere pressing\r\nagainst my feet, and so drove up again as a bubble drives. And at the\r\nlast I was floating and rocking upon the surface of the sea, and my\r\njourney in space was at an end.\r\n\r\nThe night was dark and overcast. Two yellow pinpoints far away showed\r\nthe passing of a ship, and nearer was a red glare that came and went.\r\nHad not the electricity of my glow-lamp exhausted itself, I could have\r\ngot picked up that night. In spite of the inordinate fatigue I was\r\nbeginning to feel, I was excited now, and for a time hopeful, in a\r\nfeverish, impatient way, that so my travelling might end.\r\n\r\nBut at last I ceased to move about, and sat, wrists on knees, staring\r\nat a distant red light. It swayed up and down, rocking, rocking. My\r\nexcitement passed. I realised I had yet to spend another night at least\r\nin the sphere. I perceived myself infinitely heavy and fatigued. And so\r\nI fell asleep.\r\n\r\nA change in my rhythmic motion awakened me. I peered through the\r\nrefracting glass, and saw that I had come aground upon a huge shallow\r\nof sand. Far away I seemed to see houses and trees, and seaward a\r\ncurved, vague distortion of a ship hung between sea and sky.\r\n\r\nI stood up and staggered. My one desire was to emerge. The manhole was\r\nupward, and I wrestled with the screw. Slowly I opened the manhole. At\r\nlast the air was singing in again as once it had sung out. But this\r\ntime I did not wait until the pressure was adjusted. In another moment\r\nI had the weight of the window on my hands, and I was open, wide open,\r\nto the old familiar sky of earth.\r\n\r\nThe air hit me on the chest so that I gasped. I dropped the glass\r\nscrew. I cried out, put my hands to my chest, and sat down. For a time\r\nI was in pain. Then I took deep breaths. At last I could rise and move\r\nabout again.\r\n\r\nI tried to thrust my head through the manhole, and the sphere rolled\r\nover. It was as though something had lugged my head down directly it\r\nemerged. I ducked back sharply, or I should have been pinned face under\r\nwater. After some wriggling and shoving I managed to crawl out upon\r\nsand, over which the retreating waves still came and went.\r\n\r\nI did not attempt to stand up. It seemed to me that my body must be\r\nsuddenly changed to lead. Mother Earth had her grip on me now—no\r\nCavorite intervening. I sat down heedless of the water that came over\r\nmy feet.\r\n\r\nIt was dawn, a grey dawn, rather overcast but showing here and there a\r\nlong patch of greenish grey. Some way out a ship was lying at anchor, a\r\npale silhouette of a ship with one yellow light. The water came\r\nrippling in in long shallow waves. Away to the right curved the land, a\r\nshingle bank with little hovels, and at last a lighthouse, a sailing\r\nmark and a point. Inland stretched a space of level sand, broken here\r\nand there by pools of water, and ending a mile away perhaps in a low\r\nshore of scrub. To the north-east some isolated watering-place was\r\nvisible, a row of gaunt lodging-houses, the tallest things that I could\r\nsee on earth, dull dabs against the brightening sky. What strange men\r\ncan have reared these vertical piles in such an amplitude of space I do\r\nnot know. There they are, like pieces of Brighton lost in the waste.\r\n\r\nFor a long time I sat there, yawning and rubbing my face. At last I\r\nstruggled to rise. It made me feel that I was lifting a weight. I stood\r\nup.\r\n\r\nI stared at the distant houses. For the first time since our starvation\r\nin the crater I thought of earthly food. “Bacon,” I whispered, “eggs.\r\nGood toast and good coffee.... And how the devil am I going to get all\r\nthis stuff to Lympne?” I wondered where I was. It was an east shore\r\nanyhow, and I had seen Europe before I dropped.\r\n\r\nI heard footsteps crunching in the sand, and a little round-faced,\r\nfriendly-looking man in flannels, with a bathing towel wrapped about\r\nhis shoulders, and his bathing dress over his arm, appeared up the\r\nbeach. I knew instantly that I must be in England. He was staring most\r\nintently at the sphere and me. He advanced staring. I dare say I looked\r\na ferocious savage enough—dirty, unkempt, to an indescribable degree;\r\nbut it did not occur to me at the time. He stopped at a distance of\r\ntwenty yards. “Hul-lo, my man!” he said doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“Hullo yourself!” said I.\r\n\r\nHe advanced, reassured by that. “What on earth is that thing?” he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“Can you tell me where I am?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“That’s Littlestone,” he said, pointing to the houses; “and that’s\r\nDungeness! Have you just landed? What’s that thing you’ve got? Some\r\nsort of machine?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Have you floated ashore? Have you been wrecked or something? What is\r\nit?”\r\n\r\nI meditated swiftly. I made an estimate of the little man’s appearance\r\nas he drew nearer. “By Jove!” he said, “you’ve had a time of it! I\r\nthought you— Well— Where were you cast away? Is that thing a sort of\r\nfloating thing for saving life?”\r\n\r\nI decided to take that line for the present. I made a few vague\r\naffirmatives. “I want help,” I said hoarsely. “I want to get some stuff\r\nup the beach—stuff I can’t very well leave about.” I became aware of\r\nthree other pleasant-looking young men with towels, blazers, and straw\r\nhats, coming down the sands towards me. Evidently the early bathing\r\nsection of this Littlestone.\r\n\r\n“Help!” said the young man: “rather!” He became vaguely active. “What\r\nparticularly do you want done?” He turned round and gesticulated. The\r\nthree young men accelerated their pace. In a minute they were about me,\r\nplying me with questions I was indisposed to answer. “I’ll tell all\r\nthat later,” I said. “I’m dead beat. I’m a rag.”\r\n\r\n“Come up to the hotel,” said the foremost little man. “We’ll look after\r\nthat thing there.”\r\n\r\nI hesitated. “I can’t,” I said. “In that sphere there’s two big bars of\r\ngold.”\r\n\r\nThey looked incredulously at one another, then at me with a new\r\ninquiry. I went to the sphere, stooped, crept in, and presently they\r\nhad the Selenites’ crowbars and the broken chain before them. If I had\r\nnot been so horribly fagged I could have laughed at them. It was like\r\nkittens round a beetle. They didn’t know what to do with the stuff. The\r\nfat little man stooped and lifted the end of one of the bars, and then\r\ndropped it with a grunt. Then they all did.\r\n\r\n“It’s lead, or gold!” said one.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it’s _gold!_” said another.\r\n\r\n“Gold, right enough,” said the third.\r\n\r\nThen they all stared at me, and then they all stared at the ship lying\r\nat anchor.\r\n\r\n“I say!” cried the little man. “But where did you get that?”\r\n\r\nI was too tired to keep up a lie. “I got it in the moon.”\r\n\r\nI saw them stare at one another.\r\n\r\n“Look here!” said I, “I’m not going to argue now. Help me carry these\r\nlumps of gold up to the hotel—I guess, with rests, two of you can\r\nmanage one, and I’ll trail this chain thing—and I’ll tell you more when\r\nI’ve had some food.”\r\n\r\n“And how about that thing?”\r\n\r\n“It won’t hurt there,” I said. “Anyhow—confound it!—it must stop there\r\nnow. If the tide comes up, it will float all right.”\r\n\r\nAnd in a state of enormous wonderment, these young men most obediently\r\nhoisted my treasures on their shoulders, and with limbs that felt like\r\nlead I headed a sort of procession towards that distant fragment of\r\n“sea-front.” Half-way there we were reinforced by two awe-stricken\r\nlittle girls with spades, and later a lean little boy, with a\r\npenetrating sniff, appeared. He was, I remember, wheeling a bicycle,\r\nand he accompanied us at a distance of about a hundred yards on our\r\nright flank, and then I suppose, gave us up as uninteresting, mounted\r\nhis bicycle and rode off over the level sands in the direction of the\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\nI glanced back after him.\r\n\r\n“_He_ won’t touch it,” said the stout young man reassuringly, and I was\r\nonly too willing to be reassured.\r\n\r\nAt first something of the grey of the morning was in my mind, but\r\npresently the sun disengaged itself from the level clouds of the\r\nhorizon and lit the world, and turned the leaden sea to glittering\r\nwaters. My spirits rose. A sense of the vast importance of the things I\r\nhad done and had yet to do came with the sunlight into my mind. I\r\nlaughed aloud as the foremost man staggered under my gold. When indeed\r\nI took my place in the world, how amazed the world would be!\r\n\r\nIf it had not been for my inordinate fatigue, the landlord of the\r\nLittlestone hotel would have been amusing, as he hesitated between my\r\ngold and my respectable company on the one and my filthy appearance on\r\nthe other. But at last I found myself in a terrestrial bathroom once\r\nmore with warm water to wash myself with, and a change of raiment,\r\npreposterously small indeed, but anyhow clean, that the genial little\r\nman had lent me. He lent me a razor too, but I could not screw up my\r\nresolution to attack even the outposts of the bristling beard that\r\ncovered my face.\r\n\r\nI sat down to an English breakfast and ate with a sort of languid\r\nappetite—an appetite many weeks old and very decrepit—and stirred\r\nmyself to answer the questions of the four young men. And I told them\r\nthe truth.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said I, “as you press me—I got it in the moon.”\r\n\r\n“The moon?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, the moon in the sky.”\r\n\r\n“But how do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“What I say, confound it!”\r\n\r\n“Then you have just come from the moon?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly! through space—in that ball.” And I took a delicious mouthful\r\nof egg. I made a private note that when I went back to the moon I would\r\ntake a box of eggs.\r\n\r\nI could see clearly that they did not believe one word of what I told\r\nthem, but evidently they considered me the most respectable liar they\r\nhad ever met. They glanced at one another, and then concentrated the\r\nfire of their eyes on me. I fancy they expected a clue to me in the way\r\nI helped myself to salt. They seemed to find something significant in\r\nmy peppering my egg. These strangely shaped masses of gold they had\r\nstaggered under held their minds. There the lumps lay in front of me,\r\neach worth thousands of pounds, and as impossible for any one to steal\r\nas a house or a piece of land. As I looked at their curious faces over\r\nmy coffee-cup, I realised something of the enormous wilderness of\r\nexplanations into which I should have to wander to render myself\r\ncomprehensible again.\r\n\r\n“You don’t _really_ mean—” began the youngest young man, in the tone of\r\none who speaks to an obstinate child.\r\n\r\n“Just pass me that toast-rack,” I said, and shut him up completely.\r\n\r\n“But look here, I say,” began one of the others. “We’re not going to\r\nbelieve that, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, well,” said I, and shrugged my shoulders.\r\n\r\n“He doesn’t want to tell us,” said the youngest young man in a stage\r\naside; and then, with an appearance of great _sang-froid_, “You don’t\r\nmind if I take a cigarette?”\r\n\r\nI waved him a cordial assent, and proceeded with my breakfast. Two of\r\nthe others went and looked out of the farther window and talked\r\ninaudibly. I was struck by a thought. “The tide,” I said, “is running\r\nout?”\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, a doubt who should answer me.\r\n\r\n“It’s near the ebb,” said the fat little man.\r\n\r\n“Well, anyhow,” I said, “it won’t float far.”\r\n\r\nI decapitated my third egg, and began a little speech. “Look here,” I\r\nsaid. “Please don’t imagine I’m surly or telling you uncivil lies, or\r\nanything of that sort. I’m forced almost, to be a little short and\r\nmysterious. I can quite understand this is as queer as it can be, and\r\nthat your imaginations must be going it. I can assure you, you’re in at\r\na memorable time. But I can’t make it clear to you now—it’s impossible.\r\nI give you my word of honour I’ve come from the moon, and that’s all I\r\ncan tell you.... All the same, I’m tremendously obliged to you, you\r\nknow, tremendously. I hope that my manner hasn’t in any way given you\r\noffence.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, not in the least!” said the youngest young man affably. “We can\r\nquite understand,” and staring hard at me all the time, he heeled his\r\nchair back until it very nearly upset, and recovered with some\r\nexertion. “Not a bit of it,” said the fat young man.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you imagine _that!_” and they all got up and dispersed, and\r\nwalked about and lit cigarettes, and generally tried to show they were\r\nperfectly amiable and disengaged, and entirely free from the slightest\r\ncuriosity about me and the sphere. “I’m going to keep an eye on that\r\nship out there all the same,” I heard one of them remarking in an\r\nundertone. If only they could have forced themselves to it, they would,\r\nI believe, even have gone out and left me. I went on with my third egg.\r\n\r\n“The weather,” the fat little man remarked presently, “has been\r\nimmense, has it not? I don’t know _when_ we have had such a summer.”\r\n\r\nPhoo-whizz! Like a tremendous rocket!\r\n\r\nAnd somewhere a window was broken....\r\n\r\n“What’s that?” said I.\r\n\r\n“It isn’t—?” cried the little man, and rushed to the corner window.\r\n\r\nAll the others rushed to the window likewise. I sat staring at them.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I leapt up, knocked over my third egg, rushed for the window\r\nalso. I had just thought of something. “Nothing to be seen there,”\r\ncried the little man, rushing for the door.\r\n\r\n“It’s that boy!” I cried, bawling in hoarse fury; “it’s that accursed\r\nboy!” and turning about I pushed the waiter aside—he was just bringing\r\nme some more toast—and rushed violently out of the room and down and\r\nout upon the queer little esplanade in front of the hotel.\r\n\r\nThe sea, which had been smooth, was rough now with hurrying cat’s-paws,\r\nand all about where the sphere had been was tumbled water like the wake\r\nof a ship. Above, a little puff of cloud whirled like dispersing smoke,\r\nand the three or four people on the beach were staring up with\r\ninterrogative faces towards the point of that unexpected report. And\r\nthat was all! Boots and waiter and the four young men in blazers came\r\nrushing out behind me. Shouts came from windows and doors, and all\r\nsorts of worrying people came into sight—agape.\r\n\r\nFor a time I stood there, too overwhelmed by this new development to\r\nthink of the people.\r\n\r\nAt first I was too stunned to see the thing as any definite disaster—I\r\nwas just stunned, as a man is by some accidental violent blow. It is\r\nonly afterwards he begins to appreciate his specific injury.\r\n\r\n“Good Lord!”\r\n\r\nI felt as though somebody was pouring funk out of a can down the back\r\nof my neck. My legs became feeble. I had got the first intimation of\r\nwhat the disaster meant for me. There was that confounded boy—sky high!\r\nI was utterly left. There was the gold in the coffee-room—my only\r\npossession on earth. How would it all work out? The general effect was\r\nof a gigantic unmanageable confusion.\r\n\r\n“I say,” said the voice of the little man behind. “I _say_, you know.”\r\n\r\nI wheeled about, and there were twenty or thirty people, a sort of\r\nirregular investment of people, all bombarding me with dumb\r\ninterrogation, with infinite doubt and suspicion. I felt the compulsion\r\nof their eyes intolerably. I groaned aloud.\r\n\r\n“I _can’t_,” I shouted. “I tell you I can’t! I’m not equal to it! You\r\nmust puzzle and—and be damned to you!”\r\n\r\nI gesticulated convulsively. He receded a step as though I had\r\nthreatened him. I made a bolt through them into the hotel. I charged\r\nback into the coffee-room, rang the bell furiously. I gripped the\r\nwaiter as he entered. “D’ye hear?” I shouted. “Get help and carry these\r\nbars up to my room right away.”\r\n\r\nHe failed to understand me, and I shouted and raved at him. A\r\nscared-looking little old man in a green apron appeared, and further\r\ntwo of the young men in flannels. I made a dash at them and\r\ncommandeered their services. As soon as the gold was in my room I felt\r\nfree to quarrel. “Now get out,” I shouted; “all of you get out if you\r\ndon’t want to see a man go mad before your eyes!” And I helped the\r\nwaiter by the shoulder as he hesitated in the doorway. And then, as\r\nsoon as I had the door locked on them all, I tore off the little man’s\r\nclothes again, shied them right and left, and got into bed forthwith.\r\nAnd there I lay swearing and panting and cooling for a very long time.\r\n\r\nAt last I was calm enough to get out of bed and ring up the round-eyed\r\nwaiter for a flannel nightshirt, a soda and whisky, and some good\r\ncigars. And these things being procured me, after an exasperating delay\r\nthat drove me several times to the bell, I locked the door again and\r\nproceeded very deliberately to look the entire situation in the face.\r\n\r\nThe net result of the great experiment presented itself as an absolute\r\nfailure. It was a rout, and I was the sole survivor. It was an absolute\r\ncollapse, and this was the final disaster. There was nothing for it but\r\nto save myself, and as much as I could in the way of prospects from our\r\n_débâcle_. At one fatal crowning blow all my vague resolutions of\r\nreturn and recovery had vanished. My intention of going back to the\r\nmoon, of getting a sphereful of gold, and afterwards of having a\r\nfragment of Cavorite analysed and so recovering the great\r\nsecret—perhaps, finally, even of recovering Cavor’s body—all these\r\nideas vanished altogether.\r\n\r\nI was the sole survivor, and that was all.\r\n\r\nI think that going to bed was one of the luckiest ideas I have ever had\r\nin an emergency. I really believe I should either have got loose-headed\r\nor done some indiscreet thing. But there, locked in and secure from all\r\ninterruptions, I could think out the position in all its bearings and\r\nmake my arrangements at leisure.\r\n\r\nOf course, it was quite clear to me what had happened to the boy. He\r\nhad crawled into the sphere, meddled with the studs, shut the Cavorite\r\nwindows, and gone up. It was highly improbable he had screwed the\r\nmanhole stopper, and, even if he had, the chances were a thousand to\r\none against his getting back. It was fairly evident that he would\r\ngravitate with my bales to somewhere near the middle of the sphere and\r\nremain there, and so cease to be a legitimate terrestrial interest,\r\nhowever remarkable he might seem to the inhabitants of some remote\r\nquarter of space. I very speedily convinced myself on that point. And\r\nas for any responsibility I might have in the matter, the more I\r\nreflected upon that, the clearer it became that if only I kept quiet\r\nabout things, I need not trouble myself about that. If I was faced by\r\nsorrowing parents demanding their lost boy, I had merely to demand my\r\nlost sphere—or ask them what they meant. At first I had had a vision of\r\nweeping parents and guardians, and all sorts of complications; but now\r\nI saw that I simply had to keep my mouth shut, and nothing in that way\r\ncould arise. And, indeed, the more I lay and smoked and thought, the\r\nmore evident became the wisdom of impenetrability.\r\n\r\nIt is within the right of every British citizen, provided he does not\r\ncommit damage nor indecorum, to appear suddenly wherever he pleases,\r\nand as ragged and filthy as he pleases, and with whatever amount of\r\nvirgin gold he sees fit to encumber himself, and no one has any right\r\nat all to hinder and detain him in this procedure. I formulated that at\r\nlast to myself, and repeated it over as a sort of private Magna Charta\r\nof my liberty.\r\n\r\nOnce I had put that issue on one side, I could take up and consider in\r\nan equable manner certain considerations I had scarcely dared to think\r\nof before, namely, those arising out of the circumstances of my\r\nbankruptcy. But now, looking at this matter calmly and at leisure, I\r\ncould see that if only I suppressed my identity by a temporary\r\nassumption of some less well-known name, and if I retained the two\r\nmonths’ beard that had grown upon me, the risks of any annoyance from\r\nthe spiteful creditor to whom I have already alluded became very small\r\nindeed. From that to a definite course of rational worldly action was\r\nplain sailing. It was all amazingly petty, no doubt, but what was there\r\nremaining for me to do?\r\n\r\nWhatever I did I was resolved that I would keep myself level and right\r\nside up.\r\n\r\nI ordered up writing materials, and addressed a letter to the New\r\nRomney Bank—the nearest, the waiter informed me—telling the manager I\r\nwished to open an account with him, and requesting him to send two\r\ntrustworthy persons properly authenticated in a cab with a good horse\r\nto fetch some hundredweight of gold with which I happened to be\r\nencumbered. I signed the letter “Blake,” which seemed to me to be a\r\nthoroughly respectable sort of name. This done, I got a Folkstone Blue\r\nBook, picked out an outfitter, and asked him to send a cutter to\r\nmeasure me for a dark tweed suit, ordering at the same time a valise,\r\ndressing bag, brown boots, shirts, hat (to fit), and so forth; and from\r\na watchmaker I also ordered a watch. And these letters being\r\ndespatched, I had up as good a lunch as the hotel could give, and then\r\nlay smoking a cigar, as calm and ordinary as possible, until in\r\naccordance with my instructions two duly authenticated clerks came from\r\nthe bank and weighed and took away my gold. After which I pulled the\r\nclothes over my ears in order to drown any knocking, and went very\r\ncomfortably to sleep.\r\n\r\nI went to sleep. No doubt it was a prosaic thing for the first man back\r\nfrom the moon to do, and I can imagine that the young and imaginative\r\nreader will find my behaviour disappointing. But I was horribly\r\nfatigued and bothered, and, confound it! what else was there to do?\r\nThere certainly was not the remotest chance of my being believed, if I\r\nhad told my story then, and it would certainly have subjected me to\r\nintolerable annoyances. I went to sleep. When at last I woke up again I\r\nwas ready to face the world as I have always been accustomed to face it\r\nsince I came to years of discretion. And so I got away to Italy, and\r\nthere it is I am writing this story. If the world will not have it as\r\nfact, then the world may take it as fiction. It is no concern of mine.\r\n\r\nAnd now that the account is finished, I am amazed to think how\r\ncompletely this adventure is gone and done with. Everybody believes\r\nthat Cavor was a not very brilliant scientific experimenter who blew up\r\nhis house and himself at Lympne, and they explain the bang that\r\nfollowed my arrival at Littlestone by a reference to the experiments\r\nwith explosives that are going on continually at the government\r\nestablishment of Lydd, two miles away. I must confess that hitherto I\r\nhave not acknowledged my share in the disappearance of Master Tommy\r\nSimmons, which was that little boy’s name. That, perhaps, may prove a\r\ndifficult item of corroboration to explain away. They account for my\r\nappearance in rags with two bars of indisputable gold upon the\r\nLittlestone beach in various ingenious ways—it doesn’t worry me what\r\nthey think of me. They say I have strung all these things together to\r\navoid being questioned too closely as to the source of my wealth. I\r\nwould like to see the man who could invent a story that would hold\r\ntogether like this one. Well, they must take it as fiction—there it is.\r\n\r\nI have told my story—and now, I suppose, I have to take up the worries\r\nof this terrestrial life again. Even if one has been to the moon, one\r\nhas still to earn a living. So I am working here at Amalfi, on the\r\nscenario of that play I sketched before Cavor came walking into my\r\nworld, and I am trying to piece my life together as it was before ever\r\nI saw him. I must confess that I find it hard to keep my mind on the\r\nplay when the moonshine comes into my room. It is full moon here, and\r\nlast night I was out on the pergola for hours, staring away at the\r\nshining blankness that hides so much. Imagine it! tables and chairs,\r\nand trestles and bars of gold! Confound it!—if only one could hit on\r\nthat Cavorite again! But a thing like that doesn’t come twice in a\r\nlife. Here I am, a little better off than I was at Lympne, and that is\r\nall. And Cavor has committed suicide in a more elaborate way than any\r\nhuman being ever did before. So the story closes as finally and\r\ncompletely as a dream. It fits in so little with all the other things\r\nof life, so much of it is so utterly remote from all human experience,\r\nthe leaping, the eating, the breathing, and these weightless times,\r\nthat indeed there are moments when, in spite of my moon gold, I do more\r\nthan half believe myself that the whole thing was a dream....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.\r\nThe Astonishing Communication of Mr. Julius Wendigee\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I had finished my account of my return to the earth at\r\nLittlestone, I wrote, “The End,” made a flourish, and threw my pen\r\naside, fully believing that the whole story of the First Men in the\r\nMoon was done. Not only had I done this, but I had placed my manuscript\r\nin the hands of a literary agent, had permitted it to be sold, had seen\r\nthe greater portion of it appear in the _Strand Magazine_, and was\r\nsetting to work again upon the scenario of the play I had commenced at\r\nLympne before I realised that the end was not yet. And then, following\r\nme from Amalfi to Algiers, there reached me (it is now about six months\r\nago) one of the most astounding communications I have ever been fated\r\nto receive. Briefly, it informed me that Mr. Julius Wendigee, a Dutch\r\nelectrician, who has been experimenting with certain apparatus akin to\r\nthe apparatus used by Mr. Tesla in America, in the hope of discovering\r\nsome method of communication with Mars, was receiving day by day a\r\ncuriously fragmentary message in English, which was indisputably\r\nemanating from Mr. Cavor in the moon.\r\n\r\nAt first I thought the thing was an elaborate practical joke by some\r\none who had seen the manuscript of my narrative. I answered Mr.\r\nWendigee jestingly, but he replied in a manner that put such suspicion\r\naltogether aside, and in a state of inconceivable excitement I hurried\r\nfrom Algiers to the little observatory upon the Monte Rosa in which he\r\nwas working. In the presence of his record and his appliances—and above\r\nall of the messages from Cavor that were coming to hand—my lingering\r\ndoubts vanished. I decided at once to accept a proposal he made to me\r\nto remain with him, assisting him to take down the record from day to\r\nday, and endeavouring with him to send a message back to the moon.\r\nCavor, we learnt, was not only alive, but free, in the midst of an\r\nalmost inconceivable community of these ant-like beings, these ant-men,\r\nin the blue darkness of the lunar caves. He was lamed, it seemed, but\r\notherwise in quite good health—in better health, he distinctly said,\r\nthan he usually enjoyed on earth. He had had a fever, but it had left\r\nno bad effects. But curiously enough he seemed to be labouring under a\r\nconviction that I was either dead in the moon crater or lost in the\r\ndeep of space.\r\n\r\nHis message began to be received by Mr. Wendigee when that gentleman\r\nwas engaged in quite a different investigation. The reader will no\r\ndoubt recall the little excitement that began the century, arising out\r\nof an announcement by Mr. Nikola Tesla, the American electrical\r\ncelebrity, that he had received a message from Mars. His announcement\r\nrenewed attention to a fact that had long been familiar to scientific\r\npeople, namely: that from some unknown source in space, waves of\r\nelectromagnetic disturbance, entirely similar to those used by Signor\r\nMarconi for his wireless telegraphy, are constantly reaching the earth.\r\nBesides Tesla quite a number of other observers have been engaged in\r\nperfecting apparatus for receiving and recording these vibrations,\r\nthough few would go so far as to consider them actual messages from\r\nsome extraterrestrial sender. Among that few, however, we must\r\ncertainly count Mr. Wendigee. Ever since 1898 he had devoted himself\r\nalmost entirely to this subject, and being a man of ample means he had\r\nerected an observatory on the flanks of Monte Rosa, in a position\r\nsingularly adapted in every way for such observations.\r\n\r\nMy scientific attainments, I must admit, are not great, but so far as\r\nthey enable me to judge, Mr. Wendigee’s contrivances for detecting and\r\nrecording any disturbances in the electromagnetic conditions of space\r\nare singularly original and ingenious. And by a happy combination of\r\ncircumstances they were set up and in operation about two months before\r\nCavor made his first attempt to call up the earth. Consequently we have\r\nfragments of his communication even from the beginning. Unhappily, they\r\nare only fragments, and the most momentous of all the things that he\r\nhad to tell humanity—the instructions, that is, for the making of\r\nCavorite, if, indeed, he ever transmitted them—have throbbed themselves\r\naway unrecorded into space. We never succeeded in getting a response\r\nback to Cavor. He was unable to tell, therefore, what we had received\r\nor what we had missed; nor, indeed, did he certainly know that any one\r\non earth was really aware of his efforts to reach us. And the\r\npersistence he displayed in sending eighteen long descriptions of lunar\r\naffairs—as they would be if we had them complete—shows how much his\r\nmind must have turned back towards his native planet since he left it\r\ntwo years ago.\r\n\r\nYou can imagine how amazed Mr. Wendigee must have been when he\r\ndiscovered his record of electromagnetic disturbances interlaced by\r\nCavor’s straightforward English. Mr. Wendigee knew nothing of our wild\r\njourney moonward, and suddenly—this English out of the void!\r\n\r\nIt is well the reader should understand the conditions under which it\r\nwould seem these messages were sent. Somewhere within the moon Cavor\r\ncertainly had access for a time to a considerable amount of electrical\r\napparatus, and it would seem he rigged up—perhaps furtively—a\r\ntransmitting arrangement of the Marconi type. This he was able to\r\noperate at irregular intervals: sometimes for only half an hour or so,\r\nsometimes for three or four hours at a stretch. At these times he\r\ntransmitted his earthward message, regardless of the fact that the\r\nrelative position of the moon and points upon the earth’s surface is\r\nconstantly altering. As a consequence of this and of the necessary\r\nimperfections of our recording instruments his communication comes and\r\ngoes in our records in an extremely fitful manner; it becomes blurred;\r\nit “fades out” in a mysterious and altogether exasperating way. And\r\nadded to this is the fact that he was not an expert operator; he had\r\npartly forgotten, or never completely mastered, the code in general\r\nuse, and as he became fatigued he dropped words and misspelt in a\r\ncurious manner.\r\n\r\nAltogether we have probably lost quite half of the communications he\r\nmade, and much we have is damaged, broken, and partly effaced. In the\r\nabstract that follows the reader must be prepared therefore for a\r\nconsiderable amount of break, hiatus, and change of topic. Mr. Wendigee\r\nand I are collaborating in a complete and annotated edition of the\r\nCavor record, which we hope to publish, together with a detailed\r\naccount of the instruments employed, beginning with the first volume in\r\nJanuary next. That will be the full and scientific report, of which\r\nthis is only the popular transcript. But here we give at least\r\nsufficient to complete the story I have told, and to give the broad\r\noutlines of the state of that other world so near, so akin, and yet so\r\ndissimilar to our own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII.\r\nAn Abstract of the Six Messages First Received from Mr. Cavor\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two earlier messages of Mr. Cavor may very well be reserved for\r\nthat larger volume. They simply tell, with greater brevity and with a\r\ndifference in several details that is interesting, but not of any vital\r\nimportance, the bare facts of the making of the sphere and our\r\ndeparture from the world. Throughout, Cavor speaks of me as a man who\r\nis dead, but with a curious change of temper as he approaches our\r\nlanding on the moon. “Poor Bedford,” he says of me, and “this poor\r\nyoung man,” and he blames himself for inducing a young man, “by no\r\nmeans well equipped for such adventures,” to leave a planet “on which\r\nhe was indisputably fitted to succeed” on so precarious a mission. I\r\nthink he underrates the part my energy and practical capacity played in\r\nbringing about the realisation of his theoretical sphere. “We arrived,”\r\nhe says, with no more account of our passage through space than if we\r\nhad made a journey of common occurrence in a railway train.\r\n\r\nAnd then he becomes increasingly unfair to me. Unfair, indeed, to an\r\nextent I should not have expected in a man trained in the search for\r\ntruth. Looking back over my previously written account of these things,\r\nI must insist that I have been altogether juster to Cavor than he has\r\nbeen to me. I have extenuated little and suppressed nothing. But his\r\naccount is:—\r\n\r\n“It speedily became apparent that the entire strangeness of our\r\ncircumstances and surroundings—great loss of weight, attenuated but\r\nhighly oxygenated air, consequent exaggeration of the results of\r\nmuscular effort, rapid development of weird plants from obscure spores,\r\nlurid sky—was exciting my companion unduly. On the moon his character\r\nseemed to deteriorate. He became impulsive, rash, and quarrelsome. In a\r\nlittle while his folly in devouring some gigantic vesicles and his\r\nconsequent intoxication led to our capture by the Selenites—before we\r\nhad had the slightest opportunity of properly observing their ways....”\r\n\r\n(He says, you observe, nothing of his own concession to these same\r\n“vesicles.”)\r\n\r\nAnd he goes on from that point to say that “We came to a difficult\r\npassage with them, and Bedford mistaking certain gestures of\r\ntheirs”—pretty gestures they were!—“gave way to a panic violence. He\r\nran amuck, killed three, and perforce I had to flee with him after the\r\noutrage. Subsequently we fought with a number who endeavoured to bar\r\nour way, and slew seven or eight more. It says much for the tolerance\r\nof these beings that on my recapture I was not instantly slain. We made\r\nour way to the exterior and separated in the crater of our arrival, to\r\nincrease our chances of recovering our sphere. But presently I came\r\nupon a body of Selenites, led by two who were curiously different, even\r\nin form, from any of these we had seen hitherto, with larger heads and\r\nsmaller bodies, and much more elaborately wrapped about. And after\r\nevading them for some time I fell into a crevasse, cut my head rather\r\nbadly, and displaced my patella, and, finding crawling very painful,\r\ndecided to surrender—if they would still permit me to do so. This they\r\ndid, and, perceiving my helpless condition, carried me with them again\r\ninto the moon. And of Bedford I have heard or seen nothing more, nor,\r\nso far as I can gather, has any Selenite. Either the night overtook him\r\nin the crater, or else, which is more probable, he found the sphere,\r\nand, desiring to steal a march upon me, made off with it—only, I fear,\r\nto find it uncontrollable, and to meet a more lingering fate in outer\r\nspace.”\r\n\r\nAnd with that Cavor dismisses me and goes on to more interesting\r\ntopics. I dislike the idea of seeming to use my position as his editor\r\nto deflect his story in my own interest, but I am obliged to protest\r\nhere against the turn he gives these occurrences. He said nothing about\r\nthat gasping message on the blood-stained paper in which he told, or\r\nattempted to tell, a very different story. The dignified self-surrender\r\nis an altogether new view of the affair that has come to him, I must\r\ninsist, since he began to feel secure among the lunar people; and as\r\nfor the “stealing a march” conception, I am quite willing to let the\r\nreader decide between us on what he has before him. I know I am not a\r\nmodel man—I have made no pretence to be. But am I _that?_\r\n\r\nHowever, that is the sum of my wrongs. From this point I can edit Cavor\r\nwith an untroubled mind, for he mentions me no more.\r\n\r\nIt would seem the Selenites who had come upon him carried him to some\r\npoint in the interior down “a great shaft” by means of what he\r\ndescribes as “a sort of balloon.” We gather from the rather confused\r\npassage in which he describes this, and from a number of chance\r\nallusions and hints in other and subsequent messages, that this “great\r\nshaft” is one of an enormous system of artificial shafts that run, each\r\nfrom what is called a lunar “crater,” downwards for very nearly a\r\nhundred miles towards the central portion of our satellite. These\r\nshafts communicate by transverse tunnels, they throw out abysmal\r\ncaverns and expand into great globular places; the whole of the moon’s\r\nsubstance for a hundred miles inward, indeed, is a mere sponge of rock.\r\n“Partly,” says Cavor, “this sponginess is natural, but very largely it\r\nis due to the enormous industry of the Selenites in the past. The\r\nenormous circular mounds of the excavated rock and earth it is that\r\nform these great circles about the tunnels known to earthly astronomers\r\n(misled by a false analogy) as volcanoes.”\r\n\r\nIt was down this shaft they took him, in this “sort of balloon” he\r\nspeaks of, at first into an inky blackness and then into a region of\r\ncontinually increasing phosphorescence. Cavor’s despatches show him to\r\nbe curiously regardless of detail for a scientific man, but we gather\r\nthat this light was due to the streams and cascades of water—“no doubt\r\ncontaining some phosphorescent organism”—that flowed ever more\r\nabundantly downward towards the Central Sea. And as he descended, he\r\nsays, “The Selenites also became luminous.” And at last far below him\r\nhe saw, as it were, a lake of heatless fire, the waters of the Central\r\nSea, glowing and eddying in strange perturbation, “like luminous blue\r\nmilk that is just on the boil.”\r\n\r\n“This Lunar Sea,” says Cavor, in a later passage, “is not a stagnant\r\nocean; a solar tide sends it in a perpetual flow around the lunar axis,\r\nand strange storms and boilings and rushings of its waters occur, and\r\nat times cold winds and thunderings that ascend out of it into the busy\r\nways of the great ant-hill above. It is only when the water is in\r\nmotion that it gives out light; in its rare seasons of calm it is\r\nblack. Commonly, when one sees it, its waters rise and fall in an oily\r\nswell, and flakes and big rafts of shining, bubbly foam drift with the\r\nsluggish, faintly glowing current. The Selenites navigate its cavernous\r\nstraits and lagoons in little shallow boats of a canoe-like shape; and\r\neven before my journey to the galleries about the Grand Lunar, who is\r\nMaster of the Moon, I was permitted to make a brief excursion on its\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\n“The caverns and passages are naturally very tortuous. A large\r\nproportion of these ways are known only to expert pilots among the\r\nfishermen, and not infrequently Selenites are lost for ever in their\r\nlabyrinths. In their remoter recesses, I am told, strange creatures\r\nlurk, some of them terrible and dangerous creatures that all the\r\nscience of the moon has been unable to exterminate. There is\r\nparticularly the Rapha, an inextricable mass of clutching tentacles\r\nthat one hacks to pieces only to multiply; and the Tzee, a darting\r\ncreature that is never seen, so subtly and suddenly does it slay...”\r\n\r\nHe gives us a gleam of description.\r\n\r\n“I was reminded on this excursion of what I have read of the Mammoth\r\nCaves; if only I had had a yellow flambeau instead of the pervading\r\nblue light, and a solid-looking boatman with an oar instead of a\r\nscuttle-faced Selenite working an engine at the back of the canoe, I\r\ncould have imagined I had suddenly got back to earth. The rocks about\r\nus were very various, sometimes black, sometimes pale blue and veined,\r\nand once they flashed and glittered as though we had come into a mine\r\nof sapphires. And below one saw the ghostly phosphorescent fishes flash\r\nand vanish in the hardly less phosphorescent deep. Then, presently, a\r\nlong ultra-marine vista down the turgid stream of one of the channels\r\nof traffic, and a landing stage, and then, perhaps, a glimpse up the\r\nenormous crowded shaft of one of the vertical ways.\r\n\r\n“In one great place heavy with glistening stalactites a number of boats\r\nwere fishing. We went alongside one of these and watched the long-armed\r\nSelenites winding in a net. They were little, hunchbacked insects, with\r\nvery strong arms, short, bandy legs, and crinkled face-masks. As they\r\npulled at it that net seemed the heaviest thing I had come upon in the\r\nmoon; it was loaded with weights—no doubt of gold—and it took a long\r\ntime to draw, for in those waters the larger and more edible fish lurk\r\ndeep. The fish in the net came up like a blue moonrise—a blaze of\r\ndarting, tossing blue.\r\n\r\n“Among their catch was a many-tentaculate, evil-eyed black thing,\r\nferociously active, whose appearance they greeted with shrieks and\r\ntwitters, and which with quick, nervous movements they hacked to pieces\r\nby means of little hatchets. All its dissevered limbs continued to lash\r\nand writhe in a vicious manner. Afterwards, when fever had hold of me,\r\nI dreamt again and again of that bitter, furious creature rising so\r\nvigorous and active out of the unknown sea. It was the most active and\r\nmalignant thing of all the living creatures I have yet seen in this\r\nworld inside the moon....\r\n\r\n“The surface of this sea must be very nearly two hundred miles (if not\r\nmore) below the level of the moon’s exterior; all the cities of the\r\nmoon lie, I learnt, immediately above this Central Sea, in such\r\ncavernous spaces and artificial galleries as I have described, and they\r\ncommunicate with the exterior by enormous vertical shafts which open\r\ninvariably in what are called by earthly astronomers the ‘craters’ of\r\nthe moon. The lid covering one such aperture I had already seen during\r\nthe wanderings that had preceded my capture.\r\n\r\n“Upon the condition of the less central portion of the moon I have not\r\nyet arrived at very precise knowledge. There is an enormous system of\r\ncaverns in which the mooncalves shelter during the night; and there are\r\nabattoirs and the like—in one of these it was that I and Bedford fought\r\nwith the Selenite butchers—and I have since seen balloons laden with\r\nmeat descending out of the upper dark. I have as yet scarcely learnt as\r\nmuch of these things as a Zulu in London would learn about the British\r\ncorn supplies in the same time. It is clear, however, that these\r\nvertical shafts and the vegetation of the surface must play an\r\nessential role in ventilating and keeping fresh the atmosphere of the\r\nmoon. At one time, and particularly on my first emergence from my\r\nprison, there was certainly a cold wind blowing _down_ the shaft, and\r\nlater there was a kind of sirocco upward that corresponded with my\r\nfever. For at the end of about three weeks I fell ill of an indefinable\r\nsort of fever, and in spite of sleep and the quinine tabloids that very\r\nfortunately I had brought in my pocket, I remained ill and fretting\r\nmiserably, almost to the time when I was taken into the presence of the\r\nGrand Lunar, who is Master of the Moon.\r\n\r\n“I will not dilate on the wretchedness of my condition,” he remarks,\r\n“during those days of ill-health.” And he goes on with great amplitude\r\nwith details I omit here. “My temperature,” he concludes, “kept\r\nabnormally high for a long time, and I lost all desire for food. I had\r\nstagnant waking intervals, and sleep tormented by dreams, and at one\r\nphase I was, I remember, so weak as to be earth-sick and almost\r\nhysterical. I longed almost intolerably for colour to break the\r\neverlasting blue...”\r\n\r\nHe reverts again presently to the topic of this sponge-caught lunar\r\natmosphere. I am told by astronomers and physicists that all he tells\r\nis in absolute accordance with what was already known of the moon’s\r\ncondition. Had earthly astronomers had the courage and imagination to\r\npush home a bold induction, says Mr. Wendigee, they might have foretold\r\nalmost everything that Cavor has to say of the general structure of the\r\nmoon. They know now pretty certainly that moon and earth are not so\r\nmuch satellite and primary as smaller and greater sisters, made out of\r\none mass, and consequently made of the same material. And since the\r\ndensity of the moon is only three-fifths that of the earth, there can\r\nbe nothing for it but that she is hollowed out by a great system of\r\ncaverns. There was no necessity, said Sir Jabez Flap, F.R.S., that most\r\nentertaining exponent of the facetious side of the stars, that we\r\nshould ever have gone to the moon to find out such easy inferences, and\r\npoints the pun with an allusion to Gruyère, but he certainly might have\r\nannounced his knowledge of the hollowness of the moon before. And if\r\nthe moon is hollow, then the apparent absence of air and water is, of\r\ncourse, quite easily explained. The sea lies within at the bottom of\r\nthe caverns, and the air travels through the great sponge of galleries,\r\nin accordance with simple physical laws. The caverns of the moon, on\r\nthe whole, are very windy places. As the sunlight comes round the moon\r\nthe air in the outer galleries on that side is heated, its pressure\r\nincreases, some flows out on the exterior and mingles with the\r\nevaporating air of the craters (where the plants remove its carbonic\r\nacid), while the greater portion flows round through the galleries to\r\nreplace the shrinking air of the cooling side that the sunlight has\r\nleft. There is, therefore, a constant eastward breeze in the air of the\r\nouter galleries, and an upflow during the lunar day up the shafts,\r\ncomplicated, of course, very greatly by the varying shape of the\r\ngalleries, and the ingenious contrivances of the Selenite mind....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV.\r\nThe Natural History of the Selenites\r\n\r\n\r\nThe messages of Cavor from the sixth up to the sixteenth are for the\r\nmost part so much broken, and they abound so in repetitions, that they\r\nscarcely form a consecutive narrative. They will be given in full, of\r\ncourse, in the scientific report, but here it will be far more\r\nconvenient to continue simply to abstract and quote as in the former\r\nchapter. We have subjected every word to a keen critical scrutiny, and\r\nmy own brief memories and impressions of lunar things have been of\r\ninestimable help in interpreting what would otherwise have been\r\nimpenetrably dark. And, naturally, as living beings, our interest\r\ncentres far more upon the strange community of lunar insects in which\r\nhe was living, it would seem, as an honoured guest than upon the mere\r\nphysical condition of their world.\r\n\r\nI have already made it clear, I think, that the Selenites I saw\r\nresembled man in maintaining the erect attitude, and in having four\r\nlimbs, and I have compared the general appearance of their heads and\r\nthe jointing of their limbs to that of insects. I have mentioned, too,\r\nthe peculiar consequence of the smaller gravitation of the moon on\r\ntheir fragile slightness. Cavor confirms me upon all these points. He\r\ncalls them “animals,” though of course they fall under no division of\r\nthe classification of earthly creatures, and he points out “the insect\r\ntype of anatomy had, fortunately for men, never exceeded a relatively\r\nvery small size on earth.” The largest terrestrial insects, living or\r\nextinct, do not, as a matter of fact, measure six inches in length;\r\n“but here, against the lesser gravitation of the moon, a creature\r\ncertainly as much an insect as vertebrate seems to have been able to\r\nattain to human and ultra-human dimensions.”\r\n\r\nHe does not mention the ant, but throughout his allusions the ant is\r\ncontinually being brought before my mind, in its sleepless activity, in\r\nits intelligence and social organisation, in its structure, and more\r\nparticularly in the fact that it displays, in addition to the two\r\nforms, the male and the female form, that almost all other animals\r\npossess, a number of other sexless creatures, workers, soldiers, and\r\nthe like, differing from one another in structure, character, power,\r\nand use, and yet all members of the same species. For these Selenites,\r\nalso, have a great variety of forms. Of course, they are not only\r\ncolossally greater in size than ants, but also, in Cavor’s opinion at\r\nleast, in intelligence, morality, and social wisdom are they colossally\r\ngreater than men. And instead of the four or five different forms of\r\nant that are found, there are almost innumerably different forms of\r\nSelenite. I had endeavoured to indicate the very considerable\r\ndifference observable in such Selenites of the outer crust as I\r\nhappened to encounter; the differences in size and proportions were\r\ncertainly as wide as the differences between the most widely separated\r\nraces of men. But such differences as I saw fade absolutely to nothing\r\nin comparison with the huge distinctions of which Cavor tells. It would\r\nseem the exterior Selenites I saw were, indeed, mostly engaged in\r\nkindred occupations—mooncalf herds, butchers, fleshers, and the like.\r\nBut within the moon, practically unsuspected by me, there are, it\r\nseems, a number of other sorts of Selenite, differing in size,\r\ndiffering in the relative size of part to part, differing in power and\r\nappearance, and yet not different species of creatures, but only\r\ndifferent forms of one species, and retaining through all their\r\nvariations a certain common likeness that marks their specific unity.\r\nThe moon is, indeed, a sort of vast ant-hill, only, instead of there\r\nbeing only four or five sorts of ant, there are many hundred different\r\nsorts of Selenite, and almost every gradation between one sort and\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nIt would seem the discovery came upon Cavor very speedily. I infer\r\nrather than learn from his narrative that he was captured by the\r\nmooncalf herds under the direction of these other Selenites who “have\r\nlarger brain cases (heads?) and very much shorter legs.” Finding he\r\nwould not walk even under the goad, they carried him into darkness,\r\ncrossed a narrow, plank-like bridge that may have been the identical\r\nbridge I had refused, and put him down in something that must have\r\nseemed at first to be some sort of lift. This was the balloon—it had\r\ncertainly been absolutely invisible to us in the darkness—and what had\r\nseemed to me a mere plank-walking into the void was really, no doubt,\r\nthe passage of the gangway. In this he descended towards constantly\r\nmore luminous caverns of the moon. At first they descended in\r\nsilence—save for the twitterings of the Selenites—and then into a stir\r\nof windy movement. In a little while the profound blackness had made\r\nhis eyes so sensitive that he began to see more and more of the things\r\nabout him, and at last the vague took shape.\r\n\r\n“Conceive an enormous cylindrical space,” says Cavor, in his seventh\r\nmessage, “a quarter of a mile across, perhaps; very dimly lit at first\r\nand then brighter, with big platforms twisting down its sides in a\r\nspiral that vanishes at last below in a blue profundity; and lit even\r\nmore brightly—one could not tell how or why. Think of the well of the\r\nvery largest spiral staircase or lift-shaft that you have ever looked\r\ndown, and magnify that by a hundred. Imagine it at twilight seen\r\nthrough blue glass. Imagine yourself looking down that; only imagine\r\nalso that you feel extraordinarily light, and have got rid of any giddy\r\nfeeling you might have on earth, and you will have the first conditions\r\nof my impression. Round this enormous shaft imagine a broad gallery\r\nrunning in a much steeper spiral than would be credible on earth, and\r\nforming a steep road protected from the gulf only by a little parapet\r\nthat vanishes at last in perspective a couple of miles below.\r\n\r\n“Looking up, I saw the very fellow of the downward vision; it had, of\r\ncourse, the effect of looking into a very steep cone. A wind was\r\nblowing down the shaft, and far above I fancy I heard, growing fainter\r\nand fainter, the bellowing of the mooncalves that were being driven\r\ndown again from their evening pasturage on the exterior. And up and\r\ndown the spiral galleries were scattered numerous moon people, pallid,\r\nfaintly luminous beings, regarding our appearance or busied on unknown\r\nerrands.\r\n\r\n“Either I fancied it or a flake of snow came drifting down on the icy\r\nbreeze. And then, falling like a snowflake, a little figure, a little\r\nman-insect, clinging to a parachute, drove down very swiftly towards\r\nthe central places of the moon.\r\n\r\n“The big-headed Selenite sitting beside me, seeing me move my head with\r\nthe gesture of one who saw, pointed with his trunk-like ‘hand’ and\r\nindicated a sort of jetty coming into sight very far below: a little\r\nlanding-stage, as it were, hanging into the void. As it swept up\r\ntowards us our pace diminished very rapidly, and in a few moments, as\r\nit seemed, we were abreast of it, and at rest. A mooring-rope was flung\r\nand grasped, and I found myself pulled down to a level with a great\r\ncrowd of Selenites, who jostled to see me.\r\n\r\n“It was an incredible crowd. Suddenly and violently there was forced\r\nupon my attention the vast amount of difference there is amongst these\r\nbeings of the moon.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, there seemed not two alike in all that jostling multitude.\r\nThey differed in shape, they differed in size, they rang all the\r\nhorrible changes on the theme of Selenite form! Some bulged and\r\noverhung, some ran about among the feet of their fellows. All of them\r\nhad a grotesque and disquieting suggestion of an insect that has\r\nsomehow contrived to mock humanity; but all seemed to present an\r\nincredible exaggeration of some particular feature: one had a vast\r\nright fore-limb, an enormous antennal arm, as it were; one seemed all\r\nleg, poised, as it were, on stilts; another protruded the edge of his\r\nface mask into a nose-like organ that made him startlingly human until\r\none saw his expressionless gaping mouth. The strange and (except for\r\nthe want of mandibles and palps) most insect-like head of the\r\nmooncalf-minders underwent, indeed, the most incredible\r\ntransformations: here it was broad and low, here high and narrow; here\r\nits leathery brow was drawn out into horns and strange features; here\r\nit was whiskered and divided, and there with a grotesquely human\r\nprofile. One distortion was particularly conspicuous. There were\r\nseveral brain cases distended like bladders to a huge size, with the\r\nface mask reduced to quite small proportions. There were several\r\namazing forms, with heads reduced to microscopic proportions and blobby\r\nbodies; and fantastic, flimsy things that existed, it would seem, only\r\nas a basis for vast, trumpet-like protrusions of the lower part of the\r\nmask. And oddest of all, as it seemed to me for the moment, two or\r\nthree of these weird inhabitants of a subterranean world, a world\r\nsheltered by innumerable miles of rock from sun or rain, _carried\r\numbrellas_ in their tentaculate hands—real terrestrial looking\r\numbrellas! And then I thought of the parachutist I had watched descend.\r\n\r\n“These moon people behaved exactly as a human crowd might have done in\r\nsimilar circumstances: they jostled and thrust one another, they shoved\r\none another aside, they even clambered upon one another to get a\r\nglimpse of me. Every moment they increased in numbers, and pressed more\r\nurgently upon the discs of my ushers”—Cavor does not explain what he\r\nmeans by this—“every moment fresh shapes emerged from the shadows and\r\nforced themselves upon my astounded attention. And presently I was\r\nsigned and helped into a sort of litter, and lifted up on the shoulders\r\nof strong-armed bearers, and so borne through the twilight over this\r\nseething multitude towards the apartments that were provided for me in\r\nthe moon. All about me were eyes, faces, masks, a leathery noise like\r\nthe rustling of beetle wings, and a great bleating and cricket-like\r\ntwittering of Selenite voices.”\r\n\r\nWe gather he was taken to a “hexagonal apartment,” and there for a\r\nspace he was confined. Afterwards he was given a much more considerable\r\nliberty; indeed, almost as much freedom as one has in a civilised town\r\non earth. And it would appear that the mysterious being who is the\r\nruler and master of the moon appointed two Selenites “with large heads”\r\nto guard and study him, and to establish whatever mental communications\r\nwere possible with him. And, amazing and incredible as it may seem,\r\nthese two creatures, these fantastic men insects, these beings of other\r\nworld, were presently communicating with Cavor by means of terrestrial\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nCavor speaks of them as Phi-oo and Tsi-puff. Phi-oo, he says, was about\r\n5 feet high; he had small slender legs about 18 inches long, and slight\r\nfeet of the common lunar pattern. On these balanced a little body,\r\nthrobbing with the pulsations of his heart. He had long, soft,\r\nmany-jointed arms ending in a tentacled grip, and his neck was\r\nmany-jointed in the usual way, but exceptionally short and thick. His\r\nhead, says Cavor—apparently alluding to some previous description that\r\nhas gone astray in space—“is of the common lunar type, but strangely\r\nmodified. The mouth has the usual expressionless gape, but it is\r\nunusually small and pointing downward, and the mask is reduced to the\r\nsize of a large flat nose-flap. On either side are the little eyes.\r\n\r\n“The rest of the head is distended into a huge globe and the chitinous\r\nleathery cuticle of the mooncalf herds thins out to a mere membrane,\r\nthrough which the pulsating brain movements are distinctly visible. He\r\nis a creature, indeed, with a tremendously hypertrophied brain, and\r\nwith the rest of his organism both relatively and absolutely dwarfed.”\r\n\r\nIn another passage Cavor compares the back view of him to Atlas\r\nsupporting the world. Tsi-puff it seems was a very similar insect, but\r\nhis “face” was drawn out to a considerable length, and the brain\r\nhypertrophy being in different regions, his head was not round but\r\npear-shaped, with the stalk downward. There were also litter-carriers,\r\nlopsided beings, with enormous shoulders, very spidery ushers, and a\r\nsquat foot attendant in Cavor’s retinue.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which Phi-oo and Tsi-puff attacked the problem of speech\r\nwas fairly obvious. They came into this “hexagonal cell” in which Cavor\r\nwas confined, and began imitating every sound he made, beginning with a\r\ncough. He seems to have grasped their intention with great quickness,\r\nand to have begun repeating words to them and pointing to indicate the\r\napplication. The procedure was probably always the same. Phi-oo would\r\nattend to Cavor for a space, then point also and say the word he had\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nThe first word he mastered was “man,” and the second “Mooney”—which\r\nCavor on the spur of the moment seems to have used instead of\r\n“Selenite” for the moon race. As soon as Phi-oo was assured of the\r\nmeaning of a word he repeated it to Tsi-puff, who remembered it\r\ninfallibly. They mastered over one hundred English nouns at their first\r\nsession.\r\n\r\nSubsequently it seems they brought an artist with them to assist the\r\nwork of explanation with sketches and diagrams—Cavor’s drawings being\r\nrather crude. “He was,” says Cavor, “a being with an active arm and an\r\narresting eye,” and he seemed to draw with incredible swiftness.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh message is undoubtedly only a fragment of a longer\r\ncommunication. After some broken sentences, the record of which is\r\nunintelligible, it goes on:—\r\n\r\n“But it will interest only linguists, and delay me too long, to give\r\nthe details of the series of intent parleys of which these were the\r\nbeginning, and, indeed, I very much doubt if I could give in anything\r\nlike the proper order all the twistings and turnings that we made in\r\nour pursuit of mutual comprehension. Verbs were soon plain sailing—at\r\nleast, such active verbs as I could express by drawings; some\r\nadjectives were easy, but when it came to abstract nouns, to\r\nprepositions, and the sort of hackneyed figures of speech, by means of\r\nwhich so much is expressed on earth, it was like diving in\r\ncork-jackets. Indeed, these difficulties were insurmountable until to\r\nthe sixth lesson came a fourth assistant, a being with a huge\r\nfootball-shaped head, whose _forte_ was clearly the pursuit of\r\nintricate analogy. He entered in a preoccupied manner, stumbling\r\nagainst a stool, and the difficulties that arose had to be presented to\r\nhim with a certain amount of clamour and hitting and pricking before\r\nthey reached his apprehension. But once he was involved his penetration\r\nwas amazing. Whenever there came a need of thinking beyond Phi-oo’s by\r\nno means limited scope, this prolate-headed person was in request, but\r\nhe invariably told the conclusion to Tsi-puff, in order that it might\r\nbe remembered; Tsi-puff was ever the arsenal for facts. And so we\r\nadvanced again.\r\n\r\n“It seemed long and yet brief—a matter of days—before I was positively\r\ntalking with these insects of the moon. Of course, at first it was an\r\nintercourse infinitely tedious and exasperating, but imperceptibly it\r\nhas grown to comprehension. And my patience has grown to meet its\r\nlimitations, Phi-oo it is who does all the talking. He does it with a\r\nvast amount of meditative provisional ‘M’m—M’m’ and has caught up one\r\nor two phrases, If I may say,’ ‘If you understand,’ and beads all his\r\nspeech with them.\r\n\r\n“Thus he would discourse. Imagine him explaining his artist.\r\n\r\n“‘M’m—M’m—he—if I may say—draw. Eat little—drink little—draw. Love\r\ndraw. No other thing. Hate all who not draw like him. Angry. Hate all\r\nwho draw like him better. Hate most people. Hate all who not think all\r\nworld for to draw. Angry. M’m. All things mean nothing to him—only\r\ndraw. He like you ... if you understand.... New thing to draw.\r\nUgly—striking. Eh?\r\n\r\n“‘He’—turning to Tsi-puff—‘love remember words. Remember wonderful more\r\nthan any. Think no, draw no—remember. Say’—here he referred to his\r\ngifted assistant for a word—‘histories—all things. He hear once—say\r\never.’\r\n\r\n“It is more wonderful to me than I dreamt that anything ever could be\r\nagain, to hear, in this perpetual obscurity, these extraordinary\r\ncreatures—for even familiarity fails to weaken the inhuman effect of\r\ntheir appearance—continually piping a nearer approach to coherent\r\nearthly speech—asking questions, giving answers. I feel that I am\r\ncasting back to the fable-hearing period of childhood again, when the\r\nant and the grasshopper talked together and the bee judged between\r\nthem...”\r\n\r\nAnd while these linguistic exercises were going on Cavor seems to have\r\nexperienced a considerable relaxation of his confinement. “The first\r\ndread and distrust our unfortunate conflict aroused is being,” he said,\r\n“continually effaced by the deliberate rationality of all I do.... I am\r\nnow able to come and go as I please, or I am restricted only for my own\r\ngood. So it is I have been able to get at this apparatus, and, assisted\r\nby a happy find among the material that is littered in this enormous\r\nstore-cave, I have contrived to despatch these messages. So far not the\r\nslightest attempt has been made to interfere with me in this, though I\r\nhave made it quite clear to Phi-oo that I am signalling to the earth.\r\n\r\n“‘You talk to other?’ he asked, watching me.\r\n\r\n“‘Others,’ said I.\r\n\r\n“‘Others,’ he said. ‘Oh yes, Men?’\r\n\r\n“And I went on transmitting.”\r\n\r\nCavor was continually making corrections in his previous accounts of\r\nthe Selenites as fresh facts flowed upon him to modify his conclusions,\r\nand accordingly one gives the quotations that follow with a certain\r\namount of reservation. They are quoted from the ninth, thirteenth, and\r\nsixteenth messages, and, altogether vague and fragmentary as they are,\r\nthey probably give as complete a picture of the social life of this\r\nstrange community as mankind can now hope to have for many generations.\r\n\r\n“In the moon,” says Cavor, “every citizen knows his place. He is born\r\nto that place, and the elaborate discipline of training and education\r\nand surgery he undergoes fits him at last so completely to it that he\r\nhas neither ideas nor organs for any purpose beyond it. ‘Why should\r\nhe?’ Phi-oo would ask. If, for example, a Selenite is destined to be a\r\nmathematician, his teachers and trainers set out at once to that end.\r\nThey check any incipient disposition to other pursuits, they encourage\r\nhis mathematical bias with a perfect psychological skill. His brain\r\ngrows, or at least the mathematical faculties of his brain grow, and\r\nthe rest of him only so much as is necessary to sustain this essential\r\npart of him. At last, save for rest and food, his one delight lies in\r\nthe exercise and display of his faculty, his one interest in its\r\napplication, his sole society with other specialists in his own line.\r\nHis brain grows continually larger, at least so far as the portions\r\nengaging in mathematics are concerned; they bulge ever larger and seem\r\nto suck all life and vigour from the rest of his frame. His limbs\r\nshrivel, his heart and digestive organs diminish, his insect face is\r\nhidden under its bulging contours. His voice becomes a mere\r\nstridulation for the stating of formulæ; he seems deaf to all but\r\nproperly enunciated problems. The faculty of laughter, save for the\r\nsudden discovery of some paradox, is lost to him; his deepest emotion\r\nis the evolution of a novel computation. And so he attains his end.\r\n\r\n“Or, again, a Selenite appointed to be a minder of mooncalves is from\r\nhis earliest years induced to think and live mooncalf, to find his\r\npleasure in mooncalf lore, his exercise in their tending and pursuit.\r\nHe is trained to become wiry and active, his eye is indurated to the\r\ntight wrappings, the angular contours that constitute a ‘smart\r\nmooncalfishness.’ He takes at last no interest in the deeper part of\r\nthe moon; he regards all Selenites not equally versed in mooncalves\r\nwith indifference, derision, or hostility. His thoughts are of mooncalf\r\npastures, and his dialect an accomplished mooncalf technique. So also\r\nhe loves his work, and discharges in perfect happiness the duty that\r\njustifies his being. And so it is with all sorts and conditions of\r\nSelenites—each is a perfect unit in a world machine....\r\n\r\n“These beings with big heads, on whom the intellectual labours fall,\r\nform a sort of aristocracy in this strange society, and at the head of\r\nthem, quintessential of the moon, is that marvellous gigantic ganglion\r\nthe Grand Lunar, into whose presence I am finally to come. The\r\nunlimited development of the minds of the intellectual class is\r\nrendered possible by the absence of any bony skull in the lunar\r\nanatomy, that strange box of bone that clamps about the developing\r\nbrain of man, imperiously insisting ‘thus far and no farther’ to all\r\nhis possibilities. They fall into three main classes differing greatly\r\nin influence and respect. There are administrators, of whom Phi-oo is\r\none, Selenites of considerable initiative and versatility, responsible\r\neach for a certain cubic content of the moon’s bulk; the experts like\r\nthe football-headed thinker, who are trained to perform certain special\r\noperations; and the erudite, who are the repositories of all knowledge.\r\nTo the latter class belongs Tsi-puff, the first lunar professor of\r\nterrestrial languages. With regard to these latter, it is a curious\r\nlittle thing to note that the unlimited growth of the lunar brain has\r\nrendered unnecessary the invention of all those mechanical aids to\r\nbrain work which have distinguished the career of man. There are no\r\nbooks, no records of any sort, no libraries or inscriptions. All\r\nknowledge is stored in distended brains much as the honey-ants of Texas\r\nstore honey in their distended abdomens. The lunar Somerset House and\r\nthe lunar British Museum Library are collections of living brains...\r\n\r\n“The less specialised administrators, I note, do for the most part take\r\na very lively interest in me whenever they encounter me. They will come\r\nout of the way and stare at me and ask questions to which Phi-oo will\r\nreply. I see them going hither and thither with a retinue of bearers,\r\nattendants, shouters, parachute-carriers, and so forth—queer groups to\r\nsee. The experts for the most part ignore me completely, even as they\r\nignore each other, or notice me only to begin a clamorous exhibition of\r\ntheir distinctive skill. The erudite for the most part are rapt in an\r\nimpervious and apoplectic complacency, from which only a denial of\r\ntheir erudition can rouse them. Usually they are led about by little\r\nwatchers and attendants, and often there are small and active-looking\r\ncreatures, small females usually, that I am inclined to think are a\r\nsort of wife to them; but some of the profounder scholars are\r\naltogether too great for locomotion, and are carried from place to\r\nplace in a sort of sedan tub, wabbling jellies of knowledge that enlist\r\nmy respectful astonishment. I have just passed one in coming to this\r\nplace where I am permitted to amuse myself with these electrical toys,\r\na vast, shaven, shaky head, bald and thin-skinned, carried on his\r\ngrotesque stretcher. In front and behind came his bearers, and curious,\r\nalmost trumpet-faced, news disseminators shrieked his fame.\r\n\r\n“I have already mentioned the retinues that accompany most of the\r\nintellectuals: ushers, bearers, valets, extraneous tentacles and\r\nmuscles, as it were, to replace the abortive physical powers of these\r\nhypertrophied minds. Porters almost invariably accompany them. There\r\nare also extremely swift messengers with spider-like legs and ‘hands’\r\nfor grasping parachutes, and attendants with vocal organs that could\r\nwell nigh wake the dead. Apart from their controlling intelligence\r\nthese subordinates are as inert and helpless as umbrellas in a stand.\r\nThey exist only in relation to the orders they have to obey, the duties\r\nthey have to perform.\r\n\r\n“The bulk of these insects, however, who go to and fro upon the spiral\r\nways, who fill the ascending balloons and drop past me clinging to\r\nflimsy parachutes are, I gather, of the operative class. ‘Machine\r\nhands,’ indeed, some of these are in actual nature—it is no figure of\r\nspeech, the single tentacle of the mooncalf herd is profoundly modified\r\nfor clawing, lifting, guiding, the rest of them no more than necessary\r\nsubordinate appendages to these important parts. Some, who I suppose\r\ndeal with bell-striking mechanisms, have enormously developed auditory\r\norgans; some whose work lies in delicate chemical operations project a\r\nvast olfactory organ; others again have flat feet for treadles with\r\nanchylosed joints; and others—who I have been told are\r\nglassblowers—seem mere lung-bellows. But every one of these common\r\nSelenites I have seen at work is exquisitely adapted to the social need\r\nit meets. Fine work is done by fined-down workers, amazingly dwarfed\r\nand neat. Some I could hold on the palm of my hand. There is even a\r\nsort of turnspit Selenite, very common, whose duty and only delight it\r\nis to apply the motive power for various small appliances. And to rule\r\nover these things and order any erring tendency there might be in some\r\naberrant natures are the most muscular beings I have seen in the moon,\r\na sort of lunar police, who must have been trained from their earliest\r\nyears to give a perfect respect and obedience to the swollen heads.\r\n\r\n“The making of these various sorts of operative must be a very curious\r\nand interesting process. I am very much in the dark about it, but quite\r\nrecently I came upon a number of young Selenites confined in jars from\r\nwhich only the fore-limbs protruded, who were being compressed to\r\nbecome machine-minders of a special sort. The extended ‘hand’ in this\r\nhighly developed system of technical education is stimulated by\r\nirritants and nourished by injection, while the rest of the body is\r\nstarved. Phi-oo, unless I misunderstood him, explained that in the\r\nearlier stages these queer little creatures are apt to display signs of\r\nsuffering in their various cramped situations, but they easily become\r\nindurated to their lot; and he took me on to where a number of\r\nflexible-minded messengers were being drawn out and broken in. It is\r\nquite unreasonable, I know, but such glimpses of the educational\r\nmethods of these beings affect me disagreeably. I hope, however, that\r\nmay pass off, and I may be able to see more of this aspect of their\r\nwonderful social order. That wretched-looking hand-tentacle sticking\r\nout of its jar seemed to have a sort of limp appeal for lost\r\npossibilities; it haunts me still, although, of course it is really in\r\nthe end a far more humane proceeding than our earthly method of leaving\r\nchildren to grow into human beings, and then making machines of them.\r\n\r\n“Quite recently, too—I think it was on the eleventh or twelfth visit I\r\nmade to this apparatus—I had a curious light upon the lives of these\r\noperatives. I was being guided through a short cut hither, instead of\r\ngoing down the spiral, and by the quays to the Central Sea. From the\r\ndevious windings of a long, dark gallery, we emerged into a vast, low\r\ncavern, pervaded by an earthy smell, and as things go in this darkness,\r\nrather brightly lit. The light came from a tumultuous growth of livid\r\nfungoid shapes—some indeed singularly like our terrestrial mushrooms,\r\nbut standing as high or higher than a man.\r\n\r\n“‘Mooneys eat these?’ said I to Phi-oo.\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, food.’\r\n\r\n“‘Goodness me!’ I cried; ‘what’s that?’\r\n\r\n“My eye had just caught the figure of an exceptionally big and ungainly\r\nSelenite lying motionless among the stems, face downward. We stopped.\r\n\r\n“‘Dead?’ I asked. (For as yet I have seen no dead in the moon, and I\r\nhave grown curious.)\r\n\r\n“‘_No!_’ exclaimed Phi-oo. ‘Him—worker—no work to do. Get little drink\r\nthen—make sleep—till we him want. What good him wake, eh? No want him\r\nwalking about.’\r\n\r\n“‘There’s another!’ cried I.\r\n\r\n“And indeed all that huge extent of mushroom ground was, I found,\r\npeppered with these prostrate figures sleeping under an opiate until\r\nthe moon had need of them. There were scores of them of all sorts, and\r\nwe were able to turn over some of them, and examine them more precisely\r\nthan I had been able to do previously. They breathed noisily at my\r\ndoing so, but did not wake. One, I remember very distinctly: he left a\r\nstrong impression, I think, because some trick of the light and of his\r\nattitude was strongly suggestive of a drawn-up human figure. His\r\nfore-limbs were long, delicate tentacles—he was some kind of refined\r\nmanipulator—and the pose of his slumber suggested a submissive\r\nsuffering. No doubt it was a mistake for me to interpret his expression\r\nin that way, but I did. And as Phi-oo rolled him over into the darkness\r\namong the livid fleshiness again I felt a distinctly unpleasant\r\nsensation, although as he rolled the insect in him was confessed.\r\n\r\n“It simply illustrates the unthinking way in which one acquires habits\r\nof feeling. To drug the worker one does not want and toss him aside is\r\nsurely far better than to expel him from his factory to wander starving\r\nin the streets. In every complicated social community there is\r\nnecessarily a certain intermittency of employment for all specialised\r\nlabour, and in this way the trouble of an ‘unemployed’ problem is\r\naltogether anticipated. And yet, so unreasonable are even\r\nscientifically trained minds, I still do not like the memory of those\r\nprostrate forms amidst those quiet, luminous arcades of fleshy growth,\r\nand I avoid that short cut in spite of the inconveniences of the\r\nlonger, more noisy, and more crowded alternative.\r\n\r\n“My alternative route takes me round by a huge, shadowy cavern, very\r\ncrowded and clamorous, and here it is I see peering out of the\r\nhexagonal openings of a sort of honeycomb wall, or parading a large\r\nopen space behind, or selecting the toys and amulets made to please\r\nthem by the dainty-tentacled jewellers who work in kennels below, the\r\nmothers of the moon world—the queen bees, as it were, of the hive. They\r\nare noble-looking beings, fantastically and sometimes quite beautifully\r\nadorned, with a proud carriage, and, save for their mouths, almost\r\nmicroscopic heads.\r\n\r\n“Of the condition of the moon sexes, marrying and giving in marriage,\r\nand of birth and so forth among the Selenites, I have as yet been able\r\nto learn very little. With the steady progress of Phi-oo in English,\r\nhowever, my ignorance will no doubt as steadily disappear. I am of\r\nopinion that, as with the ants and bees, there is a large majority of\r\nthe members in this community of the neuter sex. Of course on earth in\r\nour cities there are now many who never live that life of parentage\r\nwhich is the natural life of man. Here, as with the ants, this thing\r\nhas become a normal condition of the race, and the whole of such\r\nreplacement as is necessary falls upon this special and by no means\r\nnumerous class of matrons, the mothers of the moon-world, large and\r\nstately beings beautifully fitted to bear the larval Selenite. Unless I\r\nmisunderstand an explanation of Phi-oo’s, they are absolutely incapable\r\nof cherishing the young they bring into the moon; periods of foolish\r\nindulgence alternate with moods of aggressive violence, and as soon as\r\npossible the little creatures, who are quite soft and flabby and pale\r\ncoloured, are transferred to the charge of celibate females, women\r\n‘workers’ as it were, who in some cases possess brains of almost\r\nmasculine dimensions.”\r\n\r\nJust at this point, unhappily, this message broke off. Fragmentary and\r\ntantalising as the matter constituting this chapter is, it does\r\nnevertheless give a vague, broad impression of an altogether strange\r\nand wonderful world—a world with which our own may have to reckon we\r\nknow not how speedily. This intermittent trickle of messages, this\r\nwhispering of a record needle in the stillness of the mountain slopes,\r\nis the first warning of such a change in human conditions as mankind\r\nhas scarcely imagined heretofore. In that satellite of ours there are\r\nnew elements, new appliances, traditions, an overwhelming avalanche of\r\nnew ideas, a strange race with whom we must inevitably struggle for\r\nmastery—gold as common as iron or wood...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV.\r\nThe Grand Lunar\r\n\r\n\r\nThe penultimate message describes, with occasionally elaborate detail,\r\nthe encounter between Cavor and the Grand Lunar, who is the ruler or\r\nmaster of the moon. Cavor seems to have sent most of it without\r\ninterference, but to have been interrupted in the concluding portion.\r\nThe second came after an interval of a week.\r\n\r\nThe first message begins: “At last I am able to resume this—” it then\r\nbecomes illegible for a space, and after a time resumed in\r\nmid-sentence.\r\n\r\nThe missing words of the following sentence are probably “the crowd.”\r\nThere follows quite clearly: “grew ever denser as we drew near the\r\npalace of the Grand Lunar—if I may call a series of excavations a\r\npalace. Everywhere faces stared at me—blank, chitinous gapes and masks,\r\neyes peering over tremendous olfactory developments, eyes beneath\r\nmonstrous forehead plates; and undergrowth of smaller creatures dodged\r\nand yelped, and helmet faces poised on sinuous, long-jointed necks\r\nappeared craning over shoulders and beneath armpits. Keeping a welcome\r\nspace about me marched a cordon of stolid, scuttle-headed guards, who\r\nhad joined us on our leaving the boat in which we had come along the\r\nchannels of the Central Sea. The quick-eyed artist with the little\r\nbrain joined us also, and a thick bunch of lean porter-insects swayed\r\nand struggled under the multitude of conveniences that were considered\r\nessential to my state. I was carried in a litter during the final stage\r\nof our journey. This litter was made of some very ductile metal that\r\nlooked dark to me, meshed and woven, and with bars of paler metal, and\r\nabout me as I advanced there grouped itself a long and complicated\r\nprocession.\r\n\r\n“In front, after the manner of heralds, marched four trumpet-faced\r\ncreatures making a devastating bray; and then came squat,\r\nresolute-moving ushers before and behind, and on either hand a galaxy\r\nof learned heads, a sort of animated encyclopedia, who were, Phi-oo\r\nexplained, to stand about the Grand Lunar for purposes of reference.\r\n(Not a thing in lunar science, not a point of view or method of\r\nthinking, that these wonderful beings did not carry in their heads!)\r\nFollowed guards and porters, and then Phi-oo’s shivering brain borne\r\nalso on a litter. Then came Tsi-puff in a slightly less important\r\nlitter; then myself on a litter of greater elegance than any other, and\r\nsurrounded by my food and drink attendants. More trumpeters came next,\r\nsplitting the ear with vehement outcries, and then several big brains,\r\nspecial correspondents one might well call them, or historiographers,\r\ncharged with the task of observing and remembering every detail of this\r\nepoch-making interview. A company of attendants, bearing and dragging\r\nbanners and masses of scented fungus and curious symbols, vanished in\r\nthe darkness behind. The way was lined by ushers and officers in\r\ncaparisons that gleamed like steel, and beyond their line, so far as my\r\neyes could pierce the gloom, the heads of that enormous crowd extended.\r\n\r\n“I will own that I am still by no means indurated to the peculiar\r\neffect of the Selenite appearance, and to find myself, as it were,\r\nadrift on this broad sea of excited entomology was by no means\r\nagreeable. Just for a space I had something very like what I should\r\nimagine people mean when they speak of the ‘horrors.’ It had come to me\r\nbefore in these lunar caverns, when on occasion I have found myself\r\nweaponless and with an undefended back, amidst a crowd of these\r\nSelenites, but never quite so vividly. It is, of course, as absolutely\r\nirrational a feeling as one could well have, and I hope gradually to\r\nsubdue it. But just for a moment, as I swept forward into the welter of\r\nthe vast crowd, it was only by gripping my litter tightly and summoning\r\nall my will-power that I succeeded in avoiding an outcry or some such\r\nmanifestation. It lasted perhaps three minutes; then I had myself in\r\nhand again.\r\n\r\n“We ascended the spiral of a vertical way for some time, and then\r\npassed through a series of huge halls dome-roofed and elaborately\r\ndecorated. The approach to the Grand Lunar was certainly contrived to\r\ngive one a vivid impression of his greatness. Each cavern one entered\r\nseemed greater and more boldly arched than its predecessor. This effect\r\nof progressive size was enhanced by a thin haze of faintly\r\nphosphorescent blue incense that thickened as one advanced, and robbed\r\neven the nearer figures of clearness. I seemed to advance continually\r\nto something larger, dimmer, and less material.\r\n\r\n“I must confess that all this multitude made me feel extremely shabby\r\nand unworthy. I was unshaven and unkempt; I had brought no razor; I had\r\na coarse beard over my mouth. On earth I have always been inclined to\r\ndespise any attention to my person beyond a proper care for\r\ncleanliness; but under the exceptional circumstances in which I found\r\nmyself, representing, as I did, my planet and my kind, and depending\r\nvery largely upon the attractiveness of my appearance for a proper\r\nreception, I could have given much for something a little more artistic\r\nand dignified than the husks I wore. I had been so serene in the belief\r\nthat the moon was uninhabited as to overlook such precautions\r\naltogether. As it was I was dressed in a flannel jacket,\r\nknickerbockers, and golfing stockings, stained with every sort of dirt\r\nthe moon offered, slippers (of which the left heel was wanting), and a\r\nblanket, through a hole in which I thrust my head. (These clothes,\r\nindeed, I still wear.) Sharp bristles are anything but an improvement\r\nto my cast of features, and there was an unmended tear at the knee of\r\nmy knickerbockers that showed conspicuously as I squatted in my litter;\r\nmy right stocking, too, persisted in getting about my ankle. I am fully\r\nalive to the injustice my appearance did humanity, and if by any\r\nexpedient I could have improvised something a little out of the way and\r\nimposing I would have done so. But I could hit upon nothing. I did what\r\nI could with my blanket—folding it somewhat after the fashion of a\r\ntoga, and for the rest I sat as upright as the swaying of my litter\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\n“Imagine the largest hall you have ever been in, imperfectly lit with\r\nblue light and obscured by a grey-blue fog, surging with metallic or\r\nlivid-grey creatures of such a mad diversity as I have hinted. Imagine\r\nthis hall to end in an open archway beyond which is a still larger\r\nhall, and beyond this yet another and still larger one, and so on. At\r\nthe end of the vista, dimly seen, a flight of steps, like the steps of\r\nAra Coeli at Rome, ascend out of sight. Higher and higher these steps\r\nappear to go as one draws nearer their base. But at last I came under a\r\nhuge archway and beheld the summit of these steps, and upon it the\r\nGrand Lunar exalted on his throne.\r\n\r\n“He was seated in what was relatively a blaze of incandescent blue.\r\nThis, and the darkness about him gave him an effect of floating in a\r\nblue-black void. He seemed a small, self-luminous cloud at first,\r\nbrooding on his sombre throne; his brain case must have measured many\r\nyards in diameter. For some reason that I cannot fathom a number of\r\nblue search-lights radiated from behind the throne on which he sat, and\r\nimmediately encircling him was a halo. About him, and little and\r\nindistinct in this glow, a number of body-servants sustained and\r\nsupported him, and overshadowed and standing in a huge semicircle\r\nbeneath him were his intellectual subordinates, his remembrancers and\r\ncomputators and searchers and servants, and all the distinguished\r\ninsects of the court of the moon. Still lower stood ushers and\r\nmessengers, and then all down the countless steps of the throne were\r\nguards, and at the base, enormous, various, indistinct, vanishing at\r\nlast into an absolute black, a vast swaying multitude of the minor\r\ndignitaries of the moon. Their feet made a perpetual scraping whisper\r\non the rocky floor, as their limbs moved with a rustling murmur.\r\n\r\n“As I entered the penultimate hall the music rose and expanded into an\r\nimperial magnificence of sound, and the shrieks of the news-bearers\r\ndied away....\r\n\r\n“I entered the last and greatest hall....\r\n\r\n“My procession opened out like a fan. My ushers and guards went right\r\nand left, and the three litters bearing myself and Phi-oo and Tsi-puff\r\nmarched across a shiny darkness of floor to the foot of the giant\r\nstairs. Then began a vast throbbing hum, that mingled with the music.\r\nThe two Selenites dismounted, but I was bidden remain seated—I imagine\r\nas a special honour. The music ceased, but not that humming, and by a\r\nsimultaneous movement of ten thousand respectful heads my attention was\r\ndirected to the enhaloed supreme intelligence that hovered above me.\r\n\r\n“At first as I peered into the radiating glow this quintessential brain\r\nlooked very much like an opaque, featureless bladder with dim,\r\nundulating ghosts of convolutions writhing visibly within. Then beneath\r\nits enormity and just above the edge of the throne one saw with a start\r\nminute elfin eyes peering out of the glow. No face, but eyes, as if\r\nthey peered through holes. At first I could see no more than these two\r\nstaring little eyes, and then below I distinguished the little dwarfed\r\nbody and its insect-jointed limbs shrivelled and white. The eyes stared\r\ndown at me with a strange intensity, and the lower part of the swollen\r\nglobe was wrinkled. Ineffectual-looking little hand-tentacles steadied\r\nthis shape on the throne....\r\n\r\n“It was great. It was pitiful. One forgot the hall and the crowd.\r\n\r\n“I ascended the staircase by jerks. It seemed to me that this darkly\r\nglowing brain case above us spread over me, and took more and more of\r\nthe whole effect into itself as I drew nearer. The tiers of attendants\r\nand helpers grouped about their master seemed to dwindle and fade into\r\nthe night. I saw that shadowy attendants were busy spraying that great\r\nbrain with a cooling spray, and patting and sustaining it. For my own\r\npart, I sat gripping my swaying litter and staring at the Grand Lunar,\r\nunable to turn my gaze aside. And at last, as I reached a little\r\nlanding that was separated only by ten steps or so from the supreme\r\nseat, the woven splendour of the music reached a climax and ceased, and\r\nI was left naked, as it were, in that vastness, beneath the still\r\nscrutiny of the Grand Lunar’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“He was scrutinising the first man he had ever seen....\r\n\r\n“My eyes dropped at last from his greatness to the ant figures in the\r\nblue mist about him, and then down the steps to the massed Selenites,\r\nstill and expectant in their thousands, packed on the floor below. Once\r\nagain an unreasonable horror reached out towards me.... And passed.\r\n\r\n“After the pause came the salutation. I was assisted from my litter,\r\nand stood awkwardly while a number of curious and no doubt deeply\r\nsymbolical gestures were vicariously performed for me by two slender\r\nofficials. The encyclopaedic galaxy of the learned that had accompanied\r\nme to the entrance of the last hall appeared two steps above me and\r\nleft and right of me, in readiness for the Grand Lunar’s need, and\r\nPhi-oo’s pale brain placed itself about half-way up to the throne in\r\nsuch a position as to communicate easily between us without turning his\r\nback on either the Grand Lunar or myself. Tsi-puff took up a position\r\nbehind him. Dexterous ushers sidled sideways towards me, keeping a full\r\nface to the Presence. I seated myself Turkish fashion, and Phi-oo and\r\nTsi-puff also knelt down above me. There came a pause. The eyes of the\r\nnearer court went from me to the Grand Lunar and came back to me, and a\r\nhissing and piping of expectation passed across the hidden multitudes\r\nbelow and ceased.\r\n\r\n“That humming ceased.\r\n\r\n“For the first and last time in my experience the moon was silent.\r\n\r\n“I became aware of a faint wheezy noise. The Grand Lunar was addressing\r\nme. It was like the rubbing of a finger upon a pane of glass.\r\n\r\n“I watched him attentively for a time, and then glanced at the alert\r\nPhi-oo. I felt amidst these slender beings ridiculously thick and\r\nfleshy and solid; my head all jaw and black hair. My eyes went back to\r\nthe Grand Lunar. He had ceased; his attendants were busy, and his\r\nshining superficies was glistening and running with cooling spray.\r\n\r\n“Phi-oo meditated through an interval. He consulted Tsi-puff. Then he\r\nbegan piping his recognisable English—at first a little nervously, so\r\nthat he was not very clear.\r\n\r\n“‘M’m—the Grand Lunar—wished to say—wishes to say—he gathers you\r\nare—m’m—men—that you are a man from the planet earth. He wishes to say\r\nthat he welcomes you—welcomes you—and wishes to learn—learn, if I may\r\nuse the word—the state of your world, and the reason why you came to\r\nthis.’\r\n\r\n“He paused. I was about to reply when he resumed. He proceeded to\r\nremarks of which the drift was not very clear, though I am inclined to\r\nthink they were intended to be complimentary. He told me that the earth\r\nwas to the moon what the sun is to the earth, and that the Selenites\r\ndesired very greatly to learn about the earth and men. He then told me\r\nno doubt in compliment also, the relative magnitude and diameter of\r\nearth and moon, and the perpetual wonder and speculation with which the\r\nSelenites had regarded our planet. I meditated with downcast eyes, and\r\ndecided to reply that men too had wondered what might lie in the moon,\r\nand had judged it dead, little recking of such magnificence as I had\r\nseen that day. The Grand Lunar, in token of recognition, caused his\r\nlong blue rays to rotate in a very confusing manner, and all about the\r\ngreat hall ran the pipings and whisperings and rustlings of the report\r\nof what I had said. He then proceeded to put to Phi-oo a number of\r\ninquiries which were easier to answer.\r\n\r\n“He understood, he explained, that we lived on the surface of the\r\nearth, that our air and sea were outside the globe; the latter part,\r\nindeed, he already knew from his astronomical specialists. He was very\r\nanxious to have more detailed information of what he called this\r\nextraordinary state of affairs, for from the solidity of the earth\r\nthere had always been a disposition to regard it as uninhabitable. He\r\nendeavoured first to ascertain the extremes of temperature to which we\r\nearth beings were exposed, and he was deeply interested by my\r\ndescriptive treatment of clouds and rain. His imagination was assisted\r\nby the fact that the lunar atmosphere in the outer galleries of the\r\nnight side is not infrequently very foggy. He seemed inclined to marvel\r\nthat we did not find the sunlight too intense for our eyes, and was\r\ninterested in my attempt to explain that the sky was tempered to a\r\nbluish colour through the refraction of the air, though I doubt if he\r\nclearly understood that. I explained how the iris of the human eyes can\r\ncontract the pupil and save the delicate internal structure from the\r\nexcess of sunlight, and was allowed to approach within a few feet of\r\nthe Presence in order that this structure might be seen. This led to a\r\ncomparison of the lunar and terrestrial eyes. The former is not only\r\nexcessively sensitive to such light as men can see, but it can also\r\n_see_ heat, and every difference in temperature within the moon renders\r\nobjects visible to it.\r\n\r\n“The iris was quite a new organ to the Grand Lunar. For a time he\r\namused himself by flashing his rays into my face and watching my pupils\r\ncontract. As a consequence, I was dazzled and blinded for some little\r\ntime....\r\n\r\n“But in spite of that discomfort I found something reassuring by\r\ninsensible degrees in the rationality of this business of question and\r\nanswer. I could shut my eyes, think of my answer, and almost forget\r\nthat the the Grand Lunar has no face....\r\n\r\n“When I had descended again to my proper place the Grand Lunar asked\r\nhow we sheltered ourselves from heat and storms, and I expounded to him\r\nthe arts of building and furnishing. Here we wandered into\r\nmisunderstandings and cross-purposes, due largely, I must admit, to the\r\nlooseness of my expressions. For a long time I had great difficulty in\r\nmaking him understand the nature of a house. To him and his attendant\r\nSelenites it seemed, no doubt, the most whimsical thing in the world\r\nthat men should build houses when they might descend into excavations,\r\nand an additional complication was introduced by the attempt I made to\r\nexplain that men had originally begun their homes in caves, and that\r\nthey were now taking their railways and many establishments beneath the\r\nsurface. Here I think a desire for intellectual completeness betrayed\r\nme. There was also a considerable tangle due to an equally unwise\r\nattempt on my part to explain about mines. Dismissing this topic at\r\nlast in an incomplete state, the Grand Lunar inquired what we did with\r\nthe interior of our globe.\r\n\r\n“A tide of twittering and piping swept into the remotest corners of\r\nthat great assembly when it was at last made clear that we men know\r\nabsolutely nothing of the contents of the world upon which the\r\nimmemorial generations of our ancestors had been evolved. Three times\r\nhad I to repeat that of all the 4000 miles of distance between the\r\nearth and its centre men knew only to the depth of a mile, and that\r\nvery vaguely. I understood the Grand Lunar to ask why had I come to the\r\nmoon seeing we had scarcely touched our own planet yet, but he did not\r\ntrouble me at that time to proceed to an explanation, being too anxious\r\nto pursue the details of this mad inversion of all his ideas.\r\n\r\n“He reverted to the question of weather, and I tried to describe the\r\nperpetually changing sky, and snow, and frost and hurricanes. ‘But when\r\nthe night comes,’ he asked, ‘is it not cold?’\r\n\r\n“I told him it was colder than by day.\r\n\r\n“‘And does not your atmosphere freeze?’\r\n\r\n“I told him not; that it was never cold enough for that, because our\r\nnights were so short.\r\n\r\n“‘Not even liquefy?’\r\n\r\n“I was about to say ‘No,’ but then it occurred to me that one part at\r\nleast of our atmosphere, the water vapour of it, does sometimes liquefy\r\nand form dew, and sometimes freeze and form frost—a process perfectly\r\nanalogous to the freezing of all the external atmosphere of the moon\r\nduring its longer night. I made myself clear on this point, and from\r\nthat the Grand Lunar went on to speak with me of sleep. For the need of\r\nsleep that comes so regularly every twenty-four hours to all things is\r\npart also of our earthly inheritance. On the moon they rest only at\r\nrare intervals, and after exceptional exertions. Then I tried to\r\ndescribe to him the soft splendours of a summer night, and from that I\r\npassed to a description of those animals that prowl by night and sleep\r\nby day. I told him of lions and tigers, and here it seemed as though we\r\nhad come to a deadlock. For, save in their waters, there are no\r\ncreatures in the moon not absolutely domestic and subject to his will,\r\nand so it has been for immemorial years. They have monstrous water\r\ncreatures, but no evil beasts, and the idea of anything strong and\r\nlarge existing ‘outside’ in the night is very difficult for them....”\r\n\r\n[The record is here too broken to transcribe for the space of perhaps\r\ntwenty words or more.]\r\n\r\n“He talked with his attendants, as I suppose, upon the strange\r\nsuperficiality and unreasonableness of (man) who lives on the mere\r\nsurface of a world, a creature of waves and winds, and all the chances\r\nof space, who cannot even unite to overcome the beasts that prey upon\r\nhis kind, and yet who dares to invade another planet. During this aside\r\nI sat thinking, and then at his desire I told him of the different\r\nsorts of men. He searched me with questions. ‘And for all sorts of work\r\nyou have the same sort of men. But who thinks? Who governs?’\r\n\r\n“I gave him an outline of the democratic method.\r\n\r\n“When I had done he ordered cooling sprays upon his brow, and then\r\nrequested me to repeat my explanation conceiving something had\r\nmiscarried.\r\n\r\n“‘Do they not do different things, then?’ said Phi-oo.\r\n\r\n“Some, I admitted, were thinkers and some officials; some hunted, some\r\nwere mechanics, some artists, some toilers. ‘But _all_ rule,’ I said.\r\n\r\n“‘And have they not different shapes to fit them to their different\r\nduties?’\r\n\r\n“‘None that you can see,’ I said, ‘except perhaps, for clothes. Their\r\nminds perhaps differ a little,’ I reflected.\r\n\r\n“‘Their minds must differ a great deal,’ said the Grand Lunar, ‘or they\r\nwould all want to do the same things.’\r\n\r\n“In order to bring myself into a closer harmony with his\r\npreconceptions, I said that his surmise was right. ‘It was all hidden\r\nin the brain,’ I said; but the difference was there. Perhaps if one\r\ncould see the minds and souls of men they would be as varied and\r\nunequal as the Selenites. There were great men and small men, men who\r\ncould reach out far and wide, men who could go swiftly; noisy,\r\ntrumpet-minded men, and men who could remember without thinking....’”\r\n[The record is indistinct for three words.]\r\n\r\n“He interrupted me to recall me to my previous statements. ‘But you\r\nsaid all men rule?’ he pressed.\r\n\r\n“‘To a certain extent,’ I said, and made, I fear, a denser fog with my\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n“He reached out to a salient fact. ‘Do you mean,’ asked, ‘that there is\r\nno Grand Earthly?’\r\n\r\n“I thought of several people, but assured him finally there was none. I\r\nexplained that such autocrats and emperors as we had tried upon earth\r\nhad usually ended in drink, or vice, or violence, and that the large\r\nand influential section of the people of the earth to which I belonged,\r\nthe Anglo-Saxons, did not mean to try that sort of thing again. At\r\nwhich the Grand Lunar was even more amazed.\r\n\r\n“‘But how do you keep even such wisdom as you have?’ he asked; and I\r\nexplained to him the way we helped our limited [A word omitted here,\r\nprobably “brains.”] with libraries of books. I explained to him how our\r\nscience was growing by the united labours of innumerable little men,\r\nand on that he made no comment save that it was evident we had mastered\r\nmuch in spite of our social savagery, or we could not have come to the\r\nmoon. Yet the contrast was very marked. With knowledge the Selenites\r\ngrew and changed; mankind stored their knowledge about them and\r\nremained brutes—equipped. He said this...” [Here there is a short piece\r\nof the record indistinct.]\r\n\r\n“He then caused me to describe how we went about this earth of ours,\r\nand I described to him our railways and ships. For a time he could not\r\nunderstand that we had had the use of steam only one hundred years, but\r\nwhen he did he was clearly amazed. (I may mention as a singular thing,\r\nthat the Selenites use years to count by, just as we do on earth,\r\nthough I can make nothing of their numeral system. That, however, does\r\nnot matter, because Phi-oo understands ours.) From that I went on to\r\ntell him that mankind had dwelt in cities only for nine or ten thousand\r\nyears, and that we were still not united in one brotherhood, but under\r\nmany different forms of government. This astonished the Grand Lunar\r\nvery much, when it was made clear to him. At first he thought we\r\nreferred merely to administrative areas.\r\n\r\n“‘Our States and Empires are still the rawest sketches of what order\r\nwill some day be,’ I said, and so I came to tell him....” [At this\r\npoint a length of record that probably represents thirty or forty words\r\nis totally illegible.]\r\n\r\n“The Grand Lunar was greatly impressed by the folly of men in clinging\r\nto the inconvenience of diverse tongues. ‘They want to communicate, and\r\nyet not to communicate,’ he said, and then for a long time he\r\nquestioned me closely concerning war.\r\n\r\n“He was at first perplexed and incredulous. ‘You mean to say,’ he\r\nasked, seeking confirmation, ‘that you run about over the surface of\r\nyour world—this world, whose riches you have scarcely begun to\r\nscrape—killing one another for beasts to eat?’\r\n\r\n“I told him that was perfectly correct.\r\n\r\n“He asked for particulars to assist his imagination.\r\n\r\n“‘But do not ships and your poor little cities get injured?’ he asked,\r\nand I found the waste of property and conveniences seemed to impress\r\nhim almost as much as the killing. ‘Tell me more,’ said the Grand\r\nLunar; ‘make me see pictures. I cannot conceive these things.’\r\n\r\n“And so, for a space, though something loath, I told him the story of\r\nearthly War.\r\n\r\n“I told him of the first orders and ceremonies of war, of warnings and\r\nultimatums, and the marshalling and marching of troops. I gave him an\r\nidea of manoeuvres and positions and battle joined. I told him of\r\nsieges and assaults, of starvation and hardship in trenches, and of\r\nsentinels freezing in the snow. I told him of routs and surprises, and\r\ndesperate last stands and faint hopes, and the pitiless pursuit of\r\nfugitives and the dead upon the field. I told, too, of the past, of\r\ninvasions and massacres, of the Huns and Tartars, and the wars of\r\nMahomet and the Caliphs, and of the Crusades. And as I went on, and\r\nPhi-oo translated, the Selenites cooed and murmured in a steadily\r\nintensified emotion.\r\n\r\n“I told them an ironclad could fire a shot of a ton twelve miles, and\r\ngo through 20 feet of iron—and how we could steer torpedoes under\r\nwater. I went on to describe a Maxim gun in action, and what I could\r\nimagine of the Battle of Colenso. The Grand Lunar was so incredulous\r\nthat he interrupted the translation of what I had said in order to have\r\nmy verification of my account. They particularly doubted my description\r\nof the men cheering and rejoicing as they went into battle.\r\n\r\n“‘But surely they do not like it!’ translated Phi-oo.\r\n\r\n“I assured them men of my race considered battle the most glorious\r\nexperience of life, at which the whole assembly was stricken with\r\namazement.\r\n\r\n“‘But what good is this war?’ asked the Grand Lunar, sticking to his\r\ntheme.\r\n\r\n“‘Oh! as for _good_!’ said I; ‘it thins the population!’\r\n\r\n“‘But why should there be a need—?’\r\n\r\n“There came a pause, the cooling sprays impinged upon his brow, and\r\nthen he spoke again.”\r\n\r\nAt this point a series of undulations that have been apparent as a\r\nperplexing complication as far back as Cavor’s description of the\r\nsilence that fell before the first speaking of the Grand Lunar become\r\nconfusingly predominant in the record. These undulations are evidently\r\nthe result of radiations proceeding from a lunar source, and their\r\npersistent approximation to the alternating signals of Cavor is\r\ncuriously suggestive of some operator deliberately seeking to mix them\r\nin with his message and render it illegible. At first they are small\r\nand regular, so that with a little care and the loss of very few words\r\nwe have been able to disentangle Cavor’s message; then they become\r\nbroad and larger, then suddenly they are irregular, with an\r\nirregularity that gives the effect at last of some one scribbling\r\nthrough a line of writing. For a long time nothing can be made of this\r\nmadly zigzagging trace; then quite abruptly the interruption ceases,\r\nleaves a few words clear, and then resumes and continues for the rest\r\nof the message, completely obliterating whatever Cavor was attempting\r\nto transmit. Why, if this is indeed a deliberate intervention, the\r\nSelenites should have preferred to let Cavor go on transmitting his\r\nmessage in happy ignorance of their obliteration of its record, when it\r\nwas clearly quite in their power and much more easy and convenient for\r\nthem to stop his proceedings at any time, is a problem to which I can\r\ncontribute nothing. The thing seems to have happened so, and that is\r\nall I can say. This last rag of his description of the Grand Lunar\r\nbegins in mid-sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n“...interrogated me very closely upon my secret. I was able in a little\r\nwhile to get to an understanding with them, and at last to elucidate\r\nwhat has been a puzzle to me ever since I realised the vastness of\r\ntheir science, namely, how it is they themselves have never discovered\r\nCavorite.’ I find they know of it as a theoretical substance, but they\r\nhave always regarded it as a practical impossibility, because for some\r\nreason there is no helium in the moon, and helium...”\r\n\r\nAcross the last letters of helium slashes the resumption of that\r\nobliterating trace. Note that word “secret,” for on that, and that\r\nalone, I base my interpretation of the message that follows, the last\r\nmessage, as both Mr. Wendigee and myself now believe it to be, that he\r\nis ever likely to send us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI.\r\nThe Last Message Cavor sent to the Earth\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this unsatisfactory manner the penultimate message of Cavor dies\r\nout. One seems to see him away there in the blue obscurity amidst his\r\napparatus intently signalling us to the last, all unaware of the\r\ncurtain of confusion that drops between us; all unaware, too, of the\r\nfinal dangers that even then must have been creeping upon him. His\r\ndisastrous want of vulgar common sense had utterly betrayed him. He had\r\ntalked of war, he had talked of all the strength and irrational\r\nviolence of men, of their insatiable aggressions, their tireless\r\nfutility of conflict. He had filled the whole moon world with this\r\nimpression of our race, and then I think it is plain that he made the\r\nmost fatal admission that upon himself alone hung the possibility—at\r\nleast for a long time—of any further men reaching the moon. The line\r\nthe cold, inhuman reason of the moon would take seems plain enough to\r\nme, and a suspicion of it, and then perhaps some sudden sharp\r\nrealisation of it, must have come to him. One imagines him about the\r\nmoon with the remorse of this fatal indiscretion growing in his mind.\r\nDuring a certain time I am inclined to guess the Grand Lunar was\r\ndeliberating the new situation, and for all that time Cavor may have\r\ngone as free as ever he had gone. But obstacles of some sort prevented\r\nhis getting to his electromagnetic apparatus again after that message I\r\nhave just given. For some days we received nothing. Perhaps he was\r\nhaving fresh audiences, and trying to evade his previous admissions.\r\nWho can hope to guess?\r\n\r\nAnd then suddenly, like a cry in the night, like a cry that is followed\r\nby a stillness, came the last message. It is the briefest fragment, the\r\nbroken beginnings of two sentences.\r\n\r\nThe first was: “I was mad to let the Grand Lunar know—”\r\n\r\nThere was an interval of perhaps a minute. One imagines some\r\ninterruption from without. A departure from the instrument—a dreadful\r\nhesitation among the looming masses of apparatus in that dim, blue-lit\r\ncavern—a sudden rush back to it, full of a resolve that came too late.\r\nThen, as if it were hastily transmitted came: “Cavorite made as\r\nfollows: take—”\r\n\r\nThere followed one word, a quite unmeaning word as it stands: “uless.”\r\n\r\nAnd that is all.\r\n\r\nIt may be he made a hasty attempt to spell “useless” when his fate was\r\nclose upon him. Whatever it was that was happening about that apparatus\r\nwe cannot tell. Whatever it was we shall never, I know, receive another\r\nmessage from the moon. For my own part a vivid dream has come to my\r\nhelp, and I see, almost as plainly as though I had seen it in actual\r\nfact, a blue-lit shadowy dishevelled Cavor struggling in the grip of\r\nthese insect Selenites, struggling ever more desperately and hopelessly\r\nas they press upon him, shouting, expostulating, perhaps even at last\r\nfighting, and being forced backwards step by step out of all speech or\r\nsign of his fellows, for evermore into the Unknown—into the dark, into\r\nthat silence that has no end....",
