The age of the\r\nRestoration and the Revolution is indeed rich in many names that have\r\nwon for themselves an enduring place in the history of English\r\nliterature. South, Tillotson, and Barrow among theologians, Newton in\r\nmathematical science, Locke and Bentley in philosophy and classical\r\nlearning, Clarendon and Burnet in history, L’Estrange, Butler, Marvell\r\nand Dryden in miscellaneous prose, and Temple as an essayist, have all\r\nmade their mark by prose writings which will endure for all time. But\r\nthe names which stand out most prominently in popular estimation as\r\nauthors of great masterpieces in the prose of this period are certainly\r\nthose of John Bunyan, John Evelyn, and Izaak Walton. And along with them\r\nSamuel Pepys is also well entitled to be ranked as a great contemporary\r\nwriter, though he was at pains to try and ensure his being permitted to\r\nremain free from the publicity of authorship, for such time at least as\r\nthe curious might allow his Diary to remain hidden in the cipher he\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nWith the great though untrained genius of Bunyan none of these other\r\nthree celebrated prose authors of this time has anything in common. He\r\nstands apart from them in his fervently religious and romantic\r\ntemperament, in his richness of representation and ingenuity of\r\nanalogy, and in his forcible quaintness of style, as completely as he\r\ndid in social status and in personal surroundings. In complete contrast\r\nto the romantic productions of the self-educated tinker of Bedford, the\r\nworks of Walton and Evelyn were at any rate influenced by, though they\r\ncan hardly be said to have been moulded upon, the style of the preceding\r\nage of old English prose writers ending with Milton. The influence of\r\nthe latter is, indeed, plainly noticeable both in the diction and in the\r\ngeneral sentiment of these two great masters of the pure, nervous\r\nEnglish of their period.\r\n\r\nIt would serve no good purpose to make any attempt here to trace the\r\npoints of resemblance between the works of Walton and Evelyn, and then\r\nto note their differences in style. Each has contributed a masterpiece\r\ntowards our national literature, and it would be a mere waste of time to\r\nmake comparisons between their chief productions. This much, however,\r\nmay be remarked, that the conditions under which each worked were\r\ncompletely different from those surrounding the other. Izaak Walton, the\r\nauthor of many singularly interesting biographies, and of the quaint\r\nhalf-poetical _Compleat Angler or the Contemplative Man’s Recreation_,\r\nthe great classic “Discourse of Fish and Fishing,” was a London\r\ntradesman, while his equally celebrated contemporary John Evelyn, author\r\nof _Sylva, or a Discourse of Forest Trees_, the classic of British\r\nForestry, was a more highly cultured man, who wrote, in the leisure of\r\nofficial duties and amid the surroundings of easy refinement, many\r\nuseful and tasteful works both in prose and poetry, ranging over a wide\r\nvariety of subjects. Judging from the number of editions which appeared\r\nof their principal works, they were both held in great favour by the\r\nreading public, though on the whole the advantage in some respects lay\r\nwith Evelyn. But during the present century the taste of the public,\r\njudged by this same rough and ready, practical standard, has undoubtedly\r\nawarded the prize of popularity to Izaac Walton.\r\n\r\nSo far as the circumstances of their early life were concerned there was\r\ngreater similarity between Walton and Pepys, than between either of them\r\nand Evelyn. Born in the lower middle class, the son of a tailor in\r\nLondon, and himself afterwards a member of the Clothworkers’ guild,\r\nPepys was a true Londoner. His tastes were centred entirely in the town,\r\nand his pleasures were never sought either among woods or green fields,\r\nor by the banks of trout streams and rivers. His thoughts seem often\r\ntainted with the fumes of the wine-bowl and the reek of the tavern; and\r\neven when he swore off drink, as he frequently did, he soon relapsed\r\ninto his customary habits. Educated in London and then at Cambridge,\r\nwhere his love of a too flowing bowl already got him into trouble more\r\nthan once, he was imprudent enough to incur the responsibilities of\r\nmatrimony at the early age of twenty-three, with a beautiful girl only\r\nfifteen years old. Trouble soon stared this rash and improvident young\r\ncouple in the face, but they were spared the pangs of permanent poverty\r\nthrough the aid and influence of Sir Edward Montagu, afterwards Earl of\r\nSandwich, who was a distant relative of Pepys. Acting probably as\r\nMontagu’s secretary for some time, he was first appointed to a clerkship\r\nin the Army pay office, and then soon afterwards became clerk of the\r\nActs of the Navy. Later on, like Evelyn, he held various more important\r\nposts under the Crown, as well as being greatly distinguished by\r\npromotion to non-official positions of the highest honour. His official\r\ncareer was a very brilliant one, and deservedly so from the integrity of\r\nhis work, from his application, despite frequent immoderation in\r\npartaking of wine, and from his business-like methods of work. As\r\nCommissioner for the Affairs of Tangier and Treasurer, he visited\r\nTangier officially. He twice became Secretary to the Admiralty, and was\r\ntwice elected to represent Harwich in Parliament, after having\r\npreviously sat for Castle Rising. He was also twice chosen as Master of\r\nthe Trinity House, and was twice committed to prison, once on a charge\r\nof high treason, and the other time (1690) on the charge of being\r\naffected to King James II., upon whose flight from England Pepys had\r\nlaid down his office and withdrawn himself into retirement. Elected a\r\nFellow of the Royal Society in 1665, he attained the distinction of\r\nbeing its President in 1684. He was Master of the Clothworkers’ Company,\r\nTreasurer and Vice-President of Christ’s Hospital, and one of the Barons\r\nof the Cinque Ports. In 1699, four years before he succumbed to a long\r\nand painful disease borne with fortitude under the depression of reduced\r\ncircumstances, he received the freedom of the City of London,\r\nprincipally for his services in connection with Christ’s Hospital.\r\n\r\nFrom the hasty sketch drafted in the above outlines, it will be seen\r\nthat throughout all Pepys’ manhood the circumstances of his daily life\r\nand environment were much more similar to those of Evelyn than to those\r\nof Walton, who may well be ranked as their senior by almost one\r\ngeneration. Like Evelyn, Izaak Walton was rather the child of the\r\ncountry than a boy of the town. Born in Stafford in 1593, he only came\r\nto settle in London after he had attained early manhood. Thus, though a\r\ncitizen exposing his linen drapery and mens’ millinery for sale first in\r\nthe Gresham Exchange on the Cornhill, then in Fleet Street, and latterly\r\nin Chancery Lane, the Bond Street of that time, he ever cherished a\r\nlonging for more rural surroundings and a desire to exchange life in the\r\ncity for residence in a smaller provincial town. On the civil war\r\nbreaking out in Charles the Ist’s time, he retired from business and\r\nwent to live near his birth place, Stafford, where he had previously\r\nbought some land. Here the last forty years of his long life were spent\r\nin ease and recreation. When not angling or visiting friends, mostly\r\nbrethren of the angle, he engaged in the light literary work of\r\ncompiling biographies and in collecting material for the enrichment of\r\nhis _Compleat Angler_. Published in 1653, this ran through five editions\r\nin 23 years, besides a reprint in 1664 of the third edition (1661).\r\n\r\nIn spite of the many similarities between Evelyn and Pepys as to\r\nuniversity education, official position, political partisanship, and\r\nsocial and scientific status in London, there are yet such essential\r\ndifferences between what has been bequeathed to us by these two friends\r\nthat comparison between them is almost impossible. They are both\r\nauthors: but it was by chance rather than by design that Pepys\r\nultimately acquired repute as an author, whereas Evelyn at once achieved\r\nthe literary fame he desired and wrote for. Neither of the two works\r\npublished by Pepys, _The Portugal History_ (1677) and the _Memories of\r\nthe Royal Navy_ (1690), procured for him the gratification of revising\r\nthem for a second edition, and it is indeed open to question if the\r\n_Diary_ upon which his undying fame rests was ever intended by him to be\r\npublished after his death. This is a point that is never likely to be\r\nsettled satisfactorily. The fact of its having been written in cipher\r\nlooks as if it had been compiled solely for private amusement, and not\r\nwith any intention of posthumous publication; and this view is greatly\r\nstrengthened by the unblushing and complete manner in which he lays\r\naside the mask of outward propriety and records his too frequent\r\nquaffing of the wine-cup, his household bickerings, his improprieties\r\nwith fair women, and his graver conjugal infidelities. The improprieties\r\nof other persons, and especially those of higher social rank than\r\nhimself, might very intelligibly have been written in cipher intended to\r\nhave been transcribed and printed after his death; but it would be at\r\nvariance with human nature to believe that he could so unreservedly have\r\nreduced to writing all the faults and follies of his life had even\r\nposthumous publication of his _Diary_ been contemplated by him at the\r\ntime of writing it. For it is hardly capable of argument that, next to\r\nthe instincts of self-preservation and of the maintenance of family\r\nties, the desire to preserve outward appearances is undoubtedly one of\r\nthe strongest of human feelings; and this great natural law, often the\r\nlast remnant or the substitute of conscience, character, and\r\nself-respect, is even more fully operative in a highly civilised than in\r\na savage or a semi-savage state of society. Of a truth, every human\r\nbeing is more or less of a Pharisee with regard to certain\r\nconventionalities of life. Complete disregard for the maintenance of\r\nsome sort of standard of outward appearances is the absolute vanishing\r\npoint of self-respect. Till that has been reached by any individual the\r\nhope of his reformation is not lost, though at the same time successful\r\ndissimulation makes the prospect of a turning point in a vicious career\r\nbut remote. Still, “it is a long lane that has no turning.” It is\r\ntherefore most probable that the leaving behind of the key to the cipher\r\nwas rather due to inadvertence than to intention and design. And if this\r\nview be correct, then Pepys’ charming _Diary_ was the purely natural\r\noutpouring of his mind without ever a thought being bestowed on\r\nauthorship and ultimate publication.\r\n\r\nWith Evelyn’s _Diary_, however, it was different. Although it was not\r\npublished until 1818, and though it may never have been intended by its\r\nwriter to have been given to the world in book form, yet it was very\r\nclearly intended to be an autobiographical legacy to his family. Hence\r\nit is no mere outpouring of the spirit upon pages meant only for the\r\nsubsequent perusal of him who thus rendered in indelible characters his\r\npassing thoughts of the moment. And this being the case, comparison\r\nbetween the two Diaries would be just as unfair as it is unnecessary.\r\nThe one is the fruit of unrestrained freedom and a mirthful mind, while\r\nthe other is the product of cultured leisure and a refined literary\r\nmethod. When Evelyn was Commissioner for the maintenance of the Dutch\r\nprisoners (1664-70) he had frequent communications with Pepys, then of\r\nthe Navy, and there are special references to him in Evelyn’s memoirs.\r\nThat an intimate friendship existed there is no doubt, and that they\r\neach held the other in great respect as a man of intellect, as well as\r\nof good business capacity, is equally clear. Thus, in June, 1669, he\r\nencouraged Pepys to be operated on ‘when exceedingly afflicted with the\r\nstone;’ and on 19 February, 1671, ‘This day din’d with me Mr. Surveyor,\r\nDr. Christopher Wren, and Mr. Pepys, Cleark of the Acts, two\r\nextraordinary ingenious and knowing persons, and other friends. I\r\ncarried them to see the piece of carving which I had recommended to the\r\nKing.’ This was a masterpiece of Grinling Gibbon’s work, which Charles\r\nadmired but did not purchase; so Gibbon not long after sold it for £80,\r\nthough ‘well worth £100, without the frame, to Sir George Viner.’ Evelyn\r\nat this time got Wren, however, to promise faithfully to employ Gibbon\r\nto do the choir carving in the new St. Paul’s Cathedral.\r\n\r\nEach of their Diaries teems with reference to the other. Pepys asked\r\nEvelyn to sit to Kneller for his portrait which he desired for ‘reasons\r\nI had (founded upon gratitude, affection, and esteeme) to covet that in\r\neffigie which I most truly value in the original.’ This refers to the\r\nwell-known portrait, now at Wotton, that has been copied and engraved.\r\n\r\nIt appears to have been begun in October, 1685, but it was not till\r\nJuly, 1689, that the commission was actually completed. The portrait\r\nexhibits the face of an elderly man distinctly of a high-strung and\r\nnervous temperament, though not quite to the extent of being ‘sicklied\r\noer with the pale caste of thought.’ His right hand, too, which grasps\r\nhis _Sylva_ is one very characteristic of the nervous disposition. A\r\nbright, shrewd intellect, lofty thoughts, high motives, good resolves,\r\nand--last, tho’ by no means least--a serene mind, the _mens conscia\r\nrecti_ which Pepys bluntly called ‘a little conceitedness,’ are all\r\nstamped upon his well-marked and not unshapely features. It is eminently\r\nthe face of a philosopher, an enthusiast, a studious scholar, and a\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nNo one can ever know Evelyn so well as Pepys did; and here is his\r\nopinion of John Evelyn, expressed in the secret pages of his cipher\r\nDiary on November, 1665:--‘In fine, a most excellent person he is, and\r\nmust be allowed a little for a little conceitedness; but he may well be\r\nso, being a man so much above others.’ And this just exactly bears out\r\nthe rough general impression conveyed by the perusal of Evelyn’s Diary\r\nand his other literary works. The long friendship of these two was only\r\nterminated by the death of Pepys on 26th May, 1703, not long before\r\nEvelyn had himself to depart from this life. ‘This day died Mr. Sam.\r\nPepys, a very courtly, industrious and curious person, none in England\r\nexceeding him in knowledge of the navy, in which he had passed through\r\nall the most considerable offices, Clerk of the Acts and Secretary of\r\nthe Admiralty, all which he performed with great integrity. When King\r\nJames II., went out of England, he laid down his office and would serve\r\nno more..... He was universally belov’d, hospitable, generous, learned\r\nin many things, skilled in music, a very great cherisher of learned men\r\nof whom he had the conversation..... Mr. Pepys had been for near 40\r\nyeares so much my particular friend, that Mr. Jackson sent me compleat\r\nmourning, desiring me to be one to hold up the pall at his magnificient\r\nobsequies, but my indisposition hinder’d me from doing him this last\r\noffice.’\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n_Evelyn’s Childhood, Early Education, and Youth._\r\n\r\nThe essential facts of Evelyn’s life, as he himself would have us know\r\nthem, are set forth at full length in autobiographical form,\r\nchronologically arranged in what is always spoken of as his _Diary_,\r\nalthough evidently this was (much of it, at any rate) merely a\r\nsubsequent personal compilation from an actual diary, kept in imitation\r\nof his father, from the age of 11 years onwards and down even to within\r\none month of his death in 1706.\r\n\r\nThe second son and the fourth child of Richard Evelyn of Wotton in\r\nSurrey, and of his wife Eleanor, daughter of John Stansfield ‘of an\r\nancient honorable family (though now extinct) in Shropshire,’ he was\r\nborn at Wotton on 31st. October, 1620. His father, ‘was of a sanguine\r\ncomplexion, mixed with a dash of choler; his haire inclining to light,\r\nwhich tho’ exceeding thick became hoary by the time he was 30 years of\r\nage; it was somewhat curled towards the extremity; his beard, which he\r\nwore a little picked, as the mode was, of a brownish colour, and so\r\ncontinued to the last, save that it was somewhat mingled with grey\r\nhaires about his cheekes: which, with his countenance, was cleare, and\r\nfresh colour’d, his eyes quick and piercing, an ample forehead, manly\r\naspect; low of stature, but very strong. He was for his life so exact\r\nand temperate, that I have heard he had never been surprised by excesse,\r\nbeing ascetic and sparing. His wisdom was greate, and judgment most\r\nacute; of solid discourse, affable, humble and in nothing affected; of a\r\nthriving, neat, silent and methodical genius; discretely severe, yet\r\nliberal on all just occasions to his children, strangers, and servants;\r\na lover of hospitality; of a singular and Christian moderation in all\r\nhis actions; a Justice of the Peace and of the Quorum; he served his\r\ncountry as High Sheriff for Surrey and Sussex together. He was a\r\nstudious decliner of honours and titles, being already in that esteem\r\nwith his country that they could have added little to him besides their\r\nburden. He was a person of that rare conversation, that upon frequent\r\nrecollection, and calling to mind passages of his life and discourse, I\r\ncould never charge him with the least passion or inadvertence. His\r\nestate was esteem’d about £4,000 per ann. well wooded and full of\r\ntimber.’ As for his mother, ‘She was of proper personage; of a brown\r\ncomplexion; her eyes and haire of a lovely black; of constitution\r\ninclyned to a religious melancholy, or pious sadnesse; of a rare memory\r\nand most exemplary life; for œconomie and prudence esteemed one of the\r\nmost conspicuous in her Country.’\r\n\r\nApparently John Evelyn thought he had made a very judicious choice of\r\nhis father and mother when he wrote ‘Thus much in brief touching my\r\nparents; nor was it reasonable I should speake lesse to them to whom I\r\nowe so much.’\r\n\r\nThese passages, occurring in the first two pages of his _Diary_ serve at\r\nonce to illustrate a very characteristic feature of Evelyn’s mind, and\r\none that is everywhere discernible in his writings. He was a man with a\r\nhighly cultured and a very well balanced mind, but he was somewhat\r\ninclined to exaggerate; and he certainly had the rather enviable gift of\r\nconsidering everything pertaining to him, or approved or advocated by\r\nhim, as very superior indeed. All his eggs had two yolks, and all his\r\ngeese were swans. What he liked, he _loved_; and what he did not like,\r\nhe _hated_. There was no golden mean with him; he was either very\r\noptimistic or else intensely pessimistic. Hence, naturally, he gave hard\r\nknocks to those who differed from him in opinion, and particularly after\r\nthe Restoration; for he was one of the most expressive among King\r\nCharles II’s courtiers. Direct evidence of this special temperament was\r\ncharacteristic of Evelyn throughout all his life, and was of course\r\nparticularly noticeable in his writings, as we shall subsequently see.\r\nIt is therefore only to be expected that he prized his father’s little\r\nestate of Wotton in Surrey as one of the finest in the kingdom. ‘Wotton,\r\nthe mansion house of my Father, left him by my Grandfather, (now my\r\neldest Brother’s), is situated in the most Southern part of the Shire,\r\nand though in a valley, yet really upon part of Lyth Hill one of the\r\nmost eminent in England for the prodigious prospect to be seen from its\r\nsummit, tho’ of few observed. From it may be discerned 12 or 13\r\nCounties, with part of the Sea on the Coast of Sussex, in a serene day.\r\nThe house is large and ancient, suitable to those hospitable times, and\r\nso sweetly environed with those delicious streams and venerable woods,\r\nas in the judgment of Strangers as well as Englishmen it may be compared\r\nto one of the most tempting and pleasant Seats in the Nation, and most\r\ntempting for a great person and a wanton purse to render it conspicuous.\r\nIt has rising grounds, meadows, woods, and water in abundance. The\r\ndistance from London (is) little more than 20 miles, and yet (it is) so\r\nsecurely placed as if it were 100; three miles from Dorking, which\r\nserves it abundantly with provisions as well of land as sea; 6 from\r\nGuildford, 12 from Kingston. I will say nothing of the ayre, because the\r\npraeeminence is universally given to Surrey, the soil being dry and\r\nsandy: but I should speak much of the gardens, fountains, and groves\r\nthat adorne it, were they not as generally knowne to be amongst the most\r\nnatural, and (till this later and universal luxury of the whole nation,\r\nsince abounding in such expenses) the most magnificent that England\r\nafforded, and which indeed gave one of the first examples to that\r\nelegancy since so much in vogue, and followed in the managing of their\r\nwaters, and other ornaments of that nature. Let me add, the contiguity\r\nof five or six Mannors, the patronage of the livings about it, and, what\r\nis none of the least advantages, a good neighbourhood. All which\r\nconspire to render it fit for the present possessor, my worthy Brother,\r\nand his noble lady, whose constant liberality give them title both to\r\nthe place and the affections of all that know them. Thus, with the poet,\r\n\r\n    Nescio quâ natale solum dulcedine cunctos\r\n    Ducit, et im’ emores non sinit esse sui!’\r\n\r\nThis is a very good specimen of Evelyn’s style, for it shews the\r\noptimistic quality which, along with refinement and a love of classical\r\nquotations, is ever present in his writings. Lythe Hill, from the summit\r\nof which the ‘prodigious prospect’ is so eminently belauded, attains a\r\nheight of less than a thousand feet above the sea-level.\r\n\r\nAt the early age of four John Evelyn was initiated into the rudiments\r\nof education by one Frier, who taught children at the church porch of\r\nWotton; but soon after that he was sent to Lewes in Sussex, to be with\r\nhis grandfather Standsfield, while a plague was raging in London. There\r\nhe remained, after Standsfield’s death in 1627, till 1630, when he was\r\nsent to the free school at Southover near Lewes and kept there until he\r\nwent up to Balliol College, Oxford, as a fellow-commoner in 1637, being\r\nthen 16 years of age. It was his father’s intention to have placed him\r\nat Eton ‘but I was so terrefied at the report of the severe discipline\r\nthere that I was sent back to Lewes, which perverseness of mine I have\r\nsince a thousand times deplored.’ In that same year (1637) Evelyn had\r\nthe misfortune to lose his mother, then only in the 37th year of her\r\nage. Having been ‘extremely remisse’ in his studies at school, he made\r\nno great mark during his University career. His application was not\r\nassiduous, while his tutor, Bradshaw, whom he disliked, was negligent;\r\nand he appears to have been subject to frequent attacks of ague,\r\ndisposing him to casual recreation rather than to close study. He had\r\nalso apparently the desire to acquire a smattering of many different\r\nthings rather than to study hard at a few special subjects. ‘I began to\r\nlook on the rudiments of musick, in which I afterwards arriv’d to some\r\nformal knowledge though to small perfection of hand, because I was so\r\nfrequently diverted by inclinations to newer trifles.’\r\n\r\nCompleting his Oxford studies early in 1639, without taking any degree,\r\nhe went into residence at the Middle Temple in April, and soon arrived\r\nat the conclusion that his ‘being at the University in regard of these\r\navocations, was of very small benefit.’ Here he and his brother lodged\r\nin ‘a very handsome apartment just over against the Halt Court, but four\r\npayre of stayres high, which gave us the advantage of fairer prospect,\r\nbut did not much contribute to the love of that unpolish’d study, to\r\nwhich (I suppose,) my Father had design’d me!’ While thus a law student,\r\non 30th October, he saw ‘his Majestie (coming from his Northern\r\nExpedition) ride in pomp, and a kind of ovation, with all the markes of\r\na happy peace, restor’d to the affections of his people, being\r\nconducted through London with a most splendid cavalcade; and on 3rd\r\nNovember, following (a day never to be mentioned without a curse) to\r\nthat long, ungratefull, foolish, and fatall Parliament, the beginning of\r\nall our sorrows for twenty years after, and the period of the most happy\r\nMonarch in the world: _Quis talia fando!_’\r\n\r\nIn the closing days of 1640 Evelyn lost his father, when he abandoned\r\nthe study of the law and betook himself abroad in preference to being\r\nmixed up in the disorders of the time. His resolutions were ‘to absent\r\nmyselfe from this ill face of things at home, which gave umbrage to\r\nwiser than myselfe, that the medaill was reversing, and our calamities\r\nbut yet in their infancy.’ Shortly before that he had ‘beheld on Tower\r\nHill the fatal stroake which sever’d the wisest head in England from the\r\nshoulders of the Earl of Strafford.’\r\n\r\nLanding at Flushing in July, 1641, Evelyn passed, accompanied by his\r\ntutor Mr. Caryll, through Midelbrogh, Der Veer, Dort, Rotterdam, and\r\nDelft, to the Hague, where he presented himself to the Queen of\r\nBohemia’s Court. Thence he went on to Leyden, Utrecht, Rynen, and\r\nNimeguen, to where the Dutch army was encamped about Genep, a strong\r\nfortress on the Wahale river. Here he enrolled himself and served for a\r\nfew days as a volunteer in the Queen’s army ‘according to the\r\ncompliment,’ being attached to the English company of Captain Apsley:\r\nand in this capacity he ‘received many civilities.’ Even when thus\r\nplaying at soldering, he did not like the roughness of a soldier’s life,\r\n‘for the sun piercing the canvass of the tent, it was, during the day,\r\nunsufferable, and at night not seldom infested with mists and fogs,\r\nwhich ascended from the river.’ However, during the few days he took his\r\nfair share in the work. ‘As the turn came about, I watched on a horne\r\nwork neere our quarters, and trailed a pike, being the next morning\r\nrelieved by a company of French. This was our continual duty till the\r\nCastle was re-fortified, and all danger of quitting that station\r\nsecured.’ Retracing his steps to Rotterdam, Delft, the Hague and Leyden,\r\nhe also visited Haerlem, Amsterdam, Antwerp, Brussels and various other\r\ntowns before returning by way of Ostend, Dunkirk and Dover to Wotton,\r\nwhere he celebrated his 21st birthday.\r\n\r\nAlthough his _Diary_ does not contain any details on such matters as\r\nPepys would have been free to record in his cipher, John Evelyn was\r\nprobably rather a gay and pleasure-loving youth about this time. A\r\nsuspicion of this seems justified by the fact that he ‘was elected one\r\nof the Comptrolers of the Middle Temple-revellers, as the fashion of ye\r\nyoung Students and Gentlemen was, the Christmas being kept this year\r\n(1641) with great solemnity; but being desirous to passe it in the\r\nCountry, I got leave to resign my staffe of office, and went with my\r\nbrother Richard to Wotton.’ From January till March he was back in\r\nLondon ‘studying a little, but dancing and fooling more.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n_Evelyn’s Early Manhood, Continental Travels and Studies, Voluntary\r\nExile, and Return to England 1647._\r\n\r\nIt was hardly possible that anyone situated as Evelyn was could hold\r\naloof from the party strife when civil war broke out during the course\r\nof this year. And, of course, he was on the Royalist side. But he did\r\nnot serve long with the troops. Here is his own record of that military\r\nservice,--‘Oct. 3rd. To Chichester, and hence the next day to see the\r\nsiege of Portsmouth; for now was that bloody difference betweene the\r\nKing and Parliament broken out, which ended in the fatal tragedy so many\r\nyears after. It was on the day of its being render’d to Sir William\r\nWaller, which gave me an opportunity of taking my leave of Colonel\r\nGoring the Governor, now embarqueing for France. This day was fought\r\nthat signal Battaile at Edgehill. Thence I went to Southampton and\r\nWinchester, where I visited the Castle, Schole, Church, and King\r\nArthur’s Round Table, but especially the Church, and its Saxon Kings’\r\nMonuments, which I esteemed a worthy antiquity. 12th. November, was the\r\nBattle of Braineford surprisingly fought, and to the greate\r\nconsternation of the Citty had his Majesty (as twas believed he would)\r\npursu’d his advantage. I came in with my horse and armes just at the\r\nretreate, but was not permitted to stay longer than the 15th. by reason\r\nof the Army’s marching to Glocester, which would have left both me and\r\nmy brother expos’d to ruine, without any advantage to his Majestie. Dec.\r\n7th. I went from Wotton to London to see the so much celebrated line of\r\ncom’unication, and on the 10th. returned to Wotton, nobody knowing of my\r\nhaving been in his Majestie’s Army.’\r\n\r\nDuring the first half of 1643 Evelyn employed himself entirely in rural\r\noccupations, visiting the garden and vineyard of Hatfield and similar\r\nplaces. From time to time, however, he made many journeys to and from\r\nLondon. What he sometimes saw there gave him much food for ample\r\nreflection. ‘May 2nd. I went from Wotton to London, where I saw the\r\nfurious and zelous people demolish that stately Crosse in Cheapside. On\r\nthe 4th. I returned with no little regrett for the confusion that\r\nthreatened us. Resolving to possess myself in some quiet if it might be,\r\nin a time of so great jealosy, I built by my Brother’s permission a\r\nstudy, made a fishpond, an island, and some other solitudes and\r\nretirements, at Wotton, which gave the first occasion of improving them\r\nto those water-works and gardens which afterwards succeeded them, and\r\nbecame at that tyme the most famous of England.’ But, willy nilly, he\r\nwas bound to become dragged into action on the King’s behalf. ‘July\r\n12th. I sent my black manege horse and furniture with a friend to his\r\nMajestie then at Oxford. 23rd. The Covenant being pressed, I absented\r\nmyselfe; but finding it impossible to evade the doing very unhandsome\r\nthings, and which had been a greate cause of my perpetual motions\r\nhitherto between Wotton and London, Oct. 2nd. I obtayned a lycence of\r\nhis Majestie, dated at Oxford and sign’d by the King, to travell\r\nagaine.’ Accordingly, on 7th. November, he took boat at the Tower wharf\r\nfor Sittingbourne, ‘being only a payre of oares, expos’d to a hideous\r\nstorm, thence posting to Dover accompanied by an Oxford friend, Mr.\r\nThicknesse, and crossing the Channel to Calais.’\r\n\r\nProceeding by Boulogne, Monstreuil, Abbeville, Beauvais, Beaumont, and\r\nSt. Denys to Paris, of which he gives a very interesting account, he\r\nthrew himself into the social life of that gay capital. His first step\r\nwas to make his duty to Sir Richard Browne, afterwards his\r\nfather-in-law, then in charge of British affairs pending the arrival of\r\nthe Earl of Norwich, who came immediately after that as Ambassador\r\nExtraordinary. That Evelyn’s purse was fairly well lined the Parisian\r\npassages in his _Diary_ distinctly show. He appears to have taken part\r\nin many gay excursions and junkettings, though he sometimes reckoned the\r\ncost. ‘At an inn in this village (St. Germains en Lay) is an host who\r\ntreats all the greate persons in princely lodgings for furniture and\r\nplate, but they pay well for it, as I have don. Indeede the\r\nentertainment is very splendid, and not unreasonable, considering the\r\nexcellent manner of dressing their meate, and of the service. Here are\r\nmany debauches and excessive revellings, as being out of all noise and\r\nobservance.’ Wherever he visited the royal gardens and villas, or those\r\nof the great nobles and other magnates, he writes rapturously of what he\r\nsaw. Sometimes, though, his joyous optimism rather leads one to doubt\r\nthe quality of his taste, as when, writing of Richelieu’s villa at\r\nRuell, he says ‘This leads to the Citroniere, which is a noble conserve\r\nof all those rarities; and at the end of it is the Arch of Constantine,\r\npainted on a wall in oyle, as large as the real one at Rome, so well don\r\nthat even a man skilled in painting may mistake it for stone and\r\nsculpture. The skie and hills which seem to be between the arches are so\r\nnaturall that swallows and other birds, thinking to fly through, have\r\ndashed themselves against the wall. I was infinitely taken with this\r\nagreeable cheate.’ But he was certainly gradually acquiring the\r\nmaterials which were afterwards to be so well used by him in his great\r\nworks on gardening. After a tour made in Normandy with Sir John Cotton,\r\na Cambridgeshire knight, he quitted Paris in April, 1644. Marching\r\nacross by Chartres and Estamps to Orleans, the party of which he formed\r\none had an encounter with brigands, ‘for no sooner were we entred two or\r\nthree leagues into ye Forest of Orleans (which extends itself many\r\nmiles), but the company behind us were set on by rogues, who, shooting\r\nfrom ye hedges and frequent covert, slew fowre upon the spot... I had\r\ngreate cause to give God thankes for this escape.’ Taking boat, he went\r\ndown the Loire to St. Dieu, and thence rode to Blois and on to Tours,\r\nwhere he stayed till the autumn. ‘Here I took a master of the language\r\nand studied the tongue very diligently, recreating myself sometimes at\r\nthe maill, and sometymes about the towne.’ Here, too, he paid his duty\r\nto the Queen of England, ‘having newly arrived, and going for Paris.’ In\r\nthe latter part of September, still accompanied by his friend\r\nThicknesse, he left Tours and ‘travelled towards the more southerne part\r\nof France, minding now to shape my course so as I might winter in\r\nItaly.’ Journeying southward, partly by road and partly by river, he\r\nvisited Lyons, Avignon, and Marseilles, whither he wended his way\r\ndeliciously ‘thro’ a country sweetely declining to the South and\r\nMediterranean coasts, full of vineyards and olive-yards, orange-trees,\r\nmyrtils, pomegranads, and the like sweete plantations, to which belong\r\npleasantly-situated villas ...... as if they were so many heapes of snow\r\ndropp’d out of the clouds amongst these perennial greenes.’ Taking mules\r\nto Cannes, he went by sea to Genoa ‘having procur’d a bill of health\r\n(without which there is no admission at any towne in Italy).’ On\r\nreaching ‘Mongus, now cal’d Monaco’ on the route, ‘we were hastened\r\naway, having no time permitted us by our avaricious master to go up and\r\nsee this strong and considerable place.’\r\n\r\nOn Oct. 16th., after ‘much ado and greate perill’ he landed on Italian\r\nsoil. He was fully prepared to have the most delicious pleasure in this\r\nclassical land, having already, even during the stormy weather off the\r\ncoast, ‘smelt the peculiar joys of Italy in the perfumes of orange,\r\ncitron, and jassmine flowers for divers leagues seaward.’\r\n\r\nIt would be pleasant to ramble through Italy in Evelyn’s company, and to\r\nshare with him the many enjoyments recorded in his _Diary_: but space\r\nforbids. From Genoa he went to Leghorn and Pisa, from Pisa to Florence,\r\nthence to Sienna, and on to Rome. ‘I came to Rome on the 4th November,\r\n1644, about 5 at night, and being perplexed for a convenient lodging,\r\nwandered up and down on horseback, till at last one conducted us to\r\nMonsieur Petits, a Frenchman, near the Piazza Spagnola. Here I alighted,\r\nand having bargained with my host for 20 crownes a moneth, I caused a\r\ngood fire to be made in my chamber and went to bed, being so very wet.\r\nThe next morning (for I was resolved to spend no time idly here) I got\r\nacquainted with several persons who had long lived at Rome.’\r\n\r\nEvelyn’s description of the interesting sights he saw in Rome is so good\r\nthat it might well be perused in place of modern guide-books by those\r\nvisiting the city. There is a delightful attractiveness about it, in\r\nwhich these up-to-date works are sometimes wanting. But even his\r\nyouthful energy began to tire, and his keen appetite to become sated\r\nwith continuous sightseeing. After more than six months of it ‘we now\r\ndetermined to desist from visiting any more curiosities, except what\r\nshould happen to come in our way, when my companion Mr. Henshaw or\r\nmyself should go out to take the aire.’ Then, however, as now for some\r\npeople, the crowning event of a visit to Rome was to receive the Papal\r\nblessing. This Evelyn desired and obtained, although the event is not\r\nrecorded in his diary with any great enthusiasm. ‘May, 4th. Having seen\r\nthe entrie of ye ambassador of Lucca, I went to the Vatican, where, by\r\nfavour of our Cardinal Protector, Frair Barberini, I was admitted into\r\nthe consistorie, heard the ambassador make his ovation in Latine to the\r\nPope, sitting on an elevated state or throne, and changing two\r\npontifical miters; after which I was presented to kisse his toe, that\r\nis, his embroder’d slipper, two Cardinals holding up his vest and\r\nsurplice, and then being sufficiently bless’d with his thumb and two\r\nfingers for that day, I return’d home to dinner.’\r\n\r\nHe quitted Rome about the middle of May after a sojourn there of seven\r\nmonths, which had occasioned him so small an outlay that he remarked\r\nthereon in his Diary. ‘The bills of exchange I took up from my first\r\nentering Italy till I went from Rome amounted but to 616 _ducanti di\r\nbanco_, though I purchas’d many books, pictures, and curiosities.’ Going\r\nnorthwards by Sienna, Leghorn, Lucca, Florence, Bologna, and Ferrara, he\r\nreached Venice early in June. Arriving ‘extreamly weary and beaten’ with\r\nthe journey, he went and enjoyed the new luxury of a Turkish bath. ‘This\r\nbath did so open my pores that it cost me one of the greatest colds I\r\never had in my life, for want of necessary caution in keeping myselfe\r\nwarme for some time after; for coming out, I immediately began to visit\r\nthe famous places of the city; and travellers who come in to Italy do\r\nnothing but run up and down to see sights.’\r\n\r\nEvelyn had the good fortune to see Venice _en fête_, and in those days\r\nthat must have been a sight well worth seeing. He saw the Doge espouse\r\nthe Adriatic by casting a gold ring into it on Ascension day with very\r\ngreat pomp and ceremony. ‘It was now Ascension Weeke, and the greate\r\nmart or faire of ye whole yeare was kept, every body at liberty and\r\njollie. The noblemen stalking with their ladys on _choppines_; these are\r\nhigh-heel’d shoes, particularly affected by these proude dames, or, as\r\nsome say, invented to keepe them at home, it being very difficult to\r\nwalke with them; whence one being asked how he liked the Venetian dames,\r\nreplied, they were _mezzo carne, mezzo ligno_, half flesh, half wood,\r\nand he would have none of them. The truth is, their garb is very odd, as\r\nseeming always in masquerade; their other habits also totaly different\r\nfrom all nations.’\r\n\r\nIn Venice Evelyn made arrangements for visiting the Holy Land and parts\r\nof Syria, Egypt, and Turkey; but they fell through owing to the vessel,\r\nin which he would have sailed, being requisitioned to carry provisions\r\nto Candia, then under attack from the Turks. Forced to abandon this\r\nproject, he remained in Venice ‘being resolved to spend some moneths\r\nhere in study, especially physic and anatomie, of both which there was\r\nnow the most famous professors in Europe.’ But in the autumn Mr.\r\nThicknesse, ‘my dear friend, and till now my constant fellow traveller,’\r\nwas obliged to return to England on private affairs; so Evelyn was left\r\nalone in Venice. Very shortly after that he had an illness which seems\r\nto have at one time threatened a fatal termination. ‘Using to drink my\r\nwine cool’d with snow and ice, as the manner here is, I was so afflicted\r\nwith the angina and soare-throat, that it had almost cost me my life.\r\nAfter all the remedies Cavalier Veslingius, cheife professor here, could\r\napply, old Salvatico (that famous physician) being call’d made me be\r\ncupp’d and scarified in the back in foure places, which began to give me\r\nbreath, and consequently life, for I was in ye utmost danger: but God\r\nbeing mercifull to me, I was after a fortnight abroad againe; when\r\nchanging my lodging I went over against Pozzo Pinto, where I bought for\r\nwinter provisions 3000 weight of excellent grapes, and pressed my owne\r\nwine, which proved incomparable liquor.’ Its goodness, indeed, seems to\r\nhave been the death of it. ‘Oct. 31st. Being my birth-day, the nuns of\r\nSt. Catherine’s sent me flowers of silk-work. We were very studious all\r\nthis winter till Christmas, when on twelfth day we invited all the\r\nEnglish and Scotts in towne to feast, which sunk our excellent wine\r\nconsiderably.’ In explanation of this passage, it needs to be said that\r\nhe had soon again changed his lodging and gone to reside with three\r\nEnglish friends ‘neere St. Catherine’s over against the monasterie of\r\nnunnes, where we hired the whole house and lived very nobly. Here I\r\nlearned to play on ye theorbo, taught by Sig. Dominico Bassano.’\r\n\r\nAfter ‘the folly and madnesse of the Carnevall’ was over, Evelyn left\r\nVenice for Padua in January, 1646, but went back in March to take leave\r\nof his friends there, and at Easter set out on his return journey to\r\nEngland in company with the poet Waller, who had been glad to go abroad\r\nafter being much worried by the Puritan party. They travelled by way of\r\nVicenza, Verona, Brescia, Milan, the Lago Maggiore, the Simplon Pass,\r\nSion, and St. Maurice to Geneva. Here again Evelyn became sick nigh unto\r\ndeath, from small-pox contracted at Beveretta, the night before reaching\r\nGeneva. ‘Being extremely weary and complaining of my head, and finding\r\nlittle accommodation in the house, I caus’d one of our hostesses\r\ndaughters to be removed out of her bed and went immediately into it\r\nwhilst it was yet warme, being so heavy with pain and drowsinesse that I\r\nwould not stay to have the sheets chang’d; but I shortly after payd\r\ndearly for my impatience, falling sick of the small-pox so soon as I\r\ncame to Geneva, for by the smell of frankincense and ye tale of ye good\r\nwoman told me of her daughter having had an ague, I afterwards concluded\r\nshe had been newly recovered of the small-pox.’ Becoming very ill he was\r\nbled of the physician ‘a very learned old man..... He afterwards\r\nacknowledg’d that he should not have bled me had he suspected ye\r\nsmall-pox, which brake out a day after.’ As nurse he had a Swiss matron\r\nafflicted with gôitre, ‘whose monstrous throat, when I sometimes awak’d\r\nout of unquiet slumbers, would affright me.’ But again he was spared for\r\nthe work he was destined to do. ‘By God’s mercy after five weeks keeping\r\nmy chamber I went abroad.’\r\n\r\nLeaving Geneva on the 5th July 1646, Evelyn’s party went by way of\r\nLyons, La Charite, and Orleans to Paris, arriving ‘rejoic’d that after\r\nso many disasters and accidents in a tedious peregrination, I was gotten\r\nso neere home, and here I resolv’d to rest myselfe before I went\r\nfurther. It was now October, and the onely time that in my whole life I\r\nspent most idly, tempted from my more profitable recesses; but I soon\r\nrecover’d my better resolutions and fell to my study, learning the High\r\nDutch and Spanish tongues, and now and then refreshing my danceing, and\r\nsuch exercises as I had long omitted, and which are not in much\r\nreputation amongst the sober Italians.’\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the following winter and spring he saw much of ‘Sir\r\nRichard Browne, his Majesty’s Resident at the Court of France, and with\r\nwhose lady and family I had contracted a greate friendship (and\r\nparticularly set my affections on a daughter).’ To this young girl,\r\nMary, the only child of Sir Richard Browne by a daughter of Sir John\r\nPretyman, he was married on 27th June, 1647, by Dr. Earle, chaplain to\r\nthe young Charles, then Prince of Wales, who was holding his court at\r\nSt. Germains. In October he returned by Rouen, Dieppe, and Calais, and\r\n‘got safe to Dover, for which I heartily put up my thanks to God who had\r\nconducted me safe to my owne country, and been mercifull to me through\r\nso many aberrations’ during a period extending over four years. He\r\nreturned alone, ‘leaving my wife, yet very young, under the care of an\r\nexcellent lady and prudent mother.’ Indeed, she was a mere child, being\r\nthen not more than twelve years of age, and her father was only Evelyn’s\r\nsenior by fifteen years.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n_Evelyn’s Attitude during the Commonwealth 1647-1660._\r\n\r\nArrived at Wotton, he at once went to kiss his Majesty’s hand at Hampton\r\nCourt and convey tidings from Paris, King Charles ‘being now in the\r\npower of those execrable villains who not long after murder’d him.’\r\nThence he betook himself to Sayes Court, near Deptford in Kent, the\r\nestate belonging to his father-in-law, where he ‘had a lodging and some\r\nbookes.’ It was here that he was living when his first literary work was\r\npublished, _Of Liberty and Servitude_, a translation from the French of\r\nLe Vayer, in January, 1649, though the dedication of it to his brother\r\nGeorge bears date 25th January, 1647. He was very near getting into\r\ntrouble about the preface to this, because in his own copy he noted that\r\n‘I was like to be call’d in question by the Rebells for this booke,\r\nbeing published a few days before his Majesty’s decollation.’ Although\r\nhe took no prominent part in politics at this particular time, yet he\r\ncould hardly help playing with the fire. Thus, on 11th December, ‘I got\r\nprivately into the council of ye rebell army at Whitehall, where I heard\r\nhorrid villanies.’ Having money in hand, either from savings during the\r\nfour years’ sojourn abroad, where his expenses (including all purchases\r\nof objects of art and vertu) did not amount to more than £300 a year, or\r\nelse from his child-wife’s dowry, he dabbled in land speculation with\r\nthe fairly satisfactory result that on the whole he does not appear to\r\nhave lost much by it.\r\n\r\nOn 17th January, 1649, he ‘heard the rebell Peters incite the rebell\r\npowers met in the Painted Chamber to destroy his Majesty, and saw that\r\narchtraytor Bradshaw, who not long after condemn’d him.’ But his loyalty\r\nkept him from being present at the death-scene. ‘The villanie of the\r\nrebells proceeding now so far as to trie, condemne and murder our\r\nexcellent King on the 30th of this month, struck me with such horror\r\nthat I kept the day of his martyrdom a fast, and would not be present at\r\nthat execrable wickednesse, receiving the sad account of it from my\r\nBrother George and Mr. Owen, who came to visite me this afternoone, and\r\nrecounted all the circumstances.’\r\n\r\nWhile he ‘went through a course of chymestrie at Sayes Court,’ and\r\notherwise engaged in study and in the examination of works of art, he\r\nbecame disquieted about the condition of affairs in Paris.\r\nCommunications with his wife appear to have been very few and far\r\nbetween, although with his father-in-law he ‘kept up a political\r\ncorrespondence’ in cipher ‘with no small danger of being discovered.’ In\r\nApril he touched ‘suddaine resolutions’ of going to France, before he\r\nreceived the news that Condé’s siege of Paris had ended by peace being\r\nconcluded. The immediate carrying out of this intention was hindered by\r\na rush of blood to the brain. ‘I fell dangerously ill of my head: was\r\nblistered and let blood behind ye ears and forehead: on the 23rd. began\r\nto have ease by using the fumes of a cammomile on embers applied to my\r\neares after all the physicians had don their best.’ On 17th June,\r\nhowever, he ‘got a passe from the rebell Bradshaw, then in greate\r\npower,’ and on 12th July went viâ Gravesend to Dover and Calais,\r\narriving at Paris on 1st. August. Curiously enough his Diary makes no\r\nmention of the child-wife, from whom he had ‘been absent.... about a\r\nyeare and a halfe,’ save that on ‘Sept. 7th. Went with my Wife and dear\r\ncosin to St. Germains, and kissed the Queene-mother’s hand.’ He remained\r\nin Paris till the end of June, 1650, when he made a flying visit to\r\nEngland, and again obtained a pass from Bradshaw to proceed to France.\r\nOn 30th August, he was back again in Paris, where he stayed till his\r\nfinal return to England in February 1652. His life in Paris at this time\r\nwas that of a cultured _dilletante_. He studied, or at any rate dabbled\r\nin, chemistry, philosophy, theology, and music; and he found amusement\r\nin examining gardens and collections of all sorts of virtuosities and\r\nantiquities. He had ‘much discourse of chymical matters’ with Sir Kenelm\r\nDigby; ‘but the truth is, Sir Kenelm was an arrant mountebank.’ Here,\r\ntoo, he wrote his second literary composition, _The State of France, as\r\nit stood in the IXth yeer of this present monarch Lewis XIIII_, which\r\nwas published in England in 1652. Apart from these occupations, his time\r\nwas chiefly spent in the pleasures and amusements common to the court\r\nof France and to the throng of exiles from Britain who formed the Court\r\nof the uncrowned monarch, Charles II.\r\n\r\nEvelyn longed for settlement in England, because he saw that the\r\nRoyalist cause was hopelessly lost for the time being. His\r\nfather-in-law’s estate of Sayes Court had been seized and sold by the\r\nrebels, but ‘by the advice and endeavour of my friends I was advis’d to\r\nreside in it, and compound with the soldiers. This I was besides\r\nauthoriz’d by his Majesty to do, and encourag’d with promise that what\r\nwas in lease from the Crowne, if ever it pleased God to restore him, he\r\nwould secure to us in fee-ferme.{xxxi:1} I had also addresses and cyfers\r\nto correspond with his Majesty and Ministers abroad: upon all which\r\ninducements I was persuaded to settle henceforth in England, having now\r\nrun about the world, most part out of my owne country, neere ten yeares.\r\nI therefore now likewise meditated sending over for my Wife, whom as yet\r\nI had left at Paris.’ She arrived on 11th. June with her Mother; and as\r\nsmall-pox was then raging in and about London they sojourned for some\r\ntime at Tunbridge Wells, drinking the waters. About the end of that\r\nmonth Evelyn went to Sayes Court to prepare for their reception, but was\r\nwaylaid by footpads near Bromley and came near meeting his death from\r\nthem. Fortunately, however, ‘did God deliver me from these villains, and\r\nnot onely so, but restor’d what they tooke, as twice before he had\r\ngraciously don, both at sea and land;... for which, and many signal\r\npreservations, I am extreamly oblig’d to give thanks to God my Saviour.’\r\n\r\nOn 24th July, 1652, Mrs. Evelyn presented her husband with their first\r\nchild, their son, John, who predeceased his father in 1698. He now\r\nbusied himself in acquiring full possession of his father-in-law’s and\r\nthe rebels’ interests in Sayes Court, which he effected at a cost of\r\n£3,500 early in 1653.\r\n\r\nThen he began gardening and planting on a large scale, transforming the\r\nalmost bare fields around the house into fine specimens of the art of\r\nhorticulture, as then practised. Sayes Court was afterwards the\r\ntemporary residence of Peter the Great, who committed great havoc in the\r\ngardens and hedges during his rough orgies. Here Evelyn lived quietly\r\ntill the time of the Restoration, spending his days in gardening and in\r\ncultivating the acquaintance of men of cultured tastes like his own,\r\nwith occasional journeys to different parts of England. Thus he visited\r\nWindsor, Marlborough, Bath, Oxford, Salisbury, Devizes, Gloucester,\r\nWorcester, Warwick, Leicester, Doncaster, York, Cambridge, and many\r\nother places, so that he probably saw a great deal more of England than\r\nthe majority of men in his position. Thus, too, he learned much about\r\nthe country and about all branches of rural economy. He had not yet\r\nseriously given himself to literature, although his third work was\r\npublished in 1656, _An Essay on the First Book of T. Lucretius Cerus de\r\nRerum Natura. Interpreted and made English Verse_.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1658, heavy sorrow fell upon Evelyn by the death of his\r\nyounger son, an infant prodigy, and a sad and wonderful example of a\r\nyoung brain being terribly overtaxed. ‘After six fits of a quartan ague\r\nwith which it pleased God to visite him, died my dear Son Richard, to\r\nour inexpressible grief and affliction, 5 yeares and 3 days old onely,\r\nbut at that tender age a prodigy for witt and understanding; for beauty\r\nof body a very angel; for endowment of mind of incredible and rare\r\nhopes. To give onely a little taste of them, and thereby glory to God,\r\nhe had learn’d all this catechisme who out of the mouths of babes and\r\ninfants does sometimes perfect his praises: at 2 years and a halfe old\r\nhe could perfectly read any of ye English, Latine, French, or Gothic\r\nletters, pronouncing the first three languages exactly. He had before\r\nthe 5th yeare, or in that yeare, not onely skill to reade most written\r\nhands, but to decline all the nouns, conjugate the verbs regular, and\r\nmost of ye irregular; learn’d out “Puerilis,” got by heart almost ye\r\nentire vocabularie of Latine and French primitives and words, could make\r\ncongruous syntax, turne English into Latine, and _vice versâ_, construe\r\nand prove what he read, and did the government and use of relatives,\r\nverbs, substantives, elipses, and many figures and tropes, and made a\r\nconsiderable progress in Comenius’s Janua; began himselfe to write\r\nlegibly, and had a stronge passion for Greeke. The number of verses he\r\ncould recite was prodigious, and what he remembered of the parts of\r\nplayes, which he would also act; and when seeing a Plautus in one’s\r\nhand, he ask’d what booke it was, and being told it was comedy, and too\r\ndifficult for him, he wept for sorrow. Strange was his apt and ingenious\r\napplication of fables and morals, for he had read Æsop; he had a\r\nwonderful disposition to mathematics, having by heart divers\r\npropositions of Euclid that were read to him in play, and he would make\r\nlines and demonstrate them. As to his piety, astonishing were his\r\napplications of Scripture upon occasion, and thus early, he understood\r\nye historical part of ye Bible and New Testament to a wonder, how Christ\r\ncame to redeeme mankind, and how comprehending these necessarys\r\nhimselfe, his godfathers were discharg’d of their promise. These and\r\nlike illuminations, far exceeding his age and experience, considering\r\nthe prettinesse of his adresse and behaviour, cannot but leave\r\nimpressions in me at the memory of him. When one told him how many days\r\na Quaker had fasted, he replied that was no wonder, for Christ had said\r\nthat man should not live by bread alone, but by ye Word of God. He would\r\nof himselfe select ye most pathetic psalms, and chapters out of Job, to\r\nreade to his mayde during his sicknesse, telling her when she pitied\r\nhim, that all God’s children must suffer affliction. He declaim’d\r\nagainst ye vanities of the world before he had seene any...... How\r\nthankfully would he receive admonition, how soone be reconciled! how\r\nindifferent, yet continually chereful! He would give grave advice to his\r\nBrother John, beare with his impertinencies, and say he was but a\r\nchild!’ Even allowing for Evelyn’s tendency to exaggeration, this is\r\nsurely one of the very saddest stories about a child of tender years,\r\nreared in a wrong manner, that has ever been written in the English\r\nlanguage. This loss was no doubt the occasion of his writing his fourth\r\nwork, _The Golden Book of St. John Chrysostom, concerning the Education\r\nof Children. Translated out of the Greek_, which was published in\r\nSeptember, 1658. A further relief from grief was also found in the\r\ntranslation of _The French Gardiner: instructing how to cultivate all\r\nsorts of Fruit-trees and Herbs for the Garden; together with directions\r\nto dry and conserve them in their natural; six times printed in France\r\nand once in Holland. An accomplished piece, first written by N. de\r\nBonnefons, and now transplanted into English by Philocepos_.\r\n\r\nIt must have gratified his royalist feelings when, on 22 Oct. 1658, he\r\n‘saw ye superb funerall of ye Protector.’ He remarks that ‘it was the\r\njoyfullest funerall I ever saw, for there were none that cried but dogs,\r\nwhich the soldiers hooted away with a barbarous noise, drinking and\r\ntaking tobacco in the streets as they went.’ Not long after this, on 25\r\nApril 1659, he notices ‘a wonderfull and suddaine change in ye face of\r\nye publiq: ye new Protector Richard slighted, several pretenders and\r\nparties strive for the government: all anarchy and confusion; Lord have\r\nmercy on us!’ For six months things drifted on, till on 11 Oct. ‘the\r\nArmie now turn’d out the Parliament. We had now no government in the\r\nnation; all in confusion; no magistrate either own’d or pretended, but\r\nye soldiers, and they not agreed. God almighty have mercy on and settle\r\nus!’\r\n\r\nEvelyn apparently now thought the time ripe for him to venture; hence,\r\nduring 1659, he published _A Character of England as it was lately\r\npresented in a Letter to a Noble Man of France_, and also _An Apology\r\nfor the Royal Party, written in a Letter to a person of the late Council\r\nof State, by a Lover of Peace and of his Country. With a Touch at the\r\nPretended “Plea for the Army_.” Of the latter he remarks in his Diary:\r\n‘Nov. 7th. was publish’d my bold “Apoligie for the King” in this time of\r\ndanger, when it was capital to speake or write in favour of him. It was\r\ntwice printed, so universaly it took.’ Encouraged by the success of this\r\nwork, he began to intrigue with Colonel Morley, Lieutenant of the Tower,\r\nand Fay, Governor of Portsmouth, in the interest of the exiled Charles;\r\nbut Morley shrank from declaring for the King, and General Monk\r\nreturning from Scotland to London, broke down the gates of the city,\r\n‘marches to White-hall, dissipates that nest of robbers, and convenes\r\nthe old Parliament, the Rump Parliament (so called as retaining some few\r\nrotten members of ye other) being dissolv’d; and for joy whereoff were\r\nmany thousands of rumps roasted publiqly in ye streets at the bonfires\r\nthis night, with ringing of bells and universal jubilee. This was the\r\nfirst good omen.’\r\n\r\nFrom the February till the April following thereon Evelyn was confined\r\nto bed with ague and its after effects, but found strength to write and\r\npublish a pamphlet, _The late News from Brussels unmasked, and His\r\nMajesty vindicated from the base calumny and scandal therein fixed on\r\nhim_, ‘in defence of his Majesty, against a wicked forg’d paper,\r\npretended to be sent from Bruxells to defame his Majesties person and\r\nvertues, and render him odious, now when everybody was in hope and\r\nexpectation of the General and Parliament recalling him, and\r\nestablishing ye government on its antient and right basis.’ Early in May\r\ncame the tidings that the King’s application for restoration had been\r\naccepted and acknowledged by the Parliament ‘after a most bloudy and\r\nunreasonable rebellion of neare 20 years,’ and before the end of the\r\nmonth Evelyn was an eye-witness of the triumphal entry of the new king\r\ninto his capital. ‘29th. This day his Majestie Charles the Second came\r\nto London after a sad and long exile and calamitous suffering both of\r\nthe King and Church, being 17 years. This was also his birthday, and\r\nwith a triumph of above 20,000 horse and foote, brandishing their swords\r\nand shouting with inexpressible joy; the wayes strew’d with flowers, the\r\nbells ringing, the streets hung with tapissry, fountaines running with\r\nwine; the Maior, Aldermen, and all the Companies in their liveries,\r\nchaines of gold, and banners; Lords and Nobles clad in cloth of silver,\r\ngold, and velvet; the windowes and balconies all set with ladies;\r\ntrumpets, music, and myriads of people flocking, even so far as from\r\nRochester, so as they were seven houres in passing the citty, even from\r\n2 in ye afternoone till 9 at night. I stood in the Strand and beheld it,\r\nand bless’d God. And all this was don without one drop of bloud shed,\r\nand by that very army which rebell’d against him; but it was ye Lord’s\r\ndoing, for such a restoration was never mention’d in any history antient\r\nor modern, since the returne of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity;\r\nnor so joyfull a day and so bright ever seene in this nation, this\r\nhapning when to expect or effect it was past all human policy.’\r\n\r\nDespite his dilettantism and dabbling in science, philosophy and\r\nletters, Evelyn had for years past felt the desirability of having some\r\nsort of fixed employment. Previous to this, during 1659, he had\r\ncommunicated to the Hon. Robert Boyle, son of the Earl of Cork, a scheme\r\nfor founding a philosophic and mathematical college or fraternity, and\r\nhad even arranged with his wife that they should live asunder, in two\r\nseparate apartments. The Restoration, however, put a stop to this\r\nscheme, which then evolved itself, soon afterwards, into the foundation\r\nof the Royal Society, Boyle and Evelyn being two of the most prominent\r\noriginal Fellows.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n_Evelyn’s Career after the Restoration. (1660-1685)._\r\n\r\nEvelyn was about forty years of age when the Restoration changed the\r\nwhole prospects of his still long life. He had been a devoted Royalist,\r\nthough it can not be denied that his zeal in this respect was ever\r\ntempered with a vast amount of caution and prudence. In addition to what\r\ninterest he had earned by his own actions, he had the far more powerful\r\ninfluence of his father-in-law who had, like Charles himself, been\r\nexiled for nineteen years. Mrs. Evelyn was promised the appointment of\r\nlady of the jewels to the future Queen, which she never received; and\r\nEvelyn might have had the honour of knighthood of the Bath, but declined\r\nit. He was present at the Coronation in Westminster Abbey on St.\r\nGeorge’s Day, 1661, and had prepared and printed a _Panegyric_ poem on\r\nthe occasion, a screed of bombastic doggerel in fulsome praise of the\r\nKing. He was a frequent visitor at the Court, and loved to sun himself\r\nin the royal presence. One of the finest examples of this feature of\r\nEvelyn’s character is his _Fumifugium_, published in 1661, which will be\r\nmore particularly referred to later on, a work which marks the real\r\ncommencement of his literary career.\r\n\r\nIn 1661, also, Evelyn wrote a pamphlet entitled _Tyrannus or the Mode_,\r\nan invective against ‘our so much affecting the French’ in dress, and he\r\nwas pleased with the idea that afterwards, in 1666, a change in costume\r\nthen adopted by the King and court was due to this cause. He, too,\r\ndonned and went to office in ‘the vest and surcoat and tunic as ’twas\r\ncall’d, after his Majesty had brought the whole Court to it. It was a\r\ncomely and manly habit, too good to hold, it being impossible for us in\r\ngood earnest to leave ye Monsieurs vanities long.’\r\n\r\nAt length employment, at first unpaid, in the public service fell to\r\nEvelyn in May, 1662, when along with ‘divers gentlemen of quality,’ he\r\nwas appointed one of the Commissioners ‘for reforming the buildings,\r\nwayes, streetes, and incumbrances, and regulating the hackney coaches in\r\nthe Citty of London.’ About this same time he was also on the Commission\r\nappointed ‘about Charitable uses, and particularly to enquire how the\r\nCitty had dispos’d of the revenues of Gressham College,’ and in the\r\noriginal grant of the Charter of the Royal Society he was nominated by\r\nthe King to be on its Council. Among the other Commissions upon which he\r\nshortly sat were those on Sewers, and on the regulation of the Mint at\r\nthe Tower; but it was not till 27 Oct. 1664 that he received a paid\r\nappointment as one of the four Commissioners for the care of the sick\r\nand wounded prisoners to be made in the war declared against Holland.\r\nFor this the remuneration was ‘a Salary £1,200 a year amongst us,\r\nbesides extraordinaries for our care and attention in time of station,\r\neach of us being appointed to a particular district, mine falling out to\r\nbe Kent and Sussex.’\r\n\r\nBefore this, however, an event had occurred which must have given\r\nintense gratification to Evelyn, when on 30th April, 1663, ‘Came his\r\nMajesty to honour my poore villa with his presence, viewing the gardens\r\nand even every roome of the house, and was pleas’d to take a small\r\nrefreshment. There were with him the Duke of Richmond, E. of St. Albans,\r\nLord Lauderdale, and several persons of Quality.’\r\n\r\nThe year 1664 was a busy one for Evelyn, as he then brought out his two\r\ngreat masterpieces _Sylva_ and the _Kalendarium Hortense_, of which more\r\nanon, as well as the translation of a French work on Architecture. His\r\nofficial duties in connection with the maintainance of the Dutch\r\nprisoners also became so heavy that the charges came to £1,000 a week.\r\nThe Savoy Hospital was filled with them, and a privy seal grant of\r\n£20,000 was made to carry on the work; but the expenses increasing\r\nreached £7,000 a week, and Evelyn had hard work to get money from the\r\ntreasury. Harassed with anxieties of this sort, he frequently went ‘to\r\nye Royal Society to refreshe among ye philosophers’ where he found\r\nsolace in serving along with Dryden, Waller, and others on a Committee\r\nfor the improvement of the English language.\r\n\r\nIn the following year the dreadful plague broke out, when he and one\r\nother Commissioner were left to deal with the task of providing for the\r\nsick and wounded prisoners. From 1,000 deaths in a week in the middle of\r\nJuly, the mortality increased to near 10,000 by the beginning of\r\nSeptember, so he sent his wife and family to his brother at Wotton, and\r\nremained at work, ‘being resolved to stay at my house myselfe; and to\r\nlooke after my charge, trusting in the providence and goodnesse of God.’\r\nPrisoners poured in in larger numbers than he could receive and guard in\r\nfit places, and he was continually forced to importune for money lest\r\nthe prisoners should starve. It was then, perhaps, that Evelyn was\r\nthrown most in contact with his intimate friend Pepys, for both of them\r\nremained steadfast when others had fled. And they had their reward in\r\ncoming safely through their trial of faithfulness to official duty. ‘Now\r\nblessed be God,’ he writes on 31 Dec. 1665, ‘for his extraordinary\r\nmercies and preservation of me this yeare, when thousands and ten\r\nthousands perish’d and were swept away on each side of me.’\r\n\r\nThis hard work was a source of loss to Evelyn, as from time to time he\r\nadvanced monies of his own to supply provisions for the needy committed\r\nto his care: and subsequent petitions for reinbursement were only\r\npartially successful. But he was rewarded by the sunny warmth of that\r\nroyal favour which cost nothing, because when the King returned from\r\nOxford to Hampton Court and Evelyn went to wait upon his Majesty there\r\nat the end of January, 1666, he duly records how ‘he ran towards me, and\r\nin a most gracious manner gave me his hand to kisse, with many thanks\r\nfor my care and faithfulnesse in his service in a time of such greate\r\ndanger, when every body fled their employments.’ Poor Evelyn seems to\r\nhave been rather easily duped in this sort of way. ‘Then the Duke (of\r\nAlbemarle) came towards me and embrac’d me with much kindnesse, telling\r\nme if he had thought my danger would have been so greate, he would not\r\nhave suffer’d his Majesty to employ me in that station.’ And so on,\r\n‘after which I got home, not being very well in health.’ It certainly\r\nwas such ridiculously insincere treatment that it might well have caused\r\nimmediate sickening in one of robust health.\r\n\r\nIt was, forsooth, only in very minor matters that Evelyn profited by the\r\nroyal favour or by his courtiership. In April, 1666, Charles informed\r\nhim that he must now be sworn for a Justice of the Peace, (‘the office\r\nin the world I had most industriously avoided, in regard of the\r\nperpetual trouble thereoff in these numerous parishes’), and he only\r\nescaped this infliction by humbly desiring to be excused from fresh\r\nduties inconsistent with the other service he was engaged in. So excused\r\nhe was, by royal favour, for which he ‘rendered his Majesty many\r\nthanks.’ And on that same day he declined re-election to the Council of\r\nthe Royal Society for the following year on ‘earnest suite’ of other\r\naffairs; for he had to be consistent in such different matters that\r\nwould have engaged a portion of his time.\r\n\r\nBesides his work in connection with prisoners and the Mint he was\r\nshortly afterwards nominated one of the Commissioners for regulating the\r\nfarming and making of saltpetre and gunpowder throughout Britain, an\r\nappointment which was all the more appropriate from the fact that his\r\ngrandfather, George Evelyn of Long Ditton and Wotton (1530-1603), had\r\nbeen the first to introduce the manufacture of gunpowder into England,\r\nwhen he established mills on both of his properties. He was also\r\nappointed one of the three Surveyors of the repairs of St. Paul’s\r\nCathedral, ‘and to consider of a model for the new building, or, if it\r\nmight be, repairing of the steeple, which was most decay’d.’\r\n\r\nWith hands and head fully occupied with business affairs he found time\r\nfor other work of a useful nature, while still having plenty of leisure\r\nfor social duties and enjoyments. In this respect he forms a good\r\nexample of the well-known truth that it is always the busiest men who\r\ncan spare most time for matters lying outside of their special grooves\r\nof work. Thus in September, 1665, he drew up a scheme for erecting an\r\ninfirmary at Chatham, in which he was supported by his friend Pepys,\r\nthen a high official in the Navy Department and like himself a shrewd\r\nman of business and method, and therefore finding time for other than\r\npurely routine official work; while in August, 1666, he entreated the\r\nLord Chancellor ‘to visite the Hospital of the Savoy, and reduce it\r\n(after ye greate abuse that had been continu’d) to its original\r\ninstitution for ye benefit of the poore, which he promis’d to do.’\r\n\r\nBut nothing came from either of these schemes, for on 2nd. Sept. ‘this\r\nfatal night about ten, began the deplorable fire neere Fish Streete in\r\nLondon.’ It raged by day and by night,--‘(if I may call that night which\r\nwas light as day for 10 miles round about, after a dreadful manner).’\r\nNothing could be done to stay its progress, and the citizens were\r\nawe-stricken and paralyzed by fear. ‘The conflagration was so universal,\r\nand the people so astonish’d, that from the beginning, I know not by\r\nwhat despondency or fate, they hardly stirr’d to quench it, so that\r\nthere was nothing heard or seene but crying out and lamentation, running\r\nabout like distracted creatures without at all attempting to save even\r\ntheir goods; such a strange consternation there was upon them, so as it\r\nburned both in breadth and length, the churches, publics halls,\r\nExchange, hospitals, monuments, and ornaments, leaping after a\r\nprodigious manner, from house to house and streete to streete, at great\r\ndistances one from ye other; for ye heate with a long set of faire and\r\nwarm weather had even ignited the aire and prepar’d the materials to\r\nconceive the fire, which devour’d after an incredible manner houses,\r\nfurniture, and every thing. Here we saw the Thames cover’d with goods\r\nfloating, all the barges and boats laden with what some had time and\r\ncourage to save, as, on ye other, ye carts etc., carrying out to the\r\nfields, which for many miles were strew’d with moveables of all sorts,\r\nand tents erecting to shelter both people and what goods they could get\r\naway. Oh the miserable and calamitous spectacle! such as happly the\r\nworld had not seene since the foundation of it, nor be outdon till the\r\nuniversal conflagration thereof. All the skie was of a fiery aspect,\r\nlike the top of a burning oven, and the light seene above 40 miles round\r\nabout for many nights. God grant mine eyes may never behold the like,\r\nwho now saw above 10,000 houses all in one flame; the noise and cracking\r\nand thunder of the impetuous flames, ye shreiking of women and children,\r\nthe hurry of people, the fall of towers, houses, and churches, was like\r\nan hideous storme, and the aire all about so hot and inflam’d that at\r\nthe last one was not able to approach it, so that they were forc’d to\r\nstand and let ye flames burn on, which they did for neere two miles in\r\nlengh and one in breadh. The clowds also of smoke were dismall and\r\nreach’d upon computation neer 50 miles in length. Thus I left it this\r\nafternoone burning, a resemblance of Sodom, or the last day. It forcibly\r\ncall’d to my mind that passage--_non enim hic habemus stabilem\r\ncivitatem_: the ruines resembling the picture of Troy. London was, but\r\nis no more! Thus I returned.’\r\n\r\nFor days the conflagration raged, although the whole situation might\r\nprobably have been saved if the advice of seamen, then as now amongst\r\nthe bravest and most practical of Britain’s sons, had been followed.\r\nWhen the court suburb of Whitehall began to be threatened,--‘but oh, the\r\nconfusion there was then at the Court!’--the gentlemen, ‘who hitherto\r\nhad stood as men intoxicated, with their hands acrosse,.... began to\r\nconsider that nothing was likely to put a stop but the blowing up of so\r\nmany houses as might make a wider gap than any had yet been made by the\r\nordinary method of pulling them downe with engines; this some stout\r\nseamen propros’d early enough to have sav’d neere ye whole citty, but\r\nthis some tenacious and avaritious men, aldermen, etc., would not\r\npermitt, because their houses must have been of the first.’ At length,\r\nhowever, the fire died out, the houseless citizens finding refuge in\r\ntents and miserable huts and hovels hastily erected about St. George’s\r\nfields and Moorfields as far as Highgate. But Evelyn’s abode had\r\nremained untouched. From reviewing the now poverty-striken people ‘in\r\nthis calamitous condition I return’d with a sad heart to my house,\r\nblessing and adoring the distinguishing mercy of God to me and mine, who\r\nin the midst of all this ruine was like Lot, in my little Zoar, safe\r\nand sound.’\r\n\r\nThe plague and the fire were held to be the visitation of God’s anger,\r\nand Evelyn evidently thought the heavy punishment richly merited. ‘Oct.\r\n10th. This day was order’d a generall fast thro’ the Nation, to humble\r\nus on ye late dreadfull conflagration, added to the plague and warr, the\r\nmost dismall judgments that could be inflicted, but whiche indeed we\r\nhighly deserv’d for our prodigious ingratitude, burning lusts, dissolute\r\nCourt, profane and abominable lives, under such dispensations of God’s\r\ncontinu’d favour in restoring Church, Prince, and People from our late\r\nintestine calamities, of which we were altogether unmindfull, even to\r\nastonishment.’\r\n\r\nLike Wren and Hooke, Evelyn submitted a scheme for the rebuilding of\r\nLondon upon an improved plan, but the new city was formed mainly upon\r\nthe old lines.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Dutch fleet was lying off the mouth of the Thames. Though\r\nEngland then happily produced all the food she required, yet the city\r\nbecame ‘exceedingly distress’d for want of fuell’ because of the traffic\r\nup and down the estuary being interrupted. Hence Evelyn was appointed\r\none of a Committee to search the environs of London and find if any peat\r\nor turf were fit for use. Experiments were made with _houllies_ or\r\nbriquettes of charcoal dust and loam in the Dutch manner, and Evelyn\r\nshewed to many proof of his ‘new fuell, which was very glowing and\r\nwithout smoke or ill smell’. But the process never caught on, and was\r\nabandoned as giving no promise of commercial success.\r\n\r\nEvelyn’s account against the Treasury now amounted to above £34,000, and\r\nhe continued to urge for payment of it, or for the settlement of unpaid\r\nportions of it, as late as 1702, about three years before his death.\r\nWhether this straitened his means or not, he was at any rate eager to\r\nmake money by speculation. So in 1667 he joined Sir John Kiviet, a Dutch\r\nOrangeman who had come over to England for protection and had been\r\nknighted by King Charles, in a scheme for making bricks on a large\r\nscale. Perhaps as a sort of advertisement of this commercial enterprise\r\nhe subscribed 50,000 bricks towards building a college for the Royal\r\nSociety. It was a big scheme, including the embankment of the river from\r\nthe Tower to the Temple, and if successful it would have brought much\r\ngain to the partners.\r\n\r\nEvelyn says nothing about the ultimate results of his undertaking, but\r\nPepys furnishes the necessary clue in his diary for September,\r\n1668--‘23d. At noon comes Mr Evelyn to me, about some business with the\r\noffice, and there in discourse tell me of his loss, to the value of\r\n£500, which he hath met with in a late attempt of making of bricks upon\r\nan adventure with others, by which he presumed to have got a great deal\r\nof money; so that I see the most ingenious man may sometimes be\r\nmistaken’. Kiviet a year or two later on had a fresh scheme for draining\r\nmarshy lands ‘with the hopes of a rich harvest of hemp and cole seed’,\r\nbut Evelyn took no share in this new adventure.\r\n\r\nIn July 1669 his University, Oxford, bestowed upon him the honorary\r\ndegree of Doctor of Civil Law, but he had still no permanent official\r\nappointment, his Commissionerships now being completed. Early in May\r\n1670 he went ‘to London concerning the office of Latine Secretary to his\r\nMajesty, a place of more honor than dignitie and profit, the revertion\r\nof which he had promised me’, though the promise was not fulfilled.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1669, it had been proposed to Evelyn by Lord Arlington that he\r\nshould write a history of the Dutch War, but he declined. Towards the\r\nmiddle of the following year, however, pressure was brought on him to\r\nundertake the work. ‘After dinner Lord (Arlington) communicated to me\r\nhis Majesty’s desire that I would engage to write the History of our\r\nlate War with the Hollanders, which I had hitherto declin’d; this I\r\nfound was ill-taken, and that I should disoblige his Majesty, who had\r\nmade choice of me to do him this service, and if I would undertake it, I\r\nshould have all the assistance the Secretary’s office and others could\r\ngive me, with other encouragements, which I could not decently refuse’.\r\nThis work was never completed, so much as was written by way of\r\nintroduction being subsequently published in 1674 as _Navigation and\r\nCommerce, their Original and Progress_.\r\n\r\nEvelyn was, however, not to have much longer to wait for regular\r\nofficial employment, as on 28 February, 1671, ‘The Treasurer acquainted\r\nme that his Majesty was graciously pleas’d to nominate me one of the\r\nCouncil of Forraine Plantations, and give me a salary of £500 per ann.\r\nto encourage me’. He was pleased with his appointment in connection with\r\nour Colonies, ‘a considerable honour, the others in the Council being\r\nchiefly Noblemen, and Officers of State’. In the following year the\r\nscope of this department was increased by adding the Council of Trade to\r\nits duties. He at once went to thank the Treasurer and Lord Arlington,\r\nSecretary of State, whose favour he possessed though he ‘cultivated\r\nneither of their friendships by any meane submissions’. And he failed\r\nnot, of course, to kiss the King’s hand on being made one of that newly\r\nestablished Council. But Royalist though he was, he could not be blind\r\nto the profligacy of the Court and of the King, to whose Majesty his\r\nworks were so grandiloquently dedicated.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion after submitting progress of his History to the King, he\r\nsays ‘thence walk’d with him thro’ St. James’s Parke to the garden,\r\nwhere I both saw and heard a very familiar discourse between... and Mrs.\r\nNellie as they cal’d an impudent comedian, she looking out of her garden\r\non a terrace at the top of the wall, and... standing on ye greene walke\r\nunder it. I was heartily sorry at the scene. Thence the King walked to\r\nthe Dutchess of Cleaveland, another lady of pleasure, and curse of our\r\nnation’. Evelyn is usually so strict about any reference to the\r\nproprieties that it is hard to understand why this particular interview\r\nbetween King Charles and Nell Gwynne should be mentioned so\r\ncircumstantially. As for the Court, when it went abroad, say to\r\nNewmarket, one might have ‘found ye jolly blades racing, dauncing,\r\nfeasting, and revelling, more resembling a luxurious and abandon’d rout,\r\nthan a Christian Court.’\r\n\r\nEarly in 1672 his father-in-law, Sir Richard Browne, resigned office as\r\nClerk of the Council, a place which his Majesty had years before\r\npromised to Evelyn; but he was induced to give up this lien on renewal\r\nof the lease of Sayes Court for 99 years, although the King’s written\r\nengagement to grant the estate in fee-farme is still extant at Wotton.\r\nIn 1673 Browne became Master of the Trinity House, and Evelyn was sworn\r\nin as a younger Brother, having in the previous autumn been chosen\r\nSecretary to the Royal Society: and two months later his son John, now\r\n18 years of age, was also made a younger brother of Trinity House.\r\nEvelyn’s life seems now to have glided on very quietly. Much of his time\r\nwas taken up with the colonial and commercial work controlled by the\r\nCouncil of Plantations and Trade, though he still found leisure for\r\nliterary work, scientific recreation, and other affairs. His mind\r\napparently about this time became greatly attracted towards religious\r\nsubjects, and it seems more than probable that this may (in part, at any\r\nrate) have been due to a very strong though purely platonic attachment\r\nhe now formed to Miss Blagg, one of the Queen’s Maids of Honour, who\r\nmarried Mr. Sydney, afterwards Lord Godolphin, in 1675 and died in\r\nchildbed in 1678 at the early age of twenty five. His _Life of Mrs\r\nGodolphin_, never published till 1847, was ‘design’d to consecrate her\r\nworthy life to posterity.’ In February 1680 his son John, now 23 years\r\nof age and imitating his father’s literary beginning as a translator,\r\nwas married to Martha Spencer, step-daughter of Sir John Stonehouse.\r\nThat Evelyn was now fairly well off is evident from the terms of the\r\njointure and marriage contracts then made. ‘The lady was to bring £5,000\r\nin consideration of a settlement of £500 a yeare present maintainence,\r\nwhich was likewise to be her jointure, and £500 a yeare after myne and\r\nmy Wife’s decease. But with God’s blessing it will be at the least £1000\r\na yeare more in a few yeares.’ Always of business habits, Evelyn\r\nparticularly records how, in the following month, he went ‘To London, to\r\nreceive £3,000 of my daughter-in-law’s portion, which was paid in gold.’\r\n\r\nThe deeply religious caste of thought above alluded to as now becoming\r\nvery noticeable in Evelyn shewed itself strongly in the autumn of 1680.\r\n‘I went to London to be private, my birthday being ye next day, and I\r\nnow arriv’d at my sixtieth year, on which I began a more solemn survey\r\nof my whole life, in order to the making and confirming my peace with\r\nGod, by an accurate scrutinie of all my actions past, as far as I was\r\nable to call them to mind. How difficult and uncertaine, yet how\r\nnecessary a work! The Lord be mercifull to me and accept me! Who can\r\ntell how oft he offendeth?... I began and spent the whole weeke in\r\nexamining my life, begging pardon for my faults, assistance and blessing\r\nfor the future, that I might in some sort be prepar’d for the time that\r\nnow drew neere, and not have the greater work to begin when one can\r\nworke no longer. The Lord Jesus help and assist me! I therefore stirr’d\r\nlittle abroad till the 5 November..... I participated of ye blessed\r\ncommunion, finishing and confirming my resolutions of giving myselfe up\r\nmore intirely to God, to whom I had now most solemnly devoted the rest\r\nof the poore remainder of life in this world; the Lord enabling me, who\r\nam an unprofitable servant, a miserable sinner, yet depending on his\r\ninfinite goodnesse and mercy accepting my endeavours.’\r\n\r\nIt were well if all men, even before attaining 60 years of age, could\r\nbring themselves to such periods of reflection on past and present acts,\r\nand even though all the good resolves may not have been quite rigidly\r\nacted up to. And even in Evelyn’s case, at any rate so far as his diary\r\nshews, he appears afterwards to have continued just as much a man of the\r\nworld as he was before these solemn resolutions, although the glamour of\r\nbeing a courtier seems perhaps to have henceforth become less\r\nrose-coloured. A trivial incident happening while he was supping one\r\nnight at Lady Arlington’s, in June 1683, gave rise to the reflection\r\nthat ‘By this one may take an estimate of the extream slavery and\r\nsubjection that courtiers live in, who have not time to eate and drink\r\nat their pleasure. It put me in mind of Horace’s Mouse, and to blesse\r\nGod for my owne private condition.’ Twenty years previously he would not\r\nhave thought or said this.\r\n\r\nEvelyn took a leading part in the negociations for the repurchase of\r\nChelsea College for £1,300 from the Royal Society to whom it had been\r\nrecently presented by the King, and for the establishment of a hospital\r\nfor old soldiers there at a cost of £20,000 with an endowment of £5,000\r\na year.\r\n\r\nSeveral violent fits of ague having afflicted him during the winter of\r\n1681-82, to cure which ‘recourse was had to bathing my legs in milk up\r\nto ye knees, made as hot as I could endure it’, Evelyn made his will\r\nand put all his affairs in order ‘that now growing in yeares, I might\r\nhave none of the secular things and concerns to distract me when it\r\nshould please Almighty God to call me from this transitory life’. In\r\nNovember 1682 he was asked by many friends to stand for election as\r\npresident of the Royal Society, in succession to Sir Christopher Wren,\r\nbut pleading ‘remote dwelling, and now frequent infirmities’ he declined\r\nthe proffered honour. Subsequently, in 1690, he had actually, ‘been\r\nchosen President of the Royal Society’, but desired to decline it ‘and\r\nwith greate difficulty devolv’d the election on Sir Robert Southwell,\r\nSecretary of State to King William in Ireland.’ For a third time, in\r\nNovember 1693, the honour was again offered--‘Much importun’d to take\r\nthe office of President of the Royal Society, but I againe declin’d it.’\r\n\r\nOn 12th February 1683 his father-in-law, Sir Richard Browne, who had\r\nbeen created a baronet in 1649, and to whose influence he owed much,\r\ndied at his house at Sayes Court, leaving Mrs. Evelyn as his sole\r\nheiress. Meanwhile grandchildren had been born to Evelyn, some of whom\r\nsoon died in infancy. His appointment on the Council of Plantations and\r\nTrade seems to have lapsed before this time, for no further mention is\r\nmade in his diary of Council meetings, and he seems to have resided\r\nchiefly at Sayes Court, gardening and spending his time in scholarly\r\nleisure and recreation. This surmise is borne out by what he says in\r\n1683, ‘Oct. 4th. I went to London, on receiving a note from the\r\nCountesse of Arlington, of some considerable charge or advantage I might\r\nobtaine by applying myselfe to his Majesty on this signal conjuncture of\r\nhis Majesty entering up judgment against the City charter; the proposal\r\nmade me I wholly declin’d, not being well satisfied with these violent\r\ntransactions, and not a little sorry that his Majesty was so often put\r\nupon things of this nature against so great a Citty, the consequence\r\nwheroff may be so much to his prejudice; so I return’d home.’\r\n\r\nOn 6th February 1685 King Charles II. died after an apoplectic fit, and\r\nhis brother James, Duke of York, ascended the throne. Evelyn comments\r\nfully on the virtues and vices of the late monarch. ‘He would doubtless\r\nhave been an excellent Prince had he been less addicted to women, who\r\nmade him uneasy, and allways in want to supply their immeasurable\r\nprofusion, to ye detriment of many indigent persons who had signaly\r\nserv’d both him and his father..... He was ever kind to me, and very\r\ngracious upon all occasions, and therefore I cannot, without\r\ningratitude, but deplore his loss, which for many respects, as well as\r\nduty, I do with all my soul.’\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n_Evelyn’s Declining Years_ (1685-1706).\r\n\r\nWith the accession of James II., Evelyn was again to feel the sunny\r\nwarmth of royal favour in the form of an official appointment. But\r\nprevious to this he had to suffer a heavy loss by the death from\r\nsmall-pox of his eldest daughter Mary, in the 19th year of her age, who\r\nhad been born at Wotton in the same room as her father had first seen\r\nthe light.\r\n\r\nIn September 1685 Evelyn was informed that on Lord Clarendon, Lord Privy\r\nSeal, going to assume the Lord Lieutenancy of Ireland the King had\r\nnominated him as one of the Commissioners to execute the office of Privy\r\nSeal during such appointment; and early in December he was ‘put into the\r\nnew Commission of Sewers.’ It was nearly Christmas before he kissed\r\nhands on receiving the patent for executing this office and entered on\r\nits duties along with the two other Commissioners. They performed these\r\ntill the 10th March 1687, when the King relieved them with compliments\r\non their ‘faithfull and loyal service, with many gracious expressions to\r\nthis effect’, and bestowed the seal on Lord Arundel of Wardour, a\r\nzealous Roman Catholic.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of James II’s reign the patronage which seemed to be\r\ncoming in Evelyn’s direction appears to have, not unnaturally perhaps,\r\nsomewhat coloured his opinion as to the new monarch’s capacity and\r\ndisposition. After a journey undertaken with Pepys to Windsor,\r\nWinchester, and Portsmouth in September 1685, whither the King went to\r\nview the state of the fortifications, he recorded that ‘what I observ’d\r\nin this journey, is that infinite industry, sedulity, gravity, and\r\ngreate understanding and experience of affairs, in his Majesty, that I\r\ncannot but predict much happiness to ye nation, as to its political\r\ngovernment; and if he so persist, there could be nothing more desir’d to\r\naccomplish our prosperity, but that he was of the national church.’\r\nBiassed and prejudiced in the royal favour as he then temporarily was,\r\nthis account of King James proved so totally incorrect that it is a\r\nwonder Evelyn retained it in the compilation which he left as his\r\n_Diary_. The only explanation seems to be that he wished to record his\r\nprevision as regards Roman Catholicism proving the main rock upon which\r\nthe King might come to grief, as he afterwards did.\r\n\r\nTitus Oates’ conspiracy and the Duke of Monmouth’s invasion and\r\ninsurrection went by without affecting Evelyn much. He was in the latter\r\ncase called upon to supply a mounted trooper, which he did rather\r\ngrudgingly. ‘The two horsemen which my son and myselfe sent into the\r\ncounty troopes, were now come home, after a moneth’s being out to our\r\ngreate charge.’ But what concerned him much more was that matters\r\nfrequently came before the Commission of the Privy Seal to which he\r\ncould not, on religious grounds principally, give his assent. On such\r\noccasions he would sometimes go to his house in the country, ‘refusing\r\nto be present at what was to passe at the Privy Seale the next day’,\r\nbecause any two out of the three Commissioners formed a quorum. At other\r\ntimes, however, he had to face his responsibility properly, by refusing\r\nto put his seal to the papers in question, while noting his objections\r\nto the course of action proposed. The Papistry which was spreading over\r\nthe country under the King’s influence seemed to darken the land and to\r\nobscure the future. ‘Popish Justices of the Peace establish’d in all\r\ncounties, of the meanest of the people; Judges ignorant of the law, and\r\nperverting it--so furiously do the Jesuits drive, and even compel\r\nPrinces to violent courses, and destruction of an excellent government\r\nboth in Church and State. God of his infinite mercy open our eyes and\r\nturn our hearts, and establish his truth with peace! The Lord Jesus\r\ndefend his little flock, and preserve this threaten’d Church and\r\nNation.’\r\n\r\nA staunch Protestant, Evelyn no longer possessed the King’s favour, and\r\nhenceforth he received no further appointment or token of royal approval\r\nalthough he still frequented the Court at Whitehall. In August 1688 he\r\nwas secretly informed by the Rev. Dr. Tenison, afterwards Bishop of\r\nLincoln, of the impending invasion of the Prince of Orange, and, while\r\nregularly paying his duty as a courtier, he informed the lately\r\nimprisoned Archbishop and Bishops of the intrigues on which the Jesuits\r\nwere hard at work. And subsequently ‘My Lord of Canterbury gave me great\r\nthanks for the advertisement I sent him in October, and assured me they\r\ntook my counsell in that particular, and that it came very seasonably.’\r\nOn 18th December, he ‘saw the King take barge to Gravesend at 12\r\no’clock--a sad sight,’ on the very day that the Prince of Orange came to\r\nSt. James and filled Whitehall with Dutch guards. All the world at once\r\nwent to pay court to the Prince whose star was now in the ascendant:\r\nand, of course, Evelyn went too. A couple of months later he ‘saw _the\r\nnew Queene_ and _King_ proclaim’d the very next day after her coming to\r\nWhitehall, Wednesday 13 Feb., with greate acclamations and generall good\r\nreception.... It was believ’d that both, especially the Princesse, would\r\nhave shew’d some (seeming) reluctance at least, of assuming her father’s\r\nCrown, and some apology, testifying her regret that he should by his\r\nmismanagement necessitate the Nation to so extraordinary a proceeding,\r\nwhich would have shew’d very handsomely to the world, and according to\r\nthe character given by her piety; consonant also to her husband’s first\r\ndecleration, that there was no intention of deposing the King, but of\r\nsuccouring the Nation; but nothing of all this appear’d; she came into\r\nWhite-hall laughing and jolly, as to a wedding, so as to seem quite\r\ntransported..... This carriage was censured by many.’\r\n\r\nAfter the Restoration Evelyn’s life as a courtier was practically at an\r\nend, as he never quite approved the enforced abdication of King James.\r\nSo henceforth he spent his time, without further attendance at Court or\r\nseeking after office or appointment, in study, literary work, and\r\nretirement. He did not like the new régime, with its ‘Court offices\r\ndistributed amongst Parliament men.... Things far from settled as was\r\nexpected, by reason of the slothfull, sickly temper of the new King, and\r\nthe Parliament’s unmindfullness of Ireland, which is likely to prove a\r\nsad omission.’ He even seems to have regretted that his son was in March\r\n1692 made ‘one of the Commissioners of the Revenue and Treasury of\r\nIreland, to which employment he had a mind far from my wishes.’ This son\r\ncontracted serious illness in Ireland, and died ‘after a tedious\r\nlanguishing sickness’ early in 1699, aged 44 years, leaving one son,\r\nthen a student at Oxford.\r\n\r\nSome time before this his elder brother, George, having lost his last\r\nson and heir, had settled the Wotton estate upon John Evelyn. In May\r\n1694, yielding to the request to make Wotton his home, he went to\r\nWotton, leaving Sayes Court in charge of his daughter Susanna and her\r\nhusband William Draper, whose marriage had been celebrated about a year\r\npreviously. In 1696 it was let for three years to Admiral Benbow, who\r\nsublet it in 1698 to Peter the Great, then visiting the Deptford\r\nDockyards for three months as his Majesty’s guest. So great was the\r\ndestruction done to the gardens, trees, and holly-hedges, that Wren was\r\nasked to report on the compensation suitable, and £162-7-0 were paid to\r\nEvelyn for damage to the house and garden.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1695 Evelyn accepted the offer of the Treasurership of\r\nGreenwich Hospital, then about to be rebuilt and endowed for the\r\nmaintainence of decayed seamen, which was made to him by Lord Godolphin,\r\nwho had been the husband of his former friend Miss Blagg. During the\r\ndays of Charles II. some such transformation of the Palace had been\r\nunder consideration, but it was the 30th June 1696 before Evelyn and Sir\r\nChristopher Wren ‘laid the first stone of the intended foundation,\r\nprecisely at 5 o’clock in the evening, after we had din’d together.’\r\nThis appointment carried with it ‘the salary of £200 per ann. of which I\r\nhave never yet receiv’d one penny of the tallies assign’d for it, now\r\ntwo years at Lady-day; my son-in-law Draper is my substitute.’ When the\r\nnew Commission for Greenwich Hospital was sealed in August 1703 Evelyn\r\nresigned his office of Treasurer in favour of Draper.\r\n\r\nHis brother George dying in October 1699, Evelyn then became the owner\r\nof Wotton, and looked to his grandson, the Oxford Student, to ‘be the\r\nsupport of the Wotton family.’ The lad had a bad attack of small-pox in\r\nthe autumn of 1700, a malady that had caused many gaps in the family\r\ncircle; but, coming safely through this illness, he was in July 1701, by\r\nthe patronage of Lord Godolphin, made one of the Commissioners of the\r\nPrizes, with a salary of £500 a year, while he was still an\r\nundergraduate at Oxford. And in January 1704 the same noble patron\r\nappointed him Treasurer of the Stamp Duties, with a salary of £300 a\r\nyear. He afterwards married Ann, daughter of Hugh Boscawen (afterwards\r\nLord Falmouth), Lord Godolphin’s niece, and was created a baronet in\r\n1713. It was through him that the present family of Evelyn of Wotton\r\ndirectly descend, though the baronetcy lapsed on the death of his\r\ngrandson Frederick in 1812.\r\n\r\nAs he had done twenty years before, so also on now attaining his 80th\r\nbirthday on 31st. October 1700 Evelyn rendered thanks for mercies with\r\nhis characteristic religious feeling. ‘I with my soul render thanks to\r\nGod, who of his infinite mercy, not only brought me out of many\r\ntroubles, but this yeare restor’d me to health, after an ague and other\r\ninfirmities of so greate an age, my sight, hearing and other senses and\r\nfaculties tolerable, which I implore him to continue, with the pardon of\r\nmy sins past, and grace to acknowledge by my improvement of his\r\ngoodnesse the ensuing yeare, if it be his pleasure to protract my life,\r\nthat I may be the better prepar’d for my last day, through the infinite\r\nmerits of my blessed Saviour, the Lord Jesus, Amen.’\r\n\r\nFive times more was he to be privileged to record his thanks and prayers\r\non successive returns of this anniversary. One of the very last entries\r\nin his memoirs is that on 31st. October 1705 ‘I am this day arriv’d to\r\nthe 85th year of my age. Lord teach me so to number my days to come that\r\nI may apply them to wisdom’. And numbered, indeed, they then were; for\r\non the 27th of February 1706 he passed quietly and peacefully away,\r\nretaining his faculties to the last. And he was laid at rest in the\r\nChancel of Wotton Church.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of his long and distinguished life he had seen many\r\nstirring events, had taken part in many important affairs, had achieved\r\nmuch, and had suffered much. He had outlived four reigns, two of which\r\nwere terminated by a natural death, one by public execution, and one by\r\nabdication. He had served many public and other distinguished offices\r\nwith zeal, ability, integrity, and success. He had given to English\r\nliterature some of the classic works that are among the treasures of our\r\nliterature of the Restoration period. He had outlived all of his six\r\nsons, most of whom had died in childhood, as well as his eldest and\r\nfavourite daughter. Of all his nine children, the sole survivors were\r\nhis daughter Elizabeth, who was soon afterwards married to a son of Sir\r\nJohn Tippet, and Susanna, wife of William Draper, afterwards of Adscomb\r\nnear Croydon. After nearly 60 years of pure domestic wedded life, in\r\nmarked contrast to the prevailing dissoluteness of the time, Evelyn was\r\nsurvived for nearly three years by his widow, who died in 1709, aged 74\r\nyears, cherishing to the last her love and affection for him to whom her\r\ndestiny had been committed whilst she was still a mere child. ‘His care\r\nof my education’, she wrote in her last Will and Testament, ‘was such as\r\nmight become a father, a lover, a friend, and a husband; for\r\ninstruction, tenderness, affection and fidelity to the last moment of\r\nhis life; which obligation I mention with a gratitude to his memory ever\r\ndear to me; and I must not omit to own the sense I have of my parents’\r\ncare and goodness in placing me in such worthy hands.’ Surely no husband\r\never had a nobler epitaph.\r\n\r\nIn an age of fierce political and ecclesiastical conflict, Evelyn,\r\noften, no doubt, strongly tempted to partisanship, managed to steer his\r\ncourse with prudence and great worldly judgment. But for that, his\r\nindustry and business talent would probably have brought him more\r\nprominently into office under Charles II. In a corrupt and profligate\r\nage, however, his character stands out as that of one unsullied by\r\nexcesses, impurities, or vices. And it is not the least of his merits\r\nthat, in an age of bigotry and narrow-mindedness, he was not intolerant\r\ntowards those whose religious views happened to differ from his own.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n_Evelyn’s Literary Works._\r\n\r\nEvelyn’s earliest publications, some of which have already been referred\r\nto, consisted mostly in translations from the French, Latin, and Greek,\r\nthat of the first book of Lucretius’ _De Rerum Natura_ being in verse.\r\nTheir authorship was usually veiled either under Greek pseudonyms or\r\nelse more thinly under the initials ‘J.E.’ That on _A Character of\r\nEngland_ (1659), a tract purporting to have been written by a foreigner,\r\nappeared anonymously.\r\n\r\nOf all these seven publications appearing before the Restoration, the\r\nonly one of any importance was _The French Gardener_, the translation of\r\na work by N. de Bonnefons, which appeared at the end of 1658 and was\r\nthus referred to in the diary,--‘Dec. 6th. Now was publish’d my “French\r\nGardener,” the first and best of the kind that introduc’d ye use of the\r\nOlitorie garden to any purpose.’ Subsequent editions of it appeared in\r\n1669, 1672, 1691, bearing Evelyn’s name on the titlepage in place of the\r\n_Philocepos_ on its first publication.\r\n\r\nWith the Restoration, bringing to him greater personal freedom of\r\nthought and speech, came the most active period of Evelyn’s literary\r\nproduction. His loyalty at once found opportunity to answer a libel on\r\nKing Charles (entitled _News from Brussels_) in _The late News from\r\nBrussels unmasked_, a long vindication of his Majesty from the calumnies\r\nand scandal therein fixed on him. From a literary and antiquarian point\r\nof view, however, far greater interest attaches to a much shorter\r\ntreatise entitled _Fumifugium: or the Inconvenience of the Aer and Smoak\r\nof London Dissipated, together with some Remedies humbly proposed_. As\r\nthis is the earliest reference to the great London Smoke Nuisance,\r\nwhich, like the poor, we have always with us, it is of more than passing\r\ninterest to know how large this difficult problem of curing it loomed\r\nabout two and a half centuries ago. Moreover, this short work affords a\r\nvery typical example of Evelyn’s literary style, while at the same time\r\nwell exemplyfying his profusely enthusiastic outbursts of devoted and\r\nloyal attachment to the King’s person and interests.\r\n\r\nIn the dull days of autumn and winter, when the heavy, damp air wafted\r\ninwards from the sea shrouds London with a dirty pall of fog thickened\r\nand discoloured with the smoke belched forth skywards from the long\r\nthroats of thousands of tall factory chimneys and emitted from hundreds\r\nof thousands of household and workshop fires, the dweller in this vast\r\novergrown city is tempted to range himself for the moment among the\r\nbelauders of better times in the past. Almost groping his way along the\r\nstreets in semi-darkness, and half choked with the sulphurous surcharge\r\nin the atmosphere, this latter-day growler may perhaps be astonished to\r\nlearn that his complaint is of very old standing, and that long before\r\nthe days of his great-great-grandfather, in fact more than seven\r\ngenerations ago, this poisoning of the atmosphere with the impurities\r\ngiven off from ‘sea-coal’ and other combustibles had already come to be\r\nlooked on by some as a public nuisance. It will, therefore, interest\r\nLondoners in general, and will delight the hearts of Sir William\r\nRichmond R.A. and the County Council in particular, to know that their\r\ngreat precursor in this matter of reform nearly 250 years ago considered\r\nthe question even then one of urgency, admitting of no delay. How\r\ngraphic, and how refreshing, is the pithy point thus neatly scored--\r\n\r\n     ‘I propose therefore, that by an _Act_ of this present\r\n     _Parliament_, this infernal _Nuisance_ be removed.’\r\n\r\nThere is no beating about the bush here, and no mincing of phrases. The\r\nmatter is at once probed with the needle.\r\n\r\nEvelyn was not merely a rather notable person in the London society of\r\nthat period. As a man of science he was one of the most prominent\r\npillars of the then recently founded Royal Society. As an official he\r\nwas His Majesty’s Commissioner for improving the streets and buildings\r\nof London, in addition to various other particular duties. But\r\nfinally,--and, at the same time, first of all, if it be permissible to\r\nemphasise the fact in so paradoxical a manner--he was a courtier; and\r\nthat at a time when expressions of loyalty to His Gracious Majesty,\r\nKing Charles II., were somewhat too highly coloured, too servile and\r\nsycophantic, to suit our modern taste.\r\n\r\nThis short work _Fumifugium_, really only a pamphlet, was therefore\r\ndedicated to the King in language of the period extravagant in the\r\nhighest degree, though eminently typical of the Royalists during the\r\nearly days of the Restoration. The treatise was thus occasioned:-- ‘It\r\nwas one day, as I was Walking in Your Majesty’s Palace at White-Hall\r\n(where I have sometimes the honour to refresh myself with the Sight of\r\nYour Illustrious Presence, which is the Joy of Your Peoples hearts) that\r\na presumptuous Smoak issuing from one or two tunnels near\r\n_Northumberland House_, and not far from _Scotland-yard_ did so invade\r\nthe Court; that all the Rooms, Galleries, and Places about it were\r\nfill’d and infested with it; and that to such a degree, as Men could\r\nhardly discern one another from the Clowd, and none could support,\r\nwithout manifest Inconveniency. It was not this which did first suggest\r\nto me what I had long since conceived against this pernicious Accident,\r\nupon frequent observation; But it was this alone, and the trouble that\r\nit must needs procure to Your Sacred Majesty, as well as hazzard to Your\r\nHealth, which kindled this Indignation of mine against it, and was the\r\noccasion of what it has produc’d in these Papers.\r\n\r\nSir, I prepare in this short Discourse an expedient how this pernicious\r\n_Nuisance_ may be reformed; and offer at another also, by which the\r\n_Aer_ may not only be freed from the present Inconveniency; but (that\r\nremov’d) to render not only Your Majesties Palace, but the whole City\r\nlikewise, one of the sweetest, and most delicious Habitations in the\r\nWorld; and this, with little or no expence; but by improving those\r\nPlantations which Your Majesty so laudably affects, in the moyst,\r\ndepressed and marshy grounds about the Town, to the Culture and\r\nproduction of such things, as upon every gentle emission through the\r\n_Aer_, should so perfume the adjacent places with their breath; as if,\r\nby a certain charm, or innocent _Magick_, they were transferred to that\r\npart of _Arabia_, which is therefore styled the _Happy_, because it is\r\namongst the Gums and precious spices.’\r\n\r\nObjectionable cottages had thus apparently only recently, probably\r\nduring the democratic Commonwealth, been erected to the east of\r\nWhitehall, and were surrounded by fields. These fields were to be\r\ndivided into blocks of about 20 to 40 acres, and palisades or fences of\r\nshrubs were to enclose belts of 150 feet or more between the various\r\nfields. The fences were to be formed or filled with sweetbriar,\r\npericlymena, woodbine, jessamine, syringa, guelder-rose, musk and other\r\nroses, broom, juniper, lavender, and so on,--‘but above all _Rosemary_,\r\nthe _Flowers_ whereof are credibly reported to give their sent above\r\nthirty Leagues off at Sea, upon the coasts of Spain. Those who take\r\nnotice of the Sent of the _Orange_-flowers from the Rivage of Genöa, and\r\n_St. Pietro dell’ Arena_; the Blosomes of _Rosemary_ from the Coasts of\r\n_Spain_ many leagues off at Sea; or the manifest and odoriferous wafts\r\nwhich flow from _Fontenoy_ and _Vaugirard_, even to _Paris_ in the\r\nseason of _Roses_, with the contrary Effects of those less pleasing\r\nsmells from other accidents, will easily consent to what I suggest: And,\r\nI am able to enumerate a Catalogue of native _Plants_, and such as are\r\nfamiliar to our Country and Clime, whose redolent and agreeable\r\nEmissions would even ravish our senses, as well as perfectly improve the\r\n_Aer_ about _London_; and that, without the least prejudice to the\r\nOwners and Proprietors of the Land to be employ’d about it.’ Evelyn\r\nfurther recommended ‘That the _Spaces_, or _Area_ between these\r\n_Pallisads_, and _Fences_, be employ’d in Beds and Bordures of _Pinks_,\r\n_Carnations_, _Clove_, _Stock-gilly-flower_, _Primroses_, _Auriculas_,\r\n_Violets_, not forgetting the _White_, which are in flower twice a year,\r\n_April_ and _August_; _Cowslips_, _Lillies_, _Narcissus_,\r\n_Strawberries_, whose very leaves as well as fruit, emit a _Cardiague_,\r\nand most refreshing _Halitus_: also _Parietria Lutea_, _Musk_, _Lemmon_,\r\nand _Mastick_: _Thyme_, _Spike_, _Cammomile_, _Balm_, _Mint_,\r\n_Marjoram_, _Pimpernel_, _Serpillum_, etc., which upon the least\r\npressure and cutting, breathe out and betray their ravishing Odors.’\r\nPlantations of trees were also to be made and nurseries formed, which\r\nwould have the additional advantage, besides mere beauty and ornament,\r\nof providing for the fields--‘better Shelter, and Pasture for Sheep and\r\nCattel then now; that they lie bleak, expos’d and abandon’d to the\r\nwinds, which perpetually invade them.’ It is said that the planting of\r\nLime trees in St. James’ Park was due to these suggestions. Evelyn’s\r\nrecommendations concluded with the exhorting that ‘the further\r\nexhorbitant encrease of _Tenements_, poor and nasty _Cottages_ near the\r\nCity, be prohibited, which disgrace and take off from the sweetness and\r\namoenity of the Environs of _London_, and are already become a great\r\n_Eye-sore_ in the grounds opposite to _His Majesty’s Palace_ of\r\n_White-hall_; which being converted to this use, might yield a diversion\r\ninferior to none that could be imagin’d for _Health_, _Profit_, and\r\n_Beauty_, which are the three _Transcendencies_ that render a place\r\nwithout all exception. And _this_ is what (in short) I had to offer, for\r\nthe _Improvement_ and _Melioration_ of the _Aer_ about _London_, and\r\nwith which I shall conclude this discourse.’\r\n\r\nBesides dedicating his pamphlet especially to the King, as well as\r\nproposing, on the title-page, the remedy “To His Sacred Majestie, and To\r\nthe Parliament now Assembled”, Evelyn likewise adresses himself “To the\r\nReader” by way of a second introduction; and he does so in these plainer\r\nand rather contemptuous terms:-- ‘I have little here to add to implore\r\nthy good opinion and approbation, after I have submitted this Essay to\r\nhis Sacred Majesty: But as it is of universal benefit that I propound\r\nit; so I expect a civil entertainment and reception....’ Confessing\r\nhimself ‘frequently displeased at the small advance and improvement of\r\nPublick Works in this nation,’ he further expresses himself as\r\n‘extremely amazed, that where there is so great affluence of all things\r\nwhich may render the People of this vast City the most happy upon Earth;\r\nthe sordid and accursed Avarice of some few Particular Persons should be\r\nsuffered to prejudice the health and felicity of so many: That any\r\nProfit (besides what is absolute necessity) should render men\r\nregardlesse of what chiefly imports them, when it may be purchased upon\r\nso easie conditions, and with so great advantages: For it is not\r\nhappiness to possesse Gold, but to enjoy the Effects of it and to know\r\nhow to live cheerfully and in health, _Non est vivere, sed valere vita_.\r\nThat men whose very Being is _Aer_, should not breath it freely when\r\nthey may; but (as that _Tyrant_ us’d his Vassals) condemn themselves to\r\nthis misery and _Fumo præfocari_, is strange stupidity: yet thus we see\r\nthem walk and converse in _London_, pursu’d and haunted by that\r\ninfernal Smoake, and the funest accidents which accompany it wheresoever\r\nthey retire.’\r\n\r\nSurely, if John Evelyn could in spirit revisit the metropolis he loved\r\nso well and was so much at home in, he would, while lamenting the\r\ncontinuation and the now much more acute form of the “infernal\r\n_Nuisance_”, to a certainty find ample cause for rejoicing at the\r\nadmirable work of late years carried out in the London Royal Parks and\r\nPleasure Grounds, and in the Parks and Open Spaces under the\r\nadministration of the County Council.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1664, however, that Evelyn achieved his greatest literary\r\ntriumph by the publication of his three masterpieces, _Sylva: or a\r\nDiscourse of Forest Trees, and the Propagation of Timber in His\r\nMajestie’s Dominions_; _Pomona: or an Appendix concerning Fruit Trees in\r\nrelation to Cider, the Making and several ways of Ordering it_; and\r\n_Kalendarium Hortense: or the Gard’ners Almanack, directing what he is\r\nto do Monthly throughout the Year_.’\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the idea of the _Sylva_ originated is clearly shewn\r\nby what is noted in his Diary on 15th October, 1662.--‘I this day\r\ndeliver’d my “Discourse concerning Forest Trees” to the Society, upon\r\noccasion of certain queries sent to us by the Commissioners of his\r\nMajesties Navy, being the first booke that was printed by order of the\r\nSociety, and by their printer, since it was a Corporation.’ This latter\r\nreference evidently anticipates events, as one often had reason to note\r\nin this so-called diary, because Sylva was not actually published until\r\nthe beginning of 1664, when along with it were included _Pomona_, and\r\nthe _Kalendarium Hortense_. In February, 1664, ‘16th, I presented my\r\n“Sylva” to the Society; and next day to his Majestie, to whom it was\r\ndedicated; also to the Lord Treasurer and the Lord Chancellor.’\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that _Sylva_ was a work of national importance. Then,\r\nas now, England was dependent on her Navy. But the stock of Oak timber\r\nsuitable for the requirements of the naval dockyards had become almost\r\nexhausted. From a tonnage of 17,110 tons in 1603, our fleet had risen to\r\n57,463 tons in 1660, and during the 25 years of Charles II’s reign it\r\nincreased to 103,556 tons. To supply these rapidly expanding\r\nrequirements the stock of timber in the country was feared to be\r\ninadequate. From 197,405, loads of timber fit for the Navy in the New\r\nForest in 1608, the stock sank later to 19,873 in 1707; and in the royal\r\nforests in Gloucestershire a similar state of affairs obtained. At a\r\nmeeting of the Council of the Royal Society in November 1662, Evelyn\r\nfollowed up his recent _Sylva_ by suggesting a discourse ‘concerning\r\nplanting his Majesty’s Forest of Deane with oake, now so much exhausted,\r\nof ye choicest ship-timber in the world.’ This was before the days of\r\nsteam or even of macadamized roads, when we had to grow our own supplies\r\nof food and Navy timber. True, oak for wainscoting and the like had long\r\nbeen imported from the Continent; but if we had been anything like\r\ndependent on foreign oak, the Dutch War which shortly afterwards broke\r\nout would probably have cut off the same entirely from reaching our\r\nports.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to say much about this charming classic of Forestry,\r\nof whose various excellences the reader can herein judge for himself.\r\nGracefully written in nervous English and in a cultured style, ornately\r\nembellished according to the then prevailing custom by apt quotations\r\nfrom the Latin poets, it contains an enormous amount of information in\r\nthe shape of legends and of facts ascertained by travel, of observation,\r\nand of experience. No man of his time could possibly have been better\r\nqualified than Evelyn for undertaking the special duty laid upon him;\r\nand he carried out his task in a brilliant manner. _Sylva_ soon ran into\r\nseveral editions. The fourth edition appeared in the year of his death\r\n(1706) and a fifth in 1729. From 1776 to 1812 other four editions were\r\npublished, with notes by Dr. A. Hunter of York, the last of which served\r\nas the text for the celebrated forestry article in the _Quarterly\r\nReview_ for March, 1813. A later issue of Hunter’s editions appeared in\r\n1825; but in 1827 ignorant and wanton hands were with much bombastic\r\nlanguage and buffoonry laid on this great classic, when James Mitchell,\r\nan agriculturist, published _Dendrologia; or a Treatise of Forest Trees,\r\nwith Evelyn’s Silva, revised, corrected, and abridged by a Professional\r\nPlanter and Collector of practical Notes forty years_. Since then no\r\nother edition of _Sylva_ has appeared until the present reprint of the\r\n4th edition, making the 12th edition of this classic work.\r\n\r\nThe publication of _Sylva_ gave an enormous stimulus to planting in\r\nBritain, the benefits from which were subsequently reaped at the end of\r\nthe XVIII and the beginning of the XIX century, when during our war with\r\nFrance the supply of oak timber for shipbuilding almost entirely ran\r\nout. Dr. Hunter’s editions did much to revive the ardour for planting,\r\nwhich was further stimulated by the _Quarterly Review_ article and by\r\nthe advice which Sir Walter Scott put into the mouth of the Laird o’\r\nDumbiedykes to his son: ‘Jock, when ye hae naething else to do, ye may\r\nbe aye sticking in a tree; it will be growing, Jock, when ye’re\r\nsleeping.’ To the impetus then given to planting, many of the woods now\r\ngrowing in different parts of Britain, and especially in Scotland, owe\r\ntheir origin.\r\n\r\nAs Evelyn had given the copyright to Allestry, the Royal Society’s\r\nprinter, _Sylva_ brought no pecuniary profit to its author; and\r\nindirectly it was the cause of disappointment to him. How this came\r\nabout may be seen from the following extract from a letter, dated 4th\r\nAugust 1690, to his friend the Countess of Sunderland, which is further\r\nof interest as giving Evelyn’s own account of the origin of\r\n_Sylva_--‘when many yeares ago I came from rambling abroad, observ’d a\r\nlittle time there, and a greate deale more since I came home than gave\r\nme much satisfaction, and (as events have prov’d) scarce worth one’s\r\npursuite, I cast about how I should employ the time which hangs on most\r\nyoung men’s hands, to the best advantage; and when books and severer\r\nstudies grew tedious, and other impertinence would be pressing, by which\r\ninnocent diversions I might sometime relieve my selfe without complyance\r\nto recreations I took no felicity in, because they did not contribute to\r\nany improvement of the mind. This set me upon planting of trees, and\r\nbrought forth my “Sylva,” which booke, infinitely beyond my expectation,\r\nis now also calling for a fourth impression, and has been the occasion\r\nof propagating many millions of usefull timber trees thro’out this\r\nnation, as I may justifie (without im’odesty) from ye many letters of\r\nacknowledgement receiv’d from gentlemen of the first quality, and others\r\naltogether strangers to me. His late Majesty Charles the 2nd. was\r\nsometimes graciously pleas’d to take notice of it to me, and that I had\r\nby that booke alone incited a world of planters to repaire their broken\r\nestates and woodes, which the greedy rebells had wasted and made much\r\nhavock of. Upon this encouragement I was once speaking to a mighty man,\r\nthen in despotic power, to mention the greate inclination I had to serve\r\nhis Majesty in a little office then newly vacant (the salary I think\r\nhardly £300) whose province was to inspect the timber trees in his\r\nMajesties Forests, etc., and take care of their culture and improvement;\r\nbut this was conferr’d upon another who, I believe, had seldom been out\r\nof the smoake of London, where though there was a greate deale of\r\ntimber, there were not many trees. I confesse I had an inclination to\r\nthe imployment upon a publique account as well as its being suitable to\r\nmy rural genius, borne as I was at Wotton, among the woods.’\r\n\r\nA still greater success was achieved by the _Kalendarium Hortense_,\r\nwhich reached its tenth edition (1706) during Evelyn’s lifetime, and of\r\nwhich two reprints have subsequently been made. This small work was the\r\nforerunner of the more modern books on English gardening, the names of\r\nwhich are now almost legion.\r\n\r\nPrevious to this, _Sculptura: or the History and Art of Chalcography and\r\nEngraving in Copper and Mezzo-tinto_, had been published in 1662, being\r\nthe first work on this subject that had appeared in England. But it was\r\na poor production, and ran into no second edition while the author\r\nlived. His chief subsequent literary successes were _Terra: a\r\nPhilosophical Discourse of Earth relating to the Culture and Improvement\r\nof it for Vegetation, and for the Propagation of Plants_, (1676), which\r\nwas first read before the Royal Society on 29th April 1675, and of which\r\nthe third edition was printed in 1706, and _The Compleat Gardiner, or\r\nDirections for cultivating and right ordering of Fruit Gardens and\r\nKitchen Gardens; with divers Reflections on several parts of Husbandry_,\r\n(1693), which went into five editions by 1710. His History of the Dutch\r\nWar, already referred to (page xliii) would have been by far his most\r\nimportant work in point of length had its completion been allowed, but\r\nonly the introductory portion saw the light as _Navigation and Commerce;\r\ntheir Original and Progress, Containing a succint account of Traffick\r\nin general; etc. etc...... to the beginning of our late differences with\r\nHolland; in which his Majesties title to the Dominion of the Sea is\r\nasserted against the Novel and later Pretenders_. (1674). His own\r\naccount of the stoppage of the work is given in the diary for 19th\r\nAugust 1674,--‘His Majesty told me how exceedingly the Dutch were\r\ndispleas’d at my treatise of the “Historie of Commerce;” that the\r\nHolland Ambassador had complain’d to him of what I had touch’d of the\r\nFlags and Fishery, etc., and desired the booke might be call’d in;\r\nwhilst on the other side he assur’d me he was exceedingly pleas’d with\r\nwhat I had done, and gave me many thanks. However, it being just upon\r\nconclusion of the treaty of Breda (indeed it was design’d to have been\r\npublish’d some moneths before and when we were at defiance), his Majesty\r\ntold me he must recall it formally, but gave order that what copies\r\nshould be publiqly seiz’d to pacifie the Ambassador, should immediately\r\nbe restor’d to the printer, and that neither he nor the vendor should be\r\nmolested. The truth is, that which touch’d the Hollander was much lesse\r\nthan what the King himself furnish’d me with, and oblig’d me to publish,\r\nhaving caus’d it to be read to him before it went to the presse; but the\r\nerror was, it should have been publish’d before the peace was\r\nproclaim’d. The noise of this book’s suppression made it presently be\r\nbought up, and turn’d much to the stationer’s advantage. It was no other\r\nthan the Preface prepar’d to be prefix’d to my History of the whole\r\nWarr; which I now pursued no further.’ Years afterwards, however, he\r\nwrote somewhat bitterly on this subject to his intimate friend Pepys, in\r\na letter dated 28th April 1682, in which he says, ‘In sum, I had no\r\nthanks for what I had done, and have been accounted since, I suppose, an\r\nuseless fop, and fit only to plant coleworts, and I cannot bend to mean\r\nsubmissions; and this, Sir, is the history of the Historian. I confess\r\nto you, I had once the vanity to hope, had my patron continued in his\r\nstation, for some, at least, honorary title that might have animated my\r\nprogress, as seeing then some amongst them whose talents I did not envy:\r\nbut it was not my fortune to succeed.’ This certainly seems as if Evelyn\r\nhad been hoping for knighthood from King Charles. If his desire lay this\r\nway, it is difficult to reconcile such private admission with the\r\ndefinite statement made in the diary of 19th April, 1661, that ‘he might\r\nhave receiv’d this honour,’ of Knighthood of the Bath ‘but declined it.’\r\n\r\nEvelyn’s other publications, works of considerably less importance,\r\ninclude _Tyrannus or the Mode, in a Discourse of Sumptuary Laws_ (1661);\r\n_A Parallel of the Ancient Architecture with the Modern_ (1664), and _An\r\nIdea of the Perfection of Painting, Demonstrated from the Principles of\r\nArt_ (1668), both translated from the French of Roland Freart; _Another\r\nPart of the Mystery of Jesuitisim_, also from the French (1665);\r\n_Publick Employment, and an Active Life preferr’d to Solitude_ (1667: a\r\nreply to Sir George Mackenzie’s Work on Solitude); _The History of three\r\nlate famous Imposters_ (Padre Ottomano, Mahomed Bei, and Sabatei Sevi:\r\n1669); _Mundus Muliebris: or the Ladies Dressing-room Unlock’d and her\r\nToilette spread_ (1690: a burlesque poem, ‘A voyage to Marryland,’\r\ncataloguing female follies of the time, by his daughter Mary, who died\r\nin 1685); _Numismata: a Discourse of Medals, Antient and Modern: &c._\r\n(1697); and _Acetaria: a Discourse of Sallets_ (1699), which was merely\r\na chapter, written many years previously, of an extensive work he\r\nintended writing under the comprehensive title of _Elysium Britannicum_.\r\nThere is no doubt that, but for his immersion in public affairs in\r\nmiddle life, Evelyn would have been a much larger producer of literary\r\nwork than he actually was. But it seems very questionable if this would\r\nin any substantial way have added to the enduring reputation he won for\r\nhimself by _Sylva_.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his published works, however, he left numerous\r\nmanuscripts, which he had noted as ‘Things I would write out faire and\r\nreform if I had leisure,’ comprising poems, mathematical papers,\r\nreligious meditations, and biographies. The most ambitious of his poems\r\nis _Thyrsander, a Tragy-Comedy_, which is probably one of those referred\r\nto by Pepys in his Diary for 5th Novr. 1665, when, visiting Evelyn at\r\nSayes Court, he says that ‘He read me part of a play or two of his\r\nmaking, very good, but not as he conceits them, I think, to be.’ Some of\r\nthese, including _My own Ephemeris or Diarie_, an autobiographical\r\nmemoir based on the journal or common-place book kept by him ever since\r\nbeing eleven years of age, and his correspondence, were published\r\nposthumously as _Memoirs illustrative of the Life and Writings of John\r\nEvelyn Esqre. F.R.S._ in 1818. This has gone through nine editions and\r\nreprints; and it affords, along with Pepys’ diary, one of the best views\r\nof the life of those times. Each is the complement of the other, and the\r\nonly matter of regret is that the original manuscript of Evelyn’s actual\r\ndiary has not hitherto been forthcoming, as it would be infinitely\r\npreferable to the compilation he made therefrom, which often refers to\r\nfuture events. Other of his MSS. appeared as _Miscellaneous Writings of\r\nJohn Evelyn Esq. F.R.S._ in 1825, _The Life of Mrs. Godolphin_ (see page\r\nxlv) in 1847, and subsequently in five or six editions and reprints, and\r\n_The History of Religion: A Rational Account of the True Religion_ in\r\n1850. Of these the so-called _Diary_ is by far the most interesting and\r\nimportant, and it is on it and on the _Sylva_ that his literary\r\nreputation rests and has a sure and abiding foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n_Evelyn’s Influence on British Arboriculture._\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that John Evelyn, both during his own lifetime and\r\nthroughout the two centuries which have elapsed since his death in 1706,\r\nhas exerted more individual influence, through his charming _Sylva, or a\r\nDiscourse of Forest Trees and the Propagation of Timber in His Majesty’s\r\nDominion_ (first published in 1664) than can be ascribed to any other\r\nindividual. The attention drawn to the subject of Arboriculture by Dr.\r\nHunter towards the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth centuries was in connection with several new editions of that\r\nclassic work, while the impulse given to the formation of large\r\nplantations between 1800 and 1830 by Sir Walter Scott and the celebrated\r\n_Quarterly Review_ articles was connected very closely indeed with the\r\nappearance of fresh editions of _Sylva_.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand the success of Evelyn’s work and the influence\r\nhe exerted on British Arboriculture. First and foremost, he held the\r\nbrief in an excellent cause, because the maintenance of adequate\r\nsupplies of oak timber for shipbuilding ever remained a question of\r\nvery serious national importance right down to the time when this\r\npressure was removed by the introduction of steam communication and the\r\nuse of Indian Teak and subsequently of iron for purposes of\r\nconstruction. Then again, his position as a courtier and a country\r\ngentleman, and as one of the most prominent members of the recently\r\nestablished Royal Society, gave him a much higher degree of prominence\r\nthan such adventitious aids would ensure in our present far more\r\ndemocratic days. Finally, he had no small confidence in his own ability\r\n(‘conceit’ his friend Mr. Samuel Pepys calls it in his diary); and this\r\nhas been recognised in the numerous editions of _Sylva_ that have from\r\ntime to time been found worthy of publication.\r\n\r\nAlthough by far the most celebrated of English writers on Arboriculture,\r\nEvelyn was by no means the first who wrote on this subject. That honour\r\nbelongs to Master Fitzherbert, whose _Boke of Husbandrie_ was published\r\nin 1534. But it is a curious fact that the most important previous\r\ncontribution towards the propagation of timber--leaving Manwood’s\r\n_Treatise of the Forrest Lawes_ (1598) out of consideration--is\r\napparently never mentioned by Evelyn. This was a small booklet of 34\r\npages, a mere pamphlet in size, published in 1613 by Arthur Standish and\r\nentitled _New Directions of Experience ... for the Increasing of Timber\r\nand Firewood_. In this, Standish strongly urged sowing and planting on\r\nan extensive scale; and the pamphlet was so highly approved by King\r\nJames I., that in 1615 a second edition was issued. This included, among\r\nthe prefatory matters, a royal proclamation ‘By the King, To all\r\nNoblemen, Gentlemen, and other our loving Subjects, to whom it may\r\nappertaine,’ which set forth the ‘severall good projects for the\r\nincreasing of Woods’ and recommended them to ‘be willingly received and\r\nput in practise’ with a view to restore the decay of timber ‘universally\r\ncomplained of’ within the realm.\r\n\r\nAlthough exhortations and royal proclamations had previously been issued\r\nmore than once by James I. relative to the ‘storing’ of timber trees\r\nwhen falls were being made in copsewoods, and generally to ensure better\r\neffect being given to the intentions of Henry VIII’s _Statute of Woods_\r\nof 1543, as amended during Queen Elizabeth’s reign (in 1570), yet\r\nStandish’s treatise was the first occasion (so far as I have been able\r\nto discover) on which a private subject had endeavoured to stimulate the\r\nprogress of British Forestry by means of the publication of his views in\r\nthe form of a small book. His aims and objects are thus described on the\r\ntitle-page of the second or royal edition of 1615:--“NEW DIRECTIONS OF\r\nEXPERIENCE AUTHORIZED BY THE King’s most excellent Majesty, as may\r\nappeare, for the increasing of Timber and Fire-wood, with the least\r\nwaste and losse of ground. WITH A NEARE ESTIMATION, what millions of\r\nacres the Kingdome doth containe; what acres is waste ground, wherever\r\nlittle profit for this purpose will arise--which waste being deducted,\r\nthe remaine is twenty-five millions; forth of which millions, if two\r\nhundred and forty thousand Acres be planted and preserved according to\r\nthe directions following, which is but the hundred part of the\r\ntwenty-five millions, there may be as much timber raised, as will\r\nmaintaine the Kingdome for all uses for ever. And how as great store of\r\nFire-wood may be raised, forth of hedges, as may plentifully mainetaine\r\nthe Kingdome for all purposes, without losse of ground; so as within\r\nthirty years all Spring-woods{lxvii:1} may be converted to Tillage and\r\nPasture. By Arthur Standish. Anno Domini MDCXV.”\r\n\r\nThis was the only work of the sort which had been published up to the\r\ntime of Evelyn’s _Sylva_ appearing about fifty years later, in 1662. It\r\nis curious that he made no reference to this work written with similar\r\nobjects to those he himself had in view. Another work, however, he does\r\nmention, evidently that of a practical horticulturist and\r\narboriculturist, probably belonging to a lower status of society than\r\nhimself. Writing of the _New Orchard and Garden_ (1597, 2nd. edit.\r\n1623), he patronises the author by calling him ‘our countryman honest\r\nLawson’; and after giving a long quotation from it with regard to\r\npruning, he complacently concludes by adding ‘Thus far the good man out\r\nof his eight and forty years experience concerning timber-trees.’\r\n\r\nEvelyn had the satisfaction of seeing his work bear much fruit during\r\nhis own life-time, and this must have occasioned a quite exceptionally\r\nkeen pleasure to a man of his disposition. In his preface, dated 5\r\nDecember 1678, to the fourth edition of _Sylva_, he writes in ‘The\r\nEpistle Dedicatory’ to the King that ‘I need not acquaint your Majesty\r\nhow many millions of timber-trees, besides infinite others, have been\r\npropagated and planted throughout your vast dominions, at the\r\ninstigation, and by the sole directions of this work; because your\r\ngracious Majesty had been pleased to own it publickly for my\r\nencouragement, who in all that I here pretend to say, deliver only those\r\nprecepts which your Majesty has put in practise; as having, like another\r\nCyrus, by your own royal example, exceeded all your predecessors in the\r\nplantations you have made, beyond, I dare assert it, all the Monarchs of\r\nthis nation, since the conquest of it.’\r\n\r\nApart from the planting done in the royal woods and forests, details of\r\nEvelyn’s diary shew that he was frequently called upon to give advice\r\nwith regard to laying out private plantations,--as well as of ornamental\r\ngardens, on which subject he was also considered one of the leading\r\nauthorities of the time.\r\n\r\nMore than a century after Evelyn’s death, during the time of our wars\r\nwith France, the demand for timber and the serious outlook with regard\r\nto future supplies once more drew marked attention to the propagation of\r\ntimber throughout Britain, and many plantations of oak were then made\r\nwhich have not yet been entirely cleared to make way for other and now\r\nmore profitable crops of wood. A very decided impetus was given in this\r\ndirection by the re-publication of the text of the fourth edition of\r\n_Sylva_ (as finally revised by the author in 1678), with copious notes\r\nby Dr. A. Hunter F.R.S. in 1812. A most appreciative and favourable\r\nreview of this work is contained in the _Quarterly Review_ for March\r\n1813 (Vol. ix), which was of much assistance in drawing the attention of\r\nour great landowners to the advantages of growing timber. Plantations\r\ncould then be made at about one-fourth to one-third (and often less than\r\nthat) of what it now costs to make them, while the market for timber and\r\nwood of all sorts was then favourable, with a steady demand likely to\r\nincrease as time rolled on and the national commerce and industries\r\nexpanded,--because in those days the economic revolution, accomplished\r\nthrough the subsequent discoveries of the great uses to which steam and\r\niron are now put, were not then dreamed of.\r\n\r\nThis _Quarterly Review_ article was an appreciation of Evelyn,--and not\r\nthe only one made by that celebrated periodical, as we shall see\r\npresently. It traced the history of the work, showing how Charles II.\r\n‘was too sensible a man to think of compelling his subjects to plant, by\r\nfines and forfeitures for the omission. Example he knew would do\r\nsomething, and he had scope enough for the purpose in his own wasted\r\nforests; but an animated exhortation from the press, in an age when the\r\nnobility and gentry began to read and to reflect, he knew would do more.\r\nA proper person for the purpose therefore was sought and found; a man of\r\nfamily, fortune, and learning; an experienced planter; a virtuoso, and\r\nnot a little of an enthusiast in his own walk. Such was Mr. Evelyn: and\r\nto this occasion we are indebted for the _Sylva_, which has therefore a\r\ntitle to be regarded as a national work... It sounded the trumpet of\r\nalarm to the nation on the condition of their woods and forests.’\r\n\r\nThe re-publication of the _Sylva_ by Dr. Hunter, coming at an\r\nappropriate moment, revived the ardour which the work had excited about\r\n60 years previously, and ‘while forests were laid prostrate to protect\r\nour shores from the insults of the enemy, the nobility and gentry began\r\nonce more to sow the seeds of future navies.’\r\n\r\nPrevious to 1812, planting on any large scale whether for profit or\r\nornament seems to have been confined chiefly to great estates, and ‘if a\r\nprivate gentleman, in the century preceding, planted an hedgrow of an\r\nhundred oaks, it was recorded, for the benefit of posterity, in his\r\ndiary.’ The trade in the supply of plants had previously been in the\r\nhands of a few nurserymen, but on the appearance of Dr. Hunter’s new\r\nedition many private nurseries were established. This was more\r\nespecially the case in Scotland, where the Scottish nobility took the\r\nlead ‘in this national and patriotic work,’--which promised to be very\r\nprofitable, owing to the recent introduction of the larch. The\r\nwell-deserved eulogy given in the _Quarterly Review_ article to the\r\nrapid growth of fine timber of this valuable forest tree was the direct\r\ncause of larch plantations being largely extended, because it was said\r\nthat ‘a tree which, if the oak should fail, would build navies, and if\r\nthe forests of Livonia or Norway or Canada were exhausted, would build\r\ncities, is an acquisition to this island almost without a parallel.’ And\r\nit still is one of the most valuable of our woodland trees, despite the\r\ncankerous fungus-disease which has certainly been (indirectly) due in no\r\nsmall degree to injudicious planting in pure woods on unsuitable soils\r\nand situations.\r\n\r\nThis _Quarterly Review_ article of 1813 probably did quite as much to\r\nstimulate planting throughout Great Britain as the _Sylva_ itself had\r\npreviously done; but as Evelyn’s classic formed the text for the\r\nexhortation, the beneficial effects must of course in great part be\r\nascribed to his influence.\r\n\r\nA few years later, the _Quarterly Review_ in an article on Evelyn’s\r\n_Memoirs_ (April, 1818), again sings the well-deserved praise of his\r\ninfluence on British Arboriculture. ‘The greater part of the woods,\r\nwhich were raised in consequence of Evelyn’s writings, have been cut\r\ndown: the oaks have borne the British flag to seas and countries which\r\nwere undiscovered when they were planted, and generation after\r\ngeneration has been coffined in the elms. The trees of his age, which\r\nmay yet be standing, are verging fast toward their decay and\r\ndissolution: but his name is fresh in the land, and his reputation, like\r\nthe trees of an Indian Paradise, exists and will continue to exist in\r\nfull strength and beauty, uninjured by the course of time.\r\n\r\n    Thrones fall and Dynasties are changed:\r\n    Empires decay and sink\r\n    Beneath their own unwieldy weight;\r\n    Dominion passeth like a cloud away.\r\n    The imperishable mind\r\n    Survives all meaner things.\r\n\r\nNo change of fashion, no alteration of taste, no revolutions of science\r\nhave impaired or can impair his celebrity.’\r\n\r\nAnother of the celebrated _Quarterly Review_ articles on Forestry is that\r\n_On Planting Waste Lands_ (October, 1827); and even though it was Robert\r\nMonteath’s _Foresters Guide and Profitable Planter_ which furnished the\r\npeg for a discourse on this occasion, still the spirit breathing\r\nthroughout the exhortion was the revivification of Evelyn’s influence. And\r\nthe same must also be said about the article on _Loudon’s ‘Trees and\r\nShrubs’_ (_Quarterly Review_; October, 1838), which opens with a eulogy of\r\nour great English enthusiast of Arboriculture. ‘The good and peaceful John\r\nEvelyn was a great benefactor to England. He was a country gentleman of\r\nindependent fortune; he held an office under Government; and was\r\npersonally familiar with Charles II. and James II; yet, in spite of the\r\ninfluence which he then possessed, his example effected little for his\r\nfavourite object till the publication of the _Sylva_. Half the charm of\r\nthis work lies in his contriving to make us feel interested about his\r\ntrees; he gossips about them, he tells us where they came from and what\r\nthey are used for, and has a few marvels--not of his own--but told with\r\nsuch perfect good faith that we can hardly help believing them with him.\r\nThis was the secret by which he managed to attract the attention of even\r\nthe wits and gallants of ‘the gay court;’ and thus it was that he gave an\r\nimpulse to planting those ‘goodly woods and forests,’ the absence of\r\nwhich, in his own time, he so feelingly laments, and which now crown our\r\nhills and enrich our valleys. Mr. Loudon has followed Evelyn’s track.\r\nTradition--history--poetry--anecdote enliven his pages; the reader soon\r\nfeels as if his instructor were a good natured and entertaining friend. He\r\nhas also not contented himself with merely recalling old favourites to our\r\nmemory, but has introduced to us numerous agreeable foreigners whose\r\nacquaintance we ought to rejoice to make, since by their aid we may hope,\r\nin the course of another half century, to see our woods and plantations\r\npresenting the richness and variety of the American autumns, the trees\r\nwhich produce those ‘lovely tints of scarlet and of gold,’ of which\r\ntravellers tell us, are all to be obtained at moderate cost in every\r\nnursery; and that they will thrive perfectly in this country Fonthill and\r\nWhite Knights bear ample testimony.’\r\n\r\nHardly anything can well be added to the above testimony regarding\r\nEvelyn’s influence on Arboriculture throughout the British Isles.\r\nEconomic conditions have changed entirely since his time, but the spirit\r\nliving and breathing in _Sylva_ is still that which is found\r\ninfluencing many of our great landowners. And it is an influence which\r\ncannot be indicated in any mere enumeration of the number of trees\r\nplanted or of acres enclosed as woodlands either for purposes of profit\r\nor of ornament.\r\n\r\nFar more is, of course, now known with regard to the physiology and the\r\nnatural requirements of our forest trees--e.g. with reference to soil\r\nand situation, demand for light and capacity of enduring shade,\r\netc.,--than was known in Evelyn’s time. Many of his arguments could\r\neasily be shown to be wrong, and many of his recommendations could\r\nequally easily be proved to be inefficacious and inexpedient, just as\r\nold works on Agriculture can no longer be accepted as trustworthy\r\ntext-books for the teaching of modern farming; because Vegetable\r\nPhysiology forms the true and scientific basis of both the arts relating\r\nto the cultivation of the soil, Agriculture and Forestry; and Vegetable\r\nPhysiology is a branch of botanical science which is only of\r\ncomparatively recent growth.\r\n\r\nMany works on Sylviculture or Forestry, on business principles, have\r\nappeared in England and Scotland within the last fifteen years, but this\r\nnew edition of _Sylva_ makes no pretence to belong to such an up-to-date\r\nclass of works. It is merely a reprint of the last edition that was\r\nrevised by Evelyn himself; and no notes of any description have been\r\nadded, such as those to be found in the several editions published by\r\nDr. Hunter. The present reprint is intended for those who love our\r\nforests and woodlands and the old trees surviving in parks and chases as\r\nlinks with the distant past; and it will also, for its own sake, appeal\r\nno less strongly to those who love to peruse a classic work, written in\r\nthe very highly polished and ornate style affected by writers of\r\ndistinction in the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n                                                      JOHN NISBET.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n{xxxi:1} This promise Charles afterwards failed to keep as, in 1672, he\r\nmerely renewed the lease of the pastures for 99 years.\r\n\r\n{lxvii:1} Coppices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 S I L V A,\r\n              Or a DISCOURSE of\r\n                FOREST-TREES,\r\n                   AND THE\r\n            PROPAGATION of TIMBER\r\n         In His MAJESTY’s DOMINIONS.\r\n\r\n     As it was Deliver’d in the _ROYAL SOCIETY_ the xv^th of _October_,\r\n     MDCLXII upon occasion of certain _Quæries_ propounded to that\r\n     _Illustrious Assembly_, by the _Honourable_ the Principal\r\n     _Officers_ and _Commissioners_ of the _Navy_.\r\n\r\n                In TWO BOOKS.\r\n\r\n     Together with an Historical Account of the _Sacredness_ and _Use_\r\n     of Standing _Groves_.\r\n\r\n                   TERRA,\r\n     A _Philosophical ESSAY of EARTH_, being a _Lecture_ in Course.\r\n\r\n             To which is annexed\r\n\r\n                   POMONA:\r\n                   OR, AN\r\n    _Appendix_ concerning _Fruit-Trees_, in relation to _CYDER_;\r\n    The _Making_, and several Ways of _Ordering_ it.\r\n\r\n    Published by Express _Order_ of the ROYAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n                    ALSO\r\n\r\n                  ACETARIA:\r\n        Or, a DISCOURSE of _SALLETS_.\r\n\r\n                    WITH\r\n           _KALENDARIVM HORTENSE_;\r\n                   OR THE\r\n             GARD’NERS ALMANACK;\r\n    Directing what he is to do _Monthly_ throughout the _Year_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    All which several _Treatises_ are in this _FOURTH EDITION_ much\r\n    _Inlarg’d_ and _Improv’d_,\r\n\r\n                 By the AUTHOR\r\n\r\n    _JOHN EVELYN_, Esq; Fellow of the _ROYAL SOCIETY_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    ........_Tibi res antiquae laudis & artis\r\n    Ingredior, tantos ausus recludere fontes._ Virg.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_LONDON_:\r\n\r\nPrinted for _Robert Scott_ in _Little-Britain_; _Richard Chiswell_ in\r\nSt. _Paul’s_ Churchyard; _George Sawbridge_ in _Little-Britain_; and\r\n_Benj.

And, indeed\r\nwhat more _August_, what more _Worthy_ Your _Majesty_, or more becoming\r\nour _Imitation?_ than whilst You are thus solicitous for the _Publick\r\nGood_, we pursue Your _Majesty’s_ Great _Example_; and by cultivating\r\nour decaying _Woods_, contribute to Your _Power_, as to Your greatest\r\n_Wealth_ and _Safety_; since whilst Your _Majesty_ is furnish’d to send\r\nforth those _Argo’s_ and _Trojan Horses_,{lxxvi:1} about this Happy\r\n_Island_, we are to fear nothing from _without it_; and whilst we remain\r\n_Obedient_ to Your just _Commands_, nothing from _within_ it.\r\n\r\n’Tis now some _Years_ past that Your _Majesty_ was pleas’d to declare\r\nYour Favourable Acceptance of a _Treatise_ of _Architecture_ which I\r\nthen presented to _You_, with many _Gracious Expressions_, and that it\r\nwas a most _useful_ Piece. _Sir_, that _Encouragement_ (together with\r\nthe _Success_ of the _Book_ it self, and of the former _Editions_ of\r\n_this_) has animated me still to continue my _Oblation_ to Your\r\n_Majesty_ of these _Improvements_: Nor was it certainly without some\r\n_Provident_ Conduct, that we have been thus solicitous to begin, as it\r\nwere, with _Materials_ for Building, and _Directions_ to _Builders_; if\r\ndue Reflection be made on that Deplorable _Calamity_, the\r\n_Conflagration_ of Your _Imperial City_; which nevertheless, by the\r\nBlessing of _God_, and Your _Majesty’s_ Gracious _Influence_, we have\r\nseen _Rise_ again, a _New_, and much more _Glorious_ PHOENIX.\r\n\r\nThis TRIBUTE I now once more lay at the _Feet_ of our ROYAL FOUNDER.\r\n\r\nMay Your _Majesty_ be pleas’d to be Invok’d by that no _Inglorious_\r\nTITLE, in the profoundest _Submission_ of\r\n\r\n            Gracious Sir,\r\n                Your _Majesty’s_\r\n                  Ever _Loyal_, most _Obedient_ and\r\n                       _Faithful Subject_ and _Servant_,\r\n                                  J.

If to _this_\r\nthere be any thing subjoyned _here_, which may a while bespeak the\r\nPatience of the _Reader_, it is only for the encouragement of an\r\n_Industry_, and worthy _Labour_, much in our days _neglected_, as haply\r\nreputed a _Consideration_ of too sordid and vulgar a nature for _Noble\r\nPersons_, and _Gentlemen_ to busie themselves withal, and who oftner\r\nfind out occasions to _Fell-down_, and Destroy their Woods and\r\n_Plantations_, than either to _repair_ or _improve_ them.\r\n\r\nBut we are not without hopes of taking off these _Prejudices_, and of\r\nreconciling them to a _Subject_ and an _Industry_ which has been\r\n_consecrated_ (as I may say) by as _good_, and as _great_ Persons, as\r\nany the World has produced; and whose Names we find mingl’d amongst\r\n_Kings_ and _Philosophers_, grave _Senators_, and _Patriots_ of their\r\nCountry: For such of old were _Solomon_, _Cyrus_, and _Numa_, _Licinius_\r\nsurnamed _Stolo_, _Cato_, and _Cincinnatus_; the _Piso’s_, _Fabii_,\r\n_Cicero_, the _Plinies_, and thousands more whom I might enumerate, that\r\ndisdained not to cultivate these _Rusticities_ even with their own\r\nhands, and to esteem it no small _Accession_, to dignifie their\r\n_Titles_, and adorn their _purple_ with these _Rural Characters_ of\r\ntheir affections to _Planting_, and love of this part of _Agriculture_,\r\nwhich has transmitted to us their venerable _Names_ through so many\r\n_Ages_ and _Vicissitudes_ of the World.\r\n\r\nThat famous _Answer_ alone which the _Persian Monarch_ gave to\r\n_Lysander_, will sufficiently justifie that which I have said; besides\r\nwhat we might add, out of the _Writings_ and _Examples_ of the rest: But\r\nsince _these_ may suffice after due reproofs of the late impolitique\r\n_Wast_, and universal _sloth_ amongst us; we should now turn our\r\n_Indignation_ into _Prayers_, and address our selves to our\r\nbetter-natur’d _Countrymen_;{lxxviii:1} that such _Woods_ as do yet\r\nremain intire, might be carefully _preserved_, and such as are\r\n_destroy’d_, sedulously _repaired_: It is what all Persons who are\r\n_Owners_ of _Land_ may contribute to, and with infinite _delight_, as\r\nwell as _profit_, who are touch’d with that laudable _Ambition_ of\r\nimitating their Illustrious _Ancestors_, and of worthily serving their\r\n_Generation_. To these my earnest and humble _Advice_ should be, That at\r\ntheir very first coming to their _Estates_, and as soon as they get\r\n_Children_, they would seriously think of _this Work_ of _Propagation_\r\nalso: For I observe there is no part of _Husbandry_, which Men commonly\r\nmore _fail_ in, _neglect_, and have cause to _repent_ of, than that they\r\ndid not begin _Planting betimes_, without which, they can expect neither\r\n_Fruit_, _Ornament_, or _Delight_ from their _Labours_: Men seldom plant\r\n_Trees_ till they begin to be _Wise_, that is, till they grow _Old_,\r\nand find by _Experience_ the _Prudence_ and _Necessity_ of it. When\r\n_Ulysses_, after a ten-years Absence, was return’d from _Troy_, and\r\ncoming home, found his aged _Father_ in the Field planting of _Trees_,\r\nHe asked him, why (being now so far advanc’d in Years) he would put\r\nhimself to the Fatigue and Labour of Planting, _that_ which he was never\r\nlikely to enjoy the Fruits of? The good old Man (taking him for a\r\nStranger) gently reply’d; _I plant_ (says he) _against my Son_ Ulysses\r\n_comes home_. The _Application_ is Obvious and Instructive for both\r\n_Old_ and _Young_. And we have a more modern Instance, almost alike that\r\nof the good old _Laertes_. Here then upon the Complaint of learned\r\nPersons and great Travellers, deploring the loss of many rare and\r\nprecious Things, _Trees_ and _Plants_, especially instancing the\r\n_Balsam_-Tree of _Gilead_ (now almost, if not altogether failing, and no\r\nmore to be found where it grew in great plenty.) He applys himself to\r\nyoung _Eperous_, to consider it seriously, and to fall a planting while\r\ntime is before them, with this incouraging Exclamation, _Agite, ô\r\nAdolescentes, & antequam canities vobis obrepat, stirpes jam alueritis,\r\nquae vobis cum insigni utilitate, delectationem etiam adferent: Nam\r\nquemadmodum canities temporis successu, vobis insciis, sensim obrepit:\r\nSic natura vobis inserviens educabit quod telluri vestrae concredetis,\r\nmodo prima initia illi dederitis_, &c. Pet. Bellonius _De neglecta\r\nstirpium Cultura_. Problema ix.\r\n\r\nMy next _Advice_ is, that they do not easily commit themselves to the\r\n_Dictates_ of their ignorant _Hinds_ and _Servants_,{lxxix:1} who are\r\n(generally speaking) more fit to Learn than to Instruct. _Male agitur cum\r\nDomino quem Villicus docet_, was an Observation of old _Cato_’s; and ’twas\r\n_Ischomachus_ who told _Socrates_ (discoursing one day upon a like\r\nsubject) _That it was far easier to _Make_, than to _Find_ a good\r\nHusband-man_: I have often prov’d it so in _Gardeners_; and I believe it\r\nwill hold in most of our _Country_ Employments: Country People\r\nuniversally know that all Trees consist of _Roots_, _Stems_, _Boughs_,\r\n_Leaves_, &c. but can give no account of the _Species_, _Virtues_, or\r\nfarther Culture, besides the making of a Pit or Hole; casting, and\r\ntreading in the Earth, &c. which require a deeper search, than they are\r\ncapable of: We are then to exact _Labour_, not _Conduct_ and _Reason_,\r\nfrom the greatest part of them; and the business of _Planting_ is an _Art_\r\nor _Science_ (for so _Varro_ has solemnly defined it;{lxxx:1}) and that\r\nexceedingly wide of Truth, which (it seems) many in his time accounted of\r\nit; _facillimam esse, nec ullius acuminis Rusticationem_,{lxxx:2} namely\r\nthat it was an easie and insipid Study. It was the simple _Culture_ only,\r\nwith so much difficulty retrieved from the late confusion of an intestine\r\nand bloody _War_, like that of _Ours_, and now put in _Reputation_ again,\r\nwhich made the noble _Poet_ write,\r\n\r\n            ........How hard it was\r\n    Low Subjects with illustrious words to grace.\r\n            ........_Verbis ea vincere magnum\r\n    Quam sit, & angustis hunc addere rebus honorem._\r\n\r\n    Georg. 3.\r\n\r\nSeeing, as the _Orator_ does himself express it, _Nihil est homine\r\nlibero dignius_; there is nothing more becoming and worthy of a\r\n_Gentleman_, no, not the Majesty of a{lxxx:3} _Consul_. In ancient and\r\nbest Times, Men were not honour’d and esteem’d for the only Learned, who\r\nwere great _Linguists_, profound _Criticks_, Reader and Devourers of\r\nBooks: But such whose Studies consisted of the Discourses, Documents and\r\nObservations of their _Fore-Fathers_, ancient and venerable Persons;\r\nwho, (as the excellent Author of the _Rites_ of the _Israelites_,\r\n_cap._ xv, &c. acquaints us,) were oblig’d to Instruct, and Inform their\r\nChildren of the wonderful Things God had done for their Ancestors;\r\ntogether with the Precepts of the _Moral Law_, _Feasts_, and Religious\r\nCeremonies: But taught them likewise all that concern’d _Agriculture_;\r\njoyn’d with Lessons of perpetual practice; in which they were,\r\ndoubtless, exceedingly knowing; whilst during so many Ages, they\r\nemploy’d themselves almost continually in it: And tho’ now adays this\r\n_noble Art_ be for the most part, left to be exercis’d amongst us, by\r\nPeople of grosser and unthinking Souls; yet there is no _Science_\r\nwhatever, which contains a vaster Compass of Knowledge, infinitely more\r\nuseful and beneficial to Mankind, than the fruitless and empty Notions\r\nof the greatest part of _Speculatists_; counted to be the only _Eruditi_\r\nand learned Men. An _Israelite_, who from _Tradition_ of his\r\nFore-fathers, his own _Experience_, and some modern Reading, had\r\ninform’d himself of the _Religion_ and _Laws_ which were to regulate his\r\nLife; and knew how to procure Things necessary: Who perfectly understood\r\nthe several qualities of the _Earth_, _Plants_, and _Places_ agreeable\r\nto each sort, and to cultivate, propagate, defend them from Accidents,\r\nand bring them to Maturity: That also was skill’d in the nature of\r\n_Cattel_, their Food, Diseases, Remedies, &c. which those who amongst us\r\npass for the most learned and accomplish’d _Gentlemen_, and _Scholars_,\r\nare, for the most part, grosly ignorant of, look upon as _base_,\r\n_rustick_, and things below them: is (in this learned Author’s Opinion)\r\ninfinitely more to be valued, than a Man brought up either in wrangling\r\nat the _Bar_; or the noisie, and ridiculous Disputes of our _Schools_,\r\n&c. To this Sense the learn’d _Modena_. And ’tis remarkable, that after\r\nall that wise _Solomon_ had said, that _All_ was _vanity and vexation of\r\nSpirit_ (among so many _particulars_ he reckons up,) he should be\r\naltogether _silent_, and say nothing concerning _Husbandry_; as,\r\ndoubtless, considering it the most useful, innocent and laudable\r\nEmployment of our Life, requiring those who cultivate the Ground to live\r\nin the Country, remote from _City_-Luxury, and the temptation to the\r\nVices he condemns. It was indeed a plain Man{lxxxii:1} (a _Potter_ by\r\n_Trade_) but let no body despise him because a _Potter_ (_Agathocles_,\r\nand a _King_ was of that _Craft_) who in my Opinion has given us the\r\ntrue reason why _Husbandry_, and particularly _Planting_, is no more\r\nimproved in this Age of ours; especially, where Persons are _Lords_ and\r\nOwners of much _Land_. The truth is, says he, when Men have acquired any\r\nconsiderable _Fortune_ by their _good Husbandry_, and _experience_\r\n(forgetting that the greatest _Patriarchs_, _Princes_, their _Sons_ and\r\n_Daughters_, belonged to the _Plough_, and the _Flock_) they account it\r\na _shame_ to breed up their _Children_ in the same Calling which they\r\nthemselves were educated in, but presently design them _Gentlemen_: They\r\nmust forsooth, have a _Coat_ of _Arms_, and live upon their _Estates_;\r\nSo as by the time his _Sons_ Beard is grown, he begins to be asham’d of\r\nhis _Father_, and would be ready to defie him, that should upon any\r\noccasion mind him of his _honest Extraction_: And if it chance that the\r\ngood Man have other _Children_ to provide for; _This_ must be the\r\nDarling, be bred at _School_, and the _University_, whilst the rest must\r\nto _Cart_ and _Plow_ with the _Father_, &c. This is the _Cause_, says my\r\n_Author_, that our _Lands_ are so ill _Cultivated_ and neglected. Every\r\nbody will subsist upon their own _Revenue_, and take their _Pleasure_,\r\nwhilst they resign their _Estates_ to be manag’d by the most _Ignorant_,\r\nwhich are the _Children_ whom they leave at home, or the _Hinds_ to whom\r\nthey commit them. When as in _truth_, and in _reason_, the more\r\n_Learning_, the better _Philosophers_, and the greater _Abilities_ they\r\npossess, the _more_, and the _better_ are they _qualified_, to\r\n_Cultivate_, and improve their _Estates_: Methinks this is well and\r\nrationally argued.\r\n\r\nAnd now you have in part what I had to produce in extenuation of this\r\n_Adventure_; that _Animated_ with a _Command_, and Assisted by divers\r\n_Worthy Persons_ (whose _Names_ I am prone to _celebrate_ with all just\r\n_Respects_) I have presumed to cast in my _Symbol_; which, with the rest\r\nthat are to follow, may (I hope) be in some degree serviceable to _him_\r\n(who ere the happy _Person_ be) that shall oblige the _World_ with that\r\ncompleat _Systeme_ of _Agriculture_, which as yet seems a _desideratum_,\r\nand wanting to its full perfection. It is (I assure you) what is one of\r\nthe Principal designs of the _ROYAL SOCIETY_, not in this _Particular_\r\nonly, but through all the _Liberal_ and more useful _Arts_; and for\r\nwhich (in the estimation of all equal _Judges_) it will merit the\r\ngreatest of _Encouragements_; that so, at last, what the Learned\r\n_Columella_ has wittily reproached, and complained of, as a defect in\r\nthat _Age_ of _his_, concerning _Agriculture_ in general, and is\r\napplicable _here_, may attain its desired _Remedy_ and _Consummation_ in\r\n_This_ of _Ours_.\r\n\r\n_Sola enim Res Rustica, quae sine dubitatione proxima, & quasi\r\nconsanguinea Sapientiae est, tam discentibus eget, quam magistris: Adhuc\r\nenim Scholas Rhetorum, & Geometrarum, Musicorumque, vel quod magis\r\nmirandum est, contemptissimorum vitiorum officinas, gulosius condiendi\r\ncibos, & luxuriosius fercula struendi, capitumque & capillorum\r\nconcinnatores, non solum esse audivi, sed & ipse vidi; Agricolationis\r\nneque Doctores qui se profiterentur, neque Discipulos cognovi._{lxxxiii:1}\r\nBut this I leave for our _Peruk’d Gallants_ to interpret, and should now\r\napply my self to the _Directive_ Part, which I am all this while\r\nbespeaking, if after what I have said in the several _Paragraphs_ of the\r\nensuing _Discourse_ upon the _Argument_ of _Wood_, (and which in this\r\n_Fourth_ Edition coming _Abroad_ with innumerable _Improvements_, and\r\n_Advantages_ (so furnished, as I hope shall neither reproach the _Author_,\r\nor repent the _Reader_) it might not seem superfluous to have _premised_\r\nany thing _here_ for the Encouragement of so becoming an _Industry_. There\r\nare divers _Learned_, and judicious _Men_ who have _preceded_ Me in this\r\n_Argument_; as many, at least, as have undertaken to Write and Compile\r\nvast _Herbals_, and _Theaters_ of _Plants_; of which we have some of our\r\nown _Country-men_, (especially, the most Industrious and Learned Mr.\r\n_Ray_) who have (boldly I dare affirm it) surpass’d _any_, if not all the\r\n_Foreigners_ that are extant: In _those_ it is you meet with the\r\n_Description_ of the several _Plants_, by _Discourses_, _Figures_,\r\n_Names_, _Places_ of _Growth_; time of _Flourishing_, and their _Medicinal\r\nVirtues_; which may supply any _deficiency_ of mine as to those\r\n_Particulars_; if forbearing the _Repetition_, it should by any be imputed\r\nfor a _defect_, though it were indeed none of my _design_: I say, these\r\nthings are long since performed to our hands: But there is none of these\r\n(that I at least know of, and are come to my perusal) who have taken any\r\nconsiderable pains how to _Direct_, and _Encourage_ us in the _Culture_ of\r\n_Forest-Trees_ (the grand _defect_ of this _Nation_) besides some small\r\nsprinklings to be met withal in _Gervas Markham_, old _Tusser_, and of\r\n_Foreigners_, the _Country-Farm_ long since translated out of French, and\r\nby no means suitable to our Clime and _Country_: Neither have any of these\r\nproceeded after my _Method_, and particularly, in _Raising_, _Planting_,\r\n_Dressing_, and _Governing_, &c. or so sedulously made it their business,\r\nto _specifie_ the _Mechanical Uses_ of the _several kinds_, as I have\r\ndone, which was hitherto a great _desideratum_, and in which the _Reader_\r\nwill likewise find some things altogether _New_ and _Instructive_; and\r\nboth _Directions_ and _Encouragements_ for the Propagation of some\r\n_Foreign_ Curiosities of _Ornament_ and _Use_, which were hitherto\r\nneglected. If I have upon occasion presumed to say any thing concerning\r\ntheir _Medicinal_ properties, it has been _Modestly_ and Frugally, and\r\nwith chief, if not only respect to the poor _Wood-man_, whom none I\r\npresume will envy, that living far from the _Physician_, he should in case\r\nof _Necessity_, consult the reverend _Druid_, his{lxxxv:1} _Oaks_ and his\r\n_Elm_, _Birch_, or _Elder_, for a short _Breath_, a Green _Wound_, or a\r\nsore _Leg_; Casualties incident to this hard _Labour_. These are the chief\r\n_Particulars_ of this ensuing _Work_, and what it pretends hitherto of\r\n_Singular_, in which let me be permitted to say, There is sufficient for\r\n_Instruction_, and more than is extant in any _Collection_ whatsoever\r\n(_absit verbo invidia_) in this way and upon this _Subject_; abstracting\r\nthings _Practicable_, of solid _use_ and _material_, from the\r\n_Ostentation_ and Impertinences of divers _Writers_; who receiving all\r\nthat came to hand on trust, to swell their monstrous _Volumes_, have\r\nhitherto impos’d upon the credulous _World_, without _conscience_ or\r\n_honesty_. I will not exasperate the _Adorers_ of our ancient and late\r\n_Naturalists_, by repeating of what our _Verulam_ has justly pronounced\r\nconcerning their _Rhapsodies_ (because I likewise honour their painful\r\n_Endeavours_, and am obliged to them for much of that I know,) nor will I\r\n(with some) reproach _Pliny_, _Porta_, _Cardan_, _Mizaldus_, _Cursius_,\r\nand many others of great _Names_ (whose _Writings_ I have diligently\r\nconsulted) for the _Knowledge_ they have imparted to me on this Occasion;\r\nbut I must deplore the time which is (for the most part) so miserably lost\r\nin pursuit of their _Speculations_, where they treat upon this _Argument_:\r\nBut the _World_ is now advis’d, and (blessed be _God_) infinitely redeem’d\r\nfrom that base and servile submission of our noblest _Faculties_ to their\r\nblind _Traditions_. This you will be apt to say, is a haughty _Period_;\r\nbut whilst I affirm it of the _Past_, it _justifies_, and does _honour_\r\nto the _Present_ Industry of our _Age_, and of which there cannot be a\r\n_greater_ and more emulous _Instance_, than the _Passion_ of His _Majesty_\r\nto encourage his _Subjects_, and of the _Royal Society_, (His _Majesty’s\r\nFoundation_) who receive and promote His _Dictates_, in all that is\r\nlaudable and truly _emolumental_ of this Nature.\r\n\r\nIt is not therefore that I here presume to instruct _Him_ in the\r\nmanagement of that great and august _Enterprise_ of resolving to _Plant_\r\nand repair His ample _Forests_, and other _Magazines_ of _Timber_, for\r\nthe benefit of His _Royal Navy_, and the glory of His _Kingdoms_; but to\r\npresent to His _Sacred Majesty_, and to the _World_, what _Advices_ I\r\nhave received from _others_, observed my self, and most industriously\r\n_collected_ from a studious Propensity to serve as one of the least\r\n_Intelligences_ in the ampler _Orb_ of our _Illustrious Society_, and in\r\na _Work_ so necessary and important.\r\n\r\nAnd now since I mention’d the _Society_, give me leave (Worthy Reader)\r\nas a _Member_ of that _Body_, which has been the chief _Promoter_ of\r\nthis ensuing _Work_, (and, as I stand oblig’d) to _vindicate_ that\r\n_Assembly_, and consequently, the _Honour_ of his _Majesty_ and the\r\n_Nation_, in a _Particular_ which concerns it, though (in appearance) a\r\nlittle forreign to the present _Subject_.\r\n\r\nI will not say that _all_ which I have written in the several\r\n_Paragraphs_ of this _Treatise_, is _New_; but that there are very many\r\n_New_, and _useful_ things, and _Observations_ (without insisting on the\r\n_Methods_ only) not hitherto deliver’d by any _Author_, and so freely\r\ncommunicated, I hope will sufficiently appear: It is not therefore in\r\nbehalf of any Particular which concerns _my self_, that I have been\r\ninduced to enlarge this _Preface_; but, by taking this _Occasion_, to\r\nencounter the unsufferable _Boldness_, or _Ambition_ of some _Persons_\r\n(as well _Strangers_, as others) _arrogating_ to themselves the being\r\n_Inventors_ of divers _New_ and useful _Experiments_, justly\r\nattributable to several _Members_ of the _Royal Society_.{lxxxvii:1}\r\n\r\nSo far has that _Assembly_ been from affecting _Glory_, that they seem\r\nrather to have declin’d their due; not as asham’d of so numerous and\r\nfair an _Off-spring_; but as abundantly satisfied, that after all the\r\nhard measure, and virulent _Reproaches_ they had sustain’d, for\r\nendeavouring by _united Attempts_, and at their own _Charges_, to\r\nimprove _Real Philosophy_; they had from time to time, cultivated that\r\n_Province_ in so many _useful_ and profitable _Instances_, as are\r\nalready _published_ to the _World_, and will be easily _asserted_ to\r\ntheir _Authors_ before all _equitable_ Judges.\r\n\r\nThis being the sole inducement of publishing this _Apology_; it may not\r\nperhaps seem unseasonable to _disabuse_ some (otherwise) _well-meaning_\r\nPeople, who _led away_ and _perverted_ by the _Noise_ of a few\r\n_Ignorant_ and _Comical Buffoons_, (whose _Malevolence_, or\r\n_Impertinencies_ intitle them to nothing that is truly _Great_ and\r\n_Venerable_) are with an _Insolence_ suitable to their _Understanding_,\r\nstill crying out, and asking, _What have the Society done?_\r\n\r\nNow, as nothing less than _Miracles_ (and unless _God_ should every day\r\n_repeat_ them at the _Call_ of these _Extravagants_) will _convince_\r\nsome Persons, of the most _Rational_ and _Divine Truths_, (already so\r\noften and extraordinarily establish’d;) so, nor will any thing\r\n_satisfie_ these _unreasonable_ Men, but the production of the\r\n_Philosophers-stone_, and _Great-Elixir_; which yet were they\r\n_Possessors_ of, they would _consume_ upon their _Lux_ and _Vanity_.\r\n\r\nIt is not therefore to gratifie these _magnificent Fops_, whose\r\n_Talents_ reach but to the adjusting of their _Peruques_, courting a\r\n_Miss_, or at the farthest writing a smutty, or scurrilous _Libel_,\r\n(which they would have to pass for _genuine_ Wit) that I _concern_ my\r\nself in these _papers_; but, as well in _Honour_ of our _Royal Founder_,\r\nas the _Nation_, to _Assert_ what of other _Countries_ has been\r\nsurreptitiously _Arrogated_, and by which, they not only value\r\nthemselves _abroad_; but (prevailing on the Modesty of that Industrious\r\n_Assembly_) seek the _deference_ of _those_, who whilst it remains still\r\n_silent_, do not so clearly discern this glorious _Plumage_ to be purely\r\n_ascititious_, and not a _Feather_ of their own. --But still, _What have\r\nthey done?_\r\n\r\nThose who perfectly comprehend the _Scope_, and _End_ of that noble\r\n_Institution_; which is to _improve Natural Knowledge_, and inlarge the\r\n_Empire_ of _Operative Philosophy_; not by an _Abolition_ of the _Old_,\r\nbut by the _Real Effects_ of the _Experimental_; _Collecting_,\r\n_Examining_, and _Improving_ their scatter’d _Phænomena_, to establish\r\neven the _Received Methods_ and _Principles_ of the _Schools_ (as far as\r\nwere consistent with _Truth_, and _matter_ of _Fact_) thought it long\r\nenough, that the World had been _impos’d_ upon by that _Notional_, and\r\n_Formal_ way of delivering divers _Systems_ and _Bodies_ of\r\n_Philosophie_ (falsely so call’d) beyond which there was no more\r\n_Country_ to discover; which being brought to the _Test_ and _Tryal_,\r\nvapours all away in _Fume_, and empty _Sound_.\r\n\r\nThis _Structure_ then being thus _Ruinous_ and _Crazy_; ’tis obvious\r\nwhat they were to do; even the same which skilful _Architects_ do every\r\nday before us; by _pulling down_ the decay’d and sinking Wall to erect a\r\n_better_, and more _substantial_ in its place: They not only take down\r\nthe _old_, reject the useless and decay’d; but sever such _Materials_ as\r\nare _solid_, and will serve again; bring _new-ones_ in, prepare and\r\nframe a _Model_ suitable to so _magnificent_ a _Design_: This _Solomon_\r\ndid in order to the _Building_ of the _Material Temple_; and _this_ is\r\nhere to be pursued in the _Intellectual_: Nay, here was abundance of\r\n_Rubbish_ to be clear’d, that the _Area_ might be free; and then was the\r\n_Foundation_ to be deeply searched, the _Materials_ accurately\r\n_examined_, _squared_, and _adjusted_, before it could be laid: Nor was\r\nthis the _Labour_ of a _Few_; less than a much longer time, more Cost\r\nand Encouragement than any which the _Society_ has yet met withal, could\r\nin reason be sufficient effectually to go through so chargeable a Work,\r\nand highly necessary.\r\n\r\nA long time it was they had been surveying the _Decays_, of what was\r\nready now to drop in pieces, whatever shew the out-side made with a\r\nnoise of _Elements_ and _Qualities_, _Occult_ and _Evident_; abhorrence\r\nof _Vacuum_, _Sympathies_, _Antipathies_; _Substantial Forms_, and\r\n_Prime matter_ courting _Form_; _Epicycles_, _Ptolemæan Hypotheses_,\r\nmagisterial _Definitions_, peremptory _Maximes_, _Speculative_, and\r\n_Positive Doctrines_, and _alti-sonant Phrases_, with a thousand other\r\n_precarious_ and unintelligible _Notions_, &c. all which they have been\r\nturning over, to see if they could find any thing of _sincere_ and\r\n_useful_ among this _Pedantick Rubbish_, but all in _vain_; here was\r\nnothing _material_, nothing of moment _Mathematical_, or _Mechanical_,\r\nand which had not been miserably _sophisticated_, on which to lay the\r\nstress; nothing in a manner whereby any farther _Progress_ could be\r\nmade, for the _raising_ and _ennobling_ the _Dignity_ of _Mankind_ in\r\nthe _Sublimest Operations_ of the _Rational Faculty_, by _clearing_ the\r\n_Obscurities_, and _healing_ the _Defects_ of most of the _Phisiological\r\nHypotheses_, repugnant, as they hitherto seemed to be, to the\r\n_Principles_ of real _Knowledge_ and _Experience_.\r\n\r\nNow although it neither were their _Hopes_, or in their prospect to\r\n_consummate_ a _Design_ requiring so _mighty Aids_, (inviron’d as they\r\nhave been with these Prejudices) yet have they not at all _desisted_\r\nfrom the _Enterprize_; but rather than so Noble and Illustrious an\r\n_Undertaking_ should not proceed for want of some generous and\r\nindustrious _Spirits_ to promote the _Work_; they have _themselves_\r\nsubmitted to those mean _Imployments_, of _digging_ in the very\r\n_Quarry_; yea even and of making _Brick_ where there was no _Straw_, but\r\nwhat they gleaned, and lay dispersed up and down: Nor did they think\r\ntheir Pains yet _ill bestow’d_, if through the assiduous _Labour_, and a\r\n_Train_ of continual _Experiments_, they might at last furnish, and\r\nleave solid and uncorrupt _Materials_ to a _succeeding_, and more\r\n_grateful Age_, for the _building up_ a _Body_ of _real_ and\r\n_substantial Philosophy_, which should never _succumb_ to _Time_, but\r\nwith the _Ruines_ of _Nature_, and the _World_ it self.\r\n\r\nIn order to _this_, how many, and almost _innumerable_ have been their\r\n_Tryals_ and _Experiments_, through the large and ample Field both of\r\n_Art_ and _Nature_? We call our _Journals_, _Registers_,\r\n_Correspondence_, and _Transactions_, to witness; and may with modesty\r\nprovoke all our _Systematical Methodists_, _Natural Histories_, and\r\n_Pretenders_ hitherto extant from the _beginning_ of _Letters_, to this\r\n_period_, to shew us so _ample_, so _worthy_ and so _useful_ a\r\nCollection. ’Tis a _Fatality_ and an _Injury_ to be deplored, that those\r\nwho give us _hard words_, will not first vouchsafe _impartially_ to\r\n_examine_ these _particulars_; since all _Ingenuous Spirits_ could not\r\nbut be abundantly _satisfied_, that this _Illustrious Assembly_ has not\r\nmet so many _Years_ purely for _Speculation_ only; though I take even\r\n_that_ to be no ignoble _Culture_ of the _Mind_, or time mispent for\r\nPersons who have so few _Friends_, and slender _Obligations_, to those\r\nwho should _Patronize_ and _Encourage_ them: But they have aimed at\r\n_greater things_, and _greater things_ produc’d, namely, by\r\n_Emancipating_, and freeing themselves from the _Tyranny_ of _Opinion_,\r\n_delusory_ and fallacious shews, to receive nothing upon _Trust_, but\r\nbring it to the _Lydian Touch_, make it pass the _Fire_, the _Anvil_ and\r\nthe _File_, till it come forth perfectly _repurged_, and of consistence.\r\nThey are not hasty in _concluding_ from a _single_, or _incompetent_\r\nnumber of _Experiments_, to pronounce the _Ecstatic Heureca_, and offer\r\n_Hecatombs_; but, after the most diligent _Scrutiny_, and by degrees,\r\nand wary _Inductions_ _honestly_ and _faithfully_ made, to _record_ the\r\n_Truth_, and event of _Tryals_, and transmit them to _Posterity_. They\r\nresort not immediately to _general Propositions_, upon every _specious\r\nappearance_; but stay for _Light_, and Information from _Particulars_,\r\nand make Report _de Facto_, and as _Sense_ informs them. They reject no\r\n_Sect_ of _Philosophers_, no _Mechanic_ Helps, _except_ no _Persons_ of\r\nMen; but chearfully embracing _all_, cull out of _all_, and alone\r\n_retain_ what abides the _Test_; that from a plentiful and well\r\nfurnish’d _Magazine_ of true _Experiments_, they may in time advance to\r\nsolemn and established _Axiomes_, _General Rules_ and _Maximes_; and a\r\n_Structure_ may indeed lift up its head, such as may stand the shock of\r\n_Time_, and render a solid accompt of the _Phænomena_, and _Effects_ of\r\n_Nature_, the _Aspectable Works of God_, and their _Combinations_; so as\r\nby _Causes_ and _Effects_, _certain_ and _useful_ Consequences may be\r\ndeduced. Therefore they do not fill their _Papers_ with _Transcripts_\r\nout of _Rhapsodists_, _Mountebancs_, and Compilers of _Receipts_ and\r\n_Secrets_, to the loss of Oil and Labour; but as it were, _eviscerating_\r\nNature, disclosing the _Ressorts_, and Springs of _Motion_, have\r\n_collected_ innumerable _Experiments_, _Histories_ and _Discourses_; and\r\nbrought in _Specimens_ for the Improvement of _Astronomy_, _Geography_,\r\n_Navigation_, _Optics_; all the Parts of _Agriculture_, the _Garden_ and\r\nthe _Forest_; _Anatomy_ of _Plants_, and _Animals_; _Mines_ and _Ores_;\r\n_Measures_ and _Æquations_ of _Time_ by accurate _Pendulums_, and other\r\nMotions, _Hydro_- and _Hygrostatics_, divers _Engines_, Powers and\r\n_Automata_, with innumerable more _luciferous_ particulars, subservient\r\nto human life, of which Dr. _Glanvil_ has given an ample and ingenious\r\n_Accompt_ in his learned Essay: And _since_ in the _Posthumous_ Works of\r\nDr. _Hooke_, lately publish’d by the most obliging Mr. _Waller_, already\r\nmention’d.\r\n\r\nThis is (_Reader_) what they have done; and they are but _part_ of the\r\n_Materials_ which the _Society_ have hitherto _amassed_, and prepared\r\nfor this great and _Illustrious Work_; not to pass over an infinity of\r\n_solitary_, and loose _Experiments_ subsidiary to it, gathered at no\r\nsmall Pains and Cost: For so have they hitherto born the _Burden and\r\nHeat of the day alone_; _Sapping_ and _Mining_ to lay the _Foundation_\r\ndeep, and raise a _Superstructure_ to be one day perfected, by the joint\r\n_Endeavours_ of those who shall in a _kinder_ Age have little else to\r\ndo, but the _putting_ and _cementing_ of the _Parts_ together, which to\r\n_collect_ and fit, have cost them so much Solicitude and Care. _Solomon_\r\nindeed built the glorious _Temple_; but ’twas _David_ provided the\r\n_Materials_: Did Men in those days insolently ask, _What he had done_,\r\nin all the time of that tedious preparation? I beseech you what\r\n_Obligation_ has the _R. Society_ to render an _Accompt_ of their\r\nProceedings to _any_ who are not of the _Body_, and that carry on the\r\n_Work_ at their own _expence_ amidst so many Contradictions? It is an\r\n_Evil Spirit_, and an _Evil Age_, which having sadly _debauch’d_ the\r\n_Minds_ of Men; seeks with Industry to blast and undermine all\r\n_Attempts_ and Endeavours that signifie to the Illustration of _Truth_,\r\nthe discovery of _Impostors_, and shake their sandy Foundations.\r\n\r\n_Those who come (_says the noble _Verulam__) to enquire after\r\n_Knowledge_, with a mind to _scorn_, shall be sure to find matter for\r\ntheir _Humor_; but none for their _Instruction_: _Would_ Men bring light\r\nof _Invention_, and not fire-brands of _Contradiction_, Knowledge would\r\ninfinitely increase._ But these are the _Sanballats_ and _Horonites_\r\nwho disturb our Men upon the Wall{xciii:1}: But, _let us rise up and\r\nbuild_, and be no more discourag’d. ’Tis impossible to conceive, how so\r\nhonest, and worthy a _Design_ should have found so few _Promoters_, and\r\ncold a welcome in a _Nation_ whose _Eyes_ are so wide open: We see how\r\ngreedily the _French_, and other _Strangers_ embrace and cultivate the\r\n_Design_: What sumptuous _Buildings_, well furnish’d _Observatories_,\r\nample _Appointments_, _Salaries_, and _Accommodations_, they have\r\nerected to carry on the Work; whilst we live _precariously_, and spin\r\nthe _Web_ out of our own _Bowels_. Indeed we have had the Honour to be\r\nthe _first_ who led the _way_, given the _Ferment_, which like a _Train_\r\nhas taken _Fire_, and warm’d the _Regions_ all about us. _This Glory,\r\ndoubtless, shall none take from us_: But whilst they flourish so\r\n_abroad_, we want the _Spirit_ should diffuse it here at _home_, and\r\ngive progress to so hopeful a _beginning_: But as we said, the _Enemy_\r\nof _Mankind_ has done us this despite; it is his Interest to impeach (in\r\nany sort) what e’re opposes his _Dominion_; which is to lead, and settle\r\nMen in _Errors_ as well in _Arts_ and _Natural Knowledge_, as in\r\n_Religion_; and therefore would be glad, the World should still be\r\n_groping_ after _both_. ’Tis _he_ that sets the _Buffoons_, and empty\r\n_Sycophants_, to turn all that’s _Great_ and _Virtuous_ into _Raillery_\r\nand Derision: ’Tis therefore to encounter _these_, that like those\r\nresolute _Builders_,{xciii:2} whilst we employ one hand in the Work,\r\n_we_, with the _other_ are oblig’d to hold our _Weapon_, till some bold,\r\nand _Gallant Genius_ deliver us, and raise the Siege. How gloriously\r\nwould such a _Benefactor_ shine! What a _Constellation_ would he make!\r\nHow great a _Name_ establish! For mine own part (_Religiously_ I\r\n_profess_ it) were I not a _Person_, who (whilst I stood expecting when\r\nothers more worthy, and able than my self, should have snatch’d the\r\nOpportunity of _signalizing_ a Work worthy of _Immortality_) had long\r\nsince given _Hostages_ to _Fortune_, and so put my self out of a\r\nCapacity of shewing my _Affection_ to a _Design_ so glorious; I would\r\nnot only most chearfully have _contributed_ towards the freeing it from\r\nthe _Straits_ it has so long struggl’d under; but _sacrific’d_ all my\r\n_Secular Interests_ in their Service: But, as I said, this is reserv’d\r\nfor that Gallant _Hero_ (whoe’er it be) that truly weighing the noble\r\nand universal _Consequence_ of so high an _Enterprize_, shall at last\r\nfree it of these _Reproaches_; and either set it above the reach of\r\n_Envy_, or convert it to _Emulation_. This were indeed to consult an\r\nhonest _Fame_, and to _embalm_ the _Memory_ of a _Greater Name_ than any\r\nhas yet appear’d amongst all the _Benefactors_ of the _Disputing Sects_:\r\nLet it suffice to affirm, that next the _Propagation_ of our most _Holy\r\nFaith_, and its _Appendants_, (nor can His _Majesty_ or the _Nation_\r\nbuild their _Fame_ on a more _lasting_, a more _Glorious Monument_;) The\r\nPropagation of _Learning_, and _useful Arts_, having always surviv’d the\r\n_Triumphs_ of the proudest _Conquerors_, and Spillers of humane\r\n_Blood_;) _Princes_ have been more _Renown’d_ for their Civility to\r\n_Arts_ and _Letters_, than to all their _Sanguinary Victories_, subduing\r\n_Provinces_, and making those brutish _Desolations_ in the World, to\r\nfeed a _salvage_ and vile _Ambition_. Witness you _Great Alexander_, and\r\nyou the _Ptolemees_, _Cæsars_, _Charemain_, _Francis_ the First; the\r\n_Cosimo’s_, _Frederic’s_, _Alphonsus’s_, and the rest of _Learned\r\nPrinces_: Since when all the _Pomp_ and Noise is ended; They are those\r\n_little things_ in _black_ (whom now in scorn they term _Philosophers_\r\nand _Fopps_) to whom they must be oblig’d, for making their _Names_\r\noutlast the _Pyramids_ whose _Founders_ are as unknown as the Heads of\r\n_Nile_; because they either deserv’d no _Memory_ for their _Vertues_, or\r\nhad none to transmit them, or their _Actions_ to _Posterity_.\r\n\r\nIs not our R. _Founder_ already _Panegyriz’d_ by all the _Universities_,\r\n_Academists_, _Learned Persons_, divers _Princes_ _Ambassadors_, and\r\n_Illustrious_ Men from _abroad_? Witness besides, the many accurate\r\n_Treatises_ and _Volumes_ of the most _curious_ and _useful_ Subjects,\r\n_Medicinal_, _Mathematical_, and _Mechanical_, dedicated to His\r\n_Majesty_ as _Founder_; to its _President_, and to the _Society_, by the\r\ngreatest _Wits_, and most profoundly knowing of the _European_ World,\r\ncelebrating their _Institution_ and _Proceedings_: Witness, the daily\r\nSubmissions and solemn _Appeals_ of the most learned _Strangers_ to its\r\n_Suffrages_, as to the most able, candid and impartial _Judges_:\r\nWitness, the _Letters_, and _Correspondencies_ from most parts of the\r\n_habitable Earth_, _East_, and _West Indies_, and almost from _Pole to\r\nPole_; besides what they have receiv’d from the very Mouths of divers\r\n_Professors_, _Publique Ministers_, great _Travellers_, _Noblemen_, and\r\nPersons of highest Quality; who have not only frequented the _Assembly_,\r\nbut desir’d to be _Incorporated_ and _ascrib’d_ into their _Number_; so\r\nlittle has his _Majesty_, or the _Kingdom_ been diminish’d in their\r\nReputation, by the _Royal Society_, to the reproach of our sordid\r\n_Adversaries_: Never had the _Republique_ of _Letters_ so learned and\r\nuniversal a _Correspondence_ as has been procur’d and promoted by this\r\n_Society_ alone; as not only the casual _Transactions_ of several Years\r\n(filled with _Instances_ of the most curious and useful _Observations_)\r\nmake appear; but (as I said) the many _Nuncupatory Epistles_ to be seen\r\nin the Fronts of so many _learned Volumes_: There it is you will find\r\nCHARLES the II. plac’d among the _Heroes_ and _Demi-Gods_, for his\r\n_Patrociny_ and _Protection_: There you will see the numerous\r\n_Congratulations_ of the most learned _Foreigners_, celebrating the\r\nHappiness of their _Institution_; and that whilst other _Nations_ are\r\nstill _benighted_ under the dusky _Cloud_, such a refulgent Beam should\r\ngive day to this _blessed Isle_: And certainly, it is not to be supposed\r\nthat _all_ these _Learned Persons_, of so many, and divers _Interests_,\r\nas well as _Countries_, should _speak_, and _write_ thus out of\r\n_Flattery_, much less of _Ignorance_; being Men of the most refin’d\r\n_Universal Knowledge_, as well as _Ingenuity_: But I should never _end_,\r\nwere I to pursue this fruitful _Topic_. I have but one word more to add,\r\nto conciliate the _Favour_ and Esteem of our own _Universities_, to an\r\n_Assembly_ of _Gentlemen_, who _from them_ acknowledge to have derived\r\nall their _Abilities_ for these laudable Undertakings; and what above\r\nall is most _shining_ in them of most _Christian_, _Moral_, and\r\notherwise conspicuous, as from the _Source_ and _Fountain_, to which on\r\nall occasions, they are not only ready to pay the _Tribute_ and\r\n_Obsequiousness_ of _humble Servants_, but of _Sons_, and dutiful\r\n_Alumni_. There is nothing verily which they more desire, than a fair\r\nand mutual _Correspondence_ between so near _Relations_, and that they\r\nmay be perpetually _Flourishing_ and _Fruitful_ in bringing forth (as\r\nstill they do) supplies to _Church_ and _State_ in all its great\r\nCapacities:{xcvi:1} Finally, that they would regard the _Royal Society_\r\nas a _Colony_ of their own _planting_, and _augure_ it _Success_. And if\r\nin these _Labours_, and arduous _Attempts_, several _Inventions_ of\r\npresent use and service to _Mankind_ (either detecting _Errors_,\r\nillustrating and asserting _Truths_, or propagating _Knowledge_ in\r\n_natural things_, and the visible _Works_ of _God_) have been\r\ndiscover’d, as they _envy_ not the _communicating_ them to the _World_;\r\nso should they be _wanting_ to the _Society_, and to the _Honour_ of\r\ndivers _Learned_ and _Ingenious Persons_, (who are the _Soul_ and _Body_\r\nof it) not to vindicate them from the ambitious _Plagiary_, the Insults\r\nof _Scoffers_ and injurious Men: Certainly, Persons of right _Noble_ and\r\nsubacted _Principles_, that were _Lovers_ of their _Country_, should be\r\notherwise affected; and rather strive to _encourage_, and promote\r\nEndeavours tending to so _generous_ a _Design_, than decry it;\r\nespecially, when it costs them nothing but their _Civility_ to so many\r\n_obliging Persons_, though they should hitherto have entertain’d them\r\nbut with some innocent _Diversions_. To conclude, we _envy_ none their\r\n_Dues_; nay we gratefully _acknowledge_ any _Light_ which we receive\r\neither from _Home_, or from _Abroad_: We _celebrate_ and _record_ their\r\n_Names_ amongst our _Benefactors_; recommend them to the _Publique_; and\r\nwhat we thus _freely give_, we hope as _freely_ to _receive_.\r\n\r\nThus have I endeavour’d to _Vindicate_ the _Royal Society_ from some\r\n_Aspersions_ and _Incroachments_ it hitherto has suffer’d; and shew’d\r\nunder what _Weights_ and _Pressure_ this _Palm_ does still emerge: And\r\nif for all this I fall short of my _Attempt_, I shall yet have this\r\nsatisfaction, That tho I derive no _Glory_ from my own _Abilities_\r\n(sensible of my great _Defects_) I shall yet _deserve_ their _pardon_\r\nfor my _Zeal_ to its _Prosperity_.\r\n\r\n  _Epictetus_, κθ.\r\n\r\n  Φιλοσοφίας ἐπιθυμεῖς‧ παρασκευάζου αὐτόθεν, &c.\r\n\r\nWouldst thou be a _Philosopher_; Prepare thy self for _Scoffs_: What,\r\nyou are setting up for a _Virtuoso_ now? Why so proud I pray? Well, be\r\nnot thou proud for all this; But so persist in what seems _best_ and\r\n_laudable_; as if _God_ himself had plac’d thee there; and _remember_,\r\nthat so long as thou _remain’st_ in that _State_ and _Resolution_, thy\r\n_Reproachers_ will in time _admire_ thee: But if once through\r\n_Inconstancy_ thou _give out_ & _flinch_, διπλοῦν προσλήψῃ καταγέλωτα,\r\nThou _deservest_ to be doubly _laugh’d_ at.\r\n\r\n  Lord _Verulam_, Instaur. Scient.\r\n\r\nSome Men (like _Lucian_ in _Religion_) seek by their _Wit_, to\r\n_traduce_ and _expose useful things_; because to arrive at them, they\r\nconverse with _mean Experiments_: But those who _despise_ to be\r\n_employ’d_ in _ordinary_ and _common matters_, never arrive to _solid\r\nPerfection_ in _Experimental Knowledge_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe changes and _Alterations_ in the several _Chapters_ and Parts\r\nthroughout this _Discourse_, with the _Additions_ and _Improvements_,\r\nhave often oblig’d me to alter the _Method_, and indeed to make it\r\nalmost a _New Work_.\r\n\r\n  _J.

Evelyn,_ Esquire._\r\n\r\n\r\nI never had any other Desire so strong, and so like to Covetousness as\r\nthat one which I have had always, That I might be Master at last of a\r\nsmall House and large Garden, with very moderate Conveniencies joined to\r\nthem, and there dedicate the remainder of my Life only to the Culture of\r\nthem, and study of Nature,\r\n\r\n    And there (with no Design beyond my Wall) whole and entire to lie,\r\n    In no unactive Ease, and no unglorious Poverty;\r\n\r\nOr as _Virgil_ has said, shorter and better for me, that I might there\r\n_Studiis florere ignobilis otî_ (though I could wish that he had rather\r\nsaid, _Nobilis otii_, when he spoke of his own:) But several accidents\r\nof my ill Fortune have disappointed me hitherto, and do still of that\r\nFelicity; for though I have made the first and hardest step to it, by\r\nabandoning all Ambitions and Hopes in this World, and by retiring from\r\nthe noise of all Business and almost Company; yet I stick still in the\r\nInn of a hired House and Garden, among Weeds and Rubbish; and without\r\nthat pleasantest Work of Human Industry, the Improvement of something\r\nwhich we call (not very properly, but yet we call) our own. I am gone\r\nout from _Sodom_, but I am not yet arrived at my little _Zoar_: _O let\r\nme escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my Soul shall live._ I\r\ndo not look back yet: but I have been forced to stop, and make too many\r\nhalts. You may wonder, Sir, (for this seems a little too extravagant and\r\nPindarical for _Prose_) what I mean by all this Preface; it is to let\r\nyou know, That though I have mist, like a Chymist, my great End, yet I\r\naccount my Affections and Endeavours well rewarded by something that I\r\nhave met with by the bye; which is, that they have procur’d to me some\r\npart in your Kindness and esteem; and thereby the honour of having my\r\nName so advantagiously recommended to Posterity, by the _Epistle_ you\r\nare pleased to prefix to the _most useful Book_ that has been written in\r\nthat kind, and which is to last as long as Months and Years.\r\n\r\nAmong many other _Arts_ and _Excellencies_ which you enjoy, I am glad to\r\nfind this Favourite of mine the most predominant, That you choose this\r\nfor your Wife, though you have hundreds of other Arts for your\r\nConcubines; though you know them, and beget Sons upon them all, (to\r\nwhich you are rich enough to allow great Legacies) yet the issue of this\r\nseems to be design’d by you to the main of the Estate; you have taken\r\nmost pleasure in it, and bestow’d most Charges upon its Education; and I\r\ndoubt not to see that Book, which you are pleased to promise to the\r\nWorld, and of which you have given us a large earnest in your Calendar,\r\nas accomplish’d, as any thing can be expected from an _Extraordinary\r\nApplication_, and no ordinary Expences, and a long Experience. I know no\r\nbody that possesses more private Happiness than you do in your Garden;\r\nand yet no Man who makes his Happiness more publick, by a free\r\ncommunication of the Art and Knowledge of it to others. All that I my\r\nself am able yet to do, is only to recommend to Mankind the search of\r\nthat Felicity, which you instruct them how to find and to enjoy.\r\n\r\n                           1.\r\n\r\n            Happy art thou whom God does bless\r\n        With the full choice of thine own Happiness;\r\n            And happier yet, because thou’rt blest\r\n            With Prudence how to choose the best:\r\n        In Books and Gardens thou hast plac’d aright\r\n            (Things well which thou dost understand,\r\n        And both dost make with thy laborious hand)\r\n            Thy noble innocent delight:\r\n    And in thy virtuous Wife, where thou again dost meet\r\n            Both Pleasures more refin’d and sweet:\r\n            The fairest Garden in her Looks,\r\n            And in her Mind the wisest Books.\r\n        Oh! who would change these soft, yet solid Joys,\r\n            For empty Shows and senseless Noise;\r\n            And all which rank Ambition breeds,\r\n    Which seem such beauteous Flowers, and are such poisonous Weeds?\r\n\r\n                          2.\r\n\r\n        When God did Man to his own Likeness make,\r\n        As much as Clay, though of the purest kind,\r\n            By the great Potters Art refin’d,\r\n            Could the Divine Impression take:\r\n            He thought it fit to place him, where\r\n            A kind of Heav’n too did appear,\r\n        As far as Earth could such a likeness bear:\r\n            That Man no Happiness might want,\r\n        Which Earth to her first Master could afford;\r\n            He did a Garden for him plant\r\n        By the quick hand of his Omnipotent Word.\r\n        As the chief Help and Joy of Humane Life,\r\n    He gave him the first Gift; first, ev’n before a Wife.\r\n\r\n                          3.\r\n\r\n        For God, the universal Architect,\r\n            ’T had been as easie to erect\r\n        A Louvre, or Escurial, or a Tower,\r\n        That might with Heav’n communication hold\r\n        As _Babel_ vainly thought to do of old:\r\n            He wanted not the skill or power,\r\n            In the World’s Fabrick those were shown,\r\n        And the Materials were all his own.\r\n        But well he knew what place would best agree\r\n        With Innocence, and with Felicity:\r\n        And we elsewhere still seek for them in vain,\r\n        If any part of either yet remain;\r\n        If any part of either we expect,\r\n        This may our judgement in the search direct;\r\n    God the first Garden made, and the first City, _Cain_.\r\n\r\n                          4.\r\n\r\n        O blessed Shades! O gentle cool retreat\r\n            From all th’ immoderate Heat,\r\n        In which the frantick World does burn and sweat!\r\n        This does the Lion Star, Ambitions rage;\r\n        This Avarice, the Dog-Stars Thirst asswage;\r\n        Every where else their fatal Power we see,\r\n        They make and rule Man’s wretched Destiny:\r\n            They neither set, nor disappear,\r\n            But tyrannize o’er all the Year;\r\n        Whil’st we ne’er feel their Flame or Influence here.\r\n            The Birds that dance from Bough to Bough,\r\n            And sing above in every Tree,\r\n            Are not from Fears and Cares more free,\r\n            Than we who lie, or walk below,\r\n            And should by right be Singers too.\r\n        What Princes Quire of Musick can excel\r\n            That which within this Shade does dwell?\r\n            To which we nothing pay or give,\r\n            They like all other Poets live,\r\n        Without Reward, or Thanks for their obliging Pains;\r\n            ’Tis well if they become not Prey:\r\n        The Whistling Winds add their less artful Strains,\r\n        And a grave Base the murmuring Fountains play;\r\n        Nature does all this Harmony bestow,\r\n            But to our Plants, Arts, Musick too,\r\n        The Pipe, Theorbo, and Guitar we owe;\r\n        The Lute it self, which once was Green and Mute:\r\n            When _Orpheus_ struck th’ inspired Lute,\r\n            The Trees danc’d round, and understood\r\n            By Sympathy the Voice of Wood.\r\n\r\n                          5.\r\n\r\n        These are the Spells that to kind Sleep invite,\r\n        And nothing does within resistance make,\r\n            Which yet we moderately take;\r\n            Who wou’d not choose to be awake,\r\n        While he’s incompass’d round with such delight,\r\n        To th’ Ear, the Nose, the Touch, the Taste, and Sight?\r\n        When _Venus_ wou’d her dear _Ascanius_ keep\r\n        A Pris’ner in the downy Bands of Sleep,\r\n        She od’rous Herbs and Flowers beneath him spread\r\n            As the most soft and sweetest Bed;\r\n        Not her own Lap would

Exhalations of Dirt and Smoak?\r\n            And all th’ uncleanness which does drown\r\n        In pestilential Clouds a pop’lous Town?\r\n        The Earth it self breaths better Perfumes here,\r\n        Than all the Female Men or Women there,\r\n            Not without cause about them bear.\r\n\r\n                          6.\r\n\r\n        When _Epicurus_ to the World had taught,\r\n            That Pleasure was the Chiefest Good,\r\n    (And was perhaps i’th’ right, if rightly understood)\r\n            His Life he to his Doctrine brought,\r\n    And in a Gardens Shade that Sovereign Pleasure sought.\r\n        Whoever a true Epicure would be,\r\n        May there find cheap and virtuous Luxury.\r\n        _Vitellius_ his Table, which did hold\r\n        As many Creatures as the Ark of old:\r\n        That Fiscal Table, to which every day\r\n        All Countries did a constant Tribute pay,\r\n        Could nothing more delicious afford,\r\n            Than Natures Liberality,\r\n        Helpt with a little Art and Industry,\r\n            Allows the meanest Gard’ners board.\r\n        The wanton Taste no Fish or Fowl can choose,\r\n        For which the Grape or Melon she would loose,\r\n        Though all th’ Inhabitants of Sea and Air\r\n        Be listed in the Gluttons Bill of Fare;\r\n            Yet still the Fruits of Earth we see\r\n    Plac’d the third Story high in all her Luxury.\r\n\r\n                          7.\r\n\r\n        But with no Sense the Garden does comply;\r\n        None courts or flatters, as it does the Eye:\r\n        When the great _Hebrew_ King did almost strain\r\n        The wond’rous Treasures of his Wealth and Brain,\r\n        His Royal Southern Guest to entertain;\r\n            Though she on Silver Floors did tread,\r\n        With bright _Assyrian_ Carpets on them spread,\r\n            To hide the Metals Poverty:\r\n            Though she look’d up to Roofs of Gold,\r\n            And nought around her could behold\r\n            But Silk and rich Embroidery,\r\n            And _Babylonian_ Tapistry,\r\n            And wealthy _Hiram’s_ Princely Dy:\r\n        Though _Ophirs_ Starry Stones met every where her Eye;\r\n        Though she her self and her gay Host were drest\r\n        With all the shining Glories of the East;\r\n        When lavish Art her costly work had done,\r\n        The honour and the Prize of Bravery\r\n        Was by the Garden from the Palace won;\r\n        And every Rose and Lilly there did stand\r\n            Better attir’d by Natures hand:\r\n        The case thus judg’d against the King we see,\r\n    By one that would not be so Rich, though Wiser far than he.\r\n\r\n                          8.\r\n\r\n        Nor does this happy place only dispense\r\n        Such various Pleasures to the Sense,\r\n            Here Health it self does live,\r\n    That Salt of Life which does to all a relish give,\r\n        Its standing Pleasure, and intrinsick Wealth,\r\n    The Bodies Virtue, and the Souls good Fortune, Health.\r\n        The Tree of Life, when it in _Eden_ stood,\r\n        Did its Immortal Head to Heaven rear;\r\n        It lasted a tall Cedar till the Flood;\r\n        Now a small thorny Shrub it does appear;\r\n            Nor will it thrive too every where:\r\n            It always here is freshest seen;\r\n            ’Tis only here an Ever-green.\r\n            If through the strong and beauteous Fence\r\n            Of Temperance and Innocence,\r\n        And wholesome Labours, and a quiet Mind,\r\n            Diseases Passage find,\r\n            They must not think here to assail\r\n        A Land unarmed, or without a Guard;\r\n        They must fight for it, and dispute it hard,\r\n            Before they can prevail:\r\n            Scarce any Plant is growing here\r\n        Which against Death some Weapon does not bear.\r\n            Let Cities boast, that they provide\r\n            For Life the Ornaments of Pride;\r\n            But ’tis the Country and the Field,\r\n            That furnish it with Staff and Shield.\r\n\r\n                          9.\r\n\r\n        Where does the Wisdom and the Power Divine\r\n        In a more bright and sweet Reflection shine?\r\n        Where do we finer Strokes and Colours see\r\n        Of the Creator’s real Poetry,\r\n            Than when we with attention look\r\n        Upon the third days Volume of the Book?\r\n        If we could open and intend our Eye,\r\n            We all like _Moses_ should espy\r\n        Ev’n in a Bush the radiant Deity.\r\n        But we despise these his inferior ways,\r\n        (Though no less full of Miracle and Praise)\r\n            Upon the Flowers of Heaven we gaze;\r\n        The Stars of Earth no wonder in us raise,\r\n            Though these perhaps do more than they,\r\n            The Life of Mankind sway.\r\n        Although no part of mighty Nature be\r\n        More stor’d with Beauty, Power, and Mystery;\r\n        Yet to encourage human Industry,\r\n        God has so ordered, that no other Part\r\n        Such Space, and such Dominion leaves for Art.\r\n\r\n                         10.\r\n\r\n        We no where Art do so triumphant see,\r\n            As when it Grafts or Buds the Tree;\r\n        In other things we count it to excel,\r\n        If it a Docile Scholar can appear\r\n        To Nature, and but imitate her well;\r\n        It over-rules, and is her Master here.\r\n        It imitates her Makers Power Divine,\r\n    And changes her sometimes, and sometimes does refine:\r\n        It does, like Grace, the fallen Tree restore\r\n        To its blest State of Paradise before:\r\n        Who would not joy to see his conquering hand\r\n        O’er all the vegetable World command?\r\n        And the wild Giants of the Wood receive\r\n              What Law he’s pleas’d to give?\r\n            He bids th’ ill-natur’d Crab produce\r\n

BOOK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n_Of the Earth, Soil, Seed, Air, and Water._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. It is not my intention here to speak of earth, as one of the common\r\nreputed elements; of which I have long since publish’d an ample account,\r\nin an express Treatise (annexed to this volume,) which I desire my\r\nreader to peruse; since it might well commute for the total omission of\r\nthis chapter, did not method seem to require something briefly to be\r\nsaid: Which first, as to that of earth, we shall need at present to\r\npenetrate no deeper into her bosom, than after paring of the turfe,\r\nscarrifiying the upper-mould, and digging convenient pits and trenches,\r\nnot far from the natural surface, without disturbing the several strata\r\nand remoter layers, whether of clay, chalk, gravel, sand, or other\r\nsuccessive layers, and concrets fossil, (tho’ all of them useful\r\nsometimes, and agreeable to our foresters;) tho’ few of them what one\r\nwould chuse before the under-turfe, black, brown, gray, and light, and\r\nbreaking into short clods, and without any disagreeable scent, and with\r\nsome mixture of marle or loame, but not clammy; of which I have\r\nparticularly spoken in that Treatise.\r\n\r\n2. In the mean time, this of the soil, (which I think is a more proper\r\nterm for composts) or mould rather, being of greater importance for the\r\nraising, planting, and propagation of trees in general, must at no hand\r\nbe neglected, and is therefore on all occasions mentioned in almost\r\nevery chapter of our ensuing discourse; I shall therefore not need to\r\nassign it any part, when I have affirm’d in general, that most\r\ntimber-trees grow and prosper well in any tolerable land which will\r\nproduce corn or rye, and which is not in excess stony; in which\r\nnevertheless there are some trees delight; or altogether clay, which\r\nfew, or none do naturally affect; and yet the oak is seen to prosper in\r\nit, for its toughness preferr’d before any other by many workmen, though\r\nof all soils the cow-pasture doth certainly exceed, be it for what\r\npurpose soever of planting wood. Rather therefore we should take notice\r\nhow many great wits and ingenious persons, who have leisure and faculty,\r\nare in pain for improvements of their heaths and barren Hills, cold and\r\nstarving places, which causes them to be neglected and despair’d of;\r\nwhilst they flatter their hopes and vain expectations with fructifying\r\nliquors, chymical menstruums, and such vast conceptions; in the mean\r\ntime that one may shew them as heathy and hopeless grounds, and barren\r\nhills as any in England, that do now bear, or lately have born woods,\r\ngroves, and copses, which yield the owners more wealth, than the richest\r\nand most opulent wheat-lands: and if it be objected that ’tis so long a\r\nday before these plantations can afford that gain; the Brabant\r\nNurseries, and divers home-plantations of industrious persons are\r\nsufficient to convince the gain-sayer. And when by this husbandry a few\r\nacorns shall have peopl’d the neighbouring regions with young stocks\r\nand trees; the residue will become groves and copses of infinite delight\r\nand satisfaction to the planters. Besides, we daily see what course\r\nlands will bear these stocks (suppose them oaks, wall-nuts, chess-nuts,\r\npines, firr, ash, wild-pears, crabs, &c.) and some of them (as for\r\ninstance the pear and the firr or pine) strike their roots through the\r\nroughest and most impenetrable rocks and clefts of stone it self; and\r\nothers require not any rich or pinguid, but very moderate soil;\r\nespecially, if committed to it in seeds, which allies them to their\r\nmother and nurse without renitency or regret: And then considering what\r\nassistances a little care in easing and stirring of the ground about\r\nthem for a few years does afford them: What cannot a strong plow, a\r\nwinter mellowing, and summer heats, incorporated with the pregnant turf,\r\nor a slight assistance of lime, loam, sand, rotten compost, discreetly\r\nmixed (as the case may require) perform even in the most unnatural and\r\nobstinate soil? And in such places where anciently woods have grown, but\r\nare now unkind to them, the fault is to be reformed by this care; and\r\nchiefly, by a sedulous extirpation of the old remainders of roots, and\r\nlatent stumps, which by their mustiness, and other pernicious qualities,\r\nsowre the ground, and poyson the conception; and herewith let me put in\r\nthis note, that even an over-rich, and pinguid composition, is by no\r\nmeans the proper bed either for seminary or nursery, whilst even the\r\nnatural soil it self does frequently discover and point best to the\r\nparticular species, though some are for all places alike: Nor should the\r\nearth be yet perpetually crop’d with the same, or other seeds, without\r\ndue repose, but lie some time fallow to receive the influence of\r\nheaven, according to good husbandry. But I shall say no more of these\r\nparticulars at this time, because the rest is sprinkl’d over this whole\r\nwork in their due places; wherefore we hasten to the following title;\r\nnamely, the choice and ordering of the seeds.\r\n\r\n3. Chuse your seed of that which is perfectly mature, ponderous and\r\nsound; commonly that which is easily shaken from the boughs, or gathered\r\nabout November, immediately upon its spontaneous fall, or taken from the\r\ntops and summities of the fairest and soundest trees, is best, and does\r\n(for the most part) direct to the proper season of interring, &c.\r\naccording to institution.\r\n\r\n    Nature herself who all created first,\r\n    Invented sowing, and the wild plants nurs’t:\r\n    When mast and berries from the trees did drop,\r\n    Succeeded under by a numerous crop.{4:1}\r\n\r\nYet this is to be consider’d, that if the place you sow in be too cold\r\nfor an autumnal semination, your acorns, mast, and other seeds may be\r\nprepared for the vernal by being barrel’d, or potted up in moist sand,\r\nor earth stratum s.s. during the winter; at the expiration whereof you\r\nwill find them sprouted; and being committed to the earth, with a tender\r\nhand, as apt to take as if they had been sown with the most early; nay,\r\nwith great advantage: By this means too, they have escaped the vermine,\r\n(which are prodigious devourers of winter-sowing) and will not be much\r\nconcern’d with the increasing heat of the season, as such as being\r\ncrude, and unfermented, are newly sown in the beginning of the spring;\r\nespecially, in hot and loose grounds; being already in so fair a\r\nprogress by this artificial preparation; and which, (if the provision to\r\nbe made be very great) may be thus manag’d. Chuse a fit piece of ground,\r\nand with boards (if it have not that position of it self) design it\r\nthree foot high; lay the first foot in fine earth, another of seeds,\r\nacorns, mast, keys, nuts, haws, holly-berries, &c. promiscuously, or\r\nseparate, with (now and then) a little mould sprinkled amongst them: The\r\nthird foot wholly earth: Of these preparatory magazines make as many,\r\nand as much larger ones as will serve your turn, continuing it from time\r\nto time as your store is brought in. The same for ruder handlings, may\r\nyou also do by burying your seeds in dry sand, or pulveriz’d earth,\r\nbarrelling them (as I said) in tubs, or laid in heaps in some deep\r\ncellar where the rigour of the winter may least prejudice them; and I\r\nhave fill’d old hampers, bee-hives, and boxes with them, and found the\r\nlike advantage, which is to have them ready for your seminary, as before\r\nhath been shew’d, and exceedingly prevent the season. There be also who\r\naffirm, that the careful cracking and opening of stones which include\r\nthe kernels, as soon as ripe, precipitate growth, and gain a years\r\nadvance; but this is erroneous. Now if you gather them in moist weather,\r\nlay them a drying, and so keep them till you sow, which may be as soon\r\nas you please after Christmas. If they spire out before you sow them, be\r\nsure to commit them to the earth before the sprout grows dry, or else\r\nexpect little from them: And whenever you sow, if you prevent not the\r\nlittle field mouse, he will be sure to have the better share. See cap.\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\n4. But to pursue this to some farther advantage; as to what concerns the\r\nelection of your seed, it is to be consider’d, that there is vast\r\ndifference, (what if I should affirm more than an hundred years) in\r\ntrees even of the same growth and bed, which I judge to proceed from the\r\nvariety and quality of the seed: This, for instance, is evidently seen\r\nin the heart, procerity and stature of timber; and therefore chuse not\r\nyour seeds always from the most fruitful-trees, which are commonly the\r\nmost aged, and decayed; but from such as are found most solid and fair:\r\nNor, for this reason, covet the largest acorns, &c. but (as husbandmen\r\ndo their wheat) the most weighty, clean and bright: This observation we\r\ndeduce from fruit-trees, which we seldom find to bear so kindly and\r\nplentifully from a sound stock, smooth rind, and firm wood, as from a\r\nrough, lax, and untoward tree; which is rather prone to spend itself in\r\nfruit, (the ultimate effort, and final endeavour of its most delicate\r\nsap,) than in solid and close substance to encrease the timber. And this\r\nshall suffice, though some haply might here recommend to us a more\r\naccurate microscopical examen, to interpret their most secret\r\nschematismes, which were an over-nicety for these great plantations.\r\n\r\n5. As concerning the medicating and insuccation of seeds, or enforcing\r\nthe earth by rich and generous composts, &c. for trees of these kinds, I\r\nam no great favourer of it; not only because the charge would much\r\ndiscourage the work; but for that we find it unnecessary, and for most\r\nof our forest-trees, noxious; since even where the ground is too\r\nfertile, they thrive not so well; and if a mould be not proper for one\r\nsort, it may be fit for another: Yet I would not (by this) hinder any\r\nfrom the trial, what advance such experiments will produce: In the mean\r\ntime, for the simple imbibition of some seeds and kernels, when they\r\nprove extraordinary dry, as the season may fall out, it might not be\r\namiss to macerate them in milk or water only, a little impregnated with\r\ncow-dung, &c. during the space of twenty four hours, to give them a\r\nspirit to sprout and chet the sooner; especially if you have been\r\nretarded in your sowing without our former preparation: But concerning\r\nthe mould, soiling and preparations of the ground, I refer you to my\r\nlate Treatise of Earth, if what you meet with in this do not abundantly\r\nencounter all those difficulties.\r\n\r\n6. Being thus provided with seeds of all kinds, I would advise to raise\r\nwoods by sowing them apart, in several places destin’d for their growth,\r\nwhere the mould being prepar’d (as I shall shew hereafter) and so\r\nqualified (if election be made) as best to suit with the nature of the\r\nspecies, they may be sown promiscuously, which is the most natural and\r\nrural; or in streight and even lines, for hedge-rows, avenues, and\r\nwalks, which is the more ornamental: But, because some may chuse rather\r\nto draw them out of nurseries; that the culture is not much different,\r\nnor the hinderance considerable (provided they be early and carefully\r\nremoved) I will finish what I have to say concerning these trees in the\r\nseminary, and shew how they are there to be raised, transplanted, and\r\ngovern’d till they can shift for themselves.\r\n\r\nAs to the air and water, they are certainly of almost as great\r\nimportance to the life and prosperity of trees and vegetables; and\r\ntherefore it is to be wish’d for and sought, where they are defective;\r\nand which commonly follow, or indicate the nature of the soil, or the\r\nsoil of them; (taking soil here promiscuously for the mould;) that they\r\nbe neither too keen or sharp, too cold or hot; not infected with foggs\r\nand poys’nous vapours, or expos’d to sulphurous exhalations, or\r\nfrigiverous winds, reverberating from hills, and other ill-situate\r\neminencies, pressing down the incumbent particles so tainted, or\r\nconvey’d through the inclosed valleys: But such as may gently enter and\r\npervade the cenabs and vessels destin’d and appointed for their\r\nreception, intromission, respiration, and passage, in almost continual\r\nmotion: In a word, such as is most agreeable to the life of man, the\r\ninverted head compared to the root, both vegetables and animals alike\r\naffected with those necessary principles, air and water, soon suffocated\r\nand perishable for the want of either, duly qualified with their proper\r\nmixts, be it nitre, or any other vegetable matter; though we neither\r\nsee, nor distinctly taste it: So as all aquatics, how deeply soever\r\nsubmerg’d, could not subsist without this active element the air.\r\n\r\nThe same qualification is (as we said) required in water, to which ’tis\r\nof so near alliance, and whose office it is, not only to humectate,\r\nmollify, and prepare both the seeds, and roots of vegetables, to receive\r\nthe nutrition, pabulum, and food, of which this of water as well as air,\r\nare the proper vehicles, insinuating what they carry into the numerous\r\npores, and through the tubes, canales, and other emulgent passages and\r\npercolutions to the several vessels, where (as in a stomach) it is\r\nelaborated, concocted, and digested, for distribution through every\r\npart of the plant; and therefore had need be such as should feed, not\r\nstarve, infect or corrupt; which depends upon the nature and quality of\r\nthe mix’d, with what other virtue, spirit, mineral, or other particles,\r\naccompanying the purest springs, (to appearance) passing through the\r\nclosest strainers. This therefore requires due examination, and\r\nsometimes exposure to the air and sun, and accordingly the crudity, and\r\nother defects taken off and qualified: All which, rain-water, that has\r\nhad its natural circulation, is greatly free from, so it meets with no\r\nnoxious vapours in the descent, as it must do passing through fuliginous\r\nclouds of smoak and soot, over and about great cities, and other\r\nvulcanos, continually vomiting out their acrimonious, and sometimes\r\npestiferous fervor, infecting the ambient air, as it perpetually does\r\nabout London, and for many adjacent miles, as I have elsewhere{9:1}\r\nshew’d.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, whether water alone is the cause of the solid and\r\nbulky part, and consequently of the augmentation of trees and plants,\r\nwithout any thing more to do with that element (tho’ as it serves to\r\ntransport some other matter) is very ingenuously discuss’d, and\r\ncuriously enquired into by Dr. _Woodward_, in his _History of the\r\nEarth_; fortified with divers nice experiments, too large to be here\r\ninserted: The sum is, that water, be it of rain, or the river (superior\r\nor inferior) carries with it a certain superfine terrestrial matter, not\r\ndestitute of vegetative particles; which gives body, substance, and all\r\nother requisites to the growth and perfection of the plant, with the aid\r\nof that due heat which gives life and motion to the vehicles passage\r\nthrough all the parts of the vegetable, continually ascending, ’till\r\n(having sufficiently saturated them) it transpires the rest of the\r\nliquid at the summity and tops of the branches into the atmosphere, and\r\nleaving some of the less refined matter in a viscid hony-dew, or other\r\nexsudations, (often perceived on the leaves and blossoms,) anon\r\ndescending and joining again with what they meet, repeat this course in\r\nperpetual circulation: Add to this, that from hence those regions and\r\nplaces crowded with numerous and thick standing forest-trees and woods,\r\n(which hinder the necessary evolition of this superfluous moisture, and\r\nintercourse of the air) render those countries and places, more subject\r\nto rain and mists, and consequently unwholsome; as is found in our\r\nAmerican plantations, as formerly nearer us, in Ireland; both since so\r\nmuch improved by felling and clearing these spacious shades, and letting\r\nin the air and sun, and making the earth fit for tillage, and pasture,\r\nthat those gloomy tracts are now become healthy and habitable. It is not\r\nto be imagined how many noble seats and dwellings in this nation of\r\nours, (to all appearance well situated,) are for all that unhealthful,\r\nby reason of some grove, or hedge-rows of antiquated dotard trees; nay,\r\nsometimes a single tuft only, (especially the falling autumnal leaves\r\nneglected to be taken away) filling the air with musty and noxious\r\nexhalations; which being ventilated, by glades cut through them, for\r\npassage of the stagnant vapours, have been cur’d of this evil, and\r\nrecovered their reputation.\r\n\r\nBut to return to where we left; water in this action, imbib’d with such\r\nmatter, applicable to every species of plants and vegetables, does not\r\nas we affirm’d, operate to the full extent and perfection of what it\r\ngives and contributes of necessary and constituent matter, without the\r\nsoil and temper of the climate co-operate; which otherwise, retards both\r\nthe growth and substance of what the earth produces, sensibly altering\r\ntheir qualities, if some friendly and genial heat be wanting to exert\r\nthe prolifick virtue: This we find, that the hot and warmer regions\r\nproduce the tallest and goodliest trees and plants, in stature and other\r\nproperties far exceeding those of the same species, born in the cold\r\nnorth: So as what is a gyant in the one, becomes a pumilo, and in\r\ncomparison, but a shrubby dwarf in the other; deficient of that active\r\nspirit, which elevates and spreads its prolifick matter and continual\r\nsupplies without check, and is the cause of not only the leaves\r\ndeserting the branches, whilst those trees and plants of the more benign\r\nclimate, are clad in perennial verdure: And those herbacious plants,\r\nwhich with us in the hottest seasons hardly perfect their seeds before\r\nWinter, and require to be near their genial beds and nurse, and\r\nsometimes the artificial heat of the hot-bed. Lastly, to all this I\r\nwould add that other chearful vehicle, light; which the gloomy and\r\ntorpent north is so many months depriv’d of; the too long seclusion\r\nwhereof is injurious to our exotics, kept in the conservatories, since\r\nhowever temper’d with heat, and duly refresh’d; they grow sickly, and\r\nlanguish without the admission of light as well as air, as I have\r\nfrequently found.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n{4:1}\r\n\r\n    Nam specimen sationis, & infitionis origo\r\n    Ipsa fuit rerum primum natura creatrix:\r\n    Arboribus quoniam baccæ, glandesque caducæ\r\n    Tempestiva dabant pullorum examina subter, &c.\r\n\r\n    _Lucret._ l. 5.\r\n\r\n{9:1} Fumifugium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n_Of the Seminary and of Transplanting._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Qui vineam, vel arbustum constituere volet, seminaria prius facere\r\ndebebit_, was the precept of Columella, l. 3. c. 5. speaking of\r\nvineyards and fruit-trees: and doubtless, we cannot pursue a better\r\ncourse for the propagation of timber-trees: For though it seem but a\r\ntrivial design that one should make a nursery of foresters; yet it is\r\nnot to be imagin’d, without the experience of it, what prodigious\r\nnumbers a very small spot of ground well cultivated, and destin’d for\r\nthis purpose, would be able to furnish towards the sending forth of\r\nyearly colonies into all the naked quarters of a lordship, or demesnes;\r\nbeing with a pleasant industry liberally distributed amongst the\r\ntenants, and dispos’d of about the hedg-rows, and other waste, and\r\nuncultivated places, for timber, shelter, fuel, and ornament, to an\r\nincredible advantage. This being a cheap, and laudable work, of so much\r\npleasure in the execution, and so certain a profit in the event; to be\r\nbut once well done (for, as I affirm’d, a very small _plantarium_ or\r\nnursery will in a few years people a vast extent of ground) hath made me\r\nsometimes in admiration at the universal negligence, as well as rais’d\r\nmy admiration, that seeds and plants of such different kinds, should\r\nlike so many tender babes and infants suck and thrive at the same\r\nbreast: Though there are some indeed will not so well prosper in\r\ncompany; requiring peculiar juices: But this niceness is more\r\nconspicuous in flowers and the herbacious offspring, than in foresters,\r\nwhich require only diligent weeding and frequent cleansing, till they\r\nare able to shift for themselves; and as their vessels enlarge and\r\nintrosume more copious nourishment, often starve their neighbours. Thus\r\nmuch for the nursery and _Conseminea Silva_.\r\n\r\n2. Having therefore made choice of such seeds as you would sow, by\r\ntaking, and gathering them in their just season; that is, when dropping\r\nripe; and (as has been said) from fair thriving trees; and found out\r\nsome fit place of ground, well fenced, respecting the south-east, rather\r\nthan the full south, and well protected from the north and west;\r\n\r\n    He that for wood his field would sow,\r\n    Must clear it of the shrubs that grow;\r\n    Cut brambles up, and the fern mow.{13:1}\r\n\r\nThis done, let it be broken up the winter before you sow, to mellow it;\r\nespecially if it be a clay, and then the furrow would be made deeper; or\r\nso, at least, as you would prepare it for wheat: Or you may trench it\r\nwith the spade, by which means it will the easier be cleansed of\r\nwhatsoever may obstruct the putting forth, and insinuating of the tender\r\nroots: Then, having given it a second stirring, immediately before you\r\nsow; cast, and dispose it into rills, or small narrow trenches, of four\r\nor five inches deep, and in even lines, at two foot interval, for the\r\nmore commodious runcation, hawing, and dressing the trees: Into these\r\nfurrows (about the new or increasing moon) throw your oak, beach, ash,\r\nnuts, all the glandiferous seeds, mast, and key-bearing kinds, so as\r\nthey lie not too thick, and then cover them very well with a rake, or\r\nfine-tooth’d harrow, as they do for pease: Or, to be more accurate, you\r\nmay set them as they do beans (especially, the nuts and acorns) and that\r\nevery species by themselves, for the _Roboraria_, _Glandaria_,\r\n_Ulmaria_, &c., which is the better way: This is to be done at the\r\nlatter end of October, for the autumnal sowing; and in the lighter\r\nground about February for the vernal: For other seminations in general;\r\nsome divide the spring in three parts; the beginning, middle, and end;\r\nand the like of the autumn both for sowing and planting, and accordingly\r\nprepare for the work such nursery furniture, as seems most agreeable to\r\nthe season.\r\n\r\n    Then see your hopeful grove with acorns sown,\r\n    But e’re your seed into the field be thrown,\r\n    With crooked plough first let the lusty swain\r\n    Break-up, and stubborn clods with harrow plain.\r\n    Then, when the stemm appears, to make it bare\r\n    And lighten the hard earth with hough, prepare.\r\n    Hough in the spring: nor frequent culture fail,\r\n    Lest noxious weeds o’re the young wood prevail:\r\n    To barren ground with toyl large manure add,\r\n    Good-husbandry will force a ground that’s bad.{14:1}\r\n\r\nNote that 6 bushels of acorns will sow or plant an acre, at one foot’s\r\ndistance. And if you mingle among the acorns the seeds of _Genista\r\nspinosa_, or furs, they will come up without any damage, and for a while\r\nneeds no other fence, and will be kill’d by the shade of the young\r\noaklings before they become able to do them any prejudice.\r\n\r\nOne rule I must not omit, that you cast no seeds into the earth whilst\r\nit either actually rains, or that it be over sobb’d, till moderately\r\ndry.\r\n\r\nTo this might something be expected concerning the watring of our\r\nseminaries and new plantations; which indeed require some useful\r\ndirections (especially in that you do by hand) that you pour it not with\r\ntoo great a stream on the stem of the plant, (which washes and drives\r\naway the mould from the roots and fibers) but at such distance as it may\r\npercolate into the earth, and carry its vertue to them, with a shallow\r\nexcavation, or circular basin about the stalk; and which may be defended\r\nfrom being too suddenly exhausted and drunk up by the sun, and taken\r\naway before it grow mouldy. The tender stems and branches should yet be\r\nmore gently refreshed, lest the too intense rays of the sun darting on\r\nthem, cause them to wither, as we see in our fibrous flower-roots newly\r\nset: In the mean time, for the more ample young plantations of forest\r\nand other trees, I should think the hydrantick engine (call’d the\r\nquench-fire) (described in the _Phil. Transaction_, Num. 128) might be\r\nmade very useful, rightly manag’d, and not too violently pointed against\r\nany single trees, but so exalted and directed, as the stream being\r\nspread, the water might fall on the ground like drops of rain; which I\r\nshould much prefer before the barrels and tumbral way. Rain, river or\r\npond-waters reserved in tubs or cisterns simple, or inrich’d, and abroad\r\nin the sun, should be frequently stirred, and kept from stagnation.\r\n\r\n4. Your plants beginning now to peep, should be earthed up, and\r\ncomforted a little; especially, after breaking of the greater frosts,\r\nand when the swelling mould is apt to spue them forth; but when they are\r\nabout an inch above ground, you may in a moist season, draw them up\r\nwhere they are too thick, and set them immediately in other lines, or\r\nbeds prepar’d for them; or you may plant them in double fosses, where\r\nthey may abide for good and all, and to remain till they are of a\r\ncompetent stature to be transplanted; where they should be set at such\r\ndistances as their several kinds require; but if you draw them only for\r\nthe thinning of your seminary, prick them into some empty beds (or a\r\n_Plantarium_ purposely design’d) at one foot interval, leaving the rest\r\nat two or three.\r\n\r\n5. When your seedlings have stood thus till June, bestow a slight\r\ndigging upon them, and scatter a little mungy, half-rotten litter, fern,\r\nbean-hame, or old leaves among them, to preserve the roots from\r\nscorching, and to entertain the moisture; and then in March following\r\n(by which time it will be quite consum’d, and very mellow) you shall\r\nchop it all into the earth, and mingle it together: Continue this\r\nprocess for two or three years successively; for till then, the\r\nsubstance of the kernel will hardly be spent in the plant, which is of\r\nmain import; but then (and that the stature of your young imps invite)\r\nyou may plant them forth, carefully taking up their roots, and cutting\r\nthe stem within an inch of the ground (if the kind, of which hereafter,\r\nsuffer the knife) set them where they are to continue: If thus you\r\nreduce them to the distance of forty foot, the intervals may be planted\r\nwith ash, which may be fell’d either for poles, or timber, without the\r\nleast prejudice of the oak: Some repeat the cutting we spake of the\r\nsecond year, and after March (the moon decreasing) re-cut them at half a\r\nfoot from the surface; and then meddle with them no more: But this (if\r\nthe process be not more severe than needs) must be done with a very\r\nsharp instrument, and with care, lest you violate, and unsettle the\r\nroot; which is likewise to be practis’d upon all those which you did not\r\ntransplant, unless you find them very thriving trees; and then it shall\r\nsuffice to prune off the branches, and spare the tops; for this does not\r\nonly greatly establish your plants by diverting the sap to the roots;\r\nbut likewise frees them from the injury and concussions of the winds,\r\nand makes them to produce handsome, streight shoots, infinitely\r\npreferable to such as are abandon’d to nature, and accident, without\r\nthis discipline: By this means the oak will become excellent timber,\r\nshooting into streight and single stems: The chess-nut, ash, &c.\r\nmultiply into poles, which you may reduce to standards at pleasure: To\r\nthis I add, that as oft as you make your annual transplanting, out of\r\nthe nursery, by drawing forth the choicest stocks, the remainder will be\r\nimproved by a due stirring, and turning of the mould about their roots.\r\n\r\nBut that none be discouraged, who may upon some accident, be desirous,\r\nor forc’d to transplant trees, where the partial, or unequal ground does\r\nnot afford sufficient room, or soil to make the pits equally capacious,\r\n(and so apt to nourish and entertain the roots, as where are no\r\nimpediments), the worthy Mr. Brotherton (whom we shall have occasion to\r\nmention more than once in this treatise) speaking of the increase and\r\nimprovement of roots, tells us of a large pinaster, 2 foot and ½\r\ndiameter, and about 60 foot in height, the lowest boughs being 30 foot\r\nabove the ground, which did spread and flourish on all sides alike,\r\nthough it had no root at all towards three quarters of its situation,\r\nand but one quarter only, into which it expanded its roots so far as to\r\n70 and 80 foot from the body of the tree: The reason was, its being\r\nplanted just within the square-angle of the corner of a deep, thick and\r\nstrong stone-wall, which was a kind wharfing against a river running by\r\nit, and so could have nourishment but from one quarter. And this I\r\nlikewise might confirm of two elms, planted by me about 35 years since;\r\nwhich being little bigger than walking-staves, and set on the very brink\r\nof a ditch or narrow channel (not always full of water) wharfed with a\r\nwall of a brick and half in thickness, (to keep the bank from falling\r\nin) are since grown to goodly and equally spreading trees of near two\r\nfoot diameter, solid timber, and of stature proportionable. The\r\ndifference between this, and that of the pine, being their having one\r\nquarter more of mould for the roots to spread in; but which is not at\r\nall discover’d by the exuberence of the branches in either part. But to\r\nreturn to planting, where are no such obstacles.\r\n\r\n6. _Theophrastus_ in his Third Book _de Causis_, c. 7. gives us great\r\ncaution in planting, to preserve the roots, and especially the earth\r\nadhering to the smallest fibrills, which should by no means be shaken\r\noff, as most of our gardeners do to trim and quicken them, as they\r\npretend, which is to cut them shorter; though I forbid not a very small\r\ntoping of the stragling threds, which may else hinder the spreading of\r\nthe rest, &c. Not at all considering, that those tender hairs are the\r\nvery mouths, and vehicles which suck in the nutriment, and transfuse it\r\ninto all the parts of the tree, and that these once perishing, the\r\nthicker and larger roots, hard, and less spungy, signifie little but to\r\nestablish the stem; as I have frequently experimented in orange-trees,\r\nwhose fibers are so very obnoxious to rot, if they take in the least\r\nexcess of wet: And therefore _Cato_ advises us to take care that we bind\r\nthe mould about them, or transfer the roots in baskets, to preserve it\r\nfrom forsaking them; as now our nursery-men frequently do; by which they\r\nof late are able to furnish our grounds, avenues and gardens in a moment\r\nwith trees and other plants, which would else require many years to\r\nappear in such perfection: For this earth being already applied, and\r\nfitted to the overtures and mouths of the fibers, it will require some\r\ntime to bring them in appetite again to a new mould, by which to repair\r\ntheir loss, furnish their stock, and proceed in their wonted œconomy\r\nwithout manifest danger and interruption: nor less ought our care to be\r\nin the making, and dressing of the pits and fosses, into which we design\r\nour transplantation, which should be prepar’d and left some time open to\r\nmacerating rains, frosts and sun, that may resolve the compacted salt,\r\n(as some will have it) render the earth friable, mix and qualifie it for\r\naliment, and to be more easily drawn in, and digested by the roots and\r\nanalogous stomach of the trees: This, to some degree may be artificially\r\ndone, by burning of straw in the newly opened pits, and drenching the\r\nmould with water; especially in over-dry seasons, and by meliorating\r\nbarren-ground with sweet and comminuted lœtations: Let therefore this be\r\nreceived as a maxim, never to plant a fruit or forest-tree where there\r\nhas lately been an old decay’d one taken up; till the pit be well\r\nventilated, and furnish’d with fresh mould.\r\n\r\n7. The author of the Natural History, _Pliny_, tells us it was a vulgar\r\ntradition, in his time, that no tree should be removed under two years\r\nold, or above three: _Cato_ would have none transplanted less than five\r\nfingers in diameter; but I have shew’d why we are not to attend so long\r\nfor such as we raise of seedlings. In the interim, if these directions\r\nappear too busie, or operose, or that the plantation you intend be very\r\nample, a more compendious method will be the confused sowing of acorns,\r\n&c. in furrows, two foot asunder, covered at three fingers depth, and so\r\nfor three years cleansed, and the first winter cover’d with fern,\r\nwithout any farther culture, unless you transplant them; but, as I\r\nshewed before, in nurseries, they would be cut an inch from the ground,\r\nand then let stand till March the second year, when it shall be\r\nsufficient to disbranch them to one only shoot, whether you suffer them\r\nto stand, or remove them elsewhere. But to make an essay what seed is\r\nmost agreeable to the soil, you may by the thriving of a promiscuous\r\nsemination make a judgment of,\r\n\r\n    What each soil bears, and what it does refuse.{20:1}\r\n\r\ntransplanting those which you find least agreeing with the place; or\r\nelse, by copsing the starvelings in the places where they are newly\r\nsown, cause them sometimes to overtake even their untouch’d\r\ncontemporaries.\r\n\r\nSomething may here be expected about the fittest season for this work of\r\ntransplanting; of which having spoken in another{21:1} treatise, annext\r\nto this, (as well as in divers other places throughout this of\r\nForest-trees) I shall need add little; after I have recommended the\r\nearliest removals, not only of all the sturdy sort in our woods, but\r\neven of some less tender trees in our orchards; pears, apples, vulgar\r\ncherries, &c. whilst we favour the delicate and tender murals, and such\r\nas are pithy; as the wall-nut, and some others. But after all, what says\r\nthe plain wood-man, speaking of oaks, beech, elms, haw-thorns, and even\r\nwhat we call wild and hedge-fruit? Set them, says he, at All-hallowtide,\r\nand command them to prosper; set them at Candlemass, and intreat them to\r\ngrow. Nor needs it explanation.\r\n\r\n8. But here some may enquire what distances I would generally assign to\r\ntransplanted trees? To this somewhat is said in the ensuing periods, and\r\nas occasion offers; though the promiscuous rising of them in\r\nforest-work, wild and natural, is to us, I acknowledge, more pleasing\r\nthan all the studied accuracy in ranging of them; unless it be where\r\nthey conduct and lead us to avenues, and are planted for _vistas_ (as\r\nthe _Italians_ term is) in which case, the proportion of the breadth and\r\nlength of the walks, &c. should govern, as well as the nature of the\r\ntree; with this only note; that such trees as are rather apt to spread,\r\nthan mount (as the oak, beech, wall-nut, &c.) be dispos’d at wider\r\nintervals, than the other, and such as grow best in consort, as the\r\nelm, ash, limetree, sycamore, firr, pine, &c. Regard is likewise to be\r\nhad to the quality of the soil, for this work: v. g. If trees that\r\naffect cold and moist grounds, be planted in hot and dry places, then\r\nset them at closer order; but trees which love dry and thirsty grounds,\r\nat farther distance: The like rule may also guide in situations expos’d\r\nto impetuous winds and other accidents, which may serve for general\r\nrules in this piece of tactics. In the mean time, if you plant for\r\nregular walks, or any single trees, a competent elevation of the earth\r\nin circle, and made a little hollow like a shallow bason (as I already\r\nmention’d) for the reception of water, and refreshing the roots;\r\nsticking thorns about the edges to protect them from cattel, were not\r\namiss. Fruit-trees thus planted, if beans be set about them, produces a\r\nlittle crop, and will shade the surface, perhaps, without any detriment:\r\nBut this more properly belongs to Pomona. Most shrubs of ever-green and\r\nsome trees may be planted very near one another; myrtles, laurel, bays,\r\nCyprus, yew, ivy, pomegranates, and others, also need little distance,\r\nand indeed whatever is proper to make hedges: But for the oak, elm,\r\nwall-nut, firs, and the taller timber-trees, let the dismal effects of\r\nthe late hurricane (never to be forgotten) caution you never to plant\r\nthem too near the mansion, (or indeed any other house) that so if such\r\naccident happen, their fall and ruin may not reach them.\r\n\r\n9. To leave nothing omitted which may contribute to the stability of our\r\ntransplanted trees, something is to be premis’d concerning their\r\nstaking, and securing from external injuries, especially from winds and\r\ncattel; against both which, such as are planted in copses, and for\r\nample woods, are sufficiently defended by the mounds and their closer\r\norder; especially, if they rise of seeds: But where they are expos’d in\r\nsingle rows, as in walks and avenues, the most effectual course is to\r\nempale them with three good quartet-stakes of competent length, set in\r\ntriangle, and made fast to one another by short pieces above and\r\nbeneath; in which a few brambles being stuck, secure it abundantly\r\nwithout that choaking or fretting, to which trees are obnoxious that are\r\nonly single staked and bushed, as the vulgar manner is: Nor is the\r\ncharge of this so considerable as the great advantage, accounting for\r\nthe frequent reparations which the other will require. Where cattel do\r\nnot come, I find a good piece of rope, tyed fast about the neck of trees\r\nupon a wisp of straw to preserve it from galling, and the other end\r\ntightly strein’d to a hook or peg in the ground (as the shrouds in ships\r\nare fastened to the masts) sufficiently stablishes my trees against the\r\nwestern blasts without more trouble; for the winds of other quarters\r\nseldom infest us. But these cords had need be well pitch’d to preserve\r\nthem from wet, and so they will last many years. I cannot in the mean\r\ntime conceal what a noble person has assur’d me, that in his goodly\r\nplantations of trees in Scotland, where they are continually expos’d to\r\nmuch greater, and more impetuous winds than we were usually acquainted\r\nwith, he never stakes any of his trees; but upon all disasters of this\r\nkind, causes only his servants to redress, and, set them up again as\r\noften as they happen to be overthrown; which he has affirm’d to me,\r\nthrives better with them, than with those which he has staked; and that\r\nat last they strike root so fast, as nothing but the axe is able to\r\nprostrate them. And there is good reason for it in my opinion, whilst\r\nthese concussions of the roots loosning the mould, not only make room\r\nfor their more easie insinuations, but likewise open and prepare it to\r\nreceive and impart the better nourishment. It is in another place I\r\nsuggest that transplanted pines and firrs, for want of their penetrating\r\ntaproots, are hardly consistent against these gusts after they are grown\r\nhigh; especially, where they are set close, and in tufts, which betrays\r\nthem to the greater disadvantage: And therefore such trees do best in\r\nwalks, and at competent distances where they escape tolerably well: Such\r\ntherefore as we design for woods of them, should be sow’d, and never\r\nremov’d. In the mean time, many trees are also propagated by cuttings\r\nand layers; the ever-greens about Bartholomewtide; other trees within\r\ntwo or three months after, when they will have all the sap to assist\r\nthem; every body knows the way to do it is by slitting the branch a\r\nlittle way, when it is a little cut directly in, and then to plunge it\r\nhalf a foot under good mould, and leaving as much of its extremity above\r\nit, and if it comply not well, to peg it down with an hook or two, and\r\nso when you find it competently rooted, to cut it off beneath, and plant\r\nit forth: Other expedients there are by twisting the part, or baring it\r\nof the rind; and if it be out of reach of the ground, to fasten a tub or\r\nbasket of earth near the branch, fill’d with a succulent mould, and kept\r\nas fresh as may be. For cuttings, about the same season, take such as\r\nare about the bigness of your thumb, setting them a foot in the earth,\r\nand near as much out. If it be of soft wood, as willows, poplar, alders,\r\n&c. you may take much larger trunchions, and so tall as cattel may not\r\nreach them; if harder, those which are young, small and more tender; and\r\nif such as produce a knur, or burry swelling, set that part into the\r\nground, and be sure to make the hole so wide, and point the end of your\r\ncutting so smooth, as that in setting, it violate and strip none of the\r\nbark; the other extream may be slanted, and so treading the earth close,\r\nand keeping it moist, you will seldom fail of success: By the roots also\r\nof a thriving, lusty and sappy tree, more may be propagated; to effect\r\nwhich, early in spring, dig about its foot, and finding such as you may\r\nwith a little cutting bend upwards, raise them above ground three or\r\nfour inches, and they will in a short time make shoots, and be fit for\r\ntransplantation; or in this work you may quite separate them from the\r\nmother-roots, and cut them off: By baring likewise the bigger roots\r\ndiscreetly, and hacking them a little, and then covering with fresh\r\nMould _matres_, and mother-roots; _nepotes_, succors; _traduces_, and\r\nrooted setts, may be raised in abundance; which drawing competent roots\r\nwill soon furnish store of plants; and this is practicable in elms\r\nespecially, and all such trees as are apt of themselves to put forth\r\nsuckers; but of this more upon occasion{25:1} hereafter. And now to\r\nprevent censure on this tedious and prolix Introduction, I cannot but\r\nlook on it as the basis and foundation of all the structure, rising from\r\nthis work and endeavour of mine; since from station, sowing, continual\r\nculture and care, proceed all we really enjoy in the world: Every thing\r\nmust have birth and beginning, and afterwards by diligence and prudent\r\ncare, form’d and brought to shape and perfection: Nor is it enough to\r\ncast seeds into the ground, and leave them there, as the Ostrich does\r\nher eggs in the Lybian sands, without minding them more, (because Nature\r\nhas depriv’d her of understanding); but great diligence is to be us’d in\r\ngoverning them; not only till they spring up, but till they are arriv’d\r\nto some stature fit for transplantation, and to be sent broad; after the\r\nsame method that our children should be educated, and taken care of from\r\ntheir birth and cradle; and afterwards, whilst they are under Padagogues\r\nand discipline, (for the forming of their manners and persons) that they\r\ncontract no ill habits, and take such plys as are so difficult to\r\nrectifie and smooth again without the greatest industry. For prevention\r\nof this in our seminary, the like care is requisite; whilst the young\r\nimps and seedlings are yet tender and flexible, and require not only\r\ndifferent nourishment and protection from too much cold, heat, and other\r\ninjuries; but due and skilful management, in dressing, redressing and\r\npruning, as they grow capable of being brought into shape, and of\r\nhopeful expectation, when time has rendered them fit for the use and\r\nservice requir’d, according to their kinds. He therefore that undertakes\r\nthe nursery, should be knowing not only in the choice of the seeds,\r\nwhere, when, and how to sow them; but to know what time of gestation\r\nthey require in the womb of their mother-earth, before parturition; that\r\nso he may not be surprized with her delivering some of them sooner, or\r\nlater than he expects them; for some will lye two, nay, three year, e’er\r\nthey peep; most others one, and some a quarter, or a month or two;\r\nwhilst the tardy and less forward so tire the hopes of the husbandman,\r\nthat he many times digs up the platts and beds in which they were sown,\r\ndespairing of a crop, sometimes ready to spring and come up, as I have\r\nfound by experience to my loss: Those of hard shell and integument will\r\nlie longer buried than others; for so the _libanus_ cedar, and most of\r\nthe coniferous firs, pines, &c. shed their seeds late, and sometimes\r\nremain two winters and as many summers, to open their scales glued so\r\nfast together, without some external application of fire or warm water,\r\nwhich is yet not so natural as when they open of themselves. The same\r\nmay be observed of some minuter seeds, even among the olitories; as that\r\nof parsley, which will hardly spring in less than a year; so beet-seed,\r\npart in the second and third, &c. which upon inspecting the skins and\r\nmembranes involving them, would be hard to give a reason for. To\r\naccelerate this, they use imbibitions of piercing spirits, salts,\r\nemollients, &c. not only to the seeds, but to the soil, which we seldom\r\nfind much signify, but either to produce abortion or monsters; and being\r\nforc’d to hasty birth, become nothing so hardy, healthful and lasting,\r\nas the conception and birth they receive from nature. These observations\r\npremis’d in general, after I have recommended to our industrious\r\nplanters the appendix or table of the several sorts of soil and places\r\nthat are proper, or at least may seem so; or that are unfit for certain\r\nkinds of trees, (as well foresters and others, annexed to this work) I\r\nshould proceed to particulars, and boldly advance into the thickest of\r\nthe forest, did not method seem to require something briefly to be\r\nspoken of trees in general, as they are under the name of plants and\r\nvegetables, especially such as we shall have occasion to discourse of\r\nin the following work; tho’ we also take in some less vulgarly known and\r\nfamiliar, of late indenizon’d among us, and some of them very useful.\r\n\r\nBy trees then is meant, a lignous woody-plant, whose property is for the\r\nmost part, to grow up and erect itself with a single stem or trunk, of a\r\nthick and more compacted substance and bulk, branching forth large and\r\nspreading boughs; the whole body and external part, cover’d and invested\r\nwith a thick rind or _cortex_, more hard and durable than that of other\r\nparts; which, with expanding roots, penetrate and fixes them in the\r\nearth for stability, (and according to their nature) receive and convey\r\nnourishment to the whole: And these _terræ-filii_, are what we call\r\ntimber-trees, the chief subject of our following Discourse.\r\n\r\nTrees are likewise distinguish’d into other subordinate species;\r\n_fruticis_, frutages and shrubs; which are also lignous trees, tho’ of a\r\nlower and humbler growth, less spreading, and rising up in several\r\nstems, emerging from the same root, yielding plenty of suckers; which\r\nbeing separated from it, and often carrying with them some small fiber,\r\nare easily propagated and planted out for a numerous store: And this,\r\n(being clad with a more tender bark or fiber) seems to differ _frutex_\r\nfrom other arborious kinds; since as to the shaft and stems of such as\r\nwe account dwarf and pumilo with us, they rise often to tall and stately\r\ntrees, in the more genial and benign climes.\r\n\r\n_Suffrutrices_ are shrubs lower than the former, lignescent and more\r\napproaching to the stalky herbs, lavender, rue, &c. but not apt to decay\r\nso soon, after they have seeded; whilst both these kinds seem also\r\nlittle more to differ from one another, than do trees from them; all of\r\nthem consisting of the same variety of parts, according to their kinds\r\nand structure, cover’d with some woody, hard membraneous, or tender\r\nrind, suitable to their constitution, and to protect them from outward\r\ninjuries; producing likewise buds, leaves, blossoms and flowers,\r\npregnant with fruit, and yielding saps, liquors and juices, _lachrymæ_,\r\ngums, and other exsudations, tho’ diversifying in shape and substance,\r\ntast, odour, and other qualities and operations, according to the nature\r\nof the species; the various structure and contexture of their several\r\nvessels and organs, whose office it is to supply the whole plant with\r\nall that is necessary to its being and perfection, after a stupendious,\r\ntho’ natural process; which minutely to describe, and analogically\r\ncompare, as they perform their functions, (not altogether so different\r\nfrom creatures of animal life) would require an anatomical lecture;\r\nwhich is so learnedly and accurately done to our hands, by Dr. Grew,\r\n_Malphigius_ and other ingenious naturalists.\r\n\r\nBut besides this general definition, as to what is meant by trees,\r\nfrutexes, &c. they are likewise specifically distinguish’d by other\r\ncharacters, leaves, buds, blossoms, &c. but especially by what they\r\nproduce of more importance, by their fruit ye shall know them: v. g.\r\n\r\nThe _glandiferæ_, oaks and ilex’s yield acorns, and other useful\r\nexcrescencies: The mast-bearers are the beech, and such as include their\r\nseeds and fruit in rougher husks; as the chessnut-tree, &c. the wallnut,\r\nhazle, avelans, &c. are the _nuciferæ_, &c. to the _coniferæ_,\r\n_resiniferæ_, _squammiferæ_, &c. belong the whole tribe of cedars,\r\nfirs, pines, &c. apples, pears, quinces, and several other _edulæ_\r\nfruits; peaches, abricots, plums, &c. are reduc’d to the _pomiferæ_: The\r\n_bacciferæ_, are such as produce kernels, sorbs, cherries, holley, bays,\r\nlaurell, yew, juniper, elder, &c. and all the berry-bearers. The\r\n_genistæ_ in general, and such as bear their seeds in cods, come under\r\nthe tribe of _siliquosæ_: The _lanuginæ_ are such as bed their seeds in\r\na cottony-down.\r\n\r\nThe ash, elm, tilia, poplar, hornbeam, willow, salices, &c. are\r\ndistinguish’d by their keys, tongues, _samera_, _pericurpia_, and\r\n_theca_, small, flat and husky skins, including the seeds, as in so many\r\nfoliol’s, bags and purses, fine membranous cases, catkins, palmes,\r\njulus’s, &c. needless to be farther mention’d here, being so\r\nparticularly describ’d in the chapters following; as are also the\r\nvarious ever-greens and exoticks.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n{13:1}\r\n\r\n    Qui serere ingenuum volet agrum,\r\n    Liberat prius arva fruticibus;\r\n    Falce rubos, filicemque resecat.\r\n\r\n    _Boeth. l. 2.

See Cap. III. Sect. 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n_Of the Oak._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Robur_, the oak; I have sometimes consider’d it very seriously, what\r\nshould move _Pliny_ to make a whole chapter of one only line, which is\r\nless than the argument alone of most of the rest in his huge volume: but\r\nthe weightiness of the matter does worthily excuse him, who is not wont\r\nto spare his words, or his reader. _Glandiferi maximè generis omnes,\r\nquibus honos apud Romanos perpetuus._ “Mast-bearing-trees were\r\nprincipally those which the Romans held in chiefest repute,” lib. 16.\r\ncap. 3. And in the following where he treats of chaplets, and the\r\ndignity of the civic coronet; it might be compos’d of the leaves or\r\nbranches of any oak, provided it were a bearing tree, and had acorns\r\nupon it, and was (as{31:1} _Macrobius_ tells us). Recorded among the\r\n_felices arbores_; but this φυλλινὸν ϛέφανον was interwoven, and\r\ntwisted with thorns and briars; and the garland carried to usher the\r\nbride to her husband’s house, intimating that happy state was not exempt\r\nfrom its pungencies and cares. It is then for the esteem which these\r\nwise and glorious people had of this tree above all others, that I will\r\nfirst begin with the oak; and indeed it carries it from all other timber\r\nwhatsoever, for building of ships in general, and in particular being\r\ntough, bending well, strong and not too heavy, nor easily admitting\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n2. ’Tis pity that the several kinds of oak are so rarely known amongst\r\nus, that whereever they meet with _quercus_, they take it promiscuously\r\nfor our common oak; as likewise they do Δρὺς, which comprehends all\r\nmast-bearing trees whatsoever, (which I think they have no latin word\r\nfor): And in the _Silva Glandifera_ were reckon’d the chessnut, ilix,\r\n_esculus_, _cerris_, _suber_, &c. various species rather than different\r\ntrees, white, red, black, &c. among our American plantations,\r\n(especially the long-stalked oak not as yet much taken notice of): we\r\nshall here therefore give an account of four only; two of which are most\r\nfrequent with us; for we shall say little of the _cerris_ or _ægilops_,\r\ngoodly to look on, but for little else: Some have mistaken it for beech,\r\nwhereas indeed it is a kind of oak bearing a small round acorn almost\r\ncovered with the cup, which is very rugged, the branches loaded with a\r\nlong moss hanging down like dishevell’d hair which much annoys it.\r\nΦάγος is indeed doubtless a species of oak; however by the Latins\r\nusually apply’d to the beech, whose leaf exceedingly differs from that\r\nof the oak, as also the mast and bark rugged, and growing among the\r\nhills and mountains; the other in the valleys, and perhaps, but few of\r\nthem in Italy. Physicians, naturalists and botanists should therefore be\r\ncurious how they describe and place such trees mention’d by\r\n_Theophrastus_ and others, under the same denomination as frequently\r\nthey do; being found so very different when accurately examin’d. There\r\nis likewise the _esculus_, which though _Vitruvius_, _Pliny_,\r\n_Dalcampius_ and others take for a smaller kind, _Virgil_ celebrates for\r\nits spreading, and profound root; and this _Dalcampius_ will therefore\r\nhave to be the _platyphyllos_ of _Theophrastus_, and as our botanists\r\nthink, his _phegos_, as producing the most edible fruit. But to confine\r\nour selves; the _quercus urbana_, which grows more upright, and being\r\nclean and lighter is fittest for timber: And the _robur_, or _quercus\r\nsilvestris_, (taking _robur_ for the general name, if at least\r\ncontradistinct from the rest); which (as the name imports) is of a vast\r\nrobust and inflexible nature, of an hard black grain; bearing a smaller\r\nacorn, and affecting to spread in branches, and to put forth his roots\r\nmore above ground; and therefore in the planting, to be allow’d a\r\ngreater distance, viz. from twenty five, to forty foot; (nay sometimes\r\nas many yards;) whereas the other shooting up more erect, will be\r\ncontented with fifteen. This kind is farther to be distinguished by its\r\nfulness of leaves, which tarnish, and becoming yellow at the fall, do\r\ncommonly clothe it all the winter; the roots growing very deep and\r\nstragling. The author of _Britannia Baconica_, speaks of an oak in\r\nLanhadron-Park in Cornwall, which bears constantly leaves speckled with\r\nwhite; and of another call’d the painted oak; others have since been\r\nfound at Fridwood, near Sittingbourn in Kent; as also sycamore and elms,\r\nin other places mentioned by the learned Dr. Plot in his _Nat. Hist._ of\r\n_Oxfordshire_: Which I only mention here, that the variety may be\r\ncompar’d by some ingenious person thereabouts, as well as the truth of\r\nthe fatal præ-admonition, of oaks bearing strange leaves: Besides that\r\nfamous oak of _New Forest_ in _Hampshire_, which puts forth its buds\r\nabout Christmass, but wither’d again before night; and was order’d (by\r\nour late King Charles II.) to be inclos’d with a Pale; (as I find it\r\nmentioned in the last edition of Mr. Camden’s _Brit._) And so was\r\nanother before this; which his grandfather, King James, went to visit,\r\nand caused benches to be plac’d about it; which giving it reputation,\r\nthe people never left hacking of the boughs and bark till they kill’d\r\nthe tree: As I am told they have serv’d that famous oak near\r\n_White-Ladys_ which hid and protected our late Monarch from being\r\ndiscovered and taken by the Rebel-Soldiers, who were sent to find him,\r\nafter his almost miraculous escape at the battel of _Worcester_. In the\r\nmean time, as to this extraordinary precosness, the like is reported of\r\na certain wallnut-tree as well as of the famous white-thorns of\r\n_Glassenbury_, and blackthorns in several places. Some of our common\r\noaks bear their leaves green all winter; but they are generally\r\npollards, and such as are shelter’d in warm corners and hedge rows. To\r\nspeak then particularly of oaks, and generally of all other trees of\r\nthe same kind, (by some infallible characters) notice should be taken of\r\nthe manner of their spreading, stature and growth, shape and size of the\r\nacorn, whether single or in clusters, the length or shortness of the\r\nstalks, roundness of the cup, breadth, narrowness, shape, and indentures\r\nof the leaf; and so of the bark, Τραχυς, asperous, or smooth, brown\r\nor bright, &c. Tho’ most (if not all of them) may rather be imputed to\r\nthe genius and nature of the soil, situation, or goodness of the seed,\r\nthan either to the pretended sex or species. And these observations may\r\nserve to discover many accidental varieties in other trees, without\r\nnicer distinctions; such as are fetch’d from profess’d botanists; who\r\nmake it not so much their study, to plant and propagate trees, as to\r\nskill in their medicinal virtues, and other uses; always excepting our\r\nlearned countryman, Mr. Ray, whose incomparable work omits nothing\r\nuseful or desirable on this subject; wanting only the accomplishments of\r\nwell-design’d sculps. There is likewise a kind of _hemeris_ or dwarf-oak\r\n(like the _robur_ VII. _clusii_) frequent in New-England; and the white\r\none of _Virginia_, a most stately tree, which (bearing acorns) might\r\neasily be propagated here, if it were worth the while.\r\n\r\n3. I shall not need to repeat what has already been said Cap. 2.\r\nconcerning the raising of this tree from the acorn; they will also\r\nendure the laying, but never to advantage of bulk or stature: It is in\r\nthe mean time the propagation of these large spreading oaks, which is\r\nespecially recommended for the excellency of the timber, and that his\r\nMajesties forests were well and plentifully stor’d with them; because\r\nthey require room, and space to amplifie and expand themselves, and\r\nwould therefore be planted at more remote distances, and free from all\r\nencumbrances: And this upon consideration how slowly a full-grown oak\r\nmounts upwards, and how speedily they spread, and dilate themselves to\r\nall quarters, by dressing and due culture; so as above forty years\r\nadvance is to be gain’d by this only industry: And, if thus his\r\nMajesties forests and chases were stor’d, _viz._ with this spreading\r\ntree at handsom intervals, by which grazing might be improv’d for the\r\nfeeding of deer and cattel under them, (for such was the old _Saltus_)\r\nbenignly visited with the gleams of the sun, and adorn’d with the\r\ndistant land-skips appearing through the glades, and frequent vallies;\r\n\r\n    (..............................betwixt\r\n    Whose rows the azure sky is seen immix’d,\r\n    With hillocks, vales, and fields, as now we see\r\n    Distinguish’d in a sweet variety;\r\n    Such places which wild apple-trees throughout\r\n    Adorn, and happy shrubs grow all about,){35:1}\r\n\r\nAs the poet describes his olive-groves, nothing could be more ravishing;\r\nfor so we might also sprinkle fruit-trees amongst them (of which\r\nhereafter) for cyder, and many singular uses, and should find such\r\ngoodly plantations the boast of our rangers, and forests infinitely\r\npreferable to any thing we have yet beheld, rude, and neglected as they\r\nare: I say, when his Majesty shall proceed (as he hath design’d) to\r\nanimate this laudable pride into fashion, forests and woods (as well as\r\nfields and inclosures) will present us with another face than now they\r\ndo. And here I cannot but applaud the worthy industry of old Sir\r\nHarbotle Grimstone, who (I am told) from a very small nursery of acorns,\r\nwhich he sow’d in the neglected corners of his ground, did draw forth\r\nsuch numbers of oaks of competent growth; as being planted about his\r\nfields in even, and uniform rows, about one hundred foot from the\r\nhedges; bush’d, and well water’d till they had sufficiently fix’d\r\nthemselves, did wonderfully improve both the beauty, and the value of\r\nhis demeasnes. But I proceed.\r\n\r\n4. Both these kinds would be taken up very young, and transplanted about\r\nOctober; some yet for these hardy, and late springing trees, defer it\r\ntill the winter be well over; but the earth had need be moist; and\r\nthough they will grow tolerably in most grounds, yet do they generally\r\naffect the sound, black, deep, and fast mould, rather warm than over-wet\r\nand cold, and a little rising; for this produces the firmest timber;\r\nthough my L. Bacon prefers that which grows in the moister grounds for\r\nship-timber, as the most tough, and less subject to rift. But let us\r\nhear Pliny:\r\n\r\n     This is a general rule, saith he; “What trees soever they be which\r\n     grow tolerably, either on hills, or valleys, arise to greater\r\n     stature, and spread more amply in the lower ground: But the timber\r\n     is far better, and of a finer grain, which grows upon the\r\n     mountains, excepting only apple and pear-trees.” And in the 39 cap.\r\n     lib. 16. “The timber of those trees which grow in moist and shady\r\n     places is not so good as that which comes from a more expos’d\r\n     situation, nor is it so close, substantial and durable”:\r\n\r\nUpon which he much prefers the timber growing in _Tuscany_, before that\r\ntowards the _Venetian_ side, and upper part of the _Gulph_: And that\r\ntimber so grown, was in greatest esteem long before Pliny, we have the\r\nSpear of _Agamemnon_........... ἔχων ἀνεμοτρεφὲς ἔγχος. Ιλ. λ.{37:1}\r\nfrom a tree so expos’d; and _Didymus_ gives the reason, Τὰ γὰρ ἐν ἀνέμῳ\r\n(says he) πλεῖον γυμναζόμενα δένδρα οτερέα &c. _For that\r\nbeing continually weather-beaten, they become hardier and tougher_:\r\nOtherwise, that which is wind-shaken, never comes to good; and\r\ntherefore, when we speak of the climate, ’tis to be understood of\r\nvalleys rather than hills, and in calm places, than exposed, because\r\nthey shoot streight and upright. The result of all is, that upon\r\noccasion of special timber, there is a very great and considerable\r\ndifference; so as some oaken-timber proves manifestly weaker, more\r\nspungy, and sooner decaying than other. The like may be affirm’d of ash,\r\nand other kinds; and generally speaking, the close-grain’d is the\r\nstoutest, and most permanent: But of this, let the industrious consult\r\nthat whole tenth chapter in the second book of Vitruvius, where he\r\nexpresly treats of this argument, _De Abiete supernate & infernate, cum\r\nApennini descriptione_: Where we note concerning oak, that it neither\r\nprospers in very hot, nor excessive cold countries; and therefore there\r\nis little good of it to be found in _Africa_; or indeed, the lower and\r\nmost southern parts of _Italy_ (but the _Venetians_ have excellent\r\ntimber) nor in _Denmark_, or _Norway_ comparable to ours; it chiefly\r\naffecting a temperate climate, and where they grow naturally in\r\nabundance, ’tis a promising mark of it. If I were to make choice of the\r\nplace, or the tree, it should be such as grows in the best cow-pasture,\r\nor up-land meadow, where the mould is rich, and sweet, (Suffolk affords\r\nan admirable instance) and in such places you may also transplant large\r\ntrees with extraordinary success: And therefore it were not amiss to\r\nbore and search the ground where you intend to plant or sow, before you\r\nfall to work; since earth too shallow, or rocky is not so proper for\r\nthis timber; the roots fix not kindly, and though for a time they may\r\nseem to flourish, yet they will dwindle: In the mean time, ’tis\r\nwonderful to consider how strangely the oak will penetrate to come to a\r\nmarly bottom; so as where we find this tree to prosper, the indication\r\nof a fruitful and excellent soil is certain even by the token of this\r\nnatural augury only; so as by the plantation of this tree and some\r\nothers, we have the advantage of profit rais’d from the pregnancy,\r\nsubstance and depth of our land; whilst by the grass and corn, (whose\r\nroots are but a few inches deep), we have the benefit of the crust only.\r\n\r\n5. But to discourage none, oaks prosper exceedingly even in gravel and\r\nmoist clays, which most other trees abhor; yea, even the coldest\r\nclay-grounds that will hardly graze: But these trees will frequently\r\nmake stands, as they encounter variety of footing, and sometimes proceed\r\nagain vigorously, as they either penetrate beyond, or out-grow their\r\nobstructions, and meet better earth; which is of that consequence, that\r\nI dare boldly affirm, more than an hundred years advance is clearly\r\ngain’d by soil and husbandry. I have yet read, that there grow oaks,\r\n(some of which have contain’d ten loads apiece) out of the very walls\r\nof _Silcester_ in Hantshire, which seem to strike root in the very\r\nstones; and even in our renowned Forest of Dean itself, some goodly oaks\r\nhave been noted to grow upon ground, which has been as it were a rock of\r\nancient cinders, buried there many ages since. It is indeed obser’d,\r\nthat oaks which grow in rough stony grounds, and obstinate clays, are\r\nlong before they come to any considerable stature, (for such places, and\r\nall sort of clay, is held but a step-mother to trees) but in time they\r\nafford the most excellent timber, having stood long, and got good\r\nfooting. The same may we affirm of the lightest sands, which produces a\r\nsmoother-grain’d timber, of all other the most useful for the joyner;\r\nbut that which grows in gravel is subject to be frow (as they term it)\r\nand brittle. What improvement the stirring of the ground about the roots\r\nof oaks is to the trees, I have already hinted; and yet in copses where\r\nthey stand warm, and so thicken’d with the underwood, as this culture\r\ncannot be practis’d, they prove in time to be goodly trees. I have of\r\nlate tried the graffing of oaks, but as yet with slender success:\r\nRuellius indeed affirms it will take the pear and other fruit; and if we\r\nmay credit the poet,\r\n\r\n    The sturdy oak does golden apples bear.{39:1}\r\n\r\n    And under elms swine do the mast devour.{39:2}\r\n\r\nWhich I conceive to be the more probable, for that the sap of the oak\r\nis of an unkind tincture to most trees. But for this improvement, I\r\nwould rather advise inoculation, as the ordinary elm upon the\r\nwitch-hazel, for those large leaves we shall anon mention, and which are\r\nso familiar in France.\r\n\r\n6. That the transplanting of young oaks gains them ten years advance,\r\nsome happy persons have affirmed: From this belief, if in a former\r\nimpression I have desired to be excused, and produc’d my reasons for it,\r\nI shall not persist against any sober man’s experience; and therefore\r\nleave this article to their choice; since (as the butchers phrase is)\r\nchange of pasture makes fat calves; and so transplantations of these\r\nhard-wood-trees, when young, may possibly, by an happy hand, in fit\r\nseason, and other circumstances of soil, sun, and room for growth, be an\r\nimprovement: But as for those who advise us to plant oaks of too great a\r\nstature, they hardly make any considerable progress in an age; and\r\ntherefore I cannot encourage it, unless the ground be extraordinarily\r\nqualify’d, or that the oak you would transplant, be not above 6 or 7\r\nfoot growth in height: Yet if any be desirous to make tryal of it, let\r\ntheir stems be of the smoothest and tenderest bark; for that is ever an\r\nindication of youth, as well as the paucity of their circles, which in\r\ndisbranching and cutting the head off, at five or six foot height (a\r\nthing, by the way, which the French usually spare when they transplant\r\nthis tree) may (before you stir their roots) serve for the more certain\r\nguide; and then plant them immediately, with as much earth as will\r\nadhere to them, in the place destin’d for their station; abating only\r\nthe{41:1} tap-root, which is that down-right, and stubby part of the\r\nroots (which all trees rais’d of seeds do universally produce) and\r\nquickning some of the rest with a sharp knife (but sparing the fibrous,\r\nwhich are the main suckers and mouths of all trees) spread them in the\r\nfoss or pit which hath been prepar’d to receive them. I say, in the\r\nfoss, unless you will rather trench the whole field, which is\r\nincomparably the best; and infinitely to be preferr’d before narrow pits\r\nand holes (as the manner is) in case you plant any number considerable,\r\nthe earth being hereby made loose, easier and penetrable for the roots,\r\nabout which you are to cast that mould, which (in opening of the trench)\r\nyou took from the surface, and purposely laid apart; because it is\r\nsweet, mellow, and better impregnated: But in this work, be circumspect\r\nnever to inter your stem deeper than you found it standing; for profound\r\nburying very frequently destroys a tree, though an error seldom\r\nobserved: If therefore the roots be sufficiently covered to keep the\r\nbody steady and erect, it is enough; and the not minding of this\r\ntrifling circumstance, does very much deceive our ordinary wood-men, as\r\nwell as gardiners; for most roots covet the air (though that of the\r\n_Quercus urbano_ least of any); for like the _Esculus_\r\n\r\n    How much to heaven her towring head ascends,\r\n    So much towards hell her piercing root extends.{41:2}\r\n\r\nAnd the perfection of that, does almost as much concern the prosperity\r\nof a tree, as of man himself, since _homo_ is but _arbor inversa_; which\r\nprompts me to this curious, but important advertisement, that the\r\nposition be likewise sedulously observed.\r\n\r\n7. For, the southern parts being more dilated, and the pores expos’d (as\r\nevidently appears in their horizontal sections) by the constant\r\nexcentricity of the hyperbolical circles of all trees, (save just under\r\nÆquator, where the circles concentre, as we find in those hard woods\r\nwhich grow there) ours, being now on the sudden, and at such a season\r\nconverted to the north, does starve and destroy more trees (how careful\r\nsoever men have been in ordering the roots, and preparing the ground,)\r\nthan any other accident whatsoever (neglect of staking, and defending\r\nfrom cattle excepted); the importance whereof caused the best of poets,\r\nand most experienc’d in this _Argument_, giving advice concerning this\r\narticle, to add.\r\n\r\n    The card’nal points upon the bark they sign,\r\n    And as before it stood, in the same line\r\n    Place to warm south, or the obverted pole;\r\n    Such force has custom, in each tender soul.{42:1}\r\n\r\nWhich monition, though Pliny, and some others think good to neglect, or\r\nesteem indifferent, I can confirm from frequent losses of my own, and by\r\nparticular tryals; having sometimes transplanted great trees at\r\nmid-summer with success (the earth adhering to the roots) and miscarried\r\nin others, where this circumstance only was omitted.\r\n\r\nTo observe therefore the coast, and side of the stock (especially of\r\nfruit-trees) is not such a trifle as by some pretended: For if the air\r\nbe as much the mother or nurse, as water and earth, (as more than\r\nprobable it is) such blossoming plants as court the motion of the\r\nmeridian sun, do as ’t were evidently point out the advantage they\r\nreceive by their position, by the clearness, politure, and comparative\r\nsplendor of the southside: And the frequent mossiness of trees on the\r\nopposite side, does sufficiently note the unkindness of that aspect;\r\nmost evident in the bark of oaks white and smooth; the trees growing\r\nmore kindly on the south side of an hill, than those which are expos’d\r\nto the north, with an hard, dark, rougher and more mossie integument, as\r\nI can now demonstrate in a prodigious coat of it, investing some\r\npyracanths which I have removed to a northern dripping shade. I have\r\nseen (writes a worthy friend to me on this occasion) whole hedge-rows of\r\napples and pears that quite perished after that shelter was removed: The\r\ngood husbands expected the contrary, and that the fruit should improve,\r\nas freed from the prœdations of the hedge; but use and custom made that\r\nshelter necessary; and therefore (saith he) a stock for a time is the\r\nweaker, taken out of a thicket, if it be not well protected from all\r\nsudden and fierce invasions, either of crude air or winds. Nor let any\r\nbe deterr’d, if being to remove any trees, he shall esteem it too\r\nconsumptive of time; for with a brush dipped in any white colour, or\r\noaker, a thousand may be marked as they stand, in a moment; and that\r\nonce done, the difficulty is over. I have been the larger upon these two\r\nremarks, because I find them so material, and yet so much neglected.\r\n\r\n8. There are other rules concerning the situation of trees; the former\r\nauthor commending the north-east-wind both for the flourishing of the\r\ntree, and advantage of the timber; but to my observation in our\r\nclimates, where those sharp winds do rather flanker than blow fully\r\nopposite upon our plantations, they thrive best; and there are as well\r\nother circumstances to be considered, as they respect rivers and marshes\r\nobnoxious to unwholsom and poysonous fogs, hills and seas, which expose\r\nthem to the weather; and those _silvifragi venti_, our cruel and tedious\r\nwestern-winds; all which I leave to observation, because these accidents\r\ndo so universally govern, that it is not easie to determine farther than\r\nthat the timber is commonly better qualified which hath endur’d the\r\ncolder aspects without these prejudices. And hence it is that Seneca\r\nobserves, wood most expos’d to the winds to be the most strong and\r\nsolid, and that therefore _Chiron_ made _Achilles’s_ spear of a\r\nmountain-tree; and of those the best, which grow thin, not much\r\nshelter’d from the north. Again, Theophrastus seems to have special\r\nregard to places; exemplifying in many of Greece, which exceeded others\r\nfor good timber, as doubtless do our oaks in the Forest of Dean all\r\nothers of England: And much certainly there may reasonably be attributed\r\nto these advantages for the growth of timber, and of almost all other\r\ntrees, as we daily see by their general improsperity, where the ground\r\nis a hot gravel, and a loose earth: An oak, or elm in such a place shall\r\nnot in an hundred years, overtake one of fifty, planted in its proper\r\nsoil; though next to this, and (haply) before it, I prefer the good air.\r\nBut thus have they such vast junipers in Spain; and the ash in some\r\nparts of the Levant (as of old near Troy) so excellent, as it was after\r\nmistaken for cedar, so great was the difference; as now the Cantabrian,\r\nor Spanish exceeds any we have elsewhere in Europe. And we shall\r\nsometimes in our own country see woods within a little of each other,\r\nand to all appearance, growing on the same soil, where oaks of twenty\r\nyears growth, or forty, will in the same bulk, contain their double in\r\nheart and timber; and that in one, the heart will not be so big as a\r\nman’s arm, when the trunk exceeds a man’s body: This ought therefore to\r\nbe weighed in the first plantation of copses, and a good eye may discern\r\nit in the first shoot; the difference proceeding doubtless from the\r\nvariety of the seed, and therefore great care should be had of its\r\ngoodness, and that it be gather’d from the best sort of trees, as was\r\nformerly hinted, Chap. 1.\r\n\r\n9. _Veterem arborem transplantare_ was said of a difficult enterprize;\r\nyet before we take leave of this paragraph, concerning the transplanting\r\nof great trees, and to shew what is possible to be effected in this\r\nkind, with cost and industry; Count Maurice (the late Governor of Brasil\r\nfor the Hollanders) planted a grove near his delicious paradise of\r\nFriburgh, containing six hundred coco-trees of eighty years growth, and\r\nfifty foot high to the nearest bough: These he wafted upon floats and\r\nengines, four long miles; and planted them so luckily, that they bare\r\nabundantly the very first year; as Gasper Barlœus hath related in his\r\nElegant Description of that Prince’s Expedition. Nor hath this only\r\nsucceeded in the Indies alone; Monsieur de Fiat (one of the Mareschals\r\nof France) hath with huge oaks done the like at Fiat. Shall I yet bring\r\nyou nearer home? A great person in Devon, planted oaks as big as twelve\r\noxen could draw, to supply some defect in an avenue to one of his\r\nhouses; as the Right Honourable the Lord Fitz-Harding, late Treasurer of\r\nHis Majesty’s Household, assur’d me; who had himself likewise practis’d\r\nthe removing of great oaks by a particular address extreamly ingenious,\r\nand worthy the communication.\r\n\r\n10. Chuse a tree as big as your thigh, remove the earth from about him;\r\ncut through all the collateral roots, till with a competent strength you\r\ncan enforce him down upon one side, so as to come with your ax at the\r\ntop-root; cut that off, redress your tree, and so let it stand cover’d\r\nabout with the mould you loosen’d from it, till the next year, or longer\r\nif you think good; then take it up at a fit season; it will likely have\r\ndrawn new tender roots apt to take, and sufficient for the tree,\r\nwheresoever you shall transplant him. Some are for laying bare the whole\r\nroots, and then dividing it into 4 parts, in form of a cross, to cut\r\naway the interjacent rootlings, leaving only the cross and master-roots,\r\nthat were spared to support the tree; and then covering the pit with\r\nfresh mould (as above) after a year or two, when it has put forth, and\r\nfurnish’d the interstices you left between the cross-roots, with plenty\r\nof new fibers and tender shoots, you may safely remove the tree itself,\r\nso soon as you have loosened and reduc’d the 4 decusseted roots, and\r\nshortned the top-roots: And this operation is done without stooping or\r\nbending the tree at all: And if in removing it with as much of the clod\r\nabout the new roots, as possible, it would be much the better.\r\n\r\nPliny notes it as a common thing, to re-establish huge trees which have\r\nbeen blown down, part of their roots torn up, and the body prostrate;\r\nand, in particular, of a firr, that when it was to be transplanted, had\r\na top-root which went no less than eight cubits perpendicular; and to\r\nthese I could superadd (by woful experience) where some oaks, and other\r\nold trees of mine, tore up with their fall and ruin, portions of earth\r\n(in which their former spreading roots were ingag’d) little less in bulk\r\nand height than some ordinary cottages and houses, built on the common:\r\nSuch havock, was the effect of the late prodigious hurricane. But to\r\nproceed. To facilitate the removal of such monstrous trees, for the\r\nadornment of some particular place, or the rarity of the plant, there is\r\nthis farther expedient: A little before the hardest frosts surprise you,\r\nmake a square trench about your tree, at such distance from the stem as\r\nyou judge sufficient for the root; dig this of competent depth, so as\r\nalmost quite to undermine it; by placing blocks and quarters of wood, to\r\nsustain the earth; this done, cast in as much water as may fill the\r\ntrench, or at least sufficiently wet it, unless the ground were very\r\nmoist before. Thus let it stand, till some very hard frost do bind it\r\nfirmly to the roots, and then convey it to the pit prepar’d for its new\r\nstation, which you may preserve from freezing, by laying store of warm\r\nlitter in it, and so close the mould the better to the stragling fibers,\r\nplacing what you take out about your new guest, to preserve it in\r\ntemper: But in case the mould about it be so ponderous as not to be\r\nremov’d by an ordinary force; you may then raise it with a crane or\r\npully, hanging between a triangle (or like machine) which is made of\r\nthree strong and tall limbs united at the top, where a pully is fastned,\r\nas the cables are to be under the quarters which bear the earth about\r\nthe roots: For by this means you may weigh up, and place the whole\r\nweighty clod upon a trundle, sledge, or other carriage, to be convey’d\r\nand replanted where you please, being let down perpendicularly into the\r\nplace by the help of the foresaid engine. And by this address you may\r\ntransplant trees of a wonderful stature, without the least disorder; and\r\nmany times without topping, or diminution of the head, which is of great\r\nimportance, where this is practis’d to supply a defect, or remove a\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n11. Some advise, that in planting of oaks, &c. four or five be suffer’d\r\nto stand very near to one another, and then to leave the most\r\nprosperous, when they find the rest to disturb his growth; but I\r\nconceive it were better to plant them at such distances, as they may\r\nleast incommode one another: For timber-trees, I would have none nearer\r\nthan forty foot where they stand closest; especially of the spreading\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n12. Lastly, trees of ordinary stature transplanted (being first well\r\nwater’d) must be sufficiently staked, and bush’d about with thorns, or\r\nwith something better, to protect them from the concussions of the\r\nwinds, and from the casual rubbing, and poysonous brutting of cattle and\r\nsheep, the oyliness of whose wooll is also very noxious to them; till\r\nbeing well grown and fixed (which by seven years will be to some\r\ncompetent degree) they shall be able to withstand all accidental\r\ninvasions, but the axe; for I am now come to their pruning and cutting,\r\nin which work the seasons are of main importance.\r\n\r\n13. Therefore, if you would propagate trees for timber, cut not off\r\ntheir heads at all, nor be too busie with lopping: But if you desire\r\nshade and fuel, or bearing of mast alone, lop off their tops, sear, and\r\nunthriving branches only: If you intend an outright felling, expect till\r\nNovember; for this prœmature cutting down of trees before the sap is\r\nperfectly at rest, will be to your exceeding prejudice, by reason of the\r\nworm, which will certainly breed in timber which is felled before that\r\nperiod: But in case you cut only for the chimney, you need not be so\r\npunctual as to the time; yet for the benefit of what you let stand,\r\nobserve the moon’s increase if you please. The reason of these\r\ndifferences, is; because this is the best season for the growth of the\r\ntree which you do not fell, the other for the durableness of the timber\r\nwhich you do: Now that which is to be burnt is not so material for\r\nlasting, as the growth of the tree is considerable for the timber: But\r\nof these particulars more at large in cap. 3. book III.\r\n\r\n14. The very stumps of oak, especially that part which is dry, and above\r\nground, being well grubb’d, is many times worth the pains and charge,\r\nfor sundry rare and hard works; and where timber is dear. I could name\r\nsome who abandoning this to workmen for their pains only, when they\r\nperceiv’d the great advantage, repented of their bargain, and\r\nundertaking it themselves, were gainers above half: I wish only for the\r\nexpedition of this knotty work, some effectual engine were devised; such\r\nas I have been told a worthy person of this nation made use of, by which\r\nhe was able with one man, to perform more than with twelve oxen; and\r\nsurely, there might be much done by fastning of iron-hooks and fangs\r\nabout one root, to extract another; the hook chain’d to some portable\r\nscrew or winch: I say, such an invention might effect wonders, not only\r\nfor the extirpation of roots, but the prostrating of huge trees: That\r\nsmall engine, which by some is call’d the _german-devil_, reform’d after\r\nthis manner, and duly applied, might be very expedient for this purpose,\r\nand therefore we have exhibited the following figure, and submit it to\r\nimprovement and tryal.\r\n\r\nBut this is to be practis’d only where you design a final extirpation;\r\nfor some have drawn suckers even from an old stub-root; but they\r\ncertainly perish by the moss which invades them, and are very subject to\r\ngrow rotten. Pliny speaks of one root, which took up an entire acre of\r\nground, and Theophrastus describes the _Lycean Platanus_ to have spread\r\nan hundred foot; if so, the argument may hold good for their growth\r\nafter the tree is come to its period. They made cups of the roots of\r\noaks heretofore, and such a curiosity Athenæus tells us was carv’d by\r\nThericleus himself; and there is a way so to tinge oak after long\r\nburying and soaking in water, (which gives it a wonderful politure) as\r\nthat it has frequently been taken for a course ebony: Hence even by\r\nfloating, comes the Bohemian oak, Polish, and other northern timber, to\r\nbe of such excellent use for some parts of shipping: But the blackness\r\nwhich we find in oaks, that have long lain under ground, (and may be\r\ncall’d subterranean timber) proceeds from some vitriolic juice of the\r\nbed in which they lie, which makes it very weighty; but (as the\r\nexcellent naturalist and learned physician Dr. Sloane observes) it\r\ndries, splits, and becomes light, and much impairs.\r\n\r\n15. There is not in nature a thing more obnoxious to deceit, than the\r\nbuying of trees standing, upon the reputation of their appearance to\r\nthe eye, unless the chapman be extraordinarily judicious; so various are\r\ntheir hidden and conceal’d infirmities, till they be fell’d and sawn\r\nout: So as if to any thing applicable, certainly there is nothing which\r\ndoes more perfectly confirm it, than the most flourishing out-side of\r\ntrees, _fronti nulla fides_. A timber-tree is a merchant-adventurer, you\r\nshall never know what he is worth till he be dead.\r\n\r\n16. Oaks are in some places (where the soil is especially qualified)\r\nready to be cut for cops in fourteen years and sooner; I compute from\r\nthe first semination; though it be told as an instance of high\r\nencouragement (and as indeed it merits) that a lady in Northamptonshire\r\nsowed acorns, and liv’d to cut the trees produc’d from them, twice in\r\ntwo and twenty years; and both as well grown as most are in sixteen or\r\neighteen. This yet is certain, that acorns set in hedg-rows, have in\r\nthirty years born a stem of a foot diameter. Generally, cops-wood should\r\nbe cut close, and at such intervals as the growth requires; which being\r\nseldom constant, depends much on the places and the kinds, the mould and\r\nthe air, and for which there are extant particular statutes to direct\r\nus; of all which more at large hereafter. Oak for tan-bark may be fell’d\r\nfrom April to the last of June, by a Statute in the 1 _Jacobi_. And here\r\nsome are for the disbarking of oaks, and so to let them stand, before\r\nthey fell.\r\n\r\n17. To enumerate now the incomparable uses of this wood, were needless;\r\nbut so precious was the esteem of it, that of old there was an express\r\nlaw amongst the Twelve Tables, concerning the very gathering of the\r\nacorns, though they should be found fallen into another man’s ground:\r\nThe land and the sea do sufficiently speak for the improvement of this\r\nexcellent material; houses and ships, cities and navies are built with\r\nit; and there is a kind of it so tough, and extreamly compact, that our\r\nsharpest tools will hardly enter it, and scarcely the very fire it self,\r\nin which it consumes but slowly, as seeming to partake of a ferruginous\r\nand metallin shining nature, proper for sundry robust uses. It is\r\ndoubtless of all timber hitherto known, the most universally useful and\r\nstrong; for though some trees be harder, as box, cornus, ebony, and\r\ndivers of the Indian woods; yet we find them more fragil, and not so\r\nwell qualify’d to support great incumbencies and weights, nor is there\r\nany timber more lasting, which way soever us’d. There has (we know) been\r\nno little stir amongst learned men, of what material the Cross was made,\r\non which our Blessed Saviour suffer’d: Venerable Bede in _Collectaneis_,\r\naffirms it to have been fram’d of several woods, namely cypress, cedar,\r\npine, and box; and to confirm it S. Hierom has cited the 6th of _Isaiah_\r\n13. _Gloria libani ad te veniet, & buxus & pinus simul ad ornandum locum\r\nsanctificationis meæ, & locum pedum meorum significabo_; but following\r\nthe version of the LXX. he reads _in cupresso, pinu & cedro_, &c. Others\r\ninsert the palm, and so compose the gibbet of no less than four\r\ndifferent timbers, according to the old verse:\r\n\r\n    Nail’d were his feet to cedar, to palm his hands;\r\n    Cypress his Body bore, title on olive stands:{52:1}\r\n\r\nAnd for this of the palm, they fetch it from that of 7 _Cant._ 8. where\r\n’tis said, _ascendam in palmam, & apprehendam fructus ejus_, and from\r\nother allegorical and mysterious expressions of the Sacred Text, without\r\nany manner of probability; whilst by Alphonsus Ciacconius, Lipsius,\r\nAngelus Rocca, Falconius, and divers other learned men (writing on this\r\nsubject) and upon accurate examination of the many fragments pretended\r\nto be parcels of it, ’tis generally concluded to have been the oak; and\r\nI do verily believe it; since those who have described those countries,\r\nassure us there is no tree more frequent; which (with relation to\r\nseveral celebrations and mysteries under oaks in the Old Testament) has\r\nbeen the subject of many fine discourses. Nor is it likely they should\r\nchuse, or assemble so many sorts of woods with that curiosity, to\r\nexecute one upon, whom they esteemed a malefactor; besides, we read how\r\nheavy it was, which cypress, cedar and palm are not in comparison with\r\noak; whilst Gretser denies all this, _lib._ 1. _cap._ 6. and concludes\r\nupon his accurate examination of several fragments yet extant, that ’tis\r\nnot discernible of what timber it was fram’d. We might add to these, the\r\nfurious zeal of the bloody and malicious Jews (to see our B. Lord\r\ninhumanly executed) could not possibly allow leisure to frame a gibbet\r\nof so many rare and curious materials: Let this therefore pass for an\r\nerrant legend.\r\n\r\nThat which is twin’d and a little wreathed (easily to be discern’d by\r\nthe texture of the bark) is best to support burthens for posts, columns,\r\nsummers, &c. for all which our English oak is infinitely preferable to\r\nthe French, which is nothing so useful, nor comparably so strong;\r\ninsomuch as I have frequently admir’d at the sudden failing of most\r\ngoodly timber to the eye, which being employ’d to these uses, does many\r\ntimes most dangerously fly in sunder, as wanting that native spring and\r\ntoughness which our English oak is indu’d withal. And here we forget not\r\nthe stress which Sir H. Wotton, and other architects put even in the\r\nvery position of their growth, their native streightness and loftiness,\r\nfor columns, supporters, cross-beams, &c. and ’tis found that the\r\nrough-grain’d body of a stubbed oak, is the fittest timber for the case\r\nof a cyder-mill, and such like engines, as best enduring the unquietness\r\nof a ponderous rolling-stone. For shingles, pales, lathes, coopers ware,\r\nclap-board for wainscot, (the ancient{54:1} _intestina opera_ and works\r\nwithin doors) and some pannells are curiously vein’d, of much esteem in\r\nformer times, till the finer grain’d Spanish and Norway timber came\r\namongst us, which is likewise of a whiter colour. There is in\r\nNew-England a certain red-oak, which being fell’d, they season in some\r\nmoist and muddy place, which branches into very curious works. It is\r\nobserv’d that oak will not easily glue to other wood; no not very well\r\nwith its own kind; and some sorts will never cohere tolerably, as the\r\nbox and horn-beam, tho’ both hard woods; so nor service with cornell,\r\n&c. Oak is excellent for wheel-spokes, pins and pegs for tyling, &c. Mr.\r\nBlith makes spars and small building-timber of oaks of eleven years\r\ngrowth, which is a prodigious advance, &c. The smallest and streightest\r\nis best, discover’d by the upright tenor of the bark, as being the most\r\nproper for cleaving: The knottiest for water-works, piles, and the like,\r\nbecause ’twill drive best, and last longest; the crooked, yet firm, for\r\nknee-timber in shipping, millwheels, &c. In a word, how absolutely\r\nnecessary the oak is above all the trees of the forest in\r\nnaval-architecture, &c. consult Whitson, lib. 1. cap. 13.\r\n\r\nWere planting of these woods more in use, we should banish our hoops of\r\nhazel, &c. for those of good copse-oak, which being made of the younger\r\nshoots, are exceeding tough and strong: One of them being of ground-oak,\r\nwill outlast six of the best ash; but this our coopers love not to hear\r\nof, who work by the great for sale, and for others. The smaller\r\ntrunchions and spray, make billet, bavine and coals; and the bark is of\r\nprice with the tanner and dyer, to whom the very saw-dust is of use, as\r\nare the ashes and lee for bucking linnen; and to cure the roapishness of\r\nwine: And ’tis probable the cups of our acorns would tan leather as well\r\nas the bark, I wonder no body makes the experiment, as it is done in\r\nTurky with the _valonia_, which is a kind of acorn growing on the oaks.\r\nThe ground-oak, while young, is us’d for poles, cudgels and\r\nwalking-staffs, much come into mode of late, but to the wast of many a\r\nhopeful plant which might have prov’d good timber; and I the rather\r\ndeclaim against the custom, because I suspect they are such as are for\r\nthe most part cut, and stolen by idle persons, and brought up to London\r\nin great bundles, without the knowledge or leave of the owners, who\r\nwould never have glean’d their copses for such trifling uses. Here I am\r\nagain to give a general notice of the peculiar excellency of the roots\r\nof most trees, for fair, beautiful, chamleted and lasting timber,\r\napplicable to many purposes; such as formerly made hafts for daggers,\r\nhangers, knives, handles for staves, tabacco-boxes, and elegant\r\njoyners-work, and even for some mathematical instruments of the larger\r\nsize, to be had either in, or near the roots of many trees; however ’tis\r\na kindness to premonish stewards and surveyors, that they do not\r\nnegligently wast those materials: Nor may we here omit to mention tables\r\nfor painters, which heretofore were us’d by the most famous artists,\r\nespecially the curious pieces of Raphael, Durer, and Holbin, and before\r\nthat of canvass, and much more lasting: To these add the galls,\r\nmisletoe, polypod, agaric (us’d in antidotes) uvæ, fungus’s to make\r\ntinder, and many other useful excrescencies, to the number of above\r\ntwenty, which doubtless discover the variety of transudations,\r\npercolations and contextures of this admirable tree; but of the several\r\nfruits, and animals generated of them, and other trees, Francisco Redi\r\npromises an express Treatise, in his _Esperienze intorno alla\r\nGeneratione de gl’ Insetti_, already publish’d. Pliny affirms, that the\r\ngalls break out all together in one night, about the beginning of June,\r\nand arrive to their full growth in one day; this I should recommend to\r\nthe experience of some extraordinary vigilant wood-man, had we any of\r\nour oaks that produc’d them, Italy and Spain being the nearest that do:\r\nGalls are of several kinds, but grow upon a different species of _robur_\r\nfrom any of ours, which never arrive to any maturity; the white and\r\nimperforated are the best; of all which, and their several species, see\r\nJasp. Bauhinus, and the excellent Malpighius, in his Discourse _de\r\nGallis_, and other morbous tumors, raised by, and producing insects,\r\ninfecting the leaves, stalks and branches of this tree with a venomous\r\nliquor or froth, wherein they lay and deposite their eggs, which bore\r\nand perforate these excrescences, when the worms are hatch’d, so as we\r\nsee them in galls.\r\n\r\nWhat benefit the mast does universally yield (once in two years at\r\nleast) for the fatting of hogs and deer, I shall shew upon another\r\noccasion, before the conclusion of this Discourse. A peck of acorns a\r\nday, with a little bran, will make an hog (’tis said) increase a\r\npound-weight _per diem_ for two months together. They give them also to\r\noxen mingled with bran, chop’d or broken; otherwise they are apt to\r\nsprout and grow in their bellies. Others say, they should first be\r\nmacerated in water, to extract their malignity; cattle many times\r\nperishing without this preparation. Cato advises the husband-man to\r\nreserve 240 bushels of acorns for his oxen, mingled with a like quantity\r\nof beans and lupines, and to drench them well. But in truth they are\r\nmore proper for swine, and being so made small, will fatten pidgeons,\r\npeacocks, turkeys, pheasants and poultry; nay ’tis reported, that some\r\nfishes feed on them, especially the tunny, in such places of the coast\r\nwhere trees hang over arms of the sea. Acorns, _esculus ab esca_ (before\r\nthe use of wheat-corn was found out) were heretofore the food of men,\r\nnay of Jupiter himself, (as well as other productions of the earth) till\r\ntheir luxurious palats were debauched: And even in the Romans time, the\r\ncustom was in Spain to make a second service of acorns and mast, (as the\r\nFrench now do of marrons and chesnuts) which they likewise used to rost\r\nunder the embers.\r\n\r\n          ........Fed with the oaken mast\r\n    The aged trees themselves in years surpass’d.{57:1}\r\n\r\nAnd men had indeed hearts of oak; I mean, not so hard, but health, and\r\nstrength, and liv’d naturally, and with things easily parable and plain.\r\n\r\n    Blest age o’th’ world, just nymph, when man did dwell\r\n    Under thy shade, whence his provision fell;\r\n    Sallads the meal, wildings were the dissert:\r\n    No tree yet learn’d by ill-example, art,\r\n    With insititious fruit to symbolize,\r\n    As in an emblem, our adulteries.{58:1}\r\n\r\nAs the sweet poet bespeaks the dryad; and therefore it was not call’d\r\n_Quercus_, (as some etymologists fancy’d) because the Pagans\r\n(_quæribantur responsa_) had their oracles under it, but because they\r\nsought for acorns: But ’tis in another{58:2} place where I shew you what\r\nthis acorn was; and even now I am told, that those small young acorns\r\nwhich we find in the stock-doves craws, are a delicious fare, as well as\r\nthose incomparable salads of young herbs taken out of the maws of\r\npartridges at a certain season of the year, which gives them a\r\npreparation far exceeding all the art of cookery. Oaks bear also a knur,\r\nfull of a cottony matter, of which they anciently made wick for their\r\nlamps and candles; and among the _Selectiora Remedia_ of Jo. Prævotius,\r\nthere is mention of an oil _e querna glande_ chymically extracted, which\r\nhe affirms to be of the longest continuance, and least consumptive of\r\nany other whatsoever for such lights, _ita ut uncia singulis mensibus\r\nvix ab sumatur continuo igne_: The ingenious author of the Description\r\nof the Western Islands of Scotland, tells us, that (upon his own\r\nexperience) a rod of oak of 4, 5, 6 or 8 inches about, being twisted\r\nlike a with, boil’d in wort, well dry’d, and kept in a little bundle of\r\nbarley-straw, and then steep’d again in wort, causes it to ferment, and\r\nprocures yest: The rod should be cut before mid-May, and is frequently\r\nus’d in this manner to furnish yest, and being preserv’d, will serve,\r\nand produce the same effect many years together; and (as the historian\r\naffirms) that he was shew’d a piece of a thick wyth, which had been kept\r\nfor making ale with for above 20 years, &c. In the mean time, the leaves\r\nof oaks abundantly congested on snow, preserve it as well for wine, as a\r\ndeep pit, or the most artificial refrigeratory. Nor must we pass by the\r\nsweet mel-dews, so much more copiously found on the leaves of this tree,\r\nthan any other; whence the industrious bees gather such abundance of\r\nhoney, as that instead of carrying it to their hives, they glut\r\nthemselves to death: But from this ill report (hastily taken up by\r\nEuricius Cordus) our learned Mr. Ray has vindicated this temperat and\r\nabstemious useful creature. Varro affirms, they made salt of oak ashes,\r\nwith which they sometimes seasoned meat, but more frequently made use of\r\nit to sprinkle among, and fertilize their seed-corn: Which minds me of a\r\ncertain oak found buried somewhere in Transilvania, near the Salt-pits,\r\nthat was entirely converted into an hard salt, when they came to examine\r\nit by cutting. This experiment (if true) may possibly encourage some\r\nother attempts for the multiplying of salt: Nor less strange is that\r\nwhich some report of a certain water somewhere in Hungary, which\r\ntransmutes the leaves of this tree into brass, and iron into copper. Of\r\nthe galls is made trial of spaw-water, and the ground and basis of\r\nseveral dies, especially sadder colours, and are a great revenue to\r\nthose who have quantities of them: Nor must I forget ink, compos’d of\r\ngalls ℥iiij, coppras ℥ij, gum-arabic ℥i: Beat the galls grossly, and put\r\nthem into a quart of claret, or French-wine, and let them soak for eight\r\nor nine days, setting the vessel (an earthen glaz’d pitcher is best) in\r\nthe hot sun, if made in summer; in winter near the fire, stirring it\r\nfrequently with a wooden spatula: Then add the coppras and gum, and\r\nafter it has stood a day or two, it will be fit to use. There are a\r\nworld of receipts more, of which see _Caneparius de Atramentis_. Of the\r\nvery moss of the oak, that which is white, composes the choicest\r\ncypress-powder, which is esteemed good for the head; but impostors\r\nfamiliarly vend other mosses under that name, as they do the fungi\r\n(excellent in hemorages and fluxes) for the true agaric, to the great\r\nscandal of physick. Young red oaken leaves decocted in wine, make an\r\nexcellent gargle for a sore mouth; and almost every part of this tree is\r\nsoveraign against fluxes in general, and where astringents are proper.\r\nThe dew that impearls the leaves in May, insolated, meteorizes and sends\r\nup a liquor, which is of admirable effect in ruptures: The liquor\r\nissuing out between the bark, (which looks like treakle) has many\r\nsoveraign vertues; and some affirm, the water stagnate in the hollow\r\nstump of a newly fell’d oak, is as effectual as _lignum sanctum_ in the\r\nfoul disease, and also stops a diarrhæa: And a water distill’d from the\r\nacorns is good against the pthisick, stitch in the side, and heals\r\ninward ulcers, breaks the stone, and refrigerates inflammations, being\r\napplied with linnen dipp’d therein: nay, the acorns themselves eaten\r\nfasting, kill the worms, provoke urine, and (some affirm) break even the\r\nstone it self. The coals of oak beaten and mingled with honey, cures the\r\ncarbuncle; to say nothing of the viscus’s, polypods, and other\r\nexcrescences, of which innumerable remedies are composed, noble\r\nantidotes, syrups, &c. Nay, ’tis reported, that the very shade of this\r\ntree is so wholesome, that the sleeping, or lying under it becomes a\r\npresent remedy to paralyticks, and recovers those whom the mistaken\r\nmalign influence of the walnut-tree has smitten: But what is still more\r\nstrange, I read in one Paulus a Physician of Denmark, that an handful or\r\ntwo of small oak buttons, mingled with oats, given to horses which are\r\nblack of colour, will in few days eating alter it to a fine dapple-grey,\r\nwhich he attributes to the vitriol abounding in this tree. To conclude;\r\nand upon serious meditation of the various uses of this and other trees,\r\nwe cannot but take notice of the admirable mechanism of vegetables in\r\ngeneral, as in particular in this species; that by the diversity of\r\npercolations and strainers, and by mixtures, as it were of divine\r\nchymistry, various concoctions, &c. the sap should be so green on the\r\nindented leaves, so lustily esculent for our hardier and rustick\r\nconstitutions in the fruit; so flat and pallid in the atramental galls;\r\nand haply, so prognostick in the apple; so suberous in the bark (for\r\neven the cork-tree is but a courser oak) so oozie in the tanners pit;\r\nand in that subduction so wonderfully specifick in corroborating the\r\nentrails, and bladder, reins, loins, back, &c. which are all but the\r\ngifts and qualities, with many more, that these robust sons of the earth\r\nafford us; and that in other specifics, even the most despicable and\r\nvulgar elder imparts to us in its rind, leaves, buds, blossoms, berries,\r\nears, pith, bark, &c. Which hint may also carry our remarks upon all the\r\nvarieties of shape, leaf, seed, fruit, timber, grain, colour, and all\r\nthose other forms {62:1} that philosophers have enumerated; but which\r\nwere here too many for us to repeat. In a word, so great and universal\r\nis the benefit and use of this poly-crest, that they have prohibited the\r\ntransporting it out of Norway, where there grows abundance. Let us end\r\nwith the poet:\r\n\r\n    When ships for bloody combat we prepare,\r\n    Oak affords plank, and arms our men of war;\r\n    Maintains our fires, makes ploughs to till the ground,\r\n    For use no timber like the oak is found.{62:2}\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n{31:1} _Saturn._ lib.

For though both these sorts are rais’d of _appendices_, or suckers\r\n(as anon we shall describe) yet this latter comes well from the _samera_\r\nor seeds, and therefore I suppose it to be the ancient _atinia_, for\r\nsuch an elm they acknowledge to be rais’d of seeds, which being ripe\r\nabout the beginning of March (though frequently not till the following\r\nmonth) will produce them; as we might have seen abundantly in the\r\ngardens of the Thuilleries, and that of Luxembourgh at Paris, where they\r\nusually sow themselves, and come up very thick; and so do they in many\r\nplaces of our country, tho’ so seldom taken notice of, as that it is\r\nesteemed a fable, by the less observant and ignorant vulgar; let it\r\ntherefore be tried in season, by turning and raking some fine earth,\r\noften refreshed, under some amply spreading tree, or to raise them of\r\ntheir seeds (being well dried a day or two before) sprinkled on beds\r\nprepar’d of good loamy fresh earth, and sifting some of the finest\r\nmould thinly over them, and watering them when need requires. Being\r\nrisen (which may be within 4 or 5 months) an inch above ground\r\n(refreshed, and preserved from the scraping of birds and poultry)\r\ncomfort the tender seedlings by a second sifting of more fine earth, to\r\nestablish them; thus keep them clean weeded for the first two years, and\r\ncleansing the side-boughs; or till being of fitting stature to remove\r\ninto a nursery at wider intervals, and even rows, you may thin and\r\ntransplant them in the same manner as you were directed for young oaks;\r\nonly they shall not need above one cutting, where they grow less regular\r\nand hopeful. But because this is an experiment of some curiosity,\r\nobnoxious to many casualties, and that the producing them from the\r\nmother-roots of greater trees is very facile and expeditious (besides\r\nthe numbers which are to be found in the hedge-rows and woods, of all\r\nplantable sizes) I rather advise our forester to furnish himself from\r\nthose places.\r\n\r\n3. The suckers which I speak of, are produced in abundance from the\r\nroots, whence, being dextrously separated, after the earth has been well\r\nloosened, and planted about the end of October, they will grow very\r\nwell: Nay, the stubs only, which are left in the ground after a felling\r\n(being fenced in as far as the roots extend) will furnish you with\r\nplenty, which may be transplanted from the first year or two,\r\nsuccessively, by slipping them from the roots, which will continually\r\nsupply you for many years, after that the body of the mother-tree has\r\nbeen cut down: And from hence probably is sprung that (I fear) mistake\r\nof Salmasius and others, where they write of the growing of their chips\r\n(I suppose having some of the bark on) scattered in hewing of their\r\ntimber; the error proceeding from this, that after an elm-tree has been\r\nfell’d, the numerous suckers which shoot from the remainders of the\r\nlatent roots, seem to be produced from this dispersion of the chips: Let\r\nthis yet be more accurately examined; for I pronounce nothing\r\nmagisterially, since it is so confidently reported.\r\n\r\n4. I have known stakes sharpned at the ends for other purposes, take\r\nroot familiarly in moist grounds, and become trees; and divers have\r\nessay’d with extraordinary success the trunchions of the boughs and arms\r\nof elms cut to the scantling of a man’s arm, about an ell in length.\r\nThese must be chopp’d on each side opposite, and laid into trenches\r\nabout half a foot deep, covered about two or three fingers deep with\r\ngood mould. The season for this work is towards the exit of January, or\r\nearly in February, if the frosts impede not; and after the first year,\r\nyou may cut, or saw the trunchions off in as many places as you find\r\ncause, and as the shoots and rooted sprouts will direct you for\r\ntransplantation. Another expedient for the propagation of elms is this:\r\nLet trenches be sunk at a good distance (viz. twenty or thirty yards)\r\nfrom such trees as stand in hedge-rows, and in such order as you desire\r\nyour elms should grow; where these gutters are, many young elms will\r\nspring from the small roots of the adjoining trees. Divide (after one\r\nyear) the shoots from their mother-roots (which you may dextrously do\r\nwith a sharp spade) and these transplanted, will prove good trees\r\nwithout any damage to their progenitors. Or do thus, lop a young elm,\r\nthe lop being about three years growth, do it in the latter end of\r\nMarch, when the sap begins to creep up into the boughs, and the buds\r\nready to break out; cut the boughs into lengths of four foot slanting,\r\nleaving the knot where the bud seems to put forth in the middle: Inter\r\nthese short pieces in trenches of three or four inches deep, and in good\r\nmould well trodden, and they will infallibly produce you a crop; for\r\neven the smallest suckers of elms will grow, being set when the sap is\r\nnewly stirring in them. There is yet a fourth way no less expeditious,\r\nand frequently confirmed with excellent success: Bare some of the\r\nmaster-roots of a vigorous tree within a foot of the trunk, or there\r\nabouts, and with your axe make several chops, putting a small stone into\r\nevery cleft, to hinder their closure, and give access to the wet; then\r\ncover them with three or four inch-thick of earth; and thus they will\r\nsend forth suckers in abundance, (I assure you one single elm thus well\r\nordered, is a fair nursery) which after two or three years, you may\r\nseparate and plant in the _Ulmarium_, or place designed for them; and\r\nwhich if it be in plumps (as they call them) within ten or twelve foot\r\nof each other, or in hedge-rows, it will be the better: For the elm is a\r\ntree of consort, sociable, and so affecting to grow in company, that the\r\nvery best which I have ever seen, do almost touch one another: This also\r\nprotects them from the winds, and causes them to shoot of an\r\nextraordinary height; so as in little more than forty years, they even\r\narrive to a load of timber; provided they be sedulously and carefully\r\ncultivated, and the soil propitious. For an elm does not thrive so well\r\nin the forest, as where it may enjoy scope for the roots to dilate and\r\nspread at the sides, as in hedge-rows and avenues, where they have the\r\nair likewise free: Note, that they spring abundantly by layers also.\r\n\r\n5. There is besides these sorts we have named, one of a more scabrous\r\nharsh leaf, but very large, which becomes an huge tree, (frequent in the\r\nnorthern counties) and is distinguished by the name of the witch-hazle\r\nin our Statute Books, as serving formerly to make long bowes of; but the\r\ntimber is not so good as the first more vulgar; but the bark at time of\r\nyear, will serve to make a course bast-rope with.\r\n\r\n6. Of all the trees which grow in our woods, there is none which does\r\nbetter suffer the transplantation than the elm; for you may remove a\r\ntree of twenty years growth with undoubted success: It is an experiment\r\nI have made in a tree almost as big more as my waste; but then you must\r\ntotally disbranch him, leaving only the summit intire; and being careful\r\nto take him up with as much earth as you can, refresh him with abundance\r\nof water. This is an excellent, and expeditious way for great persons to\r\nplant the accesses of their houses with; for being disposed at sixteen\r\nor eighteen foot interval, they will in a few years bear goodly heads,\r\nand thrive to admiration. Some that are very cautious, emplaster the\r\nwounds of such over-grown elms with a mixture of clay and horse-dung,\r\nbound about them with a wisp of hay or fine moss, and I do not reprove\r\nit, provided they take care to temper it well, so as the vermine nestle\r\nnot in it. But for more ordinary plantations, younger trees, which have\r\ntheir bark smooth and tender, clear of wenns and tuberous bunches (for\r\nthose of that sort seldom come to be stately trees) about the scantling\r\nof your leg, and their heads trimm’d at five or six foot height, are to\r\nbe prefer’d before all other. Cato would have none of these sorts of\r\ntrees to be removed till they are five or six fingers in diameter;\r\nothers think they cannot take them too young; but experience (the best\r\nmistress) tells us, that you can hardly plant an elm too big. There are\r\nwho pare away the root within two fingers of the stem, and quite cut off\r\nthe head; but I cannot commend this extream severity, no more than I do\r\nthe strewing of oats in the pit; which fermenting with the moisture and\r\nfrequent waterings, is believed much to accelerate the putting forth of\r\nthe roots; not considering, that for want of air they corrupt and grow\r\nmusty, which more frequently suffocates the roots, and endangers the\r\nwhole tree.\r\n\r\n7. I have affirmed how patient this tree is of transplantation; not only\r\nfor that I observe so few of them to grow wild in England, and where it\r\nmay not be suspected, but they or their predecessors have been planted\r\nby some industrious hand; but for that those incomparable walks and\r\nvistas of them, both at Aranjuez, Casal del Campo, Madrid, the Escurial,\r\nand other places of delight, belonging to the King and Grandees of\r\nSpain, are planted with such as they report Philip the second caused to\r\nbe brought out of England; before which (as that most honourable person\r\nthe Earl of Sandwich, when his Majesty’s Ambassador Extraordinary at\r\nthat Court writ to me) it does not appear there were any of those trees\r\nin all Spain. But of that plantation, see it more particularly describ’d\r\nin the Eighth Chapter, Book III^d of this Discourse, whither I refer my\r\nreader: Whilst (as to my own inclination) I know of no tree amongst all\r\nthe foresters, becoming the almost _interminat lontananza_ of walks and\r\nvistas, comparable to this majestick plant: But let us hear it as\r\nsweetly advised as described;\r\n\r\n    An elm for graceful verdure, bushy bough,\r\n    A lofty top, and a firm rind allow.\r\n    Plant elm in borders, on the grass-plots list,\r\n    Branches of elm into thick arbours twist;\r\n    A gallery of elm draw to the end,\r\n    That eyes can reach, or a breath’d race extend.{69:1}\r\n\r\n8. The elm delights in a sound, sweet, and fertile land, something more\r\ninclined to loamy moisture, and where good pasture is produced; though\r\nit will also prosper in the gravelly, provided there be a competent\r\ndepth of mould, and be refreshed with springs; in defect of which, being\r\nplanted on the very surface of the ground (the swarth par’d first away,\r\nand the earth stirred a foot deep or more) they will undoubtedly\r\nsucceed; but in this trial, let the roots be handsomly spread, and\r\ncovered a foot or more in height; and above all, firmly staked. This is\r\npracticable also for other trees, where the soil is over-moist or\r\nunkind: For as the elm does not thrive in too dry, sandy, or hot\r\ngrounds, no more will it abide the cold and spungy; but in places that\r\nare competently fertile, or a little elevated from these annoyances; as\r\nwe see in the mounds, and casting up of ditches, upon whose banks the\r\nfemale sort does more naturally delight; though it seems to be so much\r\nmore addicted to some places than to others, that I have frequently\r\ndoubted, whether it be a pure _indigene_ or _translatitious_; and not\r\nonly because I have hardly ever known any considerable woods of them\r\n(besides some few nurseries near Cambridge, planted I suppose for store)\r\nbut almost continually in tufts, hedge-rows, and mounds; and that\r\nShropshire, and several other counties, and rarely any beyond Stamford\r\nto Durham, have any growing in many miles together: Indeed Camden\r\nmentions a place in Yorkshire call’d Elmet; and V. Bede, _Eccl. Hist.\r\nl._ 11. c. 14. (speaking of a fire hap’ning there, and describing of the\r\nharm it did thereabout, _ulmarium_ or _ulmetum_) _evasit autem ignem\r\naltare, quia lapidium erat, & servatur adhuc in monasterio r. abbatis &\r\npresbyteri thrythwuelf, quod in sylva elmete est_; but neither does this\r\nspeak it miraculous, (for the altar it seems was stone) or that the elms\r\ngrew spontaneously. In the mean time, some affirm they were first\r\nbrought out of Lombardy, where indeed I have observ’d very goodly trees\r\nabout the rich grounds, with pines among them, _vitelus almi_; for I\r\nhear of none either in Saxony or Denmark, nor in France, (growing wild)\r\nwho all came and prey’d upon us after the Romans. But leaving this to\r\nthe learned.\r\n\r\n9. The elm is by reason of its aspiring and tapering growth, (unless it\r\nbe topped to enlarge the branches, and make them spread low) the least\r\noffensive to corn and pasture-grounds; to both which, and the cattel,\r\nthey afford a benign shade, defence, and agreeable ornament: But then as\r\nto pastures, the wand’ring roots (apt to infect the fields and grass\r\nwith innumerable suckers) the leading mother-root ought to be quite\r\nseparated on that part, and the suckers irradicated. The like should be\r\ndone where they are placed near walks of turf or gravel.\r\n\r\n10. It would be planted as shallow as might be; for, as we noted, deep\r\ninterring of roots is amongst the catholick mistakes; and of this, the\r\ngreatest to which trees are obnoxious. Let new-planted elms be kept\r\nmoist by frequent refreshings upon some half-rotten fern, or litter laid\r\nabout the foot of the stem; the earth a little stirred and depressed for\r\nthe better reception and retention of the water.\r\n\r\n11. Lastly, your plantation must above all things be carefully preserved\r\nfrom cattel and the concussions of impetuous winds, till they are out of\r\nreach of the one, and sturdy enough to encounter the other.\r\n\r\n12. When you lop the side-boughs of an elm (which may be about January\r\nfor the fire, and more frequently, if you desire to have them tall; or\r\nthat you would form them into hedges, for so they may be kept plashed,\r\nand thickned to the highest twig; affording both a magnificent and\r\naugust defence against the winds and sun) I say, when you trim them, be\r\ncareful to indulge the tops; for they protect the body of your trees\r\nfrom the wet, which always invades those parts first, and will in time\r\nperish them to the very heart; so as elms beginning thus to decay, are\r\nnot long prosperous. Sir Hugh Plat relates (as from an expert carpenter)\r\nthat the boughs and branches of an elm should be left a foot long next\r\nthe trunk when they are lopp’d; but this is to my certain observation, a\r\nvery great mistake either in the relator, or author; for I have noted\r\nmany elms so disbranched, that the remaining stubs grew immediately\r\nhollow, and were as so many conduits or pipes, to hold, and convey the\r\nrain to the very body and heart of the tree.\r\n\r\n13. There was a cloyster of the right French elm in the little garden\r\nnear to Her Majesty’s the Queen-Mother’s Chappel at Somerset-House,\r\nwhich were (I suppose) planted there, by the industry of the F. F.\r\nCapuchines, that would have directed you to the incomparable use of this\r\nnoble tree for shade and delight, into whatever figure you will accustom\r\nthem. I have my self procured some of them from Paris, but they were so\r\nabused in the transportation, that they all perished save one, which now\r\nflourishes with me: I have also lately graffed elms to a great\r\nimprovement of their heads. Virgil tells us they will join in marriage\r\nwith the oak, and they would both be tryed; and that with the more\r\nprobable success, for such lignous kinds, if you graff under the earth,\r\nupon, or near the very root it self, which is likely to entertain the\r\ncyon better than when more exposed, till it be well fixt, and have made\r\nsome considerable progress.\r\n\r\n14. When you would fell, let the sap be perfectly in repose; as ’tis\r\ncommonly about November or December, even to February, after the frost\r\nhath well nipp’d them: I have already alledged my reason for it; and I\r\nam told, that both oak and elm so cut, the very saplings (whereof\r\nrafters, spars, &c. are made) will continue as long as the very heart of\r\nthe tree, without decay. In this work, cut your kerfe near to the\r\nground; but have a care that it suffer not in the fall, and be ruined\r\nwith its own weight: This depends upon your wood-man’s judgment in\r\ndisbranching, and is a necessary caution to the felling of all other\r\ntimber-trees. If any begin to doat, pick out such for the axe, and\r\nrather trust to its successor. And if cutting over-late, by floating\r\nthem 2 or 3 months in the water, it prevents the worm, and proves the\r\nbest of seasons.\r\n\r\n15. Elm is a timber of most singular use; especially where it may lie\r\ncontinually dry, or wet, in extreams; therefore proper for water-works,\r\nmills, the ladles, and soles of the wheel, pipes, pumps, aquæ-ducts,\r\npales, ship-planks beneath the water-line; and some that has been found\r\nburied in bogs has turned like the most polish’d and hardest ebony, only\r\ndiscerned by the grain: Also for wheel-wrights, handles for the single\r\nhand-saw, rails and gates made of elm (thin sawed) is not so apt to rive\r\nas oak: The knotty for naves, hubs; the straight and smooth for\r\naxle-trees, and the very roots for curiously dappled works, scarce has\r\nany superior for kerbs of coppers, featheridge, and weather-boards, (but\r\nit does not without difficulty, admit the nail without boreing)\r\nchopping-blocks, blocks for the hat-maker, trunks, and boxes to be\r\ncovered with leather; coffins, for dressers and shovel-board-tables of\r\ngreat length, and a lustrous colour if rightly seasoned; also for the\r\ncarver, by reason of the tenor of the grain, and toughness which fits it\r\nfor all those curious works of frutages, foliage, shields, statues, and\r\nmost of the ornaments appertaining to the orders of architecture, and\r\nfor not being much subject to warping; I find that of old they used it\r\neven for hinges and hooks of doors; but then, that part of the plank\r\nwhich grew towards the top of the tree, was in work to be always\r\nreversed; and for that it is not so subject to rift; Vitruvius commends\r\nit both for tenons and mortaises: But besides these, and sundry other\r\nemployments, it makes also the second sort of charcoal; and finally,\r\n(which I must not omit) the use of the very leaves of this tree,\r\nespecially of the female, is not to be despis’d; for being suffered to\r\ndry in the sun upon the branches, and the spray strip’d off about the\r\ndecrease in August (as also where the suckers and stolones are\r\nsuper-numerary, and hinder the thriving of their nurses) they will prove\r\na great relief to cattel in winter, and scorching summers, when hay and\r\nfodder is dear they will eat them before oats, and thrive exceedingly\r\nwell with them; remember only to lay your boughs up in some dry and\r\nsweet corner of your barn: It was for this the poet prais’d them, and\r\nthe epithet was advis’d,\r\n\r\n    fruitful in leaves the elm.{74:1}\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Herefordshire they gather them in sacks for their\r\nswine, and other cattel, according to this husbandry. But I hear an ill\r\nreport of them for bees, that surfeiting of the blooming seeds, they are\r\nobnoxious to the lask, at their first going abroad in spring, which\r\nendangers whole stocks, if remedies be not timely adhibited; therefore\r\n’tis said in great elm countries they do not thrive; but the truth of\r\nwhich I am yet to learn. The green leaf of the elms contused, heals a\r\ngreen wound or cut, and boiled with the bark, consolidates fractur’d\r\nbones. All the parts of this tree are abstersive, and therefore\r\nsovereign for the consolidating wounds; and asswage the pains of the\r\ngout: But the bark decocted in common water, to almost the consistence\r\nof a syrup, adding a third part of _aqua vitæ_, is a most admirable\r\nremedy for the _ischiadicæ_ or hip-pain, the place being well rubb’d and\r\nchaf’d by the fire. Other wonderful cures perform’d by the liquor, &c.\r\nof this tree, see Mr. Ray’s _History of Plants_, lib. XXV. cap. 1. sect.\r\n5. and for other species of the elm, his Supplement, tom.

The beech, [_fagus_] (of two or three kinds) and numbred amongst the\r\nglandiferous trees, I rank here before the martial ash, because it\r\ncommonly grows to a greater stature. But here I may not omit a note of\r\nthe accurate critic Palmerius, upon a passage in Theophrastus,{75:1}\r\nwhere he animadverts upon his interpreter, and shews that the ancient\r\nΦηγὸς was by no means the beech, but a kind of oak; for that the\r\nfigure of the fruit is so widely unlike it, that being round, this\r\ntriangular; and both Theophrastus and Pausanias make it indeed a species\r\nof oak, (as already we have noted in cap. III.) wholly differing in\r\ntrunk, as well as fruit and leaf; to which he adds (what determines the\r\ncontroversie) ξύλον τῆς φηγοῦ ἰσχυρότατον καὶ ἀσηπέσατον, &c. _that\r\nit is of a firmer timber, not obnoxious to the worm_; neither of which\r\ncan so confidently be said of the beech. Yet La Cerda too seems guilty\r\nof the same mistake: But leaving this, there are of our _fagi_, two or\r\nthree kinds with us; the mountain (where it most affects to grow) which\r\nis the whitest, and most sought after by the turner; and the campestrial\r\nor wild, which is of a blacker colour, and more durable. They are both\r\nto be rais’d from the mast, and govern’d like the oak (of which amply)\r\nand that is absolutely the best way of furnishing a wood; unless you\r\nwill make a nursery, and then you are to treat the mast as you are\r\ninstructed in the chapter of ashes, sowing them in autumn, or later,\r\neven after January, or rather nearer the spring, to preserve them from\r\nvermin, which are very great devourers of them. But they are likewise to\r\nbe planted of young seedlings, to be drawn out of the places where the\r\nfruitful trees abound. In transplanting them, cut off only the boughs\r\nand bruised parts two inches from the stem, to within a yard of the top,\r\nbut be very sparing of the root: This for such as are of pretty stature.\r\nThey make spreading trees, and noble shades with their well furnish’d\r\nand glistering leaves, being set at forty foot distance, but they grow\r\ntaller, and more upright in the forests, where I have beheld them at\r\neight and ten foot, shoot into very long poles; but neither so apt for\r\ntimber, nor fuel: The shade unpropitious to corn and grass, but sweet,\r\nand of all the rest, most refreshing to the weary shepherd--_lentus in\r\numbra_, ecchoing Amaryllis with his oten pipe. Mabillon tells us in his\r\nItinerary, of the old beech at Villambrosa, to be still flourishing,\r\n(and greener than any of the rest) under whose umbrage the famous eremit\r\nGualbertus had his cell.\r\n\r\nThis tree planted in pallisade, affords a useful and pleasant skreen to\r\nshelter orange and other tender case-trees from the parching sun, &c.\r\ngrowing very tall, and little inferior to the horn-beam, or Dutch-elm.\r\nIn the valleys (where they stand warm, and in consort) they will grow to\r\na stupendous procerity, though the soil be stony and very barren: Also\r\nupon the declivities, sides, and tops of high hills, and chalky\r\nmountains especially, for tho’ they thrust not down such deep and\r\nnumerous roots as the oak; and grow to vast trees, they will strangely\r\ninsinuate their roots into the bowels of those seemingly impenetrable\r\nplaces, not much unlike the fir it self, which with this so common tree,\r\nthe great Cæsar denies to be found in Britanny; _Materia cujusque\r\ngeneris, ut in Gallia, præter fagum & abietem_: But certainly from a\r\ngrand mistake, or rather, for that he had not travelled much up into the\r\ncountrey: Some will have it _fagus_ instead of _ficus_, but that was\r\nnever reckon’d among the timber-trees: Virgil reports it will graff with\r\nthe chesnut.\r\n\r\n2. The beech serves for various uses of the housewife;\r\n\r\n    Hence in the world’s best years the humble shed,\r\n    Was happily, and fully furnished:\r\n    Beech made their chests, their beds and the joyn’d-stools,\r\n    Beech made the board, the platters, and the bowls.{77:1}\r\n\r\nWith it the turner makes dishes, trays, rimbs for buckets, and other\r\nutensils, trenchers, dresser-boards, &c. likewise for the wheeler,\r\njoyner, for large screws, and upholster for sellyes, chairs, stools,\r\nbedsteads, &c. for the bellows-maker, and husbandman his shovel and\r\nspade-graffs; floates for fishers nets instead of corks, is made of its\r\nbark; for fuel, billet, bavin and coal, tho’ one of the least lasting:\r\nNot to omit even the very shavings for the fining of wines. Peter\r\nCrescentius writes, that the ashes of beech, with proper mixture, is\r\nexcellent to make glass with. If the timber lie altogether under water,\r\n’tis little inferior to elm, as I find it practised and asserted by\r\nshipwrights: Of old they made their _vasa vindemiatoria_ and _corbes\r\nmessoriæ_ (as we our pots for strawberries) with the rind of this beech,\r\nnay, and vessels to preserve wine in, and that curiously wrought cup\r\nwhich the shepherd in the Bucolicks wagers withal, was engraven by\r\nAlcimedon upon the bark of this tree: And an happy age it seems:\r\n\r\n       ........No wars did men molest,\r\n    When only beechen-bowls were in request.{78:1}\r\n\r\nOf the thin _lamina_ or scale of this wood (as our cutlers call it) are\r\nmade scabards for swords, and band-boxes, superinduc’d with thin leather\r\nor paper, boxes for writings, hat-cases, and formerly book-covers. I\r\nwonder we cannot split it our selves, but send into other countries for\r\nsuch trifles. In the cavities of these trees, bees much delight to hive\r\nthemselves: Yet for all this, you would not wonder to hear me deplore\r\nthe so frequent use of this wood, if you did consider that the industry\r\nof France furnishes that country for all domestick utensils with\r\nexcellent wallnut; a material infinitely preferable to the best beech,\r\nwhich is indeed good only for shade and for the fire, as being brittle,\r\nand exceedingly obnoxious to the worm, where it lies either dry, or wet\r\nand dry, as has been noted; but being put ten days in water, it will\r\nexceedingly resist the worm: To which, as I said, it is so obnoxious,\r\nthat I wish the use of it were by a law, prohibited all joyners,\r\ncabinet-makers, and such as furnish tables, chairs, bed-steads, cofers,\r\nscrews, &c. They have a way to black and polish it, so as to render it\r\nlike ebony, and with a mixture of soot and urine, imitate the wall-nut;\r\nbut as the colour does not last, so nor does the wood it self (for I can\r\nhardly call it timber) soon after the worm has seiz’d it, unless one\r\nspunge and imbibe it well with the oyl of spike, where they have made\r\nholes. Ricciolus indeed much commends it for oars; and some say, that\r\nthe vast Argo was built of the _fagus_, a good part of it at least, as\r\nwe learn out of Apollonius; this will admit of interpretation; the\r\n_fagus_ yet by Claudian is mentioned with the alder,\r\n\r\n    So he that to export o’re sea his wares\r\n    A vessel builds, and to expose prepares\r\n    His life to storms, first beech and elder cuts,\r\n    And measuring them, to various uses puts.{79:1}\r\n\r\nBut whilst we thus condemn the timber, we must not omit to praise the\r\nmast, which fats our swine and deer, and hath in some families even\r\nsupported men with bread: Chios indured a memorable siege by the benefit\r\nof this mast; and in some parts of France they now grind the buck in\r\nmills: It affords a sweet oyl, which the poor people eat most willingly:\r\nBut there is yet another benefit which this tree presents us; that its\r\nvery leaves (which make a natural and most agreeable canopy all the\r\nsummer) being gathered about the fall, and somewhat before they are much\r\nfrostbitten, afford the best and easiest mattrasses in the world to lay\r\nunder our quilts instead of straw; because, besides their tenderness and\r\nloose lying together, they continue sweet for seven or eight years\r\nlong, before which time straw becomes musty and hard; they are thus used\r\nby divers persons of quality in Dauphine; and in Swizzerland I have\r\nsometimes lain on them to my great refreshment; so as of this tree it\r\nmay properly be said,\r\n\r\n    The wood’s an house; the leaves a bed.{80:1}\r\n\r\nBeing pruin’d it heals the scar immediately, and is not apt to put forth\r\nso soon again as other trees.\r\n\r\nThe stagnant water in the hollow-trees cures the most obstinate tetters,\r\nscabs, and scurfs, in man or beast, fomenting the part with it; and the\r\nleaves chew’d are wholsome for the gums and teeth, for which the very\r\nbuds, as they are in winter hardned and dried upon the twigs, make good\r\ntooth-pickers. Swine may be driven to mast about the end of August: But\r\nit is observ’d, that where they feed on’t before it be mature, it\r\nintoxicates them for a while; and that generally their fat is not so\r\ngood and solid, but drips away too soon. In the mean time, the kernels\r\nof the mast are greedily devour’d by squirels, mice, and above all, the\r\ndormice, who harbouring in the hollow-trees, grow so fat, that in some\r\ncountries abroad, they take infinite numbers of them, (I suppose) to\r\neat; and what relief they give thrushes, black-birds, feldefares and\r\nother birds, every body knows. See Mithiolus in _dioscord._ l. 1. of\r\nwhat they suffer in Carinthiæ, Carniola, and Itiria. Supplement to this\r\nTract. _vid._ Ray’s tom. III. Lib. XXV. Dendrologia Fago. tom.

The places it chiefly desires to\r\ngrow in are in cold hills, stiff ground, and in the barren and most\r\nexpos’d parts of woods. We have it no where more abounding in the south,\r\nthan in the woods of Hartfordshire; very few westward.\r\n\r\n2. Amongst other uses which it serves for, as mill-cogs, &c. (for which\r\nit excels either yew or crab) yoak-timber (whence of old, and for that\r\nit was as well flexible as tough, ’twas call’d ζυγία) heads of\r\nbeetles, stocks and handles of tools: It is likewise for the turners use\r\nexcellent; good fire-wood, where it burns like a candle, and was of old\r\nso employ’d;\r\n\r\n    _Carpinus tædas fissa facesque dabit._\r\n\r\n(For all which purposes its extream toughness and whiteness commends it\r\nto the husbandman.) Being planted in small fosses or trenches, at half a\r\nfoot interval, and in the single row, it makes the noblest and the\r\nstateliest hedges for long walks in gardens, or parks, of any tree\r\nwhatsoever whose leaves are deciduous, and forsake their branches in\r\nwinter; because it grows tall, and so sturdy, as not to be wronged by\r\nthe winds: Besides, it will furnish to the very foot of the stem, and\r\nflourishes with a glossie and polish’d verdure, which is exceeding\r\ndelightful, of long continuance, and of all other the harder woods, the\r\nspeediest grower; maintaining a slender, upright-stem, which does not\r\ncome to be bare and sticky in many years; it has yet this (shall I call\r\nit) infirmity, that keeping on its leaf till new ones thrust them off,\r\n’tis clad in russet all the winter long. That admirable _espalier_-hedge\r\nin the long middle walk of Luxemburgh garden at Paris (than which there\r\nis nothing more graceful) is planted of this tree; and so was that\r\ncradle, or close-walk, with that perplext canopy which lately covered\r\nthe seat in his Majesty’s Garden at Hampton-Court, and as now I hear,\r\nthey are planted in perfection at New-park, the delicious villa of the\r\nNoble Earl of Rochester, belonging once to a near kinsman of mine, who\r\nparted with it to K. Charles the First of Blessed Memory. These hedges\r\nare tonsile; but where they are maintain’d to fifteen or twenty foot\r\nheight (which is very frequent in the places before mention’d) they are\r\nto be cut, and kept in order with a syth of four foot long, and very\r\nlittle falcated; this is fix’d on a long sneed or streight handle, and\r\ndoes wonderfully expedite the trimming of these and the like hedges: An\r\noblong square, palisado’d with this plant, or the Flemish _ormus_, as is\r\nthat I am going to describe, and may be seen in that inexhaustible\r\nmagazine at Brompton Park (cultivated by those two industrious\r\nfellow-gardiners, Mr. London, and Mr. Wise) affords such an _umbraculum\r\nfrondium_, the most natural, proper station and convenience for the\r\nprotection of our orange-trees, myrtles, (and other rare perennials and\r\nexoticks) from the scorching darts of the sun, and heat of summer;\r\nplacing the cases, pots, &c. under this shelter, when either at the\r\nfirst peeping out of the winter concleave, or during the increasing heat\r\nof summer, they so are ranged and disposed, as to adorn a noble area of\r\na most magnificent paradisian dining-room to the top of hortulan pomp\r\nand bliss, superior to all the artificial furniture of the greatest\r\nprince’s court: Here the Indian narcissus, tuberoses, Japan-lillies,\r\njasmines, jonquills, lalaes, periclymena, roses, carnations, (with all\r\nthe pride of the _parter_) intermixt between the tree-cases, flowry\r\nvasas, busts and statues, entertain the eye, and breath their redolent\r\nodors and perfumes to the smell: The golden fruit and apples of\r\nHesperides, gratifie the taste, with the delicious annanas, affecting\r\nall the sensories; whilst the chearful ditties of _canorus_ birds,\r\nrecording their innocent _amours_ to the murmurs of the bubling\r\nfountain, delight the ear, and with the charming accents of the fair and\r\nvertuous sex, (preferable to all the admired composure of the most\r\nskilful musitians) join consort in hymns and hallelujahs to the\r\nbountiful and glorious Creator, who has left none of the senses, which\r\nhe has not gratify’d at once, with their most agreeable and proper\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Brompton: ’Tis not to be imagin’d what a surprizing\r\nscene, such a spacious _salone_, tapistried with the natural verdure of\r\nthe glittering foliage, present the spectator, and recompenses the toil\r\nof the ingenious planter; when after a little patience, he finds the\r\nslender plants, set but at five or six foot distance, (nor much more in\r\nheight, well prun’d and dress’d) ascend to an altitude sufficient to\r\nshade and defend his paradisian treasure without excluding the milder\r\ngleams of the glorious and radiant planet, with his cherishing\r\ninfluence, and kindly warmth, to all within the inclosure, refreshed\r\nwith the cooling and early dew, pregnant with the sweet exhalations\r\nwhich the indulgent mother and teeming earth sends up, to nourish and\r\nmaintain her numerous and tender off-spring.\r\n\r\nBut after all, let us not dwell here too long, whilst the inferences to\r\nbe derived from those tempting and temporary objects, prompt us to raise\r\nour contemplations a little on objects yet more worthy our noblest\r\nspeculations, and all our pains and curiosity, representing that happy\r\nstate above, namely, the cœlestial paradise: Let us, I say, suspend our\r\nadmiration a while, of these terrestrial gayeties, which are of so short\r\ncontinuance, and raise our thoughts from being too deeply immers’d and\r\nrooted in them, aspiring after those supernal, more lasting and glorious\r\nabodes, namely, a paradise; not like this of ours (with so much pains\r\nand curiosity) made with hands, but eternal in the heavens; where all\r\nthe trees are Trees of Life; the flowers all amaranths; all the plants\r\nperennial, ever verdant, ever pregnant; and where those who desire\r\nknowledge, may fully satiate themselves; taste freely of the fruit of\r\nthat tree, which cost the first gardiner and posterity so dear; and\r\nwhere the most voluptuous inclinations to the allurements of the senses,\r\nmay take, and eat, and still be innocent; no forbidden fruit; no serpent\r\nto deceive; none to be deceived.\r\n\r\nHail, O hail then, and welcome, you bless’d elyziums, where a new state\r\nof things expects us; where all the pompous and charming delights that\r\ndetain us here a while, shall be changed into real and substantial\r\nfruitions, eternal springs, and pleasure intellectual, becoming the\r\ndignity of our nature!\r\n\r\nI beg no pardon for the application, but deplore my no better use of it,\r\nand that whilst I am thus upon the wing, I must now descend so soon\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nOf all the foresters, this preserves it self best from the bruttings of\r\ndeer, and therefore to be kindly entertain’d in parks: But the reason\r\nwhy with us, we rarely find them ample and spreading, is, that our\r\nhusbandman suffers too large and grown a lop, before he cuts them off,\r\nwhich leaves such ghastly wounds, as often proves exitial to the tree,\r\nor causes it to grow deform’d and hollow, and of little worth but for\r\nthe fire; whereas, were they oftener taken off, when the lops were\r\nyounger, though they did not furnish so great wood, yet the continuance\r\nand flourishing of the tree, would more than recompence it. For this\r\ncause,\r\n\r\n3. They very frequently plant a clump of these trees before the entries\r\nof most of the great towns in Germany, to which they apply timber-frames\r\nfor convenience, and the people to sit and solace in. _Scamozzi_ the\r\narchitect, says, that in his time he found one whose branches extended\r\nseventy foot in breadth; this was at Vuimfen near the Necker, belonging\r\nto the Duke of Wirtemberg: But that which I find planted before the\r\ngates of Strasburgh, is a _platanus_, and a lime-tree growing hard by\r\none another, in which is erected a _Pergolo_ eight foot from the ground,\r\nof fifty foot wide, having ten arches of twelve foot height, all shaded\r\nwith their foliage; and there is besides this, an over-grown oak, which\r\nhas an arbour in it of sixty foot diameter: Hear we _Rapinus_ describe\r\nthe use of the horn-beam for these and other elegancies.\r\n\r\n    In walks the horn-beam stands, or in a maze\r\n    Through thousand self-entangling labyrinths strays:\r\n    So clasp the branches lopp’d on either side,\r\n    As though an alley did two walls divide:\r\n    This beauty found, order did next adorn\r\n    The boughs into a thousand figures shorn,\r\n    Which pleasing objects weariness betray’d,\r\n    Your feet into a wilderness convey’d.\r\n    Nor better leaf on twining arbor spread,\r\n    Against the scorching sun to shield your head.{86:1}\r\n\r\n    Evelyn, _Rapin._\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n{86:1}\r\n\r\n    In tractus longos facilis tibi carpinus ibit,\r\n    Mille per errores, indeprehensosque recessus,\r\n    Et molles tendens secto ceu pariete ramos,\r\n    Præbebit viridem diverso è margine scenam.\r\n    Primus honos illi quondam, post additus ordo est,\r\n    Attonsæque comæ, & formis quæsita voluptas\r\n    Innumeris, furtoque viæ, obliquoque recessu:\r\n    In tractus acta est longos & opaca vireta.\r\n    Quinetiam egregiæ tendens umbracula frondis\r\n    Temperat ardentes ramis ingentibus æstus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n_Of the Ash._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Fraxinus_ the ash, is with us reputed male and female, the one\r\naffecting the higher grounds; the other the plains, of a whiter wood,\r\nand rising many times to a prodigious stature; so as in forty years from\r\nthe key, an ash hath been sold for thirty pounds sterling: And I have\r\nbeen credibly inform’d, that one person hath planted so much of this one\r\nsort of timber in his life time, as hath been valued worth fifty\r\nthousand pounds to be bought. These are pretty encouragements, for a\r\nsmall and pleasant industry. That there is a lower, and more knotty\r\nsort, every husbandman can distinguish.\r\n\r\n2. The keys or toungs being gathered from a young thriving tree when\r\nthey begin to fall (which is about the end of October, and the ensuing\r\nmonth) are to be laid to dry, and then sowed any time betwixt that and\r\nChristmas; but not altogether so deep as your somer masts: Thus they do\r\nin Spain, from whence it were good to procure some of the keys from\r\ntheir best trees: A very narrow seminary will be sufficient to store a\r\nwhole country: They will lie a full year in the ground before they\r\nappear; therefore you must carefully fence them all that time, and have\r\npatience: But if you would make a considerable wood of them at once,\r\ndig, or plow a parcel of ground, as you would prepare it for corn, and\r\nwith the corn, especially oats, (or what other grain you think fittest)\r\nsow also good store of keys, some crab-kernels, &c. amongst them: Take\r\noff your crop of corn, or seed in its season, and the next year\r\nfollowing, it will be cover’d with young ashes, which will be fit either\r\nto stand (which I prefer) or be transplanted for divers years after; and\r\nthese you will find to be far better than any you can gather out of the\r\nwoods (especially suckers, which are worth nothing) being removed at one\r\nfoot stature (the sooner the better); for an ash of two years thus taken\r\nout of the nursery, shall outstrip one of ten, taken out of the hedge;\r\nprovided you defend them well from cattel, which are exceedingly\r\nlicorish after their tops: The reason of this hasty transplanting, is to\r\nprevent their obstinate and deep rooting; _tantus amor terræ_\r\n............. which makes them hard to be taken up when they grow older,\r\nand that being removed, they take no great hold till the second year,\r\nafter which, they come away amain; yet I have planted them of five and\r\nsix inches diameter, which have thriven as well as the smaller wands.\r\nYou may accelerate their springing by laying the keys in sand, and some\r\nmoist fine earth s. s. s. but lay them not too thick, or double, and in\r\na cover’d, though airy place for a winter, before you sow them; and the\r\nsecond year they will come away mainly; so you weed, trim and cleanse\r\nthem. Cut not his head at all (which being young, is pithy) nor, by any\r\nmeans the fibrous part of the roots; only that down-right, or taproot\r\n(which gives our husbandmen so much trouble in drawing) is to be totally\r\nabated: But this work ought to be in the increase of October, or\r\nNovember, and not in the Spring. We are (as I told you) willing to spare\r\nhis head rather than the side branches (which whilst young, may be cut\r\nclose) because being yet young, it is but of a spungy substance; but\r\nbeing once well fixed, you may cut him as close to the earth as you\r\nplease; it will cause him to shoot prodigiously, so as in a few years to\r\nbe fit for pike-staves; whereas if you take him wild out of the forest,\r\nyou must of necessity strike off the head, which much impairs it.\r\nHedgerow ashes may the oftner be decapitated, and shew their heads again\r\nsooner than other trees so us’d. Young ashes are sometimes in winter\r\nfrost-burnt, black as coals, and then to use the knife is seasonable,\r\nthough they do commonly recover of themselves slowly. In South-Spain,\r\n(where, as we said, are the best) after the first dressing, they let\r\nthem grow till they are so big, as being cleft into four parts, each\r\npart is sufficient to make a pike-staff: I am told there is a Flemish\r\nash planted by the Dutchmen in Lincolnshire, which in six years grows to\r\nbe worth twenty shillings the tree; but I am not assur’d whether it be\r\nthe ash or abeele; either of them were, upon this account, a worthy\r\nencouragement, if at least the latter can be thought to bear that price,\r\nwhich I much question: From these low cuttings come our ground-ashes, so\r\nmuch sought after for arbours, espaliers, and other pole-works: They\r\nwill spring in abundance, and may be reduced to one for a standard-tree,\r\nor for timber, if you design it; for thus hydra-like, a ground-cut-ash,\r\n\r\n    By havock, wounds and blows,\r\n    More lively and luxuriant grows.{89:1}\r\n\r\nAsh will be propagated from a bough slipt off with some of the old wood,\r\na little before the bud swells, but with difficulty by layers. Such as\r\nthey reserve for spears in Spain, they keep shrip’d up close to the\r\nstem, and plant them in close order, and moister places. These they cut\r\nabove the knot (for the least nodosity spoils all) in the decrease of\r\nJanuary, which were of the latest for us: It is reported that the ash\r\nwill not only receive its own kind, but graff, or be inoculated with the\r\npear and apple, but to what improvement I know not.\r\n\r\n3. It is by no means convenient to plant ash in plow-lands; for the\r\nroots will be obnoxious to the coulter; and the shade of the tree is\r\nmalignant both to corn and grass, when the head and branches over-drip\r\nand emaciate ’em; but in hedge-rows and plumps, they will thrive\r\nexceedingly, where they may be dispos’d at nine or ten foot distance,\r\nand sometimes nearer: But in planting of a whole wood of several kinds\r\nof trees for timber, every third set at least, would be an ash. The best\r\nash delights in the best land (which it will soon impoverish) yet grows\r\nin any; so it be not over-stiff, wet, and approaching to the marshy,\r\nunless it be first well drain’d: By the banks of sweet, and crystal\r\nrivers and streams, I have observ’d them to thrive infinitely. One may\r\nobserve as manifest a difference in the timber of ashes, as of the oak;\r\nmuch more than is found in any one kind of elm, _cœteris paribus_: For\r\nso the ground-ash (like the oak) much excels a bough, or branch of the\r\nsame bulk, for strength and toughness; and in yet farther emulation of\r\nthe oak, it has been known to prove as good and lasting timber for\r\nbuilding, nay, preferr’d before it, where there has been plenty of oak;\r\nvast difference there is also in the strength of ground, and quarter’d\r\nash: ’Tis likewise remarkable that the ash, like the cork-tree, grows\r\nwhen the bark is as it were quite peel’d off, as has been observ’d in\r\nseveral forests, where the deer have bared them as far as they could\r\nclimb: Some ash is curiously camleted and vein’d, I say, so differently\r\nfrom other timber, that our skilful cabinet-makers prize it equal with\r\nebony, and give it the name of green ebony, which the customer pays well\r\nfor; and when our wood-men light upon it, they may make what money they\r\nwill of it: But to bring it to that curious lustre, so as ’tis hardly\r\nto be distinguished from the most curiously diaper’d olive, they varnish\r\ntheir work with the china-varnish, (hereafter described) which\r\ninfinitely excels linseed-oyl, that Cardan so commends, speaking of this\r\nroot. The truth is, the _bruscum_ and _molluscum_ to be frequently found\r\nin this wood, is nothing inferior to that of maple, (of which hereafter)\r\nbeing altogether as exquisitely diaper’d, and wav’d like the gamahes of\r\nAchates; an eminent example of divers strange figures of fish, men and\r\nbeasts, Dr. Plott speaks of to be found in a dining-table made of an old\r\nash, standing in a gentleman’s house somewhere in Oxfordshire: Upon\r\nwhich is mention’d that of Jacobus Gaffarellus, in his book of\r\n_Unheard-of Curiosities_; namely of a tree found in Holland, which being\r\ncleft, had in the several slivers, the figures of a chalice, a priest’s\r\nalbe, his stole, and several other pontifical vestments: Of this sort\r\nwas the elm growing at Middle-Aston in Oxfordshire, a block of which\r\nwood being cleft, there came out a piece so exactly resembling a\r\nshoulder of veal, that it was worthy to be reckon’d among the\r\ncuriosities of this nature.\r\n\r\n4. The use of ash is (next to that of the oak it self) one of the most\r\nuniversal: It serves the soldier ............ & _Fraxinus utilis\r\nhastis_, and heretofore the scholar, who made use of the inner bark to\r\nwrite on, before the invention of paper, &c. The carpenter,\r\nwheel-wright, cart-wright, for ploughs, axle-trees, wheel-rings,\r\nharrows, bulls, oares, the best blocks for pullies and sheffs, as seamen\r\nname them; for drying herrings, no wood like it, and the bark for the\r\ntanning of nets; and, like the elm, for the same property (of not being\r\nso apt to split and scale) excellent for tenons and mortaises: Also for\r\nthe cooper, turner, and thatcher: Nothing like it for our garden\r\npalisade-hedges, hop-yards, poles, and spars, handles, stocks for tools,\r\nspade-trees, &c. In sum, the husbandman cannot be without the ash for\r\nhis carts, ladders, and other tackling, from the pike to the plow,\r\nspear, and bow; for of ash were they formerly made, and therefore\r\nreckon’d amongst those woods, which after long tension, has a natural\r\nspring, and recovers its position; so as in peace and war it is a wood\r\nin highest request: In short, so useful and profitable is this tree,\r\n(next to the oak) that every prudent lord of a mannor, should employ one\r\nacre of ground, with ash or acorns, to every 20 acres of other land;\r\nsince in as many years, it would be more worth than the land it self.\r\nThere is extracted an oyl from the ash, by the process on other woods,\r\nwhich is excellent to recover the hearing, some drops of it being\r\ndistill’d warm into the ears; and for the _caries_ or rot of the bones,\r\ntooth-ach, pains in the kidneys, and spleen, the anointing therewith is\r\nmost soveraign. Some have us’d the saw-dust of this wood instead of\r\n_guiacum_, with success. The chymists exceedingly commend the seed of\r\nash to be an admirable remedy for the stone: But (whether by the power\r\nof magick or nature, I determine not) I have heard it affirm’d with\r\ngreat confidence, and upon experience, that the rupture to which many\r\nchildren are obnoxious, is healed, by passing the infant thro’ a wide\r\ncleft made in the hole or stem of a growing ash-tree, thro’ which the\r\nchild is to be made pass; and then carried a second time round the ash,\r\ncaused to repass the same aperture again, that the cleft of the tree\r\nsuffer’d to close and coalesce, as it will, the rupture of the child,\r\nbeing carefully bound up, will not only abate, but be perfectly cur’d.\r\nThe _manna_ of Calabria is found to exsude out of the leaves and boughs\r\nof this tree, during the hot summer-months. Lastly, the white and rotten\r\ndotard part composes a ground for our gallants sweet-powder, and the\r\ntrunchions make the third sort of the most durable coal, and is (of all\r\nother) the sweetest of our forest-fuelling, and the fittest for ladies\r\nchambers, it will burn even whilst it is green, and may be reckoned\r\namongst the ἄκαπνα ξύλα. To conclude, the very dead leaves afford\r\n(like those of the elm) relief to our cattle in winter; and there is a\r\ndwarf-sort in France, (if in truth it be not, as I suspect, our\r\nwitchen-tree) whose berries feed the poor people in scarce years; but it\r\nbears no keys, like to ours, which being pickled tender, afford a\r\ndelicate salading. But the shade of the ash is not to be endur’d,\r\nbecause the leaves produce a noxious insect; and for displaying\r\nthemselves so very late, and falling very early, not to be planted for\r\numbrage or ornament; especially near the garden, since (besides their\r\npredatious roots) the leaves dropping with so long a stalk, are drawn by\r\nclusters into the worm-holes, which foul the allies with their keys, and\r\nsuddenly infect the ground. Note, that the season for felling of this\r\ntree must be when the sap is fully at rest; for if you cut it down too\r\nearly, or over-late in the year, it will be so obnoxious to the worm, as\r\ngreatly to prejudice the timber; therefore to be sure, fell not till the\r\nthree mid-winter months, beginning about November: But in lopping of\r\npollards, (as of soft woods) Mr. Cook advises it should be towards the\r\nSpring, and that you do not suffer the lops to grow too great: Also,\r\nthat so soon as a pollard comes to be considerably hollow at the head,\r\nyou suddenly cut it down, the body decaying more than the head is worth:\r\nThe same he pronounces of taller ashes, and where the wood-peckers make\r\nholes (who constantly indicate their being faulty) to fell it in the\r\nWinter. I am astonish’d at the universal confidence of some, that a\r\nserpent will rather creep into the fire, than over a twig of ash; this\r\nis an old imposture of{94:1} Pliny’s, who either took it up upon trust,\r\nor we mistake the tree. Other species, see _Ray Dendrolog._ t. III. lib.\r\nXXX. p. 95. _De fraxino_, t. II. p. 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n{89:1}\r\n\r\n    Per damna, per cædes, ab ipso\r\n    Ducit opes animúmque ferro.\r\n\r\n    _Hor._\r\n\r\n{94:1} V. _Churasium_, &c. _de viperis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n_Of the Chesnut._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The next is the chesnut, [_castanea_] of which Pliny reckons many\r\nkinds, especially about Tarentum and Naples; Janus Cornarius, upon that\r\nof Aetius, (_verbo_ Δρῦς) speaks of the Lopimi, as a nobler kind, such\r\nas the _Euboicæ_, which the Italians call _maroni_, _quasi castaneæ\r\nmaris_; but we commend those of Portugal or Bayonne, chusing the\r\nlargest, brown, and most ponderous for fruit, such as Pliny calls\r\n_coctivæ_, but the lesser ones to raise for timber. They are produc’d\r\nbest by sowing and setting; previous to which, let the nuts be first\r\nspread to sweat, then cover them in sand; a month being past, plunge\r\nthem in water, reject the swimmers; being dry’d, for thirty days more,\r\nsand them again, and to the water-ordeal as before. Being thus treated\r\ntill the beginning of Spring, or in November, set them as you would do\r\nbeans; and as some practise it, drench’d for a night or more, in new\r\nmilk; but without half this preparation, they need only be put into the\r\nholes with the point upmost, as you plant tulips; Pliny will tell you\r\nthey come not up, unless four or five be pil’d together in a hole; but\r\nthat is false, if they be good, as you may presume all those to be which\r\npass this examination; nor will any of them fail: But being come up,\r\nthey thrive best unremoved, making a great stand for at least two years\r\nupon every transplanting; yet if needs you must alter their station, let\r\nit be done about November, and that into a light friable ground, or\r\nmoist gravel, however they will grow even in clay, sand, and all mixed\r\nsoils, upon exposed and bleak places, and the pendent declivities of\r\nhills to the north, in dry airy places, and sometimes (tho’ not so well)\r\nnear marshes and waters; but they affect no other compost, save what\r\ntheir own leaves afford them, and are more patient of cold than heat: As\r\nfor their sowing in the nursery, treat them as you are taught in the\r\nwall-nut.\r\n\r\n2. If you design to set them in Winter, or Autumn, I counsel you to\r\ninterr them within their husks, which being every way arm’d, are a good\r\nprotection against the mouse, and a providential integument. Pliny l.\r\n15. c. 23. from this natural guard, concludes them to be excellent food,\r\nand doubtless Cæsar thought so, when he transported them from Sardis\r\nfirst into Italy, whence they were propagated into France, and thence\r\namong us; another encouragement to make such experiments out of foreign\r\ncountries. Some sow them confusedly in the furrow like the acorn, and\r\ngovern them as the oak; but then would the ground be broken up ’twixt\r\nNovember and February; and when they spring, be clensed, and thinn’d two\r\nfoot asunder, after two years growth: Likewise may copses of chesnuts be\r\nwonderfully increased and thickned, by laying the tender and young\r\nbranches; but such as spring from the nuts and marrons, are best of all,\r\nand will thrive exceedingly, if (being let stand without removing) the\r\nground be stirr’d, and loosened about their roots, for two or three of\r\nthe first years, and the superfluous wood prun’d away; and indeed for\r\ngood trees, they should be shrip’d up after the first year’s removal;\r\nthey also shoot into gallant poles from a felled stem: Thus will you\r\nhave a copse ready for a felling, within eight years, which (besides\r\nmany other uses) will yield you incomparable poles for any work of the\r\ngarden, vineyard or hopyard, till the next cutting: And if the tree like\r\nthe ground, will in ten or twelve years grow to a kind of timber, and\r\nbear plentiful fruit.\r\n\r\n3. I have seen many chesnut-trees transplanted as big as my arm, their\r\nheads cut off at five and six foot height; but they came on at leisure:\r\nIn such plantations, and all others for avenues, you may set them from\r\nthirty to ten foot distance, though they will grow much nearer, and\r\nshoot into poles, if (being tender) you cultivate them like the ash, the\r\nnature of whose shade it resembles, since nothing affects much to grow\r\nunder it: Some husbands tell me, that the young chesnut-trees should not\r\nbe pruned or touched with any knife or edge-tool, for the first three or\r\nfour years, but rather cropp’d or broken off, which I leave to farther\r\nexperience; however, many forbear to top them, when they transplant.\r\n\r\n4. The chesnut being graffed in the wallnut, oak, or beech, (I have\r\nbeen told) will come exceeding fair, and produce incomparable fruit; for\r\nthe wallnut, and chesnut in each other, it is probable; but I have not\r\nas yet made a full attempt; they also speak of inoculating cherries in\r\nthe chesnut-stock for a later fruit. In the mean time, I wish we did\r\nmore universally propagate the horse-chesnut, which being easily\r\nincreas’d from layers, grows into a good standard, and bears a most\r\nglorious flower, even in our cold country: This tree (so call’d, for the\r\ncure of horses broken-winded, and other cattel of coughs) is now all the\r\nmode for the avenues to their countrey palaces in France, as appears by\r\nthe late Superintendent’s plantation at Vaux. It was first brought from\r\nConstantinople to Vienna, thence into Italy, and so France; but to us\r\nfrom the Levant more immediately, and flourishes so well, and grows so\r\ngoodly a tree in competent time, that by this alone, we might have ample\r\nencouragement to denizen other strangers amongst us. One inconvenience\r\nto which this beautiful tree is obnoxious, is that it does not well\r\nresist impetuous and stormy winds, without damage.\r\n\r\n5. The chesnut is (next the oak) one of the most sought after by the\r\ncarpenter and joyner: It hath formerly built a good part of our ancient\r\nhouses in the city of London, as does yet appear. I had once a very\r\nlarge barn near the city, fram’d intirely of this timber: And certainly\r\nthey grew not far off; probably in some woods near the town: For in that\r\ndescription of London, written by Fitz-Stephens, in the reign of Hen.\r\nII. he speaks of a very noble and large forest which grew on the Boreal\r\npart of it; _proxime_ (says he) _patet foresta ingens, saltus nemorosi\r\nferarum, latebræ cervorum, damarum, aprorum, & taurorum silvestrium,\r\n&c._ A very goodly thing it seems, and as well stor’d with all sorts of\r\ngood timber, as with venison and all kind of chase; and yet some will\r\nnot allow it a free-born of this island; but of that I make little\r\ndoubt. The chesnut affords the best stakes and poles for palisades,\r\npedament for vine-props and hops, as I said before: Also for mill-timber\r\nand water-works, or when it may lie buried; but if water touch the roots\r\nof the growing trees, it spoils both fruit and timber: ’Tis likewise\r\nobserved, that this tree is so prevalent against cold, that where they\r\nstand, they defend other plantations from the injuries of the severest\r\nfrosts: I am sure being planted in hedge-rows, & _circa agrorum\r\nitinera_, or for avenues to our country-houses, they are a magnificent\r\nand royal ornament. This timber also does well (if kept dry) for\r\ncolumns, tables, chests, chairs, stools, bedsteads; for tubs, and\r\nwine-casks, which it preserves with the least tincture of the wood of\r\nany whatsoever: If the timber be dipp’d in scalding oyl, and well\r\npitch’d, it becomes extreamly durable; but otherwise I cannot celebrate\r\nthe tree for its sincerity, it being found that (contrary to the oak) it\r\nwill make a fair shew outwardly, when ’tis all decay’d, and rotten\r\nwithin; but this is in some sort recompenc’d, if it be true, that the\r\nbeams made of chesnut-tree have this property, that being somewhat\r\nbrittle, they give warning, and premonish the danger by a certain\r\ncrackling which it makes; so as ’tis said to have frighted those out of\r\nthe Baths at Antandro, whose roof was laid with this material; but which\r\nPliny says, was of hazle, very unlike it. Formerly they made\r\nconsultatory staves of this tree; and the variegated rods which Jacob\r\npeel’d to lay in the troughs, and impress a fancy in his\r\nfather-in-law’s conceiving ewes, were of this material. The coals are\r\nexcellent for the smith, being soon kindled, and as soon extinguisht;\r\nbut the ashes of chesnut-wood are not convenient to make a lee with,\r\nbecause it is observ’d to stain the linnen. As for the fruit, ’tis\r\nbetter to beat it down from the tree, some little time before they fall\r\noff themselves; thus they will the better keep, or else you must\r\nsmoke-dry them. But we give that fruit to our swine in England, which is\r\namongst the delicacies of princes in other countries; and being of the\r\nlarger nut, is a lusty and masculine food for rusticks at all times; and\r\nof better nourishment for husbandmen than coal, and rusty bacon; yea, or\r\nbeans to boot, instead of which, they boil them in Italy with their\r\nbacon; and in Virgil’s time, they eat them with milk and cheese. The\r\nbest tables in France and Italy make them a service, eating them with\r\nsalt, in wine, or juice of lemmon and sugar; being first roasted in\r\nembers on the chaplet; and doubtless we might propagate their use\r\namongst our common people, (as of old the Βαλανοφάγοι) being a food\r\nso cheap, and so lasting. In Italy they also boil them in wine, and then\r\nsmoke them a little; these they call _anseri_ or geese, I know not why:\r\nThose of Piemont add fennel, cinnamon and nutmeg to their wine, if in\r\nwater, mollify them with the vapour only; but first they peel them.\r\nOthers macerate them in rose-water. The bread of the flower is exceeding\r\nnutritive; ’tis a robust food, and makes women well complexion’d, as I\r\nhave read in a good author: They also make fritters of chesnut-flower,\r\nwhich they wet with rose-water, and sprinkle with grated _parmegiano_,\r\nand so fry them in fresh butter, a delicate: How we here use them in\r\nstew’d-meats, and beatille-pies, our French-cooks teach us; and this is\r\nin truth the very best use of their fruit, and very commendable; for it\r\nis found that the eating of them raw, or in bread (as they do much about\r\nLimosin) is apt to swell the belly, though without any other\r\ninconvenience that I can learn, and yet some condemn them as dangerous\r\nfor such as are subject to the gravel in the kidneys, and however cook’d\r\nand prepar’d, flatulent, offensive to the head and stomach, and those\r\nwho are subject to the cholick. The best way to preserve them, is to\r\nkeep them in earthen vessels in a cold place; some lay them in a\r\nsmoke-loft, others in dry barly-straw, others in sand, &c. The leaves of\r\nthe chesnut-tree make very wholsom mattresses to lie on, and they are\r\ngood littier for cattel: But those leafy-beds, for the crackling noise\r\nthey make when one turns upon them, the French call _licts de\r\nParliament_: Lastly, the flower of chesnuts made into an electuary, and\r\neaten with hony fasting, is an approved remedy against spitting blood,\r\nand the cough; and a decoction of the rind of the tree, tinctures hair\r\nof a golden colour, esteem’d a beauty in some countries: Other species,\r\nv. Ray, _Dendrolog._ T. III, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n_Of the Wallnut._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Juglans, quasi Jovis glans_, the{101:1} wall or welch-nut (though no\r\nwhere growing of it self, some say, in Europe) is of several sorts;\r\nMonsieur Rencaume (of the French Academy) reckons nine; the soft-shell\r\nand the hard, the whiter and the blacker grain: This black bears the\r\nworst nut, but the timber much to be preferred, and we might propagate\r\nmore of them if we were careful to procure them out of Virginia, where\r\nthey abound and bear a squarer nut, of all other the most beautiful, and\r\nbest worth planting; indeed had we store of these, we should soon\r\ndespise the rest; yet those of Grenoble come in the next place, and are\r\nmuch priz’d by our cabinet-makers: In all events, be sure to plant from\r\nyoung and thriving trees, bearing full and plump kernels. It is said\r\nthat the walnut-kernel wrap’d in its own leaf, being carefully taken out\r\nof its shell, brings a nut without shell, but this is a trifle; the best\r\nway to elevate them, is to set them as you do the chesnut, being planted\r\nof the nut, or set at the distance you would have him stand; for which\r\nthey may be prepar’d by beating them off the tree (as was prescribed of\r\nthe chesnut) some days before they quit the branches of themselves, and\r\nkept in their husks, or without them, till Spring, or by bedding them\r\n(being dry) in sand, or good earth, till March or earlier, from the time\r\nthey fell, or were beaten off the tree: Or if before, they be set with\r\nhusk and all upon them; for the extream bitterness thereof is most\r\nexitial and deadly to worms; or it were good to strew some furzes\r\n(broken or chopp’d small) under the ground amongst them, to preserve\r\nthem from mice and rats, when their shells begin to wax tender;\r\nespecially if, as some, you supple them a little in warm cows milk; but\r\nbeing treated as before, you will find them already sprouted, and have\r\nneed only to be planted where they are to abide; because (as we said\r\nlong since) they are most impatient of transplanting: But if there be an\r\nabsolute necessity of removing, let your tree never be above four years\r\nold, and then by no means touch the head with your knife, nor cut away\r\nso much as the very top-root, being so old, if you can well dispose of\r\nit, since being of a pithy and hollow substance, the least diminution,\r\nor bruise, will greatly endanger the killing: But see here what we have\r\nsaid of the chesnut. I have been told, that the very tops, and palish\r\nbuds of this tree, when it first sprouts, though as late as April, will\r\ntake hold of the ground, and grow to an incredible improvement; but\r\nfirst they steep them in milk and saffron; but this attempt did not\r\nsucceed with us, yet it will be propagated by a branch slipp’d off with\r\nsome of the old wood, and set in February: An industrious and very\r\nexperienc’d husbandman told me, that if they be transplanted as big as\r\nones middle, it may be done safer than when younger; I do only report\r\nit: What they hint of putting a tile-shard under the nuts when first\r\nset, to divaricate and spread the roots (which are otherwise apt to\r\npenetrate very deep) I like well enough; ’tis certain they will receive\r\ntheir own cyons being graffed, and that it does improve their fruit.\r\nThe best compost is the strewing of ashes at the foot of the trees, the\r\nsalt whereof being washed into the earth, is the best dressing, whilst\r\nthe juice of the fallen leaves, though it kill the worm, is noxious to\r\nthe root. This tree does not refuse to thrive even among others, and in\r\ngreat woods, provided you shrip up the collateral arms.\r\n\r\n2. The walnut delights in a dry, sound and rich land; especially if it\r\nincline to a feeding chalk, or marle; and where it may be protected from\r\nthe cold (though it affect cold rather than extream heat) as in great\r\npits, valleys and high-way sides; also in stony-grounds, if loamy, and\r\non hills, especially chalky; likewise in corn-fields: Thus Burgundy\r\nabounds with them, where they stand in the midst of goodly wheat-lands,\r\nat sixty, and an hundred foot distance; and it is so far from hurting\r\nthe crop, that they look on them as a great preserver, by keeping the\r\ngrounds warm; nor do the roots hinder the plow. Whenever they fell a\r\ntree (which is only the old and decayed) they always plant a young one\r\nnear him; and in several places twixt Hanaw and Francfort in Germany, no\r\nyoung farmer whatsoever is permitted to marry a wife, till he bring\r\nproof that he hath planted, and is a father of such a stated number of\r\nwalnut-trees, as the law is inviolably observed to this day, for the\r\nextraordinary benefit which this tree affords the inhabitants: And in\r\ntruth, were this timber in greater plenty amongst us, we should have far\r\nbetter utensils of all sorts for our houses, as chairs, stools,\r\nbedsteads, tables, wainscot, cabinets, &c. instead of the more vulgar\r\nbeech, subject to the worm, weak, and unsightly; but which to\r\ncounterfeit, and deceive the unwary, they wash over with a decoction\r\nmade of the green-husks of walnuts, &c. I say, had we store of this\r\nmaterial, especially of the Virginian, we should find an incredible\r\nimprovement in the more stable furniture of our houses, as in the first\r\nfrugal and better days of Rome, when\r\n\r\n    Tables made here at home, those times beheld,\r\n    Of our own wood, for that same purpose fell’d,\r\n    Old walnut blown down, when the wind set east.{104:1}\r\n\r\n    Sir R. Stapylton.\r\n\r\nFor if it had been cut in that season, it would not have prov’d so\r\nsound, as we shew in our chapter of felling. It is certain, that the\r\n_mensæ nucinæ_, were once in price even before the _citrin_, as Strabo\r\nnotes; and nothing can be more beautiful than some planks and works\r\nwhich I have beheld of it, especially that which comes from Grenoble, of\r\nall other the most beautiful and esteemed.\r\n\r\n3. They render most graceful avenues to our countrey dwellings, and do\r\nexcellently near hedge-rows; but had need be planted, at forty or fifty\r\nfoot interval, for they affect to spread both their roots and branches.\r\nThe _Bergstras_ (which extends from Heidelberg to Darmstadt) is all\r\nplanted with walnuts; for so by another ancient law, the borderers were\r\nobliged to nurse up, and take care of them; and that chiefly, for their\r\nornament and shade; so as a man may ride for many miles about that\r\ncountrey under a continued arbour, or close-walk; the traveller both\r\nrefreshed with the fruit and the shade, which some have causelesly\r\ndefam’d for its ill effects on the head, for which the fruit is a\r\nspecifique and a notable signature; although I deny not, but the scent\r\nof the fallen leaves, when they begin to be damp’d with lying, may emit\r\nsomewhat a heady steam, which to some has prov’d noxious; but not whilst\r\nthey were fresh, and lively upon the trees. How would such publick\r\nplantations improve the glory and wealth of a nation! But where shall we\r\nfind the spirits among our countreymen? Yes, I will adventure to\r\ninstance in those plantations of Sir Richard Stidolph, upon the downs\r\nnear Lether-head in Surrey; Sir Robert Clayton at Morden near Godstone\r\n(once belonging to Sir John Evelyn) and so about Cassaulton, where many\r\nthousands of these trees do celebrate the industry of the owners, and\r\nwill certainly reward it with infinite improvement, as I am assured they\r\ndo in part already, and that very considerably; besides the ornament\r\nwhich they afford to those pleasant tracts, for some miles in\r\ncircumference. There was lately (and for ought I know is yet) an avenue\r\nof four leagues in length, and 50 paces breadth, planted with young\r\noaklings, as strait as a line, from the city of Utrecht to Amersfort,\r\naffording a most goodly prospect; which minds me of what Sorbiere tells\r\nin a sceptical discourse to Monsieur de Martel, speaking of the\r\nreadiness of the people in Holland to furnish and maintain whatsoever\r\nmay conduce to the publick ornament, as well as convenience; that their\r\nplantations of these and the like trees, even in their very roads and\r\ncommon highways, are better preserv’d and entertain’d (as I my self have\r\nlikewise been often an eye-witness) than those about the houses and\r\ngardens of pleasure belonging to the nobles and gentry of most other\r\ncountries: And in effect it is a most ravishing object, to behold their\r\namenities in this particular: With us, says he (speaking of France) they\r\nmake a jest at such political ordinances, by ruining these publick and\r\nuseful ornaments, if haply some more prudent magistrate do at any time\r\nintroduce them. Thus in the reign of Henry the Fourth, (during the\r\nsuperintendency of Monsieur de Sulli) there was a resolution of adorning\r\nall the highways of France with elms, &c. but the rude and mischievous\r\npeasants did so hack, steal and destroy what they had begun, that they\r\nwere forced to desist from the thorough prosecution of the design; so as\r\nthere is nothing more expos’d, wild, and less pleasant than the common\r\nroads of France for want of shade, and the decent limits which these\r\nsweet and divertissant plantations would have afforded. Not to omit that\r\npolitical use, as my Lord Bacon hints it, where he speaks of the statues\r\nand monuments of brave men, and such as had well deserv’d of the\r\npublick, erected by the Romans even in their highways; since doubtless,\r\nsuch noble and agreeable objects would exceedingly divert, entertain,\r\nand take off the minds and discourses of melancholy people, and pensive\r\ntravellers, who having nothing but the dull and enclosed ways to cast\r\ntheir eyes on, are but ill conversation to themselves, and others, and\r\ninstead of celebrating, censure their superiors. It is by a curious\r\nperson, and industrious friend of mine, observ’d, that the sap of this\r\ntree rises and descends with the sun’s diurnal course (which it visibly\r\nslackens in the night) and more plentifully at the root on the south\r\nside, though those roots cut on the north were larger, and less distant\r\nfrom the body of the tree; and not only distill’d from the ends, which\r\nwere next the stem, but from those which were cut off and separated,\r\nwhich was never observ’d to happen in the birch, or other sap-yielding\r\ntrees. {107:1} Mr. Oldenburg speaks of one of the present kings in\r\nEurope, who drinks much of the juice of this tree, and finds great\r\nbenefit thereby.\r\n\r\n4. What universal use the French make of the timber of this sole tree,\r\nfor domestic affairs, may be seen in every room both of poor and rich:\r\nIt is of singular account with the joyner, for the best grain’d, and\r\ncolour’d wainscot; with the gun-smith for stocks, for coach-wheels\r\nexcellent, and the bodies of coaches, (they make hoops and bows with it\r\nin New-England, for want of yew:) The drum-maker uses it for rimbs, the\r\ncabinet-maker for inlayings, especially the firm and close timber about\r\nthe roots, which is admirable for fleck’d and chambletted works, some\r\nwood especially, as that which we have from Bologne, New-England and\r\nVirginia, (where they are of three or four sorts, differing in their\r\nleaves, fruit and stature) very black of colour, and so admirably\r\nstreaked, as to represent natural flowers, landskips, and other fancies:\r\nTo render this the better-coloured, joyners put the boards into an oven\r\nafter the batch is forth, or lay them in a warm stable, and when they\r\nwork it, polish it over with its own oyl very hot, which makes it look\r\nblack and sleek, and the older it is, the more esteemable; but then it\r\nshould not be put in work till thoroughly seasoned, because it will\r\nshrink beyond expectation. It is only not good to confide in it much for\r\nbeams or joysts, because of its brittleness, of which yet, it has been\r\nobserv’d to give timely notice, as also the chesnut, by the crackling\r\nbefore it breaks. Besides the uses of the wood, the fruit with husk and\r\nall, when tender and very young, is for preserves (condited in separate\r\ndecoctions, by our curious ladies) also for food and oyl; of\r\nextraordinary use with the painter, in whites, and other delicate\r\ncolours, also for gold-size and varnish; and with this they polish\r\nwalking-staves, and other works which are wrought in with burning: For\r\nfood they fry with it in some places, and eat it instead of butter, in\r\nBerry, where they have little or none good; and therefore they plant\r\ninfinite numbers of these trees all over that countrey: The use of it to\r\nburn in lamps, is common there. The younger timber is held to make the\r\nbetter-coloured work (and so the oak) but the older more firm and close,\r\nis finer chambleted for ornament; and the very husks and leaves being\r\nmacerated in warm water, and that liquor poured on the carpet of walks,\r\nand bowling-greens, does infallibly kill the worms, without endangering\r\nthe grass: Not to mention the dye which is made of this lixive, to\r\ncolour wooll, woods, and hair, as of old they us’d it. The water of the\r\nhusks is sovereign against all pestilential infections, and that of the\r\nleaves to mundifie and heal inveterate ulcers. That which is produced of\r\nthe thick-shell, becomes best timber, that of the thinner, better fruit.\r\nColumella has sundry excellent rules how to ascertain and accelerate the\r\ngrowth of this tree, and to improve its qualities; and I am assur’d,\r\nthat having been graffed on the ash (though others say no incision\r\nimproves it) it thrives exceedingly, becomes a handsome tree, and what\r\nis most estimable, bears its fruit within four years, all which I\r\nrecommend to the farther industrious. The green husk dry’d, or the first\r\npeeping red buds and leaves reduced to powder, serves instead of\r\npepper, to condite meats and sauces. ’Tis thought better to cudgel off\r\nthe fruit, when dropping ripe, than to gather it by hand; and that the\r\nhusk may open, lay them by in a dry room, sometimes turning them with a\r\nbroom, but without washing, for fear of mouldiness. In Italy they arm\r\nthe tops of long poles with nails and iron for the purpose, and believe\r\nthe beating improves the tree; which I no more believe, than I do that\r\ndiscipline would reform a perverse shrew: Those nuts which come not\r\neasily out of their husks, should be laid to mellow in heaps, and the\r\nrest expos’d in the sun, till the shells dry, else they will be apt to\r\nperish the kernel: Some again preserve them in their own leaves, or in a\r\nchest made of walnut-tree wood; others in sand, especially if you will\r\npreserve them for a seminary; do this in October, and keep them a little\r\nmoist, that they may spear, to be set early in February: Thus after two\r\nyears they may be removed at a yard asunder, cutting the top-root, and\r\nside branches, but sparing the head; and being two yards high, bud, or\r\nremove them immediately. Old nuts are not wholsome till macerated in\r\nwarm, and almost boiling water; but if you lay them in a leaden pot, and\r\nbury them in the earth, so as no vermin can attaque them, they will keep\r\nmarvellously plump the whole year about, and may easily be blanched: In\r\nSpain they use to strew the gratings of old and hard nuts (first peel’d)\r\ninto their tarts and other meats. For the oyl, one bushel of nuts will\r\nyield fifteen pounds of peel’d and clear kernels, and that half as much\r\noyl, which the sooner ’tis drawn, is the more in quantity, though the\r\ndryer the nut, the better in quality; the lees, or marc of the\r\npressing, is excellent to fatten hogs with. After the nuts are beaten\r\ndown, the leaves would be sweep’d into heaps, and carried away, because\r\ntheir extreme bitterness impairs the ground, and as I am assured,\r\nprejudices the trees: The green husks boiled, make a good colour to dye\r\na dark yellow, without any mixture; and the distillation of its leaves\r\nwith honey and urine, makes hair spring on baldheads: Besides its use in\r\nthe famous Salernitan antidote; if the kernel a little masticated, be\r\napplied to the biting of a suspected mad-dog, and when it has lain three\r\nhours, be cast to poultrey, they will die if they eat of it. In Italy,\r\nwhen a countreyman finds any pain in his side, he drinks a pint of the\r\nfresh oyl of this nut, and finds immediate ease: And more famous is the\r\nwonderful cure, which the _fungus_ substance separating the lobs of the\r\nkernel, pulveriz’d and drank in wine, in a moderate quantity, did\r\nrecover the English army in Ireland of a dyssentary, when no other\r\nremedy could prevail: The same also in pleurisies, &c. The juice of the\r\noutward rind of the nut, makes an excellent gargle for a sore-throat:\r\nThe kernel being rubb’d upon any crack or chink of a leaking or crazy\r\nvessel, stops it better than either clay, pitch, or wax: In France they\r\neat them blanch’d and fresh, with wine and salt, having first cut them\r\nout of the shells before they are hardned, with a short broad\r\nbrass-knife, because iron rusts, and these they call _cernois_, from\r\ntheir manner of scooping them out. Lastly, of the _fungus_ emerging from\r\nthe trunk of an old tree, (and indeed some others) is made touch-wood,\r\nartificially prepar’d in a _lixivium_ or lye, dried, and beaten flat,\r\nand then boil’d with salt-peter, to render it apter to kindle. The tree\r\nwounded in the Spring, yields a liquor, which makes an artificial wine.\r\nSee Birch, cap. XVII.

The\r\n_torminalis_ (so called for its effects against gripings of the bowels)\r\nis the kind most frequent with us; for those of the narrower, and less\r\nindented leaf, are not so common in England as in France, bearing a sort\r\nof berry of the pear-shape, and is there call’d the _cormier_; this tree\r\nmay be graffed either on it self, or on the white-thorn, and quince. To\r\nthis we might add, the _mespilus_ or medlar, being an hard wood, and of\r\nwhich I have seen very beautiful walking-staves. But there is yet a rare\r\nkind of service-tree, frequent in Germany, which we find not in our\r\nwoods, and they speak of another sort, which bears poyson-berries.\r\n\r\n2. The timber of the sort is useful for the joyner, and of which I have\r\nseen a room curiously wainscotted: Also for the engraver of wood-cuts,\r\nbows, pullys, skrews, mill-spindles and other; goads to drive oxen with,\r\n&c. pistol and gun-stocks, and for most that the wild-pear-tree, serves;\r\nand being of a very delicate grain for the turner, and divers\r\ncuriosities, and looks beautifully, and is almost everlasting, being\r\nrubb’d over with oyl of linseed, well boil’d, it may be made to\r\ncounterfeit ebony, or almost any Indian wood, colour’d according to art:\r\nAlso it is taken to build with, yielding beams of considerable\r\nsubstance: The shade is beautiful for walks, and the fruit not\r\nunpleasant, especially the second kind, of which with new wine and\r\nhoney, they make a _conditum_ of admirable effect to corroborate the\r\nstomach; and the fruit alone is good in dysentery’s and lasks. The water\r\ndistill’d from the stalks of the flowers and leaves in M. B. and twice\r\nrectified upon fresh matter, is incomparable for consumptive and tabid\r\nbodies, taking an ounce daily at several times: Likewise it cures the\r\ngreen-sickness in virgins, and is prevalent in all fluxes; distill’d\r\nwarm into the ears it abates the pain: The wood or bark contus’d, and\r\napplied to any green wound, heals it; and the powder thereof drank in\r\noyl olive, consolidates inward ruptures: Lastly, the salt of the wood\r\ntaken in decoction of _althæa_ to three grains, is an incomparable\r\nremedy to break, and expel gravel. The service gives the husbandman an\r\nearly presage of the approaching Spring, by extending his adorned buds\r\nfor a peculiar entertainment, and dares peep out in the severest\r\nWinters.\r\n\r\n3. That I rank this amongst the forest berry-bearing trees, (frequent in\r\nthe hedges, and growing wild in Herefordshire, and many places; for I\r\nspeak not here of our orchard-cherries, said to have been brought into\r\nKent out of Flanders by Hen. VIII.) is chiefly from the suffrage of that\r\nindustrious planter Mr. Cooke, from whose ingenuity and experience (as\r\nwell as out of gratitude for his frequent mentioning of me in his\r\nelaborate and useful work) I acknowledge to have benefited my self, and\r\nthis edition; though I have also given no obscure tast of this pretty\r\ntree in Chap. XX.\r\n\r\nIt is rais’d of the stones of black-cherries very ripe (as they are in\r\nJuly) endeavouring to procure such as are full, and large; whereof some\r\nhe tells us, are little inferior to the black Orleance, without\r\ngraffing, and from the very genius of the ground. These gather’d, the\r\nfleshy part is to be taken off, by rolling them under a plank in dry\r\nsand, and when the humidity is off (as it will be in 3 or 4 days)\r\nreserve them in sand again a little moist and hous’d, ’till the\r\nbeginning of February, when you may sow them in a light gravelly mould,\r\nkeeping them clean for two years, and thence planting them into your\r\nnurseries, to raise other kinds upon, or for woods, copses and\r\nhedge-rows, and for walks and avenues, which if of a dryish soil, mixt\r\nwith loam, though the bottom be gravel, will thrive into stately trees,\r\nbeautified with blossoms of a surprizing whiteness, greatly relieving\r\nthe sedulous bees, and attracting birds.\r\n\r\nIf you sow them in beds immediately after they are excarnated, they\r\nwill appear the following Spring, and then at two years shoot, be fit to\r\nplant out where you please; otherwise, being kept too long e’er you sow\r\nthem, they will sleep two Winters: And this is a rule, which he\r\nprescribes for all sorts of stone-fruit.\r\n\r\nYou may almost at any time remove young cherry-trees, abating the heads\r\nto a single shoot.\r\n\r\nHe recommends it for the copse, as producing a strong shoot, and as apt\r\nto put forth from the roots, as the elm; especially, if you fell lusty\r\ntrees: In light ground it will increase to a goodly tall tree, of which\r\nhe mentions one, that held above 85 foot in height: I have my self\r\nplanted of them, and imparted to my friends, which have thriv’d\r\nexceedingly; but till now did not insert it among the foresters: The\r\nvertues of the fruit of this cherry-tree against the epilepsy, palsy,\r\nand convulsions, &c. are in the spirits and distill’d waters. Concerning\r\nits other uses, see the chapter and section above-mentioned, to which\r\nadd _pomona_, Chap. 8. annexed with this treatise. This tree affords\r\nexcellent stocks for the budding and graffing of other cherries on.\r\n\r\nAnd here I might mention the bitter cherry of Canada, (tho’ exceedingly\r\nunlike to ours) which would yet be propagated for the incomparable\r\nliquor it is said to yield, preferable to the best limonade, by an\r\nincision of two inches deep in the stem, and sloping to the length of a\r\nfoot, without prejudice to the tree. What is said of it, and of the\r\nmaple, in the late discovery of the North-America, may be seen in the\r\nlate description of those countries. For other exotic species, v. Ray\r\n_Dendrolog._ Tom. III. p. 45, 46.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n_Of the Maple._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The maple [_acer minus_] (of which authors (see Salmasius upon\r\n_Solinus_, c. 33.) reckon very many kinds) was of old held in equal\r\nestimation almost with the citron; especially the _bruscum_, the\r\nFrench-maple and the _pavonaceus_, peacocks-tail maple, which is that\r\nsort so elegantly undulated, and crisped into variety of curles, as\r\nemulates the famous _citria_. It were a most laudable attempt, if some\r\nwould enquire out, and try the planting of such sorts as are not\r\nindigenes amongst us; such as is especially the German _Aier_, and that\r\nof Virginia, not yet cultivated here, but an excellent tree: And if this\r\nwere extended to other timber, and exotic trees likewise, it would prove\r\nof extraordinary benefit and ornament to the publick, and were worthy\r\neven of the royal care. They are all produced of seeds contain’d in the\r\nfolliacles and keys, or birds-tongues (as they are call’d) like the ash,\r\n(after a year’s interrment) and like to it, affect a sound, and a dry\r\nmould; growing both in woods and hedge-rows, especially in the latter;\r\nwhich if rather hilly than low, affords the fairest timber. It is also\r\npropagated by layers and suckers. By shredding up the boughs to a head,\r\nI have caused it to shoot to a wonderful height in a little time; but if\r\nyou will lop it for the fire, let it be done in January; and indeed it\r\nis observ’d to be of noxious influence to the subnascent plants of other\r\nkinds, by reason of a clammy dew which it sheds upon them, and therefore\r\nthey would not be indulg’d in pollards, or spreading trees, but to\r\nthicken under-woods and copses. The timber is far superior to beech for\r\nall uses of the turner, who seeks it for dishes, cups, trays, trenchers,\r\n&c. as the joyner for tables, inlayings, and for the delicateness of the\r\ngrain, when the knurs and nodosities are rarely diapred, which does much\r\nadvance its price: Our turners will work it so thin, that it is almost\r\ntransparent: Also for the lightness (under the name _Aier_) imploy’d\r\noften by those who make musical instruments: Also that especially, which\r\ngrows in Friuli, Carniola, and Saltzburglandt: There is a larger sort,\r\nwhich we call the sycomor.\r\n\r\n2. But the description of this lesser maple, and the ancient value of\r\nit, is worth the citing. _Acer operum elegantiâ, & subtilitate cedro\r\nsecundum; plura ejus genera: Album, quod praecipui candoris vocatur\r\nGallicum: In Transpadana Italia, transque Alpes nascens. Alterum genus,\r\ncrispo macularum discursu, qui cum excellentior fuit, à similitudine\r\ncaudæ pavonum nomen accepit._\r\n\r\n     ‘The maple, (says Pliny) for the elegancy and fineness of the wood,\r\n     is next to the very cedar it self. There are several kinds of it,\r\n     especially the white, which is wonderfully beautiful; this is\r\n     call’d the French-maple, and grows in that part of Italy, that is\r\n     on the other side of Po beyond the Alpes: The other has a curl’d\r\n     grain, so curiously maculated, that from a near resemblance, it was\r\n     usually call’d the Peacock’s-tail, &c.’\r\n\r\nHe goes on to commend that of Istria, and that growing on the mountains\r\nfor the best: But in the next chapter; _Pulcherrimum vero est bruscum,\r\nmultoque excellentius etiamnum mollusculum, tuber utrumque arboris ejus.\r\nBruscum intortiùs crispum, molluscum simplicius sparsum; et si\r\nmagnitudinem mensarum caperet, haud dubiè præferretur cedro, nunc intra\r\npugillares, lectorumque silicios aut laminas, &c. è brusco fiunt mensæ\r\nnigrescentes, &c._ Plin. _l._ 16. c. 15, 16.\r\n\r\n     ‘The _bruscum_, or Knur is wonderfully fair, but the _molluscum_ is\r\n     counted most precious; both of them knobs and swellings out of the\r\n     tree. The _bruscum_ is more intricately crisp’d; the _molluscum_\r\n     not so much; and had we trees large enough to saw into planks for\r\n     tables, ’twould be preferr’d before cedar, (or citron, for so some\r\n     copies read it) but now they use it only for small table-books, and\r\n     with its thin boards to wainscot bed-testers with, _&c._ The\r\n     _bruscum_ is of a blackish kind, with which they make tables.’\r\n\r\nThus far Pliny. And such spotted tables were the famous Tigrin, and\r\nPantherine curiosities of; not so call’d from being supported with\r\nfigures carved like those beasts, as some conceive, and was in use even\r\nin our grand-fathers days, but from its natural spots and maculations,\r\n_hem, quantis facultatibus æstimavere ligneas maculas!_ as Tertullian\r\ncrys out, _de Pallio_, c, 5. Such a table was that of Cicero’s, which\r\ncost him 10000 _Sesterces_; such another had Asinius Gallus. That of\r\nKing Juba was sold for 15000, and another which I read of, valu’d at\r\n140000 H.S. which at about 3d. sterling, arrives to a pretty sum; and\r\nyet that of the Mauritanian Ptoleme, was far richer, containing four\r\nfoot and an half diameter, three inches thick, which is reported to have\r\nbeen sold for its weight in gold: Of that value they were, and so madly\r\nluxurious the age, that when they at any time reproach’d their wives for\r\ntheir wanton expensiveness in pearl and other rich trifles, they were\r\nwont to retort, and turn the tables upon their husbands. The knot of the\r\ntimber was the most esteem’d, and is said to be much resembled by the\r\nfemale cypress: We have now, I am almost persuaded, as beautiful planks\r\nof some walnut-trees, near the root; and yew, ivy, rose-wood, ash,\r\nthorn, and olive, I have seen incomparable pieces; but the great art was\r\nin the seasoning, and politure; for which last, the rubbing with a man’s\r\nhand who came warm out of the bath, was accounted better than any cloth,\r\nas Pliny reports. Some there be who contend, this citern was a part near\r\nthe root of the cedar, which, as they describe it, is very oriental and\r\nodoriferous; but most of the learned favour the citron, and that it grew\r\nnot far from our Tangier, about the foot of Mount Atlas, whence haply\r\nsome industrious person might procure of it from the Moors; and I did\r\nnot forget to put his then Excellency my Lord H. Howard (since his Grace\r\nthe Duke of Norfolk) in mind of it; who I hoped might have opportunities\r\nof satisfying our curiosity, that by comparing it with those elegant\r\nwoods, which both our own countries, and the Indies furnish, we might\r\npronounce something in the controversie: But his not going so far into\r\nthe countrey, and the disorder which happen’d at his being there, quite\r\nfrustrated this expectation: Here I think good to add, what honest\r\nPalissy philosophises after his plain manner, about the reason of those\r\npretty undulations and chamfers, which we so frequently find in divers\r\nwoods, which he takes to be the descent, as well as ascent of moisture:\r\nFor what else (says he) becomes of that water which we often encounter\r\nin the cavities, when many branches divaricate, and spread themselves at\r\nthe tops of great trees (especially pollards) unless (according to its\r\nnatural appetite) it sink into the very body of the stem through the\r\npores? For example, in the walnut, you shall find, when ’tis old, that\r\nthe wood is admirably figur’d, and, as it were, marbl’d, and therefore\r\nmuch more esteem’d by the joyners, cabinet-makers, and _ouvrages de\r\nmarqueterie_, in-layers, &c. than the young, which is paler of colour,\r\nand without any notable grain, as they call it. For the rain distilling\r\nalong the branches, when many of them break out into clusters from the\r\nstem, sinks in, and is the cause of these marks; since we find it\r\nexceedingly full of pores: Do but plane off a thin chip, or sliver from\r\none of these old trees, and interposing it ’twixt your eye and the\r\nlight, you shall observe it to be full of innumerable holes (much more\r\nperspicuous and ample, by the application of a good{119:1} microscope.)\r\nBut above all, notable for these extravagant damaskings and characters,\r\nis the maple; and ’tis notorious, that this tree is very full of\r\nbranches from the root to its very summit, by reason that it produces no\r\nconsiderable fruit: These arms being frequently cut, the head is more\r\nsurcharged with them, which spreading like so many rays from a centre,\r\nform that hollowness at the top of the stem whence they shoot, capable\r\nof containing a good quantity of water every time it rains: This sinking\r\ninto the pores, as was before hinted, is compell’d to divert its course\r\nas it passes through the body of the tree, where-ever it encounters the\r\nknot of any of those branches which were cut off from the stem; because\r\ntheir roots not only deeply penetrate towards the heart, but are\r\nlikewise of themselves very hard and impervious; and the frequent\r\nobliquity of this course of the subsiding moisture, by reason of these\r\nobstructions, is, as may be conceived, the cause of those curious\r\nworks, which we find remarkable in this, and other woods, whose branches\r\ngrow thick from the stem: But for these curious contextures, consult\r\nrather the learned Dr. Grew. We have shewed how by culture, and\r\nstripping up, it arrives to a goodly tree; and surely there were some of\r\nthem of large bulk, and noble shades, that Virgil should chuse it for\r\nthe Court of his Evander (one of his worthiest princes, in his best of\r\npoems) sitting in his maple-throne; and when he brings Æneas into the\r\nroyal cottage, he makes him this memorable complement; greater, says\r\ngreat Cowley, than ever was yet spoken at the Escurial, the Louvre, or\r\nWhite-hall.\r\n\r\n    This humble roof, this rustique court, said he,\r\n    Receiv’d Alcides crown’d with victory:\r\n    Scorn not (great guest) the steps where he has trod,\r\n    But contemn wealth, and imitate a God.{120:1}\r\n\r\nThe savages in Canada, when the sap rises in the maple, by an incision\r\nin the tree, extract the liquor; and having evaporated a reasonable\r\nquantity thereof (as suppose 7 or 8 pound), there will remain one pound,\r\nas sweet and perfect sugar, as that which is gotten out of the cane;\r\npart of which sugar has been for many years constantly sent to Rouen in\r\nNormandy, to be refin’d: There is also made of this sugar an excellent\r\nsyrup of maiden-hair and other capillary plants, prevalent against the\r\n_scorbut_; though Mr. Ray thinks otherwise, by reason of the saccharine\r\nsubstance remaining in the decoction: See _Synops.

The sycomor, or wild fig-tree, (falsly so called) is, our _album_,\r\n_acer majus_, or broad-leav’d _mas_, one of the maples, and is much more\r\nin reputation for its shade than it deserves; for the honey-dew leaves,\r\nwhich fall early (like those of the ash) turn to mucilage and noxious\r\ninsects, and putrifie with the first moisture of the season; so as they\r\ncontaminate and mar our walks; and are therefore by my consent, to be\r\nbanish’d from all curious gardens and avenues. ’Tis rais’d of the keys\r\nin the husk (as soon as ripe) they come up the first Spring; also by\r\nroots and layers, in ground moist, not over-wet or stiff, and to be\r\ngovern’d as other nursery plants.\r\n\r\n2. There is in Germany a better sort of sycomor than ours, (nor are ours\r\n_indiginæ_) wherewith they make saddle-trees, and divers other things of\r\nuse; our own is excellent for trenchers, cart, and plow-timber, being\r\nlight, tough, and not much inferior to ash it self; and if the trees be\r\nvery tall and handsome, are the more tolerable for distant walks\r\nespecially where other better trees prosper not so well, or where a\r\nsudden shade is expected: Some commend them to thicken copp’ces,\r\nespecially in parks, as least apt to the spoil of deer, and that it is\r\ngood fire-wood. This tree being wounded, bleeds a great part of the\r\nyear; and the liquor emulating that of the birch, which for hapning to\r\nfew of the rest (that is, to bleed Winter and Summer) I therefore\r\nmention: The sap is sweet and wholsome, and in a short time yields\r\nsufficient quantity to brew with; so as with one bushel of malt, is made\r\nas good ale as four bushels with ordinary water, upon Dr. Tongue’s\r\nexperience, _Transact._ vol. IV. f. 917.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n_Of the Lime-Tree._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Tilia_ the lime-tree, or [linden] is of two kinds; the male (which\r\nsome allow to be but a finer sort of elm) or maple rather, is harder,\r\nfuller of knots, and of a redder colour; but producing neither flower,\r\nnor seed, (so constantly and so mature with us) as does the female,\r\nwhose blossom is also very odoriferous, perfuming the air, the leaf\r\nlarger; the wood is likewise thicker, of small pith, and not obnoxious\r\nto the worm; so as it seems Theophrastus _de Pl._ l. 3. c. 10. said\r\ntrue, that though they were of both sexes, διαφέρουσι δὲ τῇ μορφῇ τῇ\r\nὅλῃ, &c. _yet they totally differ’d as to their form_. We send\r\ncommonly for this tree into Flanders and Holland, (which indeed grow not\r\nso naturally wild with us) to our excessive cost, whiles our own woods\r\ndo in some places spontaneously produce them, and though of somewhat a\r\nsmaller leaf, yet altogether as good, apt to be civiliz’d, and made more\r\nflorid: From thence I have received many of their berries; so as it is a\r\nshameful negligence, that we are no better provided of nurseries, of a\r\ntree so choice, and universally acceptable: For so they may be rais’d\r\neither of the seeds in October, or (with better success) by the suckers\r\nand plants, which are treated after the same method, and in as great\r\nabundance as the elm, like to which it should be cultivated. You may\r\nknow whether the seeds be prolific, by searching the husk; if biting, or\r\ncutting it in sunder it be full and white, and not husky, as sometimes\r\nwe find the foreigners: Be sure to collect your seed in dry weather,\r\nairing it in an open room, and reserving it in sand, (as has been\r\ntaught) till mid-February, when you may sow it in pretty strong, fresh\r\nand loamy mould, kept shaded, and moist as the season requires, and\r\nclear of weeds, and at the period of two years, plant them out, dress’d\r\nand prun’d as discretion shall advise. But not only by the suckers and\r\nlayers, at the roots, but even by branches lopp’d from the head, may\r\nthis tree be propagated; and peeling off a little of the bark, at a\r\ncompetent distance from the stem or arms, and covering it with loam\r\nmingled with rich earth, they will shoot their fibers, and may be\r\nseasonably separated: But to facilitate this and the like attempts, it\r\nis advisable to apply a ligature above the place, when the sap is\r\nascending, or beneath it, when it (as they say vulgarly) descends. From\r\nJune to November you may lay them; the scrubs and less erect, do\r\nexcellently to thicken copp’ces, and will yield lusty shoots, and useful\r\nfire-wood.\r\n\r\n2. The lime-tree affects a rich feeding loamy soil; in such ground their\r\ngrowth will be most for speed and spreading. They may be planted as big\r\nas ones leg; their heads topp’d at about six or eight foot bole; thus it\r\nwill become (of all other) the most proper, and beautiful for walks, as\r\nproducing an upright body, smooth and even bark, ample leaf, sweet\r\nblossom, the delight of bees, and a goodly shade at distance of\r\neighteen, or twenty five foot. They are also very patient of pruning;\r\nbut if it taper over much, some of the collateral boughs would be\r\nspar’d, or cut off, to check the sap, which is best to be done about\r\nMidsummer; and to make it grow upright, take off the prepondering\r\nbranches with discretion, and so you may correct any other tree, and\r\nredress its obliquity.\r\n\r\nThe root in transplanting would not be much lopp’d; and this (says Mr.\r\nCook) is a good lesson for all young planted trees.\r\n\r\n3. The Prince Elector did lately remove very great lime-trees out of one\r\nof his forests, to a steep hill, exceedingly expos’d to the heat of the\r\nsun, at Heidelberg; and that in the midst of summer: They grow behind\r\nthat strong tower on the south-west, and most torrid part of the\r\neminence; being of a dry, reddish barren earth; yet do they prosper\r\nrarely well: But the heads were cut off, and the pits into which they\r\nwere transplanted, were (by the industry and direction of _Monsieur_ de\r\nSon, a Frenchman, and admirable mechanician, who himself related it to\r\nme) fill’d with a composition of earth and cow-dung, which was\r\nexceedingly beaten, and so diluted with water, as it became almost a\r\nliquid pap: It was in this, that he plunged the roots, covering the\r\nsurface with the turf: A singular example of removing so great trees at\r\nsuch a season, and therefore by me taken notice of here expresly. Other\r\nperfections of the tree (besides its unparallel’d beauty for walks) are\r\nthat it will grow in almost all grounds: That it lasts long; that it\r\nsoon heals its scars; that it affects uprightness; that it stoutly\r\nresists a storm; that it seldom becomes hollow.\r\n\r\n4. The timber of a well-grown lime is convenient for any use that the\r\nwillow is; but much to be preferr’d, as being both stronger, and yet\r\nlighter; whence Virgil calls them _tilias leves_; and therefore fit for\r\nyokes, and to be turn’d into boxes for the apothecaries; and Columella\r\ncommends _arculas tiliaceas_. And because of its colour, and easy\r\nworking, and that it is not subject to split, architects make with it\r\nmodels for their designed buildings; and the carvers in wood, not only\r\nfor small figures, but large statues and intire histories, in bass, and\r\nhigh relieve; witness (besides several more) the lapidation of St.\r\nStephen, with the structures and elevations about it: The trophies,\r\nfestoons, frutages, encarpa, and other sculptures in the frontoons,\r\nfreezes, capitals, pedestals, and other ornaments and decorations, (of\r\nadmirable invention and performance) to be seen about the choir of St.\r\nPaul’s and other churches; royal palaces, and noble houses in city and\r\ncountrey. All of them, the works and invention of our Lysippus, Mr.\r\nGibbons; comparable, and for ought appears, equal to any thing of the\r\nantients; having had the honour (for so I account it) to be the first\r\nwho recommended this great artist to his Majesty, Charles the II. I\r\nmention it on this occasion, with much satisfaction. With the twigs,\r\nthey made baskets and cradles, and of the smoother side of the bark,\r\ntablets for writing; for the antient _Philyra_ is but our _Tilia_; of\r\nwhich Munting affirms, he saw a book made of the inward bark, written\r\nabout 1000 years since. Such another was brought to the Count of St.\r\nAmant, Governor of Arras, 1662, for which there was given 8000 ducats by\r\nthe Emperor, and that it contain’d a work of Cicero, _De Ordinanda\r\nRepublica, & De Inveniendis Orationum Exordiis_: A piece inestimable,\r\nnever publish’d; is now in the library at Vienna, after it had formerly\r\nbeen the greatest rarity in that of the late Cardinal Mazarine: Other\r\npapyraceous trees are mention’d by West-Indian travellers, especially in\r\nHispaniola, Java, &c. which not only exceed our largest paper for\r\nbreadth and length, and may be written on on both sides, but is\r\ncomparable to our best vellum. Bellonius says, that the Grecians made\r\nbottles of the _tilia_, which they finely rozin’d within-side, so\r\nlikewise for pumps of ships, also lattices for windows: Shooemakers use\r\ndressers of the plank to cut leather on, as not so hard as to turn the\r\nedges of their knives; and even the coursest membrane, or slivers of the\r\ntree growing ’twixt the bark and the main body, they now twist into\r\nbass-ropes; besides, the truncheons make a far better coal for\r\ngun-powder than that of alder it self; Scriblets for painters first\r\ndraughts are also made of its coals; and the extraordinary candor and\r\nlightness, has dignify’d it above all the woods of our forest, in the\r\nhands of the Right Honourable the White-Stave officers of His Majesty’s\r\nImperial Court. Those royal plantations of these trees in the parks of\r\nHampton-court, and St. James’s, will sufficiently instruct any man how\r\nthese (and indeed all other trees which stand single) are to be\r\ngovern’d, and defended from the injuries of beasts, and sometimes more\r\nunreasonable creatures, till they are able to protect themselves. In\r\nHolland (where the very high-ways are adorn’d with them) they frequently\r\nclap three or four deal-boards (in manner of a close trunk) about them;\r\nbut it is not so well; because it keeps out the air, which should have\r\nfree access and intercourse to the bole, and by no means be excluded\r\nfrom flowing freely about them, or indeed any other trees; provided\r\nthey are secur’d from cattel, and the violence of impetuous winds, &c.\r\nas His Majesty’s are, without those close coffins, in which the\r\nDutch-men seem rather to bury them alive: In the mean time, is there a\r\nmore ravishing or delightful object, than to behold some intire streets,\r\nand whole towns planted with these trees, in even lines before their\r\ndoors, so as they seem like cities in a wood? this is extreamly fresh,\r\nof admirable effect against the epilepsie, for which the delicately\r\nscented blossoms are held prevalent, and skreen the houses both from\r\nwinds, sun, and dust; than which there can be nothing more desirable\r\nwhere streets are much frequented. For thus\r\n\r\n    The stately Lime, smooth, gentle, streight and fair,\r\n    (With which no other Dryad may compare)\r\n    With verdant locks, and fragrant blossoms deckt,\r\n    Does a large, ev’n, odorate shade project.{127:1}\r\n\r\n_Diræ_ and curses therefore on those inhuman and ambitious tyrants, who,\r\nnot contented with their own dominions, invade their peaceful neighbour,\r\nand send their legions, without distinction, to destroy and level to the\r\nground such venerable and goodly plantations, and noble avenues,\r\nirreparable marks of their barbarity.\r\n\r\nThe distance for walks (as we said) may in rich ground, be twenty five\r\nfoot, in more ordinary soil, eighteen or twenty.

(which in Candy ’tis reported bears seed) besides the aspen.\r\nThe white (famous heretofore for yielding its _umbram hospitalem_) is\r\nthe most ordinary with us, to be rais’d in abundance by every set or\r\nslip. Fence the ground as far as any old poplar-roots extend, they will\r\nfurnish you with suckers innumerable, to be slipp’d from their mothers,\r\nand transplanted the very first year: But if you cut down an old tree,\r\nyou shall need no other nursery. When they are young, their leaves are\r\nsomewhat broader and rounder (as most other trees are) than when they\r\ngrow aged. In moist and boggy places they will flourish wonderfully, so\r\nthe ground be not spewing; but especially near the margins and banks of\r\nrivers,\r\n\r\n    _Populus in fluviis_..........\r\n\r\nand in low, sweet, and fertile ground; yea, and in the dryer likewise.\r\nAlso trunchions of seven or eight foot long, thrust two foot into the\r\nearth, (a hole being made with a sharp hard stake, fill’d with water,\r\nand then with fine earth pressed in, and close about them) when once\r\nrooted, may be cut at six inches above ground; and thus placed at a yard\r\ndistant, they will immediately furnish a kind of copp’ce. But in case\r\nyou plant them of rooted trees, or smaller sets, fix them not so deep;\r\nfor though we bury the trunchions thus profound, yet is the root which\r\nthey strike, commonly but shallow. They will make prodigious shoots in\r\n15, or 16 years; but then the heads must by no means be diminish’d, but\r\nthe lower branches may, yet not too far up; the foot would also be\r\ncleansed every second year. This for the white. The black poplar is\r\nfrequently pollar’d when as big as one’s arm, eight or nine foot from\r\nthe ground, as they trim them in Italy, for their vines to serpent and\r\ntwist on, and those they poll, or head every second year, sparing the\r\nmiddle, streight, and thrivingest shoot, and at the third year cut him\r\nalso. There be yet that condemn the pruning of this poplar, as hindring\r\ntheir growth.\r\n\r\n2. The shade of this tree is esteemed very wholsome in Summer, but they\r\ndo not become walks, or avenues by reason of their suckers, and that\r\nthey foul the ground at fall of the leaf; but they would be planted in\r\nbarren woods, and to flank places at distance, for their increase, and\r\nthe glittering brightness of their foliage: The leaves are good for\r\ncattel, which must be stripp’d from the cut boughs before they are\r\nfaggoted. This to be done in the decrease of October, and reserv’d in\r\nbundles for winter-fodder. The wood of white poplar is sought of the\r\nsculptor, and they saw both sorts into boards, which, where they lie\r\ndry, continue a long time. Of this material they also made shields of\r\ndefence in sword and buckler-days. Dioscorides writes, that the bark\r\nchopt small, and sow’d in rills, well and richly manur’d and watered,\r\nwill produce a plentiful crop of mushrooms; or warm water, in which yest\r\nis dissolv’d, cast upon a new-cut stump: It is to be noted, that those\r\n_fungi_, which spring from the putrid stumps of this tree are not\r\nvenenous (as of all, or most other trees they are) being gathered after\r\nthe first autumnal rains. There is a poplar of a paler green, and is the\r\nproperest for watry ground: ’Twill grow of trunchions from two, or eight\r\nfoot long, and bringing a good lop in a short time, is by some preferr’d\r\nto willows.\r\n\r\nFor the setting of these, Mr. Cook advises the boring of the ground with\r\na sort of auger, to prevent the stripping of the bark from the stake in\r\nplanting: A foot and half deep, or more if great, (for some may be 8 or\r\n9 foot) for pollards, cut sloping, and free of cracks at either end: Two\r\nor three inches diameter, is a competent bigness, and the earth should\r\nbe ramm’d close to them.\r\n\r\nAnother expedient is, by making drains in very moist ground, two spade\r\ndeep, and three foot wide, casting up the earth between the drains,\r\nsowing it the first year with oats to mellow the ground, the next Winter\r\nsetting it for copp’ce, with these, any, or all the watry sorts of\r\ntrees; thus, in four or five years, you will have a handsome fell, and\r\nso successively: It is in the former author, where the charge is exactly\r\ncalculated, to whom I refer the reader. I am inform’d, that in Cheshire\r\nthere grow many stately and streight black poplars, which they call\r\n_peplurus_, that yield boards and planks of an inch and half thickness;\r\nso fit for floaring of rooms, by some preferr’d to oak, for the\r\nwhiteness and lasting, where they lie dry.\r\n\r\n3. They have a poplar in Virginia of a very peculiar shap’d leaf, as if\r\nthe point of it were cut off, which grows very well with the curious\r\namongst us to a considerable stature. I conceive it was first brought\r\nover by John Tradescant, under the name of the tulip-tree, (from the\r\nlikeness of its flower) but is not, that I find, taken much notice of in\r\nany of our herbals: I wish we had more of them; but they are difficult\r\nto elevate at first.\r\n\r\n4. The aspen only (which is that kind of _libyca_ or white poplar,\r\nbearing a smaller, and more tremulous leaf, (by the French call’d _la\r\ntremble_ or quaker) thrusts down a more searching foot, and in this\r\nlikewise differs, that he takes it ill to have his head cut off: Pliny\r\nwould have short trunchions couched two foot in the ground (but first\r\ntwo days dried) at one foot and half distance, and then moulded over.\r\n\r\n5. There is something a finer sort of white poplar, which the Dutch call\r\n_abele_, and we have of late _abele_ much transported out of Holland:\r\nThese are also best propagated of slips from the roots, the least of\r\nwhich will take, and may in March, at three or four years growth, be\r\ntransplanted.\r\n\r\n6. In Flanders (not in France, as a late author pretends) they have\r\nlarge nurseries of them, which first they plant at one foot distance,\r\nthe mould light and moist, by no means clayie, in which though they may\r\nshoot up tall, yet for want of root, they never spread; for, as I said,\r\nthey must be interr’d pretty deep, not above three inches above ground;\r\nand kept clean, by pruning them to the middle-shoot for the first two\r\nyears, and so till the third or fourth. When you transplant, place them\r\nat eight, ten, or twelve foot interval: They will likewise grow of\r\nlayers, and even of cuttings in very moist places. In three years, they\r\nwill come to an incredible altitude; in twelve, be as big as your\r\nmiddle; and in eighteen or twenty, arrive to full perfection. A specimen\r\nof this advance we have had of an _abele_-tree at Sion, which being\r\nlopp’d in Febr. 1651, did by the end of October 52, produce branches as\r\nbig as a man’s wrist, and 17 foot in length; for which celerity we may\r\nrecommend them to such late builders, as seat their houses in naked and\r\nunshelter’d places, and that would put a guise of antiquity upon any new\r\ninclosure; since by these, whilst a man is in a voyage of no long\r\ncontinuance, his house and lands may be so covered, as to be hardly\r\nknown at his return. But as they thus increase in bulk, their value (as\r\nthe Italian poplar, has taught us) advances likewise; which after the\r\nfirst seven years, is annually worth twelve pence more: So as the Dutch\r\nlook upon a plantation of these trees, as an ample portion for a\r\ndaughter, and none of the least effects of their good husbandry; which\r\ntruly may very well be allow’d, if that calculation hold, which the late\r\nworthy{132:1} Knight has asserted, (who began his plantation not long\r\nsince about Richmond,) that 30 pound being laid out in these plants,\r\nwould render at the least ten thousand pounds in eighteen years; every\r\ntree affording thirty plants, and every of them thirty more, after each\r\nseven year’s improving twelve pence in growth, till they arrive to their\r\nacme.\r\n\r\n7. The black poplar grows rarely with us; it is a stronger and taller\r\ntree than the white, the leaves more dark, and not so ample. Divers\r\nstately ones of these, I remember about the banks of Po in Italy; which\r\nflourishing near the old Eridanus (so celebrated by the poets) in which\r\nthe temerarious Phaeton is said to have been precipitated, doubtless\r\ngave argument to that fiction of his sad sister’s metamorphosis, and the\r\namber of their precious tears. It was whiles I was passing down that\r\nriver towards Ferrara, that I diverted my self with this story of the\r\ningenious poet. I am told there is a mountain-poplar much propagated in\r\nGermany about Vienna, and in Bohemia, of which some trees have yielded\r\nplanks of a yard in breadth; why do we procure none of them?\r\n\r\n8. The best use of the poplar, and _abele_ (which are all of them\r\nhospitable trees, for any thing thrives under their shades) is for walks\r\nand avenues about grounds which are situated low, and near the water,\r\ntill coming to be very old, they are apt to grow knurry, and out of\r\nproportion. The timber is incomparable for all sorts of white wooden\r\nvessels, as trays, bowls and other turners ware; and of especial use for\r\nthe bellows-maker, because it is almost of the nature of cork, and for\r\nship-pumps, though not very solid, yet very close, and yet light; so as\r\nit may be us’d for the soles, as well as wooden-heels of shooes, &c.\r\nVitruvius _l. de Materia Cædenda_, reckons it among the\r\nbuilding-timbers, _quæ maxime in ædificiis sunt idoneæ_. Likewise to\r\nmake carts, because it is exceeding light; for vine, and hop-props, and\r\ndivers vimineous works. The loppings in January are for the fire; and\r\ntherefore such as have proper grounds, may with ease, and in short time,\r\nstore themselves for a considerable family, where fuel is dear: but the\r\ntruth is, it burns untowardly, and rather moulders away, than maintains\r\nany solid heat. Of the twigs (with the leaves on) are made brooms. The\r\n_brya_, or catkins attract the bees, as do also the leaves (especially\r\nof the black) more tenacious of the meldews than most forest-trees, the\r\noak excepted.\r\n\r\nOf the aspen, our wood-men make hoops, fire-wood, and coals, &c. and of\r\nthe bark of young trees, in some countries, it serves for candle or\r\ntorch-wood.\r\n\r\nThe juice of poplar leaves, dropp’d into the ears, asswages the pain;\r\nand the buds contus’d, and mix’d with honey, is a good _collyrium_ for\r\nthe eyes; as the unguent to refrigerate and cause sleep.\r\n\r\nOne thing more is not to be pass’d over, of the white-poplar; that the\r\nseeds of misselto being put into holes bored in the bark of this tree,\r\nhave produced the plant: Experiment sufficient to determine that so long\r\ncontroverted question, concerning spontaneous and æquivocal generations.\r\nvid. D. _Raii_ P. L. Append. p. 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n{132:1} Sir Richard Weston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n_Of the Quick-Beam._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The quick-beam [_ornus_, or as the _pinax_ more peculiarly, _fraxinus\r\nbubula_; others, the wild sorb] or (as some term it) the witchen, is a\r\nspecies of wild-ash. The Berries which it produced in October, may then\r\nbe sown; or rather the sets planted: I have store of them in a warm\r\ngrove of mine, and ’tis of singular beauty: It rises to a reasonable\r\nstature, shoots upright, and slender, and consists of a fine smooth\r\nbark. It delights to be both in mountains and woods, and to fix it self\r\nin good light grounds; Virgil affirms, ’twill unite with the pear.\r\n\r\n2. Besides the use of it for the husbandman’s tools, goads, &c. the\r\nwheelright commends it for being all heart; if the tree be large, and so\r\nwell grown as some there are, it will saw into planks, boards and\r\ntimber, (vide Chap XXX. Sect. 10.) and our fletchers commend it for bows\r\nnext to yew; which we ought not to pass over, for the glory of our once\r\nright English ancestors: In a Statute of HEN. 8. you have it mention’d:\r\nIt is excellent fuel; but I have not yet observed any other use, save\r\nthat the blossoms are of an agreeable scent, and the berries such a\r\ntempting bait for the thrushes, that as long as they last, you shall be\r\nsure of their company. Some highly commend the juice of the berries,\r\nwhich (fermenting of it self) if well preserv’d, makes an excellent\r\ndrink against the spleen and scurvy: Ale and beer brew’d with these\r\nberries, being ripe, is an incomparable drink, familiar in Wales, where\r\nthis tree is reputed so sacred, that as there is not a church-yard\r\nwithout one of them planted in them (as among us the yew) so on a\r\ncertain day in the year, every body religiously wears a cross made of\r\nthe wood, and the tree is by some authors call’d _fraxinus\r\nCambro-Britannica_; reputed to be a preservative against fascinations\r\nand evil-spirits; whence, perhaps, we call it witchen; the boughs being\r\nstuck about the house, or the wood used for walking-staves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n_Of the Hasel._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Nux silvestris_, or _corylus_, the hasel, is best rais’d from\r\nthe{136:1} nuts, (also by suckers and layers) which you shall sow like\r\nmast, in a pretty deep furrow toward the end of February, or treat them\r\nas you are instructed in the walnut; light ground may immediately be\r\nsown and harrow’d-in very accurately; but in case the mould be clay,\r\nplow it earlier, and let it be sufficiently mellow’d with the frosts;\r\nand then the third year cut your trees near to the ground with a sharp\r\nbill, the moon decreasing.\r\n\r\n2. But if you would make a grove for pleasure, plant them in fosses, at\r\na yard distance, and cut them within half a foot of the earth, dressing\r\nthem for three or four Springs and Autumns, by only loosning the mould a\r\nlittle about their roots. Others there are, who set the nuts by hand at\r\none foot distance, to be transplanted the third year, at a yard asunder:\r\nBut this work is not to be taken in hand so soon as the nuts fall, till\r\nwinter be well advanc’d; because they are exceedingly obnoxious to the\r\nfrosts; nor will they sprout till the Spring; besides, vermin are great\r\ndevourers of them: Preserve them therefore moist, not mouldy; by laying\r\nthem in their own dry leaves, or in sand, till January.\r\n\r\n    Hasels from sets and suckers take.{136:2}\r\n\r\n3. From whence they thrive very well, the shoots being of the\r\nscantlings of small wands and switches, or somewhat bigger, and such as\r\nhave drawn divers hairy twigs, which are by no means to be disbranch’d,\r\nno more than their roots, unless by a very sparing and discreet hand.\r\nThus, your _coryletum_, or copp’ce of hasels, being planted about\r\nAutumn, may (as some practise it) be cut within three or four inches of\r\nthe ground the Spring following, which the new cyon will suddenly repair\r\nin clusters, and tufts of fair poles of twenty, or sometimes thirty foot\r\nlong: But I rather should spare them till two or three years after, when\r\nthey shall have taken strong hold, and may be cut close to the very\r\nearth, the improsperous and feeble ones especially. Thus are likewise\r\nfilberts to be treated, both of them improved much by transplanting, but\r\nchiefly by graffing, and it would be try’d with filberts, and even with\r\nalmonds themselves, for more elegant experiments.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, I do not confound the filbert, pontic, or filbord,\r\ndistinguish’d by its beard, among our foresters (or bald hasel-nuts)\r\nwhich doubtless we had from abroad; and bearing the names of _avelan_,\r\n_avelin_, as I find in some ancient records and deeds in my custody,\r\nwhere my ancestors names were written Avelan, _alias_, Evelin,\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\n4. For the place, they above all affect cold, barren, dry, and sandy\r\ngrounds; also mountains, and even rocky soils produce them; and where\r\nquaries of free-stone lie underneath, as that at Hasulbery in Wilts,\r\nHaseling-field in Cambridge-shire, Haselmeer in Surrey, and other\r\nplaces; but more plentifully, if the ground be somewhat moist, dankish\r\nand mossie, as in the fresher bottoms, and sides of hills, hoults, and\r\nin hedge-rows. Such as are maintain’d for copp’ces, may after twelve\r\nyears be fell’d the first time; the next, at seven or eight, &c. for by\r\nthis period, their roots will be compleatly vigorous. You may plant them\r\nfrom October to January, provided you keep them carefully weeded, till\r\nthey have taken fast hold; and there is not among all our store, a more\r\nprofitable wood for copp’ces, and therefore good husbands should store\r\nthem with it.\r\n\r\n5. The use of the hasel is for poles, spars, hoops, forks, angling-rods,\r\nfaggots, cudgels, coals, and springs to catch birds; and it makes one of\r\nthe best coals, once us’d for gun-powder; being very fine and light,\r\ntill they found alder to be more fit: There is no wood which purifies\r\nwine sooner, than the chips of hasel: Also for with’s and bands, upon\r\nwhich, I remember, Pliny thinks it a pretty speculation, that a wood\r\nshould be stronger to bind withal, being bruis’d and divided, than when\r\nwhole and entire: The coals are us’d by painters, to draw with like\r\nthose of Sallow: Lastly, for riding switches, and divinatory rods for\r\nthe detecting and finding out of minerals; (at least, if that tradition\r\nbe no imposture) is very wonderful; by whatsoever occult virtue, the\r\nforked-stick (so cut, and skilfully held) becomes impregnated with those\r\ninvisible steams and exhalations; as by its spontaneous bending from an\r\nhorizontal posture, to discover not only mines, and subterraneous\r\ntreasure, and springs of water, but criminals, guilty of murther, &c.\r\nmade out so solemnly, and the effects thereof, by the attestation of\r\nmagistrates, and divers other learned and credibile persons, (who have\r\ncritically examined matters of fact) is certainly next to miracle, and\r\nrequires a strong faith: Let the curious therefore consult that\r\nphilosophical treatise of{139:1} Dr. Vallemont; which will at least\r\nentertain them with a world of surprizing things. But now after all the\r\nmost signal honour it was ever employ’d in, and which might deservedly\r\nexalt this humble and common plant above all the trees of the wood, is\r\nthat of hurdles, (especially the flexible white: the red and brittle);\r\nnot for that it is generally used for the folding of our innocent sheep,\r\nan emblem of the church; but for making the walls of one of the first\r\nChristian Oratories in the world; and particularly in this island, that\r\nvenerable and sacred fabrick at Glastenbury, founded by St. Joseph of\r\nArimathea; which is storied to have been first compos’d but of a few\r\nsmall hasel-rods interwoven about certain stakes driven into the ground;\r\nand walls of this kind, instead of laths and punchions, superinduc’d\r\nwith a course mortar made of loam and straw, do to this day inclose\r\ndivers humble cottages, sheads and out-houses in the countrey; and ’tis\r\nstrong and lasting for such purposes, whole, or cleft, and I have seen\r\nample enclosures of courts and gardens so secur’d.\r\n\r\n6. There is a compendious expedient for the thickning of copp’ces which\r\nare too transparent, by laying of a sampler or pole of an hasel, ash,\r\npoplar, &c. of twenty or thirty foot in length (the head a little\r\nlopp’d) into the ground, giving it a chop near the foot, to make it\r\nsuccumb; this fastned to the earth with a hook or two, and cover’d with\r\nsome fresh mould at a competent depth (as gardeners lay their\r\ncarnations) will produce a world of suckers, thicken and furnish a\r\ncopp’ce speedily. I add no more of filberts, a kinder and better sort\r\nof hasel-nut, of larger and longer shape and beard; the kernels also\r\ncover’d with a fine membrane, of which the red is more delicate: They\r\nboth are propagated as the hasel, and while more domestick, planted\r\neither asunder, or in palisade, are seldom found in the copp’ces: They\r\nare brought among other fruit, to the best tables for desert, and are\r\nsaid to fatten, but too much eaten, obnoxious to the asthmatic. In the\r\nmean time, of this I have had experience; that hasel-nuts, but the\r\nfilberd specially, being full ripe, and peel’d in warm water, (as they\r\nblanch almonds) make a pudding very little (if at all) inferior to that\r\nour ladies make of almonds. But I am now come to the water-side; let us\r\nnext consider the aquatic.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n{136:1} _De nucum generibus_, vide Macrob. Sect. L. II.

The birch [_betula_, in British _bedw_, doubtless a proper indigene\r\nof England, (whence some derive the name of Barkshire) though Pliny\r\ncalls it a Gaulish tree] is altogether produc’d of roots or suckers,\r\n(though it sheds a kind of _samera_ about the Spring) which being\r\nplanted at four or five foot interval, in small twigs, will suddenly\r\nrise to trees; provided they affect the ground, which cannot well be too\r\nbarren, or spongy; for it will thrive both in the dry, and the wet,\r\nsand, and stony, marshes, and bogs; the water-galls, and uliginous parts\r\nof forests that hardly bear any grass, do many times spontaneously\r\nproduce it in abundance, whether the place be high, or low, and nothing\r\ncomes amiss to it. Plant the small twigs, or suckers having roots, and\r\nafter the first year, cut them within an inch of the surface; this will\r\ncause them to sprout in strong and lusty tufts, fit for copp’ce, and\r\nspring-woods; or, by reducing them to one stem, render them in a very\r\nfew years fit for the turner. For\r\n\r\n2. Though birch be of all other the worst of timber, yet has it its\r\nvarious uses, as for the husbandman’s ox-yoaks; also for hoops, small\r\nscrews, paniers, brooms, wands, bavin-bands, and wythes for fagots; and\r\nclaims a memory for arrows, bolts, shafts, (our old English artillery;)\r\nalso for dishes, bowls, ladles, and other domestic utensils, in the good\r\nold days of more simplicity, yet of better and truer hospitality. In\r\nNew-England our Northern Americans make canoos, boxes, buckets, kettles,\r\ndishes, which they sow, and joyn very curiously with thread made of\r\ncedar-roots, and divers other domestical utensils, as baskets, baggs,\r\nwith this tree, whereof they have a blacker kind; and out of a certain\r\nexcrescence from the bole, a _fungus_, which being boil’d, beaten, and\r\ndry’d in an oven, makes excellent spunck or touch-wood, and balls to\r\nplay withal; and being reduc’d to powder, astringent, is an infallible\r\nremedy in the hœmerhoids. They make also not only this small ware, but\r\neven small-craft, pinnaces of birch, ribbing them with white cedar, and\r\ncovering them with large flakes of birch-bark, sow them with thread of\r\nspruse-roots, and pitch them, as it seems we did even here in Britain,\r\nas well as the Veneti, making use of the willow, whereof Lucan,\r\n\r\n    When Sicoris to his own banks restor’d,\r\n    Had quit the field, of twigs, and willow-board\r\n    They build small craft, cover’d with bullocks-hide,\r\n    In which they reach’d the rivers farther side:\r\n    So sail the Veneti if Padus flow,\r\n    The Britains sail on their rough ocean so.{142:1}\r\n\r\nAlso for fuel: In many of the mosses in the West-Riding of Yorkshire,\r\nare often dug up birch-trees, that burn and flame like firr and\r\ncandle-wood; and I think Pliny says the Gaules extracted a sort of\r\nbitumen out of birch: Great and small coal, are made by the charring of\r\nthis wood; (see Book III Chap. 4. of fuel) as of the tops and loppings,\r\nMr. Howard’s new tanne. The inner white cuticle and silken-bark, (which\r\nstrips off of it self almost yearly) was anciently us’d for\r\nwriting-tables, even before the invention of paper; of which there is a\r\nbirch-tree in Canada, whose bark will serve to write on, and may be made\r\ninto books, and of the twigs very pretty baskets; with the outward\r\nthicker and courser part of the common birch, are divers houses in\r\nRussia, Poland, and those poor northern tracts cover’d, instead of\r\nslates and tyle: Nay, one who has lately publish’d an account of\r\nSweden,{142:2} says, that the poor people grind the very bark of\r\nbirch-trees, to mingle with their bread-corn. ’Tis affirm’d by Cardan,\r\nthat some birch-roots are so very extravagantly vein’d, as to represent\r\nthe shapes and images of beasts, birds, trees, and many other pretty\r\nresemblances. Lastly, of the whitest part of the old wood, found\r\ncommonly in doating birches, is made the grounds of our effeminate\r\nfarin’d gallants sweet powder; and of the quite consum’d and rotten\r\n(such as we find reduc’d to a kind of reddish earth in superannuated\r\nhollow-trees) is gotten the best mould for the raising of divers\r\nseedlings of the rarest plants and flowers; to say nothing here of the\r\nmagisterial _fasces_ for which anciently the cudgels were us’d by the\r\n_lictor_, for lighter faults, as now the gentler rods by our tyrannical\r\npædagogues.\r\n\r\n3. I should here add the uses of the water too, had I full permission to\r\ntamper with all the medicinal virtues of trees: But if the sovereign\r\neffects of the juice of this despicable tree supply its other defects\r\n(which make some judge it unworthy to be brought into the catalogue of\r\nwoods to be propagated) I may perhaps for once, be permitted to play the\r\nempiric, and to gratifie our laborious wood-man with a draught of his\r\nown liquor; and the rather, because these kind of secrets are not yet\r\nsufficiently cultivated; and ingenious planters would by all means be\r\nencourag’d to make more trials of this nature, as the Indians and other\r\nnations have done on their palmes; and trees of several kinds, to their\r\ngreat emolument. The mystery is no more than this: About the beginning\r\nof March (when the buds begin to be proud and turgid, and before they\r\nexplain into leaves) with a chizel and a mallet, cut a slit almost as\r\ndeep as the very pith, under some bough or branch of a well-spreading\r\nbirch; cut it oblique, and not long-ways (as a good chirurgion would\r\nmake his orifice in a vein) inserting a small stone or chip, to keep the\r\nlips of the wound a little open. Sir Hugh Plat, (giving a general rule\r\nfor the gathering of sap, and tapping of trees) would have it done\r\nwithin one foot of the ground, the first rind taken off, and then the\r\nwhite bark slit over-thwart, no farther than to the body of the tree:\r\nMoreover, that this wound be made only in that part of the bark which\r\nrespects the south-west, or between those quarters; because (says he)\r\nlittle or no sap riseth from the northern, nor indeed when the east-wind\r\nblows. In this slit, by the help of your knife to open it, he directs\r\nthat a leaf of the tree be inserted, first fitted to the dimensions of\r\nthe slit, from which the sap will distil in manner of filtration: Take\r\naway the leaf, and the bark will close again, a little earth being\r\nclapped to the slit. Thus the Knight for any tree. But we have already\r\nshew’d how the birch is to be treated: Fasten therefore a bottle, or\r\nsome such convenient vessel appendant; this does the effect as well as\r\nperforation or tapping: Out of this aperture will extil a limpid and\r\nclear water, retaining an obscure smack both of the tast and odor of the\r\ntree; and which (as I am credibly inform’d) will in the space of twelve\r\nor fourteen days, preponderate, and out-weigh the whole tree it self,\r\nbody and roots; which if it be constant, and so happen likewise in other\r\ntrees, is not only stupendous, but an experiment worthy the\r\nconsideration of our profoundest philosophers: _An ex sola aqua fiunt\r\narbores?_ whether water only be the principle of vegetables, and\r\nconsequently of trees: I say, I am credibly inform’d; and therefore the\r\nlate unhappy{144:1} angry-man might have spar’d his animadversion: For\r\nhe that said but twenty gallons run, does he know how many more might\r\nhave been gotten out of larger apertures, at the insertion of every\r\nbranch, and foot in the principal roots during the whole season? But I\r\nconceive I have good authority for my assertion, out of the author cited\r\nin the margin, whose words are these: _Si mense Martio perforaveris\r\nbetulam, &c. exstillabit aqua limpida, clara, & pura, obscurum arboris\r\nsaporem & odorem referens, quæ spatio 12 aut 14 dierum, præponderabit\r\narbori cum ramis & radicibus, &c._ His exceptions about the beginning of\r\nMarch are very insignificant; since I undertake not punctuality of time;\r\nand his own pretended experience shew’d him, that in hard weather it did\r\nnot run till the expiration of the month, or beginning of April; and\r\nanother time on the tenth of February; and usually he says, about the\r\ntwenty-fourth day, &c. at such uncertainty: What immane difference then\r\nis there between the twenty-fourth of Feb. and commencement of March?\r\nBesides, these anomolous bleedings, (even of the same tree) happen early\r\nor later, according to the temper of the air and weather. In the mean\r\ntime, evident it is, that we know of no tree which does more copiously\r\nattract, be it that so much celebrated spirit of the world, (as they\r\ncall it) in form of water (as some) or a certain specifique liquor\r\nrichly impregnated with this balsamical property: That there is such a\r\n_magnes_ in this simple tree, as does manifestly draw to it self some\r\noccult and wonderful virtue, is notorious; nor is it conceivable,\r\nindeed, the difference between the efficacy of that liquor which distils\r\nfrom the bole, or parts of the tree nearer to the root (where Sir Hugh\r\nwould celebrate the incision) and that which weeps out from the more\r\nsublime branches, more impregnated with this astral vertue, as not so\r\nnear the root, which seems to attract rather a cruder, and more common\r\nwater, through fewer strainers, and neither so pure, and aerial as in\r\nthose refined percolations, the nature of the places where these trees\r\ndelight to grow (for the most part lofty, dry, and barren) consider’d.\r\nBut I refer these disquisitions to the learned; especially, as mentioned\r\nby that incomparable philosopher, and my most noble friend, the\r\nHonourable Mr. Boyle, in his second part of the _Usefulness of Natural\r\nPhilosophy_, Sect. 1. Essay 3_d._ where he speaks of the _manna del\r\ncorpo_, or trunk-manna, as well as of that liquor from the bough; also\r\nof the _sura_ which the coco-trees afford; and that Polonian secret of\r\nthe liquor of the walnut-tree root; with an encouragement of more\r\nfrequent experiments to educe saccharine substances upon these\r\noccasions: But the book being publish’d so long since this _Discourse_\r\nwas first printed, I take only here the liberty to refer the reader to\r\none of the best entertainments in the world.\r\n\r\nBut now before we expatiate farther concerning saps; it is by some\r\ncontroverted, whether this exhaustion would not be an extreme detriment\r\nto the growth, substance, and other parts of trees: As to the growth and\r\nbulk, if what I have observ’d of a birch, which has for very many years\r\nbeen perforated at the usual season, (besides the scars made in the\r\nbark) it still thrives, and is grown to a prodigious substance, the\r\nspecies consider’d. What it would effect in other trees (the vine\r\nexcepted unseasonably launc’d) I know not: But this calls to mind, a\r\ntryal of Esq; Brotherton, (mentioning some excortications and incisions,\r\nby what he observ’d in pruning,) that most (if not all) of the sap\r\nascends by the lignous part of trees, not the cortical; nor between the\r\ncortical and lignous: And that the increase of a tree’s growth in\r\nthickness, is by the descent of the sap, and not by the ascent; so as if\r\nthere were no descent, the tree would increase very little, if at all;\r\nfor that there is a perpetual circulation of the sap, during the whole\r\nSummer; and whilst it is in this course, and not a descent at Michaelmas\r\nonly, as some hold, but evaporated by the branches, during Summer and\r\nAutumn, and at Spring supplied with rains. He also thinks it probable,\r\nthat the bodies of plants, as well as those of animals, are nourish’d\r\nand increas’d by a double _pabulum_ or food; as water and air both\r\nimpregnated, mixing and coalescing by a mutual conversion.\r\n\r\nThat all plants and animals seem to have a two-fold kind of roots, one\r\nspreading into the earth, the other shooting up into the air; which, as\r\nthey receive and carry up their proper nutriments to the body of the\r\nplant and root, so they carry off the useless dregs and recrements, &c.\r\nBut this curious note seeming fitter to have been plac’d in our chapter\r\nof Pruning, (upon which this learned gentleman has given us his\r\nexperience) I beg pardon for this diverticle, and return to my subject.\r\n\r\n4. But whilst the second edition was under my hand, there came to me\r\ndivers papers upon this subject, experimentally made by a worthy friend\r\nof mine, a learned and most industrious person, which I had here once\r\nresolv’d to have publish’d, according to the generous liberty granted me\r\nfor so doing; but understanding he was still in pursuit of that useful,\r\nand curious secret, I chang’d my resolution into an earnest address,\r\nthat he would communicate it to the world himself, together with those\r\nother excellent enquiries and observations, which he is adorning for the\r\nbenefit of planters, and such as delight themselves in those innocent\r\nrusticities. I will only by way of corollary, hint some particulars for\r\nsatisfaction of the curious; and especially that we may in some sort\r\ngratifie those earnest suggestions and queries of the late most\r\nobliging{148:1} publisher of the _Philosophical Transactions_, to whose\r\nindefatigable pains the learned world has been infinitely engag’d. In\r\ncompliance therefore to his _Queries_, Monday, Octob. 19. 1668. numb.\r\n40. p. 797, 801, &c. these generals are submitted: That in such trials\r\nas my friend essay’d, he has not yet encountred with any sap but what is\r\nvery clear and sweet; especially that of the sycomor, which has a\r\ndulcoration as if mixed with sugar, and that it runs one of the\r\nearliest: That the maple distill’d when quite rescinded from the body,\r\nand even whilst he yet held it in his hand: That the sycomor ran at the\r\nroot, which some days before yielded no sap from his branches; the\r\nexperiment made at the end of March: But the accurate knowledge of the\r\nnature of sap, and its periodic motions and properties in several trees,\r\nshould be observed by some at entire leisure to attend it daily, and\r\nalmost continually, and will require more than any one person’s industry\r\ncan afford: For it must be enquir’d concerning every tree, its age,\r\nsoil, situation, &c. the variety of its ascending sap depending on it;\r\nand then of its sap ascending in the branches and roots; descending in\r\ncut branches; ascending from root, and not from branches; the seasons\r\nand difference of time in which those accidents happen, &c. He likewise\r\nthinks the best expedient to procure store of liquor, is, to cut the\r\ntrees almost quite through all the circles, on both sides the pith,\r\nleaving only the outmost circle, and the barks on the north, or\r\nnorth-east side unpierced; and this hole, the larger it is bored, the\r\nmore plentifully ’twill distill; which if it be under, and through a\r\nlarge arm, near the ground, it is effected with greatest advantage, and\r\nwill need neither stone, nor chip to keep it open, nor spigot to direct\r\nit to the recipient. Thus it will, in a short time, afford liquor\r\nsufficient to brew with; and in some of these sweet saps, one bushel of\r\nmault will afford as good ale, as four in ordinary waters, even in March\r\nit self; in others, as good as two bushels; for this, preferring the\r\nsycomor before any other: But to preserve it in best condition for\r\nbrewing, till you are stored with a sufficient quantity, it is advis’d,\r\nthat what first runs, be insolated and placed in the sun, till the\r\nremainder be prepar’d, to prevent its growing sour: But it may also be\r\nfermented alone, by such as have the secret: To the curious these essays\r\nare recommended: That it be immediately stopp’d up in the bottles in\r\nwhich it is gathered, the corks well wax’d, and expos’d to the sun, till\r\n(as was said) sufficient quantity be run; then let so much rye-bread\r\n(toasted very dry, but not burnt) be put into it, as will serve to set\r\nit a working; and when it begins to ferment, take it out, and bottle it\r\nimmediately. If you add a few cloves, &c. to steep in it, ’twill\r\ncertainly keep the year about: ’Tis a wonder how speedily it extracts\r\nthe tast and tincture of the spice. Mr. Boyle proposes a sulphurous fume\r\nto the bottles: Spirit of wine may haply not only preserve, but advance\r\nthe virtues of saps; and infusions of rasins are obvious, and without\r\ndecoction best, which does but spend the more delicate parts. Note,\r\nthat the sap of the birch, will make excellent mead.\r\n\r\n5. To these observations, that of the weight and virtue of the several\r\njuices, would be both useful and curious: As whether that which proceeds\r\nfrom the bark, or between that and the wood be of the same nature with\r\nthat which is suposed to spring from the pores of the woody circles? and\r\nwhether it rise in like quantity, upon comparing the incisures? All\r\nwhich may be try’d, first attempting through the bark, and saving that\r\napart, and then perforating into the wood, to the thickness of the bark,\r\nor more; with a like separation of what distills. The period also of its\r\ncurrent would be calculated; as how much proceeds from the bark in one\r\nhour, how much from the wood or body of the tree, and thus every hour,\r\nwith still a deeper incision, with a good large augre, till the tree be\r\nquite perforated: Then by making a second hole within the first, fitted\r\nwith a lesser pipe, the interior heart-sap may be drawn apart, and\r\nexamin’d by weight, quantity, colour, distillation, &c. and if no\r\ndifference perceptible be detected the presumption will be greater, that\r\nthe difference of heart and sap in timber, is not from the saps plenty\r\nor penury, but the season; and then possibly, the very season of\r\nsquaring, as well as felling of timber, may be considerable to the\r\npreservation of it.\r\n\r\n6. The notice likewise of the saps rising more plentifully, and\r\nconstantly in the sun, than shade; more in the day than night, more in\r\nthe roots than branch, more southward, and when that, and the west-wind\r\nblows, than northward, &c. may yield many useful observations: As for\r\nplanting, to set thicker, or thinner (_si cœtera sint paria_) namely,\r\nthe nature of the tree, soil, &c. and not to shade overmuch the roots\r\nof those stems we desire should mount, &c. That in transplanting trees\r\nwe turn the best and largest roots towards the south, and consequently\r\nthe most ample and spreading part of the head correspondent to the\r\nroots: For if there be a strong root on that quarter, and but a feeble\r\nattraction in the branches, this may not always counterpoise the weak\r\nroots on the north-side, damnified by the too puissant attraction of\r\nover large branches: This may also suggest a cause why trees flourish\r\nmore on the south-side, and have their integument and coats thicker on\r\nthose aspects annually, with divers other useful speculations, if in the\r\nmean time, they seem not rather to be _puntillos_ over nice for a plain\r\nforester. Let the curious further consult _Philos. Transactions_, numb.\r\n43, 44, 46, 48, 57, 58, 68, 70, 71. for farther instances and tryals,\r\nupon this subject of sap. And that excellent treatise of Hen. Meibomius.\r\n_De Cervisiis Potibusque; & Ebriaminibus extra Vinum_, annext to\r\n_Turnebus de Vino_, &c. Where he shews how, and by whom, (after the\r\nfirst use of water and milk) were introduc’d the drinks made from\r\nvegetables, vines, corn, and other fruits and juices tapp’d out of\r\ntrees, &c.\r\n\r\n7. To shew our reader yet, that these are no novel experiments, we are\r\nto know, that a large tract of the world, almost altogether subsists on\r\nthese treen liquors; especially that of the date, which being grown to\r\nabout seven or eight foot in height, they wound, as we have taught, for\r\nthe sap, which they call toddy, a very famous drink in the East-Indies.\r\nThis tree increasing every year about a foot, near the opposite part of\r\nthe first incisure, they pierce again, changing the receiver; and so\r\nstill by opposite wounds and notches, they yearly draw forth the\r\nliquor, till it arrive to near thirty foot upward, and of these they\r\nhave ample groves and plantations which they set at seven or eight foot\r\ndistance: But then they use to percolate what they extract, through a\r\nstratum made of the rind of the tree, well contus’d and beaten, before\r\nwhich preparation, it is not safe to drink it; and ’tis observed that\r\nsome trees afford a much more generous wine than others of the same\r\nkind. In the coco and palmeto trees, they chop a bough, as we do the\r\n_bétula_; but in the date, make the incision with a chisel in the body\r\nvery neatly, in which they stick a leaf of the tree, as a _lingula_ to\r\ndirect it into the appendant vessel, which the subjoin’d figure\r\nrepresents, and illustrates with its improvement to our former\r\ndiscourse.\r\n\r\nNote, if there be no fitting arms, the hole thus obliquely perforated,\r\nand a faucet or pipe made of a swan’s or goose’s quill inserted, will\r\nlead the sap into the recipient; and this is a very neat way, and as\r\neffectual: I would also have it try’d, whether the very top twigs,\r\ngrasped in the hand together, a little cropt with a knife, and put into\r\nthe mouth of a bottle, would not instil, if not as much, yet a more\r\nrefined liquor, as some pretend.\r\n\r\n8. The liquor of the birch is esteemed to have all the virtues of the\r\nspirit of salt, without the danger of its acrimony; most powerful for\r\nthe dissolving of the stone in the bladder, bloody water and strangury:\r\nHelmont shews how to make a beer of the water; but the wine is a most\r\nrich cordial, curing (as I am told) consumptions, and such interior\r\ndiseases as accompany the stone in the bladder or reins{152:1}: The\r\njuice decocted with honey and wine, Dr. Needham affirms he has often\r\ncur’d the scorbut with. This wine, exquisitely made, is so strong, that\r\nthe common sort of stone-bottles cannot preserve the spirits, so subtile\r\nthey are and volatile; and yet it is gentle, and very harmless in\r\noperation within the body, and exceedingly sharpens the appetite, being\r\ndrunk _ante pastum_: I will present you a receipt, as it was sent me by\r\na fair lady, and have often, and still use it.\r\n\r\n{Illustration: (a. b.) The _Body_ of the _Tree_ (g.) boar’d at that part\r\nof the _Arm_ (f.) join’d to the _Stem_, with an Augre of an _Inch_ or\r\nmore _diameter_, according to the bigness of the _Tree_. (c.)

To every gallon of birch-water put a quart of honey, well stirr’d\r\ntogether; then boil it almost an hour with a few cloves, and a little\r\nlimon-peel, keeping it well scumm’d: When it is sufficiently boil’d, and\r\nbecome cold, add to it three or four spoonfuls of good ale to make it\r\nwork (which it will do like new ale) and when the yest begins to settle,\r\nbottle it up as you do other winy liquors. It will in a competent time\r\nbecome a most brisk and spiritous drink, which (besides the former\r\nvirtues) is a very powerful opener, and doing wonders for cure of the\r\nphthysick: This wine may (if you please) be made as successfully with\r\nsugar, instead of honey 1 _lb._ to each gallon of water; or you may\r\ndulcifie it with raisins, and compose a raisin-wine of it. I know not\r\nwhether the quantity of the sweet ingredients might not be somewhat\r\nreduc’d, and the operation improv’d: But I give it as receiv’d. The\r\nauthor of the _Vinetum Brit._ boils it but to a quarter or half an hour,\r\nthen setting it a cooling, adds a very little yest to ferment and purge\r\nit; and so barrels it with a small proportion of cinamon and mace\r\nbruis’d, about half an ounce of both to ten gallons, close stopp’d, and\r\nto be bottled a month after. Care must be taken to set the bottles in a\r\nvery cool place, to preserve them from flying; and the wine is rather\r\nfor present drinking, than of long duration, unless the refrigeratorie\r\nbe extraordinarily cold. The very smell of the first springing leaves of\r\nthis tree, wonderfully recreates and exhilerates the spirits.\r\n\r\n10. But besides these, beech, alder, ash, sycomor, elder, &c. would be\r\nattempted for liquors: Thus crabs, and even our very brambles may\r\npossibly yield us medical and useful wines. The poplar was heretofore\r\nesteem’d more physical than the _betula_. The sap of the oak, juice, or\r\ndecoction of the inner bark, cures the fashions, or farcy, a virulent\r\nand dangerous infirmity in horses, and which (like cancers) were reputed\r\nincurable by any other topic, than some actual, or potential cautery:\r\nBut, what is more noble, a dear friend of mine assur’d me, that a\r\ncountrey neighbour of his (at least fourscore years of age) who had lain\r\nsick of a bloody strangury (which by cruel torments reduc’d him to the\r\nvery article of death) was, under God, recover’d to perfect, and almost\r\nmiraculous health and strength (so as to be able to fall stoutly to his\r\nlabour) by one sole draught of beer, wherein was the decoction of the\r\ninternal bark of the oak-tree; and I have seen a composition of an\r\nadmirable sudorific, and diuretic for all affections of the liver, out\r\nof the like of the elm, which might yet be drunk daily, as our coffee\r\nis, and with no less delight: But quacking is not my trade; I speak only\r\nhere as a plain husband-man, and a simple forester, out of the limits\r\nwhereof, I hope I have not unpardonably transgressed: Pan was a\r\nphysician, and he (you know) was president of the woods. But I proceed\r\nto the alder.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n{142:1}\r\n\r\n    Primum cana salix madefacto vimine, parvam\r\n    Texitur in puppim, cæsoque induta juvenco,\r\n    Vectoris patiens, tumidum super emicat amnem.\r\n    Sic Venetus stagnante Pado, fusoque Britannus\r\n    Navigat oceano.......\r\n\r\n{142:2} See _Philos.

They are propagated of trunchions,\r\nand will come of seeds (for so they raise them in Flanders, and make\r\nwonderful profit of the plantations) like the poplar; or of roots,\r\n(which I prefer) the trunchions being set as big as the small of ones\r\nleg, and in length about two foot; whereof one would be plunged in the\r\nmud. This profound fixing of aquatick-trees being to preserve them\r\nsteddy, and from the concussions of the winds, and violence of waters,\r\nin their liquid and slippery foundations. They may be placed at four or\r\nfive foot distance, and when they have struck root, you may cut them,\r\nwhich will cause them to spring in clumps, and to shoot out into many\r\nuseful poles. But if you plant smaller sets, cut them not till they are\r\narriv’d to some competent bigness, and that in a proper season: Which\r\nis, for all the aquaticks and soft woods, not till Winter be well\r\nadvanc’d, in regard of their pithy substance. Therefore, such as you\r\nshall have occasion to make use of before that period, ought to be well\r\ngrown, and fell’d with the earliest, and in the first quarter of the\r\nincreasing moon, that so the successive shoot receive no prejudice:\r\nSome, before they fell, disbark their alders, and other trees; of which\r\nsee Cap. III. Book III. But there is yet another way of planting alders\r\nafter the Jersey manner, and as I receiv’d it from a most ingenious\r\ngentleman of that country, which is, by taking trunchions of two or\r\nthree foot long, at the beginning of Winter, and to bind them in\r\nfaggots, and place the ends of them in water ’till towards the Spring,\r\nby which season they will have contracted a swelling spire, or knurr\r\nabout that part, which being set, does (like the gennet-moil apple-tree)\r\nnever fail of growing and striking root. There is a black sort more\r\naffected to woods, and drier grounds; and bears a black berry, not so\r\nfrequently found; yet growing somewhere about Hampsted, as the learned\r\nDr. Tan. Robinson observes.\r\n\r\n2. There are a sort of husbands who take excessive pains in stubbing up\r\ntheir alders, where-ever they meet them in the boggie places of their\r\ngrounds, with the same indignation as one would extirpate the most\r\npernicious of weeds; and when they have finished, know not how to\r\nconvert their best lands to more profit than this (seeming despicable)\r\nplant might lead them to, were it rightly understood. Besides, the\r\nshadow of this tree, does feed and nourish the very grass which grows\r\nunder it; and being set, and well plashed, is an excellent defence to\r\nthe banks of rivers; so as I wonder it is not more practis’d about the\r\nThames, to fortifie, and prevent the mouldring of the walls, and the\r\nviolent weather they are exposed to.\r\n\r\n3. You may cut aquatic-trees every third or fourth year, and some more\r\nfrequently, as I shall shew you hereafter. They should also be abated\r\nwithin half a foot of the principal head, to prevent the perishing of\r\nthe main stock; and besides, to accelerate their sprouting. In setting\r\nthe trunchions, it were not amiss to prepare them a little after they\r\nare fitted to the size, by laying them a while in water; this is also\r\npracticable in willows, &c.\r\n\r\n4. Of old they made boats of the greater parts of this tree, and\r\nexcepting Noah’s ark, the first vessels we read of, were made of this\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\n    When hollow alders first the waters try’d,{157:1}\r\n\r\n    And down the rapid Poe light alders glide.{157:2}\r\n\r\nAnd as then, so now, are over-grown alders frequently sought after, for\r\nsuch buildings as lie continually under water, where it will harden like\r\na very stone; whereas being kept in any unconstant temper, it rots\r\nimmediately, because its natural humidity is of so near affinity with\r\nits adventitious, as Scaliger assigns the cause. Vitruvius tells us,\r\nthat the morasses about Ravenna in Italy, were pil’d with this timber,\r\nto superstruct upon, and highly commends it. I find also they us’d it\r\nunder that famous Bridge at Venice, the _Rialto_, which passes over the\r\n_Gran-Canal_, bearing a vast weight. Jos. Bauhimus pretends, that in\r\ntract of time, it turns to stone; which perhaps it may seem to be (as\r\nwell as other aquatick) where it meets with some lapidescant quality in\r\nthe earth and water.\r\n\r\n5. The poles of alder are as useful as those of willows; but the coals\r\nfar exceed them, especially for gun-powder: The wood is likewise useful\r\nfor piles, pumps, hop-poles, water-pipes, troughs, sluces, small trays,\r\nand trenchers, wooden-heels; the bark is precious to dyers, and some\r\ntanners, and leather-dressers make use of it; and with it, and the\r\nfruits (instead of galls) they compose an ink. The fresh leaves alone\r\napplied to the naked soal of the foot, infinitely refresh the surbated\r\ntraveller. The bark macerated in water, with a little rust of iron,\r\nmakes a black dye, which may also be us’d for ink: The interior rind of\r\nthe black alder purges all hydropic, and serous humours; but it must be\r\ndry’d in the shade, and not us’d green, and the decoction suffer’d to\r\nsettle two or three days, before it be drunk.\r\n\r\nBeing beaten with vinegar, it heals the itch certainly: As to other uses\r\nthe swelling bunches, which are now and then found in the old trees,\r\nafford the inlayer pieces curiously chambletted, and very hard, _&c._\r\nbut the faggots better for the fire, than for the draining of grounds by\r\nplacing them (as the guise is) in the trenches; which old rubbish of\r\nflints, stones, and the like gross materials, does infinitely exceed,\r\nbecause it is for ever, preserves the drains hollow, and being a little\r\nmoulded over, will produce good grass, without any detriment to the\r\nground; but this is a secret, not yet well understood, and would merit\r\nan express paragraph, were it here seasonable,\r\n\r\n    ....._& jam nos inter opacas\r\n    Musa vocat salices_.......\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n{157:1}\r\n\r\n    Tunc alnos primum fluvii sensêre cavatas.\r\n\r\n    _Georg. 1._\r\n\r\n{157:2}\r\n\r\n    Nec non & torrentem undam levis innatat alnus\r\n    Missa Pado ............\r\n\r\n    2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n_Of the Withy, Sallow, Ozier, and Willow._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Salix_: Since Cato has attributed the third place to the _salictum_,\r\npreferring it even next to the very ortyard; and (what one would wonder\r\nat) before even the olive, meadow, or corn-field it self (for _salictum\r\ntertio loco, nempe post vineam, &c._) and that we find it so easily\r\nrais’d, of so great, and universal use, I have thought good to be the\r\nmore particular in my discourse upon it; especially, since so much of\r\nthat which I shall publish concerning them, is derived from the long\r\nexperience of a most learned and ingenious person, from whom I\r\nacknowledge to have received many of these hints. Not to perplex the\r\nreader with the various names, Greek, Gallic, Sabin, Amerine, Vitex, &c.\r\nbetter distinguish’d by their growth and bark; and by Latin authors all\r\ncomprehended under that of _salices_; our English books reckon them\r\npromiscuously thus; the common-white willow, the black, and the\r\nhard-black, the rose of Cambridge, the black-withy, the round-long\r\nsallow; the longest sallow, the crack-willow, the round-ear’d shining\r\nwillow, the lesser broad-leav’d willow, silver sallow, upright\r\nbroad-willow, repent broad-leav’d, the red-stone, the lesser willow, the\r\nstrait-dwarf, the long-leav’d yellow sallow, the creeper, the black-low\r\nwillow, the willow-bay, and the ozier. I begin with the withy.\r\n\r\n2. The withy is a reasonable large tree, (for some have been found ten\r\nfoot about) is fit to be planted on high banks, and ditch-sides within\r\nreach of water and the weeping sides of hills; because they extend their\r\nroots deeper than either sallows or willows. For this reason you shall\r\nplant them at ten, or twenty foot distance; and though they grow the\r\nslowest of all the twiggie trees, yet do they recompence it with the\r\nlarger crop; the wood being tough, and the twigs fit to bind strongly;\r\nthe very peelings of the branches being useful to bind arbor-poling, and\r\nin topiary-works, vine-yards, espalier-fruit, and the like: And we are\r\ntold of some that grow twisted into ropes of 120 paces, serving instead\r\nof cables. There are two principal sorts of these withies, the hoary,\r\nand the red-withy, (which is the Greek) toughest, and fittest to bind,\r\nwhilst the twigs are flexible and tender.\r\n\r\n3. Sallows grow much faster, if they are planted within reach of water,\r\nor in a very moorish ground, or flat plain; and where the soil is (by\r\nreason of extraordinary moisture) unfit for arable, or meadow; for in\r\nthese cases, it is an extraordinary improvement: In a word, where birch\r\nand alder will thrive. Before you plant them, it is found best to turn\r\nthe ground with a spade; especially, if you design them for a flat. We\r\nhave three sorts of sallows amongst us, (which is one more than the\r\nancients challeng’d, who name only the black and white, which was their\r\n_nitellina_) the vulgar round leav’d, which proves best in dryer banks,\r\nand the hopping-sallows, which require a moister soil, growing with\r\nincredible celerity: And a third kind, of a different colour from the\r\nother two, having the twigs reddish, the leaf not so long, and of a more\r\ndusky green; more brittle whilst it is growing in twigs, and more tough\r\nwhen arriv’d to a competent size: All of them useful for the thatcher.\r\n\r\n4. Of these, the hopping-sallows are in greatest esteem, being of a\r\nclearer terse grain, and requiring a more succulent soil; best planted a\r\nfoot deep, and a foot and half above ground (though some will allow but\r\na foot) for then every branch will prove excellent for future setlings.\r\nAfter three years growth (being cropped the second and third) the first\r\nyears increase will be ’twixt eight and twelve foot long generally; the\r\nthird years growth, strong enough to make rakes and pike-staves; and the\r\nfourth for Mr. Blithe’s trenching plow, and other like utensils of the\r\nhusbandman.\r\n\r\n5. If ye plant them at full height (as some do at four years growth,\r\nsetting them five or six foot length, to avoid the biting of cattel)\r\nthey will be less useful for streight staves, and for setlings, and make\r\nless speed in their growth; yet this also is a considerable improvement.\r\n\r\n6. These would require to be planted at least five foot distance, (some\r\nset them as much more) and in the _quincunx_ order: If they affect the\r\nsoil, the leaf will come large, half as broad as a man’s hand, and of a\r\nmore vivid green, always larger the first year, than afterwards: Some\r\nplant them sloping, and cross-wise like a hedge, but this impedes their\r\nwonderful growth; and (though Pliny seems to commend it, teaching us how\r\nto excorticate some places of each set, for the sooner production of\r\nshoots) it is but a deceitful fence, neither fit to keep out swine nor\r\nsheep; and being set too near, inclining to one another, they soon\r\ndestroy each other.\r\n\r\n7. The worst sallows may be planted so near yet, as to be instead of\r\nstakes in a hedge, and then their tops will supply their dwarfishness;\r\nand to prevent hedge-breakers, many do thus plant them; because they\r\ncannot easily be pull’d up, after once they have struck root.\r\n\r\n8. If some be permitted to wear their tops five or six years, their\r\npalms will be very ample, and yield the first and most plentiful relief\r\nto bees, even before our abricots blossom. The hopping-sallows open, and\r\nyield their palms before other sallows, and when they are blown (which\r\nis about the _exit_ of May, or sometimes June) the palms (or\r\nὠλεσίκαρποι _frugiperdæ_, as Homer terms them for their extream\r\nlevity) are four inches long, and full of a fine lanuginous cotton. Of\r\nthis sort, there is a _salix_ near Dorking in Surrey, in which the\r\n_julus_ bears a thick cottonous substance. A poor body might in an\r\nhour’s space, gather a pound or two of it, which resembling the finest\r\nsilk, might doubtless be converted to some profitable use, by an\r\ningenious house-wife, if gather’d in calm evenings, before the wind,\r\nrain and dew impair them; I am of opinion, if it were dry’d with care,\r\nit might be fit for cushions, and pillows of chastity, for such of old\r\nwas the reputation of the shade of those trees.\r\n\r\n9. Of these hopping sallows, after three years rooting, each plant will\r\nyield about a score of staves, of full eight foot in length, and so\r\nfollowing, for use, as we noted above: Compute then how many fair\r\npike-staves, perches, and other useful materials, that will amount to in\r\nan acre, if planted at five foot interval: But a fat and moist soil,\r\nrequires indeed more space, than a lean or dryer; namely, six or eight\r\nfoot distance.\r\n\r\n10. You may plant setlings of the very first years growth; but the\r\nsecond year they are better, and the third year, better than the second;\r\nand the fourth, as good as the third; especially, if they approach the\r\nwater. A bank at a foot distance from the water, is kinder for them\r\nthan a bog, or to be altogether immers’d in the water.\r\n\r\n11. ’Tis good to new-mould them about the roots every second, or third\r\nyear; but men seldom take the pains. It seems that sallows are more\r\nhardy, than even willows and oziers, of which Columella takes as much\r\ncare as of vines themselves. But ’tis cheaper to supply the vacuity of\r\nsuch accidental decays, by a new plantation, than to be at the charge of\r\ndigging about them three times a year, as that author advises; seeing\r\nsome of them will decay, whatever care be used.\r\n\r\n12. Sallows may also be propagated like vines, by courbing, and bowing\r\nthem in arches, and covering some of their parts with mould, &c. Also by\r\ncuttings and layers, and some years by the seeds likewise.\r\n\r\n13. For setlings, those are to be preferr’d which grow nearest to the\r\nstock, and so (consequently) those worst, which most approach the top.\r\nThey should be planted in the first fair and pleasant weather in\r\nFebruary, before they begin to bud; we about London begin at the latter\r\nend of December. They may be cut in Spring for fuel, but best in Autumn\r\nfor use; but in this work (as of poplar) leave a twig or two; which\r\nbeing twisted archwise, will produce plentiful sprouts, and suddenly\r\nfurnish a head.\r\n\r\n14. If in our copp’ces one in four were a sallow set, amongst the rest\r\nof varieties, the profit would recompence the care; therefore where in\r\nwoods you grub up trees, thrust in trunchions of sallows, or some\r\naquatic kind. In a word, an acre or two furnish’d with this tree, would\r\nprove of great benefit to the planter.\r\n\r\n15. The swift growing sallow is not so tough and hardy for some uses as\r\nthe slower, which makes stocks for gard’ners spades; but the other are\r\nproper for rakes, pikes, mops, &c. Sallow-coal is the soonest consum’d;\r\nbut of all others, the most easie and accommodate for painters\r\nscribbets, to design their work, and first sketches on paper with, &c.\r\nas being fine, and apt to slit into pencils.\r\n\r\n16. To conclude, there is a way of graffing a sallow-trunchion; take it\r\nof two foot and half long, as big as your wrist; graff at both ends a\r\nfig, and mulberry-cyon of a foot long, and so, without claying, set the\r\nstock so far into the ground, as the plant may be three or four inches\r\nabove the earth: This (some affirm) will thrive exceedingly the first\r\nyear, and in three, be fit to transplant. The season for this curiosity\r\nis February. Of the sallow (as of the lime-tree) is made the\r\nshooe-maker’s carving or cutting-board, as best to preserve the edge of\r\ntheir knives, for its equal softness every way.\r\n\r\n17. Oziers, or the aquatick and lesser _salix_, are of innumerable\r\nkinds, commonly distinguish’d from sallows, as sallows are from withies;\r\nbeing so much smaller than the sallow, and shorter liv’d, and requiring\r\nmore constant moisture, yet would be planted in rather a dryish ground,\r\nthan over moist and spewing, which we frequently cut trenches to avert.\r\nIt likewise yields more limber and flexible twigs for baskets, flaskets,\r\nhampers, cages, lattices, cradles, the bodies of coaches and wagons, for\r\nwhich ’tis of excellent use, light, durable, and neat, as it may be\r\nwrought and cover’d: for chairs, hurdles, stays, bands, the stronger for\r\nbeing contus’d and wreathed, &c. likewise for fish wairs, and to support\r\nthe banks of impetuous rivers: In fine, for all wicker and twiggy works:\r\n\r\n    _Viminibus salices_.............\r\n\r\n18. But these sort of oziers would be cut in the new shoot: For if they\r\nstand longer, they become more inflexible; cut them close to the head (a\r\nfoot, or so above earth) about the beginning of October; unless you will\r\nattend till the cold be past, which is better; and yet we about London,\r\ncut them in the most piercing seasons, and plant them also till\r\nCandlemas, which those who do not observe, we judge ill husbands, as I\r\nlearn from a very experienc’d basket-maker; and in the decrease, for the\r\nbenefit of the workman, though not altogether for that of the stock, and\r\nsucceeding shoot: When they are cut, make them up into bundles, and give\r\nthem shelter; but such as are for white-work (as they call it) being\r\nthus faggotted, and made up in bolts, as the term is, severing each sort\r\nby themselves, should be set in water, the ends dipped; and indeed all\r\npeel’d wares of the viminious kind, are not otherwise preserved from the\r\nworm; but for black and unpeel’d, shelter’d under covert only, or in\r\nsome vault or cellar, to keep them fresh, sprinkling them now and then\r\nin excessive hot weather: The peelings of the former, are for the use of\r\nthe gard’ner and cooper, or rather the splicings.\r\n\r\n19. We have in England these three vulgar sorts; one of little worth,\r\nbeing brittle, and very much resembling the fore-mentioned sallow, with\r\nreddish twigs, and more greenish and rounder leaves: Another kind there\r\nis, call’d perch, of limber and green twigs having a very slender leaf;\r\nthe third sort is totally like the second, only the twigs are not\r\naltogether so green, but yellowish, and near the popinjay: This is the\r\nvery best for use, tough and hardy. But the most usual names by which\r\nbasket-makers call them about London, and which are all of different\r\nspecies (therefore to be planted separately) are, the hard-gelster, the\r\nhorse-gelster, whyning or shrivell’d-gelster, the black-gelster, in\r\nwhich Suffolk abounds. Then follow the golstones, the hard and the soft\r\ngolstone, (brittle, and worst of all the golstones) the sharp and\r\nslender top’d yellow-golstone; the fine-golstone: Then is there the\r\nyellow ozier, the green ozier, the snake, or speckled ozier,\r\nswallow-tayl, and the Spaniard: To these we may add (amongst the number\r\nof oziers, for they are both govern’d and us’d alike) the\r\nFlanders-willow, which will arrive to be a large tree, as big as one’s\r\nmiddle, the oftner cut, the better: With these our coopers, tie their\r\nhoops to keep them bent. Lastly, the white-sallow; which being of a year\r\nor two growth, is us’d for green-work; and if of the toughest sort, to\r\nmake quarter-can-hoops, of which our seamen provide great quantities,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n20. These choicer sorts of oziers, which are ever the smallest, also the\r\ngolden-yellow, and white, which is preferr’d for propagation, and to\r\nbreed of, should be planted of slips of two or three years growth, a\r\nfoot deep, and half a yard length, in moorish grounds, or banks, or else\r\nin furrows; so that (as some direct) the roots may frequently reach the\r\nwater; for _fluminibus salices_.......... though we commonly find it\r\nrots them, and therefore never chuse to set them so deep as to scent it,\r\nand at three or four foot distance.\r\n\r\n21. The season for planting is January, and all February, though some\r\nnot till Mid-February, at two foot square; but cattle being excessively\r\nliquorish of their leaves and tender buds, some talk of a graffing them\r\nout of reach upon sallows, and by this, to advance their sprouting; but\r\nas the work would consume time, so have I never seen it succeed.\r\n\r\n22. Some do also plant oziers in their eights, like quick-sets, thick,\r\nand (near the water) keep them not more than half a foot above ground;\r\nbut then they must be diligently cleansed from moss, slab, and ouze, and\r\nfrequently prun’d (especially the smaller spires) to form single shoots;\r\nat least, that few, or none grow double; these they head every second\r\nyear about September, the autumnal cuttings being best for use: But\r\ngenerally\r\n\r\n23. You may cut withies, sallows and willows, at any mild and gentle\r\nseason, between leaf and leaf, even in Winter; but the most congruous\r\ntime both to plant and to cut them, is _crescente luna vere, circa\r\ncalendas Martias_; that is, about the new moon, and first open weather\r\nof the early Spring.\r\n\r\n24. It is in France, upon the Loire, where these eights (as we term\r\nthem) and plantations of oziers and withies are perfectly understood;\r\nand both there, and in divers other countries beyond seas, they raise\r\nthem of seeds contain’d in their _juli_, or catkins, which they sow in\r\nfurrows, or shallow trenches, and it springs up like corn in the blade,\r\nand comes to be so tender and delicate, that they frequently mow them\r\nwith a scyth: This we have attempted in England too, even in the place\r\nwhere I live, but the obstinate and unmerciful weed did so confound\r\nthem, that it was impossible to keep them clean with any ordinary\r\nindustry, and so they were given over: It seems either weeds grow not so\r\nfast in other countries, or that the people (which I rather think) are\r\nmore patient and laborious.\r\n\r\nNote, that these _juli_, are not all of them seed-bearers, some are\r\nsterile, and whatever you raise of them, will never come to bear; and\r\ntherefore by some they are called the male sort, as Mr. Ray (that\r\nlearned botanist) has observed. The ozier is of that emolument, that in\r\nsome places I have heard twenty pounds has been given for one acre; ten\r\nis in this part an usual price; and doubtless, it is far preferable to\r\nthe best corn-land; not only for that it needs but once planting, but\r\nbecause it yields a constant crop and revenue to the world’s end; and is\r\ntherefore in esteem of knowing persons, valu’d in purchase accordingly;\r\nconsider’d likewise how easily ’tis renew’d when a plant now and then\r\nfails, by but pricking in a twig of the next at hand, when you visit to\r\ncut them: We have in the parish near Greenwich, where I lately dwelt,\r\nimprov’d land from less than one pound, to near ten pounds the acre: And\r\nwhen we shall reflect upon the infinite quantities of them we yearly\r\nbring out of France and Flanders, to supply the extraordinary expence of\r\nbasket-work, &c. for the fruiterers, lime-burners, gardeners, coopers,\r\npackers-up of all sorts of ware, and for general carriage, which seldom\r\nlast above a journey or two, I greatly admire gentlemen do no more think\r\nof employing their moist grounds (especially, where tides near fresh\r\nrivers are reciprocal) in planting and propagating oziers. To omit\r\nnothing of the culture of this useful ozier, Pliny would have the place\r\nto be prepared by trenching it a foot and half deep, and in that, to fix\r\nthe sets, or cuttings of the same length at six foot interval. These (if\r\nthe sets be large) will come immediately to be trees; which after the\r\nfirst three years, are to be abated within two foot of the ground. Then\r\nin April he advises to dig about them: Some raise them abundantly, by\r\nlaying poles of them in a boggy earth only: Of these they formerly made\r\nvine-props, _juga_, as Pliny calls them, for archwise bending and\r\nyoaking, as it were, the branches to one another; and one acre hath been\r\nknown to yield props sufficient to serve a vine-yard of 25 acres.\r\n\r\n25. John Tradescant brought a small ozier from S. Omers in Flanders,\r\nwhich makes incomparable net-works, not much inferior to the Indian\r\ntwig, or bent-works which we have seen; but if we had them in greater\r\nabundance, we should haply want the artificers who could employ them,\r\nand the dexterity to vernish so neatly.\r\n\r\n26. Our common _salix_, or willow, is of two kinds, the white and the\r\nblack: The white is also of two sorts, the one of a yellowish, the other\r\nof a browner bark: The black willow is planted of stakes, of three years\r\ngrowth, taken from the head of an old tree, before it begins to sprout:\r\nSet them of six foot high, and ten distant; as directed for the poplar.\r\nThose woody sorts of willow, delight in meads and ditch-sides, rather\r\ndry, than over-wet (for they love not to wet their feet, and last the\r\nlonger) yet the black sort, and the reddish, do sometimes well in more\r\nboggy grounds, and would be planted of stakes as big as one’s leg, cut\r\nas the other, at the length of five or six foot or more into the earth;\r\nthe hole made with an oaken-stake and beetle, or with an iron crow (some\r\nuse a long auger) so as not to be forced in with too great violence: But\r\nfirst, the trunchions should be a little stop’d at both extreams, and\r\nthe biggest planted downwards: To this, if they are soaked in water two\r\nor three days (after they have been siz’d for length, and the twigs cut\r\noff ere you plant them) it will be the better. Let this be done in\r\nFebruary, the mould as well clos’d to them as possible, and treated as\r\nwas taught in the poplar. If you plant for a kind of wood, or copp’ce\r\n(for such I have seen) set them at six foot distance, or nearer, in the\r\n_quincunx_, and be careful to take away all suckers from them at three\r\nyears end: You may abate the head half a foot from the trunk, _viz._\r\nthree or four of the lustiest shoots, and the rest cut close, and bare\r\nthem yearly, that the three, four or more you left, may enjoy all the\r\nsap, and so those which were spared, will be gallant pearches within two\r\nyears. Arms of four years growth, will yield substantial sets, to be\r\nplanted at eight or ten foot distance; and for the first three years\r\nwell defended from the cattle, who infinitely delight in their leaves,\r\ngreen, or wither’d. Thus, a willow may continue twenty, or five and\r\ntwenty years, with good profit to the industrious planter, being headed\r\nevery four or five years; some have been known to shoot no less than\r\ntwelve foot in one year, after which, the old, rotten dotards may be\r\nfell’d, and easily supply’d. But if you have ground fit for whole\r\ncopp’ces of this wood, cast it into double dikes, making every foss near\r\nthree foot wide, two and half in depth; then leaving four foot at least\r\nof ground for the earth (because in such plantations the moisture should\r\nbe below the roots, that they may rather see, than feel the water) and\r\ntwo tables of sets on each side, plant the ridges of these banks with\r\nbut one single table, longer and bigger than the collateral, _viz._\r\nthree, four, five or six foot high, and distant from each other, about\r\ntwo yards. These banks being carefully kept weeded for the first two\r\nyears, till the plants have vanquish’d the grass, and not cut till the\r\nthird; you may then lop them traverse, and not obliquely, at one foot\r\nfrom the ground, or somewhat more, and they will head to admiration; but\r\nsuch which are cut at three foot height, are most durable, as least soft\r\nand aquatick: They may also be graffed ’twixt the bark, or budded; and\r\nthen they become so beautiful, as to be fit for some kind of delightful\r\nwalks; and this I wish were practis’d among such as are seated in low\r\nand marshy places, not so friendly to other trees. Every acre at eleven\r\nor twelve years growth, may yield you near a hundred load of wood: Cut\r\nthem in the Spring for dressing, but in the Fall for timber and fuel: I\r\nhave been inform’d, that a gentleman in Essex, has lopp’d no less than\r\n2000 yearly, all of his own planting. It is far the sweetest of all our\r\nEnglish fuel, (ash not excepted) provided it be sound and dry, and\r\nemitting little smoak, is the fittest for ladies chambers; and all those\r\nwoods and twigs would be cut either to plant, work with, or burn in the\r\ndryest time of the day.\r\n\r\nTo confirm what we have advanc’d in relation to the profit which may be\r\nmade by this husbandry, see what comes to me from a worthy person whom\r\nwe shall have occasion to mention, with great respect, in the next\r\nchapter, when we speak of quicksets.\r\n\r\nThe considerable improvement which may be made in common fields, as well\r\nas inclosed grounds, he demonstrates by a little spot of meadow, of\r\nabout a rod and half; part of which being planted about 50 years since\r\nwith willows (in a clump not exceeding four pole in length, on one side\r\nabout 12) several of them at the first and second lopping, being left\r\nwith a strait top, run up like elms, to 30 or 40 foot in height; which\r\nsome years since yielded boards of 14 or 15 inches broad as good for\r\nflooring, and other purposes within doors, as deals, last as long, work\r\nfiner, white and beautiful: ’tis indeed a good while since they were\r\nplanted, but it seems the crop answer’d this patience, when he cut up as\r\nmany of them (the year 1700) as were well worth 10l. And since that\r\nanother tree, for which a joyner offer’d him as much for those were\r\nleft, which was more by half than the whole ground it self was worth; so\r\nas having made 20l. of the spot, he still possesses it without much\r\ndamage to the grass. The method of planting was first by making holes\r\nwith an iron crow, and widening them with a stake of wood, fit to\r\nreceive a lusty plant, and sometimes boaring the ground with an auger;\r\nbut neither of these succeeding, (by reason the earth could not be\r\nramm’d so close to the sides and bottom of the sets, as was requisite to\r\nkeep them steady, and seclude the air, which would corrupt and kill the\r\nroots) he caus’d holes, or little pits of a foot square and depth to be\r\ndug, and then making a hole with the crow in the bottom of the pits, to\r\nreceive the set, and breaking the turf which came out of it, ramm’d it\r\nin with the mould close to the sets (as they would do to fix a\r\ngate-post) with great care not to gall the bark of it. He had divers\r\ntimes before this miscarry’d, when he us’d formerly to set them in plain\r\nground, without breaking the surface, and laying it close to the sets;\r\nand therefore, if the soil be moist, he digs a trench by the side of the\r\nrow, and applies the mould which comes out of it about the sets; so that\r\nthe edge of the bank raised by it, may be somewhat higher than the earth\r\nnext the set, for the better descent of the rain, and advantage of\r\nwatering the sets in dry weather; preventing likewise their rooting in\r\nthe bank, which they would do if the ground next the plant or set were\r\nmade high, and sloped; and being left unfenc’d, cattel would tread down\r\nthe bank, and lay the roots bare: The ground should therefore not be\r\nraised above 2 or 3 inches towards the body of the set. Now if the\r\nground be dry, and want moisture, he chuses to bank them round, (as I\r\nhave described it in my _Pomona_, cap. VII.) the fosses environing the\r\nmound and hillock, being reserves for the rain, cools and refreshes the\r\nsets.\r\n\r\nHe farther instances, that willows of about 20 years growth, have been\r\nworth 30s. and another sold for 3l. which was well worth 5l. and\r\naffirms, that the willows planted in beds, between double ditches, in\r\nboggy ground, may be fit to be cut every five years, and pay as well as\r\nthe best meadow-pasture, which is of extraordinary improvement.\r\n\r\n27. There is a sort of willow of a slender and long leaf, resembling the\r\nsmaller ozier; but rising to a tree as big as the sallow, full of knots,\r\nand of a very brittle spray, only here rehears’d to acknowledge the\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\n28. There is likewise the garden-willow, which produces a sweet and\r\nbeautiful flower, fit to be admitted into our hortulan ornaments, and\r\nmay be set for partitions of squares; but they have no affinity with\r\nother. There is also in Shropshire another very odoriferous kind,\r\nextreamly fit to be planted by pleasant rivulets, both for ornament and\r\nprofit: It is propagated by cuttings or layers, and will grow in any dry\r\nbottom, so it be sheltred from the south, affording a wonderful and\r\nearly relief to the industrious bee: Vitruvius commends the _vitex_ of\r\nthe Latines (impertinently called _agnus castus_, the one being but the\r\ninterpretation of the other) as fit for building; I suppose they had a\r\nsort of better stature than the shrub growing among the curious with us,\r\nand which is celebrated for its chast effects, and for which the\r\nAncients employ’d it in the rites of Ceres: I rather think it more\r\nconvenient for the sculptor (which he likewise mentions) provided we may\r\n(with safety) restore the text, as Perrault has attempted, by\r\nsubstituting _lævitatem_, for the author’s _regiditatem_ stubborn\r\nmaterials being not so fit for that curious art.\r\n\r\n29. What most of the former enumerated kinds differ from the sallows, is\r\nindeed not much considerable, they being generally useful for the same\r\npurposes; as boxes, such as apothecaries and goldsmiths use; for\r\ncart-saddle-trees, yea gun-stocks, and half-pikes, harrows, shooe-makers\r\nlasts, heels, clogs for pattens, forks, rakes, especially the tooths,\r\nwhich should be wedged with oak; but let them not be cut for this when\r\nthe sap is stirring, because they will shrink; pearches, rafters for\r\nhovels, portable and light laders, hop-poles, ricing of kidney-beans,\r\nand for supporters to vines, when our English vineyards come more in\r\nrequest: Also for hurdles, sieves, lattices; for the turner, kyele-pins,\r\ngreat town-tops; for platters, little casks and vessels; especially to\r\npreserve verjuices in, the best of any: Pales are also made of cleft\r\nwillow, dorsers, fruitbaskets, canns, hives for bees, trenchers, trays,\r\nand for polishing and whetting table-knives, the butler will find it\r\nabove any wood or whet-stone; also for coals, bavin, and excellent\r\nfiring, not forgetting the fresh boughs, which of all the trees in\r\nnature, yield the most chast and coolest shade in the hottest season of\r\nthe day; and this umbrage so wholsome, that physicians prescribe it to\r\nfeaverish persons, permitting them to be plac’d even about their beds,\r\nas a safe and comfortable _refrigerium_. The wood being preserved dry,\r\nwill dure a very long time; but that which is found wholly putrified,\r\nand reduc’d to a loamy earth in the hollow trunks of superannuated\r\ntrees, is, of all other, the fittest to be mingled with fine mould, for\r\nthe raising our choicest flowers, such as anemonies, ranunculus’s,\r\nauriculas, and the like.\r\n\r\n    What would we more? low broom, and sallows wild,\r\n    Or feed the flock, or shepherds shade, or field\r\n    Hedges about, or do us honey yield.{175:1}\r\n\r\n30. Now by all these plantations of the aquatick trees, it is evident,\r\nthe lords of moorish commons, and unprofitable wasts, may learn some\r\nimprovement, and the neighbour bees be gratified; and many tools of\r\nhusbandry become much cheaper. I conclude with the learned Stephanus’s\r\nnote upon these kind of trees, after he has enumerated the universal\r\nbenefit of the _salictum_: _nullius enim tutior reditus, minorisve\r\nimpendii, aut tempestatis securior_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n{175:1}\r\n\r\n    Quid majora sequor? Salices, humilesque genistæ,\r\n    Aut illæ pecori frondem, aut pastoribus umbram\r\n    Sufficiunt, sepemque satis & pabula melli.\r\n\r\n    _Georg. 2._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n_Of Fences, Quick-sets, &c._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Our main plantation is now finish’d, and our forest adorned with a\r\njust variety: But what is yet all this labour, but loss of time, and\r\nirreparable expence, unless our young, and (as yet) tender plants be\r\nsufficiently guarded with munitions from all external injuries? For, as\r\nold Tusser,\r\n\r\n    IF CATTEL, OR TONY MAY ENTER TO CROP,\r\n    YOUNG OAK IS IN DANGER OF LOSING HIS TOP.\r\n\r\nBut with something a more polish’d stile, though to the same purpose,\r\nthe best of poets,\r\n\r\n    Plash fences thy plantation round about,\r\n    And whilst yet young, be sure keep Cattel out;\r\n    Severest Winters, scorching sun infest,\r\n    And sheep, goats, bullocks, all young plants molest;\r\n    Yet neither cold, nor the hoar rigid frost,\r\n    Nor heat reflecting from the rocky coast,\r\n    Like cattel trees, and tender shoots confound,\r\n    When with invenom’d teeth the twigs they wound.{176:1}\r\n\r\n2. For the reason that so many complain of the improsperous condition of\r\ntheir wood-lands, and plantations of this kind, proceeds from this\r\nneglect; though (sheep excepted) there is no employment whatsoever\r\nincident to the farmer, which requires less expence to gratifie their\r\nexpectations: One diligent and skilful man, will govern five hundred\r\nacres: But if through any accident a beast shall break into his master’s\r\nfield; or the wicked hunter make a cap for his dogs and horses, what a\r\nclamour is there made for the disturbance of a years crop at most in a\r\nlittle corn! whilst abandoning his young woods all this time, and\r\nperhaps many years, to the venomous bitings and treading of cattel, and\r\nother like injuries (for want of due care) the detriment is many times\r\nirreparable; young trees once cropp’d, hardly ever recovering: It is the\r\nbane of all our most hopeful timber.\r\n\r\n3. But shall I provoke you by an instance? A kinsman of mine has a wood\r\nof more than 60 years standing; it was, before he purchas’d it, expos’d\r\nand abandon’d to the cattel for divers years: Some of the outward skirts\r\nwere nothing save shrubs and miserable starvlings; yet still the place\r\nwas dispos’d to grow woody; but by this neglect continually suppress’d.\r\nThe industrious gentleman has fenced in some acres of this, and cut all\r\nclose to the ground; it is come in eight or nine years, to be better\r\nworth than the wood of sixty; and will (in time) prove most incomparable\r\ntimber, whilst the other part (so many years advanc’d) shall never\r\nrecover; and all this from no other cause, than preserving it fenc’d:\r\nJudge then by this, how our woods come to be so decryed: Are five\r\nhundred sheep worthy the care of a shepherd? and are not five thousand\r\noaks worth the fencing, and the inspection of a Hayward?\r\n\r\n    And shall men doubt to plant, and careful be?{177:1}\r\n\r\nLet us therefore shut up what we have thus laboriously planted, with\r\nsome good quick-set hedge; which,\r\n\r\n    .......All countries bear, in every ground\r\n    As denizen, or interloper found:\r\n    From gardens and till’d fields expell’d, yet there,\r\n    On the extreams stands up, and claims a share.\r\n    Nor mastiff-dog, nor pike-man can be found\r\n    A better fence to the enclosed ground.\r\n    Such breed the rough and hardy Cantons rear,\r\n    And into all adjacent lands prefer,\r\n    Though rugged churles, and for the battle fit;\r\n    Who courts and states with complement or wit,\r\n    To civilize, nor to instruct pretend;\r\n    But with stout faithful service to defend.\r\n    This tyrants know full well, nor more confide\r\n    On guards that serve less for defence than pride:\r\n    Their persons safe they do not judge amiss,\r\n    And realms committed to their guard of Swiss.{177:2}\r\n\r\nFor so the ingenious poet has metamorphos’d him, and I could not\r\nwithstand him.\r\n\r\n4. The haw-thorn, (_oxyacantha vulgaris_) and indeed the very best of\r\ncommon hedges, is either rais’d of seeds or plants; but then it must not\r\nbe with despair, because sometimes you do not see them peep the first\r\nyear; for the haw, and many other seeds, being invested with a very hard\r\nintegument, will now and then suffer imprisonment two whole years under\r\nthe earth; and our impatience at this, does often fustrate the\r\nresurrection of divers seeds of this nature; so that we frequently dig\r\nup, and disturb the beds where they have been sown, in despair, before\r\nthey have gone their full time; which is also the reason of a very\r\npopular mistake in other seeds; especially, that of the holly,\r\nconcerning which there goes a tradition, that they will not sprout till\r\nthey be pass’d through the maw of a thrush; whence the saying, _turdus\r\nexitium suum cacat_ (alluding to the _viscus_ made thereof, not the\r\nmisselto of oak) but this is an error, as I am able to testifie on\r\nexperience; they come up very well of the Berries, treated as I have\r\nshew’d in chap. 26. and with patience; for (as I affirm’d) they will\r\nsleep sometimes two entire years in their graves; as will also the seeds\r\nof yew, sloes, _phillyrea angustifolia_, and sundry others, whose shells\r\nare very hard about the small kernels; but which is wonderfully\r\nfacilitated, by being (as we directed) prepar’d in beds, and magazines\r\nof earth, or sand for a competent time, and then committed to the ground\r\nbefore the full in March, by which season they will be chitting, and\r\nspeedily take root: Others bury them deep in the ground all Winter, and\r\nsow them in February: And thus I have been told of a gentleman who has\r\nconsiderably improv’d his revenue, by sowing haws only, and raising\r\nnurseries of quick-sets, which he sells by the hundred far and near:\r\nThis is a commendable industry; any neglected corners of ground will fit\r\nthis plantation. Or were such places plow’d in furrow about the ground,\r\nyou would fence, and sow’d with the mark of the cyder-press,\r\ncrab-kernels, &c. kept secure from cattel till able to defend it self;\r\nit would yield excellent stocks to graff and transplant: And thus any\r\nlarger plot, by plowing and cross-plowing the ground, and sowing it with\r\nall sorts of forest-seeds; breaking and harrowing the clods, and\r\ncleansing it from weeds with the haugh, (till the plants over-top them)\r\na very profitable grove may be rais’d, and yield magazin of singular\r\nadvantage, to furnish the industrious planter.\r\n\r\n5. But Columella has another expedient for the raising of our\r\n_spinetum_, by rubbing the now mature hips and haws, ashen-keys, &c.\r\ninto the crevices of bass-ropes, or wisps of straw, and then burying\r\nthem in a trench: Whether way you attempt it, they must (so soon as they\r\npeep, and as long as they require it) be sedulously cleans’d of the\r\nweeds; which, if in beds for transplantation, had need be at the least\r\nthree or four years; by which time even your seedlings will be of\r\nstature fit to remove; for I do by no means approve of the vulgar\r\npræmature planting of sets, as is generally us’d throughout England;\r\nwhich is to take such only as are the very smallest, and so to crowd\r\nthem into three or four files, which are both egregious mistakes.\r\n\r\n6. Whereas it is found by constant experience, that plants as big as\r\nones thumb, set in the posture, and at the distance which we spake of in\r\nthe horn-beam; that is, almost perpendicular (not altogether, because\r\nthe rain should not get in ’twixt the rind and wood) and single, or at\r\nmost, not exceeding a double row, do prosper infinitely, and much\r\nout-strip the densest and closest ranges of our trifling sets, which\r\nmake but weak shoots, and whose roots do but hinder each other, and for\r\nbeing couch’d in that posture, on the sides of banks, and fences\r\n(especially where the earth is not very tenacious) are bared of the\r\nmould which should entertain them, by that time the rains and storms of\r\none Winter have passed over them. In Holland and Flanders, (where they\r\nhave the goodliest hedges of this kind about the counterscarps of their\r\ninvincible fortifications, to the great security of their musketiers\r\nupon occasion) they plant them according to my description, and raise\r\nfences so speedily, and so impenetrable, that our best are not to enter\r\ninto the comparison. Yet, that I may not be wanting to direct such as\r\neither affect the other way, or whose grounds may require some bank of\r\nearth, as ordinarily the verges of copp’ces, and other inclosures do;\r\nyou shall by line, cast up your foss of about three foot broad, and\r\nabout the same depth, provided your mould hold it; beginning first to\r\nturn the turf, upon which, be careful to lay some of the best earth to\r\nbed your quick in, and there lay, or set the plants; two in a foot space\r\nis sufficient; being diligent to procure such as are fresh gathered,\r\nstreight, smooth, and well rooted; adding now and then, at equal spaces\r\nof twenty or thirty foot, a young oakling or elm-sucker, ash, or the\r\nlike, which will come in time (especially in plain countries) to be\r\nornamental standards, and good timber: If you will needs multiply your\r\nrowes, a foot or somewhat less: Above that, upon more congested mould,\r\nplant another rank of sets, so as to point just in the middle of the\r\nvacuities of the first, which I conceive enough: This is but for the\r\nsingle foss; but if you would fortifie it to the purpose, do as much on\r\nthe other side, of the same depth, height, and planting; and then last\r\nof all, cap the top in _pyramis_ with the worst, or bottom of the ditch:\r\nSome, if the mould be good, plant a row or two on the edge, or very\r\ncrest of the mound, which ought to be a little flatned: Here also may\r\nthey set their dry-hedges, for hedges must be hedg’d till they are able\r\nto defend and shade their under-plantation, and I cannot reprove it: But\r\ngreat care is to be had in this work, that the main bank be well\r\nfooted, and not made with too sudden a declivity, which is subject to\r\nfall-in after frosts and wet weather; and this is good husbandry for\r\nmoist grounds; but where the land lies high, and is hot and gravelly, I\r\nprefer the lower fencing; which, though even with the area it self, may\r\nbe protected with stakes and a dry hedge, on the fosse side, the\r\ndistance competent, and to very good purposes of educating more frequent\r\ntimber amongst the rows.\r\n\r\n7. Your hedge being yet young, should be constantly weeded two or three\r\nyears, especially before Midsummer (of brambles especially, the great\r\ndock, and thistle, &c.) though some admit not of this work till after\r\nMichaelmas, for reasons that I approve not: It has been the practice of\r\nHerefordshire, in the plantation of quick-set-hedges, to plant a\r\ncrab-stock at every twenty foot distance; and this they observe so\r\nreligiously, as if they had been under some rigorous statute requiring\r\nit: But by this means they were provided in a short time with all\r\nadvantages for the graffing of fruit amongst them, which does highly\r\nrecompence their industry. Some cut their sets at three years growth\r\neven to the very ground, and find that in a year or two it will have\r\nshot as much as in seven, had it been let alone.\r\n\r\n8. When your hedge is now of near six years stature, plash it about\r\nFebruary or October; but this is the work of a very dextrous and skilful\r\nhusbandman; and for which our honest countrey-man Mr. Markam gives\r\nexcellent directions; only I approve not so well of his deep cutting, if\r\nit be possible to bend it, having suffered in something of that kind: It\r\nis almost incredible to what perfection some have laid these hedges, by\r\nthe rural way of plashing, better than by clipping; yet may both be used\r\nfor ornament, as where they are planted about our garden-fences, and\r\nfields near the mansion. In Scotland, by tying the young shoots with\r\nbands of hay, they make the stems grow so very close together, as that\r\nit encloseth rabbets in warrens instead of pales: And for this robust\r\nuse we shall prefer the blackthorn; the extravagant suckers which are\r\napt to rise at distance from the hedge-line, being sedulously\r\nextirpated, that the rest may grow the stronger and thicker.\r\n\r\n9. And now since I did mention it, and that most I find do greatly\r\naffect the vulgar way of quicking (that this our discourse be in nothing\r\ndeficient) we will in brief give it you again after George Markham’s\r\ndescription, because it is the best, and most accurate, although much\r\nresembling our former direction, of which it seems but a repetition,\r\n’till he comes to the plashing. In a ground which is more dry than wet\r\n(for watry places it abhors) plant your quick thus: Let the first row of\r\nsets be placed in a trench of about half a foot deep, even with the top\r\nof your ditch, in somewhat a sloping, or inclining posture; then, having\r\nrais’d your bank near a foot upon them, plant another row, so as their\r\ntops may just peep out over the middle of the spaces of your first row:\r\nThese cover’d again to the height or thickness of the other, place a\r\nthird rank opposite to the first, and then finish your bank to its\r\nintended height. The distances of the plants would not be above one\r\nfoot; and the season to do the work in, may be from the entry of\r\nFebruary, till the end of March; or else in September to the beginning\r\nof December. When this is finish’d, you must guard both the top of your\r\nbank, and outmost verge of your ditch, with a sufficient dry-hedge,\r\ninterwoven from stake to stake into the earth (which commonly they do on\r\nthe bank) to secure your quick from the spoil of cattle. And then being\r\ncareful to repair such as decay, or do not spring, by supplying the\r\ndead, and trimming the rest; you shall after three years growth sprinkle\r\nsome timber-trees amongst them; such as oak, beech, ash, maple, fruit,\r\nor the like; which being drawn young out of your nurseries, may be very\r\neasily inserted.\r\n\r\nI am not in the mean time ignorant of what is said against the\r\nscattering these masts and keys among our fences; which grown to\r\nover-top the subnascent hedge, may prejudice it with their shade and\r\ndrip: But this might be prevented by planting hollies (proof against\r\nthese impediments) in the line or trench, where you would raise\r\nstandards, as far as they usually spread in many years, and which, if\r\nplaced at good distances, how close soever to the stem, would (besides\r\ntheir stout defence) prove a wondrous decoration, to large and ample\r\nenclosures: But to resume our former work; that which we affirm’d to\r\nrequire the greatest dexterity, is, the artificial plashing of our\r\nhedge, when it is now arrived to a six, or seven years head; though some\r\nstay till the tenth, or longer. In February therefore, or October, with\r\na very sharp hand-bill, cut away all superfluous sprays and straglers,\r\nwhich may hinder your progress, and are useless. Then, searching out the\r\nprincipal stems, with a keen and light hatchet, cut them slant-wise\r\nclose to the ground, hardly three quarters through, or rather, so far\r\nonly, as till you can make them comply handsomely, which is your best\r\ndirection, (lest you rift the stem) and so lay it from your sloping as\r\nyou go, folding in the lesser branches which spring from them; and ever\r\nwithin a five or six foot distance, where you find an upright set\r\n(cutting off only the top to the height of your intended hedge) let it\r\nstand as a stake, to fortifie your work, and to receive the twinings of\r\nthose branches about it. Lastly, at the top (which would be about five\r\nfoot above ground) take the longest, most slender, and flexible twigs\r\nwhich you reserved (and being cut as the former, where need requires)\r\nbind-in the extremities of all the rest, and thus your work is finished:\r\nThis being done very close and thick, makes an impregnable hedge, in few\r\nyears; for it may be repeated as you see occasion; and what you so\r\ncut-away, will help to make your dry-hedges for your young plantations,\r\nor be profitable for the oven, and make good bavin. Namely, the\r\nextravagant side branches springing the more upright, ’till the newly\r\nwounded are healed. There are some yet who would have no stakes cut from\r\nthe trees, save here and there one; so as to leave half the head naked,\r\nand the other standing; since the over-hanging bows will kill what is\r\nunder them, and ruin the tree; so pernicious is this half-toping: But\r\nlet this be a total amputation for a new and lusty spring: There is\r\nnothing more prejudicial to subnascent young trees, than when newly\r\ntrim’d and prun’d, to have their (as yet raw) wounds poyson’d with\r\ncontinual dripping; as is well observed by Mr. Nourse: But this is meant\r\nof repairing decay’d hedges. For stakes in this work, oak is to be\r\npreferr’d, tho’ some will use elder, but it is not good; or the\r\nblackthorn, crab-tree, in moorish ground withy, ash, maple, hasel, not\r\nlasting, (which some make hedges of; but it being apt to the browsing\r\nof cattle, when the young shoots appeared, it does better in copp’ces)\r\nthe rest not lasting, should yet be driven well in at every yard of\r\ninterval both before, and after they are bound, till they have taken the\r\nhard earth, and are very fast; and even your plash’d-hedges, need some\r\nsmall thorns to be laid over, to protect the spring from cattle and\r\nsheep, ’till they are somewhat fortified; and the doubler the winding is\r\nlodg’d, the better; which should be beaten, and forced down together\r\nwith the stakes, as equally as may be. Note, that in sloping your\r\nwindings, if it be too low done (as very usually) it frequently\r\nmortifies the tops, therefore it ought to be so bent, as it may not\r\nimpede the mounting of the sap: If the plash be of a great, and\r\nextraordinary age, wind it at the neather boughs all together, and\r\ncutting the sets as directed, permit it rather to hang downwards a\r\nlittle, than rise too forwards; and then twist the branches into the\r\nwork, leaving a set free, and unconstrain’d at every yard space, besides\r\nsuch as will serve for stakes, abated to about five foot length (which\r\nis a competent stature for an hedge) and so let it stand. One shall\r\noften find in this work, especially in old neglected hedges, some great\r\ntrees, or stubs, that commonly make gaps for cattle: Such should be cut\r\nso near the earth, as till you can lay them thwart, that the top of one\r\nmay rest on the root or stub of the other, as far as they extend,\r\nstopping the cavities with its boughs and branches; and thus hedges\r\nwhich seem to consist but only of scrubby-trees and stumps, may be\r\nreduced to a tolerable fence: But in case it be superannuated, and very\r\nold, ’tis advisable to stub all up, being quite renewed, and well\r\nguarded. We have been the longer on these descriptions, because it is of\r\nmain importance, and that so few husband-men are so perfectly skill’d in\r\nit: But he that would be more fully satisfied, I would have to consult\r\nMr. Cook, chap. 32. or rather _instar omnium_ (and after all which has\r\nbeen said of this useful art of fencing) what I cannot without injury to\r\nthe publick, and ingratitude to the persons, (who do me the honour of\r\nimparting to me their experiences) but as freely communicate.\r\n\r\nIt is then from the Reverend Mr. Walker of Great-Billing near\r\nNorthampton, that (with several other particulars relating to our rural\r\nsubject) I likewise receive from that worthy gentleman Tho. Franklin of\r\nEcton, Esq; the following method of planting, and fencing with\r\nquick-sets; which we give you in his own words.\r\n\r\n     10. About 10 or 12 years since, I made some essays to set some\r\n     little clumps of hedges and trees, of about two pole in breadth,\r\n     and three in length: The out-fences ditch’d on the outside, but the\r\n     quick-sets in the inside of the bank, that the dead-hedges might\r\n     stand on the outside thereof; so that a small hedge of 18 or 20\r\n     inches high, made of small wood, the stakes not much bigger than a\r\n     man’s thumb, which (the banks being high) sufficiently defended\r\n     them for four years time, and were hedg’d with less than one load\r\n     of shreadings of willow-sets, which, (as my workmen told me) would\r\n     have requir’d 6 load of copp’ce-wood: But the next year after their\r\n     being planted, finding wast ground on the top of the bank of the\r\n     outer fence, between the dead-hedge and the quick, I put a foot-set\r\n     in the same space between the quick and the dead-hedge, which\r\n     prosper’d better than those planted in the side of the bank, after\r\n     the vulgar way, and hold it still. This put me upon thinking, that\r\n     a set cheaper and better of quick-fence, might possibly be found\r\n     out; and accordingly I made some tryals, with good success, (at\r\n     least better than the old way) tho’ not to my full satisfaction,\r\n     till I had perus’d Mr. Evelyn’s _Silva_, &c. The method I us’d, was\r\n     this: First I set out the ground for ditches and quick, in breadth\r\n     ten foot; then subdivided that by marking out 2 foot ½ on each\r\n     side (more or less, at pleasure) for the ditches, leaving 5 in the\r\n     middle between them: Then digging up two foot in the midst of that\r\n     5 foot, plant the sets in; tho’ it require more labour and charge,\r\n     I found it soon repay’d the cost. This done, I began to dig the\r\n     fosses, and to set up one row of turfs on the outside of the said\r\n     five foot; namely, one row on each side thereof, the green side\r\n     outmost, a little reclining, so as the grass might grow: After\r\n     this, returning to the place begun at, I ordered one of the men to\r\n     dig a spit of the under-turfmould, and lay it between the turfs,\r\n     plac’d edge-wise, as before describ’d, upon the 2 foot which was\r\n     purposely dug in the middle, and prepar’d for the sets, which the\r\n     planter sets with two quicks upon the surface of the earth, almost\r\n     upright, whilst another workman lays the mould forward, about 12\r\n     inches, and then sets two more, and so continues. Some there are\r\n     who plant three rows of sets about 8 inches interval; but I do not\r\n     approve it; for they choak one another. This finished, I order\r\n     another row of turfs to be plac’d on each side upon the top of the\r\n     former, and fill the vacuity between the sets and the turfs, as\r\n     high as their tops, always leaving the middle where the sets are\r\n     planted, hollow, and somewhat lower than the sides of the banks, by\r\n     8 or 10 inches, that the rain may descend to their roots, which is\r\n     of great advantage to their growth, and far better than by the old\r\n     way; where the banks too much sloping, the roots of the sets are\r\n     seldom wetted in an ordinary season, the Summer following; but\r\n     which if it prove dry, many of the sets perish, especially the late\r\n     planted: Whereas those which I planted in the latter end of April,\r\n     tho’ the Summer hapned to be somewhat dry, generally scap’d, very\r\n     few of them miscarrying. Now the planting thus advanc’d, the next\r\n     care is fencing; by setting an hedge of about 20 inches high upon\r\n     the top of the bank, on each side thereof, leaning a little outward\r\n     from the sets, which will protect them as well (if not better) than\r\n     a hedge of 3 foot, or four inches more, standing upon the surface\r\n     of the ground, which being rais’d with the turfs and sods about 20\r\n     inches, and the hedge about 20 inches more, will make 3 foot 4\r\n     inches; so as no cattle can approach the dead-hedge to prejudice\r\n     it, unless they set their feet in the ditch it self; which will be\r\n     at least a foot deep, and from the bottom of the fosse to the top\r\n     of the hedge, about 4 foot and ½, which they can hardly reach\r\n     over to crop the quick, as they might in the old way; and besides,\r\n     such an hedge will endure a year longer. I have at this present, an\r\n     hedge which has stood these 5 years; and tho’ 9 or 10 foot be\r\n     sufficient for both ditches and bank, yet where the ground is but\r\n     indifferent, ’tis better husbandry to take 12 foot, which will\r\n     allow of a bank at least 6 foot broad, and gives more scope to\r\n     place the dead hedges farther from the sets; and the ditches being\r\n     shallow, will in two years time, graze; tho’ I confine my self for\r\n     the most part to 9 or 10; because I would take off the only\r\n     objection of wasting ground by this way, should others follow it.\r\n     In reply to this, I affirm, that if you take 12 foot in breadth,\r\n     for ditch and bank, you wast more ground, than by the common way:\r\n     For in that a quick is rarely set, but there is 9 foot between the\r\n     dead hedges, which is entirely lost all the time of fencing: When\r\n     as with double ditches, there remains at least 18 inches on each\r\n     side where the turfs were set on edge, that bear more grass than\r\n     when it lay on the flat. ......... But admitting it did totally lay\r\n     wast 3 foot of ground, the damage were very inconsiderable, since\r\n     forty pearch, in lengh 220 yards, which makes pearches, 7, 25″, 9′,\r\n     or 7 pole ¼, which at 13 _shil._ 4 _pence_ the acre, amounts not\r\n     to 7d. ½ _per ann._ Now that this is not only the best and\r\n     cheapest way of quick-setting, will appear by comparing the charge\r\n     of both: In the usual way, the charge of a 3 foot ditch is 4d.\r\n     per pole, the owner providing sets; if the workman finds them, he\r\n     will have for making the said ditch, and setting them, 8d. the\r\n     pole, and for hedging, two pence; that is, for both sides 4d. the\r\n     pole, which renders the charge of hedging, ditching, and sets,\r\n     12d. the pole; that is, for forty rod in length, forty shillings:\r\n     Then one load of wood out of the copp’ce costs us, with the\r\n     carriage, (tho’ but two or 3 miles distance) ten shillings; which\r\n     will seldom hedge above 8 pole (single hedge.) But allowing it to\r\n     do ten, to fence 40 pole, there must be at least 8 load of wood,\r\n     which costs 4l. making the whole expence for ditching, setting,\r\n     and fencing of 40 pole, to be 6l. reck’ning with the least; for I\r\n     know not any that will undertake to do it under 3s. 6d. per\r\n     pole, and then the 40 pole costs 7l. Whereas, with double\r\n     ditches, both of them, setting and sets, will be done for 8d.\r\n     _per_ pole, and the husbandman get as good wages, as with a single\r\n     ditch, (for tho’ the labour about them is more, yet the making the\r\n     table is saved) which costs 1l. 6s. 8d. And the hedges being\r\n     but low, they’ll make better wages at hedging for a penny the pole,\r\n     than at two pence for common hedges; which comes to 6s. 8d. for\r\n     hedging forty pole on both sides: Thus one load of wood, will fence\r\n     30 pole at least, and 40 hedg’d with ⅔ of wood less, than in the\r\n     other way, and cost but 1l. 6s. 8d. which makes the whole\r\n     charge of sets, ditching, fencing, and wood, but three pounds.\r\n\r\n       l.   s.   d.\r\n       01   06   08\r\n       00   06   08\r\n       01   06   08\r\n       -------------\r\n       03   00   00\r\n       -------------\r\n\r\nHitherto this obliging and industrious gentleman.\r\n\r\n11. To other uses: The Root of an old thorn is excellent both for boxes\r\nand combs, and is curiously and naturally wrought: I have read, that\r\nthey made ribs to some small boats or vessels with the white-thorn, and\r\nit is certain, that if they would plant them single, and in standards,\r\nwhere they might be safe, they would rise into large body’d trees in\r\ntime, and be of excellent use for the turner, not inferior to box, and\r\naccounted among the fortunate trees, and therefore us’d in _fasces\r\nnuptiarum_, since the jolly shepherds carryed the white-thorn at the\r\nrapine of the Sabines; and ever since counted{192:1} propitious.\r\n\r\nThe distill’d water, and stone, or kernels of the haw reduc’d to powder,\r\nis generally agreed to be sovereign against the stone. The black-crab\r\nrightly season’d and treated, is famous for walking-staves, and if\r\nover-grown, us’d in mill-work; yea, and for rafters of great ships. Here\r\nwe owe due eulogy to the industry of the late Lord Shaftsbury, who has\r\ntaught us to make such enclosures of crab-stocks only, (planted close to\r\none another) as there is nothing more impregnable and becoming; or you\r\nmay sow cyder-kernels in a rill, and fence it for a while, with a double\r\ndry hedge, not only for a sudden and beautiful, but a very profitable\r\ninclosure; because, amongst other benefits, they will yield you\r\ncyderfruit in abundance: But in Devonshire, they build two walls with\r\ntheir stones, setting them edge-ways, two, and then one between; and so\r\nas it rises, fill the interval, or _cofer_ with earth (the breadth and\r\nheight as you please) and continuing the stone-work, and filling, and as\r\nyou work, beating in the stones flat to the sides, they are made to\r\nstick everlastingly: This is absolutely the neatest, most saving, and\r\nprofitable fencing imaginable, where slaty stones are in any abundance;\r\nand it becomes not only the most secure to the lands, but the best for\r\ncattle, to lye warm under the walls; whilst other hedges, (be they never\r\nso thick) admit of some cold winds in Winter-time when the leaves are\r\noff. Upon these banks they plant not only quick-sets, but even\r\ntimber-trees, which exceedingly thrive, being out of all danger.\r\n\r\n12. The _pyracantha paliurus_, and like preciouser sorts of thorn and\r\nrobust evergreens, adorn’d with caralin-berries, might easily be\r\npropagated by seeds, layers, or cutting, into plenty sufficient to store\r\neven these vulgar uses, were men industrious; and then, how beautiful\r\nand sweet would the environs of our fields be! for there are none of the\r\nspinous shrubs more hardy, none that make a more glorious shew, nor\r\nfitter for our defence, competently arm’d; especially the _rhannus_,\r\nwhich I therefore joyn to the _oxyacantha_, for its terrible and almost\r\nirresistible spines, able almost to pierce a coat of mail; and for this\r\nmade use of by the malicious Jews, to crown the sacred tempels of our\r\nBlessed Saviour, and is yet preferred among the most venerable reliques\r\nin St. Chapel at Paris, as is pretended, by the devotees, &c. and hence\r\nhas the tree (for it sometimes exceeds a shrub) the name of Christ’s\r\nThorn. Thus might berberies now and then be also inserted among our\r\nhedges, which, with the hips, haws, and cornel-berries, do well in light\r\nlands, and would rather be planted to the South, than North or West, as\r\nusually we observe them.\r\n\r\n13. Some (as we noted) mingle their very hedges with oaklings, ash, and\r\nfruit-trees, sown or planted, and ’tis a laudable improvement; though\r\nothers do rather recommend to us sets of all one sort, and will not so\r\nmuch as admit of the black-thorn to be mingled with the white, because\r\nof their unequal progress; and indeed, timber-trees set in the hedge\r\n(though contemporaries with it) do frequently wear it out; and therefore\r\nI should rather encourage such plantations to be at some yards distance,\r\nnear the verges, than perpendicularly in them. Lastly, if in planting\r\nany the most robust forest-trees, (especially oak, elm, chesnut) at\r\ncompetent spaces, and in rows; you open a ring of ground, at about four\r\nfoot distance from the stem, and prick in quick-set plants; you may\r\nafter a while, keep them clipp’d, at what height you please: They will\r\nappear exceedingly beautiful to the eye, prove a good fence, and yield\r\nuseful bush, bavin, and (if you maintain them unshorn) hips and haws in\r\nabundance: This would therefore especially be practis’d, where one would\r\ninvite the birds.\r\n\r\n14. In Cornwal they secure their lands and woods, with high mounds, and\r\non them they plant acorns, whose roots bind in the looser mould, and so\r\nform a coronet of trees. They do likewise (and that with great\r\ncommendation) make hedges of our _genista spinosa_, prickly furzes, of\r\nwhich they have a taller sort, such as the French imploy for the same\r\npurpose in Bretaigne, where they are incomparable husbands.\r\n\r\n15. It is to be sown (which is best) or planted of the roots in a\r\nfurrow: If sown, weeded till it be strong; both tonsile, and to be\r\ndiligently clip’d, which will render it very thick, an excellent and\r\nbeautiful hedge: Otherwise, permitted to grow at large, ’twill yield\r\nvery good faggot: It is likewise admirable covert for wildfowl, and will\r\nbe made to grow even in moist, as well as dry places: The young and\r\ntender tops of furzes, being a little bruis’d and given to a lean sickly\r\nhorse, will strangely recover and plump him. Thus, in some places, they\r\nsow in barren grounds (when they lay them down) the last crop with this\r\nseed, and so let them remain till they break them up again, and during\r\nthat interim, reap considerable advantage: Would you believe (writes a\r\nworthy correspondent of mine) that in Herefordshire (famous for plenty\r\nof wood) their thickets of furzes (_viz._ the vulgar) should yield them\r\nmore profit than a like quantity of the best wheat-land of England? for\r\nsuch is theirs: If this be question’d, the scene is within a mile of\r\nHereford, and proved by anniversary experience, in the lands, as I take\r\nit, of a gentleman who is now one of the burgesses for that city. And in\r\nDevonshire (the seat of the best husbands in the world) they sow on\r\ntheir worst land (well plow’d) the seeds of the rankest furzes, which in\r\nfour or five years becomes a rich wood: No provender (as we say) makes\r\nhorses so hardy as the young tops of these furzes; no other wood so\r\nthick, nor more excellent fuel; and for some purposes also, yielding\r\nthem a kind of timber to their more humble buildings, and a great refuge\r\nfor fowl and other game: I am assur’d, in Bretaigne ’tis sometimes sown\r\nno less than twelve yards thick, for a speedy, profitable, and\r\nimpenetrable mound: If we imitated this husbandry in the dry and hot\r\nbarren places of Surrey, and other parts of this nation, we might\r\nexceedingly spare our woods; and I have bought the best sort of\r\nFrench-seed at the shops in London. It seems that in the more eastern\r\nparts of Germany, and especially in Poland, this vulgar trifle, and even\r\nour common Broom is so rare, that they have desired the seeds of them\r\nout of England, and preserve them with extraordinary care in their best\r\ngardens; this I learn out of our Johnson’s _Herbal_; by which we may\r\nconsider, that what is reputed a curse, and a cumber in some places, is\r\nesteem’d the ornament and blessing of another: But we shall not need go\r\nso far for this, since both beech and birch are almost as great\r\nstrangers in many parts of this nation, particularly Northampton and\r\nOxfordshire. Mr. Cook is much in praise of juniper for hedges,\r\nespecially for the more elegant inclosures, and we daily see how it’s\r\nimproved of late.\r\n\r\n16. This puts me in mind of the _genista scoparia_, broom; another\r\nimprovement for barren grounds, and saver of more substantial fuel: It\r\nmay be sown English, or (what is more sweet and beautiful) the Spanish,\r\nwith equal success. In the western parts of France, and Cornwal, it\r\ngrows with us to an incredible height (however our poet gives it the\r\nepithet of _humilis_) and so it seems they had it of old, as appears by\r\nGratius his _genistæ altinates_, with which (as he affirms) they us’d to\r\nmake staves for their spears, and hunting darts. The seeds of broom,\r\nvomit, and purge, whilst the buds, and flowers being pickled, are very\r\ngrateful.\r\n\r\n17. Lastly, (_sambucus_) a considerable fence maybe made of the elder,\r\nset of reasonable lusty trunchions; much like the willow, and (as I have\r\nseen them maintain’d) laid with great curiosity, and far excelling those\r\nextravagant plantations of them about London, where the lops are\r\npermitted to grow without due and skilful laying. There is a sort of\r\nelder which has hardly any pith; this makes exceeding stout fences, and\r\nthe timber very useful for cogs of mills, butchers skewers, and such\r\ntough employments. Old trees do in time become firm, and close up the\r\nhollowness to an almost invisible pith. But if the medicinal properties\r\nof the leaves, bark, berries, &c. were throughly known, I cannot tell\r\nwhat our countrey-man could ail, for which he might not fetch a remedy\r\nfrom every hedge, either for sickness or wound: The inner bark of elder,\r\napply’d to any burning, takes out the fire immediately; that, or, in\r\nseason, the buds, boil’d in water-grewel for a break-fast, has effected\r\nwonders in a fever; and the decoction is admirable to asswage\r\ninflammations and tetrous humours, and especially the scorbut: But an\r\nextract, or _theriaca_ may be compos’d of the berries, which is not only\r\nefficacious to eradicate this epidemical inconvenience, and greatly to\r\nassist longævity; (so famous is the story of Neander) but is a kind of\r\n_catholicon_ against all infirmities whatever; and of the same berries\r\nis made an incomparable spirit, which drunk by it self, or mingled with\r\nwine, is not only an excellent drink, but admirable in the dropsie: In a\r\nword, the water of the leaves and berries is approved in the dropsie,\r\nevery part of the tree being useful, as may be seen at large in\r\nBlockwitzius’s _anatomy_ thereof. The ointment made with the young buds,\r\nand leaves in May with butter, is most sovereign for aches, shrunk\r\nsinews, hæmorrhoids, &c. and the flowers macerated in vinegar, not only\r\nare of a grateful relish, but good to attenuate and cut raw and gross\r\nhumours. Lastly, the _fungus_ (which we call Jews-ears) decocted in\r\nmilk, or macerated in vinegar, is of known effect in the angina and\r\nsores of the throat. And less than this could I not say (with the leave\r\nof the charitable physician) to gratifie our poor wood-man; and yet when\r\nI have said all this, I do by no means commend the scent of it, which is\r\nvery noxious to the air, and therefore, though I do not undertake that\r\nall things which sweeten the air, are salubrious, nor all ill savours\r\npernicious; yet, as not for its beauty, so neither for its smell, would\r\nI plant elder, near my habitation; since we learn from Biesius,{197:1}\r\nthat a certain house in Spain, seated amongst many elder-trees,\r\ndiseas’d and kill’d almost all the inhabitants, which when at last they\r\nwere grubb’d up, became a very wholsome and healthy place. The elder\r\ndoes likewise produce a certain green fly, almost invisible, which is\r\nexceedingly troublesome, and gathers a fiery redness where it attaques.\r\n\r\n18. There is a shrub called the spindle-tree, (_euonymus_, or _fusanum_)\r\ncommonly growing in our hedges, which bears a very hard wood, of which\r\nthey sometimes made bows for viols, and the inlayer us’d it for its\r\ncolour, and instrument-makers for toothing of organs, and virginal-keys,\r\ntooth-pickers, &c. What we else do with it, I know not, save that\r\n(according with its name, abroad) they make spindles with it. I also\r\nlearn, that three, or four of the berries, purge both by vomit, and\r\nsiege, and the powder made of the berry, being bak’d, kills nits, and\r\ncures scurfy heads. Matthiolus says, the poor people about Trent, press\r\noyl out of the berries, wherewith to feed their lamps: But why they were\r\nwont to scourge parricides with rods made of this shrub, before they put\r\nthem into the sack, see Modestinus l. penult ss. _ad legem Pomp. de\r\nparricid._ cited by Mr. Ray. Here might come in (or be nam’d at least)\r\nwild-cornel, or dog-wood, good to make mill-cogs, pestles, bobins for\r\nbone-lace, spokes for wheels, &c. the best skewers for butchers, because\r\nit does not taint the flesh, and is of so very hard a substance, as to\r\nmake wedges to cleave and rive other wood with, instead of iron. (But of\r\nthis, see chap. II. book II.) And lastly, the _viburnum_, or\r\nway-faring-tree, growing also plentifully in every corner, makes pins\r\nfor the yoaks of oxen; and superstitious people think, that it protects\r\ntheir cattel from being bewitch’d and us’d to plant the shrub about\r\ntheir stalls; ’tis certainly the most plyant and best bands to fagot\r\nwith. The leaves and berries are astringent, and make an excellent\r\ngargle for loose teeth, sore throats, and to stop fluxes: The leaves\r\ndecocted to a lie, not only colour the hairs black, but fasten their\r\nroots; and the bark of the root, macerated under ground, well beaten,\r\nand often boil’d, serves for birdlime.\r\n\r\n19. The American _yucca_ is a hardier plant than we take it to be, for\r\nit will suffer our sharpest Winter, (as I have seen by experience)\r\nwithout that trouble and care of setting it in cases, in our\r\nconservatories for hyemation; such as have beheld it in flower (which is\r\nnot indeed till it be of some age) must needs admire the beauty of it;\r\nand it being easily multiplied, why should it not make one of the best\r\nand most ornamental fences in the world for our gardens, with its\r\nnatural palisadoes, as well as the more tender, and impatient of\r\nmoisture, the aloes, does for their vineyards in Languedoc, &c. but _we_\r\nbelieve nothing improvable, save what our grand-fathers taught us.\r\nFinally, let tryal likewise be made of that thorn, mentioned by Capt.\r\nLiggon in his _History of Barbadoes_; whether it would not be made grow\r\namongst us, and prove as convenient for fences as there; the seeds, or\r\nsets transported to us with due care. And thus, having accomplished what\r\n(by your commands) I had to offer concerning the propagation of the more\r\nsolid, material, and useful trees, as well the dry, as aquatical; and to\r\nthe best of my talent fenc’d our plantation in: I should here conclude,\r\nand set a bound likewise to my discourse, by making an apology for the\r\nmany errors and impertinencies of it, did not the zeal and ambition of\r\nthis illustrious Society to promote and improve all attempts which may\r\nconcern publick utility or ornament, perswade me, that what I am adding\r\nfor the farther encouragement to the planting of some other useful\r\n(though less vulgar) trees, will at least obtain your pardon if it miss\r\nof your approbation.\r\n\r\n20. To discourse in this stile of all such fruit-trees as would prove of\r\ngreatest emolument to the whole nation, were to design a just volume;\r\nand there are directions already so many, and so accurately deliver’d\r\nand publish’d (but which cannot be affirm’d of any of the former classes\r\nof forest-trees, and other remarks, at the least to my poor knowledge\r\nand research) that it would be needless to repeat.\r\n\r\n21. I do only wish (upon the prospect, and meditation of the universal\r\nbenefit) that every person whatsoever, worth ten pounds _per annum_,\r\nwithin Her Majesty’s dominions, were by some indispensible statute,\r\nobliged to plant his hedge-rows with the best and most useful kinds of\r\nthem; especially in such places of the nation, as being the more in-land\r\ncounties, and remote from the seas and navigable rivers, might the\r\nbetter be excus’d from the planting of timber, to the proportion of\r\nthose who are more happily and commodiously situated for the\r\ntransportation of it.\r\n\r\n22. Undoubtedly, if this course were taken effectually, a very\r\nconsiderable part both of the meat and drink which is spent to our\r\nprejudice, might be saved by the countrey-people, even out of the hedges\r\nand mounds, which would afford them not only the pleasure and profit of\r\ntheir delicious fruit, but such abundance of cyder and perry, as should\r\nsuffice them to drink of one of the most wholsome and excellent\r\nbeverages in the world. Old Gerard did long since alledge us an example\r\nworthy to be pursu’d; I have seen (saith he, speaking of apple-trees,\r\nlib. 3. cap. 101.) in the pastures and hedge-rows about the grounds of a\r\nworshipful gentleman dwelling two miles from Hereford, call’d Mr. Roger\r\nBodnome, so many trees of all sorts, that the servants drink for the\r\nmost part no other drink but that which is made of apples: The quantity\r\nis such, that by the report of the gentleman himself, the parson hath\r\nfor tythe many hogs-heads of cyder: The hogs are fed with the fallings\r\nof them, which are so many, that they make choice of those apples they\r\ndo eat, who will not tast of any but of the best. An example doubtless\r\nto be follow’d of gentlemen that have land and living; but Envy saith,\r\nThe poor will break down our hedges, and we shall have the least part of\r\nthe fruit: But forward, in the name of God, graff, set, plant, and\r\nnourish up trees in every corner of your ground; the labour is small,\r\nthe cost is nothing, the commodity is great; your selves shall have\r\nplenty, the poor shall have somewhat in time of want to relieve their\r\nnecessity, and God shall reward your good minds and diligence. Thus far\r\nhonest Gerard. And in truth, with how small a charge and infinite\r\npleasure this were to be effected, every one that is patron of a little\r\nnursery, can easily calculate: But by this expedient many thousands of\r\nacres, sow’d now yearly with barley, might be cultivated for wheat, or\r\nconverted into pasture, to the increase of corn and cattel: Besides, the\r\ntimber which the pear-tree, black-cherry and many thorny plums (which\r\nare best for grain, colour, and gloss) afford, comparable (for divers\r\ncurious uses) with any we have enumerated. The black-cherry-wood grows\r\nsometimes to that bulk, as is fit to make stools with, cabinets, tables,\r\nespecially the redder sort, which will polish well; also pipes, and\r\nmusical instruments, the very bark employ’d for bee-hives: But of this I\r\nam to render a more ample account, in the appendix to this Discourse. I\r\nwould farther recommend the more frequent planting and propagation of\r\nfir, pine-trees, and some other beneficial materials, both for ornament\r\nand profit; especially, since we find by experience, they thrive so\r\nwell, where they are cultivated for curiosity only.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n{176:1}\r\n\r\n    Texendæ sepes etiam, & pecus omne tenendum est:\r\n    Præcipuè, dum frons tenera, imprudensque laborum,\r\n    Cui, super indignas hiemes, solemque potentem,\r\n    Silvestres uri assiduè, capreæque sequaces\r\n    Illudunt: Pascuntur oves, avidæque juvencæ.\r\n    Frigora nec tantum cana concreta pruina,\r\n    Aut gravis incumbens scopulis arentibus æstas,\r\n    Quantum illi nocuere greges, durique venenum\r\n    Dentis, & admorso signata in stirpe cicatrix.\r\n\r\n    _Georg. 2._\r\n\r\n{177:1}\r\n\r\n    Et dubitant homines serere, atque impendere curam?\r\n\r\n    _Georg. 2._\r\n\r\n{177:2}\r\n\r\n    ..........Omne solum natale est, intrat ubique\r\n    Ardelio; illa quidem cultis excluditur agris\r\n    Plerumque, atque hortis; sed circumsepit utrosque\r\n    Atque omnes aditus servat fidissima custos,\r\n    Utilior latrante cane, armatoque Priapo.\r\n    Aspera frigoribus saxisque Helvetia tales\r\n    Educat, & peregre terras emittit in omnes\r\n    Enormes durosque viros, sed fortia bello\r\n    Pectora; non illi cultu, non moribus aulas,\r\n    Atque urbes decorare valent, sed utrasque fideli\r\n    Defendunt opera; nec iis, gens cauta, tyranni,\r\n    Præponunt speciosa magis, multúmque sonora\r\n    Præsidia; his certi vitam tutantur opesque, &c.\r\n\r\n    _Couleii_, pl. l. 6.\r\n\r\n{192:1} See Varro in _Atis._ Ovid, Fast. 6\r\n\r\n    ........... de spina sumitur alba.\r\n\r\n{197:1} Bies. _de Aeris potestate_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDENDROLOGIA\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND BOOK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n_Of the Mulberry._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Morus_, the mulberry: It may possibly be wonder’d by some why we\r\nshould insert this tree amongst our forest inhabitants; but we shall\r\nsoon reconcile our industrious planter, when he comes to understand the\r\nincomparable benefit of it, and that for its timber, durableness, and\r\nuse for the joyner and carpenter, and to make hoops, bows, wheels, and\r\neven ribs for small vessels, instead of oak, &c. though the fruit and\r\nthe leaves had not the due value with us, which they deservedly enjoy in\r\nother places of the world.\r\n\r\n2. But it is not here I would recommend our ordinary black fruit\r\nbearers, though that be likewise worth the propagation; but that kind\r\nwhich is call’d the white mulberry (which I have had sent me out of\r\nLanguedoc) one of them of a broad leaf, found there and in Provence,\r\nwhose seeds being procured from Paris, where they have it from Avignon,\r\nshould be thus treated in the seminary.\r\n\r\n3. In countries where they cultivate them for the silk-worm, and other\r\nuses, they sow the perfectly mature berries of a tree whose leaves have\r\nnot been gather’d; these they shake down upon an old sheet spread under\r\nthe tree, to protect them from gravel and ordure, which will hinder you\r\nfrom discerning the seed: If they be not ripe, lay them to mature upon\r\nshelves, but by no means till they corrupt; to prevent which, turn them\r\ndaily; then put them in a fine sieve; and plunging it in water, bruise\r\nthem with your hand; do this in several waters, then change them in\r\nother clear water, and the seed will sink to the bottom, whilst the pulp\r\nswims, and must be taken off carefully: This done, lay them to dry in\r\nthe sun upon a linnen cloth, for which one hour is sufficient, then van\r\nand sift it from the husks, and reserve it till the season. This is the\r\nprocess of curious persons, but the sowing of ripe mulberries themselves\r\nis altogether as good, and from the excrement of hogs, and even dogs\r\n(that will frequently eat them) they will rise abundantly. Note, that in\r\nsowing of the berry, ’tis good to squash and bruise them with fine\r\nsifted mould, and if it be rich, and of the old bed, so much the better:\r\nThey would be interr’d, well moistned and cover’d with straw, and then\r\nrarely water’d till they peep; or you may squeze the ripe berries in\r\nropes of hair or bast, and bury them, as is prescrib’d for hipps and\r\nhaws; the earth in which you sow them, should be fine mould, and as rich\r\nas for melons, rais’d a little higher than the area, as they make the\r\nbeds for ordinary pot-herbs, to keep them loose and warm, and in such\r\nbeds you may sow seeds as you do purslane, mingled with some fine earth,\r\nand thinly cover’d, and then for a fortnight, strew’d over with straw,\r\nto protect them both from sudden heat and from birds: The season is\r\nApril or May, though some forbear even till July and August, and in the\r\nsecond quarter of the moon, the weather calm and serene. At the\r\nbeginning, keep them moderately fresh (not over wet) and clean weeded,\r\nsecured from the rigor of frosts; the second year of their growth, about\r\nthe beginning of October, or early Spring, draw them gently out, prune\r\nthe roots, and dipping them a little in pond-water, transplant them in a\r\nwarm place or nursery; ’tis best ranging them in drills, two foot large,\r\nand one in depth, each drill three foot distance, and each plant two.\r\nAnd if thus the new earth be somewhat lower than the surface of the\r\nrest, ’twill the better receive the rain: Being planted, cut them all\r\nwithin three inches of the ground. Water them not in Winter, but in\r\nextream necessity, and when the weather is warm, and then do it in the\r\nmorning. In this cold season you shall do well to cover the ground with\r\nthe leaves of trees, straw, or short litter, to keep them warm; and\r\nevery year you shall give them three dressings or half diggings; _viz._\r\nin April, June, and August; this, for the first year, still after rain:\r\nThe second Spring after transplanting, purge them of all superfluous\r\nshoots and scions, reserving only the most towardly for the future stem;\r\nthis to be done yearly, as long as they continue in the nursery; and if\r\nof the principal stem so left, the frost mortifie any part, cut it off,\r\nand continue this government till they are near six foot high, after\r\nwhich suffer them to spread into heads by discreetly pruning and\r\nfashioning them: But if you plant where cattle may endanger them, the\r\nstem had need be taller, for they are extreamly liquorish of the leaves.\r\n\r\n4. When now they are about five years growth, you may transplant them\r\nwithout cutting the root (provided you erradicate them with care) only\r\ntrimming the head a little; the season is from September to November in\r\nthe new-moon, and if the holes or pits you set them in were dug and\r\nprepar’d some months before, it would much secure their taking; some\r\ncast horns, bones, shells, &c. into them, the better to loosen the earth\r\nabout them, which should be rich, and well refresh’d all Summer. A\r\nlight, and dry mould is best, well expos’d to the sun and air, which\r\nabove all things this tree affects, and hates watery low grounds: In\r\nsum, being a very lasting tree, they thrive best where vines prosper\r\nmost, whose society they exceedingly cherish; nor do they less delight\r\nto be amongst corn, no way prejudicing it with its shade. The distance\r\nof these standards would be twenty, or twenty four foot every way, if\r\nyou would design walks or groves of them; if the environs of fields,\r\nbanks of rivers, high-ways, &c. twelve or fourteen foot may suffice, but\r\nthe farther distant, the better; for the white spreads its root much\r\nfarther than the black, and likes the valley more than the higher\r\nground.\r\n\r\n5. Another expedient to increase mulberries, is, by layers from the\r\nsuckers at the foot, this done in Spring, leaving not above two buds out\r\nof the earth, which you must diligently water, and the second year they\r\nwill be rooted: They will also take by passing any branch or arm slit,\r\nand kept a little open with a wedge, or stone, through a basket of\r\nearth, which is a very sure way: Nay, the very cuttings will strike in\r\nSpring, but let them be from shoots of two years growth, with some of\r\nthe old wood, though of seven or eight years; these set in rills, like\r\nvines, having two or three buds at the top, will root infallibly,\r\nespecially if you twist the old wood a little, or at least hack it,\r\nthough some slit the foot, inserting a stone, or grain of an oat, to\r\nsuckle and entertain the plant with moisture.\r\n\r\n6. They may also be propagated by graffing them on the black mulberry in\r\nSpring, or inoculated in July, taking the cyons from some old tree, that\r\nhas broad, even, and round leaves, which causes it to produce very ample\r\nand tender leaves, of great emolument to the silk-master.\r\n\r\n7. Some experienc’d husbandmen advise to poll our mulberries every three\r\nor four years, as we do our willows; others not till 8 years; both\r\nerroneously. The best way is yearly to prune them of their dry and\r\nsuperfluous branches, and to form their heads round and natural. The\r\nfirst year of removal where they are to abide, cut off all the shoots,\r\nto five or six of the most promising; the next year leave not above\r\nthree of these, which dispose in triangle as near as may be, and then\r\ndisturb them no more, unless it be to purge them (as we taught) of dead\r\nseare-wood, and extravagant parts, which may impeach the rest; and if\r\nafterward any prun’d branch shoot above three or four cyons, reduce them\r\nto that number. One of the best ways of pruning is, what they practise\r\nin Sicily and Provence, to make the head hollow, and like a bell, by\r\ncleansing them of their inmost branches; and this may be done, either\r\nbefore they bud, _viz._ in the new-moon of March, or when they are full\r\nof leaves in June or July, if the season prove any thing fresh. Here I\r\nmust not omit what I read of the Chinese culture, and which they now\r\nalso imitate in Virginia, where they have found a way to raise these\r\nplants of the seeds, which they mow and cut like a crop of grass, which\r\nsprout, and bear leaves again in a few months: They likewise (in\r\nVirginia) have planted them in hedges, as near together as we do\r\ngooseberries and currans, for their more convenient clipping, which they\r\npretend to do with scissers.\r\n\r\n8. The mulberry is much improv’d by stirring the mould at root, and\r\nletation.\r\n\r\n9. We have already mentioned some of the uses of this excellent tree,\r\nespecially of the white, so called because the fruit is of a paler\r\ncolour, which is also of a more luscious taste, and lesser than the\r\nblack; the rind likewise is whiter, and the leaves of a mealy clear\r\ngreen colour, and far tenderer, and sooner produc’d by at least a\r\nfortnight, which is a marvelous advantage to the newly disclos’d\r\nsilk-worm: Also they arrive sooner to their maturity, and the food\r\nproduces a finer web. Nor is this tree less beautiful to the eye than\r\nthe fairest elm, very proper for walks and avenues: The timber (amongst\r\nother properties) will last in the water as well as the most solid oak,\r\nand the bark makes good and tough bast-ropes. It suffers no kind of\r\nvermin to breed on it, whether standing or fell’d, nor dares any\r\ncaterpillar attack it, save the silk-worm only. The loppings are\r\nexcellent fuel: But that for which this tree is in greatest and most\r\nworthy esteem, is for the leaves, which (besides the silk-worm)\r\nnourishes cows, sheep, and other cattle; especially young porkers, being\r\nboil’d with a little bran; and the fruit excellent to feed poultrey. In\r\nsum, whatever eats of them, will with difficulty be reduc’d to endure\r\nany thing else, as long as they can come by them: To say nothing of\r\ntheir other soveraign qualities, as relaxing of the belly, being eaten\r\nin the morning, and curing inflamations and ulcers of the mouth and\r\nthroat, mix’d with _Mel rosarum_, in which receipt they do best, being\r\ntaken before they are over-ripe. I have{209:1} read, that in Syria they\r\nmake bread of them; but that the eating of it makes men bald: As for\r\ndrink, the juice of the berry mixed with cider-apples, makes an\r\nexcellent liquor, both for colour and taste.\r\n\r\n10. To proceed with the leaf (for which they are chiefly cherish’d) the\r\nbenefit of it is so great, that they are frequently let to farm for vast\r\nsums; so as some one sole tree has yielded the proprietor a rent of\r\ntwenty shillings _per annum_, for the leaves only; and six or seven\r\npounds of silk, worth as many pounds sterling, in five or six weeks, to\r\nthose who keep the worms. We know that till after Italy had made silk\r\nabove a thousand years, (and where the tree it self was not a stranger,\r\nnone of the ancients writing any thing concerning it) they receiv’d it\r\nnot in France; it being hardly yet an hundred, since they betook\r\nthemselves to this manufacture in Provence, Languedoc, Dauphine,\r\nLionnois, &c. and not in Tourain and Orleans, till Hen. the Fourth’s\r\ntime; but it is incredible what a revenue it now amounts to in that\r\nkingdom. About the same time, or a little after, it was that King James\r\ndid with extraordinary care recommend it to this nation, by a book of\r\ndirections, acts of council, and all other princely assistance. But this\r\ndid not take, no more than that of Hen. the Fourth’s proposal about the\r\nenvirons of Paris, who filled the high-ways, parks, and gardens of\r\nFrance with the trees, beginning in his own gardens for encouragement:\r\nYet, I say, this would not be brought into example, till this present\r\ngreat monarch, by the indefatigable diligence of _Monsieur_ Colbert\r\n(Superintendent of His Majesty’s Manufactures) who has so successfully\r\nreviv’d it, that ’tis prodigious to consider what an happy progress they\r\nhave made in it; to our shame be it spoken, who have no other\r\ndiscouragements from any insuperable difficulty whatever, but our sloth,\r\nand want of industry; since wherever these trees will grow and prosper,\r\nthe silk-worms will do so also; and they were alike averse, and from the\r\nvery same suggestions, where now that manufacture flourishes in our\r\nneighbour countries. It is demonstrable, that mulberries in four or five\r\nyears may be made to spread all over this land; and when the indigent,\r\nand young daughters in proud families are as willing to gain three or\r\nfour shillings a day for gathering silk, and busying themselves in this\r\nsweet and easie employment, as some do to get four pence a day for hard\r\nwork at hemp, flax, and wooll; the reputation of mulberries will spread\r\nin England and other plantations. I might say something like this of\r\nsaffron, which we yet too much neglect the culture of; but, which for\r\nall this I do not despair of seeing reassum’d, when that good genius\r\nreturns. In order to this hopeful prognostick, we will add a few\r\ndirections about gathering of their leaves, to render this chapter one\r\nof the most accomplish’d, for certainly one of the most accomplish’d and\r\nagreeable works in the world.\r\n\r\n11. The leaves of the mulberry should be collected from trees of seven\r\nor eight years old; if of such as are very young, it impairs their\r\ngrowth, neither are they so healthful for the worms, making them\r\nhydropical, and apt to burst: As do also the leaves of such trees as be\r\nplanted in a too waterish, or over-rich soil, or where no sun comes, and\r\nall sick, and yellow leaves are hurtful. It is better to clip, and let\r\nthe leaves fall upon a subtended sheet or blanket, than to gather them\r\nby hand: and to gather them, than to strip them, which marrs and gauls\r\nthe branches, and bruises the leaves that should hardly be touched. Some\r\nthere are who lop off the boughs, and make it their pruning, and it is a\r\ntolerable way, so it be discreetly done in the over-thick parts of the\r\ntree; but these leaves gather’d from a separated branch, will die, and\r\nwither much sooner than those which are taken from the tree immediately,\r\nunless you set the stem in water. Leaves gathered from boughs cut off,\r\nwill shrink in three hours; whereas those you take from the living tree,\r\nwill last as many days; and being thus a while kept, are better than\r\nover-fresh ones. It is a rule, never to gather in a rainy season, nor\r\ncut any branch whilst the wet is upon it; and therefore against such\r\nsuspected times, you are to provide before-hand, and to reserve them in\r\nsome fresh, but dry place: The same caution you must observe for the\r\ndew, tho’ it do not rain, for wet food kills the worms. But if this\r\ncannot be altogether prevented, put the leaves between a pair of sheets\r\nwell dried by the fire, and shake them up and down ’till the moisture be\r\ndrunk up in the linnen, and then spreading them to the air a little, on\r\nanother dry cloth, you may feed with them boldly. The top-leaves and\r\noldest, would be gathered last of all, as being most proper to repast\r\nthe worms with, towards their last change. The gatherer must be neat,\r\nand have his hands clean, and his breath sweet, and not poison’d with\r\nonions, or tabacco, and be careful not to press the leaves, by crouding\r\nthem into the bags or baskets. Lastly, that they gather only (unless in\r\ncase of necessity) leaves from the present, not from the former years\r\nsprigs, or old wood, which are not only rude and harsh, but are annex’d\r\nto stubb’d stalks, which injure the worms, and spoil the denudated\r\nbranches. One note more let me add, that in first hatching the eggs\r\ndisclosing (as sometimes) earlier than there is provision for them on\r\nthe tree, the tender leaves of lettuce, dandelion or endive may supply,\r\nso they feed not on them too long, or overmuch, which gives them the\r\nlask.\r\n\r\n12. This is what I thought fit to premonish concerning the gathering of\r\nthe leaves of this tree for silk-worms, as I find it in _Monsieur_\r\nIsnard’s _Instructions_, and that exact discourse of his, published some\r\nyears since, and dedicated to _Monsieur_ Colbert, (who has, it seems,\r\nconstituted this industrious and experienc’d person, surveyor of this\r\nprincely manufacture about Paris) and because the book it self is rare,\r\nand known by very few. I have no more to add, but this for our\r\nencouragement, and to encounter the objections which may be suggested\r\nabout the coldness and moisture of our country; that the Spring is in\r\nProvence no less inconstant than is ours in England; that the colds at\r\nParis are altogether as sharp; and that when in May it has continued\r\nraining for nine and twenty days successively, _Monsieur_ Isnard assures\r\nus, he proceeded in his work without the least disaster; and in the year\r\n1664, he presented the French King his Master, with a considerable\r\nquantity of better silks, than any Messina or Bononia could produce,\r\nwhich he sold raw at Lions, for a pistol the pound; when that of\r\nAvignon, Provence, and Dauphine produc’d little above half that price.\r\nBut you are to receive the compleat history of the silk-worm, from that\r\nincomparable treatise, which the learned Malpighius has lately sent out\r\nof Italy, and dedicated to the Royal Society, as a specimen and noble\r\neffect of its universal correspondence, and concernments for the\r\nimprovement of useful knowledge. To this I add that beneficial passage\r\nof the learned Dr. Beale, communicated in the 12th. vol. _Philos.\r\nTransactions_, n. 133. p. 816, where we find recommended the promotion\r\nof this tree in England, from its success in several Northern Counties,\r\nand even in the moist places of Ireland: He shews how it may be improv’d\r\nby graffing on the fig; or the larger black mulberry, on that of the\r\nsmallest kind: Also of what request the _Diamoron_, or _Guidenie_ made\r\nof the juice of this fruit, was with the Ancients, with other excellent\r\nobservations: What other incomparable remedies the fruit of this tree\r\naffords, see Plin. _Nat. Hist._ lib. 23. cap. 7. There is a\r\nmulberry-tree brought from Virginia not to be contemn’d; upon which they\r\nfind silk-worms, which would exceed the silk of Persia it self, if the\r\nplanters of nauseous tabacco did not hinder the culture. Sir Jo. Berkley\r\n(who was many years Governor of that ample Colony) told me, he presented\r\nthe King (Char. II.) with as much of silk made there, as made his\r\nMajesty a compleat suit of apparel. Lastly, let it not seem altogether\r\nimpertinent, if I add one premonition to those less experienc’d\r\ngardners, who frequently expose their orange, and like tender-furniture\r\ntrees of the green-house too early: That the first leaves putting forth\r\nof this wise tree, (_sapientissima_, as{213:1} Pliny calls it) is a more\r\ninfallible note when those delicate plants may be safely brought out to\r\nthe air, than by any other prognostick or indication.

Where-ever they\r\nbuilt their sumptuous and magnificent colleges for the exercise of youth\r\nin gymnastics, as riding, shooting, wrestling, running, &c. (like to our\r\nFrench Academies) and where the graver philosophers also met to converse\r\ntogether, and improve their studies, betwixt the Xista, and _subdiales\r\nambulationes_ (which were portico’s open to the air) they planted\r\ngroves and walks of platans, to refresh and shade the _Palæstritæ_; as\r\nyou have them describ’d by Vitruvius, lib. 5. cap. 11. and as Claudius\r\nPerrault has assisted the text, with a figure, or ichnographical plot.\r\nThese trees{215:1} the Romans first brought out of the Levant, and\r\ncultivated with so much industry and cost, for their stately and proud\r\nheads only, that great orators and states-men, Cicero and Hortensius,\r\nwould exchange now and then a turn at the bar, that they might have the\r\npleasure to step to their villas, and refresh their platans, which they\r\nwould often irrigate with wine instead of water; _crevit & affuso\r\nlaetior umbra mero_: when Hortensius taught trees to tipple wine; and so\r\npriz’d the very shadow of it, that when afterwards they transplanted\r\nthem into France, they exacted a{215:2} _solarium_ and tribute of any of\r\nthe natives, who should presume but to put his head under it. But\r\nwhether for any virtue extraordinary in the shade, or other propitious\r\ninfluence issuing from them, a worthy Knight, who stay’d at Ispahan in\r\nPersia, when that famous city was infected with a raging pestilence,\r\ntold me, that since they have planted a greater number of these noble\r\ntrees about it, the plague has not come nigh their dwellings. Pliny\r\naffirms, there is no tree whatsoever which so well defends us from the\r\nheat of the sun in Summer, nor that admits it more kindly in Winter. And\r\nfor our encouragement, I do upon experience assure you, that they will\r\nflourish and abide with us, without any more trouble than frequent and\r\nplentiful watering, which from their youth they excessively delight in,\r\nand gratefully acknowledge by their growth accordingly; so as I am\r\nperswaded, that with very ordinary industry, they might be propagated to\r\nthe incredible ornament of the walks and avenues to great-mens houses.\r\nThe introduction of this true plane among us, is, perhaps due to the\r\ngreat Lord Chancellor Bacon, who planted those (still flourishing ones)\r\nat Verulam; as to mine, to that honourable gentleman, the late Sir\r\nGeorge Crook of Oxfordshire, from whose bounty I received an hopeful\r\nplant now growing in my villa: Nor methinks should it be so great a\r\nrarity, (if it be true) that being brought from Sicily, it was planted\r\nas near us as the Morini.\r\n\r\n3. There was lately at Basil in Switzerland, an ancient goodly\r\n_Platanetum_, and now in France they are come again in vogue: I know it\r\nwas anciently accounted ἄκαρπος; but they may with us be rais’d of\r\ntheir seeds with care, in a moist soil, as here I have known them. But\r\nthe reason of our little success, is, that we very rarely have them sent\r\nus ripe; which should be gather’d late in Autumn, and brought us from\r\nsome more Levantine parts than Italy. They come also of layers\r\nabundantly, affecting a fresh and feeding ground; for so they plant them\r\nabout their rivulets and fountains. The West-Indian plane is not\r\naltogether so rare, but it rises to a goodly tree, and bears a very\r\nample and less jagged leaf: That the Turks use their _platanus_ for the\r\nbuilding of ships, I learn out of Ricciolus _Hydrog._ l. 10. c. 37. and\r\nout of Pliny, canoos and vessels for the sea have been excavated out of\r\ntheir prodigious trunks.\r\n\r\n4. The same opinion have I of the noble _lotus arbor_ (another lover of\r\nthe water) which in Italy yields both an admirable shade, and timber\r\nimmortal, growing to a vast tree, where they come spontaneously; but\r\nits fruit seems not so tempting as it is storied it was to the\r\ncompanions of Ulysses: The first who brought the lotus out of Virginia,\r\nwas the late industrious Tradescant. Of this wood are made pipes, and\r\nwind-instruments, and of its root, hafts for knives and other tools, &c.\r\nThe offer of Crassus to Domitius for half a dozen of these trees,\r\ngrowing about an house of his in Rome, testifies in what esteem they\r\nwere had for their incomparable beauty and use.\r\n\r\nThe cornell tree, though not mention’d by Pliny for its timber, is\r\nexceedingly commended for its durableness, and use in wheelwork, pinns\r\nand wedges, in which it lasts like the hardest iron; and it will grow\r\nwith us to good bulk and stature; and the preserv’d and pickl’d berries,\r\n(or cherries rather) are most refreshing, an excellent condiment, and do\r\nalso well in tarts. But that is very old, which Mathiolus affirms upon\r\nhis own experience, that one who has been bitten of a mad-dog, if in a\r\nyear after he handle the wood of this tree till it grow warm, relapses\r\nagain into his former distemper.\r\n\r\nThe same reported of the _cornus femina_, or wild cornel; which is like\r\nthe former for compactedness, and made use of for cart-timber, and other\r\nrustick instruments; besides, for the best of butchers skewers,\r\ntooth-pickers, and in some countries abroad they decoct the berries,\r\nwhich press’d, yield an oyl for the lamp.\r\n\r\nLastly, the acacia, and that of Virginian, deserves a place among our\r\navenue trees, (could they be made to grow upright) adorning our walks\r\nwith their exotic leaf, and sweet flowers; very hardy against the\r\npinching Winter, but not so proof against its blustring winds; though it\r\nbe arm’d with thorns: nor do the roots take such hold of the ground,\r\ninsinuating, and running more like liquorish, and apt to emaciate the\r\nsoil; I will not therefore commend it for gardens, unless for the\r\nvariety; of which there are several, some without thorns: They love to\r\nbe planted in moist ground.\r\n\r\nOne thing more there is, which (for the use and benefit which these and\r\nthe like exotics afford us) I would take hold of, as upon all occasions\r\nI do in this work: Namely, to encourage all imaginary industry of such\r\nas travel foreign countries, and especially gentlemen who have concerns\r\nin our American plantations, to promote the culture of such plants and\r\ntrees (especially timber) as may yet add to those we find already\r\nagreeable to our climat in England. What we have said of the mulberry,\r\nand the vast emolument rais’d by the very leaves, as well as wood of\r\nthat only tree (beside those we now have mention’d, strangers till of\r\nlate, and believ’d incicurable here,) were sufficient to excite and stir\r\nup our utmost industry. History tells us, the noble and fruitful\r\ncountrey of France, was heretofore thought so steril and barren, that\r\nnothing almost prospering in it, the inhabitants were quite deserting\r\nit, and with their wives and children going to seek some other more\r\npropitious abodes; till some of them hapning to come into Italy, and\r\ntasting the juice of the delicious grape, the rest of their countreymen\r\ntook arms, and invaded the territories where those vines grew; which\r\nthey transplanted into _Gallia_, and have so infinitely improv’d since,\r\nthat France alone yields more of that generous liquor, than not only\r\nItaly and Greece, but all Europe and Asia beside: Who almost would\r\nbelieve that the austere Rhenish, abounding on the fertile banks of the\r\nRhine should produce so soft and charming a liquor, as does the same\r\nvine, planted among the rocks and pumices of the so remote and\r\nmountainous Canaries?\r\n\r\nThis for the encouragement and honour of those who improve their\r\ncountries with things of use and general benefit: Now in the mean time,\r\nhow have I beheld a florist, or meaner gardener transported at the\r\ncasual discovery of a new little spot, double leaf, streak or dash\r\nextraordinary in a tulip, anemony, carnation, auricula, or amaranth!\r\ncherishing and calling it by their own names, raising the price of a\r\nsingle bulb, to an enormous sum; till a law in Holland was made to check\r\nthat tulipa-mania: The florist in the mean time priding himself as if he\r\nhad found the elixir, or perform’d some notable atchievement, and\r\ndiscover’d a new countrey.\r\n\r\nThis for the defects, (for such those variegations produc’d by practice,\r\nor mixture, mangonisms and starving the root, are by chance met with now\r\nand then) of a fading flower: How much more honour then were due in\r\njustice to those persons, who bring in things of much real benefit to\r\ntheir countrey? especially trees for fruit and timber; the oak alone\r\n(besides the shelter it afforded to our late Sovereign Charles the II^d)\r\nhaving so often sav’d and protected the whole nation from invasion, and\r\nbrought it in so much wealth from foreign countries. I have been told,\r\nthere was an intention to have instituted an Order of the Royal-Oak; and\r\ntruly I should think it to become a green-ribbon (next to that of St.\r\nGeorge) superior to any of the romantick badges, to which abroad is paid\r\nsuch veneration, deservedly to be worn by such as have signaliz’d\r\nthemselves by their conduct and courage; for the defence and\r\npreservation of their countrey. Bespeaking my reader’s pardon for this\r\ndigression, we proceed in the next to other useful exoticks.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n{214:1} Euripides _epithai_.\r\n\r\n{215:1} Macrob. _saturnal._ 3. c. 11.\r\n\r\n{215:2} Solarium quod pro folo pendetur, as the pandects name the tax\r\npaid for the shades that bear no fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n_Of the Fir, Pine, Pinaster, Pitch-tree, Larsh, and Subterranean trees._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Abies_, _picea_, _pinus_, _pinaster_, larsh, &c. are all of them\r\neasily rais’d of the kernels and nuts, which may be gotten out of their\r\npolysperm and turbinate cones, clogs, and squams, by exposing them to\r\nthe sun, or a little before the fire, or in warm-water, till they begin\r\nto gape, and are ready to deliver themselves of their numerous burthens.\r\n\r\n2. There are of the fir two principal species; the _picea_, or male,\r\nwhich is the bigger tree; very beautiful and aspiring, and of an harder\r\nwood, and hirsute leaf: And the silver-fir, or female. I begin with the\r\nfirst: The boughs whereof are flexible and bending; the cones dependent,\r\nlong and smooth, growing from the top of the branch; and where gaping,\r\nyet retain the seeds in their receptacles, when fresh gather’d, giving a\r\ngrateful fragrancy of the rosin: The fruit is ripe in September. But\r\nafter all, for a perfecter account of the true and genuine fir-tree,\r\n(waving the distinction of _sapinum_, from _sapinus_, _literâ sed unâ_\r\ndiffering, as of another kind) is a noble upright tree from the ground,\r\nsmooth and even, to the eruption of the branches; as is that they call\r\nthe _sapinum_, and thence tapering to the summit of the _fusterna_: The\r\narms and branches (with yew-like leaves) grow from the stem opposite to\r\none another, _seriatim_ to the top, (as do all cone-bearers) discovering\r\ntheir age; which in time, with their weight, bend them from their\r\nnatural tendency, which is upright, especially toward the top of aged\r\ntrees, where the leaf is flattish, and not so regular: The cone great\r\nand hard, pyramidal and full of winged-seeds.\r\n\r\nThe silver-fir, of a whitish colour, like rosemary under the leaf, is\r\ndistinguished from the rest, by the pectinal shape of it: The cones not\r\nso large as the _picea_, grow also upright, and this they call the\r\nfemale: For I find botanists not unanimously agreed about the sexes of\r\ntrees. The layers, and even cuttings of this tree, take root, and\r\nimprove to trees, tho’ more naturally by its winged-seeds: But the\r\nmasculine _picea_ will endure no amputation; nor is comparable to the\r\nsilver-fir for beauty, and so fit to adorn walks and avenues; tho’ the\r\nother also be a very stately plant; yet with this infirmity, that tho’\r\nit remain always green, it sheds the old leaves more visibly, and not\r\nseldom breaks down its ponderous branches: Besides, the timber is\r\nnothing so white; tho’ yet even that colour be not always the best\r\ncharacter: That which comes from Bergin, Swinsound, Mott, Longland,\r\nDranton, &c. (which experienc’d work-men call the dram) being long,\r\nstrait and clear, and of a yellow more cedry colour, is esteemed much\r\nbefore the white for flooring and wainscot, for masts, &c. those of\r\nPrussia, which we call spruce, and Norway (especially from Gottenberg)\r\nand about Riga, are the best; unless we had more commerce of them from\r\nour Plantations in New England, which are preferable to any of them;\r\nthere lying rotting at present at Pascataway, a mast of such prodigious\r\ndimensions, as no body will adventure to ship, and bring away. All these\r\nbear their seeds in conick figures, and squamons, after an admirable\r\nmanner and closeness, to protect their winged-seeds.\r\n\r\nThe hemlock-tree (as they call it in New-England) is a kind of spruce:\r\nIn the Scottish Highlands are trees of wonderful altitude (though not\r\naltogether so tall, thick, and fine as the former) which grow upon\r\nplaces so unaccessible, and far from the sea, that (as one says) they\r\nseem to be planted by God on purpose for nurseries of seed, and monitors\r\nto our industry, reserved with other blessings, to be discover’d in our\r\ndays amongst the new-invented improvements of husbandry, not known to\r\nour southern people of this nation, &c. Did we consider the pains they\r\ntake to bring them out of the Alps, we should less stick at the\r\ndifficulty of transporting them from the utmost parts of Scotland. To\r\nthe former sorts we may add the Esterund firs, Tonsberry,\r\nFrederick-stad, Hellerone, Holmstrand, Landifer, Stavenger, Lawrwat, &c.\r\nThere is likewise a kind of fir, call’d in Dutch the green-boome, much\r\nus’d in building of ships, though not for men of war, because of its\r\nlightness, and that it is not so strong as oak; but yet proper enough\r\nfor vessels of great burden, and which stand much out of the water: This\r\nsort comes into Holland from Norway, and other Eastland countries; It is\r\nsomewhat heavier yet than fir, and stronger, nor do either of them bend\r\nsufficiently: As to the seeds, they may be sown in beds or cases at any\r\ntime, during March; and when they peep, carefully defended with furzes,\r\nor the like fence, from the rapacious birds, which are very apt to pull\r\nthem up, by taking hold of that little infecund part of the seed, which\r\nthey commonly bear upon their tops: The beds wherein you sow them had\r\nneed be shelter’d from the southern aspects, with some skreen of reed,\r\nor thick hedge: Sow them in shallow rills, not above half-inch-deep, and\r\ncover them with fine light mould: Being risen a finger in height,\r\nestablish their weak stalks, by sifting some more earth about them;\r\nespecially the pines, which being more top-heavy, are more apt to swag.\r\nWhen they are of two or three years growth, you may transplant them\r\nwhere you please; and when they have gotten good root, they will make\r\nprodigious shoots, but not for the three or four first years\r\ncomparatively. They will grow both in moist and barren gravel, and poor\r\nground, so it be not over-sandy and light, and want a loamy ligature;\r\nbut before sowing (I mean here for large designs) turn it up a foot\r\ndeep, sowing, or setting your seeds an hand distance, and riddle earth\r\nupon them: In five or six weeks they will peep. When you transplant,\r\nwater them well before, and cut the clod out about the root, as you do\r\nmelons out of the hot-bed, which knead close to them like an egg: Thus\r\nthey may be sent safely many miles, but the top must neither be bruised,\r\nnor much less cut, which would dwarf it for ever: One kind also will\r\ntake of slips or layers, interr’d about the latter end of August, and\r\nkept moist.\r\n\r\n3. The best time to transplant, were in the beginning of April; they\r\nwould thrive mainly in a stiff, hungry clay, or rather loam; but by no\r\nmeans in over-light, or rich soil: Fill the holes therefore with such\r\nbarren earth, if your ground be improper of it self; and if the clay be\r\ntoo stiff, and untractable, with a little sand, removing with as much\r\nearth about the roots as is possible, though the fir will better endure\r\na naked transplantation, than the pine: If you be necessitated to plant\r\ntowards the latter end of Summer, lay a pretty deal of horse-litter upon\r\nthe surface of the ground, to keep off the heat, and in Winter the cold;\r\nbut let no dung touch either stem or root: You may likewise sow in such\r\nearth about February, they will make a shoot the very first year of an\r\ninch; next an handful, the third year three foot, and thence forward,\r\nabove a yard annually. A Northern gentleman (who has oblig’d me with\r\nthis process upon his great experience) assures me, that fir, and this\r\n_feralis arbor_, (as Virgil calls the pine) are abundantly planted in\r\nNorthumberland, which are in few years grown to the magnitude of\r\nship-masts; and from all has been said, deduces these encouragements. 1.\r\nThe facility of their propagation. 2. The nature of their growth, which\r\nis to affect places where nothing else will thrive. 3. Their uniformity\r\nand beauty. 4. Their perpetual verdure. 5. Their sweetness. 6. Their\r\nfruitfulness; affording seed, gum, fuel, and timber of all other woods\r\nthe most useful, and easy to work, &c. All which highly recommend it as\r\nan excellent improvement of husbandry, fit to be enjoyn’d by some solemn\r\nedict, to the inhabitants of this our island, that we may have masts,\r\nand those other materials of our own growth: In planting the silver\r\n_abies_, set not the roots too deep, it affects the surface more than\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\n4. The pine (of which are reckon’d no less than ten several sorts,\r\npreferring the domestic, or sative for the fuller growth) is likewise of\r\nboth sexes, whereof the male growing lower, with a rounder shape, hath\r\nits wood more knotty and rude than the female; it’s lank, longer, narrow\r\nand pointed; bears a black, thick, large cone, including the kernel\r\nwithin an hard shell, cover’d under a thick scale: The nuts of this tree\r\n(not much inferior to the almond) are used among other ingredients, in\r\nbeatilla-pies, at the best tables. They would be gather’d in June,\r\nbefore they gape; yet having hung two years (for there will be always\r\nsome ripe, and some green on the same tree) preserve them in their nuts,\r\nin sand, as you treat acorns, &c. ’till the season invite, and then set\r\nor sow them in ground which is cultivated like the fir, in most\r\nrespects; only, you may bury the nuts a little deeper. By a friend of\r\nmine, they were rolled in a fine compost made of sheeps-dung, and\r\nscatter’d in February, and this way never fail’d fir and pine; they came\r\nto be above inch-high by May; and a Spanish author tells us, that to\r\nmacerate them five days in a child’s urine, and three days in water, is\r\nof wonderful effect: This were an expeditious process for great\r\nplantations; unless you would rather set the pine as they do pease, but\r\nat wider distances, that when there is occasion of removal, they might\r\nbe taken up with the earth and all, I say, taken up, and not remov’d by\r\nevulsion; because they are (of all other trees) the most obnoxious to\r\nmiscarry without this caution; and therefore it were much better (where\r\nthe nuts might be commodiously set, and defended) never to remove them\r\nat all, it gives this tree so considerable a check. The safest course of\r\nall, were to set the nuts in an earthen-pot, and in frosty weather,\r\nshewing it a little to the fire, the intire clod will come out with\r\nthem, which are to be reserved, and set in the naked earth, in\r\nconvenient and fit holes prepar’d beforehand, or so soon as the thaw is\r\nuniversal: Some commend the strewing a few oats at the bottom of the\r\nfosses or pits in which you transplant the naked roots, for a great\r\npromotement of their taking, and that it will cause them to shoot more\r\nin one year than in three: But to this I have already spoken. Other\r\nkinds not so rigid, nor the bark, leaf, cone and nuts so large, are\r\nthose call’d the mountain-pine, a very large stately tree: There is\r\nlikewise the wild, or bastard-pine, and _tea_, clad with thin long\r\nleaves, and bearing a turbinated cone: Abundance of excellent rosin\r\ncomes from this tree. There is also the _pinaster_, another of the\r\nwild-kind; but none of them exceeding the Spanish, call’d by us, the\r\nScotch pine, for its tall and erect growth, proper for large and ample\r\nwalks and avenues: Several of the other wild sorts, inclining to grow\r\ncrooked. But for a more accurate description of these coniferous trees,\r\nand their perfect distinctions, consult our Mr. Ray’s most elaborate and\r\nuseful work, where all that can be expected or desir’d, concerning this\r\nprofitable, as well as beautiful tree, is amply set down, _Hist. Plant._\r\nlib. 25. cap. I.\r\n\r\n5. I am assur’d (by a person most worthy of credit) that in the\r\nterritory of Alzey (a country in Germany, where they were miserably\r\ndistressed for wood, which they had so destroy’d as that they were\r\nreduc’d to make use of straw for their best fuel) a very large tract\r\nbeing newly plowed, (but the wars surprizing them, not suffer’d to sow,)\r\nthere sprung up the next year a whole forest of pine-trees, of which\r\nsort of wood there was none at all, within less than fourscore miles; so\r\nas ’tis verily conjectur’d by some, they might be wafted thither from\r\nthe country of Westrasia, which is the nearest part to that where they\r\ngrow: If this be true, we are no more to wonder, how, when our\r\noak-woods are grubb’d up, beech, and trees of other kinds, have\r\nfrequently succeeded them: What some impetuous winds have done in this\r\nnature, I could produce instances almost miraculous: I shall say nothing\r\nof the opinion of our master Varro, and the learned{227:1} Theophrastus,\r\nwho were both of a faith, that the seeds of plants drop’d out of the\r\nair. Pliny in his 16th. book, chap. 33. upon discourse of the Cretan\r\ncypress, attributes much to the _indoles_, and nature of the soil,\r\nvirtue of the climate, and impressions of the air. And indeed it is very\r\nstrange, what is affirm’d of that pitchy-rain, (reported to have fallen\r\nabout Cyrene, the year 430. U. C.) after which, in a short time, sprung\r\nup a whole wood of the trees of _Laserpicium_, producing a precious gum,\r\nnot much inferior to benzoin, if at least the story be warrantable: But\r\nof these aerial irradiations, various conceptions, and æquivocal\r\nproductions without seed, &c. difficulties to be solv’d by our\r\nphilosophers, whence those leaves of the platan come; which Dr. Spon\r\ntells us (in his _Travels_) are found floating in some of the fountains\r\nof the isles of the Strophades; no such tree growing near them by 30\r\nmiles: But these may haply be convey’d thro’ some unknown subterranean\r\npassage; for were it by the wind, it having a very large leaf, they\r\nwould be been flying in, or falling out of the air.\r\n\r\n6. In transplanting of these coniferous trees, which are generally\r\nresinaceous, viz. fir, pine, larix, cedar, and which have but thin and\r\nsingle roots, you must never diminish their heads, nor be at all busie\r\nwith their roots, which pierce deep, and is all their foundation, unless\r\nyou find any of them bruised, or much broken; therefore such down-right\r\nroots as you may be forc’d to cut off, it were safe to sear with an hot\r\niron, and prevent the danger of bleeding, to which they are obnoxious\r\neven to destruction, though unseen, and unheeded: Neither may you\r\ndisbranch them, but with great caution, as about March, or before, or\r\nelse in September, and then ’tis best to prune up the side-branches\r\nclose to the trunk, cutting off all that are above a year old; if you\r\nsuffer them too long, they grow too big, and the cicatrice will be more\r\napt to spend the tree in gum; upon which accident, I advise you to rub\r\nover their wounds with a mixture of cow-dung; the neglect of this cost\r\nme dear, so apt are they to spend their gum. Indeed, the fir and pine\r\nseldom out-live their being lopp’d. Some advise us to break the shells\r\nof pines to facilitate their delivery, and I have essay’d, but to my\r\nloss; nature does obstetricate, and do that office of her self, when it\r\nis the proper season; neither does this preparation at all prevent those\r\nwhich are so buried, whilst their hard integuments protect them both\r\nfrom rotting, and the vermin.\r\n\r\n_Pinastes_, the domestic pine grows very well with us, both in mountains\r\nand plains; but the _pinaster_, or wilder (of which are four sorts) best\r\nfor walks; _pulcherrima in hortis_, (as already we have said) because it\r\ngrows tall and proud, maintaining their branches at the sides, which the\r\nother pine does less frequently. There is in New-England, a very broad\r\npine, which increases to a wonderful bulk and magnitude, insomuch as\r\nlarge canoos have been excavated out of the body of it, without any\r\naddition. But beside these large and gigantick pines, there is the\r\nspinet, with sharp thick bristles, yielding a rosin or liquor odorous,\r\nand useful in carpentary-work.\r\n\r\n8. The fir grows tallest, being planted reasonable close together; but\r\nsuffers nothing to thrive under them. The pine not so inhospitable; for\r\n(by Pliny’s good leave) it may be sown with any tree, all things growing\r\nwell under its shade, and excellent in woods; hence Claudian,\r\n\r\n    The friendly pine the mighty oak invites.{229:1}\r\n\r\n9. They both affect the cold, high, and rocky grounds, _abies in\r\nmontibus altis_: Those yet which grow on the more southern, and less\r\nexpos’d quarters, a little visited with the beams of the sun, are found\r\nto thrive beyond the other, and to afford better timber; and this was\r\nobserved long since by Vitruvius of the _infernates_ (as he calls them)\r\nin comparison with the _supernates_, which growing on the Northern and\r\nshady side of the Appennines, were nothing so good, which he imputes to\r\nthe want of due digestion. They thrive (as we said) in the most sterile\r\nplaces, yet will grow in better, but not in over-rich, and pinguid. The\r\nworst land in Wales bears (as I am told) large pine; and the fir\r\naccording to his aspiring nature, loves also the mountain more than the\r\nvalley; but ἐν τοῖς παλισκίοις ὅλως οὐ φύεται, _it cannot endure the\r\nshade_, as Theophrastus observes, _de Pl._ l. 4. c. 1. But this is not\r\nrigidly true; for they will grow in consort, till they even shade and\r\ndarken one another, and will also descend from the hills, and succeed\r\nvery well, being desirous of plentiful waterings, till they arrive to\r\nsome competent stature; and therefore they do not prosper so well in an\r\nover sandy and hungry soil, or gravel, as in the very entrails of the\r\nrocks, which afford more drink to the roots, that penetrate into their\r\nmeanders, and winding recesses. But though they require this refreshing\r\nat first, yet do they perfectly abhor all stercoration; nor will they\r\nmuch endure to have the earth open’d about their roots for ablaqueation,\r\nor be disturb’d: This is also to be understood of cypress. A fir, for\r\nthe first half dozen years, seems to stand, or at least make no\r\nconsiderable advance, but it is when throughly rooted, that it comes\r\naway miraculously. That honourable and learned knight Sir Norton\r\nKnatchbull, (whose delicious plantation of pines and firs I beheld with\r\ngreat satisfaction) having assur’d me, that a fir-tree of his raising,\r\ndid shoot no less than sixty foot in height, in little more than twenty\r\nyears; and what are extant at Sir Peter Wentworth’s of Lillingston\r\nLovel; Cornbury in Oxfordshire, and other places; but especially those\r\ntrees growing now in Harefield Park in the county of Middlesex\r\n(belonging to Mr. Serjeant Nudigate) where there are two Spanish or\r\nsilver firs, that at 2 years growth from the seed, being planted there\r\n_an._ 1603, are now become goodly masts: The biggest of them from the\r\nground to the upper bough, is 81 feet, though forked on the top, which\r\nhas not a little impeded its growth: The girt, or circumference below,\r\nis thirteen foot, and the length (so far as is timber, that is, to six\r\ninches square) 73 foot, in the middle 17 inches square, amounting by\r\ncalculation to 146 foot of good timber: The other tree is indeed not\r\naltogether so large, by reason of its standing near the house when it\r\nwas burnt (about 40 years since) when one side of the tree was scorched\r\nalso; yet it has not only recover’d that scar, but thrives exceedingly,\r\nand is within eight or nine foot, as tall as the other, and would\r\nprobably have been the better of the two, had not that impediment\r\nhappen’d, it growing so taper, and erect, as nothing can be more\r\nbeautiful: This I think (if we had no other) is a pregnant instance, as\r\nof the speedy growing of that material; so of all the encouragement I\r\nhave already given for the more frequent cultivating this ornamental,\r\nuseful, and profitable tree, abounding doubtless formerly in this\r\ncountrey of ours, if what a grave and authentick author writes be true,\r\nAthenæus relating, that the stupendious vessel, built so many ages since\r\nby Hiero, had its mast out of Britain. Take notice that none of these\r\nmountainous trees should be planted deep; but as shallow as may be for\r\ntheir competent support.\r\n\r\nThe _picea_ (already describ’d) grows on the Alps among the pine, but\r\nneither so tall, nor so upright, but bends its branches a little, which\r\nhave the leaf quite about them, short and thick, not so flat as the fir:\r\nThe cones grow at the point of the branches, and are much longer than\r\nmost other cones, containing a small darkish seed. This tree produces a\r\ngum almost as white and firm as frankincense: But it is the _larix_\r\n(another sort of pine) that yields the true Venetian turpentine; of\r\nwhich hereafter.\r\n\r\n10. There is also the _piceaster_, already mention’d, (a wilder sort)\r\n(the leaves stiff and narrow pointed, and not so close) out of which the\r\ngreatest store of pitch is boil’d. The _taeda_ likewise, which is (as\r\nsome think) another sort abounding in Dalmatia, more unctuous, and more\r\npatient of the warmer situations, and so inflammable, that it will slit\r\ninto candles; and therefore some will by no means admit it to be of a\r\ndifferent species, but a metamorphosis of over-grown fattiness, to which\r\nthe most judicious incline. But of these, the Grand Canaries (and all\r\nabout the mountains near Tenariff) are full, where the inhabitants do\r\nusually build their houses with the timber of the pitch-tree: They cut\r\nit also into wainscot, in which it succeeds marvellously well; abating\r\nthat it is so obnoxious to firing, that whenever a house is attacqu’d,\r\nthey make all imaginable hast out of the conflagration, and almost\r\ndespair of extinguishing it: They there also use it for candle-wood, and\r\nto travel in the night by the light of it, as we do by links and\r\ntorches: Nor do they make these _teas_ (as the Spaniards call them) of\r\nthe wood of pine alone, but of other trees, as of oak and hasel, which\r\nthey cleave and hack, and then dry in the oven, or chimny, but have\r\ncertainly some unctuous and inflammable matter, in which they afterwards\r\ndip it; but thus they do in Biscay, as I am credibly inform’d.\r\n\r\n11. The bodies of these being cut, or burnt down to the ground, will\r\nemit frequent suckers from the roots; but so will neither the pine nor\r\nfir, nor indeed care to be topped: But the fir may be propagated of\r\nlayers, and cuttings, which I divulge as a considerable secret that has\r\nbeen essay’d with success.\r\n\r\n12. That all these, especially the fir and pine will prosper well with\r\nus, is more than probable, because it is a kind of demonstration, that\r\nthey did heretofore grow plentifully in Cumberland, Cheshire, Stafford,\r\nand Lancashire, if the multitudes of these trees to this day found\r\nentire, and buried under the earth, though suppos’d to have been\r\no’rethrown and cover’d so ever since the universal Deluge, be indeed of\r\nthis species: Dr. Plot speaks of a fir-tree in Staffordshire, of 150\r\nfoot high, which some think of spontaneous growth; besides several more\r\nso irregularly standing, as shews them to be natives: But to put this\r\nat last out of controversie, see the extract of Mr. de la Prim’s letter\r\nto the Royal Society, _Transact._ n. 277, and the old map of Crout, and\r\nof the yet (or lately) remaining firs, growing about Hatfield in the\r\ncommons, flourishing from the shrubs and stubs of those trees, to which\r\nI refer the reader. As for buried trees of this sort, the late Dr.\r\nMerrett, in his _Pinax_, mentions several places of this nation, where\r\nsubterraneous-trees are found; as namely, in Cornwal, _ad finem terræ,\r\nin agris Flints_; in Penbroke-shire towards the shore, where they so\r\nabound, _ut totum littus_ (says the Doctor) _tanquam silva cædua\r\napparet_; in Cheshire also (as we said) Cumberland and Anglesey, and\r\nseveral of our Euro-boreal tracts, and are called Noah’s-ark. By\r\nChatnesse in Lancashire (says Camden) the low mossie ground was no very\r\nlong time since, carried away by an impetuous flood, and in that place\r\nnow lies a low irriguous vale, where many prostrate trees have been\r\ndigged out: And from another I receive, that in the moors of\r\nSomersetshire (towards Bridgwater) some lengths of pasture growing much\r\nwithered, and parched more than other places of the same ground, in a\r\ngreat drowth, it was observ’d to bear the length and shape (in gross) of\r\ntrees; they digg’d, and found in the spot oaks, as black as ebony, and\r\nhave been from hence instructed, to take up many hundreds of the same\r\nkind: In a fenny tract of the Isles of Axholme, (lying part in\r\nLincolnshire, and part in Yorkshire) have been found oaks five yards in\r\ncompass, and fifteen in length, some of them erect, and standing as they\r\ngrew; in firm earth below the moors, with abundance of fir, which lie\r\nmore stooping than the oak; some being 36 yards long, besides the tops:\r\nAnd so great is the store of these subterraneans, as the inhabitants\r\nhave for divers years carried away above 2000 cart-loads yearly: See\r\nDugdal’s _History of Draining_. This might be of good use for the like\r\ndetections in Essex, Lincolnshire, and places either low situate, or\r\nadjacent to the sea; also at Binfield Heath in Kent, &c. These trees\r\nwere (some think) carried away in times past, by some accident of\r\ninundation, or by waters undermining the ground, till their own weight,\r\nand the winds bow’d them down, and overwhelm’d them in the mud: For ’tis\r\nobserv’d, that these trees are no where found so frequently, as in boggy\r\nplaces; but that the burning of these trees so very bright, should be an\r\nargument they were fir, is not necessary, since the bituminous quality\r\nof such earth, may have imparted it to them; and Camden denies them to\r\nbe fir-trees; suggesting the query; whether there may not possibly grow\r\ntrees even under the ground, as well as other things? Theophrastus\r\nindeed, l. iv. c. 8. speaks of whole woods; bays and olives, bearing\r\nfruit; and that of some oaks bearing acorns, and those even under the\r\nsea; which was so full of plants and other trees, as (’tis said)\r\nAlexander’s forces sailing to the Indies, were much hindred by them.\r\nThere are in Cumberland, on the sea-shore, trees sometimes discover’d at\r\nlow-water, and at other times that lie buried in the sand; and in other\r\nmossie places of that county, ’tis reported, the people frequently dig\r\nup the bodies of vast trees without boughs, and that by direction of the\r\ndew alone in Summer; for they observe it never lies upon that part under\r\nwhich those trees are interr’d. These particulars I find noted by the\r\ningenious author of the _Britannia Baconica_. How vast a forest, and\r\nwhat goodly trees were once standing in Holland, and those\r\nLow-countries, till about the year 860, that an hurricane obstructing\r\nthe mouth of the Rhine near Catwic, made that horrid devastation, good\r\nauthors mention; and they do this day find monstrous bodies and\r\nbranches, (nay with the very nuts, most intire) of prostrate and buried\r\ntrees, in the Veene, especially towards the south, and at the bottom of\r\nthe waters: Also near Bruges in Flanders, whole woods have been found\r\ntwenty ells deep, in which the trunks, boughs, and leaves do so exactly\r\nappear, as to distinguish their several species, with the series of\r\ntheir leaves yearly falling; of which see Boetius de Boot.\r\n\r\nDr. Plot in his _Nat. Hist._ of _Oxford_ and _Staffordshires_ mentions\r\ndivers subterraneous oaks, black as ebony, and of mineral substance for\r\nhardness; (see cap. 3. oak) quite through the whole substance of the\r\ntimber, caus’d (as he supposes, and learnedly evinces) by a vitriolic\r\nhumour of the earth; of affinity to the nature of the ink-galls, which\r\nthat kind of tree produces: Of these he speaks of some found sunk under\r\nthe ground, in an upright and growing posture, to the perpendicular\r\ndepth of sixty foot; of which one was three foot diameter, of an\r\nhardness emulating the politest ebony: But these trees had none of them\r\ntheir roots, but were found plainly to have been cut off by the kerf:\r\nThere were great store of hasel-nuts, whose shells were as sound as\r\never, but no kernel within. It is there the inquisitive author gives you\r\nhis conjecture, how these deep interments happen’d; namely, by our\r\nancesters (many ages since) clearing the ground for tillage, and when\r\nwood was not worth converting to other uses, digging trenches by the\r\nsides of many trees, in which they buried some; and others they slung\r\ninto quagmires, and lakes to make room for more profitable agriculture:\r\nBut I refer you to the chapter. In the mean time, concerning this\r\nmossie-wood (as they usually term it, because, for the most part, dug-up\r\nin mossie and moory-bogs where they cut for turff) it is highly probable\r\n(with the learned Mr. Ray) that these places were many ages since, part\r\nof firm-land covered with wood, afterwards undermined, and overwhelmed\r\nby the violence of the sea, and so continuing submerg’d, till the rivers\r\nbrought down earth, and mud enough to cover the trees, filling up the\r\nshallows, and restoring them to the _terra-firma_ again, which he\r\nillustrates from the like accident upon the coast of Suffolk, about\r\nDunwich, where the sea does at this day, and hath for many years past,\r\nmuch incroach’d upon the land, undermining, and subverting by degrees, a\r\ngreat deal of high-ground; so as by ancient writings it appears, a whole\r\nwood of more than a mile and half, at present is so far within the sea:\r\nNow if in succeeding ages (as probable it is enough) the sea shall by\r\ndegrees be fill’d up, either by its own working, or by earth brought\r\ndown by land-floods, still subsiding to the bottom, and surmounting the\r\ntops of these trees, and so the space again added to the firm-land; the\r\nmen that shall then live in those parts, will, it’s likely, dig-up these\r\ntrees, and as much wonder how they came there, as we do at present those\r\nwe have been speaking of.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, to put an end to the various conjectures, concerning\r\nthe causes of so many trees being found submerg’d, for the most part\r\nattributed to the destruction made by the Noatick inundation; after all\r\nhas been said of what was found in the level of Hatfield, (drain’d at\r\nthe never to be forgotten charge and industry of Sir Cornelius\r\nVermuiden) I think there will need no more enquiry: For there was\r\ndiscover’d trees not only of fir and pitch, but of very goodly oaks,\r\neven to the length of 100 foot, which were sold at 15 l. the tree,\r\nblack and hard as ebony; all their roots remaining in the soil, and\r\ntheir natural posture, with their bodies prostrate by them, pointing for\r\nthe most part north-east: And of such there seem’d to be millions, of\r\nall the usual species natural to this countrey, sound and firm ash only\r\nexcepted, which were become so rotten, and soft, as to be frequently cut\r\nthrough with the spade only; whereas willows and other tender woods,\r\ncontinu’d very sound and entire: Many of these subterranean trees of all\r\nsorts, were found to have been cut and burnt down, squar’d and converted\r\nfor several uses, into boards, bales, stakes, piles, barrs, &c. some\r\ntrees half riven, with the wedges sticking in them; broken axe-heads in\r\nshape of sacrificing instruments, and frequently several coins of the\r\nemperor Vespasian, &c. There was among others, one prodigious oak of 120\r\nfoot in length, and 12 in diameter, 10 foot in the middle, and 6 at the\r\nsmall end; so as by computation, this monster must have been a great\r\ndeal longer, and for this tree was offered 20 l. The truth and history\r\nof all this is so perfectly describ’d by Mr. Alan. de la Pryme (inserted\r\namong the _Transactions_ of the R. Society) that there needs no more to\r\nbe said of it to evince, that not only here, but in other places, where\r\nsuch trees are found in the like circumstances, that it has been the\r\nwork and effects of vast armies of the Romans, when finding they could\r\nnot with all their force subdue the barbarous inhabitants, by reason of\r\ntheir continual issuing out of those intricate fortresses and\r\nimpediments, they caused whole forests to be cut down by their legions\r\nand soldiers, whom they never suffer’d to remain idle during their\r\nWinter quarters, but were continually exercis’d in such publick and\r\nuseful works, as required multitude of hands; by which discipline they\r\nbecame hardy, active, and less at leisure to mutiny or corrupt one\r\nanother: I do not affirm that this answers all submerg’d trees, but of\r\nvery many imputed to other causes.\r\n\r\nBut we shall enquire farther concerning these subterranean productions\r\nanon, and whether the earth, as well as the water, have not the virtue\r\nof strange transmutations: These trees are found in moors, by poking\r\nwith staves of three or four foot length, shod with iron.\r\n\r\n13. In Scotland many submerged oaks are found near the river Neffe; and\r\n(as we noted) there is a most beautiful sort of fir, or rather pine,\r\nbearing small sharp cones, (some think it the Spanish _pinaster_)\r\ngrowing upon the mountains; of which, from the late Marquess of Argyle,\r\nI had sent me some seeds, which I have sown with tolerable success; and\r\nI prefer them before any other, because they grow both very erect, and\r\nfixing themselves stoutly, need little, or no support. Near Loughbrun,\r\n’twixt the Lough, and an hill, they grow in such quantity, that from the\r\nspontaneous fall, ruin and decay of the trees lying cross one another to\r\na man’s height, partly covered with mosse, and partly earth, and grass\r\n(which rots, fills up, and grows again) a considerable hill has in\r\nprocess of time been raised to almost their very tops, which being an\r\naccident of singular remark, I thought fit to mention. Both fir and\r\npine (sociable trees) planted pretty near together (shread and clipt at\r\nproper seasons) make stately, noble, and very beautiful skreens and\r\nfences to protect orange, myrtile and other curious greens, from the\r\nscorching of the sun, and ruffling winds, preferrable to walls: See how\r\nto be planted and cultivated with the dimensions of a skreen, in the\r\nrules for the defence of gardens, annext to _de la Quintin_, num. xv. by\r\nMr. London, and Mr. Wise. In the mean time, none of these sorts are to\r\nbe mingled in taller woods or copp’ces, in which they starve one\r\nanother, and lose their beauty. And now those who would see what\r\nScotland produces (of innumerable trees of this kind) should consult the\r\nlearned Sir Rob. Sibald.\r\n\r\n14. For the many, and almost universal use of these trees, both sea and\r\nland will plead,\r\n\r\n    The useful pine for ships..........{239:1}\r\n\r\nHence Papinius 6. _Thebaid._ calls it _audax abies_. They make our best\r\nmast, sheathing, scaffold-poles, &c. heretofore the whole vessel; It is\r\npretty (saith Pliny) to consider, that those trees which are so much\r\nsought after for shipping, should most delight in the highest of\r\nmountains, as if it fled from the sea on purpose, and were afraid to\r\ndescend into the waters. With fir we likewise make all intestine works,\r\nas wainscot, floors, pales, balks, laths, boxes, bellies for all musical\r\ninstruments in general, nay the ribs and sides of that enormous\r\nstratagem, the so famous Trojan{239:2} horse, may be thought to be\r\nbuilt of this material, and if the poet mistake not,\r\n\r\n    ..........The ribs with deal they fit.{240:1}\r\n\r\nThere being no material more obedient and ready to bend for such works.\r\n\r\nIn Holland they receive their best mast out of Norway, and even as far\r\nas Moscovy, which are best esteemed, (as consisting of long fibers,\r\nwithout knots) but deal-boards from the first; and though fir rots\r\nquickly in salt-water, it does not so soon perish in fresh; nor do they\r\nyet refuse it in merchant-ships, especially the upper-parts of them,\r\nbecause of its lightness: The true pine was ever highly commended by the\r\nAncients for naval architecture, as not so easily decaying; and we read\r\nthat Trajan caused vessels to be built both of the true, and spurious\r\nkind, well pitch’d, and over-laid with lead, which perhaps might hint\r\nour modern sheathing with that metal at present. Fir is exceeding smooth\r\nto polish on, and therefore does well under gilding-work, and takes\r\nblack equal with the pear-tree: Both fir, and especially pine, succeed\r\nwell in carving, as for capitals, festoons, nay, statues, especially\r\nbeing gilded, because of the easiness of the grain, to work and take the\r\ntool every way; and he that shall examine it nearly, will find that\r\nfamous image of the B. Virgin at Loretto, (reported to be carved by the\r\nhands of St. Luke) to be made of fir, as the grain easily discovers it:\r\nThe _torulus_ (as Vitruvius terms it) and heart of deal, kept dry,\r\nrejecting the _albumen_ and white, is everlasting; nor does there any\r\nwood so well agree with the glew, as it, or is so easie to be wrought:\r\nIt is also excellent for beams, and other timber-work in houses, being\r\nboth light, and exceedingly strong, and therefore of very good use for\r\nbars, and bolts of doors, as well as for doors themselves, and for the\r\nbeams of coaches, a board of an inch and half thick, will carry the body\r\nof a coach with great ease, by reason of a natural spring which it has,\r\nnot easily violated. You shall find, that of old they made carts and\r\nother carriages of it; and for piles to superstruct on in boggy grounds;\r\nmost of Venice, and Amsterdam is built upon them, with so excessive\r\ncharge, as some report, the foundations of their houses cost as much, as\r\nwhat is erected on them; there being driven in no fewer than 13659 great\r\nmasts of this timber, under the new Stadt-house of Amsterdam. For\r\nscaffolding also there is none comparable to it; and I am sure we find\r\nit an extraordinary saver of oak, where it may be had at reasonable\r\nprice. I will not complain what an incredible mass of ready money, is\r\nyearly exported into the northern countries for this sole commodity,\r\nwhich might all be saved were we industrious at home, or could have them\r\nout of Virginia, there being no country in the whole world stor’d with\r\nbetter; besides, another sort of wood which they call cypress, much\r\nexceeding either fir or pine for this purpose; being as tough and\r\nspringy as yew, and bending to admiration; it is also lighter than\r\neither, and everlasting in wet or dry; so as I much wonder, that we\r\nenquire no more after it: In a word, not only here and there an house,\r\nbut whole towns, and great cities are, and have been built of fir only;\r\nnor that alone in the north, as Mosco, &c. where the very streets are\r\npav’d with it, (the bodies of the trees lying prostrate one by one in\r\nmanner of a raft) but the renowned city of Constantinople; and nearer\r\nhome Tholose in France, was within little more than an hundred years,\r\nmost of fir, which is now wholly marble and brick, after 800 houses had\r\nbeen burnt, as it often chances at Constantinople; but where no accident\r\neven of this devouring nature, will at all move them to re-edifie with\r\nmore lasting materials. To conclude with the uses of fir, we have most\r\nof our pot-ashes of this wood, together with torch, or funebral-staves;\r\nnay, and of old, spears of it, if we may credit Virgil’s Amazonian\r\ncombat,\r\n\r\n    ................. She prest\r\n    A long fir-spear through his exposed breast.{242:1}\r\n\r\nLastly, the very chips, or shavings of deal-boards, are of other use\r\nthan to kindle fires alone: Thomas Bartholinus in his _Medicina Danorum\r\nDissert._ 7, &c. where he disclaims the use of hops in beer, (as\r\npernicious and malignant, and from several instances how apt it is to\r\nproduce and usher in infections, nay, plagues, &c.) would substitute in\r\nits place, the shavings of deal-boards, as he affirms, to give a\r\ngrateful odor to the drink; and how soveraign those resinous-woods, the\r\ntops of fir, and pines, are against the scorbut, gravel in the kidneys,\r\n&c. we generally find: It is in the same chapter, that he commends also\r\nwormwood, _marrubium_, _chamelæagnum_, sage, tamarisc, and almost any\r\nthing, rather than hops. The bark of the pine heals ulcers; and the\r\ninner rind cut small, contus’d, and boil’d in store of water, is an\r\nexcellent remedy for burns and scalds, washing the sore with the\r\ndecoction, and applying the softned bark: It is also soveraign against\r\nfrozen and benumb’d limbs: The distill’d water of the green cones takes\r\naway the wrinkles of the face, dipping cloaths therein, and laying them\r\non it becomes a cosmetic not to be despis’d. The pine, or _picea_ buried\r\nin the earth never decay: From the latter transudes a very bright and\r\npellucid gum; hence we have likewise rosin; also of the pine are made\r\nboxes and barrels for dry goods; yea, and it is cloven into (_scandulæ_)\r\nshingles for the covering of houses in some places; also hoops for\r\nwine-vessels, especially of the easily flexible wild-pine; not to forget\r\nthe kernels (this tree being always furnish’d with cones, some ripe,\r\nothers green) of such admirable use in emulsions; and for tooth-pickers,\r\neven the very leaves are commended: In sum, they are plantations which\r\nexceedingly improve the air, by their odoriferous and balsamical\r\nemissions and, for ornament, create a perpetual Spring where they are\r\nplentifully propagated. And if it could be proved that the\r\n_almugim_-trees, recorded{243:1} 1 _Reg._ 11, 12. (whereof pillars for\r\nthat famous temple, and the royal palace, harps, and psalteries, &c.\r\nwere made) were of this sort of wood (as some doubt not to assert) we\r\nshould esteem it at another rate; yet we know Josephus affirms they were\r\na kind of pine-tree, though somewhat resembling the fig-tree wood to\r\nappearance, as of a most lustrous candor. In the 2 _Chron._ 2, 8. there\r\nis mention of almug-trees to grow in Lebanon; and if so, methinks it\r\nshould rather be (as Buxtorf thinks) a kind of cedar; (yet we find fir\r\nalso in the same period) for we have seen a whiter sort of it, even very\r\nwhite as well as red; though some affirm it to be but the sap of it (so\r\nour cabinet-makers call it) I say, there were both fir and pine-trees\r\nalso growing upon those mountains, and the learned Meibomius, (in that\r\ncurious treatise of his _De Fabrica Triremium_) shews that there were\r\nsuch trees brought out of India, or Ophir. In the mean time, Mr. Purchas\r\ninforms us, that Dr. Dee writ a laborious treatise almost wholly of this\r\nsubject, (but I could never have the good hap to see it) wherein, as\r\ncommissioner for Solomon’s timber, and like a learned architect and\r\nplanter, he has summon’d a jury of twelve sorts of trees; namely, 1. the\r\nfir, 2. box, 3. cedar, 4. cypress, 5. ebony, 6. ash, 7. juniper, 8.\r\nlarch, 9. olive, 10. pine, 11. oak, and 12. sandal-trees, to examine\r\nwhich of them were this _almugim_, and at last seems to concur with\r\nJosephus, in favour of pine or fir; who possibly, from some antient\r\nrecord, or fragment of the wood it self, might learn something of it;\r\nand ’tis believ’d, that it was some material both odoriferous to the\r\nscent, and beautiful to the eye, and of fittest temper to refract\r\nsounds; besides its serviceableness for building; all which properties\r\nare in the best sort of pine or _thyina_, as Pliny calls it; or perhaps\r\nsome other rare wood, of which the Eastern Indies are doubtless the best\r\nprovided; and yet I find, that those vast beams which sustain’d the roof\r\nof St. Peter’s church at Rome, laid (as reported) by Constantine the\r\nGreat, were made of the pitch-tree, and have lasted from _anno_ 336,\r\ndown to our days, above 1300 years.\r\n\r\n13. But now whilst I am reciting the uses of these beneficial\r\ntrees,{245:1} Mr. Winthorp presents the Royal Society with the process\r\nof making the tar and pitch in New-England, which we thus abbreviate.\r\nTar is made out of that sort of pine-tree, from which naturally\r\nturpentine extilleth; and which at its first flowing out, is liquid and\r\nclear; but being hardned by the air, either on the tree, or where-ever\r\nit falls, is not much unlike the Burgundy pitch; and we call them\r\npitch-pines out of which this gummy substance transudes: They grow upon\r\nthe most barren plains, on rocks also, and hills rising amongst those\r\nplains, where several are found blown down, and have lain so many ages,\r\nas that the whole bodies, branches, and roots of the trees being\r\nperished, some certain knots only of the boughs have been left remaining\r\nintire, (these knots are that part where the bough is joyn’d to the body\r\nof the tree) lying at the same distance and posture, as they grew upon\r\nthe tree for its whole length. The bodies of some of these trees are not\r\ncorrupted through age, but quite consum’d, and reduc’d to ashes, by the\r\nannual burnings of the Indians, when they set their grounds on fire;\r\nwhich yet has, it seems, no power over these hard knots, beyond a black\r\nscorching; although being laid on heaps, they are apt enough to burn. It\r\nis of these knots they make their tar in New-England, and the country\r\nadjacent, whilst they are well impregnated with that terebinthine, and\r\nresinous matter, which like a balsom, preserves them so long from\r\nputrefaction. The rest of the tree does indeed contain the like\r\nterebinthine sap, as appears (upon any slight incision of bark on the\r\nstem, or boughs) by a small crystalline pearl which will sweat out; but\r\nthis, for being more watery and undigested, by reason of the porosity of\r\nthe wood, which exposes it to the impressions of the air and wet,\r\nrenders the tree more obnoxious; especially, if it lie prostrate with\r\nthe bark on, which is a receptacle for a certain intercutaneous worm,\r\nthat accelerates its decay. They are the knots then alone, which the\r\ntar-makers amass in heaps, carrying them in carts to some convenient\r\nplace not far off, where finding clay or loam fit for their turn, they\r\nlay an hearth of such ordinary stone as they have at hand: This, they\r\nbuild to such an height from the level of the ground, that a vessel may\r\nstand a little lower than the hearth, to receive the tar as it runs out:\r\nBut first, the hearth is made wide, according to the quantity of knots\r\nto be set at once, and that with a very smooth floor of clay, yet\r\nsomewhat descending, or dripping from the extream parts to the middle,\r\nand thence towards one of the sides, where a gullet is left for the tar\r\nto run out at. The hearth thus finish’d, they pile the knots one upon\r\nanother, after the very same manner as our colliers do their wood for\r\ncharcoal; and of a height proportionable to the breadth of the hearth;\r\nand then cover them over with a coat of loam, or clay, (which is best)\r\nor in defect of those, with the best and most tenacious earth the place\r\nwill afford; leaving only a small spiracle at the top, whereat to put\r\nthe fire in; and making some little holes round about at several\r\nheights, for the admission of so much air, as is requisite to keep it\r\nburning, and to regulate the fire, by opening and stopping them at\r\npleasure. The process is almost the same with that of making charcoal,\r\nas will appear in due place; for, when it is well on fire, that middle\r\nhole is also stopp’d, and the rest of the registers so govern’d, as the\r\nknots may keep burning, and not be suffocated with too much smoak;\r\nwhilst all being now through-heated, the tar runs down to the hearth,\r\ntogether with some of the more watry sap, which hasting from all parts\r\ntowards the middle, is convey’d by the foremention’d gutter, into the\r\nbarrel or vessel placed to receive it: Thus, the whole art of tar-making\r\nis no other, than a kind of rude distillation _per descensum_, and might\r\ntherefore be as well done in furnaces of large capacity, were it worth\r\nthe expence. When the tar is now all melted out, and run, they stop up\r\nall the vents very close; and afterwards find the knots made into\r\nexcellent charcoal, preferr’d by the smiths before any other whatsoever,\r\nwhich is made of wood; and nothing so apt to burn out when their blast\r\nceaseth; neither do they sparkle in the fire, as many other sorts of\r\ncoal do; so as, in defect of sea-coal, they make choice of this, as best\r\nfor their use, and give greater prices for it. Of these knots likewise\r\ndo the planters split out small slivers, about the thickness of one’s\r\nfinger, or somewhat thinner, which serve them to burn instead of\r\ncandles; giving a very good light. This they call candle-wood, and it is\r\nin much use both in New-England, Virginia, and amongst the Dutch\r\nplanters in their villages; but for that it is something offensive, by\r\nreason of the much fuliginous smoak which comes from it, they commonly\r\nburn it in the chimney-corner, upon a flat stone or iron; except,\r\noccasionally, they carry a single stick in their hand, as there is need\r\nof light to go about the house. It must not be conceiv’d, by what we\r\nhave mention’d in the former description of the knots, that they are\r\nonly to be separated from the bodies of the trees by devouring time, or\r\nthat they are the only materials, out of which tar can be extracted: For\r\nthere are in these tracts, millions of trees which abound with the same\r\nsort of knots, and full of turpentine fit to make tar: But the labour of\r\nfelling these trees, and of cutting out their knots, would far exceed\r\nthe value of the tar; especially, in countries where work-men are so\r\nvery dear: But those knots above-mention’d, are provided to hand,\r\nwithout any other labour, than the gathering only. There are sometimes\r\nfound of those sort of pine-trees, the lowest part of whose stems\r\ntowards the root is as full of turpentine, as the knots; and of these\r\nalso may tar be made: But such trees being rarely found, are commonly\r\npreserved to split into candle-wood; because they will be easily riven\r\nout into any lengths, and scantlings desir’d, much better than the\r\nknots. There be, who pretend an art of as fully impregnating the body of\r\nany living pine-tree, for six or eight foot high; and some have reported\r\nthat such an art is practis’d in Norway: But upon several experiments,\r\nby girdling the tree (as they call it) and cutting some of the bark\r\nround, and a little into the wood of the tree, six or eight foot distant\r\nfrom the ground, it has yet never succeeded; whether the just season of\r\nthe year were not observ’d, or what else omitted, were worth the\r\ndisquisition; if at least there be any such secret amongst the\r\nNorwegians, Swedes, or any other nation. Of tar, by boiling it to a\r\nsufficient height, is pitch made: And in some places where rosin is\r\nplentiful, a fit proportion of that, may be dissolv’d in the tar whilst\r\nit is boiling, and this mixture is soonest converted to pitch; but it is\r\nof somewhat a differing kind from that which is made of tar only,\r\nwithout other composition. There is a way which some ship-carpenters in\r\nthose countries have us’d, to bring their tar into pitch for any sudden\r\nuse; by making the tar so very hot in an iron-kettle, that it will\r\neasily take fire, which when blazing, and set in an airy place, they let\r\nburn so long, till, by taking out some small quantity for trial, being\r\ncold, it appears of a sufficient consistence: Then, by covering the\r\nkettle close, the fire is extinguish’d, and the pitch is made without\r\nmore ceremony. There is a process of making rosin also, out of the same\r\nknots, by splitting them out into thin pieces, and then boiling them in\r\nwater, which will educe all the resinous matter, and gather it into a\r\nbody, which (when cold) will harden into pure rosin. It is moreover to\r\nbe understood, that the fir, and most coniferous trees, yield the same\r\nconcretes, _lachrymæ_, turpentines, and there is a fir which exstills a\r\ngum not unlike the balm of Gilead, and a sort of _tus_; rosins, hard,\r\nnaval stone, liquid pitch, and tar for remedies against the cough,\r\narthritic and pulmonic affections; are well known, and the chyrurgion\r\nuses them in plaisters also; and in a word, for mechanic and other\r\ninnumerable uses; and from the burning fuliginous vapour of these,\r\nespecially the rosin, we have our lamp, and printers black, &c. I am\r\nperswaded the pine, pitch and fir trees in Scotland, might yield His\r\nMajesty plenty of excellent tar, were some industrious person employ’d\r\nabout the work; so as I wonder it has been so long neglected. But there\r\nis another process not much unlike the former, which is given us by the\r\npresent archbishop of Samos, Joseph Georgirenes, in his description of\r\nthat, and other islands of the Ægæan.\r\n\r\nTheir way of making pitch (says he) is thus: They take sapines, that\r\nis, that part of the fir, so far as it hath no knots; and shaving away\r\nthe extream parts, leave only that which is nearest to the middle, and\r\nthe pith: That which remains, they call _dadi_ (from the old Greek word\r\nΔᾶδες, whence the Latin, _taeda_): These they split into small pieces,\r\nand laying them on a furnace, put fire to the upper part, till they are\r\nall burnt, the liquor in the mean time running from the wood, and let\r\nout from the bottom of the furnace, into a hole made in the ground,\r\nwhere it continues like oyl: Then they put fire to’t, and stir it about\r\ntill it thicken, and has a consistence: After this, putting out the\r\nfire, they cast chalk upon it, and draw it out with a vessel, and lay it\r\nin little places cut out of the ground, where it receives both its form,\r\nand a firmer body for easie transportation: Thus far the archbishop; but\r\nit is not so instructive and methodical as what we have describ’d above.\r\n\r\nOther processes for the extracting of these substances, may be seen in\r\nMr. Ray’s _Hist. Plant._, already mentioned, lib. xxix. cap. 1. And as\r\nto pitch and tar, how they make it near Marselles, in France, from the\r\npines growing about that city, see _Philos. Trans._ n. 213. p. 291.\r\n_an._ 1696, very well worthy the transcribing, if what is mentioned in\r\nthis chapter were at all defective.\r\n\r\nI had in the former editions of _Sylva_, plac’d the _larix_ among the\r\ntrees which shed their leaves in Winter (as indeed does this) but not\r\nbefore there is an almost immediate supply of fresh; and may therefore,\r\nboth for its similitude, stature, and productions, challenge rank among\r\nthe coniferous: We raise it of seeds, and grows spontaneously in Stiria,\r\nCarinthia, and other Alpine Countries: The change of the colour of the\r\nold leaf, made an ignorant gardiner of mine erradicate what I had\r\nbrought up with much care, as dead; let this therefore be a warning: The\r\nleaves are thin, pretty long and bristly; the cones small, grow\r\nirregular, as do the branches, like the cypress, a very beautiful tree,\r\nthe pondrous branches bending a little, which makes it differ from the\r\nLibanus cedar, to which some would have it ally’d, nor are any found in\r\nSyria. Of the deep wounded bark, exsudes the purest of our\r\nshop-turpentine, (at least as reputed) as also the drug _agaric_: That\r\nit flourishes with us, a tree of good stature (not long since to be seen\r\nabout Chelmsford in Essex) sufficiently reproaches our not cultivating\r\nso useful a material for many purposes, where lasting and substantial\r\ntimber is required: For we read of beams of no less than 120 foot in\r\nlength, made out of this goodly tree, which is of so strange a\r\ncomposition, that ’twill hardly burn; whence Mantuan, _et robusta larix\r\nigni impenetrabile lignum_: for so Cæsar found it in a castle he\r\nbesieg’d, built of it; (the story is recited at large by Vitruvius, l.\r\n2. c. 9.) but see what Philander says upon the place, on his own\r\nexperience: Yet the coals thereof were held far better than any other,\r\nfor the melting of iron, and the lock-smith; and to say the truth, we\r\nfind they burn it frequently as common fuel in the Valtoline, if at\r\nleast it be the true _larix_, which they now call _melere_. There is\r\nabundance of this larch timber in the buildings at Venice, especially\r\nabout the palaces in Piazza San Marco, where I remember Scamozzi says he\r\nhimself us’d much of it, and infinitely commends it. Nor did they only\r\nuse it in houses, but in naval architecture also: The ship mention’d by\r\nWitsen (a late Dutch writer of that useful art) to have been found not\r\nlong since in the Numidian Sea, twelve fathoms under water, being\r\nchiefly built of this timber, and cypress, both reduc’d to that\r\ninduration and hardness, as greatly to resist the fire, and the sharpest\r\ntool; nor was any thing perished of it, though it had lain above a\r\nthousand and four hundred years submerg’d: The decks were cover’d with\r\nlinnen, and plates of lead, fixed with nails guilt, and the intire ship\r\n(which contain’d thirty foot in length) so stanch, as not one drop of\r\nwater had soaked into any room. Tiberius we find built that famous\r\nbridge to his _Naumachia_ with this wood, and it seems to excel for\r\nbeams, doors, windows, and masts of ships, resists the worm: Being\r\ndriven into the ground, it is almost petrified, and will support an\r\nincredible weight; which (and for its property of long resisting fire)\r\nmakes Vitruvius wish, they had greater plenty of it at Rome to make\r\ngoists of, where the Forum of Augustus was (it seems) built of it, and\r\ndivers bridges by Tiberius; for that being attempted with fire, it is\r\nlong in taking hold, growing only black without; and the timber of it is\r\nso exceedingly transparent, that cabanes being made of the thin boards,\r\nwhen in the dark night they have lighted candles in them, people, who\r\nare at a distance without doors, would imagine the whole room to be on\r\nfire, which is pretty odd, considering there is no material so (as they\r\npretend) unapt to kindle. The _larix_ bears polishing excellently well,\r\nand the turners abroad much desire it: Vitruvius says ’tis so ponderous,\r\nthat it will sink in the water: It also makes everlasting spouts,\r\npent-houses, and featheridge, which needs neither pitch or painting to\r\npreserve them; and so excellent pales, posts, rails, pedaments and\r\nprops for vines, &c. to which add the palats on which our painters\r\nseparate and blend their colours, and were (till the use of canvas and\r\nbed-tike came) the tables on which the great Raphael, and most famous\r\nartists of the last age, eterniz’d their skill.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n{227:1} De causis, l. 1. cap. 5.\r\n\r\n{229:1}\r\n\r\n    Et comitem quercum pinus amica trahit.\r\n\r\n{239:1}\r\n\r\n    ......dant utile lignum\r\n    Navigiis pinus.......\r\n\r\n    _Georg. 2._\r\n\r\n{239:2} _Macrob.

But now after all the beautiful and stately trees, clad in perpetual\r\nverdure,\r\n\r\n    _Quid tibi odorato referam sudantia ligno?_\r\n\r\nShould I forget the cedar? which grows in all extreams; in the moist\r\nBarbadoes, the hot Bermudas, (I speak of those trees so denominated) the\r\ncold New England, even where the snows lie, as I am told, almost half\r\nthe Year; for so it does on the mountains of Libanus, from whence I have\r\nreceived cones and seeds of those few remaining trees: why then should\r\nthey not thrive in old England, I know not, save for want of industry\r\nand trial.\r\n\r\nThey grow in the bogs of America, and in the mountains of Asia; so as\r\nthere is, it seems, no place or clime which affrights it; and I have\r\nfrequently rais’d them from their seeds and berries, of which we have\r\nthe very best in the world from the Summer-Islands, though now almost\r\nexhausted by the unaccountable negligence of the planters; as are\r\nlikewise those of M. Libanus, by the wandring and barbarous Arabs. The\r\ncedars we have from Jamaica, are a spurious sort and of so porous a\r\ncontexture, that wine will sink into it: On the contrary, that of\r\nCarolina so firm and close, that barrels, and other vessels, preserve\r\nthe strongest spirits in vigour: The New England cedar is a lofty\r\ngrower, and prospers into excellent timber, which being sawn into\r\nplanks, make delicate floors: They shingle their houses also with it,\r\nand generally employ it in all their buildings: Why have we no more of\r\nit brought us, to raise, plant, and convert to the same uses? There is\r\nthe _oxycedrus_ of Lycia, which the architect Vitruvius describes, to\r\nhave its leaf like cypress; but the right Phœnician resembles more the\r\njuniper, bearing a cone not so pointed as the other, as we shall come to\r\nshew.\r\n\r\nAfter these, I shall not here descend to the inferior kinds, which some\r\ncall dwarfs, and common juniper-like shrubs, fitter to head the borders\r\nof coronary gardners, and to be shorn. There is yet another of the\r\nNorth-America, lighter than cork it self, of a fragrant scent, which is\r\nits only virtue. In short,\r\n\r\nAfter all these exotics brought from our plantations, answering to the\r\nname of cedar, I should esteem that of the Vermuda, little inferior, if\r\nnot superior, to the noblest Libanon, and next, that of Carolina for its\r\nmany uses, and lasting.\r\n\r\nHaving spoken of their several species, we come now to the culture, best\r\nrais’d from the seeds, since it would be difficult to receive any store\r\nfrom abroad: To begin with that of M. Libanus; Those which seem of the\r\ngreatest antiquity, are indeed majestical, extending the boughs and\r\nbranches, with their cones _sursum spectantia_, as by most we are told;\r\nthough a late{255:1} traveller found otherwise, and depending, like\r\nother coniferous trees; the sturdy arms, though in smaller sprigs, grow\r\nin time so weighty, as often to bend the very stem, and main shaft,\r\nwhilst that which is most remarkable, is the structure of the cones and\r\nseeds receptacles, tack’d and rang’d between the branch-leaves, in such\r\norder, as nothing appears more curious and artificial, and at a little\r\ndistance, exceedingly beautiful: These cones have the bases rounder,\r\nshorter, or rather thicker, and with blunter points, the whole\r\ncircum-zon’d, as it were, with pretty broad thick scales, which adhere\r\ntogether in exact series to the very top and summit, where they are\r\nsomewhat smaller; but the entire lorication smoother couch’d than those\r\nof the fir-kind: Within these repositories under the scales, nestle the\r\nsmall nutting seeds, or rather kernels, of a pear-shape, though somewhat\r\nbigger; which how nourish’d and furnish’d from the central style, with\r\ntheir other integuments, is admirably describ’d by Mr. Ray, as that of\r\nthe stalk of the clogs, thicker and longer, and so firmly knit to them,\r\nthat it requires considerable force to part them from the branch,\r\nwithout splitting the arm it self. We have said nothing concerning the\r\nleaf of this tree, which much resembles those of the _larix_, but\r\nsomewhat longer and closer set, erect and perpetually green, which those\r\nof the larch are not; but hanging down, drop-off, and desert the tree in\r\nWinter.\r\n\r\nThe seeds drop out of the cones as other fir, pine-kernels and nuts do,\r\nwhen the air, sun, or moisture open and unglue the scales, which\r\nnaturally it else does not in those of the cedar till the second year;\r\nbut which after all the preparations of burying in holes made in the\r\nearth and sand (in which they are apter to rot) may more safely be done,\r\nby exposing the clogs discreetly to the sun, or before the soft and\r\ngentle fire, or I think, best of all, by soaking them in warm-water: The\r\ncones (thus discharged) the gaping seeds, together with the rest of the\r\nskeleton, adhere a long while to the branches, which not seldom hang on\r\nabove two years; as we likewise find in those of other resinous trees,\r\nthough falling sooner.\r\n\r\nThe _lachrymæ_, gum, and other transudations, serving more for unguents\r\nand the chyrurgeon’s box, than for other medicaments, in which we find\r\nPliny has little faith: But that which is more remarkable, is the virtue\r\nof the famous timber of this noble tree, being proof against all\r\nputrefaction of human and other bodies, above all other ingredients and\r\ncompositions of embalmers; and that by a pretty contradiction, giving\r\nlife as it were to the dead, and destroying the worms which are living;\r\nand as it does where any goods are kept in chests and presses of the\r\nwood, excepting woollen-cloth and furs, which ’tis observ’d they\r\ncorrupt. In the mean time, touching the manner of these operations, as\r\nit concerns the preservation of the dead, see more where we speak of\r\ncypress, &c. The effects being ascrib’d to the extream bitterness of the\r\nresinous juices, whilst the odor is most grateful: The worthy Mr. Ray\r\nmentions the powder and sawdust of cedar to be one of the greatest\r\nsecrets us’d by our pollinctors and mountebanks, who pretend to this\r\nembalming mystery; and indeed, that the dust and very chips are exitial\r\nto moths and worms, daily experience shews us; tho’ none in mine, than\r\nthe dry’d leaves and stalks of _Marum-Syriacum_, familiarly planted in\r\nour gardens: What therefore the late traveller Dampier speaks of cedar,\r\nwhich he has seen worm-eaten, could neither be that of Libanus or\r\nBermudas, but haply of Barbados, Jamaica, or some other species: note,\r\nthat the cedar is of so dry a nature, that it does not well endure to be\r\nfastened with nails, from which it usually shrinks, and therefore pins\r\nof the same wood are better. Whatever other property this noble tree is\r\ndeservedly famous for, it is said to yield an oyl, which above all\r\nother, best preserves the monuments of the learned, books and writings;\r\nwhence _cedro dignus_ became one of the highest eulogies: But whether\r\nthat of the ingenius poet,\r\n\r\n    _Notandus minio, nec cedro charta notatur,_\r\n\r\nrefers not to the colour rather, which was usually red, and perhaps\r\ntemper’d with this bitter oyl (as some conjecture) let our antiquaries\r\ndetermine: The horns and knobs at the ends of the rolling-staves, on\r\nwhich those sheets of parchment, &c. (before the invention of printing,\r\nand compacted covers now in use) as at present our maps and geographical\r\ncharts (peeping out a little beyond the volume) were likely colour’d\r\nwith this rutilant mixture.\r\n\r\nTouching the diüternity of this material, ’tis recorded, that in the\r\ntemple of Apollo Utica, there was found timber of near two thousand\r\nyears old; and at Sagunti in Spain, a beam in a certain oratory\r\nconsecrated to Diana, which has been brought to Zant, two centuries\r\nbefore the destruction of Troy: That great Sesostris King of Egypt had\r\nbuilt a vessel of cedar of 280 cubits, all over gilded without and\r\nwithin: And the Goddess in the famous Ephesine temple, was said to be\r\nof this material also, as was most of the timber-work of that glorious\r\nstructure: Though as to the idol τοῦ Διοπετοῦς mention’d in the Acts,\r\n(when the mob rose up against the apostle) some will have to be of\r\nebony, others of a vine-tree, the most unlikely of all the rest fit for\r\nthe carver. The _sittim_ mention’d in Holy Writ, is thought to have been\r\na kind of cedar of which most precious utensils were formed.\r\n\r\nAs to the magnitude of cedar-trees: We read of divers whose bodies eight\r\nor nine persons could not embrace, (as we shall shew hereafter) not here\r\nto let pass what Josephus relates Solomon planted in Judea, who\r\ndoubtless try’d many experiments of this nature, none being more kingly\r\nthan of planting for posterity: I do not speak of those growing on the\r\nmountains of Libanon, in the northern and colder tracts of Syria; or\r\nwhat store those forests of them then afforded: But, as we are inform’d\r\nby that curious traveller{258:1} Ranwolsius, (since confirm’d also by\r\nthe _virtuoso_, Monconys) there were not remaining above twenty five of\r\nthose stately trees, and since they were there, but sixteen of that\r\nsmall number, as the ingenious Mr. Mandevill reports in his journey from\r\nAleppo to Jerusalem: There was yet, he says, abundance of young trees,\r\nand a single old one of prodigious size, twelve yards and six inches in\r\nthe girth; I suppose the same describ’d by the late traveller Bruyn, who\r\nspeaking of the shadow of this umbragious tree, alludes to that of\r\nHosea, Cap. XIV. Ver. 5. which ’tis not improbable might be one of those\r\nyet remaining, where that heroick prince employ’d fourscore thousand\r\nhewers at work, for the materials of one only temple, and the palace he\r\nbuilt in the city; a pregnant instance what time, negligence and war\r\nwill bring to ruin. But to return to what is said of their present\r\nnumber, Le Bruyn (whom just now we mention’d) makes them 35 or 36, for\r\nhe could not exactly tell, and pretends (like our Stonedge on Salisbury\r\nPlain) none could ever yet agree of their number.\r\n\r\nIn short, upon reflection of what we have hitherto concerning the\r\nuniversal waste and destruction of timber trees, (where due regard is\r\nnot taken to propagate and supply them) whole countries have suffer’d,\r\nas well as particular provinces: Thus the Apennines are stripp’d of\r\ntheir goodly pine and fir-trees (which formerly the naturalist commends\r\nthose mountains for) to that degree, as to render not only the city of\r\nFlorence, but Rome her self so expos’d to the nipping Tramontan’s (for\r\nso they call the northern winds) that almost nothing which is rare and\r\ncurious, will thrive without hyemation and art; so as even thro’ the\r\nmost of those parts of Italy, on this side the Kingdom of Naples,\r\nflank’d by the Alpestral Hills, (clad as they perpetually are with snow)\r\nthey are fain to house, and retire their orange, citron, and other\r\ndelicate and tender plants, as we do in England. There remains yet one\r\nmountain among the Appennines, cover’d and crown’d with cypress; whereof\r\nsome are of considerable stature: Nor is all this indeed so great a\r\nwonder, if we find the entire species of some trees totally lost in\r\ncountries, as if there never had been any such planted or growing in\r\nthem: Be this applied to fir and pine, and several other trees, for want\r\nof culture, several accidents in the soil, air, &c. which we daily find\r\nproduces strange alterations in our woods; the beech almost constantly\r\nsucceeding the oak, to our great disadvantage; whilst we neglect new\r\nseminations. Herodotus speaking of the palms, (plentifully growing about\r\nDelos) says the whole species was utterly lost: More I might add on this\r\nsubject; but having perhaps been too long on these remarks, and long\r\nenough on cold M. Libanus, I pass to,\r\n\r\n1. Juniper; let it not seem unduly plac’d, if after such gyants, we\r\nbring that humble shrub (such as abound with us being so reckon’d) to\r\nclaim affinity to the tallest cedar; since were not ours continually\r\ncropp’d, but maintain’d in single stems, we might perhaps see some of\r\nthem rise to competent trees; fit for many curious works, tables,\r\ncabinets, coffers, inlaying, floors, carvings, &c. we have of some of\r\nthese trees so large, as to have made beams and rafters for a certain\r\ntemple in Spain, dedicated to Diana; nor need we question their being\r\nfit for other buildings; celebrated for its emulating the cedar, tho’\r\nnot in stature, yet in its lastingness: And such, I think, the learned\r\nDr. Sloane mentions growing in Jamaica, little inferior to the Vermudas.\r\n\r\n2. Of juniper, we have three or four sorts, male, female, dwarf; whereof\r\none is much taller, and more fit for improvement. The wood is yellow,\r\nand being cut in March, sweet as cedar, whereof it is accounted a\r\nspurious kind; all of them difficult to remove with success; nor\r\nprosper, they being shaded at all, or over-drip’d: The Swedish juniper\r\n(now so frequent in our new modish gardens, and shorn into pyramids) is\r\nbut a taller and somewhat brighter sort of the vulgar.\r\n\r\n3. I have rais’d them abundantly of their seeds (neither watering, nor\r\ndunging the soil) which in two months will peep, and being governed like\r\nthe cypress, apt for all the employments of that beautiful tree: To\r\nmake it grow tall, prune, and cleanse it to the very stem; the male\r\nbest. The discreet loosening of the earth about the roots also, makes it\r\nstrangely to prevent your expectations, by suddenly spreading into a\r\nbush fit for a thousand pretty employments; for coming to be much unlike\r\nthat which grows wild, and is subject to the treading and cropping of\r\ncattle, &c. it may be form’d into most beautiful and useful hedges: My\r\nlate brother having formerly cut out of one only tree, an arbour capable\r\nfor three to sit in, it was at my last measuring seven foot square, and\r\neleven in height; and would certainly have been of a much greater\r\naltitude, and farther spreading, had it not continually been kept shorn:\r\nBut what is most considerable, is, the little time since it was planted,\r\nbeing then hardly ten years, and then it was brought out of the common a\r\nslender bush, of about two foot high: But I have experimented a\r\nproportionable improvement in my own garden, where I do mingle them with\r\ncypress, and they would perfectly become their stations, where they\r\nmight enjoy the sun, and may very properly be set where cypress does not\r\nso well thrive; namely, in such gardens and courts as are open to the\r\neddy-winds, which indeed a little discolours our junipers when they blow\r\neasterly towards the Spring, but they constantly recover again; and\r\nbesides, the shrub is tonsile, and may be shorn into any form. I wonder\r\nVirgil should condemn its shadow. _Juniperi gravis umbra_..... I suspect\r\nhim mis-reported.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, botanists are not fully agreed to what species many\r\nnoble and stately trees, passing under the names of cedar, are to be\r\nreckon’d; and therefore (for I cannot but mention those of the Vermuda\r\nagain in this place) being so beautiful, tall, thick-set with\r\nevergreen-leaves, like the juniper, with berries indeed much larger, and\r\nmay also be propagated by layers: Affording a timber close, ruddy for\r\nthe most part; easy to work, and yielding excellent flooring, fit for\r\nwainscot, and all curious cabinet-works; keeping its agreeable odor and\r\nfragrancy longer than the rest: There is also made a pleasant and\r\nwholsome drink of the seeds, as they do of our common juniper; of which\r\nhereafter. Nearest the Bermuda juniper, comes the Virginia, both yet\r\nexceeded by that of Carolina, for the perfections already mention’d,\r\nspeaking of cedar, not forgetting the _Oxy-Cedrus_, which is reputed a\r\nsort of juniper: The berries so abounding on our uncultivated bushes,\r\nand barren heaths, always pregnant, annually ripen, tho’ not all at a\r\ntime; some sticking longer, so as there will be black, green, and gray,\r\nsucceeding one another.\r\n\r\n4. And these afford (besides a tolerable pepper) one of the most\r\nuniversal remedies in the world, to our crazy forester: the berries\r\nswallow’d only, instantly appease the wind-collic, and in decoction most\r\nsoveraign against an inveterate cough: They are of rare effect, being\r\nsteeped in beer; and in some northern countries, they use a decoction of\r\nthe berries, as we do coffee and tea. The water is a most singular\r\nspecifique against the gravel in the reins; but all is comprehended in\r\nthe virtue of the theriacle, or electuary, which I have often made for\r\nmy poor neighbours, and may well be term’d the forester’s _panacea_\r\nagainst the stone, rheum, pthysic, dropsie, jaundies, inward\r\nimposthumes; nay, palsie, gout, and plague it self, taken like\r\nVenice-treacle. Of the extracted oyl (with that of nuts) is made an\r\nexcellent good varnish for pictures, wood-work, and to preserve polish’d\r\niron from the rust. The gum is good to rub on parchment or paper, to\r\nmake it bear ink, and the coals, which are made of the wood, endure the\r\nlongest of any; so as live embers have been found after a year’s being\r\ncover’d in the ashes: See St. Hierom _ad Fabiolam_, upon that\r\nexpression, _Psal._ 120. v. 4. If it arrive to full growth, spits and\r\nspoons, imparting a grateful relish, and very wholesome, where they are\r\nus’d, are made of this wood, being well dried and season’d. And the very\r\nchips render a wholesome perfume within doors, as well as the dusty\r\nblossoms in Spring without, and excellent within to correct the air, and\r\nexpel infection; for which purpose the wood should be cut about May, and\r\nthe rasures well dried.\r\n\r\n5. And since we now mention pepper, it is by the most prudent and\r\nprincely care of his late Majesty, Char. II. that I am assur’d of a late\r\nsolemn Act of Council, enjoyning the preserving of that incomparable\r\nspice, which comes to us from Jamaica under that denomination; though in\r\ntruth it be a mixture of so many aromatics in one, that it might as well\r\nhave been call’d cinamon, nutmeg or mace, and all-spice, to every of\r\nwhich it seems something allied: And that there is not only prohibited\r\nthe destruction of these trees (for it seems some prodigals us’d to cut\r\nthem down, for the more easie gathering) but order taken likewise for\r\ntheir propagation, and that assays, and samples be from time to time\r\nsent over, what other fruits, trees, gums, and vegetables may there be\r\nfound, and which I prognostick will at last also incite the planters\r\nthere, to think of procuring cinamon, cloves, and nutmeg-trees indeed,\r\nfrom the East-Indies, and what other useful curiosities do not approach\r\nour northern Bear, (and that are yet incicurabiles amongst us) and to\r\nplant them in Jamaica, and other of the Western Islands, as a more safe\r\nand frugal expedient to humble our emulous neighbours; since there is\r\nnothing in their situation, or defect of nature’s benignity, which ought\r\nin the least to discourage us: And what if some of the trees of those\r\ncountries (especially such as aspire to be timber, and may be of\r\nimprovement amongst us) were more frequently brought to us likewise here\r\nin England; since we daily find how many rare exotics, and strangers,\r\nwith little care, become endenizon’d, and so contented to live amongst\r\nus, as may be seen in the _platanus_, Constantinople-chesnut, the\r\ngreater glandiferous _ilex_, cork, _nux vesicaria_ (which is an hard\r\nwood, fit for the turner, &c.) the _styrax_, bead-tree, the famous\r\n_lotus_, Virginian acacia, _guaiacum Patavinum_, _paliurus_, cypress,\r\npines, fir, and sundry others, which grow already in our gardens,\r\nexpos’d to the weather; and so doubtless would many more: So judiciously\r\nobserv’d is that of the learned author of the history of the Royal\r\nSociety, part. 3. sect. 28,\r\n\r\n     ‘That whatever attempts of this nature have succeeded, they have\r\n     redounded to the great advantage of the undertakers. The orange of\r\n     China being of late brought into Portugal, has drawn a great\r\n     revenue every year from London alone. The vine of the Rhene, taking\r\n     root in the Canaries, has produc’d a far more delicious juice, and\r\n     has made the rocks, and sun-burnt ashes of those islands, one of\r\n     the richest spots of ground in the world. And I will also instance\r\n     in that which is now in a good forwardness: Virginia has already\r\n     given silk for the cloathing of our King; and it may happen\r\n     hereafter, to give cloaths to a great part of Europe, and a vast\r\n     treasure to our Kings: If the silk-worms shall thrive there, (of\r\n     which there seems to be no doubt) the profit will be inexpressible.\r\n     We may guess at it, by considering what numbers of caravans, and\r\n     how many great cities in Persia, are maintain’d by that manufacture\r\n     alone, and what mighty customs it yearly brings unto the Sophi’s\r\n     revenue.’\r\n\r\nThus he: To which we might add; that not only the China-orange mention’d\r\nby the Doctor, but the whole race of orange-trees, were strangers in\r\nItaly, and unknown at Rome; nor grew they nearer than Persia, whence\r\nfirst they travell’d into Greece, as Athenaeus tells us. But to return\r\nto that of China, and give some account of its propagation in Europe:\r\nThe first was sent for a present to the old Conde Mellor, then Prime\r\nMinister to the King of Portugal: But of that whole case, (they came to\r\nLisbon in) there was but one only plant, which escap’d the being so\r\nspoil’d and tainted; that with great care it hardly recovered, to be\r\nsince become the parent and progenitor of all those flourishing trees of\r\nthat name, cultivated by our gardeners, tho’ not without sensibly\r\ndegenerating. Receiving this account from the illustrious son of the\r\nConde (successor in title and favour) upon his being recall’d (then an\r\nexile at our Court, where I had the honour to be known to him) I thought\r\nfit to mention it in this place, for an instance of what the industry we\r\nhave recommended, would questionless in less than half an age, produce\r\nof wonders, by introduction, if not of quite different, yet of better\r\nkinds, and such variety for pulchritude and sweetness; that when by some\r\nprincely example, our late pride, effeminacy, and luxury, (which has to\r\nour vast charges, excluded all the ornaments of timber, &c. to give\r\nplace to hangings, embroideries, and foreign leather) shall be put out\r\nof countenance, we may hope to see a new face of things, for the\r\nencouragement of planters (the more immediate work of God’s hands) and\r\nthe natural, wholesome, and ancient use of timber, for the more lasting\r\noccasions, and furniture of our dwellings: And though I do not speak all\r\nthis for the sake of joyn’d-stools, benches, cup-boards, massy tables,\r\nand gigantic bed-steads, (the hospitable utensils of our fore-fathers)\r\nyet I would be glad to encourage the carpenter, and the joyner, and\r\nrejoice to see, that their work and skill do daily improve; and that by\r\nthe example and application of his Majesty’s Universities, and Royal\r\nSociety, the restoration and improvement of shipping, mathematical, and\r\nmechanical arts, the use of timber grows daily in more reputation. And\r\nit were well if great persons might only be indulg’d to inrich, and\r\nadorn their palaces with tapestry, damask, velvet, and Persian\r\nfurniture; whilst by some wholesome sumptuary laws, the universal excess\r\nof those costly and luxurious moveables, were prohibited meaner men, for\r\ndivers politic considerations and reasons, which it were easie to\r\nproduce; but by a less influence than severer laws, it will be very\r\ndifficult, if not altogether impossible, to recover our selves from a\r\nsoftness and vanity, which will in time not only effeminate, but undo\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\n6. _Cupressus_, the cypress-tree is either the Sative, or garden-tree,\r\nthe most pyramidal and beautiful; or that which is call’d the male,\r\n(though somewhat preposterously) which bears the small cones, but is of\r\na more extravagant shape: Should we reason only from our common\r\nexperience, even the cypress-tree was, but within a few years past,\r\nreputed so tender, and nice a plant, that it was cultivated with the\r\ngreatest care, and to be found only amongst the curious; whereas we see\r\nit now, in every garden, rising to as goodly a bulk and stature, as most\r\nwhich you shall find even in Italy it self; for such I remember to have\r\nonce seen in his late Majesty’s gardens at Theobalds, before that\r\nprincely seat was demolish’d. I say, if we did argue from this topic,\r\nmethinks it should rather encourage our country-men to add yet to their\r\nplantations, other foreign and useful trees, and not in the least deter\r\nthem, because many of them are not as yet become endenizon’d amongst us:\r\nBut of this I have said enough, and yet cannot but still repeat it.\r\n\r\n7. We may read that the peach was at first accounted so tender, and\r\ndelicate a tree, as that it was believ’d to thrive only in Persia; and\r\neven in the days of Galen, it grew no nearer than Egypt, of all the\r\nRoman provinces, but was not seen in the city, till about thirty years\r\nbefore Pliny’s time; whereas, there is now hardly a more common, and\r\nuniversal in Europe: Thus likewise, the _Avellana_ from Pontus in Asia;\r\nthence into Greece, and so Italy, to the city of Abellino in Campania.\r\n\r\n    _Una tantùm litera immutata, Avellina dici, quæ prius Abellina._\r\n\r\nI might affirm the same of our Damasco plum, quince, medlar, fig, and\r\nmost ordinary pears, as well as of several other peregrine trees,\r\nfruit-bearers, and others; for even the very damask-rose it self, (as my\r\nLord Bacon tells us, Cent. 2. exp. 659.) is little more than an hundred\r\nyears old in England: Methinks this should be of wonderful incitement.\r\nIt was 680 years after the foundation of Rome, e’er Italy had tasted a\r\ncherry of their own, which being then brought thither{268:1} out of\r\nPontus (as the above-mention’d filberts were) did after 120 years,\r\ntravel _ad ultimos Britannos_.\r\n\r\n8. We had our first myrtils out of Greece, and cypress from Crete, which\r\nwas yet a meer stranger in Italy, as Pliny reports, and most difficult\r\nto be raised; which made Cato to write more concerning the culture of\r\nit, than of any other tree: Notwithstanding, we have in this country of\r\nours, no less than three sorts, which are all of them easily propagated,\r\nand prosper very well, if they are rightly ordered; and therefore I\r\nshall not omit to disclose one secret, as well to confute a popular\r\nerror, as for the instruction of our gardeners.\r\n\r\n9. The tradition is, that the cypress (being a symbol of mortality,\r\n_ferales & invisas_, they should say of the contrary) is never to be\r\ncut, for fear of killing it. This makes them to impale, and wind them\r\nabout, like so many Ægyptian mummies; by which means, the inward parts\r\nof the tree being heated, for want of air and refreshment, it never\r\narrives to any perfection, but is exceedingly troublesome, and\r\nchargeable to maintain; whereas indeed, there is not a more tonsile and\r\ngovernable plant in nature; for the cypress may be cut to the very\r\nroots, and yet spring afresh, as it does constantly in Candy, if not\r\nyielding suckers (as Bellonius affirms,) I rather think produced by the\r\nseeds, which the mother-trees shed at the motion of the stem in the\r\nfelling: And this we find was the husbandry in the Isle of Ænaria,\r\nwhere they us’d to fell it for copp’ce: For the cypress being rais’d\r\nfrom the nursery of seeds sown in September (or rather March,) and\r\nwithin two years after transplanted, should at two years standing more,\r\nhave the master-stem of the middle shaft cut off some hand-breadth below\r\nthe summit; the sides, and smaller sprigs shorn into a conique, or\r\npyramidal form, and so kept clipt from April to September, as oft as\r\nthere is occasion; and by this regiment, they will grow furnish’d to the\r\nfoot, and become the most beautiful trees in the world, without binding\r\nor stake; still remembring to abate the middle stem, and to bring up the\r\ncollateral branches in its stead, to what altitude you please; but when\r\nI speak of short’ning the middle shoot, I do not intend the dwarfing of\r\nit, and therefore it must be done discreetly, so as it may not\r\nover-hastily advance, till the foot thereof be perfectly furnished: But\r\nthere is likewise another, no less commendable expedient, to dress this\r\ntree with all the former advantages; if sparing the shaft altogether,\r\nyou diligently cut away all the forked branches, reserving only such as\r\nradiate directly from the body, which being shorn, and clipt in due\r\nseason, will render the tree very beautiful; and though more subject to\r\nobey the shaking winds, yet the natural spring of it, does immediately\r\nredress it, without the least discomposure; and this is a secret worth\r\nthe learning of gardeners, who subject themselves to the trouble of\r\nstakes and binding, which is very inconvenient. Thus likewise may you\r\nform them into hedges, topiary works, limits and boundary, _metas\r\nimitata cupressus_; or by sowing the seeds in a shallow furrow, and\r\nplucking up the supernumeraries, where they come too close and thick:\r\nFor in this work, it will suffice to leave them within a foot of each\r\nother; and when they are risen about a yard in height, (which may be to\r\nthe half of your palisado) cut off their tops, as you are taught, and\r\nkeep the sides clipp’d, that they ascend but by degrees, and thicken at\r\nthe bottom as they climb. Thus, they will present you (in half a dozen\r\nor eight years) with incomparable hedges; because they are perpetually\r\ngreen, able to resist the winds better than most which I know, the holly\r\nonly excepted, which indeed has no peer.\r\n\r\n10. For, when I say winds, I mean their fiercest gusts, not their cold:\r\nFor though it be said, _brumâque illæsa cupressus_, and that indeed no\r\nfrost impeaches them (for they grow even on the snowy tops of Ida,) yet\r\nour cruel eastern winds do sometimes mortally invade them which have\r\nbeen late clipp’d, seldom the untouch’d or that were dressed in the\r\nSpring only: The effects of March and April winds (in the Year 1663, and\r\n1665) accompanied with cruel frosts, and cold blasts, for the space of\r\nmore than two months, night and day, did not amongst near a thousand\r\ncypresses (growing in my garden) kill above three or four, which for\r\nbeing very late cut to the quick (that is, the latter end of October)\r\nwere raw of their wounds, took cold, and gangreen’d; some few others\r\nwhich were a little smitten towards the tops, might have escaped all\r\ntheir blemishes, had my gardener capp’d them but with a wisp of hay or\r\nstraw, as in my absence I commanded. As for the frost of those winters\r\n(than which I believe there was never known a more cruel and deadly\r\npiercing since England had a name) it did not touch a cypress of mine,\r\ntill it join’d forces with that destructive wind: Therefore for\r\ncaution, clip not your cypresses late in Autumn, and cloath them (if\r\nyoung) against these winds; for the frosts they only discolour them, but\r\nseldom, or never hurt them, as by long experience I have found; nor\r\naltogether despair of the resurrection of a cypress, subverted by the\r\nwind; for some have redress’d themselves; and one (as Ziphilinus\r\nmentions) that rose the very next day; which happening about the reign\r\nof the emperor Vespasian, was esteem’d an happy omen: But of such\r\naccidents, more hereafter.\r\n\r\n11. If you affect to see your cypress in standard, and grow wild, (which\r\nmay in time come to be of a large substance, fit for the most immortal\r\nof timber, and indeed are the least obnoxious to the rigours of our\r\nWinters, provided you never clip or disbranch them) plant of the reputed\r\nmale-sort; it is a tree which will prosper wonderfully; and where the\r\nground is hot and gravelly, though (as we said) he be nothing so\r\nbeautiful; and it is of this, that the Venetians make their greatest\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\n12. I have already shew’d how this tree is to be rais’d from the seed;\r\nbut there was another method amongst the Ancients, who (as I told you)\r\nwere wont to make great plantations of them for their timber; I have\r\npractis’d it my self, and therefore describe it.\r\n\r\n13. If you receive your seed in the roundish small nuts, which use to be\r\ngather’d thrice a year, (but seldom ripening with us) expose them to the\r\nsun till they gape, or near a gentle fire, or put them in warm water,\r\n(as was directed in those of cedar) by which means the seeds will be\r\neasily shaken out; for if you have them open before, they do not yield\r\nyou half their crop: About the beginning of April (or before, if the\r\nweather be showery) prepare an even bed, which being made of fine\r\nearth, clap down with your spade, as gardeners do for purselain seed (of\r\nold they roll’d it with some stone, or cylinder); upon this strew your\r\nseeds pretty thick; then sift over them some more mould, somewhat better\r\nthan half an inch in height: Keep them duly watered after sunset, unless\r\nthe season do it for you; and after one year’s growth, (for they will be\r\nan inch high in little more than two months) you may transplant them\r\nwhere you please: If in the nursery, set them at a foot or 18 inches\r\ndistance in even lines, kept watered and moist, ’till they are well\r\nrooted, and fit to be remov’d. In watering them, I give you this caution\r\n(which may also serve you for most tender and delicate seeds) that you\r\nbedew them rather with a broom, or spergitory, than hazard the beating\r\nthem out with the common watering-pot; and when they are well come up,\r\nbe but sparing of water: Be sure likewise that you cleanse them when the\r\nweeds are very young and tender, lest instead of purging, you quite\r\neradicate your cypress: We have spoken of watering, and indeed whilst\r\nyoung, if well follow’d, they will make a prodigious advance. When that\r\nlong and incomparable walk of cypress at Frascati near Rome, was first\r\nplanted, they drew a small stream (and indeed _irrigare_ is properly\r\nthus, _aquam inducere riguis_ (_i. e._) in small gutters and rills) by\r\nthe foot of it, (as the water there is in abundance tractable) and made\r\nit (as I was credibly inform’d) arrive to seven or eight foot height in\r\none year; (which does not agree with the epithet, _lenta cupressus_);\r\nbut with us, we may not be too prodigal; since, being once well taken,\r\nthey thrive best in our sandy, light and warmest grounds, whence Cardan\r\nsays, _juxta aquas arescit_; meaning in low and moorish places, stiff\r\nand cold earth, &c. where they never thrive.\r\n\r\nThere is also a Virginian cypress, of an enormous height, beautiful and\r\nvery spreading, the branches and leaves large and regular, with the\r\nclogs resembling the cypress; and though the timber be somewhat course\r\nand cross-grain’d, ’tis when polish’d, very agreeable; as I can shew in\r\na very large table, made out of the planks of a spurr only; and had\r\nexperience of its lastingness, tho’ expos’d both to the air and weather.\r\n\r\n14. What the uses of this timber are, for chests, and other utensils,\r\nharps, and divers other musical instruments (it being a very sonorous\r\nwood, and therefore employ’d for organ-pipes, as heretofore for\r\nsupporters of vines, poles, rails, and planks, (resisting the worm,\r\nmoth, and all putrefaction to eternity) the Venetians sufficiently\r\nunderstood; who did every twenty year, and oftner (the Romans every\r\nthirteen) make a considerable revenue of it out of Candy: And certainly,\r\na very gainful commodity it was, when the fell of a _cupressetum_, was\r\nheretofore reputed a good daughters portion, and the plantation it self\r\ncall’d _dos filiæ_. But there was in Candy a vast wood of these trees,\r\nbelonging to the Republique, by malice, or accident (or perhaps by solar\r\nheat, as were many woods 74 years after, even here in England) set on\r\nfire, which _anno_ 1400, burning for seven years continually, before it\r\ncould be quite extinguish’d, fed so long a space by the unctuous nature\r\nof the timber, of which there were to be seen at Venice planks of above\r\nfour foot in breadth; and formerly the valves of St. Peter’s church at\r\nRome, were fram’d of this material, which lasted from the great\r\nConstantine, to Pope Eugenius the Fourth’s time, eleven hundred years;\r\nand then were found as fresh, and entire as if they had been new: But\r\nthis Pope would needs change them for gates of brass, which were cast by\r\nthe famous Antonio Philarete; not in my opinion so venerable, as those\r\nof cypress. It was in coffins of this material, that Thucydides tells\r\nus, the Athenians us’d to bury their heroes, and the mummy-chests\r\nbrought with those condited bodies out of Egypt, are many of them of\r\nthis material, which ’tis probable may have lain in those dry, and sandy\r\n_crypta_, many thousand years.\r\n\r\n15. The timber of this wood was of infinite esteem with the Ancients:\r\nThat lasting bridge built over the Euphrates by Semiramis, was made of\r\nthis material; and it is reported, Plato chose it to write his laws in,\r\nbefore brass it self, for the diuturnity of the matter: It is certain,\r\nthat it never rifts or cleaves, but with great violence; and the\r\nbitterness of its juice, preserves it from all worms and putrifaction.\r\nTo this day those of Crete and Malta make use of it for their buildings;\r\nbecause they have it in plenty, and there is nothing out-lasts it, or\r\ncan be more beautiful, especially, than the root of the wilder sort,\r\nincomparable for its crisped undulations. Divers learned persons have\r\nconceiv’d the gopher mention’d in Holy Writ, _Gen._ 6. 14. (and of which\r\nthe Ark was built) to have been no other than this Κυπάρισσος,\r\n_cupar_, or _cuper_, by the easie mutation of letters; Aben Ezra names\r\nit a light wood apt to swim; so does David Kimchi; which rather seems to\r\nagree with fir or pine, and such as the Greeks call ξύλα τετράγωνα\r\nquadrangular trees, about which criticks have made a deal of stir: But\r\nIsa. Vossius (on the LXX. C. II.) has sufficiently made it out, that\r\nthe timber of that denomination was of those sort of trees whose\r\nbranches breaking out just opposite to one another at right angles, make\r\nit appear to have been fir, or some sort of wood whose arms grew in a\r\nuniform manner; but surely this is not to be universally taken; since we\r\nfind yew, and divers other trees, brittle, heavy, and unapt for\r\nshipping, do often put forth in that order: The same learned author will\r\nhave gopher to signifie only pitch, or bitumen, as much as if the text\r\nhad said, make an ark of resinous timber. The Chaldee paraphrase\r\ntranslates it cedar, or as Junius and Tremellius, _cedrelaten_, a\r\nspecies between fir and cedar: Munster contends for the pine, and divers\r\nable divines endeavour to prove it cypress; and besides, ’tis known,\r\nthat in Crete they employ’d it for the same use in the largest\r\ncontignations, and did formerly build ships of it: And Epiphanius Hæres,\r\nl. 1. tells us, some reliques of that ark (_circa campos sennaar_)\r\nlasted even to his days, and was judged to have been of cypress. Some\r\nindeed suppose that gopher was the name of a place, _à cupressis_, as\r\nElon _à quercubus_; and might possibly be that which Strabo calls\r\n_Cupressetum_, near Adiabene in Assyria: But for the reason of its long\r\nlasting, coffins (as noted) for the dead were made of it, and thence it\r\nfirst became to be _diti sacra_; and the valves, or doors of the\r\nEphesine temple were likewise of it, as we observ’d but now, were those\r\nof St. Peters at Rome: Works of cypress-wood, _permanent ad\r\ndiuturnitatem_, says Vitruvius l. 2. And the poet\r\n\r\n    .............._perpetuâ nunquam moritura cupresso._\r\n\r\n    Mart. E. 6. 6.\r\n\r\nThe medical virtues of this tree are for all affects of the nerves,\r\nastringent and refrigerating, for the hernia, apply’d outwardly, or\r\ntaken inwardly, for the dysentary, strangury, &c.\r\n\r\nBut to resume the disquisition, whether it be truly so proper for\r\nshipping, is controverted; though we also find in Cassiodorus _Var._ l.\r\n5. ep. 16, Theodoric (writing to the _Prætorio-præfectus_) caused store\r\nof it to be provided for that purpose; and Plato (who we told you made\r\nlaws, and titles to be engraven in it) nominates it, _inter arbores\r\nναυπηγοῖς utiles_ l. 4. leg. and so does Diodorus l. 19. And as\r\ntravellers observe, there is no other sort of timber more fit for\r\nshipping, {276:1} though others think it too heavy: Aristobulus affirms\r\nthat the Assyrians made all their vessels of it; and indeed the Romans\r\nprais’d it, pitch’d with Arabian pitch: And so frequent was this tree\r\nabout those parts of Assyria (where the Ark is conjectur’d to have been\r\nbuilt) that those vast Armada’s, which Alexander the Great caus’d to be\r\nequipp’d and set out from Babylon, consisted only of cypress, as we\r\nlearn out of Arrian in _Alex._ l. 7. and Strabo l. 16. Plutar. _Sympos._\r\nl. 1, _prob._ 2. Vegetius l. 14. c. 34, &c. Paulus Colomesius (in his\r\nκειμήλια _literaria_ cap. 24.) perstringes the most learned Is.\r\nVossius, that in his _vindiciae pro LXX. interp._ he affirms cypress not\r\nfit for ships, as being none of the τετράγωνοι: But besides what we\r\nhave produced, Fuller, Bochartus, &c. Lilius Gyraldus (_Lib. de navig._\r\nc. 4.) and divers others sufficiently evince it, and that the vessel\r\nbuilt by Trajan was of that material, lasting uncorrupt near 1400 years,\r\nwhen it was afterwards found in a certain lake; if it were not rather\r\n(as I suspect) that which Æneas Silvius reports to have been discovered\r\nin his time, lying under water in the Numidian Lake, crusted over with\r\na certain ferruginous mixture of earth and scales, as if it had been of\r\niron; but (as we have elsewhere noted) it was pronounced to be _larix_,\r\nand not cypress, employ’d by Tiberius: Finally (not to forget even the\r\nvery chips of this precious wood, which give that flavour to muscadines,\r\nand other rich wines) I commend it for the improvement of the air, and a\r\nspecific for the lungs, as sending forth most sweet, and aromatick\r\nemissions, whenever it is either clipp’d, or handled, and the chips or\r\ncones, being burnt, extinguish moths, and expels the gnats and flies,\r\n&c. not omitting the gum which it yields, not much inferior to the\r\nterebinthine or lentise.\r\n\r\nWe have often mention’d the virtue of these odoriferous woods, for the\r\nimprovement of the air; upon which I take occasion here to add, what I\r\nhave (some years since) already{277:1} publish’d, concerning the\r\nmelioration of it, in, and about this great and populous city,\r\naccidentally obnoxious to the effects of those nauseous vapours,\r\nexhaling from those many unclean places, and tainting that dismal cloud\r\nof sulphurous (if not arsenical) smoke, which we uncessantly breathe in.\r\nI know the late terrible conflagration, by the care and industry of the\r\nmagistrate, in causing so many kennels, sinks, gutters, lay-stalls and\r\nother nuisances (receptacles of a stagnant filth) to be removed, must\r\nneeds have exceedingly contributed to the purifying of the air; as I am\r\npersuaded would appear upon a political observation in the bills of\r\nmortality: But what I yet cannot but deplore, is, that, (when that\r\nspacious area, was so long a _rasa tabula_) the church-yards had not\r\nbeen banish’d to the North-walls of the city, where a grated inclosure\r\nof competent breadth (for a mile in length) might have served for an\r\nuniversal cœmetery, to all the parishes, distinguish’d by the like\r\nseparations, and with ample walks of trees; the walks adorn’d with\r\nmonuments, inscriptions and titles apt for contemplation and memory of\r\nthe defunct; and that wise, and ancient law of the XII Tables restor’d\r\nand reviv’d: But concerning this, and hortulan buryings upon this and\r\nother weighty reasons, see cap. I. book IV. Happy in the mean time, had\r\nit been for the further purgation of this august metropolis, had they\r\nthere, (or did they yet) banish and proscribe those hellish vulcanos,\r\ndisgorging from the brew-houses, sope and salt-boilers, chandlers,\r\nhat-makers, glass-houses, forges, lime-kilns, and other trades, using\r\nsuch quantities of sea-coals, one of whose funnels vomits more smoak\r\nthan all the culinary and chamber-fires of a whole parish, as I have\r\n(with no small indignation) observed, at what time they usually put out\r\ntheir fires, on Saturday evening, and re-kindle on Sunday night, or\r\nMonday morning; perniciously infecting the ambient air, with a black\r\nmelancholy canopy, to the detriment of the most valuable moveables and\r\nfurniture of the inhabitants, and the whole countrey about it. A bar of\r\niron shall be more exeded and consum’d with rust in one year in this\r\ncity, than in thrice-seven in the countrey: Why might it not therefore\r\nbe worth a severe and publick edict, to remove these vulcanos and\r\ninfernal houses of smoak to competent distance; some down the river,\r\nothers (which require conveniency of fresh-water) up the Thames, among\r\nthe streams about Wandsworth, &c? Their commodities and manufactures\r\nbrought up to capacious wharfs, on the bank, or London side, to the\r\nincrease of a thousand water-men and other labourers, of which we cannot\r\nhave too many?\r\n\r\nNow to demonstrate that not only the amoval of these unsufferable\r\nnuisances would infinitely clarifie the air, and render it more\r\nwholsome, and to return to my subject of trees and plants; the\r\nreputation they have had for contributing to the health of whole\r\ncountries and cities, frequently occur in history: For instance, in the\r\nisland of Cyprus, abounding with the trees of that name, and other\r\nresinous plants, curing ulcerated lungs, &c. Sardinia, melancholy and\r\nmadness, replanted with true Anticyran hellebore, was famous; whilst\r\nThusus (especially in Summer) brought almost all the inhabitants to\r\nlunacy and distraction for want of it. And what the effects and benefit\r\nof such plantations have produc’d, is conspicuous in one of the most\r\ncelebrated cities of the East, the famous Ispahan, clear’d of the\r\npestilence, since the surrounding it with that beautiful platan, as I\r\nhave already noted. To these add, the bay-tree, for abating all such\r\ninfections; of which see many famous instances in cap. vi. to which I\r\nrefer. Not that there are no nociferous trees, as well as saniferous,\r\nwhich by removing the one, and planting other in their places, make\r\nsensible changes for the better. I give instance, when we speak of the\r\nyew; and even that otherwise incomparably useful shrub, the elder.\r\n\r\nUpon what therefore has been produc’d of expedients for the melioration\r\nof the air by plantations of proper trees; I cannot but wish, that since\r\nthese precious materials may now be had at such tolerable rates (as\r\ncertainly they might from Cape-Florida, the Vermuda, or other parts of\r\nthe West-Indies); I say, I cannot but suggest that our more wealthy\r\ncitizens of London, every day building and embellishing their dwellings,\r\nmight be encourag’d to make use of it in their shops, at least for\r\nshelves, counters, chests, tables, and wainscot, &c. the fancerings (as\r\nthey term it) and mouldings; since beside the everlastingness of the\r\nwood, enemy to worms, and those other corruption we have named, it would\r\nlikewise greatly cure and reform the malignancy and corrosiveness of the\r\nair.\r\n\r\n_Sabin_, or, as we call it, savine, not for dignity to be nam’d with the\r\nformer; but for its being absolutely the best _Succedaneum_ to cypress,\r\n(which the rigour of our climat is not so benign to): If our gardners\r\ndid only increase and cultivate it for the other’s defects, and bring up\r\nnurseries of them for pyramids, and other tonsile and topiary works,\r\nthey would oftner use it instead of cypress: As to its other quality, it\r\nhas, indeed, an ill report, (as most other things have when not rightly\r\napply’d,) whilst there is nothing more efficacious for the destruction\r\nof worms in little children, the juice being given in a spoonful of\r\nmilk, dulcified with a little sugar, which brings them away in heaps; as\r\nit does in horses and other cattel above all other remedies.\r\n\r\nThere is another berry-bearing savine in warmer climats, which also\r\nresembles the cypress, commonly taken for the Tarrentine cypress, so\r\nmuch celebrated by Cato, which grew to noble standards: But that, and\r\nthe Melesian, worthy the culture, are rare with us, and indeed is as\r\nwell supply’d by the more hardy, as well as the Swedish juniper, and\r\nother shrubs. The sabine is easily propagated by slips and cuttings\r\nsooner than by the seeds, though sometimes found in the small squamous\r\nseed-cases.\r\n\r\n_Tamaric_, (growing to a considerable tree) for its aptness to be shorn\r\nand govern’d like the sabine and cypress, may be entertain’d, but not\r\nfor its lasting verdure, which forsakes it in Winter, but soon again\r\nrestores it. It was of old counted _infelix_, and under malediction, and\r\ntherefore used to wreath, and be put on the heads of malefactors: But it\r\nhas other excellent properties, in particular sovereign against the\r\nspleen, which as{281:1} Camden tells us was therefore brought first into\r\nEngland by Grindal Archbishop of Canterbury: They also made cans to\r\ndrink, out of this wood.\r\n\r\n_Thuya_; by some call’d _arbor vitae_, (brought us from Canada,) is an\r\nhardy green all the Winter, (though a little tarnish’d in very sharp\r\nweather) rais’d to a tree of moderate stature, bearing a ragged leaf,\r\nnot unlike the cypress, only somewhat flatter, and not so thick set and\r\nclose: It bears small longish clogs and seeds, but takes much better by\r\nlayers and slips, as those we have before mentioned, and may be kept\r\ninto the same shapes, but most delights in the shade, where the roots\r\nrunning shallow, the stem needs support: The leaf being bruised between\r\nthe fingers, emits a powerful scent not easily conquer’d, seeming to\r\nbreathe something of a sanative unguent, and (as I am told) makes one of\r\nthe best for the closure of green and fresh wounds: But that those\r\ncurious utensils and works of the turners, bowls, boxes, cups, mortars,\r\npestles, &c. are of this material (as is pretended) and pass under the\r\nname of _lignum vitae_, (or rather of some of the exotic, more close and\r\nponderous wood) as Brasile, log-wood, &c. is a mistake: Upon recension\r\ntherefore of these exotics, I cannot but encourage the more frequent\r\nraising the rest of those _semper-vivents_, especially such as are\r\nfittest for the shrubby parts, and furniture of our groves, mere gardens\r\nof pleasure, which none but the ever-green become. To these we might add\r\n(not for their verdure only) other more rare exotics, _styrax arbor_,\r\nand terebynth, noting by the way, that we have no true turpentine to be\r\nbought in our shops, but what is from the larch; whilst apothecaries\r\nsubstitute that which extills from the fir-tree, instead of it: All of\r\nthem minding me again of the great opportunities and encouragement we\r\nhave of every day improving our stores with so many useful trees from\r\nthe American plantations; for which I have the suffrage of the\r\noften-cited Mr. Ray, who is certainly a very able judge: Might we not\r\ntherefore attempt the more frequent locust, sassafras, &c. and that sort\r\nof elm, or sugar-tree, whose juice yields that sweet _halymus\r\nlatifolius_, and several others for encouragement? But\r\n\r\n14. I produce not these particulars, and other _amæna vireta_ already\r\nmentioned, as signifying any thing to timber, the main design of this\r\ntreatise, (tho’ I read of some myrtils so tall, as to make spear-shafts)\r\nbut to exemplifie in what may be farther added to ornament and pleasure,\r\nby a cheap and most agreeable industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n{255:1} Le Bruyn.\r\n\r\n{258:1} In Itin.\r\n\r\n{268:1} _A cerasunte_.

I begin\r\nwith the\r\n\r\n1. Cork, [_suber_] of which there are two sorts (and divers more in the\r\nIndies) one of a narrow, or less jagged leaf, and perennial; the other\r\nof a broader, falling in Winter; grows in the coldest parts of Biscay,\r\nin the north of New-England, in the south-West of France, especially the\r\nsecond species, fittest for our climate; and in all sorts of ground, dry\r\nheaths, stony and rocky mountains, so as the roots will run even above\r\nthe earth, where they have little to cover them; all which considered,\r\nmethinks we should not despair. We have said where they grow plentifully\r\nin France; but by Pliny, _Nat. Hist._ l. 16. c. 8. it should seem they\r\nwere since transplanted thither; for he affirms there were none either\r\nthere, or in Italy, in his time: But I exceedingly wonder that Carolus\r\nStephanus, and Cursius, should write so peremptorily, that there were\r\nnone in Italy; where I my self have travell’d through vast woods of them\r\nabout Pisa, Aquin, and in divers tracts between Rome, and the kingdom of\r\nNaples, and in France. The Spanish cork is a species of the _enzina_,\r\ndiffering chiefly in the leaf, which is not so prickly; and in the bark,\r\nwhich is frequently four or five inches thick: The manner of\r\ndecortication thereof is once in two or three years, to strip it in a\r\ndry season; otherwise, the intercutaneous moisture endangers the tree,\r\nand therefore a rainy season is very pernicious; when the bark is off,\r\nthey unwarp it before the fire, and press it even, and that with weights\r\nupon the convex part, and so it continues, being cold.\r\n\r\n2. The uses of cork is well known amongst us, both at sea and land, for\r\nits resisting both water and air: The fisher-men who deal in nets, and\r\nall who deal with liquors, cannot be without it: Ancient persons prefer\r\nit before leather for the soles of their shooes, being light, dry, and\r\nresisting moisture, whence the Germans name it _Pantoffel-holts_\r\n(slipper-wood) perhaps from the Greek Παντὸς & φέλλος; for I find\r\nit first applied to that purpose by the Grecian ladies, whence they were\r\ncall’d light-footed; I know not whether the epithet do still belong to\r\nthat sex; but from them it’s likely the Venetian dames took it up for\r\ntheir monstrous _choppines_; affecting, or usurping an artificial\r\neminency above men, which nature has denied them. Of one of the sorts of\r\ncork are made pretty cups, and other vessels, esteem’d good to drink out\r\nof for hectical persons: The Egyptians made their coffins of it, which\r\nbeing lin’d with a resinous composition, preserved their dead incorrupt:\r\nThe poor people in Spain, lay broad planks of it by their beds-side, to\r\ntread on (as great persons use Turky and Persian carpets) to defend them\r\nfrom the floor, and sometimes they line or wainscot the walls, and\r\ninside of their houses built of stone, with this bark, which renders\r\nthem very warm, and corrects the moisture of the air: Also they employ\r\nit for bee-hives, and to double the insides of their _contemplores_, and\r\nleather-cases, wherein they put flasquéra’s with snow to refrigerate\r\ntheir wine. This tree has beneath the _cortex_ or cork, two other coats,\r\nor _libri_, of which one is reddish, which they strip from the hole when\r\n’tis fell’d only; and this bears good price with the tanner; The rest of\r\nthe wood is very good firing, and applicable to many other uses of\r\nbuilding, palisade-work, &c. The ashes drunk, stop the bloody-flux.\r\n\r\n3. _Ilex_, _major glandifera_, or great scarlet-oak of several species,\r\nand various in the shape of their leaf, pointed rounder, longer, &c. (a\r\ndevoted tree of old, and therefore _incaedua_) thrives manifestly with\r\nus; witness His Majesty’s privy-garden at White-hall, where once\r\nflourish’d a goodly tree, of more than fourscore years growth, and there\r\nwas lately a sickly imp of it remaining: And now very many rais’d by me,\r\nhave thriv’d wonderfully, braving the most severe Winters, planted\r\neither in standards or hedges, which they most beautifully become. The\r\nonly difficulty is in their being dextrously removed out of the nursery,\r\nwith the mould adhering to the roots; otherwise apt to miscarry; and\r\ntherefore best trusting to the acorn for a goodly standard, and that may\r\nbe removed without prejudice, tryals should be made by graffing the\r\n_ilex_ in the oak-stock, taken out of our woods, or better, grown from\r\nthe acorn to the bigness of one’s little finger.\r\n\r\n4. By what I have touch’d in the chapter of the elms, concerning the\r\nperegrination of that tree into Spain, (where even in Pliny’s time there\r\nwere none, and where now they are in great abundance) why should we not\r\nmore generally endeavour to propagate the _ilex_ amongst us; I mean,\r\nthat which the Spaniards call the _enzina_, and of which they have such\r\nwoods, and profitable plantations? They are an hardy sort of tree, and\r\nfamiliarly rais’d from the acorn, if we could have them sound, and well\r\nput up in earth or sand, as I have found by experience.\r\n\r\n5. The wood of these _ilex’s_ is serviceable for many uses, as stocks of\r\ntools, mallet-heads, mall-balls, chairs, axletrees, wedges, beetles,\r\npins, and above all, for palisadoes us’d in fortifications. Besides, it\r\naffords so good fuel, that it supplies all Spain almost with the best,\r\nand most lasting of charcoals, in vast abundance. Of the first kind is\r\nmade the painter’s lac, extracted from the berries; to speak nothing of\r\nthat noble confection _alkermes_, and that noble scarlet-die the learned\r\nMr. Ray gives us the process of at large, in his chapter of the ilexes;\r\nwhere also of their medicinal uses: To this add that most accurate\r\ndescription of this tree, and the _vermicula_; see Quinqueranus, L. 2.\r\n_de laud. provid._ fol. 48. naturally abounding about Alos. The acorns\r\nof the _coccigera_, or dwarf-oak, yield excellent nourishment for\r\nrustics, sweet, and little if at all inferior to the chesnut; and this,\r\nand not the _fagus_, was doubtless the true _esculus_ of the Ancients,\r\nthe food of the Golden Age. The wood of the _enzina_ when old, is\r\ncuriously chambletted, and embroider’d with natural vermiculations, as\r\nif it were painted. Note, that the _kermes_ tree does not always produce\r\nthe _coccum_, but near the sea, and where it is very hot; nor indeed\r\nwhen once it comes to bear acorns; and therefore the people do often\r\nburn down the old trees, that they may put forth fresh branches, upon\r\nwhich they find them: This, (as well as the oak, cork, beech, and\r\n_corylus_) is numbred amongst the _felices_, and lucky-trees: But for\r\nwhat reason, the _alaternus_ (which I am next speaking of) together with\r\nthe _agrifolium_ [holly] pines, _salix_, &c. should be excommunicated,\r\nas _infelices_, I know not, unless for their being dedicated to the\r\nInfernal Deities; of which Macrob. _Sat. lib._ 12. cap. 16. In the mean\r\ntime, take this for a general rule; that those were call’d _infelices_\r\nonly, which bare no fruit; for so Livy, lib. 5. _nulla felix arbor,\r\nnihil frugiferum in agro relictum_. Whence that of Phædrus, l. 3. _Fab._\r\nupon Jupiter’s _esculus_:\r\n\r\n    _O nata, merito sapiens dicere omnibus\r\n    Nisi utile est quod facimus, stulta est gloria,_\r\n\r\nreciting the ancient trees sacred to the deity, the most desirable being\r\nthose that were fruitful, and for use.\r\n\r\n6. The _alaternus_, which we have lately receiv’d from the hottest parts\r\nof Languedoc, (and that is equal with the heat of almost any country in\r\nEurope) thrives with us in England, as if it were an indigine and\r\nnatural; yet sometimes yielding to a severe Winter, follow’d with a\r\ntedious eastern wind in the Spring, of all the most hostile and cruel\r\nenemies of our climate; and therefore to be artificially and timely\r\nprovided against with shelter.\r\n\r\n7. I have had the honour to be the first who brought it into use and\r\nreputation in the kingdom, for the most beautiful and useful of hedges\r\nand verdure in the world (the swiftness of the growth consider’d) and\r\npropagated it from Cornwall, even to Cumberland: The seed grows ripe\r\nwith us in August; and the honey-breathing blossoms afford an early and\r\nmarvellous relief to the bees.\r\n\r\n8. The _celastrus_ (of the same class) _ligustrum_ and privits, so\r\nflexible and accommodate for topiary-works, and so well known, I shall\r\nneed say no more of.\r\n\r\n9. The _philyrea_, (of which there are five or six sorts, and some\r\nvariegated) are sufficiently hardy, (especially the _serratifole_) which\r\nmakes me wonder to find the _angustifolia_ planted in cases, and so\r\ncharily set into the stoves, amongst the oranges and lemmons; when by\r\nlong experience, I have found it equalling our holley, in suffering the\r\nextreamest rigours of our cruel frosts and winds, which is doubtless (of\r\nall our English trees) the most insensible and stout.\r\n\r\n10. They are (both _alaternus_, and this) raised of the seeds, (though\r\nthose of the _philyrea_ will be long under ground) and being\r\ntransplanted for _espalier_ hedges, or standards, are to be governed by\r\nthe shears, as oft as there is occasion: The _alaternus_ will be up in a\r\nmonth or two after it is sown: I was wont to wash them out of the berry,\r\nand drying them a little in a cloath, commit them to the nursery-bed.\r\nPlant it out at two years growth, and clip it after rain in the Spring,\r\nbefore it grows sticky, and whilst the shoots are tender; thus will it\r\nform an hedge (though planted but in single rows, and at two foot\r\ndistance) of a yard in thickness, twenty foot high (if you desire it)\r\nand furnish’d to the bottom: but for an hedge of this altitude, it would\r\nrequire the friendship of some wall, or a frame of lusty poles, to\r\nsecure against the winds one of the most delicious objects in nature:\r\nBut if we could have store of the _philyrea folio leviter serrato_ (of\r\nwhich I have rais’d some very fine plants from the seeds) we might fear\r\nno weather, and the verdure is incomparable, and all of them tonsile,\r\nfit for cradle-work and _umbracula frondium_: a decoction of the\r\n_angustifolia_ soveraign for sore mouths.\r\n\r\n11. The myrtil. The vulgar Italian wild myrtil (though not indeed the\r\nmost fragrant) grows high, and supports all weathers and climates; they\r\nthrive abroad in Bretany, in places cold and very sharp in Winter; and\r\nare observ’d no where to prosper so well, as by the sea-coasts, the air\r\nof which is more propitious to them (as well as to oranges and lemmons,\r\n&c.) than the inland air. I know of one near eighty years old, which has\r\nbeen continually expos’d; unless it be, that in some exceeding sharp\r\nseasons, a little dry straw has been thrown upon it; and where they are\r\nsmitten, being cut down near the ground, they put forth and recover\r\nagain; which many times they do not in pots and cases, where the roots\r\nare very obnoxious to perish with mouldiness. The shelter of a few mats,\r\nand straw, secur’d very great trees (both leaf and colour in perfection)\r\nthis last Winter also, which were planted abroad; whilst those that were\r\ncarried into the conserve, were most of them lost. Myrtils (which are of\r\nsix or eight sorts) may be rais’d of seeds; as also may several\r\nvarieties of oranges and lemmons, and made (after some years attendance)\r\nto produce fruit in the cold Rhetia and Helvetick valleys; but with\r\ngreat caution, and after all, seldom prove worth the pains, being so\r\nabundantly multiplied of suckers, slips and layers: The double-flower\r\n(which is the most beautiful) was first discovered by the incomparable\r\nFabr. Piereshy, which a mule had cropt from a wild shrub. Note, that you\r\ncannot give those plants too much compost or refreshing, nor clip them\r\ntoo often, even to the stem; which will grow tall, and prosper into any\r\nshape; so as arbours have been made of single trees of the hardy kind,\r\nprotected in the Winter with sheads of straw and reeds. Both leaves and\r\nberries refrigerate, and are very astringent and drying, and therefore\r\nseldom us’d within, except in fluxes: With wine and honey it heals the\r\nnoisome _polypus_, and the powder corrects the rankness of the arm-pits,\r\nand _gousset_ (as the French term it) to which divers of the female sex\r\nare subject: The berries mitigate the inflammations of the eyes,\r\nconsolidate broken-bones; and a decoction of the juice, leaves, and\r\nberries, dyes the hair black, & _enecant vitiligenes_, as Dioscorides\r\nsays, l. 1. c. 128. And there is an excellent sweet water extracted from\r\nthe distill’d leaves and flowers: To which the naturalist adds, that\r\nthey us’d the berries instead of pepper, to stuff and farce with them.\r\nHence the _mortadella a mortatula_, still so call’d by the Italians,\r\nperhaps the μυρτίδες of Athenæus, _deip._ l. 2. c. 12. The _vinum\r\nmyrtites_ so celebrated by the{290:1} ancients, and so the oyl; And in\r\nsome places the leaves for tanning of leather: and trees have grown to\r\nsuch substance, as of the very wood curious cups and boxes have been\r\nturn’d.\r\n\r\nThe variety of this rare shrub, now furnishing the gardens and portico’s\r\n(as long as the season and weather suits) and even in the severest\r\nWinters in the conclave, are cut and contriv’d into various figures, and\r\nof divers variegations, most likely to be produc’d by the seeds, as our\r\nlearned Mr. Ray believes, rather than by layers, suckers, or slips, or\r\nfrom any difference of species: In the mean time, let gardeners make\r\nsuch trials, whilst those most worth the culture, are the small and\r\nbroad-leav’d, the Tarentine, the Belgick, _latifolia_, and\r\ndouble-flower’d, and several more among the curious; and of old, sacred\r\nto Venus, so call’d from a virgin belov’d of Minerva, the garlands of\r\nthe leaves and blossoms, impaling the brows of incruentous, and unbloody\r\nvictors and ovations.\r\n\r\nAnd now if here for the name only, I mention the _myrtus Brasantica_,\r\nor candle-berry shrub (which our plantations in Virginia, and other\r\nplaces have in plenty) let it be admitted: It bears a berry, which being\r\nboil’d in water, yields a suet or pinguid substance, of a green colour,\r\nwhich being scumm’d and taken off, they make candles with, in the shape\r\nof such as we use of tallow, or wax rather; giving not only a very clear\r\nand sufficient light, but a very agreeable scent, and are now not seldom\r\nbrought hither to us, but the tree it self, of which I have seen a\r\nthriving one.\r\n\r\n12. _Lentiscus_ (a very beautiful evergreen) refuses not our climate,\r\nprotected with a little shelter, amongst other exposed shrubs, by\r\nsuckers and layers: It is certainly an extraordinary astringent and\r\ndryer, applicable in the hernia, strangury, and to stop fluxes; closes\r\nand cures wounds, being infus’d in red-wine, is also us’d to tinge hairs\r\nof that colour, to black and brown. Not forgetting the best\r\ntooth-pickers in the world, made of the wood; but above all, the gum for\r\nfastning loose-teeth in the gums; the mastick, gather’d from this\r\nprofitable bush in the Island of Scio; beside other uses: And as the\r\nlentisc, so may the\r\n\r\n13. Olive be admitted, tho’ it produce no other fruit than the verdure\r\nof the leaf; nor will it kindly breath our air, nor the less tender\r\n_oleaster_, without the indulgent winter-house take them in. But the\r\n\r\n14. _Granata_ [_malus punica_] is nothing so nice. There are of this\r\nglorious shrub three sorts, easily enough educated under any warm\r\nshelter, even to the raising hedges of them, nor indeed affects it so\r\nmuch heat, as plentiful watering: They supported a very severe winter in\r\nmy garden, 1663, without any trouble or artifice; and if they present\r\nus their blushing double flowers for the pains of recision and well\r\npruning, (for they must diligently be purg’d of superfluous wood) it is\r\nrecompence enough; tho’ placed in a very benign aspect, they have\r\nsometimes produc’d a pretty small pome: It is a _perdifolia_ in Winter,\r\nand growing abroad, requires no extraordinary rich earth, but that the\r\nmould be loosen’d and eas’d about the root, and hearty compost applied\r\nin Spring and Autumn: Thus cultivated, it will rise to a pretty tree,\r\ntho’ of which there is in nature none so adulterate a shrub: ’Tis best\r\nincreas’d by layers, approch and inarching (as they term it) and is said\r\nto marry with laurels, the damson, ash, almond, mulberry, citron, too\r\nmany I fear to hold. But after all, they do best being cas’d, the mould\r\nwell mixt with rotten hogs-dung, its peculiar delight, and kept to a\r\nsingle stem, and treated like other plants in the Winter-shelter; they\r\nopen the bud and flower, and sometimes with a pretty small fruit; the\r\njuice whereof is cooling; the rest of an astringent quality: The rind\r\nmay also supply the gall for making ink, and will tan leather.\r\n\r\n15. The syring [lilac] or pipe-tree, so easily propagated by suckers or\r\nlayers; the flower of the white (emulating both colour and flavor of the\r\norange) I am told is made use of by the perfumers; I should not else\r\nhave named it among the evergreens; for it loses the leaf, tho’ not its\r\nlife, however expos’d in the Winter: There are besides this the purple,\r\nby our botanists call’d the Persian julsamine, which next leads me to\r\nthe other jasmines.\r\n\r\n16. The jasmine, especially the Spanish larger flower, far exceeding all\r\nthe rest, for the agreeable odor and use of the perfumer: The common\r\nwhite and yellow would flower plentifully in our groves, and climb about\r\nthe trees, being as hardy as any of our _periclimena_ and honey-suckles.\r\n\r\nHow ’tis increas’d by submersion and layers, every gardner skills; and\r\nwere it as much employ’d for nose-gays, &c. with us, as it is in Italy\r\nand France, they might make money enough of the flowers; one sorry tree\r\nin Paris, where they abound, has been worth a poor woman near a _pistol_\r\na year.\r\n\r\nThere is no small curiosity and address in obtaining the oyl, or essence\r\n(as we call it) of this delicate and evanid flower, which I leave to the\r\nchymist and the ladies who are worthy the secrets.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n{290:1} Cato, Columella, Paladius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n_Of the Arbutus, Box, Yew, Holly, Pyracanth, Laurel, Bay, &c._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The _arbutus_, (by us call’d the strawberry-tree) too much I think\r\nneglected by us; making that a rarity, which grows so common and\r\nnaturally in Ireland: It is indeed with some difficulty raised by seeds,\r\nbut propagated by layers, if skilfully prun’d, grows to a goodly tree,\r\npatient of our clime, unless the weather be very severe: It may be\r\ncontriv’d into most beautiful palisades, is ever verdant: I am told the\r\ntree grows to a huge bulk and height in Mount Athos and other countries:\r\nVirgil reports its inoculation with the nut; and I find Bauhinus\r\ncommends the coal for the goldsmiths works; and the poet\r\n\r\n    Arbutean harrows, and the mystick van.{294:1}\r\n\r\n2. _Buxus_, the box, which we begin to proscribe our gardens (and indeed\r\nbees are no friend to it) should not yet be banish’d from our care;\r\nbecause the excellency of the wood does commute for the unagreeableness\r\nof its smell: Therefore let us furnish our cold and barren hills and\r\ndeclivities with this useful shrub, I mean the taller sort; for dwarf\r\nand more tonsile in due place; it will increase abundantly of slips set\r\nin March, and towards Bartholomew-tide, as also of the seeds contain’d\r\nin the cells: These trees rise naturally at Boxley in Kent in abundance,\r\nand in the county of Surrey, giving name to that Chalky Hill (near the\r\nfamous Mole or Swallow) whither the ladies, gentlemen and other\r\nwater-drinkers from the neighbouring Ebesham-Spaw, often resort during\r\nthe heat of Summer to walk, collation and divert themselves in those\r\n_antilex_ natural alleys, and shady recesses, among the box-trees;\r\nwithout taking any such offence at the smell, which has of late banish’d\r\nit from our groves and gardens; when after all, it is infinitely to be\r\npreferr’d for the bordering of flower-beds, and flat embroideries, to\r\nany sweeter les-lasting shrub whatever, subject after a year or two to\r\ngrow dry, sticky and full of gaps; which box is so little obnoxious to,\r\nthat, braving all seasons, it needs not to be renew’d for 20 years\r\ntogether, nor kept in order with the garden-sheers, above once or twice\r\na year, and immediately upon that, the casting water on it, hinders all\r\nthose offensive emissions, which some complain of: But whilst I speak in\r\nfavour of this sort of edging, I only recommend the use of the\r\nDutch-box, (rarely found growing in England) which is a _pumil_ dwarf\r\nkind, with a smaller leaf, and slow of growth, and which needs not be\r\nkept above two inches high, and yet grows so close, that beds bordered\r\nwith boards, keep not the earth in better order; beside the pleasantness\r\nof the verdure is incomparable.\r\n\r\nOne thing more I think fit to add; That it may be convenient once in\r\nfour, or five, or six years, to cut off the strings and roots which\r\nstraggle into the borders, with a very sharp spade, that they may not\r\nprejudice the flowers, and what else one plants in them.\r\n\r\nI need not speak much of the uses of this tree, (growing in time to\r\nconsiderable stature) so continually sought after for many utensils,\r\nbeing so hard, close and pondrous as to sink like lead in water, and\r\ntherefore of special use for the turner, ingraver, carver,\r\nmathematical-instrument, comb and pipe-makers (_si buxos inflare\r\njuvat_...... Virg.) give great prices for it by weight, as well as\r\nmeasure; and by the seasoning, and divers manner of cutting, vigorous\r\ninsolations, politure and grinding, the roots of this tree (as of even\r\nour common and neglected thorn) do furnish the inlayer and\r\ncabinet-makers with pieces rarely undulated, and full of variety. Also\r\nof box are made wheels or shivers (as our ship-carpenters call them) and\r\npins for blocks and pullies; pegs for musical instruments; nut-crackers,\r\nweavers-shuttles, hollar-sticks, bump-sticks, and dressers for the\r\nshooe-maker, rulers, rolling-pins, pestles, mall-balls, beetles, topps,\r\ntables, chess-men, screws, male and female, bobins for bone-lace,\r\nspoons, nay the stoutest axle-trees, but above all,\r\n\r\n    ........Box-combs bear no small part\r\n    In the militia of the female-art;\r\n    They tye the links which hold our gallants fast,\r\n    And spread the nets to which fond lovers hast.{296:1}\r\n\r\n3. The chymical oyl of this wood has done the feats of the best\r\n_guajacum_ (though in greater quantity) for the cure of venereal\r\ndiseases, as one of the most expert physicians in Europe has confess’d.\r\nThe oyl asswages the tooth-ache. But, says Rhodoginus, the honey which\r\nis made at Trevisond in box-trees, (I suppose he means gather’d among\r\nthem; for there are few, I believe, if any, so large and hollow as to\r\nlodge and hive them) renders them distracted who eat of it. Lib. XXIII.\r\ncap. 25.\r\n\r\nV. Since the use of bows is laid aside amongst us, the propagation of\r\nthe yew-tree (of which we have two sorts, and other places reckon more,\r\nas the Arcadian black and red; the yellow of Ida, infinitely esteem’d of\r\nold) is likewise quite forborn; but the neglect of it is to be deplor’d;\r\nseeing that (besides the rarity of it in Italy and France, where but\r\nlittle of it grows) the barrenest grounds, and coldest of our mountains\r\n(for\r\n\r\n    ........._Aquilonem & frigora taxi_)\r\n\r\nmight be profitably replenish’d with them: I say, profitably, for,\r\nbesides the use of the wood for bows\r\n\r\n    ........._Ityraeos taxi torquentur in arcus._\r\n\r\n(For which the close and more deeply dy’d is best) the forementioned\r\nartists in box, cabinet-makers, inlayers, and for the parquetè-floors,\r\nmost gladly employ it; and in Germany they use to wainscot their stoves\r\nwith boards of this material: Also for the cogs of mills, posts to be\r\nset in moist grounds, and everlasting axel-trees, there is none to be\r\ncompared with it; likewise for the bodies of lutes, theorbo’s, bowles,\r\nwheels, and pins for pullies; yea, and for tankards to drink out of;\r\nwhatever Pliny reports concerning its shade, and the stories of the air\r\nabout Thasius, the fate of Cativulcus mention’d by Cæsar, and the ill\r\nreport which the fruit has vulgarly obtain’d in France, Spain, and\r\nArcadia: But\r\n\r\n    How are poor trees traduc’d?{297:1}\r\n\r\n5. The toxic quality was certainly in the liquor, which those good\r\nfellows tippl’d out of those bottles, not in the nature of the wood;\r\nwhich yet he affirms is cur’d of that venenous quality, by driving a\r\nbrazen-wedge into the body of it: This I have never tried, but that of\r\nthe shade and fruit I have frequently, without any deadly or noxious\r\neffects: So that I am of opinion, that tree which Sestius calls\r\n_smilax_, and our historian thinks to be our yew, was some other wood;\r\nand yet I acknowledge that it is esteem’d noxious to cattle when ’tis in\r\nthe seeds, or newly sprouting; though I marvel there appear no more such\r\neffects of it, both horses and other cattle being free to brouse on it,\r\nwhere it naturally grows: But what is very odd (if true) is that which\r\nthe late Mr. Aubrey recounts (in his _Miscellanies_) of a gentlewoman\r\nthat had long been ill, without any benefit from the physician; who\r\ndream’d, that a friend of hers deceased, told her mother, that if she\r\ngave her daughter a drink of yew pounded, she should recover: She\r\naccordingly gave it her, and she presently died: The mother being almost\r\ndistracted for the loss of her daughter, her chambermaid, to comfort\r\nher, said, surely what she gave her was not the occasion of her death,\r\nand that she would adventure on it her self; she did so, and died also:\r\nWhether all this be but a dream, I cannot tell, but it was haply from\r\nthese lugubrous effects, that garlands of _taxus_ were usually carried\r\nat funerals, as Statius implies in _Epicedium vernae_: However, to\r\nprevent all funest accidents, I commend the tree only for the usefulness\r\nof the timber, and hortulan ornament. That we find it so universally\r\nplanted in our church-yards, was doubtless some symbol of immortality,\r\nthe tree being so lasting, and always green: Our bee-masters banish it\r\nfrom about their apiaries.\r\n\r\nOne thing more, whilst I am speaking of this tree; it minds me of that\r\nvery odd story I find related by Mr. Camden, of a certain amorous\r\nclergy-man, that falling in love with a pretty maid who refus’d his\r\naddresses, cut off her head; which being hung upon a yew-tree ’till it\r\nwas rotten, the tree was reputed so sacred, not only whilst the virgin’s\r\nhead hung on it, but as long as the tree it self lasted; to which the\r\npeople went in pilgrimage, plucking and bearing away branches of it, as\r\nan holy relique, whilst there remain’d any of the trunk left, persuading\r\nthemselves, that those small veins and filaments, (resembling hairs\r\nbetween the bark and the body of the tree) were the hairs of the virgin:\r\nBut what is yet stranger, that the resort to this place (then call’d\r\nHouton) (from a despicable village) occasion’d the building of the now\r\nfamous town Hallifax, in York-shire, which imports holy-hair: By this,\r\nand the like, may we estimate what a world of impostures, have through\r\ncraft and superstition gained the repute of holy-places, abounding with\r\nrich oblations (their _de voto’s_).\r\n\r\nPliny speaks of an old lotus tree in a grove near Rome, which they\r\ncall’d _capitale_, upon which the vestals present (as our nuns) were\r\nus’d to hang their hair cut off at their profession: Plin. lib. 16. c.\r\n43. But that is nothing to this.\r\n\r\nI may not in the mean time omit what has been said of the true _taxus_\r\nof the ancients, for being a mortiferous plant: Dr. Belluccio, President\r\nof the Medical Garden at Pisa in Tuscany, (where they have this\r\ncuriosity) affirms, that when his gardners clip it (as sometimes they\r\ndo) they are not able to work above half an hour at a time, it makes\r\ntheir heads so ake: But the leaves of this tree are more like the fir,\r\nand is very bushy, furnish’d with leaves from the very root, and seeming\r\nrather an hedge than a tree, tho’ it grow very tall.\r\n\r\n6. This English yew-tree is easily produc’d of the seeds, wash’d and\r\ncleans’d from their mucilage, then buried and dry’d in sand a little\r\nmoist, any time in December, and so kept in some vessel in the house all\r\nWinter, and in some cool shady place abroad all the Summer, sow them the\r\nSpring after: Some bury them in the ground like haws; it will commonly\r\nbe the second Winter e’re they peep, and then they rise with their caps\r\non their heads: Being three years old, you may transplant them, and form\r\nthem into standards, knobs, walks, hedges, &c. in all which works they\r\nsucceed marvellous well, and are worth our patience for their perennial\r\nverdure and durableness: I do again name them for hedges, preferable\r\nfor beauty, and a stiff defence to any plant I have ever seen, and may\r\nupon that account (without vanity) be said to have been the first which\r\nbrought it into fashion, as well for defence, as for a _succedaneum_ to\r\ncypress, whether in hedges, or pyramids, conic-spires, bowls or what\r\nother shapes, adorning the parks or larger avenues, with their lofty\r\ntops 30 foot high, and braving all the efforts of the most rigid Winter,\r\nwhich cypress cannot weather; I have said how long lasting they are, and\r\neasily to be shap’d and clipp’d; nay cut down, revive: But those which\r\nare much superannuated, and perhaps of many hundred years standing,\r\nperish if so us’d.\r\n\r\n7. He that in Winter should behold some of our highest hills in Surrey,\r\nclad with whole woods of these two last sort of trees, for divers miles\r\nin circuit (as in those delicious groves of them, belonging to the\r\nHonourable, my noble friend, the late Sir Adam Brown of\r\nBech-worth-Castle, from Box-hill) might without the least violence to\r\nhis imagination, easily fancy himself transported into some new or\r\nenchanted country; for, if any spot of England,\r\n\r\n                 ........’Tis here\r\n    Eternal Spring, and Summer all the year.{300:1}\r\n\r\nOf which I have already spoken in the former section.\r\n\r\n8. But, above all the natural greens which inrich our home-born store,\r\nthere is none certainly to be compar’d to the _agrifolium_, (or\r\n_acuifolium_ rather) our holly so spontaneously growing here in this\r\npart of Surrey, that the large vale near my own dwelling, was anciently\r\ncall’d Holmes-Dale; famous for the flight of the Danes: The inhabitants\r\nof great antiquity (in their manners, habits, speech) have a proverb,\r\nHolmes-Dale never won; he never shall. It had once a fort, call’d\r\nHomes-Dale Castle: I know not whether it might not be that of Rygate;\r\nbut leaving this uncertain, and return to the plant, I have often\r\nwonder’d at our curiosity after foreign plants, and expensive\r\ndifficulties, to the neglect of the culture of this vulgar, but\r\nincomparable tree; whether we will propagate it for use and defence, or\r\nfor sight and ornament.\r\n\r\n    A hedge of holly, thieves that would invade,\r\n    Repulses like a growing palizade;\r\n    Whose numerous leaves such orient greens invest,\r\n    As in deep Winter do the Spring arrest.{301:1}\r\n\r\nWhich makes me wonder why it should be reckon’d among the unfortunate\r\ntrees, by Macrobius, _Sat._ lib. III. cap. 20. others among the lucky;\r\nfor so it seems they us’d to send branches of it, as well as of oak (the\r\nmost fortunate, according to the Gentile theology) with their _strenae_\r\n(new-year’s gifts) begun (as Symachus tells us) by K. Tatius, almost as\r\nold as Rome her self.\r\n\r\nBut to say no more of these superstitious fopperies, which are many\r\nother about this tree, we still dress up both our churches and houses,\r\non Christmas and other festival days, with this cheerful green and\r\nrutilant berries.\r\n\r\n9. Is there under heaven a more glorious and refreshing object of the\r\nkind, than an impregnable hedge of about four hundred foot in length,\r\nnine foot high, and five in diameter; which I can shew in my now ruin’d\r\ngardens at Say’s-Court, (thanks to the Czar of Moscovy) at any time of\r\nthe year, glitt’ring with its arm’d and varnish’d leaves? The taller\r\nstandards at orderly distances, blushing with their natural coral: It\r\nmocks at the rudest assaults of the weather, beasts, or hedge-breakers,\r\n\r\n    _Et illum nemo impunè lacessit._\r\n\r\nIt is with us of two eminent kinds, the prickly, and smoother leav’d; or\r\nas some term it, the free-holly, not unwelcome when tender, to sheep and\r\nother cattle: There is also of the white-berried, and a golden and\r\nsilver, variegated in six or seven differences; which proceeds from no\r\ndifference in the species, but accidentally, and _naturae lusu_, as most\r\nsuch variegations do; since we are taught how to effect it artificially,\r\nnamely, by sowing the seeds, and planting in gravelly soil, mixed with\r\nstore of chalk, and pressing it hard down; it being certain, that they\r\nreturn to their native colour when sown in richer mould, and that all\r\nthe fibers of the roots recover their natural food.\r\n\r\n10. I have already shew’d how it is to be rais’d of the berries, (of\r\nwhich there is a sort bears them yellow, and propagate their colour)\r\nwhen they are ready to drop, this only omitted, that they would first be\r\nfreed from their tenacious and glutinous mucilage by being wash’d, and a\r\nlittle bruised, then dry’d with a cloath; or else bury them as you do\r\nthe yew and hipps; and let our forester receive this for no common\r\nsecret, and take notice of the effect: If you will sow them in the\r\nberry, keep them in dry sand till March; remove them also after three or\r\nfour years; but if you plant the sets (which is likewise a commendable\r\nway, and the woods will furnish enough) place’em northwards, as they do\r\nquick. Of this, might there living pales and enclosures be made, (such\r\nas the Right Honourable my Lord Dacres, somewhere in Sussex, has a park\r\nalmost environ’d with, able to keep in any game, as I am credibly\r\ninform’d) and cut into square hedges, it becomes impenetrable, and will\r\nthrive in hottest, as well as the coldest places. I have seen hedges, or\r\nif you will, stout walls of holly, 20 foot in height, kept upright, and\r\nthe gilded sort budded low, and in 2 or 3 places one above another,\r\nshorn and fashion’d into columns and pilasters, architectonially shap’d,\r\nand at due distance; than which nothing can possibly be more pleasant,\r\nthe berry adorning the intercolumniations, with the scarlet festoons and\r\n_encarpa_. Of this noble tree one may take thousands of them four inches\r\nlong, out of the woods (amongst the fall’n leaves whereof, they sow\r\nthemselves) and so plant them; but this should be before the cattle\r\nbegin to crop them, especially sheep, who are greedy of them when\r\ntender: Stick them into the ground in a moist season, Spring, or early\r\nAutumn; especially the Spring, shaded (if it prove too hot and\r\nscorching) till they begin to shoot of themselves, and in very sharp\r\nweather, and during our eastern _etesians_, cover’d with dry straw or\r\nhaume; and if any of them seem to perish, cut it close, and you shall\r\nsoon see it revive. Of these seedlings, and by this culture, I have\r\nrais’d plants and hedges full four foot high in four years: The lustier\r\nand bigger the sets are, the better, and if you can procure such as are\r\na thumbs-breadth thick, they will soon furnish into an hedge. At\r\nDengeness in Kent, they grow naturally amongst the very beach and\r\npibbles; but if your ground be stiff, loosen it with a little fine\r\ngravel: This rare hedge (the boast of my villa) was planted upon a\r\nburning gravel, expos’d to the meridian sun; for it refuses not almost\r\nany sort of barren ground, hot or cold, and often indicates where coals\r\nare to be dug.\r\n\r\n11. True it is, that time must bring this tree to perfection; it does so\r\nto all things else, & _posteritati pangimus_. But what if a little\r\nculture about the roots (not dunging, which it abhors) and frequent\r\nstirring of the mould, double its growth? We stay seven years for a\r\ntolerable quick, it is worth staying it thrice, for this, which has no\r\ncompetitor.\r\n\r\n12. And yet there is an expedient to effect it more insensibly, by\r\nplanting it with the quick: Let every fifth or sixth be an holly-set;\r\nthey will grow up infallibly with your quick; and as they begin to\r\nspread, make way for them by extirpating the white-thorn, till they\r\nquite domineer: Thus was my hedge first planted, without the least\r\ninterruption to the fence, by a most pleasant metamorphosis. But there\r\nis also another, not less applauded, by laying along well-rooted sets (a\r\nyard or more in length) and stripping off the leaves and branches,\r\nletting only something of the tops appear: These, cover’d with a\r\ncompetent depth of earth, will send forth innumerable suckers, which\r\nwill suddenly advance into an hedge; and grows as well under the shade\r\nas sun, provided you keep them weeded, and now and then loosen the\r\nearth; towards which, if thro’ extream neglect, or other accident, it\r\ngrow thin, being close cut down, it will fill and become stronger and\r\nthicker than ever.\r\n\r\nOf this stately shrub (as some reckon it) there is lately found an\r\nholly, whose leaves are as thorny and bristly, not only at the edges,\r\nbut all over, as an hedge-hog, which it may properly be call’d; and I\r\nthink was first brought by Mr. London out of France.\r\n\r\n13. The timber of the holly (besides that it is the whitest of all hard\r\nwoods, and therefore us’d by the inlayer, especially under thin plates\r\nof ivory, to render it more conspicuous) is for all sturdy uses; the\r\nmill-wright, turner and engraver, prefer it to any other: It makes the\r\nbest handles and stocks for tools, flails, riding rods the best, and\r\ncarters-whips; bowles, shivers, and pins for blocks: Also it excels for\r\ndoor-bars and bolts; and as of the elm, so of this especially, they made\r\neven hinges and hooks to serve instead of iron, sinking in the water\r\nlike it; and of the bark is compos’d our bird-lime thus:\r\n\r\n14. Pill a good quantity of the bark about Midsummer, fill a vessel with\r\nit, and put to it spring-water; then boil it, till the gray and white\r\nbark rise from the green, which will require near twelve hours boiling;\r\nthen taking it off the fire, separate the barks, the water first well\r\ndrained from it: Then lay the green bark on the earth, in some cool\r\nvault or cellar, covering it with any sort of green and rank weeds, such\r\nas dock, thistles, hemlock, &c. to a good thickness: Thus let it\r\ncontinue near a fortnight, by which time ’twill become a perfect\r\nmucilage: Then pound it all exceedingly in a stone mortar, ’till it be a\r\ntough past, and so very fine, as no part of the bark be discernable:\r\nThis done, wash it accurately well in some running stream of water, as\r\nlong as you perceive the least ordure or motes in it, and so reserve it\r\nin some earthen-pot, to purge and ferment, scumming it as often as any\r\nthing arises for four or five days, and when no more filth comes, change\r\nit into a fresh vessel of earth, and reserve it for use, thus: Take what\r\nquantity you please of it, and in an earthen pipkin, add a third part of\r\ncapons or goose-grease to it, well clarified; or oyl of walnuts, which\r\nis better: Incorporate these on a gentle fire, continually stirring it\r\n’till it be cold, and thus your composition is finish’d. But to prevent\r\nfrosts (which in severe weather will sometimes invade it on the rods)\r\ntake a quarter of as much oyl of petroleum, as you do of grease, and no\r\ncold whatever will congeal it. The Italians make their _vischio_ of the\r\nberries of the misselto of trees, (and indeed it is from this it is said\r\nof the thrush, _exitium suum cacat_, that bird being so exceeding\r\ndevourers of them) treated much after the same manner; but then they mix\r\nit with nut-oyl, an ounce to a pound of lime, and taking it from the\r\nfire, add half an ounce of turpentine, which qualifies it also for the\r\nwater. Great quantities of bird-lime are brought to us out of Turky, and\r\nfrom Damascus, which some conceive to be made of _sebestens_, finding\r\nsometimes the kernels: This lime is of a greener colour, subject to\r\nfrosts, and impatient of wet, nor will last above a year or two good:\r\nAnother sort comes also out of Syria, of a yellow hue; likewise from\r\nSpain, whiter than the rest, which will resist the water, but is of an\r\nill scent. I have been told that the _cortex_ of our _lantana_, or\r\nwayfaring shrub, will make as good bird-lime as the best. But let these\r\nsuffice, being more than as yet any one has publish’d. The superior\r\nleaves of holly-trees, dry’d to a fine powder, and drunk in white-wine,\r\nare prevalent against the stone, and cure fluxes; and a dozen of the\r\nmature berries, being swallow’d, purge phlegm without danger. To which\r\nthe learned Mr. Ray (in _Append. Plant. Angl._) adds a _zythogalum_, or\r\nposset made of milk and beer, in which is boil’d some of the most\r\npointed leaves, for asswaging the torment of the collic, when nothing\r\nelse has prevailed. And now I might have here planted the\r\n\r\n15. _Pyracantha_, both for its perpetual verdure, if the fences had not\r\nalready challeng’d it, chap. 20. lib. I.\r\n\r\n16. The _lauro-cerasus_ on cherry-bay, which by the use we commonly put\r\nit to, seems as if it had been only destin’d for hedges, and to cover\r\nbare walls: Being planted upright, and kept to the standard, by cutting\r\naway the collateral branches, and maintaining one stem, will rise to a\r\nvery considerable tree; and (for the first twenty years) resembling the\r\nmost beautiful-headed orange, in shape and verdure, arrive in time to\r\nemulate even some of our lusty timber-trees; so as I dare pronounce the\r\nlaurel to be one of the most proper and ornamental trees for walks and\r\navenues, of any growing.\r\n\r\n17. Pity it is they are so abus’d in the hedges, where the lower\r\nbranches growing sticky and dry, by reason of their frequent and\r\nunseasonable cutting (with the genius of the tree, which is to spend\r\nmuch in wood) they never succeed, after the first six or seven years;\r\nbut are to be new-planted again, or abated to the very roots for a fresh\r\nshoot, which is best, and soon would furnish the places. In a word; as\r\nto the pruning of evergreen-hedges, there is no small skill and address\r\nto be us’d, in forming and trimming them for beauty and stability; by\r\nleaving the lower parts next the ground broader (two foot were\r\nsufficient for the thickness of the tallest hedge) than the tops,\r\ngradually, so as not much to exceed a foot breadth at the upmost verge,\r\n(as architects diminish walls of stone and brick from the foundation)\r\nfor they will else be apt to bend and swagg, especially laden with\r\nWinter-snows or ice; grow too thick, heat, wither, and foul within, dry\r\nand sticky especially; when it were more than time they were cut close\r\nto earth, for a fresh and verdant Spring; and this method is to be\r\npractis’d in all hedges whatsoever.\r\n\r\n18. But would you yet improve the standard which I celebrate, to greater\r\nand more speedy exaltation? Bud your laurel on the black-cherry stock to\r\nwhat height you please: This I had from an ocular testimony, who was\r\nmore than somewhat doubtful of such alliances; though something like it\r\nin Palladius speaks it not so impossible;\r\n\r\n    A cherry graft on laurel-stock does stain\r\n    The virgin fruit in a deep double grain.{308:1}\r\n\r\n19. They are rais’d of the seeds or berries with extraordinary facility,\r\nor propagated by layers, _taleae_, and cuttings, set about the latter\r\nend of August, or earlier at St. James-tide, where-ever there is shade\r\nand moisture. Besides that of the wood, the leaves of this laurel boil’d\r\nin milk, impart a very grateful tast of the almond; and of the berry (or\r\ncherries rather, of which poultrey generally feed on) is made a wine, to\r\nsome not unpleasant: I find little concerning the uses of this tree; of\r\nthe wood are said to be made the best plow-handles. Now that this rare\r\ntree was first brought from Civita Vecchia into England, by the Countess\r\nof Arundel, wife to that illustrious patron of arts and antiquities,\r\nThomas Earl of Arundel and Surrey, Great Great Grand-Father to his Grace\r\nthe present Duke of Norfolk, whom I left sick at Padoa, where he died;\r\nhighly displeased at his grand-son Philip’s putting on the friars-frock,\r\ntho’ afterwards the purple, when Cardinal of Norfolk: After all, I\r\ncannot easily assent to the tradition, tho’ I had it from a noble hand:\r\nI rather think it might first be brought out of some more northerly\r\nclime, the nature of the tree so delighting and flourishing in the shady\r\nand colder exposures, and abhorrence of heat.\r\n\r\nTo crown this chapter then, tho’ in the last place, (for so _finis\r\ncoronat opus_) we reserve the bay tree.\r\n\r\n20. Bays, [_laurus vulgaris_]. The learned Isaac Vossius and\r\netymologists are wonderfully curious, in their conjecture concerning its\r\nderivation; (_a laude_ says Issidor,) and from the ingenious poet, we\r\nlearn how it became sacred to Apollo, the patron of the wits, and ever\r\nsince the meed of conquerors and heroic persons. But leaving fiction, we\r\npass to the culture of this noble and fragrant tree, propagated both by\r\ntheir seeds, roots, suckers or layers: They (namely, the berries) should\r\nbe gather’d dropping-ripe: Pliny has a particular process for the\r\nordering of them, not to be rejected, which is to gather them in\r\nJanuary, and spreading them till their sweat be over; then he puts them\r\nin dung and sows them: As for the steeping in wine, water does\r\naltogether as well, others wash the seeds from their mucilage, by\r\nbreaking and bruising glutinous berries; then sow them in rich ground in\r\nMarch, by scores in a heap; and indeed so they will come up in\r\nclusters, but nothing so well, nor fit for transplantation, as where\r\nthey are interr’d with a competent scattering, so as you would furrow\r\npease: Both this way, and by setting them apart (which I most commend) I\r\nhave rais’d multitudes, and that in the berries, kept in sand till the\r\nSpring, without any farther preparation; only for the first two years,\r\nthey would be defended from the piercing winds, which frequently destroy\r\nthem; and yet the scorching of their tender leaves ought not to make you\r\ndespair, for many of them will recover beyond expectation; nay, tho’\r\nquite cut down, they repullulate and produce young suckers: Such as are\r\nrais’d of berries, may at 3 years growth be transplanted; which let\r\nalone too long, are difficult to take.\r\n\r\n21. This aromatic tree greatly loves the mothers shade, (under which\r\nnothing else will prosper) yet thrives best in our hottest gravel,\r\nhaving once pass’d those first difficulties: Age, and culture about the\r\nroots, wonderfully augment its growth; so as I have seen trees near\r\nthirty foot high of them, and almost two foot diameter. They make\r\nwalking-staves, strait, strong and light, for old gentlemen; and are fit\r\nalso both for arbour and palisade-work, so the gardener understand when\r\nto prune and keep it from growing too woody. And here I cannot but take\r\nnotice of those beautiful case-standards, which of late you have had out\r\nof Flanders, &c. with stems so even and upright; heads so round, full,\r\nand flourishing, as seem to exceed all the topiary ornaments of the\r\ngarden; that one tree of them has been sold for more than twenty pounds;\r\ntho’ now the mystery reveal’d, the price be much abated: And doubtless\r\nas good might be rais’d here, (without sending beyond-sea for them)\r\nwere our gardeners as industrious to cultivate and shape them: Some\r\nthere are, who imagine them of another species than our ordinary bay,\r\nbut erroneously. I wonder we plant not whole groves of them, and abroad;\r\nthey being hardy enough, grow upright, and would make a noble\r\n_daphneon_. The berries are emollient, soveraign in affections of the\r\nnerves, collics, gargarisms, baths, salves, and perfumes: Bay-leaves\r\ndryed in a fire-pan, and reduc’d to a fine powder, as much as will cover\r\nhalf a crown, being drank in wine, seldom fail of curing an ague. And\r\nsome have us’d the leaves instead of cloves, imparting its relish in\r\nsauce, especially of fish; and the very dry sticks of the tree, strew’d\r\nover with a little powder or dust of sulphur, and vehemently rub’d\r\nagainst one another, will immediately take fire; as will likewise the\r\nwood of an old ivy; nay, without any intentive addition, by friction\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n21. Amongst other things, it has of old been observ’d that the bay is\r\nominous of some funest accident, if that be so accounted which Suetonius\r\n(in _Galba_) affirms to have happen’d before the death of the monster\r\nNero, when these trees generally wither’d to the very roots in a very\r\nmild winter: And much later, that in the year 1629, when at Padoa,\r\npreceding a great pestilence, almost all the bay-trees about that famous\r\nUniversity grew sick and perish’d: _Certo quasi praesagio_ (says my\r\nauthor) _Apollinem musaque subsequenti anno urbe illa bonarum literarum\r\ndomicilio excessuras_. --But that this was extraordinary, we are told\r\nthe emperor Claudius upon occasion of a raging pestilence, was by his\r\nphysicians advis’d to remove his court to Laurentium, the aromatick\r\nemissions of that tree being in such reputation for clearing the air,\r\nand resisting contagion; upon which account I question not but Pliny\r\n(the nephew) was so frequently at his beloved Laurentium, so near the\r\ncity. Besides, for their vertue against lightning, which Tiberius so\r\nexceedingly dreaded, that when it came with thunder, he would creep\r\nunder his bed to avoid it, and shaded his head with the boughs. The\r\nstory of the branch in the bill of the white-hen, let fall into the lap\r\nof Livia Drusilla, being planted, prosper’d so floridly, as made it\r\nreputed so sacred, as to use it for impaling the heads of the triumphing\r\nemperors, and to adorn the _limina_ of the temples and royal palace of\r\nthe great Pontiff; and thence call’d _janitrices Caesarum_:\r\n\r\n    _Cum tandem apposita velantur limina lauro,\r\n    Cingit & Augustas arbor opaca fores!\r\n    Num quia perpetuos meruerunt ista triumphos?_\r\n\r\nAs still at present in Rome and other cities, they use to trim up their\r\nchurches and monastries on solemn festivals, when there is station and\r\nindulgences granted in honour of the saint or patron; as also on\r\noccasion of signal victories, and other joyful tidings; and those\r\ngarlands made up with hobby-horse tinsel, make a glitterring show, and\r\nrattling noise when the air moves them.\r\n\r\nWith the leaves of laurel, they made up their dispatches and letters,\r\n_laureis involutae_, wrapt in bay-leaves, which they sent to the senate\r\nfrom the victorious general: The spears, lances and _fasces_, nay, tents\r\nand ships, &c. were all dress’d up with laurels; and in triumph every\r\ncommon-soldier carryed a sprig in their hand, as we may see in the\r\nancient and best _bass-relievo_ of the ancients, as of virtue to purge\r\nthem from blood and slaughter. And now after all this, might one\r\nconjecture by a mere inspection of those several sculps, statues, and\r\nmedals yet exstant, representing the heads of emperors, poets, &c. the\r\nwreaths and coronets seem to be compos’d of a more flexible and\r\ncompliant species than the common bay, and more applicable to the brows,\r\nexcept where the ends and stalks of the tender branch were tyed together\r\nwith a _lemnisc_ or ribbon. And there be yet{313:1} who contend for the\r\nAlexandrian laurel, and the _tinus_ as more ductile; but without any\r\ngood evidence. Pliny I find says nothing of this question, naming only\r\nthe Cyprian and Delphic; besides, the figure, colour of the rind and\r\nleaf, crackling in the fire, which it impugns, (as ’tis said it does\r\nlightning) gives plainly the honour of it to the common bay. We say\r\nnothing of its sacred use in the Gentile lustration, purgation, and\r\nseveral other attributes. To conclude;\r\n\r\n    From laurel{313:3} chew’d the Pythian priestess rose,\r\n    Events of future actions to disclose.\r\n    Laurel triumphant generals did wear,\r\n    And laurel heralds in their hands did bear.\r\n    Poets ambitious of unfading praise,\r\n    Phoebus, the Muses all are crown’d with bays.\r\n    And vertue to her sons the prize does name\r\n    Symbol of glory, and immortal fame.{313:2}\r\n\r\nI have now finish’d my planting: A word or two concerning their\r\npreservation, and the cure of their infirmities, expect in the following\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n{294:1}\r\n\r\n    Arbuteæ crates, & mystica vannus Iacchi.\r\n\r\n    _Georg. 1._\r\n\r\n{296:1}\r\n\r\n            ............Non ultima belli\r\n    Arma puellaris; laqueos hæc nectit amantûm,\r\n    Et venatricis disponit retia formæ.\r\n\r\n    _Couleii_ pl. l. 6.\r\n\r\n{297:1}\r\n\r\n    Quàm multa arboribus tribuuntur crimina falsa?\r\n\r\n{300:1}\r\n\r\n    Hic ver perpetuum, atque alienis mensibus æstas.\r\n\r\n{301:1}\r\n\r\n    .....Mala furta hominum densis mucronibus arcens\r\n    Securum defendit inexpugnabilis hortum;\r\n    Exornatque simul, toto spectabilis anno,\r\n    Et numero, & viridi foliorum luce nitentûm.\r\n\r\n    _Couleii Pl. l. 6._\r\n\r\n{308:1}\r\n\r\n    Inseritur lauro cerasus, partuque coacto\r\n      Tingit adoptivus virginis ora pudor.\r\n\r\n{313:1} Carol. _Avanti_ not. in cornan.

Suckers shall be duly eradicated, and with a sharp spade dexterously\r\nseparated from the mother-roots, and transplanted in convenient places\r\nfor propagation, as the season requires.\r\n\r\nHere note, that fruit graffed upon suckers, are more dispos’d to\r\nproduce suckers, than such as are propagated upon good stocks.\r\n\r\n3. Fern, is best destroy’d by striking off the tops, as Tarquin did the\r\nheads of the poppies: This done with a good wand, or cudgel, at the\r\ndecrease in the Spring, and now and then in Summer, kills it (as also it\r\ndoes nettles) in a year or two, (but most infallibly, by being eaten\r\ndown at its spring, by Scotch-sheep) beyond the vulgar way of mowing, or\r\nburning, which rather encreases, than diminishes it.\r\n\r\n4. Over-much wet is to be drain’d by trenches, where it infests the\r\nroots of such kinds as require drier ground: But if a drip do fret into\r\nthe body of a tree by the head (which will certainly decay it) cutting\r\nfirst the place smooth, stop and cover it with loam and hay, or a\r\ncerecloth, till a new bark succeed. But not only the wet, which is to be\r\ndiverted by trenching the ground, is exitial to many trees, but their\r\nrepletion of too abundant nourishment; and therefore sometimes there may\r\nbe as much occasion to use the lancet, as phlebotomy and venaesection to\r\nanimals; especially if the hypothesis hold, of the superfluous\r\nmoisture’s descent into the roots, to be re-concocted; but where, in\r\ncase it be more copious than{316:1} can be there elaborated, it turns to\r\ncorruption, and sends up a tainted juice, which perverts the whole habit\r\nof the tree: In this exigence therefore, it were perhaps more\r\ncounsellable to draw it out by a deep incision, and to depend upon a new\r\nsupply, than upon confidence of correcting this evil quality, by other\r\nmedications, to let it perish. Other causes of their sickness (not\r\nalways taken notice of) proceed from too liberal refreshments and\r\nover-watering in dry and scorching seasons; especially in nurseries:\r\nThe water should therefore be fitly qualify’d, neither brackish, bitter,\r\nstagnat, or putrid, sower, acrimonious, vitriolic, arenous and gravelly,\r\nchurlish, harsh and lean; (I mention them promiscuously) and whatever\r\nvicious quality they are perceptibly tinctur’d and impregnate with,\r\nbeing by no means proper drink for plants: Wherefore a very critical\r\nexamen of this so necessary an element (the very principle, as some\r\nthink, and only nutriment of vegetables){317:1} is highly to be\r\nregarded, together with more than ordinary skill how to apply it: In\r\norder to which, the constitution and texture of plants and trees are\r\nphilosophically to be consider’d; some affecting macerations with dung\r\nand other mixtures (which I should not much commend) others quite\r\ncontrary, the quick and running spring, dangerous enough, and worse than\r\nsnow-water, which is not in some cases to be rejected: Generally\r\ntherefore that were to be chosen, which passing silently through ponds\r\nand other receptacles, exposed to the sun and air, nearest approaching\r\nto that of rain, dropping from the uberous cloud, is certainly the most\r\nnatural and nursing: As to the quantity, some plants require plentiful\r\nwatering, others, rather often, than all at once; all of them sucking it\r\nin by the root for the most part, which are their mouths, and carry it\r\nthence through all the canales, organs and members of the whole\r\nvegetable body, digested and qualified so as to maintain and supply\r\ntheir being and growth, for the producing of whatever they afford for\r\nthe use of man, and other living creatures.\r\n\r\n5. The bark-bound are to be released by drawing your knife rind-deep\r\nfrom the root, as far as you can conveniently, drawing your knife from\r\nthe top downwards half-way, and at a small distance, from the bottom\r\nupwards, the other half; this, in more places, as the bulk of the stem\r\nrequires; and if crooked, cut deep, and frequent in the ham; and if the\r\ngaping be much filling the rift with a little cow-dung; do this on each\r\nside, and at Spring, February or March: Also cutting off some branches\r\nis profitable; especially such as are blasted, or lightning-struck: If\r\n(as sometimes also) it proceed from the baking of the earth about the\r\nstem, lighten, and stir it.\r\n\r\n6. The _teredo_, _cossi_, and other worms, lying between the body and\r\nthe bark, (which it separates) poyson that passage to the great\r\nprejudice of some trees; but the holes being once found, they are to be\r\ntaken out with a light incision, the wound covered with loam; or let the\r\ndry-part of the wood (bark and all) be cut: applying only a wash of piss\r\nand vinegar twice or thrice a week during a month: The best means to\r\nfind out their quarters, is to follow the wood-pecker, and other birds,\r\noften pitching upon the stem (as you may observe them) and knocking with\r\ntheir bills, give notice that the tree is infected, at least, between\r\nthe bark. But there are divers kinds of these ξυλόφαγοι of which the\r\nτερηδὼν or _tarmes_ we have mentioned, will sometimes make such a\r\nnoise in a tree, as to awaken a sleeping man: The more rugous are the\r\n_cossi_, of old had in _deliciis_ amongst the epicures, who us’d to\r\nfatten them in flower; and this, (as Tertullian, and S. Hierom tells us)\r\nwas the chief food of the _hierophantae Cereris_; as they are at this\r\nday a great _regalo_ in Japan: In the mean time, experience has taught\r\nus, that _millipedes_ wood-lice (to be plentifully found under old\r\ntimber-logs, being dry’d and reduc’d to powder, and taken in drink) are\r\nan admirable specific against the jaundies, scorbut, &c. to purifie the\r\nblood, and clarifie the sight.\r\n\r\nThere is a pestilent green-worm which hides it self in the earth, and\r\ngets into pots and cases, eating our seedlings, and gnawing the very\r\nroots, which should be searched out: And now we mention roots,\r\nover-grown toads will sometimes nestle at the roots of trees, when they\r\nmake a cavern, which they infect with a poysonous vapour, of which the\r\nleaves famish’d and flagging give notice, and the enemy dug out with the\r\nspade: But this chiefly concerns the gardners mural fruit-trees; though\r\nI question not but that even our forest-trees suffer by such pernicious\r\nvapours, rats, and other stinking vermine making their nests within\r\nthem. But of all these, let our industrious planter, (especially the\r\nlearned favourers of the most refined parts of horticulture) consult the\r\nDiscourses and experiments of _Sign._ Fran. Redi, Malphigius, Levenhock,\r\nSwamerdam, &c. with our own learned Doctors, Lyster, Sloane, Hook, (and\r\nother sagacious naturalists) to shew, that none of these diseases and\r\ninfirmities in plants proceed from any pure accidental, but real cause;\r\n_flatus_, venemous liquor, and infections: Which some, even of the\r\nminutest animals, are provided with instruments to pierce the very solid\r\nsubstances of trees and plants, and infuse their pestiferous taint;\r\nwhere likewise they leave their eggs, boaring those nestling places with\r\na certain _terebra_, where we find those innumerable perforations which\r\nwe call worm-eaten; the wider _latebrae_ are made by _erucae_,\r\ncaterpillars, ants, and bigger insects, raising morbid tumors and\r\nexcrescences, and preying upon the fruit, as well as on the leaves, buds\r\nand flowers, so soon as their eggs are hatch’d, when they creep out of\r\ntheir little caverns in armies, like the Egyptian locusts, invading all\r\nthat’s green, and tender rudiments first, and then attacking the\r\ntougher and solider parts of vegetables: To those learned persons above,\r\nwe may not forget the late worthy and pious Mr. Ray, where in the second\r\npart of his treatise, of the _Wisdom of God in the Creation_, we have a\r\nbrief, but ingenious account of what concerns this subject, together\r\nwith what is added about spontaneous productions of these despicable\r\nanimals, to which I refer the curious.\r\n\r\nTrees (especially fruit-bearers) are infested with the measels, by being\r\nburned and scorched with the sun in great droughts: To this commonly\r\nsucceeds lousiness, which is cur’d by boring an hole into the principal\r\nroot, and pouring in a quantity of brandy, stopping the orifice up with\r\na pin of the same wood.\r\n\r\nCrooked trees are reform’d by taking off or topping the præponderers,\r\nwhilst charg’d with leaves, or woody and hanging counterpoises.\r\n\r\nExcorticated and bark-bared trees, may be preserved by nourishing up a\r\nshoot from the foot, or below the stripped place, and inserting it into\r\na slit above the wounded part; to be done in the Spring, and secur’d\r\nfrom air, as you treat a graff: This I have out of the very industrious\r\nMr. Cook, p. 48. But Dr. Merret brought us in this relation to the Royal\r\nSociety, that making a square section of the rinds of ash, and sycomore\r\n(March 1664,) whereof three sides were cut, and one not, the success\r\nwas, that the whole bark did unite, being bound with pack-thread,\r\nleaving only a scar: But being separated intirely from the tree, namely\r\nseveral parts of the bark, and at various depths, leaving on some part\r\nof the bark, others cut to the very wood it self, being tied on as the\r\nformer, a new rind succeeded in their place; but what was cover’d over\r\nbeyond the places of incision with diachylon plaister, and also bound\r\nas the rest, did within the space of three weeks, unite to the tree,\r\ntho’ with some shriveling and scar: The same experiment try’d about\r\nMichaelmas, and in the Winter, came to nothing: Where some branches were\r\ndecorticated quite round, without any union, a withering of the branch\r\nbeyond the incision, ensu’d: Also a twig separated from a branch, with a\r\nsloping cut, and fastn’d to it again in the same posture, bound and\r\ncover’d with the former plaister, wither’d in three days time: Among\r\nother easie remedies, a cere-cloth of fresh-butter and hony, apply’d\r\nwhilst the wound is green, (especially in Summer) and bound about with a\r\nthrum-rope of moist hay, and rubb’d with cow-dung has healed many: But\r\nfor rare and more tender trees, after pruning, take purely refined\r\ntallow, mingled and well harden’d with a little loamy earth, and\r\nhorse-dung newly made.\r\n\r\nDr. Plot speaks of an elm growing near the bowling-green at\r\nMagdalen-College, quite round disbark’d almost for a yard near the\r\nground, which yet flourishes exceedingly; upon which he dilates into an\r\naccurate discourse, how it should possibly be; all trees being held to\r\nreceive their nutrition between the wood and the bark, and to perish\r\nupon their separation; this tree being likewise hollow as a drum, and\r\nits outmost surface (where decorticated) dry, and dead. The solution of\r\nthis phaenomenon (and to all appearance, from the verdant head) could\r\nnot have been more philosophically resolv’d, than by the hypothesis\r\nthere produc’d by the Doctor, who assures me, he was yet deliberating\r\nwhether the tree being hollow, it might not possibly proceed from some\r\nother latent cause, as afterwards he discover’d when having obtain’d\r\npermission to open the body of it, he found another elm, letting down\r\nits stem all the length of this empty case, and striking root when it\r\ncame to the earth, from whence it deriv’d nourishment, maintains a\r\nflourishing top, and has (till now) pass’d for a little miracle, as it\r\nstill may do for a thing extraordinary, and rare enough; considering not\r\nonly its passage, and how it should come there, unless haply some of the\r\n_samera_, or seed of the old tree (when pregnant) should have luckily\r\nfallen down within the hollow pipe, or (as might be conjectur’d) from\r\nsome sucker springing of a juicy root: But the strange incorporating of\r\nthe superior part of the bole, with the old hollow tree which embraces\r\nit, not by any perceptible roots, but as if it were but one body with\r\nit, whilst the rest of the vaginated stem touches no other part of the\r\nwhole cavity, till it comes to the ground, is surprizing. This being\r\nbesides very extraordinary, that a tree, which naturally grows taper as\r\nit approaches the top, should swell, and become bigger there than it is\r\nbelow. But this the Doctor will himself render a more minute account of\r\nin the next impression of that excellent piece of his; nor had I\r\nanticipated it on this occasion, but to let the world know (in the mean\r\ntime) how ingenuously ready he is to acknowlege the mistake, as he has\r\nbeen successful in discovering it.\r\n\r\nDeer, conies, and hares, by barking the trees in hard Winters, spoil\r\nvery many tender plantations: Next to the utter destroying them, there\r\nis nothing better than to anoint that part which is within their reach,\r\nwith _stercus humanum_, tempered with a little water, or urine, and\r\nlightly brushed on; this renewed after every great rain: But a cleanlier\r\nthan this, and yet which conies, and even cattle most abhor, is to\r\nwater, or sprinkle them with tanners liquor, _viz._ that, which they use\r\nfor dressing their hides; or to wash with slak’d lime and water,\r\naltogether as expedient: Also to tye thumb-bands of hay and straw round\r\nthem as far as they can reach.\r\n\r\n8. Moss, (which is an adnascent plant) is to be rubb’d and scrap’d off\r\nwith some fit instrument of wood, which may not excorticate the tree, or\r\nwith a piece of hair-cloth after a sobbing rain; or by setting it on\r\nfire with a wisp of straw, about the end of December, if the season be\r\ndry, as they practise it in Stafford-shire; but the most infallible art\r\nof emuscation, is taking away the cause, (which is superfluous moisture\r\nin clayie and spewing grounds) by dressing with lime.\r\n\r\n9. Ivy is destroy’d by digging up the roots and loosning its hold: And\r\nyet even ivy it self (the destruction of many fair trees) if very old,\r\nand where it has long invested its support, if taken off) does\r\nfrequently kill the tree, by a too sudden exposure to the unaccustom’d\r\ncold: Of the roots of ivy (which with small industry may be made a\r\nbeautiful standard) are made curiously polish’d, and fleck’d cups and\r\nboxes, and even tables of great value. Misselto, and other excrescences\r\nto be cut and broken off. But the _fungi_ (which prognosticate a fault\r\nin the liver and entrails of trees, as we may call it) is remedied by\r\nabrasion, friction, interlucation and exposure to the sun.\r\n\r\n10. The bodies of trees are visited with canker, hollowness, hornets,\r\nearwigs, snails, &c.\r\n\r\n11. The wind-shock is a bruise, and shiver throughout the tree, though\r\nnot constantly visible, yet leading the warp from smooth renting, caused\r\nby over-powerful winds, when young, and perhaps, by subtil lightnings,\r\nby which the strongest oaks (and other the most robust trees) are fain\r\nto submit, and will be twisted like a rope of hemp, and therefore of old\r\nnot us’d to kindle the sacrifice. The same injury trees likewise often\r\nsuffer by rigorous and piercing colds and frosts; such as in the year\r\n1683, rived many stately timber-trees from head to foot; which as the\r\nweather grew milder, clos’d again, so as hardly to be discern’d; but\r\nwere found at the felling miserably shatter’d, and good for little: The\r\nbest prevention is shelter, choice of place for the plantation, frequent\r\nshreading, whilst they are yet in their youth. Wind-shaken is also\r\ndiscover’d by certain ribs, boils and swellings on the bark, beginning\r\nat the foot of the stem, and body of the tree, to the boughs. But\r\nagainst such frosts and fire from heaven there is no charm.\r\n\r\n12. Cankers, of all other diseases the most pernicious, corroding and\r\neating to the heart, and difficult to cure, whether (caused by some\r\nstroak, or galling, or by hot and burning land) are to be cut out to the\r\nquick, the scars emplastred with tar mingled with oyl, and over that, a\r\nthin spreading of loam; or else with clay and horse-dung; but best with\r\nhogs-dung alone, bound to it in a rag; or by laying wood-ashes, nettles,\r\nor fern to the roots, &c. You will know if the cure be effected, by the\r\ncolour of the wounds growing fresh and green, and not reddish: But if\r\nthe gangreen be within, it must be cured by nitrous, sulphureous and\r\ndrying applications, and by no means, by any thing of an unctious\r\nnature, which is exitial to trees: Tar, as was said, only excepted,\r\nwhich I have experimentally known to preserve trees from the envenom’d\r\nteeth of goats, and other injuries; the entire stem smear’d over,\r\nwithout the least prejudice, to my no small admiration: But for over-hot\r\nand torrid land, you must sadden the mould about the root with pond-mud,\r\nand neats-dung; and by graffing fruit trees on stocks rais’d in the same\r\nmould, as being more homogeneous.\r\n\r\n13. Hollowness, is contracted, when by reason of the ignorant, or\r\ncareless lopping of a tree, the wet is suffer’d to fall perpendicularly\r\nupon a part, especially the head, or any other part or arms, in which\r\nthe rain getting in, is conducted to the very heart of the stem and body\r\nof the tree, which it soon rots: In this case, if there be sufficient\r\nsound wood, cut it to the quick, and close to the body cap the hollow\r\npart with a tarpaulin, or fill it with good stiff loam, horse-dung and\r\nfine hay mingled, or with well-temper’d mortar, covering it with a piece\r\nof tarpaulin: This is one of the worst of evils, and to which the elm is\r\nmost obnoxious. Old broken boughs, if very great, are to be cut off at\r\nsome distance from the body, but the smaller, close.\r\n\r\n14. Hornets and wasps, &c. by breeding in the hollowness of trees, not\r\nonly infect them, but will peel them round to the very timber, as if\r\ncattle had unbark’d them, as I observed in some goodly ashes at\r\nCasioberry (near the garden of that late noble Lord, and lover of\r\nplanting, the Earl of Essex), and are therefore to be destroy’d, by\r\nstopping up their entrances with tar and goose-dung, or by conveying the\r\nfumes of brimstome into their cells: _Cantharides_ attack the ash above\r\nall other bobs of the betle kind: Chafers, &c. are to be shaken down and\r\ncrush’d, and when they come in armies, (as sometimes in extraordinary\r\ndroughts) they are to be driven away or destroy’d with smoaks; which\r\nalso kills gnats and flies of all sorts: Note, that the rose-bug never,\r\nor very seldom, attacks any other tree, whilst that sweet bush is in\r\nflower: Whole fields have been freed from worms by the reek and smoak of\r\nox-dung wrapt in mungy straw, well soak’d with strong lie.\r\n\r\n15. Earwigs and snails do seldom infest forest-trees, but those which\r\nare fruit-bearers; and are destroy’d by setting boards or tiles against\r\nthe walls, or the placing of neat-hoofs, or any hollow thing upon small\r\nstakes; also by enticing them into sweet waters, and by picking the\r\nsnails off betimes in the morning, and rainy evenings; I advise you\r\nvisit your cypress-trees on the first rains in April; you shall\r\nsometimes find them cover’d with young snails no bigger than small\r\npease: Lastly, branches, buds and leaves extreamly suffer from the\r\nblasts, jaundies, and catterpillars, locusts, rooks, &c. Note, that you\r\nshould visit the boards, tiles and hoofs which you set for the retreat\r\nof those insects, &c. in the heat of the day, to shake them out, and\r\nkill them.\r\n\r\n16. The blasted parts of trees (and so should gum) be cut away to the\r\nquick; and to prevent it, smoak them in suspicious weather, by burning\r\nmoist straw with the wind, or rather the dry and superfluous cuttings of\r\naromatic plants, such as rosemary, lavender, juniper, bays, &c. I use to\r\nwhip and chastise my cypresses with a wand, after their winter-burnings,\r\ntill all the mortified and scorch’d parts fly-off in dust, as long\r\nalmost as any will fall, and observe that they recover and spring the\r\nbetter. Mice, moles and pismires cause the jaundies in trees, known by\r\nthe discolour of the leaves and buds.\r\n\r\n17. The moles do much hurt, by making hollow passages, which grow\r\nmusty, but they may be taken in traps, and kill’d, as every woodman\r\nknows: It is certain that they are driven from their haunts by garlick\r\nfor a time, and other heady smells, buried in their passages.\r\n\r\n18. Mice, rats, with traps, or by sinking some vessel almost level with\r\nthe surface of the ground, the vessel half full of water, upon which let\r\nthere be strew’d some hulls, or chaff of oats; also with bane, powder of\r\norpiment in milk, and aconites mix’d with butter: _Cop’ras_ or\r\ngreen-glass broken with honey: Morsels of sponge chopp’d small and fry’d\r\nin lard, &c. are very fit baits to destroy these nimble creatures, which\r\nelse soon will ruin a semination of nuts, acorns and other kernels in a\r\nnight or two, and rob the largest beds of a nursery, carrying them away\r\nby thousands to their cavernous magazines, to serve them all the Winter:\r\nI have been told, that hop-branches stuck about trees, preserve them\r\nfrom these theivish creatures.\r\n\r\n19. Destroy pismires with scalding water, and disturbing their hills, or\r\nrubbing the stem with cow-dung, or a decoction of _tithymale_, washing\r\nthe infested parts; and this will insinuate, and chase them quite out of\r\nthe chinks and crevices, without prejudice to the tree, and is a good\r\nprevention of other infirmities; also by laying soot, sea-coal, or\r\nsaw-dust, or refuse tobacco where they haunt, often renew’d, especially\r\nafter rain; for becoming moist, the dust and powder harden, and then\r\nthey march over it.\r\n\r\n20. Caterpillars, by cutting off their webs from the twigs before the\r\nend of February, and burning them; the sooner the better: If they be\r\nalready hatched, wash them off with water, in which some of the\r\ncaterpillars themselves, and garlick have been bruis’d, or the juice of\r\nrue, decoctions of _colloquintida_, hemp-seed, worm-wood, tobacca,\r\nwall-nut-shells, when green, with the leaves of sage, urine and ashes,\r\nand the like aspersions. Take of two or three of the ingredients, of\r\neach an handful in two pails of water; make them boil in it half an\r\nhour, then strain the liquor, and sprinkle it on the trees infected with\r\ncaterpillars, the black-flea, &c. in two or three times it will clear\r\nthem, and should be us’d about the time of blossoming. Another, is to\r\nchoak and dry them with smoak of _galbanum_, shoo-soals, hair; and some\r\naffirm that planting the pionie near them, is a certain remedy; but\r\nthere is no remedy so facile, as the burning them off with small wisps\r\nof dry straw, which in a moment rids you.\r\n\r\n21. Rooks do in time, by pinching off the buds and tops of trees for\r\ntheir nests, cause many trees and groves to decay: Their dung propagates\r\nnettles and choaks young seedlings: They are to be shot, and their nests\r\ndemolish’d. The bullfinch and titmouse also eat off and spoil the buds\r\nof fruit-trees; prevented by clappers, or caught in the wyre mouse-trap\r\nwith teeth, and baited with a piece of rusty bacon, also with\r\nlime-twigs. But if cattle break in before the time, _conclamatum est_,\r\nespecially goats, whose mouths and breath is poison to trees; they never\r\nthrive well after; and Varro affirms, if they but lick the olive-tree,\r\nthey become immediately barren. And now we have mention’d barrenness, we\r\ndo not reckon trees to be sterile, which do not yield a fruitful burden\r\nconstantly every year (as juniper and some annotines do) no more than of\r\npregnant women: Whilst that is to be accounted a fruitful tree which\r\nyields its product every second or third year, as the oak and most\r\nforresters do; no more may we conclude that any tree or vegetable are\r\ndestitute of seeds, because we see them not so perspicuously with our\r\nnaked eyes, by reason of their exility, as with the nicest examination\r\nof the microscope.\r\n\r\n22. Another touch at the winds; for though they cannot properly be said\r\nto be infirmities of trees; yet they are amongst the principal causes\r\nthat render trees infirm. I know no surer protection against them, than\r\n(as we said) to shelter and stake them whilst they are young, till they\r\nhave well establish’d roots; and with this caution, that in case any\r\ngoodly trees (which you would desire especially to preserve and redress)\r\nchance to be prostrated by some impetuous and extraordinary storm; you\r\nbe not over-hasty to carry him away, or despair of him; (nor is it of\r\nany ominous concern at all, but the contrary) _fausti ominis_, as Pliny\r\nsays; and gives many illustrious instances: And as to other strange and\r\nunusual events following the accidental subversion of trees; concerning\r\nomens; and that some are portentous, others fortunate, of which\r\nsee{329:1} Pierius, speaking of a garden of the Duke of Tuscany,\r\nbelonging to a palace of his at Rome, a little before the death of Pope\r\nLeo; and before this, about the time of our country-man, Pope Adrian the\r\nIVth. First then, let me perswade you to pole him close, and so let him\r\nlie some time; for by this means, many vast trees have rais’d themselves\r\nby the vigour only of the remaining roots, without any other assistance;\r\nso as people have pronounc’d it miraculous, as I could tell you by\r\nseveral instances, besides what Theophrastus relates, l. 5. c. 19. of\r\nthat huge _platanus_, which rose in one night in his observation; which\r\nputs me in mind of what I remember the very learned critic Palmerius\r\naffirms of an oak, subverted by a late tempest near Breda, (where this\r\nold soldier militated under Prince Maurice, at the town when besieg’d by\r\nthe famous Marq. Spinola) which tree, after it had lain prostrate about\r\n2 months, (the side-branches par’d off) rose up of it self, and\r\nflourish’d as well as ever. Which event was thought so extraordinary,\r\nthat the people reserved sprigs and boughs of it, as sacred reliques;\r\nand this he affirms to have seen himself. I take the more notice of\r\nthese accidents, that none who have trees blown down, where it may cause\r\na deform’d gap in some avenue near their seats, may not altogether\r\ndespair of their resurrection, with patience and timely freeing them.\r\nAnd the like to this I find happen’d in more than one tree near Bononia\r\nin Italy, _anno_ 1657. when of late a turbulent gust had almost quite\r\neradicated a very large tract of huge poplars, belonging to the\r\nMarchioness Elephantucca Spada, that universally erected themselves\r\nagain, after they were beheaded, as they lay even prostrate.{330:1} What\r\nsays the naturalist? _Prostratas restitui plerumque, & quadam terrae\r\ncicatrice reviviscere, vulgare est_: ’Tis familiar (says Pliny) in the\r\n_platanus_, which are very obnoxious to the winds, by reason of the\r\nthickness of their branches, which being cut off and discharged, restore\r\nthemselves. This also frequently happens in wall-nuts, olive-trees, and\r\nseveral others, as he affirms, l. 16. c. 31. But we have farther\r\ninstances than these, and so very lately as that dreadful storm\r\nhappening 26 Nov. 1703, when after so many thousand oaks, and other\r\ntimber-trees were quite subverted, a most famous and monstrous, oak\r\ngrowing at Epping in Essex, (blown down) raised it self, and withstood\r\nthat hurricane. These (amongst many others) are the infirmities to which\r\nforest-trees are subject, whilst they are standing; and when they are\r\nfell’d, to the worm; especially if cut before the sap be perfectly at\r\nrest: But to prevent or cure it in the timber, I commend this secret as\r\nthe most approv’d.\r\n\r\n23. Let common yellow sulphur be put into a cucurbit-glass, upon which\r\npour so much of the strongest _aqua-fortis_, as may cover it three\r\nfingers deep: distil this to dryness, which is done by two or three\r\nrectifications: Let the sulphur remaining in the bottom (being of a\r\nblackish or sad-red colour) be laid on a marble, or put into a glass,\r\nwhere it will easily dissolve into oil: With this, anoint what is either\r\ninfected, or to be preserved of timber. It is a great and excellent\r\n_arcanum_ for tinging the wood with no unpleasant colour, by no art to\r\nbe washed out; and such a preservative of all manner of woods; nay, of\r\nmany other things; as ropes, cables, fishing-nets, masts of ships, &c.\r\nthat it defends them from putrefaction, either in waters under or above\r\nthe earth, in the snow, ice, air, Winter or Summer, &c. It were\r\nsuperfluous to describe the process of the _aqua-fortis_; It shall be\r\nsufficient to let you know, that our common _coperas_ makes this\r\n_aqua-fortis_ well enough for our purpose, being drawn over by a retort:\r\nAnd for sulphur, the Island of St. Christophers yields enough, (which\r\nhardly needs any refining) to furnish the whole world. This secret (for\r\nthe curious) I thought fit not to omit; though a more compendious, three\r\nor four anointings with linseed-oyl, has prov’d very effectual: It was\r\nexperimented in a wall-nut-table, where it destroy’d millions of worms\r\nimmediately, and is to be practis’d for tables, tubes,\r\nmathematical-instruments, boxes, bed-steads, chairs, rarities, &c. Oyl\r\nof wall-nuts will doubtless do the same, is sweeter, and a better\r\nvarnish; but above all, is commended oyl of cedar, or that of juniper;\r\nwhilst oyl of spike does the cure as effectual as any.\r\n\r\nBut after all these sweeping plagues and destructions inflicted on\r\ntrees, (braving all humane remedies) such frosts as not many\r\nyears{332:1} since hap’ned, left such marks of their deadly effects, not\r\nsparing the goodliest and most flourishing trees, timber, and other of\r\nthe stoutest kind; as some ages will hardly repair: Nay, ’twas observ’d,\r\nthat the oak in particular (counted the most valiant and sturdy of the\r\nwhole forest) was more prejudic’d with this excessive cold, and the\r\ndrowth of the year ensuing, than any of the most nice and tender\r\nconstitution: Always here excepting (as to a universal _strages_) the\r\nhurricane of Sept. 1703, which begins the epocha of the calamities,\r\nwhich have since follow’d, not only by the late tempest about\r\nAugust{332:2} last, but by that surprizing blast, accompany’d doubtless\r\nwith a fiery spirit, which smote the most flourishing foresters and\r\nfruit trees, burning their buds and leaves to dust and powder, not\r\nsparing the very fruit. This being done in a moment, must be look’d upon\r\nas a plague not to be prevented: In the mean time, that the malignity\r\nproceed no farther, it may be advisable to cut, and top the summities of\r\nsuch tender mural trees, rare shrubs, &c. as have most suffer’d, and\r\nare within reach, rubbing off the scorchings in order to new spring.\r\n\r\nThere was in my remembrance, certain prayers, litanies and collects,\r\nsolemnly us’d by the parish-minister in the field, at the limits of\r\ntheir perambulations on the Rogation-days; from an ancient and laudable\r\ncustom of above 1000 years, introduc’d by Avitus the pious bishop of\r\nVienna, in a great dearth, unseasonable weather, and other calamities,\r\n(however in tract of time abus’d by many gross superstitions and\r\ninsignificant rites, in imitation of the pagan _robigalia_) upon which\r\ndays, (about the Ascension, and beginning of Spring especially) prayers\r\nwere made, as well deprecatory of epidemical evils, (amongst which\r\nblasts and smut of corn were none of the least) as supplications for\r\npropitious seasons, and blessings on the fruits of the earth. Whether\r\nthere was any peculiar _Office_, (besides those for Ember-weeks)\r\nappointed, I do not know: But the pious and learned bishop of\r\nWinchester, [Andrews] has in his _Devotions_, left us a prayer so\r\napposite and comprehensive for these emergencies, that I cannot forbear\r\nthe recital.\r\n\r\nRemember, O Lord, to renew the year with thy goodness, and the season\r\nwith a promising temper: For the eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord:\r\nThou givest them meat; thou openest thy hand, and fillest all things\r\nliving with thy bounty. Vouchsafe therefore, O Lord, the blessings of\r\nthe heavens, and the dews from above: The blessings of the springs, and\r\nthe deep from beneath: The returns of the sun, the conjunctions of the\r\nmoon: The benefit of the rising mountains, and the lasting hills: The\r\nfullness of the earth, and all that breed therein.\r\n\r\n           A fruitful season,\r\n             Temperate air,\r\n             Plenty of corn,\r\n           Abundance of fruits,\r\n           Health of body, and\r\n             Peaceable times,\r\n        Good, and wise government,\r\n             Prudent counsels,\r\n                Just laws,\r\n           Righteous judgments,\r\n             Loyal obedience,\r\n         Due execution of justice,\r\n        Sufficient store for life,\r\n              Happy births,\r\n          Good, and fair plenty,\r\n    Breeding and institution of children:\r\n\r\nThat our sons may grow up as the young plants, and our daughters may be\r\nas the polished corners of the Temple: That our garners may be full and\r\nplenteous with all manner of store: That our sheep may bring forth\r\nthousands: That our oxen may be strong to labour: That there be no\r\ndecay; no leading into captivity; no complaining in our streets: But\r\nthat every man may sit under his own vine, and under his own fig-tree,\r\nin thankfulness to thee; sobriety and charity to his neighbour; and in\r\nwhatsoever other estate, thou wilt have him, therewith to be contented:\r\nAnd this for Jesus Christ his sake, to whom be glory for ever, Amen.\r\n\r\n24. Thus hitherto I have spoken of trees, their kinds, and propagation\r\nin particular; with such prescriptions for the cure and healing their\r\ninfirmities, as from long and late experience have been found most\r\neffectual. Now a word or two concerning the laws relating to\r\nforest-trees, casting such other accidental lessons into a few\r\naphorisms, as could not well be more regularly inserted.\r\n\r\nLastly, I shall conclude with some more serious observations, in\r\nreference to the main design and project of this discourse, as it\r\nconcerns the improvement of the royal forests, and other timber-trees,\r\nfor the honour, security, and benefit of the whole kingdom; with an\r\nhistorical account of standing-groves, which will be the subject of the\r\nnext books.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n{316:1} See Cap. 3 lib. 3 sect. 25.\r\n\r\n{317:1} See Cap. 2 Book 1.\r\n\r\n{329:1} _Hierog._ l. 50.\r\n\r\n{330:1} See cap. 4. lib. 2. of a cypress.\r\n\r\n{332:1} 1683.\r\n\r\n{332:2} 1705.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n           *       *       *       *\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER’S NOTES\r\n\r\nThe spelling and punctuation in the original are idiosyncratic and\r\ninconsistent. A few clear typographical errors have been corrected,\r\nand are noted below.\r\n\r\nCitations have not been checked for correctness; errors that came to\r\nthe transcriber’s attention are noted below. Citation references do not\r\nalways follow a standard format.\r\n\r\nModern conventions are not used for parentheses (). In particular, nested\r\nparentheses are opened many times, but closed only once, or vice versa.\r\n\r\nThe arabic numeral 1 and the roman numeral I are indistinguishable\r\nin the original. It has not always been possible to tell unambiguously\r\nwhich was meant.\r\n\r\nMany footnote markers are midway between two words in the original.\r\nThey have been left like that in this transcription. The markers for\r\nmany footnotes giving the source of poetry quotations are at the\r\nbeginning of the relevant quotation in the original. They have been\r\nmoved to the end of the quotation for ease of presentation.\r\n\r\nCORRECTIONS and NOTES\r\n\r\nTable of Contents\r\n\r\n  “Holly, Pyracinth,” changed to “Holly, Pyracanth,” on page vi\r\n\r\n  Volume II (books III and IV), whose contents are listed on page vii,\r\n  is not included in this etext.\r\n\r\nIntroduction §I\r\n\r\n  “Newton in mathamatical” changed to “Newton in mathematical” on page ix\r\n\r\n  “Secretary of the Admirality” changed to\r\n  “Secretary of the Admiralty” on page xv\r\n\r\nIntroduction §III\r\n\r\n  “he was bled of the physican” changed to\r\n  “he was bled of the physician” on page xxvii\r\n\r\nIntroduction §V\r\n\r\n  “these numerous parishes),’ ” changed to\r\n  “these numerous parishes’), ” on page xxxix\r\n\r\n  “commerial work controlled by the Council of Plantations” changed to\r\n  “commercial work controlled by the Council of Plantations” on page xlv\r\n\r\nIntroduction §VI\r\n\r\n  “In May 1904” changed to “In May 1694” on page li\r\n\r\n  “During the course of his long and distinguised life” changed to\r\n  “During the course of his long and distinguished life” on page liii.\r\n\r\nIntroduction §VIII\r\n\r\n  “_Quarterly Review_ aricles was connected” changed to\r\n  “_Quarterly Review_ articles was connected” on page lxv\r\n\r\n  “a royal proclamamation” changed to\r\n  “a royal proclamation” on page lxvi\r\n\r\nTitle page of 4th edition\r\n\r\n  “_Richard Cbiswell_ in St. _Paul’s_ Churchyard” changed to\r\n  “_Richard Chiswell_ in St. _Paul’s_ Churchyard” on page lxxiii\r\n\r\nTo the King\r\n\r\n  “_Monarchs_ of this _Nation, since_” changed to\r\n  “_Monarchs_ of this _Nation_, since” on page lxxv\r\n\r\nFootnotes lxxx:2 and lxxx:3\r\n\r\n  In the original, the marker for footnote 2 on page lxxx was by\r\n  “not the Majesty of a _Consul_”, but the text of footnote 3 clearly\r\n  belongs to this marker. It has been assumed that footnote 2 actually\r\n  belongs to the latin quotation ending “nec ullius acuminis\r\n  Rusticationem.”\r\n\r\nFootnote lxxxiii:1\r\n\r\n  The marker for this footnote is missing in the original. The footnote\r\n  refers to the latin quotation ending “neque Discipulos cognovi.”\r\n\r\nTo the Reader\r\n\r\n  “their scatter’d _Phœnomena_” changed to\r\n  “their scatter’d _Phænomena_” on page lxxxviii\r\n\r\n  “_Ptolemœan Hypotheses_” changed to\r\n  “_Ptolemæan Hypotheses_”  on page lxxxix\r\n\r\n  “on which to lay the stress,;” changed to\r\n  “on which to lay the stress;” on page lxxxix\r\n\r\n  “Φιλοσοφίας έπιθυμεῖς; παρασκευάζου αύτόθεν” changed to\r\n  “Φιλοσοφίας ἐπιθυμεῖς‧ παρασκευάζου αὐτόθεν” on page xcvii\r\n\r\n  “Parts thoughout this _Discourse_” changed to\r\n  “Parts throughout this _Discourse_” on page xcviii\r\n\r\nThe Garden\r\n\r\n  Stanza beginning “Where does the Wisdom and the Power Divine” was\r\n  numbered 6 in the original on page cxiv.

The second marker\r\n  is clearly intended to mark footnote 2.\r\n\r\nChapter III §7\r\n\r\n  The citation in Footnote 42:1 is to book 1 of the Georgics, but the\r\n  quotation in question is actually from book 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 62:1\r\n\r\n  There is no marker for this footnote in the original.
